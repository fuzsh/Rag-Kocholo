        "text": "We had no idea where to start, but we knew we wanted to run away to get married. We both love the sea and the mountains, so Montenegro seemed perfect, plus we had both always wanted to visit since we had met each other. When we stumbled across DSA online, we were so unsure of how to go about getting married abroad! But Alina was so calm and made everything so clear to us, answering all of our questions (no matter how many or how silly they were!)\n\nFrom start to finish Alina made our journey a smooth one – all over skype videos during a covid pandemic – so you can imagine the extra worry that we had considering everything at that time! She guided us with ease through the technicalities, so that we could focus on the more ‘fun’ stuff like choosing the venue (from one’s which she carefully picked out based on our interests!) and writing a food menu (completely tailor made to our requests AND so delicious and fresh!). The smaller choices like flowers, chairs, table decor, I LOVED this part, and the choices which they provided were concise enough to offer some direction, but were really unlimited, so if you went off on a tangent (which I’m sure I did!) It didn’t matter – because Alina could do it, after all, it is our wedding day she kept reminding us!\n\nDajana was there for us on our wedding day every step of the way, coordinating it and ensuring that it flowed – something I can’t thank her enough for as there is no way i couldve done this myself, especially as a few personal events leading up to the day had left me stressed out and having not had much sleep.\n\nAnd my bunch were a bit excited to be there, so were a nightmare to manage! So I know it would’ve taken a lot of work for Dajana and the team, but the day was honestly seamless.\n\nAll of the staff on the day probably thought we were mad… but were nothing other than wonderful, friendly and professional, going the extra mile to make it the beautiful, crazy, perfect day that it was. THANK YOU Alina, Dajana and all of DSA for all of your efforts, professionalism and complete and utter PATIENCE… you have given us an absolute dream come true. The memories are unreal.\n\nIf you are looking to get married abroad – I full heartedly recommend DSA, they will deliver more than what you imagine; and we will never forget them and what they did for us. Montenegro is the most stunning country with even more stunning people. My only regret is to not have spent longer there, after our big day, to take in everything that had just happened.\n\nLove, Bethany and Christian Waite\n\nP.s. I forgot to mention, we don’t speak a word of Montenegrin – so this was all done in English… even more amazing\n\n»Why Montenegro? There are two factors… I’ve been dreaming of a wedding by the sea since childhood, when we started planning a wedding, we ran into a problem that my relatives were in Ukraine and Artem’ were in Russia, Kazakstan and Germany, most of our friends were in the Czech Republic, so we wanted to choose a neutral country where are residents of all these countries allowed to go without problems. On the Internet I found a DSA agency at that time we’ve never been there, we arrived in Montenegro to meet a Alina and Dayana from this agency and just fell in love with this country, these girls were our irreplaceable assistants for 5 months! Always promptly answered any of our questions and wishes. This agency organized a lot of weddings in Montenegro, I can say with confidence they are real Pros If you think about a wedding in this beautiful country. They will give you options of wedding whatever you wish for, and suitable for any financial possibilities. Elena and Artem\n\n»The first thing I did after we decided on the country was to find a wedding agency. Actually, this is the answer to the question why the head didn’t hurt from questions and searches … The girls from the DSA agency were on the phone every minute we needed and always answered questions and wishes, not only about the wedding, but also about holiday in the country in general 🥰 I just sent a photo of the bouquet, a picture of the arch, wishes for the location, etc., and they made the dream come true 100% 😇 I’m lying, it was even better 😍 Imagine, we only needed to buy rings, a dress and a suit, and just fly in. And our perfect wedding has already been created 😍 The DSA team is all proven masters: florists, make-up artists, photographers and coordinators. This is what I consciously approached, this is the choice of a photographer. I didn’t even look for a dress so diligently😂 I mean it, wedding agency is a 100% necessity, especially when the wedding is abroad. And here it is important not to make a mistake with the choice. With the choice of those people with whom you will be on the same wavelength. Who will listen and hear and magically turn your ideas into reality. Perhaps there are people who do without the help of such people, but i prefer my nerves to be okay😇🙈 Svetlana and Vladimir\n\n»We would like to express our gratitude to the DSA Weddings agency and all the team who created something absolutely extraordinary during the pandemic in June 2021! Moreover, our wedding was not quite ordinary – I am from Russia, my fiance is from the USA. We clearly imagined what we wanted to see our holiday, and everything was done clearly and in accordance with our expectations. We went through a lot of agencies before choosing DSA weddings. Firstly, the manager Alina answered all questions at any time of the day or night, both at the very beginning and throughout the preparation of the wedding process, and even after. An extremely pleasant and patient person. The contract was adjusted according to our wishes, the prepayment method was selected according to our convenience. Secondly, the organizer is Dayana. Incredibly smiling, serious and responsible person. Absolutely everything has been thought out, down to the smallest detail. From the fabric on the chairs to a guided tour for guests during our photo shoot. Thirdly, Dayana’s husband is a videographer Dmitry. A very pleasant and easy-to-communicate person, made extraordinary shots and a magical wedding video. Fourth, the assistant is Anastasia. A very nice girl who helped me (the bride) in all the little things on the wedding day, especially during periods of anxiety. All negotiations with florists, hotel managers, boats, stylist, receptionists – the guys took over. In the midst of a pandemic, it’s especially striking how they managed to correlate everything. Absolutely all participants of the wedding process did everything on time. We could rely on them, although me, my husband and our wedding were all in different countries. They helped us outside the wedding day (with transport, PCR tests, etc.) and, most importantly: documents. We were very worried about the documentary part of our marriage, but in vain. The guys did everything right, right up to sending wedding certificates to me in Russia and to my husband in America. I never thought that everything would be so extraordinary, without nerves and misunderstandings. I strongly recommend contacting this agency, as they will make your wedding unforgettable! Thank you very much. Alyona and Adam.\n\n»We had our perfect dream wedding. There was not even a little think we could complain about. Everything was just perfect and 100% as we wanted it. We had only a few months to plan it, and we had very detailed wishes and all could be taken into account. Dajana and Alina had so much patience. Even when we had to change our venue last minute, because we didnt like it, everything was still perfect at the end.\n\nWe both had never been to Montenegro, so we were a bit nervous, if everything would work out, but they took really good care about everything. Everyone else involved, the make up artist, our photographer and musician were also all highly professional. Also the process with all the documents was very uncomplicated. We can both highly recommend everyone, thinking about getting married in Montenegro to hire DSA weddings as their wedding planners. Thank you again for the best day of our lives 🙂 Julia & Jay\n\n»We would like to express our huge gratitude to the entire DSA Weddings team for our unforgettable wedding in Montenegro, which exceeded all our expectations! Starting with the preparation for the wedding – the choice of location, decor, menu, etc. the guys from the agency were as flexible as possible, listened to our wishes, offered different options, gave recommendations. In fact, after choosing all the main attributes of the wedding, we were only required to buy rings, a dress and come – the agency did everything else for us) I couldn’t even believe it a little. Just before the wedding, we were very worried about the weather, as rain was forecast, and the ceremony and dinner were supposed to be outdoors. But the day before the wedding, Dayana and I met on the playground and all the worries went away – she offered a non-standard solution to how to have dinner outdoors, and even in case of rain, not to move the wedding indoors. Literally in a day we organized an awning for our terrace and were calm! Thank you very much to Dayana for her indifference and flexibility in this matter) On the wedding day itself, the agency’s team quickly and super professionally prepared the site – although both we and the guests lived in the villa where the ceremony took place, the preparatory work did not bother anyone. Separately, I would like to mention the excellent team of florists and decorators – the arch, bouquets, table setting were magical! Thanks to the well-coordinated work of the DSA team on this day, we were able to really relax and enjoy the holiday without worrying about anything – everything was organized perfectly, we did not forget even our smallest wishes. The ceremony, dinner, service, band and DJ – everything was perfect. It’s like we’ve been in a fairy tale! Thanks to DSA Weddings for this! Vera and Daniel\n\n»We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the entire DSA TEAM for organizing our wedding. Alina advised on all issues, explained everything in detail, thank you for your concern and advice on choosing a restaurant. Dayana is a very positive and responsible person, she controlled everything to be at the highest level, defused the situation, and detained crowds of tourists while we were photographed at the most beautiful venues. Dmitry is a great professional in his field, we met the day before X-day to get acquainted and find contact, as a result we talked like old friends, it was a pleasure to work with him, very easy and comfortable. Irina, just a few of the first photos made a splash among all her friends, helped with posing, so that the photos turned out to be as natural and incredibly beautiful as possible, like from a movie about love. Special thanks for the decor, everything was like in a fairy tale). At the beginning of the day there was a light mondrage, but with the arrival of Natalia’s stylist, everything was taken off by hand, chatted, made a chic hairstyle, persistent makeup that will withstand the full range of emotions and any weather conditions, checked. Well, thanks to Oscar – a charismatic, charming presenter: for beautiful words and wishes. It was truly the best day of our lives. We are very glad that we accidentally found you on Instagram and entrusted you with the most important event. Everything was so magical that I didn’t want the day to end. We wish you strength, health and inspiration to continue to create and create a fairy tale for the young. Svetlana and Vladimir"
