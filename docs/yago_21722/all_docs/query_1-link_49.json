        "text": "The remains of the Italian king Victor Emmanuel III were flown back from Alexandria, Egypt for reburial at the Sanctuary of Vicoforte, a church in the province of Cuneo, Piedmont. He was interred Monday in a chapel besides his wife, Queen Elena, who also returned to Italy on Friday from France.\n\nVictor Emmanuel III reigned during the countryâs fascist regime from 1900 until 1946. He drew criticism for failing to prevent Benito Mussolini for rising to power in 1922, and for fleeing Rome in 1944 to avoid the invasion of the German army. Victor Emmanuel III died in exile in 1947 in Alexandria, Egypt, a year after abdicating the throne to his son, Umberto II, in an attempt to preserve the monarchy. His remains had been kept in Alexandria at St. Catherineâs Cathedral.\n\nThe remains of his wife, Queen Elena, were transferred Friday from Montpellier, France, and were similarly buried in the chapel during a private ceremony. She died in France in 1952.\n\nTheir repatriation has drawn much criticism, both from family members who opposed their silent return, to members of the countryâs Jewish community and other Italians who resisted fascism. In 1946, a plebiscite abolished the monarchy in favor of a republic and as punishment for supporting the fascist dictator Mussolini, male descendants of the Royal House of Savoy were constitutionally banned from Italian soil. The ban was lifted in 2002.\n\nRepatriation shrouded in mystery\n\nThe coffin, which was light brown and draped in a flag that had the coat of arms of the Savoy family on it, arrived at 1 pm from at the Levaldigi airport. The kingâs remains were escorted to Sanctuary by three institutional figures: the prefect vicar Bambagiotti, the village mayor Roattino and the president of Cuneoâs Chamber of Commerce, Ferruccio Dardanello.\n\nFew people were allowed in the church during the official interment. Following the burial, count Federico Radicati of Primeglio issued a press statement on behalf of the Savoia family (the proxy of Prince Vittorio Emanuele and Princess Maria Gabriella): Â«Recently, there has been much talk of secrecy, but not there was nothing secret, it was simply confidential as is normal in family matters. Our hope is that his return to Italy can lead to greater tolerance regarding the historical vision, the historical memory, of ItalyÂ». When asked if the whole family agreed to the transfer, the count replied: Â«This is a family matter that does not concern me, I cannot say moreÂ».\n\nItalyâs first two Savoy kings, Victor Emmanuel II and Umberto I, and its first queen, Margherita, are all buried at the Pantheon in Rome. The king and queenâs great-grandson, Emanuele Filiberto was pleased with the return of his ancestors to Italy, however, was quoted saying that members of the House of Savoy, shouldnât be buried in just any tomb, but deserved to be in the Pantheon, where many other family members lie. Heâs also criticized the secrecy with which Elenaâs remains were repatriated, saying he first heard of the news from media reports. Filiberto and his father returned to Italy after the ban was lifted in 2002.\n\nAfter the funerary rites, visitors were invited to pay respects. Piercarlo Bormida, 47, a former monarchist told La Stampa: Â«I believed in the monarchy as a boy, but now I no longer believe in anything. I do not believe in Italyâs bandwagon, only in my land, PiedmontÂ».\n\nPaolo Carbonero, another visitor, said he sees Â«no danger in the return of the kingâs remains to Italy. This is also democracyÂ». Meanwhile, Ugo Filippi, a retired MondovÃ¬ banker said both their returns were astonishing. He remembers his schoolâs history classes, where they taught him that Vittorio Emanuele III was known as âsciabolettaâ, or small sabre, due to his short stature. Â«They had to lengthen his hats and shorten his sabers to make him look slimmer. He did a lot of gymnastics exercises to try and lengthen the bonesÂ».\n\nBut for others that day, the wound still cut deep. A gentleman near the entrance of the church affixed a piece paper that had a print-out of a plaque located in Piazza UnitÃ dâItalia in Trieste. The plaque had the following engraving: Â«On September 18, 1938 Mussolini chose this square to announce the issuance of anti-Jewish racial laws, and indelible stain of the fascist regime and Italian monarchyÂ». That gentleman added his signature to the sheet and wrote in pen at the bottom: Â«A perennial memoryÂ»."
