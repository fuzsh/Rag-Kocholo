        "text": "Victor Emmanuel III (born November 11, 1869, Naples, Italy—died December 28, 1947, Alexandria, Egypt) was the king of Italy whose reign brought the end of the Italian monarchy.\n\nAfter a mainly military education, he came suddenly to the throne in 1900 on the assassination of his father, King Umberto I. A tractable constitutional monarch, he accepted a Liberal cabinet and readily acquiesced in Italy’s war against Turkey in 1911 and entrance into World War I in 1915.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz\n\nWhen the strains put on the parliamentary system by the war brought Mussolini to the fore, Victor Emmanuel failed to prevent the Fascist seizure of power, though it apparently lay in his hands to do so merely by signing the decree of martial law proposed by the cabinet. He was quickly reduced to a figurehead or less by the Mussolini dictatorship, but in 1943, following disastrous Italian military reverses in World War II, capped by the Allied invasion of Sicily, Victor Emmanuel surprised the world by having Mussolini arrested and installing Marshal Pietro Badoglio as premier. The move failed to extricate Italy from the war or the King from his difficult position, and finally, on June 5, 1944, the day after the Allied liberation of Rome, he named his son Crown Prince Umberto lieutenant general of the realm, relinquishing all power for himself but retaining his title of king."
