        "text": "‚ÄòAm I in paradise or on the moon?‚Äô George Bernard Shaw famously quipped from the top of Mount Lovƒáen in Montenegro. Adriatic sea stretches to the horizon to its west and on a clear day you can see Italy; to the south is Skadar Lake, beyond it ‚Äì the dark, mysterious hills of Albania; in the north is Bay of Kotor, Europe‚Äôs southernmost fjord‚Ä¶\n\nTo get to Kotor Fjord from the historical capital, Cetinje, once the only way lead through the mountains, up the steep, narrow and oddly curved road‚Ä¶ When you look at it from the top of the mountain ‚Äì a capital letter M is clearly seen, it seems to be engraved into the landscape by the road‚Ä¶ The legend is that French architect commissioned to oversee the construction in this way declared his love for beautiful Montenegrin Queen Milena ‚Äì and had ran away from the country for his life! Whether the story is true we can not know, but Montenegrin women are known for their beauty ‚Äì King Nikola and Queen Milena‚Äôs daughters had married into the most influential European dynasties and our King will be nick-named ‚Äúthe father in law of Europe‚Äù!\n\nElena of Montenegro (born Princess Jelena Petroviƒá-Njego≈° of Montenegro) was wife of Victor Emmanuel III and Queen of Italy from 1900 until 1946; by Italians she was named ‚ÄúLa Bella Elena‚Äù ‚Äì beautiful Elena.\n\nTwo of our other princesses, with keen interest in the occult, Milica and Anastasia, had married into Romanov dynasty and it was them who later on introduced mysterious Rasputin to the Russian Court.\n\nIf you read serious historical sources ‚Äì you‚Äôll learn of False Tsar Stephen the Little; for my thesis i studied carefully archives of Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the diplomatic correspondence exchanged between two courts ‚Äì Montenegrins were fully aware that their ruler had a false identity; but did they care? Not the least ‚Äì he was a great ruler and that was the only thing that mattered; where he came from and who he was in reality ‚Äì nobody knows until today.\n\nThe longest war in history , Montenegrin ‚Äì Japanese war, lasted from 1905 ‚Äì 2006; when Russia declared war to Japan, the teeny kingdom sided with its ally and also proclaimed war to the Country of the Raising Sun! Albeit the answer was never received ‚Äì Montenegrin gesture was not merely symbolical ‚Äì the best warriors chosen from the most reputable of the tribes, along with Russians went to war, fought bravely, won victories and received medals! Again, all of it is documented in the archives of Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs where the names of these people who fought against Samurai and the awards they received are meticulously listed!\n\nThen super powers got busy with their own business and it‚Äôs only in 2006, when high representative of Japanese Government traveled to Montenegro to recognize our regained independence ‚Äì that the truce was signed!\n\nMontenegro is one of the oldest countries in Europe ‚Äì Principality Doclea, the great-grand mother of Montenegro, was formed in 9th century; it shall have a turbulent personal history, like many outstandingly beautiful and rebellious princesses did ‚Ä¶ In 1042 it shall run away from what once was considered her home ‚Äì the mighty Byzantine empire, in 1421, it shall get kidnapped by a Serbian Despotate; princess by birthright would renounce its nobility by joining the working class family of Yugoslav people and shall remain quite happy in its new home, as long as her inborn sense of human dignity was not jeopardized and her honorable name brought down to dirt. That‚Äôs when the princess decided it was the high time she hit the road and became a sovereign queen. (In 2006. Montenegro has regained its independence.)\n\nIn an earlier essay, Death by chocolate, i‚Äôve written on Montenegrin cuisine.\n\nFavorite entr√©e is Njegushi cheese stored in oil ‚Äì let alone that goats and cows are fed freely on the nearest valley on herbs and grass typical of this region, the cheese is later smoked at home and the village of Njegushi is unique for its blend of sea-air with the air from the mountains; two climates intersecting in that very spot give the food a taste that‚Äôs impossible to second.\n\nAfter the cheese is imbued with this unique aroma ‚Äì it‚Äôs stored in olive oil and that‚Äôs a story unto itself, because the oil is hand made by monks in the monasteries on the coast; at the end you get a a small piece of cheese that‚Äôs threaded with history of this magical kingdom of Black Mountains. The cheese, it seems, is served mostly to go along with the story of our rulers, Petrovic Njegos dynasty, and their tribe of Njegusi; the monks, while making the oil ‚Äì read prayers and these prayers give you the strength of a tiny rebellious nation, which resisted its numerous oppressors for centuries and never in its history was enslaved.\n\nAs you would be snacking on the cheese, you would get served Montenegrin brandy ‚Äì Prvijenac, which is made by unique technologies and in limited quantities; it comes in numbered bottles, like a part of a collection ‚Äì which basically it is.\n\nThere is that joke ‚Äì the proverbial Russian, American and Montenegrin argued whose beverage is the best and , as expected, without having agreed ‚Äì they decided to conduct an experiment; a group of mice got treated to Whiskey, Vodka and Prvijenac respectively and the effects were observed and recorded.\n\nThe mouse who had Whiskey started walking around nonchalantly, with a seductive aura of a western-movie actor, he demanded his own Colt to protect the mice maidens and after a while rode into the sunset.\n\nThe mouse who had Vodka started quoting Russian Classics and despairing over the current state of the world‚Äôs affairs, lady mice were admiring him while silently wiping off tears with tiny handkerchiefs and praying that this hero wins the duel against the usual bad guy.\n\nThe mouse who drank of Prvijenac just stood there.\n\nAfter some time, he stood on his back paws and yelled out in a human voice, carrying the menace of vengeance high and low: Ladies, back to the hole, you have no business here! Where is the bloody cat?! I‚Äôll do it away with my bare hands! ‚ÄòNuff of this oppression! Come out, you villain, fight as a man!\n\nYou get an idea‚Ä¶\n\nHere you can see the gallery of pictures from Kotor Fjord, Scadar lake and other shots of the amazing Black Mountains.\n\nP.S. Just in case you are wondering what‚Äôs gotten into me to write on my country once again ‚Äì it‚Äôs that after bitching about FP in how NOT to get freshly pressed, EVER, i do think the guys behind Daily Prompt deserve cudos for coming up with today‚Äôs ‚ÄúLocal Flavor‚Äò. üòâ\n\n0.000000\n\n0.000000\n\nI was just re-constructing with Ari√© the fire from Be ready to lose everything , what had preceded it and what followed‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs almost six months since then and only the other day i gathered the courage to climb up the Gorica Hill and see with my own eyes what is left of it. I am not sure what i expected, but what i‚Äôve seen had taken me by surprise and left me with a profound admiration for the powers of the nature.\n\nYou‚Äôd know that i am a city girl, i am not so much into wandering clouds, drifting waves & all that jazz ‚Äì and, before you ask, i am not impressed by Sergei Yesenin the least (except for his being married to grand Isadora Duncan and the fact that they met at the house in which Bulgakov lived while writing Master and Margarita, but that‚Äôs a topic unto itself.)\n\nWith Vuk ‚Äì my friends‚Äô kid whom i consider my own ‚Äì we studied Beckett earlier this evening, and to get to absurdism, we needed to go through scholasticism, Tomas Aquinas and to tackle Spinoza and his glorification of the nature as well. Might sound complicated, but if the Holy Torah can be thought while standing on one leg, as the saying goes, then both Aquinas and Spinoza are piece of cake, no?\n\nIt is so actually ‚Äì all mystification, mental onania and ego trips aside, Aquinas wasn‚Äôt even a philosopher per se, he was a dogmatic persuading the reader into presumably pre-existing truths, that ain‚Äôt philosophy, but brain washing.\n\nAnd Spinoza‚Ä¶ dunno, the history of philosophy is full of my fellow Jews desperately looking for God in all the places where He can‚Äôt be found, in my opinion all of them would have being better of studying the Torah, but anyway ‚Äì you can imagine that i find little worth in Spinoza‚Äôs musings too.\n\nAbsurdists do impress me though, i love Beckett and was supposed to write the PhD thesis on Daniil Kharms ‚Äì the thing is that the program was offered in Voronezh only and in our parts you don‚Äôt want to live anywhere else but in the capital, that‚Äôs how i ended up with doctoral theses in methodics at Pushkin Uni in Moscow ‚Ä¶ but that‚Äôs another story too.\n\nAnyhow, in ‚ÄúWaiting for Godot‚Äù , Estragon says:‚ÄùWe should turn resolutely towards nature‚Äù, but then they decide together with Vladimir that it has been done before and isn‚Äôt really worth it ‚Äì there, Spinoza written off in three lines.\n\nThat‚Äôs the genius of Beckett and minimalism, G-d forbid that Aquinas is reincarnated ‚Äì it would have taken him all the volumes of Encyclopedia Britannica to come to that which S.B. said in ten words or so.\n\nOf course, i have my own absurdist discourse ‚Äì and it is definitely not connected to lurking behind it existentialism; it‚Äôs that writing style of Beckett and Kharms too, to me is equal to meditating on Zen Koans‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs absurd, it waits around the corner for your analytic thinking ‚Äì jumps at it and takes it over by surprise; after the absurdists had seized your logyc and pre-thought concepts, and went on run with them ‚Äì you are left‚Ä¶ in the zone, some label it Dao, some ‚Äì Nirvana, whichever suits you.\n\nThere are all the answers ‚Äì in case you are looking for them, but if you have arrived here, it means you are not looking anymore‚Ä¶ absurd, i know ‚Äì but only if starting from the dualistic thinking in the first place.\n\nAnyhow, if observing the nature in a way, unadulterated by Spinoza‚Äôs idolization and without any other expectations from which all human disappointment stems ‚Äì even a disgruntled city dweller like me has to admit it‚Äôs downright marvelous.\n\nYou see, what left me in awe during the other day‚Äôs hike was the fact that the hill above the city has totally recovered meanwhile ‚Äì in the place of almost each burned down tree, there are two or three babies growing up‚Ä¶ And all i could think of was the I Ching‚Äôs Hexagram 49, Revolution‚Ä¶ I think pretty much everything has been said on it, here are two excellent articles ‚Äì this one i discovered by chance and was impressed by author‚Äôs writing style, creativity and ‚Äì at the same time ‚Äì her academic approach (just check out how meticulously are listed the sources ‚Äì such an academic thing to do ; ) the other is by my favorite contemporary I Ching Scholar, Hilary Barret, whose interpretations to me personally are just the perfect blend of Confucianism and Taoism.\n\nOther sources definitely worth checking out, yet unavailable online are Cleary‚Äôs ‚ÄúTaoist I Ching‚Äù which explains the 49th hexagram in terms of refining Yin energy ‚Äì as an essential step in the process of producing the (inner) alchemical elixir* and, of course, ‚ÄúThe Complete I Ching‚Äù by the Taoist Master Alfred Huang as the latter gives the best insight into related Chinese ideograms/ characters.\n\n(*According to Huang, the lake in the image is metal related to the West and fire is the fire associated with the South; refining metal by fire produces brightness, the metal melts and returns to the root. In preceding it hexagram 48, joy is produced from the midst of danger ‚Äì this one is about taking true Yang in water, so to get out of danger. Thus, to crystallize the elixir and, by doing so, attain joy ‚Äì one needs to restore yin in fire and take true yang in water ‚Äì it‚Äôs that ‚Äúsimple.‚Äù )\n\nAs a side note ‚Äì Huang translates the 49th hexagram as ‚ÄúAbolishing the old‚Äù connecting it to Ge ‚Äòs original meaning of alternation and change, which later on extended to mean Revolution as well (both being an integral part of the same process.)\n\nA certain dear to me gentleman with whom i correspond wrote me recently: ‚Äúyou were very quick, hard but in next second soft and beautiful‚Ä¶‚Äù not downright quetching, but given that it‚Äôs brought up, obviously such attitude is neither expected, nor an everyday occurrence, albeit it is the only natural attitude.\n\nSee, weather changes, people change ‚Äì you are not the same person you were only seven years ago, everything in your body has changed meanwhile, except for the genetic memory‚Ä¶ Yours (and mine) being narrowed down to predictability is the society‚Äôs ways to keep control, yet it‚Äôs the most unnatural thing of all.\n\nOne might ask how does that go in hand with so dear to my heart fortune-telling? You see, i don‚Äôt believe in fortune-telling, what i do, using various tools, is quite precise diagnostics and based on it prognosis‚Ä¶ and those are always made with force majeure in mind.\n\nBalkan etimology\n\n‚Äúmorati‚Äù is the word for must in my language\n\nno shoulds, no woulds, no coulds\n\nmorash means you obey\n\nno questions asked\n\nit‚Äôs not the way you speak in English\n\n‚Äúm√≥ra‚Äù means ‚Äì nightmare\n\nof a kind\n\nwhich leaves you in sweat\n\nshivering between the sheets\n\nstaring at the ceiling\n\nand thinking\n\nof this surreal peninsula\n\nwhere every fifty years\n\nthe wise shut up,\n\nthe fool commences talking\n\nand the scum gets reach\n\nor something like that\n\n‚Äúmora‚Äù is also ‚Äì many seas,\n\nalbeit we have one only\n\nand ask not for more\n\n(who needs more than one sea?)\n\n‚Äúgora ‚Äú is mountain,\n\n‚Äúgore‚Äù is worse\n\nand it also means burns‚Ä¶\n\nAnd the city in which I live is PodGORica,\n\nThe city under the hill\n\nBaby-mountain so to say\n\nAnd the main of its six rivers\n\nIs Moracha,\n\nWhich, as it should, has to\n\nMust\n\nRuns through the city\n\nWhich burns upwards,\n\nToward the murky Balkan sky\n\nL.R.S.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nETA for typos\n\n0.000000\n\n0.000000\n\nThe best way to avoid boring reality of Podgorica is to spend the time on the rooftop of the building where Miro lives. The magic of the terrace surpasses by far its physical limitations ‚Äì the former spreads above the offices of Omniauto, stretches across the entire Spaniard cicrcuse and reaches all the way down to the suburbs. The monumental, metaphisical building with time adopted the qualities of the people who spend long, hot summers there. Up here, the climat is very different, it‚Äôs fresh and breezy even when down there the city is melting on over hundred degrees Fahrenheit. The terrace is capricious like Bibi, strong and determined like Miro, from Ivo she got joy de vivre, she longs for the occult after me‚Ä¶\n\nWe really have to watch out whom we let up here, the terrace can sometimes get cranky and downright mean if we let in someone who doesn‚Äôt belong here. Once it swollowed the pizza delivery boy‚Ä¶ and spitted him out at the sea-shore, thirty miles away from the city!\n\nSome people are always here, some ‚Äì only occasionaly, some visit only once‚Ä¶\n\nMisses Anka, Miro‚Äôs mother, with a halo of ash-blond hair, wearing embrodiered white dress and fine leather sandals, is always here ‚Äì even when she is at work; her patients at the hospital usually don‚Äôt realise that this lady is being at two places at the same time.\n\nMy close friend Bibi sometimes decides we should miss her even more than we do usually and, moving the clouds with her hips, she walks away, heading to her studio in Toloshe, which is not all that far away. She has to come back when people on Spaniard Circus are covered in plaster that fell off the terrace which mourns her absence.\n\nCvjetko Lainoviƒá is always here, with us. That night when he died he promissed he will stay forever here, under this whitness which he personally painted in the very night he died. Even the proverbially suspicious terrace trusts him on this one because she knows that sky above her is the whitest sky of all‚Ä¶ At down, when the white sky is cut with little purple veins, Cvetko covers his eyes with white butterflies, this way he protects the whitness of his vision even during these momenets when the night gives birth to the day.\n\nCopyright¬© 2008 Lena Ruth Stefanovic, All Rights Reserved\n\nThe story is from my second book ‚ÄòIo Triumpe‚Äô (OKF, Cetinje, 2008.) Genius Montenegrin minimalist Cvetko Lainovic, worldwide known for his ‚Äúwhite paintings‚Äù, towards the end of his life did series of interviews with Miro Minic, the owner of the capricious roof terrace, a famed journalist and a friend of mine.\n\n0.000000\n\n0.000000\n\nIf being born in former Yugoslavia has thought me anything ‚Äì it‚Äôs to be ready to lose everything in a blink of an eye. I can‚Äôt even count how many times i started all over again ‚Äì at some place where i never thought i‚Äôd be living and having only personal belongings with me. That life of a perpetual wanderer had thought me many things ‚Äì and placed all of my views on life in general in quite an ephemeral and illusionary framework.\n\nIn the first place ‚Äì it thought me never to identify with what‚Äôs temporarily in my possession; we are not what we have and whatever it is that we have can be gone overnight, if not sooner.\n\nIn Epistulae Morales 9.18-19, Seneca tells story of philosopher Stilpon, whose homeland was captured; as he was walking away from conflagration by himself, he was asked if he had lost anything. To that he replied: Omnia mea mecum porto ‚Äì all my goods are with me. By doing so, he made the enemy doubt whether he actually won as his goods were with him ‚Äì justice, virtue, prudence and the very fact that he considered that, which could be snatched away ‚Äì worthless.\n\nIt was somewhere after 11pm the other night when we felt the smell of smoke and heard the noise of firemen‚Äôs cars running somewhere in the distance. I ran to the balcony and someone in the street yelled: it‚Äôs burning near the railway ! The railway is in some 1km/ 0.6 mi from our home ‚Äì and with the crazy wind, it was a question of minutes until it gets to our houses ‚Äì it‚Äôs woods and we are in the first line.\n\nThe shock came only after it was all over ‚Äì now that i look back, i am somewhat scared by my own lack of any sort of panic or upset in the midst of the chaos; this is what i did: taking care of my parents (who happen to be my next door neighbors as well) and cat first; the medicines they need, documents, cash, everyone‚Äôs clothes for couple of days; then jewels and my books ‚Äì something we could sell and live of at least for the first time; my prayer book, Russian ID , I Ching and several Tarot decks.\n\nOne of the mistakes i made was that i kept Manya‚Äôs carrybag in the storage room behind the house ‚Äì the fire was at the reach of my hand when i ran to get it and my mother was screaming from the balcony that i will catch fire; the thing is that my fur baby is used to this bag ‚Äì it has openings so she can see through it, otherwise it‚Äôs too traumatizing for her and she was too upset already. The other mistake was that the gas in my car was on reserve level, i i didn‚Äôt tank it last time, so in case we needed to ‚Äì we wouldn‚Äôt be able to get further then 50km/ some 30 miles ‚Äì and the traffic was crazy and gas stations were closed of course. I had also took a wrong passport ‚Äì i keep several old ones because when you go to an Embassy of a country for which we still need visas ‚Äì like US or UK ‚Äì they ask you details of previously issued ones, that‚Äôs why; so that‚Äôs something i need to sort out too, otherwise i end up AGAIN with a passport of no longer existing country‚Ä¶ and i have had several of those.\n\nThe fire was tamed some four hours later and everyone went back to their respective homes, but Hexagram 56, The Traveler has been on my mind ever since‚Ä¶\n\nWhen a man is a wanderer and stranger, he should not be gruff nor overbearing. He has no large circle of acquaintances, therefore he should not give himself airs. He must be cautious and reserved; in this way he protects himself from evil. If he is obliging toward others, he wins success.\n\nA wanderer has no fixed abode; his home is the road. Therefore he must take care to remain upright and steadfast, so that he sojourns only in the proper places, associating only with good people. Then he has good fortune and can go his way unmolested.\n\n(Wilhelm‚Äôs translation)\n\nFor no matter what, aren‚Äôt we all merely travelers in this life?\n\nLaudator Temporis Acti: http://laudatortemporisacti.blogspot.com/2007/07/omnia-mea-mecum-porto.html\n\nFOCUS News Agency: Montenegro: Wildfire breaks out near Podgorica http://www.focus-fen.net/?id=n283295\n\nI-Ching Hexagram 56 ‚Äì Lu ‚Äì The Wanderer http://theabysmal.wordpress.com/2006/10/27/i-ching-hexagram-56/\n\n0.000000\n\n0.000000\n\nX\n\nThe Wheel of Fortune\n\nEmily Carding‚Äôs Tarot of Black Mountain\n\nI was in love with a city, better to say I loved a city ‚Äì maybe because I was born in it, maybe because it was white ‚Äì who knows. I met many other cities, some bigger cities, some preattier cities, i met some more mysterious cities ‚Äì but the white citi was my city. In the White city myself I was white, almost transparent.\n\nSuddenly, my city began loosing it ‚Äôs genuine, virgin whitenes and started becoming somehow grayish.\n\nI still loved it, equally as i loved it while it was completely white, though i noticed that myself i developed some dirty white nuances of the gray color. My nails turned into pail gray, my skin began resembling the dark grey color of the feather, which tuckled in by the southern wind stayed on the paved road that once upon a time was white, as a reminder of a big bird who turned gray and flew to the East. The whites of my eyes became dark gray and they were hardly seen, only my hair was still absolutely white. When i noticed the first gray hair in my absolutely white hair, i new that the trickster time won‚Äôt wait for me and that i should take off on the journey.\n\nI went to the East, where long time ago sons of Abraham were heading carriyng the gifts. Unfortunately, in the East they didn‚Äôt remeber Abraham‚Äôs sons. It seemed to me sometimes that for a moment i spotted a precious part of those most valuable, long lost gifts, but usually it would turn out to be just a piece of glass that time has polished.\n\nFrom the East i returned to the Black Country from where my ancestors long time ago had left for the White City. I believed the Black Country to be totally black and i was amazed when, unexpectedly, i met there a white spot. The white spot was almost as surprised as i was, she was exhausted by the long awaiting of such a short encounter. During the darkest hour, she colored me into raven-black.\n\nAccording to the memories of others at that very moment i stopped fearing because the black and white me in that moment was gone, the former-me was replaced by a virgin spot that very slowly, but unstoppably began transforming into a big white circle.\n\nAuthor‚Äôs Note: in ex-Yugoslav languages ‚ÄìBosnian, Croatian, Montenegrin, Serbian ‚Äì the name of my country, Crna Gora, literally means Black Mountain, while\n\nthe capital of Serbia, Beograd literally is the White City from my childhood and from this story‚Ä¶\n\nCopyright ¬© 2008 Lena Ruth Stefanovic\n\nAll Rights Reserved\n\nEmily Carding created the magnificent Tarot of Black Mountain, which was published with the book ‚Äì collection of Tarot inspired short stories ‚ÄúIo Triumpe‚Äù published by OKF, Cetinje 2008.\n\nTarot of Black MountainCopyright ¬© 2008 EmilyCarding All Rights Reserved\n\nimage posted with permission\n\n0.000000\n\n0.000000"
