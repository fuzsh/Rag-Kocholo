        "text": "Full Name: Vittorio Emanuele Ferdinando Maria Gennaro di Savoia\n\nProfession: King of Italy\n\nBiography: Known as the 'little sabre' or the 'little king' due to his diminutive 5ft height, Emmanuel's reign lasted from 1900 until his abdication in 1946. In this time Italy saw the rise of fascism with Benito Mussolini and fought in two world wars.\n\nHe appointed Mussolini as prime minister after the fascist March on Rome in 1922 but later spearheaded a coup against him in 1943, which led to the collapse of the fascist regime and the establishment of an armistice with the Allies who had invaded mainland Italy the same year.\n\nThe monarchy lost considerable popular support throughout the war. He abdicated in 1946 before a referendum on the abolition of the monarchy, which succeeded. His son, Umberto II, was the last Italian king, having reigned for only 34 days. After this Victor Emmanuel went into exile in Egypt and died in 1947.\n\nBorn: November 11, 1869\n\nBirthplace: Naples, Kingdom of Italy\n\nStar Sign: Scorpio"
