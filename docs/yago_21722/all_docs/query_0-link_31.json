        "text": "Victor Emmanuel III of Italy (11 November 1869-28 December 1947) was the King of Italy from 29 July 1900 to 9 May 1946, succeeding Umberto I of Italy and preceding Umberto II of Italy.\n\nBiography[]\n\nVictor Emmanuel was born on 11 November 1869 in Naples to King Umberto I of Italy and Queen Margherita of Savoy, and in 1896 he was arranged to marry Elena of Montenegro. He became king when Umberto was assassinated by an anarchist on 29 July 1900, being 31 years old at the time. Victor Emmanuel, who was only 5 feet tall, was nicknamed \"Sciaboletta\" (\"little saber\") due to his shortness. He was a part of the Triple Alliance with the German Empire and Austria-Hungary, but in 1914 he decided not to assist them when World War I began, arguing that he had a defensive alliance with them and the Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand did not count as aggression. Meanwhile, he secretly made treaties to defect to the Entente Powers, and in 1915 he declared war on the Central Powers in hopes of annexing Tyrol and Slovenia to Italy. The war was supported by many, but the astonishing loss of life at the Battle of Caporetto and the recession following the war turned the opinion of the public against him, with 400 threatening letters being sent to him."
