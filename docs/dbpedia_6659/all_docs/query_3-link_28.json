        "text": "“You talk much to Audrey?” he said.\n\n“Not really,” I said.\n\nHe seemed to relax, then he said, “Audrey is a lying piece of shit.” I looked away, fixing my eyes on the church spire, visible against the light from the stars.\n\n“I’d put a bullet in her head,” Shawn said, and I felt his body shift toward me.\n\n“But I don’t want to waste a good bullet on a worthless bitch.”\n\nIt was crucial that I not look at him. As long as I kept my eyes on the spire, I almost believed he couldn’t touch me. Almost. Because even while I clung to this belief, I waited to feel his hands on my neck. I knew I would feel them, and soon, but I didn’t dare do anything that might break the spell of waiting. In that moment part of me believed, as I had always believed, that it would be me who broke the spell, who caused it to break. When the stillness shattered and his fury rushed at me, I would know that something I had done was the catalyst, the cause. There is hope in such a superstition; there is the illusion of control."
