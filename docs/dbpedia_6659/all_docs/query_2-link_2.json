        "text": "Ahoy mateys! the last 20th the spanish speaking community of sea of thieves \"Leyendas de Sea of Thieves\" did an event to celebrate the anniversary of our community, we also took the opportunity to pay tribute to Glitterbeard. Here's all the information about this event:\n\nThe event consisted of gathering the largest number of captain's chests in a maximum of 12 hours. 5 galleons participated in it, a total of 1035 captain's chests were managed to be dug. All for one purpose, all for one cause, to be legends, to capture 1 year of adventures.\n\nIn addition to these captain's chests, 9 castaway chests, 71 sailor's chests, 99 looter's chests, 187 relics, 90 gems, 5 grog chests and 12 skeleton captain's chests were also obtained. A total of 1508 gold hoarder items.\n\nWe also made a tribute to Captain Glitterbeard.\n\nVideo\n\nI hope you like it!\n\n@jadescissors32 As the game does not allow private servers, you have to match ships in the same server.\n\n1-All the people who are going to play enter the Alliances voice channel.\n\n2-Everyone has to be in the sail screen, for example Adventure - Galleon - Crew closed.\n\n3-You must synchronize to hit sail at the same time, counting to 3 or something similar.\n\n4-Once in the tavern there are 2 ways to see if you are in the same server:\n\n1-If you are all legendary, enter the legendary tavern and wait for everyone to enter to see if you have matched.\n\n2-If you are not all legendary, kill each other and go to the Ferri of the damned and wait until everyone is dead to see if you have matched.\n\n5-Once you have been able to coincide in a server, stay in an outpost, form an alliance and enjoy the seas."
