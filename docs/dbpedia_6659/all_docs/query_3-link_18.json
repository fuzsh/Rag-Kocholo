        "text": "Published in 1929, William Faulkner\\u27s The Sound and The Fury was translated in 1961 into Arabic by Jabra Ibrahim Jabra, a prominent Arab writer and translator. Through translation, the novel\\u27s narrative configurations, especially stream of consciousness, have been of significant influence on Arab literary writers. However, not all of the source text\\u27s configurations are accounted for in the translation. This is pertaining to Faulkner\\u27s polyphonic design and dialectal structures which are prevalent in Faulkner\\u27s text. This study aims at exploring the translation strategies used by the translator to see how these configurations are treated by Jabra. Textual micro-analysis is used to describe how the translator renders the source text, explaining, through macro-analysis, how certain modes of language in the target culture encroach upon the mediation process, and how they constitute a major part of the translational performance as the translator compromises the source tex...\n\nThe novel as a modern literary genre is generally regarded as the realization of its main character&#39;s journey from immaturity to a status of maturity. The character, usually an uncomplicated person unable to cope with the complexities of life at first, gains an insight and understanding to handle his/her complex situation accordingly later in the novel. It is usually agreed in both literary criticism and linguistic criticism of literature that everything about a character should be established from the evidence of the text (see Fowler, 1977 & 1996 and Peck & Coyle, 2002, for instance). In the present study, the language of Tom Joad, the main character in John Steinbeck&#39;s The Grapes of Wrath, was analyzed to reveal how his social position is established and how his transformation from a young farm-hand holding a carpe diem philosophy to a socially-wise reformist with a commitment to bettering the future is substantialized. Oriented towards a linguistic study of literature, th...\n\nThis paper studies how two recent neo-slave narratives have been translated into Spanish: The Good Lord Bird, by James McBride, and The Underground Railroad, by Colson Whitehead. Since they were both published simultaneously in Spain in September 2017, special attention is paid to the strategies used to render Black English, which marks slaves' otherness, in the target polysystem. An overview of the origin, rise, and evolution of neo-slave narratives precedes the features of African-American Vernacular English portrayed in the novels that belong to this sub-genre. After some insights into the issue of translating literary dialect, the risks it entails, and the different strategies that can be used, the Spanish versions of McBride's and Whitehead's works are analyzed accordingly and contrasted. RESUMEN: Este artículo estudia cómo se han traducido al castellano dos novelas recientes que pertenecen al subgénero de las novelas de esclavitud: El pájaro carpintero, de James McBride, y El ferrocarril subterráneo, de Colson Whitehead. Dado que ambas se publicaron a la vez en España en septiembre de 2017, se presta especial atención a las estrategias empleadas para verter el inglés afroamericano, que subraya la otredad de los esclavos, al polisistema 1 meta. Tras una aproximación al origen y evolución de las novelas de esclavitud, se describen los rasgos del inglés afroamericano que reflejan las novelas de este subgénero. A continuación, se consideran las reflexiones en torno a la casuística de la traducción del dialecto literario, los riesgos que conlleva y las distintas estrategias a disposición de los traductores, para después analizar las versiones en castellano de las novelas de McBride y Whitehead y contrastarlas según estas consideraciones.\n\nThe history of reception of William Faulkner’s most cherished work,The Sound and the Fury, tellingly reveals the changes that have occurred in reader attitude toward the novel since its first publication in 1929. The main purpose of this paper is to explore the modalities of interpretation employed by three, culturally and historically distinct “interpretive communities” (Fish 1980): American literary critics and reviewers evaluating the novel upon its first publication, Romanian literary critics and reviewers expressing their opinion on the Romanian translation of the novel published in 1971, and contemporary Internet bloggers and commenters discussing their reading experience with the novel.Relying on Hans Robert Jauss’s notions of “aesthetic distance” and “horizon of expectation” (Jauss 1970, 1982), I have raised two questions that I will try to answer at the end of this paper. First, I would like to see whether the literary career ofThe Sound and the Furyfollows the trajectory f...\n\nThis study looks at how African-American (AA) dialects in Mark Twain’s The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn novel should be translated into the Indonesian language. For the data, sayings by AA characters featuring the African-American English (AAE) phonological dialect were selected. An emphasis was placed on how Twain makes use of dialects as a tool for characterization, but what translation technique should be applied for Indonesian? The results reveal that nearly all the sentences spoken by the AA characters contain AAE phonological features. The extensive number of phonological dialect features makes it very clear to readers how the AA characters speak distinctively. These phonological features also serve to highlight the character’s ethnic, social, and geographical backgrounds. This dialect is absent in the Indonesian translation, however, because translators replace AAE utterances with the standard Indonesian language, its colloquial form, or simply delete them, so the experienc..."
