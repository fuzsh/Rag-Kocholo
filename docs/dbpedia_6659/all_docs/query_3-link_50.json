        "text": "Synopsis\n\nThe events of the first section of The Sound and the Fury take place some 17 years after Caddy’s departure. The first section is notoriously difficult to read: its narrator, Benjy, has an intellectual disability. The precise character of his disability is not known; he is sometimes called a “looney” or, more commonly, an “idiot.” Evidently, his disability affects his ability to speak (he communicates by “moaning”) and to reason. It also distorts his sense of time, such that he cannot distinguish between the past and the present. Benjy experiences all time as the present and thus narrates all events, including and especially memories of past events, as though they occur in the present. Unbeknownst to him, the events he narrates as “the present” actually span a 30-year period, from 1898 to 1928.\n\nBenjy’s section opens on April 7, 1928. In the first scene of the novel, Benjy and his caretaker, Luster, search for a lost quarter near a fenced golf course. Benjy, following Luster, climbs through a break in the fence and gets caught on a nail. The sensation reminds him of an earlier time (1902) when Caddy uncaught him and led him through the fence. This memory provokes another: Benjy remembers visiting a cemetery to see the graves of his father and brother (1912 or 1913). A nearby golfer’s call for his “caddie” recalls more memories of Caddy; Benjy remembers Caddy’s wedding (1910) and Caddy’s leaving (1911) and also the sight of Caddy’s muddy underwear on the day of his grandmother’s funeral (1898).\n\nIn the present action, Benjy and Luster return to the Compson house. There they see Caddy’s daughter, Miss Quentin, embracing a boy on a swing. Benjy remembers seeing Caddy embracing a boy on the same swing, some time ago (1908 or 1909). For a moment, mother and daughter become indistinguishable to Benjy; then, Miss Quentin sees and snaps at him. As Benjy enters the Compson house, his thoughts turn to his castration several years earlier and to the events leading up to the loss of Caddy’s virginity (1909). His section ends in his room, 30 years before it began, with the memory of Caddy holding him on the night she muddied her underwear (1898).\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Although Quentin has no intellectual disability, Quentin’s section, like Benjy’s, oscillates between the past and the present. The actions of the present (here, 1910) are Quentin’s as he prepares to commit suicide. Quentin’s preparations are partly practical and partly symbolic: they include breaking his grandfather’s watch, packing up his belongings, writing letters to his loved ones, purchasing weights (two six-pound flatirons) with which to drown himself, and visiting the nearby Charles River Bridge, where he will eventually commit suicide.\n\nQuentin’s present actions are set against his memories of key events in his life, most of which involve Caddy or Caddy’s lovers. A few memories predominate: the memory of the night Caddy lost her virginity to Dalton Ames (1909); the memory of his confrontation with Dalton upon the discovery of Caddy’s pregnancy (1909); the memory of his meeting Caddy’s fiancé, the banker Sydney Herbert Head, whom Caddy marries (1910) despite her pregnancy by another man; and the memory of a conversation with his father, in which Quentin claimed he committed incest with his sister, though he did not (1910). It is implied that Quentin’s memories—and these four in particular—compel his suicide. Quentin’s suicide is not narrated; his section ends as he walks out of his dorm.\n\nThe third section of The Sound and the Fury returns to Yoknapatawpha County in the year 1928. This section—Jason’s section—is set one day before the first, on April 6, 1928. Unlike the previous two, Jason’s section is straightforward and, for the most part, linear: it chronicles his present activities and interactions, both at the Compson house and the farm-supply store where he works. The focal point of his narration is his 17-year-old niece, Miss Quentin, who, as Jason describes her, is very much like her mother: headstrong, rebellious, and promiscuous. Jason disdains Miss Quentin (and she him)—and yet he relies on her for money. Each month Caddy sends Miss Quentin a $200 check, which Jason intercepts and keeps for himself. For nearly 15 years Jason has kept up this scheme undiscovered—until April 6, 1928, when Caddy sends a money order (requiring a signature) in place of a check, and Miss Quentin, at last, learns about her uncle’s subterfuge. Still, Jason withholds the money.\n\nThe fourth section of the novel picks up on April 8, 1928, two days after Jason’s section and one day after Benjy’s. The fourth section is narrated in the third-person and focuses primarily on Dilsey, the Compsons’ black servant. On the morning of April 8, the author-narrator observes Dilsey performing her chores, as usual, in the Compson house. As she prepares breakfast, Dilsey talks to Luster, who tells her that someone broke into Jason’s bedroom the night before. Moments later, it is discovered that Miss Quentin not only broke Jason’s window but entered his bedroom, found her mother’s money, stole it back, and fled the house. Jason, furious, goes to chase her but ultimately fails to catch her.\n\nIn Jason’s absence, Dilsey, Luster, and Benjy attend Easter service at Dilsey’s church. The visiting minister preaches about redemption, and Dilsey, thinking of the Compsons and the events of the morning, begins to cry. She reflects: “I’ve seed de first en de last….I seed de beginning, en now I sees de endin.” Dilsey’s words foretell the end of the novel: soon after, Faulkner brings it to an uneventful, inconclusive close.\n\nAn appendix to the novel, published in 1946, details the fates of the surviving Compsons. According to the appendix, Benjy was committed to an asylum in 1933; Jason moved into an apartment above the supply-store; and Caddy moved to Paris, where she lived at the time of the German occupation of France (1940–44). Neither Caddy nor her daughter returned to Yoknapatawpha County.\n\nContext and analysis\n\nThe Sound and the Fury was written (and is set) in the postbellum American South, in the period after Reconstruction (1865–77). At this critical moment in American history, the South was in the process of redefining itself and its values in the absence of slavery. Certain Southern families (typically old landed families) refused to participate in this process. Instead, they turned inward; they clung to their traditions and values—to vague notions of honour, purity, and virginity.\n\nThe Sound and the Fury documents the decline of these families. The Compsons, as Faulkner casts them, are direct descendants of the planter-aristocrats. They are the inheritors of their values and traditions, on whom the survival (or ultimate extinction) of this Southern aristocracy depends. The Compsons, for the most part, shirk this responsibility. Quentin, however, does not. The burden of the past falls heavily upon Quentin, who, as the eldest son, feels he must preserve and protect the Compson family honour. Quentin identifies his sister as the principal bearer of the honour he is to protect. When he fails to protect that honour—that is, when Caddy loses her virginity to Dalton Ames and becomes pregnant—Quentin elects to commit suicide. Quentin’s suicide, in conjunction with Caddy’s pregnancy, precipitates the fall of the Compson family. Still, for nearly two decades, the family survives. Its death knell is tolled on April 8, 1928, by Miss Quentin, who “swung herself by a rainpipe” to the locked window of her uncle’s bedroom, took her mother’s money, “climbed down the same rainpipe in the dusk,” and vanished, taking with her not only the money but the last semblance of the Compson family honour. At the end of the novel, the Compson family is in ruins and, on a larger scale, the Southern aristocracy is too.\n\nThe Sound and the Fury’s form is distinctly Modernist: Faulkner employs a number of narrative techniques, including unreliable narrators, interior monologues, and unconventional syntax, that are recurrent features of literary Modernism. Faulkner’s conception of time, particularly as expressed in his nonlinear representation of time, is a cause of disagreement among scholars, who argue over which different philosophies influenced Faulkner and to what extent. A number of scholars, for example, have made the case for a link between Faulkner’s conception of time and the theory of duration formulated by French philosopher Henri Bergson. Such an argument places Faulkner among a number of Modernist writers influenced by Bergson, including Joseph Conrad, Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, and T.S. Eliot. The title of Faulkner’s novel alone expresses Faulkner’s concern with time. The Sound and the Fury takes its name from a soliloquy given by the title character of William Shakespeare’s play Macbeth. In that soliloquy, Macbeth reflects on time and the meaninglessness of life:\n\nTomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow\n\nCreeps in this petty pace from day to day\n\nTo the last syllable of recorded time.\n\nAnd all our yesterdays have lighted fools\n\nThe way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle.\n\nLife’s but a walking shadow, a poor player\n\nThat struts and frets his hour upon the stage\n\nAnd then is heard no more: it is a tale\n\nTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,\n\nSignifying nothing.\n\nMacbeth’s words echo throughout The Sound and the Fury, and some scholars have noted that they are made literal through the three Compson brothers: Benjy is the “idiot” to whom Macbeth refers; Quentin, the “walking shadow” who “frets his hour” and then “is heard no more”; and Jason, the “poor player,” full of “fury.”"
