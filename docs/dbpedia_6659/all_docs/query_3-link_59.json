It doesn't seem possible to get subtitles for German, but not English.\n\nI also have the Blu-ray, but I haven't tried it, yet.\n\nI suspect this is related to the player not recognizing forced subtitles. I've noticed that subtitles aren't always handled properly on multi-language films.\n\nI've done that, but it still doesn't work correctly. I have \"Show English subtitles when the audio is not English\" selected. The problem is that the audio track is English, so the player selects no subtitles and the German-speaking scenes also have no subtitles.\n\nI just tried out the \"Play Disc\" option from the Blu-ray disc. Using the disc menu, the default is the English audio track and no subtitles. When the German-speaking scenes come on, English subtitles are displayed, even though subtitles are turned off.\n\nMost likely, there are \"Forced subtitles\" flags on the English subtitle track that are being properly recognized with the \"Play Disc\" option, but ignored with the \"Play Movie\" option.\n\nI had similar issue and support had me do the following settings in language.\n\nMy preferred language is English\n\nMovie Audio\n\nI prefer to hear movies in their original language.\n\nSubtitles & Closed Captions\n\nShow English subtitles when the audio is not English."
