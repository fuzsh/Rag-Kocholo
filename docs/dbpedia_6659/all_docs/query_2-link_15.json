Pine-laden lemon peel &amp; grapefruit on the nose with hints of caramel &amp; a slight haze from the hops. Gorgeous lacing. Unfiltered &amp; partially bottle-conditioned, the palate is all resinous, oily hops with creme brûlée-like threads. Finish",

As his farewell gift I decided to buy, online, a selection of beers from the Beer Library.\n\nOnline purchasing was a breeze with the ability to select products by style with current stock levels and quantity of purchase options in some cases.\n\nI was emailed that the collection of my dozen or so beers was available after only a couple of hours. All were chilled when collected.\n\nAll in all a great experience for online purchase and collection"
