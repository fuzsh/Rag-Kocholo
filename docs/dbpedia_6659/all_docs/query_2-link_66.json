        "text": "The UK will provide \"vital military assets\" to help a Nato mission tackling people smugglers in the Aegean Sea, David Cameron has said.\n\nThe PM said the amphibious landing ship RFA Mounts Bay would be sent, ahead of an emergency EU summit in Brussels.\n\nThe ship, which carries a Wildcat helicopter, will be working alongside three UK Border Force boats.\n\nMore than a million migrants entered the EU illegally by boat travelling mainly from Turkey to Greece last year.\n\nRFA Mounts Bay and two Border Force patrol boats, known as cutters, will join naval vessels from Germany, Canada, Turkey and Greece as part of Nato's first intervention in the migrant crisis.\n\nThe vessels will identify smugglers taking migrants to Greece and pass the information to the Turkish coastguard so it can intercept the boats and take the migrants back to Turkey.\n\nThe EU has pledged â¬3bn (Â£2.3bn; $3.3bn) to Turkey in return for housing migrants and stemming the flow.\n\nSome 13,000 are stranded on Greece's border with Macedonia as European states seek to restrict entry.\n\nRFA Mounts Bay would begin the operation in the \"coming days\", the cutter Protector was on its way to the region and a further cutter was expected to join them later this month, the government said, external.\n\nAnother Border Force boat, VOS Grace, is already in the Aegean Sea, between Greece and Turkey.\n\nCrisis explained in seven charts\n\nIn pictures: Life in Greek refugee camp\n\nKey migrant crisis questions answered\n\nMr Cameron said the Nato mission was important as it aimed to \"break the business model of the criminal smugglers\" and \"stop the desperate flow of people crammed into makeshift vessels\".\n\n\"It's an opportunity to stop the smugglers and send out a clear message to migrants contemplating journeys to Europe that they will be turned back,\" he said.\n\nOn his arrival at the summit, Mr Cameron said the UK's opt-out from the Schengen agreement meant there was \"no prospect\" of Britain joining any new EU asylum system.\n\n\"Even outside the EU, we'd be affected by a migration crisis like this,\" he said.\n\n\"But at the end of the day, we maintain our borders in our own way of doing things, because we have the best of both worlds.\""
