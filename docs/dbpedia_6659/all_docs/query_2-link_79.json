Breathtaking scenery and a wide variety of trophy size fish “lure” anglers to the area year after year. Just up the river at the mouth of eastern Lake Ontario, expect to reel in trophy-size lake trout, king salmon and walleye. The St. Lawrence River is known for its bountiful catches of muskie, northern pike, bass, and perch. Fishing services abound in the region with an abundance of marinas, boat launches, guides and bait/tackle shops. With their proven knowledge and expertise, local guides and charters assure a successful outing for any angler.\n\nWorld renowned for trophy muskie fishing, the 1000 Islands is a place where not only do you have a shot at landing the big one but there’s a shot at landing a world record. In the last few years fisherman have been recording record catches.\n\nA new “live release” World Record Muskie was caught just 3 miles from Horseblock Point (1 mile from the Glen House Resort)! Fisherman Dale MacNair was trolling the 40 Acres when he caught a 65-pound female Muskie – 57 inches in length and with a girth of 33 inches. The healthy monster was released within a matter of minutes, so that other fishermen may enjoy the thrill of catching her next season. Way to go, Dale, and thanks for releasing her!\n\nFishing License Information\n\nDOCKAGE (CHARGES APPLY)\n\nThe resort has two main docking areas: our main dock, located directly in front of the lodge/dining room, and our west-end dock.\n\nThe Main Dock:\n\nIs for reserved dockage spaces for our house guests and also to accommodate golfers and dinner guests arriving by personal water craft for day use only.
