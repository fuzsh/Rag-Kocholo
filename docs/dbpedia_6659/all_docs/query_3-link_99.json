        "text": "The film begins with 12-year-old Randy Daytona, a ping-pong prodigy competing in the 1988 Seoul Olympics against a rather obnoxious adult East German competitor, Karl Wolfschtagg (Thomas Lennon). Before the match, Randy learns that his father Sgt Pete Daytona (Robert Patrick) has placed a large bet on the game’s outcome with a Chinese Triad crime lord and ping-pong fanatic called Feng (Christopher Walken). Unfortunately, Randy loses the match when he runs into a guard barrier and knocks himself unconscious, and as a result, Randy’s father is murdered by the Triad.\n\nNineteen years later, an overweight Randy (Dan Fogler) is earning his living performing ping-pong tricks in a third rate restaurant when he is paid a visit by FBI agent Ernie Rodriguez (George Lopez). The FBI wants Randy to infiltrate Feng’s crime organisation via a prestigious underworld ping-pong tournament organised by Feng. However, Randy’s game is not what it used to be, and to bring his game up to scratch the FBI introduce Randy to Master Wong (James Hong), a blind ping-pong master, and his niece Maggie (Maggie Q), a ping-pong master in her own right.\n\nAfter beating a local champion named The Dragon, a 12-year-old school girl, Randy receives an invite to compete in Mr. Feng’s grand tournament. Randy, Wong and FBI agent Rodriguez board a bus and end up at Feng’s secret base somewhere in central America. Randy learns that the tournament involves games of sudden-death where the loser gets a poison dart in the neck. Randy manages to survive all his matches and move up the ranks to finally face his old rival Karl Wolfschtagg."
