        "text": "First encounter with Rushdie\n\nThis is the first of Rushdie's books I have read and it did not disappoint. Rushdie is also one of those rare authors who reads beautifully. He has full mastery of the English language. His narrative is full of physical discription, literary and cultural allusions, deep insite into character and somehow he packs all of that into a single paragraph. The sound and smell of the streets come alive and he is simultaneously touching one with deep emotion. It is , at times, dizzying, like being in a jam pack museum and at times not knowing where to look for all the splendor.\n\nThe story itself is set, mainly, in New York City in the year 2000. Given the setting and the title I suspected that 9/11 was going to be part of the novel. It wasn't. The main character is an Englishman of Indian decent, a philosophy professor who became world famous for a TV program produced by the BBC in which the character created by the professor, \"Little Brain\", takes on the great philosophers with guile and cutting wit. Little Brain and the other characters in the program are dolls or puppets that the professor has made himself. Little Brain herself is a sort of punk rock badass intellectual whose biting humor and deep insites disarm these great philosophers. As the TV show grows in popularity, he sees his characters taken over by the TV producers and morphed into something he despises. This brings on a Psychological break and with his new found wealth he abandons his wife and child for reasons revealed later.\n\nWhile in New York he begins to indulge himself with liasons with a beautiful neighbor who \"fixes\" people. He encounters other women as well. But all the time checking in weekly with his abandoned wife and child whom he still loves deeply. Throughout the story he faces the three Furies of Greek mythology in the person of various women. Those Furies being, “Unceasing Anger”, “Avenger of Murder”, and “Jealousy”.\n\nI've never read anything quite like it. It is hard work at times but not a labor, as the hard work pays rich rewards. It is not a book for everyone, because many don't like the heavy lifting required, but for me is was an absolute joy."
