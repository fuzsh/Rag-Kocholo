        "text": "South Africans have condemned Irish airline Ryanair for making them take a test in the Afrikaans language on UK flights, calling it discriminatory.\n\nThe country has 11 official languages, and many say they cannot understand Afrikaans - a language which was imposed during white-minority rule.\n\nThe quiz contains questions on South African general knowledge.\n\nRyanair defended the test, saying it weeds out those travelling on fraudulent South African passports.\n\n\"Due to the high prevalence of fraudulent South African passports, we require passengers travelling to the UK to fill out a simple questionnaire issued in Afrikaans,\" it said in a statement.\n\n\"If they are unable to complete this questionnaire, they will be refused travel and issued with a full refund,\" the airline continued.\n\nA South African man who was flying from Lanzarote to London in May said he was \"shocked\" when Ryanair took away his passport and boarding pass before presenting him with the Afrikaans test.\n\nWhen Dinesh Joseph protested, Ryanair staff told him: \"This is your language,\" he said.\n\n\"I was seething, I felt really triggered... there was a sense of anxiety and anger inside of me,\" Mr Joseph told the BBC's Newshour programme.\n\n\"It's callous and insensitive to force people to write a test which would evoke so much emotion around it - the language of apartheid was Afrikaans,\" Mr Joseph continued, saying he felt \"oppressed\" and insisting that speaking Afrikaans has nothing to do with how South African someone is.\n\nThere is also anger online.\n\nOne person online described Ryanair's policy as \"bigoted rubbish\".\n\nAnother person told Ryanair that South Africa is \"no longer in Apartheid\". \"Educate yourselves\", the tweeter continued.\n\nOnly around 13% of South Africans speak Afrikaans as a first language, according to a 2011 census - making it the country's third-most spoken mother tongue, after Zulu and IsiXhosa.\n\nThe BBC asked Ryanair why they required the test to be taken in Afrikaans rather than any other South African language, but the company did not answer.\n\nThe test is not required by UK border authorities.\n\nThe quiz, which one report says is riddled with grammatical and spelling errors, contains questions such as what is South Africa's international dialling code, what is its capital city and who is the current president of the country.\n\nConrad Steenkamp, the head of South Africa's Afrikaans Language Board, described it as \"absurd\" and said it had hindered attempts to improve the image of the Afrikaans language.\n\n'I would have failed this test'\n\nAnalysis by Nomsa Maseko, BBC News, Johannesburg\n\nSouth Africa's black majority views Afrikaans as an unfriendly language of the oppressor - or even a language of white racists - as it was forced down their throats at local schools. Black South Africans revolted against this.\n\nThe 16 June 1976 Soweto Uprising is one of a number of violent protests in which thousands of black children from South African township schools took to the streets to protest against the introduction of Afrikaans as a language of instruction.\n\nThe last time I spoke or wrote anything in that language was in high school.\n\nIt was a second language in former white schools and as students we had to get good Afrikaans marks to progress to the next grade.\n\nAs a result of this I swore to never speak Afrikaans again after I left high school and went to university. I blocked the language out of my mind.\n\nSo this questionnaire brought back memories of my schooling days. I would have failed this test and only got five questions right.\n\nA South African foreign affairs spokesperson did not want to get involved in the row.\n\n\"It's a Home Affairs matter. Also, it was done by a private airline not the UK government. Our understanding is that that airline has since stopped the practice,\" Clayson Monyela told the BBC.\n\nHowever, in an email to the BBC on Monday morning, Ryanair made no mention of ceasing the test.\n\nWhy Afrikaans is so controversial:\n\nDuring apartheid, or white-minority rule, Afrikaans was made mandatory, and an official language of education, alongside English, prompting nationwide protests by black South Africans\n\nIt is no longer obligatory but is an option in schools\n\nIt is the mother tongue of only 13% of South Africans, mainly mixed-race people, known as coloureds, and white South Africans - the descendants of Dutch, German and French settlers who arrived in the 17th Century\n\nMore will be able to understand it but many cannot, and speak one of the 11 other official languages\n\nEnglish is the language most commonly used officially and in business, according to South Africa's 2011 census\n\nSome reports say it applies to all Ryanair's European flights, while others say it applies to those just on UK and Ireland routes.\n\nIn 2021, the university announced its recommitment to a multilingual language policy, including Afrikaans, English and isiXhosa."
