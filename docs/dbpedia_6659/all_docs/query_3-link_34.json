Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.\n\nCopyright Â© 2024 The Apache Software Foundation, Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.\n\nApache, the names of Apache projects, and the feather logo are either registered trademarks or trademarks of the Apache Software Foundation in the United States and/or other countries."
