        "text": "A man, Dragon, practices martial arts poses at the beach.\n\nA flag flies.\n\nA banner with text in Mandarin.\n\nIn front of a group of people, Okimura slaps a man repeatedly in the face.\n\nYou dare compare yourselves with us huh?\n\nThe stricken man along with a large group of men struggle to control themselves to attack Okimura.\n\nDragon stands in front of the crowd clutching a handful of sticks.\n\nAn individual may be weak, but unity is strength. Why do we let the Japanese insist? Why sit back and let them terrorise us? Why not unite and fight them?\n\nThe men look and each other and nod.\n\n-Right. - Yeah.\n\nA woman spins round and kicks a block of wood in half. She then kicks a second one and screams.\n\nOkimura laughs.\n\nI kill Chinese just like I kill dogs. Your lives are worthless and if you disobey me, you're as good as dead.\n\nMiss Lee, a young woman, looks on disapprovingly.\n\nThat's garbage.\n\nOkimura looks at her.\n\nGet this, the Japanese are the best. Explain the name of this school. Just what does Ching Wu mean?\n\nMiss Lee calmly responds.\n\nI'll tell you. Ching, that means unity. Wu means resistance.\n\nDragon stands shirtless in front of the crowd of men, addressing them all.\n\nListen, if anyone wants to join the Ching Wu school come with me.\n\nA man steps forward and takes off his jacket.\n\nI do!\n\nDramatic music plays.\n\nA procession walks down a city street. Japanese flags fly. A caption reads: 1972\n\nDragon holds a wooden banner with Mandarin text.\n\nA caption reads: Ang rocked the world with Fist of Fury\n\nA caption reads: Now 1976\n\nThe procession led by Dragon walk through a large gate.\n\nA caption reads: Director Lo Wei\n\nMiss Lee and a group of men sitting on some steps rise to welcome them.\n\nA caption reads: Brings you New!\n\nDragon gets closer. A hopeful look appears on Miss Lee's face.\n\nA caption reads: New Fist of Fury\n\nA blurry image sharpens to a still image of Bruce Lee.\n\nDragon continues to walk with his banner.\n\nA caption reads: Director Lo Wei\n\nA caption reads: Brought you... Bruce Lee\n\nA caption reads: New Fist of Fury\n\nA caption reads: With the new and sensational Jacky Chan\n\nDragon stands while men in a circle threaten to attack him.\n\nThey each try to attack him and he fends them off with kicks.\n\nTwo of them grab his arms so he flips forward sending them both flying. He continues to kick and defend himself.\n\nAll of the men grab him to stop him. Dragon spins round with a kick to knock them all away.\n\nTwo different men are engaged in a fight. One stands on the other then flips over.\n\nHe defends an attack from the man then throws him to one side and attempts a double footed kick which lands on the man's shoulder.\n\nA woman, Okimura's daughter, screams and leaps up with a kick as she attacks a man in a dojo.\n\nA caption reads: Tae-kwan Do Exrert Cheng Siu Siu\n\nShe kicks the man repeatedly until he falls over.\n\nShe then tries to attack Dragon who lies on his stomach on the floor. She attempts to stomp on him but Dragon edges away each time.\n\nDragon turns over and kicks her in the face.\n\nA watching Okimura gets involved.\n\nTwo men fight. One has the other's arm trapped and throws him to the ground. Dragon then delivers an elbow drop on the fallen man's chest.\n\nMiss Lee watching looks distressed.\n\nDragon!\n\nDragon still has his elbow on the man's chest. The man has blood spilling from his mouth.\n\nA caption reads: And Bruce Lee's Co-star Nora Miao\n\nMiss Lee jumps up and kicks two men.\n\nOkimura dressed only in a loin cloth fights against a man.\n\nA caption reads: Starring Chan Sing\n\nAt night, an army marches.\n\nA caption reads: New Fist of Fury\n\nOkimura, in the dojo, looks shocked and angry\n\nI'll kill you!\n\nA caption reads: Jacky Chan\n\nDragon grimaces then runs toward Okimura yelling.\n\nA caption reads: Director Lo Wei's New Fist of Fury\n\nDragon tries to punch Okimura but is stopped by a group of men.\n\nHe throws them all aside and it freeze frames on that image."
