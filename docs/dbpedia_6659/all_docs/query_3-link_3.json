        "text": "The Flemish Belgian education minister Pascal Smet riled his French-speaking colleagues by labelling English “the world’s most important language”.\n\nMr Smet’s remarks yesterday sparked anger among French speakers in Belgium.\n\nHe insisted: “We have to admit European integration does not always go as smoothly as it should. One of the causes is that we don’t speak a common language – and that’s why I want to launch this idea. It seems logical to me to give more weight to English in education, maybe as early as from primary school.\n\n“China introduced English as the second language two years ago. From an economic and political point of view, it’s the world’s most important language. And it’s also the common language in many companies.”\n\nBut the French community’s education spokeswoman Marie-Dominique Simonet hit back: “These unfortunate remarks are hardly going to help improve relations between the Flemish and French speakers in this country.”\n\nAnd a leading French-Belgian political website said: “It is high time the Flemish stopped trying to dictate who speaks which language – and to stop trying to create a hierarchy of languages.”\n\nFeuding between the two communities has threatened to break-up the country in to separate French and Flemish- speaking governments.\n\nTeaching English in schools in Flanders would reduce the use of French in those areas.\n\nFrench speakers in Europe have been battling for years to promote their language over English.\n\nThey tried three years ago for it to be the sole language for all EU legal documents, claiming that it was “more precise”.\n\nMr Smet’s bombshell came on the European Day of Languages, sparking accusations of bad timing. But Mr Smet was unrepentant, insisting: “I chose today, not for political reasons. Let’s not forget French will remain important as the ‘third’ language at school.”\n\nTHE European Commission has just announced an agreement whereby English will be the official language of the European Union rather than German, which was the other possibility.\n\nAs part of negotiations, the British Government conceded English spelling had room for improvement and has accepted a five-year phase-in plan that would become known as Euro-English.\n\nIn the first year, ‘s’ will replace the soft ‘c’.Sertainly, this will make the sivil servants jump with joy.\n\nThe hard ‘c’ will be dropped in favour of ‘k’. This should klear up konfusion, and keyboards kan have one less letter.\n\nThere will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year when the troublesome ‘ph’ will be replaced with ‘f’.\n\nEXPRESS OFFER: CLAIM £15 IN FREE BETS HERE!\n\nThis will make words such as fotograf 20 per cent shorter. In the third year, publik akseptanse of new spellings kan be expekted to reach a stage where komplikated changes are possible.\n\nGovernments will enkourage the removal of double letters which have always ben a deterent to akurate speling.\n\nAlso, al wil agre that the horibl mes of the silent ‘e’ in the languag is disgrasful and it should go away.\n\nBy the fourth yer, people wil be reseptiv to steps such as replasing ‘th’ with ‘z’ and ‘w’ with ‘v’.\n\nDuring ze fifz yer, ze unesesary ‘o’ kan be dropd from vords kontaining ‘ou’ and after ziz fifz yer, ve vil hav a reil sensibl riten styl.\n\nZer vil be no mor trubl or difikultis and evrivun vil find it ezi tu understand ech oza.
