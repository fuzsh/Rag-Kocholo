        "text": "The term \"pound\" in this instance means to pulsate or throb. The sentence could have been written:\n\n\"He felt ... fury ... throb through his body\".\n\nor\n\n\"He felt ... fury ... pulse through his body\".\n\nWe often refer to blood \"pounding\" in a person's veins when a person is angry or fearful, because of the faster and harder heartbeat that is created by anger or fear. The sentence above has an implied or sub-textual reference to a pounding heart or blood pounding through the veins of the person who is experiencing fury.\n\nSee definition of verb \"to pound\".\n\nYou parsed it in error. It's not\n\n(not) felt (not) a fury (not) that is not his own pound (not) through his body\n\nThe noun is not \"pound\" being modified by \"fury\".\n\nIt is \"fury\" being modified by \"pound\".\n\nfelt a fury that is not his own pound through his body\n\n\"Pound\" is what the fury is doing. It's an action. Note that two phrases are modifying \"fury\": \"that is not his own\" and \"pound\".\n\nIf we simplify the sentence as much as possible by removing modifying phrases (except pound), we get\n\nHe saw a shadow and felt a fury pound.\n\nOr simpler,\n\nHe saw a shadow and felt a fury.\n\n\"pound\" is a verb form of \"to pound\" here. It is the same construct as \"I felt a bee sting me\". The core part means \"He felt a fury pound through his body, a fury that was not his own\". I'd use \"rush\" instead of \"pound\" here maybe, because furies tend not to move in one's body in much of a pounding manner.\n\nThe answer by Harper provides an excellent technical analysis. For simplicity, the problem of comprehension can also be resolved by the minimal use of punctuation for clarification: \"He saw a large shadow and felt a fury that was not his own, pound through his body\".\n\nI have done work translating German technical documents into English. As a result, I would not want to translate an English document into German."
