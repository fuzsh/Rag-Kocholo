        "text": "The Young and the Restless fans have something to celebrate because Christel Khalil is back playing Lily Winters on the hit CBS soap.\n\nChristel and Lily have been MIA since December, when Lily left to be near her daughter Mattie after a fire near her school.\n\nIt should be common knowledge now that Lily was written out so Christel could go on maternity leave.\n\nThe actress was expecting her second child, a son, in December.\n\nChristel has yet to announce the birth of her baby boy, which is not a surprise considering she keeps her personal life extremely private.\n\nWhat she has done, though, is revealed that sheâs back on the Y&R set with two of her favorite people.\n\nWhen will Christel Khalil be back on screen as Lily Winters on The Young and the Restless?\n\nThe other day, Christel took to her Instagram Stories to announce she had returned from maternity leave. Christel shared a backstage picture of her with Bryton James (Devon) and Eric Braeden (Victor).\n\nThere were smiles all around for the three, with Eric in the middle of the group hug. âBack at it!â was written on the photo as Christel let The Young and the Restless fans know she was filming again.\n\nThe news, of course, has sparked questions about when Lily will return to Genoa City. Since we donât know how long Christel has been back at work, her return date may fluctuate a bit.\n\nY&R films six weeks in advance, so if we go by when Christel shared the picture, Lily should resurface on-screen in mid-to-late March.\n\nHowever, Christel could have been filming days or even weeks before this was taken. That would mean if fans are lucky, Lily will pop back up before February sweeps end.\n\nAfter all, her return would be a great sweeps moment, considering Daniel (Michael Graziadei) cheated on Lily with Heather (Vail Bloom) and plans to dump Lily when sheâs back.\n\nWhat can Y&R fans expect when Lily returns to Genoa City?\n\nDanielâs newfound love for his ex-wife means Lily is headed for a heartbreak when she comes home. Unfortunately, that wonât be the only drama Lily has to deal with upon her return to Genoa City.\n\nThings have changed a lot at Chancellor-Winters since Lily left. Billy (Jason Thompson) and Chance (Conner Floyd) have joined the company at Jillâs (Jess Walton) urging.\n\nIn true Billy Boy fashion, heâs already shaking things up with his idea that Jillâs name should be added to the company title. The Young and the Restless spoilers tease that Devon and Billy clash, with all signs pointing to this being the issue.\n\nNate (Sean Dominic) is back in the Chancellor-Winters mix, too. Although Lily knew that was happening and signed off on his return, having Nate back will undoubtedly change the dynamic at the company, especially the more he conspires with Mamie (Veronica Redd).\n\nWhatever happens when Lilyâs back, hereâs hoping the writers have a juicy storyline coming for the character.\n\nChristel isnât the only fan favorite returning to the hit CBS soap. Mishael Morgan is also back as Amanda, and you can read all about her return here.\n\nThe Young and the Restless airs weekdays on CBS.\n\nncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWirn5a9tHvCoamiq6SauW63x5qjoqRdp7K1wdGnqmasn2LBqbGMsqauppdirq%2BwjK2fnmWimsC1uMSsqmaZo2K5qrjYZq6ipqSav7R51qGcp2WnnrmtedKhnGaalWKvoq%2FKZqanZaOYv6axzWg%3D"
