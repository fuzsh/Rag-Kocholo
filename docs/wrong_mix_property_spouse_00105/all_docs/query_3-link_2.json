        "meta_description": "A true California girl, Christel Khalil was born and bred in Los Angeles. She got into acting via her three older brothers, who often accompanied her to acting school. Eventually, Hensley’s mom enrolled her in a class, too. By the time she was 5, Hensley was out on the audition circuit and admits she never considered another career path. Hensley got her big break in 2002, when she landed the role of Lily on YOUNG AND RESTLESS, the very first soap opera she’d auditioned for. The gig garnered her two nominations for a Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a TV Series. She was also nominated for the Outstanding Younger Actress Daytime Emmy Award in 2004 and 2006, and she won the 2008 NAACP Image Award for outstanding actress in a daytime drama series. In addition to her soap work, Hensley starred in the feature film White Like the Moon and has had supporting roles in other movies, including Matilda and Dragon Fury. She’s also guest-starred on prime-time series and provided the voice of Cornelia Hale in the animated television series W.I.T.C.H. In her free time, Hensley enjoys singing, dancing and horseback riding. She also plays the drums.",
