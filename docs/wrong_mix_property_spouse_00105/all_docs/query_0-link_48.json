        "text": "‘The Young and the Restless’ star, Christel Khalil, has just shared with her fans that she is pregnant with her second child and her first with her current partner, Sam Restagno.\n\nY&R Star, Christel Khalil Shows Off Baby Bump\n\nKhalil recently took to social media to share video clips from the Monte Carlo Television Festival Awards, and it is obvious that she had fun. The series of video clips shows everyone smiling for the camera.\n\n‘The Young and the Restless’ Star, Christel Khalil (Lily Winters) is Pregnant with Her Second Baby\n\nSpotted in some of the videos are other cast members, including Melody Thomas Scott, Bryton James, Amelia Heinle, and many others. She captioned the video with “That’s a wrap on Monaco!\n\nThank you @festivaltvmonte_carlo for a great trip! Loved being there with this A team. Lots of laughs, blisters on our feet, and ate enough croissants to supply a bakery. See you next time.”\n\nHowever, that’s not the real gist. The big news is the baby bump that Khalil was spotting. How can we miss that? The Young and the Restless star is expecting another baby.\n\nKhalil did not announce her pregnancy, but fans saw her bump and they got really excited. They quickly took to her comment section to express their excitement.\n\nThey also mentioned how they were skeptical about her pregnancy with the way she was hiding her belly with purses and bags on the show.\n\nFellow cast member, Michelle Stafford (Phyllis Summers), also took to the comment section to write how she was so happy about the news. Fans and friends congratulated Khalil. However, she is yet to reveal her due date.\n\nChristel Khalil tied the knot with Stephen Hensley in 2008 but the duo split in 2011. They share a son together, Michael, whom they welcomed on April 17th, 2010.\n\nAfter the divorce, Khalil moved on to another relationship. However, she is currently dating Canadian businessman Sam Restagno, whom she is expecting her second child with."
