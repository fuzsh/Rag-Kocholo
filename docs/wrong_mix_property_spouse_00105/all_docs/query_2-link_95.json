        "text": "The Young and the Restless (Y&R) Spoilers show that Lily is back on the daytime soap. Christel Khalil has recently returned back to the Young and the Restless and resumed the role of Lily Winters. However, what made Christal return to the soap and resume her role there?\n\nCBS The Young and the Restless Spoilers – Christel Khalil Moves To Toronto\n\nLast year, Christel Khalil moved to Toronto, Canada, permanently with her son Michael Caden and her boyfriend, Sam Restago. Since then she has appeared on the show every now and then but was not there on a regular basis. Although, she has been considering making the move back to Los Angeles at least for the summer.\n\nThis seemed to be great news for the CO-Executive Producer/ Head Writer, Josh Griffith, wanted to bring the character of Lily back to the show but not just for a short stay, but instead, he wanted her to be on the show a little longer this time.\n\nChristel stated, “I happened to run into Josh in the hallway at Y&R shortly after New Year’s Day and he was like, ‘I have this really exciting storyline, I think you’ll love it. I was really excited. It’s like home there, so it was nice to even be thought of for a new storyline.”\n\nY&R Updates – Christel Khalil Loves New Storyline\n\nHowever, it seems that she did not mind returning even though she likes living in Toronto. “it’s been great, but I miss working and being on the show.” Since she and her boyfriend had already discussed going to L.A., it seemed to make sense for her to accept the offer.\n\n“Sam and I had talked about possibly moving back before Josh even approached me, so we were already on the same page with all of that. It kind of was kismet when I ran into Josh and we had that conversation. Sam was definitely supportive knowing that he’d have to do a lot more and watch Caden when he’s in school and stuff. I think we both care about making money [laughs].”\n\nKhalil is excited to be back playing the role of Lily, especially with the storyline that she is currently in. She says that she wanted Lily to be in this kind of storyline as it showed a female in power, and she wanted to work with Jason Thompson. “I was really excited. I mean, this is better just because Lily is the one calling the shots rather than following other people or being an employee. She is now the employer. It’s really cool.”\n\nAs of right now, she is not in L.A. but instead is in Toronto, however, she is still planning on moving here. “I’m back in Toronto with my family right now,” she shares. “We still have plans to move to L.A. this summer, although I don’t know when because of this whole drama. But it’ll be great to really be back full time.” Stick with the CBS soap, and don’t forget to check CTS often for the latest Young and the Restless spoilers, updates, and news.\n\nThe Young and the Restless Spoilers: Is Rey The Real Father of Mia & Arturo’s Son – Paternity Test Tampering Rocks Sharon’s World?"
