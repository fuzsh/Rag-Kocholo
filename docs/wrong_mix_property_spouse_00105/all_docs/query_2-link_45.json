        "text": "The cast and crew of “The Young and the Restless” will pay tribute Monday to late cast member Kristoff St. John, who played Neil Winters on the CBS soap for 28 years.\n\nKristoff died suddenly of hypertrophic heart failure on Feb. 3 at the age of 52.\n\n“Y&R” will remember St. John in an hourlong episode (12:30-1:30 p.m.) recalling his personality and impact on the long-running soap.\n\nActress Christel Khalil, who plays Neil’s daughter Lily Winters — and who appears on the tribute — says she heard the news about St. John when she returned home from a Super Bowl party. The last time she saw him was on the show’s set. “It was all very normal,” says Khalil, 31. “We had some laughs. Like every other day.”\n\nBecause soaps tape five episodes per week, their large casts spend more time together than actors on other TV series and their bond is very deep. Khalil can still remember her screen test with St. John when she auditioned for the role of Lily. She was 14.\n\n“It was down to me and four other girls. He came into our rooms to run lines and give us pointers,” Khalil says. “I didn’t realize how special that was. When I had my actual screen test, I had the best audition in my life. I attributed it to Kristoff.”\n\nThere were already several weeks worth of shows in the can when St. John died, but co-executive producer Josh Griffith had to write his star out of the show and celebrate his legacy with a tribute.\n\n“The shows with Neil’s death needed to come fairly soon after the news hit. We dedicated an entire week [of April episodes] to focus on that,” he says. “The ramifications throughout [the series fictitious location of] Genoa City affected everyone. We had everyone react to the shocking news and the aftermath.”\n\nOn Monday’s tribute, fans will see longtime stars of the show such as Eileen Davidson and Jess Walton as well as Michelle Morgan and St. John’s former co-stars Victoria Rowell and Shemar Moore, who filmed two “Y&R” episodes in one day so he could get back to work on the prime-time series “S.W.A.T.”\n\n“Shemar came in at 7 in the morning and was here until midnight,” Griffith says. “Everybody was on board. The hours were grueling but on top of that there was the emotion of being so close to [St. John]. It was draining.”\n\nQuickly producing post-mortem episodes for a departed cast member was something Griffith had done before — when Jeanne Cooper, who played Katherine Chancellor, died at age 84 in May 2013. “She was a workhorse right up to the end,” he says. “She worked the week before [she died]. We knew she had some issues, but there was nothing that indicated she had little time left. It was a surprise, but not a shock like Kristoff.”\n\nGriffith worked closely with the ‘Y&R’s post-production team to match appropriate footage with cast reminiscences of working with St. John on the set of the show. “It’s a very intimate, informal gathering of his colleagues,” he says. “In many ways, it was kind of their memorial service and quite cathartic for them. They could work though their grief by grieving for his character.”\n\nGriffith has already written scenes where several characters on the show are impacted by Neil’s will.\n\n“I knew that Kristoff would be very angry if I didn’t move the story forward with his death,” he says."
