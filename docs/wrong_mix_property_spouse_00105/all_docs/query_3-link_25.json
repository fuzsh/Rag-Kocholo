        "text": "Christel Khalil is back on The Young and the Restless as Lily after taking maternity leave late last year. The actress recently shared a big update about her newborn baby boy.\n\nNursery Reveal\n\nKhalil took to Instagram to give her followers a nursery reveal. ‚ÄúNursery reveal! So in love with the peaceful vibes for our baby Remy thanks to @babyletto! Check out the link in bio for these must-have items! #babylettoinspo #yuzucrib #yuzudresser,‚Äù wrote the new mother of two.\n\nKhalil started the reel, which is set to ‚ÄúSo This is Love‚Äù by Ilene Woods and Mike Douglas, by opening the door to the nursery. The new post also revealed her son‚Äôs name, Remy. In the video, she panned over to a bookshelf that also had letters on it spelling out his name. By the end of the clip, she straightened the curtains, took a seat in the gliding rocking chair near the window, and smiled.\n\nHer Y&R co-star Melissa Ordway (Abby) responded with a heart-eye emoji. Fans also quickly jumped in, offering their well wishes.\n\n‚ÄúOh joy, congratulations, on your new arrival of your üëë Prince!ü©µ‚Äù wrote one. Another replied, ‚ÄúCongratulations! You are glowing!! I love your son‚Äôs name Remy! ü©µ Welcome back to the show! üíù‚Äù\n\nSo far, Khalil hasn‚Äôt shared details of Remy‚Äôs birth, but with Lily‚Äôs return, it became clear she‚Äôd had her baby. Soap Hub congratulates the actress and her family on their newest addition."
