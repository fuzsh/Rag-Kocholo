        "text": "Soap Opera Digest: Who is your favorite actor?\n\nChristel Khalil: Meryl Streep. I loved her in Sophie’s Choice. Her accent was flawless. Just flawless.Digest: What’s your favorite TV show?\n\nKhalil: NIP/TUCK. I love that show.Digest: What is favorite comfort food?\n\nKhalil: Mashed potatoes. I love ’em. They’re so good. I like them creamy, with a lot of garlic. I love garlic.Digest: What’s your favorite article of clothing?\n\nKhalil: Jeans, because you can wear them with anything. You can dress them up or dress them down. They’re perfect.Digest: If you could live anywhere in the world, where would you choose?\n\nKhalil: Somewhere in Europe. I love everything about Europe. The cultures. The people. The cities. I haven’t been there yet, but I’m actually going to be going to Italy next summer for a film camp with my friends. That should be a lot of fun.Digest: Are you ever mistaken for another celebrity?\n\nKhalil: Yes. Jennifer Beals. A lot of people say I look like her. She’s the only one people have said.Digest: What’s your favorite subject in school?\n\nKhalil: Right now, it’s psychology. I’m taking it as an elective. I like learning about people and their behavior and development and how they progress.Digest: If you were not an actor, what would you be?\n\nKhalil: A veterinarian. I love animals. Even when I go to college, I’d love to study something like veterinary science, but I hate math and science. I’d love to study astronomy as well, but both require so much math and science, which is too bad [laughs].Digest: Do you have a favorite board game?\n\nKhalil: The game of Life. I love that game.Digest: What’s your favorite household chore?\n\nKhalil: I love doing dishes. I don’t know why, but I do. I think it’s fun.Digest: And your least-favorite?\n\nKhalil: Vacuuming. I hate vacuuming. My mother has this old vacuum that we’ve had for about 20 years. I’m not even joking. You know how new vacuums are light and you can pick them up easier? This one weighs at least 20 pounds. It puts more dirt on to the floor than it picks up because it’s so old. For some reason, she thinks it’s this great miracle vacuum. It’s hilarious.Digest: Who is your favorite Disney character?\n\nKhalil: Aladdin. I love Aladdin. He’s a hottie [laughs]. I’ve been told I could play Jasmine.Digest: What do you miss most about being a kid?\n\nKhalil: Getting away with things. As you get older, more is expected of you.Digest: Are you a morning person or a night person?\n\nKhalil: Night person. I feel more alive when it’s dark outside. And I hate waking up early.Digest: Which soap star from another show do you have a crush on?\n\nKhalil: I would say Greg Vaughan [Lucky, GENERAL HOSPITAL; ex-Diego, Y&R], who used to be on our show. He’s hot!Digest: What’s your favorite flower?\n\nKhalil: Hibiscus. I love them. They’re the Hawaiian state flower.Digest: Describe your first kiss.\n\nKhalil: It wasn’t anything special [laughs]. It was one of Lyndsy‘s [Fonseca, ex-Colleen] friends. I’m a slow bloomer. My first kiss was like a year ago. He came over to my house, and we were on the couch watching Cruel Intentions and then he kissed me. I don’t have some great love story or anything [laughs].Digest: What dating advice would you offer a friend?\n\nKhalil: I wouldn’t have much to give because the boyfriend I have is my first boyfriend, and I’ve never actually been on a date before. But I guess I would say just be yourself. You don’t want to become something you’re not because it will never work out.Digest: What’s your idea of a romantic date?\n\nKhalil: I would say going out to eat somewhere, then walking on the beach at night, watching the stars. I don’t like the beach during the day because I’m afraid of the ocean. I won’t go in it because I’m afraid sharks are going to come and eat me, and it’s so windy and sandy and flies are everywhere, so I don’t like the beach in the day, but I love it at night. It’s cold and you can bundle up in blankets.Digest: What super power would you want to have?\n\nKhalil: I would want to be able to fly, and be able to read people’s minds, although that would be depressing at times because you would hear things that maybe you shouldn’t have heard [laughs]."
