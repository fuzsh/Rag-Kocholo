        "text": "It’s been exactly 20 years since Christel Khalil came into the soap opera world as Lily Winters on the CBS show The Young and the Restless. And now the 34-year-old actress is recalling how “nervous” she was when she began as a teenager, as well as looking back on some of her most pivotal storylines.\n\nKhalil began her time as Lily, a rebellious teenager, in 2002, nearly 30 years after the show began its run. In an interview with TV Insider, the actress remembered her first scene with Victoria Rowell, who played her mother, Drucilla.\n\n“I remember being nervous and wanting to do a good job,” Khalil said. “My first few years, it was about introducing the character. I was a kid. I wasn’t quite old enough to be a part of the teen storylines.”\n\nOnce she was around 15 years old, Khalil did a chlamydia storyline with Greg Rikaart, who played Kevin Fisher, an abusive man Lily met on the internet with whom she fell in love and got chlamydia from. According to Khalil, she got her first Daytime Emmy nomination for the scenes where her character tells her parents about what happened with Kevin.\n\n“It was a great storyline and I think they did it really well,” Khalil said. “I remember doing PSAs after shooting scenes related to the chlamydia storyline.”\n\nWhile she didn’t win the Emmy for those scenes, she did go on to win the NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Daytime Drama Series in 2008 and the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series in 2012.\n\nAnother big storyline for Lily was when she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer, something Khalil says she did a lot of research on.\n\n“What would the symptoms be, how would a person feel,” she said. “I relied on the writers and focused on how I would feel. I wore a bald cap on my head [when Lily lost her hair]. They’d make it match my skin. I’d wear a head scarf and later, a wig.”\n\nFans of the actress (and her character) took to Twitter to comment on a tribute the show’s page posted for her two decades of service to the soap opera.\n\nOne wrote, “Thank you for 20 years, of joy and tears. You’ve literally crushed every scene written for you.”\n\nAnother said, “Your character is one of the reasons I got hooked on this show. Keep up the great work!” while someone else commented, “You make it easy on us, the fans. You are one of my favorites. You always do an amazing job.”\n\nAs for the future of the long-running show, Khalil says she hopes they “can keep everyone interested.”\n\nThe Young and the Restless airs weekdays at 12:30 p.m. ET on CBS."
