        "text": "Young and the Restless (Y&R) spoilers imply that fans may want to brace themselves for a plot twist. Actress Christel Khalil, who plays Lily Winters on the soap, recently announced her pregnancy. Could her character follow suit?\n\nThe Young And The Restless Spoilers – Lily Winters Has Been Getting Busy With Daniel Romalotti\n\nY&R spoilers for the summer reveal that Lily and Daniel Romalotti (Michael Graziadei) will continue to go strong in the months ahead. Could a baby be in their future? As the two have been intimate multiple times, there is a chance. In fact, anything is possible in the land of Genoa City!\n\nWith that being said, the actress announced her pregnancy on social media, sharing some videos and photos from her recent trip to the Monte Carlo TV Festival Awards event. One photo showed her standing sideways, revealing her baby bump. No information on how far along Khalil is, what the gender of her little one may be, or her expected due date.\n\nY&R Spoilers – Could The Show “Hide” Khalil’s Pregnancy?\n\nAs there are so many unknowns right now, it’s hard to say if the soap’s writers will concoct a storyline where Lily ends up pregnant. After all, her co-star Melissa Claire Egan also announced her pregnancy some months ago, yet her character Chelsea Lawson is not expecting, despite being in a relationship with Billy Abbott (Jason Thompson).\n\nKhalil and her fiancé Sam Restago, a Canadian businessman, seem very excited about the new bundle of joy they are expecting. Christel is the mother of a 13-year-old boy from a past marriage to musician Stephen Hensley. The two were wed in 2008, their son was born in 2010, and they split up in 2011. She met Restagno in the summer of 2018, and the two got engaged in the spring of 2022."
