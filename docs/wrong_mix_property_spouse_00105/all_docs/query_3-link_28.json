        "text": "For those of us regular folks, looking at a celebrity’s social media pages gives us an insight into their lives. A little peek at how they spend their time outside of the work that we see them do on a television or movie screen. But for some of those celebrities, posting details about their lives on social media platforms can be exhausting. And even anxiety-inducing!\n\nSuch was the case with THE YOUNG & THE RESTLESS star Christel Khalil (Lily), who has been rather quiet on Instagram since she made her last post in February. But on July 8, the Emmy winner returned to the social media platform, posting a beautiful candid shot of her and longtime beau Sam Restagno sitting on the grass with smiles on their faces as she shared some honest and heartfelt words about why she’d been absent.\n\n“I have to be honest, I had to take a break from the ‘Gram because I was feeling overwhelmed with feeling like I always had to say something, post something, or ‘use my platform’ for specific reasons and it became everything I am not about,” the Y&R actress wrote. “I found myself scrolling aimlessly, feeling badly about myself from seeing what other people were doing and everything I wasn’t doing.”\n\nThat need to keep up with the Joneses, as the old idiom goes, began to take its toll on the actress. “I think social media can be great in some ways and toxic in other ways depending on your perspective,” she mused. “I know I’m not saying anything new here, but I have to remind myself that these are just highlights.”\n\nTo bring her experiences on social media back around to something that puts a smile on her face, Khalil shared the romantic photo of her sitting in Restagno’s arms, both of them barefoot in the grass as he enjoyed a glass of white wine and they shared a secret laugh. “This picture depicts an amazing highlight in my life with my man who is my everything and brings so much joy to my heart,” Khalil admitted. “But what it doesn’t show, are all the dark moments I also have experienced and have had to persevere through.\n\n“So, here’s to posting a highlight, to remind myself that life is beautiful, impermanent, and shouldn’t be taken for granted,” she concluded.\n\nWe couldn’t have said it better ourselves!"
