        "text": "As previously reported, Christel Khalil is back taping at “The Young and the Restless” as Lily Winters, and now we finally know when she’ll officially be back in Genoa City!\n\nWhen we last saw Lily, she rushed out of town in December to be with her daughter Mattie, who had been among several (fictional) Standford University students trapped on campus by a wildfire that surrounded them. The storyline was written to explain Khalil’s absence as she had gone on maternity leave in real life after revealing in a June 2023 Instagram post that she was pregnant with her second child, her first with fiancé Sam Restagno — Khalil also has a son, Michael Caden, from a previous relationship.\n\nAlthough an exact date of birth for the couple’s child has not been shared, Khalil did indicate in a November 2023 Instagram post that they were expecting a boy. The post highlighted her baby bump and the bond between mother and father. In the caption, Khail said, “Getting closer to meeting our baby boy…”\n\nIn an Instagram story posted last month, Khalil shared a short but receptive message, captioning a photo of herself standing in a group shot alongside co-stars Bryton James (Devon) and Eric Braeden (Victor), which said, “Back At It!”\n\nThe Cheating Game\n\nSince Lily’s been out of town, a lot has been happening behind her back; namely, Daniel (Michael Graziadei) has been having a secret relationship with his ex, Heather (Vail Bloom), and things are about to get even messier when the two display public affection without considering where they are. So, when Lily returns during the week of March 11-15, 2024 (more specifically, pencil in Wednesday, March 13), does that mean she’ll catch the two in the act? Or will she have just missed some PDA? You’ll just have to tune in to find out!\n\n“The Young and the Restless” airs weekdays at 12:30 p.m. ET/11:30 a.m. PT on CBS. Stream Live and On Demand on Paramount+."
