I found myself scrolling aimlessly, feeling badly about myself from seeing what other people were doing and everything I wasn‚Äôt doing. I think social media can be great in some ways and toxic in other ways depending on your perspective. I know I‚Äôm not saying anything new here, but I have to remind myself that these are just highlights. This picture depicts an amazing highlight in my life with my man who is my everything and brings so much joy to my heart. But what it doesn‚Äôt show, are all the dark moments I also have experienced and have had to persevere through. So here‚Äôs to posting a highlight, to remind myself that life is beautiful, impermanent, and shouldn‚Äôt be taken for granted. ü§ç\".",
