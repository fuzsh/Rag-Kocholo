        "text": "The Young and the Restless spoilers has some fun news to pass on about a fan-favorite Y&R star. Eric Braeden, who portrays the iconic Victor Newman on the CBS soap. As you might know if you are fortunate enough to follow Eric on Twitter, he frequently tweets about his thoughts on various topics and keeps fans up to date about what he and his family are up to.\n\nWell, recently, Eric posted a photo of himself all dressed up in a suit, alongside two of his costars – Christel Khalil, who portrays Lily Winters, and Michelle Stafford, who portrays Phyllis Summers. All three of the Y&R stars are smiling big and looking happy together. Eric’s caption reads: “Two of my favorites.”\n\nEric’s followers simply love the photo and have been replying steadily to his post. One said: “You have excellent taste, Eric!” Another said: “Great picture. Y’all look fabulous.”\n\nAnd another said: “The guy in the middle is quite awesome, too!’\n\nIt didn’t take long for Michelle Stafford to tweet back as well. She said: “Back at cha baby! I love you so!” And one fans responded with a bit of humor to the post. He said: “Phyllis! Victor can’t stand Phyllis!! LOL.”\n\nEric has been replying to some of the feedback he’s received on the photo as well. One gentleman fan said: “Eric, can I get a job on Y&R? All those fabulous women!!! I’d love working there.” Eric replied: “Hahahahahaha, DON’T BLAME YOU!”\n\nEric’s nice tweet about his Y&R colleagues came just after another tweet in which he announced a “meet the author” event in San Angelo, Texas, on February 15. As you might know, Eric published a book titled: “I’ll Be Damned: How My Young & Restless Life Led Me To America’s #1 Daytime Drama” back in 2017.\n\nFans have been steadily replying to that tweet as well, which included a photo of a huge billboard in Texas featuring the book and an announcement about the “meet the author” event. It should be a great time for those fans lucky enough to be able to attend."
