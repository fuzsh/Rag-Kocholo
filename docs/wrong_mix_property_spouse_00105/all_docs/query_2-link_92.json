They are very open to their relationship, and Sam has also built a good relationship with Christel‚Äôs son, Michael.\n\nNow, the happy couple reveals their engagement to the public. Christel shared in a recent Instagram post, ‚ÄúA couple of months ago I said yes to the love of my life. We hate taking pictures so thank you to our beautiful friends for finally making us!‚Äù\n\nChristel also showed her appreciation to her fianc√© as she captioned, ‚ÄúAnd thank you @srestagn for asking me to be your partner in life. I could not be happier to tether myself to you forever‚Ä¶.(and yes, dressing the same that day was a true accident üòÜ)‚Äù.\n\nThe sweet photos of the couple wearing the same cardigan while riding on a boat made the pictures more romantic. Indeed, Christel Khalil is one of the lucky women who found another love after a failed marriage.\n\nFans And Friends Congratulate Christel And Sam For Their Engagement\n\nThe big announcement of the longtime couple makes their friends and fans happy.
