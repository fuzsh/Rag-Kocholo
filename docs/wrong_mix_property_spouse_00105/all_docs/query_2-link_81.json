        "text": "The Young and the Restless spoilers documented the widely unliked arc that positioned Juliet Helton (played by the solid Laur Allen) as the person who damaged a beloved couple. Lily (Christel Khalil) and Cane (Daniel Goddard) faced invented adversity, which is why this storyline didn’t work.\n\nThis scribe liked most of what former co-executive producer and head writer Sally Sussman, along with former story consultant Kay Alden, created during their brief returns to Y&R. The ladies’ links to the Bill Bell glory days were seen in many scripts, as they refocused the show on the Newman and Abbott clans. However, one misstep involved the creation of the Juliet character.\n\nAs many viewers know, or may have experienced, the Juliet’s of the world, or her male counterparts, often ignore marriage vows. Those reckless personality types don’t care enough about commitments, or connected children. All who knee-jerk about preaching refuse to acknowledge that free will is provable though science and must always be used as the standard for assessing right, wrong, or in between. Yes, moral relativity is purposely destructive.\n\nCane created his own consequences by getting drunk and then seemingly spending the night with Juliet in Tokyo. Since Goddard’s character apparently hadn’t become hooked on painkillers, as had been teased and then retracted, there was no logical reason why he would have gotten his buzz on, or somehow have not known that Juliet, not Lily, was in his room. Cane’s excuse about not remembering what happened also didn’t pass the smell test in this instance.\n\nThen, there is the Lily angle. Just a few years ago Khalil’s character and Scott Elrod’s (Joe) were, uh, close. Based off that situation Lily chose to overlook Cane’s betrayal with Juliet and the baby but couldn’t get by his shifting of school funds? That seemed forced.\n\nMal Young, who arrived at Y&R before Sussman and Alden returned, became head writer late this summer. His first episodes began airing just prior to Halloween.\n\nAllen was good, but her character probably couldn’t have remained on the show as Juliet was pock-marked in the minds of too many fans. That’s why Young’s decision to write out Juliet appears to indicate that Lane will be restored.\n\nThe redemption of this couple projects, by Lily’s suggestion, that Cane name his newborn son Sam. That choice would honor Samantha Atkinson (Selina MacDonald), Cane’s deceased sister. Colin (Tristan Rogers) is sure to treasure that moniker. He’ll also push hard for his son and daughter-in-law to remain married for the good of their entire, now-blended family.\n\nWriting a soap must be among the hardest scribe jobs in the entertainment world. Churning out likeable content 52 weeks a year is surely grueling and naturally elicits hyper-critique in today’s social media age and within an ever-fragmented television culture.\n\nKudos to Young and his team for taking the exit lane (pun intended) that Sussman and her group created by previously injecting the placenta previa issue into this arc. Here’s hoping for a rebalancing of one of Y&R’s most solid families. The Ashby’s can again reflect all of the other intact families that still exist by the tens of millions in the real world.\n\nCDL is a leading source for everything linked to The Young and the Restless.
