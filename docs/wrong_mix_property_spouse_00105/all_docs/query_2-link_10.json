        "text": "With the Coronavirus pandemic keeping most of the world at home, Christel Khalil is hunkered down with her 10-year-old son, Michael Caden, and boyfriend Sam Restagno in Toronto, Canada, where isolation has presented its chal- lenges. “I’m a grade school teacher now,” sighs the actress. “Caden and I have our own little schedule now that we follow. Everything is online and his teacher sends the work, plus she’ll do a little Zoom meeting with them every other morning. It’s actually worked out really well, but what I’ve noticed the most is how much of my grade schooling I actually forgot. I’ve had to relearn long division and my timetables. Fractions are the worst and I’m like, ‘Oh, my God.’ But luckily Sam is a mathematical genius, so I can just say, ‘This is a question for Sam.’ ”\n\nThe family of three has been faring well dur- ing lockdown. “I’ve actually been pleasantly surprised of how well we’ve done with the quar- antine,” KhaliI chuckles. “We haven’t killed each other, so that’s a good sign!”\n\nKhalil credits Restagno’s easygoing nature for creating a serene environment. The couple first met in 2016 when both attended the annu- al Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, CA. “We just ran into each other and our friend groups hung out,” she recalls. “We kind of hit it off right away. He’s Canadian, so he was really nice [laughs]. Another big one for me was that he wasn’t in the same industry. I felt that was all I was around. It was just a dif- ferent conversation with Sam, but there were a lot of other great things about him. We went out on our first date two weeks later and had so much fun together. About six months later, I knew he was the one.”\n\nAs the relationship deepened, the once- divorced Khalil not only reconsidered her vow never to marry again (“I’m not opposed to it anymore, but there’s no plan of that”), she also decided to simplify their long-distance romance by moving in with her businessman beau. That meant a big change for her son, as well. “It was hard for him, it was a big adjust- ment for all of us at first, and then you just go with it,” she concedes. “Now he loves his school and loves his friends, but we’re moving back so there’s going to be another adjustment.”"
