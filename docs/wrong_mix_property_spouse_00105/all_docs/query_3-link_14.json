        "text": "THE Young and the Restless fans have been left confused about her character's whereabouts and whether star Christel Khalil will be leaving the show.\n\nChristel plays the character of Lily on the popular soap opera.\n\nLily has been away from the main storyline for about a month.\n\nThe last time she appeared on The Young and the Restless, her boyfriend had cheated on her.\n\nHer absence had left fans wondering when she might be coming back.\n\n\"So where is Christel Khalil on maternity leave or something, because they have written Lily off screen #YR,\" one fan asked.\n\n\"Yes maternity leave,\" another replied.\n\nOthers chimed in with the same answer to let the fan know what was going on.\n\n\"CK is on maternity leave but its still no excuse to do this to her character. At the very least they could have shown Daniel putting his foot down with Heather instead of kissing her back! I hate that he is hurting Lily again this should've been his redemption,\" another wrote in response to the question.\n\n\"I know Lily (Kristal) is on maternity leave in real life, but since it’s Christmas, they could have shot scenes beforehand where Maddie came home after the fire instead of Lily spending Christmas there,\" another concerned viewer lamented.\n\nBABY BOY\n\nMeanwhile, Christel had been showcasing photos from her maternity leave on social media.\n\nIn November, Christel shared a photo of herself in a white wireless bra and a pair of jeans with her baby bump on full display to Instagram.\n\nShe cradled the bottom of her belly and wore a soft smile in the monochromatic photo.\n\n\"Getting closer to meeting our baby boy…\" she captioned the snap.\n\nAnother photo was a close-up of her hand on her belly.\n\nThe third photo found her standing with her hands on husband Sam Restagno.\n\nHowever, Christel has yet to post any additional photos to her Instagram account.\n\nIt's unclear if she already gave birth yet, but it's likely given her social media silence.\n\nThat still leaves fans questioning when it is that she'll return to the soap.\n\nFans will have to be patient for the time being until more information is uncovered about when Christel could return as Lily."
