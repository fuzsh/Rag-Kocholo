        "text": "The Young and the Restless fan favorite, Christel Khalil (Lily Winters), is returning to your screens next week on all-new episodes beginning March 11th-15th as Lily Winters. As previously reported, Khalil took time off for maternity leave for the birth of her second child.\n\nKahlil and her partner, Sam Restagno, welcomed a son but have not revealed the baby’s name or the actual birth date. The last update public update via Instagram was back in November of 2023 where Khalil revealed the baby’s gender. Christel’s eldest son, Michael Caden, 13, was from her previous marriage to Stephen Hensley.\n\nNow, in story on Y&R, Lily left Genoa City to help her daughter Mattie at Stanford University when she and other students were victims and trapped in a wildfire (how very California!).\n\nCircle in pencil, Wednesday, March 13th which looks from the latest Y&R teasers to be the date that Lily makes her surprise return. But what does this mean for her and Daniel (Michael Graziadei)? While she has been away, Daniel has been cozying back up with his ex, Heather Stevens (Vail Bloom).\n\nWill Lily catch Daniel and Heather together? What will she do when she finds out while she was away helping her daughter, he was having a secret affair with Heather? How will Daniel explain himself if he gets caught?\n\nMake sure to catch next week’s The Young and the Restless weekdays on CBS (12:30 pm ET/11:30am PT) and streaming Live and On Demand via Paramount+.\n\nSo, excited for the return of Lily Winters to the GC canvas?

Comment below.\n\nExciting news for B&B’s Matthew Atkinson (Thomas Forrester) and his wife, Brytnee Ratledge. The two will be welcoming a new addition to their family when their baby arrives!\n\nMatthew and Brytnee announced jointly via their Instagram accounts that they are becoming parents together for the first time. In the photo, Atkinson is looking at his wife’s baby bump, while Brytnee wrote, “Our next adventure.” The couple also revealed their little bundle of joy is due in October 2024.\n\nBaby on the way will join Matthew, Brytnee and their dog adorable Maisel, who even her own Instagram account. So many of Atkinson’s co-stars shared congrats on the baby news in their mutual post.\n\nY&R’s Courtney Hope (Sally) shared, “So excited.” B&B’s Ashley Jones (Bridget) said, “I am so excited for y’all.” DAYS Tamara Braun (Ava) expressed, “Gorgeous mama. I love you so much,” while GH’s Chad Duell (Michael) just entered a slew of emoji hands up and B&B’s Jacqueline MacInnes Wood (Steffy) shared many heart emojis. Finally, Y&R’s Tracey Bregman (Lauren) said, “Amazing!! Congrats ❤️”\n\nAtkinson and Ratledge married in a beautiful ceremony back in November of 2023 in Lake Tahoe, Nevada.\n\nCurrently, Matthew’s B&B alter ego Thomas Forrester headed back to Paris with his new fiancee Paris Buckingham (Diamond White) and his son, Douglas (Henry Joseph Samiri) after revealing to his family and Hope that he has moved on from his relationship with her and is starting a new life with Paris.\n\nShare your well-wishes and congratulations to Matthew and Brytnee as expectant parents to be via the comment section below, and if you hope Matthew is back on your screens shortly on The Bold and the Beautiful.\n\nJessica Serfaty (ex-Sloan Peterson, Days of our Lives) is making headlines these days, when she took to her social media to accuse her Italian billionaire fiancé, Leonardo Del Vecchio, of abuse only to retract the allegation a day later.\n\nOn Sunday night, Serfaty posted a short clip on Instagram, with her Ray-Ban heir fiancé in the background. Turning the camera on him, Serfaty said, ‘This is the man who has abused me.”\n\nNext, according to Daily Mail she showed her face up-close claiming he caused her head to bleed, but there was no blood in the photo. From the looks of it, Serfaty took the snaps of herself at looked to be taken a below a yacht. Del Vecchio, stared back at Jessica without saying a word. A second man, standing next to Leonardo, remained silent. However, he looked very uncomfortable with situation.\n\nFast-forward to Monday, Serfaty issued a statement on her Instagram story in which she took back the allegations. “Leo and I apologize for any who were triggered or affected by yesterday’s story,” she began. “Sometimes a family can have their own arguments and these should never be made public. We ask that people respect our privacy at this time.”\n\nApparently sensing people might think she was forced to make this retraction, Jessica added, “I would never stay with an abusive man and which Leonardo Del Vecchio is not. I revoke my words that were driven by anger and not in truth. I take back my words on a guy that will always be a companion, step father and family person to me.”\n\nHowever, several of Serfaty’s ex-boyfriends have accused Del Vecchio of abuse previously, including WWE superstar and celebrity influencer, Logan Paul, former One Direction member, Niall Horan and actor, Ed Westwick.\n\nDel Vecchio is the stepfather to Serfaty’s son, Roman, from her first marriage. As of now, it appears the couple still intends on getting married. They became engaged in July of 2023.\n\nWhat do you think about Jessica claiming her fiancé physically abused her, and then taking back the claims? Weigh-in via the comment section below.\n\nOn today’s July 24th episode of General Hospital, entertainment gossip reporter and blogger, Perez Hilton makes a cameo appearance when none other than Blaze (Jacqueline Grace Lopez) and Kristina (Kate Mansi) sit down with him for a dishy chat on his ‘talk show.’\n\nBlaze (Allie) and Kristina are giving an exclusive interview to Hilton so they can share their side of the story following Blaze’s mother, Natalia’s bigoted and offensive remarks about her own daughter and her relationship with Kristina.\n\nAs GH fans know, Natalia was unaware that Ava had been taping their conversation and turned it over to the Invader editor who ran it as a story, which in turn outed the women’s personal relationship and left Blaze without a record label when they dropped her. In addition, to the label dropping her, Blaze had to step down as the new face of Deception.\n\nPreviously, it was noted that Perez was coming to GH, but the details of the story he was involved with was kept under wraps. Now, he will be trying to get some good dirt out of Blaze and Kristina as the two chose to give a joint interview to Hilton.\n\nTaking to his Instagram to preview his big day in Port Charles, Hilton wrote, “On Wednesdays we wear pink and Perez Hilton takes over GH!” He added, “No one is safe!”\n\nIn addition, Hilton posted a video on his Blog yesterday, saying “I’m Going to Be on General Hospital, Tomorrow.” It is there he explained how nervous he was learning 30 pages of dialog for his scenes.\n\nMeanwhile, Kate Mansi shared a photo of the Perez Hilton talk show set, the GH set designers made for the scenes, on X, expressing, “Our team and set designer KILLED it for this #perezhilton set!”\n\nLooking forward to seeing and hearing what Blaze and Kristina have to say to Perez on today’s GH?
