        "text": "Christel Khalil (Lily, The Young and the Restless) is gearing up for her big wedding day to Sam Restagno, having recently celebrated her Bachelorette in Mexico City, Mexico. Sharing a few pictures from the happy time, Khalil wrote, “The definition of success. The kind of Bach party dreams are made of.”\n\nThe event was graced by her close friends, including her Y&R co-star Bryton James (Devon Hamilton) and from the looks of it, we can tell they had a lovely time.\n\nChristel Khalil who is set to wed Sam Restagno, first crossed paths with him at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, California, in 2016. They began dating and years later in 2022, Restagno popped the question and Khalil said yes. Earlier this year, the happy couple welcomed their first child together, a son.\n\nKhalil, who was previously married, had her first child, a son, in April 2010. Bryton James, her on-screen brother, is the godfather of her child, while actress Fadhia Marcelin is the godmother.\n\nCheck out the photos below from the fun Bachelorette here!"
