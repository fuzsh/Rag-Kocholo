        "text": "Time often flies by, especially when you have children marking the significant\n\nmoments in your life. Christel Khalil, known for her role as Lily on\n\n“The Young and the Restless” since 2002, celebrated an incredible milestone\n\nof 20 years on the show in August 2022. While her character has faced\n\nnumerous dramatic events, Khalil’s real life is much more joyful, particularly because of her son, Michael.\n\nChristel Khalil married Stephen Hensley in September 2008.\n\nThe couple joyfully announced the birth of their son, Michael Caden Hensley, on April 17, 2010, through Stephen’s post on social media: “My baby boy was born on April 17, 2010 @ 4:14 pm, 6 lbs. 6 oz.” This was a moment of immense happiness for the couple, marking the beginning of a new chapter in Khalil’s life.\n\nAs Michael grew, Khalil shared glimpses of his development on social media. In March 2013, she posted a picture of Michael at a barbershop, seated in a chair shaped like a taxi. “Michael Man getting his 2nd haircut!” she wrote with excitement, showcasing his bright and budding personality. A month later, she celebrated Michael’s third birthday with a collage of photos, illustrating his transformation from an infant to a lively three-year-old. She fondly recalled his birth, describing it as an incredible and painful experience, as he was born at home in a birthing tub without any medication.\n\nKhalil has continued to document Michael’s growth over the years, sharing numerous moments that highlight their close bond. In January 2014, she posted a picture of Michael standing in front of a large screen displaying a photo of herself at a similar age. “I think it’s safe to say we look alike. #minime,” she captioned, pointing out their striking resemblance. Fans responded warmly, appreciating the clear connection between mother and son.\n\nIn February 2019, Khalil shared a heartwarming Instagram post of her and Michael enjoying ice cream together on a cold day, radiating affection and showcasing their special bond. In an interview with Soaps in Depth in May 2019, Khalil expressed how profoundly Michael has impacted her life. “I feel like I wouldn’t be the person I am today if I hadn’t had my son. The lessons he’s taught me are countless,” she said. Khalil admitted that having Michael at a young age made her realize she didn’t know everything, and through him, she learned what truly matters in life, deepening her empathy and compassion.\n\nApril 2022 marked another significant milestone as Michael celebrated his 12th birthday. Khalil posted a photo on Instagram of Michael sitting with a large cake adorned with a “12” candle. “12?! Where did the time go? Happy birthday to my little man,” she wrote, reflecting on how quickly time has passed. Khalil continues to marvel at her son’s growth and the swift passage of time.\n\nThe family enjoyed a memorable trip to Italy in October 2022, and Khalil shared photos of her and Michael soaking in the beauty of their surroundings. She poignantly acknowledged, “They do grow too fast,” a sentiment echoed by many parents. Fans noted that Michael would soon be taller than his mother, a testament to his rapid growth.\n\nIn November 2023, Khalil shared exciting news: Michael was about to become a big brother. She posted a photo of herself, visibly pregnant, on Instagram with the caption, “Getting closer to meeting our baby boy…” Fans rejoiced at the news of her second son with her fiancé Sam Restagano. By March 19, Khalil confirmed the arrival of their baby boy, Remy, adding another chapter to their family story.\n\nChristel Khalil’s journey as a mother has been filled with joy, learning, and love. Through social media, she has shared many precious moments of her life with Michael, celebrating his milestones and cherishing their bond. As Michael grows and Khalil continues her career, their story is a beautiful reminder of how children enrich our lives and how quickly time passes. With the addition of Remy to their family, Khalil now has even more wonderful ways to measure the passage of time and embrace the future with her loved ones.\n\nThat’s all for today’s video.
