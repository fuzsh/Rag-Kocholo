        "text": "William Joseph Bell (March 6, 1927 – April 29, 2005) was an American screenwriter and television producer, best known as the creator of the soap operas Another World, The Young and the Restless and The Bold and the Beautiful.\n\nEarly life\n\nBell was born and raised in Chicago as an only child. His father was an accountant for the Link-Belt Company. His mother was primarily a homemaker, with a part-time job with Mrs. Steven's Candies. (In later years, his parents adopted a daughter.) Bell grew up listening to radio soap operas when he came home from school for lunch and late at night, including Life Can Be Beautiful, The Romance of Helen Trent and Our Gal Sunday. As a depression-era child, he would work at various odd jobs on weekends to help the family. In high school, he participated in the ROTC. After serving in the Navy as a corpsman, he attended the University of Michigan.\n\nCareer\n\nChicago radio writer\n\nAt the age of 21, Bell worked at WJJD radio as a writer for two shows, with the focus being teen problems. That work led him to seek a job at WBBM radio as a comedy writer; specifically, character-oriented comedy, rather than jokes. He worked there for about three years.\n\nAdvertising industry\n\nBell went to McCann Erickson, then the second-largest advertising agency worldwide. He wrote radio and television commercials for Standard Oil of Indiana, the agency's biggest account; he was subsequently promoted to account executive, responsible for five small accounts. After three years there. Bell was offered an account executive position with Cunningham & Walsh.\n\nProcter and Gamble Productions\n\nDuring his time as a comedy writer at WBBM radio in Chicago, he made a call to Irna Phillips' secretary Rose Cooperman asking her if Phillips had an opening for a writer, as she was a well-known soap opera creator and Bell had become aware that Phillips also resided in Chicago. Cooperman said Phillips did have an opening. While Bell was composing a sample script, he was informed that the writer who was supposedly leaving had decided to stay, so the writing job was not available. Later, during the time that Bell was in the advertising business, he ran into Phillips' niece. She mentioned him to her aunt and Phillips remembered who he was; she also knew his wife, who was a well-known celebrity due to her work on local television.\n\nHe started his writing career on Guiding Light and then moved over to As the World Turns, working under Phillips; Phillips' other protegee at the time was Agnes Nixon. Bell co-created Another World with Phillips in 1964. In 1965, he co-created the primetime As the World Turns spinoff Our Private World.\n\nDays of Our Lives\n\nIn 1966, he was hired as head writer of the then-struggling soap Days of Our Lives. Bell was credited with the show's initial surge of popularity. He intended to leave the show around 1972 when he began creating his own show The Young and the Restless, but the owners of the show sued him, and he agreed to write long-term story projections for them. He remained as head writer until 1975.\n\nThe Young and the Restless\n\nIn 1972, CBS executives wanted a new daytime serial that was youth oriented. William along with his wife Lee Phillip Bell created The Young and the Restless for the network under the working title, The Innocent Years. However, before the show went into production, he had to rename the series as Bell mentioned...\"We were confronted with the very disturbing reality that young America had lost much of its innocence,\". \"Innocence as we had known and lived it all our lives had, in so many respects, ceased to exist.\" They renamed the series The Young and the Restless because they felt it \"reflected the youth and mood of the early seventies.\" He spent between ten and sixteen hours a day writing stories.\n\nThe Young and the Restless debuted on March 26, 1973. Although slow to rise in the ratings (he got very frustrated and asked head of CBS Daytime Bud Grant to cancel the serial), CBS had faith in the show and gave it a chance. Y&R was credited for breathing new life into the daytime serial, with its brightness, humor and cutting-edge storylines. Bell guided Y&R as head writer from 1973 until stepping down in 1998, the longest tenure of any head writer in soap opera history. Y&R has been the highest-rated soap on the air since 1988 in households, and 1989 among viewers.\n\nThe Bold and the Beautiful\n\nIn 1986, he began working on creating another soap for CBS Daytime, but plans were halted until the end of the year when the network decided to cancel the soap Capitol and needed a replacement. He created The Bold and the Beautiful, which debuted on March 23, 1987. B&B is known for its glamorous look as it is set in the fashion industry. It followed Y&R and has been a ratings success as well.\n\nPersonal life\n\nBell was married to former talk show host Lee Phillip Bell (born Loreley June Phillip), who co-created The Young and the Restless and The Bold and the Beautiful with him. Their three children, William James Bell, Bradley Phillip Bell, Lauralee Bell Martin, and daughter-in-law Maria Arena Bell have all been involved in their parents' soaps in some capacity.\n\nOn April 29, 2005, Bell died at age 78 from complications of Alzheimer's disease. He is buried at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.\n\nBell acquired the Wallace Neff designed Sol Wurtzel House in Bel Air, Los Angeles in 1991.\n\nAwards and recognition\n\nIn 1992, he was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award at the 19th annual Daytime Emmy Awards.\n\nProducing and writing credits\n\nAnother World\n\nCo-Creator (with Irna Phillips)\n\nCo-Head Writer: May 1964 – March 1965\n\nAs the World Turns\n\nCo-Head Writer: 1965–1966\n\nWriter: 1950s–1960s\n\nThe Bold and the Beautiful\n\nCo-Creator (with Lee Phillip Bell)\n\nExecutive Producer: March 23, 1987 – February 14, 1996 (with Lee Phillip Bell)\n\nHead Writer: March 23, 1987 – May 3, 1993\n\nexecutive story consultant: May 4, 1993 - June 1, 1993\n\nDays of Our Lives\n\nHead Writer: 1966–1975\n\nGuiding Light\n\nWriter: 1950s\n\nOur Private World\n\nCo-Creator (with Irna Phillips)\n\nThe Young and the Restless\n\nCo-Creator (with Lee Phillip Bell)\n\nExecutive Producer: March 26, 1973 – 1976, January 2004 – April 2005\n\nSenior Executive Producer: 1976 – January 2004\n\nHead Writer: March 26, 1973 – July 3, 1998\n\nExecutive Story Consultant: 1998 – April 2005\n\nLegacy\n\nAs of December 2020, Bell holds the distinction of having created the largest number of soap opera characters that are still appearing, with over 25 characters on either The Young and the Restless, The Bold and the Beautiful, or Days of Our Lives such as:"
