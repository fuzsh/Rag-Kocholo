        "text": "Christel has an interview is the upcoming issue of Soap Opera Digest. Cliffnotes version:\n\nShe was approached by head writer Josh Griffith in January in the hallway of Y&R about featuring Lily in a longer term story as opposed to just visits. She calls the conversation with Josh kismet as she and her Canadian boyfriend had already discussed moving back to Los Angeles and were on the same page before she was asked to come back for the storyline. She’s still in Toronto and intended to move back LA with her son and BF this summer and is still planning to but the coronavirus has their plans of exactly when it will happen up in the air.\n\nShe’s excited about Lily being in the business arena and actually being a boss in something as opposed to just an employee. It’s something she’s always wanted for Lily. She enjoys working with Jason Thompson(Billy).\n\nlonger term story doesn’t say she is back on full time contract wonder what longer term means …while I like her at times I do not like the writing this time she is way too bossy do not like how she talks to her co-ceo she talks to Billy like he is someone who doesn’t know anything\n\nwant to see Lily fail and Billy rise up\n\nI had the same thoughts!!! It seems to me Lily is acting like she is Billy’s “boss” instead of his “equal” for Chancellor’s Media. I thought they were suppose to be sharing the CEO position yet you don’t see Billy at an actual “desk” only Lily. And she acts like she has more experience doing this job than Billy who has worked at an actual CEO job at Jabot!! Did she forget how her stupid ex-husband Cain set Billy up with the gambling photo to ruin his reputation when he worked with her as a model??? How is it they make Billy take a back seat to her when he has more experience??? I like to see Billy be in a winning position and not be portrayed a screw-up all the time!!\n\nThanks. Exactly. And Billy was fair when they flipped a coin for larger office, so her snide remarks. Why are here in my office is just rude. Honestly hope the prison job calls they need her back there.\n\nSo sorry she was brought back"
