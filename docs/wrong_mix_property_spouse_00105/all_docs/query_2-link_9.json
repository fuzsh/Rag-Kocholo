        "text": "A mystery ensues or does it\n\nThose who enjoy the action in Genoa City, might have a mystery to solve that has bern taking place both on and off screen. About a year before Christel Khalil went on recurring status on The Young and the Restless, spoilers quoted the actress as having said she was tired of playing Lily. Here she is, however, heading into three years later and she is still portraying Lily Winters Ashby. There were never any announcements about Ms. Khalil taking on any new projects, or announcing what her future plans were. There may. however, be a tale when you read between the lines, that is hidden in plain sight that is related to the timeline. Christel Khalil herself never spoke about why she removed herself from contract status.\n\nMal Young strikes again\n\nThe rumor mill suggested that Khalil had problems with then head writer, Mal Young, as allegedly did Eileen Davidson, and Mishael Morgan. Both of these women have also returned to the CBS daytime drama since Young was fired. Morgan’s character Hilary died so she is now portraying a lookalike lawyer, Amanda Sinclair. Davidson has not returned full time but Ashley shows up in Genoa City more and more. Now it looks as if Lily will be on hand in additional episodes due to accepting Jill’s job offer to work with Billy. The duo agreed last week to run the new media venture of Chancellor Industries. This is speculation, mind you but timing and the writers actions speak volumes.\n\nAshby family is history\n\nWhile Khalil’s character Lily, was away from Genoa City, her entire family was removed from the show. As mentioned in previous articles, Lily and Cane divorced, he sold the house and the twins were sent away to college. Cane then left town looking for Colin and to clear his name, but has not been seen or heard from since. Daniel Goddard’s recent tweets are about his wife and children, with no mention of The Young and the Restless. Lane fans were hoping that prior to Goddard’s exit, that Cane and Lily might reunite. Earlier on Lily had forgiven her husband and promised to be a good mother to his son Sam, but once she got out of prison, Lily admitted she could not look at the child without remembering her husbands infidelity with Juliet.\n\nThe plot thickens\n\nBaby Sam, who would now be about three years old was never shown as he was growing but fans knew he was there. The fact that the writers simply dismissed the child is very telling. Again, as pointed out in earlier writings, Christel Khalil’s going to recurring status seems to have given the powers that be, exactly what they nerfed to get rid of Daniel Goddard. At one point, about six weeks prior to his last air date Goddard tweeted photo’s of his and Khalil’s parking spots and chairs with their names on them on the Y&R set. He even posted the phrase, “Reunited and it feels so good.” He obviously had no idea he was about to be fired. So now we have Christel Khalil, who allegedly wanted to be done with Lily back in action in Genoa City, but without Cane and her children.\n\nIs it remotely possible that Khalil was not done with her character Lily, but was tired of the way she was being portrayed? Perhaps the actress wanted more than raising Sam and the twins and being married to Cane. Viewers loved the Lane pairing and enjoyed the chemistry between Christel Khalil and her on screen husband. It’s obvious from his tweets that Daniel Goddard did too. Prior to losing his job, he tweeted about Khalil, “ There’s no me without you.” Unfortunately Goddard remains on the outside, while his former costar is working with the bad boy of Genoa City.\n\nWhat the future may hold\n\nSomewhere at some point there were negotiations with Khalil and perhaps a deal was sweetened to get her back on the show. There has been no official notice that the actress is back on contract, but if she will be working with Billy, she will have to be in town significantly more than she has in the past. Y&R viewers could see that the character of Cane was being dismantled for more than a year prior to being written out of the show. The final fiasco was having Traci fantasize about him, then turn him down when he wanted a real relationship. Traci is the mother of Colten who was Lily’s best friend. There was also a significant age difference between Ms. Abbott and Cane and bottom line, viewers did not like this pairing.\n\nIt’s clear the writers did not know what to do with Daniel Goddard’s character, so they write him out. Cane was supposed to clear his name but now that the truth had been revealed, no one had mentioned him. Chance advised Jill that Colin was using Devon’s funds for money laundering and never intended to keep it. The detective says he is going to track Mr. Atkinson down and see that he pays for his crimes. Not one person had mentioned the fact that Cane was innocent and neither has he called with any updates regarding his own search for his father.\n\nStay tuned to find out\n\nThere may be nothing at all to the theory I have proposed, but perhaps it’s all true. There is no way to prove it but Christel Khalil returning to The Young and the Restless shortly after Daniel Goddard was let go is interesting timing. It looks like the actress did not desire even a slight hint of a Lane reunion so she came back after Cane was long gone. Another interesting thing to note is that nothing progressed with Victoria and Cane after they kissed but now Lily is working closely with a Billy. This could remain a business relationship or the two could become romantically linked. Viewers should keep in mind that nothing is set in stone on The Young and the Restless.\n\nA set insider allegedly reported to Soaps She Knows that Jason Thompson’s character was hanging by a thread and on his way out. Now it looks as if the writers changed their minds and he will be sticking around and working with Lily. There is also a possibility that Daniel Goddard could return and he and Victoria could pick up where they left off. It’s a stretch but anything is possible. Even so, it appears that Khalil did not enjoy a domesticated Lilyand now that she’s working with Billy, she will enjoy a wild ride so stay tuned."
