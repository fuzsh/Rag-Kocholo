Congratulations are in order for The Young and the Restless fave Christel Khalil (Lily Winters). The actress has revealed that she is expecting!

Khalil made the announcement in a very 2023 way -- in a series of posts on Instagram. Khalil shared a series of photos taken from her recent trip to the Monte Carlo TV Festival and Awards, and her baby bump was quite visible in the images.

"That's a wrap on Monaco! Thank you, Festival TV Monte Carlo for a great trip! Loved being there with this A-Team," Khalil captioned the photo montage. "Lots of laughs, blisters on our feet, and ate enough croissants to supply a bakery. See you next time!"

The A-Team Khalil spoke of included Y&R co-stars Bryton James (Devon Hamilton), Amelia Heinle (Victoria Newman), and Melody Thomas Scott (Nikki Newman). Also part of the pack was Khalil's fianc√©, businessman Sam Restagno.

This will be the second child for Khalil. She has a 13-year-old son, Michael Caden, from her previous marriage to musician Stephen Hensley.
