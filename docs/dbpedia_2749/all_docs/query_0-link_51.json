Here are a bunch of recommendations for your long weekend or 3-day trip that will give you a ton of ideas. I've been to Barcelona so many times and still haven't explored everything it has to offer! In this guide, I provide the following: üèõÔ∏è 40+ things to see and do around the city, divided by district. ü•ò 5+ restaurants to stop in and sit down at to enjoy a bite to eat. Most are locally run and operated that you won't find anywhere outside of Barcelona and feature a very local dining experience to better immerse yourself in Catalan and Barcelona culture.\n\nThe year 2023 celebrates the 100th anniversary since the death of one of Barcelona‚Äôs best Architects. Llu√≠s Dom√®nech i Montaner (1849-1923) designed many of the most brilliant examples of Modernist architecture in Barcelona, but his work often gets over-shined by Gaud√≠. To celebrate the centennial anniversary of his death the city is hosting a plethora of events to get to know the amazing buildings (11 in total remain) he designed around Barcelona!"
