        "text": "The history of Casa Amatller began when the chocolate industry businessman, Antoni Amatller, decided that he wanted a home that was clearly differentiated from the others. He decided to commission the work to the Catalan architect Josep Puig i Cadafalch, thus beginning the construction of the Amatller House.\n\nThis construction was completed in 1900, and the businessman and his family moved into their new home. As Antoni Amatller wished, the house was incredibly colorful, a masterpiece of Catalan modernism that mixed flamenco and Gothic styles.\n\nPerhaps the most striking feature of Casa Amatller is its peculiar facade, inspired by flamenco, adorned with delicate ceramics and large windows. The hall of the house, designed for the entrance of carriages, is spacious and as luxurious as a businessman of the time could afford.\n\nThe luxury of Casa Amatller is best appreciated in the main room and on the first floors, as the house rises, it becomes more homey and welcoming. It was on the upper floors that the Amatller family used to spend most of their time.\n\nThis residential building has stood for just over a century, witnessing the last hundred years of Barcelona history. In 1960 it passed into the hands of the Amatller Institute of Hispanic Art, a foundation that belongs to the descendants of Antoni Amatller and was proclaimed a Site of Cultural Interest in 1976.\n\nAlthough it has had to undergo some renovations over the years, its structure and much of the decoration remain completely original, including the ornaments on the façade, the stained glass windows and some furniture that belonged to the Amatller Family.\n\nThe house is part of the Manzana de la Discordia, on the popular Paseo de Gracia, so it is a neighbor of other famous modernist-style works. Its location is very close to the famous Batlló House or the Milá House, both by Gaudí.\n\nLikewise, Casa Amatller offers guided tours, which go through the entire house and explain its construction process. Visitors are usually allowed access to the magnificent halls, the beautiful main balcony, the library and the photo gallery.\n\nVisiting the Casa Amatller is to live a whole learning experience, both of the contemporary history of Barcelona and of modernist architecture. There are several nearby bus stops, so access is not a limitation when approaching the residence.\n\nIn addition, as it is part of Paseo de Gracia, visiting Casa Amatller is taking a tour of one of the most important avenues in all of Catalonia. It is a vibrant and cosmopolitan place, which ideally accompanies the great Barcelona work that is Casa Amatller.\n\nSo if you are passing through the Catalan capital, do not hesitate, and go for a walk through one of its most emblematic buildings. We assure you that the experience will be completely worth it."
