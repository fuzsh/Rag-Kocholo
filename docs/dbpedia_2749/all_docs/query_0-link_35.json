        "text": "HISTORY\n\nThe Lleó i Morera house is a modernist building located in Passeig de Gracia, designed by the famous catalan architect Lluís Domènech i Montaner. It's one of the buildings that form the \"Block of Discord\": a square of Passeig de Gracia where there are five buildings designed by architects that had professional rivalry between them: Puig i Cadafalch's Casa Amatller, Gaudí's Casa Batlló, Domènech i Montaner's Casa Lleó Morera, Coquillat's Casa Bonet and Sagnier's Casa Mulleras.\n\nThe facade and the interior are decorated with different figures of modernist style. On the interior decoration with mosaics predominates, as is typical of this architecture style. On the exterior there are allusions to the family name, Lleó i Morera, as there are representations of the mulberry flower in different materials.\n\nNowadays it's closed to the public, you can't visit the inside, as they are offices.\n\nINFORMATION"
