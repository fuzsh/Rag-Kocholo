        "text": "The Casa Lleó-Morera is a building designed by noted modernisme architect Lluís Domènech i Montaner, located at Passeig de Gràcia 35 in the Eixample district of Barcelona. The building is located on the corner with Carrer del Consell de Cent, and is one of the three important buildings of the Illa de la Discòrdia. The building was originally constructed in 1864, and was renovated beginning in 1902. Unlike many buildings constructed at the time, it was not named for its owner; rather it is named from the lions (lleó) and mulberry trees (morera) motifs in the decorations. Domènech i Montaner worked with sculptor Eusebi Arnau, Antoni Serra i Fiter for the ceramics, Lluís Brú and Mario Maragliano for the mosaics and Gaspar Homar for decoration and furniture to make the complete work."
