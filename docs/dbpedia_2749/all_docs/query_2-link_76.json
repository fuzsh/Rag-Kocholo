        "text": "La Boqueria\n\nMercat de Sant Josep de la Boqueria is one of the main gastronomic attractions of Barcelona. The impressive market hall was completed in 1914, and has always been noisy and crowded, but also a place of excellent fresh food!\n\nSee the official website for an overview of all the market stands. Get directions.\n\nCasa Batlló\n\nCasa Batlló is part of the 'Block of Discord', referring to three famous modernista buildings located close together, all having their own unique style. The fairy-like Casa Batlló with its bone-shaped pillars and its dragon-shaped roof, was designed by Antoni Gaudí in 1904.\n\nOpen every day! See the official website for visitor info. Get directions.\n\nParc de la Ciutadella\n\nParc de la Ciutadella is beloved by all. It offers many lawns perfect for sunbathing, palm trees and benches, as well as plenty of shaded parts. In the North of the park, you can find the Cascada Monumental, a great but exuberant fountain built for the Universal Exposition of 1888.\n\nThe park closes at 22:30h. Get directions.\n\nZona Artesanal\n\nExtremely charming area with boutiques and concept stores, selling local design, clothes and accessories. Don't simply pass the Carrer de l'Argenteria or Carrer de la Princesa like most tourists, but dare to enter this little maze, and you will be rewarded. Get directions.\n\nPalo Market Fest\n\nPalo Alto Market is more like an event in a cosy setting, with market stalls offering hip clothes and bijous, but also with music, drinks and street food. It takes place every first weekend of the month. A small entrance fee is required, tickets can be bought at the door, or via the official website. Entrance from Carrer dels Pellaires. Get directions.\n\nChurch of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, Tibidabo\n\nThe Tibidabo Church can be seen from almost anywhere in the city. The stained-glass windows of its four towers make up the Latin phrase Tibi Dabo (meaning 'I will give to you'). The amusement park next to the church was opened in 1905 and is among the oldest in the world. Most of the original rides are still in use.\n\nTo get to Tibidabo, see Extra Streetwise on our map or get directions.\n\nSagrada Família\n\nThe Sagrada Família is a symbol of Barcelona, a fantastic offshoot of church architecture and one of the most famous long-term buildings in the world, initiated by Gaudí already more than a century ago. From the inside the basilica looks wonderful, alike a fairy-tale forest.\n\nIt is recommended to buy your tickets online, to avoid waiting. Open every day! Get directions.\n\nCasa Vicens\n\nCasa Vicens was the first important building designed by Antoni Gaudí between 1883 and 1885. It is considered to be one of the first Art Nouveau buildings. Casa Vicens was built as a summer house for the Vicens family.\n\nToday it's open to visitors as a museum, every day! See the official website for visitor info. Get directions.\n\nPasseig de Gràcia\n\nThe Passeig de Gràcia is an elegant shopping avenue, which was originally laid out to connect the old city of Barcelona with the village of Gràcia. Nowadays it can be seen as the main street of Barcelona. The wide avenue offers plenty of examples of beautiful buildings in the style of Catalan modernism. Get directions.\n\nMercat Gòtic\n\nOnce a week, the magnificent square in front of the Cathedral of Barcelona, serves as the stage of a cute little flea market. The focus is on small articles, like silverware, jewelry and ceramics.\n\nThe street market is held every Thursday. See the official website (Ca) for more info. Get directions.\n\nBotanical Garden of Barcelona\n\nJardí Botànic de Barcelona is the biggest botanical garden of Barcelona, offering a wide collection of plants from countries with a Mediterranean climate. The garden is open every day and requires a small admission fee. The entrance can be found on the North side.\n\nSee the official website for more visitor info. Get directions.\n\nNational Art Museum of Catalonia\n\nMuseu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya is housed in the National Palace, majestically positioned on Montjuïc Hill. The museum boasts an impressive collection of Romanesque art (most notably church paintings), as well as Catalan art from the late 19th and early 20th century.\n\nThe museum is closed on Mondays. Get directions.\n\nBarceloneta Beach\n\nThese are Barcelona’s oldest and most touristy beaches. Closer to the city centre, it can get really crowded in summer. Around the brown tower (a little South of the middle), you'll find most relaxed beach bars and restaurants. In the North end there are nice restaurants on the beach as well, but the atmosphere is a bit more formal there. Get directions.\n\nFor beaches outside of Barcelona, see Extra Streetwise on our map.\n\nParc Güell\n\nParc Güell was an incredible project of the Catalan industrialist Eusebi Güell, to create a residential area comparable to the then in England popular concept of a garden city. As the architect of the project, Gaudí created a perfect harmony between nature and architecture.\n\nThe park is open every day! It is recommended to buy your tickets online, to avoid waiting. Get directions.\n\nPlaça de Gaudí\n\nNear the crowded Sagrada Família, the Plaça de Gaudí is a shaded oasis of rest. Many benches are positioned around a pond, which was designed to be a 'Mirror of Water', aiming at the reflection of the Sagrada Família in the water. Watch out, pickpockets also love this place! Get directions.\n\nCarrer de la Volta dels Tamborets\n\nSome lovely boutiques with clothes and local design, located in a romantic passageway. If not for the shops, go here for the atmosphere or some pretty pictures in the charming old Barcelona! Get directions.\n\nCathedral of the Holy Cross and Saint Eulalia\n\nIt is this cathedral, and not the Sagrada Família, that is the main Cathedral of Barcelona. The Gothic cathedral with its magnificent interior, includes several chapels and a 14th century cloister with a courtyard and 13 white geese.\n\nA regular ticket costs around € 10, but note that during some hours, part of the church can also be visited for free. See the official website for visitor info. Get directions.\n\nPoblenou Cemetery\n\nCementiri del Poblenou is an open-air museum of funerary art. Amongst the many impressive graves and sculptures, there’s The Kiss of Death which can be found in the back, towards Department 4.\n\nGuided tours are also offered here, see the official website for more info. The entrance is on the side of Carrer de Badajoz (get directions).\n\nParc del Laberint d'Horta\n\nParc del Laberint d'Horta is a green jewel from the 18th century. The park consists of peaceful and romantic gardens with flowerbeds, a waterfall, and a true labyrinth in the centre. If you like parks, go here, it is worth the ride (get off at metro station Mundet, Line L3).\n\nA small entrance fee is required, but the park is free on Wednesdays and Sundays! Closes around sunset. Get directions.\n\nEl Flea\n\nTypical flea market where you can encounter anything, the only thing all articles have in common are the small prices. Most stands offer clothes. The street market is organized every second Sunday of the month.\n\nPlease note that the market can be cancelled in case of rain. See the official website (Sp) for more info.
