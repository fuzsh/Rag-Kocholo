        "text": "Lluís Domènech i Montaner was born on December 21, 1850. He was an outstanding architect and one of the leading representatives of Catalan Modernism. He held the chair of the College of Architecture and was very involved in the political world so he left a large footprint in the Catalan culture.\n\nHis style has a rational basis but combined with Hispano-Arabic elements that give his works a special character.\n\nHe has many important works such as: Castillo de los Tres Dragones, Casa Fuster, Casa Lamadrid, Farmàcia 1896, Hotel Estaña, Casa Thomas, Casa Lleó Morera, Palacio Ramón Montaner, Ateneu Canetenc, Casa Gasul, Casa Navàs, Fundation Antoni Tàpies (before Montaner i Simón Publishing House), Tres Caños Fountain in Comilla, Universidad Pontífica in Comillas, Cantabria, etc.\n\nHowever,his major works are the Hospital de Sant Pau consisting of 19 buildings that form a small modernist city inside the city of Barcelona connected by 1km of tunnels; and the Palau de la Música Catalana, a theater representative of Catalan Modernism built between 1905 and 1908 which consists of large glass walls, sculptures, mosaics, stained glass and forges. It was commissioned by the Catalan Choral Society to establish their headquarters there.\n\nDomènech used many iron structures and the ceramic to create mosaics. This style can be seen very well in the Castle of the Three Dragons, built as a restaurant for the Universal Exhibition of 1888 and in the Palau de la Musica Catalana. Both project an imposing and grandiose image. Unlike other modernist architects who over time add more and more elements to their works, Domènech evolves with lighter buildings, always with the typical modernist ornamentation.\n\nIt’s alsovery important his political life since he was a member of La Joven Cataluña and theCatalan Center, president of the League of Catalonia and the Union Catalanista, member of the Catalan National Center and the Regionalist League and a dear deputy. However, he ended up leaving this world somewhat disappointed and devoted the last years of his life to archaeological and historical researches. He died in Barcelona on December 27, 1923"
