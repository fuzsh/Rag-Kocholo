It makes up part of the Illa de la Discòrdia (Block of Discord), noted for its modernist buildings on Passeig de Gràcia, which also includes Casa Batlló and Casa Amatller. Although you can't visit the the interior of the house, you can see the original dining room furniture on exhibition at the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya (MNAC)."
