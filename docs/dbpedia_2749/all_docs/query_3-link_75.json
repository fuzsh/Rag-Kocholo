        "text": "Today we will take a look at 2 architectural masterpieces that are perhaps not as famous as Gaudi’s other works, but are definitely worth seeing.\n\nHospital Sant Pau had their doors open until 16th March from 11 .00 to 18.00. The building is a sample of Modernism Architecture and was designed by Lluís Domènech i Montaner. The hospital opened doors for the first time for 4 years ago during which it was renovated. It was declared by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 1997 and definitely deserves the time to visit it. For the newly arrived in Barcelona – Hospital San Pau is located close to Sagrada Familia and the closest metro stop is “Sant Pau” (line L5). For the ones who won´t be able to visit it during the open doors days – after the 16th Match there will be 2 types of visits – Self-guided visit that costs 8 Euros and a guided visit for 14 Euros. For more information check the official website.\n\nAnother piece of architecture from Lluís Domènech i Montaner that also opened doors recently after renovation is Casa Lleó Morera. It was one of the private homes he renovated and it was an old house for which he did a complete remodeling and was finished in 1906. The house is located on Passeig de Gracia (35) – close to casa Batlló.\n\nThere are guided tours offered – the price is 15 Euros and during the visit you will feel like you are travelling back in time. You will be explained the story of the house, who the Lleó I Morera family was and of course you will learn about the work of Lluis Domènech i Montaner.\n\nMore information on where you can buy tickets and the working hours can be found on the official website of the house."
