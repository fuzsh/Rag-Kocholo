        "meta_description": "Part of the Illa de la Discòrdia, or Block of Discord, Lluís Domènech i Muntaner's design displays a spectacular use of mosaic, as well as stained-glass windows by Lluís Rigalt and sculptures by Eusebi Arnau. These decorative elements reflect Hellenistic, Gothic, and Renaissance influences, especially the stained-glass windows. Built between 1902 and 1906, the landmark stands in the same residential block as two other outstanding modernist buildings created by different architects in hugely different styles, hence the collective name: Block of Discord. Guided tours are available though tickets must be purchased online as they do not sell tickets at the house.",
