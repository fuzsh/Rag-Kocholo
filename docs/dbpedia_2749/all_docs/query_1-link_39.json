        "text": "During their stay in Barcelona, many of them miss casa Lleo Morera.\n\nToday, the site still reveals the beauty of Montaner's art.\n\nIn this article, I'll tell you all about it!\n\nLa casa Lleo Morera: article summary\n\nCasa Rocamora, the base of casa Lleo Morera\n\nLluis Domènech i Montaner remodeled the Casa Rocamora, and the result was so fascinating that Albert Lleó i Morera asked him to demolish and rebuild the façade, fromadd three galleries, stone balconies on different floors and design the interior.\n\nAnd so Casa Lleo Morera was born. After several years' work, the architect was able to deliver the newly finished building to his patron. We can still contemplate the magnificent result today.\n\nA piece of Catalan modernism\n\nTo bring his vision to life, Lluis Domènech i Montaner hired some of the most experienced artists of the time, to add detail to every inch of the house. Domènech i Montaner worked with mosaicists Lluís Bru and Mario Maragliano, sculptors Eusei Arnau, Joan Carreras and Alfons Juyol, ceramist Antoni Serra i Filter and interior designers Gaspar Homar and Josep Pey. The project was completed in 1906, 4 years after the start of work.\n\nWith its ornaments, sculptures, ceramics, carved wood, marble, stained glass and mosaics, Casa Lleó i Morera has become one of the most appreciated pieces of Spanish architecture.\n\nWhere is Casa Lléo i Morera?\n\nCasa Lleó I Morera is one of three architectural sites in the Passeig de Gràcialocated right next to the Casa Amatllerby Josep Puig I Cadafalch, and the Casa Batllóby Antoni Gaudí.\n\nThese three magnificent buildings form the Mansana de la Discòrdia, which in French means \"the apple of discord\", since no one seems to be able to see the other. be able to decide which building is the most beautiful.\n\nCasa Morera in our time\n\nIn 2006, Casa Lleó I Morera was acquired by Grup Núñez I Navarro, a Spanish company working in construction, property development, sales, rentals, parking lots and warehouses. The group also works on the restoration of historic buildings, including palaces and hotels.\n\nWhen the Group acquired the house, it underwent a two-year restoration and conservation process that focused primarily on the façade, rear courtyard and interior spaces.\n\nCasa Lleó i Morera used to be open to visitors, but recently closed its doors. Now, the best way to explore the house is to take a virtual tour on the official website.\n\nAlthough not open to the public, the house can still be appreciated from outside on Passeig de Gràcia.\n\nOther notable works by Lluis Domènech i Montaner\n\nLluis Domènech i Montaner was a highly talented architect with a very distinctive style. He created a number of magnificent buildings in the city of Barcelona, some of which can be visited.\n\nThe Palau de la Música Catalana\n\nVisit Palau de la Música Catalana is one of the most important concert halls in Catalonia. The building, originally created for the Orfeó Català, was designed by Domenèch i Montaner in 1905.\n\nThe Palau boasts stained glass windows, mosaics, sculptures and iron structures, all of which give it a very sumptuous appearance. The main music hall is absolutely dazzling, with multicolored stained glass on the ceiling.\n\nSant Pau Recinte\n\nThe beautiful modernist section of the Sant Pau hospital stands in the Horta-Guinardó district as a true testament to the architectural genius of Lluis Domenèch i Montaner. The area, now designated as Sant Pau Recinte ModernistaIt functioned like a hospital.\n\nHowever, in June 2009, a new, modern section of the hospital opened next door. La Recinte Modernista has begun restoration work to become a museum and cultural center.\n\nSant Pau Recinte Modernista and Palau de la Música Catalana do all the talking two UNESCO world heritage sites."
