        "text": "Domènech's entry on the block of beauties\n\nBuilt in 1864, this was one of the very first houses in the Eixample, but with all the other architectural fireworks happening around the Passeig de Gràcia, the owner, let Domènech i Montaner have his way with it in 1902. The result is the architect's most lavish residential project, the corner crowned with a dream-like ceramic cupola, the whole lathered with decoration inside and out by Domènech’s team of master decorators, led by sculptor Eusebi Arnau.\n\nFor Barcelona’s élite, wealth wasn’t the only thing to flaunt on a façade: the family’s interests, social status, business connections and hobbies were advertised as well. As the ground floor of the Casa Lleó Morera was destined to house a photographer’s studio, Arnau covered it with delightful nymphs and reliefs relating to electricity and cameras—all demolished in 1943 by Loewe of Madrid of leather goods fame, for larger shop windows (oh, those perfidious Castilians!)."
