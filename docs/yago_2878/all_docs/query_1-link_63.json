        "text": "MONDAY, AUGUST 1 AT 8:00PM\n\nGeneral Admission: $4 | Loft Members: $3\n\nPasses Accepted\n\nThe Blacktop Grill food truck will be at The Loft Cinema every Monday from 6pm – 9pm, serving delicious hot dogs, nachos and more!\n\nBlast off into the bad movie cosmos as Mondo Mondays presents 2022: A SPACE TRAVESTY, featuring an entire month’s worth of intergalactic oddities that are really out of this world!\n\n“Can you PROVE it didn’t happen?!?” Ed Wood, Jr.’s deliriously awful and totally hilarious tale of grave robbers from outer space running amok through 1950s Hollywood unleashes all the awe-inspiring special effects, head-scratching dialogue and Bela Lugosi stand-in’s you can handle, and has been called the worst movie ever made. While that’s probably true, it’s also an oddly loveable disaster; packed with genuine enthusiasm and undeniable charm, it’s obviously the work of a man who loved movies and loved making them, even if he displayed little visible talent in that particular area. In this epic tale of Cold War-era extraterrestrial invasion, sarcastic aliens in shiny ice- skating outfits zoom around in string-powered flying saucers to implement the dreaded “Ninth Plan” for Earth’s conquest (the first eight apparently failed), a brilliant plan fueled by an army of zombies (well, three actually): a feeble old man dressed in a Dracula costume (Bela Lugosi, in a legendary “post-mortum” performance completed with the stand-in help of a much taller chiropractor); the old man’s much younger and ghoulishly gorgeous wife (played by Vampira); and a remarkably chunky, quasi-unintelligible police officer (pro wrestler Tor Johnson). Cheap, goofy and out of control, the gloriously surreal, accidentally comical Plan 9 from Outer Space is perhaps the best Grade Z anti-masterpiece of all-time! (Dir. by Edward D. Wood Jr., 1959, 79 mins., Not Rated)"
