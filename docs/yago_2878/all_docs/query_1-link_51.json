        "text": "“Failure is not an option” in Ron Howard’s 1995 dramatization of NASA’s aborted Moon landing in April 1970. It was a mission plagued with problems before launch, especially when one of the crew members, Ken Mattingly (Gary Sinise), is replaced for medical reasons. But it seems like he got off easy when the three men who go up without him experience an explosion, depleted oxygen levels, low power, freezing conditions, and perhaps most tragically, the frustration of passing by the Moon with no chance to land on it and survive. That they make it home is a minor miracle, and a testament to the ingenuity of both the men aboard and those back in Houston.\n\nThe first of many documentaries on this list, Apollo 11 deserves a lofty ranking here. Unlike many of the other Apollo- or NASA-related documentaries before it, this one is comprised exclusively of archival footage, meaning no talking head documentaries to explain the importance of a particular person or moment after the fact. For younger viewers, it’s a little like experiencing the Moon landing like their parents did.\n\nBefore the Moon was within reach, orbiting the Earth was what NASA strived for, and that became possible thanks to the work of so many men and women, including the three primary characters featured in Theordore Melfi’s 2016 drama.\n\nAs female mathematicians, Katherine Goble Johnson (Taraji P. Henson), Dorothy Vaughn (Octavia Spencer), and Mary Jackson (Janelle Monae) must deal with sexism from their male superiors and subordinates who assume they’re secretaries, and as African-Americans, they face even more prejudice, including systemic things like having to walk a half mile or more to find a “colored” bathroom on NASA’s campus. Their triumph over these obstacles is inspiring, and the film serves as a wonderful historic document of women whose stories deserved to be more widely known.\n\nThis 1989 documentary by director Al Reinert was originally released like Apollo 11 was—using just archival footage of six of the Apollo missions—but audiences didn’t respond to that technique at the time. So it was redone with interviews Reinert did with 13 Apollo astronauts years earlier, and that version is a gold standard for not only space documentaries, but also non-fiction filmmaking.\n\nLike For All Mankind, this documentary directed by Brian Sington and presented by Ron Howard chronicles the history of the Apollo missions using a mix of archival footage and interviews. This one features 10 astronauts who either walked on or orbited the Moon, and because it’s 20 years younger than For All Mankind (and more than 30 years younger than most of that film’s interviews), it serves as a wonderful companion piece and depiction of the way memories and legacies shift.\n\nWhile not directly based on a space program, this film’s lead character, young Jake Gyllenhaal’s Homer Hickam, went on to become a NASA engineer as an adult. Growing up in rural West Virginia, Hickam was always meant to work in the coal mines like his father and his father’s father. But after the launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957, he becomes enthralled by rocketry, a hobby that is nurtured by an extremely caring and attentive science teacher (Laura Dern). Men and women of a certain age will have watched this one a dozen or so times when they had a substitute teacher in science class, but it holds up extremely well 20 years later.\n\nThis PBS miniseries was a pivotal moment in science TV, sparking the curiosity of a whole new generation when it aired in 1980. Brilliantly written by Carl Sagan, Ann Druyan, and Steven Soter, and presented by Sagan, the show jumps between theories of the creation and nature of the cosmos to other fascinating comparisons in history, biology, and fiction. The show’s excellent soundtrack, which included amazing songs by the late composer Vangelis, is a beautiful achievement. Neil deGrasse Tyson fronted a follow-up series subtitled A Spacetime Odyssey in 2014 which is also great, though many have more nostalgia for the original.\n\nMoving beyond NASA’s crewed missions, there are a lot of thinkers who have impacted the way we think about the entire universe, and one of the most influential is Stephen Hawking for his work in quantum mechanics and theories about black holes. His book, A Brief History of Time, walks readers through what we know or think we know about the universe dating all the way back to the Big Bang.\n\nThe documentary version of the book deviates a fair amount and instead focuses on Hawking’s life and struggle with ALS, but there’s still a great amount of information that Hawking makes digestible for a novice in a way that few geniuses like him can.\n\nIn 2014, a dramatization of Hawking’s life came out starring Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones (as Hawking’s wife, and later ex-wife, Jane). This version of Hawking’s story steers even further away from the origins of the universe, but fans of his will find a lot to love here. It’s based on Jane’s memoir, Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen, which makes it a great companion piece to the A Brief History of Time documentary.\n\nBefore Bryan Cranston became Walter White, he portrayed Buzz Aldrin in this 12-part, 1998 HBO miniseries that told the complete story of the Apollo program in the 1960s and ‘70s, from the origins of the Space Race to Apollo 17, the final lunar mission. From a stacked cast to inventive storytelling techniques, the Tom Hanks-produced masterwork feels as thrilling today as it did back then.\n\nIn 2017, a total solar eclipse swept across North America. NOVA captures the excitement of amateur astronomers and enthusiasts as well as NASA scientists who raced to set up experiments to study the eclipse. The agency launched weather balloons, sent aircraft into the skies and fixed a global network of telescopes at the sun as it shrank behind the moon. The documentary provides a fascinating look into one of the most dramatic cosmic events in recent years.\n\nThe Mercury 7 astronauts were among the biggest celebrities in the country during the late 1950s, but the lesser known Mercury 13 were accomplished and kick-ass women who passed the same physiological tests as Alan Shepard, John Glenn, and the rest but were nonetheless denied admittance into NASA’s space program. This Netflix documentary chronicles their efforts, as well as the institutional sexism that blocked their path to the stars and allowed the Soviets to beat the U.S. by 20 years when it came to sending a woman into space.\n\nDirected by Richard Linklater, Apollo 10 ½ looked back at his childhood watching the Apollo 11 moon landing, embellishing the real history with a fantastical narrative where a kid is plucked from his ordinary life for a lunar mission. The film used a process of translating animation onto live-action footage that Linklater had refined in earlier films Waking Life and A Scanner Darkly, and the animation style perfectly captured the nostalgic mood of the story here.\n\nNot all great programming about our quest to conquer space is “cinematic,” and of the great space miniseries out there, PBS’ Stellar is one of the freshest and easiest to digest. It premiered in June and runs for six mini-episodes (about seven minutes long a piece), and its knowledgeable hosts take viewers to labs around the country where some of space’s biggest questions—like, “What does a black hole look like?”—aren’t just being asked and explored, but also solved.\n\nThis is the first (of many) documentaries on this list with more of a forward-thinking mindset. Instead of resting on 50 years of laurels, director Paul Hildebrandt and his impressive array of interview subjects (including Bill Nye, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, retired NASA flight director Gene Kranz, and Apollo 13’s Jim Lovell) want to know why we haven’t been back to the Moon since the early 1970s, why we aren’t pushing more aggressively toward Mars, and why NASA’s funding levels have been stuck in neutral for decades.\n\nIn The Martian, Matt Damon forever shaped our perception of astronauts exploring Mars as individuals who are impossibly resourceful and determined (the type who can turn poop into potatoes), and this Netflix documentary reinforces it by introducing us to the men and women who want to be the next Mark Watney.\n\nThey’re all singularly focused (even if it means sacrificing a more traditional social life at school), and they’re frustrated by the apparent bureaucracy that has kept a crewed Mars mission at arm’s length so far. But they’re funny, brilliant, inspirational, and absolutely have the right stuff."
