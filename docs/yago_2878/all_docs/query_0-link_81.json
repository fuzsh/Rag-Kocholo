        "text": "A Disneyland TV Series Review, Disney+, Uncategorized\n\nA Disneyland TV Series Review #1 Man in Space 1955\n\nOkay at this point I’m just a giant shill for Disney+. As far as I’m concerned there is more stuff on Disney+ than I have time to see. I’m super excited that Disney+ has started adding some of the old episodes of the Disneyland Tv Series from back in the 1950’s. There are so many unique and interesting things on that show and then later on The Wonderful World of Color.\n\n“Man in Space” is an episode from the Disneyland TV show that aired in 1955 and was the first in a series of episodes relating to what would be Tomorrowland. The show was viewed by over 40 Million people at the time and I’m sure this look at the future of space was fascinating at the time it aired.\n\nIt was directed by Disney animator Ward Kimball who also narrated part of the special which featured many scientists from that period in time. The episode is basically an educational and entertaining look at man and his quest to go to space. It features the history of rockets, a discussion of how satellites will work. My personal favorite segment is a look of what the effects of space travel will be on humans featuring an animated everyman character.\n\nIt is so interesting to basically go back into a time machine and look at what they thought about space travel more than a decade before man would actually go to the moon. If you enjoy Retro stuff this old Disneyland specials will be right up your alley. I can’t wait for more treasures like this to make their way onto Disney+.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated"
