        "text": "Amna Nawaz:\n\nA new documentary explores the little known stories of the first Black pilots and engineers who became astronauts, pioneers of NASA's space program.\n\nGeoff Bennett has this look at the film \"The Space Race,\" which airs tonight on the National Geographic Channel and is streaming starting tomorrow on Disney+ and Hulu.\n\nIt's part of our arts and culture series, Canvas.\n\nGeoff Bennett:\n\nTo tell us more, we're joined now by one of the directors of the film, Lisa Cortes, and retired Major General Charles Bolden, an astronaut and former NASA administrator who's featured in the documentary.\n\nIt's so great to have you both here.\n\nMaj. Gen. Charles Bolden (RET.), Former NASA Administrator: Great to be here. Thank you.\n\nAnd, Charlie Bolden, it's always an honor to get to speak with you, in large part because you have had such a distinguished career in the military and in the space program, retired Marine Corps major general, NASA administrator during the Obama administration. You flew on four space shuttle missions.\n\nMaj. Gen. Charles Bolden:\n\nI came from the segregated South, so I grew up in Columbia, South Carolina, my wife and me.\n\nAnd at the age of 12, I saw a program called \"Men of Annapolis\" about life at the Naval Academy, decided that's where I wanted to go to school, so that was my goal and life from then on, and met with the obstacle when I was finally at the high school and I could apply that nobody in the South Carolina delegation was going to appoint a Black to any service academy.\n\nAnd so I was just overwhelmed by disappointment. But I learned that the vice president of the United States can make an appointment of anybody. And that was Lyndon Johnson at the time. So I began to write him over years, never heard from him, but subsequently got a visit from a Navy recruiter, and then a retired federal judge from right here in D.C., Judge Bennett, who came around at the behest of President Johnson looking for qualified young men, only men back then, to go to the service academies.\n\nI ended up getting an appointment from Congressman William Dawson in Chicago, Illinois, and I was off to the Naval Academy.\n\nGeoff Bennett:\n\nLisa Cortes, there are any number of stories you could tell as an award-winning producer and director. Why tell this one?\n\nLisa Cortes, Director, \"The Space Race\": I am always intrigued by the hidden figures, people and stories that we think we know about. But, actually, when you start to pull back the layers, you discover the contributors who have not had their time in the spotlight.\n\nAnd to be able to focus on the beginning of the program and Ed Dwight's journey as we trace it then to the shuttle era men and to the present was something that was missing in the popular narratives being told and just so rich in detail and legacy.\n\nMaj. Gen. Charles Bolden:\n\nHe did not work out very simply because he was the dream of one person, and that was President Kennedy. When President Kennedy was assassinated, within weeks, if not days, any dream of him becoming an astronaut was gone, because they just took him out of the line of people who were potential astronauts.\n\nNASA went through a selection that year, and he was not among those that was selected, although everybody had given him the expectation that he would be. And the explanations — the funny thing is, there are no explanations. So even to this day, you have his story from him, but there is no one on the other side to tell the opposing story.\n\nIt's just everybody says, no, we have never heard of that.\n\nMaj. Gen. Charles Bolden:\n\nHe's the first Black astronaut to go to the International Space Station. So that will tell you.\n\nAnd Victor and I have this thing that there was, I want to say, a 20-year gap between when I became the second Black pilot to fly in space, to get into NASA's astronaut program, and Victor became the third. So we seem to go in these decadal upgrades to the system, which just tells you that, in this kind of activity, you have got to be persistent and you have got to have a pipeline through which people go.\n\nAnd that — Lisa's movie, hopefully, this is the right time for it because you're hearing a lot of ridiculous stuff about the lack of qualifications of Blacks and women in fields like aviation and everything else, which is absolutely absurd. So you can't argue with what is documented in this particular movie.\n\nMaj. Gen. Charles Bolden:\n\nNo, I — what I have always said is that Black history is American history, and we all play a role in the history of this country.\n\nWe're on this constant march toward a more perfect union. And my point to everyone, and I think what Lisa is saying is what this movie will hopefully portray is, we deny Black history, American history, at our own peril. If we choose to ignore it and choose to pretend that you and I don't exist or you and I didn't contribute to this phenomenal country that remains the greatest country on the planet, you do that at your own peril.\n\nWe have been through this once. We have been through this game. We have been to this show. The scary part about what we're going through today is the fact that we know the end if we keep going down this road of trying to pretend that people who played one of the most important roles in the space program, if you're talking about people like Katherine Johnson, the hidden figures, you cannot eradicate them from the story, because there are too many people who participated in that story.\n\nJohn Glenn, when he was here on the planet, would tell you, that was the difference in him saying, I'm going and I'm not going was this young Black woman who had done the math and told him that everything was going to be OK.\n\nYou can deny that, you can pretend it didn't happen, but you have got other people who are around who will tell you, no, buddy, we weren't going had it not been for Katherine Johnson. And that's important. It's important for young kids to understand that."
