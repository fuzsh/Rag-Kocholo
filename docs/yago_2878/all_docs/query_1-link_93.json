        "text": "Where can you go when your last movie made £1.2B and involved flying actual jets? Space, apparently. Not content with dominating the box office on planet earth, Tom Cruise will be filming his next movie in the International Space Station. He'll also be shooting parts of it outside the space station. Yes, like in actual space. Possibly the most unsurprising news of all time, because when you've scaled the world's tallest building, hung off the side of a helicopter and promoted a movie from the wing of a plane, then really the only place left to get your adrenaline kicks is the final frontier.\n\nOriginally cropping up in 2020, the as-yet-unnamed venture into space has picked up steam again this week after Universal seemingly confirmed their eagerness for the project to go ahead. According to the BBC, chairman of Universal Filmed Entertainment Group, Donna Langley, says Cruise and director Doug Liman pitched her the idea over video call during the pandemic. In classic Cruise action fashion, it's about a man who needs to “go up to space to save the day”. Yep, while we were all doing our 186th consecutive Zoom quiz, Tom Cruise was apparently trying to get a ticket on a rocket ship. But it worked, as Langley says: “We have a great project in development with Tom, that does contemplate him doing just that. Taking a rocket up to the space station and shooting and hopefully being the first civilian to do a spacewalk outside of the space station.”\n\nLiman and Cruise have teamed up multiple times over the course of their careers, most notably with The Edge of Tomorrow. Per IMDB, the movie is a collaboration with Elon Musk's SpaceX, with the use of their Dragon plane, which has been built to fly civilians into space. Long-time Cruise collaborator Chris McQuarrie is also involved, having worked most recently on the box office-destroying Top Gun: Maverick and the Mission Impossible franchise. McQuarrie is no stranger to watching Cruise take on some hell-raising stunts, in fact, this trip into orbit might not even be that much of a shock, as the pair also worked together on the ill-fated Dark Universe reboot of The Mummy, where Cruise and co-star Annabel Wallis took on a stunt in zero gravity. So it really could be one small step for man on this one, so long as the man is Tom Cruise."
