KImball created a thumb print self portrait sketch which he would draw and sign for fans. Here, he boldly signed our inscribed sketch, \"Ward Kimball.\" The ears on his head give a clear nod to Mickey Mouse. Kimball was one of the Academy Award winning chief animators on Disney's classic films, one of the group of animators known as the Nine Old Men. Autograph (Inventory #: 4822)"
