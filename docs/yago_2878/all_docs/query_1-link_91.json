I'm Steve Inskeep with my best movie announcer voice.\n\n(Imitating announcer) In a world where Russia has the first-ever feature film shot in space, an actor and producer joined a real-life cosmonaut on the International Space Station for a film called \"The Challenge.\"\n\nThey add this to the first satellite, first dog and first man and woman in space. Technically, it's out of this world, but out next month.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF EXPLOSION)\n\nINSKEEP: It's MORNING EDITION.\n\nCopyright © 2023 NPR. All rights reserved.
