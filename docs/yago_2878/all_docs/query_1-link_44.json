        "text": "As someone who was/is a big fan of Jeffrey St. Jules’s first feature, Bang Bang Baby (2014), I was excited, to say the least, to see that he had a new feature called The Silent Planet with a premise that was surely set to some tensions up and create another film that is sure to divide audiences. This is not to say that this doesn’t happen with The Silent Planet, but what it does deliver instead are two character studies that get lost in the nearly deserted planet the film takes place on, leaving the audience wishing for more breathable air.\n\nThe film focuses on Theodore (Elias Koteas), the sole resident of this forsaken planet, sentenced to spend the rest of eternity, which for him isn’t long as he’s terminally ill, cleaning it and going on about his life alone. This is something he has rather come to terms with and no longer is bothered by, however, this all changes when Niyya (Briana Middleton) arrives as she is also sentenced to a life sentence but chose a planet she believed was deserted so she could serve in solitude and not be bothered by anyone or anything. Upon Niyya’s arrival, Theodore is overjoyed someone else is on the planet with him now, and eventually works Niyya to allow him to enter her space and possibly co-exist together on this planet. However, things take a turn when Theodore’s mind starts playing potential tricks on him, making him think he really is Nathan Flanagan, the man who is responsible for killing Niyya’s entire family. Due to his condition, he only remembers the name and has no recollection of the event causing tensions to rise between Niyya and himself as she believes he is the man who took everything from her, and he is playing dumb and in denial of said accusations. While tensions grow, unease sets over them as they slowly realize both of their life sentences may be served very soon unless one takes out the other first.\n\nThe Silent Planet creates a world of unease and questionability for its audience to ponder, consistently making them think about what they would do if they were in the situation of either character, how they would react if someone told them the person they have a hazy memory of was responsible for killing their entire family and how we would react if confronted by that person. It creates a world of unease and tension that sits and stews with the audience, but the lack of atmosphere (metaphorically and figuratively) slowly chokes the audience, as well. They want something to explode, we want some catalyst event to take place between these characters, and while something does inevitably happen, it nearly takes too long to get there. There isn’t enough substance between the introduction and conclusion to get the audience fully engaged. However, this very well may be intentional as being told from the perspective of Theodore/Nathan, someone whose memory is foggy and shaken already, also tied with what happens to the human mind and complexity of being left isolated for all that time, certainly plays a trick on our brains. While the theory is ever-present, keeping that in mind while viewing the film will create results that varies on mileage.\n\nMoreover though, The Silent Planet may be confined to two people and two performances to anchor everything together, but it works marvelously. Elias Koteas (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles; Janet Planet) creates these two separate characters at a frail state while they explore themselves to know if the information they’re being given is true all while they each fight their own urge for self-preservation. His performance juxtaposes Briana Middleton’s (Sharper) Niyya, who wanted to evoke justice while she had nothing else to lose. Both performances are grounded and focused on humanity and the fragility that comes with being human.\n\nWhile Jeffrey St. Jules may not be making movies that a complete mainstream audience can get behind and find salvation in, what they do manage to craft are stories that are never linear and focused on the black and white. Always choosing to live in a grey space provides new insight and intrigue into the storytelling, and that is where The Silent Planet shines. Just a little more depth to the accusations, some extra clarity, and maybe an extra layer of the non-questionable would’ve elevated The Silent Planet to a little more oxygen and voice.\n\nScreening during Fantasia International Film Festival 2024.\n\nFor more information, head to the official Fantasia International Film Festival 2024 The Silent Planet webpage.\n\nFinal Score: 3.5 out of 5."
