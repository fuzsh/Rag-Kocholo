        "text": "A Rhode Island flower farm will play a starring role in the upcoming film, \"Space Oddity,\" directed by actress Kyra Sedgwick and featuring her husband, Kevin Bacon.\n\nThe movie was filmed at Robin Hollow Farm in Saunderstown over the course of about 2½ weeks in July, co-owner Mike Hutchison said. Many of the scenes were shot in the farm's fields and greenhouse, while others were filmed in the farmhouse on the property where Hutchison and his wife and co-owner, Polly, live.\n\nThe movie tells the story of a young man who plans to leave Earth for a one-way mission to Mars until he \"develops an unexpected romance\" with an enigmatic newcomer, according to a news release in June from the Rhode Island Film and Television Office.\n\nIn the movie, the young man's family owns a flower farm, which is where Robin Hollow comes in, Hutchison explained. The farm, he said, first got a call from Sedgwick this past winter — on the day before Valentine's Day.\n\n\"She didn't realize it was a busy time for us,\" Hutchison said.\n\n'I got to show Kevin Bacon how to drive a tractor'\n\nThat was the first of many lessons that the cast and crew would end up learning about the flower business. Before filming began, the Hutchisons taught the actors how to cut flowers, design arrangements and conduct other farm chores, such as laying down drip tape for irrigation.\n\n\"I got to show Kevin Bacon how to drive a tractor,\" Mike Hutchison said.\n\nBefore filming began, Sedgwick and her staff shadowed Hutchison and his staff, allowing them to see what goes into a typical day in the life of a flower farm.\n\nThe crew \"took pictures of everything\" and later modeled the costumes worn in the film on the clothing that the real-life farmers had been wearing out in the fields, Hutchison said.\n\nThe fictional flower farm that appears in the movie also will have the name Robin Hollow, Hutchison said, so there was a strong incentive to \"try to make it feel as real as possible.\"\n\nReal life meets reel life on the set\n\nThe Hutchisons continued to live and work on the farm while the movie was filmed, which presented some logistical challenges.\n\nThe cast and crew typically worked 12- to 14-hour days, sometimes getting a start at 8 a.m. and other times at 3 p.m. When filming ran late into the night, the Hutchisons would find another place to stay so that they could get some sleep.\n\n\"Probably the hardest thing was they were shooting in our house,\" Hutchison said, noting that the crew \"moved everything around.\"\n\nStill, the experience was a positive one: Hutchison said that Sedgwick, Bacon and the rest of the cast and crew were \"a nice group of folks\" and \"really pleasant to work with.\"\n\nSince the Hutchisons tend to be busiest toward the end of the week, when they're preparing for weekend weddings and farmers markets, the crew shifted its filming schedule accordingly. And the actors were extremely \"generous with their time,\" making a point of introducing themselves to neighbors and the farm's other employees, Hutchison said.\n\n\"All the cast were really friendly,\" he said. \"Kyra is just as sweet as can be. You see her on TV — that's who she really is.\"\n\nMore: Kevin Bacon, Kyra Sedgwick making movie in North Kingstown\n\nIn fact, Sedgwick was so \"sweet and complimentary\" that she talked the Hutchisons into allowing the crew to film inside their home,\n\nLogistical support from state DEM\n\nFilming took place between July 6 and 22, Hutchison said. The cast and crew had a \"home base\" in Wickford where they would get into costumes and makeup before being shuttled down to the farm.\n\nEven so, most days of filming required having somewhere between 50 and 60 people on the small farm, plus numerous trucks.\n\n\"That's a lot on 2½ acres,\" Hutchison said.\n\nThe Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management helped with the logistics by allowing the film crew to park and set up a food tent on the property next to the farm, which used to be Camp Nokewa and now is a state-owned wildlife management area.\n\nFilming at the farm likely \"wouldn't have been possible\" without the DEM's cooperation, Hutchison said.\n\nRobin Hollow landed on the filmmakers' radar because it's one of the closest flower farms to Wickford, where Sedgwick and her team had already decided that they wanted to be based, Hutchison said.\n\nSedgwick and Bacon own a home in Connecticut, so they had wanted to shoot the film in New England. Though they originally had looked at Vermont, they also wanted to be near the coast, which made Rhode Island a more appealing option.\n\nMore: Kyra Sedgwick: Rhode Island offers 'magical' places to film her movie\n\nThe producers also worked with the Rhode Island Film and Television Office and were able to get tax credits for filming in the state, according to Hutchison.\n\nIn addition to having a home base in Wickford, the team set up an office on Sims Street in Providence's Valley neighborhood, and held a wrap party at nearby Revival Brewing Co.\n\nFarm joins list of other RI film locations\n\nOther scenic Rhode Island spots that have appeared on the big screen — such as the Jamestown cove that was featured in \"Moonrise Kingdom\" — have become a draw for tourists. Hutchison said that since Robin Hollow Farm isn't really open to the public, they're hoping to avoid a flood of visitors.\n\nBut the farm soon will be opening a year-round retail space inside Farm Fresh Rhode Island's new Sims Avenue headquarters, and the Hutchisons are hopeful that the buzz from the movie will encourage people to visit them there.\n\nFor now, that's all on the horizon: Hutchison said that the last he's heard is that the movie's producers will wrap up editing this fall and submit it to Sundance and other film festivals next year.\n\n\"We're looking forward to seeing it.\""
