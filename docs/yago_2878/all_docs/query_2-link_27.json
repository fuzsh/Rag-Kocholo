        "text": "Probably the least surprising thing about me is I have a favorite of the Nine Old Men and it’s Ward Kimball.\n\nThis is an anti-LBJ short where his nose gets so hard that it comes American propaganda. Maybe not the most groundbreaking political commentary of all-time but it’s fun to imagine that -had he not died two years earlier- this would’ve killed Walt Disney.\n\nAnyway, Ward Kimball rules.\n\nAnimation Challenge 2019-Week 18: Watch a Film by one of Disney's 9 Old Men\n\nThis short is just over two minutes without credits (it's definitely one of the shortest films I've watched for this challenge) so it may feel like cheating to some, but in the context of Ward Kimball's career and the 'Nine Old Men' in particular, it's an interesting artifact, opening with a grotesque caricature of LBJ whose nose seems to be caught somewhere between Pinocchio and a Weapon of Mass Destruction before it explodes, triggering a sudden montage of Americana (Fast Food, Heroic GIs) Carnal imagery (Naked breasts!) and explosions that mirror the opening credits of Daisies-an assault that lasts about 45 seconds before the whole darned thing collapses on itself. Short and not exactly subtle, the film is especially notable when considering the fact that it was made independently of Disney, who might have found it a little too...........political?\n\nA short by Ward Kimball, one of Disney's famous \"Nine Old Men\", that is a criticism of Lyndon B. Johnson's *escalation* of the War in Vietnam. He does this first with a depiction of LBJ as a parade float, and his phallic nose getting longer and more pronounced, eventually resulting in a climax, leading into a montage of explosions, tits, americana, and carnage.\n\nVery not Disney. Very good.\n\nA very short anti-Johnson short from Ward Kimball, one of Disney studios 'nine old men'. Johnson's nose grows like a phallic Pinocchio, and bursts. There is a bombing montage showing various pop culture icons of the sixties.\n\nI only found out about the cartoon last night while looking up the nine old men. It's there on YouTube to check out, if the need arises."
