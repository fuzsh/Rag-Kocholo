        "text": "For the episode, see MST3K 305 - Stranded in Space.\n\nStranded in Space is a made-for-TV movie that was the pilot for a potential series called The Stranger created by Gerald Sanford. It was directed by Lee H. Katzin.\n\nPlot[]\n\nAmerican astronaut Neil Stryker becomes lost on a mission in outer space and finds himself stranded on a mirror image Earth called \"Terra\" that is on the opposite side of the sun.\n\nThis planet is led by a single worldwide government that is menacing and oppressive. This government, called the \"Perfect Order\" maintains order through the use of strange radio broadcasts and \"Ward E\", a place where malcontents and other threats to the Perfect Order are lobotomized.\n\nStryker becomes a fugitive and must decide if he will attempt to return to Earth or help to liberate the people of Terra.\n\nCast[]\n\nGlenn Corbett as Neil Stryker\n\nJerry Douglas as Steve (astronaut)\n\nArch Whiting as Mike (astronaut)\n\nTim O'Connor as Dr. Revere\n\nCameron Mitchell as Benedict\n\nH.M. Wynant as Eric Stoner\n\nSharon Acker as Dr. Bettina Cooke\n\nWilliam Bryant as Truck Driver\n\nSteve Franken as Henry Maitland\n\nGeorge Coulouris as the Bookseller\n\nLew Ayres as Prof. Dylan MacAuley\n\nDean Jagger as Carl Webster\n\nVirginia Gregg as Ward E Administrator\n\nSteven Marlo as Guard\n\nBen Wright as space complex doctor\n\nBuck Young as Tom Nelson\n\nNotes[]\n\nIn this FVI release, the opening credits appear over scenes from the movie Prisoners of the Lost Universe, which became a RiffTrax presentation in 2012. The original opening credits are shown with Stryker's ship in outer space as a background, while the original closing credits are displayed over a still of Stryker on the beach at the end of the movie.\n\nGamera vs Guiron (used in Experiment #312) also featured a twin planet called Terra orbiting 180Â° opposite the Earth. The premise is flawed since the Earth's orbit is not a perfect circle. Any twin planet would appear in the sky at times during the year, and would have been observed after sunset by ancient astronomers.\n\nThough not explicitly mentioned in the film, Outlaw is also set on a planet orbiting opposite the Earth, though that planet is named Gor.\n\nActor Glenn Corbett is also known for having played the original Zefram Cochrane on Star Trek.\n\nThe book shop proprietor is played by George Colouris, who played Mr. Thatcher in Citizen Kane. He is one of the few actors from that highly-regarded film to appear in a movie used by Mystery Science Theater 3000 (though Citizen Kane actor William Alland later produced several films used by MST3K). His nephew Keith Colouris appeared in Doctor Mordrid.\n\nMST3K Connections[]\n\nCameron Mitchell also portrayed Alex Jansen in Space Mutiny.\n\nSteve Franken also portrayed Danny McKee in The Time Travelers and Henry McDade in Avalanche.\n\nH.M. Wynant also portrayed the flight director in Hangar 18.\n\nWilliam Bryant (truck driver) also portrayed Dr. Ralph Martin in King Dinosaur.\n\nVirginia Gregg also portrayed the nurse in The Bubble.\n\nBuck Young also portrayed Detective Aldridge in Mitchell.\n\nAlan Foster (unspecified role) also portrayed the jeweler in The Brute Man.\n\nBob Harks (policeman) also portrayed a lab tech in Riding with Death.\n\nComposer Richard Markowitz was also composer for The Magic Sword.\n\nMakeup artist Jack H. Young was also makeup artist for War of the Colossal Beast.\n\nCostumer Oscar Rodriguez did wardrobe for The Magic Sword, I Was a Teenage Werewolf, and The Phantom Planet."
