        "text": "What Is a Reel on Instagram?\n\nInstagram Reels are short-form Instagram videos that can be up to 90 seconds long.\n\nUsers can record, edit, and clip videos and photos together, set them to music, and post to their feed.\n\nSince their inception, Instagram Reels have been a great way for brands and creators to flex their creativity, and extend their reach.\n\n“Since introducing Reels to our Instagram channel, we’ve seen our engagement grow by 280%,” shares Later’s Social Media Manager, Christine Colling.\n\nWhy? Unlike other types of Instagram posts (e.g. carousels), Reels has its own tab on the home feed navigation bar, making them more discoverable.\n\nPlus, short-form video is very in right now.\n\nPlan, schedule, and analyze your Instagram Reels content with Later's social media management tools. Get started today — for free!\n\nWhat’s the Difference Between Instagram Reels and TikTok?\n\nWhile Reels and TikTok videos are strikingly similar, there is a difference.\n\nFrom demographics to editing tools, they serve different purposes.\n\nOn TikTok, filters are super popular — users can choose from a number of effects, templates, and filters:\n\nWhile the video and special effects on Instagram Reels are more limited, they still have their own editing perks.\n\nWith Instagram Reels Templates, users can quickly copy clip timings of an existing Reel — saving tons of time and effort:\n\nThe TikTok “For You” Page (FYP) is also very customized to your interests, whereas Instagram is still fine-tuning its Explore page algorithm to be more personalized for users:\n\nIt’s also important to note that while both platforms offer the same type of content, the demographic on TikTok skews younger than Instagram (between ages 16-24).\n\nIn comparison, nearly half of Instagram’s audience falls within the 25-34 age range.\n\nSo, with that in mind, if you’re looking to reach a Gen Z audience, TikTok may be the place to be.\n\nBut if you’re looking to buffer up your Instagram strategy and grow your following, Instagram Reels is a great place to start.\n\nNeed help staying on top of trends?

No matter what your brand or business does, there’s a niche for you!\n\nIf you’re a bakery, you could go behind-the-scenes in the kitchen like @jennaraecakes.\n\nOr, if you’re a skincare brand, you could provide product tips like @glowrecipe:\n\nEven if your first few Reels don’t garner a ton of traction or engagement, keep going.\n\nJust like anything else on social media, it’s all about trial and error.\n\nAnother great way for brands to connect with a niche audience? Working with influencers and creators, of course.\n\nLater's influencer marketing platform, Later Influence, makes it easy to find influencers who make creative content in your niche. Book a demo here to see how it works.\n\nIncluding 3-5 hashtags can be a great way to help the Instagram algorithm understand your content and serve it to relevant audiences.\n\nFor example, using hashtags like #VeganRecipes, #PlantBased, and #WhatVegansEat will indicate to the Instagram Reels algorithm that your content is about vegan cooking — which may increase the likelihood of it being served to users who are actively engaging with similar content:\n\nEvery little bit helps!\n\nTIP: For some hashtag inspiration, check out Later’s Hashtag Suggestion feature.
