        "text": "Podcast Listener Demographics\n\nâ\n\nPodcast Listener Numbers: How Many People Listen to Podcasts?\n\nIn 2023 there were over 450 million podcasts, and it seems like this number is only growing\n\nAs of 2023, according to the Infinite Dial, 64% of Americans will have listened to a podcast ever in their lives. This is an estimated 183 million Americans and an increase from 57%, the percentage of the same statistic in 2021.Â Â\n\nFrom this figure, 38% of Americans listened to a podcast in the last month and 26% in the last week.\n\nThese are large numbers considering Insider Intelligence estimates that going into 2024 there are around 464 million podcast listeners worldwide.\n\nWho Listens To Podcasts?\n\n50% of monthly U.S. podcast listeners are aged between 12-34, 43% between 35 and 54 years old, and 22% are aged over 55.\n\nIn 2019, around half of monthly podcast listeners had a full-time job(51%), 17% of whom hadve a household income between $100K-$150K. 28% have a university degree.\n\nSo what? Based on their education and employment statistics, regular podcast listeners have the power to make purchasing decisions and interest in products that will make their daily lives easier. Using these stats, you can strategize how to monetize your podcast.\n\nHow Often Do People Listen to Podcasts?\n\nThe 26% of Americans who listened to podcasts in the last week listened to an average of 8 podcasts throughout the week.\n\nIn 2019, a report revealed that 22% percent of podcast fans listen to over 22 hours of podcasts a week!Â Â\n\nThe same report revealed that 35% listen to more than 10 different shows per month.\n\nSo what? Aim to reach those âsuper listenersâ who listen to 20+ hours of podcasts a week and youâll create a loyal fan base. Cross-promote your show on podcasts similar to yours and access new listeners who share your interests.\n\nWhere Do Most People Listen to Podcasts?\n\nLooking back at 2021, podcasts were most often listened to at home with only 20% of listeners reporting that they listen in the car while commuting and 59% preferring to listen at home.\n\nSo what? Use these statistics to define the length of your podcast: the average podcast length - 25 and 30 minutes - reflects the length of the average commute in the U.S. These numbers can also help you to target your podcast ads to what your audience is doing when listening.\n\nHow Do People Listen To Podcasts?\n\nAccording to Statistaâs 2020 study, the top platforms and apps for listening to podcasts are Spotify (25% of listeners) and Apple Podcasts (20%).\n\nIn 2019, 65% of people prefer listening to podcasts on their smartphone or tablet and 25% use a desktop computer. 10% listen on smart speakers like Google Nest and Amazon Echo. This trend has stayed similar with 73% of listeners using their cell phones over computers for podcast listening.\n\nSo what? Your show needs to be findable on the top podcast directories i.e. Spotify and Apple Podcasts. Itâs also essential to optimize your content - the name of your podcast and its episode titles - for voice-activated smart speakers.\n\nWhere Do People Find Podcasts?\n\nThe main ways that people discover new podcasts to listen to are via charts and recommendations on their podcast listening app; through word of mouth from friends; promotions on other podcasts and on social media platforms or websites.\n\nSo what? Almost 60% of podcasters report building an audience as a top challenge, so use these statistics to reach new listeners:\n\nPush your show up the in-app charts by encouraging your listeners to subscribe to your podcast in your podcast intro and recommend it to friends\n\nShare your podcast across your social media accounts; work with relevant influencers to promote your show to their audiences\n\nWork with other podcasters to promote each othersâ shows\n\nWhy Do People Listen To Podcasts?\n\n74% of podcast listeners tune in to learn new things, while others listen regularly for entertainment, to keep up to date, to relax, and for inspiration.\n\nEqually important is why *donât* people listen to podcasts. Almost 50% of non-listeners say they donât know where to find podcasts, while others report being overwhelmed by the number and choice of shows out there.Â\n\nSo what? Ensuring your show is engaging and offers value to your listeners is essential. It also needs to be findable on the main podcast directories. This may sound like a no-brainer, but producing studio-quality podcasts is also key, as a third of people claim low podcast quality is the reason they donât listen.\n\nRecord on Riverside for professional-quality podcasts, no matter your skill level.

Platforms like Riverside allow you to record high-quality audio (and video!) wherever you are, facilitating remote podcast recording without sacrificing sound or visual quality.\n\nAverage Podcast Length\n\nWe mentioned the average length of a podcast episode is 25 to 30 minutes, but length varies greatly across genres.\n\nSo what? For podcasts starting out, itâs best to keep your show short and concise. Once youâve got a loyal listener base, your episodes can go much longer and your fans will listen no matter what. The key is making sure to hook your listeners right at the start of your episode because podcasts lose between 20 to 35 percent of listeners in the first five minutes.Â\n\nAverage Podcast Frequency & Schedule\n\nAccording to Buzzsproutâs global statistics, around 35% of podcasts publish an episode on their hosting platform every 3 to 7 days, and 40% every 8 to 14 days.\n\nSo what? Learning how to schedule your podcast will help you to produce regular, engaging content to keep your listeners interested.\n\nâ\n\nMost popular posting times\n\nAccording to Podbean the most popular days and times to publish podcasts are:\n\nWed 7 pm EST\n\nMon 8 am EST\n\nMon 9 am EST\n\nTue 9 am EST\n\nMon 10 am EST\n\nSo what? You want to put your content out when your audience is active. Looking at popular publishing times can help, but we actually suggest analyzing your audience or target audience more closely. When are they most active online? It won't help to publish a podcast in an ideal EST time, when you may be in another timezone.\n\nPodcasts Making Money: Statistics\n\nPodcast Revenue\n\nPodcasting can be a great source of potential revenue through brand sponsorships, ads, and membership sites.

However, another study reported that 58% would skip a podcast ad.\n\nSo what? Use the podcast statistics above and our guide to monetizing your podcast to target your ads and sponsorships to your listener profile.â\n\nFAQs on Podcast Statistics\n\nHow do I find podcast stats?\n\nYou can easily find out podcast stats by looking at metrics online.
