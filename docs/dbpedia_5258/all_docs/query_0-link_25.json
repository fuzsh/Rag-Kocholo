It either happens when your on a very old version of minecraft or if you have an old device. I was on a Wiiu and my minecraft slowly got more and more buggy until all of the mobs were just floating in air and not moving, despawning quickly. It may be for you that your device and the app file is corrupt. Try reinstalling minecraft. If that doesn't work you may need a new device.\n\nanswered Mar 11, 2021 at 20:04\n\nDabbingsdednowDabbingsdednow\n\n1,01855 silver badges2020 bronze badges"
