        "text": "“Dear Sir or Madam,\n\nI am writing to you because of my interest in the film The Cure for Insomnia by John Henry Timmis IV. According to the film’s entry in the Internet Movie Database (IMDb) it was a School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) production. This is the only lead the internet gives as to whom might know something about the film’s current state.\n\nThis email is addressed to both the Video Data Bank (where I was unable to find The Cure for Insomnia) and the Film, Video, New Media, and Animation Office at SAIC. If your outfit can not provide me with any information would you be able to tell me who I might write to instead?\n\nMy interest to the film was brought out during an experiment I set-up to test the circadian rhythm, the almost-but-not-quite 24-hour cycle of being awake and asleep. We had to be cut-off from outside interference like sunlight and Wikipedia was one of the few things to offer us interesting things to read. A film called The Cure for Insomnia was too good not to be noticed.\n\nI would like to watch the film but it seems Wikipedia is right in stating ‘it was never released to the public’. None of the usual channels (eBay, Amazon, Play, The Pirate Bay, isoHunt) turned up anything.\n\nMy question to you is: is there any way to get the film? Either for personal (household) viewing or possibly for a small-scale public viewing at the local library?\n\nMaybe the question should be whether the film still exists within your archives, but I like to be positive and assume you have not destroyed a film that once held a world record.\n\nOther questions that might be more appropriate on this matter are who owns the rights to the film and if it would be possible to make it available through means like the Internet Archive (a non-profit trying to build an online library to preserve digital works and artifacts: archive.org)?\n\nI would think it a shame if the film was to disappear in the mists of time. There is nothing worse than art that cannot be viewed and I hope you hold that same believe at heart.\n\nI am looking forward to hear back from you.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nMartijn van der Ven\n\n[Address redacted]\n\n(This email and, unless you will explicitly forbid me to, your answer will be published online on http://forum.camendesign.com/can_you_help_me_find_the_cure_for_insomnia_.)”\n\n“Dear Mr Groban,\n\nI’m writing you via Facebook, which I hope you won’t mind, because of the high costs linked to sending paper correspondence from Europe to the United States.\n\nI did upload this same text, fountain pen written, to my web server so you can print it and still have the hand-written letter feel. You can find it here: [Link redacted: contains my address]\n\nI’m trying to track down the experimental film The Cure for Insomna by J.T. IV and yourself. Of all the longest films to ever go public this one is the only one that seems to make a point, although vaguely.\n\nThe Internet Movie Database lists The School of the Art Institute of Chicago as production company so I started there. I’ve written both the Film, Video, New Media, and Animation Office, and the Video Data Bank. Only the latter responded to inform me they didn’t know where to find the film.\n\nYou can read the actual correspondence at: forum.camendesign.com/can_you_help_me_find_the_cure_for_insomnia_\n\nWith Timmis unfortunate and premature passing you are the only one left I can phrase the following questions to.\n\nDo you own a copy of the film, in any form? Do you know who might have access to this material? Finally, do you know who might hold the rights to the materials—if the materials still exist?\n\nIt would be very sad if even in today’s information age we can’t be bothered to save a single film. A film that once held a world record at that.\n\nIf not the film, is your poem published anywhere? In full?\n\nThanks for your time and I hope you will be able to help me. And again, I apologise for the use of Facebook to reach out to you.\n\nWith kind regards,\n\nMartijn van der Ven\n\n[Address redacted]”"
