        "text": "\"I’ll never forget the feeling of gratitude that washed over me when I saw those platelets going into my husband’s body. I imagined the faces of many different strangers, taking time out of their day… their jobs… their families… their lives... to sit in a chair and give part of themselves away, simply because it is a good thing to do for another human being. A stranger. Someone’s platelets made their way to Phil that day, and it helped him recover.”\n\nCassie Brabbs describing how it felt to see platelets help save her husband Phil\n\n\"She was a new person comparing our drive to the hospital on Friday and when we left the hospital Friday night! I just can’t put it in to words!”\n\nMegan Stoy describing how platelets help her daughter Olivia who is fighting cancer\n\n\"The truly frustrating thing about cancer, is that it makes a person feel helpless... I made a decision to begin donating blood or platelets. I couldn't help Doug, but maybe I could help someone else.\"\n\nTess, who lost her husband to cancer, on how she could help others"
