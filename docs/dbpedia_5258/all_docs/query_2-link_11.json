The film has no plot, instead featuring artist L.D. Groban reading his 4,080-page poem \"A Cure for Insomnia\" over the course of three and a half days, with interspersed clips from heavy metal and pornographic videos. It was first shown at The School of the Art Institute in Chicago, Illinois from January 31 to February 3, 1987, but was never released for public viewing. If it had been available on DVD, it would have been a 22-disc set.\n\nSee also[]\n\nList of longest films by running time\n\n[]\n\nThe Cure for Insomnia at IMDb\n\nThis page uses content from the English Wikipedia.
