        "text": "Upload and embed videos on your pages to engage with your visitors.\n\nUse video on your site to express your brand, tell better stories, and keep your visitors engaged. You can embed videos from third-party services in most places on your site. In videos pages, video blocks, and section backgrounds, you can upload your own videos. Use this guide to learn where you can add videos, and find links to specific steps for adding videos to your site. On Squarespace, you can:\n\nEmbed videos - Embed videos from YouTube, Vimeo, Animoto, and Wistia. These services are highly respected for their streaming quality, upload ease, and video playback control.\n\nUpload videos - Host your videos on your site. This option is available for video blocks on all sites and videos pages and section backgrounds on version 7.1 sites. Every Squarespace site can have up to 30 minutes of uploaded video. For more storage, subscribe to a Digital Products plan.\n\nTip: With the Marketing Kit in the iOS Squarespace app, you can create professional quality videos that match the design and branding of your site. You can then embed or upload the videos to your site.\n\nWatch a video\n\nWhere you can add videos\n\nWhere you can add videos depends on your site's version.\n\nOption 1 - Embed videos\n\nEmbed videos by uploading your videos to a third-party video host, then using the video URL or embed code to add the video to your site. How you add videos depends on your video host:\n\nFor videos hosted on YouTube or Vimeo, use the video's URL. To use advanced playback options for these hosts, use embed code.\n\nFor videos hosted on Animoto, Wistia, or to use advanced playback options for any video host, use embed code.\n\nVisit YouTube, Vimeo, Animoto, or Wistia’s help documentation for video file requirements when uploading video to their services.\n\nTip: Link to your YouTube or Vimeo profile page by displaying social icons.\n\nKeep in mind:\n\nVideos pages and background videos (such as section backgrounds or page banners) only support YouTube and Vimeo for embed options.\n\nIn addition to public videos, if you have hidden or unlisted videos that are accessible by links or embed codes, you can display them on your site.\n\nVimeo's fullscreen button stays hidden while you're logged into your Squarespace site. To test the fullscreen version of your video, log out or open your site in a private or incognito window.\n\nVimeo's player bar displays in the background by default. On Vimeo's paid plans, you can remove the bar by changing the embed code. For help with the embed code, contact Vimeo.\n\nAdding specific types of videos\n\nYouTube and Vimeo support a variety of unique video types and settings. You can add:\n\n360-degree videos to video and embed blocks, but they may cause issues with your site's speed and display.\n\nYouTube shorts by right-clicking on the video, copying the embed code, and adding the code to an embed block.\n\nYouTube videos set to premiere later, but the videos won't display until after they premiere. For more on premiering videos, visit YouTube's help documentation.\n\nLive-streaming YouTube and Vimeo videos to your site by adding the URL to a video block. Ensure you use a YouTube URL that includes /watch. YouTube URLs that include /live won't work.\n\nYou can also use embed code to add live videos to an embed block. After the livestream ends, the video may not work, depending on your settings. For help with livestream embed code, visit YouTube or Vimeo's help documentation.\n\nAdding video from other services\n\nUsually, we recommend uploading your video to a supported service. If that isn't possible, or if you need to keep it hosted elsewhere, you still have some options. Any video sharing service that supports the oEmbed standard can be added to these areas using its embed URL or code:\n\nEmbed blocks\n\nGallery blocks\n\nGallery pages (version 7.0)\n\nIf this doesn't work and there's no typo or other problem with the embed URL or code, it's likely the video host doesn't support the oEmbed standard. If you can't upload it to a service that supports oEmbed, try pasting the code into a code block. While custom code like this falls outside the scope of our support, you can get advice from our community in the Squarespace Forum or hire a Squarespace Expert.\n\nOption 2 - Upload videos\n\nTo have Squarespace host your videos, upload them from your device directly to your site. Use this option to add videos you own or bought from a third party. Currently, you can upload video files to video blocks on all sites and to course pages, videos pages, and section backgrounds on version 7.1 sites. To upload videos in other areas, embed your video instead. To learn more about using videos on your site, visit Squarespace's Terms of Service.\n\nYou can upload videos totaling up to 30 minutes to any site. If the total runtime of your videos reaches the limit, subscribe to a Digital Products plan for more storage, or delete videos to free up storage space. Or you can explore our Enterprise plan, which offers unlimited video storage.\n\nWhen uploading a video file, ensure it meets these requirements.\n\nVideo attribute Specification File type Only .mp4, .m4v, .mov File size\n\nCourse pages: 5000 MB limit\n\nVideos pages: 5000 MB limit\n\nSection backgrounds and video blocks: 500 MB limit\n\nLength\n\nCourse pages: three hour limit (storage allowing)\n\nVideos pages: three hour limit (storage allowing)\n\nVideo blocks: 30 minute limit\n\nSection backgrounds: 60 second limit\n\nMinimum resolution 360p Maximum display resolution 1080p Maximum upload resolution 4K Aspect ratio Videos of any aspect ratio will display, but we recommend uploading at 16:9 as most videos display in a player with that aspect ratio. Video bitrate\n\n360p: 1.5M\n\n1080p: 3M\n\nAudio bitrate 128k Audio codecs AAC-HE v1, .mp3 Video codecs .mpeg-4, AVC/H.264, HEVC/H.265, ProRes\n\nNote: When you upload a video file to Squarespace directly, we automatically convert it to an .mp4 file that can display at 1080p or 360p to maximize compatibility with all devices, browsers, and internet connections. There's no way to manually select which resolution displays. These converted files have an audio bitrate of 128k and a video bitrate of 1.5 (360p) or 3M (1080p).\n\nExamine video files\n\nTo determine if your video meets our requirements, you'll need to examine the video file's metadata. If the video doesn’t meet all the listed requirements, we recommend updating it. In particular, ensure the video uses supported audio and video codecs.\n\nTo examine a video's information on a Mac:\n\nOpen the video file on your computer.\n\nPress Command + I.\n\nIn the window that opens, click More Info.\n\nTo examine an video's information on a Windows device:\n\nRight-click the video file and click Properties.\n\nClick the Details tab in the Properties window to view metadata. If this doesn’t show information about codecs, visit Microsoft’s documentation.\n\nAdd videos to pages and posts\n\nWhere you can add videos depends on your site's version.\n\nReuse uploaded videos\n\nYou can reuse any uploaded video in any other part of your site where you can upload video. Use the Asset library to view and manage all uploaded videos. To learn more, visit Managing and reusing images and videos.\n\nCreate video libraries\n\nYou can create libraries of video content on your site with videos pages. In a videos page, you can upload videos directly or embed videos hosted on YouTube or Vimeo. To learn more, visit Videos pages.\n\nAdd background videos\n\nAdd background videos to create an engaging visual element for your site’s design. These videos:\n\nDisplay as background, behind page content\n\nDon’t have sound\n\nRepeat on a continuous loop\n\nTo learn more, visit Adding background videos.\n\nUse animated .gifs\n\nAnimated .gif images play automatically, loop, and don't include sound. You can use a .gif anywhere on your site where you can add images, including image blocks, banners, and gallery blocks.\n\nReview video metrics\n\nWe don't currently include video metrics in Squarespace analytics for embedded or uploaded videos.\n\nIf you embed videos, contact your video host for details about video metrics. Your video service, not Squarespace, controls how and when video plays count. Plays of embedded videos might add to your view count, depending where you host your videos:\n\nYouTube - For count views, visit your YouTube analytics, which has a breakdown of where viewers find your videos. Learn more in YouTube's analytics series. For specific questions about count views, visit YouTube's help community.\n\nVimeo - For count views, visit your video on Vimeo and open the analytics panel. Learn more in Vimeo's documentation.\n\nFor help with other services, visit their documentation.\n\nTroubleshooting\n\nVideos take too long to load\n\nIf a video takes a while to load, it probably needs that extra time to buffer. Many longer or HD videos require more time to load, especially if you factor in your internet connection.\n\nClicking \"Play\" on a video starts the buffering process. If you pause the video and wait for content to load in the background, you should be able to build up the buffer and play the video with fewer issues.\n\nRelated YouTube videos are playing after mine\n\nYouTube automatically displays related videos after a video finishes playing. This is a YouTube feature that isn't controlled by Squarespace and can't be disabled.\n\nTo prevent displaying related videos, try uploading your video directly, or hosting your video on another supported service. Note that some services require a paid account to disable related videos.\n\nButtons and controls aren’t showing on Vimeo videos\n\nVimeo enables \"Tiny Mode\" when a video block is less than 300 pixels wide or 170 pixels tall. Tiny Mode hides buttons and other information, such as the title, control bar, and the Watch Later/Share buttons. To prevent this, visitors can view the video block on a larger display.\n\nThe fullscreen button isn't appearing or working\n\nWhen you're logged into your site, the Vimeo and YouTube players don't have a fullscreen option. You can view the fullscreen version by opening the page in a private or incognito window in your browser.\n\nUploaded videos aren't displaying as expected\n\nIf you encounter issues with how your uploaded video displays, return to your video editing software and try exporting the video again, ensuring your file meets our requirements, without changing any additional settings.\n\nExporting videos falls outside the scope of our support.\n\nUnlisted Vimeo videos are displaying an error\n\nIf your Vimeo video's privacy settings are set to Unlisted and the video displays an error when embedded to your Squarespace site, you may need to update your video embed code.\n\nVideo titles aren't appearing in video blocks\n\nIf your video block has a custom featured image, the video title is hidden. To display the video title in the upper left-hand corner, delete the custom featured image.\n\nVideos are different sizes\n\nIf your videos are different sizes, it's likely due to their aspect ratios. To learn more, visit Understanding aspect ratios.\n\nVimeo videos aren't playing in HD\n\nTo display HD Vimeo videos, use the embed code to add the video, rather than the video’s URL. Uploading 1080p HD videos to Vimeo requires their Plus or PRO membership plan. It's not possible to add HD Vimeo videos in some pages and areas.\n\nWistia videos are too small\n\nOn project pages (version 7.0 only), Wistia videos display in a smaller frame. To avoid the issue, use a different video hosting platform.\n\nWistia embed code doesn't work"
