        "text": "In terms of function both Wi-Fi and mobile data enable you to browse the internet, stream media, send emails and have video calls on your phone. The key difference is that your phones are receiving the signal from a wireless router when connected to Wi-Fi. You will have a contract with your Wi-Fi provider which will be paid separately to your phone and you will be connected to Wi-Fi if you are within the range of the router. Ultimately it enables you to send and receive data at no additional charge on your phone contract.\n\nWhen you use mobile data you are using wireless 3G, 4G or 5G connection. The amount you are charged for using this data will vary depending on the mobile data plan you have with your phone network provider. The advantage of using mobile data is that you can access the internet anywhere, anytime*. So if you want to access emails, check social media or enjoy books and music on your commute you’ll need mobile data.\n\n*Within the range of a mobile network signal\n\nAnything that uses the internet to send and receive information uses mobile data. It is highly likely that your favourite apps whether it be social media, games, or streaming applications use data (MB & GB) but the amount can vary greatly. For example, social media apps use about 50MB of data per hour whilst gaming apps can use up to 300 MB per hour. If you're looking to stream the latest Netflix series you can expect to use up to a whopping 7.2 GB when streaming in 4K.\n\nWhether you choose to keep mobile data on or off depends on your phone contract and data allowances. If you leave your mobile data on, some applications running in the background may continue to consume your data allowance even if you’re not actively using them.\n\nWith many Galaxy phones available with Unlimited Data contracts there’s no need to worry about your data usage. Samsung also provides plenty of tools to help you manage your mobile data, set limits and control which apps are allowed to use your data allowance. However, if your phone contract limits the amount of data you can use each month there may be times when you wish to turn it off.\n\nTo turn off mobile data follow our quick guide below:\n\n1. Open Settings\n\n2. Tap Connections\n\n3. Tap Data Usage\n\n4. Tap the switch to deactivate mobile data\n\nIf you choose to turn off mobile data your phone will no longer be able to access the internet, perform app updates, download media or make video calls. You’ll need to connect to Wi-Fi in order to use the internet on your phone.\n\nYou can find out how to enable and disable your mobile data on our Samsung Galaxy support page.\n\n1. Connection problems\n\nSometimes a simple connection glitch can cause your mobile data not to work. If this is the case, you can easily reset your mobile data connection by turning it off and on again.\n\n1. Open Quick Settings by pulling down the top of your screen\n\n2. Select Settings\n\n3. Tap Connections\n\n4. Select Data usage\n\n5. Select Mobile data to turn it off and on again\n\n2. Software Updates and reboot\n\nMake sure your phone is updated with the latest software and then giving it a good old reboot is sometimes all it takes to get everything back up and running smoothly.\n\n3. Check your data plan\n\nSome network providers will stop you from using more data if you have reached your data limit - in this case you need to purchase more to start using it once again or wait until your next bill date. Alternatively if you are late paying your monthly bill your data provider may have a hold on your account which stops your mobile data from working.\n\n4. Turn airplane mode on and off\n\nAirplane mode can be a great way to perform a mini reset on your phone’s internet connections. You can find Airplane mode by follow the below steps:\n\n1. Open Quick Settings\n\n2. Tab Settings\n\n3. Tab Network & internet\n\n4. Tab Airplane mode to turn it on or off\n\n5. Remove and reinsert your SIM card\n\nSometimes SIM cards can get dirty, damaged or move which can prevent your phone from connecting properly. Try removing and reinserting your SIM card to get your mobile data working again.\n\n6. Factory Reset\n\nIf all else fails try performing a factory reset. Be aware though this will delete everything on your phone and should only be used as a last resort. Follow our How do I perform a factory reset on my mobile device to implement a full reset of your Galaxy device.\n\nYou can visit How to troubleshoot mobile data issues for more information."
