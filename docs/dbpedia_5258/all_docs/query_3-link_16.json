        "text": "Broadway is turning up the heat! Some Like It Hot, one of the most beloved comedy films in history, is now a hit Broadway musical that will quench anyone's thirst for old-fashioned theatrical spectacle. An award-winning creative team — including comedian Amber Ruffin, the Tony-winning director of The Book of Mormon, and the songwriters of Hairspray — have brought the 1959 movie to fresh, colorful life.\n\nLike the movie, the Some Like It Hot Broadway show sees musicians Joe and Jerry seek romance — and themselves — while on the run from a mobster in disguise. Fans of the film will see all their favorite moments on stage, but the musical updates the story with a modern understanding of gender identity, celebrating everyone's right to live out their truest self.\n\nLearn more about the Some Like It Hot musical below, including production and venue information and fun facts about the show and movie. Tickets are on sale now — get 'em while they're hot!\n\nWhat is Some Like It Hot about?\n\nThe Some Like It Hot musical takes place in the 1930s (a change from the 1920s-set movie), just before the end of Prohibition. Musicians Joe and Jerry work at a mob-controlled speakeasy, and they see mob boss Spats kill an informant.\n\nSpats resolves to kill them for being witnesses, forcing Joe and Jerry to go on the run. They hear of openings in an all-female traveling swing band and disguise themselves as women to join them. In a departure from the movie, only Joe falls for the band's lead singer, Sugar — though his disguise as Josephine gets in the way. Jerry, meanwhile, finds that his cover, Daphne, is more than a disguise. Daphne allows Jerry to discover and live out his truest, fullest self.\n\nWhere is Some Like It Hot playing?\n\nSome Like It Hot is at the Shubert Theatre. The venue is named for Sam S. Shubert, one of the three brothers who founded the Shubert Organization that now owns and operates 17 Broadway theatres. Recent hit shows at the Shubert Theatre include the Bette Midler-led Hello, Dolly! revival, To Kill a Mockingbird, Matilda the Musical, and POTUS.\n\nHow long is Some Like It Hot?\n\nSome Like It Hot on Broadway runs approximately 2 hours and 30 minutes, including an intermission. This is an average Broadway musical length; they typically run between 2 and 3 hours.\n\nWhat days is Some Like It Hot playing?\n\nSome Like It Hot plays eight performances a week Tuesday through Sunday, with no performances on Mondays. There are matinee and evening performances on Wednesday and Saturday, and only a matinee on Sunday. For the most up-to-date weekly performance schedule, visit the Some Like It Hot page.\n\nWhen did Some Like It Hot premiere?\n\nThe Some Like It Hot film premiered in 1959, and it has since gone down in history as one of the most beloved comedy films of all time. The film remains one of Marilyn Monroe's most famous credits as an actress and Billy Wilder's as a director.\n\nThe Some Like It Hot musical premiered directly on Broadway in fall 2022.\n\nWho wrote Some Like It Hot?\n\nThe songs for Some Like It Hot are by composer-lyricist duo Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman. They're known for their catchy, period-specific scores for musicals like Hairspray and Catch Me If You Can (both set in the '60s) and TV shows like Smash.\n\nAdapting Billy Wilder and I. A. L. Diamond's Some Like It Hot screenplay for the stage are Amber Ruffin and Matthew López. Ruffin is a comedian known for hosting an eponymous late-night talk show, and López wrote the 2020 Tony Award-winning Best Play The Inheritance.\n\nSome Like It Hot characters\n\nAll the characters you know and love from the Some Like It Hot movie are also in the musical, now with a fresh update. Here are the major characters in Some Like It Hot.\n\nJoe/Josephine: A nightclub saxophone player alongside Jerry. He disguises himself twice during Some Like It Hot: as Josephine, to blend in with Sweet Sue's band, and as a rich Hollywood film producer, to woo Sugar. Tony Curtis played the role in the film, and Christian Borle plays him on Broadway.\n\nJerry/Daphne: A nightclub bass player alongside Joe. In the musical, being Daphne makes Jerry feel more comfortable in his identity than ever, which turns out not to be entirely masculine. Jack Lemmon played Jerry in the film.\n\nSugar Kane: The lead singer of Sweet Sue's traveling band. Marilyn Monroe played the role in the film, but in the musical, Sugar is a Black woman who grew up in segregation and is now trying to build a successful performance career.\n\nSweet Sue: The leader of Sweet Sue and her Society Syncopators, the swing band Joe and Jerry stow away with. She runs a tight ship but is caring and motherly toward all her girls.\n\nOsgood Fielding III: A kind-hearted millionaire who falls for Daphne at first sight. They bond over both feeling like outsiders in society.\n\nSpats Colombo: A mob boss who runs the Chicago club Joe and Jerry perform in. Spats chases Joe and Jerry across the country because they saw him kill someone.\n\nDetective Mulligan: A Chicago detective trying to find and arrest Spats.\n\nSome Like It Hot songs\n\nThe Some Like It Hot movie included a few songs, but it wasn't a full-out musical, and those songs aren't in the musical adaptation. The Some Like It Hot Broadway songs are from the composers of upbeat period musicals like Hairspray and Catch Me If You Can. This time, Shaiman and Wittman take inspiration from the 1930s with jazzy big-band tunes. Here are all the songs in Some Like It Hot.\n\nAct 1\n\n\"What Are You Thirsty For?\" - Sue and Ensemble\n\n\"You Can't Have Me (If You Don't Have Him)\" - Joe and Jerry\n\n\"Vamp!\" - Joe & Jerry\n\n\"I'm California Bound\" - Sue, Joe, Jerry, Sugar and Ensemble\n\n\"A Darker Shade of Blue\" - Sugar\n\n\"Take It Up A Step\" - Sugar, Josephine, Daphne, and Ensemble\n\n\"Zee Bap\" - Sue, Daphne, and Ensemble\n\n\"At the Old Majestic Nickel Matinee\" - Sugar\n\n\"Poor Little Millionaire\" - Osgood and Ensemble\n\n\"Some Like It Hot\" - Sue, Sugar, Daphne and Ensemble\n\nAct 2\n\n\"Let's Be Bad\" - Osgood, Daphne, and Ensemble\n\n\"Let's Dance the World Away\" - Joe, Sugar, and Ensemble\n\n\"Fly, Mariposa, Fly\" - Osgood and Ensemble\n\n\"You Could've Knocked Me Over With a Feather\" - Daphne\n\n\"He Lied When He Said Hello\" - Joe and Ensemble\n\n\"Ride Out the Storm\" - Sugar\n\n\"Tip Tap Trouble\" - Company\n\n\"Baby, Let's Get Good\" - Company\n\nWhat awards has Some Like It Hot won?\n\nThe Some Like It Hot musical has not won any awards yet; it will be eligible at the 2023 Tony Awards in June, and nominations will be announced in May. The show has, however, earned critical acclaim; a four-star New York Theatre Guide review calls Some Like It Hot \"a bracing, fizzy cocktail garnished with a winning cast.\"\n\nThe 1959 film received six Oscar nominations including Best Director (Billy Wilder) and Best Adapted Screenplay, and it won for Best Costume Design.
