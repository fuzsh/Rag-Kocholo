        "text": "By Alex Kerai\n\n4 min read\n\nHow often do you check your phone? Right when you wake up? Every ten minutes in case you missed a notification? Well, we surveyed Americans 18 and older about their phone habits and behaviors and found that you’re not alone.\n\nMore than half of Americans (56.9%) told Reviews.org that they are addicted to their cell phone, a greater percentage than last year. But it’s not all doom and gloom—after all, you’re probably reading this on a cell phone. So scroll down and let’s check out how Americans are using their cell phones in 2023.\n\nAmericans check their phones 144 times per day.\n\n89% of Americans say they check their phones within the first 10 minutes of waking up.\n\n75% of Americans feel uneasy leaving their phone at home.\n\n75% of Americans check their phones within five minutes of receiving a notification.\n\n75% use their phone on the toilet.\n\n69% have texted someone in the same room as them before.\n\n60% sleep with their phone at night\n\n57% consider themselves “addicted” to their phones\n\n55% say that they have never gone longer than 24 hours without their cell phone.\n\n47% of people say they feel a sense of panic or anxiety when their cell phone battery goes below 20%.\n\n46% use or look at their phone while on a date.\n\n27% use or look at their phone while driving.\n\nAmericans spend 4 hours, 25 minutes each day on their cell phones.\n\nOverall, the average American will spend over two months (65 days) on their phones in 2023.\n\nWhat changed in 2023\n\nMany Americans changed their cell phone habits in 2023. We don’t really know why, but it seems to generally be for the better.\n\nIn 2023, Americans check their phones an average of 144 times a day, a 58% decrease since our last cell phone usage survey published in January 2022.\n\nAmericans are driving safer — 27.1% say they use or look at their phone while driving, a 14.1% decrease since last year.\n\nBut we still have a way to go: screen time is up and 60% of Americans sleep with their phones at night. While TikTok’s low dopamine morning trend seemed to be catching on, with people focusing on morning walks and time away from their devices, most Americans aren’t following the trend and are checking their phones first thing in the morning.\n\n6% of Americans check their phone within the first 10 minutes of waking up, an increase of 10.6% since last year.\n\nAlthough Americans check their phones less often, their screen time has increased by 30% since last year.\n\nOn average, Americans have a screen time of 4 hours and 25 minutes each day on their mobile devices, compared to 2 hours and 54 minutes in 2022.\n\nAmericans are more protective of their devices compared to last year. While there is a decline in the number of people who would endanger themselves to protect their phones, most Americans would make sure they had their phone with them before evacuating for a disaster.\n\nIn the event of a house fire (or other major disasters), 82% would be sure to take their phone with them before evacuating.\n\nAn increase of 26% since last year.\n\nProtecting phones may also have something to do with the higher cost of smartphones. As prices rise, fewer Americans are upgrading their phones each more and more Americans are being cost-savvy about their mobile purchases.\n\nAmericans are being more cost savvy in 2023. Only 17% would go into debt to purchase a cell phone, which is an 4% decrease from 2022.\n\n2022 to 2023 comparison\n\nQuestion\n\n2022 response\n\n2023 response\n\nPercent difference\n\nIn the morning, do you check your phone within the first 10 minutes of waking up?78.00%88.60%10.60%Do you feel uneasy when leaving your phone at home?78.00%75.10%-2.90%Do you use and/or look at your phone while driving?41.20%27.10%-14.10%Do you use and/or look at your phone while on a date?51.30%45.80%-5.50%Do you use and/or look at your phone while working/at work?N/A70.00%N/ADo you use and/or look at your phone while watching TV?N/A91.80%N/ADo you use and/or look at your phone while watching a movie at the theater?N/A34.60%N/ADo you use and/or look at your phone while eating dinner?N/A66.50%N/AHave you ever texted someone in the same room as you?69.40%68.70%-0.70%Do you use your phone on the toilet?72.30%75.30%3.00%Do you sleep with your phone at night?59.40%60.10%0.70%Do you panic or feel a sense of anxiety if the battery on your cell phone goes below 20%?51.70%47.10%-4.60%In the event of a house fire or other disaster, would you make an effort to take your phone with you?55.00%81.80%26.80%Would you consider yourself to be addicted to your phone?51.90%56.90%5.00%When you receive a notification on your cell phone, do you normally check the notification within 5 minutes or less?74.50%75.10%0.60%Does having another person use your phone cause you anxiety or stress?49.50%44.70%-4.80%In the first 30 minutes after losing your phone, do you experience stress or anxiety?65.20%71.20%6.00%Have you ever gone longer than 24 hours without your cell phone?53.50%54.90%1.40%Have you ever endangered yourself to avoid the loss or damage of your cell phone?

Offers and availability vary by location and are subject to change.\n\nCell phone usage by generation\n\nWe found that Americans use their cell phone differently depending on their generation. For example, Gen Z checks their phone almost immediately after receiving a notification and are the most likely to be anxious if they lose their phone.\n\nBut not everyone is like that. While Millennials may seem addicted to their phones, many reported being okay letting notifications sit and getting to them later. But, unfortunately, Gen Z and Millennials are still the most likely people to endanger themselves for their device.\n\nGeneration most likely to check their phone notifications within 5 minutes\n\nGen Z are the most likely to check their phone within 5 minutes of receiving a notification.\n\nMillennials are the least likely to immediately check their phone.\n\nHowever, over 70% of Americans in each generation check their phone pretty immediately after receiving a notification.\n\nGeneration most anxious after losing their phone\n\nGen Z is the most likely to be anxious after losing their phone.\n\nBoomers—aka, those born before 1964—are the least anxious after losing a phone.\n\nPhone anxiety has increased since 2022, with 6% more Americans experiencing stress or anxiety in the first 30 minutes.\n\nGeneration most likely to upgrade their phone\n\nOverall, 50% of Americans have upgraded their phone in the last year.\n\nGen Zers are upgrading their phones the most (58.5%) while Boomers and Gen X are upgrading the least (43%).\n\nGeneration least likely to put themselves in danger to avoid the loss or damage of their phone\n\nBoomers are the least likely to put themselves in danger to save their phone, with 95% saying they have not endangered themselves for their mobile device.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Gen Z and Millennials (at 71% and 77%, respectively) are the most likely to endanger themselves for their device.\n\nConclusion\n\nAmericans are spending 4 hours, 25 minutes each day on their phones. While we’re not judging anyone, that’s a lot of time to be glued to your device. But our cell phone addictions are showing signs of letting up: Americans are checking their phones 200 times fewer per day now than last year.\n\nStill, we need our cell phones to remain connected to the outside world.

The survey results were weighted to reflect characteristics of the United States population using available data from the US census.\n\nRespondents were asked to refer to their phone’s screen time report to determine the average number of times per day they check their phones, in addition to how much time in total they spend on their phones per day.\n\nWritten by\n\nAlex began writing for student newspapers and has managed to turn that into a career.
