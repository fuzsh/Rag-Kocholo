        "text": "Microsoft Excel stores dates as sequential serial numbers so they can be used in calculations. By default, January 1, 1900 is serial number 1, and January 1, 2018 is serial number 43101 because it is 43,101 days after January 1, 1900.\n\nThe settlement date is the date a buyer purchases a coupon, such as a bond. The maturity date is the date when a coupon expires. For example, suppose a 30-year bond is issued on January 1, 2018, and is purchased by a buyer six months later. The issue date would be January 1, 2018, the settlement date would be July 1, 2018, and the maturity date would be January 1, 2048, which is 30 years after the January 1, 2018, issue date."
