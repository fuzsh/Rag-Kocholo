        "text": "by Chili Palmer and Peter Holslin\n\nEdited by Rebecca Lee Armstrong\n\nMost households need about 700GB of home internet data every month to browse, stream, and game without a hitch. For your cell phone plan, on the other hand, you need at least 10GB of monthly data.\n\nIf you exceed your data cap, you could be charged for overages. Alternatively, your provider could slow down your speeds as part of its “fair use” policy. That could lead to buffering, slow uploads and downloads, and even lost connection on some devices.\n\nWe’ll give you a rundown of the data limits you can expect from your provider and help you find out how your internet speed impacts data usage. Then, we’ll give you tips on budgeting your data and recommend the best unlimited plans.\n\nPro tip:\n\nTake a look at the best unlimited-data internet plans for the inside scoop on speeds, pricing, and availability.\n\nJump to: Unlimited data | 1 TB data caps | Budgeting your data | Data and rural internet | Cellphone data | Data and hotspots | FAQ\n\nJump to:\n\nUnlimited data\n\n1 TB data caps\n\nBudgeting your data\n\nData and rural internet\n\nCell phone data\n\nData and hotspots\n\nFAQ\n\nHow much data does an average internet user consume per month?\n\nThe average internet user consumes 641GB per month on their home internet plan, according to a recent report from OpenVault. By the end of 2024, the report estimated the average household would use at least 700GB every month. “Power users,” who use more than 1TB per month, make up more than 20% of households. “Extreme power users,” who use more than 2TB per month, make up about 5% of households.\n\nHousehold data usage has been climbing steadily for years.The rise of smart home devices and ubiquity of online streaming fuels a higher demand for data. Internet users with faster speeds at home also use more data on average.\n\nWhat’s the difference between internet speed and internet data?\n\nYou can think of internet speeds like a pipe and data like gallons of water. The speed is the width of the pipe, while data is the total number of gallons that pass through the pipe during a given period of time.\n\nIn geek speak, data is measured in GB and TB (gigabits and terabits) while speed is measured in Mbps and Gbps (megabits per second and gigabits per second).\n\nFaster speeds use more data\n\nIf you have a fast internet plan, that means you have a big pipe that can pass several gallons (MB or GB of data ) at a time. So it makes sense that the faster your speed, the more data you’re likely to use.\n\nUse our “How Much Internet Speed Do I Need?” tool to see whether you can reduce data usage—and save money—with a slower internet plan.\n\nHow much internet data you need\n\nInternet activityMinimum recommended data per monthStreaming video in HD300GBMaking video calls on Zoom60GBRunning home security cameras30GB–300GB (depending on video resolution and frequency of activity captured by the cameras)Online gaming30GBWeb browsing and checking email40GBStreaming music or podcasts13GB\n\nData from the Armstrong data calculator.\n\nTo figure out how much data you need, the first step is to find out how much data you get on your monthly plan by looking at your bill or your provider’s mobile app.\n\nIf you have fiber or DSL internet, there’s a good chance you won’t have a data cap to worry about at all. If you have cable internet, you can expect a cap of 1,200GB to 1,300GB (1.2TB–1.3TB). However, some cable providers (Mediacom) have caps as low as 350GB on some plans and others (Spectrum) offer unlimited data. Xfinity, the nation’s largest cable internet provider, has caps of 1.2GB on most plans. Cox, another major provider, is slightly more generous with a cap of 1.28TB.\n\nOnce you know how much data you get, find out how much data you already use.\n\nHome internet data monitoring\n\nThe easiest way to monitor your home internet data usage every month is to log in to your router’s mobile app. If you rent Wi-Fi gear from your provider, this will be your provider’s app. If you use your own router, you’ll probably have an app from the manufacturer. Look for “Activity” or “data usage” to find the relevant data. If you can’t find what you need there, your data usage may be listed on your monthly bill.\n\nMonitoring cell phone data is easy on most devices, too. On iPhones, go to Settings. From there, search the list for Cellular. Then, find the “Usage” line to see both how much cellular data you’ve used and how much your plan offers. On Android phones, go to Settings, then look for either “Connections” Or “Network & Internet.” Look for Carrier, and then tap “Settings” to see data usage.\n\nHow to budget your internet data\n\nOnce you’ve figured out your data cap and compared it to your data use, you can get started on a data budget. Don’t worry too much about the impact of emails, music streaming, or general browsing (none of which use up very much data). Pay more attention to the number and size of files you download, the amount of time you spend streaming video, and the video resolution on your streaming platforms and Zoom calls.\n\nGet unlimited data to avoid going over your data limit\n\nBefore we go further, let’s be clear about one thing. The best way to ensure you have all the data you need is to get an internet plan with unlimited data.\n\nUnlimited data means you can use the internet all you want, without consequences (well, from your service provider at least).\n\nBest internet plans with unlimited data\n\nPlanPriceSpeedOrder onlineGoogle Fiber 1 Gig$70.00/mo.*1,000MbpsView Plans T-Mobile 5G Home Internet Unlimited$50.00/mo.†72-245MbpsView Plan Spectrum Internet® 300 Mbps$39.99—$49.99/mo.‡Up to 300Mbps (wireless speeds may vary)Astound Broadband 300 Mbps Internet$20.00/mo.§300MbpsEarthlink Fiber 1 Gig$74.95/mo.║1,000MbpsT-Mobile 5G Home Internet Plus$70.00/mo.†72-245MbpsView Plan\n\nRead disclaimers.\n\nDo you need unlimited data? Honestly, probably not.\n\nBut unlimited data does come in handy if you spend a lot of time doing online activities that use up lots of data, like streaming video and downloading large files.\n\nUnlimited data is also useful if you share Wi-Fi with a lot of roommates or family members. If you go back to the water analogy—the more people you have on your Wi-Fi, the more data you consume overall. So you need a larger water tank to get through each month.\n\nLooking for an internet plan with lots of data? Search your zip code below to see what’s available in your area.\n\nSearch Providers near you\n\nIs 1 TB of internet data enough?\n\nFor most households, 1TB of data is enough for a month of internet use. That’s the usual data cap for home internet providers, and it’s a generous amount. It will cover activities like browsing, checking email, and watching a handful of YouTube videos or Netflix movies every day.\n\nHowever, it’s much easier to go through 1TB of data in 30 days if you have gigabit internet speeds, spend a lot of time doing data-heavy activities, share your Wi-Fi with a lot of other users, or all of the above.\n\nThese activities use a large amount of data:\n\nStreaming video\n\nMaking video calls\n\nRunning smart-home security cameras\n\nPosting video to social media\n\nDownloading games and large files\n\nDoing any of these tasks on multiple devices at the same time\n\nThese activities use a small amount of data:\n\nChecking, sending, and receiving email\n\nUsing social media (without posting video)\n\nBrowsing the web (with no video)\n\nStreaming music or podcasts\n\nShopping online\n\nIs Xfinity’s 1.2 TB of internet data enough?\n\nXfinity imposes a data cap of 1.2 TB per month on all of its internet plans. That’s enough for most people, and it’s slightly better than average as far as data caps go.\n\nHowever, you may need more data if you have an Xfinity plan with speeds of 1,000 Mbps or faster. On average, internet users with gigabit speeds use more than 1TB of data in a month.\n\nXfinity’s Unlimited Data Option gives an unlimited quantity of internet data for an extra $30 per month. Having unlimited data means you’re less likely to go over your data cap and incur extra charges. Of course, this doesn’t beat internet providers like Spectrum and Astound Broadband, which give you unlimited data at no extra cost.\n\nLife lessons for consuming internet data\n\nLesson one: Stream video in standard definition to use less data\n\nActivityMinimum recommended data per monthHow much time it takes to use 1GBStreaming video in SD500MB per hour2 hoursStreaming video in HD2GB per hour30 minutesStreaming video in 4K8GB per hour7.5 minutes\n\nData from the Armstrong data calculator.\n\nIf you’re worried about your data cap, it’s best to avoid watching video in 4K resolution—it gobbles up a stunning 8 GB per hour. (And can you really tell the difference between 4K and HD, anyway?) Even HD video can take a nasty bite out of your data. Streaming in SD lets you watch a lot more video without putting as big a dent on your data diet.\n\nOn most streaming apps, you can change video resolution by settings by logging into your profile on a PC or laptop browser.\n\nLesson two: Every file you download counts towards your data cap\n\nDownloadHow much data it usesA six-page PDF5.9MBAn HD movieApprox. 4GBA video game or game updateApprox. 20-60GB\n\nData from the Armstrong data calculator.\n\nThe size of a file you download roughly corresponds to the amount of data you use to download it. You can see how much data a download eats up by looking at how big the file is—the larger the file, the more data.\n\nLesson three: Watch out for video calls and smart-home cameras\n\nActivityHow much data it usesHow much time it takes to use 1 GBMaking a video call in SD340MB per hour3 hoursMaking a video call in HD2GB per hour30 minutesRunning a smart home security camera2GB per hour30 minutes\n\nData from the Armstrong data calculator.\n\nHigh-resolution video calls on apps like Zoom have the potential to make a big dent in your monthly data. You probably don’t need to worry if you make a couple calls a day, but consider switching off the HD setting on your Zoom account if you work from home and regularly sit in on multiple daily meetings.\n\nThe same goes for smart home security cameras, which can use up to 2GB per hour depending on the resolution and other settings.\n\nLesson four: Don’t sweat the small stuff\n\nActivityHow much data it usesHow much time it takes to use 1 GBOnline gaming200MB per hour5 hoursWeb browsing180MB per hour5-6 hoursScrolling/posting on social media90MB per hour10-11 hoursStreaming audio60MB per hour18-19 hoursSending/receiving emails40MB per 100 emails2,500 emails\n\nData from the Armstrong data calculator.\n\nYou don’t use much data sending emails, reading the news, scrolling social media, shopping online, or streaming music and podcasts. Even online gaming has a relatively modest impact on your data cap. If this constitutes the bulk of what you do online, then a 1TB data cap is plenty.\n\nIf you’re looking for fast internet with a lot of data, run your zip code below to see what’s available in your area.\n\nSearch Providers near you\n\nWith rural internet, you get a lot less data than usual\n\nMany rural parts of the United States have limited internet options. Sometimes, the only service you can get is satellite or fixed wireless internet. Even if your provider says there are no data caps, your speeds could slow down dramatically if you exceed certain limits.\n\nDoes satellite internet have low data caps?\n\nEach of the big three satellite internet providers now advertise unlimited data, but there’s more to the story. With Hughesnet, you get up to 200GB of priority data (depending on your plan) and then get deprioritized to standard data for the rest of the month. That can mean speeds that are really slow.\n\nViasat and Starlink offer unlimited data, but the real-world differences in speed are enormous. With Viasat, our proprietary speed test shows average results of 14.93Mbps. That’s barely fast enough to stream one video in SD without buffering. With Starlink, on the other hand, our speed test shows average results of 48.49Mbps. That’s fast enough for multiple connected devices, even if you don’t spring for a priority plan.\n\nWhy does fixed wireless internet have low data caps?\n\nFixed wireless sometimes has low data caps because it depends on a cellular network, which may not always have wide coverage in a remote area.\n\nRise Broadband offers a 50 Mbps Internet plan with a 250 GB monthly cap, for instance. Home internet plans from T-Mobile and AT&T offer unlimited data but it’s always deprioritized compared to mobile phone traffic.\n\nData caps on fixed wireless internet\n\nInternet providerData capConnection typeOrder online250GB/mo. (unlimited options available in some areas)Fixed wirelessUnlimitedFixed wirelessView Plan UnlimitedFixed wireless\n\nRise Broadband charges you if you go over your data limit every month, but you can spring for its unlimited data plan upfront for an extra $25 each month. We recommend going that route rather than risking even more excessive overage charges.\n\nHow much cell phone data do you need?\n\nYou need 10GB of data per month for your cell phone to use social media, make VoIP calls, stream videos, and do other internet activities regularly without worrying about using up your data or getting slowed speeds.\n\nYou need at least 10GB is a solid amount of cellular data to cover your internet needs when you aren’t able to log onto a Wi-Fi network on your phone. But you should definitely get more data if you use your phone daily to do data-heavy tasks like making Zoom calls, streaming video on Netflix, or hosting a livestream.\n\nVerizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile all have phone plans that give you 50GB or even unlimited premium data every month. You have to pay significantly more for those plans, of course, but it may be worth the price if you regularly burn through your phone data.\n\nAlthough many cell phone plans tout “unlimited” data, in reality most of those plans have caps on high-speed data. The cap could be anywhere from 5GB to 100GB, depending on the plan, and when you go over, your speeds revert to crushingly slow, sub–1 Mbps speeds.\n\nHow much mobile data do you get from a hotspot?\n\nYou can get anywhere from 2GB to 100GB per month with your phone’s hotspot or a mobile hotspot.\n\nHotspots are a great tool if you spend a lot of time working outside your home or office. You can also use one if you’re house-sitting, traveling, or taking a short break at a vacation home. But they require data plans to work, and those plans usually come with strict limits. The data comes from a cellular network, which doesn’t have the same throughput capacity as a residential fiber, cable, or DSL internet network.\n\nEven when you can get unlimited data on a hotspot, watch out for caveats. T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&T technically give you unlimited hotspot data, but your plan comes with a set amount of premium, high-speed data for the month.\n\nAfter that’s all used up, you get unlimited data at slow-creeping speeds that aren’t good for much. The phone plan from Visible, meanwhile, promises unlimited hotspot data, but only at 5 Mbps with just one Wi-Fi device connected at a time.\n\nFAQ about how much data you need\n\nHow much data do I need per month?\n\nYou need at least at least 700GB of data per month to comfortably do a range of activities online.\n\nHow much data do I use per month?\n\nOn average, North American internet users consumed 641GB of broadband data per month in 2023. Trends show internet users are consuming more internet data each year compared to the year before.\n\nWhat is a data cap?\n\nA data cap is a usage limit enforced by an internet provider, dictating the maximum amount of internet you’re allowed to use per month. Internet providers usually call it a data limit, data usage, usage allowance, or “fair use policy.”\n\nMost cable internet providers offer a data cap of 1TB per month, but some providers have unlimited data on all or some of their plans. Satellite internet providers advertise unlimited data, but you may have to pay extra for priority speeds.\n\nDisclaimers\n\nBest unlimited internet plans (return to top)\n\nData effective as of 7/1/24.
