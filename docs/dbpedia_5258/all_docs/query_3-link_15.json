        "text": "What is an embargo date?\n\nA review embargo is set by the studio or TV network and prohibits outlets and organizations that have seen the film / TV show from posting reviews until that specified time. Sometimes studios and TV networks also set embargoes for social media reactions from critics and journalists.\n\nWhy don't certain movies or TV shows have Tomatometer scores yet?\n\nWe have recently updated our criteria for the number of reviews it takes for a Tomatometer score to populate. You can read more about that HERE.\n\nWhy do certain movies only have a few reviews?\n\nThere are a variety of reasons why a film or TV show may not have many reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. The simplest explanation is there may not be many reviews from Tomatometer-approved critics available for that specific film or TV show in question. Other reasons include:\n\nSome available reviews haven't been collected or added yet.\n\nA film or TV show is from an era when film criticism was not as robust as it is now.\n\nA film or TV show review appeared in a print publication and may not have been published or made available online.\n\nWhy is one review with a 2.5 marked Fresh while another review marked 2.5 is marked Rotten? Likewise, why is one review with a 3/5 marked Fresh while another is marked Rotten? Shouldn't they always be Fresh or always be Rotten?\n\nSometimes a reviewer will give a rating that is in the middle, so a decision has to be made: is it Fresh or is it Rotten? When those reviews have been added to RT by a self-submitting critic or publication, we defer to their judgement. When our review curation team comes across a mixed review, we have a process in place to determine whether it is mixed-positive or mixed-negative. When two reviews that have the same individual rating are alternately marked Fresh and Rotten, it means that for one of those reviews, the critic felt mixed-positive, and for the other, the critic felt mixed-negative. Learn more about our curation process HERE.\n\nWho writes these reviews? Will you post mine?\n\nTomatometer-approved critics come from all across the U.S., and the world. They publish on a variety of platforms - among them you'll find podcasters, newspaper and magazine writers, bloggers, and YouTubers. Their reviews embody several key values - insight and dedication among them - and meet a set of Eligibility Guidelines. See our list of Tomatometer-approved critics.\n\nWhere is the Average rating now on the site?\n\nThe average rating can be viewed by clicking on the Tomatometer or Popcornmeter in the score box on movie and TV pages.\n\nWhat is the Average Rating? How is it calculated?\n\nThe Average Rating is an average of the individual critic scores, based on a 1-10 scale. Each critic's original rating scale (e.g. star, letter grade, numeric) is converted to a number between 1 and 10, and then the numbers are averaged. Reviews without individual ratings are not counted in the Average Rating calculation, and a minimum of five reviews with individual ratings is required for an Average Rating to be calculated. The Average Rating measures the overall quality of a film or TV show based on an average of individual critic scores. The Tomatometer simply measures the percentage of positive reviews for a given film or TV show.\n\nWhat is the difference between the audience review and User Rating?\n\nAn audience review is a text review of a film or TV show that has been submitted by a Rotten Tomatoes user. A User Rating is a user's star rating on a film or TV show, without a text review.\n\nHow do I leave a review?\n\nIf you are logged in, you can go to any movie or TV show's page to rate and/or review it using the star-rating system and text box. You can see your ratings by clicking on Profile in the drop-down menu at the top right of the page.\n\nWhat is the minimum length of an Audience Review?\n\nWe require reviews to be a minimum of 20 characters in length.\n\nWhen do I get to submit my audience review?\n\nAfter confirming your email address, you can write a review when logged in to the site through a Rotten Tomatoes account or Gmail log-in. When you are logged in, you'll be able to view a movie's details page and rate and/or review the movie using the stars and text box. For movies, reviews can be left after the film's theatrical release date.\n\nWhy is my review not showing up right away?\n\nTo encourage thoughtful discussion, we require reviews to be a minimum of 20 characters in length to be published. Please also keep in mind that reviews may take some time to be published and are subject to our Code of Conduct. If you continue having trouble, contact customer service.\n\nWhen does the Popcornmeter appear?\n\nThe Popcornmeter becomes available after the release date for a film or TV show. Only after that will users be able to leave an audience review or user rating.\n\nWhy can't I leave a review before the movie is released?\n\nRotten Tomatoes users can only leave audience reviews and user ratings following a movie's U.S. release date, as listed on our site. Verified Reviews are available for movies in the U.S. that were released after May 2019 - the date we added this feature.\n\nWhy do some movies display the Popcornmeter and user reviews before their release date?\n\nA number of films are shown in special preview screenings or early screening series prior to their official U.S. release date. We allow users to rate and review these movies from the time of their first large-scale screenings.\n\nWhat is a Verified Review?\n\nA Verified Review is a review written by a user who we can confirm bought a ticket to the movie they're reviewing, which we believe is a strong indicator that they have seen the movie. “Verified” will be displayed next to a review to help users identify which reviews are “Verified.”\n\nHow does my review become verified?\n\nWhen you submit a review on Rotten Tomatoes or Fandango, if the account matches the email address you used to buy your ticket on Fandango, we will mark your review as “Verified”.\n\nHow do I know if my review has been verified?\n\nIf we're able to verify your ticket purchase, you'll see “Verified” next to your review once it's posted to Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nWhy is my review not verified?\n\nCurrently, if you did not buy your ticket from Fandango, your review cannot be “Verified”. We are planning to work with other ticket providers to help verify Rotten Tomatoes reviews and will add new options for verification in the future. If you purchased a ticket from Fandango and are having issues with your review being verified, please contact customer service.\n\nDo all movies have Verified Reviews?\n\nVerified Reviews are possible for movies released in theaters in the United States from May 2019 onward. Currently, Verified Ratings or Reviews are not possible for movies released before that date and movies not released theatrically, as well as TV and streaming titles. We are planning to add functionality that will allow us to verify reviews no matter how and where a user saw a movie, TV, or streaming title.\n\nCan I see all user ratings and reviews, even if they weren't verified?\n\nIf you're interested in seeing the Popcornmeter that includes all included ratings, not just those that have been verified, you can click on the Tomatometer or Popcornmeter and choose “All Audience”. When reading reviews, choose the “All Audience” tab and all reviews will display with the newest one showing first. Verified Reviews will be displayed with a “Verified” icon to show we've confirmed that the reviewer has purchased a ticket to that movie.\n\nCan reviews from outside of the United States be verified?\n\nCurrently, we are only able to verify reviews for movies from reviewers who purchased tickets in the United States. We are working on ways we may be able to offer this feature for other reviewers outside of the United States in the future.\n\nWhy aren't there Verified Reviews on television pages and all movie pages?\n\nVerified Reviews are available for movies that were released in the United States May 2019 - the date we added this feature. We're planning to add other ticket and content providers in the future to help us verify reviews for more movies and TV/streaming.\n\nWill you be adding more ways to verify reviews?\n\nWe are actively working on adding more ticket providers to help us confirm ticket purchases, as well as functionality that will allow us to verify reviews no matter how and where the user saw a movie.\n\nCan I verify my reviews for Netflix and other streaming services?\n\nNot currently, but we are always looking to improve the usefulness of our audience rating system for fans and are working on ways we may be able to do this in future.\n\nI purchased a physical ticket to a movie; how do I verify my review?\n\nCurrently, we cannot verify physical ticket purchases. However, we're currently considering ways we could do so in the future.\n\nSomeone purchased a ticket for me, how do I verify my review?\n\nAt this time, we can only verify one review and rating per transaction. So, if someone buys more than one ticket - say, for a bunch of friends - each person can leave a review, but only the person with the email address used for the purchase can have their review verified.\n\nWhich companies are included in verifying tickets? Will there be more added in the future?\n\nCurrently, users can verify their reviews through Fandango. We are currently working to bring on additional ticket providers to help us verify reviews and ratings.\n\nIf my review is verified why isn't it included in the Tomatometer?\n\nThe Tomatometer is generated by the reviews of Tomatometer-approved professional critics who meet a set of criteria. These are professional, working movie and TV critics. Verified Reviews and ratings are made up of users who we can confirm purchased a ticket to the movie they're reviewing.\n\nI have a Rotten Tomatoes account, why is my review not verified?\n\nReviews and ratings are verified when we can confirm the user bought a ticket to the movie.\n\nI did buy a ticket on Fandango, but my review is not verified: why?\n\nThe review might not be verified for a couple of reasons. First, if the email address for your Rotten Tomatoes account does not match your Fandango account email, we will not be able to confirm your ticket purchase and verify your review. Second, verifiable reviews may not be possible for the title you are reviewing (e.g. if it is an older movie, a streaming or TV title).\n\nMy ticket purchase was confirmed, but my Verified Review is not showing up on the site. Why can't I see my review?\n\nIn an effort to encourage thoughtful discussion, we require reviews to be a minimum of 20 characters in length to be published. Please also keep in mind that reviews may take some time to be published and are subject to our Code of Conduct. If you continue having trouble, please contact customer service."
