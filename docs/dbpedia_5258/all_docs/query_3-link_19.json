        "text": "Connected time creeps back up\n\nThis time last year, one of our top stories was that people were spending less time using the internet.\n\nAt the time, average daily internet use had declined by 5 percent year on year, and we wondered whether this might signal a fundamental change in how people use connected tech.\n\nHowever, our latest data reveals that this trend has actually reversed.\n\nLet’s start by exploring overall internet time.\n\nThe time we spend online\n\nOngoing research from GWI shows that the typical internet user now spends 6 hours and 40 minutes online each day.\n\nThat’s up by almost 1 percent compared with this time last year, when internet users reported spending an average of 6 hours and 36 minutes per day using connected tech [note: time values on the chart have been rounded from more granular data, so while the difference looks like 4 minutes, it’s actually closer to 3 minutes].\n\nIt’s important to highlight that revisions to GWI’s methodology over the past year may have affected this change figure, but the fact that these values have remained relatively stable over the past five quarters suggests that this change figure is still representative.\n\nTime online by country\n\nAt the upper end of the scale, South Africans still spend the greatest amount of time online, with the typical user in the country reporting that they spend an average of 9 hours and 24 minutes per day using the internet.\n\nIf we assume that the average person spends between 7 and 8 hours per day sleeping, that figure suggests that the internet now accounts for close to 60 percent of waking hours amongst South Africa’s connected population.\n\nFor perspective, internet adoption in South Africa currently stands at close to 75 percent.\n\nBrazilians rank second by daily online time, with the country’s netizens spending an average of 9 hours and 13 minutes per day using the internet.\n\nAnd Filipinos close out the top 3, with the typical user in the South-East Asian archipelago spending 8 hours and 52 minutes per day online.\n\nHowever, it’s a very different story at the other end of the spectrum.\n\nJapanese people say they spend an average of less than 4 hours per day using the internet, which is over an hour a day less than any other nation in GWI’s survey.\n\nMeanwhile, Denmark sits second-to-bottom, with Danes saying they’re online for an average of just 5 hours and 8 minutes per day.\n\nAnd South Koreans rank third-last, with users spending an average of 5 hours and 19 minutes per day using the internet.\n\nGenerational differences\n\nHowever, there are some subtle differences in these rankings when we cut the data by age.\n\nFor example, younger people are more likely to use online music platforms than they are to use maps and location-based services.\n\nOn the flip-side, music platforms only rank ninth for users aged 55 to 64.\n\nMeanwhile, older generations are more likely to use email compared with today’s youth, but it’s worth pointing out that almost half of all internet users aged 16 to 24 still say that they use email on a monthly basis.\n\nBut perhaps the most noteworthy difference across the ages is that younger people are actually more likely to use social networks than they are to use chat and messaging apps.\n\nThis order is reversed across all other age groups in GWI’s latest survey results, and I confess I was surprised to see social networks at the top of this younger cohort’s activities.\n\nAs we saw in the overall data though, the difference between the two is only very slight, and the key takeaway here is that both activities are hugely popular across all ages.\n\nIs internet use becoming less “purposeful”?\n\nBut this brings us neatly back to another of the trends that I highlighted in my 2023 analysis.\n\nWhen trying to make sense of the decline in online time that we’d seen towards the end of last year, one of the hypotheses I explored with GWI’s Trends team was that people might have been becoming more “purposeful” and “considered” in their online activities.\n\nAs GWI posited in their own analysis of the data:\n\n“There are only so many hours in the day, and people want to know their online time isn’t being wasted.”\n\nI still believe that’s a solid conclusion, but if this was indeed the primary motivation for that erstwhile change in our online behaviour, we might conclude that people have been happy to waste a bit more time online over the past year.\n\nBut then again, a less cynical perspective might be that people tried to achieve more online during 2023.\n\nEither way, GWI’s data reveals that the average number of reasons for going online has crept back up again over the past year, from a low of 7.04 in Q3 2022, to 7.22 in the most recent round of data (Q3 2023).\n\n[Side note: this average is largely determined by the options that people can select from in GWI’s survey. In the chart below, respondents could choose from the same 19 options in each survey “wave”, so the variation in the average represents a like-for-like comparison over time.]\n\nNext up, if we focus solely on users over the age of 18, Instagram’s reported ad reach in the United States still exceeds that of TikTok (162 million vs. 148 million, respectively).\n\nAnd we see a similar story across Western and Northern Europe, with Instagram’s combined adult ad reach across the region (126 million) considerably ahead of TikTok’s reported total (100 million).\n\nHowever, data suggests that TikTok’s adult audience is significantly larger than Instagram’s in other parts of the world.\n\nFor example, across Western Asia, TikTok reports adult ad reach of 149 million, which is more than 20 percent higher than the 122 million for the same cohort reported by Instagram.\n\nSimilarly, TikTok’s reported adult ad reach across the African continent is 72 percent higher than Instagram’s (144 million vs. 84 million, respectively).\n\nAnd finally, TikTok reports adult ad reach of 345 million users across South-Eastern Asia, whereas Instagram only reports reach of 154 million for the same age group across the region.\n\nSo – as is so often the case – different platforms may offer different benefits and advantages, depending on what the marketer is trying to achieve.\n\nEven more options\n\nFor me, the most important takeaway from all of this data is that marketers now have even more compelling options to choose from.\n\nAnd what’s more, the data shows that both platforms continue to grow at impressive rates.\n\nThe Instagram reach figures reported in Meta’s resources suggest that the platform’s global reach has increased by 334 million over the past year, resulting in year-on-year growth of 25.3 percent.\n\nThird-party perspective\n\nFirst up, our analysis of mobile app intelligence from data.ai tells quite a different story to the companies’ ad reach figures, although there are some important similarities too.\n\nBy the end of Q3 2023, data.ai reports that TikTok’s active user base was already larger than Instagram’s across key Northern American markets, albeit only by a very small margin.\n\nTikTok was also significantly ahead of Instagram across top economies in South-Eastern Asia.\n\nHowever, Instagram still led TikTok by a considerable margin across larger economies in Europe, and it was also well ahead across primary markets in Southern America.\n\nOverall, data.ai’s figures suggest that Instagram still leads TikTok, but reduced data availability for lower- and middle-income countries likely skews this finding in Instagram’s favour.\n\nHowever, another key takeaway from data.ai’s intelligence is that both these platforms have each added more active users than any of the other top social platforms over the past few months.\n\nAnd data.ai’s nuanced usage data provides even more valuable perspectives.\n\nComparing time and frequency\n\nThe company’s analysis shows that TikTok had the highest average time per user of any of the top “social” apps between July and September 2023, with the platform’s typical Android user clocking in at 34 hours per month.\n\nIn other words, at a worldwide level, the typical TikTok user now spends an average of more than an hour per day using the platform.\n\nThat’s almost 6 hours per month ahead of second-placed YouTube, which sees an average of slightly over 28 hours per month, per user for its Android app.\n\nThat growth figure might seem quite small in comparison to the ones that we reported above for Instagram and TikTok, but it’s important to remember that the vast majority of China’s internet users already use Weixin.\n\nData from CNNIC (in Mandarin) shows that more than 97 percent of the country’s connected population uses instant messaging, and while there are other messaging options in China, Weixin is by far the most popular choice.\n\nHowever, therein lies the importance of the distinction between WeChat and Weixin.\n\nWhile Tencent groups the two apps together in its reporting, the apps offer quite different benefits.\n\nWeixin is closely integrated into almost every aspect of everyday life in China – both online and offline – to the extent that foreign visitors can often find it difficult to pay for things or get around without it.\n\nHowever, without the benefits of these “network effects”, WeChat has struggled to gain the same level of momentum outside of its domestic market.\n\nIndeed, the latest data from GWI suggests that more than 87 percent of the world’s WeChat users are located in China, and less than 5 percent of the working-age internet population outside of the country says that they use WeChat in any given month.\n\nBut despite these challenges, WeChat continues to grow, and even if its success remains limited to China, at least that success is concentrated in the world’s largest connected market.\n\nThe wonderful world of TikTok hashtags\n\nOne of the most fascinating – and perhaps perplexing – datasets in this year’s report relates to TikTok hashtags.\n\nJust before we dive into the data, it’s important to highlight that there’s no “official” list of the platform’s top tags, nor is there any easy way to identify which ones garner the most attention.\n\nAs a result, this research required an incredibly laborious, manual trawl, and there’s every chance that we’ve missed one or two hashtags that should have featured in this ranking (side note: if you know of one that’s missing, please let me know).\n\nCaveats aside though, this data offers a real treasure trove of insight and inspiration for cultural observers and marketers alike.\n\nIt’s all for you\n\nFirst up, the obvious winner: #fyp.\n\nThis initialism of “for your page” has long been the most popular hashtag on the platform, and is still used by TikTokers everywhere in the hopes of getting their clips featured in the platform’s main feed.\n\nAnd this ubiquity has resulted in some truly staggering results.\n\nData published on the platform itself suggests that TikToks tagged with #fyp have amassed a total of 55½ trillion views.\n\nYes, you read that correctly: trillion.\n\nFor perspective, even if each of those views only lasted for one second, the combined total would equate to 1.76 million years.\n\nBut #fyp isn’t the only hashtag delivering eye-watering view counts.\n\nMoreover, none of the TikTok hashtag guides that we read across the internet whilst preparing this research even mention this tendency to polyglotism.\n\nSo, let’s take a closer look at which non-English tags have gained the most momentum on TikTok so far.\n\n…but it’s still (almost) all for you\n\nFirst up, the Spanish-language equivalent of “for you” – #parati – is the most widely used non-English hashtag on TikTok today, garnering a hefty combined view count of 8.43 trillion.\n\n[Side note for the pedants: it could be argued that the use of the Japanese katakana character, “ツ” – pronounced “tsu” – in #fypツ qualifies that hashtag as the top “non-English” entry, but this character’s popularity stems from its resemblance to a smiling face, and there’s no obvious use of the Japanese language in this particular instance, so I decided to ignore it].\n\nNext up is #xuhuong, which likely relates to the Vietnamese words “xu hướng”, meaning “trend” (note that #trending and #trend both appear as English tags within the top 40 as well).\n\nFor context, TikTok reports close to 68 million users in Vietnam, making it the platform’s fifth-largest country audience.\n\n#Xuhuong is particularly popular amongst users in South-East Asia, and posts featuring this tag have amassed an impressive 2.57 trillion combined views.\n\nHowever, our analysis shows that use of the #xuhuong tag isn’t limited to Vietnamese users.\n\nThe third-most popular non-English tag on TikTok is the Arabic #اكسبلور.\n\nHowever, this tag is an interesting one, because it’s a phonetic transliteration of the word “explore” in English, and isn’t actually a “standard” Arabic word.\n\nIt’s also worth highlighting that this Arabic rendering of “explore” has had more success than the English-language #explore has, with the Arabic version attracting almost a trillion more views.\n\nAnd for added context, it’s worth noting that #اكسبلور has also gained meaningful momentum on Instagram, where it has been used in more than 125 million posts.\n\nNext up in our TikTok tag ranking is the Cyrillic #рекомендации, closely followed by its derivative form, #рек.\n\nThe longer tag is the Russian word for “recommendation”, and posts with this tag had attracted 2.24 trillion views by the time we compiled this list.\n\nAnd for added perspective, TikTok’s latest data indicate that the platform has 58.6 million users in Russia, placing it sixth in our TikTok country ranking.\n\n#Рек literally translates to “rivers” in English, but in this case, TikTok users are likely using it as an abbreviation of “рекомендации”.\n\nHowever, use of this particular abbreviation may also reflect a subtle nod to the “flow” – or “feed” – of content on TikTok’s “For You Page” [I may be reading far too much into that of course, but the nerd in me can’t resist].\n\nNext in our ranking of the most popular non-English tags is #pourtoi, which is the French-language equivalent of “for you”, while #comedia – the Spanish-language word for “comedy” – rounds out this list of non-english tags.\n\nBut there are still a few more tags in the top 40 that are worthy of our attention.\n\nMake me famous\n\nFor the uninitiated, one of the most confusing tags in this list might be #xyzbca.\n\nWith a total of 4.23 trillion combined views, the tag has clearly been used a huge number of times, but the characters themselves don’t actually have any meaning.\n\nAnalysing the potential origins of this tag is probably a bit cringe – it’s quite probably entirely random – but for a Gen Xer like me, it’s vaguely reminiscent of cheat codes from old video games.\n\nBut if that sounds like a stretch, remember why people are using these tags: to “go viral”.\n\nAnd if me writing “go viral” also sounds cringe, take a look at tags 3, 14, and 15 in our top 40 list.\n\nOh, and #goviral has also amassed more than 880 billion views, so – while it doesn’t quite qualify for the top 40 – it’s not far off it.\n\nMoreover, the likelihood of “going viral” on TikTok today is somewhat akin to winning the lottery, so perhaps a “cheat code” isn’t a bad analogy.\n\nHowever, the standout entry for me in this ranking of top TikTok tags is #fyppppppppppppppppppppppp.\n\nNo, I didn’t fall asleep with my finger on the keyboard; that hashtag really is “fy” followed by 23 Ps, and yes, it really has attracted more than 958 billion views.\n\nBut why 23 Ps and not 22 or 24, you ask?\n\nBeats me.\n\nIf you know, I’d genuinely love to know the answer. Drop me a note.\n\nWrapping up\n\nThat’s almost all for this year’s analysis – thanks for making it through 10,000+ words so far! – but you might like to know that we’ll start publishing our Digital 2024 local country reports towards the end of February.\n\nWe’ll share those as soon as they’re ready, but if you’re worried you might have missed something, head over to our complete Global Digital Reports library, where you’ll be able to find everything you need.\n\nAnd just in case you want even more analysis, be sure to check out our complete collection of Digital 2024 Deep Dive articles – you can find all of those here.\n\nBut just before you go…\n\nAnd finally…\n\nWe spent a lot of time earlier in this analysis exploring the ongoing battle for supremacy between Instagram and TikTok.\n\nHowever, a far more storied battle has been taking place across the internet over the past 12 months.\n\nUnlike that social media story though, this battle has a clear winner… at least for this year.\n\nWhen it comes to digital today, it’s all about the dogs.\n\nSome people may tell you that the internet was invented for cats, but – even if that assertion might have held water back in the 90s – canines are well and truly top dog as we enter 2024.\n\nEven a cursory glance at Google search results will tell you that dogs are ahead, with the world’s top search engine returning close to 10 billion pages for “dog”, compared with just 8 billion for “cat”.\n\nYou might pawsit that cats could simply do with better SEO, but it turns out that ranking on the first page of Google probably isn’t felines’ top frustration.\n\nIndeed, our careful analysis of data published by Google Trends reveals that today’s internet users are 80 percent more likely to search for Dogs than they are to search for Cats.\n\nAnd yes, for the G-Trends nerds out there, we used broad search terms for this analysis rather than specific keywords, and we also took a worldwide view across the past 12 months as our base.\n\nCats appear to have the upper hand paw when it comes to Wikipedia though, and the number of people visiting the main page for Cats outnumbers those visiting the main Dog page by a ratio of more than two to one.\n\nIt appears as though supporters of Felis catus have been hard at work too, with the genus’s Wikipedia page now available in 262 languages, compared with Canis lupus familiaris’s 260.\n\nEditors have also made significantly more lifetime edits to the Cat Wikipedia page, outnumbering edits to the Dog page by 15,170 to 12,535.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly though, the Dog page appeared on Wikipedia before the Cat page did – by a whole 34 days.\n\nHowever, Wikipedia was the only triumph for cats in 2023, and when it comes to social media, dogs win – hands paws down.\n\nFor context, Instagram users have published almost 376 million posts to the platform tagged with #dog, compared with just 290 million tagged with #cat.\n\nAnd the #DogsOfTikTok are winning too.\n\nTikToks tagged with #dog have garnered a massive 575 billion views, compared with 502 billion for TikToks tagged with #cat.\n\nAnd just as an aside, this data reveals that the world has collectively viewed posts tagged with either #dog or #cat more than 1 trillion times.\n\nYes, you read that right: it’s ’rillion, with a “T”.\n\nMeanwhile, the dogs are even winning on X.\n\nWe’re fully expecting raucous claims of bot activity and accusations of political bias here, but the numbers don’t lie: the platform-formerly-known-as-Twitter’s own advertising resources reveal that a hefty 291.6 million X users are “interested in” dogs, compared with a meagre 49.2 million users who are “interested in” cats.\n\nSo, what’s the overall conclusion here?\n\nWell, if you represent #TeamDog, it’s perhaps time to freshen up that Wikipedia page, and convert your social media presence into tangible traffic and results.\n\nHowever, if you’re on the side of #TeamCat… well, it may be time for a new agency. If you need any ideas, I have the purrfect suggestion.\n\nThat’s all from me for this year’s flagship analysis, but I’ll be back on your screens in just a few short weeks to bring you the first of our Digital 2024 Quarterly Statshot Reports.\n\nUntil then, #BeMoreDog 🐶\n\nDisclosure: Simon Kemp is a brand ambassador for both GWI and data.ai."
