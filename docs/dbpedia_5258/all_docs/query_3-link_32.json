However, this growth rate decelerated significantly compared to the 10.6% growth in 2021.\n\nOver the next five years, the growth rate is expected to decline further, with revenue projected to grow by only 2.8% from 2026 to 2027.\n\nThis slowdown in E&M revenue growth is primarily attributed to sluggish consumer spending, driven by factors such as inflation, pandemic effects, and geopolitical uncertainties.\n\nConsumer spending on E&M is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.4% between 2022 and 2027, reaching a total of US$903.2 billion by 2027.\n\nAdvertising expenditure is set to surpass consumer spending in 2025, with global advertising revenue expected to rise from US$763.7 billion in 2022 to US$952.6 billion in 2027, representing a CAGR of 4.5%.\n\nInternet access, another major E&M category, is projected to surpass consumer spending in 2026.\n\nDespite increased digitalization in E&M, the cost of production and distribution is decreasing.

However, opportunities for growth exist in advertising, gaming, live events, and the adoption of generative AI technologies. Regulatory and privacy issues also play a significant role in shaping the industry's future.\n\nChina Film Industry Statistics\n\nThe China film industry has shown remarkable resilience and growth, positioning itself for a prosperous future.
