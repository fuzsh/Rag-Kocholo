        "text": "Introduction\n\nEarly reperfusion (i.e. reinstatement of blood flow at the capillary level) is the main therapeutic objective in acute ischemic stroke. As demonstrated in recent trials of intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and thrombectomy, recanalization of the primary arterial occlusion is an effective way of achieving reperfusion and improving clinical outcome.1 Still, although reperfusion and recanalization are closely related, these two phenomena can evolve independently over time. Recanalization without reperfusion (‘no-reflow’) may occur in cases with severely damaged microcirculation.2 Conversely, significant reperfusion without recanalization can be observed in up to 30% of patients within the first 6 h of symptoms onset.3 Available data suggest that reperfusion is a stronger predictor of tissue and clinical outcome than recanalization.3 –6\n\nWe previously hypothesized that efficient retrograde collateral flow from leptomeningeal anastomoses likely underlies reperfusion without recanalization.3 Cortical collaterals can mitigate the lack of anterograde flow and prolong the survival of, or even revert the ischemic penumbra. Good collaterals are strongly associated with slower infarct growth, lower risk of hemorrhagic transformation, increased likelihood of reperfusion and favorable clinical outcome.7 –11\n\nBecause assessing collateral status may assist in patient triage and acute treatment decisions, and help evaluate novel treatments aiming at enhancing collateral flow, non-invasive imaging of collaterals by means of computed tomography (CT)-angiography and CT or MR-based perfusion imaging has gained increasing attention lately.7,12 –16 Collateral grades at baseline, generated from dynamic susceptibility-contrast perfusion imaging (DSC-PI), were found to be well correlated with digital subtraction angiography (DSA) collateral grades,14 subsequent lesion growth13,14 and clinical outcome.14 In our previous work, lower hypoperfusion intensity ratio (proportion of voxels with Tmax ≥7 s within the Tmax ≥2 s lesion), an indirect marker of good collaterals, was observed at baseline in patients showing subsequent reperfusion without recanalization.3\n\nStill, only limited data so far have related the evolution of collateral flow to infarct growth13 or clinical outcome,17 and these studies explored late follow-up time points only (i.e. ≥24 h). In the present unique study of acute ischemic stroke patients in whom both presence of arterial occlusion and perfusion were assessed twice, acutely and again within 6 hours of onset, we determined whether acute reperfusion despite no recanalization is associated with: (1) good collaterals at baseline, as defined by DSC-PI-derived collateral maps; and (2) improved retrograde collateral flow over time. Our ancillary objective was to assess whether MRI-based collateral maps can detect acute changes in collateral flow.\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn this unique study of hyperacute stroke patients in whom perfusion MRI was obtained at baseline and again a few hours later, we investigated the relationship between reperfusion, recanalization and cortical collaterals. In agreement with our hypotheses, acute reperfusion without recanalization was significantly related to better collaterals at baseline, and subsequently, improved retrograde flow through cortical collaterals resulting in retrograde tissue reperfusion.\n\nThis is the first study to assess the hyperacute (<6 h) dynamics of leptomeningeal collateral flow in ischemic stroke. Only two previous studies reported on the evolution of collaterals and its impact on tissue or clinical outcome. Campbell et al.13 found that deterioration of collaterals was associated with increased hypoperfusion severity and infarct growth. However, causality was uncertain given the delayed follow-up assessment (day 3–5), when extensive infarction and edema can severely impede retrograde (or anterograde) flow. Interestingly, using CT-angiography, Yeo et al.17 recently reported that in patients without recanalization or with poor collaterals at baseline, late (i.e. 24 h) recruitment of cortical collaterals was associated with worse clinical outcome and higher mortality. Because these patients are likely to experience faster lesion growth and larger infarcts, a delayed increase in collateral flow may foster harmful reperfusion injury. Thus, acute and delayed changes in collaterals may have entirely distinct causes and effects.\n\nThree main mechanisms account for the positive effects of collaterals: (i) prolonged survival of the ischemic tissue via improved tissue perfusion,10 and hence extended therapeutic time window; (ii) increased rate of recanalization,8 possibly related to an improved delivery of exogenous and endogenous thrombolytics to the distal side of the clot; and (iii) reduced damage to the microcirculation implying a lesser risk of subsequent no-reflow in the event of recanalization, be it therapeutic or spontaneous. Our results suggest that even in patients without recanalization, increasing collateral flow within the first 6 h after vessel occlusion may promote reperfusion and in turn a favourable clinical outcome. In the same cohort, we previously reported that acute reperfusion was an independent predictor of good functional outcome, regardless of recanalization.3 The present study suggests that retrograde reperfusion via pial collaterals may be of similar clinical benefit as is anterograde reperfusion.\n\nSo far, the majority of research on non-invasive imaging of collaterals has used static images from single-phase CT-angiography.7,12,27,28 More recent studies highlighted the superior prognostic value of dynamic data, using either multiphase CT-angiography29 or various post-processing of CT-perfusion.30 –32 Subtracted DSC-PI inherently combines an assessment of both the anatomical extent and the velocity of collateral flow. This approach was first described by Campbell et al.13 Kim et al.14 modified this approach by merging multiple time frames, producing summary collateral maps at early, mid and late phases. Two other recent reports evaluated collaterals with subtracted DSC-PI.16,33 One can visualize the entire dynamic series (∼50 time-frames amounting to ∼1000 images),13,16,33 or as in the present study, merge multiple frames into three main flow phases.14 Using temporally summated maps, our inter-rater agreement (weighted kappa: 0.85) was higher than in reports using non-summated maps (weighted kappa: 0.5816 and 0.7113). This could suggest that summated maps may be easier to interpret, but this hypothesis will require an independent comparison. Our study also indicates that applying the Higashida scale on subtracted DSC-PI is an effective, non-invasive method for detecting changes in collateral flow during the first 6 h, i.e. the most critical period for tissue and clinical outcome.\n\nDo subtracted DSC-PI collateral maps have an added value to routinely available diffusion and perfusion MRI? Previous data have shown that MRI-based collaterals are strongly correlated with the baseline DWI lesion size,13,14,16 an established marker of outcome, as well as with hypoperfusion severity on Tmax maps.13,16,34 Accordingly, the baseline DWI lesion size has been found independently associated with infarct growth and clinical outcome, whereas collateral grade did not improve these predictive models.13,14,16 Recently, Potreck et al.15 introduced yet another DSC-PI based method of assessing cortical collaterals: the extent of severe Tmax delay (≥10 s) within the subarachnoid space was determined and found to correlate with DSA. Fast pial collaterals (Tmax ≥10 s in < 1% of the subarachnoid volume) were associated with favorable clinical outcome, and appeared to add to the prognostic value of the standard DWI-Tmax mismatch ratio. However, the baseline DWI lesion volume was not considered in the predictive model. Thus, additional studies are required to determine whether the evaluation of cortical collaterals increases the predictive information of standard core and penumbra imaging. Still, collateral maps present potential advantages over the latter, namely simpler post-processing steps compared to those required to derive core, penumbra and mismatch maps from MRI or CT-perfusion, and a straightforward grading system well-correlated with the Higashida DSA scale, which could translate into easier implementation and improved reproducibility between multiple centers.\n\nOur study has some limitations. Our analyses were based on a limited population with mostly distal (>M1) occlusions. The frequency and clinical impact of retrograde reperfusion will require further evaluation in homogenous cohorts with proximal occlusions. The evaluation of our patients did not include DSA. Although MRI-defined collaterals were well correlated with DSA in a previous study,14 our results would benefit from an independent validation using catheter angiography. Admittedly, iterative examinations with DSA may be limited to specific settings (e.g. trials of invasive collateral therapeutics such as partial aortic occlusion). Intravenous tPA was not associated with improved reperfusion rates or clinical outcome. Although it may suggest that tPA has no significant effect on collaterals and retrograde reperfusion, limitations inherent to a non-randomized study of limited size preclude any definite conclusion.\n\nIn conclusion, we documented that acute reperfusion without recanalization was related to improved retrograde collateral flow. Perfusion-weighted MRI can detect acute changes in collateral circulation, and may help evaluate novel treatments targeting leptomeningeal collaterals."
