        "text": "When temperatures hit triple-digits, older residents can feel more distress from heat and humidity and often have fewer options for beating the heat.\n\nThe City of Lakewood wants to remind seniors that the air-conditioned Weingart Senior Center is a comfortable oasis, especially during the hottest time of the day--from noon to 4:00 p.m.\n\nSeniors can use the free DASH Transit service as transportation to Weingart if they can’t drive or don’t have a ride. For more information on DASH, call 562-924-0149.\n\nWeingart Senior Center is located at 5220 Oliva Avenue and can be reached at 562-630-6141. Its hours are Monday through Friday, 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and Saturday, 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. The facility is closed on Sundays.\n\nUse the \"Park Finder\" to see Google Maps of all facilities: www.lakewoodcity.org/ParkFinder.\n\nThese city facilities offer relief from the heat for patrons of all ages, during normal business hours:\n\nBloomfield Park, 21420 Pioneer Boulevard, 562-865-1717\n\nMayfair Park, 5720 Clark Avenue, 562-866-4776\n\nBurns Community Center, 5510 Clark Ave., 562-925-7512\n\nTips for staying cool without air conditioning\n\nWet your wrists and neck with cold water.\n\nWear light, loose-fitting clothing.\n\nUse perspiration to cool the body down. Water vapor produced by sweating actually takes heat away from your body if it is exposed to air and allowed to evaporate. Put yourself in the path of a cool breeze or fan.\n\nDrink water, even if you are not thirsty! You must replace the fluids lost in perspiration to prevent dehydration.\n\nAvoid direct sunlight. Stay in a shaded area if possible.\n\nKeep the air flowing. Turn on the ceiling fan or box fan in the room.\n\nPrepare your home against the heat. In the evening, open windows and use fans to create a cross-breeze, circulating cooler evening air through the rooms. Open your kitchen cupboards at night; if you leave them closed, they store the heat and your house won’t cool off as much.\n\nGet Wet! Take a cool shower or bath. Wet your hair. Fill a basin with water and sit with your feet in it.\n\nPlace a wet towel on the back of your neck and also on the top of your head.\n\nTake your shoes and hat off when you are indoors.\n\nBeating the heat: Prevention is the key\n\nGetting out of the heat is a healthy decision. Elderly residents who live alone and infants are at highest risk for getting heat-related illness caused by overheating and dehydration.\n\n\"It starts with dehydration,” says Cyrus Rangan, director of the L.A. County Department of Health Services Toxic Epidemiology Department. “The body doesn't get enough water to do basic functions,\" Rangan notes. \"Your blood pressure dips, heart rate goes up, cardiovascular system breaks down. There is less blood flow to your lungs, heart, and kidneys. Your muscles cramp and you get very thirsty and confused.\"\n\nRangan suggests staying inside an air-conditioned room at midday or anytime it's hotter than 90 degrees outside. Libraries, Lakewood Center mall, movie theaters and supermarkets also are good places to spend time rather than swelter.\n\nSuggestions for staying cooler\n\nStay in the shade and out of direct sunlight.\n\nApply sunscreen with SPF 15 or higher 30 minutes before going outside. Sunburn affects your body's ability to cool itself and causes a loss of fluids.\n\nTake a slightly cool bath or shower.\n\nPut cool, damp towels on your body.\n\nUse fans to keep air circulating.\n\nAvoid strenuous activities. If engaging in strenuous activities, pace yourself and rest frequently.\n\nWear light-colored, lightweight, loose clothing made out of a material that allows sweat to evaporate such as cotton.\n\nAvoid synthetic materials like polyester.\n\nProtect your head and neck when outside by wearing a wide-brimmed hat or using an umbrella.\n\nDrink frequently to replace fluids lost by sweating. Avoid fluids containing alcohol, caffeine or salt. If you have a problem with retaining water or a special medical condition, check with your doctor about the amount of fluids you should be drinking.\n\nAvoid hot foods and heavy meals, since it adds heat to your body. If you use a stove, try to cook during cooler times of the day.\n\nIf you live alone, ask a friend or relative to check on you at least twice a day.\n\nDon't ignore the warning signs of heat stress.\n\nContact a doctor or other health care provider if the mild signs of heat stress continue for a prolonged period after taking these actions.\n\nContact a physician immediately if you are experiencing any of the following serious symptoms of heat stress: breathing problems, chest pain, muscle cramps, diarrhea, dizziness, dry skin (no sweating), great weakness, mental changes, confusion, nausea, rapid heartbeat, throbbing headache, extremely high body temperature (above 103 degrees Fahrenheit when taken orally) and/or vomiting.\n\nThe mildest form of heat-related illnesses is heat cramps, when the body loses water and electrolytes. Heat exhaustion is more serious, and will cause the body's temperature to rise to 102 degrees. People may also experience headache, fatigue, heavy sweating, nausea, and clammy skin.\n\nHeat stroke is the most severe heat-related illness. Extreme exertion, like running very fast in hot, humid weather, causes your body temperature to rise to 104 degrees and more, and can cause more severe symptoms like vomiting, diarrhea, a speeding pulse and disorientation. Last year, a dozen people died of heat stroke in Los Angeles County."
