        "text": "I take photographs using all types of film. And when when I turn in a mixed collection of film types for processing unless I take great care in marking the film packages when I get them back from the processor what type of film is in which package is unknown. This can be a problem when you need to know what type of film was used to do a correct print.\n\nTo solve this problem I went to Kodak’s web site and tried to find out what what the number printed on the film meant. I searched their site and found only three (single) references. So then I wrote Kodak an e-mail from their site asking them if there was a film cross reference table on their web site. They answered back “no” but sent me four sheets (8 pages) showing the film cross-references. The data sheets were dated May 1993. I then scanned them in saving it as text using my HP scanner.\n\nI received this sheets at no charge in less than 3 days after I sent my e-mail. Very good service from Kodak.\n\nNote: I reviewed the OCR conversion a few time but there still may be an error or two in this table. Due to the age of the data sheets I had to manually input in the newer films (Portra, Ektachrome, TMax and others). Other people have also sent me e-mails noting corrections and additions.\n\nMany thanks to Thomas M. Scarsella of NASA for hundreds of additional entries.\n\nUpdated December, 2010.\n\nNotes: Some film have same code but different numbers! Also some of the newest film is not yet in this table.\n\nIn honor of expired film . . ."
