Whereas forGalaxy S10 Series, Super Slow-mo video(0.4 sec or 0.8 sec) could be played as approximately 14.8 sec.\n\n• Normal Video (30fps) : Video is played at the same speed as the actual movementor 27.6 sec long.\n\n• Slow Motion Video (240fps) : Video is played 8 times slower than normal one, similar to the typical movie, commercial, or sports speed\n\n• Super Slow Motion Video (960fps) : Images are played 32 times slower than normal ones, capturing small changes in facial expressions and minute movements of fast-moving objects"
