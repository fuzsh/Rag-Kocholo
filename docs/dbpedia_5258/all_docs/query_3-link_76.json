        "text": "In the increasingly competitive smartphone market, people meticulously examine each and every feature that smartphones have to offer, from screen size to processing power, before choosing the best smartphone for them.\n\nA relative newcomer to the ranks of sought-after features is fast charging. Technology now allows for a quick charge during the limited downtime we find in our busy day-to-day lives. Who wouldn’t want a smartphone that charges in minutes instead of hours?\n\nIf only it were that simple. Charging standards are a complicated mix of chemistry and physics, and each has its own sets of limitations, with incompatibility an issue as well. To make matters worse, smartphone manufacturers tend to slap confusing labels on their charging tech.\n\nSo how does fast charging work? Take a deep breath. Our guide to the most popular wireless charging standards on the market breaks them down to their most basic level. Here is everything you need to know about Samsung Adaptive Fast Charging, USB Power Delivery, Qualcomm Quick Charge, OnePlus Warp Charge, and more.\n\nThe basics\n\nHow fast charging works\n\nBefore we dive into the weeds, let’s start with the fundamentals.\n\nEvery smartphone has a battery, and every battery delivers power in more or less the same way.\n\nCells consisting of two electrodes (one positive and one negative) and an electrolyte catalyze reactions that convert compounds into new substances. Over time, ions — atoms with too few or too many electrons — form in the electrodes, driving a flow of electrons to the battery’s negative outer terminal and supplying your phone with an electric charge.\n\nIn non-rechargeable batteries, those chemical reactions occur only once. But in the rechargeable lithium-ion batteries that power smartphones, the reactions are “reversible.” When the battery discharges, the chemical reaction produces electricity, and when the battery recharges, the chemical reactions absorb power.\n\nFast charging\n\nSo we’ve established how batteries charge and discharge. But to understand how fast charging works, you have to know a bit about something called a charge controller.\n\nA quick side note:\n\nSince we’ll be referring to volts, amps, and watts in the course of our discussion, here’s a refresher. Volts are a measure of voltage, amps are a measure of current, and watts are a measure of electrical power. A common analogy is a garden hose: Volts are equivalent to the water pressure in the hose; the current is equivalent to the flow rate; wattage is equivalent to the volume of the spout’s spray. Watts, then, are the product of volts and amps — volts (V) times amps (A) equals watts (W).\n\nGreater current and higher voltages charge batteries faster, but there’s a limit to what they can take.\n\nSmartphone batteries charge when a current passes through them. Greater current and higher voltages charge batteries faster, but there’s a limit to what they can take. The charge controller (IC) protects against dangerous spikes in current.\n\nThe controller chip regulates the overall flow of electricity into and out of the battery. Generally speaking, lithium-ion controllers define the current (in amps) at which the battery charges by measuring the battery’s cell current and voltage and then adjusting the current flowing in. Some use a DC-to-DC converter to change the input voltage, and fancier integrated circuits adjust the resistance between the charger input and the battery terminal to ramp the current flow up or down.\n\nThe amount of current the charge controller draws is generally dictated by the phone’s software.\n\nUSB charging standards\n\nUnless you’re still rocking a Palm Pilot from the early ’90s, chances are your smartphone recharges via a USB cable. There’s a really good reason: Besides the fact that USB cables are relatively easy to find these days, USB has a really robust, well-defined charging standard called the USB Power Delivery Specification.\n\nThe USB Implementers Forum specifies several types, one for each corresponding USB specification: USB 1.0, 2.0, 3.0/3.1/3.2, and USB4. USB 1.0 and 2.0 are increasingly rare and incompatible with our modern smartphones. By default, USB 3.0 ports push 5V/0.9A (4.5W).\n\nBut by upgrading to the physical USB-C connection (the oval-shaped reversible plug on newer smartphones) and USB 3.1 (and versions after it), PD can become a different animal altogether. It’s technically capable of carrying the USB 2.0 spec, but most manufacturers opt for the latest standards like USB 3.2 or USB4, which can potentially deliver a much higher voltage.\n\nThese later USB standards allow devices to take advantage of the USB Power Delivery (USB-PD) spec, which, as of USB-PD version 3.1, has a maximum power output of 48V (240W) charging, although devices tend to stick with the 20V/5A (100W) version for the time begin. Smartphones don’t draw that much power yet — manufacturers commonly stick with a lower amperage (like 3A), but it’s a boon for USB-C laptops like the MacBook Pro and Google Chromebook Pixel.\n\nSlightly complicating things is the Battery Charging Specification, which deals specifically with power drawn from a USB port for charging. The most recent spec, Rev 1.2, defines three different sources of power: Standard downstream port (SDP), charging downstream port (CDP), and dedicated charging port (DCP). CDP, the spec in modern smartphones, laptops, and other hardware, can supply up to 1.5A.\n\nFully compliant smartphones and chargers respect the limits of USB 2.0 and BC1.2, but not all phones and chargers are compliant. That’s why, generally speaking, smartphones always default to the lowest charging speed.\n\nThe USB specs are more like guidelines than dictum, though. Fast-charging standards like Qualcomm’s Quick Charge and Samsung’s Adaptive Fast Charging may exceed the USB spec’s voltage parameters, but on purpose — that’s why your phone is able to recharge in minutes rather than hours.\n\nFast charging standards: What’s the difference?\n\nUSB-PD also only provides the power the device needs, so the same USB-PD charger could charge a smartphone at top speed but then also charge a laptop at its top speed.\n\nDifferent manufacturers employ the USB-PD standard differently. Here’s how Apple and Google use it, for example.\n\nApple fast charging via USB-PD\n\nPros\n\nUSB-PD, an industry standard, works with a growing number of devices.\n\nCons\n\nYou’ll have to shell out a few bucks to take advantage — Apple doesn’t include USB-PD-compatible chargers in the box for many of its phones.\n\nThe USB Power Delivery (USB-PD) standard was developed by the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF), and it’s a standard that any manufacturer can use on any device with a USB port. It’s capable of delivering up to 100W, so it’s suitable for use with all kinds of devices beyond smartphones, including some laptops, provided they have a USB-C port. USB-PD brings other benefits, too. The direction of the power is not fixed, so you will find portable battery chargers, for example, that have a USB-C port that can be used both to charge another device or to charge the battery pack itself.\n\nApple iPhones from the iPhone 8 through the iPhone 12 models implement USB-PD, the same industry standard used by the iPad Pro, the 12-inch MacBook, Google’s Chromebook Pixel, and Lenovo’s X1 Carbon. Intercompatibility is its biggest advantage — USB-PD doesn’t require any special cables or wall adapters.\n\nSupported outputs, cables, and adapters\n\nYou’ll have to shell out for accessories if you want to take advantage of the iPhone’s USB-PD compatibility because Apple hasn’t packed USB-C cables or adapters in iPhone boxes until recently. You’ll also need to buy a Lightning to USB-C cable that supports USB-PD — if you use a standard Lightning cable with a USB-C to USB-A adapter, the charger will default to the lowest wattage.\n\nHere’s what Apple recommends:\n\nApple 18W, 20W, 29W, 30W, 61W, 87W, or 96W USB-C Power Adapter.\n\nA comparable third-party USB-C power adapter that supports USB Power Delivery (USB-PD).\n\nCharging speed\n\nNo matter which USB-C charger you buy, you’ll have to put up with hard-coded safety limits in your iPhone. Fast charge kicks in when the capacity is between 0% and 79% but stops when it reaches 80%.\n\nIf you don’t mind forking over a few extra dollars for charging accessories, you get much faster charging than you would otherwise. The fast charging iPhones can charge from 0% to 50% in 30 minutes using USB-PD.\n\nGoogle fast charging via USB-PD\n\nPros\n\nThe same USB-PD kit will work with a number of devices.\n\nGoogle supplies a fast charging charger and cable in the box.\n\nCons\n\nThe top speeds aren’t quite as fast as some other manufacturers offer.\n\nEvery Google Pixel phone, from the original to the Pixel 4a, is capable of fast wired charging up to 18W using the USB-PD standard. It doesn’t require any special chargers or cables.\n\nSupported outputs, cables, and adapters\n\nYou can use the charger and cable in the box with your Pixel phone to enjoy maximum charging speeds. If you go for third-party accessories, use any USB-C with USB 2.0 power adapters and cables. If you use a USB-C to USB-A cable, then it will charge your Pixel more slowly, regardless of the power adapter you connect to.\n\nCharging speed\n\nA Pixel phone can charge rapidly from 0% up to around 80% but will slow down beyond that point. You’ll find the same limitations with most phones.\n\nUsing the cable and 18W adapter supplied or any decent third-party one with a similar or higher rating, you can get seven hours of use from a 15-minute charge.\n\nQualcomm Quick Charge\n\nPros\n\nOne of the most widely implemented charging standards.\n\nBackward compatible with older versions of Quick Charge.\n\nBuilt-in safety features prevent overheating and short-circuiting.\n\nCons\n\nQuick Charge 3.0 isn’t USB-PD compliant.\n\nChipmaker Qualcomm’s Quick Charge is one of the most widely implemented charging standards on the market. That’s no mistake — it’s an optional feature of Qualcomm system-on-chip technology, like the Snapdragon 855, 845, 835, 820, 620, 618, 617, 430, and others, which powers phones like the Samsung Galaxy S10, Google Pixel 3, and LG V40 ThinQ. But the technology isn’t tied to Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors — any smartphone manufacturer is free to license Quick Charge’s power controller technology.\n\nTech specs and compatible adapters\n\nQuick Charge achieves fast charging by upping the charging voltage, which in turn boosts the wattage. Announced in July 2020, Quick Charge 5 is the latest standard in the series, promising the ability to recharge phones to 50% in five minutes. While support is currently limited to recent phones such as the Samsung Galaxy S20, Quick Charge 4.0+ support is growing in popularity. You can find it in phones like the LG G8 ThinQ, Razer Phone 2, and Xiaomi Mi Mix 3, and it can deliver up to 27W of power.\n\nQuick Charge 4 and newer have the added bonus of compatibility with USB-PD chargers, but Quick Charge 3.0 and older only work with Quick Charge-certified accessories. Still, Quick Charge’s ubiquity means there are plenty to choose from. Qualcomm’s website has a partial list of the most popular options.\n\nCharging speed\n\nQualcomm claims that Quick Charge 5 can fully recharge smartphones in 15 minutes and take a phone to 50% in just five minutes.\n\nIn our testing, Quick Charge 4+ took the Razer Phone 2’s big 4,000mAh battery from 18% to 90% in just over an hour.\n\nSafety measures\n\nQuick Charge’s intelligent thermal balancing moves current via the coolest path, and device sensors monitor the case and connector temperatures to prevent overheating and short-circuiting.\n\nSamsung Super Fast Charging and Adaptive Fast Charging\n\nPros\n\nBuilt into all Samsung devices.\n\nAdaptive Fast Charging compatible with Quick Charge 2.0 and Super Fast Charging compatible with USB PD.\n\nCons\n\nTends to be conservative.\n\nSamsung’s Adaptive Fast Charging is exclusive to Galaxy devices. Unlike Quick Charge and other competing fast standards, it’s fully compatible with Exynos, the system-on-chip commonly found in international variants of Samsung’s devices.\n\nSamsung introduced Super Fast Charging with the Samsung Galaxy S10 5G. This phone has a 4,500mAh battery and supports up to 25W charging with the USB Power Delivery 3.0 PPS (Programmable Power Supply) charging standard. The Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus hits even higher speeds, using Super Fast Charging 2.0 (as do later models such as the S20 and Note 20). However, to hit the fastest charging it’s capable of requires a special adapter with an unusual 10V and 4.5A rating to output 45W, which means it also requires a 5A cable.\n\nTech specs and compatible adapters\n\nSamsung’s Adaptive Fast Charging has a theoretical peak of 9V/2A (18W), while Super Fast Charging has a peak of 10V/4.5A (45W) with a travel adapter and 25W when plugged into a normal charger. Both standards tend to be a bit more conservative in practice. Tapping into the highest speeds of either requires buying a certified charger, but most Samsung devices support either Quick Charge- or PPS-compatible accessories.\n\nCharging speed\n\nSamsung doesn’t publish charging times for Adaptive Fast Charging or Super Fast Charging. But in our testing, the Galaxy S8, which has a 3,000mAh battery, took about two hours to fully recharge. The Note 10 Plus took about one hour to fully recharge using the Super Fast Charging standard.\n\nSafety measures\n\nAdaptive Fast Charging technical stats are hard to come by, but anecdotally speaking, it’s on the conservative side. According to XDA’s detailed analysis of fast charging standards, the Galaxy S8 Plus maintains the coolest temperature of any fast-charging flagship on the market.\n\nMotorola TurboPower\n\nPros\n\nBuilt into all Motorola devices.\n\nCompatible with Quick Charge 3.0.\n\nCons\n\nNot as fast as some charging standards.\n\nMotorola’s TurboPower standard, a tweaked version of Quick Charge 3.0, ships on Motorola devices like the Moto G Power 2021.\n\nTech specs and compatible adapters\n\nTurboPower adapters come in three flavors: TurboPower 15, TurboPower 25, and TurboPower 30. The fastest, TurboPower 30, delivers 5V and up to 5.7A for roughly 28.5W of power.\n\nThere’s more to TurboPower than the charger. Motorola says it works with manufacturers to design custom batteries and that its power management software monitors battery state and health, then adjusts the incoming charge accordingly.\n\nMuch like Samsung Adaptive Fast Charge, you don’t need a TurboPower adapter in order to fast charge a TurboPower-equipped smartphone. Motorola’s charging standard is compatible with any Quick Charge 3.0 (or newer) adapter.\n\nCharging speed\n\nMotorola claims TurboPower 30 can deliver up to 15 hours of battery life in 15 minutes.\n\nSafety measures\n\nTurboPower’s thermal management hardware is designed to avoid charging slowdowns due to heat, Motorola says, and to maintain a steady and fast charging rate.\n\nOnePlus Warp Charge and Oppo VOOC\n\nPros\n\nKeeps phones cooler.\n\nOne of the fastest charging standards.\n\nAdapters included with compatible smartphones.\n\nCons\n\nHighly proprietary.\n\nShenzhen, China-based OnePlus licenses Warp Charge (originally called Dash Charge) from Oppo. It’s based on Oppo’s VOOC (Voltage Open Multi-Step Constant-Current Charging) system and is a headline feature in the OnePlus 6T and every other OnePlus phone back to the OnePlus 3. Oppo has also developed the much faster Super VOOC, but it’s only available in a handful of phones like the Oppo RX17 Pro.\n\nTech specs and compatible adapters\n\nWarp Charge uses a special wall adapter that modulates the amperage in real-time. A microcontroller monitors charge level and syncs with the phone’s circuitry to regulate voltage and current, and a custom-designed cable delivers greater current while minimizing power fluctuations.\n\nAll this is proprietary. Warp Charge only works with OnePlus phones and compatible wall adapters and car chargers. Warp Charge-certified external batteries are hard to come by, and OnePlus’ fast charging standard doesn’t work with off-the-shelf USB cables — Warp Charge cables are slightly thicker to accommodate the extra voltage.\n\nYou won’t have to shell out extra if you buy a OnePlus phone, though. Every OnePlus smartphone comes with a Warp Charge-compatible wall adapter and charging cord.\n\nCharging speed\n\nWe found that Warp Charge proved very effective when charging the OnePlus 9 Pro from zero to 100% in 31 minutes.\n\nOppo claims VOOC-enabled phones can charge to 75% in 30 minutes. When we charged the Super VOOC system with the Oppo RX17 Pro, it went from 0% to 40% in just 10 minutes.\n\nSafety measures\n\nWarp Charge is designed to dissipate heat quickly. Because the charger transforms the high voltage from the adapter’s power source into a lower voltage, most of the heat from the conversion never reaches the phone, and the consistent current reduces the potential for thermal throttling.\n\nWarp Charge-compatible devices also have heat management and dissipation hardware that undergo a thorough five-point safety check.\n\nHuawei SuperCharge\n\nPros\n\nCompatibility with USB-PD.\n\nThorough safety measures.\n\nAdapters included with compatible smartphones.\n\nCons\n\nPotentially slower than some standards.\n\nSuperCharge, Chinese smartphone maker Huawei’s proprietary charging standard, is built into phones like the Huawei P40 Pro, Huawei P30 Pro, Huawei Mate 20 Pro, and the Huawei P10. It’s a bit like Quick Charge in that it uses higher-than-average voltages to achieve faster charging, but there’s slightly more to it than meets the eye.\n\nTech specs and compatible adapters\n\nSuperCharge automatically adapts the incoming wall voltage and current based on the condition of the phone’s battery and the phone’s internal temperature. Older SuperCharge-compatible wall adapters and car chargers support three charging modes — 5V/2A, 4.5V/5A, and 5V/4.5A (up to 22.5W) — and use an in-charger chipset to regulate voltage, eliminating the need for heat-producing in-phone voltage transformation. The latest version offers 10V/4A for up to 40W.\n\nUnlike proprietary charging standards like Pump Express and Dash Charge, Supercharge is compatible with USB-PD. That’s thanks to Huawei’s Smart Charge protocol, which intelligently switches between charging modes depending on which charging adapter is plugged in.\n\nTapping into Huawei’s SuperCharge technology requires buying a compatible wall adapter, but native compatibility with Qualcomm’s Quick Charge standard means any SuperCharge-compatible devices can take advantage of Quick Charge. Every SuperCharge-compatible smartphone comes with a compatible wall adapter.\n\nCharging speed\n\nHuawei’s latest charger claims to support SuperCharge speeds up to 135W, although it has not yet been released, and Huawei is not producing smartphones that can take anything more than around 44W.\n\nSafety measures\n\nThe SuperCharge feature, along with Smart Charge, is available on Huawei devices. This unique tool can read whatever charger you’re using and pinpoint its optimal capacity. From there, the tool can modify the charger’s voltage as it needs.\n\nProducers created SuperCharge with specific design features to carefully control higher currents. Some of those components include an eight-part cooling system and a lining that can keep devices 5 degrees Celsius cooler than other charging methods. Huawei Supercharge devices are built to last, and they’re thoroughly tested to ensure that products meet rigorous safety and performance standards. The company will test their devices in a year-long trial to observe their products under extreme conditions over time.\n\nThe future of fast charging\n\nWe know this is the understatement of the year, but technology is rapidly evolving. You can bet that fast charging will soon be the universal standard and will likely slowly replace average chargers over the next several years. Thanks to major growth in integrated circuitry, charge controllers, adapters, and cords, phones could soon potentially recharge over the span of just a few minutes instead of several hours. Early-model fast chargers recently gained popularity for their promises to increase your device’s portability and charge quickly."
