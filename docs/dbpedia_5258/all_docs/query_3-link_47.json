        "text": "Last Updated: July 12, 2024\n\nStaying relevant and capturing your audience’s attention is a constant challenge for marketers. And now that brands rely on video content more than ever, it’s critical to use the correct social media video specs and advertising video sizes.\n\nTo simplify marketers’ efforts, we created a complete guide of every single social media video spec and advertising video dimension.\n\nBefore we start, here are some additional resources that keep the information in one place:\n\nEasily reference our social media video specs in our always up-to-date Google Doc.\n\nCheck out our social media image sizes guide for help on static images.\n\nWant to get better results with video? Download our social media video content workbook.\n\nFind more information about Sprout-supported files and sizes in our Help Center.\n\nSocial Media Video Specs & Ad Sizes By Network\n\nWe’ve gathered data on each social network’s specific video sizes and specs. Simply click the links below to jump to your desired network:\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nTikTok\n\nTwitter\n\nYouTube\n\nLinkedIn\n\nPinterest\n\nSnapchat\n\nStart your free trial\n\nFacebook Video Specs\n\nFacebook video is consumed at higher rates each year, so it’s no wonder why so many marketers search for the correct Facebook video specs.\n\nThere are simply so many types of videos you can share on Facebook and the platform updates its design frequently. Each video format has different dimensions and specs, which can make it confusing to know whether or not you’re uploading the correct format for organic or paid posts. Follow the specs below to optimize your posts.\n\nIn-Feed Shared Post Video (Landscape & Portrait)\n\nThe most common type of video on Facebook comes from shared posts. This type of video lives in your Facebook Feed, and can be shared by brands or your friends. While it’s not as easy to get organic reach on Facebook, it’s still a viable way to share video.\n\nYou can choose between two video orientations: Landscape and Portrait. Here’s a look at the video specs for both.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nResolution: 1280×720, 720×1280\n\nMinimum width: 1200 pixels\n\nAspect ratio: 16:9, 9:16\n\nMax file size: 10GB (3GB max in Sprout)\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4, MOV\n\nVideo length: 1 second to 240 minutes (45 minutes max, if uploading in Sprout)\n\nBitrate: 256kbps\n\nFrame rate: 30fps\n\nFacebook Reels\n\nThe convenience of cross-posting your Instagram Reels to Facebook expands the reach of your videos. This format appears organically in feeds but often gets priority on Facebook feeds.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nResolution: 1080p\n\nAspect ratio: 9:16\n\nMax file size: No file size limit\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4\n\nVideo length: 3 seconds to 90 seconds\n\nFrame rate: 24fps – 60fps (30fp recommended in Sprout)\n\nFacebook Stories\n\nSimilar to Instagram Stories, you can post Facebook Stories to extend the reach of your posts. Users who may not follow you on Instagram will be able to view and interact with your Stories.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nResolution: 1080p\n\nMinimum width: 500 pixels\n\nAspect ratio: 9:16 and 4:5 to 1.91:1\n\nMax file size: 4GB\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4 or MOV\n\nVideo length: 1 second to 60 seconds\n\nFacebook Video Ad Specs\n\nThere are more than 10 million advertisers now on Facebook and having the right specs for your ads can be tricky. Each type of Facebook video ad is different, so let’s break down the specs for each type of video you can produce.\n\nIn-Feed Video Ads\n\nThese Facebook video ads are the sponsored equivalent of in-feed posts, and they follow similar guidelines to in-feed video posts.\n\nVideo guidelines\n\nResolution: 1080×1080 minimum\n\nMinimum width: 120 pixels\n\nMinimum height: 120 pixels\n\nAspect ratio: 1:1 (for desktop or mobile) or 4:5 (for mobile only)\n\nMax file size: 4GB\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4, MOV or GIF\n\nVideo length: 1 seconds to 240 minutes\n\nFrame rate: 30fps\n\nCharacter limits\n\nPrimary text: 125 characters\n\nHeadline: 27 characters\n\nDescription: 27 characters\n\nCarousel Video Ads\n\nFacebook Carousel Video ads allow brands to showcase multiple videos (or images) and a landing page link within a user’s Facebook feed. It has grown in popularity because its unique scrolling feature allows users to see more content before clicking. In fact, Digiday estimated Carousel Ads to be 10x more effective than standard social media ads.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nResolution: 1080×1080 minimum\n\nAspect ratio: 1:1\n\nMax file size: 4GB\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4, MOV or GIF\n\nVideo length: 1 seconds to 240 minutes\n\nFrame rate: 30fps\n\nCharacter limits\n\nPrimary text: 125 characters\n\nHeadline: 32 characters\n\nDescription: 18 characters\n\nLanding Page URL: Required\n\nCollection Video Ads (Mobile)\n\nThe Facebook Collection ads showcase multiple images and a main video above it. This is perfect for displaying multiple products (or various colors of a single product) plus a video. The ad type has been popular so far with retailers and clothing companies as an instant storefront or lookbook.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nResolution: 1080×1080 minimum\n\nAspect ratio: 1:1\n\nMax file size: 4GB\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4, MOV or GIF\n\nVideo length: 1 seconds to 240 minutes\n\nFrame rate: 30fps\n\nCharacter Limits\n\nPrimary text: 125 characters\n\nHeadline max: 40 characters\n\nLanding Page URL: Required\n\nInstant Experience Video Ads\n\nFacebook Instant Experience ads open up a full-screen experience after the first click, which can be further customized with a variety of interactive features. This can include multiple video experiences, including features to auto-play on loop.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nMinimum width: 720 pixels\n\nMax file size: 4GB\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4, MOV\n\nVideo length: Up to 2 minutes\n\nFrame rate: 30fps\n\nSlideshow Video Ad\n\nFacebook’s Slideshow videos were built for advertisers wanting to reach audiences with slower internet connections. Instead of a regular video, slideshows are just that–a slideshow of images or video in an ad display.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nResolution: 1080×1080\n\nAspect ratio: 16:9 or 1:1\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4 or MPV\n\nSlideshow duration length: 15 seconds\n\nFacebook Stories Ads\n\nFacebook added the Stories feature – photo or short video posts that are only available for 24 hours. In addition to user-generated organic posts, Stories ads are available to run between sets of posted Stories. While most users will be sharing immediate and organic updates from their phone’s camera, the guidelines for this format are similar for both paid and organic ad posts.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nResolution: 1080×1080\n\nMinimum width: 500 pixels\n\nAspect ratio: 9:16\n\nMax file size: 4GB\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4, MPV and GIF\n\nVideo length: 1 second to 2 minutes\n\nFrame rate: 30fps\n\nCharacter Limits\n\nPrimary text: 125 characters\n\nHeadline: 40 characters\n\nFor more information on the video specs for Facebook, visit the Facebook Help Center.\n\nInstagram Video Specs\n\nInstagram launched video capabilities in 2013 and quickly saw enough success to start advertising on the platform in 2015. Since then, video only continues to grow as an engaging social format. Needless to say, Instagram videos are absolutely worth the investment.\n\nCarousel Video\n\nSince 2015, Instagram crafted its video formats to allow three different styles: landscape, square and vertical. However, like the app, Instagram and how video is presented has evolve. Gone are the days of IGTV and Instagram Video. Video can be natively included as a post or carousel post, or they can be uploaded as Reels, but more on Reels later.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nResolution: 1080×1080, 1080×1350\n\nAspect ratio: 9:16\n\nMax file size: 4GB (100MB in Sprout)\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4, MOV\n\nVideo length: 3 seconds to 60 minutes\n\nFrame rate: 23-60 fps\n\nInstagram Reels\n\nIntroduced in 2020, Instagram Reels are another option for your video strategy on Instagram. These short-form, easily digestible videos are becoming the preferred type of content in Instagram feeds.\n\nFortunately for social content creators looking to easily generate a lot of content for Instagram, most of the video specs for Instagram Reels are fairly similar to other formats on the platform.\n\nAs Instagram has started to add separate tabs for different content types, thumbnails will be cropped differently on each view. If the viewer is on the first tab that has all content types, the thumbnail will be cropped to the traditional square post size of 1:1–center your subjects and plan to avoid undesirable vertical cropping.\n\nVideo Guidelines:\n\nResolution: 720p minimum\n\nAspect ratio: 0.01:1 to 10:1; 9:16 recommended\n\nMax file size: 4GB max (1GB in Sprout)\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4 or MOV\n\nVideo length: 3 seconds to 15 minutes\n\nRecording in-app is limited to 90 seconds; users can upload videos up to 15 minutes\n\nFrame rate: 23-60 fps\n\nCover Photo Size:\n\nSize: 420p x 654p\n\nAspect ratio: 1:1.55\n\nInstagram Stories\n\nInstagram Stories are short-form videos that display for 24-hours on your profile. Followers and users can access your Stories directly from your profile; followers have the luxury of accessing your Stories directly from their feed, where Stories for accounts they follow display directly at the top of their screen.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nResolution: 1080×1080\n\nMinimum width: 500 pixels\n\nAspect ratio: 9:16\n\nMax file size: 4GB\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4, MOV or GIF\n\nVideo length: 1 second to 90 seconds\n\nFrame rate: 23-60 fps\n\nCharacter Limits\n\nPrimary text: 125 characters\n\nConsider leaving roughly 250 pixels of the top of the video free from text to avoid covering them with the profile icon.\n\nInstagram Video Ad Specs\n\nInstagram’s advertising revenue has significantly increased over the last year. In fact, Instagram reportedly earned $43.2 billion in ad revenue in 2022. The push for Instagram advertising is real and marketers have to be ready to take advantage with engaging videos.\n\nCarousel Video Ad\n\nMuch like Facebook’s Carousel Ads, Instagram offers a similar feature. Carousel ads allow users to see more of a product or feature than a single image or video. With Instagram, your carousel video ads can have 2-10 cards with a full-width call to action below the ad.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nResolution: 1080×1080\n\nAspect ratio: 1:1\n\nMax file size: 4GB (video) 30MB (image)\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4, MOV or GIF\n\nVideo length: 1 second to 2 minutes\n\nNumber of Carousel cards: 2 (minimum) to 10 (maximum)\n\nFrame rate: 23-60 fps\n\nInstagram Stories Ads\n\nIt didn’t take long for Instagram Stories to feature ads within users’ story feeds. Brands can seamlessly integrate their video content between other Instagram users’ Stories.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nResolution: 1080×1080\n\nMinimum width: 500 pixels\n\nAspect ratio: 9:16\n\nMax file size: 4GB\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4, MOV or GIF\n\nVideo length: 1 second to 60 minutes\n\nFrame rate: 23-60 fps\n\nCharacter Limits\n\nPrimary text: 125 characters\n\nConsider leaving roughly 250 pixels of the top of the video free from text to avoid covering them with the profile icon\n\nIf you’re looking for further information including images, check out our complete guide to all the Instagram ad sizes.\n\nFor more information on the video specs for Instagram, visit the Facebook Help Center.\n\nTikTok Video Specs\n\nTikTok has quickly gained attention in the social space. Fortunately, TikTok’s focus on easy to create and share videos means it’s not hard to start producing video content for the platform, and there are plenty of trends to inspire TikTok content creation.\n\nTikTok In-Feed Videos\n\nTikTok videos are all about the ease of creation, editing and sharing, so it makes sense that specs are more or less oriented around typical mobile phone dimensions. One key trait to keep in mind if you’re trying to repurpose video content across platforms is that videos uploaded from another file source, rather than recorded on the app, can be longer than 60 seconds.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nResolution: 1080×1920\n\nAspect ratio: 9:16\n\nMax file size: 72MB (Android users) and 278.6MB (iOS users)\n\n1GB maximum in Sprout\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4 or MOV\n\nVideo length: Up to 3 minutes recorded in-app or 10 minutes when uploaded from another source\n\nFrame rate: 23-60fps\n\nTikTok Feed Ads\n\nTikTok ads are a rapidly evolving opportunity for brands. The in-feed option for paid TikTok content is fairly similar to the formatting for existing organic content. To fine-tune paid content for the best performance, be sure to consult TikTok’s business center for the latest tips.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nResolution: 540×960, 640×640 or 960×540\n\nAspect ratio: 9:16, 1:1 or 16:9\n\nMax file size: Up to 500MB\n\nRecommended video formats: MP4, MOV, MPEG, 3PG or AVI\n\nVideo length: 5 seconds to 60 seconds\n\nBitrate: 516 kbps minimum\n\nFrame rate: 23-60fps\n\nCharacter Limits\n\nAd description: 1-100 Latin alphabet letters and 1-50 Asian characters\n\nTwitter Video Specs\n\nX (formerly Twitter) is a popular space to share and interact with different social media videos. For marketers, it’s all about keeping a user’s attention with enthralling and click-worthy video content. In the sports and entertainment industry, Twitter is often the go-to for sharing video content, so it’s critical to learn the correct Twitter video specs.\n\nTwitter Landscape & Portrait Videos\n\nTwitter provides two formats of in-feed video content to share with your followers: landscape and portrait. These specific formats are only available for uploading video directly to Twitter, rather than sharing YouTube or other links.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nResolution: 1280×720 (landscape), 720×1280 (portrait), 720×720 (square)\n\nAspect ratio: 16:9 (landscape or portrait), 1:1 (square)\n\nMax file size: 512MB*\n\nVideo length: 0.5 seconds to 140 seconds*\n\nFrame rate: 30fps or 60fps\n\n*Twitter Pro Media users can upload files up to 1GB and videos up to 10 minutes.\n\nCharacter Limits\n\nMaximum count: 280 characters.\n\nTwitter Videos Ad Specs\n\nLooking to promote your video through paid ads on Twitter? Luckily, you can use the same exact formats from Twitter organic videos. Stick to the same specs for both organic and paid video to ensure maximum visibility.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nResolution: 1280×720 (landscape), 720×1280 (portrait), 720×720 (square)\n\nAspect ratio: 16:9 (landscape or portrait), 1:1 (square)\n\nMax file size: 512MB\n\nVideo length: 0.5 seconds to 140 seconds\n\nFrame rate: 30fps or 60fps\n\nCharacter Limits\n\nMaximum count: 280 characters.\n\nFor more information on the video specs for Twitter, visit the Twitter Help Center.\n\nYouTube Video Specs\n\nAs the second-largest search engine behind Google, YouTube is an essential network for video content. For marketers, YouTube is a great space to promote, educate and share video content around your brand.\n\nAs YouTube continues to grow as a destination for video content, it hosts everything from short-form promotional videos to full-length movies and TV. This means users are streaming content on all sorts of devices, which could have different levels of zoom or overscan.\n\nWhile there’s no hard and fast rules from the platform on how to approach the video editing concept of “title safe” areas where text like titles and subtitles aren’t cut off, you do want to avoid placing these types of visual elements right at the edges of your video area. Read on for more specifics on each format available on YouTube.\n\nVideo Player (Standard YouTube Video)\n\nWhile YouTube allows users to upload various types of media formats and use plenty of different dimensions, organically, there’s truly only one format for the video player. Organic videos should all follow a 16:9 ratio, but can be uploaded 4:3. However, the smaller ratio will automatically pillarbox the sides to still make it fit in the player.\n\nYouTube has seven recommended dimensions and ratios for standard YouTube videos:\n\nVideo Guidelines for Non-Verified Accounts\n\nResolution:\n\n4320p (8k): 7680×4320\n\n2160p (4K): 3840×2160\n\n1440p (2k): 2560×1440\n\n1080p (HD): 1920×1080\n\n720p (HD): 1280×720\n\n480p (SD): 854×480\n\n360p (SD): 640×360\n\n240p (SD): 426×240\n\nAspect ratio: 16:9 default\n\nMax file size: 5GB max in Sprout\n\nRecommended video formats: MOV, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG4, MP4, MPG, AVI, WMV, MPEGPS, FLV, 3GPP, WebM, DNxHR, ProRes, CineForm, HEVC (h265)\n\nOnly MP4 and MOV files are supported in Sprout\n\nVideo length: Up to 15 minutes\n\nFrame rate: 24, 25 or 30fps\n\nVideo Guidelines for Verified Accounts\n\nResolution:\n\n4320p (8k): 7680×4320\n\n2160p (4K): 3840×2160\n\n1440p (2k): 2560×1440\n\n1080p (HD): 1920×1080\n\n720p (HD): 1280×720\n\n480p (SD): 854×480\n\n360p (SD): 640×360\n\n240p (SD): 426×240\n\nAspect ratio: 16:9 default\n\nMax file size: 256GB or 12 hours, whichever is less (5GB max in Sprout)\n\nRecommended video formats: MOV, MPEG-1, MPEG-2, MPEG4, MP4, MPG, AVI, WMV, MPEGPS, FLV, 3GPP, WebM, DNxHR, ProRes, CineForm, HEVC (h265)\n\nOnly MP4 and MOV files are supported in Sprout\n\nVideo length: Up to 12 hours, dependent on file size\n\nFrame rate: 24, 25 or 30fps\n\nYouTube Shorts\n\nIntroduced late 2020, YouTube Shorts have recently made its debut as another short-form video feature.

According to data from Google, brands advertising on YouTube with Discovery ads see incremental conversions.\n\nSkippable, Non-Skippable, Mid-Roll, Bumper Video, In-Feed Display Ads\n\nWe’ve put these five YouTube video ads specs together because in the end, they all play through the standard YouTube video player. That means all of these ad types follow the same dimensions as the non-ad videos, but only differ in video length. Let’s look at each ad type:\n\nSkippable Video Ad: This YouTube ad type is played before, during or after the content and becomes skippable after 5 seconds. This ad format is the only one allowing advertisers to monetize views from any viewing device.\n\nNon-Skippable Video Ad: This YouTube ad type is played before the content and users must watch the full 15 seconds maximum ad (can also be added during or after video).\n\nMid-roll Video Ad: This YouTube ad type is played mid-view (like TV commercials) and is only available for videos 8 minutes or longer. Ads are added either manually or automatically. Mid-rolls can be skippable, but users must watch 30 seconds or the entire ad (whichever is shorter).\n\nBumper Video Ads: This YouTube ad type is played before the content. This short 6-second max video cannot be skipped and is usually optimized for mobile views.\n\nDisplay Ads: These ads are shown in users’ search queries and sometimes appear in the right video column when watching a video. These ads are static, which means they don’t automatically play. However, once the video is clicked, the type of content displayed can simply follow the standard video player guidelines.\n\nVideo Guidelines\n\nResolution: 1920 x 1080 (horizontal), 1080 x 1920 (vertical), 1080 x 1080 (square)\n\nAspect ratio: 16:9 (horizontal), 9:16 (vertical), 1:1 (square)\n\nMax file size: 256GB\n\nRecommended video formats: MPG\n\nVideo length:\n\nSkippable Video Ad: No maximum, but recommended 15 – 20 seconds for awareness, 2 – 3 minutes for consideration, and 15 – 20 seconds for action.\n\nNon-Skippable Video Ad: 15 or 20 seconds, depending on marketing\n\nMid-roll Video Ad: 30 seconds minimum\n\nBumper Video Ad: 6 seconds maximum\n\nIn-Feed (Display) Video Ad: 15-20 seconds for awareness, 2-3 minutes for consideration\n\nFor more information on the video specs for YouTube, visit the Google Help Center.\n\nLinkedIn Video Specs\n\nWith 66% of consumers finding short-form video the most engaging type of in-feed social content, LinkedIn adopted the use of video on the platform.
