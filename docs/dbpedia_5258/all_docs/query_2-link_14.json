D. Groban reading his 4,080-page poem A Cure for Insomnia[2] over the course of three and a half days, spliced with occasional clips from heavy metal and pornographic videos.[3]\n\nIt was first played in its entirety at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, (Illinois), from January 31 to February 3, 1987, in one continuous showing. It has not been released on DVD or other home video formats and all known copies are considered to be lost.[4]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of longest films by running time\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
