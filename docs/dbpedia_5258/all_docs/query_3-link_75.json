        "text": "Netflix was conceived in 1997 by Reed Hastings (the current CEO) and Marc Randolph. Both had previous ventures in the West Coast tech scene, Hastings was the owner of debugging software firm Pure Atria, while Randolph had co-founded and then sold MicroWarehouse for $700 million.\n\nOriginally a DVD-rental service, in the same vein as Blockbuster, Netflix broke ground with its mail order service. It introduced a subscription model at the turn of the millennium, which allowed subscribers to rent as many DVDs as they wanted, without incurring any additional costs which were the bane of many Blockbuster-fans lives.\n\nEven before the streaming service, Netflix was focused on recommendation algorithms and unique experiences through its website. Even with these advances in technology, Netflix was hit hard in the dot-com bubble and was offered $50 million by Blockbuster in 2001.\n\n- Advertisement -\n\nNetflix rejected the offer and a year later went public on the Nasdaq. It wouldn’t be until 2007 that it rolled out its video streaming service, which separated Netflix from Blockbuster and many of the other DVD-rental services which went out of business in the 2010s.\n\nIt took a few years for the streaming service to make inroads, but once it did Netflix pivoted to a platform only approach, canning the DVD-rental service and launching Netflix worldwide. Today, only citizens in North Korea, Syria, China and Crimea are denied the binge-watching pleasures of the streaming service.\n\nIn 2012, Netflix also upped the ante with its own programming, which started with Lilyhammer but was boosted heavily by House of Cards and Orange is the New Black, two of the company’s most watched TV shows. Netflix started to pick up awards for its TV shows, surpassing HBO in 2018 for the amount of Emmy nominations.\n\nNetflix has also distributed several noteworthy films, including Beasts of No Nation, Marriage Story, Roma and Martin Scorsese’s The Irishman. Netflix earned more nominations at the 2020 Oscars than any other film studio.\n\nBut in terms of awards, the first Emmy Netflix ever won, in 2012, is perhaps the most illustrative: an Emmy Engineering Award, given to individuals or organisations that have profoundly changed the way we watch television. Netflix, it is fair to say, has profoundly done this.\n\nAs Netflix has grown in revenue and subscribers, it has enticed others to copy its formula. Amazon launched its Prime Video subscription service at around the same time and has been a heavy spender, as it looks to compete with Netflix for online eyeballs.\n\nDisney also launched its own streaming service in November 2019, and several American cable services launched their own in 2020, such as HBO Max, Peacock and Paramount. This has put a strain on Netflix’s growth, with 2022 seeing the first declines in subscribers in the North American market.\n\nTo combat this, Netflix launched a cheaper ad-supported tier, to entice users who would not pay for Netflix otherwise. It also considers the ad-supported tier as a way to carve out a new source of revenue, with subscription growth drying up.\n\nThis has performed well for Netflix, which has reported increases in revenue and user growth after the 2022 slump. It is now seen as in the driver’s seat in the streaming wars, as other operators struggle to generate profit from their streaming service.\n\nWe have collected data and statistics on Netflix.
