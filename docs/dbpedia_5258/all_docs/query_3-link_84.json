        "text": "Top 10 Video Object Tracking Algorithms in 2024\n\nObject tracking has become a fundamental part of the computer vision ecosystem. It powers various modern artificial intelligence applications and is behind several revolutionary technologies, such as self-driving cars, surveillance, and action recognition systems. Tracking algorithms use a combination of object detection and object tracking to detect and localize entities within a video frame. These algorithms range from basic machine learning to complex deep learning networks. Each of these has different implementations and use cases. This article will discuss the top 10 most popular video object-tracking algorithms. It will go over video object-tracking algorithms' back-end implementations, advantages, and disadvantages. We will also explore popular computer vision applications for object tracking. What is Video Object Tracking? Video object tracking refers to detecting an object within a video frame and tracking its position throughout the video. The concept of object tracking stems from object detection, a popular computer vision (CV) technique used for identifying and localizing different objects in images. While object detection works on still images (single frames), video object tracking applies this concept to every frame in the video. It analyzes each frame to identify the object in question and draw a bounding box around it. The object is effectively tracked throughout the video by performing this operation on all frames. However, complex machine learning and deep learning algorithms apply additional techniques such as region proposal and trajectory prediction for real-time object inference. Object tracking algorithms have revolutionized several industries. It has enabled businesses to implement analytics and automation in various domains and led to applications like: Autonomous Vehicles: Tracking surrounding elements like pedestrians, roads, curbs. Automated Surveillance: Tracking people or illegal objects like guns and knives. Sports Analytics: Tracking the ball or players to create match strategies. Augmented Reality Applications: Tracking all objects in the visual field to superimpose the virtual elements. Customer Analysis in Retail: Tracking retail store customers to understand movement patterns and optimize shelf placement. Over the years, object tracking algorithms have undergone various improvements in-terms of accuracy and performance. Let’s discuss these in detail. Single-stage Object Detectors Vs. Two-stage Object Detectors Object detection is a crucial part of tracking algorithms. Hence, it is vital to understand them in detail. There are two main categories of object detectors: Single-stage and two-stage. Both these methodologies have proven to provide exceptional results. However, each offers different benefits, with the former having a lower inference time and the latter having better accuracy. Single-stage detectors perform faster since they rely on a single network to produce annotations. These models skip intermediate feature extraction steps, such as region proposal. They use the raw input image to identify objects and generate bounding box coordinates. One example of a single-stage detector is You only look once (YOLO). YOLO can generate annotations with a single pass of the image. Single Stage Vs. Two-Stage Detection Two-stage detectors, such as Fast R-CNN, comprise two networks. The first is a region proposal network (RPN) that analyzes the image and extracts potential regions containing the desired objects. The second network is a CNN-based feature extractor that analyzes the proposed regions. The latter identifies the objects present and outputs their bounding box coordinates. Two-stage object detectors are computationally expensive compared to their single-stage counterparts. However, they produce more accurate results. Object Tracking Approaches Object tracking algorithms work on two granularity levels. These include: Single Object Tracking (SOT) SOT is used to track the location of a single object throughout the video feed. These detection-free algorithms depend on the user to provide a bounding box around the target object on the first frame. The algorithm learns to track the position and movement of the object present within the box. It localizes the object's shape, posture, and trajectory in every subsequent frame. Single object tracking is useful when the focus must be kept on a particular entity. Some examples include tracking suspicious activity in surveillance footage or ball-tracking in sports analytics. Popular SOT algorithms include Particle Filters and Siamese Networks. However, one downside of traditional SOT algorithms is that they are unsuitable for context-aware applications where tracking multiple objects is necessary. Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) MOT works on the same concept as SOT. However, multi-object tracking identifies and tracks multiple objects throughout a video instead of a single object. MOT algorithms use extensive training datasets to understand moving objects. Once trained, they can identify and track multiple objects within each frame. Modern deep-learning MOT algorithms, like DeepSORT, can even detect new objects mid-video and create new tracks for them while keeping existing tracks intact. Multiple-object tracking is useful when various objects must be analyzed simultaneously. For example, in virtual reality (VR) applications, the algorithm must keep track of all objects in the frame to superimpose the virtual elements. However, these algorithms are computationally expensive and require lengthy training time. Phases of Object Tracking Process Visual object tracking is a challenging process comprising several phases. Target Initialization: The first step is to define all the objects of interest using labels and bounding boxes. The annotations, which include the names and locations of all the objects to be tracked, are specified in the first video frame. The algorithm then learns to identify these objects in all the subsequent images or video sequences. Appearance Modelling: An object may undergo visual transformation throughout the video due to varying lighting conditions, motion blur, image noise, or physical augmentations. This phase of the object-tracking process aims to capture these various transformations to improve the model’s robustness. It includes constructing object descriptions and mathematical models to identify objects with different appearances. Motion Estimation: Once the object features are defined, motion estimation predicts the object’s position based on the previous frame data. This is achieved by leveraging linear regression techniques or Particle Filters. Target Positioning: Motion estimation provides an estimate of the object's position. The next step is to pinpoint the exact coordinates within the predicted region. This is accomplished using a greedy search, i.e., checking every possibility or a maximum posterior estimation that looks at the most likely place using visual clues. Criteria for Selecting a Video Object Tracking Algorithm The two primary criteria to evaluate object tracking methods are accuracy and inference time. These help determine the best algorithm for particular use cases. Let’s discuss these criteria in detail. Accuracy Tracking algorithms output two main predictions: object identity (label) and location (bounding box coordinates). The accuracy of these models is determined by evaluating both these predictions and analyzing how well it was able to identify and localize the object. Metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score help evaluate the model's ability to classify the found object. While accuracy provides a generic picture, precision, and recall judge the model based on occurrences of false positives and negatives. Metrics like intersection-over-union (IoU) are used for localization accuracy. IoU calculates how much the predicted bounding box coincides with its ground truth value. A higher value means higher intersection and, hence, higher accuracy. Intersection Over Union (IoU) Inference Time The second judgment criterion is the speed of inference. Inference time determines how quickly the algorithm processes a video frame and predicts the object label and location. It is often measured in frames-per-second (FPS). This refers to the amount of frames the algorithm can process and output every second. A higher FPS value indicates faster inference. Challenges in Object Tracking Object tracking techniques carry various benefits for different industries. However, implementing a robust tracking algorithm is quite challenging. Some key challenges include: Object Variety: The real world comes with countless objects. Training a generic tracking algorithm would require an extensive dataset containing millions of objects. For this reason, object tracking models are generally domain-specific, with even the vastest models trained on only a few thousand objects. Varying Conditions: Besides the object variety, the training data must also cover objects in different conditions. A single object must be captured in different lighting conditions, seasons, times of day, and from different camera angles. Varying Image Quality: Images from different lenses produce varying information in terms of color production, saturation, etc. A robust model must incorporate these variations to cover all real-world scenarios. Computation Costs: Handling large image or video datasets requires considerable expertise and computational power. Developers need access to top-notch GPUs and data-handling tools, which can be expensive. Training deep-learning-based tracking algorithms can also increase operational costs if you use paid platforms that charge based on data units processed. Scalability: Training general-purpose object tracking models requires extensive datasets. The growing data volumes introduce scalability challenges as developers require platforms that can handle increasingly large volumes of data and can increase computation power to train larger complex models. Top Algorithms for Video Object Tracking Here is a list of popular object tracking algorithms, ranging from simple mathematical models to complex deep learning architectures. Kalman Filter Kalman filters estimate an object’s position and predict its motion in subsequent frames. They maintain an internal representation of the object's state, including its position, velocity, and sometimes acceleration. The filters use information from the object’s previous state and a mathematical model analyzing the object’s motion to predict a future state. The model accounts for any uncertainty in the object's motion (noise). It incorporates all the discussed factors and estimates the object’s current state to create a future representation. Advantages It is a mathematical model that does not require any training. It is computationally efficient. Disadvantage Subpar performance and capabilities compared to modern deep learning algorithms. The model works on various assumptions, such as constant object acceleration. The algorithm does not perform well in random motion scenarios. KCF (Kernelized Correlation Filters) KCF is a mathematical model that understands object features and learns to distinguish them from their background. It starts with the user providing a bounding box around the object in the first frame. Once feature understanding is complete, it uses correlation filters based on the kernel trick to construct a high-dimensional relationship between the features and the true object. It uses the correlation features in subsequent frames to scan around the object's last known location. The area with the highest correlation is predicted to contain the object. Advantages Fast Computation. Low Memory Requirement. Competitive Results in general cases. Disadvantages Traditional KCF faces challenges in conditions such as varying object scales or objects touching frame boundaries. DeepSORT The Deep Simple Online Realtime Tracking (DeepSORT) algorithm extends the original SORT algorithm. The original SORT algorithm used Kalman filters to predict object motion and the Hungarian algorithm for frame-by-frame data association. However, this algorithm struggles with occlusions and varying camera angles and can lose object tracking in such complex scenarios. DeepSORT Architecture DeepSORT uses an additional convolutional neural network (CNN) as a feature extractor. These are called appearance features as they learn to determine the object identity (appearance) in different scenarios and allow the algorithm to distinguish between moving objects. DeepSORT combines the information from Filtering and CNN to create a deep association metric for accurate detection. Advantages DeepSort’s simple yet efficient implementation provides real-time performance. The model is modular. It can support any detection network of the user's choice, such as YOLO or SSD. It maintains its detection during occluded environments and can distinguish between different objects in complex scenarios. Disadvantages Offline training of a separate detection network can be challenging and requires an extensive dataset for high accuracy. FairMOT The fair multi-object tracking (FairMOT) algorithm uses a pre-trained model like faster R-CNN for detecting objects in the video sequence. It then uses a neural network to extract features from the detected object. FairMOT Architecture These features are used to track the object across other frames. The branches share the same underlying architecture and receive equal weightage during training. The FairMOT algorithm treats all classes fairly and provides a balanced performance between the two tasks: detection and tracking. Advantages Provides balanced performance between tracking and detection. Improved tracking accuracy due to the re-identification branch (feature extraction branch) Disadvantage Computationally expensive due to the two neural network branches being trained. MDNet The multi-domain network (MDNet) is popular for learning across different domains. It consists of two modules. The first is a CNN architecture shared amongst all the video sequences, i.e., it is domain-independent and learns from the entire dataset. This consists of CNN layers and a few flattened, fully connected layers. MDNet Architecture The second part comprises parallel fully connected (FC) layers, each processing domain-specific information. If the data captures information from 5 domains, the second portion will have 5 FC layers. Each of these layers is independently updated during back-propagation depending on the domain of the target image. Advantages Excellent performance across different domains. The domain-specific branches can be fine-tuned on the fly if significant domain shifts are detected. Disadvantages If data is imbalanced, the model will display uneven performance across the different domains. YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) YOLOv8 is a single stage-detector that ranks among the most popular object tracking algorithms. The YOLO family of models is based on a CNN architecture that learns to predict object labels and positions with a single pass of the image. Yolov8 Tasks Catalog The model v8 follows a similar architecture to its predecessor and consists of various CNN and fully connected layers. It is an anchor-free algorithm, which directly predicts the object’s center rather than an offset from a predefined anchor. Moreover, the algorithm can be used for classification, segmentation, pose estimation, object detection, and tracking. YOLOv8 extends its detection capabilities by providing a range of trackers. Two popular options amongst these are Bot-SORT and ByteTrack. All the trackers are customizable, and users can fine-tune parameters like confidence threshold and tracking area. Advantages The model covers various use cases, including tracking and segmentation. High accuracy and performance. Easy Python Interface. Disadvantages Trouble detecting small objects. YOLOv8 provides various model sizes, each trading performance for accuracy. Here’s all you need to know about the YOLO family of model. Read more about YOLO models for Object Detection Explained [YOLOv8 Updated] Siamese Neural Networks (SNNs) Siamese-based tracking algorithms consist of two parallel branches of neural networks. One is a template branch, which contains the template image (including the object bounding box information) and the next frame where the object is to be found. This branch consists of CNNs and pooling layers and extracts features from both images, such as edges, texture, and shape. A fully convolutional siamese network for object tracking The other is the similarity branch that takes the features from the template and search image. It calculates the similarity between the two images using algorithms like contrastive loss. The output of this network is the likelihood of the object being present at different positions in the image. The Siamese network has had various advancements over the years. The modern architectures include attention mechanisms and RPNs for improved performance. Advantages Multiple advancements, including SiamFC, SiamRPN, etc. Disadvantages Training two parallel networks leads to long training times. GOTURN (Generic Object Tracking Using Regression Networks) Generic Object Tracking Using Regression Networks (GOTURN) is a deep learning based offline learning algorithm. The framework accepts two images, a previous frame and a current frame. The previous frame contains the object at its center, and the image is cropped to 2 times the bounding box size. The current frame is cropped in the same location, but the object is off-center as it has supposedly moved from its position. GOTURN High-level Architecture The internal structure of the model consists of convolutional layers taken from the CaffeNet architecture. Each of the two frames is passed through these layers, and the output is concatenated and processed through a series of fully connected layers. The objective of the network is to learn features from the previous frame and predict the bounding box in the current. Advantages Excellent performance, even on CPU. Disadvantages Troubled in scenarios where only some part of the object is visible. Object tracking is highly affected by imbalanced training data. Want to know more about creating a fair dataset?

With greater computing power and state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning algorithms, AI is approaching a new era where large multimodal models dominate the AI landscape. Reports suggest the multimodal AI market will grow by 35% annually to USD 4.5 billion by 2028 as the demand for analyzing extensive unstructured data increases. These models can comprehend multiple data modalities simultaneously and generate more accurate predictions than their traditional counterparts. In this article, we will discuss what multimodal models are, how they work, the top models in 2024, current challenges, and future trends. What are Multimodal Models? Multimodal models are AI deep-learning models that simultaneously process different modalities, such as text, video, audio, and image, to generate outputs. Multimodal frameworks contain mechanisms to integrate multimodal data collected from multiple sources for more context-specific and comprehensive understanding. In contrast, unimodal models use traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms to process a single data modality simultaneously. For instance, You Only Look Once (YOLO) is a popular object detection model that only understands visual data. Unimodal vs. Multimodal Framework While unimodal models are less complex than multimodal algorithms, multimodal systems offer greater accuracy and enhanced user experience. Due to these benefits, multimodal frameworks are helpful in multiple industrial domains. For instance, manufacturers use autonomous mobile robots that process data from multiple sensors to localize objects. Moreover, healthcare professionals use multimodal models to diagnose diseases using medical images and patient history reports. How Multimodal Models Work? Although multimodal models have varied architectures, most frameworks have a few standard components. A typical architecture includes an encoder, a fusion mechanism, and a decoder. Architecture Encoders Encoders transform raw multimodal data into machine-readable feature vectors or embeddings that models use as input to understand the data’s content. Embeddings Multimodal models often have three types of encoders for each data type - image, text, and audio. Image Encoders: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are a popular choice for an image encoder. CNNs can convert image pixels into feature vectors to help the model understand critical image properties. Text Encoders: Text encoders transform text descriptions into embeddings that models can use for further processing. They often use transformer models like those in Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT) frameworks. Audio Encoders: Audio encoders convert raw audio files into usable feature vectors that capture critical audio patterns, including rhythm, tone, and context. Wav2Vec2 is a popular choice for learning audio representations. Fusion Mechanism Strategies Once the encoders transform multiple modalities into embeddings, the next step is to combine them so the model can understand the broader context reflected in all data types. Developers can use various fusion strategies according to the use case. The list below mentions key fusion strategies. Early Fusion: Combines all modalities before passing them to the model for processing. Intermediate Fusion: Projects each modality onto a latent space and fuses the latent representations for further processing. Late Fusion: Processes all modalities in their raw form and fuses the output for each. Hybrid Fusion: Combines early, intermediate, and late fusion strategies at different model processing phases. Fusion Mechanism Methods While the list above mentions the high-level fusion strategies, developers can use multiple methods within each strategy to fuse the relevant modalities. Attention-based Methods Attention-based methods use the transformer architecture to convert embeddings from multiple modalities into a query-key-value structure. The technique emerged from a seminal paper - Attention is All You Need - published in 2017. Researchers initially employed the method for improving language models, as attention networks allowed these models to have longer context windows. However, developers now use attention-based methods in other domains, including computer vision (CV) and generative AI. Attention networks allow models to understand relationships between embeddings for context-aware processing. Cross-modal attention frameworks fuse different modalities in a multimodal context according to the inter-relationships between each data type. For instance, an attention filter will allow the model to understand which parts of a text prompt relate to an image’s visual embeddings, leading to a more efficient fusion output. Concatenation Concatenation is a straightforward fusion technique that merges multiple embeddings into a single feature representation. For instance, the method will concatenate a textual embedding with a visual feature vector to generate a consolidated multimodal feature. The method helps in intermediate fusion strategies by combining the latent representations for each modality. Dot-Product The dot-product method involves element-wise multiplication of feature vectors from different modalities. It helps capture the interactions and correlations between modalities, assisting models to understand the commonalities among different data types. However, it only helps in cases where the feature vectors do not suffer from high dimensionality. Taking dot-products of high-dimensional vectors may require extensive computational power and result in features that only capture common patterns between modalities, disregarding critical nuances. Decoders The last component is a decoder network that processes the feature vectors from different modalities to produce the required output. Decoders can contain cross-modal attention networks to focus on different parts of input data and produce relevant outputs. For instance, translation models often use cross-attention techniques to understand the meanings of sentences in different languages simultaneously. Recurrent neural network (RNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) frameworks are popular choices for constructing decoders to perform tasks involving sequential, visual, or generative processes. Learn how multimodal models work in our detailed guide on multimodal learning Multimodal Models - Use Cases With recent advancements in multimodal models, AI systems can perform complex tasks involving the simultaneous integration and interpretation of multiple modalities. The capabilities allow users to implement AI in large-scale environments with extensive and diverse data sources requiring robust processing pipelines. The list below mentions a few of these tasks that multimodal models perform efficiently. Visual Question-Answering (VQA): VQA involves a model answering user queries regarding visual content. For instance, a healthcare professional may ask a multimodal model regarding the content of an X-ray scan. By combining visual and textual prompts, multimodal models provide relevant and accurate responses to help users perform VQA. Image-to-Text and Text-to-Image Search: Multimodal models help users build powerful search engines that can type natural language queries to search for particular images. They can also build systems that retrieve relevant documents in response to image-based queries. For instance, a user may give an image as input to prompt the system to search for relevant blogs and articles containing the image. Generative AI: Generative AI models help users with text and image generation tasks that require multimodal capabilities. For instance, multimodal models can help users with image captioning, where they ask the model to generate relevant labels for a particular image. They can also use these models for natural language processing (NLP) use cases that involve generating textual descriptions based on video, image, or audio data. Image Segmentation: Image segmentation involves dividing an image into regions to distinguish between different elements within an image. Segmentation Multimodal models can help users perform segmentation more quickly by segmenting areas automatically based on textual prompts. For instance, users can ask the model to segment and label items in the image’s background.
