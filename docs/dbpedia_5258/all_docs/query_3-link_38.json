A video that clearly explains what your product does is going to help push buyers over the line. And the data backs this upâ91% of people watch explainer videos before purchasing a product online.\n\nSource: Wyzowl, 2024Â\n\nOn average, it costs around $5,400 to create an explainer video\n\nA couple of years ago, Wyzowl asked 122 companies to send them quotes for an explainer video. The lowest quote was $600; the highest was $250,000. And the middle value of all these prices was $5400. So, whilst costs can differ wildly, there will always be options for your brand if you want to hire a professional.Â\n\nHaving said that, itâs getting easier and easier for brands to create their own videos.

Make sure to pull these out if you ever need to make a case for a video marketing budget with your boss. ð¤\n\nShort-form videos offer the highest ROI for marketersÂ\n\nWith a big helping hand from social channels like TikTok, itâs clear that short-form videos can provide your brand with the biggest ROI. Itâs also super-popular with marketers, with 44% producing them on a regular basis.Â\n\nThe likely reason for this? Short-form is easy to produce and platforms like TikTok makes it easier for brands to post authentic, less-polished content that gets lots of engagement. In turn, this builds brand awareness and helps bring in more sales opportunities.\n\nThis is something we explore over on our podcast: Ecommerce Marketing 101.Â Aimee, Head of Social and Creators at Lick, explains how TikTok has become a game-changer for building a loyal following through easy-to-produce video content.Â\n\n{{Lick-podcast=\"/blog-components\"}}\n\nSource: Hubspot, 2024\n\n87% of marketers say video has helped them directly increase sales\n\nThe stat everyone has been waiting for (or at least your boss has). A whopping 87% of marketers can attribute sales back to their video marketing efforts.Â\n\nSource, Wyzowl, 2024\n\n87% of marketers say video has helped them increase leads\n\nThe more leads you have, the more likely you are to see conversions. Itâs just basic maths. But with 90% of marketers saying video has helped them get those leads, it seems video marketing is the road to go down.Â\n\nSource: Wyzowl, 2024\n\nThe biggest blockers for creating videoÂ\n\nIf youâre not creating videos for your brand, weâre sure there are a few things standing in your way. These stats are to show you that youâre not alone. Identifying your blockers will help guide your strategy.Â\n\n33% of marketers donât have enough time to create video content\n\nUnsurprisingly, lack of time is the biggest blocker for a third of marketers who want to build a video marketing strategy. Marketers also say that planning a strategy and creating good content feels like a hurdle they need to overcome. If this rings true, it might be worth considering the ROI potential of video and whether it's worth prioritising your time in 2024.Â\n\nSource, Wyzowl, 2024 and HubSpot, 2023\n\n20% of marketers who donât use video say itâs too expensive.\n\nA large chunk of marketers think that video is too expensive. Yes, video content can be expensive to produce. But it doesnât have to be. A scrappy video that you shoot on your phone and upload to TikTok might get the same - if not more - views than a professionally shot video on your website. Hereâs what Aimee from Lick says:\n\nâJust start by putting stuff out there and seeing the reception you get. I think a lot of people get stuck because they don't know what to post, so they don't end up posting anything. So just start with something. Look at how your target customers are using the platforms, either with other brands, or with creators. Use that as a starting point to create some of your own content. TikTok has less of that âperfectâ feel about it so it's much more accessible for people with little-to-no social media background.\"Â\n\nSource, Wyzowl and Dash, 2024\n\nUsing video in your ecommerce adsÂ\n\nNo doubt youâre already running advertising campaigns for your ecommerce store.

And one way to improve brand awareness is through more video content.Â\n\n90% of video marketers say video has helped them increase brand awareness.\n\nIf brand awareness is high up on your list this year, youâll want to include video content in your strategy. A whopping 90% of marketers said it helped them improve brand awareness last year. And you know what greater awareness means?

This means that, beyond the views, clicks, and shares, these marketers are seeing tangible results in terms of stronger brand presence.Â\n\nSource: Wyzowl, 2024\n\nHow to be successful with your video strategy this yearÂ\n\nWeâve given you a lot of stats, but what does this really mean for your video strategy in 2024? Hereâs a summary of some key themes to look out for as you plan your content:Â\n\nStart with product videos: If youâve not yet dipped your toe into the world of video marketing, start by creating videos that demonstrate how your product can help your target audience. Educating them about your product or service does a good job on helping shoppers make purchase decisions. And will help drive up your ROI.Â\n\nUse a balance of short and long-form videos: Short-form videos are hugely popular, but donât ignore the potential of long-form content. Tailor your approach based on the platform and audience. For instance, use short-form videos for high engagement on social media and consider long-form content like webinars for in-depth product exploration on your website.\n\nExperiment with shoppable videos: Jump on the trend of shoppable videos by incorporating clear, clickable buttons into your video ads that lead directly to product pages. Adding UGC will also help build credibility with your audience.\n\nCreate more UGC: Authentic user-generated content is a fantastic way to highlight real people using your products. Itâs hugely popular with consumersâwith 79% of people saying it affects their buying decisionsâ so consider implementing it into your video marketing strategy.Â\n\nStrategic use of live video: Explore live video such as webinars and event streaming. Consumers say these types of events help them make better purchase decisions and they give you the opportunity to interact with your audience. Take a look at the live features on social channels like Facebook and Instagram as a starting point.Â\n\nMake video production easy: You can overcome some common video marketing blockers by investing in the tools and skills needed to make video creation easier for your brand. High-quality video equipment has become more accessible and it's now easier than ever to shoot videos on your phone and upload them to channels like TikTok. You should also make use of UGC to balance out your video marketing costs.Â\n\nOrganising your video contentÂ\n\nYou can see why video marketing is such a popular strategy for marketers. Whether youâve already created some YouTube videos or youâre planning to launch a TikTok account, youâll need somewhere to store all those videos.Â\n\nYes, weâre talking about Dash. ð\n\nOur digital asset management platform is the home for visual content.
