It exists. It's got a star. It's listed on IMDb

If no one guesses after 25 responses I will reveal

Apparently there is a 6 hour version of 1963's Cleopatra with Elizabeth Taylor that a queen here on DL is clamoring to watch.

While 6 hours of Cleopatra would certainly FEEL like the longest movie ever made, at least while you were watching it, I'm sure there are longer ones than that out there. .

Abel Gance’s Napoleon is five and a half hours long. I’ve seen it several times and it doesn’t seem overly long when I’ve watched it. I wouldn’t be surprised if there were much longer films, though.

I know this isn't the answer, but "Fanny and Alexander" seemed like it when my head felt like it was about to hit the floor.

Alright, alright, alright....

Check it out on IMDb….The Cure for Insomnia, a 1987 experimental film directed by John Henry Timmis and starring Lee Groban, has a running time of 5220 minutes, or 87 hours. The film has no plot and only consists of Lee Groban reading his 4080-page poem called the Cure for Insomnia and spliced with random clips of adult films and heavy metal music. Guess you can pause and masturbate.

Let's watch it together. I'm doing a seminar on the hidden genius of Lee Gorban. Join me
