The youngest of three children in a Cuban-American family, Gina got her start on and off-Broadway, starring in plays and musicals (she sings mezzo-soprano opera and jazz). Like co-star Nathan Fillion, she made her television debut on \"One Life to Live\" and played several different characters there before winning the lead role in the television movie \"MANTIS\". That role marked the start of her relationship with Renaissance Pictures, leading her to her two best-known roles -- the recurring role of Nebula on \"Hercules: The Legendary Journeys\" and the starring role of Hel on \"Cleopatra 2525\" (for which she won a 2001 ALMA Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Syndicated Drama). Gina has had recurring roles on the television series' \"Alias\" and \"Any Day Now\"; she has also made guest appearances on \"NYPD Blue\", \"Angel\", \"Xena\", \"Law & Order\", \"Profiler\", and \"La Femme Nikita\", among others. Gina is married to actor Lawrence Fishburne.\n\nShe is, reportedly, a hell of a good cook.\n\nGina's Official Website\n\nGina Torres on IMDB\n\nCategory Actors"
