        "text": "Suits fans may be in for a real treat in the coming months: Gina Torres is in talks to get her very own spinoff. The currently untitled project would see Torres reprising her role as Jessica Pearson, a no-nonsense New York attorney.\n\nTorres initially exited the legal drama midway through its sixth season, citing a desire to return to her homebase in Los Angeles. And now Universal Cable Productions, which produces the Toronto-based Suits, is looking to reel Torres back into their clutches.\n\nAccording to The Hollywood Reporter, the spinoff is still in the very early stages of development and no deals are currently in place.\n\nAfter her six-season run on Suits, Torres signed a one-year deal to join ABC’s Los Angeles-based The Catch for a recurring role during its second season.\n\nSuits is currently in its sixth season and has earned the title of USA Network’s longest running television show."
