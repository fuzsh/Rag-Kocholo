        "text": "Bloodlines\n\nDamon takes a trip to Georgia, where he surprises an old flame, Bree (guest star Gina Torres - Standoff, Firefly, Alias, 24, Gossip Girl), and enlists her help to figure out how to open the tomb. In the process, Damon comes face to face with someone who is determined to make him pay for past wrongs. Stefan opens up to Grams (recurring guest star Jasmine Guy) in his effort to help Bonnie overcome her fears and accept her powers. While researching his history paper in the public library, Jeremy meets a cute but geeky girl named Anna (recurring guest star Malese Jow - Unfabulous, Hannah Montana) who has her own theories on the folklore of Mystic Falls. When Damon returns from Georgia, Stefan is waiting with news that will change their world.\n\nThe Treasure of Serena Madre\n\nHow about an extra helping of drama this holiday season? It just wouldn't be Thanksgiving on the Upper East Side without it. Blair suspects her mom (recurring guest star MARGARET COLIN) has been keeping a big secret from her, but it turns out to be something else entirely. Vanessa is supposed to spend Thanksgiving with her parents, but has a fight with her mom (recurring guest star GINA TORRES) and shows up on Dan's doorstep. Meanwhile, Rufus learns that Lily has been lying to him about her mother, Cece (recurring guest star CAROLINE LAGERFELT), and Chuck tells Nate that he has some potentially damaging information about one of their friends. Plus, Jenny learns that Eric (recurring guest star CONNOR PAOLO) was behind her very public embarrassment at Cotillion and can't pass up a chance to get even. And Serena is put in a very awkward position when her mother invites Tripp (recurring guest star AARON TVEIT) and Maureen (recurring guest star HOLLEY FAIN) to join them for Thanksgiving dinner.\n\nThe Bone That Blew\n\nWhen a skull and various skeletal remains are found in a tree in a nationally protected wooded preserve, Brennan and Booth are on the case to investigate. Back at the Jeffersonian, Brennan learns of her estranged fatherâs new position as a teacher, a prospect she is less than happy to learn about considering his recent acquittal for murder. In a lucky break, the victimâs bones are identified in a government database as those of an ex-Marine who has been off-the grid for nearly three years. With no records of his whereabouts from the past three years, the team turns to the internet for answers. The investigation eventually leads Brennan and Booth to an ultra-elite private school and a group of rich and powerful families, one of whom the ex-Marine had worked for as a âmanny.â As the investigation continues, the team finds Brennanâs father to be an unlikely asset to the case, but Brennan has mixed feelings about her fatherâs involvement. Brennan and Boothâs investigation delves deep into the world of lies and deception of the ultra privileged families."
