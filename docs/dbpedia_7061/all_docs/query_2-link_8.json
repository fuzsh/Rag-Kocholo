        "text": "The Treasure of Serena Madre\n\nIt wouldnât be Thanksgiving on the Upper East Side if there wasnât a serving or two of some major drama for the holiday. Blair suspects her mom has been keeping a big secret from her, but it turns out to be something else entirely. Vanessa is supposed to spend Thanksgiving with her parents, but has a fight with her mom and shows up on Danâs doorstep. Rufus learns that Lily has been lying to him about her mother, Cece. Chuck tells Nate that he has some potentially damaging information about one of their friends. Jenny learns that Eric was behind her very public embarrassment at Cotillion and canât pass up a chance to get even. Serena is put in a very awkward position when her mother invites Trip and Maureen to join them for Thanksgiving dinner.\n\nThe Bone That Blew\n\nWhen a skull and various skeletal remains are found in a tree in a nationally protected wooded preserve, Brennan and Booth are on the case to investigate. Back at the Jeffersonian, Brennan learns of her estranged father's new position as a teacher, a prospect she is less than happy to learn about considering his recent acquittal for murder. In a lucky break, the victim's bones are identified in a government database as those of an ex-Marine who has been off-the grid for nearly three years. With no records of his whereabouts from the past three years, the team turns to the internet for answers. The investigation eventually leads Brennan and Booth to an ultra-elite private school and a group of rich and powerful families, one of whom the ex-Marine had worked for as a \"manny.\" As the investigation continues, the team finds Brennan's father to be an unlikely asset to the case, but Brennan has mixed feelings about her father's involvement. Brennan and Booth's investigation delves deep into the world of lies and deception of the ultra privileged families."
