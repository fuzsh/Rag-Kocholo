        "text": "The San Antonio Spurs keep saving their best performances for the hometown fans, winning at the SBC Center for the third time in their playoff series with the Seattle SuperSonics.\n\nManu Ginobili returned to the starting lineup and scored a game-high 39 points as the Spurs galloped to a 103-90 victory over the visiting SuperSonics in pivotal Game 5 on Tuesday.\n\n\"I don't know if it was pivotal, but it was important for our team,\" San Antonio head coach Gregg Popovich said.\n\nGinobili shot 10-of-15 from the floor, dished out six assists and pulled down four rebounds.\n\n\"I was very concerned about bringing a lot of juice, energy,\" he noted. \"It didn't matter if it was after six minutes or from the start.\n\n\"I wanted to drive to the basket and make things happen.\"\n\nTim Duncan contributed 20 points and 14 rebounds while Nazr Mohammed had 19 points on 8-of-10 shooting with seven rebounds.\n\nMohammed, who had totalled 19 points in the first three games, tallied nine points alone during a key 17-3 third-quarter run.\n\n\"We came in with an understanding that this is no slouch of a team and we had to be ready to play,\" said Bruce Bowen, who had eight points.\n\nSan Antonio never trailed in Tuesday's contest and, in fact, have surrendered the lead just once in Seattle's three visits to to the SBC Center.\n\nThe SuperSonics briefly held a 4-2 lead in Game 2.\n\n\"We know we can play better,\" SuperSonics head coach Nate McMillan said. \"We know we didn't execute, especially defensively.\"\n\nSan Antonio improved to 5-1 at home in this year's playoffs and leads the best-of-seven NBA Western Conference semifinal 3-2.\n\nGame 6 goes Thursday at KeyArena.\n\nRay Allen led the SuperSonics with 19 points, but failed to record a point in the first quarter and managed just one point in the third, on a free throw with 4.2 seconds left.\n\n\"They came out and did what they were supposed to do,\" he said.\n\nAntonio Daniels had 17 points in a losing cause.\n\nRookie Nick Collison provided 14 points off the bench followed by Luke Ridnour with 12 points Jerome James with 10.\n\n\"There were times we just got outworked,\" McMillan said.\n\nOf note, Rashard Lewis sat out his second straight game for Seattle because of a sprained big toe on his left foot."
