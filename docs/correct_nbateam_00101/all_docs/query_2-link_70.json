        "text": "AUBURN HILLS, Mich. - This was not just another game for Antonio McDyess. He was still stung by the Pistons' loss in the NBA Finals six months ago.\n\nThe reserve forward came through with a season-high 13 rebounds and 10 points in Detroit's 85-70 victory Sunday over San Antonio - a rematch of the title series and a game between the teams with the two best records in the league this season.\n\n\"I was a little more motivated for the win,\" McDyess said after his first double-double of the season. \"It was my first finals. To lose like we did, I'm going to remember it for the rest of my life.\"\n\nMcDyess seemed to take the setback the hardest because he wasn't on the team when it won the title two seasons ago.\n\n\"He was so close and it sort of slipped away,\" teammate Ben Wallace said.\n\nDetroit dominated this gritty defensive struggle. The Pistons held the Spurs to their lowest-scoring first quarter as they missed 13 of their last 14 shots. Both teams shot about 40 percent.\n\n\"You saw both teams as basically who they are - meat-and-potato teams,\" Detroit coach Flip Saunders said. \"Maybe this is why the game wasn't hyped as much. This is what basketball was meant to be like - play defense, play team basketball.\"\n\nThe game featuring the past two champions opened the NBA's annual Christmas doubleheader, lacking the Shaq-Kobe hype of the Heat-Lakers matchup that followed.\n\n\"We're very honored, but we realize it is a great responsibility to play in the JV game,\" San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich joked before the game. \"We have to do a good job to make sure the fans stay around to watch the varsity game.\"\n\nThe Pistons won their seventh straight and improved to an NBA-best 22-3, their best 25-game record in franchise history. The Spurs have lost three of five, but their 21-7 mark is the league's second best.\n\n\"We were playing a lot closer at the end of the season,\" Popovich said. \"They're a little bit ahead of us.\"\n\nDetroit's Chauncey Billups scored 20 points and Ben Wallace had 10 points and 21 rebounds, the most for him since the 2003-04 season. Rasheed Wallace scored 14 points and Richard Hamilton had 11 for the Pistons.\n\n\"We've had different people carry us at different times,\" Saunders said. \"That's what has made this a very good team, and has made us tougher to play against.\"\n\nSan Antonio's Tony Parker scored 19 points and Tim Duncan had 18 points and 11 rebounds.\n\nWhile the game was low scoring, much like the 2005 NBA Finals, the matchups were intriguing.\n\nBruce Bowen hounded Hamilton, holding him to 4-of-15 shooting. Tim Duncan and Rasheed Wallace dueled sensationally near the basket.\n\nThe Pistons have maintained their gutty defense while being more aggressive - and effective - on offense under Saunders. Detroit was coached the previous two years by Larry Brown, now with the New York Knicks.\n\n\"Flip has upped their offense,\" Popovich said. \"He has them really confident in what they're running offensively, but they're also one of the best defensive teams in the game.\"\n\nWith Manu Ginobili missing his eighth straight game with a sprained right foot, Parker and Duncan had little help. Reserve Nazr Mohammed had 10 points. Michael Finley, who replaced Ginobili, had three points on 1-of-7 shooting.\n\n\"We would love to have Manu, but that wouldn't have made much of a difference on the boards,\" Popovich said.\n\nThe Pistons made just 42 percent of their shots, but held the Spurs to 40 percent shooting and outrebounded them 57-30, including 18-6 on the offensive glass.\n\n\"Every time we got within four or five, they would get an offensive rebound,\" Popovich said.\n\nDetroit led by 10 after holding the Spurs to eight points, their fewest first-quarter points in franchise history and a total that matched their low from any quarter.\n\nThe Spurs lost the lead midway through the first quarter, and didn't regain it. Detroit led by four after three quarters and outscored the Spurs 28-17 in the fourth.\n\n\"They just outplayed us, honestly,\" Duncan said. \"They took the game over down the stretch.\"\n\nThe Pistons, playing on Christmas for the third time in four years, hosted a game on the holiday for the first time since 1984, when they played at the Pontiac Silverdome. The Spurs played on the holiday for the first time since 1999.\n\n\"We had a little more energy because we were at home,\" Ben Wallace said. \"It's tough to play away from home on Christmas.\"\n\nThe Spurs led 6-2 before turning cold. Detroit scored the last eight points of the quarter, taking an 18-8 lead. Parker was 4-of-8 in the first quarter, and his teammates were scoreless after missing 12 shots and two free throws. San Antonio stayed in the game with its defense, holding the Pistons to 6-of-18 shooting.\n\nDuncan, the reigning NBA Finals MVP, came alive in the second quarter with eight points on 4-of-5 shooting. But the Pistons got eight points from reserves and led 40-30 at halftime. San Antonio went on a 10-4 run early in the second half and later scored six straight, pulling to 49-46.\n\nThe Pistons led 57-53 after three quarters. McDyess made consecutive baskets early in the fourth to spark an 11-4 run, allowing Detroit to coast to victory.\n\n\"We just tried to show that we're the best team,\" McDyess said."
