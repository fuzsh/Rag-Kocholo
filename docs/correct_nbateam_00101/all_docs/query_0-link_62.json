        "text": "Nazr Mohammed played under both Rick Pitino and Tubby Smith at Kentucky and won a national title under each of them. He followed that up with a quietly-long 18-year NBA career that saw him win another championship ring with the San Antonio Spurs. In 2021, he was inducted into the University of Kentucky Athletic Hall of Fame.\n\nNow it is time for his son, Sir Mohammed, to kick off his own basketball journey and he will be starting off at the University of Notre Dame.\n\nThe 6-foot-6-inch, 200-pound wing announced on Saturday he will become a member of the Fighting Irish. He chose Notre Dame over Villanova, Stanford, Virginia Tech, Stanford, Penn State, and Marquette. He did not hold a scholarship offer from Kentucky.\n\nMohammed is a four-star small forward who On3 ranks as the 71st overall prospect in the class of 2024 and the 25th-best small forward.\n\nAccording to the scouting report from On3’s Jaime Shaw:\n\n“Sir Mohammed has good length with a projectable frame. The most interesting part of the 6-foot-6 forwards game is his passing. Mohammed has excellent court vision, with great tough on his on-target and on-time deliveries. While he is an average athlete, which may create questions on who he guards, he is a smart team defender who understands angles. He has a consistent release on his jump shot, but it has a tendency to flatten out and is inconsistent. He can attack closeouts in straight lines and is a good area rebounder. Mohammed’s dad, Nazr Mohammed, played in the NBA for 18 years.”\n\nNo word on how good he is at last-second runners to beat Vanderbilt.\n\nBest of luck to Sir Mohammad, except, of course, when he plays Kentucky. If and when that happens, all eyes will be on Nazr to see what color shirt he is wearing."
