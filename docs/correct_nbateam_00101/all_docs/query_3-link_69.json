        "text": "SAN ANTONIO — The San Antonio Spurs sure are making things look easy this postseason.\n\nManu Ginobili came off the bench and livened the offense with his usual array of layups and long jumpers, making 9 of 11 shots and scoring 28 points, leading San Antonio past the Seattle SuperSonics 108-91 Tuesday night for a 2-0 lead in their second-round series.\n\nTim Duncan was his usual steady self with 25 points and nine rebounds for San Antonio, and Tony Parker had 22 points and seven assists.\n\nSince a stunning loss at home in the playoff opener against Denver, the Spurs have won six straight by an average margin of 16 points. Considering how they've dominated the Sonics in every aspect — leading for all but 62 seconds — perhaps Seattle's best hope is that overconfidence gets the best of San Antonio. And that's not likely.\n\nThe Spurs certainly remember what happened this time last year, when they led Los Angeles 2-0 after winning the first two games of the second round at home. The series moved to the Pacific Coast and San Antonio didn't win again. In case anyone forgot, coach Gregg Popovich will surely mention it before they fly to Seattle for Games 3 and 4, starting Thursday night.\n\nRay Allen shook off a sprained ankle that knocked him out of the opener and scored 25 points in 42 minutes. Rashard Lewis scored 22. The Sonics even had a stretch of 22 points scored by that duo.\n\nProblem was, the Spurs already had taken control, thanks mostly to Ginobili.\n\nWhen he came in the first time, he quickly made two 3-pointers and two layups, putting San Antonio up 20-8. The lead was 42-24 with 5:19 left in first half. Seattle got back within eight, but the lead was 12 at halftime and at least nine the rest of the game.\n\nAllen missed five of his first seven shots and Lewis started 0-for-6. Lewis later made five straight and Allen scored 12 points in the third quarter, but by then it was too late. In the fourth quarter, Allen took two 3-pointers and missed both.\n\nAbout the only solace for Allen was winning his grudge match with San Antonio defensive whiz Bruce Bowen. Officials apparently heard Allen's off-day cries of Bowen being a dirty player because he was hit with five fouls, which limited him to 17 minutes. Brent Barry also had a ticky-tack foul called on him while guarding Allen.\n\nGinobili showed his teammates how it was done against the sharpshooter, blocking two shots on one possession. It was the kind of energy the Spurs, and their fans, have come to expect from the Argentine.\n\nGinobili's aggressiveness sometimes gets the best of him, as evidenced by his five turnovers. But his jumpers, drives and passing (four assists) helped keep the offense going as the Sonics did a better job clamping down on Parker after he scored 29 points in the opener. Ginobili's only misses were both 3-pointers.\n\nDuncan started strong, making three of San Antonio's first four baskets, then went quiet until scoring seven straight points in the middle of third quarter.\n\nAllen was rolling then, too, hitting two foul shots to get Seattle within 72-63. But a free throw by Ginobili, a pair by Parker, a layup by Robert Horry off a nice pass from Ginobili and two more foul shots by Parker stretched the lead back to 79-65 going into the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Sonics' hope flickered when Antonio Daniels, who scored 16, made a 3-pointer to get them within 91-81 with 3:17 left. San Antonio kept the lead in double digits the rest of the way, with center Nazr Mohammed padding the final score with a 3-pointer just before the buzzer."
