        "text": "After 17 seasons manning the paint for a variety of teams, 38-year-old NBA center Nazr Mohammed is pretty much retired. Mohammed, who won a championship ring 10 years ago with the San Antonio Spurs, is currently a free agent and has yet to sign on with a team for the 2015 -- 16 season.\n\nThe 6-foot-10 center suited up for eight squads (including Charlotte) over his career and must have taken a fancy to the Carolinas. He's just purchased a Southern-style home in Charlotte.\n\nSold for $2,026,000, the 6,330-square-foot home is traditional and modern in design, and it makes a great addition to Mohammed's real estate portfolio (he also owns homes in Lexington and Louisville, KY).\n\nThe updated kitchen features a dark hardwood floor, exposed wood beams, and white cabinetry. The wood paneling in the study pairs nicely with the big window and arched alcove. And, the master bathroom has a marble floor, subway tiles, and plenty of cabinet space. The tub sits simply in a private nook."
