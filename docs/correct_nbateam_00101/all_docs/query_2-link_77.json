        "text": "San Antonio is full of great talent both past and present. I know people laugh at the “boring” style that they play, but they cannot ignore the players who have come into the Spurs organization and left a mark during their journey. Malik Rose was a player for the Spurs who was an important factor early in their championship run. A lot of memories may be vague because it was so long ago, but that is the purpose of his article; to take you all on the journey of Rose’s career.\n\nRose is from the pillars of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, competing in the city long before Kobe Bryant was at the top of the city in High School. Rose played for the same high school as the great Wilt Chamberlain. In his own rights, he was a dominant power forward himself as he landed a scholarship and opportunity to play for Drexel University. Rose was a career 17 point per game scorer at Drexel for four seasons before heading into the 1996 NBA Draft.\n\nAaron B. On Rose’s impact in the Spurs’ Championship Runs\n\nAfter a short tenure in Charlotte, Rose was signed by San Antonio Spurs in free agency in 1997. He instantly became a fan favorite in San Antonio due to his defense and hustle to attack the basket on both sides of the court. That type of energy was what the Spurs needed to make their first championship run in the 1998–1999 season.\n\nIn Rose’s 2nd and last championship run with Spurs in the 2002–2003 season, his role was increased with an average of 24 minutes per game. Rose also averaged career-high numbers with 10.4 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 1.6 assists.\n\nRose’s role was a small ball fearless big man who was asked to defend the likes of Shaq and a young Pau Gasol. He showed a willingness to take the contested shot and got secure rebounds as an undersized player under the basket. Rose was a true definition of a blue-collar player who played on both sides of the court.\n\nCareer after winning in San Antonio\n\nAfter the Spurs’ championship run, Rose spent a couple more seasons with the organization. In February 2005, he was traded to the New York Knicks for veteran center Nazr Mohammed. Rose’s role was minimal for the Knicks during his four seasons with the team. He became a player/coach type who was on the bench to guide young players. It looks as if growing into that role benefitted Rose in the long run. He eventually became an Assistant General Manager for the Detroit Pistons after his career.\n\nAfter four seasons in New York, Rose would find himself traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder for veteran Chris Wilcox in 2009 . He would play 20 games for the franchise before officially stepping away from the game.\n\nConclusion"
