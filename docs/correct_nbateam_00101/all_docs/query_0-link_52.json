        "text": "OKLAHOMA CITY — Kevin Durant had 21 points and 10 rebounds, reserve James Harden scored 20 and the Oklahoma City Thunder became the first NBA team to win three games on consecutive nights this season by beating the San Antonio Spurs 108-96 Sunday.\n\nDurant needed only three more assists to record his first career triple-double but instead sat out the entire fourth quarter with the rest of Oklahoma City’s starters. The Thunder were able to coast to the finish for the second time in their back-to-back-to-back set after outscoring the Spurs 37-21 in the third.\n\nGary Neal scored 18 to lead the Spurs, who played without point guard Tony Parker after he came out of the game and walked to locker room midway through the third quarter.\n\nHe returned to the bench a few minutes later, and a team spokesman said Parker was fine and could have played.\n\nParker left near the beginning of a 25-8 run that put the game away for Oklahoma City.\n\nRussell Westbrook hit a driving layup and then set up Serge Ibaka for a three-point play to start it, and rookie Reggie Jackson’s 3-pointer with 7 seconds left in the third quarter stretched the lead to 91-67.\n\nDurant kept busy by getting up to give pointers to his teammates, and Spurs star Tim Duncan didn’t play in the last period either as the deficit remained in double digits.\n\nNick Collison added 12 points and 10 rebounds and Jackson – taking over Eric Maynor’s role as the backup point guard – had 11 points and four assists. Maynor sustained a season-ending knee injury in the Thunder’s 98-95 win at Houston on Saturday night that allowed them to become the first to win the first two games of a back-to-back-to-back.\n\nAtlanta, Denver, Houston, Sacramento and the Los Angeles Lakers had all failed to win three straight games on consecutive nights this season.\n\nOklahoma City finished it off and even had time to rest the starters, running away after Richard Jefferson’s 3-pointer to start the second half got San Antonio within 54-51.\n\nWestbrook answered with a 3 and his fast-break layup restored the lead to double digits at 65-54 after an 11-3 burst. Parker came out a few minutes later and the Spurs, already without Manu Ginobili because of a broken left hand, never mounted a comeback.\n\nJefferson and Kawhi Leonard each added 13 points, and Leonard also had 10 rebounds for San Antonio.\n\nJackson hit a floater in the lane to start a run of nine straight points by the Thunder reserves as they started to build a lead at the beginning of the second quarter. Harden followed with a two-handed jam on the fast break and a 3-pointer, and Collison’s reverse layup gave Oklahoma City a 33-22 edge with 9:19 left before halftime.\n\nThe Thunder led by as much as 12 three separate times – all after baskets by Collison – before the Spurs started to chip away.\n\nNOTES: San Antonio’s DeJuan Blair and Oklahoma City’s Kendrick Perkins earned double technical fouls during a scuffle in the second quarter. … Danny Green, who scored a career-high 24 points in San Antonio’s 121-117 win at Denver on Saturday, didn’t score until the final 6 minutes with the game out of hand."
