        "text": "Longtime NBA center Nazr Mohammed has officially moved on to the next phase of his career, announcing in a piece for The Players’ Tribune that he has joined the Thunder in a front office capacity. According to Mohammed, he started working for the Thunder last month, having accepted a role as a professional evaluation scout/identification and intelligence.\n\nMohammed’s new title is somewhat inscrutable, which is unsurprising coming from a Thunder team that recently re-hired Rob Hennigan as its “executive vice president of insight and foresight.” However, Mohammed calls the job “a great opportunity to learn all the aspects of the business and become a well-rounded basketball executive,” adding that his goal is to one day become a general manager of an NBA franchise.\n\nAs Mohammed writes in his article for The Players’ Tribune, his relationship with Thunder general manager Sam Presti dates back to the mid-2000s, when Mohammed played in San Antonio and Presti served as the Spurs’ assistant GM. The veteran center later spent the final season of his playing career with the Thunder, so it makes sense that he’d return to the franchise to begin his career as an executive with the team.\n\nMohammed, 40, entered the NBA as a first-round draft pick out of Kentucky in 1998. Over the next 18 years, he appeared in more than 1,000 regular season games and another 88 postseason contests, spending time with the Sixers, Hawks, Knicks, Spurs, Pistons, Bobcats, Thunder, and Bulls."
