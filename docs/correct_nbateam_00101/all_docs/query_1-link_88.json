        "text": "Nazr Mohammed admits it was a “slap in the face” and that it stung a bit when Stephon Marbury and Isiah Thomas said the Knicks didn’t lose much when they traded him last month. But with his new team, he realizes he has a chance to go further than the Knicks ever will this year, and that seems to remove the hard feelings he may have toward his former employers.\n\nIn double-barreled barbs tossed at Mohammed by team president Thomas and Marbury, the trade was downplayed when both were quoted as saying, “It’s not like we traded Patrick Ewing.”\n\n“I hate to say it, but I still read you guys,” Mohammed said. “I didn’t take it as any disrespect just because the truth is, it’s not like I was here a long time. When I first got here, if someone said, ‘You could get two first-round picks for me,’ you guys would have laughed at that.\n\n“It was a slap in the face. I know you’ve got to support your guys. Malik Rose is their guy now, so they have to support him and he [Thomas] made the trade to make the team better.”\n\nMohammed was dealt at the Feb. 24 trading deadline to San Antonio with reserve Jamison Brewer for Malik Rose and conditional first-round draft picks in 2005 and 2006.\n\n“I do love the situation I’m in right now,” Mohammed said. “I have a chance to win a championship. I have a chance to be part of that, so I can’t complain.”\n\nMohammed played in 61 games for the Knicks and started 54 of them, but became expendable at the deadline when Thomas was able to secure a pair of first-round picks for him.\n\nIn seven games with the Spurs, he had been relegated to a reserve role and had not started any games going into his first trip back to the Garden last night.\n\n“I’m going to make the best of it while I’m out there,” Mohammed said of his return to New York.\n\nRose won two titles with the Spurs and made the playoffs in each of his eight seasons in the league. It’s likely that streak of postseason appearances will end this spring with the Knicks falling further and further out of the race with each loss. For Mohammed, the exact opposite seems true.\n\nSince the trade, Mohammed had trouble cracking the Spurs’ rotation while suffering a balky hamstring that limited his effectiveness. But in recent weeks he has healed and has made more of an impact for his new team, averaging 6.6 points in seven appearances, and will see more action now, with Tim Duncan placed on the injured list yesterday due to a high ankle sprain.\n\n“It’s not 100 percent yet, but it’s getting close to it,” Mohammed said of his groin. “I haven’t tweaked it in a while. When I got to San Antonio, Coach [Gregg Popovich] sat me down and said, ‘You’re going to sit and get this thing healthy’ ”\n\nThe Spurs occupied the top seed in the Western Conference before last night’s games and are embroiled in a race with Phoenix for the No. 1 seed. As for the Knicks – whose postseason push is turning out to be a mirage – they trailed No. 8 Philadelphia by four games for the final playoff position in the East.\n\nOn the other side of the trade, Rose has been a refreshing dose of intensity for the Knicks. Though he’s still in a reserve role, as he was with the Spurs, Rose was averaging 3.4 rebounds and 6.4 points with the Knicks going into last night’s game against his former employers."
