        "text": "The 2024 NBA Playoffs have begun, and every player involved is hoping to fulfill a lifetime dream of winning a championship. Several former Kentucky Wildcats players are included in that number, including Jamal Murray, who is looking to repeat with the Denver Nuggets.\n\nThe University of Kentucky has been able to place a number of players into the NBA, especially over the past 15 years. The Playoffs will feature many of them, and there’s a good chance Kentucky fans will get to see a former Wildcat win a championship.\n\nGoing back to 1951, there have been 17 players who won an NBA title and played for the Kentucky Wildcats basketball team. Some won multiple times, with Murray looking to add his name to that list, but it was a great accomplishment for each of them.\n\nHere is a list of every former Kentucky Wildcats player who has won a championship during his NBA career. In parentheses will be the years they were at Kentucky.\n\nPaul Noel (1942 – 1943)\n\nPaul Noel spent just one season with the Wildcats before leaving the team for a family issue. After a few years, he joined the New York Knicks, and then the Rochester Royals. It was with the latter that he won a championship in 1951.\n\nLou Tsioropoulos (1950 – 1954)\n\nForward Lou Tsioropoulos won a championship at Kentucky in 1951, and then was drafted by the Boston Celtics. He only spent three seasons in the NBA, but won a championship in two of them, in 1957 and 1959.\n\nFrank Ramsey (1950 – 1959)\n\nAfter winning a championship with the Wildcats, Frank Ramsey was a first round draft pick of the Boston Celtics. He spent nine seasons with the team, averaging 13 points per game. The Celtics won the championship seven times while Ramsey was with the team.\n\nCliff Hagan (1950 – 1954)\n\nCliff Hagan was drafted by the Celtics after his Kentucky career was over, but was traded to the St Louis Hawks for Bill Russell. Hagan became an All-Star, and the Hawks won the championship in 1958. He averaged nearly 30 points per game in the playoffs that year.\n\nDan Swartz (1951 – 1952)\n\nDan Swartz played just one season in Lexington before transferring to Morehead State. He went on to be drafted by the Celtics and was a member of the 1963 championship team.\n\nPat Riley (1964 – 1967)\n\nPat Riley is one of the most well-known coaches in history, but he was a great player as well. Before he was a five-time NBA champion as a coach, he won the NBA championship as a player with Lakers in 1972. He averaged 7 points per game for them that year.\n\nLarry Steele (1968 – 1971)\n\nLarry Steele was an All-SEC player at Kentucky before being drafted by the Portland Trail Blazers. He averaged eight points, three rebounds, and three assists for his career, and won a championship in 1977.\n\nKevin Grevey (1972 – 1975)\n\nKeven Grevey was a two-time All-American with the Wildcats. The Washington Bullets drafted him in 1975, and he helped lead them to a title in 1978. An injury derailed his career, but he was a solid NBA player.\n\nRick Robey (1974 – 1978)\n\nRick Robey came to Kentucky and helped win a national championship. He was drafted third overall by the Indiana Pacers, but traded to the Celtics. It was with Boston that he won his NBA ring in 1981, averaging nine points per game.\n\nTayshaun Prince (1998 – 2002)\n\nTayshaun Prince was an SEC Player of the Year for Kentucky before the Detroit Pistons drafted him in 2002. In 2004, he averaged 10 points and 5 rebounds per game en route to the NBA championship.\n\nNazr Mohammed (1995 – 1998)\n\nCenter Nazr Mohammed was drafted by the Utah Jazz when he left Kentucky, but he played with a number of NBA teams over a carreer that spanned more than 15 years. It was with the San Antonio Spurs that he won a championship in 2005.\n\nAntoine Walker (1994 – 1996)\n\nAntoine Walker was a part of the famed 1996 Kentucky national championship team. He was drafted by the Celtics. He carved out a nice career with 17 points and 7 rebounds per game, and a championship in 2006.\n\nDerek Anderson (1995 – 1997)\n\nDerek Anderson was also a member of the 1996 Wildcats team. Unfortunately, his NBA career was hampered by injuries. He played for several teams, but he was with the Miami Heat when they won it all in 2006.\n\nRajon Rondo (2004 – 2006)\n\nPoint guard Rajon Rondo was another Wildcat who wound up being drafted by the Boston Celtics. He won his first of two championships with them in 2008. He won another one with the Lakers in 2020.\n\nJodie Meeks (2006 – 2009)\n\nIn Jodie Meeks’ final season in Lexington, he was first-team All-SEC. He was then drafted by the Milwaukee Bucks. He bounced around a bit in the NBA, but was solid for ten years, including his final season, which saw him win a ring in 2019 with the Toronto Raptors.\n\nAnthony Davis (2011 – 2012)\n\nAnthony Davis is one of the all-time great Wildcats, and won a national championship in his lone season at Kentucky. He has also been a great pro, averaging 24 points and 10 rebounds for his career. He won a championship in 2020 with the Lakers, but is looking for more.\n\nJamal Murray (2015 – 2016)\n\nJamal Murray is the most recent former Wildcat to win an NBA championship, having just accomplished the feat last year. He’s averaging 21 points per game in his quest to repeat with the Denver Nuggets."
