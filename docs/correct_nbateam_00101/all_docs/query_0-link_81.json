        "text": "The San Antonio Spurs and the NBA Trade Deadline do not mix â€” two pieces of a misassembled puzzle that only fit when they're forced. That's this franchise's story on one of the League's most chaotic days of the year, with just four deals dating back to 2000. That's how infrequently they make in-season moves, but also, amid a historic run on top of the NBA, led by Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili.\n\nThe past 12 months have proven anything but typical for San Antonio, however, which started with the Kawhi Leonard saga and delved into Parker's departure and Ginobili's retirement. Once Gregg Popovich retires, this situation will complete its startling turn of events.\n\nSo, as this franchise moves from the norm, does that mean more changes lie ahead? Likely not, looking back on how this regime has operated:\n\n2005 Trade Deadline: Spurs acquire Nazr Mohammed from Knicks\n\nPerhaps the largest deal of the three, the Spurs sent two conditional first-round picks and Malik Rose to the New York Knicks for Nazr Mohammed and Jamison Brewer. Mohammed was the Knicks' starting center in 2004-05, but moved to a reserve role on the championship-winning Silver and Black, although he started all 23 of their playoff games on that title run.\n\n2010 Trade Deadline: Spurs send Theo Ratliff to Bobcats\n\nAlmost as minor as a trade deadline deal could get, the Spurs sent Theo Ratliff to the Charlotte Bobcats for a conditional 2016 second-round pick; it was top-55 protected and never conveyed.\n\n2012 Trade Deadline: Spurs acquire Stephen Jackson from Warriors\n\nThe 2011-12 Spurs were a dominant 50-16 in this strike-shortened season, but they moved forward with a roster upgrade. It sent Richard Jefferson, TJ Ford and a conditional 2012 first-round pick to the pre-title-wielding Golden State Warriors for Stephen Jackson, an original player in the Spurs dynasty.\n\nFord was an oft-injured role player, and Jefferson underwhelmed in San Antonio. However, that pick became Festus Ezeli, who participated in a Warriors title run.\n\nJackson struggled in 21 games after the trade, averaging just 8.9 points on 40.5 percent shooting. He spent 2012-13 with the Spurs and competed for a title, but saw another significant drop in stats.\n\n2014 Trade Deadline: Spurs acquire Austin Daye\n\nThe only reason this trade happened, Nando de Colo wanted a change of scenery. San Antonio sent him to the Toronto Raptors for Austin Daye, who played parts of two seasons and stuck around long enough to win the 2014 NBA Finals.\n\nThe Mohammed trade was the only game-changing move for the Spurs at the deadline. Otherwise, their transactions had little significance towards the endgame.\n\nWith a 17-10 record since Dec. 1, the Spurs are playing well enough to not need a roster change, especially with Bryn Forbes and Derrick White playing well. Although congestion in the Western Conference may force their hand, or at least multiple other teams jockeying for playoff position.\n\nThere's little reason to expect a deadline-day deal, but maybe the Spurs will surprise, as they have the past calendar year, to go all-in and support one of Popovich's final seasons helming the bench."
