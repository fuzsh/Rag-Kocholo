        "text": "Thunder reserve center Nazr Mohammed started at center for the San Antonio Spurs when they won the 2005 NBA Championship and played alongside the Big 3 of Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili.\n\nThink you'll have a chance to match up against your old teammate, Tim Duncan?\n\n\"I'm hoping so, and I'm prepared for whatever coach (Scott Brooks) has in store. Defending him, we don't know exactly how it's going to work out. Are we going to go small (with Kevin Durant at the 4 position)? Are we going to play big? I've got to be prepared to one night play two minutes and the next night, I might play 15-20 minutes.\"\n\nDid Duncan find the Fountain of Youth?\n\n\"When we saw him this summer (at a voluntary Thunder camp in Austin, Texas), I said, 'Man, you look great.' You could tell he lost some weight. He was moving pretty good. Pop (Spurs coach Gregg Popovich) does a great job of getting him rest when he can give him his rest. That's huge as you become an older player. (If) you never really get banged up, you can still perform at a high level. I don't think he got real banged up this year.\"\n\nHow enjoyable was it to have Duncan as a teammate?\n\n\"One of the best teammates you can have. He is just a good guy. He just wants to work hard and play basketball. He doesn't want the limelight and that stuff that comes with it. It's almost unbelievable when you've got guys like him, KD (Kevin Durant), guys who just want to play basketball and work hard. I tried to learn what I could from him (Duncan). When all is said and done, I'll be able to say I played with probably one of the top three power forwards to ever play the game.\"\n\nYou and Derek Fisher are the elder statesmen of the Thunder. What kind of impact has Fisher had?\n\n\"He is one of those people who fit this organization. He came in and immediately from Day One, with instant credibility. Instantly, guys listened to him. They know he's been there. He's played with Kobe (Bryant). He's played with Shaq (Shaquille O'Neal). He's played with some of the great players. He's won. He wasn't just a guy on the sideline who won. He's been in the trenches. He's hit big shots. Immediately guys listen to what he says.\"\n\nWhat's it like when he speaks?\n\n\"You should hear in the locker room. Sometimes it's like we're sitting down to have a little sermon. It's like 'The Book of Fisher.' He's great. He just has so many different experiences that he shares with us and he pits things into perspective that guys listen. I've been in this business a long time, and not too many players catch the attention of their teammates and they listen to every word that he says when he speaks. He's right, most of the time.\""
