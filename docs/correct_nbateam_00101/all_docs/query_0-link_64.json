        "text": "Former San Antonio Spurs forward Malik Rose enjoyed a productive NBA career. He was originally drafted by the Charlotte Hornets in the second round of the 1996 NBA draft out of Drexel.\n\nHe signed with the Spurs as a free agent in 1997, and would become an important piece of the Spurs bench on the 1999 and 2003 NBA championship teams.\n\nRose was known for his hustle plays and for being undersized, but effective against the likes of bigger centers and forwards such as Shaquille O’Neal and Rasheed Wallace.\n\nHe was also known for posterizing Dikembe Mutombo in the 2003 NBA Finals.\n\nUltimately, Rose was traded in February of 2005 to the New York Knicks for center Nazr Mohammed.\n\nAlthough Rose left the Spurs, he still kept a home in San Antonio and remains a fan-favorite. His family currently runs a popular Philly Cheesesteak food truck called \"Philly’s Phamous\", as he is from Philadelphia.\n\nThis past Monday, Rose hosted his 3rd annual \"Malik Rose Bowl\" to help raise money for the Salvation Army Emergency Family Shelter. San Antonio celebrities such as boxing legend, Jesse James Leija and Spurs assistant coach, Becky Hammon were among the participants.\n\nRose averaged 6.2 points per game,4.1 rebounds per game, and 0.8 assists per game throughout his career.\n\nHe is currently the assistant General Manager of the Detroit Pistons.\n\nWho would you like to see on the next Spurs Throwback Thursday post?
