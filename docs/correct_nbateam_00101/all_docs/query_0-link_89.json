        "text": "After 17 NBA seasons, University of Kentucky graduate Nazr Mohammed's playing career may be over. Or may not.\n\nThe 37-year-old who has played the last two seasons for the Chicago Bulls openly mulled his future in a blog post Monday, writing that as a free agent, \"I'm currently at a point where I'm trying to decide what I do next.\"\n\nMohammed has options that include signing on to another NBA roster. His body feels fine, and he still enjoys the game. At this point in his career, \"I'm down to about 8-9 teams that I would consider playing for, but sometimes they may or may not need your services.\"\n\nNo matter the decision, Mohammed will stay close to the game. One of his goals, he wrote, is to become an NBA general manager. He also caught \"the broadcast bug\" recently, and that path would allow more time with family and friends.\n\n\"I'm not giving myself a hard deadline,\" Mohammed's blog says. \"But over these next couple weeks I'm trying to really investigate the opportunities and roles that have presented themselves. I've even amped up my workouts to challenge myself to see how much basketball is left in me. I'm going as hard as I ever have to see if it burns me out or keeps feeding a fire to want to keep playing.\n\n\"But you can't keep people waiting, so at some point here I'm going to make a decision.\"\n\nMohammed has played for Philadelphia, Atlanta, New York, San Antonio, Detroit, Charlotte, Oklahoma City and Chicago during his career. He won two NCAA titles at UK, in 1996 and 1998, and an NBA championship in 2005 with the Spurs."
