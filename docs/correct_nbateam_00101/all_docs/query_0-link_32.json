        "text": "Even though the upcoming trade deadline is expected to be less active than ones in recent years, it is still an exciting, nerve-wracking time to be an NBA fan. Even if trades do not necessarily go down in the end, the number of rumors that abound from every source out there seemingly makes for a chaotic, fun experience in which you do not know what to believe anymore.\n\nAs of now, I would be surprised if the Spurs make a last-minute move. Yes, T.J. Ford retired on Monday, and many believe the team does not have a backup point guard; but Gary Neal has played both the one and two spots with confidence this season. The Spurs will not make a reach to get a backup point guard at this point, despite the unfortunately loss of Ford.\n\nIt is a reach, but if the Spurs could somehow convince New Orleans to take on Richard Jefferson's contract, while agreeing to part with Blair and a pick or two in the mix, then it is not impossible to see it happening. Jefferson, while still not living up to the expectations placed upon him, has proven to be a phenomenal three-ball threat, as well as consistently healthy. Okafor has had to battle injury problems for most of his career.\n\nHe might be the scariest looking player in the league. For the intimidation factor alone, as well as the fact that he is seven feet tall and knows his way around the rim, Kaman is definitely an intriguing possibility.\n\nKaman is irrefutably a more polished offensive player when compared to his teammate Okafor. Add in a so-so mid-range game and the ability to get the occasional block or steal, all with a price tag of over $14 million coming off the books, it is not hard to see why many want him.\n\nIt is unlikely the Hornets will deal him unless they can get a team to give them a very good prospect or star who has a year or two left in his tank of prime years ball.\n\nThe only conceivable offer the Spurs could make would be RJ, Blair, and possibly James Anderson or a pick.\n\nKaman would be a great fit next to Duncan, but it is probably not going to happen.\n\nHe is good friends with Tony Parker, he plays multiple positions, takes smart shots, plays good defense thanks to his deceptive wingspan, and it looks like he is on the way out of Charlotte.\n\nDiaw would be the cheapest, most ideal move the Spurs could make should he become available soon.\n\nHe does just about everythingâ€”a little scoring, some rebounding and even flips a few nice dimes.\n\nIf Parker can lead the recruiting effort and convince Diaw to fill possibly a sixth man role off the bench, I do not see why he would turn it down.\n\nHear me out.\n\nIt is rumored that all the T'Wolves want is a first-round draft pick in exchange for Beasley. San Antonio has to be at least a little bit interested, right?\n\nTheir first-round pick probably will not be that good, because they will be a No. 2 or 3 seed out West, meaning taking a gamble on a player of Beasley's talent might make perfect sense.\n\nRichard Jefferson was rumored to be nearly amnestied before this season. Instead of being the cutting, penetrating, athletic threat the Spurs wanted when they traded for him, he is clearly used to hit a corner three once in a while and finish easy fast breaks. Think about it Spurs fans, when was the last time you saw RJ drive and finish strong, not counting fast breaks?\n\nBeasley is a disappointing figure with a dark past, but the Spurs have a history of taking troubled players under their wing and getting them to adapt to their game plan.\n\nBeasley's playing time has been cut drastically, and it is obvious that the T'Wolves would just like to get him off of their hands.\n\nThrow in the equally disgruntled James Anderson somehow into the mix, maybe the T'Wolves bit and the Spurs get some athleticism along the wing.\n\nIt is no secret that the Spurs could use help defensively on the perimeter. Rumor has it that they courted a lot of small forwards in the offseason, including Howard, in hopes of acquiring a role player that would play hard-nosed defense.\n\nIt is being reported that the Spurs have talked to the Jazz about Howard as the trade deadline approaches, with them willing to part with recent fan favorite Danny Green. If the Spurs could somehow hang on to Green and deal James Anderson and a future pick for Howard's services, this could be a crucial move.\n\nCurrently, they are right in the middle of the pack defensively. When the Spurs won titles, they were excellent in every facet defensively.\n\nHoward is a little older and a little slower, but if the price is right and he comes in concentrating on shutting down the opposition's biggest threat, I say go for it."
