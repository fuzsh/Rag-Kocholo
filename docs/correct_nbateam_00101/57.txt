Former University of Connecticut Center Amida Brimah has joined former NBA Champion Nazr Mohammed as players from Ghana on San Antonio Spurs roster following the latter’s call up to Spurs Training Camp recently.

Brimah got the call up after playing for Chicago Bulls in this year’s NBA Summer League and graduating from the Huskies program.

By signing a Training Camp deal, Amida joins Mohammed as players from the West African country to play for the 2014 NBA Champions.

Mohammed, born to a Ghanaian father in the United States, was drafted 29th overall in the 1998 NBA Draft before playing out an 18 year career.

He joined San Antonio in 2006 after a one year stint with New York Knicks before going on to clinch the title with a group that included legendary figures like Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili.

Mohammed participated in the 2015 NBA Africa Game for Team Africa under the Ghana Flag. He last played in 2016 for Oklahoma City Thunder.

Like Brimah, Mohammed won the National College Championship during his time at University of Kentucky; Brimah won with Connecticut in 2014.
