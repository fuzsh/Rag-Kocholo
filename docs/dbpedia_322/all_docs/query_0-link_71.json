Most of these formerly nomadic peoples are now settled. The Nenets, Komi, Mansi, and Khanty are virtually the only inhabitants in the highest parts of the Urals, especially in the north, where they have preserved their traditional ways of life—raising reindeer, hunting, and fishing. The Bashkir are excellent horse breeders. The indigenous peoples, however, now constitute only about one-fifth of the total population of the Urals; the great majority are Russians.\n\nRecent News\n\nAug. 2, 2024, 7:45 AM ET (AP)\n\n3 newly freed Americans are back on US soil after a landmark prisoner exchange with Russia\n\nAug. 2, 2024, 4:45 AM ET (AP)\n\nAt least 4 dead in apartment block collapse following gas explosion in Russia's Ural Mountains\n\nAug. 2, 2024, 12:19 AM ET (AP)\n\nPrisoner Swap Latest: Freed Americans return to US soil and emotional welcome\n\nAug. 1, 2024, 12:01 PM ET (AP)\n\nSTORY REMOVED: US--United States-Russia-Prisoner Swap\n\nJuly 19, 2024, 12:14 PM ET (AP)\n\nRussia convicts US journalist of spying in a trial widely seen as politically motivated\n\nThe Russian population is concentrated primarily in the Central and Southern Urals, and most people live in cities—notably Yekaterinburg (formerly Sverdlovsk), Chelyabinsk, Perm, and Ufa—and work in industries. Those regions developed rapidly during World War II, when many industrial plants were moved from the western Soviet Union to prevent their destruction by the Germans. Agricultural populations predominate in the steppe region of the Southern Urals, where conditions are favourable for wheat, potatoes, and other crops.\n\nEconomy\n\nThe Urals are extremely rich in mineral resources, with variations on the eastern and western slopes according to geologic structure. Ore deposits, for example, notably magnetite, predominate on the eastern slope, where contact (the surface where two different rock types join) deposits are found, as at Mount Blagodat, as well as magmatic deposits (formed from liquid rock), as at Kachkanar. Some of the ore deposits, such as the magnetite ores at Magnitogorsk, are exhausted or nearly depleted. Sedimentary deposits are of less importance. Some ores contain alloying metals—vanadium, a gray-white resistant element, and titanium—as impurities. The largest copper ore deposits are at Gay and Sibay, and nickel ores are found at Ufaley. There are also large deposits of bauxite, chromite, gold, and platinum.\n\nAmong the nonmetallic mineral resources of the eastern slope are asbestos, talc, fireclay, and abrasives. Gems and semiprecious stones have long been known: they include amethyst, topaz, and emerald. Among the western deposits are beds of potassium salts on the upper Kama River and petroleum and natural gas deposits in the Ishimbay and Krasnokamsk areas. Bituminous coal and lignite are mined on both slopes. The largest deposit is the Pechora bituminous coalfield in the north.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nAll About Mountains Quiz\n\nThe vast forests of the Urals are also of great economic importance: not only do they yield valuable wood, but they also regulate the flow of the rivers and shelter many of the valuable fur animals. Agriculture is significant mainly in the eastern steppe region of the Southern Urals. Much of the land there has been plowed for cultivation, and in large areas wheat, buckwheat, millet, potatoes, and vegetables are grown.\n\nBecause of its wealth of mineral resources, the leading industries in the Urals are mining, metallurgy, machine building, and chemicals. Of national importance are the metallurgical plants at Magnitogorsk and Chelyabinsk; chemical plants at Perm, Ufa, and Orenburg; and large-scale engineering at Yekaterinburg.\n\nFollowing World War II the Soviet Union established a plutonium-producing facility in the Southern Urals near what is now Ozersk, Russia. It produced its first plutonium in 1949 and continued production until 1990. During the first decade of its operation, the plant dumped large amounts of radioactive waste into the Techa River and the nearby Lake Karachay. A number of serious accidents at the plant caused the release of additional radioactive material into the environment; for example, in 1957 the explosion of a storage tank resulted in the contamination of 9,000 square miles (23,000 square km) of land. Consequently, the inhabitants of the region have suffered increased rates of cancer and other major health problems.\n\nStudy and exploration\n\nThe existence of the Riphean and Hyperborean mountains at the eastern fringe of Europe in antiquity was regarded as being more mythical than real. Not until the 10th century ce does the first mention of the Urals occur, in Arabic sources. At the end of the 11th century the Russians discovered the northernmost part of the Urals, but they did not complete the discovery of the entire range until the beginning of the 17th century, when the mineral wealth of the Urals was discovered. The first geographic survey of the chain was made in the early 18th century by the Russian historian and geographer Vasily N. Tatishchev, who undertook the survey for Peter I (the Great). Systematic extraction of iron and copper ore also began at that time, and the Urals rapidly became one of the largest industrial regions of Russia.\n\nThe first serious scientific study of the Urals was made in 1770–71. Scholars studying the Urals during the 19th century included several Russian scientists, such as the geologist A.D. Karpinsky, the botanist P.N. Krylov, and the zoologist L.P. Sabaneev, and also such prominent foreign scholars as the German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt and the English geologist Sir Roderick Murchison, who compiled the first geologic map of the Urals in 1841. Much work was done in the Soviet period on geologic structure and associated mineral resources.\n\nYevgeny V. Yastrebov Thomas M. Poulsen"
