        "text": "More than 120 people died of heatstroke in the Tokyo metropolitan area in record-breaking July weather, Japanese authorities said on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to the Tokyo Medical Examiner's Office, many of the 123 people who died were over the age of 60. All but two were found dead indoors, and most were not using air conditioners despite having them installed.\n\nJapanese health authorities and weather forecasters repeatedly advised people to stay indoors, consume ample liquids to avoid dehydration and use air conditioning.\n\nIt was the largest number of heatstroke deaths in Tokyo's 23 metropolitan districts in July since 127 deaths were recorded during a 2018 heatwave, the medical examiner's office said.\n\nOn top of this, more than 37,000 people were treated at hospitals for heatstroke across Japan between 1 and 28 July, according to the Fire and Disaster Management Agency.\n\nThe average temperature in July was 2.16C higher than the average over the past 30 years — making it the hottest July since the Japan Meteorological Agency began keeping records in 1898.\n\nOn Tuesday, heatstroke warnings were in place in much of Tokyo and western Japan.\n\nThe temperature rose to about 34C in downtown Tokyo, where many people carried parasols or handheld fans.\n\n“I feel every year the hot period is getting longer,” said Hidehiro Takano from Kyoto. “I have the aircon on all the time, including while I’m sleeping. I try not to go outside.”\n\nMaxime Picavet, a French tourist, showed a portable fan he bought in Tokyo. “It works very, very well,” he said. “With this temperature, it's a necessity.\"\n\nThe meteorological agency predicted more heat in August, with temperatures of 35 Celsius or higher.\n\n“Please pay attention to temperature forecasts and heatstroke alerts and take adequate precautions to prevent heatstroke,” it said in a statement."
