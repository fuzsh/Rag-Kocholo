        "text": "In this work we consider the regularities of changes of climate and assessed the potential impact of these changes on some of the characteristics of the hydrological regime and biota water bodies of the North of the European territory of Russia from temperate latitudes to the Arctic. Within the annual course, variation of monthly air temperature values is irregular for different seasons, with most intensive warming in January and March. In summer, variations in air temperature are multidirectional. Variations in the thermal regime led, in its turn, to later ice cover formation and earlier ice-breakup resulted in the longer ice-free period. Data analysis revealed variations in the course of precipitation of warm and cold periods. Under distinguished increase of precipitation sums, a total number of days with precipitation was revealed to be equal to or lower than its climatic norm. The total precipitation amount increase occurred due to increasing frequency of rainfalls of 10 mm and ...\n\nIt is shown that over the past 30-40 years, the Volga River basin has experienced a significant increase in its minimum flow in the winter low flow period. Data on water intake from surface and underground sources for 1985-2017 is given for the main tributaries. It is revealed that climatic and anthropogenic factors cause an almost similar effect on the change in the water resource utilization coefficient.\n\nThe present overview is the second part of the article “Runoff of Russian Rivers Under Current and Projected Climate Change: A Review,” which focuses on modern assessment of possible changes in the runoff characteristics of Russian rivers in the XXI century under projected global climate change. The article considers two assessment groups: based on (1) climate models and (2) hydrological models, using data of climate model simulations. The review mainly presents works that have been published over the last 7−8 years, since the release of the previous IPCC Assessment Report and the National Assessment Report of Roshydromet. It is noted that, in recent years, there has been a shift regarding the methodology of assessment of hydrological consequences of projected climate change—from simulations based on climate models to simulations based on regional hydrological models that allow one to simulate characteristics of the water regime of rivers over a historical period more accurately and...\n\nThe article analyses the changes in some meteorological conditions of the arid steppe for the period 1966 – 2020 in Gigant settlement. This station has continuous verified values of meteorological data. In this work data on temperature and precipitation are analysed. The yearly cycle was divided into the warm (IV – IX months) and cold (X – III months) periods. Trends in temperature and precipitation have been identified. There is an increase in temperature by 1.1°C. The amount of precipitation varies slightly. is associated with uneven water consumption throughout the year.\n\nThe regularities of the contemporary distribution of the precipitation regime within the territory of Azerbaijan were researched in the research paper. The perennial tendency of the precipitation regime was determined using the rainfall observation data for the years between 1961 and 2020 in the conducted research. Based on the obtained results, a state-of-the-art precipitation map was compiled for the country. At the same time, the dynamics of the precipitation regime during the period 1961-2020, as opposed to the period 1881-1960, were evaluated. The research period was divided into two half-periods, namely 1961-1990 and 1991-2020, and the internal tendencies were analysed. The results of the investigation indicate that although the amount of the precipitation region underwent a downward trend across the country, the number of stations with a statistically significant decrease is small. Compared to the years 1881-1960, the amount of precipitation has decreased throughout the country. Moreover, the average annual temperature in the country increased by 0,8°C from 1991 to 2020. This indicator is the same period between 1961 and 2020 compared to the period between 1881 and 1960. In order to conduct research, mathematical-statistical and cartographic methods were used."
