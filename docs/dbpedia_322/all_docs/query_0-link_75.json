        "text": "Introduction\n\nIn cold and temperate regions mortality is minimal at about 18°C but rises as temperatures fall. 1 2 3 Much of the increase in mortality seems to be associated with cold stress (personal exposure to cold); time series analyses have shown that mortality increases within 24 hours of a fall in temperature. 4 Deaths from thrombosis, which account for most of the excess mortality associated with cold, are probably caused by haemoconcentration resulting from cold stress (general exposure to cold) 5 6 and an increase in plasma fibrinogen concentrations as a result of an acute response to respiratory infections. 7 8 The increase in mortality that occurs with each fall of 1°C in outdoor temperature is smaller in areas of Europe where houses are warmer and more clothing is worn outdoors at a given outdoor temperature. 9 However, it is unclear whether protection against cooling of the body surface alone can entirely prevent higher mortality in winter. This protection would not be effective if, for example, local cooling of the respiratory tract caused by breathing cold air was an important factor in the deaths.\n\nThis paper reports patterns of winter mortality and various strategies for protection against cold in the Yekaterinburg region of Russia, 850 miles east and slightly north of Moscow. It is a densely populated region, where many people spend substantial time outdoors. The mean winter temperature is -6.8°C, lower than that in any part of western Europe (fig 1 ). Our objective was to evaluate whether the type and amount of outdoor clothing worn and the amount of physical activity prevented excess mortality when winter temperatures were similar to those found in western European regions with milder winters.\n\nSubjects and methods\n\nSubjects and survey of lifestyle\n\nSubjects were selected for interview by a two stage process...."
