        "text": "Quote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Davy-040\n\nHow many people live in Arctic Canada? 150.000?\n\nI always thought the area's where the majority of Finland's population lives have lower average high's than the area's where most Canadians and Russians live.\n\nNope. Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod, Omsk, Kazan, Chelyabinsk and Perm are all colder. St. Petersburg is the same, and Moscow just decimals warmer.\n\nQuebec City, Calgary, Winnipeg and Edmonton are colder as well.\n\nNot to mention Iceland, Kazakhstan and Mongolia, which are vastly colder.\n\nHow cold did you think Finland is? -20C all the time? Summers in Southern Finland are quite comparable with those in Amsterdam (Schiphol average high 18.4C May-Sep, Helsinki Airport 18.6C), and winters are much much warmer than in most parts of Russia and Canada. Turku is the 3rd largest urban area in Finland and we went below -30C the last time in 1987, while all those cities (except St. Pete and Moscow) go below 30 every single winter. This winter we didn't even go below -20C.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Acajack\n\nI think for the larger countries that have significant unpopulated areas we should stick to the parts of the country where most people live in order to determine what that country's climate is generally \"like\". For countries like the U.S. and China though, it's impossible to classify even with this precision. But Canada, Australia, Russia, etc. can be roughly classed I'd say.\n\nIf you mean coldest winters, Russia has the most super-cold cities, with a few sizeable cities in Siberia and east of the Urals. Canada has the likes of Winnipeg, Regina, Quebec City (of major cities). China has Harbin, Jilin.etc. Mongolia has Ulan Bator and Kazakhstan has Astana. Helsinki is positively mild in comparison.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Acajack\n\nI think for the larger countries that have significant unpopulated areas we should stick to the parts of the country where most people live in order to determine what that country's climate is generally \"like\".

For example Finland:\n\n65% of the population lives below the red line, and that is also the warmest area. In my city there's more people than in the whole northern 1/3 area.\n\nQuote:\n\nOriginally Posted by Ariete\n\nYes, we should stick with that.

In my city there's more people than in the whole northern 1/3 area.\n\nAnd if you go up to Oulu it's probably 85-90% of the population that is covered, and Oulu's winter winter temperatures are about the same as where I live and milder than places like Quebec City or Winnipeg.\n\nThough Oulu is quite a bit cooler in the summer than any major city in Canada."
