It is located in western Russia. It is a large city, a hive of activity through which large industrial and military equipment is transported between east and west Russia.\n\nEvents[]\n\nDespite the city's size, there is only connection out of Ekaterinburg; the famous Trans-Siberian Express. Passepartout tries to find an alternate method of travel whilst exploring the docks, the military airfield and a local coffee house, but all of his attempts prove fruitless.\n\nExploring the streets at night in an earlier city (certainly Moscow, but perhaps others) can provide notice of a freight train route from Ekaterinburg to Astrakhan (which is back west, and also runs in the other direction, at least when possessing the train timetable).\n\nIf the player visited Eija in Helsinki, Passepartout can receive Bear-Hunting Armour from her grandfather The Finn and knowledge of a route by military transport to Krasnovodsk and ultimately to Colombo where it is to be sold.\n\nArrivals[]\n\nMount Elbrus Transport Type Price Days Cases Hearts Conditions Underground Phaeton Other Free <1 10 0 None\n\nDepartures[]\n\nOmsk - Irkutsk - Karimskaya - Ussuriysk Transport Type Price Days Cases Hearts Conditions Trans-Siberian Express Train ££-££££ 2-9 2 56 Siberian Weather\n\nAstrakhan (foreknowledge required)\n\nKrasnovodsk (Helsinki sidequest)\n\nMarket[]\n\nItems that can be bought at the Ekaterinburg market (Torgovaya Square) include;\n\nTrading Items Item Price Seed # Western Star £140, £150 1, 4 Diamond Chronometer £320 6 Set of False Teeth £62 6 Stopwatch £10 1 Travel Items Item Price Seed # Wool Shirts ? 1 Fur Coat £150, £150 1, 4 Knitted Gloves £18 6 Fur-lined Boots £14 1,3,8 Railway Whistle £0/170d 4, 7 Neck Cushion £7/100d 4 Monkey Wrench £7/100d 3 Railway Cap £9 8 Tartan Blanket £24 8 Top Hat £58 7 Conversation Items Item Price Seed # Timetables Item Price Seed # Indian Train Timetable £2/200d 4\n\nTrivia[]"
