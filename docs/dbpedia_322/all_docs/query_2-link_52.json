        "text": "As the world’s population continues to increase, ensuring food security becomes a major problem. This often leads to the expansion of agricultural production, even in harsh conditions and becomes a key problem for many countries, including Russia. However, such expansion may entail certain costs, including the potential loss of insect populations, which are vital for ecological balance and agricultural productivity. The development of fallow lands in these regions is necessary to increase food production and increase food security; it is important to balance this with protection from harmful insects and sustainable farming methods. Research into the effects of insecticides on insects is an ongoing challenge, and new, sustainable farming methods are needed to ensure that protection from harmful insects and sustainable development can coexist. This article discusses the use of pesticides to protect the well-being of mankind, the problems of studying the effects of pesticides on insects and the vulnerability of insects to pesticides in regions with harsh conditions. It also discusses successful methods of sustainable agriculture and the importance of the legal framework governing the use of pesticides. The article emphasises the importance of balanced development with insect protection to ensure the sustainability of agricultural expansion in harsh conditions.\n\nThe modern distribution of the Western Eurasian subboreal butterfly Coenonympha leander (Esper, 1784) was studied in the Urals region, with its northeastern range limits specified at 56°N and 65°E. There are isolated local C. leander populations in the forest-steppe, while in the steppe zone the species is distributed fairly uniformly. In the Ural steppes the species is tolerant to moderate anthropogenic transformation of natural communities; the species is not rare and cannot serve as an indicator of intact communities, as opposed to other parts of its range. The geographic variations in the wing length and also the diameters and frequency of eyespots in the wing pattern are analyzed. The highest morphological specificity was detected in the marginal outpost populations, especially the northernmost population of Nizhnee Tukbaevo in Bashkortostan, which lives under the unique conditions of the azonal Mesyagutovo forest-steppe and tends to form a cline, with the wing size decreasing and the eyespot diameters and frequency increasing from north to south."
