(http://sgaf.ru/)\n\nChurches:\n\nCathedral on the Blood (Church of All Saints) and the Church of Ascension are the best known Russian Orthodox churches in Yekaterinburg.\n\nYekaterinburg is one of the 11 Russian cities that will host the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The city will host 4 matches of the World Cup. Yekaterinburg's Central Stadium is the venue where Egypt meets Uruguay, France will play Peru, Japan against Senegal, and Mexico vs Sweden.\n\nThe Map shows a city map of Yekaterinburg with expressways, main roads and streets, and the location of Yekaterinburg International Airport known as Koltsovo Airport ((Russian: Аэропорт Кольцово), IATA code: SVX), located 19 km (12 mi, 30 min) by road, southeast of the city.\n\nTo find a location use the form below.
