        "text": "Crossing the Eurasian climate boundary line, the Ural Mountains have come to Yekaterinburg, where the weather is changing. Yekaterinburg is a city with stories. His origins can be traced back to the 11th century. Even today, if it is calculated according to economic output, Russia ranks third, second only to Moscow and St. Petersburg. Yeka can finally see high-rise buildings. In Russia, where the country is huge, it seems that it does not cherish its own land. High-rise buildings do not exist in ordinary cities. Here you can find authentic Chinese restaurants, even the so-called entertainment venues. The various clubs in Russia are also available. The Hyatt Hotel where we stayed can even see the weather of the Church of the Blood Yeka directly from our room. Its really annoying, and the sun is raining for a while."
