        "text": "This mall is amazing! From a full size grocery store on the sub-level to a movie theater, and it's still adding stores. The main emphasis is women's wear by far from high-end (with high prices) down to discounted but very nice fashions. My delight was there is a Starbucks, and it was a 3-minute walk from our hotel (Renomme). The only downside is that you can get lost (turned around) easily though \"information\" stands are available. The Grinvich doesn't open until 10a.m. and unlike U.S. malls don't plan to venture far down the line of shops because they are closed off with security personnel restricting access to all but employees. There is added security outside and immediately inside all entrances. Another real treat was the Twix ice cream at Burger King...which isn't available in the U.S. (at least in Idaho because we asked upon return).\n\nThis mall is very large and complex. The layout isn't typical which can make it time consuming to see every store. It has 3 floors and probably anything you are looking for. Even a large supermarket!"
