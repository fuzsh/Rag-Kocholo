        "text": "Ural State Forest Engineering University is one of the leading educational institutions in the Russian Forestry education. Ural State Forest Engineering University located in Ekaterinburg which is a industrial, scientific and cultural center of the Urals Federal District. Ural State Forest Engineering University was founded in 1930 on the basis of Forestry Faculty of the Ural Polytechnic Institute. Throughout its history the Ural State Forest Engineering University has trained more than 55,000 professionals. Today Ural State Forest Engineering University prepares bachelors, masters and specialists in a wide range of technical, economic and humanitarian areas for businesses, organizations and institutions for the sector of the economy, environmental protection and rational use of natural resources. Currently Ural State Forest Engineering University has 11 faculties, 49 departments and staff of 835 skilled professionals.\n\nFaculties of Ural State Forest Engineering University:\n\nForest and Environmental Sciences\n\nForestry and Road Construction Business\n\nRoad Transport and Technological Systems\n\nChemical processing of vegetable, raw materials and industrial ecology\n\nEcotoxicology\n\nEconomics and Management\n\nTourism and Service\n\nSecondary Vocational Education\n\nVocational Education\n\nPreparatory\n\nCorrespondence\n\nStudent Accommodation\n\nDorms consist of eight rooms per floor, with 2-3 people per room. Each floor also has one kitchen and two toilets, and the basement has a shower. Students cannot select their own rooms. We encourage students to apply early, as the number of rooms are limited. Some students may not be comfortable with dorm rules, as they are often considered strict.\n\nAll Dormitories have the following facilities:\n\nKitchen\n\nLaundry room\n\nMedical aid cabinet\n\nGym\n\nReading room\n\nFree Internet connection\n\nYekaterinburg City\n\nYekaterinburg or Ekaterinburg (Sverdlovsk in 1924-1991) is the fourth most populous city in Russia (after Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Novosibirsk), the administrative center of the Ural Federal District and Sverdlovsk Oblast.\n\nYekaterinburg – Features\n\nYekaterinburg is located in the floodplain of the Iset River on the eastern slope of the Middle Urals in Asia, near its border with Europe, about 1,800 km east of Moscow. Since the Ural Mountains are very old, there are no significant hills in the city.\n\nThis relief was a favorable condition for the construction of the main transport routes from Central Russia to Siberia (the Siberian Route and the Trans-Siberian Railway) through Yekaterinburg. As a result, it has become one of the most strategically important centers of Russia, which still provides a link between the European and Asian parts of the country.\n\nYekaterinburg is located in the border zone of temperate continental and continental climates. It is characterized by a sharp variability in weather conditions with well-defined seasons. The Ural Mountains, despite their low height, block the way to the masses of air coming from the west from the European part of Russia.\n\nAs a result, the Middle Urals is open to the invasion of cold Arctic air and continental air of the West Siberian Plain. At the same time, warm air masses of the Caspian Sea and the deserts of Central Asia can freely enter this territory from the south.\n\nThat is why the city is characterized by sharp temperature fluctuations and the formation of weather anomalies: in winter from severe frosts to thaws and rains, in summer from heat above plus 35 degrees Celsius to frosts. The average temperature in January is minus 12.6 degrees Celsius, in July – plus 19 degrees Celsius.\n\nThe city has a rather unfavorable environmental situation due to air pollution. In 2016, Yekaterinburg was included in the list of Russian cities with the worst environmental situation by this indicator. Car emissions account for more than 90% of all pollution.\n\nYekaterinburg ranks third in Russia (after Moscow and St. Petersburg) in the number of diplomatic missions, while their consular districts extend far beyond Sverdlovsk Oblast, and serve other regions of the Urals, Siberia, and the Volga region.\n\nIn terms of economy, Yekaterinburg also ranks third in the country. It is one of the largest financial and business centers of Russia. The main branches of production: metallurgical production and metalworking, food production, production of electrical equipment, electronic and optical equipment, production of vehicles, production of machinery and equipment, chemical production.\n\nAlmost all types of urban public transport are presented in Yekaterinburg: buses, trolleybuses, trams, subways, taxis. Yekaterinburg is the third largest transportation hub in Russia: 6 federal highways, 7 main railway lines, as well as Koltsovo International Airport, one of the country’s largest airports. The location of Yekaterinburg in the central part of the region allows you to get from it to any major city of the Urals in 7-10 hours.\n\nYekaterinburg has an extensive scientific and technical potential, it is one of the largest scientific centers in Russia. The Presidium and about 20 institutes of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, 66 research institutes, and about 30 universities are located here.\n\nThis city is a relatively large tourist center. A significant part of tourists visit it to honor the memory of the last Russian emperor and his family killed by the Bolsheviks in the basement of the Ipatiev House in 1918.\n\nThere are about 50 different museums in Yekaterinburg. One of the world’s largest collections of constructivist architectural monuments has been preserved here. In total, there are over 600 historical and cultural monuments in the city, of which 43 are objects of federal significance. The City Day of Yekaterinburg is celebrated on the third Saturday of August."
