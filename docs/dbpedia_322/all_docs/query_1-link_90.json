        "text": "Physiography\n\nThe Urals divide into five sections. The northernmost Polar Urals extend some 240 miles (400 km) from Mount Konstantinov Kamen in the northeast to the Khulga River in the southeast; most mountains rise to 3,300–3,600 feet (1,000–1,100 metres) above sea level, although the highest peak, Mount Payer, reaches 4,829 feet (1,472 metres). The next stretch, the Nether-Polar Urals, extends for more than 140 miles (225 km) south to the Shchugor River. This section contains the highest peaks of the entire range, including Mount Narodnaya (6,217 feet [1,895 metres]) and Mount Karpinsk (6,161 feet [1,878 metres]). These first two sections are typically Alpine and are strewn with glaciers and heavily marked by permafrost.\n\nFarther south come the Northern Urals, which stretch for more than 340 miles (550 km) to thein the south; most mountains top 3,300 feet (1,000 metres), and the highest peak, Mount Telpos-Iz, rises to 5,305 feet (1,617 metres). Many of the summits are flattened, the remnants of ancient peneplains (eroded surfaces of large area and slight relief) uplifted by geologically recent tectonic movements. In the north, intensive weathering has resulted in vast “seas of stone” on mountain slopes and summits. The lower Central Urals, extending more than 200 miles (320 km) to the Ufa River, rarely exceed 1,600 feet (500 metres), though the highest peak, Mount Sredny Baseg, rises to 3,261 feet (994 metres). The summits are smooth, with isolated residual outcrops. The last portion, the Southern Urals, extends some 340 miles (550 km) to the westward bend of the Ural River and consists of several parallel ridges rising to 3,900 feet (1,200 metres) and culminating in Mount Yamantau, 5,380 feet (1,640 metres); the section terminates in the wide uplands (less than 2,000 feet [600 metres]) of the Mughalzhar Hills.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nAll About Mountains Quiz\n\nThe rock composition helps shape the topography: the high ranges and low, broad-topped ridges consist of quartzites, schists, and gabbro, all weather-resistant. Buttes are frequent, and there are north–south troughs of limestone, nearly all containing river valleys. Karst topography is highly developed on the western slopes of the Urals, with many caves, basins, and underground streams. The eastern slopes, on the other hand, have fewer karst formations; instead, rocky outliers rise above the flattened surfaces. Broad foothills, reduced to peneplain, adjoin the Central and Southern Urals on the east.\n\nGeology\n\nThe Urals date from the structural upheavals of the Hercynian orogeny (about 250 million years ago). About 280 million years ago there arose a high mountainous region, which was eroded to a peneplain. Alpine folding resulted in new mountains, the most marked upheaval being that of the Nether-Polar Urals. In the watershed region lies the Ural-Tau Anticlinorium (a rock formation of arches and troughs, itself forming an arch), the largest in the Urals, and in the Southern Urals, west of it, is the Bashkir Anticlinorium. Both are composed of layers (sometimes four miles thick) of ancient metamorphic (heat-altered) rocks—gneisses (metamorphic rocks separable into thin plates), quartzites, and schists—that are between 570 and 395 million years old.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

In many places it descends in terraces to the Cis-Ural depression (west of the Urals), to which much of the eroded matter was carried during the late Paleozoic (about 300 million years ago). Found there are widespread karst (a starkly eroded limestone region) and gypsum, with large caverns and subterranean streams. On the eastern slope, volcanic layers alternate with sedimentary strata, all dating from middle Paleozoic times. These rocks compose the Tagil-Magnitogorsk Synclinorium (a group of rock arches and troughs, itself forming a trough), the largest in the Urals. In the Central and Southern Urals the eastern slope blends into broad peneplained foothills, where there are frequent outcrops of granite and often fantastically shaped buttes. To the north the peneplain is buried under the loose, easily pulverized deposits of the West Siberian Plain.\n\nDrainage\n\nThe rivers flowing down from the Urals drain into either the Arctic Ocean or the Caspian Sea. The Pechora River, which drains the western slope of the Polar, Nether-Polar, and part of the Northern Urals, empties into the Barents Sea. Its largest tributaries are the Ilych, Shchugor, and Usa. Almost all the rivers of the eastern slope belong to the Ob River system, emptying into the Kara Sea. The largest are the Tobol, the Iset, the Tura, the Tavda, the Severnaya (Northern) Sosva, and the Lyapin. The Kama (a tributary of the Volga) and the Ural rivers belong to the drainage basin of the Caspian Sea. The Kama collects water from a large area of the western slope: the Vishera, Chusovaya, and Belaya all empty into it. The Ural River, with its tributary the Sakmara, flows along the Southern Urals.\n\nThe location and character of the Urals’ rivers and lakes are closely connected with the topography and climate. In their upper reaches many rivers flow slowly through the mountains in wide, longitudinal troughs. Later they change to a latitudinal direction, cut through the ridges in narrow valleys, and descend to the plains, particularly in the Northern and Southern Urals. The main watershed does not correspond with the highest ridges everywhere. The Chusovaya and Ufa rivers of the Central and Southern Urals, which later join the Volga drainage basin, have their sources on the eastern slope.\n\nThe rivers on the western slope carry more water than those of the east, particularly in the Northern and Nether-Polar Urals; the slowest rate of flow is on the eastern slope of the Southern Urals, reflecting intense evaporation as well as low precipitation. In winter the rivers freeze for five months in the south and for seven months in the north.\n\nThere are many lakes, especially on the eastern slope of the Southern and Central Urals. The largest are Uvildy, Itkul, Turgoyak, and Tavatuy. On the western slope are many small karst lakes. In the Polar Urals, lakes occur in glacial valleys, the deepest of them being Lake Bolshoye Shchuchye, at 446 feet (136 metres) deep. Medicinal muds are common in a number of the lakes, such as Moltayevo, and spas and sanatoriums have been established."
