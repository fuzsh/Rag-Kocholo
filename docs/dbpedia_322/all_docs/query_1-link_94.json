        "text": "The 2018 Fifa World Cup is just days away, with each of the 32 teams about to converge in Russia.\n\nHowever, while the players prepare to compete for World Cup glory, there is one element that remains completely out of their control: the weather.\n\nHeld in 11 host cities across Russia, there are 1,550 miles between the two furthest destinations - Kaliningrad in the west and Yekaterinburg in the east – meaning there could be great diversity of weather happening across the event.\n\nAnd, while this time of year tends to be warm and on the drier side, rain, thunderstorms and sometimes even tornadoes can occur.\n\n“Much like across the United States, there is the occasional frontal passage to bring cooling as well as some rain and thunderstorms on occasion,” AccuWeather's Senior Meteorologist Jason Nicholls said.\n\n“Strong to severe thunderstorms with downpours, hail and strong winds are not uncommon.”\n\nSo, what kinds of temperatures can players and football fans expect?\n\nSet to be the warmest of all the host cities, Volgograd has an average June high of 26.6C and an average July high of 29.3C. Monthly rainfall is about 41mm in June and about 35mm in July.\n\nOn average, Rostov-on-don sees highs of 26.6C in June and an average July high of 29.2C. Monthly rainfall is greater here with 70mm in June and 53mm in July.\n\nFootball fans visiting Sochi can expect warm temperatures with an average June high of 24.6C and an average July high of 27.4C. However, they should also prepare for showers as it has the highest monthly rainfall with 104mm in June and 128mm in July.\n\nSamara has an average June high of 25.3C and an average July high of 26.9C. Monthly rainfall is about 56mm in June and about 57mm in July.\n\nKazan looks set to stay fine too with an average June high of 23.6C and an July high of 25.5C. On average the monthly rainfall in June reaches 63mm and 67mm in July.\n\nNizhny Novgorod has an average June high of 22.6C and an average July high of 24.7C, however it has previously seen record temperatures of 38.2. Monthly rainfall is slightly higher here at about 76mm in June and about 73mm in July.\n\nEkaterinburg has an average June high of 23C and an average July high of 24.4C. Monthly rainfall is about 75mm in June and can reach up to 90mm in July.\n\nMoscow, which see World Cup matches play out at the Spartak Stadium and Luzhniki Stadium, has an average June high of 22C and an average July high of 24.3C. Monthly rainfall is about 80mm in June and 85mm in July.\n\nWhile still warm, Saransk is one of the cooler destinations with an average June high of 22.3C and 23.9C in July. Average monthly rainfall is 59mm in June and can reach up to 74mm in July.\n\nSaint Petersburg promises to stay warm with an average June high of 20C and an July high of 23C. However, there is a chance of rain with an average monthly rainfall of 71mm in June and 67mm in July.\n\nTemperatures are similar in Kaliningrad too with an average high of 20.5C in June and 23C in July. Monthly rainfall is slightly higher here though with about 79mm in June and 77mm in July."
