        "text": "The counter culture of the 1960s can be proclaimed as a paradigm shift in American culture. The Westward Movement of the late eighteenth century and nineteenth century was the Americans moving towards the Westside of America due to the Homestead Act, California Gold Rush, and the idea of the 'Wild West' adventure. But in the Postmodern time, it is prevalent the Westward dream roars louder among people from other Countries and the 'Wild West' now represents the American hyperreal culture. This paper attempts to read the selected songs from popular culture 'Go West' by Village People 1979, which was later remastered by Pet Shop Boys 1993 and 'Californication' by Red Hot Chili Peppers 1999 examining the themes of the songs in the Postmodern context of cultural consumerism and hyperreality. The songs are deemed to have significance in narrating the California Dream and its culture behind as well as how popular culture represented the dream.\n\nBurning Man (BM) is a festival of art and music that materialises for one week each year in the Nevada desert. It is considered by many to be the world’s largest countercultural event. But what is BM, really? With record attendance of 69,613 in 2013 (Griffith) (the original event in 1986 had twenty), and recent event themes that have engaged with mainstream political themes such as “Green Man” (2007) and “American Dream” (2008), can BM still be considered countercultural? Was it ever? In the first part of this article, we define counterculture as a subculture that originates in the hippie movement of 1960s America and the rejection of “mainstream” values associated with post-WWII industrial culture, that aligns itself with environmentalism and ecological consciousness, and that is distinctly anti-consumer (Roszak, Making). Second, we identify BM as an art and music festival that transcends the event to travel with its desert denizens out into the “real world.” In this way, it is also a festival that has countercultural connections. Third, though BM bears some resemblance to counterculture, given that it is founded upon “Radical Self-Reliance”, BM is actually anything but countercultural because it interlocks with the current socioeconomic zeitgeist of neoliberalism, and that reflects a “new individualism” (Elliot & Lemert). BM’s ambition to be a commercial-free zone runs aground against its entanglement with market relations, and BM is also arguably a consumer space. Finally, neoliberal ideology and “new individualism” are encoded in the space of BM at the level of the spectacle (Debord). The Uchronian’s structure from BM 2006 (a cavernous wooden construction nicknamed the “Belgian Waffle”) could be read as one example. However, opportunities for personal transformation and transcendent experience may persist as counterculture moves into a global age.\n\nI created the installation Atlas of Dreams, a series of artistic maps and audio recordings, to portray the emotional traces left by 145 dreamers when they narrated their memorable dreams in the cities of the Bay Area of San Francisco. I present the designing of the maps, highlighting the use of dérive, and art practice in the creation of an emotional landscape, and its contribution in making the ethnography interactive, emergent, and sensorial. Dream narration and its sharing became visible and social during the creation of the artwork and during the exhibits of the artwork."
