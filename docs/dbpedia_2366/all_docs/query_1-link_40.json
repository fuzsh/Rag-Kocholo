Curtis was the definition of a family man, devoting his time and focus to his two children, Brent and Bettina, and then-wife Debra. Life took him many places, oftentimes bouncing between his beloved Montana and Wisconsin, but his home was always wherever his family settled. In his later years, he enjoyed watching his family grow, seeing his two children find happiness in love, playing with and guiding his two young grandchildren, Lillian and Maximillian as well as continuing to provide a gentle, guiding hand to his children as they followed their own paths. Also, a product of the free-love era, maintaining his love of classic jams, he often participated in and organized karaoke and singing events to pay tribute to his outspoken and rebellious generation. Curtis was a friendly, social man who could have a conversation with anyone about anything and could find a friend in anyone. Curtis will be deeply missed by his remaining family - ever a steady, supportive, guiding light in their lives. His memories will be cherished, and legacy carried by his son and grandchildren.\n\nSubmitted: September 7, 2021\n\n1996\n\nDarrell J Erdman — Middleton, WI, passed away February 11, 2020.

Though her given name was Lorraine, most people in the Kenosha community knew her as \"Holly\". Lorraine was born on February 27, 1929, in Elma, Iowa to Alfred and Ella Bachmann. She was the oldest of three girls that grew up on the family farm. She graduated from Riceville High School in Riceville, Iowa in 1947 and from Allen Memorial Lutheran Hospital School of Nursing in Waterloo, Iowa in 1950. Lorraine did post-graduate work in Maternity care at the Margaret Hauge Maternity Center in Jersey City, New Jersey. She also received NAACOG Certification as a Certified Nurse in Obstetrics in 1976. Lorraine graduated from Carthage College with a BA in Social Work in 1979. Her passion for nursing and helping others began during high school when she worked summers with her Aunt Erma Bachmann Manning, a Nurse who managed the Elma, Iowa Hospital. She began her RN career as the PM Supervisor at Allen Memorial Hospital in Waterloo, Iowa from 1951-1953. It was at Allen Memorial Hospital she met her future husband John W. Hollingsworth who also happened to be an RN and the Head Surgical Nurse at Allen Memorial. They were married on April 11, 1953, at St. Paul's Lutheran Church in Maple Leaf, Iowa and later moved to Kenosha, Wisconsin. In 1954 their only son John was born. Lorraine's career as an Obstetrical Nurse and Obstetrical Supervisor at both Kenosha Memorial Hospital and St. Catherine's Hospital began in 1953 and ended when she retired in 1999. Her passion for nursing never really ended. If anyone was blessed to have given birth in Kenosha during those years, there is a good possibility that Holly helped to care for you and your baby and maybe eventually your grandchildren. In 1970, Lorraine saw a need for prenatal care for mothers. To meet that need she volunteered her time to offer \"Holly's Childbirth Classes\" that met at Grace Lutheran Church. Lorraine founded a nonprofit organization, Pregnancy-Childbirth-Childcare-Parenting Inc. that provided prenatal education to families in Kenosha from 1980 to 1986. St. Catherine's Hospital eventually named her the Maternal-Child Outreach Coordinator in 1987 and PCCP was dissolved. Lorraine was a volunteer member of the Kenosha Unified School District School-Aged Mother's program that started in 1970. She provided medical information to the expectant teenaged mothers enrolled in the Kenosha School System. She was very proud to be a part of this program. She was recognized by the community as Kenosha Woman of the Year in 1979 for her volunteer work providing prenatal care to families and students in this program. Retirement fostered her passion for volunteer work in the community and for dancing. She served on the Board of Directors for the Easter Seal Society, drove for the Volunteer Transportation Service, volunteered at Aurora Hospital and the Kenosha Senior Center, and her beloved Grace Lutheran Church--the Food Pantry, Baby Moses program, Church Council, Dorcas (quilting group) and Bible Study Group J. The week after she retired she declared that she was going to take tap dance lessons. She was part of a group of women that would perform a tap-dancing show anywhere, anytime. She also performed in numerous dance recitals in Kenosha and Northern IL. She loved ballroom dancing. On most weekends she could be found dancing with her friends at VFWs in Antioch and Kenosha, the Hiawatha in Racine, the Kenosha Senior Center, and the Moose in Kenosha. Lorraine met a new dance partner Roy Anderson. They got engaged and planned to marry. Tragically Roy had an accident at his home and passed away. She loved working in the yard, putting puzzles together, driving her John Deere lawnmower, and nursing her raspberry patch so she could make pies and lately talking with family on Face Time. Lorraine was preceded in death by her husband John W. Hollingsworth, her parents Alfred (Ella Groth) Bachmann, sister and brother-in-law Avis, and Melvin Johnson, brother Fred Bachmann, fiancé Roy Anderson and many close friends.

She is the sound of the rain that lulls you to sleep, all the colors of the rainbow, she is Christmas morning. She lives inside your laughter, your smile, and your heart. She’s the place you call home and the compass which guides you on your journey. Nothing on Earth can separate you from her. Not time, not space, not even death…\n\nSubmitted: May 13, 2022\n\nDavid A.

Rick is also survived by his sister Barb Taylor (Wayne), niece Kris Davenport (Rob) and great niece Natalie Davenport, as well as grandpets Mallie, Wells and Butters — all of whom he loved dearly. Rick was deeply passionate about his career in Human Resources and headed up that aspect of corporate life for several manufacturing companies in Cook and Lake Counties. After retirement from the corporate world, and due to his gifted ability to mentor those looking for professional support in the job hunt and career advancement, Rick devoted countless hours to help job seekers through The Barrington Career Center (formerly Career Place). An avid golfer, Rick both played regularly, and in his retirement years worked on the links as a starter at Barrington Hills Country Club. A humble man, Rick was a much better golfer than he’d lead you to believe and thoroughly enjoyed his time on the fairways, greens, and even very, very occasionally in the rough. Rick loved the Chicago White Sox, and his favorite team ever was the 1959 American League champion team that starred his favorite player, Nellie Fox. He also had a deep passion for college football and basketball and took great pride in rooting for what he liked to call “The Three I’s” of the Big Ten – since he grew up a University of Illinois fan and sent his daughters to Indiana University and the University of Iowa. Even with all these passions and hobbies, Rick loved nothing more than to spend time with his loved ones. His upbeat spirit was infectious in the best way imaginable, and his warm smile and loving demeanor could turn your bad day into a great day in a split second. He was selfless in the way he cared for others and was always willing to offer a helping hand. Rick was as great a husband, father, father-in-law, grandfather, brother, and friend as any of us could have ever asked for and that legacy will keep Rick with us forever.\n\nSubmitted: April 25, 2023\n\n1972\n\nRichard C.
