        "text": "The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen is making progress in providing higher-quality education to cultivate innovative professionals with a global perspective, by strengthening international exchanges and cooperation, and constructing cutting-edge disciplines.\n\nWith the aim \"to bring together China and the West\", the CUHK-Shenzhen has educated more than 5,600 students from all over the world.\n\nBy the end of 2019, the university had completed more than 170 international cooperation projects with more than 100 overseas universities in 29 countries and regions across the globe.\n\nStatistics show that the CUHK-Shenzhen ranked second in the list of numbers of undergraduates in 2019 from the Chinese mainland admitted to the top 16 universities in the United States and the United Kingdom, just following Peking University.\n\n\"Identifying itself as an internationalized university since its establishment in 2012, the CUHK-Shenzhen has conducted a raft of international exchange programs. And we are determined to do that even better in the future,\" said Xu Yangsheng, president of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen.\n\nLed by Xu's team, the university has established world-class teams of experts in multiple fields, including robotics, artificial intelligence, big data, new materials and energy science, international finance and logistics, pharmaceuticals and precision medicine.\n\nThe three laboratories of computational biology, original new drug and precision and regenerative medicine led by three Nobel Prize winners highlight the CUHK-Shenzhen's achievements in cutting-edge technology research.\n\n\"Subjects such as data science, bioinformatics and biomedicine have strong resonance with the pulse of the times,\" Xu said, citing that education should interact with local industries and society.\n\n\"We have established joint laboratories with big name enterprises in all walks of life, including Chinese tech giants Huawei, Tencent and domestic e-commerce retailer JD, which helps make our education down to earth,\" Xu noted.\n\nIn the long term, the CUHK-Shenzhen is committed to cultivating top-level professionals that the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area needs in the coming 20 years, according to the university president.\n\nBy the end of 2019, the CUHK-Shenzhen had employed more than 350 world-renowned teachers, including four Nobel Prize winners, two Turing Award recipients and one Fields Medal winner.\n\nWith schools of management and economics, science and engineering, humanities and social science, life and health science and date science, the university has 17 undergraduate majors including finance, marketing, international business, accounting, computer science and technology, new energy science and engineering, mathematics and applied mathematics, English, bioinformatics and biomedical engineering.\n\nLast year, the CUHK-Shenzhen reached a cooperation agreement with the Shenzhen government and the Chinese University of Hong Kong, to establish a medical school and its affiliated hospital, in an attempt to cultivate international medical professionals for the Greater Bay Area.\n\nEarlier this month, the university announced that it is about to found a school of music, which is expected to \"improve students' imagination and creativity\", according to university president Xu."
