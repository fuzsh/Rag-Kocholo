Among all, Professor Jun YU ranks 1st nationally and 96th globally. The ranking of top 1,000 female scientists in the world includes leading female scientists from all major areas of science. It was based on a meticulous examination of more than 160,000 scientists on their H-index and bibliometric indicators. The three CU Medicine scholars are all from the Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, including Professor Jun YU, Professor Jean WOO and Professor Juliana CHAN. The goal of the \"Best Female Scientists\" ranking is to inspire female scholars with the example of successful women in the scientific community, and hope that it will contribute to providing more opportunities, visibility, and equal chances for women in science.
