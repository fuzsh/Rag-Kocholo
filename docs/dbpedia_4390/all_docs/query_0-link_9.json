        "text": "Beijing: Mainland Chinese students were evacuated from Hong Kong university campuses on Wednesday by boat and bus after a night of clashes between riot police and protesters turned the Chinese University of Hong Kong campus into a battlefield.\n\nThe students boarded buses at the Chinese University campus in Sha Tin, after Hong Kong Marine Police had earlier taken other students by boat from a nearby pier.\n\nThe official Weibo social media account of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League announced on Wednesday morning that mainland students in Hong Kong could access free accommodation in Shenzhen if they returned across the border.\n\nOn Wednesday morning public transport was disrupted by protests for a third day. Rail lines connecting the New Territories to Kowloon and Hong Kong Island were closed and multiple roads barricaded. Office workers protested at lunchtime in the Central business district for a third day.\n\nThe education department bowed to pressure from teacher groups who criticised Chief Executive Carrie Lam's government for not closing schools on safety grounds. Multiple schools said classes were suspended while the education board said parents could choose whether to send children to school.\n\nPhotographs circulated on social media of school girls in uniform being lined up against a subway wall by riot police conducting identity checks.\n\nBeijing's liaison office in Hong Kong called for Lam's government and police to take \"all necessary means to forcefully crack down on various acts of violence and terrorism‚Äù.\n\nIn the square outside the Hong Kong stock exchange, riot police moved in with batons to arrest office workers.\n\nFour Chinese University of Hong Kong students charged with rioting appeared in court, while a fifth remained in hospital.\n\nRoads outside the Baptist University were barricaded with bricks to slow any police charge onto the campus.\n\nHong Kong media reported mainland students at City University dormitories had been advised to go to the mainland as a precaution as tensions between police and protesters escalated.\n\nLawyers for the students' association at the Chinese University sought a High Court injunction to stop police returning to the university campus in the New Territories, with a hearing due Wednesday evening. A petition signed by more than 600 Hong Kong and international academics criticised the police storming of the university campus and use of tear gas and rubber bullets.\n\nThe president of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Rocky Tuan, was hit with police tear gas on Tuesday night while attempting to negotiate for calm between police and students as a day of tense stand-offs on campus erupted into a battlefield at night.\n\nTuan, a world-renowned biomedical scientist, was 50 metres from police as they opened fire with rubber bullets and tear gas and reportedly shouted at him that it \"isn't the time to negotiate\".\n\nMultiple students were hit in an initial barrage at 7.30pm that lasted 10 minutes, Radio Television Hong Kong reported. But clashes between students and police continued for another three hours, turning a bridge on the outskirts of the campus into a battlefield.\n\nThe university's pro vice-chancellor, Dennis Ng, arrived wearing a gas mask and yellow helmet and shouted at police with a loud speaker to stop firing. Ng said he had struck a deal with the police commander for the barrage to stop, but police continued to fire.\n\nProtesters were later shown being carried out on stretchers from the university gym where a makeshift medical centre was created.\n\nTuan had sought to negotiate a deal for the police to withdraw from the university campus in return for the university sending security guards to protect the bridge.\n\nProtesters had thrown bricks and objects onto a highway below from the bridge, amid a general strike across the city designed to disrupt transport and traffic.\n\nThe students had demanded Tuan also call for the release of students arrested on campus earlier in the day, with at least one reported to be facing a charge of rioting which could mean up to 10 years in jail.\n\nTear gas had billowed across the university's sports grounds through the afternoon as riot police made repeated incursions into the campus.\n\nTuan had stridden past the blazing wreck of a car towards police front lines to negotiate.\n\nFrontline police lost patience and opened fire.\n\nStudents with umbrellas continued to push forward against police lines on the bridge, throwing Molotov cocktails and throwing back police tear gas canisters.\n\nLoading\n\nInjured protesters were dragged back from the frontline by first aid workers. Fire engines arrived at the university to put out fires lit by protesters. The campus is up a hill and remote from the nearest town, Shatin.\n\nThe police water cannon arrived on the bridge at 10pm to repel protesters with high pressure sprays of blue dye.\n\nShortly afterwards police issued a statement saying police and the school were \"arranging a retreat to stop the stand-off. The police appeal to the protesters to stop charging\".\n\nBy 10.30pm the university's former president, Joseph Sung, a prominent Hong Kong doctor, arrived in gas mask and goggles to talk to students and seek a truce. Sung told them three students arrested had been granted bail.\n\nA group of academics from several universities had earlier decried the police incursions on to multiple university campuses on Tuesday, saying these were places where thousands of students lived and studied and were permitted to hold gatherings.\n\nFifty people were hospitalised on Tuesday. There were unconfirmed reports that injured students at the Chinese University could not reach hospitals.\n\nOne local politician estimated a thousand tear gas canisters had been fired at the campus by police.\n\nThe Chinese University of Hong Kong was where tertiary students from across Hong Kong had declared a strike in September, and had been dubbed \"the university of rioters\" by pro-Beijing groups.\n\nRocky Tuan had recently written a letter to Lam asking for an independent investigation into the cases of students who had been arrested and had alleged mistreatment by police during the summer of protests."
