        "text": "Dr. Davy Cheng, Distinguished University Professor of Medicine, has accepted a position as the Founding Dean and Presidential Chair Professor of the School of Medicine at The Chinese University of Hong Kong – Shenzhen in China.\n\nCheng, who was previously the Acting Dean at the Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, will begin his new role on July 1, 2021.\n\n“I am inspired by the bold vision of The Chinese University of Hong Kong to establish a world class medical school and to operate an academic teaching medical centre in Shenzhen, China,” Cheng shared.\n\n\"I’m most looking forward to the challenge of leading a team in developing and transforming how we train physicians in this biomedical and digital era.”\n\nAfter an extensive international search by The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Cheng was selected for the role due to his experience in medical education leadership and as a globally recognized healthcare leader at the forefront of research, practice and healthcare policy in the fields of perioperative surgical and anesthesia care, cardiac surgery, critical care medicine, and evidence-based clinical decision-making.\n\nOver the course of a 20 year career at Schulich Medicine & Dentistry, he has made a significant impact as a leader and clinician-scientist. He held several leadership roles at the School, including as Vice Dean of Faculty Affairs, Chair/Chief of the Department of Anesthesia & Perioperative Medicine and as Chair of the Committee of Clinical Chairs.\n\n“My fondest memories are the success of our teamwork. It was a privilege to work with committed faculty in my Department of Anesthesia & Perioperative Medicine to establish the first city-wide academic department,” he said. “Working with all the Clinical Chairs and the Dean, we developed the first activity and performance based budgetary policy at the School. As Vice Dean Faculty Affairs, I got the chance to work with all our clinical faculty in modernizing the Conditions of Appointment for Physicians.”\n\nHe has consistently helped to foster growth and innovation in research, clinical care and policy implementation at the School. He established the Evidence-Based Perioperative Clinical Outcomes Research Group (EPiCOR) and the MEDICI Centre (Medical Evidence, Decision Integrity, Clinical Impact) at the School and its teaching hospitals. His work with the MEDICI Centre garnered recognition by the World Health Organization.\n\nCheng, an internationally recognized researcher in perioperative anesthesia and critical care, has published more than 160 peer-reviewed papers and 60 books or book chapters, and held over $13.5 million in peer-reviewed grants. He was elected to the World Health Organization (WHO) GIEESC (Global Initiative for Emergency & Essential Surgical Care) Anaesthesia Committee in 2013.\n\nAs he departs, Cheng says he is thankful to the colleagues, friends, mentors and mentees that he has met and worked with throughout his time at the School."
