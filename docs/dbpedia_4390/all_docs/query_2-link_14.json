        "text": "For those who know me well, you will know the China story has been core to my entire adult life. Almost 23 years ago, I was approaching my eighteenth birthday when I made my first visit to China and taught English in a small northern Chinese city. I am thrilled to announce that this week I am starting a new chapter in Shenzhen to take up a dual position at The Chinese University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen as Advisor to the President, and Graduate College Master. The former of these roles will see me contributing to the University’s growing internationalisation agenda, and the latter will involve reimagining the postgraduate student experience for the 21st century. In just ten years, CUHK-Shenzhen has grown from nothing to a thriving community of more than 11,000 students, and has beaten the likes of NYU and Duke in the Shanghai Ranking for five consecutive years to be the number one joint venture campus in China. Despite all my time spent there over the years, this will be the first time I will actually be employed in mainland China since working as a school teacher in 2002. And a lot has changed. In those days, it took twelve hours to travel the 400 kilometres on the train to Beijing from where I lived in northern China, and China had just entered the World Trade Organisation. Today China has built the world’s largest network of high speed rail spanning 45,000 kilometres, and you can get the train all the way from Beijing to Hong Kong in under nine hours, or Shenzhen to Hong Kong in under 15 minutes. More than ten million undergraduates are forecast to finish university this year alone - compared to the million or so who did when I first came here. Education has been at the heart of my China story. It has been a privilege to witness the development of this extraordinary country, and I can’t wait to be just that bit closer and contribute to the next chapter of China’s higher education system."
