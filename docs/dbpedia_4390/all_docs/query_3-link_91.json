        "text": "'Deep insights into the complexities of health, its determinants and the wider development context in Asia have been hard to come by for students, practitioners and policy-makers. The Handbook remedies this shortfall with a highly authoritative, expert account of global public health in Asia.' – Sir Liam Donaldson, Chair in Health Policy, Imperial College, London, UK\n\n'This handbook represents a joint effort of the global community of healthcare professionals. Experts in public health and policy makers from North to South and East to West contribute their knowledge and share their experiences on various topics of global health. I pay tribute to their great efforts in this important work. I recommend this book to every medical student, practising medical practitioner, healthcare policy maker and academic in the healthcare profession.' – Joseph J. Y. Sung, Mok Hing Yiu Professor of Medicine and Vice-Chancellor and President of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) since 2010\n\n'The book is a significant contribution to our understanding of health in this most populous region of the world—a region that has seen remarkable improvements in health, especially over the past two decades. With a focus on East and Southeast Asia, it is highly recommended as an excellent source of information and analysis.' – Richard A. Cash MD, MPH; Senior Lecturer, Department of Global Health and Population, Harvard School of Public Health and Visiting Professor, Public Health Foundation of India\n\n'This handbook is one of the most important readings for those interested in global public health in general and in Asia specifically. It offers fascinating insights into many great achievements Asian countries have made over the past decades, and enormous challenges those countries are facing in the years to come.' – Shenglan Tang, Professor of Medicine and Global Health and Associate Director of Duke Global Health Institute, USA\n\n'With the accelerated globalization, great changes have taken place in health systems, medical technology and the disease spectrum which demand multi-discipline cooperation to explore the solutions to a series of issues brought by globalization from different perspectives. This book provides good support to learn about global health including challenges in global health and strategy as well as best practice in response to these challenges. The book can be used not only as a textbook for medical students, but also provides valuable learning material for public health professionals.' – Yan Guo, School of Public Health, Peking University, China\n\n\"Researchers looking for perspectives on public health in Hong Kong and China will find the volume helpful because many chapters were written by distinguished scholars and practitioners.\"--K. H. Jacobsen, George Mason University\n\nSumming Up: Recommended. Graduate students, researchers/faculty, and professionals/practitioners. - CHOICE"
