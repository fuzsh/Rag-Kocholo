        "text": "Born in Hong Kong, Dr. Ken Chu currently serves as a National Committee Member of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, Council Member of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and Chairman and CEO of Mission Hills Group.\n\nAs a leader in China's hospitality and leisure industry, Ken has spurred the Group’s business expansion based on the \"Golf and More\" leisure philosophy. Today, the Group’s businesses span the provinces of Guangdong and Hainan, with Mission Hills being recognised as a National 5A-Level Scenic Spot, and accredited as the \"World’s Largest Golf Club\" and \"World’s Largest Mineral Springs and Spa Resort\" by the Guinness World Records. Under Ken’s vision and leadership, Mission Hills has evolved as a dynamic and creative conglomerate with eight major business segments incorporating golf tourism; integrated sports development; leisure & commercial ventures; tourism real estate; culture & entertainment; education; health & wellness; and brand partnership.\n\nKen plays a pivotal role as a super-connector, bringing into China brand offerings and experiences from around the globe to build the different concepts spanning retail-tainment, edu-tainment and more. He established partnerships including the Mission Hills•Huayi Brothers•Feng Xiaogang Movie Town, an attraction and studio site for more than a dozen mega-productions annually, as well as working with Guangxi Investment Group to introduce the world-class SplashCity water park.\n\nThe Group is committed to sports development and has partnered Futbol Club Barcelona (FCB) and NBA to make Hainan province a hub for football and basketball, spurring the growth of these sports from the grassroots. These include setting up China’s first FCB-managed football academy and NBA Basketball School as well as interactive experiences at Mission Hills Haikou.\n\nBy actively promoting cultural and sports exchanges between China and the world, Ken has introduced more than 100 international sporting events and visits by Hollywood stars to China. Using sports as the common language, he continues to tell the story of China and spread its goodwill to the world.\n\nBorn in Hong Kong, Tenniel is the Honorary Vice Chairman of Mission Hills Group, overseeing its overall operations and development. Under Tenniel’s leadership, the organization has exceeded international standards to become the benchmark for other golf and leisure operators in China, growing the game from ground up in the world’s largest market to being named the World’s Best Golf Resorts.\n\nBeing a pioneer in the sports and leisure tourism industry across China and Asia-Pacific, Tenniel has been at the forefront of ground-breaking ventures spanning a plethora of sports, driven by a mission to connect China to the world and the world to China, through the common language of sports.\n\nTenniel played a key role in putting China on the world map of golf, beginning with Tiger Woods’ first visit to China in 2001 and again in 2011, followed by the Dynasty Cup in 2003 and the Goodwill Trophy in 2005. Since then, Mission Hills has staged five editions of the World Cup of Golf, six editions of the World Ladies Championship and other historic golfing events including the WGC-HSBC Champions in 2012, “The Match at Mission Hills” between Woods and Rory McIlroy in 2013 and the World Celebrity Pro-Am.\n\nTenniel also spearheaded Mission Hills’ efforts in establishing itself as a leader in junior golf development, creating the world’s largest programme encompassing world-class coaching and year-round tournaments, in addition to impactful partnerships with some of the biggest names in golf, including Jack Nicklaus, Annika Sorenstam and Sir Nick Faldo. Assuming a golf ambassadorial role beyond Mission Hills, Tenniel was the first – and is still the only – Chinese national to become a member of golf’s governing body, The Royal and Ancient Golf Club (R&A) based at St Andrews.\n\nBuilding on the Group’s philosophy of ‘Golf and More’, Tenniel has been instrumental in driving the development of other sports in China. These partnerships include the world’s first Boris Becker Tennis Academy in Shenzhen, as well as training academies and programmes with FC Barcelona, the NBA, and the Deaf International Football Association (DIFA). In the pipeline is a New Energy Vehicle (NEV) hub in Hainan that will also feature a world-class racing circuit and karting facility, in addition to a racing academy, ushering in a new era of automotive sports in China.\n\nBeyond his duties at Mission Hills, Tenniel remains actively involved in multiple Hong Kong and mainland China community organizations."
