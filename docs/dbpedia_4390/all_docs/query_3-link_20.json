        "text": "9th January 2024 – (Hong Kong) Rocky Tuan, the President and Vice-Chancellor of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), has reportedly resigned from his position amidst an ongoing investigation by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) into a medical research centre associated with the university. The centre in question is allegedly managed by Cecilia Lo Wen-ya, Tuan’s spouse. Today, the university issued a statement stating that they received the resignation decision of Vice-Chancellor Rocky S. Tuan yesterday. He will step down from his position as the university’s head in January next year.\n\nCUHK expressed deep appreciation for Professor Rocky Tuan’s dedicated service and leadership over the past six years. Together with his colleagues, they achieved significant milestones, including the establishment of the first “Co-op@CUHK” program in Hong Kong, the oversight of the CUHK-Shenzhen School of Medicine and School of Music, notable advancements in global university rankings and research excellence, significant progress in mainland China and international collaborations, as well as leading the university’s innovation, entrepreneurship, and sustainable development initiatives.\n\nProfessor Rocky Tuan expressed his honour to have served CUHK since 1st January, 2018. He highlighted his contributions to the university’s development alongside his colleagues. With the support of national and Hong Kong government policies, they have worked together to establish Hong Kong as an international hub for education and innovation.\n\nMeanwhile, the ICAC, which verified the ongoing investigation in August 2023, is examining the Centre for Cardiovascular Genomics and Medicine at CUHK. The scrutiny pertains to potential “corruption, misconduct in public office, and misappropriation connected to the centre’s funding and operational practices,” according to an ICAC spokesperson.\n\nLaw enforcement officers were reported to have executed their investigatory mandate at the university premises last year, backed by court-sanctioned warrants. This included interviews and thorough searches, although no arrests have been announced. “As inquiries are active, we are not in a position to comment further at this stage,” the ICAC representative added.\n\nThe Centre for Cardiovascular Genomics and Medicine, inaugurated in 2018, has been under the directorship of Lo, who holds visiting professorships within CUHK’s Department of Medicine and Therapeutics, as well as the Department of Paediatrics. The centre has been a beneficiary of notable funding, receiving an initial HK$10 million from the CUHK Vice-Chancellor Discretionary Fund, under the auspices of former president Joseph Sung Jao-yiu, and a subsequent HK$20 million from the Lui Che Woo Institute of Innovative Medicine.\n\nThe unfolding situation has prompted CUHK Medical Centre to release a statement, clarifying that the ongoing investigation does not involve the CUHK Medical Centre or the CUHK Medical Clinic.\n\nIn addition, CUHK has witnessed the abrupt termination of another senior executive. Eric Ng Shu-pui, who served as vice-president and secretary, was dismissed with immediate effect in December 2023. The decision was prompted by a loss of confidence in Ng’s support for the council’s work, according to council chairman John Chai Yat-chiu.\n\nTo ensure seamless operations at both the council and the university, a motion was passed to terminate Ng’s employment contract forthwith. Ng is to receive a cash payment instead of a notice period, as stated by Chai.\n\nIn the interim, Provost Alan Chan Kam-leung will assume the role of acting vice-president until a permanent replacement is found. Additionally, Amelia Wong Chan Wai-ping, the deputy university secretary, has been appointed as University Secretary effective immediately until 31st December, 2024."
