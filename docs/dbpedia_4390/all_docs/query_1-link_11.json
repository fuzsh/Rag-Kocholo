        "text": "Rocky Tuan, the embattled head of the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), has resigned, the university has said in a statement.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, the university said that the CUHK council had received a resignation letter from Tuan on Monday.\n\nTuan, whose latest three-year term as vice-chancellor and president of CUHK began last Monday, said he would step down in January 2025.\n\nThe statement quoted Tuan as saying: “As the new governance structure is implemented following the amendment of the CUHK Ordinance, I believe now is an opportune moment for the University to search for a new Vice-Chancellor and President.”\n\nCUHK statement on Rocky Tuan’s resignation – click to view.\n\nThe Chairman of the Council of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) received yesterday (8 January 2024) a letter from Professor Rocky S. Tuan on his decision to step down from the position of Vice-Chancellor and President of the University with effect from January 2025.\n\nThe University is grateful to Professor Tuan for his leadership and dedicated service over six years of service, especially in pioneering the first-of-its-kind Co-op@CUHK education programme, overseeing the planning and establishment of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen) School of Medicine and School of Music in 2020, reaching historical-highs in international university rankings and achieving excellent research performance, leading a role in global and national partnerships, and being a pivotal player in innovation, entrepreneurship and sustainable development, together with the concerted and dedicated effort of the University management and academic staff.\n\nProfessor Tuan expressed his profound gratitude to the University, and that it had been an honour and privilege for him to serve the University since 1 January 2018. He thanked his team for their commitment to the advancement of the University and contribution to the policy objectives of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Central Governments to make Hong Kong an international education and innovation hub.\n\nSpeaking about his decision, Professor Tuan said “As the new governance structure is implemented following the amendment of the CUHK Ordinance, I believe now is an opportune moment for the University to search for a new Vice-Chancellor and President. Serving the CUHK community has been an extraordinary honour and a privilege. Hong Kong is my home. It was humbling to be given the opportunity to return here and be entrusted with the noble responsibility to deliver the core mission of this great institution. I am deeply grateful to the entire CUHK community for their support throughout my tenure.”\n\nProfessor Tuan is committed to using his best endeavours over the next twelve months to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nThe Council will establish a committee in accordance with Statute 6.1 of The Chinese University of Hong Kong Ordinance, composed of the Chairman of the Council, 3 members nominated by the Council and 3 members nominated by the Senate, to advise the Council on the appointment of the next Vice-Chancellor and President.\n\nIn the statement, the university said it was grateful to Tuan for his leadership and service over six years, citing the establishment of The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen) School of Medicine and School of Music in 2020 and CUHK reaching record highs in international university rankings.\n\nA committee will be set up to advise the council on the appointment of Tuan’s replacement.\n\nLast November, the Legislative Council passed a bill to overhaul the structure of CUHK’s governing council, which saw the number of seats fall from 55 to 34 and reduced the influence of staff and academics in the running of one of Hong Kong’s top universities. Ahead of its approval, more than 1,500 people signed a petition to oppose the bill, saying it would have a negative impact on the institution’s academic autonomy.\n\nTuan’s resignation came after the CUHK council last month fired vice-president Eric Ng, who was among the signatories of the petition. The council said it “no longer has confidence” in Ng’s ability to serve as a senior officer.\n\nAsked then by reporters about Tuan’s future at the university, council chairperson John Chai did not specify whether similar action would be taken against Tuan.\n\nTuan, a 72-year-old biomedical scientist, had served as vice-chancellor and president of CUHK since 2018, succeeding Joseph Sung.\n\nDuring the 2019 protests and unrest, which were sparked by a controversial amendment to the city’s extradition bill before growing into wider calls for democracy and against Beijing’s encroachment, CUHK became a flashpoint between protesters and police.\n\nTuan has since been criticised by prominent pro-establishment figures – including former chief executive Leung Chun-ying – as being too sympathetic towards student protesters.\n\nSupport HKFP | Policies & Ethics | Error/typo? | Contact Us | Newsletter | Transparency & Annual Report | Apps"
