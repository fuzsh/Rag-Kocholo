It includes a compilation of the current public debate on regulatory issues with useful international comparisons. No doubt this book will contribute to the very lively debate on corporate governance in Hong Kong” (Dr Andrew Sheng, former Chairman, Securities and Futures Commission (HK)).\n\n“It is clearly very thoughtful and comprehensive scholarship. The authors are to be congratulated on their research. I am sure the book is proving to be influential.”(Professor Ian Ramsay, Director of Centre for Corporate Law and Securities Regulation, University of Melbourne)\n\n“There is much of value in this book and it connects Hong Kong to the international debate. It contains material which is international in outlook and broader than is often found in corporate governance literature. It contains a number of ideas which will no doubt stimulate further debate in Hong Kong. The authors are to be congratulated in producing a work of this quality.” (((2005) Vol 15, No 6, Company Secretary, p 37 reviewed by Professor John Farrar, Bond University)\n\n“It is impressive.

((1995) 11 Insolvency Law & Practice, p 89 (reviewed by Richard Hardwick, Nicholson Graham & Jones))\n\nVery good on unfair prejudice (my chapter) … (Gerard McMeel, University of Bristol)\n\nA good reference book for Australian student (Clement Shum, University of Newcastle, Australia)\n\nAn impressive casebook … (Paul Eden, University of Leeds)\n\nIts contextual style, its extracts from consultation papers, reports and articles are reasons for recommending it. The chapters on directors duties and minority shareholders (my chapters) are superb in that these topics are dealt with comprehensively (John Lowry, Brunel University)\n\nGood selection of cases, good extracts from reports etc (Vanessa Finch, London School of Economics and Political Science)\n\nParticularly liked the introduction and explanation which precedes the source materials. Excellent scope of coverage. (Jill Poole, University of Wales, Cardiff Law School)\n\nExcellent balance between the academic & the practical (Adrian Walters, Nottingham Trent University)\n\n23. Minority Shareholders’ Protection, (1994) Cavendish Publishing Ltd, London, 151 pages + xviii. Externally refereed.

(Professor L C B Gower, author of leading text Gower’s Principles of Modern Company Law (5th edn 1992), Sweet & Maxwell)\n\nThere have been many company law books which also deal with minority shareholders’ protection but no one has done an in-depth analysis on this area as has this book … It provides answers to many fundamental questions… A brief but excellent conclusion capturing the strengths and weaknesses of the English law in this area… This book will be of great interest to company lawyers outside the English jurisdiction too. (Original review in French) ((1995) Revue Internationale de Droit Compare, pp 807-808, (reviewed by Professor Andre Tunc, Universite de Paris)).\n\nThe book plays a useful role in supplementing the treatment of minority shareholders’ right found in traditional textbooks. Academics will welcome its dissection of the principal elements … Its treatment of the procedural aspects will give it a certain appeal as regards the practitioner. ([1995] 7 International Company and Commercial Law Review p 263 (reviewed by Michael Lower, Senior Lecturer in Law, Liverpool John Moores University, Consultant with Davis & Co, London)\n\nA much needed text… Major strengths – combination of substantive law and procedural and practical aspects.

(Sir Robert Megarry, formerly Vice Chancellor of the Supreme Court, England, author of the leading text Megarry & Wade, The Law of Real Property (5th edn 1984), Stevens)\n\nRecommend it as alternative to Professor Kevin Gray’s Elements of Land Law (Professor Robert Pearce, University of Buckingham)\n\nSuggest recommending this book to replace McKenzie & Phillips, A Practical Approach to Land Law, and Maudsley & Burn, Land Law: Cases and Materials. Very good concept, more user-friendly. (Martin Memmings, University College Salford)\n\nIt fills a very useful gap … There have been many recent publications in Land Law but not in the form of cases and materials put well into context as in this book. (Honor Lowless, University of Exeter)\n\nWell received by students because of clarity of text, authority of author. A comprehensive compendium of material and text for a difficult subject. (Tim Vollans, Coventry University)\n\nThe book is very refreshing… particularly liked the practical approach and law commission reports thus making what can be a dry subject more interesting (K Crutchley, De Montfort University)\n\nI must say I found this to be an excellent new text & I am sure it will find its place alongside other established casebooks & sourcebooks on land law. I am today writing to our librarian with a view to asking her to order 15-20 copies for our law library. I found the coverage of all topics to be excellent and the choice of source materials was always appropriate. (Barry Horton, Manchester Metropolitan University)\n\nA quality book (M Cardwell, University of Leeds)\n\nThe book is helpful in linking together related parts that may appear unconnected to the students.
