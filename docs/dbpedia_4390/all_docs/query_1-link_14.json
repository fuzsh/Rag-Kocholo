In his prior career he worked as Principal Engineer at Emerson Process Management from 1992 – 1995, Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, and Professor and the holder of the Paul D. and Betty Robertson Meek and American Petrofina Foundation Centennial Professorship in Chemical Engineering from 1995 – 2007 at the University of Texas at Austin, and the Fluor Professor at the Viterbi School of Engineering of the University of Southern California from 2007 – 2019, during which time he took three years leave to be Vice President and Presidential Chair Professor at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. From January 2020 to June 2023 he was in Hong Kong serving as the inaugural Dean of the School of Data Science and Chair Professor of Data Science at the City University of Hong Kong.\n\nProf Qin’s education background is multidisciplinary. He obtained his B.S. and M.S. degrees in Automatic Control from Tsinghua University in Beijing, China, in 1984 and 1987, respectively. He then continued studying his Ph.D. in Automation at Tsinghua University until 1989, when he moved to the U.S. to pursue his Ph.D. degree in Chemical Engineering at University of Maryland, College Park. He completed his Ph.D. degree in June 1992.\n\nProf Qin is a Member of the European Academy of Sciences and Arts (EASA), Fellow of the Hong Kong Academy of Engineering Sciences (HKAES), Fellow of the U.S. National Academy of Inventors, Fellow of the International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC), AIChE Fellow, and IEEE Fellow. He is the recipient of the 2022 CAST Computing in Chemical Engineering Award by the American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AIChE) and the 2022 IEEE CSS Transition to Practice Award. To date he is the first and only recipient of both awards from Greater China. In his early career he received the U.S. National Science Foundation CAREER Award, the 2011 Northrop Grumman Best Teaching award at Viterbi School of Engineering, the DuPont Young Professor Award, Halliburton/Brown & Root Young Faculty Excellence Award, NSF-China Outstanding Young Investigator Award, MOE-China Changjiang Professorship, and the IFAC Best Paper Prize for a model predictive control paper published in Control Engineering Practice.\n\nProf Qin has published over 470 international journal papers, book chapters, conference papers, and plenary, invited, and contributed conference presentations. He is the inventor of 12 U.S. patents. He has delivered over 120 invited seminars and 26 short courses or workshops to industries or at technical conferences. His h-indices for Web of Science, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar are 69, 76, and 88, respectively. He received over 40,000 Google Scholar citations. He has advised more than 40 Ph.D. students graduating 32 with Ph.D. degrees. His research interests include data science and analytics, machine learning, process monitoring, model predictive control, system identification, smart manufacturing, smart cities, and predictive health maintenance.\n\nProf Qin has served as Senior Editor of Journal of Process Control, Editor of Control Engineering Practice, Member of the Editorial Board for Journal of Chemometrics, and Associate Editor for several other international journals. He was the National Organization Chair of the 10th IFAC Symposium on Advanced Control of Chemical Processes ADCHEM 2018."
