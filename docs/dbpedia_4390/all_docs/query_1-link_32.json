        "text": "In response to the call of the nation and the Pearl River Delta region for emerging and strategic industries, the University is planning to form a world class expert team and to forge a platform for international technology innovation in robotics and intelligent manufacturing, big data, new energy, and finance and logistics. Up to now, more than 3,000 undergraduate and postgraduate students are studying at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. Undergraduate programmes include Finance, Professional Accountancy, Global Business Studies, Marketing and Communication, Economics, Statistics, Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, Computer Science and Engineering, Electronic Information Engineering, New Energy Science and Engineer, Bioinformatics, and Translation. Postgraduate programs include Financial Engineering, Data Science, Finance, Economics, Accounting, Translation and Interpreting Studies, Simultaneous Interpreting and Supply Chain and Logistics Management. The University is now already offering one doctoral programme in Computer and Information Engineering.\n\nTo advance the creation, preservation, application and dissemination of knowledge through the pursuit of excellence in teaching, research and public service in a diverse range of disciplines, thereby serving the needs and enhancing the well-being of the citizens of the Pearl River Delta, China as a whole, and the wider world community. To be acknowledged regionally, nationally and internationally as a first-class research university whose bilingual and global dimensions of teaching and learning, scholarly output and contribution to the community consistently meet standards of excellence.\n\nThe emblem of CUHK is the mythical Chinese bird feng (鳳) which has been regarded as the Bird of the South since the Han dynasty. It is a symbol of nobility, beauty, loyalty and majesty. The University colours of CUHK are purple and gold, representing devotion and loyalty, and perseverance and resolution, respectively. The motto of CUHK is '博文約禮' or 'Through learning and temperance to virtue'. These words of Confucius have long been considered a principal precept of his teaching. It is recorded in the Analects of Confucius that the Master says, 'The superior man, extensively studying all learning, and keeping himself under the restraint of the rules of propriety, may thus likewise not overstep what is right.' (Legge's version of the Four Books) In choosing '博文約禮' as its motto, CUHK is laying equal emphasis on the intellectual and moral aspects of education."
