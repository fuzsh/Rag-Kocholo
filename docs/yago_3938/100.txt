Kris Jenner has opened up about her marriage to Robert Kardashian, saying that she never paid a bill while they were together and only took control of her own finances when they split.

In a recent interview Kris explained that during her marriage to Robert she had no idea about their bills, and only took control of her own finances after the marriage ended in 1991.

"One day, my friend Shelli Azoff said to me when I was going through my divorce, 'How much is your gardener?' And I said, 'I don’t know,'" she told The Wall Street Journal, adding, "That was the turning point for me. I was embarrassed that I didn’t know.

"I woke up one day to responsibilities that I hadn’t had the day before. And I needed to figure it out. And the good news is, I pay attention… I’m a quick study and I knew I had to get it together."

Jenner said she felt "such an enormous sense of accomplishment to be able to figure it all out and pay my own bills and make my own money and do my own taxes," adding, "There were times when I didn’t have a lot of money, but I was very organised."

While she was a bit clueless about her finances initially, Kris is now head of the huge Kardashian-Jenner business empire, which includes Kylie Cosmetics and Kendall's latest venture, tequila brand 818. Kris also recently launched a new plant-based cleaning solutions business named Safely with family friend Chrissy Teigen. So, I think it's safe to say she knows a few things about finances these days...
