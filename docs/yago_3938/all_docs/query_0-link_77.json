        "text": "Priscilla Presley had a tumultuous romance and marriage with Elvis Presley, that was retold in Sofia Coppola's latest film Priscilla, but she almost had a second marriage to Robert Kardashian.\n\nThis romance took place from 1975 to 1976, ending two years before Robert married the then Kris Houghton (now Kris Jenner) and went on to have Kourtney, Kim, Khloe, and Rob Kardashian. But before Robert would help create an American dynasty, he was planning on marrying the king of rock's ex-wife.\n\nThe two met through Robert's sister-in-law, Joan, who was divorced from Joe Esposito. Joe was the road manager for Elvis when he was on tour.\n\nREAD MORE: Priscilla Presley film script slammed by daughter Lisa Marie amid concern over Elvis\n\n\"Priscilla made Robert very happy,\" said their close friend Joni Migdal, \"He wanted to marry her and have children with her. That was definitely his hope, his plan.\"\n\nInsiders claimed that the year-long relationship ended because of Elvis' controlling personality. Larry Kraines, Robert's close friend, said that Robert described Priscilla as \"terrific...but this guy Elvis doesn't stop controlling her.\"\n\nHe added that Elvis didn't want his ex-wife to date around \"because they had [daughter] Lisa Marie, and Elvis was very involved in that.\" However, it appeared that the controlling personalities of Robert and Priscilla also contributed to the end of the relationship.\n\nTom Kardashian, Robert's brother, said: \"Priscilla really changed a lot of my brother’s thinking of how he should dress, how he should even drive, and what he should do — and she changed him easily because she was so attractive and so she had an influence on him.\"\n\nJoni added that in turn, Robert wanted to make Priscilla \"into a domesticated Armenian housewife, and that infuriated Priscilla.\" And when it came down to it, it was her cooking that infuriated the lawyer.\n\n\"Priscilla once tried to make dinner for Robert because he kept asking her, so Priscilla said that one night she cooked asparagus, and she made this and she made that, and she went out of her way to make it perfect, and he hated it,\" Joni said, \"She said that after that meal, he never suggested that she make dinner for him again.”\n\nThe two might have separated but they apparently still had love for each other. Robert was dying of esophageal cancer in 2003 and Priscilla had called him and, according to close sources, told him she loved him and he reportedly had tears in his eyes."
