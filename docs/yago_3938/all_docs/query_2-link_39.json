        "text": "Kris Jenner is used to putting it all out there—her family basically invented reality celebrities as fans know them today. But in an interview for Diane Von Furstenberg’s new podcast, InCharge With DVF, Jenner scratched open some old wounds when she took a deep dive into her marriage to Robert Kardashian.\n\n“I got married when I was very, very young. I met Robert when I was 18 years old. We dated for four years, got married at 22, sooner or later during my life when I was in my 30s, I had an affair and my biggest regret was the fact that it broke up my family,” Jenner, who has spoken about her failed marriage before, said.\n\n[video_embed id='5835964773001']RELATED: Kris Jenner admits there can be a \"depressing side\" to social media[/video_embed]\n\n“I didn't know what to do. I had four kids, I was single. I didn't know where I was going to live, I didn't know what I was going to do. I didn't know how I was going to make a living. It was the scariest time to be that young. I think I was 32 years old, and I had four children. My son was maybe a year old and it was scary,” she continued. “I was really, really scared. I remember picking myself up by my bootstraps one day. I have deep faith in God. I just started praying that God would just strengthen me, give me that power, give me the ability to be in charge of my own life. It was my turn to really grow up.”\n\nKris and Robert were married from 1978 to 1991 (he passed away in 2003). To say that Jenner took “charge” would be an understatement, since as everyone knows Jenner went on to become the OG momager and helped her daughters launch unprecedented careers. Of course she can also thank her ex, Caitlyn Jenner, who back then was still Bruce Jenner. The 64-year-old revealed that seeing her then-husband’s schedule and helping him to launch his speaking career is what ignited her own passion for managing.\n\n“He wanted to be on the speaking tour and do all these different things. And I don't know really where it all came from but by trial and error and by really rolling up my sleeves and trying to figure it out, I was able to get his speaking career started again,” she said.\n\nThe conversation covered quite a few other topics, from Kim’s budding law career and Jenner’s faith, to her overall feelings about being a mother and a grandmother. But things took an interesting turn when Jenner revealed the strangely sage social media advice she’s given all of her daughters as they grew… well, internet famous.\n\n“I think this is a different time and a different generation and a different age that we live in that suddenly the whole world is opened up to social media. When I think back at it, when we first started doing our show and really being that transparent, there was barely Twitter. Nowadays, there's also a bigger audience but there's more criticism,” Jenner mused.\n\n“So I think you just have to learn to live as honestly as you can but keep your eye on the road. I tell my kids don't get distracted by all the bulls--t and all the negativity and all the bad energy that can be sucked out of these social media platforms. Just go for the good. Stay true to who you [are] and everything will fall into place.”\n\nThe mother-of-six also revealed that she told her kids to not even go on the internet for a while after Keeping Up with the Kardashians launched, although whether or not they obliged is unclear. What is certain is that more and more celebs (including Kim Kardashian) are turning to social media breaks in a bid for better mental health, something that Jenner may have been onto all along.\n\nJust call it a momager’s intuition.\n\n[video_embed id='-1']BEFORE YOU GO: This baby definitely loves spa night[/video_embed]"
