        "text": "\"She was having a rough time with Robert in the divorce when I came into the picture,\" Caitlyn, who formerly identified as Bruce prior to her transition in 2015, explained during the explosive docuseries — which is currently streaming on Peacock.\n\nCaitlyn continued: \"He was doing everything to kind of make her life miserable. I saw what was going on from the outside and just said, 'This is ridiculous.' So, I called Robert up and said, 'Hey, let's go to dinner.'\"\n\nRobert and Kris' divorce was finalized in March 1991 after tying the knot in 1978.\n\nOne month later, the Kardashian-Jenner matriarch said \"I do\" to Caitlyn at a friend's lavish home in Bel-Air.\n\n\"We had been together five months and having a wonderful time,\" the Republican news commentator candidly dished of her relationship with Kris, which began well before her and Robert's divorce was officially finalized. \"I wanted to get the wedding over with so we could move on with a normal life, even if it's four kids and four step-kids. As normal a life as we can make it.\"\n\nThe former spouses welcomed two daughters together, Kendall, 28, and Kylie Jenner, 26.\n\nUpon marrying Kris, Caitlyn became a stepparent to her and Robert's four children — Kourtney, 44, Kim, 43, Khloé, 39, and Robert Kardashian Jr., 36 — with Kris taking on the stepmom role to her spouse's kids: Burt, 45, Cassandra, 43, Brandon, 42, and Brody, 40.\n\nDespite divorcing, Kris and Robert maintained a friendly bond until he devastatingly died from esophageal cancer in 2003 at age 59."
