        "text": "Lately, Caitlyn Jenner has been revealing more and more what goes on behind the scenes of her famous Kardashian-Jenner family. She has been very vocal about her conviction that former family friend O.J. Simpson was guilty of murdering Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman, and she’s also recently admitted that she doesn’t have much of a relationship with ex-wife Kris Jenner anymore.\n\nNow, in a new episode of the documentary series “House of Kardashian,” the former California gubernatorial candidate spills the beans on her relationship with Kris Jenner’s ex-husband, the late Robert Kardashian Sr, and how she managed to convince O.J. Simpson’s high-powered attorney to finalize his divorce from Kris.\n\n&amp;amp;nbsp;\n\nThe former athlete, who won gold in the decathlon at the 1976 Montreal Olympics, recalled the time in 1991 when she reached out to Robert Sr to end the acrimonious divorce proceedings instigated after Kris had an affair with another man.\n\n\"She was having a rough time with Robert in the divorce when I came into the picture,\" Caitlyn says in the docuseries. \"He was doing everything to kind of make her life miserable. I saw what was going on from the outside and just said, 'This is ridiculous.' So, I called Robert up and said, 'Hey, let's go to dinner.'\"\n\nCaitlyn continued, \"We met on Hamburger Hamlet on Sunset Boulevard, just the two of us in a booth in the back,\"\n\nLet’s just take a moment to picture Caitlyn and Robert Sr having a cheese burger combo with onion rings in a restaurant booth. Got that image in your head? Okay, continuing…\n\n\"And I basically said to him Kris is moving on,” Caitlin revealed. “Sorry, but she's moving on. I said, 'I can take over from here. So, let's just make this final signing of the papers as simple as possible.' And he did.\"\n\n\"We had been together five months and having a wonderful time,\" Caitlyn added about his initial love affair with Kris. \"I wanted to get the wedding over with so we could move on with a normal life, even if it's four kids and four step-kids. As normal a life as we can make it.\"\n\nBefore marrying Kris, Caitlyn had four children from previous marriages (Burt, Cassandra, Brandon, and Brody Jenner), while Kris had Kourtney, Kimberly, Khloé, and Robert Jr. Together, Kris and Caitlyn share Kendall and Kylie Jenner.\n\nKris has recently spoken about her divorce from Robert Sr in an episode of “The Kardashians” where she told daughter Khloé, \"He was such a great husband and such a great dad, and I think that I fell into a situation where I thought that the grass was greener somewhere else and I made a huge mistake.”\n\n“That’s my life’s biggest regret,\" she added.\n\nLater in the same episode, Kris admitted, “When I got divorced, Robert and I became best friends. We talked on the phone all day long, helped each other through things all the time, and I did have regrets,\" she detailed. \"I thought, Wow, what I was thinking?”\n\nKris and Robert Sr were married from 1978 to 1991. Kris then married Caitlyn Jenner after 5 months of dating, and only one month after her divorce from Robert was finalized in 1991. They were married until 2013 when Caitlyn revealed she was transgender.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nDuring the infamous O.J. Simpson criminal trial, Kris and Caitlyn Jenner famously sat in the courtroom on the side of Nicole Brown and Ron Goldman’s family, rather than choosing to support ex-husband and Simpson attorney Robert Sr, while daughters Kourtney and Kimberly sat behind their father.\n\nRobert Sr died in 2003 after a battle with esophageal cancer, something which Caitlyn also touches on during “House of Kardashian.”\n\n“He was really hurting,\" she recalled of Robert Sr’s last days, \"and I said to him, 'Hey, remember if I was in your position, my only worry would be for my kids. That the kids are gonna get through this. I just want you to know that I will always be there for the kids.' And he says, 'Oh, you didn't have to say that. I knew you would.' And a week later he died.\"\n\n“House of Kardashian” is streaming on Peacock and also Sky in the UK."
