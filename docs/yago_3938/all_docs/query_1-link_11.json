        "text": "Kris Jenner and Corey Gamble‘s low-key romance has continued to grow since they first went public with their relationship.\n\nIn 2014, Jenner and Gamble sparked dating rumors after they met in Ibiza during a party thrown by Kim Kardashian‘s then-husband, Kanye West. Following the outing, the couple continued to be photographed spending time together.\n\nJenner and Gamble later took a major step in their relationship when he appeared on Keeping Up With the Kardashians in March 2015. Amid their growing connection, the momager revealed that she and Gamble didn’t have plans to tie the knot, adding that she didn’t want to rush things after her previous divorces. (Kris was married to late husband Robert Kardashian from 1978 to 1991 and ex Caitlyn Jenner from 1991 to 2015).\n\n“You know, you never say never, but I often say it’s just not what I think I need to do again based on my past,” she explained of getting married on the “Divorce Sucks with Laura Wasser” podcast in September 2018. “I’m in a really great relationship right now, and I’m happy and I don’t want to mess that up.”\n\nScroll down to relive Kris and Gamble’s romance:"
