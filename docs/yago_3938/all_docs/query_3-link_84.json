        "text": "In a candid moment on an episode of \"The Kardashians,\" Kris Jenner, aged 67, revealed that her life's biggest regret is cheating on her late husband, Robert Kardashian Sr., with who is now Caitlyn Jenner.\n\nThe conversation arose when Kris and her daughter, Khloe Kardashian, discussed Khloe's ex, Tristan Thompson, and his role in her life.\n\nKhloe asked her mother about her mindset when she cheated on her father, given that they had four children and a family at the time. Kris admitted that her youth and naivety played a part in her actions, as she didn't fully grasp the consequences.\n\nRegretting cheating on him\n\nKhloe probed further, questioning what Robert Kardashian Sr. might have lacked that led Kris to seek companionship elsewhere.\n\n\"I don't know because he was such a great husband and such a great dad, and I think that I fell into a situation where I thought that the grass was greener somewhere else, and I made a huge mistake. That's my life's biggest regret,\" Kris noted.\n\n\"When I got divorced, Robert and I became best friends. We talked on phone all day long, helped each other through things all the time, and I did have regrets."
