        "text": "\"And then he said he went to your dad's grave and asked your dad and I just lost it,\" she continues, audibly becoming emotional.\n\nThe Kardashian patriarch Robert Kardashian Sr. died in 2003 less than two months after being diagnosed with esophageal cancer. He was 59 years old. Robert became a well-known public figure because he was one of the lawyers on OJ Simpson's defense team when the former NFL player was on trial for ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson's murder.\n\nKim resists getting too emotional about Barker's gesture on the episode, asking her mom, \"Why are you doing this to me? Like, I really have to work, I can't ruin my makeup.\"\n\nJenner apologizes, telling her daughter she's just \"happy\" but adds, \"I wish your dad was here to see it.\"\n\nRelated stories\n\nBarker and Kardashian met in 2006 and maintained a friendship for years until early 2021 when they confirmed they were dating.\n\nThe Blink-182 drummer proposed to the Poosh founder on October 17, 2021. He tells Jenner and Khloé during a phone call taped for \"The Kardashians\" that it's the anniversary of the day the couple first \"hung out.\"\n\nA post shared by Kourtney ❤️ (@kourtneykardash)\n\nThey got married in Las Vegas at the One Love Wedding Chapel on April 4, 2022, hours after attending the Grammys together.\n\nKardashian later confirmed on Instagram that the April ceremony was not legally binding.\n\n\"Once upon a time in a land far, far away (Las Vegas) at 2am, after an epic night and a little tequila, a queen and her handsome king ventured out to the only open chapel with an Elvis and got married (with no license),\" she captioned a post on April 6, adding that \"practice makes perfect.\"\n\nKardashian and Barker's attempts to get pregnant via fertility treatments are currently being chronicled on \"The Kardashians.\"\n\nNew episodes of \"The Kardashians\" air Thursdays on Hulu."
