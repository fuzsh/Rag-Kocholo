        "text": "O.J. Simpson was once considered Kris Jenner's \"best friend\" alongside his late wife, Nicole Brown Simpson\n\nThe Kardashian family has a long history with O.J. Simpson, and it started long before his double murder trial.\n\nThe former athlete, who died at age 76 on April 10, became best friends with famed attorney Robert Kardashian Sr. after the pair met in college. Through marriage, Robert Sr.'s eventual ex-wife Kris Jenner also became one of O.J.’s \"best friends\" — she previously told PEOPLE — as well as the best friend of his then-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson. The Kardashian kids even referred to them as \"Auntie\" and \"Uncle\" at the height of the family's friendship.\n\nThat relationship didn’t last forever, though — at least not for Jenner. When O.J. was accused of murdering Nicole and friend Ronald Goldman, Jenner took the side of her deceased friend. Meanwhile, Jenner’s husband Robert Sr. went on to represent Simpson in his double murder trial.\n\nRelated: 'KUWTK:' Kris Jenner Cries Over 'Tasteless and Disgusting' Rumors of Affair with O.J. Simpson\n\n\"Right before the trial started, Robert sat down and wrote us a handwritten letter and just said, 'Look, I know you don't agree with what is going down here, but this is what I have to do for my friend,'\" Jenner said while appearing on a 2009 episode of Dr. Phil. \"He believed in what he was doing and he was asking us for his support.\"\n\nThe murder trial seemingly split the Kardashian-Jenner family, with Jenner even sitting on Nicole’s side of the courtroom while her husband served for the defense. O.J. was acquitted of the charges, though he was found liable for the deaths and paid out millions to the victims' families.\n\nKim Kardashian — who is now pursuing her own law career — remembered taking her father’s side during the trial, while mom Jenner wrote in her 2011 memoir Kris Jenner ... and All Things Kardashian that Nicole had detailed years of physical abuse by O.J. to Jenner so she could act as a “witness” if needed in the future.\n\nRelated: O.J. Simpson Dead at 76 From Cancer, Family Announces\n\n\"We just always thought my dad was the smartest person in the world, and he really believed in his friend,” Kim told Rolling Stone in 2015.\n\nThough O.J. was acquitted of the double murder, he spent nine years in prison starting in 2008 after he was charged with armed robbery and kidnapping. He was released on parole in 2017 after the minimum time served.\n\nThe relationship between the Kardashian family and O.J. dissolved following the trial and Robert Sr.’s death, but their names have remained intertwined in the media. Jenner previously shot down rumors that she had an affair with O.J. Some rumors went so far as to allege he’s Khloé Kardashian’s true father.\n\n“They printed a story that I was sleeping with O.J.,” Jenner said on a previous episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians. “That f---ing piece of s---. It’s really kind of pathetic that when rumors get started the media gives it life and breath and on the anniversary of Nicole’s death. It’s so tasteless and disgusting.”\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nO.J. died of cancer, his family confirmed in a statement on X April 11.\n\n\"On April 10th, our father, Orenthal James Simpson, succumbed to his battle with cancer. He was surrounded by his children and grandchildren,\" the family's statement read. \"During this time of transition, his family asks that you please respect their wishes for privacy and grace.\"\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
