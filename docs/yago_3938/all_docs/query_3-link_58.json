        "text": "Robert Kardashian's death shocked the world when the famous lawyer died just months after his cancer diagnosis in 2003.\n\nThe businessman and father of celebrity siblings Kim, Kourtney, Khloe and Rob was most famous for representing O.J Simpson, following the highly televised 1995 murder trial.\n\nLike their father, the Kardashian children have since become become successful business owners of their own, as well as world famous celebrities following their popular reality TV series.\n\nREAD NEXT: Kim Kardashian lifts lid on type of guy she wants to date after Pete Davidson split\n\nOn the 19th anniversary of his death, Daily Star takes a closer look inside the life of Robert Kardashian.\n\nLife away from law\n\nAmerican attorney Robert Kardashian is most famous for his legal work.\n\nHowever, he was also a successful businessman and founded the trade publication Radio & Records in 1973, before reportedly selling the business for a huge profit in 1979.\n\nRobert was also instrumental in suggesting that music should be played in-between films in the cinema, and launched a company called Movie Tunes.\n\nThat's not all, as he was also the President of a music video business called Concert Cinema, as well as becoming President of a frozen yoghurt company called Juice Inc.\n\nIt's no surprise then that his famous children Kim, Khloe, Kourtney and Rob are all successful business owners, following in the footsteps of parents Robert and Kris Jenner.\n\nAt the time of his death in 2003, Robert was also reported to have had an estimated net worth of £30m from his legal work and business ventures.\n\nPriscilla Presley romance and Kris Jenner divorce\n\nRobert's surname has become one of the most famous in the world, following the rise to fame of his children Kim, Kourtney, Khloe and Rob.\n\nThe children are known from their highly popular reality TV series Keeping Up With The Kardashians between 2007 to 2021, as well as their newly launched The Kardashians show on streaming service Disney+.\n\nTheir mother and Robert's ex-wife Kris Jenner also features in the series, and has become known as their \"mum-ager\"\n\nHowever, a few years before he met Kris, Robert is reported to have dated Elvis' ex-wife Priscilla Presley in the mid seventies.\n\nRobert later married Kris in 1978, and welcomed their four children during that time, but divorced more than 13 years later in 1991.\n\nSpeaking to The Wall Street Journal Magazine, Kris later revealed that she had \"never paid a bill\" during her marriage to Robert, and the moment that was a turning point for her, following the divorce.\n\n\"One da my friend Shelli Azoff said to me when I was going through my divorce [from Robert], 'How much is your gardener?'\n\nAnd I said, 'I don't know.' And she said, 'You don't know?'\n\nThat was the turning point for me: I was embarrassed that I didn't know.\"\n\nOf course, Kris is now one of the world's most successful business people and has managed all six of her children's careers, adding: \"I woke up one day to responsibilities that I hadn't had the day before. And I needed to figure it out.\n\n\"And the good news is, I pay attention...I'm a quick study and I knew I had to get it together.\"\n\nFollowing their divorce, Robert began dating Denice Shakarian Halicki, with the couple later becoming engaged.
