        "text": "Caitlyn Jenner is said to have convinced Robert Kardashian to divorce Kris Jenner, just one month before they ended up tying the knot at a friend's house in Bel Air, Los Angeles.\n\nIn the new Peacock documentary titled House of Kardashian, 74-year-old New York-born Caitlyn recalled: \"She [Kris] was having a rough time with Robert in the divorce when I came into the picture. He was doing everything to kind of make her life miserable.\n\n\"I saw what was going on from the outside and just said, 'This is ridiculous.' So, I called Robert up and said, 'Hey, let's go to dinner.' We met on Hamburger Hamlet on Sunset Boulevard, just the two of us in a booth in the back.\"\n\nFor all the latest on news, politics, sports, and showbiz from the USA, go to The Mirror US.\n\nREAD MORE: Inside Caitlyn Jenner's explosive Kardashian comments which led to family estrangement\n\nShe went on: \"And I basically said to him Kris is moving on. Sorry, but she's moving on. I said, 'I can take over from here. So, let's just make this final signing of the papers as simple as possible.' And he did.\"\n\nJust one month after Kris' divorce from Robert was finalised, she and Caitlyn got married. Getting hitched in 1991, the couple would go on to spend more than two decades in wedded bliss before separating.\n\nElsewhere in the new documentary, Caitlyn added: \"We had been together five months and having a wonderful time. I wanted to get the wedding over with so we could move on with a normal life, even if it's four kids and four step-kids. As normal a life as we can make it.\"\n\nKris married Robert in 1978, with their divorce getting finalised in 1991. Although the couple parted ways, following Kris' infidelity, they remained in each other's lives for the sake of their kids Kourtney, Kim, Khloe, and Rob.\n\nCaitlyn also had kids Burt Jenner, Cassandra Jenner, Brandon Jenner and Brody Jenner from previous marriages. And then Kris and Caitlyn welcomed Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner together after their marriage."
