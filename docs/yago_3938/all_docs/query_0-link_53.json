        "text": "The Kardashians and Jenners seem to dominate the airwaves with their antics, whether on their reality shows like Keeping Up With the Kardashians or their social media accounts. But maybe it’s just because there’s so many of them.\n\nMomager Kris Jenner has had a lot of kids, and they’ve gone on to have kids, too. And a high percentage of them seem to have a talent for business and entertainment, with the main group of sisters going on to star in yet another hit show, The Kardashians, on Hulu. Though they’re popular, even fans can get confused about who is related to whom and how.\n\nSo enjoy: we’ve got the Kardashian family tree, explained.\n\nKris Jenner and Robert Kardashian\n\nThe family matriarch, Kris Jenner, married her first husband, Robert Kardashian, in 1978. Then, she was known as Kris Houghton. Robert was a notorious defense attorney and the lawyer for O.J. Simpson during his murder trial in 1995. They ultimately divorced in 1991, and Robert passed in 2003 from cancer.\n\nKris and Rob had four children: Kourtney, Kim, Khloé, and Robert Kardashian Jr.\n\nKris Jenner and Caitlyn Jenner\n\nKris remarried in 1991 to Olympic gold medalist Caitlyn Jenner. Caitlyn has children from her two previous marriages: Brandon and Brody with Linda Thompson and Cassandra and Burt with Chrystie Crownover. She and Kris divorced in 2005.\n\nThey had two children: Kendall and Kylie Jenner.\n\nKourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick\n\nKourtney dated ex-boyfriend Scott Disick on-and-off for 10 years before ultimately splitting up for good in 2015.\n\nIn that time they had three children: Mason, born in December 2009; Penelope, born in July 2012; and Reign, born in December 2014.\n\nKourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker\n\nKourtney began dating Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker in 2021, and they were married a year later. Barker has three children, Alabama and Landon Barker, and stepdaughter Atiana De La Hoya, all with ex-wife Shanna Moakler.\n\nIn November 2023, Kourtney and Travis welcomed their first child together, a son named Rocky Thirteen Barker.\n\nKim Kardashian and Kanye West\n\nKim Kardashian was married twice, to Damon Thomas and Kris Humphries, before settling down with rapper Kanye West. They divorced in 2022.\n\nThe former couple share four children: North, born in June 2013; Saint, born in December 2015; Chicago, born in January 2018; and Psalm, born in May 2019.\n\nRob Kardashian Jr. and Blac Chyna\n\nRob Kardashian and Blac Chyna began dating in January 2016 and announced an engagement only three months later. The next year was fairly up-and-down, but they had a brief reality show chronicling it called Rob & Chyna. They used the show to announce a pregnancy but were split up by 2017. Chyna also shares a child with rapper Tyga, a little boy named Cairo. Tyga is additionally the ex-boyfriend of Kylie Jenner.\n\nRob and Chyna’s daughter, Dream Kardashian, was born in November 2016.\n\nKhloé Kardashian and Tristan Thompson\n\nKhloé Kardashian and NBA star Tristan Thompson began dating in 2016. Their relationship was riddled with infidelity scandals on the side of Thompson. The athlete has two children aside from the ones he shares with Khloé, Prince Oliver Thompson with his ex, Jordan Craig, and Theo, with Maralee Nichols. Thompson fathered Theo while he and Khloé were still in a relationship, leading to their final breakup. However, it was revealed that the former couple were already expecting a child via surrogate when news of Theo’s paternity broke.\n\nKhloé and Thompson share their daughter True, born in April 2018, and Tatum, born via surrogate in 2022.\n\nKylie Jenner and Travis Scott\n\nKylie Jenner and rapper Travis Scott dated off-and-on as well, starting in 2017. They split in late 2022.\n\nTheir daughter, Stormi, was born in February 2018 and their son, Aire, in February 2022. They initially announced their son’s name as “Wolf” before changing it a few months later.\n\nKendall Jenner"
