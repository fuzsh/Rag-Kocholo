        "text": "L: Robert Kardashian Sr., R: Kris Jenner\n\nKris Jenner doesn't want her daughters to make the same mistakes she once did.\n\nThe KarJenner matriarch is opening up about cheating on her first husband, Robert Kardashian Sr., in the Oct. 26 episode of the family's reality series, as her 39-year-old daughter Khloé Kardashian tries to get into the mindset of a cheater following her ex's infidelity.\n\nThe Good American founder asked her mom, now 67, what her own \"mindset\" was when she stepped out on her father with Todd Waterman, whom she met in 1990 after 12 years of marriage. She and her husband divorced the next year.\n\n“When you did that with my dad, and you had four kids and you had a family?\" she asked, acknowledging that Kris was \"really young\" at the time but still searching for reason.\n\nKris agreed that she was “really young and dumb,” a factor that she believes definitely \"played into\" her actions, as she didn't \"really understand the consequences of [her] actions” at that age.\n\n“But what was my dad not doing that made you want to look elsewhere?” Khloé prompted.\n\nAt the end of the day, Kris isn't quite sure. \"...he was such a great husband and such a great dad, and I think that I fell into a situation where I thought that the grass was greener somewhere else,\" she said, calling that \"a huge mistake.” Not only a mistake, but her \"life’s biggest regret.”\n\n>>> Sign up for Parade's Trending News newsletter and we'll keep you in the know on the viral pop culture moments and celebrity news everyone is talking about <<<\n\nShe told Khloé that she wasn't \"proud\" of her actions, but that \"everything happens for a reason.\" After all, if she hadn't started seeing Caitlyn Jenner just a few months after her divorce was finalized in 1991, who came out as a trans woman in 2015, the family never would have welcomed their two youngest daughters and sisters, Kendall and Kylie.\n\nThough she didn't explain her reasoning for opening up directly to her daughter, she did further address her divorce in a confessional in the same episode, expressing hope that she wouldn't cut Tristan Thompson, who fathered her two children, off completely.\n\n“When I got divorced, Robert and I became best friends,\" she recalled. \"We talked on the phone all day long, helped each other through things all the time, and I did have regrets.” The shift in their relationship left her wondering, \"Wow, what I was thinking?\" so she wants Khloé \"to be really careful when she makes these decisions and she has to let somebody go.”\n\nKris and Caitlyn divorced in 2014, and today, the two aren't on such great terms, mostly communicating through their managers according to the former Olympian.\n\nNext: Caitlyn Jenner Shares 'Sad' Update in Relationship With Ex Kris\n\nA previous version of this article stated that Kris had an affair with Caitlyn Jenner. This has been corrected."
