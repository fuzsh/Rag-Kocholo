        "text": "How did Robert Kardashian make his money?\n\nWay back in 1973, Robert was a co-founder of the trade publication Radio & Records, which he and his partners sold for a huge profit a few years later in 1979. He was also behind the idea of playing music between films in theatres. He eventually developed the concept into a business, starting a new company called Movie Tunes.\n\nEven though he was famous for his law career, the original Kardashian already had a taste for showbiz and the fortune it brings.\n\nKris Jenner wasn’t his only wife\n\nRobert was famously married to Kris Jenner, with whom he had four children – Kim, Khloé, Kourtney and Rob. But sadly, things didn’t last.\n\n“I got married when I was very, very young. I met Robert when I was 18 years old,” Jenner told podcast InCharge With DVF. “We dated for four years, got married at 22, sooner or later during my life when I was in my 30s, I had an affair and my biggest regret was the fact that it broke up my family.”\n\nAfter splitting from Kris in 1991, he married Jan Ashley in 1998, but the union ended in an annulment after only 30 days. He then dated Ellen Pierson for three years, and they married six weeks before his death in 2003.\n\nRobert Kardashian’s history with O.J. Simpson\n\nRobert was shoved into the spotlight in the 90s when he served as the defence lawyer to O.J. Simpson during his 1995 murder trial.\n\nHe and Simpson were close friends for many years, having met in the 60s while both attending the University of Southern California.\n\nWhile Simpson played for the USC Trojans, Robert served as the water boy during matches. Their friendship quickly blossomed, and Simpson eventually acted as best man at Robert’s wedding to Kris.\n\nHowever, as successful as Robert was in the case, he later revealed in 1996 during an interview with Barbara Walters that he had doubts about his friend’s innocence. Afterwards, the pair were no longer on speaking terms.\n\nHe died of cancer before his family found fame\n\nIn 2003, Robert was diagnosed with esophageal cancer and passed away only two months later on September 30 at the age of 59. His sudden death came as a huge shock to his family, as he didn’t smoke or drink and there was no history of cancer on his side of the family.\n\n“It was so surreal, the knowledge he had cancer was one thing, but to think it would actually take his life, I never in a million years thought that would happen to him,” Kris revealed in a 2014 interview.\n\nHe had a good relationship with Caitlyn Jenner\n\nWhen Robert’s cancer was found to be terminal, he relied on his ex-wife’s new spouse Caitlyn to take care of his children, and the two formed an unlikely bond.\n\nCaitlyn promised Kardashian that she would “always take care” of Kourtney, Kim, Khloé and Rob when he was no longer around, according to British media.\n\nKanye West bought Kim Kardashian a hologram of Robert\n\nIn 2021, Kim was surprised by a hologram of her father from her then husband, Kanye West.\n\nSharing a video of the hologram on social media, Kim wrote, “For my birthday, Kanye got me the most thoughtful gift of a lifetime. A special surprise from heaven. A hologram of my dad. It is so lifelike! We watched it over and over, filled with emotion.”\n\nThe Kardashians still celebrate their dad’s life every chance they get\n\nThe Kardashians have made no secret of how much they miss their beloved father. Earlier this year, Kim celebrated what would’ve been her dad’s 77th birthday with emotional messages on her social media channels.\n\n“Happy Birthday Dad! I celebrate you every single day but today even more,” Kim wrote on Instagram in February. “So much to tell you! I called your mobile phone number just wondering if anyone would pick up after all these years. I actually can’t believe I remembered it.”\n\n“Please come visit me in a dream soon,” she continued.\n\nWhatever roller coaster Kim and her family has been on, we’re sure he’d be immensely proud."
