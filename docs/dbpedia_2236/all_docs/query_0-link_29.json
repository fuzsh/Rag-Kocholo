        "text": "COPASI is an open source software application for simulation and analysis of biochemical networks. It is developed jointly by the groups of Pedro Mendes (UConn Health), Ursula Kummer, Sven Sahle and Jürgen Pahle (University of Heidelberg, Germany), and Stefan Hoops (University of Virginia). COPASI has gained wide popularity in systems biology modeling, chemistry, and other fields such as epidemiology and ecology. It is used in over 100 publications each year and also in teaching.\n\nCOPASI's current features include time course simulations—both deterministic based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and stochastic, either using the Gillespie algorithm and its variants or via stochastic differential equations (SDEs)—, steady state analysis (including stability), parameter scans, metabolic control analysis, elementary flux mode analysis, mass conservation analysis, optimization of arbitrary functions, and parameter estimation (one of its most used features). COPASI can import and export models in the standards SBML, SED-ML, and OMEX. It runs on all popular operating systems as a Graphical User Interface, and it has extensions to be used directly from Python and R programs, a feature which has gaining much interest recently.\n\nTarget Audience: This tutorial is primarily aimed at experimentalists who are newcomers to the computational side of systems biology or experienced modelers who want to explore model analysis with COPASI. Participants are encouraged to bring their own computers."
