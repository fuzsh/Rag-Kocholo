This relation might be used to link a complex to the description of its components. hasVersion has version The subject of the referenced resource is a version or an instance of the subject represented by the model component. is is The subject represented by the model component is the subject of the referenced resource. This relation might be used to link a reaction to its exact counterpart in KEGG or Reactome for instance. isDescribedBy reference The subject represented by the model component is described by the referenced resource. This relation should be used for instance to link a species or a parameter to the literature that describes the concentration of the species or the value of the parameter. isEncodedBy is encoded by The subject represented by the model component is encoded, directly, or by transitivity, by the subject of the referenced resource. isHomologTo is homolog to The subject represented by the model component is homolog, to the subject of the referenced resource, i.e. they share a common ancestor. isPartOf is part of The subject represented by the model component is a physical or logical part of the subject of the referenced resource.
