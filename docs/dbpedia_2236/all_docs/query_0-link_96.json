The iso should have worked fine though, and so I am wondering who to complain to and where, as the irc for fedora compneuro wasn’t much help.\n\nHi @millerthegorilla ,\n\nI’m one of the Neuro-sig folks.\n\nthe fedora-release-compneuro package doesn’t really do much—it only updates the identity of the release to comp-neuro. It won’t pull in any packages.\n\nCould you clarify what version of the compneuro iso you downloaded, and what do you mean by “it had no packages at all”? It will include lots of packages, but they’re all mostly non-GUI tools (apart from that, it should be a standard Fedora Workstation install). The list is here:\n\nThere’s a dnf group for “neuron modelling software”. You can install it using dnf groupinstall:\n\nsudo dnf groupinstall \"Neuron Modelling Simulators\"\n\nThese are the packages it contains:\n\n$ sudo dnf groupinfo \"Neuron Modelling Simulators\" Last metadata expiration check: 0:38:00 ago on Mon 29 Aug 2022 19:30:36 BST. Group: Neuron Modelling Simulators Description: This group includes simulators used in modelling of neurons and their networks. Optional Packages: COPASI arbor bionetgen calcium-calculator genesis-simulator moose neuron-devel python3-PyLEMS python3-brian2 python3-lfpy python3-nest python3-netpyne python3-neuron python3-pynn python3-steps smoldyn\n\nThanks for getting back to me, I tried looking for both gui and non-gui programs but nothing, at least not that I could find on the iso. I will download and install again just to be certain.\n\nI have just tried the groupinstall command that you supplied but no packages were pulled in at all. Is there some other command I need to run, also?"
