        "meta_description": "Author summary Acrylic acid is an economically important chemical compound due to its high market value. Nevertheless, the majority of acrylic acid consumed worldwide its produced from petroleum derivatives by a purely chemical process, which is not only expensive, but it also contributes towards environment deterioration. Hence, justifying the current need for sustainable novel production methods that allow higher profit margins. Ideally, to minimise production cost, the pathway should consist in the direct bio-based production from microbial feedstocks, such as Escherichia coli, but the current yields achieved are still too low to compete with conventional method. In this work, even though the glycerol pathway presented higher yields, we identified the malonyl-CoA route, when using glucose as carbon source, as having the most potential for industrial-scale production, since it is cheaper to implement. Furthermore, we also identified potential optimisation targets for all the tested pathways, that can help the bio-based method to compete with the conventional process.",

        "text": "Time course simulations\n\nRegarding the production of 3-HP in the glycerol pathway, simulations with models set to use either glucose (Glu-Gly) or glycerol as carbon source (Gly-Gly), predicted, the production of 0.19 g/L (after three hours), and 8.30 g/L (after six-hours), respectively (Fig 2). Whereas, concerning the production of AA, the Glu-Gly and Gly-Gly models predicted 0.16 g/L and 6.71 g/L, respectively (Fig 3). From these results, glycerol seems to be associated with higher yields, which is in good agreement with the available literature [1]. Moreover, regarding the production of AA, the intracellular concentration of 3-HP showed that there is no accumulation (Fig 3), meaning that most 3-HP is converted into AA. These results are most likely associated with the use of excessive enzyme concentration to calculate the Vmax for the heterologous pathway, which led to a state in which the main limiting factor in the synthesis of AA was the CCM’s flux distribution. However, this is not the case in vivo, as the studies that tested the full bio-based pathway show that 3-HP and other intermediates indeed accumulate during this process [1,2].\n\n(A) Glucose (GLCx) consumption and variation of extracellular 3-HP (3-HPx) over time; (B) Glycerol (GLYx) consumption and variation of 3-HPx over time.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008704.g002\n\n(A) Glucose (GLC) consumption and variation of extracellular AA (AAx) over time; (B) Variation of 3-hydroxypropionate (3-HP) concentration over time when using Glucose as carbon source; (C) Glycerol (GLYx) consumption and variation of extracellular AAx over time; (D) Variation of 3-HP concentration over time when using Glycerol as carbon source.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008704.g003\n\nWhen comparing the predictions of the glycerol pathway models (Table 1), it is possible to observe that the predicted 3-HP concentration, with the Gly-Gly model, is slightly different from literature reports. This difference slightly increases when increasing the initial concentration of carbon. For instance, for 40 g/L of glycerol, the predicted 3-HP production is about two times higher. Nevertheless, the model representing the 3-HP production from glycerol exhibits promising results.\n\nThe scenario with the Glu-Gly model is considerably distinct, as a ten-fold lower concentration of 3-HP was predicted. This difference might be associated with the production of glycerol, more specifically, in the flux through G3pD and G3pP, as according to Chu et al. (2015) [1] their strain is able to accumulate more glycerol (2.5 g/L) than this model is able to produce (0.34 g/L), for the same amount of glucose. Unfortunately, such study, which presented the highest AA concentration (0.12 g/L) reported thus far, did not disclose the amount of glucose used to obtain such production. Hence, it was not possible to directly compare the predicted titer from the Glu-Gly model.\n\nWhen performing simulations using glucose concentrations of 10 g/L and 20 g/L, the model predicts the production of 0.16 g/L and 0.32 g/L of AA, respectively. These results show that the AA production predicted by our model would be in good agreement with the results reported by Chu et al. (2015) [1], if 10 g/L of glucose had been used for the carbon source. However, the model does not accumulate any intermediary compounds of the heterologous pathway; thus, most 3-HP is converted into AA, which does not correctly represent the in vivo results. Consequently, when assessing the results to the work of Tong et al. (2016) [2] that tested the production of AA in E. coli, the model fails to predict the AA yield accurately, as expected.\n\nRegarding the malonyl-CoA pathway, the model set to use glucose as carbon source (Glu-Mcoa) predicted a titer of 1.99 g/L of 3-HP, while the malonyl-CoA model set to use glycerol as carbon source (Gly-Mcoa) predicted 1.99 g/L of 3-HP (Fig 4). Moreover, the Glu-Mcoa and Gly-Mcoa models predicted the production of 1.62 g/L and 0.17 g/L of AA, respectively (Fig 5). The behaviour analysis of the Gly-Mcoa model showed a considerable intracellular accumulation of dihydroxyacetone (Fig 4C). Hence, most carbon does not reach the CCM, and therefore these results should not be considered as it is not possible to determine the best carbon source to produce AA. Although literature reports suggest a consensus towards the use of glucose as a carbon source, it should be noted that no work using glycerol was found. Thus, glycerol should not be excluded as a promising alternative carbon source.\n\n(A) Glucose (GLCx) consumption and variation of extracellular 3-HP (3-HPx) over time; (B) Glycerol (GLYx) consumption and variation of 3-HPx over time; (C) Variation of intracellular dihydroxyacetone (DHA) concentration over time when using Glycerol.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008704.g004\n\n(A) Glucose (GLC) consumption and variation of extracellular AA (AAx) over time; (B) Variation of 3-hydroxypropionate (3-HP) concentration over time when using Glucose as carbon source; (C) Glycerol (GLYx) consumption and variation of extracellular AAx over time; (D) Variation of 3-HP concentration over time when using Glycerol as carbon source.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008704.g005\n\nRegarding the Glu-Mcoa models, the 3-HP production predictions are very similar to those found in the literature (Table 2). However, the models failed to predict the production of AA, as Liu and Liu, (2016) [7] reported the accumulation of 3-HP, which was not replicated by the model (Fig 5).\n\nFinally, regarding the β-alanine pathway, as shown in Figs 6 and 7, the β-alanine model set to use glycerol as carbon source (Gly-Ba) predicted the production of 0.041 g/L of 3-HP and 0.033 g/L of AA. The model set to use glucose as a carbon source (Glu-Ba) predicted the production of 0.033 g/L of 3-HP and 0.026 g/L of AA. Again, the models did not predict the accumulation of 3-HP that, although desirable, is not realistic. Although simulation results indicate a slight advantage towards using glycerol as a carbon source, there seems to be a consensus in literature towards using glucose as carbon source, as to the best of our knowledge, no studies using the glycerol pathway have been reported. When compared to previous pathways, both carbon sources produced a considerably lower concentration of AA in this pathway.\n\n(A) Glucose (GLCx) consumption and variation of extracellular 3-HP (3-HPx) over time; (B) Glycerol (GLYx) consumption and variation of 3-HPx over time.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008704.g006\n\n(A) Glucose (GLC) consumption and variation of extracellular AA (AAx) over time; (B) Variation of 3-hydroxypropionate (3-HP) concentration over time when using Glucose as carbon source; (C) Glycerol (GLYx) consumption and variation of extracellular AAx over time; (D)—Variation of 3-HP concentration over time when using Glycerol as carbon source.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008704.g007\n\nThe β-alanine pathway is the least studied, with very few reports, which might be associated with the fact that such studies reported significantly lower yields, when compared with the previous pathways [18]. Indeed, only one study was found concerning 3-HP synthesis in E. coli using batch cultures [11], while studies in which AA is produced through this route are yet to be published. The work of Ko et al. (2020) details the production of acrylic acid using β-alanine as intermediate; however, these authors found a novel pathway that bypassed the production of 3-HP. Thus, these results were not considered in the current study [19]. Nonetheless, the β-alanine model predictions showed promising 3-HP yields, as the projected concentration was close to the results obtained in vivo by Song et al. (2016) [11] (Table 3).\n\nWhen comparing the three bio-based routes, the results suggest, as supported by literature [1,18], that the glycerol pathway leads to the highest yields, when combined with the use of glycerol as a carbon source. However, a relevant caveat must be recalled. This pathway includes a reaction that relies on the presence of vitamin B12, which represents a significant economic disadvantage at an industrial-scale production [8,9]. Hence, to make this route economically viable, either the yield must be significantly improved to overcome the cost of the vitamin supplementation, or a cheaper path to produce B12 must be found. Therefore, despite producing less AA, it seems to be beneficial to use the malonyl-CoA route, as it provided the second-highest yield and does not require vitamin supplementation [17,18,20]. Nevertheless, the pathway should still be optimised to obtain yields that could compete with the existing methods at an industrial-scale production.\n\nOptimisation strategies\n\nIdeally, all models capable of producing AA should have been optimised. However, as mentioned before, the Gly-Mcoa model presented issues with dihydroxyacetone accumulation, not being further used in this work. Additionally, the Gly-Gly and Gly-Ba models proved to be unstable when performing the metabolic control analysis (MCA), preventing the flux control coefficient (FCC) ascertainment, due to the lack of a steady-state. Henceforth, only the models designed to use glucose as a carbon source (Glu-Gly, Glu-Mcoa, Glu-Ba) were optimised.\n\nStarting with the glycerol model, the MCA showed that the enzyme with the highest FCC, and thus a more significant influence on AA production, was the G3pD (Fig 8A), which is responsible for converting dihydroxyacetone phosphate into glycerol-3-phosphate. The reaction catalysed by this enzyme is a potential bottleneck in the pathway, and thus a target for overexpression. To the best of our knowledge, there are no evidences in literature regarding the use of this reaction as a target for optimisation, as this pathway is mainly used to produce 3-HP or AA from glycerol. Moreover, only Chu et al. (2015) [1] used glucose for AA production; however, they focused their optimisation strategies on limiting the toxicity of intermediary compounds.\n\n(A) Results for the glycerol pathway. According to the coefficients, the reaction with the most impact is the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3pD), which due to its positive FCC is a potential target for overexpression; (B) Results for the malonyl-CoA pathway. The results showed that the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (AccC) is a potential bottleneck in the pathway due to the positive FCC; hence, another target for overexpression; (C) Results for the β-alanine pathway. The highest FCC was for the aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT) which appears to be an ideal target for an overexpression.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008704.g008\n\nTherefore, using COPASI’s optimisation task, Mutant Glu-Gly 1 was created. This mutant included an in silico overexpression of the selected enzyme, in which the Vmax of the enzyme was set to 1.392 mM/s, representing a nearly 45-fold increase that resulted in the production of 3.11 g/L of AA (Fig 9A). A subsequent MCA was performed on Mutant Glu_Gly 1, aiming at further optimising the AA production yields. However, the model could not reach a steady-state; hence, the FCCs were not available, thus terminating the optimisation of this model.\n\n(A) AA production using glycerol pathway. Mutant 0 represents the model with the heterologous pathway, and Mutant 1 the same model with a 45-fold increase in the Vmax of the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3pD) reaction; (B) AA production using malonyl-CoA pathway. Mutant 0 represents the model with the heterologous pathway, and Mutant 1 the same model with a 2.5-fold increase in the Vmax of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (AccC); (C) AA production for the β-alanine pathway. Mutant 0 represents the model with the heterologous pathway, and Mutant 1 the same model with a 50-fold increase in the Vmax of the aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT).\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008704.g009\n\nIn the malonyl-CoA pathway model, the FCCs identified one potential overexpression target, the AccC (Fig 8B), which is responsible for the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. Moreover, this is a well-established target for optimisation of the malonyl-CoA pathway [18]. The optimum Vmax for this enzyme was found to be 0.568 mM/s, corresponding to approximately a 2-fold overexpression. Mutant Glu-Mcoa 1 was able to produce a 3.11 g/L of AA, which corresponds to a 1.5-fold higher yield than Mutant Glu-Mcoa 0 (Fig 9B). Unfortunately, once again, a second iteration revealed that the model was unable to reach a steady-state. Thus, it was not possible to identify other potential targets using this methodology.\n\nRegarding the β-alanine pathway, the MCA showed that the model has several reactions affecting the AA yield. However, the reaction with the most significant impact is catalysed by AspAT enzyme (Fig 8C). This reaction allows converting oxaloacetate and L-glutamate into aspartate, which is in turn converted to β-alanine. Moreover, reports from the literature suggest that increasing the bioavailability of aspartate leads to a higher 3-HP production, as in vivo experiments with Saccharomyces cerevisiae and E. coli showed it as viable optimisation strategy [11,20]. Moreover, the resulting coefficient was positive, which indicates that it is a potential bottleneck impairing the downstream flux towards the heterologous pathway; thus, the optimisation goal was to overexpress this enzyme. COPASI estimated a 50-fold overexpression for maximising the production yields, resulting in a Vmax of 127.4869 mM/s. It is worth noting that, even though this value is significantly higher than what is biologically feasible, the goal of the optimisation was to identify potential targets and not meticulously predict the final Vmax value. With this change, the predicted AA production was 0.97 g/L, which corresponds to a 28-fold increase (Fig 9C). A subsequent MCA revealed that the main limiting factor to AA production in Mutant Glu-Ba 1 was the amount of glucose provided to the model; hence the optimisation was terminated with only one target identified. Similarly, the AspC gene, which is responsible for the production of β-alanine, can also be considered as a limiting factor for pathway flux, thus becoming a target for optimisation, as the Vmax was increased for the β-alanine model to work correctly (S1 Appendix, section 1.2.1).\n\nThe goal of these optimisations was to provide guidelines that can be later implemented in vivo and not predict the AA production accurately. Nonetheless, the final concentrations obtained with the new mutants were compared with previous results. As shown in Table 4, the same concentration of AA (3.11 g/L) was produced by the glycerol and malonyl-CoA pathways. The β-alanine pathway also showed a substantial yield increase (0.97 g/L). However, the value is still considerably lower than the obtained with remaining pathways. It is important to notice that the four targets suggested by this analysis aim at increasing the bioavailability of the intermediaries (glycerol, malonyl-CoA, or β-alanine). Nevertheless, these models only comprise the CCM. Thus, other strategies to force additional flux towards the heterologous pathway may also prove useful.\n\nKinetic modelling\n\nThe dynamic model developed by Millard et al. (2017) [21] was used as a chassis to insert the heterologous pathways. However, the model did not include the production of glycerol, malonyl-CoA and β-alanine, which are naturally produced in E. coli. Therefore, the first step was to extend the original model to include these metabolites. Subsequently, each heterologous pathway was added separately to compare 3-HP and AA synthesis.\n\nParameter selection.\n\nKinetic equations and their respective parameters were retrieved from the available literature. Databases like BioCyc [22], BRENDA [23], Sabio-RK [24] and eQuilibrator [25] were used to identify the kinetic mechanism of each enzyme and obtain their respective parameters. Furthermore, instead of a single value, the average of all parameters found for each enzyme, excluding outliers, was used to obtain a better representation. A summary of the values considered when calculating the mean value for each reaction is presented in S2 Appendix.\n\nRegarding the parameters required to describe a reaction, the maximal rate (Vmax) is usually not reported in the literature. Unfortunately, this parameter is highly dependent on the specificity of the assay conditions. Hence, the specific activity or the turnover (a.k.a. Kcat) are reported instead. Two distinct methods were used, as a workaround, to estimate values for this parameter. Method 1, adapted from the work of Chassagnole and colleagues [26], was used for reactions belonging to E. coli’s native metabolism. Initially, a steady-state flux distribution is determined for the original kinetic model, using the default settings of the COPASI software [27] steady-state task and not further fitted to the expected behaviour. Then, a genome-scale model of E. coli K-12 MG1655 (in this case iML1515) [28] was used to predict the flux of the new reactions. For this purpose, the common reactions between the kinetic model and the stoichiometric model are constrained to the previously determined flux distribution (±0.01 mM/s). Then, a flux variability analysis [29] was performed to estimate the maximum flux (v) of the desired reaction for the given constraints. Then, by equalising v to the respective enzyme rate law (Vmax × F (X,K)), the following equation is obtained: (1) in which X is a vector of parameters, and K a vector of steady-state concentrations for the metabolites involved in the respective reaction. Furthermore, notice that for newly added metabolites, the steady-state concentration was assumed to be 1 mM. The resulting Vmax values are presented in the S2 Table.\n\nMethod 2 was used for reactions of the heterologous pathways. In this method, the Vmax was estimated assuming that the total concentration of enzyme was in surplus (100 mM), thus calculating this parameter as shown in Eq 2: (2)\n\nEven though an enzyme concentration of 100 mM is beyond what is biologically feasible, this value was selected to avoid creating artificial bottlenecks that would impair this analysis. Furthermore, the authors also tested different concentrations to assess the impact on AA production and the results are presented in S1 Appendix, section 1. and Figs 3 and S6 and S7.\n\nExtension of the Central Carbon Metabolism (CCM).\n\nThe production of glycerol, malonyl-CoA, and β-alanine had to be included in the model to insert the three heterologous pathways (Fig 10). The reactions catalysed by the glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3pD) and glycerol-3-phosphate phosphatase (G3pP) enzymes are required to produce glycerol from dihydroxyacetone phosphate. Considering that this route has to be reversible to use glycerol as a carbon source, reactions catalysed by the glycerol kinase (GlyK), glycerol dehydrogenase (GlyD) and the dihydroxyacetone phosphate transferase (DhaPT) enzymes were included too (Fig 10). As shown in Fig 10, one reaction is required to obtain malonyl-CoA, namely the reaction catalysed by the acetyl-CoA carboxylase (AccC) enzyme. Finally, three reactions were included for the β-alanine pathway. Two of these, promoted by the aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT) and the aspartate carboxylase (AspC) enzymes, are required for the production of β-alanine. A reaction, catalysed by the L-glutamate dehydrogenase (GluD) enzyme, is used to produce glutamate, which is required by the AspAT to produce aspartate (Fig 10) [22,30].\n\nThe reactions depicted by the blue, orange, green and yellow arrows represent, respectively, the glycolysis, pentose-phosphate pathway, tricarboxylic acid cycle and the glyoxylate shunt, which are all present in the original model. The black arrows represent the nine reactions that were added to the model. Finally, red arrows depict the Synth reactions added to account for the presence of the newly added metabolites in other pathways.\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008704.g010\n\nAll reactions and respective stoichiometry are shown below: (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11)\n\nFurthermore, the kinetic law equation and the respective parameters for each of the previously described reactions are presented in Table 5.\n\nAn additional set of pseudo-reactions was included in the model; the Synth reactions (Fig 10). These reactions, inspired by the work of Chassagnole et al. (2002) [26] and Machado et al. (2014) [31], are used to represent the pathways involved in the breakdown of the newly added metabolites. Mass action kinetics was assumed for these reactions and, using the same principle as Method 1, the sum of all fluxes from the reactions that metabolise each metabolite in the stoichiometric model was used to determine the k values for each synth reaction. The resulting k values are available in the S3 Table.\n\nPathways for acrylic acid production.\n\nThe following step was to insert the three heterologous pathways to produce AA separately into the extended CCM model. All pathways encompass two different phases, the production of an intermediary compound, namely 3-HP, and subsequent production of AA (Fig 1).\n\nThe first phase involves two different enzymes in each pathway. Regarding the glycerol pathway, such enzymes are the glycerol dehydratase (GlyDH) and the 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde dehydrogenase (3hpaD). In the malonyl-CoA pathway, the malonyl-CoA reductase (McoaR) enzyme is responsible for the production of malonic semialdehyde (MSA), which is then converted into 3-HP by the malonic semialdehyde reductase (MsaR). Regarding the β-alanine pathway, the β-alanine aminotransferase (BaAT) enzyme promotes the conversion of β-alanine together with α-ketoglutarate into L-glutamate and MSA. The latter is then converted into 3-HP by the MsaR.\n\n(12)(13)(14)(15)(16)\n\nThe final step is to convert the newly formed 3-HP into AA. This process involves the production of 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA (3-HP-CoA) by the 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA synthase (3hpcoaS), the subsequent formation of acrylyl-CoA (AA-CoA) by the 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase (3hpcoaDH), and finally, the production of AA by the acrylyl-CoA thioesterase (AcoaTioE) enzyme, as shown in Fig 1. The stoichiometry of these reactions is likewise shown below, and the respective kinetic parameters presented in Table 6.\n\n(17)(18)(19)\n\nFour models were created for each of the three pathways resulting in a total of twelve distinct models. To be more precise, for each pathway, models to produce 3-HP or AA, from glucose or glycerol as carbon sources, were put forward. All models can be found at the Biomodels database, and the respective ID is available in S1 Table."
