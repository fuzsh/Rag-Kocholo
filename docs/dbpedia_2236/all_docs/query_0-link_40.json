        "text": "COPASI’s presence on social media\n\nFor many years we have operated an account on Twitter/X: @COPASI_software, but we have now stopped using it.\n\nWe have witnessed increasing hate speech and harassment on Twitter/X such that it has become counterproductive to keep a presence in that social media network. We are therefore stopping any activity on that account and have locked it.\n\nFor those interested in following COPASI on social media we operate an account on the Mastodon network: https://fosstodon.org/@copasi. This continues to be a low volume account with posts being mostly announcements of new versions, tutorials and other COPASI related news. As with all Mastodon accounts, they can also be followed with a simple RSS reader (i.e. you don’t need to create an account on Mastodon); simply point your RSS reader to https://fosstodon.org/@copasi.rss.\n\nObviously, we will continue to post all announcements of new versions on this web site and on the user forum."
