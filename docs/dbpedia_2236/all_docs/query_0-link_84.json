        "text": "In general, I like the approach to immediately start trying out things and read up on the theory a bit later. I would suggest you use the resources below:\n\nCopasi Tutorial (and videos) \"is a software application for simulation and analysis of biochemical networks and their dynamics.\"\n\nBioModels Database \"is a repository of peer-reviewed, published, computational models. These mathematical models are primarily from the field of systems biology, but more generally are those of biological interest.\"\n\nNote that Copasi can import SBML, so you can download any model from the database and run/modify it. After that, I would suggest you read up on Mass Action Kinetics or any book that is available in your local library (Recommendations: this and this).\n\nThere is and a relevant and possibly great EMBL-EBI-Wellcome Trust course on April 23-27, 2012. I think it would be a great opportunity for meeting people who are working in this field. Here is the link for the course web site:\n\nhttp://www.wellcome.ac.uk/Education-resources/Courses-and-conferences/Advanced-Courses-and-Scientific-Conferences/Advanced-Courses/WTVM053676.htm\n\nIf you do not want to wait until then, you can also check out some relevant databases/softwares and their tutorials (e.g. KEGG, CellDesigner, Cytoscape, etc.)"
