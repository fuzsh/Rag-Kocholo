        "text": "Pedro Mendes\n\nunread,\n\nto copasi-u...@googlegroups.com\n\nFabio,\n\nthe precision of representation of reals as floating point is far from\n\ntrivial. There are many problems with floating point numbers that,\n\nunfortunately, are mostly only mentioned in Numerical Analysis classes\n\n(sometimes not even that). See the link below for the main issues\n\nhttps://www.codeproject.com/Articles/29637/Five-Tips-for-Floating-Point-Programming\n\nnote that this affects any program, written in any language, that uses\n\nfloating point numbers...\n\nBut even more basic is the fact that solving ODEs (and inverting\n\nmatrices, etc.) is carried out by asymptotic algorithms. These\n\napproximate the solutions iteratively and the numbers that come out can\n\nonly be trusted to a certain limit (usually this is more restrictive\n\nthan the floating point issues mentioned above).\n\nSo when in COPASI you solve ODEs, the algorithm is governed by the\n\nabsolute tolerance and the relative tolerance values. If you have an\n\nabsolute tolerance of 1e-12 (the default in COPASI) you should expect\n\nthat values smaller than this are not reliable and are essentially the\n\nsame as zero (ie if you see a concentrations of 1e-23 or -1e-16, etc.\n\nthese are basically the same as 0).\n\nIn the steady state analysis the steady state (which should have fluxes\n\nof 0), the tolerance also determines the error in the solution. So if\n\nyour tolerance is 1e-9 you should not expect much rates below this value\n\nto be meaningful.\n\nThis all means that at some point you cannot rely on all of the digits\n\nof solutions. Personally I don't trust much more than 5 or 6 significant\n\ndigits.\n\n\n\n> --\n\n> You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google\n\n> Groups \"COPASI User Forum\" group.\n\n> To unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send\n\n> an email to copasi-user-fo...@googlegroups.com\n\n> <mailto:copasi-user-fo...@googlegroups.com>.\n\n> To post to this group, send email to copasi-u...@googlegroups.com\n\n> <mailto:copasi-u...@googlegroups.com>.\n\n> To view this discussion on the web visit\n\n> https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/copasi-user-forum/1b130697-039e-496e-beb6-d01362f0a2d2%40googlegroups.com\n\n> <https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/copasi-user-forum/1b130697-039e-496e-beb6-d01362f0a2d2%40googlegroups.com?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer>.\n\n\n\nPedro Mendes\n\nunread,\n\nto copasi-u...@googlegroups.com\n\nHi Fabio,\n\nthe error you are getting is unrelated with what we discussed before.\n\nThis error is basically that COPASI is running out of memory on your\n\ncomputer. You are just having too many time points in each time course\n\n(200000) and then you are doing 100 time courses (2e7 time points).\n\nSince you cannot plot things at such a high time resolution (your screen\n\nhas less than 4000 pixels wide, probably only 2048) I suggest that you\n\nsample the time course with less data points. Try changing the value of\n\n200000 down to 10000. That is still more detail more than the plot can\n\nshow and COPASI will have to hold 20x less data in memory. If that is\n\nnot enough, try reducing a bit more (probably not needed).\n\nPedro\n\n\n\n> <https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145>\n\n>\n\n> best\n\n> Frank\n\n>\n\n> --\n\n> You received this message because you are subscribed to the Google\n\n> Groups \"COPASI User Forum\" group.\n\n> To unsubscribe from this group and stop receiving emails from it, send\n\n> an email to copasi-user-fo...@googlegroups.com\n\n> <mailto:copasi-user-fo...@googlegroups.com>.\n\n> To post to this group, send email to copasi-u...@googlegroups.com\n\n> <mailto:copasi-u...@googlegroups.com>.\n\n> To view this discussion on the web visit\n\n> https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/copasi-user-forum/bac63f16-808d-4157-87d8-4647ca1b1f4c%40googlegroups.com\n\n> <https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/copasi-user-forum/bac63f16-808d-4157-87d8-4647ca1b1f4c%40googlegroups.com?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer>.\n\n"
