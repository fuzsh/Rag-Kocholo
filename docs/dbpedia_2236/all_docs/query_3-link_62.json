        "text": "COPASI is a widely used simulator for chemical and\n\nbiochemical reaction networks based on ordinary differential equations\n\nor stochastic methods. It includes various analysis methods such as\n\noptimization, parameter estimation, sensitivity analysis, and several\n\nothers. While COPASI is mostly used in a standalone GUI-based mode,\n\nseveral compute-intesive tasks benefit from parallelization. We created\n\na web-based system which facilitates transforming such tasks into\n\nsmaller sub-tasks that can be run independently. This system then allows\n\nthe user to submit these tasks to HTCondor from the web interface, and\n\nassembles the numerical results in their expected order. Thus the end\n\nuser never has to interact directly with HTCondor."
