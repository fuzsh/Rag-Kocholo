        "text": "Results and implications\n\nOur files for download: Copasi file with Hbd, copasi file with FadB2 and our Matlab file.\n\nCAR-activation\n\nOne of the enzymes in our pathway, CAR, needs activation before it can function. To further understand how this affects the function of this enzyme we modeled the reactions governing the activation. To summarize the results: in most scenarios CAR is mostly in its active form. This is why we have assumed that it is all activated in the following calculations.\n\nBottlenecks: Comparing enzyme rates\n\nTo find out what the rate limiting steps in our pathway are, we compared the rates of the enzyme reactions. This was done by calculating the reaction speeds with different substrate concentrations. The reactions are explained in depth here and the estimated Michaelis-Menten rate equations tell us directly the reaction speeds. We implemented the code to plot these with Matlab.\n\nFadB2 reaction is reversible in our model but for this we approximated it as irreversible. This yields better results for it than in reality.\n\nThe results shown in figure 2 tell us that FadB2 is a really inefficient enzyme and one of the largest bottlenecks in our pathway. This caused us to change it to Hbd; an enzyme with same function and reportedly better performance.\n\nThe plot also shows us that ADO isn't a good one either. To ease the ADO bottleneck, we put the construct containing its gene to the backbone that had a higher copy number, to increase its relative concentration in the cell.\n\nCAR isn’t the best enzyme in our pathway, and unfortunately we couldn’t do anything to make it’s performance better because it was in a different construct than ADO. We had ordered our constructs before we knew the bottleneck results and because of time restrictions we had to cope with what we had, but based on the obtained results we can deduce a better ordering of constructs than we now have. We should put as many of the slowest enzymes as possible to the higher copy number backbone.\n\nWe came to the same conclusions by checking the reaction fluxes and running parameter scans for different enzyme amounts with Copasi. Thus we identified and ranked the different bottlenecks in our pathway.\n\nAfter getting these results we performed the bottleneck analysis again out of curiosity with relative enzyme amounts. When before we had all the enzyme concentrations to be 1e-6 mol/l, now we scaled them to correspond to the different copy numbers of different backbones. We had put CAR-construct into pSB6A1 (ORI: pMB1, copynumber: 15-20) and ADO-construct into pCDFDuet-1 (ORI: CloDF13, copynumber: 20-40). Based on this we approximated that there is about 1.5 times more of those enzymes that are in ADO construct; see figure 4 for results. It is good to remember that we don’t have accurate information on how much enzymes there are in the cell so the actual values might not be right. Despite that this approach gives us a good idea of how one could improve the pathway in the future.\n\nSensitivity analysis\n\nWe performed sensitivity analysis of our pathway model to see the robustness of different parameters. We performed this analysis with the aid of Copasi, which has a ready task for it. Further, we performed this analysis based on both parameters and initial concentrations. We did the analysis with different enzyme concentrations based on the backbone copy numbers.\n\nRelative sensitivities are defined as \\[\\frac{p}{[S]}\\frac{d[S]}{dp},\\] where \\([S]\\) is substrate concentration and \\(p\\) is the parameter by which we wish to calculate the sensitivities. A small sensitivity coefficient with respect to a parameter tells us that the behaviour is robust to the perturbations. If the parameter is large, we have gained knowledge of a control point. There interventions will have significant effects.\n\nWhen we calculated the scaled sensitivities in regarding to initial concentrations, butyryl-CoA was the most sensitive species of our reaction pathway. Hbd and NADPH influenced it positively (5.14 and 1.89) and YciA had a big negative influence (5.1). This doesn't really matter for us, since this doesn't have any effect on propane production. From the results we could see that propane was positively sensitive to ADO, CAR, Hbd and NADPH. This confirms the main bottlenecks and also suggests that NADPH affects our propane production. To improve the pathway in the future one could add mechanisms to create higher amounts of it in the cell.\n\nHere you can download the sensitivity results for initial concentrations or our whole copasi file with Hbd.\n\nThe relative sensitivities when calculated based on the parameters (i.e kinetic constants) tell us the familiar tale of Hbd, CAR and ADO being the most influential enzymes in our pathway. The greatest single sensitivity (5.14) was again for Butyryl-Coa and caused by Hbd's \\(K_{cat}\\). YciA's \\(K_{cat}\\) has the smallest sensitivity value (-5.1). The results suggest that we could improve propane production by finding substitutive enzymes with better kinetic constants and performances.\n\nHere you can download the sensitivity results for parameters or our whole copasi file with Hbd.\n\nTime course\n\nFrom time course analysis we can have some kind of idea of how much propane our system is able to produce. We performed this analysis with Copasi. Since we knew from the bottleneck calculations that FadB2 should be changed to Hbd, we considered only the latter. Also we had different amounts of enzymes based on which backbone they were.\n\nIn our copasi file we don't have the competing enzymes that also eat butyraldehyde, the last substrate before propane. This means that the values obtained here might be higher than in reality.\n\nWith step length of 0.1 minutes and total time 100 min, we got for propane concentration 6.8e-07 mol/l.\n\nIt is good to remember that this doesn’t tell us the exact value of propane produced, rather just an idea of the order of magnitude. We don’t know the amount of enzymes in our cell so we had to estimate it. Also, our model has some simplifications that very possibly affect the outcome.\n\nThe predicted amount of propane produced isn't very high. To produce propane more efficiently in the future, we would need to greatly improve the performance of our pathway. This could be done by taking a look into the bottlenecks of our pathway and other limiting factors such as NADPH."
