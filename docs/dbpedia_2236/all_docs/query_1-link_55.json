        "text": "Alphafold\n\nIntroduction\n\nOur initial idea was centred around the use of RNAIII inhibitory peptide (RIP) to competitively inhibit RNAIII activating peptide (RAP) binding to the target of RAP (TRAP) [1]. According to various sources we found, this would downregulate the agr system, linked to autoinducing peptide (AIP) based quorum sensing (QS). Leading to reduced expression of RNAIII which studies had linked to reduced biofilm formation [2].\n\nPrior to forming our model, we hit some blocks when searching for the DNA sequence of RAP.\n\nWe were unable to find any sequence for 'RAP' or 'RNAIII inhibitory peptide' across multiple gene and protein databases, including both the gene and protein database in NCBI and the protein database in UniProt.\n\nThe sequence we managed to find was 'Large ribosomal subunit protein uL2' which had 100% amino acid identity with the RAP sequence given in a paper by Korem et al. who generated a recombinant form of the protein to characterise RAP for the first time [3].\n\nWhen we searched 'Large ribosomal subunit protein uL2' in both NCBI and UniProt protein databases again we found a sequence, however RAP was not listed as an alternative name.\n\nThis began to raise some flags, but we had begun some modelling alongside, which helped us test the likelihood that these proteins would actually interact.\n\nModel\n\nFigure 1: (Blue) RAP best model from Alphafold 2 aligned to (orange) 50S ribosomal protein L2 using matchmaker tool in ChimeraX. Both amino acid sequences were sequenced from Staphylococcus aureus.\n\nThe Structure of RAP\n\nUsing the matchmaker command in ChimeraX the protein structures for RAP and 50S ribosomal protein uL2 have been superimposed using a pairwise sequence alignment and then by fitting the aligned residue pairs.\n\nThe RMSD (root-mean-square deviation) between the two sets of atoms is 0.243Å. For reference, a successful RMSD score is less than or equal to 1.5Å [4]. Providing confirmation that the 50S ribosomal binding protein uL2 was indeed the protein sequence that had been previously labelled as RAP.\n\nThe per residue confidence scores (pLDDT) for both proteins were mostly above 90, indicating a very high confidence score.\n\nWe then modelled the binding of RAP to TRAP using the Alphafold tool integrated into ChimeraX (predict function). The Binding of RAP and TRAP\n\nAccording to the mechanism proposed by Balaban, et al. [5] who claimed to discover RIP in 1998 [6] TRAP is the receptor for RAP. Therefore, we wanted to model the protein-protein interactions between RAP and TRAP to see how they would bind. Our initial thinking behind this was that we could then see how RIP would bind, in order to better understand the mechanism of competitive inhibition.\n\nAs we started this process the first red flag to appear was that the sequence for RAP was much longer than that of the receptor, TRAP.\n\nRAP = 277 aa\n\nTRAP = 167 aa\n\nFigure 2: Best model prediction for interaction between RAP (PAE domains in pink, green, yellow) and TRAP (PAE domain blue)\n\nThis could have been explained if TRAP was a multimer, but on RSCB PDB the global stoichiometry was found to be monomeric in both solution and the crystalline form.\n\nPAE (predicted aligned error) is a useful tool for assessing the quality of inter-domain predictions. Where pLDDT is very useful for assessing the quality of individual domain structure predictions (see structure of RAP discussion), PAE has been used here [7].\n\nFigure 3: PAE matrix for the interaction between domains in the RAP/TRAP complex, generated using PAE viewer [8].\n\nThe PAE is generally high (10-30 Å) - see Figure 3. This indicates that the relative position and orientation of RAP and TRAP is uncertain, meaning it should not be interpreted [7].\n\nThese results flagged to us that it is unlikely that RAP and TRAP do bind, suggesting that these systems may not function as described in the literature we had found.\n\nInitially we thought this could mean TRAP was not the receptor, and that there was an uncharacterised sensor kinase - with the proposed mechanism being RAP binding to the SK leading to the phosphorylation of the HK domain in TRAP.\n\nReturning to the Literature\n\nThe output from Alphafold2 and ChimeraX, paired with the struggles we faced when searching for the sequences initially, lead us to become sceptical of this mechanism. Upon returning to the literature, we found various contradictory papers. This discourse was summarised in a 2007 article [9]. To summarise, Balaban and Novick published the first paper on RIP in 1995. Subsequent experiments carried out in the same year found that the agr-stimulating activity which had been attributed to RAP could actually be due to the action of AIPs. This was disputed by Balaban's group in a 1998 paper. In the following years more papers were published on the subject, however the nail in the head came with a paper lead by Novick [10], who was an author on the first paper. This paper determined that Balaban's results could be due to AIP contamination rather than the action of RIP. Following this, Balaban published a sub-par response. This was followed by the article in which we found the 'Large ribosomal subunit protein uL2' DNA sequence [3], bringing us in a full circle. To summarise all the findings: inactivation of traP (the gene for TRAP) has no impact on S. aureus virulence (specifically the haemolytic activity), and disruption of TRAP had no effect on S. aureus surface protein profile [11]. Therefore, disproving Balaban's work. A few years later a paper was released reviewing these findings, and interrogating whether RIP could be effective [12]. The results showed that TRAP may function to reduce oxidative stress, and that RIP could be effective - but only with an amide group on the C-terminus. This is not possible to encode and replicate in bacteria. Therefore, we returned to idea generation - using the skills and knowledge we had gained to find a way to inhibit biofilm formation.\n\nReferences\n\nGov Y, Bitler A, Dell'Acqua G, Torres JV, Balaban N.

To do this, we built a model of differential equations based on the following mechanism[1] through the 2 transcripts of the agr operon, RNAII and RNAIII.\n\nProduction of autoinducing peptides (AIPs) from AgrB and AgrD was simplified by modelling RNAII transcription to AIP directly. AgrA phosphorylation following AgrC phosphorylation by AIP was also simplified by assuming that AIPs directly phosphorylated AgrA. Production of autoinducing peptides (AIPs) from AgrB and AgrD was simplified by modelling RNAII transcription to AIP directly. AgrA phosphorylation following AgrC phosphorylation by AIP was also simplified by assuming that AIPs directly phosphorylated AgrA.\n\nWe then built a model involving 2 separate components, the RIP-RAP-TRAP mechanism, and the expression of RNAII and RNAIII through the autoinduction by AIPs.\n\nModel\n\nRIP RAP TRAP mechanism\n\nTo develop the first part of our model, we assumed that all reactions were one -to-one reactions. We also assumed that RIP binding to TRAP and RAP binding to TRAP were both reversible reactions. From these two assumptions we get the series of ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d} [RIP]}{\\mathrm{d} t} = -k_{1}([RIP]\\cdot[TRAP]) +t_{1}\\cdot[TRAPR]$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d} [RAP]}{\\mathrm{d} t} = -k_{2}([RAP]\\cdot[TRAP]) +t_{2}\\cdot[TRAPP]$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d} [TRAPR]}{\\mathrm{d} t} = k_{1}([RIP]\\cdot[TRAP]) -t_{1}\\cdot[TRAPR]$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d} [TRAPP]}{\\mathrm{d} t} = k_{2}([RAP]\\cdot[TRAP]) -t_{2}\\cdot[TRAPP] $$\n\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d} [TRAP]}{\\mathrm{d} t}=-k_2 ([RAP]\\cdot[TRAP])+t_2\\cdot[TRAPP]-k_1 ([RIP]\\cdot[TRAP])+t_1\\cdot[TRAPR]$$\n\nWith this set of differential equations, we can then move onto the next part of our model with phosphorylated TRAP upregulating the agr operon, and subsequently RNA III.\n\nAgr operon\n\nPhosphorylated TRAP upregulates the agr system through a poorly characterised mechanism. The P2 promoter is activated, leading to RNAII expression, resulting in the downstream production of AIP and AgrA phosphorylation. TRAP phosphorylation can thus be simplified as triggering the production of AIPs and AgrA phosphorylation. This can be modelled as a chemical reaction relating AIPs and AgrA. AIPs phosphorylate AgrA which then activates transcription from both the P2 and P3 promoters for RNAII and RNAIII respectively. It is assumed that once AgrA is phosphorylated and activates the promoters, it becomes dephosphorylated. AIPs also trigger the dephosphorylation of TRAP[2]. Both these reactions were modelled with the following differential equations:\n\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d} [AIP]}{\\mathrm{d} t}=-k_6\\ ([AIP]\\cdot[AgrA])+k_3 ([TRAPP]\\cdot[p2])+k_9 ([AgrAP]\\cdot[p3])$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d} [AgrA]}{\\mathrm{d} t}=-k_6 ([AIP]\\cdot[AgrA])+k_3 ([TRAPP]\\cdot[p2])+k_9 ([AgrAP]\\cdot[p3])+k_8 ([AgrAP]\\cdot[p3])$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d} [AgrAP]}{\\mathrm{d} t}=k_6 ([AIP]\\cdot[AgrA])-k_9 ([AgrAP]\\cdot[p3])-k_8 ([AgrAP]\\cdot[p3]) $$\n\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d} RNAIII}{\\mathrm{d} t}=k_8\\ ([AgrAP]\\cdot[p3]) $$\n\nCombining these equations with those for the RIP-RAP-TRAP mechanism previously defined, we get:\n\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d} [TRAPP]}{\\mathrm{d} t}=k_2 ([RAP]\\cdot[TRAP])-t_2\\cdot[TRAPP]-k_7 ([AIP]\\cdot[TRAPP])$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d} [TRAP]}{\\mathrm{d} t}=-k_2 ([RAP]\\cdot[TRAP])+t_2\\cdot[TRAPP]-k_1 ([RIP]\\cdot[TRAP])+t_1\\cdot[TRAPR]+k_7 ([AIP]\\cdot[TRAPp])$$\n\nDegradation and production rates\n\nSince the molecules degrade over time, degradation rates for each of the molecules needs to be considered. Since TRAP, RIP, and AIP are also formed outside the modelled mechanism, these considerations need to be incorporated. This results in the following equations:\n\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d} [RIP]}{\\mathrm{d} t} = -k_{1}([RIP]\\cdot[TRAP]) +t_{1}\\cdot[TRAPR] + secretion \\:rate$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d} [RAP]}{\\mathrm{d} t} = -k_{2}([RAP]\\cdot[TRAP]) +t_{2}\\cdot[TRAPP]$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d} [TRAP]}{\\mathrm{d} t}=-k_2 ([RAP]\\cdot[TRAP])+t_2\\cdot[TRAPP]-k_1 ([RIP]\\cdot[TRAP])+t_1\\cdot[TRAPR] + TRAP\\:production\\:rate$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d} [TRAPP]}{\\mathrm{d} t}=k_2 ([RAP]\\cdot[TRAP])-t_2\\cdot[TRAPP]-k_7 ([AIP]\\cdot[TRAPP])$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d} [TRAPR]}{\\mathrm{d} t} = k_{1}([RIP]\\cdot[TRAP]) -t_{1}\\cdot[TRAPR]$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d} [AgrA]}{\\mathrm{d} t}=-k_6 ([AIP]\\cdot[AgrA])+k_3 ([TRAPP]\\cdot[p2])+k_9 ([AgrAP]\\cdot[p3])+k_8 ([AgrAp]\\cdot[p3])$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d} [AgrAP]}{\\mathrm{d} t}=k_6 ([AIP]\\cdot[AgrA])-k_9 ([AgrAP]\\cdot[p3])-k_8 ([AgrAP]\\cdot[p3])$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d} [AIP]}{\\mathrm{d} t}=-k_6\\ ([AIP]\\cdot[AgrA])+k_3 ([TRAPP]\\cdot[p2])+k_9 ([AgrAP]\\cdot[p3]) + AIP \\:production \\:rate$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d} RNAIII}{\\mathrm{d} t}=k_8\\ ([AgrAP]\\cdot[p3])$$\n\nConstants\n\nConstant Reaction constant for K1 RIP binding to TRAP K2 RAP binding to TRAP K3 TRAPP causing the production of AIPS K6 AIP phosphorylating AgrA K7 AIP dephosphorylating TRAPP K8 Expression of RNAIII by AgrAP K9 Expression of RNAII (production of AIPs) by AgrAP Constant Utility t1 Rate of TRAPR to TRAP + RIP t2 Rate of TRAPP to TRAP + RAP [p2] Concentration of p2 [p3] Concentration of p3 Constant Utility Secretion Rate Secretion rate of RIP by the bacteria TRAP Production rate Production of TRAP not by the mechanism AIP Production rate Production of AIP not by the mechanism Constant Degradation rate for d1 RIP d2 RAP d3 TRAP d4 TRAPP d5 TRAPR d6 AgrA d7 AgrAP d8 RNAIII\n\nConclusion\n\nWe ran this model on python using scipy.integrate.odeint\n\nWe graphed this over time and compared RNAIII expression with RIP secretion and with no RIP secretion to determine the shape of the graph before finding any of the constants.\n\nFrom the shape of the graph, an increase in RIP secretion leads to a decrease in RNAIII expression. This shape stays constant even with different constants.\n\nConcerns\n\nHowever, our protein structure model lead to doubts regarding whether RIP/RAP bounded to TRAP, which was the main assumption in our RIP-RAP-TRAP model above. Additionally, Vuong et al.[3] noted agr deletion mutants increased biofilm formation, which lead us to have some doubts about the RIP-RAP-TRAP system and its antibiofilm effect.\n\nReferences\n\nDe Oliveira A, Pinheiro-Hubinger L, Pereira VC, Riboli DFM, Martins KB, Romero LC, et al.

Plantarum, to increase autoinducer 2 (AI-2) molecules and decrease biofilm formation downstream, as previously explained in our Project Description.\n\nLuxS catalyses the reaction of S-ribosyl-L-homocysteine (Srh) to Homocysteine (Hcy) and 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (DPD). Hcy gets recycled back to Srh and DPD acts as the precursor for AI-2 through various intermediate stages.\n\nWhether the amount of Srh needs to be replenished to achieve an increase in DPD production, and thus AI-2, is a question we hope to answer using our model.\n\nMechanism:\n\nModel\n\nOur model looks at the relationship between an increase in LuxS and DPD production. To build this model, the mechanism of Srh and DPD production are needed. The model assumes an increase in DPD will increase AI-2 and excludes other ways of DPD production not from Srh.\n\nAdditionally, the production of Srh from Hcy is considered direct and the intermediate stages ignored. Using the four-molecule system (Srh, LuxS, DPD, Hcy) a set of differential equations were built.\n\nDifferential Equations\n\nTo develop the set of equations, the main reaction, DPD production from Srh catalysed by LuxS was modelled using the Henri Michaelis Menten equation[1]:\n\n$$\\frac{V_{max}\\cdot[S]}{k_m+[S]}$$\n\nVmax is defined as: Vmax = k2⋅[Et], where [Et] is the concentration of enzyme both attached to the substrate and not attached to the substrate[1]. The model was based on differing amounts of LuxS ([Et]) and thus Vmax was separated in the model, resulting in the reaction velocity equation:\n\n$$\\frac{k_2\\cdot[E_2]\\cdot[S]}{k_m+[S]}$$\n\nThe production of Srh from Hcy was assumed as a first order reaction due to it solely being based on the concentration of Hcy. Thus, simple equation used was:\n\n$$v\\ =P_1\\cdot[Hcy]$$\n\nThere are two molecules in the model which are produced from outside the mechanism: Hcy and LuxS. It was assumed the production of these two molecules from outside the system did not rely on any components produced in the system.\n\nDegradation constants for all molecules except DPD were incorporated, as we wanted to find the total DPD produced, and assumed its concentration did not affect any other part of the mechanism. This leaves the following set of ordinary differential equations:\n\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d} DPD}{\\mathrm{d} t}=\\frac{k_2\\cdot[E_t]\\cdot[S]}{k_m+[S]}\\cdot V$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d} [S]}{\\mathrm{d} t}=(P_1\\cdot[Hcy]-\\frac{k_2\\cdot[E_t]\\cdot[S]}{k_m+[S]})\\cdot V - P_2\\cdot[S]$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d} [Hcy]}{\\mathrm{d} t}=(\\frac{k_2\\cdot[E_t]\\cdot[S]}{k_m+[S]}-P_1\\cdot[Hcy])\\cdot V +[Hcy]\\ production\\ rate-P_3\\cdot [Hcy]$$\n\n$$\\frac{\\mathrm{d} [E_t]}{\\mathrm{d} t}=E_t\\ production\\ rate-P_4\\cdot [E_t]$$\n\nConstants\n\nSymbol Value/Equation Unit Reference/Assumption Rate Constants km 0.38 * 6.02e17 Molecules/L Part: BBa_K091109 Registry of standard biological parts k2 5.41e-4 s-1 Part: BBa_K091109 Registry of standard biological parts P1 0.00017982625 s-1 Determined from iterations of model to give a constant value of S for the wild type model Production Rates Hcy production rate See equation below Molecules/s Matches the production of Hcy of the wild type to produce a constant concentration Hcy of 615 molecules Et production rate 2.05 Molecules/s [5][6] Although 5 is for in Vibrio fischeri assumed similar in L plantarum Initial Values Et0 205 Molecules Et production rate and P4 assumed to reach an equilibirum immediately.

This is most likely due to the substrate (Srh) being formed from one of the by-products (Hcy) of the reaction catalysed by LuxS. The results also show that an increase in amount of Srh increases the production of DPD, but this is not required to see an increase in DPD production.\n\nBased on the model, increasing the production of LuxS would not require Srh to be supplemented for DPD production to increase. This informed us that we would not need to replenish our L.plantarum expressing LuxS with Srh to increase the production of DPD, and thus AI-2.\n\nReferences\n\nPunekar NS.

This can cause issues in modelling diffusion as enlarging the system's box means more molecules must be generated which increases the computational load (which can already take over 2 day to run one simulation), however leaving the box too small can lead to diffusion effects being unclear due to molecules moving into an area in reverse. This can be seen below in the result from aqueous diffusion.\n\nFigure 2: A gif showing the random motion of ai-2 molecules. The molecules can be seen appearing at the top of the box due to periodicity, as well as diffusing gradually upwards.\n\nWhile this is less of an issue in the ai-2 and water case, for the membrane this meant that just the GROMACS simulation alone could not be used to visually detect if diffusion was occurring through the membrane, as can be seen below.\n\nIn order to make a membrane model we used the Charmm standard membrane for inner membranes of gram negative bacteria [4] [5] and then used SwissParam to get molecule files in the correct format for each lipid. [6]\n\nFigure 3: A gif showing a membrane (in the middle) and ai-2 starting in a block above the membrane and then diffusing outwards, after a few frames ai2- molecules can be seen appearing at the bottom of the image and these diffuse upwards until it is hard to tell whether they came through the membrane or not.\n\nIn order to remove any atoms that reached the other side of the membrane via this means a python based code was used to remove these atoms, while a full visualisation could not be created for this reduced set of atoms, the data showing distance travelled in terms of one axis can be plotted\n\nFigure 4: A graph of atom trajectories in the direction of diffusion towards and through the membrane.\n\nThis reduced dataset showed molecules being able to travel approximately 2.5nm into the membrane in a time of 15ns\n\nFrom this we can use the Stokes-Einstein diffusion equation $$t_d = \\frac{d^2}{2D} $$ (Where td is the average time taken for a molecule to diffuse over distance d, and D is the diffusion constant) to obtain a value for D of 2.08e-6 cm/s.\n\nConclusion\n\nReturning to our previous Fick's Law ODE model and using this value and the membrane width used for the simulation to give the permeability coefficient we see that 80% of the ai-2 would diffuse out of the bacteria in the coating within around 3 seconds (with only very little correlation found between the values other constants and time to reach equilibrium). In a system where molecules in the environment could potentially be washed away from the target area easily, in other words in a non-closed system, this would not be idea as our bacteria would have to be producing large amounts of ai-2 and would likely not be able to be supplemented by allowing ai-2 concentrations to build up prior to use.\n\nThis pushed us towards looking to non-bacterial coatings which may allow for higher initial concentrations, and to look at larger molecules such as QQ5 as this model indicated that the ability to move between cells solely by passive diffusion may not be appropriate to our intended application.\n\nReferences\n\nBerendsen, H.

To do this we have used an adapted form of Michaelis Menten kinetics [1]:\n\n$$v=\\frac{k_{cat}\\cdot [S]}{k_{m}+[S]}\\cdot [E_{t}]$$\n\nWe have also added a production rate of AHL to turn our differential equation into:\n\n$$v=\\frac{k_{cat}\\cdot [S]}{k_{m}+[S]}\\cdot [E_{t}] + production$$\n\nWe have then assumed that the degradation of AHL lactonase is negligible. From this simple equation we can then use the following constants to determine the quantity of AHL lactonase we would need to degrade AHL in a meaningful way.\n\nConstants\n\nConstant Value Reference Kcat 37.63 s-1 [2] Km 0.00511 M [2] Production 0.167 nMs-1 [3]\n\nline\n\nUsing Copasi[4] we then modelled this by using the inbuilt Michaelis Menten kinetics. We also modelled a ‘producer’ molecule with a very large concentration using the inbuilt mass action kinetics with a rate equal to the modelled production rate. Using Python we graphed a variety of different concentrations taken from our standard curve for our LCMS lab work. We also have a ‘negligible’ concentration of AHL, a concentration below which the Quorum Sensing capabilities of the bacteria are severely diminished and therefore biofilm formation may be affected.[4].\n\nConclusion\n\nAs we could see from this graph, we do achieve a plateau in our graph. From this we can then find a concentration for the lactonase that will result in an AHL concentration below our ‘negligible’ concentration. We can then ‘zoom’ into the graph to get a more clear vision of the ‘negligible concentration of AHL line.\n\nFrom our graph we can see our ‘negligible’ concentration is between 1.12e-5 M and 1.0019e-4 M. Due to the rate of reaching the equilibrium being fast enough we could then assume that \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} [S]}{\\mathrm{d} t}\\approx 0\\) for most of the time spent on the catheter. From that we can then plug in our negligible concentration to find our minimum concentration of AHL lactonase to disrupt biofilm formation, which comes out as 22.7 μM.\n\nWhat future teams can do:\n\nModel the degradation of AHL lactonase to find an initial concentration of AHL lactonase needed.\n\nFrom this calculate the feasibility and cost of harvesting AHL lactonase for adding just the AHL lactonase\n\nCalculate the production rates of the AHL lactonase needed by the L. plantarum to counteract the degradation of AHL lactonase and keep a concentration about 22.7 μM.\n\nReferences\n\nPark C.
