        "text": "üìÉScientific paper: Group Activity Recognition via Dynamic Composition and Interaction Abstract: Previous group activity recognition approaches were limited to reasoning using human relations or finding important subgroups and tended to ignore indispensable group composition and human-object interactions. This absence makes a partial interpretation of the scene and increases the interference of irrelevant actions on the results. Therefore, we propose our DynamicFormer with Dynamic composition Module (DcM) and Dynamic interaction Module (DiM) to model relations and locations of persons and discriminate the contribution of participants, respectively. Our findings on group composition and human-object interaction inspire our core idea. Group composition tells us the location of people and their relations inside the group, while interaction reflects the relation between humans and objects outside the group. We utilize spatial and temporal encoders in DcM to model our dynamic composition and build DiM to explore interaction with a novel GCN, which has a transformer inside to consider the temporal neighbors of human/object. Also, a Multi-level Dynamic Integration is employed to integrate features from different levels. We conduct extensive experiments on two public datasets and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art. ;Comment: 13 pages, 6 figures Discover the rest of the scientific article on es/iode ‚û°Ô∏èhttps://etcse.fr/4RgYA\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/edt4-_JA (free for 50 days) The second part of the new article with Irene Crimaldi and Andrea Ghiglietti: how a network of interacting martingales sincronizes Universit√† degli Studi di Milano Dipartimento di Scienze e Politiche Ambientali - Universit√† degli Studi di Milano #network #syncronization Highlights ‚Ä¢Sufficient and necessary conditions for the complete synchronization. ‚Ä¢Periodicity of the system when the synchronization does not hold. ‚Ä¢Characterization of synchronization within the cyclic classes. ‚Ä¢Unified vision via spectral Perron theory.\n\nIn the journey of exploring life sciences, this article has made a breakthrough in integrating the Akbari Ganji method with the homotopic perturbation method, and accurately analyzed the steady-state biofiltration model of a mixture of hydrogen sulfide and methanol. This innovation not only overcomes the complex barriers of the nonlinear reaction-diffusion equation, but also reveals the mystery of the complex interactions within the biofilm with a compact analytical approximation. With the powerful computing power of Matlab, the theoretical analysis and numerical practice are seamlessly connected, verifying the high accuracy of the method. This is not only a profound insight into the steady-state research of biofilms, but also provides a solid theoretical foundation for optimizing biofiltration processes and improving environmental treatment efficiency.
