J., Pyle, D. M., Fontijn, K., Mather, T. A., Nomade, S., Melaku, A. A., Mengesha, M. A., & Yirgu, G. (in press). Magma storage conditions beneath a peralkaline caldera in the Main Ethiopian Rift. Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2024.108165\n\nThe numerous volcanic centres in the Main Ethiopian Rift (MER) present significant but poorly understood hazards to local populations. The MER is also an important site to gain insights into tectonic processes as it captures the transition from conti...

F., Humphreys, M. C. S., Iveson, A. A., Cooper, K. M., Clynne, M. A., Lindoo, A., Brooker, R. A., & Wadsworth, F. B. (in press). Crystal resorption as a driver for mush maturation: an experimental investigation. Journal of Petrology, https://doi.org/10.1093/petrology/egae088\n\nThe thermal state of a magma reservoir controls its physical and rheological properties: at storage temperatures close to the liquidus, magmas are dominated by melt and therefore mobile, while at lower temperatures, magmas are stored as a rheological...

(online). Minimizing BER for RIS-assisted wireless broadcast communication systems with dynamic network topology without CSI. Computer Networks, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2024.110729\n\nThis paper studies a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted broadcast communication system with dynamic network topology where a transmitter broadcasts information to multiple receivers with time-varying locations via a RIS. The goal is to... Read More about Minimizing BER for RIS-assisted wireless broadcast communication systems with dynamic network topology without CSI."
