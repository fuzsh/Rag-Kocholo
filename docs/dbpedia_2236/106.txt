COPASI is a widely used simulator for chemical and

biochemical reaction networks based on ordinary differential equations

or stochastic methods. It includes various analysis methods such as

optimization, parameter estimation, sensitivity analysis, and several

others. While COPASI is mostly used in a standalone GUI-based mode,

several compute-intesive tasks benefit from parallelization. We created

a web-based system which facilitates transforming such tasks into

smaller sub-tasks that can be run independently. This system then allows

the user to submit these tasks to HTCondor from the web interface, and

assembles the numerical results in their expected order. Thus the end

user never has to interact directly with HTCondor.
