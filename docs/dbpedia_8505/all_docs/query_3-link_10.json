        "text": "The book Andha Yug is written as a poem cum drama. Dialogues are somewhere between a poem and prose. The whole book is about the scene from Mahabharata, after the 18-day war. It begins with the last scene that Sanjay narrates to the blind Dhritarashtra and Gandhari. While the final battle between Bheem and Duryodhan is still to happen, Duryodhan is yet to die.\n\nAndha Yug by Dharamvir Bharti\n\nIt depicts the psychology of Ashwathama when he realizes that his father has been killed by misusing his name. This has led to the defeat of Kauravas. He goes mad with the thought and wants to kill Pandavas and Krishna, who he knows is the brain behind the trick. It depicts the state of all the survivors who have survived the war, no one is sure who has won the battle in the real sense of the winning, and who has lost it.\n\nIt depicts the end of Krishna, the mesh of curses that get exchanged and affect not only the one who is cursed but the one who gives the curse. For the first time, it is said that of all the Pandavas it was only the Yudhishthira who was carrying the burden of all his four brothers as they were good for nothing. Not sure if the original Mahabharata says the same, but at least the popular versions have indicated that.\n\nThe language is the best part of this book, the prose and poetry are written with a lot of meaning that conveys the emotions with equal ease. You almost go through every emotion as you read the verses, and feel what each character is going through. It is a good read for people who like to read good Hindi.\n\nUpdates\n\nAndha Yug (Hindi), or Blind Age is a 1953 verse play written in Hindi, by renowned novelist, poet, and playwright Dharamvir Bharati (1926-1997).\n\nThe play begins with the Kauravas, the defeated side of the war, lamenting their losses. They are led by Duryodhana, a cruel and arrogant man who is blinded by his hatred for the Pandavas, the victorious side. Duryodhana is determined to avenge his defeat, even if it means destroying the entire world.\n\nThe play ends with the destruction of the world. The gods are angry with the humans for their violence, and they unleash a flood that wipes out all life.\n\nAndha Yug is a powerful and disturbing play that explores the dark side of human nature. It is a warning against the dangers of war and violence. It calls for a new way of thinking about the world.\n\nA classic of Indian literature, has been translated into many languages and has been performed all over the world. It continues to be relevant.\n\nThemes explored:\n\nFutility of war\n\nThe destructive power of violence\n\nImportance of compassion and forgiveness\n\nNeed for a new way of thinking about the world\n\nA powerful and thought-provoking play that has had a lasting impact on Indian literature and culture. It is a must-read for anyone interested in the human condition.\n\nAhsan Bhai, thanks for sending me this book.\n\nBuy this book â€“ Andha Yug by Dharamvir Bharti at Amazon India.\n\nRead more:\n\nYuganta The End of an Epoch by Irawati Karve\n\nHidimba by Narendra Kohli\n\nArjuna by Anuja Chandramouli\n\nGandhari Ki Atmakatha by Manu Sharma\n\nThis site is Amazon Associate and may earn a small commission on purchases that you make through the links, without impacting what you pay for it."
