        "text": "Indian diaspora settled in the Western world has historically been associated with building a bridge between culture and community, art, and activism. For 20 years SETU (Stage Ensemble Theatre Unit, Boston, www.setu.us) has been doing that and more, largely focusing on Indian social issues and Indian heritage. SETU is bringing its new production “Andha Yug: The Age of Darkness” (directed by SETU co-founder Subrata Das) this September in Boston MA.\n\n“Andha Yug” is a masterpiece of modern Indian theatre that depicts the moral and ethical dilemmas faced by individuals in the context of the Kurukshetra War of the Indian epic Mahabharata. Written in 1954, about events that happened in another time and place, this powerful play is still relevant today.\n\n“Andha Yug” is set in the immediate aftermath of the Kurukshetra War. The 18-day battle between the Pandavas and the Kauravas has almost ended, and it has left behind a landscape of destruction and despair. Both sides have committed unthinkable acts of violence and ignored the rules of engagement at will. Now three desperate survivors on the losing side have one last chance to exact revenge by planning something that takes depravity to new heights. Will they do it? What happens next?\n\nThe central appeal of “Andha Yug” lies in its ruthless examination of the futility of war. Through its characters, the play reflects on how even the most noble of causes can lead to senseless violence and destruction and how the noblest of men and women can be driven to justify even more violence and destruction. The stark contrast between the righteous Pandavas and the unrighteous Kauravas is blurred — isn’t that what happens when war begins? In the words of one of the protagonists, it is: Kill, kill, and kill again! Can there be any morality during such chaos?\n\nEvery major character in the play struggles to justify their actions — we are spellbound as we witness the erosion of humanity in the face of war, the inevitable otherization, the loss of empathy and tolerance, the dominance of prejudice and discrimination and the havoc it wreaks on the body and mind of its survivors. It bothers us with poignant questions that will shape our attitude towards current world conflicts and hopefully spark innovative ideas on how to resolve them.\n\nPlease join us to watch this unique play “Andha Yug” this weekend, on the 29 -30 September 2023, at the Mosesian Center for the Arts, Watertown, MA. Tickets are available at www.setu.us.\n\n(Top photo, Fotu Duniya)\n\nNilay Mukherjee is a biomedical engineer who is passionate about bringing innovative medical devices to the patient.
