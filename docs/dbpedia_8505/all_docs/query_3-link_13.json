        "text": "One of the most influential plays I have ever read!\n\n// http://c.amazon-adsystem.com/aax2/assoc.js\n\nEvery word, every phrase of this play is so true that I could literally feel how morally wrong our age has become. Why the present age is the age of darkness and why humans are losing their calm is beautifully answered in this incredible play.\n\nAndha Yug (The Blind Age) is a well-crafted play by a prominent Hindi dramatist Dharamvir Bharati. It is based on Mahabharata, which is considered to be the longest Indian epic ever written.\n\nThis play depicts an apt picture of our present times .The centralized theme of the play showcases how we easily blame god in our bad times. The play conveys how future is determined by our present actions and is not predestined. And, the major theme of this play is how violence and wars can only produce large-scale carnage without any victors!\n\nThe play has five acts; each act presenting a particular character and his/her blinkered vision of life. After losing the war against Pandavas, the left Kaurava characters – Ashvatthama, Gandhari, Dhritrashtra, Yuyutsu, etc – begin viewing Karma according to their own selfish interests. Their attitude towards life becomes so much blinkered that they commence on the path of further degeneration. They totally discard the idea of repent and instead, choose the path of further violence & carnage. The presence of the character of Krishna (Lord Vishnu in his human avatar) in each act through several things such as peacock feather, ringing of the bells and the melodious sound of his flute, is symbolic of the chance to repent available to the Kaurava characters. But, these characters are so much blinded by their rage that, these positive things are not visible to them.\n\nAfter presenting us with an abominable picture of Kauravas’ actions, Bharati is ingenious enough to show us the deteriorating picture of Pandavas after their victory. Pandavas are also leading a decadent life as they do not know how to rule, they have killed their brothers and are equal participants in the bloodshed as much were the Kauravas. Their conscience is guilty and it seems as if one set of selfish rulers have simply replaced another. They do not prove to be any great rulers of Hastinapur.\n\nHence, through this play, Bharati questions the idea of aiming peace through wars. He clearly depicts how wars are destructive for both the sides. It does not matter whether you lose or win, a war can only lead to loss of human lives & peace.\n\nI totally recommend you to read this play and realize how violence can only result in bloodshed without any happiness!"
