The play raises questions about what constitutes justice and who has the right to dispense it.

As a result, he loses the support of his allies and is left alone to face his enemies.\n\nKarna’s Tragic Heroism\n\nKarna, the tragic hero of Andha Yug, is portrayed as a noble warrior who is torn between his loyalty to his friend Duryodhana and his commitment to dharma.

However, it is not the only work of literature that uses this technique. In fact, there are several other works that use the Mahabharata as a source of inspiration. For example, the novel “The Palace of Illusions” by Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni retells the Mahabharata from the perspective of Draupadi, the wife of the five Pandavas. Similarly, the novel “Jaya” by Devdutt Pattanaik is a retelling of the Mahabharata that focuses on its moral and ethical teachings.\n\nDifferences with the Mahabharata\n\nWhile Andha Yug is based on the Mahabharata, it differs from the original epic in several ways. For example, Andha Yug takes place on the eighteenth day of the war, which is not covered in the Mahabharata. Additionally, Andha Yug focuses on the aftermath of the war and the moral and ethical dilemmas faced by the characters. In contrast, the Mahabharata focuses on the events leading up to the war and the war itself. Furthermore, Andha Yug uses symbolism and metaphor to convey its message, while the Mahabharata is more straightforward in its storytelling."
