        "meta_description": "A part of the Indian diaspora settled in the western world has historically been associated with building a bridge between culture and community, art, and activism. For 20 years SETU (Stage Ensemble Theatre Unit, Boston) has been doing that and more, largely focusing on Indian social issues and Indian heritage. SETU is bringing its new production “Andha Yug” (directed by SETU co-founder Subrata Das) this September in Boston MA. \"Andha Yug\" is a masterpiece of Indian literature and theatre that delves deep into the moral and ethical dilemmas faced by individuals in the aftermath of the Mahabharata war. Written in 1954, this powerful play continues to resonate with audiences, offering a timeless exploration of the consequences of war and the erosion of human values. In this blog post, we will delve into the themes, characters, and impact of \"Andha Yug\" on both Indian and global literature.",
