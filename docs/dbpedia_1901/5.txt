The song 'Kiss Me Good-Bye' by Buck-Tick, a Japanese rock band known for their unique blend of rock, electronic, and gothic elements, delves into the emotional turmoil of a farewell. The lyrics paint a picture of a person bidding goodbye to a loved one, possibly at the end of a relationship. The repeated phrase 'Kiss me good-bye' signifies the finality of the moment, while 'make me cry' underscores the pain and sorrow associated with parting ways.

The imagery of 'overflowing eyes' and 'cold, wet lips' evokes a sense of deep sadness and the physical manifestations of crying. The mention of the candle and tears suggests a scene of intimate mourning, where the speaker desires the presence of the other until the very last moment, until the candle burns out and tears dry up. This metaphor could represent the dwindling flame of their relationship and the eventual end of their emotional connection.

The song's chorus, with its plea to stop time and close the curtain on the pair, reflects a desire to preserve the final moments together, even as they accept the inevitable end. The repeated requests to stay and watch over each other until they crumble or break apart highlight the intensity of their bond and the difficulty of letting go. 'Kiss Me Good-Bye' is a poignant exploration of the heartache that comes with saying goodbye, capturing the bittersweet nature of a love that has run its course but is still cherished.
