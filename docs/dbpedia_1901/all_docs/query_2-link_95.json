        "text": "As we’ve previously noted, there is no Grammy category in which Grammys Gonna Grammy like BNA.\n\nThis year’s crop of possible nominees, in any case, is no mere tastemaker playlist. In fact, most of the artists below have already shown muscle in the marketplace and established themselves with audiences as real acts, not just songs. Quite a few of the artists listed here are likely to get nominated in other categories—and a few could well be contenders for Record, Song or even Album of the Year.\n\nWe note that new acts were essentially absent from the Grammy stage last year, which seems like a hugely wasted opportunity. We trust that mistake will not be repeated in 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, we’re about to see the Grammy rule that says a prior nominee isn’t eligible for BNA put to the test. How flexible will the Recording Academy be in the name of including what it wants to include?\n\nChappell Roan: Island’s protean singer-songwriter is widely viewed as the artist to beat in this category. She’s streaming up a storm and has attracted huge crowds with her live presentation; her queer/glam sensibility, meanwhile, lends depth to her storytelling. It would be shocking if she weren’t nominated. It wouldn’t be at all surprising if she won.\n\nSabrina Carpenter: Roan’s labelmate is probably the biggest commercial-breakout story of 2024—singles “Espresso” and “Please Please Please” are two of the year’s biggest songs, and her Short n’ Sweet album (due 8/23) should yield more crowd-pleasing confections. Carpenter is a state-of-the-art pop star; will Grammy anoint her?\n\nTeddy Swims: The face-tatted Warner singer has been a fixture on the DSP charts thanks to “Lose Control,” a killer throwback soul-rock-film noir number that showcases the velvety rasp of his vocal chops. Like Chris Stapleton, he blends genres effortlessly, and his vibe could prove to be catnip for Grammy.\n\nBenson Boone: Another Warner breakthrough, Boone has racked up a gazillion streams with the swoony pop-rock monster “Beautiful Things.” The emotional punch extends to the rest of his Fireworks & Rollerblades album. Will he give Grammy the feels?\n\nShaboozey: “A Bar Song (Tipsy)” is a one-listen giant, and EMPIRE’s singer-songwriter, who first surfaced on Beyoncé’s COWBOY CARTER, has helped debunk assumptions that country is a “white” genre—while weaving in hip-hop and R&B tropes. If Grammy is going to celebrate the form here, he might be just the guy.\n\nCentral Cee: The Columbia star is the first latter-day U.K. rapper to break through on this side of the drink, and he’s earned big streams with “BAND4BAND” f/Lil Baby. With a sensibility and style that’s unique in hip-hop, could he end up on the short list?\n\nThe Red Clay Strays: While roots-music contenders abound, RCA’s Strays appear to be the only Americana band in the mix. Frontman Brandon Coleman’s terrific voice and smoldering presence have galvanized crowds on the road, and the troupe’s songs are deep and strong.\n\nGloRilla: The CMG/Interscope rapper has multiple hits under her belt, an authoritative voice and a steely persona. She was nominated for Rap Performance in 2023 for “F.N.F. (Let’s Go)” with Hitkidd, but Grammy does what Grammy likes and could circumvent its own rules and include her if it wanted to.\n\nAnne Wilson: The UMG Nashville singer-songwriter has crafted a hybrid of country and Christian that’s inclusive and musically impeccable. She, too, was previously nominated; could she also be an exception?\n\nKoe Wetzel: Another big arrival at the intersection of country, rock and Americana, Columbia’s Wetzel is a skilled storyteller with a strong voice—and with songs like “High Road” he’s made that voice resonate on the streaming charts. In a field packed with rootsy troubadours, can he cut through?\n\nIvan Cornejo: This Californian—a key signing for Interscope’s Miami office—has become a real player in the música Mexicana scene. His voice, suffused with yearning, requires no translation. It seems likely that Grammy will want to acknowledge the importance of Spanish-language music in this category. Could Cornejo be a primary beneficiary?\n\nSexyy Red: The Rebel/gamma. rapper is brash and badass, and with cuts like “Pound Town” and “Get It Sexyy,” she’s made a big noise. While it might be far from Grammy’s typically highbrow leanings, Sexyy’s raunchy rap is fun. She’d certainly spice up the BNA lineup.\n\nFeid: Universal Music Latino’s Colombian phenom was crowned reggaeton royalty over the last year and has become a stadium-filling star internationally. He’s also had a series of hot collaborations. Could his elevated status lead to love from the Academy?\n\nThe Last Dinner Party: Flamboyantly theatrical, powerfully feminist, thrumming with volatile sexuality, Island’s alternative band of Brits has won a feverish following with killer material and a take-no-prisoners presentation. Could they be served with some Grammy recognition?\n\nTommy Richman: The ISO Supremacy/PULSE singer-songwriter’s lo-fi homebrew recalls the DIY soul-rock of Prince, Beck and Steve Lacy, and with the gigundo “MILLION DOLLAR BABY” and follow-up “DEVIL IS A LIE” he’s found the recipe for stardom. Will his smoky mystique translate for Grammy?\n\nMichael Marcagi: Warner has a stellar roster of Americana-leaning singer-songwriters, the newest of which is Ohio-born Marcagi, a tunesmith and vocalist of surpassing gravity and feeling (best exemplified by the superb “Scared to Start”). He’s a definite arrival.\n\nMegan Moroney: Ever since she scored a smash with “Tennessee Orange,” biz watchers have been waiting for the Columbia-Sony Nashville comer to leap to the next level. But Moroney is a highly appealing presence who may well find a spot on the list.\n\nReneé Rapp: The Interscope pop singer-songwriter and actress is a versatile, charismatic performer, equally at home on an aching ballad (“Snow Angel”) or a playful dance jam (“Not My Fault” f/Megan Thee Stallion). With so many female popsters vying for spots, though, she may have a climb on her hands.\n\nArtemas: 10K’s U.K.-based artist-producer punched through the noise with the propulsive ’80s feel of “i like the way you kiss me,” an infectious, bouncy throwback pop nugget that's streamed like crazy. His distinctly alternative presence would help diversify the BNA list.\n\nMyles Smith: “Stargazing,” the British troubadour’s signature hit (via RCA U.K.), is a one-listen marvel with Mumford/Lumineers vibes and an incandescent vocal. Some love from Grammy could light the fuse that rockets him into the stratosphere.\n\nRoyel Otis: A truly indie alternative project, this Aussie duo has charmed the multitudes with both original material and canny covers. With so much high-profile competition, they may be long shots, but Grammy likes an underdog—and we like Royel Otis."
