If you ever feel the need to really conversate with me about this topic or any other topic you can feel free to do so in the comments or you could email me at KDR519@Yahoo.com and I will gladly respond to all emails. But now to the matter at hand. “Kiss Me”.\n\nSixpence None The Richer are a Christian rock/pop band out of the south, bouncing from the charming (I’ve never been there) community of New Braunfels, Texas to the more glitzy country music capitol of Nashville, Tennessee, which is also where you will find an obervatory showing that you can in fact see Dolly Parton’s tits from space.\n\nNow I have nothing against the group known as Sixpence None The Richer. Growing up their song “Kiss Me” would be blared at rec dances, tape decks, movie screens, and various WB TV shows. Hell, I even enjoy how the Christian band got their name. Singer Leigh Nash, a name that seems destined for a music carreer or porn, described to David Letterman that the band name came from a CS Lewis book Mere Christianity. She goes on to say:\n\nIt comes from a book by C. S. Lewis called Mere Christianity. A little boy asks his father if he can get a sixpence—a very small amount of English currency—to go and get a gift for his father. The father gladly accepts the gift and he’s really happy with it, but he also realizes that he’s not any richer for the transaction. C.S. Lewis was comparing that to his belief that God has given him, and us, the gifts that we possess, and to serve Him the way we should, we should do it humbly—realizing how we got the gifts in the first place.\n\nNow, if that sincere response along with Ms. Nash’s adorable face doesn’t make you just want to put her in your pocket for a pick me up on a down trodden day, then you have another reason to: The perfectly done pop song “Kiss Me”. A song I don’t care for, but a song that I can say is precisely what pop music should be. Which brings me to the inclusion of the music video for the song. We all know that music videos can go in many different directions and often shows the bands at an even more artistic angle. For an example, I would tell you to go to youtube and watch Manchester Orchestra’s music video for their song “Simple Math” and tell me that it’s not art. Like, really good art. Apparently the direction the video for “Kiss Me” wanted to take was in a completely different direction. Probably one heavily funded by Miramax Films which used the song in their teen romantic comedy She’s All That. To quickly sum up the plot of the film, the character played by Freddie Prinze Jr is dumped by his hot popular cheerleader girlfriend. Being that he is very upset over this happening, as you probably would be to (unless you were actually Freddie Prinze Jr who I’m pretty sure no girl has ever dumped ever) and his best friend tells him that his ex is replaceable. And by any girl. And by any girl they of course mean a geeky girl. Which means Rachel Leigh Cook in glasses who fumbles with books. Now, I will admit that Jodi Lyn O’Keefe, Freddie’s ex, is quite easy on the eyes, but still Rachel Leigh Cook made to look like a nerd in the most cliched ways is still better than cheerleading captain O’Keefe, who again is lovely as well, just not as hot as Rachel Leigh Cook. (By the way, Jodi Lyn O’Keefe and Rachel Leigh Cook may actually be the hottest names ever. Really.) So in the end, the “science project” of making a nerdy reject prom queen destroys a friendship but the two who were so far apart at the social end of the social structure of high school (hot or not, though they were both always hot and anone with two eyes knows it) fall in love.\n\nSo that’s the movie. Which I needed to explain because the entire music video to the Sixpence None The Richer song “Kiss Me” is them watching a sort of scratchy TV of the movie while the guys in the band kiss Leigh Nash’s head. And they sit on a bench while doing this. And they seem to be enjoying the experience. Until the end, where you find that after watching the movie they all get up and still haven’t been kissed. Like, really kissed.They even manage to throw Freddie Prinze Jr. and Rachel Leigh Cooke to show up with the band sitting on the bench where the band is. And then there’s some shots of one band member looking intently at the screen and I’m not quite sure if he’s really moved by the film (which let’s be honest, you should never be really moved by that movie even if you love it) or if it’s because he’s never been kissed. So the song ends and the band gets off the bench and walks towards the camera and off screen. And that’s it.\n\nNow, there’s another angle to look at in regards to the song except for the catchy melody and awful music video, there’s also the lyrics. And they are as follows:\n\nKiss me out of the bearded barley\n\nNightly, beside the green, green grass\n\nSwing, swing, swing the spinning step\n\nYou wear those shoes and I will wear that dress.[Chorus:]\n\nOh, kiss me beneath the milky twilight\n\nLead me out on the moonlit floor\n\nLift your open hand\n\nStrike up the band and make the fireflies dance\n\nSilver moon’s sparkling\n\nSo kiss me\n\nKiss me down by the broken tree house\n\nSwing me upon its hanging tire\n\nBring, bring, bring your flowered hat\n\nWe’ll take the trail marked on your father’s map\n\nThere’s nothing really wrong with these lyrics. It’s exactly the kind of stuff that people want their first kiss to be like. There’s the whole idea of being in nature on a summer day. If you wear those shoes she’ll wear that dress (God forbid you wear sandals). The chorus is pure poetry describing how the encounter will be. The moonlit setting, the dancing of fireflies to an imaginary band. With all this magic going on and the moonlight beckoning, Nash sheepishly says “so kiss me.”\n\nBeyond the chorus there is another verse which describes youthful things. The broken down tree house, swinging on a tire swing. Playing dress up and exploring. Such simple yet beautiful acts of youth. Which is what a first kiss should be. And which, to be honest, I’ve never known someone to have. Which is sort of sad, but also not. Because nothing can be better than the build up of that special moment where two people meet in the simplest, perfectly intimate way. And if you happen to find someone who when you think of a kiss from them makes you think of all the youthful things described in “Kiss Me”, than hold onto them with all you’ve got.And oh, I’ve changed my mind. “Kiss Me” is the best song ever written."
