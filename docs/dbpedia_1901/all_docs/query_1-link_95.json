        "text": "December 9, 2014\n\nToday’s song is Kate McGarrigle’s Kiss and Say Goodbye. It appears on the delightful eponymous debut album she and her sister Anna released in 1975. A wonderful musical romp, it’s a lusty grown-up hookup song. The narrator greets a lover who is in town briefly, detailing their plans for a joyous evening on the town. After a night spent in each other’s company, the pair greet the sunrise, then kiss and say goodbye.\n\nKate is in fine voice, with Anna providing flawless harmonies, and the energy of the song is infectiously joyful without being giddy. Bobby Keys — a veteran sax player who has provided decades of studio and tour work for scores of artists, notably the Rolling Stones — provides a jubilant tenor sax solo that bridges the lyrics between the movies and the morning."
