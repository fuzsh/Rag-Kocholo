        "text": "Lyrics\n\nLyrics are through 2012--need to add Arui Wa Anarchy, No. 0, The Mortal, Schaft second album\n\nTranscription notes:\n\n{words in braces} are what is being sung in the song but is not in the album's lyric booklet; these lyrics may come from other sources and will be noted. If the source is not noted then it's simply how I hear it and may be subject to inaccuracies. If I'm not sure what is being said, then I will put a ? mark.\n\n(words in parenthesis) are backing vocals, notes, or samples.\n\nIn Japanese: [words in brackets] is the way the lyricist wants you to read the kanji and is not the traditional way nor is it usually even an acceptable way.\n\nIn English: [words in brackets] are the traditional way of reading the kanji or the original English of a word written in katakana in Japanese.\n\nTranslations: (if I bother to do it--I'm lazy and I think translations are dangerous) My goal is to be accurate but also to do so in a way that you can sing along. Not saying I get it right but I try to balance the following: 1. nit-picky via back translations (if I can translate it back into Japanese and it doesn't match the author's original words, then I will try to do a better translation in English) 2. syllabic matching (if the original line in Japanese was 10 syllables then I will try to translate it into 10 English syllables so you can sing along) and keep the English word in the same part of the sentence for sing-along purposes 3. not assume the author's intentions and make huge leaps in translations (the reader should be allowed to come to conclusions on their own) 4. keep the same tone: if the original lyrics were casual, dirty, slang, masculine, etc then I'll seek English words with a similar tone (here is where huge leaps may be made because the translator may color the translation with how they speak rather than how the author may speak if they learned English)\n\n*Please note that males in Japanese often use a word for \"I\" which is masculine only and is often used in the lyrics presented here. This gendered nuance is not translatable in English."
