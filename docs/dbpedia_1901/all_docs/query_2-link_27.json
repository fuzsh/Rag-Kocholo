        "text": "Thanks to forces none of these acts could name but benefited them at the same time, 1987 became the breakout year for New Order, Depeche Mode, Echo and the Bunnymen, and The Cure, but only the last named sold a top forty breakthrough with a double album. “I wrote The Head on the Door on my own at home and the group interpreted it like an orchestra would, but this time I insisted that the others give me cassettes of their own music and I got six or seven songs from each,” Robert Smith said at the time in Ten Imaginary Years.\n\nA fascination with a British schoolboy’s idea of exotica got the album over; Music for the Masses and Echo’s eponymous release eschewed this ambition. Manipulating these superficially exotic settings to put over Smith’s capital-R-Romantic fantasies about les belles dames sans merci and the boys who don’t cry but fall in love with them, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me remains a singular listening experience for those under forty. What is often called the classic lineup holed up in Mirval Studios in the south of France to record for most of the day, chug red wine, and play soccer on the beach with locals; the tracks reflect this approach. Nothing feels at stake — they experiment with modes because the quintet love Ummagumma as much as The White Album. What Ned Raggett called “a happy slumgullion of approaches being tested out” in a 2017 retrospective for The Quietus. “Almost as if the band aren’t so much musicians as, indeed, cooks, refining or exploring a few recipes and making all results available to the public for their judgment.”\n\nWhen buffets were a thing, people gorged because of a pathological impulse to get one’s money’s worth.” My high school clique, discovering Kiss Me four years after its release, approached the material with, well, caution. All these sounds? Is that a sitar on “If Only Tonight We Could Sleep”? Did the band sample parrots and a door knocker to complement, nearly a decade before Scott Walker folded animal noises into symphonic material on Tilt, the sinister acoustic strumming in “Like Cockatoos”? Why has no songwriter ever matched “Just Like Heaven” in its admixture of longing and realism? (NB: only a writer would write the line, “Daylight licked me into shape”).\n\nMy own CR-90 of Kiss Me kept the following tracks: “The Kiss,” “Catch,” “If Only Tonight We Could Sleep,” “The Perfect Girl,” “Like Cockatoos,” “Just Like Heaven,” “Fight,” and “Icing Sugar,” in that order. No room for the adaptation of a Baudelaire prose poem called “How Beautiful You Are” that served as “Lovesong” in embryonic form; no room for the legitimately interesting “The Snakepit,” one of the few times the Cure’s obsession with playing a couple chords at the same tempo produced hypnotic effects. What doesn’t work: the mummified gaiety of “Why Can’t I Be You?” when Katrina and the Waves had done this sort of thing already; and Smith’s crunched-up vocal attack in “Hot Hot Hot!!!”\n\nMeh\n\nHot Hot Hot!!!\n\nTorture\n\nA Thousand Hours\n\nSound, Solid\n\nWhy Can’t I Be You?\n\nAll I Want\n\nIf Only Tonight We Could Sleep\n\nOne More Time\n\nThe Snakepit\n\nIcing Sugar\n\nFight\n\nThe Perfect Girl\n\nHey You!!!\n\nGood to Great"
