        "text": "Happy National Kissing Day! The unique holiday falls on June 22 every year. Its origins are a bit murky, but Days of the Year notes, “It seems to have developed over time in certain cultures. Some researchers speculate that it began with mouth-to-mouth feedings from mothers to children. However, other researchers refute this, noting that this would likely have made it present in all cultures naturally.”\n\nBesides inspiring us to want to kiss our significant other or even make a move on someone we’ve got a crush on, National Kissing Day has us thinking about music. There are a bunch of songs about kissing or that have the word “kiss” and its tense variations in the title or lyrics.\n\nTo celebrate the holiday, we gathered a short list of our favorite “kiss” songs that will undoubtedly have something for everyone."
