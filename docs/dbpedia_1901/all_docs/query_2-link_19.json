        "text": "Albums Re-Imagined: Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me by The Cure\n\nListen To The Re-Imagined album: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4NvWZxKCByunxb8j8mqNqa\n\nIn 1996 The Cure released an album titled Wild Mood Swings. That title was fitting for that album but it might have been an ever more fitting title for The Cure’s album from almost ten years earlier, 1987’s excellent but emotionally schizophrenic double album Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me. The Cure had long proven to be a very diverse band both stylistically and emotionally and had already had successful songs that ranged from the tense post-punk of “A Forest” to the jazzy pop of “The Love Cats” and from the gothic horror of “The Hanging Garden” to the psychedelic ballad “The Caterpillar”. So, diversity was not necessarily new to The Cure. However, until Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me The Cure had never put it all on one album like this. The Head On The Door had hinted at this diversity of tone and style but The Cure went for it full bore on Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me. For some, this eclectic sprawl may be part of the genius of the album (and of double albums in general) but I personally have always found it a bit messy. I like my albums to feel like albums with a tonal arc running through them and so I have decided to take The Cure’s Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me (which I truly love) and divide it into a true double album, with each album focused on a different part of the band’s style: The first album being focused on the warmer, happier, and more whimsical side of the band and the second album dealing with the darker, anger and lust filled songs. In my version you still get all the great songs (I actually added two of the outtakes from the era to give each album a nice round ten tracks) but you can also focus on whichever mood of the band you are feeling right now (or throw them both in you CD changer and throw it on shuffle to get the eclectic mix of the original record).\n\nDISC 1: Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me (Lighter Side)\n\nHey You!!! – More casual fans of The Cure (or those who only owned the CD version of the album) may not know the song “Hey You!!!” as it was omitted from the CD versions of Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me to allow the album to fit on a single compact disc. This is not a tragedy as, while the song is fun and frothy in the way The Cure sometimes are, it is not a vital track. However, it is a great way to open the lighter record of my Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me as it does help the sunny and silly tone and is the song where the album title actually comes from.\n\nIcing Sugar – “Icing Sugar” is actually one of the darker toned songs to be on the lighter Kiss Me disc. This somewhat darker feel distinguishes it from “Hey You” and establishes that while this album may be the brighter half it isn’t all frothy pop. “Icing Sugar” has driving percussion and throbbing bass and these give the song a sense of need and urgency without pushing it into bleakness. “Icing Sugar” also connects back nicely to “Hey You!!!” because of the prominent use of saxophone in both songs which creates an aural bond between them and gives the album a united flavor from the start.\n\nWhy Can’t I Be You? – “Why Can’t I Be You?” continues the run of songs with a loosely jazzy, horn-driven feel to them and it is these horns that help lend these songs their bright, shiny feeling. However, whereas “Hey You!!!” is mostly a silly diversion and “Icing Sugar” is more of a musical showcase for the band’s superb rhythm section of Simon Gallup and Boris Williams, “Why Can’t I Be You?” is a swirling pop masterpiece that balances its upbeat tempo and punchy horns with a self-deprecating lyric. Placing “Why Can’t I Be You?” here allows the lighter Kiss Me disc to open with a surefire single near the front while also continuing the run of songs loosely connected by their uptempo, horn-driven mood.\n\nCatch – “Catch” is a slightly melancholy song, but it is the warm melancholy of an old love remembered fondly. Robert Smith sings the song in a wistful, fond way while the backing strings add a touch of elegance to the simple, pretty melody. “Catch” is a song about a relationship that is over, but also one that has provided happiness and nostalgia for a better time and it is a song that has always left me feeling warm and fulfilled. Thus, I like it here as a calmer and more reserved moment following our opening run of songs.\n\nJust Like Heaven – A sublimely perfect pop song that manages to be catchy, beautiful, and emotionally complex all at once, “Just Like Heaven” is one of a handful of Cure songs that almost perfectly encapsulate the band’s ability to blend the sad with the sublime. “Just Like Heaven” also manages to carry the vaguely warm and nostalgic mood of “Catch” forward without sounding anything like that song. “Just Like Heaven” is the perfect centerpiece for the lighter side of Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me.\n\nTo The Sky – “To The Sky” was recorded during the sessions for Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me but not included. It was eventually released on a Fiction Records compilation album two years later (and so is often associated more with the Disintegration era) but it is probably the best song cut from Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me and I am choosing to add it back to the album. While “To The Sky” is a slower number with a hint of sadness, it follows in the footsteps of “Catch” and “Just Like Heaven” by melding that melancholy with a fond warmth that gives the song a hopeful spirit that is both reassuring and affirming. Honestly, I’ve never understood why “To The Sky” was cut from the album as it fits in nicely with the overall mood and sound of the record and is a better song than a few others that were ultimately included in my opinion.\n\nThe Perfect Girl – After an opening trio of jazzy, uptempo songs and a middle section of warmly melancholic songs, “The Perfect Girl” opens up the eclectic third part of my lighter first disc of the Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me double album. “The Perfect Girl” is a weird and warped little pop song that comes and goes without leaving a huge impression individually but that adds to the various moods of the album, which is an important component for any double album. In the end, “The Perfect Girl” is simply a quirky, happy little song that finds joy in the uniqueness of his paramour. It is a small song about a small thing, but those small things are often what makes a person special to us.\n\nHot Hot Hot!!! – “Hot Hot Hot!!!” is a funky and rhythmic dance-pop song that finds the band experimenting with elements of funk and rap in a way that, while somewhat dated sounding now, still works surprisingly well for a band known for their icy ballads and towering, gothic epics. “Hot Hot Hot!!!”, more than anything else on Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, feels like a cousin to The Cure’s early 80’s run of warped pop singles. It is the 1987 equivalent to “The Walk”, “The Love Cats”, “Speak My Language” or “Let’s Go To Bed” and Robert Smith and company seem to be having a grand time playing around with these styles and sounds.\n\nOne More Time – Putting “One More Time” on the lighter of my two Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me discs may be something of a stretch. The song is a yearning, aching ballad full of chiming guitars, aching vocals, and a perfect clarinet hook (at least I think it is a clarinet, I really should recheck the liner notes). Somehow though, at least to me, “One More Time” has always felt more like a plea to be with the one they love more than a wish unfulfilled, and thus has never really felt overly sad. Either way though “One More Time” serves as a nice quiet storm before the closing track on disc one.\n\nFight – Disc one of my version of Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me ends with the staccato punch of “Fight”. “Fight” is not exactly a warm or happy song but it is defiant and affirmative which can give a sense of positive closure to the album. On the other hand, the fact that the song also has a darker mood and tone leaves the outcome of the struggle in some doubt. This serves to have “Fight” be a perfect bridge to my darker second disc of Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me. By placing “Fight” as the closing track of disc one and the transitional song between the lighter and darker halves of the double album it gives the impression that we are moving from happier, simpler times into a more troubled and conflicted space; into a darker place where the happier memories of before and our fighting spirit may or may not be enough to get us through.\n\nDISC 2: Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me (Darker Side)\n\nLike Cockatoos – The darker second disc of my Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me opens with the swirling winds and flocking birds of “Like Cockatoos” and it serves as the perfect ominous opening to my darker second disc of Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me. “Like Cockatoos” is a personal favorite that evokes (for me) images of dark Victorian nights, evil birds, Edgar Allan Poe, and Jack The Ripper\n\nIf Only Tonight We Could Sleep – One of The Cure’s more psychedelic songs, “If Only Tonight We Could Sleep” is a hazy, opiated ballad that drips languid melancholy. It is one of The Cure’s best slow songs (and The Cure are a band that has many excellent slow songs) and “If Only Tonight We Could Sleep” has a simmering and majestic dark power to it that has few peers. It isn’t the kind of song that would ever have been a hit single but it is a fan favorite and a live show favorite. It is also a perfect follow-up to “Like Cockatoos” for opening up this darker Kiss Me disc as both songs are sad and eerie, yet quite unique and diverse.\n\nHow Beautiful You Are – A song that potentially could have been a single “How Beautiful You Are” is a gorgeous and ultimately tragic song based on a French short story by Charles Baudelaire. The basic premise is that we can never really know the people we love deep inside and the song (and story) come to an incredibly bleak conclusion. That said, Robert Smith and company wrap this deeply sad tale in music so perfect that you can’t help but love the song even while hating the woman at its center (and by extension much of humanity). “How Beautiful You Are” is an excellent encapsulation of what The Cure do so well; finding beauty in bleakness and solace in the dark things of the world.\n\nShiver & Shake – “Shiver & Shake” finds The Cure trying their hand at an almost classic post-punk song. The song features wiry and jagged guitars over a driving bassline and percussion, while Robert Smith wails about the fury he feels toward another. While not necessarily the same protagonist as “How Beautiful You Are” it sure feels like an extension or coda to the end of that song where the shock and sadness of the protagonist has turned to disgust and rage.\n\nThe Snakepit – “The Snakepit” is an Arabesque-tinged track that is largely instrumental, slowly building up its sense of lurking, waiting danger. “The Snakepit” walks the line between a sense of dark lust and of impending disaster so expertly that it could be about an illicit lust-filled encounter, an impending danger such as terrorism, or losing the battle with ones own demons (or all of the above at once). Porl Thompson and Robert Smith’s guitars wind and wail throughout the song while Simon Gallup’s bass crawls underneath. It is a song that focuses on atmosphere and imagery as much as melodic hooks or narrative storytelling and is a masterpiece of mood.\n\nA Thousand Hours – Robert Smith throws as much emotion as possible into his vocals here and that alone saves “A Thousand Hours” from being a sort of Cure-by-numbers track. While never a personal favorite of mine it does point toward the sound and themes that would dominate The Cure’s next album Disintegration (although everything on that masterpiece would do it better) and serves as a nice moody ballad. There is nothing wrong with “A Thousand Hours”, The Cure just had just done this idea better before and would do so again. It is a nice musical break before the darker Kiss Me explodes into its next track.\n\nA Japanese Dream – Originally the B-side to the “Why Can’t I Be You?” single and not included on the original version of the album I have chosen to re-add it to my version of Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me. A distant sonic cousin to earlier songs like “The Hanging Garden”, “A Japanese Dream” uses a jagged, visceral guitar attack to grab the listeners attention. The guitars squall and slice all over the place like an explosion of glass shards and razor-wire, while tribal percussion pounds underneath alongside throbbing bass. Smith’s vocals are buried in the mix, giving them a distant, lost quality that serves almost a trance-like role and allows those guitars to be the center of the attack. It isn’t the best thing The Cure ever recorded but it is a unique sound and it deserves a place here.\n\nTorture – “Torture” is a song constructed in a very interesting way. It is a fairly heavy song but it creates that sound largely with bass and keyboards. This combination creates a sense of menace and impending doom that works well and fits the lyrical content, at least over the first half. Strangely though, “Torture” adds a punchy horn section to its final third that, I feel, undercuts the mood of the song. Thus, “Torture” is not my favorite Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me song, but it does fit in nice here on my version of the album.\n\nAll I Want – At one point I considered ending my new version of Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me with “All I Want” as the song has a sense of finality to it (and certainly ends in a way that would be a cool way to end an album). It is also a song that, while leaning toward obsession and desire, has a sense of commitment in the lyrics as well, which potentially could tie it to the themes and mood of the first disc as well. Ultimately though I went in a different direction to close the album but “All I Want” is a very good song that segues nicely from “Torture”.\n\nThe Kiss – “The Kiss” was the opening track from the original Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me but on my double album divided between the lighter and darker songs it works much, much better as the closing song of the darker Kiss Me disc and the double album as a whole. It also gives my version of the album a sense of connection both to each other and the album title since I opened the lighter themed first album with “Hey You!!!” which features the line the album title comes from and closed the darker disc with the roaring guitar fury of “The Kiss”. The kiss in question here may be one he wants badly but is also one that he knows may ruin him. Whether it is the same protagonist singing about kissing the same person as in “Hey You!!!” is open for interpretation, but if it is things have gone horribly wrong. All that said, “The Kiss” is a much better album closer than opener in my opinion and I love the way it ends this darker second disc and my re-imagined version Kiss Me, Kiss Me,Kiss Me.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
