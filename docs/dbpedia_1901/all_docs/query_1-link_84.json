        "text": "April 30, 1945\n\nMy Darling;\n\nToday it has been three years apart. I ache for you every day. I haven’t gotten a letter from you for several days. Deep sadness overcomes me each day I don’t receive one. I pray you haven’t grown tired of writing. I live for your letters. I long for every detail of your day and life back home.\n\nThe war will end soon. Everyone is sure of it. I can’t give my exact location as it will be censored, but I am in Germany. It is a wasteland. The towns are rubble, and the earth is scorched. German soldiers are surrendering. They know they are defeated. Surely the end of the war is close. I pray to God that I will make it home to you before very long.\n\nI have seen so many horrible things. Things no man should ever see. The only thing that keeps me sane is the thought of holding you in my arms once again and kissing your lips a thousand times.\n\nYour photograph is worn, but I look at it every day. I keep it next to my heart always.\n\nI long for nothing else but a normal life at home with you.\n\nI must go now. You are always on my mind and in my heart."
