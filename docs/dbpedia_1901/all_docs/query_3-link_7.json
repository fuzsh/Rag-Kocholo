        "text": "Wow that probably wins the topic for one of the lamest titles ever right?<BR><BR>Anyways I'm looking for a song that would be good to play in the background of a movie when two people who are in love kiss in front of a fountain .<BR><BR>The characters kissing are old friends from High School that ran into each other five years later in life. They are between 23-25 years of age.<BR><BR>If any more information is needed for suggestions, please let me know.<BR><BR><BR>I'd like something that has a nice romantic feel to it like \"Kiss Me\", but not something that has been used in every single movie every made.<BR><BR>I'm open to other types of songs as long as they have a similar feel to it. It doesn't have to be as \"mushy\" as \"Kiss Me\" : )<BR><BR>For those of you that might ask, yes I realize I have to get permission from the Label to use the song I decide on and yes I realize this costs a bit of money, thats not a concern right now, I'm just trying to get ideas for a song for this particular scene.\n\nHmm...do you want something equally upbeat?<BR><BR>Upbeat:<BR>\"Mouth\" by Meril Bainbridge might be a good one<BR><BR>\"Don't need the sunshine\" by Catatonia has a real movie feel to me, but may not be spot on what you are after.<BR><BR>\"I Love You(always forever)\" by Donna Lewis<BR><BR>\"Hanging by a moment\" by Lifehouse<BR><BR>\"Caugh up in you\" 38 special<BR><BR>\"This Kiss\" Faith Hill<BR><BR>\"At the beginning\" Richard Marx & Donna Lewis<BR><BR>\"Wish I was your lover\" by Sophie B Hawkins<BR><BR>\"Breathless\" The Corrs<BR><BR>Slower more ballad-y:<BR>\"I finally Found Someone\" Barbara Streisand and Bryan Adams<BR><BR>\"Angel Eyes\" Jeff Healy Band<BR><BR>\"Sway\" Bic Runga<BR><BR>\"Sometimes When We Touch\" Dan Hill<BR><BR>\"Fields of Gold\" cover by Eva Cassidy<BR><BR>Garth Brooks has a few that might work well. I can rattle those off if you like. <BR><BR>\"Hysteria\" Def Leppard<BR><BR>\"here without you\" 3 Doors Down<BR><BR>\"meet me halfway\" Kenny Loggins<BR><BR><BR> <BLOCKQUOTE class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote\"><font size=\"-1\">quote:</font><HR> The characters kissing are old friends from High School that ran into each other five years later in life. <HR></BLOCKQUOTE> <BR><BR>That description makes me think of \"Same Old Lang Syne\" by Dan Fogelberg, but the lyrics may not go that well.\n\nNot that some of these haven't been used, but maybe a few of these are what you're looking for:<BR><BR>Damage - Wonderful Tonight (remix of the Clapton one)<BR>Mariah Carey - Always Be My Baby<BR>Mariah Carey - Whenever You Call (instrumental)<BR>Mariah Carey - My All (instrumental preferably)<BR>Richard Marx - Right Here Waiting<BR>Righetous Brothers - Unchained Melody (ok, this one's been used a few times)<BR>Vanessa Williams & Bryan McKnight - Love Is<BR>K-ci & JoJo - All My Life <BR>K-ci & JoJo - Tell Me It's Real<BR>Boyz II Men - I'll Make Love to You<BR>Sade - By Your Side<BR>Shania Twain - You're Still The One<BR>Des'ree - I'm Kissing You (used in Romeo + Juliet)<BR>Selena - I Could Fall In Love<BR>Bangles - Eternal Flame<BR>Edwin McCain - I'll Be<BR>3 Doors Down - Be Like That (American Pie 2)<BR>Monica - For You I Will<BR>The Heights - How Do You Talk to an Angel<BR><BR>Ok, that's enough for now.\n\nGuys-<BR><BR>Thanks for all the replies so far. <BR><BR>I was also trying to find something that is a bit original since someone pointed out that \"Kiss Me\" has been in a lot of movies. Now I don't mind if we use something that has been in a few but this did get me thinking that \"Love Me\" has been in a ton of things.<BR><BR>God Bless Itunes preview option. : )<BR><BR>I'm just trying to map out some songs for certain scenes and this one was getting to me.<BR><BR>Coleman- You hit a good one with Sway, that's definetly a possibilty. The song by Dan Fogelberg is not anything like what we were looking for.<BR><BR>Thanks again and keep them coming...\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote\"><font size=\"-1\">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Coleman:<BR><BLOCKQUOTE class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote\"><font size=\"-1\">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by YodaNT:<BR><BR>Coleman- You hit a good one with Sway, that's definetly a possibilty.

It hasn't been in a ton, but Sway was in American Pie. <HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR><BR><BR>No worries. I didn't mean anything by the comment other than just trying to give everyone else a feel for what I'm looking for. <BR><BR>To add to the scene background. This is when the guy finally gets the girl. There first actual kiss after five years of waiting for the girl. <BR><BR>To put it mildy it's an important scene.<BR><BR>I'm just trying to get ideas for the moment. The music itself is a long way off, I'd just like to have some options down the road.<BR><BR>We are still working on the rehearsals : )\n\nHmmm I know the sound your after I think, more modern, but sorta tough, softish ballads are kinda out of musical favor right now.<BR><BR>Maybe one of these:<BR>\"In My Dreams\" REO Speedwagon<BR>\"I Get Weak\" or \"Mad About You\" Belinda Carlisle<BR>\"After All\" Cher & Peter Cetera<BR>\"Hearts Never Lie\" Tiffany and Chris Farren<BR>\"Mandolin Rain\" by Bruce Hornsby has the same sorta musical feel but isn't quite with the setting lyrically.<BR>\"Here We Are\" Gloria Estefan<BR>\"The Flame\" Cheap Trick<BR><BR>\"The Reason\" by Hoobastank might work.<BR>\"Wherever you will go\" by The Calling, might be too fast though.<BR>\"Why Can't I\" by Liz Phair?<BR>\"Somewhere out there\" Our Lady Peace\n\n<blockquote class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote\">\n\n<font size=\"-1\">quote:</font><hr>Originally posted by YodaNT:<br>Coleman- I gotta ask, how are you pulling these off so quickly? <hr>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<br><br>Just stuff in my CD collection. And I'm proud? Ashamed? to admit that I went through a phase when I was younger when I was very hooked on ballads. So coming up with them is mainly what's in my head and some quick looking through my CDs and mp3s. -- View image here: http://episteme.arstechnica.com/infopop/emoticons/icon_smile.gif --<br><br>you'd almost have to think it's coming out of my brain. I'd give good odds I'm the only person on Ars that knows that Tiffany duet, which is pretty good other then being a little sappy and having a synth keyboard instead of a piano(hey it was the 80s though, what are you gonna do). -- View image here: http://episteme.arstechnica.com/eve/ubb.x/ws/,s,50009562/images/biggrin_old.gif --\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote\"><font size=\"-1\">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by Stasis7:<BR>I know, I kid. I've actually read your script, you sent it to me a while back. <HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR><BR>I know you kid. : )<BR><BR>It's all good right.<BR><BR>p.s. It's been changed a bit. Not the concept some of the scenes were totally rewritten and a few lines of dialogue, it works a lot better than it did oh say 4 months ago.\n\nI was going to say <I>These Are Days</I> by 10,000 Manaics, but I think it's pretty overused in various places now that I stop to think.<BR><BR>Hey, they have a song called <I>How You've Grown</I>, I wonder how that sounds? The title is pretty aprops, but knowing Merchant it's about a baby growing up to be a crack whore or something.\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote\"><font size=\"-1\">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by scHarvey:<BR>If you're bringing up Hope Sandoval why not go straight to the source and pull out \"Fade into You\" or something? It's been used before, but not recently enough that people will relate it to another film. (that I can think of at least) <HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR><BR>Yeah, but mazzy star music tends toward melancholic, and so i was going for something a little more upbeat like the six pence song. <BR><BR>i have to admit that i don't much mazzy star, so i could be wrong.\n\n<blockquote class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote\">\n\n<font size=\"-1\">quote:</font><hr>Originally posted by SunRaven01:<br>I've got it, I've got it!<br><br>Against All Odds -- Phil Collins <hr>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n<br><br>I thought about that one too, but I think he's after less old music. Also although it's not in many movies, it is promptly featured in one movie that is shares a title with so....<br>probably doesn't fit lyrically too. -- View image here: http://episteme.arstechnica.com/infopop/emoticons/icon_smile.gif --\n\nHow about something way out there like<BR>Badly Drawn Boy - Easy Love<BR>The Bens - Just Pretend<BR>Bjork - It's Oh So Quiet<BR>The Thrills - Old Friend, New Lovers (the title is perfect)<BR><BR>I guess it depends on how their relationship ends up, or how you want to play the scene, but there's a shitload of different directions you could take it with just a little change in music. If you timed it right I think \"Oh So Quiet\" would be awesome.\n\n<BLOCKQUOTE class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote\"><font size=\"-1\">quote:</font><HR>Originally posted by YodaNT:<BR>Just out of curiosity, anyone know of anything like this by No Doubt or Bare Naked Ladies.<BR><BR>I realize their sound is totally different, but I'm just wondering. Any romantic type of song from either one of them? <HR></BLOCKQUOTE><BR><BR>I don't think BNL has anything that really fits. Old Apartment is the closest thing in my mind.<BR><BR>No Doubt has Don't Speak and Underneath It All for ballad type deals."
