        "text": "There was a 3lp version released in the UK in 1987 with a bonus disc, that could be what you owned.\n\nThe Cure - Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me\n\nSure it's not their best, but I still listen to it. A lot of great songs, and a fine album.\n\nPornography is The Cure how they were supposed to be. Very, very dark and gothic, but with plenty of beauty and psychedelia. I felt they kinda pulled back after that and went a touch more pop and mainstream again. That's not to say that they didn't do some absolutely amazing stuff afterward.\n\nI once heard Disintegration described as as 'the easy listening version of Pornography'. I think that's about right.\n\nI would say a song like “The Kiss” is far more similar to the feel of Pornography than anything on Disintegration?\n\nAt one point years ago I called it my favorite Cure album, but these days I can't sit through it all for some reason. It's certainly one of the most interesting moments in their catalogue, but its flow is maybe too disjointed?? I dunno... Great album, some fantastic songs within, but I think at this point it's my least favorite of their best albums.\n\n17 Secs has always truly been my favorite, I just never tire of that one. Front to back, at any time, can always sit through that one in full enjoyment.\n\nI never bonded with this album at the time but this thread inspired me to play the cassette for the first time in over 30 years. It's better than I remember! Only parts I didn't enjoy were the fake synth horns on \"Why Can't I Be You?\" and all of \"Hot Hot Hot !!!\". Standout track was \"All I Want\".\n\nI think that cassette had the longest fold-out insert of all time.\n\nKiss Me x 3 is a good album not great for me. The problem, imo, is the lack of cohesiveness. I like to listen to it in bits between their other greater albums. But Im a \"Faith\" diehard. I love the album and think it is overall the best Robert sang and the instrumentation is beautiful. I can find something of every The Cure album though that I like or love.\n\nThey were far and away my favourite band in my early-mid teens and my favourite Cure songs are all on KMKMKM, so on that basis it's my favourite album of theirs. Not sure whether it bests Disintegration, but it beats HOTD for me.\n\nI find Seventeen Seconds too embryonic, and Pornography just sounds drab to me these days. The trilogy was such a dead end sonically and lyrically. I much prefer the acid-informed colourful, twisted pop, and KMKMKM was the last time they managed to do that without embarrassing themselves.\n\nI agree. In fact, if I had to choose an album for a newcomer to the band to start with (that wasn't a greatest hits or best of) it would be that one.\n\n\"KMKMKM\" is their 1968 album. They had the wind in their sails (and their sales, as it goes) after a successful singles compilation and playing the biggest shows of their career off the back of THOTD. So, they did what any decent band would do and nipped off to a chateau in France to drink far too much wine and make a deliberately sprawling epic with far too many songs and no-one telling them when to stop. Late 60s hubris in the late 80s.\n\nSome of the comments in the thread suggest that the album needed that context to work and I broadly agree with this. In 1987, it was almost funny that this was what they'd chosen to release, although the single choices were spot on. Seen in review, it's just a bit too much, a bit too scattershot, a bit \"you left A Chain Of Flowers\" off the album but included *this*?\".\n\nThe best of it is still right up there with anything else they did in their first 15 years, a spectacular run that should be the envy of any young band. And, 35 years later, we're here talking about it.\n\nAgree with that.\n\nAnd they're still performing great shows and can really still cut it ,more to the point .\n\nI've always said that the best way to experience The Cure is to see them play live ,I saw them on every tour from Pornography to Wish and also never once saw them have an off night. ..they always delivered the goods .\n\nI personally lost interest after Disintegration ,for me the singles they were realeasing all started to sound too alike and too Pop for my tastes..their previous intensity was gone I felt .\n\nBut get out and see them perform while you still can ,that's when their music really shines and comes alive in my opinion."
