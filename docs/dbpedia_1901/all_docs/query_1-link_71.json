        "text": "The song \"Kiss Goodbye\" by Cody Johnson tells the story of a difficult decision that the narrator has to make. The lyrics describe a moment where the narrator is sitting in his truck, getting ready to pick up his partner. As he starts the ignition, he notices a keychain that was given to him by his partner, which symbolizes their love and commitment. The narrator realizes that he has to end the relationship, and the weight of this decision weighs heavily on him. He turns off the radio and drives down a familiar road, filled with memories of the times they've spent together. The gravel road and the raindrops seem to mirror the narrator's emotions, understanding the pain he is about to go through. Despite his love for his partner, he knows that he has to say goodbye. He wants to hold their hand one more time and feel their love, but he also knows that the next kiss will be their last. The narrator acknowledges that what he has to do is not more important than his partner, but it is something that must be done. He acknowledges that even he doesn't fully understand why he has to make this decision. As he arrives at his partner's house, he contemplates how everything is about to change and feels unsure of himself. But ultimately, the narrator knows that he has to go through with it. He reaches out to hold his partner's hand, embracing their love one last time. He presses their lips together and holds them tight, knowing that this will be their final kiss. He acknowledges that putting it off for another day won't make it any easier but seeing his partner cry will break his heart. In the end, the narrator embraces the reality that this \"kiss goodbye\" is inevitable. It signifies their final farewell, as painful as it may be. The song captures the emotions and inner turmoil of having to make a difficult decision that will greatly impact both individuals involved in the relationship."
