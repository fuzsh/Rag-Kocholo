        "text": "Platinum-selling artist Dermot Kennedy explores the captivating nature of intense love, in new single ‘Kiss Me’, the latest release from his highly anticipated upcoming album ‘Sonder’.\n\nWith support from Rolling Stone, The New York Times, and more, Irish singer-songwriter Dermot Kennedy has been widely recognised for his raw and compelling music. The former busker quickly rose to fame with his breakthrough single, ‘Outnumbered’, which peaked at number 6 on the Official Charts. Since then, Dermot has amassed over 4 billion collective streams, been nominated for ‘Best International Male’ at the 2020 BRIT Awards, and recently headlined Ireland’s Electric Picnic Festival, with a crowd of over 70,000 people.\n\nNew track ‘Kiss Me’ showcases the diversity of Dermot’s creative talents. The emotive single cleverly combines the New York-based artist’s captivating vocals and poignant lyricism, with a catchy hook-laden melody. Co-written by Dermot, Dan Smith (Bastille), KOZ (Kendrick Lamar, Dua Lipa) and Steve Mac (Pink, Ed Sheeran), the new track poetically describes how intense love can withstand life’s numerous challenges. This is cleverly represented in the accompanying ‘Kiss Me’ music video, which has already been viewed over 200,000 times. Directed by ABCDCD (Sparks, Franz Ferdinand), the cinematic piece depicts Dermot and his love interest in the back of a pickup truck which is slowly disintegrating, yet the couple remain solely focused on one another, seemingly transcending the state of disarray that surrounds them. Describing the video, Dermot states:\n\n“The message behind both the video and song of ‘Kiss Me’ is that love is worth it…Even when things are falling apart and life feels short and there’s chaos all around us, there’s still always something to hold on to.”\n\nAfter already unveiling his hit record ‘Better Days’, lead single ‘Something To Someone’, and piano-led track ‘Dreamer’, ‘Kiss Me’ is the fourth release from Dermot’s new album ‘Sonder’. The record, which comes out November 4th, has been summarised as “the realization that each random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own”.\n\nWith a forthcoming album, various upcoming performances across the UK and US, as well as the continuation of his busking sessions for charity, it seems that Dermot Kennedy will continue to be a renowned name within the music industry for the foreseeable future."
