If you looked into my eyes and knew that you loved me. I loved you, you left me. But baby please don't go. Slap me in the face, Make me bleed. If you're not going to stay with me, Then I might as well leave. {Chorus} Kiss me now, Make it last, Kiss me forever, Let it go. Kiss me now, Kiss me before I go"
