With overflowing eyes closed, on your cold, wet lips

Kiss me good-bye, this is the end, make me cry

I know this sad premonition, but the white mark on my neck

Kiss me good-bye, hold me sadly and make me cry

My voice breaks and dances in the wind, I'm so happy I want to cry

Kiss me good-bye, the last words make me cry

Embracing the moon, I wish everything would just disappear like this

Until the candle goes out, until my tears dry up, I want you to always be by my side, gazing at me, so much so that I crumble, so much so that I break, I want you to always be here, gazing at me

Embracing the moon, I wish everything would just disappear like this

I just need to stop time and close the curtain on our relationship

Until the candle goes out, until my tears dry up, I want you to always be by my side, gazing at me, so much so that I crumble, so much so that I break, I want you to always be here, gazing at me

Until the candle goes out, until my tears dry up, I want you to always be by my side, gazing at me, so much so that I crumble, so much so that I break, I want you to always be here, gazing at me
