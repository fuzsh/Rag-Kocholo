Presenting Dr. Michael D. Sallah

I had the pleasure of attending the University of Toledo commencement ceremony this morning and hearing Putlitzer Prize-winning journalist, author and friend Mike Sallah give the commencement speech. He did all journalists proud in his thoughtful and inspiring message stressing the importance of personal relationships as a journalist and in life.

We are proud of this Toledo native and UT grad who has fought the good fight for so many years, and received the well-deserved honor of a doctorate degree from his alma mater.

Way to go, Doctor Sallah!
