Teaching is not a profession that can be mastered but can continually be honed and improved through continued education which Kim pursues through multiple avenues including on campus programing and external activities. She focuses on continually improving pedagogy, accessibility, and course materials for classes she teaches and for other courses and labs in the department, hoping to spark curiosity in the students. Her goal is to repay the generosity and inspiration provided to her through her experiences at UW-W by paying it forward to the University and students through her teaching and service."
