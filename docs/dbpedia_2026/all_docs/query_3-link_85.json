        "text": "A University of Florida graduate who now writes for The Miami Herald won the Pulitzer Prize on Monday for a series of stories exposing the misuse of money in the county's housing department.\n\nDebbie Cenziper, a former editor-in-chief at The Independent Florida Alligator, was the lead reporter for \"House of Lies,\" which documented how developers misspent money targeted for affordable housing.\n\nCenziper said one of the biggest challenges to reporting the story was finding out where the money was going. She said the housing agency was not tracking the money, so it took her three months and researching 300 people to figure out where the money was going.\n\nFor example, a developer received $1.7 million to build 54 houses, but instead built an estate for his family. He has since been arrested.\n\nWhile Cenziper said she doesn't like to see anyone go to jail, she said she enjoyed the outpouring of community support.\n\n\"It felt really, really good to see the community's reaction to this project,\" she said.\n\nThis kind of reaction is what got Cenziper hooked on journalism in the first place. Cenziper was an editor at The Alligator during the fall of 1990 and spring of 1991.\n\nDuring her tenure, a pharmacist was not filling legitimate prescriptions for the morning-after-pill because of his personal beliefs, she said. She sent the copy desk chief undercover with a prescription to see if it was true. Cenziper said the copy desk chief wrote about it and as a result the pharmacist was fired.\n\nIt was the first time Cenziper said she got to know the impact journalism can have.\n\nMichael Sallah, the editor of the series and investigation editor for The Miami Herald, said he picked Cenziper to be the lead reporter because of her passion and ability to handle spreadsheet data. \"She's just a phenomenal reporter,\" he said."
