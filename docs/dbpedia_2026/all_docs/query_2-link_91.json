        "text": "is paper aims at presenting the conclusions drawn from a systematic review of the studies conducted among Polish journalists since the 1970s. By comparing results of the studies on journalists with expectations and attitudes of current Polish journalism students, the paper o ers an insight into the ongoing changes that have been observed among Polish journalists in the last four decades. In particular, the review revealed signi cant changes in a demographic pro le of Polish journalists regarding gender, education, and employment, as well as their motivation to work in the profession. Furthermore, professional values of journalism in Poland have been slightly shi ing from a traditional pro le of a social educator and watchdog to new ones, such as a news provider.\n\nThe presented research is designed to compare the contents of Gazeta Wyborcza Wrocław and Gazeta Wroclawska on issues related to the city of Wroclaw. Although it is focused on regional daily newspapers, only local news from Wroclaw is analyzed. The formation process of materials for the local market can point at certain dissimilarities in the editing of Gazeta Wyborcza Wroclaw and Gazeta Wrocławska. The analysis of the press materials connotes a list of issues that appear most often in newspaper's agendas, and highlights those which are being omitted. This is a matter which helps to judge whether local politics can be a frequent subject of press materials and how often journalists tend to write about political events. The analysis of articles helps to state whether journalists tend to quote their sources of information and whether there is a domination of editorial content. How often do journalists use user-generated content to create articles? At the end of article several differences and resemblances existing during editions of Gazeta Wyborcza Wroclaw and Gazeta Wrocławska are pointed out.\n\nThis essay offers a summary of the history of literary journalism in Poland. Taking into account a specific national literary history, it shows the historical roots of literary journalism (known in Poland also as literary reportage), its development and evolution. Aiming to fill in a significant gap in existing research on literary journalism, the article explores the popularity of the genre in Poland. The article focuses on the meaning of the so-called Polish School of Reportage, shows its founding members, predecessors and successors, and discusses four famous theoretical debates concerning the use of facts and the abuse of fiction in Poland's literary journalism. Along with investigating the split of literary journalism studies into journalism studies and literature studies, the article also touches upon the different educational paths of practicing reporters and theorists of the genre. The article concludes by postulating that literary journalism studies be united and established as a separate academic discipline.\n\nThe article provides the results of an extensive survey conducted within a group of journalists working for the media having nationwide coverage. The aim of the research was to acquire knowledge about the values, professional standards and priorities of Polish journalists. To achieve this goal, not only questions about their demographic profile were asked, but also questions regarding their sense of autonomy, structure of employment, membership of journalistic organisations as well as the main aspects of their professional activity, level of job satisfaction and functions of the media. The results prove, inter alia, that the vast majority of Polish journalists are young and well-educated. On the other hand, they seem not to be interested in any form of professional integration. Furthermore, the transformation of the media system highly influenced the structure of employment in some media sectors. As the results of the study show, the structure of employment often affects the manner in which journalists view their workplace. Political, economic and social transformations of the media, observed in Poland since the 1990s, have been accompanied by profound changes within the journalistic environment. Hence, this group is the focus of researchers interested in the specificity of Polish journalism and the role of the local, regional and national media. However, the vast majority of previous analyses of the situation of journalism in Poland were either of a descriptive nature or carried out by means of qualitative methods. Furthermore, each subsequent survey research was conducted primarily among employees of the local and regional media, and only few included journalists working for the media of a national scope. In the 1980s and 1990s, such studies were carried out by, inter alia, Zbigniew Bajka of the Jagiellonian University 1. Their results presented not only the demographic profile of journalists, but also career choice motives, expectations and values which guided them a decade ago. Meanwhile, the research on local journalists was focused mainly on identifying challenges and problems that\n\nThe article presents and illustrates the substantial changes that occurred in local media in Poland during the social and political transformation. The authors begin with the outline of tendencies in the development of local media after 1989, presenting the factors that promoted changes in this segment of the media, and identifying the main phases of transformations in local media. Local press is the segment of local media that changed the most: in the 1990s, the number of local titles grew rapidly, and their circulations dropped, publishing companies were diversified, and new types of local press appeared. The development and changes in the market of electronic media were connected with the process of granting licences by the National Broadcasting Council, the expansion of commercial broadcasters, and the progressing process of ownership consolidation. Local radio prevailed over local television in the transformation period. There were also changes in the group of local journalists: their number grew rapidly, local editorial teams became younger, and journalists had lower education levels and less professional preparation.\n\nDigital libraries provide an easy and convenient source of data for journalistic academic research. In this paper, the author answers the question of whether the most well-known socio-political Polish press titles published between 1918 and 1939 are available online and to what extent they are fully digitised and accessible in digital libraries. Through media content analysis and the press content analysis methods of Walery Pisarek, all the digital resources available for an ordinary Internet user were browsed. The main role of the analysis was to establish which journals and periodicals were published weekly and as daily newspapers. Also, the nature and political leanings of press publications were taken into consideration (each press title was usually associated with a particular party). At the same time, the texts were profiled as regional, national, Catholic, etc. Finally, an attempt to develop a typology of the given titles is made."
