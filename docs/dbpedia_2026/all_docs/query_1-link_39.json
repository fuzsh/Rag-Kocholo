        "text": "The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette is looking for a Deputy Investigations Editor to join our award-winning I-Team and further elevate our critically important mission of providing groundbreaking watchdog reporting. Over the past four years, we have made major strides toward increasing our impact in the community and region with our investigative work, and our goal now is to take accountability reporting to a higher level by bolstering the size and scope of the team.\n\nThe deputy editor of the I-Team would work under the supervision of the Deputy Managing Editor/Investigations, and play a lead role across the newsroom, helping to conceptualize, launch, and execute deeply reported enterprise stories as well as raising the PG standard for investigative reporting.\n\nThe I-Team is responsible for one of the most important functions of the news organization: journalism that holds the powerful accountable, exposes corruption, government missteps and overreach, and ultimately contributes to the well-being of the community.\n\nSome of the stories bubble up from the daily news report, and to that end, the deputy would be expected to help identify those pieces that warrant deeper dives and may require more time than the News Desk is able to provide.\n\nThe deputy would work with the Deputy ME/Investigations and other editors (News, Data and beyond) to look for ways those stories can best be executed with the help of data, photo, graphics and interactives.\n\nAs a player/coach, the deputy would be expected to help lead some of these stories as an editor, a reporter, or both, working with News Desk reporters or members of the I-Team. Enterprise stories — those that go beyond the surface to expose and explain — can typically take the team as long as two months to execute or just a couple of weeks in some cases.\n\nThe deputy would be given a wide berth to look for team stories and help our data team carry out FOIA and Pennsylvania Right-to-Know efforts and pull in important records for future work.\n\nThe deputy would be in a key position to mentor reporters and help teach the rudiments of the craft, including the crucial importance of public records, carrying out key interviews, bullet-proofing stories, and crafting the investigative story.\n\nRequirements:\n\n· Minimum of 5 years of journalism experience as an editor or investigative reporter preferred\n\n· Minimum of 5 years of management experience supervising reporters, editors, visual and digital news teams\n\n· Exceptional ability to write and edit breaking news, enterprise, deep-dive projects; data skills a plus\n\n· A proven track record of sound news judgment and editing skills, an audience-centered and digital first acumen, and proven execution at the highest levels\n\n· A firm grasp and knowledge of the Pittsburgh region’s major issues or an established track record of quickly adapting to a new geographic area\n\n· Robust management skills, an eye for editorial talent, a commitment to diversity and inclusion, and a track record of developing journalists\n\n· The highest journalistic and legal standards and a track record of sound ethical decision-making\n\nOther Things to Know:\n\n· Competitive salary and benefits package\n\n· We encourage everyone to apply who shares our passion for indispensable journalism and our drive to create a sustainable business model to support it.\n\n· As an equal opportunity employer, the Post-Gazette is committed to fostering a diverse and inclusive culture, and we encourage members of underrepresented communities to apply, including women, people of color, LGBTQ people, and people with special needs"
