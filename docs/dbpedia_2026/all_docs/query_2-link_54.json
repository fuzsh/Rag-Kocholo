The New Ethics of Journalism: Principles for the 21st Century focuses intensely on the role that journalism plays in our society, a role that remains urgent and unique even as so much changes in the profession and in the business of journalism, as well as in our global society. It remains imperative that those who practice journalism strive for excellence and aspire to high ethical standards, regardless of systemic structural changes in media, increasingly fickle and cynical news consumers, and sharp scrutiny from a wide range of critics. The essays published here matter because the public must have confidence in the integrity of the journalistic process and the credibility of the product, even more as journalism is being redefined and recreated in real time. This book represents another chapter in the decades-long effort by The Poynter Institute to address important issues of journalism ethics. It was my great privilege to be part of Poynter for nearly 20 years as we taught, advised and guided thousands of journalists and hundreds of news organizations and wrote extensively about ethics and values. The New Ethics of Journalism: Principles for the 21st Century continues that Poynter commitment. The book’s editors, Kelly McBride and Tom Rosenstiel, are two of the sharpest minds I know. With this project, they bring their considerable experience, expertise and intellectual energy together with a group of thoughtful, provocative essayists who explore and expound on what journalism can be and should be in the midst of this extreme transformation. The editors and the essayists in this collection generally write with optimism. That’s appropriate, although it would be unwise and unrealistic to minimize the chaos of the recent years and the profound 9\n\nconsequences. We should recognize the continuing peril even as we see promise ahead. The traditional economic models for the business of journalism have been badly battered and often shattered. New models are emerging, but we are still years away from stability. Some approaches are financially promising and respect ethical, excellent journalism. However, other illconceived business decisions savage essential ethical and journalistic values and fail to serve the public good. At the same time, the technology for gathering, processing and delivering news keeps developing at seemingly warp speed, creating dynamic possibilities but too often producing distorted coverage and diminished quality. In this period of intense adaptation, journalists and news executives are employing digital tools and creating innovative content with varying degrees of exuberance and alarm, skill and stupidity. The information needs, desires and behaviors of the public are also shifting, sometimes dramatically. Those who practice and produce journalism must pay attention to what the marketplace dictates and to what consumers demand as they participate in the creation and distribution of journalism. Yet there is danger, too, as we rely increasingly on social networks and algorithms to deliver important information. Journalists must continue to cover unpopular topics and tell stories that don’t draw the most eyeballs. Despite the vagaries of a “most viewed stories” popularity contest, we must honor the fundamental duty to report accurate, fair, substantive and indispensable information while surviving in the marketplace. Journalism cannot be judged exclusively by the same bottom-line financial criteria as other commercial products. The old adage of reporting the news “without fear or favor” retains value, whether it’s vigorous coverage of contentious issues or courageous decisions that insulate against outside pressures that could compromise journalistic independence. Journalism has a special role in society, serving the public good like no other business or profession. Journalism has an obligation to support the democratic process by informing and educating. Journalism has a responsibility to give citizens meaningful information so they can better understand the issues in their communities and beyond, make good decisions in their daily lives and effectively carry out their civic duty. This anthology spotlights the ethical challenges that constantly arise for 10\n\nthose reporting and sharing the news. Some of these challenges have existed for decades. Some ethical issues are new, or at least have a new shape or different shade to them reflecting all that is changing in this era. At Poynter, we’ve written extensively about the core values of accuracy and fairness, often praising sound ethical decision-making and excellent journalism and many times spotlighting flaws and failures. In our seminars, we’ve used hundreds of case studies to examine ethics concerns with confidential sources, conflicts of interest, invasion of privacy, deception and fabrication. We’ve helped journalists recognize the ethical potholes and pitfalls that always emerge in covering politics, natural disasters and wars. Believing that guidelines are more meaningful than rigid rules, we’ve written protocols for covering suicide, school violence, racial tensions and much more. The emergence of digital technology and the evolution of the role of journalism—including much more active participation by the public—has intensified some of the traditional ethical challenges and created new ones. Think about the role social networks like Twitter and Facebook now play in the coverage of civil unrest in our communities and in countries around the globe. Recognize the challenges that exist for news organizations when facts, photos and audio of breaking news stories come from citizens rather than staff journalists, raising concerns about sourcing, authenticity and fairness. Consider the looser editing standards that often exist with a “digital first” philosophy that emphasizes speed over verification, with content that goes public and potentially viral without effective front-end checks and balances. The essays, the case studies and the accompanying questions explore the value and values of journalism and the complex relationship between journalists and those they serve. This book identifies and champions the guiding principles that can inspire and influence those who practice journalism. It offers reasoned reflection for individuals and news organizations to set strategy and to use in making sound ethical decisions built on the values of expertise, knowledge, commitment, courage, independence, transparency, and accountability. I don’t agree with every position or proposal in this book, nor will you. Journalism ethics inevitably creates contention. However, we gain insight from the probing essays even as we challenge some ideas they present. I’m confident you will sharpen your thinking as you work through the dynamic case studies and grapple with the analytical questions that follow each 11\n\nessay. My hope is that this book will remind you how vital and valuable journalism is in our society, imperfect though it is. I also hope you will be inspired to take action to make journalism even better.\n\n12\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nT\n\nhis book has a thousand authors, and really more. Yes, there are two editors, 14 named authors, a case study writer and the man behind the foreword. You’ll find their biographies in the back of this volume. But many more have influenced these pages. All those who have worked to innovate—who have tested new technologies, who have experimented with new ways to tell stories and deliver journalism—have had a hand in shaping the ideas found here. If you’ve been to a seminar at The Poynter Institute or a Committee of Concerned Journalists workshop, if you’ve phoned in for advice, or shared your triumphs and failures on Poynter.org, then you too helped write this book. Especially if you were there in New York at our symposium in October 2012, you influenced this book. We want to specifically acknowledge a handful of people who help us out by keeping us informed, sharing their knowledge and experience with us, and taking our calls when we need advice. They include David Folkenflik of NPR; Brian Stelter, Sewell Chan and David Carr of The New York Times; Eric Wemple of The Washington Post; Amanda Michel of The Guardian; Vivian Schiller of NBC; Drew Curtis of Fark; Alexis Ohanian of Reddit; David Boardman of the Seattle Times; and Jennifer 8. Lee of everywhere. This book is in part the collective work of The Poynter Institute, where almost everyone on staff had some role. Specifically, the support and encouragement of President Karen Dunlap and Dean Stephen Buckley were instrumental. Paul Tash, chairman and CEO of Times Publishing, opened some important doors. Other key players include Jessica Blais, Nafi Sallah, Ann Madsen, Butch Ward, Bobbi Alsina, David Shedden, Maria James, Jennette Smith and the amazing Foster Barnes. So, too, are we indebted to the staff of the Pew Research Center, whose intelligence and integrity sustained one of the editors of this book for many years and on whose data and insight we, like so many others, rely. In particular, Mark Jurkowitz, Scott Keeter, Michael Dimock, Carroll Doherty and Lee Rainie deserve special thanks. So, too, does our good friend, Paul Taylor. And, of course, two people above all with whom Tom 13\n\nworked most closely and for so long, Andy Kohut and Amy Mitchell. The ideas here are also influenced by the unerring friendship of Bill Kovach, who has always understood journalism more deeply than most, and by the late James Carey, who explored the idea of communications as culture and journalism as community and conversation decades before those phrases were ever typed by someone imagining the digital age. We owe a great deal, more than we could ever repay, to Julie Moos, who jumped into the churn to save us from ourselves, organizing the final editing efforts, serving as a our backstop and our unflinching critic. Her name should be on the cover. In turn, Mallary Tenore carried a tremendous load at Poynter Online so Julie could help with the editing of this book. Kelly would like to personally thank Charisse Kiino at CQ Press, for not letting this book die, the first, second or third time it was on life support. Matthew Byrnie at Sage Publishing inherited this book without complaint, and among those helping out were Gabrielle Piccininni, editorial intern; Stephanie Palermini, production editor; Jacqueline Tasch, copy editor; and Liz Thornton, marketing manager. Tom also thanks his family, who excused yet again his absences as he disappeared to work on this, and his new colleagues at the American Press Institute and the Newspaper Association of America. Thank you, Caroline. And Kelly thanks her children, Molly, Clarke and Maggie Jacobson, for stepping up and her boyfriend Kyle Parks for stepping in. None of this would have been possible without the support of several organizations. In addition to Poynter, Pew and the Committee for Concerned Journalists, we found support from the Ford Foundation, the Knight Foundation and The Paley Center for Media, who gave us an enthusiastic yes when we asked if they would host a symposium with us in October 2012. There we publicly tested the ideas you will find in this book, and videos of that day are online at Paley’s website. Specifically, we treasure the involvement of J. Max Robins, Joel Topcik and Marisa Laureni. Vadim Lavrusik of Facebook, Andrew Heyward formerly of CBS News, Emily Bell of the Columbia Journalism School and John Paton of Digital First Media all played a significant role that day. Finally, we need to offer up a loud and clear thank you to Craig Newmark of craigconnects.org. Without his generosity, the New York gathering could not have happened. Along with his project director, 14\n\nJonathan Bernstein of Bernstein Crisis Management, Newmark turned out to be one of the best partners ever. His involvement allowed us to build upon a project that was already in progress, making it stronger and extending our reach. Thanks, Craig!\n\n15\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nNew Guiding Principles for a New Era of Journalism Kelly McBride and Tom Rosenstiel\n\nO\n\nne of the fundamental challenges facing journalism in the 21st century is what ethics should guide the production of news. When people discuss ethics in journalism, the conversation tends to get stuck between two polar impulses: to cling to tradition so tightly we resist progress, on the one hand, and to throw away the most important values in journalism and charge blindly ahead thinking everything has changed on the other. We consider this a false choice. The digital age has transformed how journalism is created and delivered. Certainly, we must change the ethical decision-making that supports that. Just as certainly, however, some guiding stars remain. Journalists, for instance, cannot give up dedication to truth and accuracy on behalf of the public, but they must find new ways to fulfill that commitment. This book is not an attempt to predict the future or mourn what’s been lost. Nor does it try to deny what has changed or declare all that came before obsolete. Rather, it is an attempt to look at what is happening in journalism in the early part of the 21st century, to define and articulate new tensions that challenge journalism’s core principles, and to suggest practices that further truth and community in service of democracy. To do this, we asked different thinkers about contemporary journalism to draft essays on what we identified as key issues. Then, we gathered in New York and worldwide via the Web a larger group of journalism observers to help contemplate the ideas presented by our essayists. We distilled all of this into organizing principles, and we went back to work 16\n\nalong with the writers to refine those ideas. This book of essays, and the organizing principles outlined in this first chapter, is the fruit of that labor. This is not the first time The Poynter Institute has tried to help distill core principles of journalism into a book on ethics. In the early 1990s, the institute developed Guiding Principles for Journalists. Those principles were simple by design, organized under three concepts: Truthfulness, Independence and Minimize Harm. That work was led by Bob Steele, the author of the foreword to this book. This book builds on the shoulders of that work. All of those principles remain vital and are resident here. The new list of ethical principles mainly elevates two concepts that have been expanded by the digital age. Transparency, which was always a part of truth seeking, is now its own principle because it is so essential a part of how modern journalism attains credibility. Community, which may have been taken for granted in an age when the press had a monopoly on the audience, is the new third principle. It was always the final purpose of journalism, even if it seemed somewhat remote when the audience was a more silent partner in the transaction of news. Now journalism is enriched, and made more relevant, by the range of voices and expertise of the community—even if its production has been made more complex. It may be years before journalism settles into economic stability and we know what shape that will take. Yet as the invention and adoption of new technologies continues to accelerate, it is clear journalism will come from varied sources—from many smaller and a few large for-profit organizations (although maybe not as large as they used to be), small nonprofits, citizen initiatives and the work of lone individuals and passionate advocates. Journalism may come from think tanks, even corporate sources. Journalism in the United States may eventually come to rely more on government subsidy. The concept of journalists as clearly independent of those they cover will be more complex because the opening of the information system to all means those who make the news will also cover it. When anyone can make journalism, it becomes even more important that its production be ethical and that the community be able to recognize and identify when it is and isn’t. In whatever form, we all have a stake in the survival of reliable journalism. Without it, democracy fails. The powerful will be less accountable and more likely to abuse their influence. The public will be more at risk. Social problems will go unspotted and unaddressed. 17\n\nInformation that a few want hidden will remain in the shadows longer. Journalists and those who value journalism are in the midst of a great diaspora. They are packing up the remnants of a belief system and carrying it forward to new places, where those pieces will evolve into a new foundation. This is not an easy or painless journey. At the same time, it is impossible to deny the exciting possibilities presented by the changes that have already occurred. This book was conceived more than four years ago at the dawn of the worst of the economic upheaval that unmoored so many professional newsrooms. You are finally seeing it now because it was only recently that we in the profession have been able to see a few years into the future and accept that journalism will never return to its past economic state. We begin this book then by looking ahead, with a new set of Guiding Principles for Journalists, which meld the core values of journalism with the democratic values of the digital era. 1. Seek truth and report it as fully as possible. • Be vigorous in your pursuit of accuracy. • Be honest, fair and courageous in gathering, reporting and interpreting information. • Give voice to the voiceless; document the unseen. • Hold the powerful accountable, especially those who hold power over free speech and expression. • Be accountable. 2. Be transparent. • Show how the reporting was done and why people should believe it. Explain your sources, evidence and the choices you made. Reveal what you cannot know. Make intellectual honesty your guide and humility (rather than false omniscience) your asset. • Clearly articulate your journalistic approach, whether you strive for independence or approach information from a political or philosophical point of view. Describe how your point of view impacts the information you report, including how you select the topics you cover and the sources that inform your work. • Acknowledge mistakes and errors, correct them quickly and in a way that encourages people who consumed the faulty information to know the truth. 18\n\n3. Engage community as an end, rather than as a means. • Make an ongoing effort to understand the needs of the community you seek to serve and create robust mechanisms to allow members of your community to communicate with you and one another. • Seek out and disseminate competing perspectives without being unduly influenced by those who would use their power or position counter to the public interest. • Recognize that good ethical decisions require individual responsibility enriched by collaboration. • Seek publishing alternatives that minimize the harm that results from your actions and be compassionate and empathetic toward those affected by your work. • Allow and encourage members of the community to self-inform. Make journalism a continuing dialogue in which everyone can responsibly take part and be informed. If you compare these principles to those that were originally drafted at Poynter in the 1990s and subsequently adopted by numerous newsrooms and professional organizations, including the Society of Professional Journalists, you will notice many similarities and some significant differences. But nothing has vanished. That original list looked like this: 1. Seek truth and report it as fully as possible • Inform yourself continuously so you in turn can inform, engage and educate the public in a clear and compelling way on significant issues. • Be honest, fair and courageous in gathering, reporting and interpreting accurate information. • Give voice to the voiceless. • Hold the powerful accountable. 2. Act independently. • Guard vigorously the essential stewardship role a free press plays in an open society. • Seek out and disseminate competing perspectives without being unduly influenced by those who would use their power or position counter to the public interest. 19\n\n• Remain free of associations and activities that may compromise your integrity or damage your credibility. • Recognize that good ethical decisions require individual responsibility enriched by collaborative efforts. 3. Minimize harm. • Be compassionate for those affected by your actions. • Treat sources, subjects and colleagues as human beings deserving of respect, not merely as means to your journalistic ends. • Recognize that gathering and reporting information may cause harm or discomfort, but balance those negatives by choosing alternatives that maximize your goal of truth telling. Truth is still the greatest value, the first among equals. Seeking and reporting truth is the primary function of journalism. And yet, so much has changed, including how one would identify truth and disseminate it with authority. The first section of this book focuses on our ability to discern the truth (essays by Clay Shirky and Roy Peter Clark), identify truth in political speech (Steve Myers), and tell the truth in stories (Tom Huang) and images (Kenneth Irby). Where we once argued for independence, we now advocate transparency. Independence is a part of that principle, and we still believe in its essential value. But we recognize that journalism in the future will take many more forms and will intertwine with the proliferation of opinion in the digital marketplace—the two no longer so easy to distinguish. Journalism with a point of view can be just as powerful as work that starts from a position of neutrality. Both can and do move people to democratic action. Both can seek truth. The test is in how the journalism is produced —not necessarily who produces it. The transparency that we urge in these guiding principles demands that the public see how the journalism of the future is produced and calls for an openness that encourages constant conversation between journalist and citizen, newsroom and community. As a principle, transparency will drive journalists to actions and accountability that independence did not. A transparent news organization will approach its work with greater self-awareness, recognizing how its business model impacts the topics and types of stories it considers news. Transparent journalists will strive for intellectual honesty and integrity in every step of their work, acknowledging where they get their ideas and 20\n\nhow they sort the relevant from the irrelevant. Transparent journalists and news organizations will embrace the practice of corrections across platforms. In the second section of the book, we move from the outside in as we look at this issue of transparency. We start with an exploration of the competing values between journalism and the private platforms that increasingly deliver journalism (Dan Gillmor). Sticking with private platforms, we look at the revelatory value of the data that grows out of those platforms (Gilad Lotan). Finally, we move inside newsrooms, looking at evolving funding models (Adam Hochberg), the intellectual habits of reporters (Ann Friedman) and the methods journalists use to correct their mistakes (Craig Silverman). The principle of transparency informs not just how we judge our conflicts of interest, but how we tell the story of journalism itself. The stories created by journalists rely heavily on systems like social media platforms, outside of our control, yet suddenly crucial to the marketplace of ideas. Journalists must be dedicated enough to the notion of transparency to examine these systems and help communities hold them accountable for their incredible power. We have enlarged the principle of minimizing harm into a principle of engaging community. Journalists still have a moral obligation to seek alternatives that minimize the harm they cause. But that duty is not an abstract notion. Instead, minimizing harm is part of a greater contract with the members of a community that journalists serve and the sources they tap into to tell stories. It is a promise to act in the interests of informing a community and upholding democracy, acknowledging that the community itself has a substantial ability to contribute to the conversation. By elevating respect for the community, we note that journalistic decisions cannot be made in a vacuum. Instead, these values guide us toward an ethic of diversity (Eric Deggans). They help us resist the temptation to manipulate through fear and sensationalism (Kelly McBride and danah boyd). Together, the values of truth and transparency are interpreted in relation to a specific community and the common good (Steven Waldman and Mónica Guzmán.) These essays are written by individuals who were invited into the process because of their different perspectives and experiences. Each speaks with a distinct voice and tone. At the end of each chapter is a workshop meant to root the ideas of the essay in a contemporary 21\n\napplication. These can be used in a newsroom, classroom, or discussion group to make clear the new trends and ethical challenges, which evolve as quickly as journalism itself. Poynter’s efforts in the 1980s were hardly the first to imagine the ethics or responsibilities of the press or the last. If one were to look at other work from the 1940s on—from the Hutchins Commission or the Society of Professional Journalists or Committee of Concerned Journalists—one would be struck by the similarities of the efforts. Each has informed the other. Nor do we pretend to have all of today’s answers, so when you’ve completed this short book, we don’t expect you will have all the answers either. We hope instead that you will be a more informed, active participant in shaping the critical conversation about how to produce journalism and consume it in the 21st century. For the principles that guide ethical decision-making in the production of news to have meaning, they need to be thought through anew by each generation in its new circumstances. That is the process of renewal and the point of rigorous self-reflection. Only then is journalism a vibrant and a living exercise on behalf of the public.\n\n22\n\nPART 1\n\nThe Complicated Pursuit of Truth\n\nINTRODUCTION Kelly McBride and Tom Rosenstiel Telling the truth has always been the simplest and most complicated function of journalism. That critical but elusive task starts with describing what happened, sometimes based on a reporter’s own eyewitness account (the first of the Twin Towers collapsed into a cloud of smoke and debris at 9:59 a.m. on Sept. 11, 2001), more often based on the accounts of others (when the tsunami hit East Asia in 2004, few if any journalists were present), and, in the case of investigative work, after the journalist has assembled enough accounts, documents and other evidence to declare something of significance with authority (the U.S. government deceived the American people about its early involvement in Vietnam and miscalculated and mismanaged the war, according to the Pentagon Papers). When asked to consider the question philosophically, journalists sometimes struggle to articulate what they do. Are they capable of more than accuracy? We can point to exposés and analyses and answer: yes. Truth emerges not only in a single story but also in the sorting out that occurs over time as different accounts probe an event and its implications. This form of journalistic or practical truth is a living, continuing process, as co-editor Tom Rosenstiel and his colleague, Bill Kovach, have described it. Journalism also may lend itself to some kinds of truths more easily than others. The media are on firmer footing, for instance, identifying what words the president said or how many people died in a fire than they are in describing the motivations that drive the people in the news. Nonetheless, while acknowledging that getting the facts right remains 23\n\njournalism’s core function—and that includes trying to get at “the truth about the fact,” as the Hutchins Commission put it in 1947—much of how we discern and articulate the truth is changing. This section’s first two authors, Clay Shirky and Roy Peter Clark, explore two dimensions of a long-standing debate: the degree to which truth is ascertainable. They propose somewhat differing answers to the questions of how society knows what the truth is, how we designate truthtellers and how technology and new forms of communication have impacted our ability to arrive at consensus. Together, they describe the spectrum of truth that journalism covers and how the process of fixing on truth on that spectrum is made both more challenging and richer today. The demands on journalists are higher. So is the need for journalism that goes beyond the stenographic task of simply describing the public argument. Tom Huang then analyzes the principal means by which journalists have tried to describe truth: the story, which is being transformed by digital technology. Huang’s essay offers a disciplined tour through the virtues and challenges of the main new storytelling forms possible today. In the essays that follow, Steve Myers and Kenny Irby look at two even more precise developments in journalism’s pursuit of truth: the growth of the fact-checking movement and the changing role that photographic storytelling plays in our understanding of the world. These five chapters, arranged from the more abstract (Shirky and Clark) to the more specific (Huang, Myers and Irby), remind us that truth, at least as it relates to journalism, is not the same as meaning. We might, for instance, know who won the election, or even what occurred in a tragic school shooting. What it means to us is something more individual. On some level, journalism commands our attention because it tells us what to think about: what is new, what is changing, even perhaps what is important. But it does not, nor has it ever, tell us what to think. As you read these essays, you will undoubtedly draw connections of your own to other phenomena occurring in journalism and the wider world of communications. Just as surely, the rapid pace of change will continue to alter the way we seek truths and tell stories.\n\n24\n\nchapter 1 Truth without Scarcity, Ethics without Force Clay Shirky\n\nT\n\nhe first item in the Society for Professional Journalist’s Ethics Guide is “Seek truth and report it.” This seems simple enough, yet the contemporary media environment has seen a dramatic increase in spurious claims about everything from hydraulic fracturing to the funding of Medicare to the president’s birthplace and religious affiliation. With the Internet opening the floodgates to ideological actors of all persuasions, the exhortation to seek truth and report it seems less widely practiced than ever. The Internet’s effect on our respect for the truth has been frequently discussed in the last decade, in books such as Republic.com and True Enough: Learning to Live in a Post-Fact Society and in any number of essays over the years. As an exemplar, The Atlantic ran a piece just before the last elections called “Truth Lies Here,” which suggested that the Internet, by allowing us to pick and choose what we listen to, is corroding our shared commitment to facts.1 “Truth Lies Here” included the usual high points: the Daniel Patrick Moynihan quote (“Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts”), the observation that news consumers are replacing professional editors with our friends as arbiters of news, and frustrated wonderment that so many Americans have been willing to make, and so many media outlets willing to report, basic errors of fact, like the notion that President Obama is a Muslim. This “post-fact” literature is certainly on to something; the Internet is 25\n\nchanging the conditions under which ordinary citizens are willing to regard any given statement as true. There comes a moment, however, when anyone making this case has to employ what journalist William Safire used to call a “but of course” paragraph, a brief nod to a possible counterargument before setting it aside. In the Atlantic, the “but of course . . . ” was this: None of this is to argue that we should—or could—return to the old order, wherein The Times or Walter Cronkite issued proclamations on the credibility and import of news from around the world.\n\nThis yearning for mainstream concurrence without cultural dominance is what gives that lament for lost consensus its poignant feel since these two desires are mutually exclusive. It’s not as if, in the mid-20th century, we Americans had a small group of white men who could speak to and for the public without fear of contradiction or amendment, and we also happened to have mainstream consensus about the news of the day. The latter state is impossible without the former; the former is how we got to the latter. We have never all agreed with each other. What looks like a post-truth journalistic environment is actually a post-professional environment and a post-scarcity environment. Truth isn’t a stable “thing,” it’s a judgment about what persuades us to believe a particular assertion. And for anything outside our direct personal experience, what persuades us is evidence of operative consensus among relevant actors. This journalistic formula for truth is far more difficult to attain in this new environment. Of course, many truths are knowable, verifiable and undeniable, like the number of children (20) killed in the Newtown, Conn., shooting, or the amount of revenue your local city council collected last year in parking fines. These truths are the bulk of the substance in journalism. What the Internet changes is how many different opinions are now in circulation when we try to determine the meaning of a truth, a change that in turn alters our idea of whose opinion is relevant and where consensus actually lies. People no longer have to shut up while Walter Cronkite tells them “that’s the way it is,” no longer have to sit alone, shouting at their televisions, wondering if they are the only ones who think that something has gone wrong with the country they live in. It’s tempting to want to make the shouters admit they are the ones who 26\n\nare wrong, to insist that facts are facts. The history of life in democratic societies, though, suggests our inability to shut the shouters up is fairly essential.\n\nDISTINGUISHING CONSENSUS FROM TRUTH Homosexuality is a mental illness; that assertion was just as factual as a fact could be, circa 1969. A group of professionals, the American Psychiatric Association, arrived together at a list of the conditions and behaviors that were evidence of mental imbalance. The APA’s professional judgment was then published in the canonical psychological work, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. Homosexuality was in the DSM. Being gay is no longer an illness. Concern over same-sex attraction was progressively downgraded and finally removed altogether over several successive revisions of the DSM, starting in 1970. How did that happen? It happened because people attracted to members of the same sex insisted, persistently and publicly, that the DSM diagnosis, almost universally reported as fact, was nothing but prejudice dressed up in clinical language. As the APA argued over the issue, its members came to agree. This process of removing the sense of homosexuality as pathology is not over, of course; there are still people ready to say that it would be better if gay teens killed themselves than try to make a public place for themselves in society. But in the decades since the first person stood up to the cops at the Stonewall Inn, the ability of gay-hating members of American society to speak or act as if their views represented an obvious truth has weakened with each passing year. This was in part because our sense of who the relevant actors are has changed, as with psychologists being increasingly willing to listen to the accounts of gay citizens themselves. People fighting for the inclusion of gays in society have had to fight against many things. Some of the things they had to fight against were the facts, as constituted by society and regularly reported in the press. We could try to rescue the virtue of mainstream consensus from our historically benighted views about homosexuality by insisting that its existence as an illness was never really a fact, that it was merely something people wrongly believed. 27\n\nUnfortunately, the stray flick of that observation is enough to cause the whole majestic zeppelin of Truth to burst into flame. If some facts are not in fact facts, we need a way of separating these seemingly true but secretly false facts from real actually true facts. But, since we kick beliefs like homosexuality-as-illness out to the curb retroactively, any such mechanism is pretty clearly not going to be universal or fast-acting. Journalism, that famous first draft of history, is especially vulnerable to the damage to mainstream consensus. The philosopher Richard Rorty described truth as whatever everybody declines to be arguing about at the moment. This is less nihilistic than it sounds, since it describes the progress of both social and scientific beliefs. People used to argue about whether photons had mass and about whether women should vote. Now those are settled questions. We used to have consensus on whether gay couples could marry and how many dimensions the universe has. Now people argue about those things all the time. Scientists and politicians have different rules for fighting, of course, and different standards for what constitutes a worthwhile argument, but in both cases, the process is one of competing claims adjudicated by argument and settled by consensus. We could thus describe public expression without using the label truth at all by simply locating any given statement on a spectrum of agreement, running from “The sky is blue” through “Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon” to “The Earth is flat.” The statements we describe as true are the ones that enjoy operative consensus among relevant actors. As a consequence, any statement presented as true can also be described as an assertion; that the people who believe the statement are the people whose opinions on the subject matter, and those who don’t, aren’t. The last decade of public conversation on climate change has turned on this axle. Because journalists often aspire to report from a position of dispassionate arbitration, evidence of consensus is taken as evidence of truth, and lack of consensus signals an unsettled issue. This was a workable strategy only when people with views outside mainstream consensus were locked out of the mainstream media and thus had no way to make their opposing view known. That strategy is now broken. The Internet broadens the range of publicly expressed opinions, to put the matter mildly, making it simple to find people who will vigorously contest any consensus view, no matter how 28\n\nwidely held or carefully tested. This has, in turn, allowed climate change deniers to exploit the press’s discomfort with adjudicating disputes, a journalistic trope my colleague Jay Rosen calls “we have no idea who’s right!” There is no neutral position from which to stand; every assertion the press publishes is backstopped by the relevance of the community making that assertion, whether that means scientists, politicians, the Chamber of Commerce, or the vox populi. Even for something as tied to physical reality as climate change, the press is perforce in the business of refereeing community disputes, not merely ascertaining and then recording facts. With the Internet’s expansion of public speech, journalistic attempts to publish the truth must shift from reporting consensus to telling the public whose opinions are relevant and whose aren’t. This shift in focus to describing who is and isn’t a relevant actor is a return to an older pattern, more common in the days of the partisan press. As Walter Lippmann put it nearly a century ago,2 There is no defense, no extenuation, no excuse whatsoever, for stating six times that Lenin is dead when the only information the paper possesses is a report that he is dead from a source repeatedly shown to be unreliable. . . . If there is one subject on which editors are most responsible it is in their judgment of the reliability of the source.\n\nYet reporters and editors working on climate change have often been unwilling to say, “These scientists are more credible than those scientists” or “This set of data was more relevant than that set of data.” The perception that the press itself is an actor in the public conversation, not just a conduit for that conversation, can still produce discomfort in the nation’s newsrooms (even though that perception is obviously correct).\n\nWHEN BELIEFS AND FACTS COLLIDE We are accustomed to the idea that certain beliefs are contained in particular communities, such as “Jesus is Lord” or “Tennessee barbecue is superior to Texas barbecue,” but this is also the case for sentiments like “The world is round” or “Al Qaeda attacked the Cairo Embassy.” As it is, of course, for sentiments like “Obama is a Muslim.” There is a story in my family of my father-in-law taking his fiancé (my 29\n\nfuture mother-in-law) home to Ethiopia to meet his family. His mother was charmed by my mother-in-law, who, even though she was white, seemed perfectly well behaved. She was, exclaimed his mother, “very nice—just like a Christian!” Now my mother-in-law was a Christian by any American standard—a good Scots/German Protestant. But my grandmother-in-law, Ethiopian Orthodox, used “Just like a Christian” to mean “Just like us.” Depending on who’s asking and how, up to one-fifth of U.S. citizens have been willing to say that Barack Obama is a Muslim. This despite the fact that Obama was raised a Christian, calls himself Christian and worships in a Christian church. But as with my mother-in-law, the question isn’t so straightforward. When conservatives say things like this, it’s often as a form of protest, just as, during the Bush administration, liberals circulated obviously faked images of a gun-toting Sarah Palin in an American flag bikini as if they were real. Furthermore, liberals generally think of religion as a personal choice— you are the religion you say you are and no other. Many of our fellow citizens, however, think we’re wrong, and that religion is tied to family identity. In this view, the fact that Obama’s father was Muslim and that he is named after a grandson of the Prophet counts for something. Reckoned this way, Obama is clearly the most Muslim president in history. When liberals want those conservatives to admit that Obama is not a Muslim, we are not asking them to accept simple facts. We are asking them to replace their conception of religion with ours, a conception that says having a Muslim parent or an Arabic name says nothing whatsoever about religious identity. In presenting our sense of religious identity as factual and the conservative one as obviously false, we are asking them to agree that, in the ways that matter on the issue, Obama is just like them. And they don’t agree. In 2010, Newsweek ran an article, based on Pew Research, on the subject of the president’s religious identity.3 A comment on that piece, by someone going by the nickname Bigfoot, highlights the issue: “I do not know what ‘religion’ he professes to be, but he definitely is NOT christian! I know that he is a ‘Wolf’ in sheeps clothing and do not buy any of his garbage for one second!” (sic) Bigfoot doesn’t deny the president is a Christian because he thinks Obama says the Shahada every day. He denies the president is Christian 30\n\nbecause he doesn’t buy any of Obama’s garbage for one second. As a consequence, he is unwilling to admit to any important similarities between the president and himself. It’s easy to characterize our contempt for Bigfoot and his ilk as highminded concern for their grasp of the facts, but that’s fairly obviously not the case. If we really cared that much about people’s grasp of the facts, we’d have lain awake for decades fretting about the alien abduction people. We don’t, though, because we’re perfectly willing to regard them as harmless morons, alongside the flat earthers and that time cube guy. The alien abduction people don’t upset us because we simply refuse to account for their beliefs in our beliefs. The way people talk about their abduction by aliens doesn’t strike us as legitimate, so we simply ignore their claims. With people like Bigfoot, however, we can’t ignore them as easily because, in an inexplicable turn of events, Newsweek has handed Bigfoot a megaphone. The thing that alarms us about people like Bigfoot isn’t their beliefs, it’s their right to assert those beliefs in our newly expanded public sphere and their ability to act on those beliefs in ways that affect us. When people disagree with us about things like the president’s religion, we say we wish they wouldn’t deny the facts, but really, we just wish they were more liberal or that their definition of religion was the same as ours. Failing that, we sometimes wish that public speech was still restricted to the pros.\n\nTHE PROFESSIONALIZATION OF NEWS In a technical sense, journalism is a trade, not a profession. Its core skills are not arcane, and there are no requirements for either formal studies or certification. (Indeed, in the United States, any certification that barred amateurs and novices from competing with incumbents would be not just illegal, but unconstitutional.) Curiously, much of the 20th century was marked by impulses toward professionalization—from trade associations to journalism schools, and the second half of the century created a situation in the news ecosystem that looked very like professionalization. Federal Communications Commission decisions favoring large broadcast areas and national networks created a television cartel. The death of the evening newspaper at the hands of the evening news strengthened the remaining metro dailies, which achieved something like a monopoly on local display ads. The 31\n\npostwar economic boom turned these scarcities into persistent and sizable income growth. Newspaper chains standardized hiring and training practices across huge swaths of the country, and their hiring preferences increasingly turned to college-educated members of the middle class. In symbiotic adaptation, the country’s journalism schools began training their students in the current professional practices of existing businesses, turning out graduates ready to plug into increasingly complex production processes. The roots of nonpartisan centrism as a press ideology go back to the 19th century and grew with the spread of advertising as a means of financing journalism in the 20th. But the twin postwar forces of large scale and lack of competition helped push the national press even further away from partisan argumentation. Moderate centrism became the house ideology of The New York Times, The Washington Post and CBS News. On the national stage, truth was whatever educated, straight, white men declined to be arguing about at the moment, a consensus view of reality that included the views of Walter Cronkite but excluded those of a large number of his viewers. In an environment like this, industry self-regulation proved a powerful force for censuring journalists who didn’t adhere to shared standards. Reporters couldn’t have their licenses revoked, as doctors or lawyers can, but in an industry whose senior leadership could fit in a hotel ballroom, an informal blackballing, as in “Don’t hire Janet Cooke,” was enough.4 The Internet does not alter this model. It destroys it. No matter how many news outlets continue to hew to moderate centrism, there is no longer any way to keep partisans and fabulists out of the public sphere, nor is there any way to revoke access after heinous affronts to truth-telling. Even the challenge presented by the openly partisan Fox News is nothing like the explosion of reporting and opinion from across the political spectrum the Internet is ushering in. It’s tempting to conclude that this stuff doesn’t count, precisely because the people publishing it don’t abide by the methods or norms favored by mainstream journalists, but the people in the news industry no longer get to decide what the public counts as news. In this environment, the definition of news has much more to do with demand than supply. When the New York Police Department raided Zuccotti Park in November of 2011 to oust the Occupy Wall Street protesters who had been living there to draw attention to their cause, the event was better documented by the 32\n\noccupiers themselves than by the press, since the police went out of their way to block traditional reporters. In contrast to reporting from people with press passes, largely operating behind police barricades, first-hand accounts from people like Tim Pool, who streamed the police activity and the occupier’s reactions live from his phone, constituted the news as many observers experienced it. Similarly, the passionate and knowledgeable cyclists at NYVelocity did more to unmask Lance Armstrong’s years-long doping regime, though they were journalistic amateurs, than all the professional sports journalists covering Armstrong combined. We are now watching the quasi-professionalization of journalism in the 20th century run in reverse. It is certainly possible to tell the difference between Tim Pool and Scott Pelley or NYVelocity and The New York Times; it is no longer possible to find a sharp discontinuity at some midpoint between them, where amateur stops and professional starts. The old gap separating journalists from the public, producers from consumers, has turned into a gradient. At the same time, public consensus has shrunk dramatically, and the ability of mainstream outlets to limit public voices to mainstream values has collapsed altogether. We are entering a world where the consensus view of truth no longer rests on scarcity of public speech and one where ethical norms can’t be backed up by force.\n\n“POST-FACT” JOURNALISM Here’s what the “post-fact” literature has right: The Internet allows us to see what other people actually think. This has turned out to be a huge disappointment. When anyone can say anything, we can’t even pretend most of us agree on the truth of most assertions any more. The post-fact literature is built in part on nostalgia for the world before people like Bigfoot showed up in the public sphere, for the days when Newsweek reflected moderately liberal consensus without also providing a platform for orthographically challenged wingnuts to rant about the president. People who want those days back tell themselves (and anyone else who will listen) that they don’t want to impose their views on anybody. They just want agreement on the facts. But what would that look like, an America where there was broad 33\n\nagreement on the facts? It would look like public discussion was limited to the beliefs held by straight, white, Christian men. If the views of the public at large didn’t hew to the views of that group, the result wouldn’t be agreement. It would be argument. Argument, of course, is the human condition, but public argument is not. Indeed, in most places for most of history, publicly available statements have been either made or vetted by the ruling class, with the right of reply rendered impractical, illegal or both. Expansion of public speech, for both participants and topics, is generally won only after considerable struggle, and of course, any such victory pollutes the sense of what constitutes truth from the previous era, a story that runs from Martin Luther through Ida Tarbell to Mario Savio, the drag queens outside Stonewall, and Julian Assange. There’s no way to get Cronkite-like consensus without someone like Cronkite, and there’s no way to get someone like Cronkite in a world with an Internet; there will be no more men like him because there will be no more jobs like his. To assume that this situation can be reversed, that everyone else will voluntarily sign on to the beliefs of some culturally dominant group, is a fantasy. To assume that they should sign on, or at least that they should hold their tongue when they don’t, is Napoleonic in its self-regard. Yet, this is what the people who long for the clarity of the old days are longing for. Seeing claims that the CIA staged the 9/11 attacks or that oil is an unlimited by-product of volcanism is enough to make the dear dead days of limited public speech seem like a paradise, but there are compensating virtues in our bumptious public sphere. Consider three acts of mainstream media malfeasance unmasked by outsiders: Philip Elmer-DeWitt’s 1995 Time Magazine cover story5 on the prevalence of Internet porn, which relied on faked data; CBS News’6 2004 accusations that President George W. Bush dodged military service, which was based on forged National Guard memos; and Jonah Lehrer’s7 recycling and plagiarism in work he did for the New Yorker and Wired, as well as the fabrication of material in his books. In all three cases, the ethical lapses were committed by mainstream journalists and unmasked by others working on the Internet, but with very different responses by the institutions that initially published the erroneous material. In Elmer-DeWitt’s case, he was given what seemed to be an explosive 34\n\nstudy that claimed, among other things, that 85 percent of the images on the Internet were pornographic. This was the basis for a Time cover story, his first. But the conclusions he drew seemed fishy, and a distributed factchecking effort formed in response, largely organized on the digital bulletin board system called Usenet. It quickly became apparent that the research was junk; that the researcher who had given the report to ElmerDeWitt was an undergraduate who faked the data; that the professors listed as sponsors had had little to do with it, and so on. The study was in fact largely faked, and Elmer-DeWitt and the Time staff did not vet it carefully. Elmer-DeWitt apologized forthrightly: I don’t know how else to say it, so I’ll just repeat what I’ve said before. I screwed up. The cover story was my idea, I pushed for it, and it ran pretty much the way I wrote it. It was my mistake, and my mistake alone. I do hope other reporters will learn from it. I know I have.\n\nAlmost no one saw this apology, however, because he said it only online; the correction run by Time sought to downplay, rather than apologize for, misleading their readers, even though the core facts reported in the story were faked: “It would be a shame, however, if the damaging flaws in [the] study obscured the larger and more important debate about hard-core porn on the Internet.” In 1995, Time could count on very little overlap between its readership and the country’s Internet users, so Elmer-DeWitt’s ethical lapse and subsequent apology could be waved away with little fear that anyone else could dramatize the seriousness of the article’s failings. Contrast the situation a decade later, in 2004, when CBS News aired a “60 Minutes Wednesday” story about President Bush’s time in the National Guard. Like the Elmer-DeWitt story, the CBS story was based on faked documents; as with that story, the forgery was discovered not by CBS itself or another professional media outlet, but by media outsiders working on the Internet; like Time in the Elmer-DeWitt case, CBS spent most of its energy trying to minimize its lapse. Unlike the Elmer-DeWitt story, however, the strategy didn’t work. Charles Johnson, blogging at Little Green Footballs, produced an animated graphic8 demonstrating that the nominally typewritten documents from the early 1970s were actually produced using the default font in Microsoft Word. By 2004, Internet use had become so widespread that the Time Magazine tactic of writing off Internet users as a cranky niche was 35\n\nineffective; Johnson’s work was so widely discussed that CBS couldn’t ignore it. When the network finally did respond, CBS spokesmen admitted that the documents were questionable, that members of the news staff did not check their authenticity carefully enough, that their defense of the reporters involved compounded the error, and that the lapse was serious enough to constitute a firing offense for the senior people involved, including producer Mary Mapes; Dan Rather resigned after some delay.9 A more recent example of this pattern, almost a decade after the National Guard memos, was the science writer Jonah Lehrer’s use of recycled, plagiarized and fabricated material, including, most famously, invented quotes from Bob Dylan.10 Again journalistic ethics were breached in mainstream publications—in Lehrer’s case, in writings for Wired and the New Yorker, and in his book, Imagine. His lapses were uncovered not by anyone at publisher Conde Nast, however. His most serious lapse was uncovered by Michael Moynihan, a writer and editor at Reason and Vice, who published his discovery of the Dylan fabrication in Tablet,11 an online-only magazine of Jewish life and culture. Moynihan’s revelations, the most damning of the criticisms Lehrer was then facing, precipitated his resignation from the New Yorker. The Lehrer example demonstrates the completion of a pattern that we might call “after-the-fact checking,” visible public scrutiny of journalistic work after it is published. After-the-fact checking is not just knowledgeable insiders identifying journalistic lapses; that has always happened. Instead, the new pattern involves those insiders being able to identify one another and collaborate on public complaint. Group action, even loosely coordinated, has always been more visible and powerful than disaggregated instances of individual action; the rise of loose, yet collaborative networks of fact-checking creates a concomitant weakening of strategies by traditional media for minimizing the effects of such lapses. The difference between Elmer-DeWitt and Lehrer isn’t that the latter’s lapses were worse, it’s that the ability to hide the lapses has shrunk. The nominal ethics of journalism remain as they were, but the mechanisms of observation and accountability have been transformed as the public’s role in the landscape has moved from passive to active, and the kind of selfscrutiny the press is accustomed to gives way to considerably more persistent and withering after-the-fact checking.\n\n36\n\n“THE INTERNET IS A TRUTH SERUM” The truth is not dead. Those who issue such laments have correctly identified the changes in the landscape of public speech but often misdiagnose their causes. We are indeed less willing to agree on what constitutes truth, but not because we have recently become pigheaded, naysaying zealots. We were always like that. It’s just that we didn’t know how many other people were like that as well. And, as Ben McConnell and Jackie Huba put it long ago, the Internet is a truth serum. The current loss of consensus is a better reflection of the real beliefs of the American polity than the older centrism. Several names can be applied to what constitutes acceptable argument in a society—the Overton window, the sphere of legitimate controversy—but whatever label you use, the range of things people are willing to argue about has grown. There seems to be less respect for consensus today because there is indeed less respect for consensus. This change is not good or bad per se; it has simply made agreement a scarcer commodity across all issues of public interest. The erosion of controls on public speech have enabled birthers to make their accusations against the president public; it also allows newly emboldened groups—feminists, atheists, Muslims, Mormons —to press their issues in public, in opposition to traditional public beliefs, a process similar to gay rights post-Stonewall, but now on a faster and more national scale. There’s no going back. One of the common ways journalists identify truth is by looking for operative consensus among relevant actors. For the last two generations of journalism, the emphasis has been on the question of consensus; the question of who constituted a relevant actor was largely solved by scarcity. It was easy to find mainstream voices and hard to find marginal or heterodox ones. With that scarcity undone, all such consensus will be destroyed unless journalists start telling the audience which voices aren’t worth listening to. A world where all utterances are putatively available makes “he said, she said” journalism an increasingly irresponsible form, less a way of balancing reasonable debate and more a way of evading the responsibility for informing the public. “Seeking truth and reporting it” is becoming less about finding consensus, which has become rarer, and more about publicly sorting the relevant actors from the irrelevant ones. The shrinking professional class of journalists can no longer fall back on experts, as if 37\n\nevery professor or researcher is equally trustworthy. Journalists now have to operate in a world where no statement, however trivial, will be completely secured from public gainsaying. At the same time, public production of speech, not just consumption, means that the policing of ethical failures has passed out of the hands of the quasiprofessional group of journalists employed in those outlets and has become another form of public argument. This alters the public sphere in important ways. The old days, where marginal opinions meant marginal availability, have given way to a world where all utterances, true or false, are a click away. Journalists have always had to make a call about what constitutes legitimate consensus and who constitutes relevant actors. They just didn’t used to have to work so hard to do so. An environment where public speech was scarce, and where access was generally limited to people with mainstream views, was an environment where the visible actors were the relevant ones and vice versa. It was also an environment where the absence of dissent was a rough and ready metric for measuring consensus. Now, public speech is accessible to brilliant people and crazy people and cantankerous people and iconoclastic people. No assertion more complex than “the cat is on the mat” generates universal assent. In this environment, journalists have to get practiced at sorting relevant from irrelevant actors and legitimate from illegitimate objections. In an even more significant rupture with the past, they have to get practiced at explaining to their readers why they are making the choices they are making. Prior to now, when a news outlet didn’t publish the opinion of someone whose views it considered irrelevant, there was almost no way that person could reach those readers on his or her own. Also prior to now, only the people creating the weather page had to admit to the readers that there was a specific probability connected to their assertions. Now, though, both of those traits have broken down. Views not covered in mainstream outlets can nevertheless find large audiences. The public thus operates with increased awareness that some voices are being intentionally ignored by some media outlets. (Indeed, all media outlets ignore at least some voices.) This means not just including some voices and excluding others but explaining why you are doing so. This is destroying the nominally neutral position of many mainstream outlets. Consider, as an example, Arthur Brisbane’s constitutional 38\n\ninability, as public editor of The New York Times, to process universal public disdain for his proposed methods of fact-checking politicians.12 His firm commitment to avoiding accusations of partisanship, even at the expense of rigorous checks on putative facts, helped raise the visibility of the fact-checking movement in the 2012 presidential campaign, as pioneered by PolitiFact and its peers. These fact-checking services have now become a new nexus of media power in the realm of political speech. Yet Brisbane is onto something, though it may have more to do with self-preservation than with commitment to truth: A world where even mainstream news outlets tell their readers when politicians lie, or publicly assess various speakers’ relevance on any given issue, is a world where neither powerful public actors nor advertisers will be automatically willing to trust or even cooperate with the press. Even as the erosion of consensus makes for an unavoidable increase in oppositional reporting, it also makes the scrutiny journalists face from their audience far greater than the scrutiny they face from their employers or peers. Trust in the press has fallen precipitously13 in the last generation, even as the press itself increasingly took on the trappings of a profession. One possible explanation is that what pollsters and respondents characterized as trust was really scarcity—like the man with one watch, a public that got its news from a politically narrow range might have been more willing to regard those reinforced views as accurate. Since Watergate, however, along with increasingly partisan campaigning and governance, the lack of shared outlook among existing newsmakers, coupled with the spread of new, still more partisan newsmakers, makes this sort of trust impossible. There’s no going back here either. The era when there was something called “the press,” and it had a reputation among something called “the public,” is over. Each organization will have to try to convince each member of its audience that it is trustworthy. Any commitment to ethics will involve not just being more reactive to outsiders’ post-hoc review, but also being more willing to attack other outlets for ethical lapses in public, more ready to publicly defend their own internal policies, rather than simply regarding ethical lapses as a matter for internal policing. The philosophy of journalism ethics—tell the truth to the degree that you can, ’fess up when you get it wrong—doesn’t change in the switch from analog to digital. What does change, enormously, is the individual 39\n\nand organizational adaptations required to tell the truth without relying on scarcity and while hewing to ethical norms without reliance on a small group of similar institutions that can all coordinate around those norms. This will make for a far more divisive public sphere, a process that is already under way. It’s tempting to divide these changes into win-loss columns to see whether this is a change for the better or the worse— birthers bad, new atheists good (relabel to taste)—but this sort of bookkeeping is a dead end. The effects of digital abundance are not trivially separable—the birthers and the new atheists used similar tools and techniques to enter the public sphere, as did the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street. More important, the effects are not reversible. Even if we conclude that the collapse of moderate centrism is bad for the United States, there’s no way to stop or reverse the exploded range of publicly available opinion. Now, and from now on, journalists are going to be participants in a far more argumentative sphere than anything anyone alive has ever seen. The question for us is not whether we want this increase in argumentation—no one is asking us, and there’s no one who could—but rather how we should adapt ourselves to it as it unfolds.\n\nNOTES 1.

This case study illustrates how professional newsrooms might shift their approach to covering a story in response to that new reality. Pinellas County (Fla.) Commissioner Norm Roche led an effort in 2011 to eliminate fluoride from the county water supply. The county government had been adding fluoride since 2004, a common practice throughout the United States that had been lauded as one of the greatest public health achievements of the 20th century. The treatment, which cost the county roughly 30 cents per person per year, was widely reported by dentists and medical professionals to help prevent tooth decay. But critics used research showing that too much fluoride could have side effects on young children, such as causing white spots on their teeth, as a foothold to argue that the government should not force its citizens to consume the supplement. Members of the Tea Party compared the government-backed fluoride treatment to Soviet and Nazi practices. “Fluoride is a toxic substance,” said Tea Party activist Tony Caso in a Tampa Bay Times article about the commission’s decision. “This is all part of an agenda that’s being pushed forth by the so-called globalists in our government and the world government to keep the people stupid so they don’t realize what’s going on . . . This is the U.S. of A., not the Soviet Socialist Republic.”1 In a 4-3 vote in October 2011, the county commission passed the law eliminating the treatment from county water. The backlash was immediate. Commissioner Ken Welch, who voted to keep the fluoride in the water, voiced his outrage over a minority group’s ability to override the majority of public opinion. “We are going to the backwoods of urban counties with this move,” 42\n\nWelch said in a Tampa Bay Times article.2 The four commissioners had ignored the voices of most of the county’s dentists, pediatricians, medical groups, health officials and the public in order to pass legislation supporting a minority-held belief. Welch told the Tampa Bay Times that professionals supporting the use of fluoride outnumbered critical ones before the commission 20-1. But that didn’t faze his fellow commissioners. In the year that followed, the Tampa Bay Times ran more than a dozen editorials and columns about the fluoride battle, excoriating the county commission for failing to protect public health. The news side of the staff covered the debate vigorously throughout the year as residents struggled with how to compensate for the now fluoride-free water. Apart from writing articles before and after commission meetings, they also included the issue in articles surrounding the 2012 re-election campaign of two commissioners who had voted to remove fluoride from the water supply. In their news stories, Times reporters characterized the opinions and studies supporting fluoride supplements in water as solid, well-accepted science. They questioned or ignored the few studies that contradicted the belief that fluoride should be added to public water supplies. In the run-up to the 2012 election, the Times editorial staff advocated strongly for citizens to vote out of office two of the commissioners who were up for reelection. “Two of the Fluoride Four are on the ballot Tuesday seeking re-election to their countywide seats: Nancy Bostock and Neil Brickfield,” the editorial board wrote. “Their challengers, Charlie Justice and Janet Long, support restoring fluoride to the county’s drinking water. It only takes one new commissioner to reverse the backward decision—and save Pinellas County families time, money and frustration.”3 Both Bostock and Brickfield were voted out of office, by significant majorities. Their successors brought the fluoride issue back on the commission agenda. During the subsequent hearing the chamber was once again packed with vocal opponents to fluoride. The law restoring fluoride to the water passed 6-1, with Roche again voting against fluoride. The paper’s strong coverage seemed to influence the election and the fluoride vote. The Times would go on to win the 2013 Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing. 43\n\nQUESTIONS • How should journalists determine if a group’s arguments should be characterized as legitimate or illegitimate? In this case, what evidence would you use to counter the claims that fluoride is potentially harmful? • Journalists are frequently criticized for quoting opposing sides as if they had equal standing. Assume that you have determined that those who oppose fluoride in public water supplies do not have equal or substantial scientific evidence for their arguments compared with those who support the addition of fluoride. Identify three strategies you could use in your news coverage to ensure that opposition voices are heard by the audience in context. Would you quote them directly? Would you openly challenge the accuracy of their claims on the air or in text? Would you ignore them altogether? What are the advantages and disadvantages to each of your strategies? • Name another topic on which there is significant opposition to mainstream beliefs. Find an example of a story where the two sides are presented equally. And find an example of a story where the reporter gives more weight to one side or the other. What techniques does each reporter use? Can you identify the audience for each story? Why might news organizations opt for one approach or the other?

One story still makes me laugh. It concerns how Johnson refuted the philosophy of Bishop George Berkeley, who argued, in essence, that all experience was subjective. In The Life of Samuel Johnson (1791), James Boswell, Johnson’s friend and biographer, describes how the good doctor came to the rescue: After we came out of the church, we stood talking for some time together of Bishop Berkeley’s ingenious sophistry to prove the nonexistence of matter, and that every thing in the universe is merely ideal. I observed, that though we are satisfied his doctrine is not true, it is impossible to refute it. I never shall forget the alacrity with which Johnson answered, striking his foot with mighty force against a large stone, till he rebounded from it—“I refute it thus.”\n\nJournalists are, by training and disposition, stone kickers. In general, they are skeptics who prefer a world of things to a world of ideas and theories, or at least they act as if they do. At their best, they engage the world as it is, rather than as they wish it would be. They go out. They find things out. They judge those things to be either important or interesting — or both. They report things back to the rest of us. Their purpose is to enrich our experience, individually and collectively. Reading Boswell’s Life, we benefit from the knowledge that it takes a big kick to move a big stone.\n\nHOW DO WE KNOW WHAT WE KNOW? 45\n\nBut how do journalists come to know things? And how do they know what they know? If we believe that seeking truth is an essential purpose of journalism, even as it expands into the digital age, answering these questions becomes essential. One man who offered an answer was Melvin Mencher, an influential professor at Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism and the author of a best-selling journalism textbook. In a curmudgeonly style, Mencher passed along to his students a reliable and responsible method of reporting. By reporting, I think he meant a democratic craft of learning, knowing and sharing knowledge. Mencher understood that journalism was not science, but the process of working a story could still begin with a hypothesis, a preconception of what the reporter might discover. It is important to note here that Mencher’s method does not presume that the reporter is a blank slate or an empty vessel. The reporter brings experience and learning to the task, but whatever she thinks she knows, she must in the end be guided by the available evidence. “Who are the homeless?” an editor may ask. Even before the search begins, the reporter is thinking: “If people sleep and keep their stuff in subway tunnels, does that make them homeless?” Or, “I wonder how many people begging on the streets and claiming to be homeless are really alcoholics or drug addicts?” Or, “If a person has every chance to have a home but chooses to live out on the street, should that person have the same homeless status as someone who is forced out of work and gets a foreclosure notice?” Based on the early evidence, one or more of these will pan out, leading the reporter to choose a focus for the story, a central governing idea that helps the reporter and editor select the most telling details from everything that has been gathered. Let me repeat Mencher’s key to responsible practice: If the evidence points the reporter in a different direction, the story must be reconceived. Many of us who serve as sources have had to deal with reporters who are determined to kick the stone, even after we point out to them that it’s the trunk of a tree. No reporters I know think of themselves as Truthtellers, with a capital T, not because they are humble but because they find themselves so often wallowing in a world of uncertainty, a world, as Clay Shirky points out in his essay in this volume, where a practical consensus on how things work is increasingly difficult to find. Who can hope to make sense of the global 46\n\neconomy—or even a school board budget? This may be why accuracy becomes a fetish for journalists. At least we can spell the names right and copy the numbers right. Perhaps a higher or deeper level of understanding may come over time. Journalists are truth-seekers, with a lower-case t, pragmatists who follow their instincts and evolving routines designed to mark their work as trustworthy. Their reports will deliver information in the public interest: for example, that rear-end collisions have increased since the city placed video cameras at dangerous intersections. Now, instead of running red lights, drivers are slamming on the brakes and getting hit from behind. Their stories will transport us to places we cannot go and experiences we could not otherwise have, to the ruins of the Jersey Shore created by Hurricane Sandy or to the Atlanta gravestone of the great golfer Bobby Jones, where visitors leave golf balls as tokens of tribute. Don’t believe me? Go to the cemetery and kick the stone. Our ethic of small-t truth-telling follows a set of standards and practices that I’ve described in essays and articles since 1980, when Washington Post reporter Janet Cooke fabricated a story about an eight-year-old heroin addict. A fiction writer might have performed a public service with such a story, but the Post wound up returning its Pulitzer Prize. Until now, the cornerstone principles of responsible reporting have been these: Do not add. Do not deceive. A kind of distortion, argued the author John Hersey, is inevitable in journalism when you gather a hundred facts but only publish ten. It is distortion by subtraction, as can occur when a photograph is badly cropped or a quote is ripped from its larger context. Journalists work to avoid such problems, but even bad journalism by subtraction is recognizable as journalism. Something essential changes with addition. Responsible journalists do not add to an article facts they know not to be true, they do not add details to a story that didn’t exist, and they don’t add words in a quote that were never uttered. The strongest antidote to deceptive practices—such as composite characters, or improper manipulation of time and space, or even bias—is transparency. In a skeptical, some might say cynical age, authors can no longer count on the benefit of a willing suspension of disbelief. At best, we get a grudging suspension of disbelief, which can evolve into something stronger only if we journalists are willing to disclose to audiences—with more humility than we have done in the past—what we know, how we 47\n\ncame to know it, what we don’t know, what we are still trying to learn and what we may never know. When I started practicing journalism as an amateur, I was unaware of these norms and in my ignorance violated some of them. In one freelance op-ed piece from the 1970s, I created an argument, in the form of angry dialogue, between two Catholic parishioners to dramatize the rifts between the liberal and conservative factions of the Church. Honest, I didn’t know any better. On another occasion, I created a composite Alabama automobile, one festooned with all the kinds of political and cultural bumper stickers that were common in the South in the 1970s. Ten cars became, in my story, one car. Speed ahead to the 21st century and two forces seem at work at the same time now, headed for a broad cultural collision. I would argue that the ethical norms of journalism have never been tougher—nor tougher to enforce. The more people work and play within the field of public communication, forming what has been called a Fifth Estate, the more difficult it will be to create standards and practices that most will adhere to. Can you practice forms of journalism without identifying yourself as a journalist? Yes, you can—as eyewitnesses to historical events have demonstrated over the centuries. Forms of journalism are not eternal. They are invented to solve certain sets of social and political problems and take advantage of emerging markets and new technologies. The human interest story, for example, was created for readers of the penny press as an intentional diversion from traditional politics and business news. The idea was to attract new immigrant readers by the hundreds of thousands, especially in the big cities. Such forms can become exhausted from overuse, only to be reimagined or adapted to match an innovation, the way short forms of the inverted pyramid have been used to convey breaking news on the Internet. But I see nothing new under the sun—or in The Sun, for that matter—that would license bloggers or tweeters, or iPhone photographers and videographers to add stuff that never happened or to deceive audiences with tricks of invention. Wanna be a journalist, kid? Go out there, find stuff out, check it out and deliver it straight. If you prefer taking some fancy steps, be sure to admit what you are doing to the community you want to reach. Adhere to a social contract. 48\n\nTruth (with a small t), transparency and community. These are values and virtues that will continue to define responsible journalism even as technologies, platforms and audiences evolve. In his useful and provocative essay, Professor Shirky argues that journalists must be ready to serve a world in which consensus is increasingly difficult to find and where truth will become a frustratingly fragmented and relative commodity. As an example, he cites the way that psychiatry decided homosexuality was a disease and then decided it was no longer a disease, another step in a social revolution toward the recognition of sexual orientation. As a journalist, I am already uncomfortable. I’m not sure expressions of human sexuality are stones that I can kick. They seem too big. And maybe they aren’t even stones at all. Maybe they are something much less solid. Maybe they are clouds of abstraction. Can you kick a cloud?\n\nNEW IDEAS ABOUT TRUTH—OR “TRUTHINESS” If I understand correctly, this is Shirky’s larger point: In professional environments, new ideas about the nature of truth replace old ones through argument and consensus. While individuals may change their minds on an issue or, in the parlance of waffling politicians, “grow,” many amateurs or civilians—abetted by digital technology—define reliable evidence as that body of knowledge that confirms what I already know or think I believe, an ideology derided by comedian Stephen Colbert as “truthiness.” In late 2012, while I was beginning to think through the question of what constitutes reliable evidence in journalism, a young man, Adam Lanza, shot and killed 26 people, including 20 first-graders, at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. One of the questions that has emerged from the catastrophe is whether Lanza, who also killed his mother and himself, had Asperger’s syndrome and, if he did, whether that created in his mind an unempathetic worldview that could lead him to unthinkable violence. Theories about truth just slammed into one of the most dramatic domestic news stories of the new millennium. In what sense was the mass murderer mentally ill? Had he been examined and diagnosed with Asperger’s? If so, to what extent does that shine any light on his motivations or actions? In the absence of consensus, such questions become more valuable than ever, and no public practitioners are more 49\n\nprepared to ask them than journalists. At least since the invention of the telegraph and the formation of the wire services, journalists have followed paths of understanding described collectively as the Five Ws and H—who, what, where, when, why and how—questions that govern the gathering, sorting and presentation of evidence. Acts of responsible journalism are designed, by tradition, to lead to public comprehension on issues of importance, knowledge that can turn into action (such as trying to keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people or improving the quality of mental health care). It’s been widely acknowledged, by practitioners and scholars, that the hardest of the Five Ws to solve is the fifth, the “why,” a category that the late professor James Carey once described as the “dark continent” of the practice of journalism. You may be able to kick a large stone, even a boulder, but can you kick a mountain? An epistemology of journalism—a phrase that reporters and editors are likely to piss on because of its academic pretentions—is mocked, more often, by the malpractice of professional journalists themselves. How can we make sense of what constitutes responsible evidence within professional or amateur practice when the day-to-day routines that attend public information so often fail the test of reliability? How can we begin to get to the why of a mass shooting—with all its multiple, complex and interconnected causes—when we find it so hard to render the who, what, where and when? In the case of the Newtown shootings, The Poynter Institute’s Andrew Beaujon described the surprising number of inaccuracies and distortions generated by the earliest reports. Let’s stipulate that what is sometimes called “the fog of breaking news” is difficult even for professionals to penetrate. We also recognize that time is the co-author of good judgment and that a news cycle measured by the minute (or less) provides a powerful force against getting things right. Even with those qualifiers, it is amazing how much of the early reporting out of Newtown was wrong, as Beaujon reported: Adam Lanza was not buzzed in to Sandy Hook Elementary School. His mother, Nancy, did not work at the school. He didn’t have an altercation with school officials the day before. He used a Bushmaster rifle, not the Glock and SIG Sauer pistols he was carrying, to carry out his massacre. The children he killed were first-graders, not mostly kindergartners.\n\n50\n\nAdam Lanza’s name was not Ryan (which was his brother’s name).1\n\nThese were just the first published inaccuracies. Others followed. To acknowledge such failures is not to suggest that the professional press is wholly responsible for them. In some cases, mistaken information, rumors and theories were delivered to journalists by sources usually considered official, such as someone representing the police. Sources, journalists and audiences were acting under the usual pressures, intensified by social media’s distribution of information (some of it right and some of it wrong) coupled with expectations that knowledge should be delivered as quickly and widely as possible. In such an environment, truth becomes a byproduct of this social energy, rather than its primary purpose. “Oh, what a world, what a world,” mourns the Wicked Witch of the West as she melts from the water in Dorothy’s pail. “O brave new world,” says Amanda in Shakespeare’s Tempest, “that has such people in’t.” So which is it?\n\nAN ETHIC FOR THE DIGITAL AGE The purpose of this collection of essays is to find the shape of an ethic of journalism in the digital age, an age in which traditional norms are being challenged by technology, demography, economics and other cultural upheavals and surprises, such as the competition from amateurs. This last point is both a sign of the times and a cause of it. It took most of the 20th century to professionalize those who deliver public information. Joseph Pulitzer created the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism and his much coveted prizes to cultivate and reward practitioners who were working at the highest levels. Walter Lippmann and John Dewey began scholarly arguments about the definition of news and the means to gather and transmit it. The Hutchins Commission in the 1940s and the Kerner Commission in the 1960s held journalism practice up for close inspection and offered ideas on how it could be improved. Occasional scandals led to codes of conduct, standards and practices espoused by professional organizations that represented various groups of journalists and media leaders. When Professor Shirky dismisses this movement as somehow antagonistic to First Amendment freedoms—where the licensing of speech would be deemed unconstitutional—he does not recognize that they were most often self-imposed, a process of internal (some might say tribal) 51\n\ndirection, correction and self-protection designed to ward off government imposition. The most powerful of these norms, and the most often mischaracterized, is objectivity. In its original frame, this was not an argument for blank slate reporting. Of course, every person brings an autobiography to the experience of every act, and that includes such players as the reporter, editor or photographer. W. H. Auden argued that a poem was a “contraption” with a person inside of it: a poet. The products of journalism are contraptions, too: stories, articles, columns, photos, radio interviews— and now blog posts, tweets, status updates and slide shows. And the person inside, the governing intelligence, comes with them. As Bill Kovach and Tom Rosenstiel (a co-editor of this book) emphasize in The Elements of Journalism, the routine practices that developed under the rubric of objectivity were built not to suggest reporters could be unbiased, but in recognition that they were indeed biased. The checks and balances that required being assigned by professional editors, acquiring expertise in important beats, avoiding conflicts of interest, getting to the other sides of arguments, the stuff now touted with little credibility as fair and balanced—all of these gave value to words and ideas such as nonpartisanship, independence, disinterestedness, not having a dog in the fight. As these norms evolved during the 20th century, they were never the only ways of knowing that existed for journalists. An ethic of pragmatic detachment that came to dominate beat reporting, say, held little sway in the world of investigative reporting. In their important work “On the Epistemology of Investigative Journalism,” Professors James S. Ettema and Theodore L. Glasser reveal a different set of norms developed from the early muckrakers and perfected through the days of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. “Investigations into crime and corruption usually arise outside of the news net and may cite bureaucratically incredible sources. We find, however that this investigative reporter has worked out for himself an elaborate process which justifies to himself and his colleagues the knowledge claims embodied in his stories,” write Ettema and Glasser.2 The investigators establish their credibility by going through a set of “intellectual exercises,” which the authors describe as: • Screening the tips 52\n\n• Weighing the evidence • Fitting the pieces • Evaluating the story I remember experiencing the product of such a process while reading a special investigation published by The Providence Journal, which began “Jewelry work in Rhode Island is life at the bottom of industrial America.”3 The old factories that manufactured jewelry turned out to be sweatshops that, among other abuses, employed underage children— including my wife. When I first read that lead, I said to myself: That’s not news writing, that’s an opinion, an editorial. But after reading the story, I saw it as something different: an unmistakable conclusion based on the weight of the "
