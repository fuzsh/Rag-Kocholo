Johnson, which included a mention of Tiger Force's service at Đắk Tô in June 1966.[4] In October 2003, The Blade (Toledo) reported on members of the Tiger Force unit, alleging that they had committed numerous atrocities, murdering, raping, and mutilating large numbers of South Vietnamese women and children.[5]\n\nInvestigations of atrocities[]\n\nOn October 19, 2003, Michael D. Sallah, a reporter at The Blade (Toledo) newspaper, obtained unreleased, confidential records of U.S. Army commander Henry Tufts. One file in these records referred to a previously unpublished atrocities investigation known as the Coy Allegation. To investigate this further, Sallah gained access to a large collection of documents produced by the investigation held at the National Archives in College Park, MD.[6]\n\nSallah found that between 1971 and 1975 the Army's Criminal Investigation Command had investigated the Tiger Force unit for alleged atrocities committed between May and November 1967.[7] The documents included sworn statements from many Tiger Force veterans, which detailed atrocities allegedly committed by Tiger Force members during the Song Ve Valley and Operation Wheeler military campaigns. The statements, from both individuals who allegedly participated in the war crimes and those that did not, described atrocities such as the following:\n\nthe routine torture and execution of prisoners[8]\n\nthe routine practice of intentionally killing unarmed Vietnamese villagers including men, women, children, and elderly people[9]\n\nthe routine practice of cutting off and collecting the ears of victims[10]\n\nthe practice of wearing necklaces composed of human ears[11]\n\nthe practice of cutting off and collecting the scalps of victims[12]\n\nincidents where soldiers would plant weapons on murdered Vietnamese villagers[13]\n\nan incident where a young mother was drugged, raped, and then executed[14]\n\nan incident where a soldier killed a baby and cut off his or her head after the baby's mother was killed[15]\n\nThe investigators concluded that many of the atrocities indeed took place.[16] Despite this, the Army decided not to pursue any prosecutions.[17]\n\nFor instance, when Capt. Harold McGaha first landed in the operations area where the Tigers were waiting, he was taken aback. He noticed that several were wearing what he recognized as human ears. It was not a secret at the base that some soldiers were mutilating bodies.[18] This was not isolated to Tiger Force, but according to some reports, occurred to varying degrees in other Army infantry and Marine units.[19]\n\nViolence and murder were both recognized and encouraged by military officials. Col. Morse ordered troops to rack up a body count of 327 casualties in order to match the battalions infantry designation, 327th, however by the end of the campaign soldiers were congratulated for their 1000th kill.[20]\n\nAfter studying the documents, Sallah and fellow reporter Mitch Weiss located and interviewed dozens of veterans who served in Tiger Force during the period in question as well as the CID investigators who later carried out the Army's inquiry. The reporters also traveled to Vietnam and tracked down numerous residents of Song Ve Valley who identified themselves as witnesses. Sallah and Weiss reported that the war crimes were corroborated by both veterans[5] and Song Ve Valley residents.[21] The reporters also managed to track down dozens of additional investigative records not included in the National Archives. In October 2003, the reporters published their findings in a series of articles in The Blade (Toledo).[22] Subsequently, The New York Times performed their own investigation, contacting a few Tiger Force veterans and corroborating the Toledo Blade's findings.[23]\n\nSince The Blade's story, the United States Army has opened a review of the former Tiger Force investigation, but has not yet provided much additional information. On May 11, 2004, Lt. Col. Pamela Hart informed Blade reporters that she had been too busy responding to prisoner abuse by U.S. soldiers in Iraq to check on the status of the Tiger Force case.[24] The Blade has not reported on any more recent updates from the U.S. Army.\n\nReporters Michael D. Sallah, Mitch Weiss and Joe Mahr received multiple awards for their series:\n\nIn 2003, the reporters won the IRE Medal.[25]\n\nIn 2003, the reporters won the Sigma Delta Chi Award for investigative reporting, for publications with a circulation of 100,000 or greater.[26]\n\nIn 2004, the reporters won the Taylor Family Award for Fairness in Newspapers.[27]\n\nIn 2004, the reporters won the Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting.[28]\n\nIn 2006, Sallah, now an investigative reporter with The Washington Post, and Weiss, an investigative reporter with the Associated Press, co-authored a book chronicling their findings: Tiger Force: A True Story of Men and War (Little, Brown and Company; ISBN 0316159972).\n\nPartial list of members 1965–1969[]\n\nLt.
