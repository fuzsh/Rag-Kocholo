        "text": "Criteria and Rules\n\nCriteria\n\nThe annual Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting honors investigative reporting that best promotes more effective and ethical conduct of government, the making of public policy, or the practice of politics. The winner receives $25,000, and five finalists receive $10,000. While the subject can address issues of foreign policy, a submission qualifies only if it has an impact on public policy in the United States at the national, regional or local level. Entries from small and mid-size publications and comparable broadcast/online outlets are encouraged.\n\nIn 2024 we intend to award a special citation for explanatory and/or investigative reporting that focuses on the functioning of government and the implementation of public policy. Exemplary pieces will dive into a societal or governance problem, and use a solutions-focused lens to describe how government can work most effectively and efficiently to solve that problem. Submissions may be considered for the Investigative Reporting Prize and/or the special citation at the judging committee’s discretion. Eligibility requirements for the special citation are the same as those outlined for the Investigative Prize.\n\nEligibility\n\nSubmissions will be accepted only from the U.S. news media. Newspapers, magazines, broadcast media, radio, podcasts, and online news organizations are eligible.\n\nOriginal broadcast or publication must have occurred between January 1, 2023 – December 31, 2023.\n\nNo more than TWO entries may be submitted by a news organization. If entries were produced in collaboration with another news organization, the lead news organization must submit the entry and list any secondary partner organizations/collaborators. If your organization is listed as a secondary partner/collaborator in an entry submitted by another news organization this does not count towards your two allowed entries.\n\nBooks will not be accepted as submissions for this prize.\n\nHow to Apply\n\nThe deadline for submissions for the 2024 Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting has now passed.\n\nEach submission must include a one-sentence summary of the entry, a brief description of the actual or potential impact of the investigative report, and a brief description of how the story originated and comment on the reporting process.\n\nMany entries include a series of articles on a particular topic. Please limit your submission to no more than 5 installments. Any supplemental sidebars and interactive or multimedia features do not count as installments and are permitted.\n\nThe credited authors, titles of work and all other information must be finalized and accurate at time of submission, as this information will be used in a press release if your entry is selected as a finalist.\n\nAny corrections or clarifications added to the story after its initial publication must be clearly identified and explained.\n\nMaterial must be submitted as a live URL and printer-friendly PDF:\n\nURL: Applicants are responsible for making sure the URL works outside of their organization. If entry content is behind a paywall applicants must ensure judges are able to view it (e.g. by providing login details or creating private URL). URLs must remain active during the contest period. If entry includes multiple articles/installments, please (where possible) include URL of single landing page/index/playlist with access to all articles/installments.\n\nPDF: Please combine all installments into a single printer-friendly PDF. Text material (newspaper, magazine, online news organizations) must be formatted in one column. Broadcast/video/audio submissions must include a PDF of the transcript. [You can find an example of a correctly formatted PDF here]\n\nThere is no entry fee.\n\nApplications must be submitted online. Paper entries will not be accepted.\n\nPrize Money\n\nThe winning entry receives $25,000, and five finalist entries receive $10,000 each. Prize money is paid directly to credited authors of the winning/nominated entries, not their organizations."
