        "text": "The annual Goldsmith Awards, presented by the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard Kennedy School, honor public service journalism that has an impact on United States public policy and the functioning of government.\n\nThis year’s event will take place on April 3, 2024 in the JFK Jr. Forum at HKS. We will honor six reporting teams (five finalists and one winner) that have done the best investigative reporting that has an impact on U.S. public policy in the previous year. The winner of the Goldsmith Prize for Investigative Reporting is announced live during the ceremony.\n\nThe ceremony will also honor this year’s Goldsmith Career Award winner Nina Totenberg, who will hold a fireside chat with Center Director Nancy Gibbs during the awards ceremony, as well as the winners of this year’s Goldsmith Book Prize, and the inaugural recipient of a new Goldsmith special citation for reporting on government and policy implementation.\n\nScroll down for information about this year’s judges and honorees!"
