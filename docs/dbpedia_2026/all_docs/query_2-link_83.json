        "text": "Margaret M. “Margie” Kacoha, a former Palm Beach Daily News reporter who covered everything from high-profile criminal cases to pet shows, died on Easter morning, Sunday, April 20 at JFK Medical Center from complications of a stroke. She was 58 and had been in frail health since suffering a debilitating stroke in June 2012.\n\nBorn Oct. 29, 1955 in Indiana, she was the daughter of the late Joseph and the late Sophia Kacoha.\n\nShe graduated from George Rogers Clark High School in Hammond, Ind., and earned a bachelor’s degree in telecommunications in 1977 from the University of Indiana at Bloomington.\n\nFor the next three years, she worked for radio stations in Illinois and Indiana, covering news and writing copy for hourly and nightly newscasts. In 1980, she was awarded a fellowship to the School of Journalism at Indiana University, and earned a master’s degree in 1982.\n\nMs. Kacoha then taught interviewing, news writing and speech at Purdue University from 1982-1983.\n\nShe worked as a reporter for The Times (Hammond, Ind.) until 1988, when she moved to Florida and worked at the Boca News, where her colleagues included former Shiny Sheet reporter Michael Sallah, now a two-time Pulitzer Prize winner and reporter at The Washington Post.\n\n“A lot of people get jaded in our business, but not Margie,” Sallah said. “She was one of those rare reporters who brightened up the newsroom. She was funny, smart and genuinely cared about the people she covered. She never took herself seriously, and made sure you didn’t, either.”\n\nAfter leaving the Boca News, Ms. Kacoha joined the Palm Beach Daily News, where she made a memorable impression on then-editor Joyce Reingold.\n\n“I’ll never forget meeting Margie for the first time, when she applied for a reporting job with the Daily News in 1990,” Reingold said. “She came to the interview with a card file she’d created, filled with details about Town Council actions, and who was who in local government. She proceeded to show that she’d more than done her homework and was, hands down, the top candidate for the job. All these years later, she still holds the distinction of being the most-prepared applicant ever.”\n\nMs. Kacoha’s tenure at the Shiny Sheet was interrupted in 1996 for five years, when she went to work for the Paramount Church and, soon after that, for the late Bill Brooks.\n\nAfter returning to the newspaper as a temporary reporter, she resumed full-time status in 2002 and remained until mid-2012, when a stroke required her to take disability leave.\n\nDuring her time at the Shiny Sheet, Ms. Kacoha’s reportage included the William Kennedy Smith trial, general assignment, the police beat and South Palm Beach.\n\n“As the public information officer for Palm Beach Police Department, I found Margie a pleasure to work with as she covered the police beat,” said Fred Hess, who is now retired. “She was ‘pleasantly persistent.’ She had a unique sense of humor. I miss our daily conversations, but I’m glad that she is finally at peace.”\n\n“Margie was always fair and objective as a reporter,” said Kirk Blouin, town director of public safety. “She was always cordial and was very well-liked by the members of the police and fire departments. Personally, I will miss her kind heart and strong sense of humor. We shared many good laughs through the years. Just the thought of her brings a smile to my face. She will be sorely missed.”\n\nMs. Kacoha loved her profession. In a 1996 memo sent to her editors, Ms. Kacoha shared her gratitude for the opportunities the job presented. “The last six years have been full of so many good things,” she wrote. “I’ve had a front row seat to some of the strangest and most interesting things that could ever happen in one small town. And you gave me the chance to write about them!”\n\nShe was the recipient of numerous Florida Press Club awards, winning first place in categories such as commentary writing, public service writing and feature writing.\n\n“Despite coping with health issues prior to her first stroke, she remained dedicated and passionate about her work, and about the important role of a news organization within a community,” Reingold said. “After the stroke, she remained a faithful reader and called frequently to discuss news developments. She was a true member of The Shiny Sheet family, and will be greatly missed.”\n\nBefore her illness, she was a frequent worshipper at First Baptist Church. Her close friend, former Shiny Sheet fashion editor Maureen O’Sullivan, said the timing of Ms. Kacoha’s death underscored her deeply-held beliefs.\n\n“Easter was always Margie’s favorite holiday, and she believed greatly in what it symbolized,” O’Sullivan said. “It may be that she passed before her time, but I take consolation in knowing that she left this world on her terms on a day that was very special to her. “\n\nMs. Kacoha, a resident of the Patrician in the South End, is survived by her fiancé and caretaker, Nick Vranich; a sister, Mary Ellen Hnatusko; and a brother, Wayne Kacoha.\n\nPlans for services are not complete. All-County Funeral Home and Crematory, 1107 Lake Ave., Lake Worth, is in charge of arrangements."
