        "text": "Anna de Rothchild was a wealthy heiress to the European banking dynasty and real estate developer networking with other high society folks at Mar-a-Lago. She played rounds of golf, took photos, and hobnobbed with the cream of the American political elite. But, turns out, she was a complete fraud bc and simultaneously running from the Russian mob! Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Michael Sallah joins us to explain how a two-bit con artist from the Midwest, on the run from Russian gangsters, ended up being the bell of the ball at the “Winter White House.”"
