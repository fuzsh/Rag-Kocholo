        "text": "The Los Angeles Times has won five Pulitzer Prizes, the United States's top journalism awards.\n\nThe LA Times won awards for its coverage of the California bushfires and Wal-Mart, offbeat car reviews, editorials on the troubled state government and photographs of Liberia's civil war.\n\nIn a year when the war in Iraq dominated much of the news, only two prizes went to journalists covering the US-led invasion.\n\nAnthony Shadid of the Washington Post won the international reporting award and the Pulitzer for breaking news photography went to David Leeson and Cheryl Diaz Meyer of the Dallas Morning News for their photos of the war.\n\nWinners received $10,000 - up from $7,500 - in a tumultuous year for American journalism, which was rocked by false reporting scandals at the New York Times and USA Today.\n\nThe 88th annual awards were announced at New York's Columbia University.\n\nBesides the Los Angeles Times, the Wall Street Journal was the only other multiple winner.\n\nBeat reporting honours went to Daniel Golden for stories on admission preferences given to children of alumni and donors at US universities.\n\nThe Journal's other award came for explanatory reporting by Kevin Helliker and Thomas M Burton for coverage of aneurysms.\n\nThe New York Times won its sole 2004 prize for public service reporting for the work of David Barstow and Lowell Bergman that examined death and injury among US workers and exposed employers who break basic safety rules.\n\nThe winners in this category get a gold medal rather than a financial award.\n\nThe staff of the Los Angeles Times was honoured for breaking news coverage of bushfires in southern California and for national reporting for its examinations of how Wal-Mart became the largest company in the world.\n\nDan Neil of the Los Angeles Times won in criticism for reviews of automobiles, blending technical expertise with offbeat humour and cultural observations, while William Stall won for editorials on California's troubled state government.\n\nThe feature photography award went to Carolyn Cole of the Los Angeles Times for a behind-the-scenes look at the effects of civil war in Liberia.\n\nThe Pulitzer for investigative reporting went to Michael D Sallah, Mitch Weiss and Joe Mahr of The Blade, Ohio, for their series on atrocities by Tiger Force, an elite US Army platoon during the Vietnam War."
