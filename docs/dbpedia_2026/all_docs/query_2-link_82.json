        "text": "The Los Angeles Times won five Pulitzer Prizes on Monday, including one for its breaking news coverage of the wildfires that ravaged Southern California last fall. The New York Times won the public service award for an examination by David Barstow and Lowell Bergman of death and injury among American workers.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times also won Pulitzers in criticism, editorial writing, feature photography and national reporting for its examination of the tactics that have made Wal-Mart the largest company in the world.\n\nThe five awards were the second most awarded to a newspaper in a single year. The New York Times won seven in 2002 primarily for its coverage of the Sept. 11 attacks.\n\nIn the arts, the Pulitzer for fiction was awarded Monday to Edward P. Jones for The Known World, his long-anticipated historical novel about a black slave owner.\n\nJones, who spent 10 years between books, had previously won the National Book Critics Circle Award for The Known World.\n\nThe New York Times' award was for an unusual collaboration across media with the PBS program Frontline and the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. The piece examined worker safety at the foundries of McWane Inc., a cast-iron pipe manufacturer where lax enforcement of rules contributed to thousands of injuries and some deaths.\n\n\"This represents an extraordinary pioneering example of a hybrid form of journalism,\" said New York Times executive editor Bill Keller. \"It's another demonstration that whatever may be said about the Times being stodgily traditional, the fact is, we can do whatever we put our minds to.\"\n\nBarstow was a reporter for the St. Petersburg Times from 1990 to 1999. In 1998, he was a finalist for a Pulitzer in explanatory journalism for stories about tobacco litigation. He also helped lead a team of reporters that was a Pulitzer finalist that year for its investigative reporting on the scandal that led to racketeering and grand theft convictions against the Rev. Henry J. Lyons, president of the National Baptist Convention USA.\n\nIn 1994, Barstow won the Paul Hansell Award, which is presented annually by the Florida Society of Newspaper Editors to a journalist for overall excellence in reporting and writing.\n\nEach Pulitzer Prize is worth $10,000, except for public service, which is recognized with a gold medal.\n\nThe awards are given by Columbia University on the recommendation of the 18-member Pulitzer board, which considers nominations from jurors in each category.\n\n_ Information from Times files was used in this report.\n\nPRIZE WINNERS\n\nJOURNALISM:\n\n+ Public Service: New York Times.\n\n+ Breaking news reporting: Staff, Los Angeles Times.\n\n+ Investigative reporting: Michael D.
