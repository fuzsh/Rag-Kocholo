The Pledge of Allegiance was said by all and a moment of silence for our fallen heroes followed.\n\nThe passing of long-time member Al Gautieri was noted as well.\n\nTreasurer’s Report\n\nPer Treasurer Chris Iorio 7/17/24\n\nClub account = $ 12,973.10\n\nPetty Cash = $ 265.00\n\n$ 13,238.10\n\nSozo Kids account = $ 968.05\n\nOld Business\n\nNew Business\n\nGames at Gators (Brownwood)\n\nMonday, July 22 – Yankees bombed the Rays 9 – 1. HRs from Soto (2), Wells, Volpe, and LeMahieu. Carlos Rodon pitched well over 7 innings work.\n\nNext month\n\nThursday, August 22 @ 1:05 pm vs Cleveland Indians (Guardians)\n\nList of games is on the Club website at thevillagesnewyorkclub.com\n\n2025 Yankee Schedule Published\n\nGames at St. Pete vs Rays:\n\nThursday April 17 thru Sunday April 20. Saturday or Sunday probably day games.\n\nWednesday and Thursday August 19 – 20. Thursday maybe a day game.\n\nGuest Speaker – Club Member Bill Steinberg\n\nFrom Syracuse, NY\n\n35+ years experience in collecting\n\nFormer card store owner\n\nCareer in Education\n\nBill described his experience in memorabilia collecting dating back to his “sideline” from his education career in Syracuse, including owning a store from 1999-2013 in a local mall. The emergence of Amazon and Ebay made the store ownership non-profitable over time.\n\nBill moved to the Villages in retirement and continued his collecting and selling of memorabilia. He signed on with Ebay to handle his transactions and opened up a website with the “Baseball Card Guy” identification. He also set up shop in a commercial space for storage and an office that he works out of on a regular basis. He offers appraisals and advice to memorabilia collectors.\n\nBill talked about the grading and encapsulation process whereby cards are graded by an independent company and then encapsulated in sleeves with the grading information noted. These methods ensure that the card is what it said to be and cannot be altered. He also talked about autograph authentication by independent companies that is the only way to show that the item and autograph are considered to be legitimate. There is so much fraud in the hobby that a good collector will only make transactions based on these processes. Some of these services even examine packaged sets to make sure they are complete and not tampered with.\n\nWith Topps selling to the Fanatics company, the trend in the industry is focused on dollars. Ebay is now the pricing guide of the collectors and the old Beckett guides are obsolete. He also said the vintage card sector is strong, generally being cards 1980 and older.\n\nThe members had several questions for Bill and he provided his insight. He also invited all to the next show being held September 7 at the Savannah Center.\n\nYankee Talk\n\nThe Club discussed the upcoming trade deadline on July 31 and the needs of the Yankees. All felt the bullpen needed help and other positions such as 3B and 2B were suspect. A starting pitcher would be great, but the going price with giving up prospects may be too dear to the Yankees.\n\nA list of rumored trade players was shown.\n\nLuis Rengifo (3B Angels)\n\nJazz Chisolm (2B/OF Marlins),\n\nGarrett Crochet (SP White Sox),\n\nTanner Scott (RP Marlins),\n\nTarik Skubal (SP Tigers),\n\nMason Miller (RP Athletics),\n\nRyan McMahon (3B Rockies),\n\nAlex Bregman (3B Astros),\n\nVlad Jr. (1B Blue Jays),\n\nCody Bellinger (OF/1B Cubs)\n\nLaMonte Wade (1B Giants),\n\nKirby Yates (RP Rangers),\n\nLet’s see what happens as the Yankees go forward,\n\n50/50\n\nTwo winners at $30 each.\n\nNext meeting date:\n\nAugust 28, 2024\n\n7:00 PM - Eisenhower Recreation Center\n\nSubmitted: August 5, 2024\n\nRon Majesky\n\nClub Secretary\n\nMEETING MINUTES\n\nDate: June 26, 2024\n\nPlace: Eisenhower Recreation Center\n\nThe meeting was called to order by President George Reever at 7:00 PM. The Pledge of Allegiance was said by all and a moment of silence for our fallen heroes followed.\n\nThe passing of MLB great Willie Mays was also noted.\n\nTreasurer’s Report\n\nPer Treasurer Chris Iorio 6/16//24\n\nClub account = $ 12,938.43\n\nPetty Cash = $ 265.00\n\n$ 13,203.43\n\nSozo Kids account = $ 888.05\n\nOld Business\n\nTrip to Clearwater - Tarpons vs Threshers (Phillies A team)\n\nJune 11 trip to Clearwater BayCare Park to see the Tampa Tarpons play the Clearwater Threshers\n\n45 members made the trip and enjoyed the private Shark’s Deck viewing area\n\nBall park food buffet was presented right on time and enjoyed by all.\n\nGame delayed one hour by rain but weather cleared out.\n\nTampa enjoyed a 7-2 lead into the 9thinning but managed to give it up and go into extras. Won the game 9-7 as our tired bus crew left the ballpark for home.\n\nNew Business\n\nGames at Gators (Brownwood)\n\nSunday June 23 – Yankees left their bats in the dugout and lost 3-1 to the Atlanta Braves.\n\nNext month\n\nMonday, July 22 @ 1:05 pm vs Tampa Bay Rays.\n\nList of games is on the Club website at thevillagesnewyorkclub.com\n\nUpcoming Meetings\n\nJuly – TBD\n\nAugust – TBD\n\nGuest Speaker – Club Member Joe Guanieri\n\nFrom Buffalo and a graduate of Niagara University\n\nBegan working as a teacher and moved on into school administration.\n\nDuring that time, he became involved with the Buffalo Sabres NHL team, beginning as a stats guy and production coordinator. An opportunity presented itself to produce games for TV and he took a leave from his education career for good.\n\nAfter 22 years with the Sabres, he moved on to ESPN. After 15 years with the sports network, retired in 2019.\n\nWon 3 Emmy awards, 2 national awards for ESPN shows and a regional Emmy.\n\nJoe captured the crowd with his memories of working with the Buffalo Sabres and ESPN. He was mainly in production and dealt with many people and situations.\n\nHe talked about the advances in technology in televising events. He discussed the transition from mainly video tape and manual rewind methods to show replays on TV to the new age of computers and replays, slo-mo, and other advances such as the robot strike zone in baseball and the tracing of the flight of the golf ball in televised PGA and LPGA events. To emphasize the advancements, he showed the group a hockey puck with sensors built in from the NHL days when the movement of the puck was picked up by multitudes of electronic devices hung throughout the arena to pick up the puck. Luckily this fad by Fox TV was not well received in the late 1990’s and abandoned soon after.\n\nHe talked about the Sabres last time in the Stanly Cup finals in 1999. He and thousands of Buffalo fans still think Brett Howe was in the crease when he scored the winning goal in the final game. However, as the ice was being broken up after the game for processing into the melt water, he became aware that pieces of the crease with the blue paint on them were about ready to be destroyed. He was able to obtain a piece and packed it in dry ice to keep it until he got home. Long story short, he hung onto that piece until 2014 when his refrigerator in Bristol CT broke down and the memento melted. Sad.\n\nHis career at ESPN was in production and he was the man to obtain the TV trucks you see at sporting events. ESPN did not own any of that side of the production and rented everything that was needed. He developed a relationship with Pat Sullivan who was the owner of the New England Patriots at that time and then went into the production truck business.\n\nJoe showed the gathering one of his 3 Emmys won during his time at ESPN. That one was for Technical Production earned on the College Game Day program.\n\nThe talk was very interesting and went for almost an hour with many questions from the group.\n\nYankee Talk\n\nThe Club is still wondering when the Yankees will break out of their funk. The starting pitching and bullpen have gone south and were the strengths earlier in the season.\n\n50/50\n\nTwo winners at $20 each.\n\nNext meeting date:\n\nJuly 24, 2024\n\n7:00 PM - Eisenhower Recreation Center\n\nSubmitted: July 10, 2024\n\nRon Majesky\n\nClub Secretary\n\nMEETING MINUTES\n\nDate: May 22, 2024\n\nPlace: Eisenhower Recreation Center\n\nThe meeting was called to order by President George Reever at 7:00 PM. The Pledge of Allegiance was said by all and a moment of silence for our fallen heroes followed.\n\nTreasurer’s Report\n\nPer Treasurer Chris Iorio 5/14/24\n\nClub account = $ 12,776.64\n\nPetty Cash = $ 265.00\n\n$ 13,041.64\n\nSozo Kids account = $ 851.05\n\nOld Business\n\nYankees/Rays Games 2024\n\nMay 12 – 54 members and guests attended the game. Yankees turned a laugher into a close game until a 4-run rally in the 8th. Hit 5 HRs and beat the Rays 10-6.\n\nTrip to Clearwater - Tarpons vs Threshers (Phillies A team)\n\nDate – June 11, 2024\n\nBayCare Ballpark\n\nStart time 6:30 pm\n\nBus leave – TBD but probably around 3:00 to 3:30\n\nCost to members is $20 for ticket and ballpark food buffet (hot dogs, sliders, BBQ pulled chicken, chips, ice cream, soft drinks & water.

Guests must pay the bus fee of $25 for a total of $45\n\nGeorge is taking reservations and accepting money. 48 attendees at this time.

These minutes will leave you guessing if you were not at the meeting.\n\nPrizes were awarded to the 1st and 2nd place teams from the Club’s stock of donated and acquired items.\n\nThanks again to Bob for all his efforts and preparation time.\n\nYankee Talk\n\nThe Yankees starting pitching has been outstanding stepping up for the injured Gerritt Cole (early June). Cortez, Rodon, Stroman, Schmidt, and especially Lois Gil have combined for top notch stats which are near the top of MLB.\n\nDJ LeMahieu is due back to the Club very soon, maybe next week.\n\nJason Dominguez will probably be assigned to AAA when ready. Yankees OF is very strong right now.\n\nJuan Soto as a FA signing will be ultra expensive and maybe out of the reach of Steinbrenner’s pocketbook. Ridding payroll going into next season with Rizzo, Torres, Verdugo will need to be done.\n\nEverybody is upbeat on the season so far but still will look to improvements (probably bullpen) as time goes on and the trade deadline gets closer.\n\n50/50\n\nTwo winners at $31 each.\n\nSozo Collection\n\n$37.00\n\nAttendance\n\n35 members\n\nNext meeting date:\n\nJune 26, 2024\n\n7:00 PM - Eisenhower Recreation Center\n\nSubmitted: May 29, 2024\n\nRon Majesky\n\nClub Secretary\n\nMEETING MINUTES\n\nDate: April 24, 2024\n\nPlace: Eisenhower Recreation Center\n\nThe meeting was called to order by President George Reever at 7:00 PM. The Pledge of Allegiance was said by all and a moment of silence for our fallen heroes followed.\n\nThe Club noted the passing of Yankee pitcher Fritz Peterson.\n\nGeorge then introduced Jody Ashley representing Omnivision, a TV streaming service. The presentation by Omnivision was held in order to inform Club members of an opportunity to view Yankee games and other sports events on their televisions and other devices.\n\nJody covered the basics of the internet provided service at the cost of $365 per year.

The menu of viewing sites is essentially limitless and the sports venues national outlets and regional networks.\n\nMany questions were asked about the system and explained to the audience.\n\nInformation brochures were available to the Club members and there was a visual set up for viewing of content.

Met up with Reggie Jackson in 1966 in the California League and told us of the struggles Reggie had in the South when playing with him at Birmingham.\n\nHe remembered having Joe DiMaggio as an outfield coach in the late 60’s and how Joe helped him so much.\n\nThe great A’s teams in the early 70’s were led by great pitching including Catfish Hunter and Vida Blue. Joe said acquiring Ken Holtzman to add to the staff put them over the hump as far as having championship teams.\n\nJoe spoke about A’s owner Charles O. Finley how frugal he was with players’ salaries. Charlie O. was a good negotiator and hands on as an owner. He also had a kind and generous side when it came to helping people and causes.\n\nJoe talked about the Oakland Coliseum and how damp and cold it was. He described the outfield grass as “dewy” all the time but it got better as the surrounding area developed and “climate change” settled in.\n\nHis toughest pitcher to face was Nolan Ryan. Join the crowd.\n\nHe considers today’s players spending too much time in the weight rooms and are too strong, thereby incurring more injuries.\n\nHe said that the A’s will be holding a 50th anniversary celebration of their great three-peat in 1972 – 74 World Seies championships.\n\nJoe ended the evening by signing autographs for the members at no cost and even stuck around to listen to the business portion of our meeting.\n\nTreasurer’s Report\n\nPer Treasurer Chris Iorio 3/17/24\n\nClub account = $ 13,402.10\n\nPetty Cash = $ 265.00\n\n$ 13,667.10\n\nSozo Kids account = $ 612.34\n\nPlease note that future dues need to be paid by the February meeting or risk losing membership.

This year it has been like a black hole for both Murray Deutsch and Ron Majesky\n\nAnthony Scutti said that he would be willing to contact the Phillies organization in Clearwater. They offer the buffet style event also. It was determined that the Tampa Tarpons will be in Clearwater June 11 – 13. Anthony will make contact and advise on his findings.\n\nMay meeting – TBA.\n\nYankee Talk\n\nYankees 26-man roster going into Opening Day\n\nCatchers Outfield\n\nJose Trevino Alex Verdugo\n\nAustin Wells Aaron Judge\n\nBen Rortvedt (traded to Rays) Juan Soto\n\nTrent Grisham\n\nInfield Jasson Dominguez (IL)\n\nAnthony Rizzo\n\nGleyber Torres\n\nD.J LeMahieu (IL) DH Giancarlo Stanton\n\nOswaldo Cabrera\n\nAnthony Volpe\n\nJohn Berti (trade from Marlins)\n\nJahmai Jones IF/OF (maybe)\n\nPitchers Bullpen\n\nNestor Cortez Clay Holmes\n\nCarlos Rodon Ian Hamilton\n\nMarcus Stroman Jonathan Loasigia\n\nClark Schmidt Caleb Ferguson\n\nLois Gil Victor Gonzalez\n\nGerritt Cole (IL) Nick Burdi\n\nClayton Beeter\n\nLuke Weaver\n\nTommy Kahnle (IL)\n\nScott Effross (IL)\n\nLou Trivino (IL)\n\nDiscussion was centered around the 26 man roster and the noted injuries to key players. The general feeling was upbeat and hopeful about the changes the Yankees made over the off season and how they could rebound from last year’s dismal season. As usual, the starting pitching without Garrett Cole remained the main concern.\n\n50/50\n\nThree winners at $38 each.\n\nSozo Collection\n\n$164\n\nMeeting headcount was 95 attendees.\n\nNext meeting date:\n\nApril 24, 2024\n\n7:00 PM - Eisenhower Recreation Center\n\nSubmitted: April 8, 2024\n\nRon Majesky\n\nClub Secretary\n\nMEETING MINUTES\n\nDate: February 28, 2024\n\nPlace: Eisenhower Recreation Center\n\nThe meeting was called to order by President George Reever at 7:00 PM. The Pledge of Allegiance was said by all and a moment of silence for our fallen heroes followed.\n\nThe Club noted the passing of former Cincinnati Red and Yankee pitcher Don Gullet on February 14. The acquisition of Gullet in 1977 after he helped the Reds sweep the Yankees in the 1976 Series was a big deal back then.\n\nGeorge then introduced our guest speaker Mickey Rivers.\n\nMLB career spanned from 1970 to 1984 and was with the Yankees from 1976 to 1979.\n\nThree World Series appearances with the Yankees - 1976, and World Championships in 1977 &1978.\n\nIn 1976 with the Yankees he hit .312 and stole 43 bases.

He previously appeared in February 2016 and February 2019. He has always been a favorite of the Club.\n\nMickey started out by urging the Club members to enjoy their retirement in the Villages, one of his favorite places to be in and visit. Time is too short to be trivial things that do not add quality to your life.\n\nHe then told stories and his impressions of Yankee greats like Bobby Richardson, Moose Skowron, Clete Boyer, Tony Kubek, Thurman Munson, Billy Martin and on and on. A lot of these players had much to do with Mickey’s growth as a ball player.\n\nHe talked of how the Yankee organization is top notch and will be searching for the players to make them better again. His time with the Yankees and the World Series wins in 1977 and 1978 was the most favorite time in his career.\n\nHe answered several questions from the crowd and then signed autographs for all who wanted it for no fee.\n\nTreasurer’s Report\n\nPer Treasurer Chris Iorio 2/20/24\n\nClub account = $ 10,517.74\n\nPetty Cash = $ 265.00\n\n$ 10,782.74\n\nSozo Kids account = $ 388.34\n\nOld Business\n\nSpring Training Games\n\nBraves game 3/10/24\n\n36 paid in full for this game.

Possible dates April 9,10 or 11.\n\nApril meeting – presentation on Omnivision, a streaming service which includes MLB and the YES channels\n\nYankee Talk\n\nGeorge reviewed the list of new Yankees on this year’s roster:\n\nJuan Soto, OF (trade from Padres for Michael King, Kyle Higashioka, Randy Vasquez, Jhony Brito, Drew Thorpe)\n\nTrent Grisham, OF (trade from Padres with Soto deal)\n\nAlex Verdugo, OF (trade from Red Sox for Greg Weissert and 2 other pitchers)\n\nMarcus Stroman, RHP (FA from Blue Jays)\n\nVictor Gonzalez, LHP Bullpen (trade from Dodgers with Jorbit Vivas for Trey Sweeney)\n\nCody Morris, RHP Bullpen (trade from Indians for Estivan Florial)\n\nCaleb Fergusen, LHP Bullpen (trade from Dodgers for 2 pitchers)\n\nGot stronger offensively and defensively and the bullpen once again looks like the strong point.\n\nStarting pitching looks adequate but could really use another good starter. However, addition of Blake Snell (best FA) would cost the organization so much luxury tax money, draft choices, and international money that the signing appears prohibitive. Short of a deferred comp deal to lessen the salary money impact, FA signings are probably a lost cause. Maybe a trade?\n\n50/50\n\nThree winners at $54 each.\n\nNext meeting date:\n\nMarch 24, 2024\n\n7:00 PM - Eisenhower Recreation Center\n\nMEETING MINUTES\n\nDate: January 24, 2024\n\nPlace: Eisenhower Recreation Center\n\nThe meeting was called to order by President George Reever at 7:00 PM. The Pledge of Allegiance was said by all and a moment of silence for our fallen heroes followed.\n\nThe Club noted the passing of member Bruce Jansen – November 14, 2023 (West Seneca, NY)\n\nPizzas had been placed on all the tables and George invited all attendees to begin the annual Pizza Party. Each table had a pepperoni pizza and a cheese pizza for the members enjoyment. Soft drinks and water were provided.

This Sunday happens to be Mother’s Day. Prices are increased for both tickets ($47 to $73) and bus. Cost for this trip will be $97 if we fill a 56-passenger bus.\n\nJuly 9 – 11 (Tuesday – Thursday) – All game starts are 6:50 pm.\n\nAre there enough club members that are willing to attend a night game?\n\nPresident George ascertained by a show of hands that attending a night game in St. Petersburg was not a popular choice of the members. This has been historically true based on past experience.\n\nGeorge was a little upset that interest in the May 12 game was lagging. He puts in a lot of work to make these trips happen. He urged the members to attend the game, it being the only chance to see the Yankees in a St. Pete day game this season.\n\nPoor attendance may put a damper on future game opportunities.\n\nUpcoming Meetings\n\nFebruary – Tommy John\n\nMarch – Joe Rudi\n\nApril – TBD + probable Tampa Tarpons buffet trip.\n\nEvening’s Speaker\n\nManny Crespo\n\nCame to Miami in 1961 at age 11.\n\nHigh school years All Miami City and All Dade County including 1968 All State team and Miami herald Player of the Year.\n\nDrafted in 1968 by Red Sox in 5th round and had minor league career to 1974.\n\nMoved on to coaching and player development for the next 47 years to include stints with Miami Dade Junior College, Florida International University, San Diego Padres, Florida Marlins, New York Yankees, Detroit Tigers and the USA Women’s National team.\n\nFrom 2009 to 2017 was Bench Coach and Manager for the Spanish National team.\n\nManny presented a Power Point presentation of his life in baseball, starting with his children’s roots in his native Cuba. He detailed his coming to America and his rise to a star baseball player in Miami and the youngest player (13 years) to play American Legion ball during this time.\n\nHe spent his MLB career in the Minor Leagues with the Red Sox and then in the Mexican leagues where he told the story of train tracks running through the playing field at one of the ball parks. Play would have to stop from time to time to allow the train traffic to go through.\n\nAfter his minors career, he branched out into coaching which filled his life for the next 40 to 50 years. In particular he emphasized his short stint with the Yankees as a Minor League Rookie Manager in 2002. His stories about his interactions with the “Boss” George Steinbrenner and firing of coaches and clubhouse personnel were hilarious (ultimately to be rehired the next day!!)\n\nOne of his most proud moments was being named as a coach for the USA Women’s National team. Being honored by his country was extra special and he loved working with the talented women.\n\nThe attendees were greatly appreciative of Manny’s presentation and gave him a standing ovation as an indication. Manny would like to come back to see the Club in the future and continue his story telling and achievements.\n\n50/50\n\nThree winners at $40 each.\n\nNext meeting date:\n\nFebruary 28, 2024\n\n7:00 PM - Eisenhower Recreation Center\n\nSubmitted: February 9, 2024\n\nRon Majesky\n\nClub Secretary\n\nMEETING MINUTES\n\nDate: November 22, 2023\n\nPlace: Eisenhower Recreation Center\n\nThe meeting was called to order by President George Reever at 7:00 PM. The Pledge of Allegiance was said by all and a moment of silence for our fallen heroes followed.\n\nSozo Kids Donation\n\nGeorge introduced Don Frisk, representing Pastor Dave Houck, to accept the Club donation of $1,200 for the Sozo Kids of the Ocala National Forest. Dan has returned to the Sozo Kids organization after a 5-year stint with NASA. He described the programs that the charity runs including backpacks for the school kids, Christmas presents for the parents to wrap and give to the kids, clothing, medical care, etc. Donations such as ours go a long way in funding these items.\n\nHe also introduced the Club to the Dragonfly Project which is a new project to develop a residential program for young adults to gain training/education which would result in stable jobs and careers in our society.\n\nTreasurer Murray Deutsch presented the check, standing in for Charley McCabe – Sozo Kids coordinator.\n\nTreasurer’s Report\n\nPer Treasurer Murray Deutsch 11/14/23\n\nChecking account = $ 8,130.45\n\nPetty Cash = $ 265.00\n\n$ 8,395.45\n\n$4429 spent for the Spring Training game tickets o 3/10 and 3/25/24.\n\nSozo Kids account = $ 1,310.34\n\nBalance after tonight’s $1,200 donation = $110.34 will seed next year’s efforts and keep account open.\n\nCommittee Reports\n\nVacant - MEMBERSHIP\n\nRon Majesky - WEB MASTER\n\nBill Gerke - NOMINATING COMMITTEE 11/22/23\n\nVacant - CLUB OUTINGS\n\nGeorge Reever - YANKEE TRIPS\n\nCharlie McCabe - SOZO KIDS COLLECTION\n\nDick Sigston - PUBLICITY\n\nJoe & Karen Sullivan - REFRESHMENTS & 50/50\n\nAnthony Scutti - SPEAKERS\n\nFayne Reever - GENERAL MEETING DUTIES\n\nNominations for Club Officers were received by Bill Gerke and he offered them to the members.

Have used waiting list due to 7 dropouts so far.\n\nBraves game 3/10/24\n\n36 paid in full for this game. Smaller 36 passenger bus ordered. $80 cost for ticket and bus.\n\nIf you still wish to attend either game, get your name on waiting list.

No game times set, but Thursday may be an afternoon get away date for travel to Baltimore.\n\nTampa Tarpons Game & Buffet\n\nTampa Tarpons schedule out and being reviewed for our food and beverage game trip to Steinbrenner Field.\n\nApril 23 – 26 (Tuesday – Friday) home dates. Our April meeting is Wednesday April 24.\n\nJune 18 – 21 (Tuesday – Friday) home dates.\n\nNew Business\n\nUpcoming Meetings\n\nDecember – no meeting\n\nJanuary – annual Pizza Party and guest speaker Manny Crespo, Red Sox minor leaguer and successful coaching career\n\nFebruary – George made a great announcement and the culmination of his hard work over the past several months. Tommy John will be coming to our February meeting to speak to us. Tommy graciously agreed to a minimal $2,000 fee and a night stay at a local hotel. Details will be sent out prior to his appearance, especially regarding autographs, book signing, guests, etc.\n\nIt was noted that Tommy’s appearance will be only for paid up Club members and their guests ($10). For the minimal fee and not to make it look like the Club was exploiting the appearance, it was deemed by the Board that outside attendance was not appropriate.\n\nYankee Talk\n\nA short video was shown. Michael Kay interviewed Buster Olney from MLB and they discussed Brian Cashman, Juan Soto acquisition, and Ohtani probably going to Dodgers.\n\nThe Club noted the new bench coach Brad Ausmus and new hitting coach James Rowson from the Tigers. There was hope that something could be done with Stanton’s contract, but there appears to be no takers. There is a rumor that the Padres may want up to 6 players/prospects for Juan Soto. Yankees may still be considering trading Gleyber Torres in his walk year. Lots to happen over the Winter months.\n\nCard Show\n\nThere is a card show coming up at Laurel manor on January 27, 2024. Bill Gerke and Ron Majesky will help out. Details later.\n\n50/50\n\nTwo winners at $27 each.\n\nNext meeting date:\n\nJanuary 24, 2024\n\n7:00 PM - Eisenhower Recreation Center\n\nSubmitted: December 4, 2023\n\nRon Majesky\n\nClub Secretary\n\nMEETING MINUTES\n\nDate: October 25, 2023\n\nPlace: Eisenhower Recreation Center\n\nThe meeting was called to order by President George Reever at 7:00 PM. The Pledge of Allegiance was said by all and a moment of silence for our fallen heroes followed.\n\nBob Cusano’s Yankee Trivia\n\nThe meeting went directly to the Yankee trivia game presented by Club member Bob Cusano.\n\nOnce again Bob challenged the attendees knowledge of Yankee history. This particular presentation highlighted “Starter Trivia” and went around the diamond and asked which lifetime Yankees played the particular position for the most consecutive years. Points were awarded based on how many of the players a team could name for the particular position.\n\nAs usual, the competition went down to the final question and how much the teams wanted to wager. The usual “all in” wagers occurred and the final question answer was HOF catcher Mickey Cochrane (Mantle’s namesake as per his father’s wishes).\n\nPrizes were awarded to the top three teams, George Reever got to clean out his garage, and all present thoroughly enjoyed the evening.\n\nTreasurer’s Report\n\nPer Treasurer Murray Deutsch 10/16/23\n\nChecking account = $ 12,523.35\n\nPetty Cash = $ 265.00\n\n$ 12,788.35\n\nSozo Kids account = $ 1,238.34\n\nCommittee Reports\n\nVacant - MEMBERSHIP\n\nRon Majesky - WEB MASTER\n\nBill Gerke - NOMINATING COMMITTEE\n\nVacant - CLUB OUTINGS\n\nGeorge Reever - YANKEE TRIPS\n\nCharlie McCabe - SOZO KIDS COLLECTION\n\nDick Sigston - PUBLICITY\n\nJoe & Karen Sullivan - REFRESHMENTS & 50/50\n\nAnthony Scutti - SPEAKERS\n\nFayne Reever - GENERAL MEETING DUTIES\n\nYankee trips to be noted later in these minutes.\n\nNomination for Club Officers will be taken in November for the 2024 – 2025 term. Bill Gerke made his short presentation regarding same.\n\nThere is enough money in the Sozo Kids account to present to Pastor Dave in November. We will be able to afford $1200 this year. Charlie McCabe to arrange for presentation.\n\nOld Business\n\nSpring Training Games\n\nMets game 3/25/24\n\n67 signups for this game. 56 passenger bus reserved so there will be a waiting list. Price will be $70 for game and bus.\n\nBraves game 3/10/24\n\n44 signups for this game. Use of 56 passenger bus will set cost at least $75 for the trip. If bus gets filled, the $70 cost like above will apply. If less and 36 passenger bus is used, the price will rise accordingly.\n\nPayment to reserve seats\n\nMoney for tickets must be to Steinbrenner Field by 11/15/23 to hold seating. Members must have payment in by approximately 11/12/23. George will email those who have signed up with final details and due date to hold seats.\n\nNew Business\n\nUpcoming Meetings\n\nNovember – Club Officer nominations\n\n- Sozo Kids donation\n\nDecember – no meeting\n\nJanuary – annual Pizza Party and possible appearance by Manny Crespo (Red Sox affiliation and other long time coaching experience.\n\nYankee Talk\n\nThe brief discussions dealt with things the Yankees may do in the off season. FA options such as Juan Soto and Cory Bellinger are high on the list, with Bellinger looking like the most affordable and longer term. Soto only one year of control left.\n\nTrading Gleyber Torres prior to his FA year may be a good thing for affordability and the chance to receive better players back in such a trade.\n\nOnce again, pitching rears its ugly head with the underperformance by Carlos Rodon and whether Nestor Cortes will bounce back. Severino and German will be gone. Michael King looking like a good option at starting pitcher so bullpen will need help and does Clay Holmes remain closer.\n\nLegends Cruise\n\nIt was also noted that 5 Club members have signed up for the Legends Cruise in early December that features many Yankee favorites like Ron Blomberg, Mickey Rivers, Greg Nettles and more. Yankee announcer Michael Kay is also going to sail also.\n\nThere is an effort being made to get transportation to Fort Lauderdale where the ship sets sail. Due to the low number of Club attendees, that may not happen. George Reever said he would inquire with the cruise organizers.\n\n50/50\n\nTwo winners at $40 each.\n\nNext meeting date:\n\nNovember 22, 2023\n\n7:00 PM - Eisenhower Recreation Center\n\nSubmitted: November 4, 2023\n\nRon Majesky\n\nClub Secretary\n\nMEETING MINUTES\n\nDate: September 27, 2023\n\nPlace: Eisenhower Recreation Center\n\nThe meeting was called to order by President George Reever at 7:00 PM. The Pledge of Allegiance was said by all and a moment of silence for our fallen heroes followed.\n\nThe Club recognized the passing of HOF 3B Brooks Robinson, both the great player and the great man.\n\nGuest Speaker\n\nRyan Weiss\n\nSports writer for the Daily Sun. Born in Voorhees, NJ which made his family ties to Philadelphia and South Jersey. Moved to Ocala when he was 7 years old but maintained the passion for Philadelphia sports.\n\nGraduate of UCF in 2018 with degrees in journalism and sports management. Has covered recreational sports in the Villages since 2021.\n\nRyan dressed in Phillies garb acted as a moderator and discussed the future of the Yankees and what did the audience think. He took a little razzing about being a Phillies fan and their loss in the 2009 World Series, but the Phillies are in the playoffs this year and the Yankees were dismal in their quest.\n\nThe Club was a little mixed on firing Aaron Boone and Ryan thought Boone would be fired. He suggested hiring Kevin Long, Phillies hitting coach and former Yankees hitting coach. Some members would like to see Don Mattingly take over.\n\nRyan asked about the current Free Agent market and who might the Yankees pursue in the off season. He thought Blake Snell of the Padres may be a good fit and a strong left handed pitcher. He also agreed with a member that Juan Soto may be the one young and athletic superstar that would make sense for the Yankees outfield issues.\n\nAcquiring Matt Chapman at 3B might be an option. Trading Gleyber Torres in his walk year and moving a Baby Bomber to 2B (Volpe?) could be a possibility, but some members were not sold on trading the best hitting Yankee this season.\n\nRyan said his favorite sports movie is “Moneyball” and follows the analytics pretty closely. His favorite Phillies player was Chase Utley as a contact hitter with some power and a clutch hitter you could depend on.\n\nRyan asked if the Yankees should build for the future or take a win now stance. It was pretty much agreed that a combination with the Baby Bombers and free agency would hopefully lead to a win now approach. Ryan felt the Yankees are one of the few teams that can afford the win now cost.\n\nTreasurer’s Report\n\nPer Treasurer Murray Deutsch 9/19/23\n\nChecking account = $ 12,388.01\n\nPetty Cash = $ 265.00\n\n$ 12,653.01\n\nSozo Kids account = $ 1,202.34\n\nCommittee Reports\n\nVacant - MEMBERSHIP\n\nRon Majesky - WEB MASTER\n\nBill Gerke - NOMINATING COMMITTEE\n\nVacant - CLUB OUTINGS\n\nGeorge Reever - YANKEE TRIPS\n\nCharlie McCabe - SOZO KIDS COLLECTION\n\nDick Sigston - PUBLICITY\n\nJoe & Karen Sullivan - REFRESHMENTS & 50/50\n\nAnthony Scutti - SPEAKERS\n\nFayne Reever - GENERAL MEETING DUTIES\n\nYankee trips to be noted later in these minutes.\n\nNomination for Club Officers will be taken in November for the 2024 – 2025 term.\n\nThere is enough money in the Sozo Kids account to present to Pastor Dave in November.\n\nOld Business\n\nYankees @ Rays Game\n\nBusload to St. Pete on August 26 to watch Yankees play the Rays.\n\nSadly, the Yankees only managed 2 hits and lost 3 – 0.\n\nThanks to Murray Deutsch for managing the trip.\n\nGame Viewing at Gators Brownwood\n\nThursday August 31 Yankees lost to the Tigers 4 – 3\n\nTuesday September 19 Yankees lost to Toronto 7 – 1\n\nAttendance at these events has been disappointing.\n\nPresident George asked the Club to support these game viewings with more attendance. A 200 member Club should be able to seat at least 20 to 30 members for these games.\n\nIf low attendance keeps up, these events will be canceled.\n\nSports Card & Memorabilia Show\n\nSeptember 2 at Savannah Center\n\nTwo new members agreed to join the Club\n\nThanks to Joe Guarnieri, Jim Pendergast, George Reever, and Ron Majesky for manning the table\n\nNew Business\n\nUpcoming Meetings\n\nOctober - Trivia by Bob Cusano\n\nNovember – Club Officer nominations\n\n- Sozo Kids donation\n\nDecember – no meeting\n\nJanuary – annual Pizza Party\n\nYankee Talk\n\nThe bulk of the discussion dealt with what the Yankees should do to turn things around for 2024. There was a lot of feeling that Giancarlo Stanton should be paid off or traded. The pitching needs help if Cortez cannot come back to what he was and Rodon continues to tank. Michael King looks like a good option as a starter. Need to find a top closer like Josh Hader with Clay Holmes so unpredictable.\n\nTrading Gleyber Torres in his walk year should yield a decent pitcher or player based on Torres good year. Second base could end up being Volpe’s with Peraza moving to SS.\n\nThe Yankees are getting old and they are not athletic. Some good contact hitters to get on before the HRs would be ideal.\n\n50/50\n\nTwo winners at $29 each.\n\nNext meeting date:\n\nOctober 25, 2023\n\n7:00 PM - Eisenhower Recreation Center\n\nSubmitted: October 1, 2023\n\nRon Majesky\n\nClub Secretary\n\nMEETING MINUTES\n\nDate: August 23, 2023\n\nPlace: Eisenhower Recreation Center\n\nThe meeting was called to order by President George Reever at 7:00 PM.

His focus was on chiropractic medicine and its benefits to pain management. Not all symptoms are arthritis, bursitis, etc. Spine issues radiate to other areas of the body.\n\nSeveral of the members related their experience with chiropractors and were generally positive on how they were helped.\n\nTreasurer’s Report\n\nPer Treasurer Murray Deutsch 6/16/23\n\nChecking account = $ 12,430.78\n\nPetty Cash = $ 265.00\n\n$ 12,695.78\n\nSozo Kids account = $ 1,166.34\n\nCommittee Reports\n\nVacant - MEMBERSHIP\n\nRon Majesky - WEB MASTER\n\nBill Gerke - NOMINATING COMMITTEE\n\nVacant - CLUB OUTINGS\n\nGeorge Reever - YANKEE TRIPS\n\nCharlie McCabe - SOZO KIDS COLLECTION\n\nDick Sigston - PUBLICITY\n\nJoe & Karen Sullivan - REFRESHMENTS & 50/50\n\nAnthony Scutti - SPEAKERS\n\nFayne Reever - GENERAL MEETING DUTIES\n\nYankee trips to be noted later in these minutes.\n\nNomination for Club Officers will be taken in November for the 2024 – 2025 term.\n\nThere is enough money in the Sozo Kids account to present to Pastor Dave in November.\n\nOld Business\n\nYankees @ Rays Game\n\nGame this Saturday August 26 @ 4:10 pm\n\n54 members have paid to date, 54 tickets purchased, but there is one dropout who needs to sell a ticket.\n\nBus leaving at 1:00 pm from Lowes Wildwood parking lot.\n\nGame Viewing at Gators Brownwood\n\nNext game Thursday August 31 @ 1:10 pm @Detroit.\n\nNew Business\n\nUpcoming Meetings\n\nSeptember speaker – Ryan Weiss, Daily Sun sports writer\n\nOctober - Trivia by Bob Cusano\n\nNovember – Club Officer nominations\n\nSozo Kids Donation\n\nMemorabilia Auction Discussion\n\nLooks like sometime after the first of the year (2024)\n\nClub takes in items at meeting and auctions off for Sozo Kids charity?\n\nMaybe 3 items per member max with suggested minimum bid?\n\nAll memorabilia donated by members and goes to charity; no net to member for minimum bid?

A suggestion of doing the auction in the fall was well received – a September or October meeting.\n\nYankee Talk\n\nThe majority of the discussion focused on the recent poor play of the Yankees after the Aaron Judge toe injury on June 3. Although the players have not performed, the discussion vented criticism toward GM Brian Cashman and Manager Aaron Boone.\n\nJosh Donaldson is still underperforming badly and inciting the wrath of the fans. Giancarlo Stanton has not swung the bat well since coming off the IL a month ago. Injuries are still plentiful and once again the training/strength coaching came under criticism.\n\nThe following hitting stats were displayed to show how poorly the Yankees are performing to date:\n\nYankees Batting\n\nAvg 0.228 League Avg 0.248 Rank 28/30 MLB, 15/16 AL\n\nOBP 0.291 League Avg 0.320 Rank 29/30 MLB, 15/16 AL\n\nOPS 0.704 League Avg 0.729 Rank 22/30 MLB, 9/15 AL\n\nHR 112 League Avg 90 Rank 5/30 MLB, 3/15 AL\n\nRuns 339 League Avg 356 Rank 19/30 MLB, 10/15 AL\n\nLOB 438 League Avg 532 Rank #1 MLB and AL for least because they don’t get runners on base.\n\nThe Yankees pitching, especially the bullpen is the main reason why they are hanging around in the AL East and the thirdWild Card slot:\n\nYankees Pitching\n\nERA 3.67 League Avg 4.25 Rank 3/30 MLB, 3/15 AL\n\nBB 252 League Avg 260 Rank 17/30 MLB, 6/15 AL\n\nK 690 League Avg 681 Rank 13/30 MLB, 9/15 AL\n\nHR 86 League Avg 92 Rank 16/30 MLB, 9/15 AL\n\nYankees defense near the top of MLB for most errors:\n\nYankee Defense\n\nErrors 47 League Avg 41 Rank 7/30 MLB, 3/15 AL most errors\n\n50/50\n\nTwo winners at $24 each.\n\nNext meeting date:\n\nJuly 26, 2023\n\n7:00 PM - Eisenhower Recreation Center\n\nSubmitted: July 7, 2023\n\nRon Majesky\n\nClub Secretary\n\nMEETING MINUTES\n\nDate: April 26, 2023\n\nPlace: Eisenhower Recreation Center\n\nThe meeting was called to order by President George Reever at 7:00 PM. The Pledge of Allegiance was said by all and a moment of silence for our fallen heroes followed.\n\nGeorge introduced the evening’s speaker, former MLB catcher Bob Stinson, a return speaker to our Club.\n\nBob “Scrap Iron” Stinson\n\nBorn in Elkin, NC\n\nDrafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers out of Miami Dade Community College in 1969. Also played for the Cardinals, Astros, Expos, Royals and Mariners.\n\nCatcher for the Chris Chambliss HR in the 1976 ALCS final game versus the KC Royals.\n\nBest years with the Seattle Mariners and finished his career in 1981.\n\nBob told of how he got his nickname “Scrap Iron”. He received it from Tommy LaSorda in his rookie year for the Dodgers in Albuquerque after he made a catch in the outfield and ran through the fence. Went to the hospital but got out to play the next day where he went three for four with a HR and 6RBI.\n\nHe told us of his early days growing up in Miami and played American Legion ball at the age of twelve. He also played at Miami High plus playing football.\n\nHe once hit grand slams in one season of MLB from both sides of the plate.\n\nHe recalled Red Sox HOF Jim Rice breaking his bat on a check swing and not being called out for the bat going over the plate for a strikeout. Stinson argued but his Manager Daryl Johnson got thrown out and was angry that he got tossed and not Stinson.\n\nHe claimed that he thought the best pitchers of his day were Don Drysdale, Bob Gibson and Steve Carlton but also too many others to mention. He also said Charlie Hough was the hardest pitcher to catch because of the knuckleball and that J.R. Richards was also hard to catch because of his speed and great stuff.\n\nHe said he did not call the pitch to Chris Chambliss in 1976. That came from the pitching coach.\n\nClaimed to receive 6 to 8 concussions per year while catching and being run over at the plate. Does not like the new rules. Lots of stolen bases now with new rules, but there were many good base stealers in his day.\n\nHe recalled when in Cleveland one evening that the scoreboard used to white out the incoming pitch once in awhile and a pitch hit umpire Nestor Chylak. Chylak was angry and said Stinson did it on purpose. It happened again in the game and Chylak was really angry. Stinson asked him what the pitch call was and Chylak told him he couldn’t see the ball either.\n\nThe Club enjoyed Stinson’s talk and the many humorous stories he related in his presentation.\n\nTreasurer’s Report\n\nPer Treasurer Murray Deutsch 4/12/23\n\nChecking account = $ 7,531.33 (Tarpons game checks to be deposited)\n\nPetty Cash = $ 265.00\n\n$ 7,796.33\n\nSozo Kids account = $ 831.46 ($42 dollars raised at 4/23 Gators viewing selling baseball cards donated by Ron Cavanaugh)\n\nCommittee Reports\n\nVacant - MEMBERSHIP\n\nRon Majesky - WEB MASTER\n\nBill Gerke - NOMINATING COMMITTEE\n\nVacant - CLUB OUTINGS\n\nGeorge Reever - YANKEE TRIPS\n\nCharlie McCabe - SOZO KIDS COLLECTION\n\nDick Sigston - PUBLICITY\n\nJoe & Karen Sullivan - REFRESHMENTS & 50/50\n\nAnthony Scutti - SPEAKERS\n\nFayne Reever - GENERAL MEETING DUTIES\n\nYankee trips to be noted later in these minutes.\n\nOld Business\n\nSpring Training Game\n\nSunday March 26 game versus Blue Jays.\n\nTrip went well.

Prefer better stationing of serving points to avoid long lines.\n\nGeneral opinion was a resounding “yes” to return again.\n\nMembership also willing to consider a similar type event at Lakeland vs Tarpons as a nice change.\n\nGeorge also reviewed the Club trip policy where a member expresses interest in a game then pays for the game/transportation by a deadline date. The ticket(s) is the members responsibility unless a member on a waiting list takes the ticket(s). If not, the member must find a member or guest of a member to buy the ticket(s).\n\nEmail notifications are sent with information on the event from time to time to inform members of important information on dates, bus transportation, times, etc. George urged members to check their email spam folders if no emails are received. If that doesn’t work, a phone call to request information should be made.\n\nYankees @ Rays Game\n\nSunday May 7 - 1:40 pm start\n\nCost including bus $80\n\n56 passenger bus full for trip.\n\nBus leaving Lowes (Wildwood) at 10;30 am.

The main points were the many injuries the Yankees have incurred, the shakiness of the starting pitching, and the ongoing platooning in LF with no success.\n\n50/50\n\nThree winners at $42 each.\n\nNext meeting date:\n\nMay 24, 2023\n\n7:00 PM - Eisenhower Recreation Center\n\nSubmitted: May 13, 2023\n\nRon Majesky\n\nClub Secretary\n\nMEETING MINUTES\n\nDate: March 22, 2023\n\nPlace: Eisenhower Recreation Center\n\nThe meeting was called to order by President George Reever at 7:00 PM. The Pledge of Allegiance was said by all and a moment of silence for our fallen heroes followed.\n\nGeorge introduced the evening’s speaker, “Sudden” Sam McDowell.\n\n“Sudden” Sam McDowell\n\nBorn in Pittsburgh, PA\n\nMLB career spanned from 1961 to 1975 playing 11 years for the Cleveland Indians. He also pitched for the Giants, Yankees (1973 – 1974), and Pirates. He was a six time All Star, AL ERA leader (1965), and five-time AL strikeout leader (325 Ks in 1965).\n\nCleveland Indians HOF\n\nDegrees in addiction & sports psychology from University of Pittsburgh and long-time involvement with the Baseball Assistance Team (B.A.T) as a mental health/addiction counselor and Board member/Vice President.\n\nSam talked about his early years in baseball and his disagreements with Cleveland Manager Birdie Tebbets, who wanted to call all his pitches. He was sent down to the minors and refused to come back up if that continued. Harmon Killebrew was responsible for his nickname of “Sudden Sam” and Frank Howard was his nemesis at the plate.\n\nHe considered the starting rotation of himself, Louis Tiant, Tommy John, Sonny Siebert, and Steve Hargan as one of the greatest in baseball history.\n\nHis career with the Yankees (1973-1974) was short lived due to a rotator cuff injury and he was out of baseball by 1975 due to his alcoholism. He went back to school at the University of Pittsburgh and got degrees in addiction & sports psychology. He started his own practice, but in 1985, MLB Commissioner Bowie Kuhn asked him to start up a program on drug abuse. He then went on to the Texas Rangers and Toronto Blue Jays as drug and alcohol counselor to those teams.\n\nHe got involved with B.A.T (Baseball Assistance Program) to help out ballplayers and their families with substance abuse problems throughout baseball. As a note, he saved Bernie Carbo from committing suicide. He served for over two decades with B.A.T. helping ballplayers.\n\nSam has written a book, The Saga of Sudden Sam, and he sold autographed copies to the Club members. He said a portion of the sales goes to the Wounded Warriors program.\n\nHe took many questions from the audience which covered topics of analytics, modern pitchers/injuries, the emphasis on the HR, and the state of baseball today. He reveled in the fact that he pitched a nine-inning shutout versus Detroit where he threw 240 pitches. He struck out 18 batters but also walked 13. The crowd was very appreciative of his visit to our meeting.\n\nTreasurer’s Report\n\nPer Treasurer Murray Deutsch 3/13/23\n\nChecking account = $ 10,190.18 Petty Cash = $ 265.00\n\n$ 10,455.18\n\nSozo Kids account = $ 719.46\n\nCommittee Reports\n\nVacant - MEMBERSHIP\n\nRon Majesky - WEB MASTER\n\nBill Gerke - NOMINATING COMMITTEE\n\nVacant - CLUB OUTINGS\n\nJim McKenna - YANKEE TRIPS\n\nCharlie McCabe - SOZO KIDS COLLECTION\n\nDick Sigston - PUBLICITY\n\nJoe & Karen Sullivan - REFRESHMENTS & 50/50\n\nAnthony Scutti - SPEAKERS\n\nFayne Reever - GENERAL MEETING DUTIES\n\nYankee trips to be noted later in these minutes.\n\nOld Business\n\nSpring Training Game\n\nSunday March 26 game versus Blue Jays.\n\n1:05 pm start.\n\nBus leaves from Lowes (Trailwinds) at 10:15 am.\n\nFull bus at 56 passengers.\n\nTampa Tarpons Dugout Club Buffet/Game\n\nTuesday April 18 reserved for Club.\n\n6:30 pm start versus Clearwater Threshers\n\nEstimated cost for ticket and meal around $50 for members,\n\nBus cost paid by Club for members.

The Pledge of Allegiance was said by all and a moment of silence for our fallen heroes followed.\n\nGeorge called on member Ed Bloom to introduce the evening’s speaker. Ed was instrumental in securing former MLB pitcher Ray Burris to speak to the Club tonight\n\nRay’s bio abovespeaks for itself and his long career in baseball. He also is currently appearing at Yankee Fantasy Camps at Steinbrenner Field in Tampa.\n\nRay was a member of the 1979 Yankees team and told the crowd of his fond memories of being a Yankee, which he described as top notch. Sadly he recalled the death of Thurman Munson, but also was appreciative of being able to play with Willie Randolph, Ron Guidry, Greg Nettles (the “Instigator”), Luis Tiant (the funniest Yankee along with Cliff Johnson), and being managed by Bob Lemon. Lemon gave him the best advice as to being a good pitcher and turn the page after a bad outing because you would be needed the next day.\n\nRay loved the history of the Yankees and meeting the HOF Old Timers like Mickey, Yogi, Whitey, and many others.\n\nHe had many thoughts on pitching success due to his career and coaching positions he had. Pitchers need to throw strikes and command the plate. There is too much emphasis on analytics such as spin rate, high velocity, etc. Things like ERA and batting average are losing importance. Not enough human element left in the game including umpires.\n\nHe tested the Club’s trivia knowledge by asking who the Black 20 game winners were. The members got most of them, but a few surprises (Vida Blue, Al Downing, Bob Gibson, Dwight Gooden, Mudcat Grant, Fergie Jenkins, Sam Jones, Don Newcombe, Mike Norris, J.R. Richard, Dave Stewart, Earl Wilson, David Price, C.C Sabathia, Dontrelle Willis)\n\nHe took many questions from the members. He thinks Pete Rose will make the Hall of Fame after he is dead. He thinks pitchers are getting so many arm injuries because of mechanics and lack of rest. Not a big fan of the DH going to the NL but he understands the impact on creating positions for players/jobs.\n\nThe members thoroughly enjoyed Ray’s visit to the Club meeting and gave him a standing ovation. Ray signed autographs during the break and chatted with many members.\n\nTreasurer’s Report\n\nPer Treasurer Murray Deutsch 2/14/23\n\nChecking account = $ 8,692.19 (checks for 3/26 game to be deposited $4200)\n\nPetty Cash = $ 265.00\n\n$ 8.957.19\n\nSozo Kids account = $ 556.46\n\nCommittee Reports\n\nVacant - MEMBERSHIP\n\nRon Majesky - WEB MASTER\n\nBill Gerke - NOMINATING COMMITTEE\n\nVacant - CLUB OUTINGS\n\nJim McKenna - YANKEE TRIPS\n\nCharlie McCabe - SOZO KIDS COLLECTION\n\nDick Sigston - PUBLICITY\n\nJoe & Karen Sullivan - REFRESHMENTS & 50/50\n\nAnthony Scutti - SPEAKERS\n\nFayne Reever - GENERAL MEETING DUTIES\n\nYankee trips to be noted later in these minutes.\n\nAnthony Scutti reported that Sam McDowell has agreed to speak to the Club at the March meeting.\n\nOld Business\n\nSpring Training Game\n\nSunday March 26 game versus Blue Jays.\n\n1:05 pm start.

Tommy has been fighting COVID infections for the past few months. His initial bout caused paralysis of his lower body and he had to learn how to walk again. He contracted COVID again and the symptoms were not as severe, but that episode delayed an upcoming surgical procedure that has to be rescheduled.\n\nHis rehab after the surgery will put his recovery past our hope to have him speak in February or March. Based on his poor health, his appearance at the Club may not occur at all and at best probably not until 2024 when we have our membership back in the Villages for the winter.\n\nNew Business\n\nFinancial Audit of Club Finances\n\nYearly audit of finances per Club by-laws\n\nNeed two volunteers to meet with Treasurer Murray Deutsch and review 2022 accounting.\n\nChris Orio and Bill Gerke once again volunteered to conduct the audit.\n\nDate and time to be set up by participants.\n\nSports Card & Memorabilia Show\n\nSaturday January 28 at Laurel Manor\n\n9:00 am to 1:00 pm\n\nNeed volunteers to man the Club table.\n\nGeorge Reever, Joe Marino and Jim Kriner volunteered for the 9 – 11 am shift\n\nRon Majesky and Charlie McCabe volunteered for the 11 am – 100 pm shift\n\nBill Gerke will be there for the entire event and will perform set up and teardown of the Club table.\n\nGame Viewing at Gators Brownwood\n\nThursday March 30 1:05 pm Opening Day vs San Francisco\n\nSunday April 9 1:35 pm @ Baltimore (Easter Sunday – No Good!)\n\nSunday May 21 1:40 pm @ Cincinnati\n\nThursday June 29 3:37 pm @ Oakland (Trivia conflict!)\n\nSunday July 16 3:10 pm @ Colorado\n\nThursday August 24 1:05 pm vs Washington (maybe Trivia conflict)\n\nNote that this listing was revised to the following after the meeting to change Easter Sunday and try to avoid Thursday 4:00 pm deadline at Gators for scheduled Trivia.\n\nThursday March 30 1:05 pm Opening Day vs San Francisco\n\nSunday April 23 1:35 pm vs Toronto\n\nSunday May 28 1:35 pm vs San Diego\n\nSunday June 25 1:35 pm vs Texas\n\nSunday July 16 3:10 pm @ Colorado\n\nThursday August 31 1:10 pm vs Detroit\n\nTuesday September 19 7:05 pm vs Toronto\n\nListing will be on Club Website\n\nGuest Speaker February 22 Meeting\n\nRay Burris\n\nformer MLB pitcher (1973 – 1987) for 7 teams including the Yankees in 1979.\n\nYankee Talk\n\nThe Club discussed the outlook for the 2023 Yankees. It was agreed that there was an infield log jam with the Kids (Peraza, Volpe), Torres, Donaldson, Kiner-Falefa, LeMahieu. Torres and Kiner-Falefa could be some trade bait.\n\nThe Yankees look like they do not want to exceed the next tier of $293M for the luxury tax. Any new free agency pickups could be a problem unless they cut payroll. Looking more like Hicks and Oswaldo Cabrera sharing LF.\n\nPitching looks pretty good with Rodon and Kahnle pickups. Chapman gone! Montas still an issue with shoulder.

The consensus was the Sunday March 19 Orioles game and the Sunday March 26 Blue Jays game.\n\nGeorge pointed out that we needed 36 people to attend each for a full small busload. The games are a week apart and the members will probably split attending between the two.\n\nGeorge will send out the notice to the Club members and give a deadline for ticket money prior to Christmas.

Spring 2023 date hopefully.\n\nThe Club will present our $1,000 donation to Pastor Dave of the Sozo Kids organization at the November meeting.

LeMahieu (to 2026, FA 2027)\n\nHal Steinbrenner announced this date that Aaron Boone will be back in 2023. No word on Brian Cashman whose contract is up at the end of October. Boone’s retention is mixed among the Club member’s feelings. So is the retention of Cashman if that happens.\n\nKeeping Aaron Judge will be the priority for the Yankee front office. The Club felt he may realize around an 8 year deal at $40 million. Giants the main competition and may offer higher but will Judge accept?\n\nA lively discussion took place regarding the outlook for 2023. The main focus was on trying to trade Josh Donaldson based on his poor performance at the plate and his big salary for next year. Probably won’t happen.\n\nGleyber Torres is considered the main trade target based on his pretty good year and the other 2B options with the young prospects and/or D.J. LeMahieu. Could get a decent return for his trade. Maybe package with Donaldson?\n\nThe Club would like to see Anthony Rizzo and Andrew Benintendi sign as Free Agents.\n\nOther Free Agent or trade priorities should be for a closer and a decent starting pitcher.\n\nThere was also discussion about new rules for next year. Very favorable for the pitch clock and the new shift rules. Limited pick off throws and the bigger bases were also mentioned.\n\n50/50\n\nTwo winners at $30 each.\n\nNext meeting date:\n\nNovember 23, 2022\n\n7:00 PM - Eisenhower Recreation Center\n\nSubmitted: November 5, 2022\n\nRon Majesky\n\nClub Secretary\n\nMEETING MINUTES\n\nDate: August 24, 2022\n\nPlace: Eisenhower Recreation Center\n\nThe meeting was called to order by President George Reever at 7:00 PM.

Section 216 first base side this game.\n\nBus leaves 10:15 am from Lowes Wildwood parking lot.\n\nGeorge said that a couple had paid for tickets and then found out they could not attend. They sold their tickets to non-member friends. This is not allowed by Club trip policy. In order to straighten this out, two members purchased the tickets so that they could attend the game.\n\nNew Business\n\nSports Card & Memorabilia Show\n\nSeptember 3 at Savannah Center. 9:00 to 2:00 pm (we close table at 1:00 pm)\n\nGeorge Reever & Jim Geeze man table 9 – 11 am.\n\nJim Pendergast at 11 am to 1 pm. Need volunteer to help Jim on this shift. Joe Kenick volunteered to assist.\n\nBob Cusano’s Trivia\n\nBob led another spirited game of Yankee trivia for the Club. He was surprised at the knowledge of members on some of the more difficult questions. The match was neck and neck to the end with one table taking the first place prizes. Second place prizes were awarded to the highest table prior to the “all in” zeroing out by the rest of the competitors.\n\nYankee Talk\n\nThe discussion was on how bad the Yankees have been playing after the All Star break and especially in August. The hitting has disappeared, especially home runs (except for Aaron Judge who is still in the running to break Roger Maris’ record. The bullpen once the team’s strength has imploded because of injuries and poor performance.\n\nAaron Hicks has earned his place on the bench, Josh Donaldson is no where the player he used to be, and the trade for Montas from The A’s has not gone well. Jordan Montgomery traded to the Cardinals and is pitching like Cy Young. Harrison Bader from the Cardinals still sits on the bench with plantar fasciitis. Andrew Benintendi from KC looks like a good acquisition.\n\nTime will tell if the team hangs on to the AL East lead and ultimately goes a long way in the playoffs and World Series. The general consensus was that they will not win it all this season.\n\n50/50\n\nThere was no drawing and no refreshments due to a snafu in scheduling.\n\nNext meeting date:\n\nSeptember 28, 2022\n\n7:00 PM - Eisenhower Recreation Center\n\nSubmitted: August 30, 2022\n\nRon Majesky\n\nClub Secretary\n\nMEETING MINUTES\n\nDate: July 27, 2022\n\nPlace: Eisenhower Recreation Center\n\nThe meeting was called to order by President George Reever at 7:00 PM.

The membership applauded the honor.\n\nGeorge then introduced the evening’s speaker Fred Rosenthal.\n\nGuest Speaker – Fred Rosenthal\n\nFred Rosenthal has a long and extensive journey in baseball…\n\nHe played baseball growing up and he was a good player, good enough to get a tryout with the Minnesota Twins.\n\nHis baseball career includes player evaluation and selection for international youth tournaments, coaching, umpiring, broadcasting, scouting, and overseeing the construction of two minor league stadiums.\n\nA native of Decorah, a small town in Iowa, Fred lived his dream and is here tonight to share his journey and love of the game and will discuss why baseball is more than just a game.\n\nFred told the Club of his involvement with baseball from his youngest years growing up in Iowa.\n\nHe went all the way from Little League, High School, American legion ball and Umpiring. His career included even wanting to be a priest at a young age. He also joined the Air Force and continued a 35 year to retirement.\n\nHe attended Northern Illinois University and attained a degree in broadcast journalism, but he was not able to further that career as time went on. He drifted toward advertising and marketing and was able to become involved in minor league baseball, stadium construction projects, and even a stint with the Milwaukee Brewers as a scout searching for the real diamonds in the rough that were not the well known upcoming stars.\n\nHe worked at Disney’s ESPN Wide World of Sports complex and enjoyed the Atlanta Braves stay while they were there.\n\nHe even sold wooden bats for awhile – Hoosier Woodforce Bats.\n\nMoved to Florida in 2008 and is now currently a Villages resident.\n\nTreasurer’s Report\n\nPer Treasurer Murray Deutsch 7/13/22\n\nChecking account = $ 10,438.24\n\nPetty Cash $ 265.00\n\n$ 10,703.24\n\nSozo Kids account = $ 1,107.46\n\nCommittee Reports\n\nVacant - MEMBERSHIP\n\nRon Majesky - WEB MASTER\n\nBill Gerke - NOMINATING COMMITTEE\n\nVacant - CLUB OUTINGS\n\nJim McKenna - YANKEE TRIPS\n\nCharlie McCabe - SOZO KIDS COLLECTION\n\nDick Sigston - PUBLICITY\n\nJoe & Karen Sullivan - REFRESHMENTS & 50/50\n\nAnthony Scutti - SPEAKERS\n\nFayne Reever - GENERAL MEETING DUTIES\n\nYankee trips to be noted later in these minutes.\n\nAnthony Scutti trying to contact Bob Stinson to see if he will speak again to the Club and maybe find out more about the girl’s softball teams he helps out with his own money, including his speaker fee.\n\nOld Business\n\nRecap Trip to Tampa Tarpons game 7/7/22\n\n50 members attended (4 members had to cancel out)\n\nPrevious day rainout made for doubleheader for us, but rain canceled the first game & delayed the second until 8:00 pm. We left after 5th inning when rain started again.\n\nFood very good buffet. Very small plates!\n\nNo sit down tables this year, standing hi-tops.\n\nChairs finally brought in so we could watch TV game Yanks vs. Red Sox.\n\nThe members said they would attend again in future if some of these issues could be straightened out.\n\nFuture trips will try to be arranged in April or May to avoid the summer rains.\n\nGame Viewing at Gators Dockside\n\nJune 29 viewing vs Oakland.

Guests pay $65 for event and bus.\n\nBus to leave from Lowes parking lot in Trailwinds Plaza around 3:00 pm.\n\nPlan is to get on the field around 5:00 pm for the group photo and then proceed to the buffet around 5:30 pm. That would give the group an hour before the 6:30 game start to enjoy the meal in an air conditioned place.\n\nBuffet layout to stay in place until 8:00 pm.\n\nNew Business\n\nTommy John\n\nPossible speaking engagement maybe February or March 2023\n\nNegotiating cost and we will have to consider paying an additional cost per member for his appearance.\n\nGeorge has been in contact with Tommy and his wife after receiving the information from Geoff Landis who spoke to us in April. Initial cost estimate for his appearance is $25K. George asked him to consider a lower cost due to the size of our membership. George is going to try to get a fee in the $4K to 5K area. Also nothing on expenses has been talked about yet.\n\nIn order to fund this appearance, the Club discussed the possibilities of charging members and non-members a fee to attend:\n\nMaybe $10/$15 per member and $20/$30 per non member.\n\nThe Eisenhower meeting room could be set up in theater seating style to increase capacity. Theoretically, the room will legally hold 550 people per the fire code notice. Even if the event could bring in 150 to 200 people, the extra fees would go a long way in financing the night.\n\nAdvance publicity with Dick Sigston would be essential to success.\n\nThe Club financial position currently is positive toward a substantial contribution to the cost after the member/non-member income is added in.\n\nGeorge will continue to talk with the Johns to see what it would take to make a deal. The Club membership was very supportive of having Tommy John as a featured speaker.\n\nYankee Talk\n\nThe gathering watched the Yankees play the Rays on the video display and talked a little about the historic season the Yankees are having to date.\n\n50/50\n\nThere were two winners of $30\n\nNext meeting date:\n\nJuly 27, 2022\n\n7:00 PM - Eisenhower Recreation Center\n\nSubmitted: July 18, 2022\n\nRon Majesky\n\nClub Secretary\n\nDate: May 25, 2022\n\nPlace: Eisenhower Recreation Center\n\nThe meeting was called to order by President George Reever at 7:00 PM.

Fayne Reever is recognized for all the help she provides at the monthly meetings.\n\nOld Business\n\nVillages High School Scholarships Update\n\nAwards ceremony held May 17, 2022 @ Savannah Center.\n\nJames Garvey received $1,000 baseball scholarship\n\nReilly Dulin received $1,000 softball scholarship\n\nA photo of Ron Majesky presenting the certificate to a cut out of James Garvey was shown. James was playing that night in the Sectionals.\n\nReilly Dulin was unable to attend and her certificate will be presented to her later.\n\nGame Viewing at Gators Dockside\n\nMay 19 at 12:35 pm vs Baltimore – Gators Dockside Brownwood.

The bid was accepted and the amount of $240 will be placed in the Club’s Sozo Kids account.\n\nThe Club then took a break and got ready for Bob Cusano’s Yankee Trivia!\n\nAfter a very tight battle, two teams were declared winners and got to choose from a variety of books donated to the Club over time.\n\nYankee Talk\n\nA short discussion was held regarding how well the Yankees are playing and especially the pitching staff. It is hoped recent short term injuries and Tommy John surgeries to Chad Green and Luis Gil don’t slow down the good effort so far. The Club is also really down on Joey Gallo and his inability to cut down on strikeouts and snap out of a miserable 2021 and 2022 slump.\n\n50/50\n\nThere were two winners of $34\n\nNext meeting date:\n\nJune 22, 2022\n\n7:00 PM - Eisenhower Recreation Center\n\nSubmitted: June 6, 2022\n\nRon Majesky\n\nClub Secretary\n\nMEETING MINUTES\n\nDate: April 27, 2022\n\nPlace: Eisenhower Recreation Center\n\nThe meeting was called to order by President George Reever at 7:00 PM. The Pledge of Allegiance was said by all and a moment of silence for our fallen heroes followed.\n\nIn addition, a moment of silence for recognition of a former Club member that passed recently:\n\nMichael Ehret 2/8/22\n\nGeorge then introduced our speaker for the evening, former Yankee advertising executive Geoff Landis\n\nBorn in 1944 in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nMoved to Long Island at 5 years of age.\n\nWorked as advertising agent for the Yankees from 1992 – 1995\n\nLives in Lakewood Ranch outside of Sarasota\n\nGeoff originally started getting clients to advertise in Yankee Magazine where he met Michael Yormach (currently CEO of the Florida Panthers plus other entities). Yormach introduced Geoff to John Fugasi who was the Marketing Director for the Yankees. Fugasi got Geoff involved with the New York Urban League and the advertising for the black football games held in Yankee Stadium in that time period. In fact, he had the opportunity to escort Grambling head coach Eddie Robinson in a tour of NYC.\n\nHis agency was named to the Yankee account in 1993 and one of the first items was the Yankee team picture at Spring Training in Fort Lauderdale. Geoff joked that Wade Boggs never forgave him for having to be caught squinting into the sun in the final team photo.\n\nHe got involved in "
