Recently diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimers, Aramis clamors for more time with Uncle Mike, the man who “taught him everything” and shouts in disbelief over the top of thundering, arena-shaking drums from Ladaniel Gipson.\n\nAlongside the single, Enumclaw have teamed up with frequent collaborator and director John C. Peterson, who also directed the video for lead single “Change,” for another explosive music video centering on one long zoom out shot.\n\n“This video all started with a painting that Andrew Durgin-Barnes did for Rizzo and Quasi Skateboards,” director John C. Peterson says of the video. “Barnes’ painting screamed a story so I’d always wanted to adapt it to a one-take music video. Once I told Aramis my idea over a year ago, he was always adamant we had to do it. ‘Not Just Yet’ was the perfect song for it. Short and sweet. Loud. We did our best to bring the painting to life and I think we did it justice. It was extremely gratifying to have Barnes there on set and approve of what we were doing. We encountered a million problems in pre-production and the video almost fell through countless times… turns out doing a music video that requires a techno-crane, a city alley, explosives, and children is difficult to pull off.”\n\nCo-produced by Ben Zaidi and Enumclaw, Home in Another Life is the natural expansion of the high-octane rock foundation the band built with their widely-praised 2022 debut album Save The Baby. Across the eleven tracks of Home in Another Life, vocalist and principle songwriter Aramis Johnson cracks open his chest cavity for quakingly tender songs written and performed to electrify basement shows and reverberate through arenas in equal measure. Aramis and Enumclaw write and perform like a band wrestling with the weight of growing up without looking for pity or to wallow in that baggage, while harnessing the power of reckoning with those changes head-on and kicking the door down for bands just like them in a predominately white indie-rock space. Home In Another Life is louder, faster, poignant and achingly resonant, but doesn’t forget how to have fun and enjoy the moment too. Home in Another Life brings the world to Tacoma rather than the other way around.\n\nEnumclaw will also be joining twen on a run of dates this Summer across the US, beginning August 4th in Chattanooga, TN and spanning across the country before it concludes on September 3rd in Fayetteville, AR. In the time since the release of Save The Baby, Enumclaw has criss-crossed North America performing across the continent to serve fans in both major markets and small towns that are often overlooked on routed tour runs. Alongside the announcement of Home In Another Life, the band released a tour documentary recounting their first tour run overseas and expressing an appreciation for the long nights, early mornings and the full scope of life on tour, narrated by Aramis Johnson. Enumclaw is rounded out by guitarist Nathan Cornell, drummer Ladaniel Gipson, bassist (and Aramis’ younger brother) Eli Edwards.

There was a moment in the fall of 2020 when Great Grandpa - made of close-knit friends Al Menne, Dylan Hanwright, Cam LaFlam, and Pat and Carrie Goodwin - didn’t know if they would go on. They had just begun work on the follow-up to 2019’s immensely praised Four of Arrows when each member was called in different directions—to new countries, new jobs, new life stages. But as with any good relationship built on mutual love, trust, and a mountain of shared history, the quintet—who grew up in Seattle and have been making music together for a decade—were drawn back into one another’s orbits in 2023. “Time passed and I missed my friends,” Al puts it simply. After reconnecting, the band decided to scrap most of what they had previously recorded, but the exhilarating “Kid” remained as a true standout.\n\n“Kid” unfolds like a rock opera, moving deftly through a sea of melodies and scene changes. Pat and Carrie wrote the lyrics in the aftermath of the loss of their first pregnancy. “Things will happen when the timing is right,” Carrie reflects of that time, a sentiment that became the song’s glowing ember: “All good things in time define their meaning.”\n\nFrom the sparkling pop-grunge of their first record Plastic Cough (2017), to the sprawling indie rock of Four of Arrows, Great Grandpa has been on a clear trajectory of both refining and re-defining their sonic identity. “Kid” is the first taste of more Great Grandpa to come.\n\nHorse Jumper Of Love release new single/video for 'Today's Iconoclast\"\n\nNew album \"Disaster Trick\" out 8/16\n\nHorse Jumper of Love release “Today’s Iconoclast” latest from their anticipated new album Disaster Trick, due August 16th on Run For Cover Records. The disarmingly raw track imbued with wry humor comes with a video directed by Rhys Scarabosio.\n\n“I was watching a Pasolini film and read someone describe him as an iconoclast. I became obsessed with that word and idea. In order to make something good, you have to destroy a belief in some way. You can’t stay static, you have to accept change and be able to adjust,” Dimitri Giannopoulos explains. “I was thinking everyone should try to be as iconoclastic as they can because a lot of people end up being unhappy or unsatisfied. I think we all could be happier if we made an effort to destroy what we believe to be true about our own desires.”\n\nHorse Jumper of Love, who are currently on the road with DIIV and will be touring in support of Disaster Trick on a headline run in the fall, have also announced a EU and UK tour that kicks off in late October. All dates below.\n\nDisaster Trick finds the trio cranking up the volume while keeping the no-frills intimacy they’re known for. Frontman Dimitri Giannopoulos’ evocative lyrics and arrangements suddenly turn from delicate to blistering, their music is full of intensity, contrasting between quiet and loud, heavy and gentle, and animated by stark emotion and straightforward, timeless songwriting.\n\nDisaster Trick feels like a creative reset for the band, partly due to Giannopoulos’ recent sobriety. “This was the first album I've ever done where I went into it with a very clear mind,” he says. “In the past, we would just show up at a studio, drink, and record. Here, everything felt purposeful.” With this newfound energy, the band entered Asheville, North Carolina’s Drop of Sun Studios with producer Alex Farrar (Wednesday, Indigo De Souza). The recordings soar with searing guitars and an unshakeable rhythm section, comprised of bassist John Margaris and drummer James Doran. Additionally, the album features contributions from Wednesday’s Karly Hartzman, MJ Lenderman and Ella Williams of Squirrel Flower.\n\nTour Dates:\n\nJuly 16 - Howard Theatre - Washington DC ^\n\nJuly 17 - The National - Richmond, VA ^\n\nJuly 19 - The Music Farm - Charleston, SC ^\n\nJuly 20 - House of Blues - Orlando, FL ^\n\nJuly 21 - The Ground - Miami, FL ^\n\nJuly 23 - The Orpheum - Tampa, FL ^\n\nJuly 24 - Handlebar - Pensacola, FL\n\nJuly 25 - Buckhead Theatre - Atlanta, GA ^\n\nJuly 27 - Turner Hall - Milwaukee, WI ^\n\nJuly 28 - First Avenue - Minneapolis, MN ^\n\nJuly 30 - Thalia Hall - Chicago, IL ^\n\nJuly 31 - Majestic Theatre - Detroit, MI ^\n\nAug 1 - Meteor - Windsor, ON\n\nAug 2 - The Concert Hall - Toronto, ON ^\n\nAug 3 - La Sala Rossa - Montreal, QC\n\nAug 4 - Oxbow Blending & Bottling - Portland, ME\n\nAug 5 - Royale - Boston, MA ^\n\nAug 6 - Union Transfer - Philadelphia, PA ^\n\nAug 7 - Brooklyn Paramount - Brooklyn, NY ^\n\nAug 11 - No Fun - Troy, NY +\n\nAug 16 - Banquet Records - Kingston, UK ~\n\nAug 17 - Pie & Vinyl - Southsea, UK ~\n\nAug 18 - Rough Trade East - London, UK ~\n\nAug 19 - Rough Trade - Bristol, UK ~\n\nAug 20 - Rough Trade - Nottingham, UK ~\n\nAug 21 - Rough Trade - Liverpool, UK ~\n\nSept 14 - Mahall’s - Cleveland, OH ☆∆\n\nSept 19 - Polaris Hall - Portland, OR ☆&\n\nSept 20 - Fox Theater - Vancouver, BC ☆\n\nSept 21 - Barboza - Seattle, WA ☆&\n\nSept 23 - Holland Project - Reno, NV ☆*\n\nSept 24 - Rickshaw Stop - San Francisco, CA ☆\n\nSept 26 - Lodge Room - Los Angeles, CA ☆\n\nSept 27 - Soda Bar - San Diego, CA ☆*\n\nSept 28 - Valley Bar - Phoenix, AZ ☆*\n\nSept 30 - Rubber Gloves - Denton, TX ☆!\n\nOct 1 - Parish - Austin, TX ☆!\n\nOct 4 - Blue Room - Nashville, TN = #\n\nOct 5 - Ace of Cups - Columbus, OH = #\n\nOct 6 - Bottlerocket Social Hall - Pittsburgh, PA = #\n\nOct 23 - The Windmill - London, UK\n\nOct 26 - Clwb Ifor Bach - Cardiff, UK\n\nOct 28 - Brudenell Social Club - Leeds, UK\n\nOct 29 - Stereo - Glasgow, UK\n\nOct 30 - Cluny 2 - Newcastle, UK\n\nNov 1 - Tsunami Club - Cologne, DE\n\nNov 2 - LARK - Berlin, DE\n\nNov 4 - Rotown - Rotterdam, NL\n\nNov 6 - La Maroquinerie - Paris, FR\n\nNov 9 - Pitchfork Festival - London, UK\n\nNov 12 - Pod Minoga - Poznań, PL\n\nNov 13 - Voodoo - Warsaw, PL\n\n^ w/ DIIV\n\n+ w/ Babehoven\n\n~ Dimitri Giannopoulos solo\n\n☆ w/ Teethe\n\n∆ w/ villagerrr\n\n& w/ Guitar\n\n* w/ Sour Widows\n\n! w/ Shallowater\n\n= w/ Truth Club\n\n# w/ Joyer\n\nArmlock's \"Seashell Angel Lucky Charm\" out today\n\nUpcoming Shows w/ Cloud Nothings, Slow Pulp & Pitchfork London\n\n\"...there’s a deliberateness to everything you hear in Armlock’s music, a sense that it’s been pored over and ruthlessly curated. Yet paradoxically, the effect is to allow emotion to flow naturally, creating space for the listener to navigate their personal headspace.\" - Bandcamp Daily\n\n\"...a gentler take on slowcore convention that shares more in common musically with their peers Hovvdy and Alex G.\" - FLOOD Magazine\n\nArmlock, the up-and-coming Australian duo of Simon Lam and Hamish Mitchell, have released their new album, Seashell Angel Lucky Charm, out today via Run For Cover Records. Clocking in at just 18 minutes, Seashell Angel Lucky Charm provides instantly immersive indie rock that's at once impressionistic and accessible, ambiguous yet refreshingly earnest.\n\nEarly singles \"Fear,\" \"Ice Cold,\" and \"Guardian\" introduced Armlock's intricate sound and garnered attention from the likes of Stereogum, The FADER, BrooklynVegan, FLOOD Magazine, Paste Magazine, Bandcamp Daily, and more), and today listeners can hear Seashell Angel Lucky Charm in full. Now's the time to get on board as the band are shaping up for a big 2024, including their first ever US shows, tour dates with Cloud Nothings and Slow Pulp, performing at Pitchfork Music Festival London, and more (see full tour itinerary below).\n\nLongtime friends and collaborators, Lam (vocals and guitar) and Mitchell (guitar and keyboards) met studying jazz at Monash University in Melbourne, eventually discovering a shared love of electronic music. After a handful of electronic and dance-oriented projects (I’lls, Couture, Kllo) Armlock came together and the two began incorporating guitar into the music they were making for the first time. Seashell Angel Lucky Charm is the imaginative and sonically rich result. The music at times recalls Pinback’s lean alternative, Alex G’s adventurous indie, or the wave of mysterious-yet-endearing genre-bending music coming out of the UK from label’s like Dean Blunt’s World Music or Vegyn’s PLZ Make It Ruins. Lam's vocals sit up front, often buoyed by spare guitar lines and a simple but steady beat, with ample space is left for production flourishes like distant laughter, chopped up samples, and pitched squeals to ping around the listener’s ears and leave you ready to hit repeat.\n\nCursive share new single & video for \"Botch Job\"\n\nNew album Devourer out 9/13\n\nToday Cursive have shared their new single “Botch Job,” the propulsive opener of their forthcoming album, Devourer. An ear-quaking, catchy banger that rips through its 2:47 runtime, the song is accompanied by a video from director Travis Stevens (A Wounded Fawn, Jakob’s Wife, Girl On The Third Floor); it’s the second in the band’s series of horror-themed clips following lead single “Up and Away,” directed by Brea Grant (12 Hour Shift, Torn Hearts). “‘Botch Job’ is a rumination on what one has done with this life and those unfulfilling feelings that may accompany such thoughts. At this point, I don’t care to know what damage my body has incurred from years of abuse,” explains singer/guitarist Tim Kasher. “It’s those anxiety-fueled gremlins keeping you restless in the dead of night, but put to song.” Devourer, out September 13th, is now available for preorder.\n\nCursive, who will perform September 20th at Riot Fest, will embark on their fall U.S. run in support of Devourer on October 18th in hometown Omaha, NE. A current itinerary is below.\n\nArmlock Premiere New Single/Video \"Fear\"\n\nSeashell Angel Lucky Charm Out 7/12\n\nArmlock, the up-and-coming Australian duo of Simon Lam and Hamish Mitchell, are gearing up to release their new album, Seashell Angel Lucky Charm, this Friday, July 12th, on Run For Cover Records. Today they've teamed with FLOOD Magazine to premiere one more early single, \"Fear.\"\n\nClocking in at just 18 minutes, Seashell Angel Lucky Charm provides instantly immersive indie rock that's at once impressionistic and accessible, ambiguous yet refreshingly earnest. The album's earlier singles \"Ice Cold\" and \"Guardian\" introduced the world to Armlock's intricate sound (and garnered attention from the likes of Stereogum, The FADER, BrooklynVegan, and more), and \"Fear\" just might be their catchiest offering yet. FLOOD praised the track and its accompanying music video, calling it \"a gentler take on slowcore convention that shares more in common musically with their peers Hovvdy and Alex G.\"\n\nLongtime friends and collaborators, Lam (vocals and guitar) and Mitchell (guitar and keyboards) met studying jazz at Monash University in Melbourne, eventually discovering a shared love of electronic music.

Prior to that the band will be playing three Australian record release shows and appearing at Pitchfork Music Festival in London.

Modern Baseball released their debut full-length Sports later that year on Lame-O Records, which they self-recorded and produced. After spending the summer of 2013 touring heavily across the US, the band headed into Studio A in Philadelphia to self-record You're Going to Miss It All. Mixed by Jonathan Low at Minor Street Recordings and mastered by Will Yip, You're Going to Miss It All features 12 tracks that showcase the band's signature witty indie-pop.\n\nEnumclaw joins RFC, \"Home In Another Life\" out 8/30\n\nAugust US tour with Twen\n\nTacoma, Washington’s-own Enumclaw announces their sophomore album Home in Another Life, out August 30th on RFC. Celebrating the signing and the announcement of their new album, Enumclaw shares new single “Change.” The song is the first taste of what fans can expect from Home In Another Life, paired with a heartwarming video directed by frequent collaborator John C. Peterson.\n\nCo-produced by Ben Zaidi and Enumclaw, Home in Another Life is the natural expansion of the high-octane rock foundation the band built with their widely-praised 2022 debut album Save The Baby. Across the eleven tracks of Home in Another Life, vocalist and principle songwriter Aramis Johnson opens his chest cavity for louder, resolute songs written to pour out of basement shows and reverberate through stadiums in equal measure. With uncomplicated songwriting that crystallizes distinct feelings – ashing cigarettes on the kitchen counter to incite a reaction or finding truth at the bottom of a beer can – anthemic guitar riffs, and an electric energy, Aramis and the band have made their most resonant body of work to-date. Home in Another Life brings the world to Tacoma rather than the other way around. Enumclaw is rounded out by guitarist Nathan Cornell, drummer Ladaniel Gipson, bassist (and Aramis’ younger brother) Eli Edwards.\n\nEnumclaw will also be joining twen on a run of dates this Summer across the US, beginning August 4th in Chattanooga, TN and spanning across the country before it concludes on September 3rd in Fayetteville, AR.\n\n8/4 - Chattanooga, TN @ Cherry Street Tavern\n\n8/5 - Birmingham, AL @ Saturn\n\n8/7 - Lexington, KY @ The Burl\n\n8/8 - Nashville, TN @ The Basement\n\n8/9 - Louisville, KY @ Whirling Tiger\n\n8/10 - Chicago, IL @ Sleeping Village\n\n8/11 - Davenport, IA @ Raccoon Motel\n\n8/12 - Milwaukee, WI @ Cactus Club\n\n8/13 - Minneapolis, MN @ Turf Club\n\n8/19 - Salt Lake City, UT @ Kilby Court\n\n8/20 - Boise, ID @ The Olympic Venue\n\n8/21 - Baker City, OR @ Churchill School\n\n8/22 - Seattle, WA @ The Sunset Tavern\n\n8/25 - San Francisco, CA @ Bottom of the Hill\n\n8/28 - Los Angeles, CA @ Moroccan Lounge\n\n8/29 - San Diego, CA @ Soda Bar\n\n8/30 - Phoenix, AZ @ Valley Bar\n\n9/1 - Dallas, TX @ Deep Vellum\n\n9/3 - Fayetteville, AR @ George’s Majestic Lounge\n\nArmock release new single \"Guardian\", new album out 7/12\n\nperforming at Pitchfork Music Festival London on November 10th\n\nArmlock, the up-and-coming Australian duo of Simon Lam and Hamish Mitchell, recently joined the Run For Cover Records roster and announced their new album, Seashell Angel Lucky Charm. Due out July 12th, the record is 18 minutes of immersive indie rock that's at once impressionistic and accessible, ambiguous yet refreshingly earnest. Today Armlock have shared another early taste of the record with their latest single, \"Guardian.\"\n\nLead single \"Ice Cold\" introduced the band's intricate sound (and garnered attention from the likes of Stereogum, The FADER, BrooklynVegan, and more), and now \"Guardian\" further envelopes the listener in Armlock's world. Like much of the band's music, the new single taps into Lam and Mitchell's roots in experimental electronic music and filters those influences through a homespun guitar music lens. \"Guardian\" draws you in close with crystal clear guitars, warm harmonies, and a sparse arrangement that leaves room for character and eccentricities.\n\nThe band discussed the new song, saying: \"'Guardian' is about the desire for guidance as an uncertain future appears closer, and looking around at life in the present for answers. The song describes desperately looking for a guiding grace through a general sense of spiritually, or at least a heightened awareness of higher frequencies.\"\n\nLongtime friends and collaborators, Lam (vocals and guitar) and Mitchell (guitar and keyboards) met studying jazz at Monash University in Melbourne, eventually discovering a shared love of electronic music. After a handful of electronic and dance outlets (I’lls, Couture, Kllo) Armlock came together and the two began incorporating guitar into the music they were making for the first time. Seashell Angel Lucky Charm is the imaginative and sonically rich result. The music at times recalls Pinback’s lean alternative, Alex G’s adventurous indie, or the wave of mysterious-yet-endearing genre-bending music coming out of the UK from label’s like Dean Blunt’s World Music or Vegyn’s PLZ Make It Ruins. Lam's vocals sit up front, often buoyed by spare guitar lines and a simple but steady beat, with ample space is left for production flourishes like distant laughter, chopped up samples, and pitched squeals to ping around the listener’s ears and leave you ready to hit repeat.\n\nArmlock will be performing at Pitchfork Music Festival London on November 10th, with more touring announcements to come.\n\nWatch Enumclaw's explosive video for \"Not Just Yet\"\n\nHome In Another Life is out 8/30\n\nToday, Tacoma, Washington’s-own Enumclaw shares new single “Not Just Yet.” The second offering from their forthcoming sophomore album Home in Another Life, out 8/30, “Not Just Yet” juxtaposes grandiose musicality with a tenderly written and distressed ode to band members Aramis Johnson & Eli Edwards’ Uncle Mike. Recently diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimers, Aramis clamors for more time with Uncle Mike, the man who “taught him everything” and shouts in disbelief over the top of thundering, arena-shaking drums from Ladaniel Gipson.\n\nAlongside the single, Enumclaw have teamed up with frequent collaborator and director John C. Peterson, who also directed the video for lead single “Change,” for another explosive music video centering on one long zoom out shot.\n\n“This video all started with a painting that Andrew Durgin-Barnes did for Rizzo and Quasi Skateboards,” director John C. Peterson says of the video. “Barnes’ painting screamed a story so I’d always wanted to adapt it to a one-take music video. Once I told Aramis my idea over a year ago, he was always adamant we had to do it. ‘Not Just Yet’ was the perfect song for it. Short and sweet. Loud. We did our best to bring the painting to life and I think we did it justice. It was extremely gratifying to have Barnes there on set and approve of what we were doing. We encountered a million problems in pre-production and the video almost fell through countless times… turns out doing a music video that requires a techno-crane, a city alley, explosives, and children is difficult to pull off.”\n\nCo-produced by Ben Zaidi and Enumclaw, Home in Another Life is the natural expansion of the high-octane rock foundation the band built with their widely-praised 2022 debut album Save The Baby. Across the eleven tracks of Home in Another Life, vocalist and principle songwriter Aramis Johnson cracks open his chest cavity for quakingly tender songs written and performed to electrify basement shows and reverberate through arenas in equal measure. Aramis and Enumclaw write and perform like a band wrestling with the weight of growing up without looking for pity or to wallow in that baggage, while harnessing the power of reckoning with those changes head-on and kicking the door down for bands just like them in a predominately white indie-rock space. Home In Another Life is louder, faster, poignant and achingly resonant, but doesn’t forget how to have fun and enjoy the moment too. Home in Another Life brings the world to Tacoma rather than the other way around.\n\nEnumclaw will also be joining twen on a run of dates this Summer across the US, beginning August 4th in Chattanooga, TN and spanning across the country before it concludes on September 3rd in Fayetteville, AR. In the time since the release of Save The Baby, Enumclaw has criss-crossed North America performing across the continent to serve fans in both major markets and small towns that are often overlooked on routed tour runs. Alongside the announcement of Home In Another Life, the band released a tour documentary recounting their first tour run overseas and expressing an appreciation for the long nights, early mornings and the full scope of life on tour, narrated by Aramis Johnson. Enumclaw is rounded out by guitarist Nathan Cornell, drummer Ladaniel Gipson, bassist (and Aramis’ younger brother) Eli Edwards.

There was a moment in the fall of 2020 when Great Grandpa - made of close-knit friends Al Menne, Dylan Hanwright, Cam LaFlam, and Pat and Carrie Goodwin - didn’t know if they would go on. They had just begun work on the follow-up to 2019’s immensely praised Four of Arrows when each member was called in different directions—to new countries, new jobs, new life stages. But as with any good relationship built on mutual love, trust, and a mountain of shared history, the quintet—who grew up in Seattle and have been making music together for a decade—were drawn back into one another’s orbits in 2023. “Time passed and I missed my friends,” Al puts it simply. After reconnecting, the band decided to scrap most of what they had previously recorded, but the exhilarating “Kid” remained as a true standout.\n\n“Kid” unfolds like a rock opera, moving deftly through a sea of melodies and scene changes. Pat and Carrie wrote the lyrics in the aftermath of the loss of their first pregnancy. “Things will happen when the timing is right,” Carrie reflects of that time, a sentiment that became the song’s glowing ember: “All good things in time define their meaning.”\n\nFrom the sparkling pop-grunge of their first record Plastic Cough (2017), to the sprawling indie rock of Four of Arrows, Great Grandpa has been on a clear trajectory of both refining and re-defining their sonic identity. “Kid” is the first taste of more Great Grandpa to come.\n\nHorse Jumper Of Love release new single/video for 'Today's Iconoclast\"\n\nNew album \"Disaster Trick\" out 8/16\n\nHorse Jumper of Love release “Today’s Iconoclast” latest from their anticipated new album Disaster Trick, due August 16th on Run For Cover Records. The disarmingly raw track imbued with wry humor comes with a video directed by Rhys Scarabosio.\n\n“I was watching a Pasolini film and read someone describe him as an iconoclast. I became obsessed with that word and idea. In order to make something good, you have to destroy a belief in some way. You can’t stay static, you have to accept change and be able to adjust,” Dimitri Giannopoulos explains. “I was thinking everyone should try to be as iconoclastic as they can because a lot of people end up being unhappy or unsatisfied. I think we all could be happier if we made an effort to destroy what we believe to be true about our own desires.”\n\nHorse Jumper of Love, who are currently on the road with DIIV and will be touring in support of Disaster Trick on a headline run in the fall, have also announced a EU and UK tour that kicks off in late October. All dates below.\n\nDisaster Trick finds the trio cranking up the volume while keeping the no-frills intimacy they’re known for. Frontman Dimitri Giannopoulos’ evocative lyrics and arrangements suddenly turn from delicate to blistering, their music is full of intensity, contrasting between quiet and loud, heavy and gentle, and animated by stark emotion and straightforward, timeless songwriting.\n\nDisaster Trick feels like a creative reset for the band, partly due to Giannopoulos’ recent sobriety. “This was the first album I've ever done where I went into it with a very clear mind,” he says. “In the past, we would just show up at a studio, drink, and record. Here, everything felt purposeful.” With this newfound energy, the band entered Asheville, North Carolina’s Drop of Sun Studios with producer Alex Farrar (Wednesday, Indigo De Souza). The recordings soar with searing guitars and an unshakeable rhythm section, comprised of bassist John Margaris and drummer James Doran. Additionally, the album features contributions from Wednesday’s Karly Hartzman, MJ Lenderman and Ella Williams of Squirrel Flower.\n\nTour Dates:\n\nJuly 16 - Howard Theatre - Washington DC ^\n\nJuly 17 - The National - Richmond, VA ^\n\nJuly 19 - The Music Farm - Charleston, SC ^\n\nJuly 20 - House of Blues - Orlando, FL ^\n\nJuly 21 - The Ground - Miami, FL ^\n\nJuly 23 - The Orpheum - Tampa, FL ^\n\nJuly 24 - Handlebar - Pensacola, FL\n\nJuly 25 - Buckhead Theatre - Atlanta, GA ^\n\nJuly 27 - Turner Hall - Milwaukee, WI ^\n\nJuly 28 - First Avenue - Minneapolis, MN ^\n\nJuly 30 - Thalia Hall - Chicago, IL ^\n\nJuly 31 - Majestic Theatre - Detroit, MI ^\n\nAug 1 - Meteor - Windsor, ON\n\nAug 2 - The Concert Hall - Toronto, ON ^\n\nAug 3 - La Sala Rossa - Montreal, QC\n\nAug 4 - Oxbow Blending & Bottling - Portland, ME\n\nAug 5 - Royale - Boston, MA ^\n\nAug 6 - Union Transfer - Philadelphia, PA ^\n\nAug 7 - Brooklyn Paramount - Brooklyn, NY ^\n\nAug 11 - No Fun - Troy, NY +\n\nAug 16 - Banquet Records - Kingston, UK ~\n\nAug 17 - Pie & Vinyl - Southsea, UK ~\n\nAug 18 - Rough Trade East - London, UK ~\n\nAug 19 - Rough Trade - Bristol, UK ~\n\nAug 20 - Rough Trade - Nottingham, UK ~\n\nAug 21 - Rough Trade - Liverpool, UK ~\n\nSept 14 - Mahall’s - Cleveland, OH ☆∆\n\nSept 19 - Polaris Hall - Portland, OR ☆&\n\nSept 20 - Fox Theater - Vancouver, BC ☆\n\nSept 21 - Barboza - Seattle, WA ☆&\n\nSept 23 - Holland Project - Reno, NV ☆*\n\nSept 24 - Rickshaw Stop - San Francisco, CA ☆\n\nSept 26 - Lodge Room - Los Angeles, CA ☆\n\nSept 27 - Soda Bar - San Diego, CA ☆*\n\nSept 28 - Valley Bar - Phoenix, AZ ☆*\n\nSept 30 - Rubber Gloves - Denton, TX ☆!\n\nOct 1 - Parish - Austin, TX ☆!\n\nOct 4 - Blue Room - Nashville, TN = #\n\nOct 5 - Ace of Cups - Columbus, OH = #\n\nOct 6 - Bottlerocket Social Hall - Pittsburgh, PA = #\n\nOct 23 - The Windmill - London, UK\n\nOct 26 - Clwb Ifor Bach - Cardiff, UK\n\nOct 28 - Brudenell Social Club - Leeds, UK\n\nOct 29 - Stereo - Glasgow, UK\n\nOct 30 - Cluny 2 - Newcastle, UK\n\nNov 1 - Tsunami Club - Cologne, DE\n\nNov 2 - LARK - Berlin, DE\n\nNov 4 - Rotown - Rotterdam, NL\n\nNov 6 - La Maroquinerie - Paris, FR\n\nNov 9 - Pitchfork Festival - London, UK\n\nNov 12 - Pod Minoga - Poznań, PL\n\nNov 13 - Voodoo - Warsaw, PL\n\n^ w/ DIIV\n\n+ w/ Babehoven\n\n~ Dimitri Giannopoulos solo\n\n☆ w/ Teethe\n\n∆ w/ villagerrr\n\n& w/ Guitar\n\n* w/ Sour Widows\n\n! w/ Shallowater\n\n= w/ Truth Club\n\n# w/ Joyer\n\nArmlock's \"Seashell Angel Lucky Charm\" out today\n\nUpcoming Shows w/ Cloud Nothings, Slow Pulp & Pitchfork London\n\n\"...there’s a deliberateness to everything you hear in Armlock’s music, a sense that it’s been pored over and ruthlessly curated.

An ear-quaking, catchy banger that rips through its 2:47 runtime, the song is accompanied by a video from director Travis Stevens (A Wounded Fawn, Jakob’s Wife, Girl On The Third Floor); it’s the second in the band’s series of horror-themed clips following lead single “Up and Away,” directed by Brea Grant (12 Hour Shift, Torn Hearts). “‘Botch Job’ is a rumination on what one has done with this life and those unfulfilling feelings that may accompany such thoughts. At this point, I don’t care to know what damage my body has incurred from years of abuse,” explains singer/guitarist Tim Kasher. “It’s those anxiety-fueled gremlins keeping you restless in the dead of night, but put to song.” Devourer, out September 13th, is now available for preorder.\n\nCursive, who will perform September 20th at Riot Fest, will embark on their fall U.S. run in support of Devourer on October 18th in hometown Omaha, NE.

The song describes desperately looking for a guiding grace through a general sense of spiritually, or at least a heightened awareness of higher frequencies.\"\n\nLongtime friends and collaborators, Lam (vocals and guitar) and Mitchell (guitar and keyboards) met studying jazz at Monash University in Melbourne, eventually discovering a shared love of electronic music. After a handful of electronic and dance outlets (I’lls, Couture, Kllo) Armlock came together and the two began incorporating guitar into the music they were making for the first time. Seashell Angel Lucky Charm is the imaginative and sonically rich result. The music at times recalls Pinback’s lean alternative, Alex G’s adventurous indie, or the wave of mysterious-yet-endearing genre-bending music coming out of the UK from label’s like Dean Blunt’s World Music or Vegyn’s PLZ Make It Ruins. Lam's vocals sit up front, often buoyed by spare guitar lines and a simple but steady beat, with ample space is left for production flourishes like distant laughter, chopped up samples, and pitched squeals to ping around the listener’s ears and leave you ready to hit repeat.\n\nArmlock will be performing at Pitchfork Music Festival London on November 10th, with more touring announcements to come.\n\nWatch Enumclaw's explosive video for \"Not Just Yet\"\n\nHome In Another Life is out 8/30\n\nToday, Tacoma, Washington’s-own Enumclaw shares new single “Not Just Yet.” The second offering from their forthcoming sophomore album Home in Another Life, out 8/30, “Not Just Yet” juxtaposes grandiose musicality with a tenderly written and distressed ode to band members Aramis Johnson & Eli Edwards’ Uncle Mike. Recently diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimers, Aramis clamors for more time with Uncle Mike, the man who “taught him everything” and shouts in disbelief over the top of thundering, arena-shaking drums from Ladaniel Gipson.\n\nAlongside the single, Enumclaw have teamed up with frequent collaborator and director John C. Peterson, who also directed the video for lead single “Change,” for another explosive music video centering on one long zoom out shot.\n\n“This video all started with a painting that Andrew Durgin-Barnes did for Rizzo and Quasi Skateboards,” director John C. Peterson says of the video. “Barnes’ painting screamed a story so I’d always wanted to adapt it to a one-take music video. Once I told Aramis my idea over a year ago, he was always adamant we had to do it. ‘Not Just Yet’ was the perfect song for it. Short and sweet. Loud. We did our best to bring the painting to life and I think we did it justice. It was extremely gratifying to have Barnes there on set and approve of what we were doing. We encountered a million problems in pre-production and the video almost fell through countless times… turns out doing a music video that requires a techno-crane, a city alley, explosives, and children is difficult to pull off.”\n\nCo-produced by Ben Zaidi and Enumclaw, Home in Another Life is the natural expansion of the high-octane rock foundation the band built with their widely-praised 2022 debut album Save The Baby. Across the eleven tracks of Home in Another Life, vocalist and principle songwriter Aramis Johnson cracks open his chest cavity for quakingly tender songs written and performed to electrify basement shows and reverberate through arenas in equal measure. Aramis and Enumclaw write and perform like a band wrestling with the weight of growing up without looking for pity or to wallow in that baggage, while harnessing the power of reckoning with those changes head-on and kicking the door down for bands just like them in a predominately white indie-rock space. Home In Another Life is louder, faster, poignant and achingly resonant, but doesn’t forget how to have fun and enjoy the moment too. Home in Another Life brings the world to Tacoma rather than the other way around.\n\nEnumclaw will also be joining twen on a run of dates this Summer across the US, beginning August 4th in Chattanooga, TN and spanning across the country before it concludes on September 3rd in Fayetteville, AR. In the time since the release of Save The Baby, Enumclaw has criss-crossed North America performing across the continent to serve fans in both major markets and small towns that are often overlooked on routed tour runs. Alongside the announcement of Home In Another Life, the band released a tour documentary recounting their first tour run overseas and expressing an appreciation for the long nights, early mornings and the full scope of life on tour, narrated by Aramis Johnson. Enumclaw is rounded out by guitarist Nathan Cornell, drummer Ladaniel Gipson, bassist (and Aramis’ younger brother) Eli Edwards.

There was a moment in the fall of 2020 when Great Grandpa - made of close-knit friends Al Menne, Dylan Hanwright, Cam LaFlam, and Pat and Carrie Goodwin - didn’t know if they would go on. They had just begun work on the follow-up to 2019’s immensely praised Four of Arrows when each member was called in different directions—to new countries, new jobs, new life stages. But as with any good relationship built on mutual love, trust, and a mountain of shared history, the quintet—who grew up in Seattle and have been making music together for a decade—were drawn back into one another’s orbits in 2023. “Time passed and I missed my friends,” Al puts it simply. After reconnecting, the band decided to scrap most of what they had previously recorded, but the exhilarating “Kid” remained as a true standout.\n\n“Kid” unfolds like a rock opera, moving deftly through a sea of melodies and scene changes. Pat and Carrie wrote the lyrics in the aftermath of the loss of their first pregnancy. “Things will happen when the timing is right,” Carrie reflects of that time, a sentiment that became the song’s glowing ember: “All good things in time define their meaning.”\n\nFrom the sparkling pop-grunge of their first record Plastic Cough (2017), to the sprawling indie rock of Four of Arrows, Great Grandpa has been on a clear trajectory of both refining and re-defining their sonic identity. “Kid” is the first taste of more Great Grandpa to come.\n\nHorse Jumper Of Love release new single/video for 'Today's Iconoclast\"\n\nNew album \"Disaster Trick\" out 8/16\n\nHorse Jumper of Love release “Today’s Iconoclast” latest from their anticipated new album Disaster Trick, due August 16th on Run For Cover Records. The disarmingly raw track imbued with wry humor comes with a video directed by Rhys Scarabosio.\n\n“I was watching a Pasolini film and read someone describe him as an iconoclast. I became obsessed with that word and idea. In order to make something good, you have to destroy a belief in some way. You can’t stay static, you have to accept change and be able to adjust,” Dimitri Giannopoulos explains. “I was thinking everyone should try to be as iconoclastic as they can because a lot of people end up being unhappy or unsatisfied. I think we all could be happier if we made an effort to destroy what we believe to be true about our own desires.”\n\nHorse Jumper of Love, who are currently on the road with DIIV and will be touring in support of Disaster Trick on a headline run in the fall, have also announced a EU and UK tour that kicks off in late October. All dates below.\n\nDisaster Trick finds the trio cranking up the volume while keeping the no-frills intimacy they’re known for. Frontman Dimitri Giannopoulos’ evocative lyrics and arrangements suddenly turn from delicate to blistering, their music is full of intensity, contrasting between quiet and loud, heavy and gentle, and animated by stark emotion and straightforward, timeless songwriting.\n\nDisaster Trick feels like a creative reset for the band, partly due to Giannopoulos’ recent sobriety. “This was the first album I've ever done where I went into it with a very clear mind,” he says. “In the past, we would just show up at a studio, drink, and record. Here, everything felt purposeful.” With this newfound energy, the band entered Asheville, North Carolina’s Drop of Sun Studios with producer Alex Farrar (Wednesday, Indigo De Souza). The recordings soar with searing guitars and an unshakeable rhythm section, comprised of bassist John Margaris and drummer James Doran. Additionally, the album features contributions from Wednesday’s Karly Hartzman, MJ Lenderman and Ella Williams of Squirrel Flower.\n\nTour Dates:\n\nJuly 16 - Howard Theatre - Washington DC ^\n\nJuly 17 - The National - Richmond, VA ^\n\nJuly 19 - The Music Farm - Charleston, SC ^\n\nJuly 20 - House of Blues - Orlando, FL ^\n\nJuly 21 - The Ground - Miami, FL ^\n\nJuly 23 - The Orpheum - Tampa, FL ^\n\nJuly 24 - Handlebar - Pensacola, FL\n\nJuly 25 - Buckhead Theatre - Atlanta, GA ^\n\nJuly 27 - Turner Hall - Milwaukee, WI ^\n\nJuly 28 - First Avenue - Minneapolis, MN ^\n\nJuly 30 - Thalia Hall - Chicago, IL ^\n\nJuly 31 - Majestic Theatre - Detroit, MI ^\n\nAug 1 - Meteor - Windsor, ON\n\nAug 2 - The Concert Hall - Toronto, ON ^\n\nAug 3 - La Sala Rossa - Montreal, QC\n\nAug 4 - Oxbow Blending & Bottling - Portland, ME\n\nAug 5 - Royale - Boston, MA ^\n\nAug 6 - Union Transfer - Philadelphia, PA ^\n\nAug 7 - Brooklyn Paramount - Brooklyn, NY ^\n\nAug 11 - No Fun - Troy, NY +\n\nAug 16 - Banquet Records - Kingston, UK ~\n\nAug 17 - Pie & Vinyl - Southsea, UK ~\n\nAug 18 - Rough Trade East - London, UK ~\n\nAug 19 - Rough Trade - Bristol, UK ~\n\nAug 20 - Rough Trade - Nottingham, UK ~\n\nAug 21 - Rough Trade - Liverpool, UK ~\n\nSept 14 - Mahall’s - Cleveland, OH ☆∆\n\nSept 19 - Polaris Hall - Portland, OR ☆&\n\nSept 20 - Fox Theater - Vancouver, BC ☆\n\nSept 21 - Barboza - Seattle, WA ☆&\n\nSept 23 - Holland Project - Reno, NV ☆*\n\nSept 24 - Rickshaw Stop - San Francisco, CA ☆\n\nSept 26 - Lodge Room - Los Angeles, CA ☆\n\nSept 27 - Soda Bar - San Diego, CA ☆*\n\nSept 28 - Valley Bar - Phoenix, AZ ☆*\n\nSept 30 - Rubber Gloves - Denton, TX ☆!\n\nOct 1 - Parish - Austin, TX ☆!\n\nOct 4 - Blue Room - Nashville, TN = #\n\nOct 5 - Ace of Cups - Columbus, OH = #\n\nOct 6 - Bottlerocket Social Hall - Pittsburgh, PA = #\n\nOct 23 - The Windmill - London, UK\n\nOct 26 - Clwb Ifor Bach - Cardiff, UK\n\nOct 28 - Brudenell Social Club - Leeds, UK\n\nOct 29 - Stereo - Glasgow, UK\n\nOct 30 - Cluny 2 - Newcastle, UK\n\nNov 1 - Tsunami Club - Cologne, DE\n\nNov 2 - LARK - Berlin, DE\n\nNov 4 - Rotown - Rotterdam, NL\n\nNov 6 - La Maroquinerie - Paris, FR\n\nNov 9 - Pitchfork Festival - London, UK\n\nNov 12 - Pod Minoga - Poznań, PL\n\nNov 13 - Voodoo - Warsaw, PL\n\n^ w/ DIIV\n\n+ w/ Babehoven\n\n~ Dimitri Giannopoulos solo\n\n☆ w/ Teethe\n\n∆ w/ villagerrr\n\n& w/ Guitar\n\n* w/ Sour Widows\n\n! w/ Shallowater\n\n= w/ Truth Club\n\n# w/ Joyer\n\nArmlock's \"Seashell Angel Lucky Charm\" out today\n\nUpcoming Shows w/ Cloud Nothings, Slow Pulp & Pitchfork London\n\n\"...there’s a deliberateness to everything you hear in Armlock’s music, a sense that it’s been pored over and ruthlessly curated.

Clocking in at just 18 minutes, Seashell Angel Lucky Charm provides instantly immersive indie rock that's at once impressionistic and accessible, ambiguous yet refreshingly earnest.\n\nEarly singles \"Fear,\" \"Ice Cold,\" and \"Guardian\" introduced Armlock's intricate sound and garnered attention from the likes of Stereogum, The FADER, BrooklynVegan, FLOOD Magazine, Paste Magazine, Bandcamp Daily, and more), and today listeners can hear Seashell Angel Lucky Charm in full. Now's the time to get on board as the band are shaping up for a big 2024, including their first ever US shows, tour dates with Cloud Nothings and Slow Pulp, performing at Pitchfork Music Festival London, and more (see full tour itinerary below).\n\nLongtime friends and collaborators, Lam (vocals and guitar) and Mitchell (guitar and keyboards) met studying jazz at Monash University in Melbourne, eventually discovering a shared love of electronic music. After a handful of electronic and dance-oriented projects (I’lls, Couture, Kllo) Armlock came together and the two began incorporating guitar into the music they were making for the first time. Seashell Angel Lucky Charm is the imaginative and sonically rich result. The music at times recalls Pinback’s lean alternative, Alex G’s adventurous indie, or the wave of mysterious-yet-endearing genre-bending music coming out of the UK from label’s like Dean Blunt’s World Music or Vegyn’s PLZ Make It Ruins. Lam's vocals sit up front, often buoyed by spare guitar lines and a simple but steady beat, with ample space is left for production flourishes like distant laughter, chopped up samples, and pitched squeals to ping around the listener’s ears and leave you ready to hit repeat.\n\nCursive share new single & video for \"Botch Job\"\n\nNew album Devourer out 9/13\n\nToday Cursive have shared their new single “Botch Job,” the propulsive opener of their forthcoming album, Devourer. An ear-quaking, catchy banger that rips through its 2:47 runtime, the song is accompanied by a video from director Travis Stevens (A Wounded Fawn, Jakob’s Wife, Girl On The Third Floor); it’s the second in the band’s series of horror-themed clips following lead single “Up and Away,” directed by Brea Grant (12 Hour Shift, Torn Hearts). “‘Botch Job’ is a rumination on what one has done with this life and those unfulfilling feelings that may accompany such thoughts. At this point, I don’t care to know what damage my body has incurred from years of abuse,” explains singer/guitarist Tim Kasher. “It’s those anxiety-fueled gremlins keeping you restless in the dead of night, but put to song.” Devourer, out September 13th, is now available for preorder.\n\nCursive, who will perform September 20th at Riot Fest, will embark on their fall U.S. run in support of Devourer on October 18th in hometown Omaha, NE. A current itinerary is below.\n\nArmlock Premiere New Single/Video \"Fear\"\n\nSeashell Angel Lucky Charm Out 7/12\n\nArmlock, the up-and-coming Australian duo of Simon Lam and Hamish Mitchell, are gearing up to release their new album, Seashell Angel Lucky Charm, this Friday, July 12th, on Run For Cover Records. Today they've teamed with FLOOD Magazine to premiere one more early single, \"Fear.\"\n\nClocking in at just 18 minutes, Seashell Angel Lucky Charm provides instantly immersive indie rock that's at once impressionistic and accessible, ambiguous yet refreshingly earnest. The album's earlier singles \"Ice Cold\" and \"Guardian\" introduced the world to Armlock's intricate sound (and garnered attention from the likes of Stereogum, The FADER, BrooklynVegan, and more), and \"Fear\" just might be their catchiest offering yet. FLOOD praised the track and its accompanying music video, calling it \"a gentler take on slowcore convention that shares more in common musically with their peers Hovvdy and Alex G.\"\n\nLongtime friends and collaborators, Lam (vocals and guitar) and Mitchell (guitar and keyboards) met studying jazz at Monash University in Melbourne, eventually discovering a shared love of electronic music.

Each member of Modern Baseball also contributed notes to provide context to the countless photos taken while touring, recording, skateboarding, napping, swimming and a whole lot more.\n\nThis deluxe edition also includes two never-before released demos of \"Rock Bottom\" and \"Pothole\" pressed on an exclusive 7\". These early, intimate versions show how the ideas behind these two favorite tracks progressed into the final takes that made it onto You're Gonna Miss It All.\n\nModern Baseball was formed in 2011 by friends and guitarists Jacob Ewald and Brendan Lukens, who were soon joined by Ian Farmer on bass and Sean Huber on drums.The band self-released their first EP The Nameless Ranger in 2011 while still in high school.

Celebrating the signing and the announcement of their new album, Enumclaw shares new single “Change.” The song is the first taste of what fans can expect from Home In Another Life, paired with a heartwarming video directed by frequent collaborator John C. Peterson.\n\nCo-produced by Ben Zaidi and Enumclaw, Home in Another Life is the natural expansion of the high-octane rock foundation the band built with their widely-praised 2022 debut album Save The Baby. Across the eleven tracks of Home in Another Life, vocalist and principle songwriter Aramis Johnson opens his chest cavity for louder, resolute songs written to pour out of basement shows and reverberate through stadiums in equal measure. With uncomplicated songwriting that crystallizes distinct feelings – ashing cigarettes on the kitchen counter to incite a reaction or finding truth at the bottom of a beer can – anthemic guitar riffs, and an electric energy, Aramis and the band have made their most resonant body of work to-date. Home in Another Life brings the world to Tacoma rather than the other way around. Enumclaw is rounded out by guitarist Nathan Cornell, drummer Ladaniel Gipson, bassist (and Aramis’ younger brother) Eli Edwards.\n\nEnumclaw will also be joining twen on a run of dates this Summer across the US, beginning August 4th in Chattanooga, TN and spanning across the country before it concludes on September 3rd in Fayetteville, AR.\n\n8/4 - Chattanooga, TN @ Cherry Street Tavern\n\n8/5 - Birmingham, AL @ Saturn\n\n8/7 - Lexington, KY @ The Burl\n\n8/8 - Nashville, TN @ The Basement\n\n8/9 - Louisville, KY @ Whirling Tiger\n\n8/10 - Chicago, IL @ Sleeping Village\n\n8/11 - Davenport, IA @ Raccoon Motel\n\n8/12 - Milwaukee, WI @ Cactus Club\n\n8/13 - Minneapolis, MN @ Turf Club\n\n8/19 - Salt Lake City, UT @ Kilby Court\n\n8/20 - Boise, ID @ The Olympic Venue\n\n8/21 - Baker City, OR @ Churchill School\n\n8/22 - Seattle, WA @ The Sunset Tavern\n\n8/25 - San Francisco, CA @ Bottom of the Hill\n\n8/28 - Los Angeles, CA @ Moroccan Lounge\n\n8/29 - San Diego, CA @ Soda Bar\n\n8/30 - Phoenix, AZ @ Valley Bar\n\n9/1 - Dallas, TX @ Deep Vellum\n\n9/3 - Fayetteville, AR @ George’s Majestic Lounge\n\nArmock release new single \"Guardian\", new album out 7/12\n\nperforming at Pitchfork Music Festival London on November 10th\n\nArmlock, the up-and-coming Australian duo of Simon Lam and Hamish Mitchell, recently joined the Run For Cover Records roster and announced their new album, Seashell Angel Lucky Charm.

You can’t stay static, you have to accept change and be able to adjust,” Dimitri Giannopoulos explains. “I was thinking everyone should try to be as iconoclastic as they can because a lot of people end up being unhappy or unsatisfied. I think we all could be happier if we made an effort to destroy what we believe to be true about our own desires.”\n\nHorse Jumper of Love, who are currently on the road with DIIV and will be touring in support of Disaster Trick on a headline run in the fall, have also announced a EU and UK tour that kicks off in late October. All dates below.\n\nDisaster Trick finds the trio cranking up the volume while keeping the no-frills intimacy they’re known for. Frontman Dimitri Giannopoulos’ evocative lyrics and arrangements suddenly turn from delicate to blistering, their music is full of intensity, contrasting between quiet and loud, heavy and gentle, and animated by stark emotion and straightforward, timeless songwriting.\n\nDisaster Trick feels like a creative reset for the band, partly due to Giannopoulos’ recent sobriety. “This was the first album I've ever done where I went into it with a very clear mind,” he says. “In the past, we would just show up at a studio, drink, and record. Here, everything felt purposeful.” With this newfound energy, the band entered Asheville, North Carolina’s Drop of Sun Studios with producer Alex Farrar (Wednesday, Indigo De Souza). The recordings soar with searing guitars and an unshakeable rhythm section, comprised of bassist John Margaris and drummer James Doran. Additionally, the album features contributions from Wednesday’s Karly Hartzman, MJ Lenderman and Ella Williams of Squirrel Flower.\n\nTour Dates:\n\nJuly 16 - Howard Theatre - Washington DC ^\n\nJuly 17 - The National - Richmond, VA ^\n\nJuly 19 - The Music Farm - Charleston, SC ^\n\nJuly 20 - House of Blues - Orlando, FL ^\n\nJuly 21 - The Ground - Miami, FL ^\n\nJuly 23 - The Orpheum - Tampa, FL ^\n\nJuly 24 - Handlebar - Pensacola, FL\n\nJuly 25 - Buckhead Theatre - Atlanta, GA ^\n\nJuly 27 - Turner Hall - Milwaukee, WI ^\n\nJuly 28 - First Avenue - Minneapolis, MN ^\n\nJuly 30 - Thalia Hall - Chicago, IL ^\n\nJuly 31 - Majestic Theatre - Detroit, MI ^\n\nAug 1 - Meteor - Windsor, ON\n\nAug 2 - The Concert Hall - Toronto, ON ^\n\nAug 3 - La Sala Rossa - Montreal, QC\n\nAug 4 - Oxbow Blending & Bottling - Portland, ME\n\nAug 5 - Royale - Boston, MA ^\n\nAug 6 - Union Transfer - Philadelphia, PA ^\n\nAug 7 - Brooklyn Paramount - Brooklyn, NY ^\n\nAug 11 - No Fun - Troy, NY +\n\nAug 16 - Banquet Records - Kingston, UK ~\n\nAug 17 - Pie & Vinyl - Southsea, UK ~\n\nAug 18 - Rough Trade East - London, UK ~\n\nAug 19 - Rough Trade - Bristol, UK ~\n\nAug 20 - Rough Trade - Nottingham, UK ~\n\nAug 21 - Rough Trade - Liverpool, UK ~\n\nSept 14 - Mahall’s - Cleveland, OH ☆∆\n\nSept 19 - Polaris Hall - Portland, OR ☆&\n\nSept 20 - Fox Theater - Vancouver, BC ☆\n\nSept 21 - Barboza - Seattle, WA ☆&\n\nSept 23 - Holland Project - Reno, NV ☆*\n\nSept 24 - Rickshaw Stop - San Francisco, CA ☆\n\nSept 26 - Lodge Room - Los Angeles, CA ☆\n\nSept 27 - Soda Bar - San Diego, CA ☆*\n\nSept 28 - Valley Bar - Phoenix, AZ ☆*\n\nSept 30 - Rubber Gloves - Denton, TX ☆!\n\nOct 1 - Parish - Austin, TX ☆!\n\nOct 4 - Blue Room - Nashville, TN = #\n\nOct 5 - Ace of Cups - Columbus, OH = #\n\nOct 6 - Bottlerocket Social Hall - Pittsburgh, PA = #\n\nOct 23 - The Windmill - London, UK\n\nOct 26 - Clwb Ifor Bach - Cardiff, UK\n\nOct 28 - Brudenell Social Club - Leeds, UK\n\nOct 29 - Stereo - Glasgow, UK\n\nOct 30 - Cluny 2 - Newcastle, UK\n\nNov 1 - Tsunami Club - Cologne, DE\n\nNov 2 - LARK - Berlin, DE\n\nNov 4 - Rotown - Rotterdam, NL\n\nNov 6 - La Maroquinerie - Paris, FR\n\nNov 9 - Pitchfork Festival - London, UK\n\nNov 12 - Pod Minoga - Poznań, PL\n\nNov 13 - Voodoo - Warsaw, PL\n\n^ w/ DIIV\n\n+ w/ Babehoven\n\n~ Dimitri Giannopoulos solo\n\n☆ w/ Teethe\n\n∆ w/ villagerrr\n\n& w/ Guitar\n\n* w/ Sour Widows\n\n! w/ Shallowater\n\n= w/ Truth Club\n\n# w/ Joyer\n\nArmlock's \"Seashell Angel Lucky Charm\" out today\n\nUpcoming Shows w/ Cloud Nothings, Slow Pulp & Pitchfork London\n\n\"...there’s a deliberateness to everything you hear in Armlock’s music, a sense that it’s been pored over and ruthlessly curated.

Clocking in at just 18 minutes, Seashell Angel Lucky Charm provides instantly immersive indie rock that's at once impressionistic and accessible, ambiguous yet refreshingly earnest.\n\nEarly singles \"Fear,\" \"Ice Cold,\" and \"Guardian\" introduced Armlock's intricate sound and garnered attention from the likes of Stereogum, The FADER, BrooklynVegan, FLOOD Magazine, Paste Magazine, Bandcamp Daily, and more), and today listeners can hear Seashell Angel Lucky Charm in full. Now's the time to get on board as the band are shaping up for a big 2024, including their first ever US shows, tour dates with Cloud Nothings and Slow Pulp, performing at Pitchfork Music Festival London, and more (see full tour itinerary below).\n\nLongtime friends and collaborators, Lam (vocals and guitar) and Mitchell (guitar and keyboards) met studying jazz at Monash University in Melbourne, eventually discovering a shared love of electronic music. After a handful of electronic and dance-oriented projects (I’lls, Couture, Kllo) Armlock came together and the two began incorporating guitar into the music they were making for the first time. Seashell Angel Lucky Charm is the imaginative and sonically rich result. The music at times recalls Pinback’s lean alternative, Alex G’s adventurous indie, or the wave of mysterious-yet-endearing genre-bending music coming out of the UK from label’s like Dean Blunt’s World Music or Vegyn’s PLZ Make It Ruins. Lam's vocals sit up front, often buoyed by spare guitar lines and a simple but steady beat, with ample space is left for production flourishes like distant laughter, chopped up samples, and pitched squeals to ping around the listener’s ears and leave you ready to hit repeat.\n\nCursive share new single & video for \"Botch Job\"\n\nNew album Devourer out 9/13\n\nToday Cursive have shared their new single “Botch Job,” the propulsive opener of their forthcoming album, Devourer. An ear-quaking, catchy banger that rips through its 2:47 runtime, the song is accompanied by a video from director Travis Stevens (A Wounded Fawn, Jakob’s Wife, Girl On The Third Floor); it’s the second in the band’s series of horror-themed clips following lead single “Up and Away,” directed by Brea Grant (12 Hour Shift, Torn Hearts). “‘Botch Job’ is a rumination on what one has done with this life and those unfulfilling feelings that may accompany such thoughts. At this point, I don’t care to know what damage my body has incurred from years of abuse,” explains singer/guitarist Tim Kasher. “It’s those anxiety-fueled gremlins keeping you restless in the dead of night, but put to song.” Devourer, out September 13th, is now available for preorder.\n\nCursive, who will perform September 20th at Riot Fest, will embark on their fall U.S. run in support of Devourer on October 18th in hometown Omaha, NE.

Today they've teamed with FLOOD Magazine to premiere one more early single, \"Fear.\"\n\nClocking in at just 18 minutes, Seashell Angel Lucky Charm provides instantly immersive indie rock that's at once impressionistic and accessible, ambiguous yet refreshingly earnest. The album's earlier singles \"Ice Cold\" and \"Guardian\" introduced the world to Armlock's intricate sound (and garnered attention from the likes of Stereogum, The FADER, BrooklynVegan, and more), and \"Fear\" just might be their catchiest offering yet. FLOOD praised the track and its accompanying music video, calling it \"a gentler take on slowcore convention that shares more in common musically with their peers Hovvdy and Alex G.\"\n\nLongtime friends and collaborators, Lam (vocals and guitar) and Mitchell (guitar and keyboards) met studying jazz at Monash University in Melbourne, eventually discovering a shared love of electronic music.

This version of the band's second album is a collector's delight - an LP and 7\" enclosed in a heavyweight, hardcover 12\" x 12\" book with 96 pages of photos from longtime collaborator Jess Flynn. Each member of Modern Baseball also contributed notes to provide context to the countless photos taken while touring, recording, skateboarding, napping, swimming and a whole lot more.\n\nThis deluxe edition also includes two never-before released demos of \"Rock Bottom\" and \"Pothole\" pressed on an exclusive 7\". These early, intimate versions show how the ideas behind these two favorite tracks progressed into the final takes that made it onto You're Gonna Miss It All.\n\nModern Baseball was formed in 2011 by friends and guitarists Jacob Ewald and Brendan Lukens, who were soon joined by Ian Farmer on bass and Sean Huber on drums.The band self-released their first EP The Nameless Ranger in 2011 while still in high school. Shortly after the members relocated to Philadelphia to attend college and quickly gained a strong following in the Philadelphia music community, teaming up with locals Marietta to release the Couples Therapy split in the spring of 2012. Modern Baseball released their debut full-length Sports later that year on Lame-O Records, which they self-recorded and produced. After spending the summer of 2013 touring heavily across the US, the band headed into Studio A in Philadelphia to self-record You're Going to Miss It All. Mixed by Jonathan Low at Minor Street Recordings and mastered by Will Yip, You're Going to Miss It All features 12 tracks that showcase the band's signature witty indie-pop.\n\nEnumclaw joins RFC, \"Home In Another Life\" out 8/30\n\nAugust US tour with Twen\n\nTacoma, Washington’s-own Enumclaw announces their sophomore album Home in Another Life, out August 30th on RFC. Celebrating the signing and the announcement of their new album, Enumclaw shares new single “Change.” The song is the first taste of what fans can expect from Home In Another Life, paired with a heartwarming video directed by frequent collaborator John C. Peterson.\n\nCo-produced by Ben Zaidi and Enumclaw, Home in Another Life is the natural expansion of the high-octane rock foundation the band built with their widely-praised 2022 debut album Save The Baby. Across the eleven tracks of Home in Another Life, vocalist and principle songwriter Aramis Johnson opens his chest cavity for louder, resolute songs written to pour out of basement shows and reverberate through stadiums in equal measure. With uncomplicated songwriting that crystallizes distinct feelings – ashing cigarettes on the kitchen counter to incite a reaction or finding truth at the bottom of a beer can – anthemic guitar riffs, and an electric energy, Aramis and the band have made their most resonant body of work to-date. Home in Another Life brings the world to Tacoma rather than the other way around. Enumclaw is rounded out by guitarist Nathan Cornell, drummer Ladaniel Gipson, bassist (and Aramis’ younger brother) Eli Edwards.\n\nEnumclaw will also be joining twen on a run of dates this Summer across the US, beginning August 4th in Chattanooga, TN and spanning across the country before it concludes on September 3rd in Fayetteville, AR.\n\n8/4 - Chattanooga, TN @ Cherry Street Tavern\n\n8/5 - Birmingham, AL @ Saturn\n\n8/7 - Lexington, KY @ The Burl\n\n8/8 - Nashville, TN @ The Basement\n\n8/9 - Louisville, KY @ Whirling Tiger\n\n8/10 - Chicago, IL @ Sleeping Village\n\n8/11 - Davenport, IA @ Raccoon Motel\n\n8/12 - Milwaukee, WI @ Cactus Club\n\n8/13 - Minneapolis, MN @ Turf Club\n\n8/19 - Salt Lake City, UT @ Kilby Court\n\n8/20 - Boise, ID @ The Olympic Venue\n\n8/21 - Baker City, OR @ Churchill School\n\n8/22 - Seattle, WA @ The Sunset Tavern\n\n8/25 - San Francisco, CA @ Bottom of the Hill\n\n8/28 - Los Angeles, CA @ Moroccan Lounge\n\n8/29 - San Diego, CA @ Soda Bar\n\n8/30 - Phoenix, AZ @ Valley Bar\n\n9/1 - Dallas, TX @ Deep Vellum\n\n9/3 - Fayetteville, AR @ George’s Majestic Lounge\n\nArmock release new single \"Guardian\", new album out 7/12\n\nperforming at Pitchfork Music Festival London on November 10th\n\nArmlock, the up-and-coming Australian duo of Simon Lam and Hamish Mitchell, recently joined the Run For Cover Records roster and announced their new album, Seashell Angel Lucky Charm. Due out July 12th, the record is 18 minutes of immersive indie rock that's at once impressionistic and accessible, ambiguous yet refreshingly earnest. Today Armlock have shared another early taste of the record with their latest single, \"Guardian.\"\n\nLead single \"Ice Cold\" introduced the band's intricate sound (and garnered attention from the likes of Stereogum, The FADER, BrooklynVegan, and more), and now \"Guardian\" further envelopes the listener in Armlock's world. Like much of the band's music, the new single taps into Lam and Mitchell's roots in experimental electronic music and filters those influences through a homespun guitar music lens. \"Guardian\" draws you in close with crystal clear guitars, warm harmonies, and a sparse arrangement that leaves room for character and eccentricities.\n\nThe band discussed the new song, saying: \"'Guardian' is about the desire for guidance as an uncertain future appears closer, and looking around at life in the present for answers. The song describes desperately looking for a guiding grace through a general sense of spiritually, or at least a heightened awareness of higher frequencies.\"\n\nLongtime friends and collaborators, Lam (vocals and guitar) and Mitchell (guitar and keyboards) met studying jazz at Monash University in Melbourne, eventually discovering a shared love of electronic music. After a handful of electronic and dance outlets (I’lls, Couture, Kllo) Armlock came together and the two began incorporating guitar into the music they were making for the first time. Seashell Angel Lucky Charm is the imaginative and sonically rich result. The music at times recalls Pinback’s lean alternative, Alex G’s adventurous indie, or the wave of mysterious-yet-endearing genre-bending music coming out of the UK from label’s like Dean Blunt’s World Music or Vegyn’s PLZ Make It Ruins. Lam's vocals sit up front, often buoyed by spare guitar lines and a simple but steady beat, with ample space is left for production flourishes like distant laughter, chopped up samples, and pitched squeals to ping around the listener’s ears and leave you ready to hit repeat.\n\nArmlock will be performing at Pitchfork Music Festival London on November 10th, with more touring announcements to come.\n\nWatch Enumclaw's explosive video for \"Not Just Yet\"\n\nHome In Another Life is out 8/30\n\nToday, Tacoma, Washington’s-own Enumclaw shares new single “Not Just Yet.” The second offering from their forthcoming sophomore album Home in Another Life, out 8/30, “Not Just Yet” juxtaposes grandiose musicality with a tenderly written and distressed ode to band members Aramis Johnson & Eli Edwards’ Uncle Mike. Recently diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimers, Aramis clamors for more time with Uncle Mike, the man who “taught him everything” and shouts in disbelief over the top of thundering, arena-shaking drums from Ladaniel Gipson.\n\nAlongside the single, Enumclaw have teamed up with frequent collaborator and director John C. Peterson, who also directed the video for lead single “Change,” for another explosive music video centering on one long zoom out shot.\n\n“This video all started with a painting that Andrew Durgin-Barnes did for Rizzo and Quasi Skateboards,” director John C. Peterson says of the video. “Barnes’ painting screamed a story so I’d always wanted to adapt it to a one-take music video. Once I told Aramis my idea over a year ago, he was always adamant we had to do it. ‘Not Just Yet’ was the perfect song for it. Short and sweet. Loud. We did our best to bring the painting to life and I think we did it justice. It was extremely gratifying to have Barnes there on set and approve of what we were doing. We encountered a million problems in pre-production and the video almost fell through countless times… turns out doing a music video that requires a techno-crane, a city alley, explosives, and children is difficult to pull off.”\n\nCo-produced by Ben Zaidi and Enumclaw, Home in Another Life is the natural expansion of the high-octane rock foundation the band built with their widely-praised 2022 debut album Save The Baby. Across the eleven tracks of Home in Another Life, vocalist and principle songwriter Aramis Johnson cracks open his chest cavity for quakingly tender songs written and performed to electrify basement shows and reverberate through arenas in equal measure. Aramis and Enumclaw write and perform like a band wrestling with the weight o"
