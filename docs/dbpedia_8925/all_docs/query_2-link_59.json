        "text": "12 Frontrunner\n\nI remember a girl named Sylvia but can't remember her last name. She had the biggest crush on a boy and I think his name was Eddie Bill. She was so pretty but afraid to ever let Eddie Bill know how she felt. That was the big drama back then, who had a crush on who. Looking back, wasn't life so simple ?\n\n13 I Remember\n\nThat girl was Sylvia Hamm and she did have a crush on Eddie Bill Ping ---I hadn't thought about Eddie Bill in years. Life was indeed simple. I used to say my mom I can't wait to grow up and she would always say \"Don't wish your life away.\" I wish now I could go back to those simple times.\n\n14 Gosh\n\nI had forgotten about Ms. Greenly. She was the Librarian. Times were bad at my house, too. We didn't have an inside bathroom until I was 10 years old. Heck, I don't know any one of us who had a whole lot. I know I owned two pair of shoes, one for school and one for church. There were no sneakers for girls back then, either. I'm glad life has been good to you and I hope it stays that way.\n\n15 Frontrunner\n\nDidn't Eddie Bill play ball for Ferguson. Charlie and Larry Tucker played, too, didn't they?\n\n16 Wish\n\nEddie Bill and Charlie played but I don't remember a Larry. Do you remember Malcolm Luttrell? He was about 6 ft. 7 inches tall.\n\n17 Memories Thanks for all the memories. I was there until the 8th grade, then went to Pulaski County. Ah, those Ferguson Warhorses. Wasn't nothing like them. Ms. Corder, Ms. Hamilton, and Ms. Bolton, those were the good teachers. We didn't have much, but I am very thankful for what I had and for my family. 18 Somerset\n\nI played basketball for a while for Ferguson but not long enough. I remember trying to guard Galen Jasper, who played for Pulaski), and he was good and quick as lightning. Oh, for the good old days and thanks, as I have had a pretty good life but now am starting to deteriorate. LOL. Oh, well, we all are not quite as young as we once were. God Bless.\n\n19 To Know\n\nNope. You're right. We're not young anymore, but our memories will always be young, and in them we will always be young. That was the best time of my life. I was just too dumb to know it. Remember Mr. Higgins. He sounded just like a frog when he talked. Remember the Fall Festivals in the gym ?\n\n20 Crossroads\n\nI remember the Fall Festivals, all the games, and the baked goods and candy you could buy while you were there. We would decorate the gym for days before the Big Event. I don't know if kids today would have fun at something like that. It was so simple. But it was sooo fun.\n\n21 To Know\n\nI remember the haunted house that was upstairs in the gym. I remember one year they used a calf liver and put it on the person's head who was in the wood coffin they made. If I remember right the guy in the coffin was Bobby Cundiff. The kids were terrified. Such silly fun. Do you remember they always had a queen and king and we would put jars with our pictures on it all over town and people would drop pennies in them. I doubt schools do such things any more. One thing about it --- there was never any trouble, no drugs, no alcohol, no guns. It was just good old fashioned fun. And I only remember one girl ever getting pregnant.\n\n22 RememberWhen I had class with Judy, Charlotte and Carolyn. One would start to laugh about something and then they all 3 would start to laugh. I can remember Carolyn was always the one who would say something and Charlotte would start laughing. Judy always tried so hard to be the good one of the 3, but it never worked out. She would get called down, too. They were separated a lot. They were so fun, all 3 of them. 23 Memories Do you remember they would have the crowning of the king and queen and prince and princess during the Fall Festival? My mom would work for days, sewing endlessly, on my little dress to wear. Lord Have Mercy, girls today would not wear a homemade dress. Come to think of it, I never had a storebought dress. I can almost remember the smell of that old gym during Fall Festival. It was just so much fun. Recess in the front yard where everyone played softball was fun, too. If you weren't good it didn't much matter, because you could get someone to bat for you on your third strike, and if they got a hit you still got to run. Does anybody remember the auditorium and the plays, talent contests, speeches, etc., they put on? 24 I Remember I remember all this. Does anyone remember skipping rope on the walk in back of the school? School lunch was a quarter. Remember the home ec teacher named Glenda Flanagan? She married Johnny Waters and then died not long after. The Fall Festival was the best. My mom was a member of the PTA and she used to bake for days for the festival. I also remember pie suppers and chili suppers. What has happened to all the good times in school these days? It makes me lonely to remember all those bygone days. How I wish I could go back for just one more Fall Festival. 25 I Remember\n\nMr. Garner was my 7th grade homeroom teacher. Homeroom was downstairs by the boys bath room and the boiler room. Mr. Garner used to stand out by the home room door and smoke. We all loved him\n\n26 Knowitall\n\nCorrect spelling of the breaker thief's name was Gallagher. I don't recall that incident, BUT he and Raymond Farmer (now deceased) used to pee on the old steam radiators in the class rooms. John and Darrell Marcum broke into the school one weekend and stole all the paddles in the entire building. On Monday morning Coach David Cowan had to drive to Marcum's house to get a paddle so Howard Moore could use it on them.\n\n27 Wondering\n\nJust wondering if anybody knows where I could get a copy of any of the old high school yearbooks? My mom had several friends who went to Ferguson and she said she would enjoy looking at some of the old photos. Especially in 1958-62. I checked at the library in the historical society and they didn't have any Ferguson ones, just a bunch from Somerset and Eubank. But they said they would appreciate copies if anybody had any to donate.\n\n28 Funny\n\nJohn Gallagher was a trip. John was infamous for putting gum on the seat of Mr. Young's chair. So funny. David Cowan was a great coach and man. It was sad for many people the day he died. It is great to relive these memories. Such good days.\n\n29 Knowitall\n\nI have so many memories of Ferguson and the school and I could start telling all of them on here because we do not have to identify ourselves. Someone asked about a dark haired girl named Diane Ennis. I just about recall everyone, either by name, car, job or their participation in some activity, sometimes unmentionable. I personally remember Howard Moore and actually saw Mrs. Greenley sitting on his lap. He drove the school's 1960 Ford station wagon and she drove a '59 four door Pontiac Catalina.\n\n30 Back in Time\n\nI went to Ferguson from first grade through 12th grade and honestly never heard of anything bad happening. Of course my memory is going. The name Diane Ennis is familiar but I'll have to call a friend and ask her.\n\n31 LiverLoaf\n\nAnybody remember Geneva Smith? That was her maiden name. Haven't seen her in years. What's she up to ?\n\n32 Just Wondering\n\nAnyone remember any Isaacs or Adkinses?\n\n33 Memories\n\nI remember Frances Adkins but not a Geneva Smith or any Adkinses.\n\n34 Just Wondering\n\nWhat do you remember about her ?\n\n35 Memories\n\nShe was just a classmate.\n\n36 Nicole\n\nCharlotte Wood is my aunt. She is still beautiful and a very awesome lady. She now lives in Tennessee.\n\n37 Remembering\n\nDid she marry Kay Casada ?\n\n38 Nicole\n\nNo. She married Charlie Tucker. He played ball for Ferguson and majored in Engineering at the University of Cincinnati .\n\n39 Classmate\n\nI graduated with Charlie. He was a pistol in high school.\n\n40 Remembering\n\nHow many people remember these ballplayers for the Warhorses : Harry Cummins, Paul Stevens, Howard Hunt, Bobby Cundiff, Malcolm Luttrell, David Carr, Jimmy Cundiff, Ray Kasada ?\n\n41 Remember When\n\nI haven't seen Charlotte in years. Do you talk to her often. Maybe you could call her and tell her about this thread.\n\n42 Hmmm\n\nWhat do they do with the school now ?\n\n43 Knowitall\n\nThey use the old home ec & office building for community and family functions. They just recently finished a new shelter (really outstanding). The old school and auditorium was burned to the ground in 1995, tremendous fire monitored by the Ferguson Fire Department. Any memories of Herb Childers, Ms. Margaret Cowan, Mrs. Stogsdill, Phillip and Mary Baker, or Lindsey Calhoun? And speaking of ballplayers, anybody remember Don Minton, Larry Duncan, Jackie Linville, and Cecil Phelps ?\n\n44 I Do\n\nI remember Mrs. Margaret, Mrs. Stogsdill, and Mr. and Mrs. Baker. I don't remember the others. Do you recall a Christmas play put on in the auditorium called \"The Littlest Angel\" ? And as far as ballplayers, remember Mike Richardson, Donnie Gibson, Gerald Phelps, Buzzie Strunk, Kerry Cowan and Bobby Cundiff ?\n\n45 Remember Who remembers Margaret Cowen when she was Margaret Mason? I am 58. She was my third grade teacher and before that she had taught my Mom and my uncles. Mrs. Margaret was The BEST !!! Does anyone recall Farmers Hill, where we would take cardboard boxes and old tires in the Winter time, after a snow, and slide down. Not one of us could afford a sled, but we had more fun ! 46 Knowitall\n\nAre you talking about Newton Street Hill or the hill that went down toward Reddish Street---the one that wasn't gravelled or paved? By the way, I just happen to have a copy of a 1966 Ferguson yearbook at my fingertips. Who remembers waiting for the schoolbus at Hydens Store and putting 90 to 100 kids on that 55 passenger bus with 3 and 4 to a seat and everybody else standing?? By the time we got to school EVERYBODY was very good friends. But now I don't rermember that \"Littlest Angel\" Christmas play. At the time my thoughts and interests were misdirected to other events.\n\n47 Yup I remember a big white house at the top of the hill. The people who lived there were named Farmer. Thus it became Farmers Hill. I'm thinking it wasn't the one that went down to Reddish Avenue. However, I could be wrong. You could see the Farmer house from where I lived. Did you go there, too ? 48 Remember\n\nI was 16 years old in that yearbook. I think that is the yearbook that has the picture in back of our first Journalism Class taught by Mr. Omlor. I was one of the few who took that class. Jackie Linville is also in that picture.\n\n49 Knowitall\n\n1966 was the year the book was dedicated to the memory of Jack Richardson. That teacher you mention was Dan Omlor. He was a teacher/coach, drove a blue Mustang convertible and loved JBoys from Jerry's. That street you're talking about was Catron Street. It came down by the Baptist Church and on out to Jacksboro. I know every street, alley, driveway and sidewalk in Ferguson.\n\n50 Remember\n\nSorry he got the name wrong. I remember he told about living in Harlem back in the day when it was all black. Damn your memory is good. Wish mine was half as good. How did he ever end up in Ferguson anyway? He wasn't there very long. Was Jack Richardson Mike's brother ? I was born and raised in Ferguson and knew every street, but I left and was gone for 25 years before returning to care for my Mom. Things have changed so much I don't recognize anything anymore. My best friend lives in her childhood home, but has remodelled a lot. My childhood home is gone.\n\n51 Margaret\n\nWas Charlie Anderson the bus driver on that overcrowded bus you talked about ?\n\n52 Anyone\n\nDoes anyone remember any Isaacs or Adkinses?\n\n53 Knowitall\n\nJack was Mike's uncle or cousin. Omlor originated out of Pennsylvania. I also remember Mr. Hayden (who had a fight with Bill Brannon), Woodrow Gosser, and Mr. Ward (who lived on Murphy where Carol Sexton owns now). I also have a sad memory. I was at David Cowan's house just five minutes after he shot himself and I had the unpleasant task of helping load him in the hearse.\n\n54 Remember\n\nDid anyone ever have a clue about why David Cowen shot himself? He was my 8th grade PE teacher and I remember having the biggest crush on him. I also remember him having a great sense of humor and being very, very kind.\n\n55 Knowitall Yes, that bus driver you were asking about was Charlie Anderson. He was also a custodian. There was also Mitch Miller, Ed Gallagher, Mr. Ward and Mr. Wilson. All these men drove buses and worked as custodians but Gallagher and Wilson were part time. 56 Remember\n\nDid you ever hear the rumor that Charlie had a married girlfriend who lived the next street over from Spencer. I can't remember the name of the street, but it was the same one Dummy Hutchinson lived on. Is Dummy still alive? I have to call him that because I don't remember ever hearing his real name.\n\n57 Knowitall\n\nThere were several rumors about David. He was sitting in a recliner, a .22 caliber rifle between his legs, one hole in the center of his forehead, head off to one side. His wife found him. Very sad.\n\n58 Remember\n\nWhen I left Somerset, David wasn't married. Who did he marry and did he have children ?\n\n59 Knowitall\n\nCharlie for a while had a very good friend named Betty Jones Sadler while she was separated from Elmer Jones. She and Elmer are now very happily married and attend Ferguson Methodist Church. Dummy is still alive but very old. His name is Charles Hutcherson. David married a very nice lady named Dorothy. They had two sons, John and Sam, and one daughter.\n\n60 Remember\n\nElmer was away in the army. Does Betty Lou still live in the same house? And does Lois Fisher still live on Spencer? Do you still see a lot of people we went to school with ? As for David, you never know what is going on in a person's life. It seems they have everything going for them, and then they end up like him. That is very sad because I remember him being a happy go lucky person who was always so kind to others.\n\n61 Knowitall\n\nI forgot about Elmer being in the army. He and Betty still live there. Lois Ann should still be living in the same little house. Since I don't know who you are, I can't say if I know who you went to school with. However, yes, I still see a lot of folks I went to school with.\n\n62 Anyone\n\nI hate to get on anyone's nerves because this is the only topic I have seen without cussing and bashing in it, but I would like to know if anyone has any memories of any Isaacs.\n\n63 Knowitall\n\nThere used to be a famly of Isaacs that lived on the corner of Brandon and Jacksboro. They had one boy named Matthew, one named Vernon, and several others whose names escape me. That's all I know. Sorry.\n\n64 Remember\n\nThere were no Isaacs that went to Ferguson School that I remember.\n\n65 Rusty Nail I went to Ferguson in the eartly 70s. I remember twins, Jack and John Richardson, Regina Ramsey (who I still know), Janice Simpson, Chuck Wood, Jack Strong, Jane Begley, Beth somebody and Junior somebody. 69 I Remember\n\nFor the life of me I can't remember them. I probably see people I went to school with all the time and don't know their faces. I went to the last 67-68 reunion and I guess I was looking for the faces to be the same as back in school days. I worked on the reunion with Joetta, Sandra Denney, and Barbara Sanders. It was my job to give out name tags at the door and I had to ask some of the people their names. I felt so stupid, but I didn't recognize them. I think Donnie Gibson still looked the same. Brenda New hasn't changed much either, and Joetta hasn't changed a whole lot.\n\n70 Knowitall\n\nThe last class reunion I attended was many years ago, held at the Holiday Inn Banquet Room. Great people, good time. I would suggest extending the period between school get togethers to a minimum of 2-3 years and maybe the attendance would increase. More people, less hair, fewer teeth, more gossip, better time.\n\n71 School Days\n\nRemember when it seemed like it was just our little bunch? You went out with her boyfriend and swore to keep it a secret? Then she married him! Whoops !!\n\n73 Knowitall\n\nBelieve it or not, I'm totally lost on what she was talking about. The reunion you're talking about must have been around the time I moved to Lexington for three years. Bet I missed a lot.\n\n74 Remember\n\nKnowitall, do you know David Mosley, Mark Purcell or Dr. Howard Lynd. They are all members of the Masonic Lodge, some in Somerset and one in Burnside.\n\n75 Knowitall\n\nI personally know David Mosley from many years back. Mark Purcell is the Senior Deacon at Somerset # 111, and has started attending Burnside #634 recently. Howard Lynd is a mystery. Why would you assume I would know about the Masonic Lodge. If someone is trying to uncover my real identity, have a ball. I will fess up when it happens. My pseudo stems from the fact I am a patron of the literary arts. Every day produces new items of info to be absorbed into certain areas of the cranium. As to questions about the Masonic Lodge, as I understand, they are very open and public. However, as I may or not be a male, this info is readily available to the public. I love these forums. Let's keep them decent and open to all. Thanks.\n\n76 Remember\n\nOh, No. I thought I recognized you from another thread. I have personally enjoyed the back and forth about Ferguson. The other thread was about the Masonic Lodge. Both David and Mark are personal friends of mine. Dr. Lynd was a student of David's three years ago. I just wondered if he was still a member.\n\n78 Remember\n\nI remember Lonnie and he was funny that night. Barbara was self appointed Master of Ceremonies but I don't remember her husband. Sharon Dennywas there, too. She lives in Florida and rarely comes home, according to Sandi. I can't remember everyone there, but like I said before I worked the door,giving out name tags, and I did not recognize a lot of people. Do you go to the reunions at the school? Joetta said this last one had a lot of people she and I went to school with.\n\n79 Knowitall\n\nI haven't made it for the last couple of years but I inspected the new shelter three weeks ago. It's outstanding. My favorite (and only) grand baby was trying to find my picture in the hallway the other day and wanted to know which was me but I'll never tell.\n\n80 I Remember\n\nYou only have one grandchild? I have eight grandchildren and one great grand child. I have four children, but only two live here. I remember in high school everyone was saying what they wanted to do after graduation. The only great goal I ever had was to marry someone who would be good to me and have a houseful of kids. I being an only child was lonely as a kid. I married very well, led a privileged life, had 4 kids, drove a Mercedes and got my behind beat every day. I lived all over the world, and look where I ended up : back in Kentucky. And my fondest memories being my days at Ferguson School, not the days of living with a ton of money. I have really enjoyed this thread. You have helped me relive the days that mean the most to me. Thank You.\n\n81 Knowitall\n\nFirst, ask Mark what he drove to the picnic Saturday, and how much it costs to drive from Bronston. I, too, married, had kids, travelled the world, made much money, drove BIG, drive small, including a Jag, and have put a lot of false info in these messages, not to mislead but to conceal my ID, am well known, loved, respected, but I have a lot of fun.\n\n82 Man O War\n\nThat boyfriend - girlfriend scenerio that poster was talking about, Heck, that wasn't no secret, he told all the boys back then. We knew who the bad girls were.\n\n83 Knowitall\n\nBad girls at Ferguson? Surely Not. I never heard of such.\n\n84 I Remember\n\nYou asked what Mark drove to the picnic. It was a 38 ft. RV.\n\n85 Knowitall\n\nYou are correct.\n\n86 I Remember\n\nThose bad girls they're talking about must have happened before my time. I simply do not remember any loose legged girls. I remember people talking about one of the older Duncan girls because she was seen kissing Carl Minton, who was supposed to be Laura Schaffer's squeeze. Carl's mother's name was Carrie. Isn't he the one who was killed in a car wreck ?\n\n90 Annuals\n\nI have my Dad's annual from 1964. His name was Lester Haynes Jr. My grandma didn't want to send him to school by himself, so she held him back a year, until my aunt, Shirley, was old enough to go to school, and then they walked together. My Dad's picture is still on the wall at Ferguson. He played basketball for David Cowen. Unfortunately, he died a while back.\n\n91\n\nFor Knowitall\n\nCan you clarify something? Wasn't there a store downtown that used to have escalators? 92 Murph\n\nAs far as those loose legged women, the boys from PC always knew who they were.\n\n93 Knowsmore\n\nThe escalator was in the United Department Store. It was on the southeast side of the fountain.\n\n94 Knowitall\n\nIs it possible for more than one person to post with a screen name? Someone else seems to be using the name Knowitall.\n\n95 Enlightened At Last\n\nI remember Carolyn Carr from hearing her on a local radio station years ago. Several years after that, about 20 years ago, I actually met her. David Carr is her brother. He is Brother David who founded Temple Christian Academy where my daughter attended from 1984-86. Carolyn seems like a very nice person, and if she's anything like David, she would have to be a saint!\n\n96 Knowitall\n\nWho remembers Prince Albert, who used to work at the Virginia Cinema? Blind John Redmon, who sold pencils and gum in front of the old Newtonian Hotel? The lighthouse on Fountain Square? City bus service in the 1950s? The two door buses, with the bell cord you pulled at your stop? Bunny Bread that came out in 1956 or '57? The ice cream truck that sold 10 cent Snow Birds? When Porter Hopkins new school first opened? The OLD Parker School? The White Street gang ? Bourne Avenue gang? Griffin Avenue gang? The Gregory boys? Red Wilson? Artis Stargle? Robert Brassfield?\n\n97 I Remember\n\nDid you ever hear of an old Tuberculosis sanitarium in Ferguson? It was supposed to sit on Unity Hill. I never heard of it. Rumor says it was called Unity Hill Sanitarium, then changed to Watson Sanitarium and lastly was Somerset Business School. Where IS Unity Hill ?\n\n99 I Remember\n\nWas that house there when we were kids? Damn. I lived on Spencer and I don't remember it at all. I assume it isn't there anymore. Do you remember Neek Calhoun? She was Judy Burton's grandmother and I recall hearing my grandparents say all the time that she was a witch. Also Mrs. Hickey who lived down by the rr tracks and by the old Indian graveyard. Is that graveyard still there?\n\n100 Hardwick Does anyone remember a focus group from a major soda pop distribution company camer to the school and conducted a taste test for Big Red and Mountain Dew in 1963? What a happy event that was !! 101 Redfox\n\nDoes anyone remember Paris Valenture ?\n\n102 SHS Grad\n\nI have spent the last half hour reading all of your posts. I am not that familiar with Ferguson but I so loved reading all of your memories. Life was simpler then. We all took it for granted.\n\n103 Knowitall\n\nParis Velenture was Mike Galloway's brother in law.\n\n104 Ooohmygosh\n\nI remember bothof them but if you remember Mrs. Hamilton the seat of your britches would still be hottt.\n\n105 Redfox\n\nWhatever happened to Paris? Last I heard he was up around Covington.\n\n107 I Remember\n\nMollie Hamilton was my 6th grade teacher. Do you remember her at the reunion we spoke about? She still looked great.\n\n109 ANanny\n\nI remember Kickapoo Joy Juice but I hadn't thought of it til you mentioned it.\n\n110 Anyone\n\nRemember any Isaacs ?\n\n111\n\nKnowitall9\n\nI have searched my memory fromend to end and the only Isaacs I recall are Matthew, Mark and Vernon. Kenny Isaacs from Oak Hill may be a source. He's a Magistrate on Pulaski Fiscal Court. Hope this helps. 112 Christian Ardoin\n\nMom I love you more than anything in this world. I just want you to know that.\n\n113\n\nKnowitall9\n\nBy the way, I Remember, since you lived on Spencer, did your home sit sideways to the street? Not being nosy. Just trying to put things into place. 115 Hardwick\n\nThank You. I was beginning to think I was slipping. it's so much fun to recollect !!\n\n116 I Remember It's strange what we remember from when we were kids. I remember not having a whole lot. I remember my mother, as well as yours, working her butt off. I wasn't lucky being an only child. I was lonely. I think I was born lonely. You had a bunch of siblings and I always envied that. You were always the class clown. Some loved you and some despised you, but one thing I always admired about you was you were always just you. You have certainly entertained me this week and I thank you for that. I have a terminal illness and I seldom go anywhere. You have taken me home again. I say thank you for all the memories. And yes, I lived kittycornered on Spencer. 117 Fergie\n\nWhen you people mention names on here, would you keep in mind how that affects their present family members. A witch ? Rats ate her feet and fingers off ? Not meaning any disrespect to you.\n\n118 Went To Ferguson\n\nBarbara Sanders' \"skinny little man's\" name is Steve. He worked under me at Tecumseh.\n\n119 I Remember\n\nSorry if anyone has been offended. That was certainly not the intention. This has been a fun and memorable thread. We don't anyone to start bashing on here. Just curious, though : who in the world is still around that is kin to Mrs. Hickey ?\n\n121 Jake\n\nDoes anybody remember the old funeral home up near Harris Hills Apartments.\n\n124\n\nKnowitall9\n\nThank you,Ma'm, I, too, have had a lion's share of problems. No one's fault but my own : twisted spine, shot twice, seizures, ruptured stomach, broken bones, two possible strokes, bone spurs on spine, minor paralysis, several ruptured discs, probably got Parkinson's Disease in one arm and hand, and worst of all, a sense of humor. I just keep going.\n\nIf you envied me because of all my siblings, I would have been happy to send them all to you. The one next younger than me is terminal also. I have been a stem cell donor twice in the last few years. She says that's what is keeping her alive.\n\n125 Redfox\n\nDoes anyone remember teachers Mr. Lawrence and Mr. Norfleet? Mr. Lawrence lived in Russell Springs. Mr. Norfleet lived in Windsor. This was in the late 1950s.\n\n126 Knowitall9\n\nI think that would be Curtis Norfleet. He taught 7th grade and had gone to Union College.\n\n127 I Remember\n\nMr. Norfleet was a tall thin man with a balding head. His shoes always looked spit shined. He was only at Ferguson one or two years.\n\n129 I Remember\n\nKnowitall9 : I talked to your sister who lost her son in the bike accident about two months ago at Dr. Stephens' office and again that same day at the lab. I thought she looked great, certainly didn't look her age, and it was great to talk to her. I never knew who she was married to until I read in the paper about the accident. The bike accident was terrible and her son was very handsome. I feel really bad for her. Sorry to hear about your young sister. What is wrong with her? Is it the one who lives at the end of Murphy? Man...she and her husband do great things for their kids.\n\n130\n\nKnowitall9\n\nHardwick : How about when some of the guys got out for lunch, ran all the way to the Elihu store, got a pop, had time to smoke, then ran all the way back to school in time for the next class?\n\nI Remember : The sister that is sick is in Florida. She has multiplemyaloma cancer. She's been through it all ---chemo, radical surgery, etc. The only thing that helps besides her family on both sides and her faith is me and my 110% pure blood, according to the doctors. The one that lives on Jacksboro is the youngest. Can you believe she and her hubby have EIGHT urchins ??\n\n137\n\nKnowitall9\n\nNone of this generation would remember that. Luretha was the name of the town. The Post Office and a store were in front of the building. A now deceased Ferguson resident had a small repair shop to the rear close to the back of the Baptist Church, where the biggest walnut tree is now. Some time ago, I saw a set of pictures made when they were initially paving Jacksboro Street. The houses from 500 down to 527 were visible. The scenes looked similar to today. One close friend of ours, now 95, still lives in one of the houses today. The pictures showed the area from Newton Street north toward the curve past the Fisher store property. Somewhere I also have a photo, taken in 1957, at the train depot on South Main, showing the 3rd grade class from Parker School, boarding the Royal Palm Express Passenger Train for a field trip ride to Burnside. We got off at the Burnside Depot, close to where the tracks cross East French Avenue. Claude Shadoan, brother in law to Norman Gover, was the conductor, and I can remember him saying, \"Tickets, Please.\" 1957 ain't that far back, but I guess it's still history. 138\n\nHatfield\n\nMy mother went there and graduated in 1962. Her name was Reba Phelps then. She still lives in the same house on Railroad Street, right beside the school. 139\n\nKnowitall9\n\nReba and Bunt will always be prominent figures around Ferguson, along with Tooter keeping them straight. And let me add that Theo was a giant in his own right. 140\n\nI Remember\n\nDo you remember Denny Waddle who lived across from the Baptist Church? He only had one arm and looked like a turkey gobbler in the face. Beside that he was meaner than heck. Mike Galloway's Mom, Helen, and my Mom were best friends. I remember Helen was at my house one day and Mr. Waddle had pulled Mikie in his house and beat the crap out of him, accusing him of trashing his flower garden. Mikie was about eight years old. The incident was brought to light that Sunday in church and Mr. Waddle was asked to step down from the deaconship. I also remember Reba very well. She was quite a bit older than me but I remember she had the prettiest hair. Wasn't she a cheerleader ? Oh, and, are you talking about Tooter Hickenbottom? 141 Knowslittle The town of Ferguson was never called Luretha. It was only the post office that was Luretha. There was already another post office named Ferguson, so the post office was named after the postmaster's daughter (who still lives in Louisville) and when the original Ferguson post office closed, then the Luretha Post Office was allowed to be called Ferguson. 142 Knowitall9 I stand corrected. And, no, not Tooter Hickenbottom but Hatfield's Aunt Tooter. 143 Old Been There I thought Tooter's last name was Higgenbottom. 144 Knowitall9 Different Tooter 145 Knowslittle Knowitall9, your memory is very good. I enjoy reminiscing about those times when people were kinder to each other and neighbors were friendly to each other. On Tooter's last name, I believe it's Higgenbotham. 146 Knowitall9 Sorry, but the one I mentioned is a different lady. 147 I Remember Who remembers Godby's Market? You could call on the phone and give your order and a guy named Joe would deeliver the groceries. That's how I got caught smoking. I called and added a pack of cigs to the order my mom had placed before she went to work. Because of the cigs being ordered late they were not included with the first order, which came before my mom came home. Mr. Godby personally delivered them on his way home after closing the store. I was busted...in more ways than one. 148 Knowitall9 ...And Mr. Waddle rightly SHOULD have stepped down from the deaconship. I cannot imagine Mike harming anyone else's property. I remember Gody's Market, old and new. Elwood Godby and Tom Anderson ran the store and Joe Burton was custodian and delivery man. He drove a 1950 Chevy panel truck. Tom Anderson went on to open a store at Langdon & Monticello Streets. Elwood's son, Mike, Godby's Store til it closed. Tom Anderson's son was Tommy Wayne, class of 1966. He's now deceased. 149 RedFox The only store I remember on Monticello and Langdon Streets was Corrells Grocery. They tore it down and built a church there. 150 Knowitall9 Corrells Store used to be where the service station is now. The Nazarene Church is in the building where the Oak Hill Chapel of Morris & Hislope used to be. Tom Anderson's store was where the parking lot is now for the Langdon Street Church. Corrells Store was at Monticello Street and Oak Hill. It's now Amanda's, the Somerset Oil Place. 151 Memories I remember Mr. Godbey would bring the church at Christmas brown paper bags for each kid with fruit and a peppermint stick in each one. Every one was so happy with that back then. Now, some kids would probably just throw that away. He was a good man. He went to church at Ferguson Baptist. He would run a charge list for quite some time to help people out. They could pay when they could. 152 Knowitall9 We were so poor at Christmas, when we got that candy and fruit, I'd have to save the fruit til July and then pretend I'd got it for my birthday. 153 I Remember I always thought the church provided those bags. it was great to get them at Christmas. We never had oranges at my house. I always thought that was one of the best things about the holidays. My mom and dad had a charge account at Godby's as long as I remember. I guarantee I only charged cigarettes on it once, though. LOL. 154 Knowitall9 Speaking of hard times. Where my Dad worked, at Christmas, each employee got a box filled with a ham, sausages, bacon and turkey. Other than that, Mon-Tues-Thurs-Fri it was beans, corn bread and some kind of spuds. Wednesday was payday, so we had hamburger, ice cream and cookies. Saturday was breakfast and then sandwiches. Sunday was home killed chicken. or cube steak (the cheap kind) and left overs for supper. Our menu was constant for years. To this day most of my family avoids beans like the plague. I love 'em, because there were always plenty. My urchins were raised on them, too. However, my wife never ate a bean til she moved to Kentucky in 1970 --- can you believe that? 155 RedFox The old Ford tire recapping place was a good place to buy tires. We couldn't afford new ones. Also the restaurant on Jacksboro was a hangout. Phelpses had it. I think it was just down the street from the post office. 156 Knowitall9 Phelps Restaurant was in the building that's now Coy Cox's Apartments. The old Ford tire recapping place was before my time but we had Bryan Morrow at G & B Tire. Bryan was a savior for me and others for tires. 157 Sunshine I also grew up in Ferguson and attended school there. I remember most everyone that has been mentioned so far. Concerning the houses on Shoopman Lane. There was another house that was occupied by DeWayne (who I think was deaf) and Nancy Woodall. They were cousins of Peggy Sears, who lived on the South End of Reddish Street. Does anyone remember the Merritts who ran the gas station on Murphy during the late 60s and 70s? Whatever happened to them? 158 Knowitall9 The Woodall name is familiar. I remember back in the late 50s and early 60s there were some smaller houses in that area. Did Halls and Girdlers live there? As for the Merritts, that would be Gay, his wife Judy and son Ricky. I still see Gay and Ricky occasionally. I think there has been a tragedy in their family lately. 159 Sunshine Earlier you were talking about Mintons and Yahnigs. There were three Minton boys : Harvey, Joe Frank, and Carl Wayne. Joe and Harvey were both great ball players. Carl Henry Yahnig is a coach at Hopkinsville in Western Kentucky. 160 Knowitall9 I remember all the names but they were several years ahead of me. You are correct, though, they were all great ball players. 161 RedFox I knew the Woodalls. The one that was deaf was Doug. Dwayne was younger. He's been dead for several years. 162 I Remember My uncles played ball at Ferguson. Their last name was Buck. These names you mention are people my uncles used to talk about. Another one in that group was Max Flynn. 163 I Remember This all reminds me of the meanest but funniest prank we ever played. Mr. and Mrs. Cy Soard lived across the street from me. They went to Cotter Avenue Church of God. Every Wednesday night they had a prayer meeting at their house. It always got very loud and involved a lot of speaking in tongues. My best friend was at my house one of those nights. Service was in full swing. We decided with all the shouting going on everyone attending was probably hungry. So we called Finleys and ordered about 50 bucks worth of Finleyburgers. Then we called a cab and had the driver pick up the food and deliver it to the Soards. if you recall, a cab driver would pay for things and then collect the money when it was delivered. When the cab arrived with the food the Soards wouldn't of course accept it. The driver had already paid for it and demanded money from Mr. Soard. There was a lot of talking in tongues but it was from the cab driver. Service was adjourned pretty quickly and the cab driver left with all those burgers. 164 Knowitall9 Rocker Girl way back there was asking if anyone remembered Casey Bell. I knew Casey. I also knew Sammy and Mack Bell. Sammy was the quietest. Casey was always 100% in whatever he did. Mack was into anything to have fun and was always up for a dare. Which one was your Dad? 165 I Remember Knowitall9, do you remember all the times you put gum in Mr. Young's chair in the new music room? I will never forget how mad he would get. He knew it was you, but no one ever told. It was too funny. Then one time Mr. Young had gone to the office to tell Mr. Higgins that you had put gum in his chair AGAIN, and when he left the room that was when you took all the fuses out of the fuse box that was located right outside the music room door. When he got back all the lights were out and Mr. Young was just furious!!! 166 Knowitall9\n\nI do sort of remember something like that but I was just an innocent bystander. However, in my defense, I should tell you that in 1968, when I was stationed in Germany, I came across several 33 1/3 albums of the best classical music I ever heard. I had them shipped to Mr. Young at the school. He even sent me a thank you card. I hoped that made up for the alleged gum and breaker incidents.\n\nHowever, having been in the taxi business myself after returning to civilian life, that Finleys prank you pulled was really mean. Shame on you. That was almost as bad as me wearing the same socks for six years without washing them.\n\nBy the way, I still see Joe Flynn occasionally. Years ago, when I had my trucks, I hauled Joe a lot of gravel to his new home in Eagles Nest. Max Flynn, who sold my Dad all his cars, now works for the State Department.\n\n167 I Remember I'm glad we could start a thread as simple as this one and bring back so many good memories for everyone, myself included, without any negative things posted. I think this is a first for Topix. 168 Knowitall9 You were talking about prayer meetings at the Soards. There was also Della Bray and husband Joe. Della started preaching on Jacksboro in her garage. Sometimes, depending on how the spirit led her, it could go on for a whole week. Not much of that around anymore. 169 I Remember I remember Della Bray, but I never had the pleasure of attending her services. Does anybody remember the Gossetts that lived down from the Hutchinsons? Who remembers Buck Gossett's alleged profession ? 170 Knowitall9\n\nI never knew Buck, but Sonny followed right in his footsteps in more ways than one. His hobby helped a lot of us. Nuff Said.\n\nWas Carl your uncle or great uncle? I knew him years ago shortly after he retired from delivering mail. He talked about being involved with Tom's vending machine company.\n\n171 RedFox I remember the Gossetts when they lived on North Langdon Street. Buck lived over by the hospital. 172 Know More\n\nSomebody way back there was asking about Isaacs. At one time Sam Isaacs lived in Ferguson with his wife and two daughters. I don't remember their names but I have a picture of us as kids going trick or treating. They lived off Brandon Street left up the hill behind Dexter Burton's house.\n\nI am from the Mullinix family. There were two families of Mullinixes in Ferguson. My grandparents were Macie and Matthew. We are having a family reunion next Saturday at Ferguson School and I would love to hear some more memories about them and Ferguson. Knowitall9's mom wrote the Ferguson news, and she and my grandma were good friends.\n\n173 I Remember Carl was my great uncle. He and his wife lived in my old house after my mom moved to Lexington to work at St. Joseph's Hospital. The person that owned Tom's was Howard Conley. Howard was my grandfather's youngest sister's son. Howard is now at Sunrise Manor. He is 86 years old and his memory is as good as yours. I go and visit when I can. Today would have been my mom's 90th birthday. She has been dead for 10 years. It doesn't seem that long. 174 Knowitall9 My mother was killed on Murphy, at the North edge of the Baptist Church parking lot on March 3, 1980. She was 88, I think. Then my Dad died in 1994. 175 Red Fox Does anyone remember the Ramp Rodders Car Club? In the late 1950s they met at the old coal temple. They had nice cars. They helped people with car troubles out a lot. 176 Knowitall9 I knew some of the Mullinex family. Marion used to live next door to my Dad. The elderly Mrs. Mullinex lived at the corner of Waddle and Catron, in the big grey house where Larry Stringer lives now. My youngest sister had a friend Jenny Mullinex. 177 Little Rock I'm Jed. 178 Knowitall9 There is still a coal tipple on Crane Road. There used to be a coal yard or something connected with coal in the curve at the Woods crossing tracks. Vernon Carr's family (David-Carolyn) lived very close. Roy Garner owns it now. I think that car club was the Ram Rodders. Ronnie Durham, Ervil Bray, Jimmy Young, Ersie Baker and J P Kennedy were some of the members. That brings back memories of old cars. Malcolm Luttrell had a Studebaker. HH had a '55 Buick with a truck 4 speed bulldog tranny. Lester Haynes had a black 40 something Chevy. He stuck two radio antennas in the fenders where they bolted to the car. BY had a Studebaker Lark. LM or LD had a white 59 Impala. JP had the sharpest 59 Impala R/W. He also had a 50 Merc. We pushed the Merc half way to Omega Park Road from Alcalde. JPK had a 57 Nomad. LD had a 48 Ford p/u with a 383 in it and then maybe a Caddy motor. 179 Red Fox Does anybody know what happened to Peggy Sears? Last I knew she was in Corbin. 180 Sunshine There were two Tooters. One lived on Jacksboro. Married to Frank Higginbotham. Tooter (Bunt's wife) was a Ping. Also a cheerleader. Now a Phelps. 181 Knowitall9 I knew three Sears families in Ferguson. One family at the top of Grovers Lane. Callie Sears family on Reddish Street. Grey house where Jody and Ollie McGlothin own now. Another Sears family on Reddish Street towards Maguire. 182 Red Fox Peggy lived in the grey house above you. She married Mile Wilson. 183 I Remember I wish our kids could go back to our days and live life like we did. I guarantee they would appreciate life a whole lot more. At least we weren't doing drugs. No one went to jail for armed robbery and I never heard of a DUI. Stealing fuses does not count. That was done for a laugh, like gum in the teacher's chair. There were no kids bringing guns to school and killing people. My kids, like most of yours, lived a privileged life compared to what we grew up with. They had a life I never had and was better off not having. My kids didn't turn out anywhere near as good as we did. Maybe because we weren't allowed to beat them. 184 Knowitall9 At that age I was still trying to figure out what girls were created for. Still don't know all of it. Does anyone remember the saw mill on Crane Road that was next to the junk yard, where the power sub station is now? 185 Sunshine I have a 1959 yearbook with a pic of Curtis Borfleet in it. I remember having him in Kentucky History class. 186 Knowitall9 Maybe you didn't beat your kids but many times I put a boot in my boys' rear ends for talking back to their mother. 187 I Remember Don't you have a daughter? When I first moved back here in 1994, my youngest daughter was 12. She went to Southern Middle. She made friends with your daughter. They were great friends but you all moved. 188 Knowitall9 One night me, BW and LD were racing a 58 Ford against LD's 58 Chevy from Jerrys to Finleys. A state cop was behind us. We kept going South. Me and BW in the Ford turned on Parker Mill Road and ran back into Ferguson, parked at BW's house, I ran home, crawled in the window, hid in bed. LD turned on Slate Branch and got caught. Later, someone knocked on my door. My Dad made me answer the door. The trooper had picked up both LD and BW. He wrote all of us tickets. In court, John W. Garner was Judge then. Out in the hallway, we told the Judge the story. He said if we paid $30 each, he would dismiss the tickets. That was in 1966. I still owe that fine. 190 Sunshine I remember Reba Phelps. She was a cheerleader and good dancer with a great personality. 191 Knowitall9\n\nI Remember : My third child is Ann Marie, now 25, living in Jasper, Missouri, a federal corrections officer. The move you mention was in 1999 when we moved to Lexington. Ann graduated from Tates Creek. She now has two crotch rockets, a Chevy Pickup and a fairly decent boy friend who can mow grass pretty well but doesn't drink beer.\n\nSunshine : Theo was a very kind hearted man. His passing was a loss to everyone. But he never would sell me that 66 Chevy.\n\n192 I Remember That's her. My daughter Casey is also 25. She graduated here from Southerwestern, was nominated for Homecoming and Prom Queen, had everything paid for at Transylvania. But she got mixed up with the wrong friends. I wish she had stayed friends with kids like yours. 193 Knowitall9 Ann had that problem in Lexington. She let things slip, but thanks to Summer School and some good teachers she made it. I finished my own schooling in the Army. By the way, do I see a new house where your old house stood? 194 I Remember Yes. My Mom wasn't thinking real clearly in her last few years and one of the neighbors talked her into selling it for way below market value. That property had been paid up for 40 years. So Midway Plumbing bought it, tore our house down, and put five new ones on it. 195 Knowitall9 When we were growing up there were some kind of trucks out in the field there. Maybe a drilling rig? Was your Dad a driller? 196 Blondie I remember hanging out at Gays Service Station. I think Doug Strunk worked there some. 197 Knowitall9 Doug was working for Gay when I got out of the army and went to Indiana for a year. It was around 1970. I somehow got in a fight in the back of Gays Garage with Jimmy Denney. He was a tough little feller. We beat each other up pretty good. Surgeon had to rebreak my right thumb twice, reset it, and second time put a pin in it for 16 weeks. 198 Classmate Betty sings in a gospel group called Unlimited. They appear on the Beattyville station WLJC. Barbars lives in Shopville. 199 I Remember My daddy was a core driller. Owned his own business, \"Standard Core Drilling.\" 200 Murphy Doug played on that Ferguson 7th grade team that made it to the state championship game. I think he was a reserve. 201 I Remember The girlfriend of the man hit with the shovel was at my house last night. When the shovel handler came out of his house the receiver of the shovel was leaned up against the bank, directly across the street, singing in a very loud clear voice, \"In The Pines...In The Pines.\" Both were quite intoxicated. The shovel handler was always more than a little bit off. My friend and I used to say that he and LaDora should have been together. Not being disrespectful, but that is more than the Truth. 202 Knowitall9 In Lexington we lived at The Mansion. I was on the porch, cleaning and reloading my 30-30 when it went off and blowed a hole in the porch. Five of Lexington's finest showed up. Seems there's an ordnance in Fayette County against shooting. I had just graduated from Chief Larry Walsh's Advanced Policy Academy. My shooting the gun didn't go over well. Thus ended my chances for a career in law enforcement. 203 I Remember One time I was driving down Tates Creek Road in Lexington with David and he pulled a gun from under the seat, held it out the window and started shooting. He still has a very large gun collection. It's in his garage. He has a vault loaded with every kind of gun imaginable. He'd make a dangerous enemy. 204 Blondie Whatever happened to Larry and Brent Ford? And what was Thelma Nixon's son's name? 205 Knowitall9 Larry is still around and a fine person. 206 Red Fox Larry is still involved in music. Thelma Nixon's son was always called CB. 207 Blondie Did David Mounce work at Gay's Station? 208 Knowitall9 There was a Mounce that lived in the apartment there. Eventually Gay sold out to Wheeler & Muse. 209 Sunshine I know for sure who Knowitall9 is and I'm pretty sure I know who I Remember is. There weren't too many only children in Ferguson. Both your mothers were great ladies. I have enjoyed reading this thread and remembering all the good and bad times. I thought I knew a lot about Ferguson but have learned a few things I didn't know. Thanks for keeping it clean. 210 Knowitall9 Appreciate the good words about my mother. Sometimes we should all stop and remember our parents. 211 Sunshine Does anybody remember when Mr. Nixon died? I was very small. CB had to have been very young. They had his casket in the living room and Thelma sat right beside it and refused to move. If I remember, he was shot, accidentally. 212 Blondie I didn't live in Ferguson too many years but all the people I knew were fine people. I remember Raymond Farmer. I think he was an only child and I think he is also deceased. 213 Knowitall9 Ray was my best friend for many years and, sadly, he did pass several months ago. Buried at Mill Springs. Yes, he was an only child. 214 Blondie Life has gone so fast it doesn't seem possible we're now the older generation. 215 I Remember\n\nThank you for the kind words about my Mom. Any kids who came to my house loved her. She could be a real meanie at times but I would give anything in the world to talk to her one more time.\n\nYes, Blondie, I never dreamed how lonely I would be when everyone is gone. No one to ask questions about the old days. No one to be there when you need a real family. I wish I could have had just one sibling. These posts have made such a difference in my life. Going back to yesterday helps me remember there was time when I wasn't sick, had good friends, and had no worries. My kids say to me, why do you spend so much time on this Ferguson website. They don't understand that remembering when I was a kid helps me forget that I am old. All your posts havge made me remember times I simply would not have remembered. I have a terminal heart condition. My time is short, but this has really helped.\n\nSunshine : His name was Jim Nixon. he and my Dad were best friends, both in the same business. Thelma was devastated when he died. I was a little bitty girl but I remember my Mom and Dad talking about his death often. Wasn't Thelma's Mom named Bertha Sears?\n\nDoes anyone remember our junior senior banquet? Raymond was my date. Do you remember when Larry Ford was in a band? Larry sings now with the Bill Gathier trio, has for years. Whatever happened to Gerald Phelps?\n\n216 Knowitall9 Sorry to hear about your condition. I was diagnosed with a heart ailment a few years ago. A person with my age, weight, etc., should have a heart rhythmn of 75 beats a minute. Mine is 45. If I get mad, it shoots up to 125. A pacemaker was suggested but I told them unless it was a 36 bolt model it wouldn't help. And my sisters are too busy or disapproving to come around much. 217 I Remember I have no idea why family ends up being too busy or doesn't speak because of some former incident. I hagve two children who treat me the same way. They just say they're busy. I was never too busy for them. 218 Sunshine Bertha's name wasn't Sears. Clark maybe. They lived across the street from the post office until they built the house right next to the post office. Knowitall9 said he remembers sitting in the p.o. with Thelma. so do I. 219 I Remember You're right. It was Clark. 220 Sunshine Backing up to the post office/store discussion, I remember that store. Whenever my Mom would send me and my girlfriend to the store, even though there were two closer, we would always go to the post office store because a cute guy worked there. I think his name was Guy. He was older than us. I think the property was finally bought by John Minton. Does anyone remember the small store that Evanses ran on Garrett Street? 221 Knowitall9 Clay Evans and his wife had a store on Garrett Store. There was a store on the 200 block of Jacksboro Street right where you mentioned. I think Hamms ran it. 222 Sunshine \"Former Student\" : You were asking about Mr. Moore. I left Ferguson in 1961 and he was still there. Apparently things got a bit wilder after I left. 223 Knowitall9 Oh, I don't think it ever got too wild. It waqs just that all the kids found out they actually had individual identities and wanted to express themselves. I did some expressing myself. Of course we figured out much later that 75% of our expressing was very misguided. But that's the difference in being 16 and 47.\n\n224 Sunshine Does anyone remember the Monticello Dips? Saturday night would not have been complete without making a couple of trips over the Dips. I remember a guy from Eubank with a l955 red Chevy with Creeper painted on the side. His car was really fast and I always liked to ride the Dips with him. 225 I Remember I remember those dips. My best friend had a boyfriend who also had a 57 Chevy. His was turquoise and white. They ujsed to let me tag along with them on Saturday nights and we would always go over those dips. I swear it felt like he was doing 100 mph. Our heads would hit the roof. We would also make frequent trips to what is now known as Rain Tree Bed & Breakfast. Back then it was just called The Old Haunted House. We imagined we saw strange lights moving back and forth. Does anyone know about that house? 226 Sunshine I know the house you're talking about. I was never in it, though. I seem to remember they filmed part of the movie Raintree County there. 227 I Remember You're right. It starred Elizabeth Taylor. That place has been for sale for a long time. I called the number on the for sale sign and they want $650,000 for it and will not take a penny less. I guess that's why it never sold. 228 Sunshine Whoa! I guess that would be a problem. Some of the kids used to go inside and spend the night. I would love to go inside but not sure I would want to spend the night there. 229 Blondie Does anybody know anything about the late 1960s and early 70s when the kids had to go to high school at Pulaski County. I remember when they waited on the bus at Gay's Gas Station. 229 Knowsalittle The Larry Ford that sings with Gaithers is not the Larry Ford from Ferguson. The Ferguson Larry Ford teaches music lessons to several people for various instruments and is very active at East Somerset Baptist Church in their orchestra. 230 Sunshine Speaking of haunted houses, does anybody remember the old house down below Ferguson School? I think Mrs. Nelson lived there. She worked in the lunch room at school. It actually belonged to Mrs. Taylor. She had been a teacher a long time ago. A baby was supposed to have fallen out of the upstairs window and the house was supposed to be haunted. It was all boarded up by the time we were in high school. There was supposed to be a Confederate cemetary out back. 231 I Remember I know that house. It sits back on the hill. When I was a kid I wished I lived in a house like that. We never had an indoor toilet until I was 13. Who remembers when we would turn over outhouses on Devils Night? 232 Skeezix Devils Nights are some of my most vivid memories of growing up. We would turn over at least half a dozen outhouses every year. Then once we pushed one over the hill and it rolled and rolled down the hill and it turned out there was somebody in it. We got in so much trouble the next year I wasn't allowed out all Halloween evening. 233 I Remember Who remembers when Ferguson School would have a cleaning day. High school students would go all over Ferguson knocking on doors and asking if thehy could clean their house for a donation. Can you imagine what the kids in school now a days would think about that? I couldn't get my kids to clean their own rooms much less someone else's whole house. 234 Sunshine Do you remember a little Soda Shoppe between the store and the post office? They had a juke box and little tables. They only had ice cream and cokes. We were all thrilled for about a week and then adults complained about something and they closed it. 235 I Remember I moved away in 1968 and was gone for 25 years. Why did Ferguson close the school? 236 Sunshine I'm not sure. They built Southern Elementary in 1981 and Southern Middle a few years later. They allowed the school to deteriorate and inspectors founr asbestos. They probably figured since they had the other schools nearby it was cheaper and easier to send the kids there than to restore the building and clean out the asbestos. Does anybody remember the railroad tunnels. They used to be scary as heck, but we went in them a few times. And does anybody remember dragging on Parker Mill Road? 237 Knowslittle I Remember : No. He lives in Somerset. He's remarried (his first wife died a long time ago) and she works for the city of Somerset. He has taught a lot of people music. He's very talented. Every year he has a recital of his students. The last I heard of his brother Brent, he was in Texas, and I believe he became a preacher. Their mother lives south of Somerset on Boat Dock Road.\n\n238\n\nRed Fox\n\nI remember those tunnels and the dragging on Parkers Mill Road. We sure had a lot of fun on our Saturday night gatherings. I've never forgotten it. 239\n\nSunshine\n\nYeah, a little dangerous but a lot of fun. Never got caught. Don't know where all the police were. Probably didn't have but three or four. 240\n\nI Remember\n\nSunshine : I always wondered why Ferguson wasn't allowed to have dances of any kind like the other schools. We weren't even allowed to have junior/senior proms. Anyone have any idea why? 241\n\nBlondie\n\nYou're right about Larry Ford. he is at East Somerset Baptist Church. My kids are members there. 242\n\nRed Fox\n\nSunshine, do you remember all the cars would gather at Denzil Trimble's house? There would be eight or 10 cars. We would drag about every weekend. There was an Owens from Nancy, a Flotter Robinson, Denzil, a Ward, and a lot more. 243 Sunshine\n\nRed Fox :I dated a boy who went. I remember Denzil. He was a few years older than me. Do you remember the time they closed the road and let everyone drag. The guy I dated was out of town that weekend and missed it. He was really mad.\n\nI Remember : No, I don't remember why not. Probably too many Baptists and Methodists. Do you remember a place over the old Virginia Theatre that had sock hops? Chicken Criswell was in charge of it. We used to like to go there so we could meet the Somerset guys. It was open every Saturday.\n\n244 Red Fox I don't remember the sock hops. I do remember a skating rink on Market Street. I used to go there a lot. It was a good place to have fun. We used to circle Finleys a lot, get a hamburger and half order of fries. That was about all I could afford. Does anybody remember Tom's Drive In at Oak Hill Road and 27? 245 Sunshine I just barely remember it. There was also a Sonny's. And there were Finleys, Burnside Finleys, and the Dinner Belle. We probably used $1.00 worth of gas and circled those joints all night. Gas was 25 cents a gallon. 246 Knowsmore I remember when Wheelers, Cowans, Nicholases and Youngs played for the Ferguson Warhorses. Late 50s early 60s. 247 Sunshine\n\nI didn't go the skating rink much. I could hardly stand up on skates. I learned how later, though. Was '57 the only year you went to Ferguson? I was there then. Mr. Norfleet's picture was in the 1959 annual. I'm not sure how many years he was there. You mentioned Peggy Sears and who she married. I remember Miss Smith, the home ec teacher trying to talk her out of getting married. I haven't heard anything about her for years. We used to attend Bible School and birthday parties together when we were little.\n\nKnowsmore : Yeah! One of the best teams Ferguson ever had! I loved it when they played Somerset and Burnside. Did you ever ride the school bus to any of the away games? And how about the cheerleaders? Sandra and Barbara Meece, Lida Jones, Carolyn Love?\n\nI Remember : I remember we always had a class trip at the end of school. We took the school bus. One year we went to Joyland Park in Lexington and one year we went to Cumberland Falls. Jimmy Young almost drowned. I'm surprised they let us go anywhere. My graduating class went to Florida but I didn't get to go with them. I didn't get my diploma from Ferguson but I wish I had.\n\n248 Red Fox I didn't ride the bus but I remember it would stop at Phelps Restaurant across from Palm Beach Company on Bourne Avenue. Wheelers are all gone except Glen and D.R and Bill, all good ball players. Those were good times. What ever happened to Donnie Cowan, also a good ball player. I used to take my car to their Dad's to get it worked on. 249 Knowitall9 The dragging started at 27 and went toward Ferguson. One car could cross the cross tie bridge, the other had to hit the creek. 250 Red Fox When we used to drag down there we would stop at the top of the hill. 251 Knowitall9 I remember going to Joyland Park one year. Mammoth Cave another year. 252 Sunshine Red Fox : I don't know where Donnie Cowan is. He had two sisters, Mickey and Maria Joe and I think an older brother. The last I heard, they all moved to California after their Dad died. 253 Red Fox David was the older brother. 254 I Remember I see Barbara Meece every once in a while. I swear she hasn't aged a day. Does anybody remember Buddy Phillips she went with? 255 Blondie\n\nI went to Burnside School. I worked for Tom Baker when he ran Sonny Boy about a year and when he moved on the corner of Oak Hill Road I worked one night and my boyfriend made me quit. I also worked at Brown Bluff and Macks on Highway West 80 one night. Then I went to Palm Beach and worked eight years. Then I quit and wernt to Fort Lee, Virginia with my husband. I also worked in Prathers Grocery on Highway 90 four years, and went back to Palm Beach and worked seven more years.\n\nI lived in Ferguson 11 years. My son went there. I know Barbara and Sandra Meece, and Jim Williams.\n\n256 Was There Barbara is married to Eddie Schoolcraft and Sandra and Buddy are both dead. 257 I Remember How long has Buddy been dead? Do you remember that terrible car accident he was in with the two Blevins brothers? Alan was killed. I remember that like it was yesterday. Alan would come to my house and hang out. Sometimes Buddy was with him. Alan's Dad was a preacher. I think that was the first time I realized death came to the young as well as the old. Buddy's leg was messed up really bad. He was never the same after that. 258 Sunshine Red Fox : The older brother's name was Ray. Graduated in '56. Also played ball. 259 Was There Buddy wrecked out at Nancy about two years ago. It killed him instantly. He and I used to date sisters out at Faubush about 40 years ago. 260 Sunshine I remember Barbara had a crush on Charlie Durham way back when. Does anybody remember him and what happened to him? 261 Red Fox I remember Charlie. He had an older brother Ronnie who got killed in service. I never knew what happened to Charlie. They lived across from Fred Clark. Remember the Sharpe Brothers? Their Dad was preacher at the Methodist church. 262 Sunshine I think Ronnie married a Shelton girl. Their mother ran a restaurant on the corner of 90 and 27. As for the Sharpe brothers, I only remember J.D. He was older than me. And I remember Fred & Myrtle. They were related to a good friend of mine. 263 Red Fox Mary Eva was the mother's name. She married Bill Simpson. They were fine people. 264 Knowitall9 Ronnie was killed in Vietnam. Erval Bray was killed there in July /67. 265 Red Fox Remember Norman Gover across from church. Shadoans lived there by the Govers. 266 Knowitall9 Bill & Mary Eva lived at either 519 or 515 Jacksboro. Either Charlie or Ronnie had a '63 or '64 red Ford Galaxie or Fairlane. It took a curve past the Lier Siegler Building too fast, rode the bank a long way, centered a stump, took out front cross member oil pan and the transmission and doubled the drive shaft. It was a beautiful car but that wreck tore it to pieces. 267 Blondie I went to school with Bill and Bonnie Simpson. They used to live around Bronston in their early years. Their Dad's name was Jessie. I believe Mary Eva had a daughter who married a Hislope. They lived in Jerry and Wilma's rent house on Murphy. Didn't Bill Simpson's Dad run The Shamrock at one tme? 268 Sunshine I don't know about Ronnie, but Charlie drove crazy. He had a black or dark blue Chevy with very loud pipes. I remember when his Dad got killed. I remember the adults talking about how bad the car was tore up. They were related to Mke and Norma Galloway. I think that daughter you mentioned was named Trulane. 269 Knowitall9 Bill, for a time, had the Chevron station where you turn into the hospital. 270 Red Fox Bill's dad ran The Shamrock, then Bill took it over in latter years. I worked for them. It was located on Monticello just before you turn to go to Walmart across from the storage buildings. It used to be a big hangout. There was a restaurant and truck stop. 271 Remember When Who remembers the Sugar Shack? 272 Red Fox Trulane married James Hislope from Slate Branch. He used to run around with Leroy Hartgrove. 273 Blondie It was Truelane, and she had a son named willie. He ran with my son when they were about 12. The Shamrock was on the old 27 across from Somerset Village Apartments. It really was a hangout like the old Greyhound Inn. 274 Knowitall9 Ain't got nothin to do with Ferguson, but who remembers the concrete igloo that used to sit on 27 where Lee's Famous Recipe is now? 275 Sunshine Red Fox : I remember both families. Good people. I remember Norman walking his dog down the street to the post office and store. Does anyone remember the Family Drive In theatre on 27? As for the igloo, what was in it? 276 Red Fox I remember the igloo. We used to go over there and buy ice cream. Then it changed to a fish place. How about the A & W Root Beer down on the corner by Cumberland Appliance? Big cold mug of Root Beer for 25 cents. 277 I Remember Some of this must have been before my time. Or I'm losing my memory. Does anyone remember David Hall when he would sell Christmas trees each year for 50 cents. David would come around and take orders. They were always cedar trees and smelled so good. And who remembers the Jewel Tea Man? And the Charlie Chip Man? And the Blanket Man? 278 Red Fox Remember Harry W. having a barber shop on top of the hill. Used to cut my hair for 50 cents. 279 Blondie I remember Harry. He never cut my hair but I have seen people who did get a hair cut from him and you talk about cussing they did it. Does anybody remember the old Peggy Ann Restaurant and motel? Located on old 27 on the corner where you turn down to go to Waitsboro Park. I think it burned. 280 Sunshine People who lived around that drive in complained the lights kept them awake. I remember Harry, too. Is he still alive? Must be 90 or more. One year he raised his price due to the increase in the price of peanut butter and pinto beans. When Harry cut your hair you didn't need another haircut for about six months. He cut my father in law's hair. Does anyone remember Mr. Dill? Wore overalls and sold \"Grit\" newspapers. Lived on Jacksboro. Had a wreath on the door all the time. I thought someone died. My Mom would buy a paper from him every week and if she didn't get one, bright and early on Sunday morning, he would be banging on the door to bring it to her. One day, he yelled at her from across the street and everyone was looking and I ducked in a store. 281 Knowitall9 I remember very well David selling trees. I can't recall the Jewel Tea man's name---maybe Burton? The Charlies Chips man was Hamp Kelley. His Mom lived in front of mine. I think the blanket man's name was Shelton. He sold blankets, pillows, sheets and pillow cases. He'd collect weekly or monthly. The Somerset Oil Station was on the south bound side of 27 and 90. Ed Holsomback worked there for years. He's dead now. I told Tommy they should have buried his Dad in his green work clothes because nobody ever saw him in a suit. There was also a restaurant across the intersection, the 27-90-1247 junction. 282 Blondie Bob Grider ran that restaurant but I don't know if he owned it. Bob also ran the restaurant at the corner of Oak Hill Road across from where Tom's Drive In went in, but tom's Drive In wasn't there when Bob ran that restaurant. 283 Knowitall9 Harry is still very much alive. He finally got a newer car two years ago. The last time he cut my hair there came a lightning storm and halfway through my haircut he said he had to turn the clippers off. I paid him a dollar and went to Homer Campbell to get it finished. 284 Red Fox Homer Campbell used to cut my hair. 285 Knowitall9 Back then you got a real good hair cut for $1.50. 286 Red Fox I seem to remember a Flynn and a Godby that cut hair also. 287 Knowsmore Bob Garner had a barber shop by Dottie's restaurant. He was also a preacher. 288 Sunshine Who ran Dottie's Restaurant? Was it Dottie Roney? 289 Red Fox Yes, it was Dottie Roney. She used to have a ball park at Norwood. 290 Blondie Does anyone remember Helen Ford working down there? I think she worked there for a long time. 291 Sunshine I remember Helen and her kids Dickie, Bill Ed and Betty. She lived by the garage on the corner that was a gas station at one time. 292 Knowitall9 Helen also had a son named Bobby. He retired from the Ky Department of Highways. He could drink more beer than I could even think about. He's dead now. 293 Blondie I think Helen had another daughter named Dreda. I think she married Jim Groves or maybe it was Jim Gross. 294 Red Fox Blondie you are right. Dreda was a real pretty black haired girl. Anybody know whatever happened to Marcus Cheney on Gover Lane? 295 Knowslittle He's a veterinarian in Florida. 296 Knowitall9 Dreda did marry Jim Gross. She's dead now, too. 297 Thanks It is so nice to be able to drop in here and eavesdrop on the memories. Please keep this thread going. Thank you. 298 Interested I agree. I didn't go to Ferguson but remember many of the people and places that have been mentioned. I enjoyed the good times. 299 Knowitall9 We haven't even scratched the surface. Especially if some new people join us. 230 Red Fox Does anyone remember going sled riding out on Gover Lane? I believe it was on the old Haney Farm. 231 Sunshine I rermember the farm and Marsha but I never went sledriding there. The only place I ever went sledriding was on Newton. We would start at the top and cross Murphy and end up on Jacksboro. Also we used to go tubing over on Fred Clark's farm by the graveyard. We burnt so many tires and it made such a mess he made us quit. 232 Red Fox Is anyone going to the 100th year celebration at the Baptist Church? 233 Blondie Is that tomorrow? I used to go there when Glen Singleton was pastor. Does anybody remember him? 234 I Remember\n\nI remember Brother Prather. I think he was right before Brother Singleton. Brother Prather would say the benediction than make a bee line outside to smoke. Some of the men would stay after church just talking to Brother Prather. I remember he was there for a long time. Does anyone remember the Cheneys? Vivian Cheney played the piano at the Baptist Church. They were somehow connected to the Fords.\n\nI saw Barbara Meece today. We were talking about this Topix thread. Barbara is four years older than me but I have to tell you she looks great. Wish I looked half as good.\n\n235 Knowslittle I didn't go to church there, but I remember the Cheneys. Vivian worked at the post office some, and I remember seeing her ride a bicycle. Her posture was straight as an arrow. She was a real lady. Her maiden name was Ford. She and Bob Ford were brother and sister. She has been dead for several years now, but as far as I know, Bob still plays the organ at Ferguson when he's able. He has had some health problems the past few years. 236 Blondie I remember Vivian Cheney. She was related to the Fords. Very nice lady. She always dressed nice and her hair always looked nice. 237 Sunshine For some unknown reason, I started dating at 14, and started car dating at 15. I did have a curfew. It was 11. One night we had two flat tires and it was midnight. I was in big trouble. 238 Knowitall9 Who in the world hasn't used that old flat tire excuse or the run out of gas excuse? 239 Red Fox I remember the Prathers. Ardith married Margaret Sexton. I remember Dwight's 1956 Olds rolling into the lake. 240 Sunshine I went to church when the Prathers were there. I remember when Ardith and Margaret got married. I went to their household shower. I loved Mrs. Prathers. She was my Sunday School teacher. 241 Knowslittle I went to the Baptist Church 10 Year Celebration. 242 Sunshine Me, too. I saw a lot of people I hadn't seen in a long time. Lots of food, too. Larry Ford was there. I found out Helen Smith, the home ec teacher, passed away last week. Reba said she was at the annual school reunion just last month. 243 I Remember In my opinion the reason there was no trouble in school or at home when we were growing up was because we knew we'd get beat. My Mom used a switch on my legs and after a couple of those times I didn't want any more. Also at school you knew you'd get your hind end beat off. We were good kids and most of us turned out to be decent human beings. I say bring back the paddles and switches. Sorry for rambling on but I'm mad because my grandson has just been missing for three days and it turns out he was at his girlfriend's house all that time. I was at the Baptist Church too. 244 Sunshine I didn't see you. Or maybe it's been so long I didn't recognize you. 245 I Remember I didn't stay long. I have a heart condition. When I get in public my heart rate and blood pressure go sky high. I didn't stay for dinner. I went to my best friend's house. She lives just up from the church on Jacksboro Street. I couldn't believe all the people there. I remember going to potluck dinners and they would be in the basement. Yesterday they had tents outside. My maiden name was Atchley. 246 Sunshine Sorry about your heart condition. I have a pic of you at one of your birthday parties. I think you're around six. 247 I Remember I remember that!! That was the only birthday party I ever had. I remember one girl who had a little white hat on. Was that you? I remember Beverly Ard. I haven't seen her in years. I wonder whatever happened to her. I remember getting modelling clay for a present at that party and not knowing what it was. I took a bite of it and discovered it was not edible. My Mom took it away and never would give it back. 248 Sunshine I think the girl in the white hat was Beverly Ard. I don't know whatever happened to her. I don't know who took this pic. I had several birthday parties but cameras must not have been invented because I don't have any pics. There were some boys at one of them. Someone got me panties and all the boys laughed and I was embarassed. 249 I Remember The girls I think are in that picture are Margaret Tucker, Judy Burton, Bevery Ard, Patty Muse, Peggy Lovins and my cousin DeeDee. There were 13 girls including me. 250 Sunshine I have two pics. In one of them, back row : Sandra Denney, Margaret Tucker, Joyce Godby, Jennie Beasley, Peggy Lovins, Brenda Haney, Marla Cooper. Front row : Beverly Ard (with white hat), Gay Haney, Cheryl, don't know next girl, Nancy Atchley, Judy Burton, don't know girl on end, little blonde haired girl, and a baby. There are 17 counting the baby. The other pic has Margaret on one end and Gay is beside Beverly. There are 14. 251 I Remember I don't remember Brenda Haney or Gay Haney or Jeannie Beasley. The girl with the curly hair and black vest was Lamonta Sewell. She lived across from Margaret, next to Hunts. I only have one pic and there's no baby in it. This is so strange you have more pictures of my birthday party 52 years ago than I do. I'm looking at this picture and wondering how many of us would like to go back to that very day and start life over from there. I would be first in line. 252 Sunshine Does anyone remember where the girls locker room was next to the lunchroom? Then it became the teacher's lounge, and eventually a classroom. One time me and a friend decided to cut class and we hid out in a little space off that room. You had to crawl into a little space. Well, it was the last time we did that. We didn't realize it was right under the gym and the boys were practicing ball. Talk about a headache! 253 I Remember My best friend still lives in the same house she grew up in, although it's been remodelled. She asked me if I remembered doing silly things on Halloween. She was talking about soaping people's windows and turning over outhouses. I was not involved in it, but I remember kids egging people's cars, putting sugar in gas tanks and stuffing potatoes in car mufflers. Anybody else remember any of this? 254 Sunshine Brenda and Gay Haney lived next door from Marla Cooper. Jeannie Marie Beasley lived up by Sharlene Barnes on the north end of Waddle Street. As a matter of fact, she and her husband still live there with her mother, who is 91. I think it was my mother who took those birthday party pics. 255 I Remember Sometimes my memory is totally gone. I have Mitral Valve Stenosis and Dilated Cardiomyopathy and I think it must affect my memory. Were your Mom and my Mom friends? Is your Mom still alive? 256 Sunshine I'm so sorry about your heart condition. Yes, our Moms were friends, but no, my Mom isn't still alive. 257 Knowitall9 I have stuffed many, many taters in tail pipes. The next to last outhouse we turned over was poor old Mrs. Anderson's up behind your homeplace. The very last outhouse we turned over was down in Parnell. It was a trap. It was wrapped in primer cord and had a quarter stick of 40% dynamite rigged inside it. Obviously we weren't too bright not to notice something looked suspicious. It sure did blow up. After that we were too scared to ever turn over another outhouse. We also toilet papered some houses and cars and borrowed a few hubcaps. But never once and I or any of the guys I ran around with ever do the sugar/gas thing. We liked cars too much for that. 258 Sunshine One year about eight of us jammed into one car and drove around trying to find something mean to do. We cut down some trees across the road. I love Halloween! It lets me be someone I'm not. I used to always love parties and hayrides. It's still lots of fun. 259 Blondie Does anybody remember Pete and Thelma Waddle? I know Pete died but have no idea where Thelma is. One time we went to Florida with them and Sonny and Jimmy Denney. It was so cold down there we had to go out and buy long johns for the men to go fishing. 260 Sunshine I remember both of them. I don't know what happened to Thelma. I saw Travis in Russell Springs back in July. Jerry Lee was working at Air Flo and Terry was driving a semi truck. 261 Blondie Does anyone remember who ran that ice cream joint upon the west end of Murphy Avenue? I think they also sold hamburgers and chili. 262 Knowitall9 At that time it was Paul and Joyce Noble. Then maybe a Winchester lady had a restaurant there, then an elderly man and son Steve had a pizza joint there. Now it's a computer shop. I can still visualize every building from the square to the Crane plant. City Lumber, Chevron Station, Bulk Plant, Old Weddles Market, Dottie's, Leroys junk store, R C Plant, Godby's Market, Nobles Ice Cream, Sextons Salvage, Campbells Store, Gays Gas Station, Bryans Tire Shop, Junk Yard, Coal Yard, Doxall Gas, Rutherfords Car Lot, Duncan and Goff Monuments. 263 Sunshine Dang! You got a photographic memory! I sometimes miss the road to my house. 264 Red Fox Tom Wheeler had a junk store by the Chevron Station. A Texaco station on the other side toward Ferguson was run by Millard Muse. 265 Good Times Does anyone remember a guy named Walt Fulcher? 266 Red Fox He may have been older than us, but does anybody remember a boy in Ferguson drove a 1950 black Ford? Seems like he dated someone down there in 1957 and 1958. I think he ran around with Stanley Cooper. 267 Knowitall9 Erval Bray had a 49-51 Ford, black, fender skirts, fake tear drops. He died in Vietnam in July '67. But Ersie Baker and Frank Cooper also had 49-51 Fords. Those were popular cars.\n\n268\n\nI Remember I'm trying to remember my Mom's friends. Her best friend was Helen Galloway. Margie Lovins, Aleen Ard, and Willena Whitaker. I saw Willena yesterday. She is 82 and still gets around good. Still drives. 269 Big Sister I have a bunch of pictures if I could figure out how to get them to you. 270 I Remember Knowitall9, was you one of us who on Devils Night 1965 went down somewhere off Cabin Hollow Road, everyone used to go down there turn off on a side road and cross a wooden bridge and park on the other side. Don Minton had a chain saw and he sawed through the planks on the bridge so none of us could get back across. I remember Larry Duncan, Margaret Tucker, Sharon Denny, Malcolm Luttrell, John Gallagher and a few others. We all had to hike home along the train tracks. There were a lot of curfews broken that night. I got the Ultimate Ass Beating From Hell. That was the last time I was ever allowed to go out on Devils Night. 271 Knowitall9 There's a real possibility I was there. 272 Sunshine How did you eventually get the cars home? 273 Knowitall9 By 1966 Roses was open over in Tradewinds. A bunch of idiots drove through there at midnight and stole a four column bubble gum machine. There were four guys in a Corvair, one of them quite tall. Somehow we got that big machine into that little car and took it to a creekbed in Elihu, where we broke it open. But it had no money. Just a heck of a lot of gum. We should have taken a machine that was almost empty. Less gum, more money. The police were sitting there the whole time and never caught on. 274 Sunshine I'm getting addicted to this Topix thread. I find myself checking the computer everytime I pass through the house to see if anyone has written anything. 275 Knowitall9 There was another little bridge that crossed the creek and hit Parkers Mill Road. We set it on fire once. It's amazing how many things we did back then were so funny and now they seem incredibly stupid. 276 Red Fox I used to go down beside the bridge on Parkers Mill and wash my car. Something in the water really made it shine. 277 Blondie Does anybody remember Manuel, the boy who used to ride his bike in Ferguson who was crippled and couldn't talk plain. I don't think they ever did find out who hit him over on 27 by Quality Court Motel. 278 Red Fox Remember where we used to go skinny dipping in Pitman Creek? I don't think the girls ever went. 279 I Remember There wasn't any upper class among any of us in Ferguson. We were all poor. Margaret Tucker appeared to have more than the rest of us because her Mom could sew anything. Most of Margaret's clothes were homemade but you couldn't tell. I have worn many of her hand me downs. I'm not sure who all the people are on here, but I think the ones around our age all turned out fairly well. I haven't heard of anyone that grew up in Ferguson back in our time getting in any trouble. Times were way different then. We were taught manners, responsibility, and to appreciate what little we had. I have really enjoyed this thread. I had taken me back home for a time. I really appreciate the fact there has been no ugly stuff posted. I'll bet this is a first for Topix. 280 Sunshine We used to wash our cars down there, too. Whatever boy I was dating at the time would take his car down there Sunday afternoons. I was always told the refinery emptied into it and the oil made the cars shine. 281 Knowitall9 My sisters also wore all homemade clothes. I was very proud of my two pair of pants. When I went to the army, they gave me two pair of boots, one pair of pants, four pair of socks and four t shirts. That was more clothes than I'd ever had at one time. 282 Sunshine Cecil and Russell Goff lived out past that bridge. I went to a party out there once a long time ago. 283 Knowitall9 Red Fox --- Bert Ping took us guys skinny dipping down on Pitman Creek after weight training. Girls would have been welcome but none ever came. 284 Red Fox Does any one remember the robinsons who lived in Ferguson? They lived on a street across from Hunts. There was a mother and three daughters. 285 Blondie I believe Red Fox is Larry Duncan. 286 Sunshine I don't think so. Larry is younger than me. Red Fox seems to know more about the older crowd. 287 Red Fox Do you remember riding the buses? I remember the drivers being Garner Rash, Herman Hudson, Cecil Burton, Ed Girdler, Wormy Phelps, John Gallagher's father, R. T. Ard and Dewey Baker. They ran out of Legrande Garage. 288 Knowitall9 Dewey lived on the 300 block of Jacksboro. the little house that sits back on a rise behind the Paul and Larry Stephens homeplace. Dewey always had a Buick. 289 Blondie Do you all remember when Lonnie Harness got hurt? 290 Knowitall9 My Dad drove a bus for Short Way Lines. He drove to somewhere in Tennessee and hauled a lot of recruits to Fort Knox. 291 Red Fox Whatever happened to Dottie Cowan and her kids? 292 Knowslittle Dottie sold her home in Ferguson and bought a condo on north 1247, possibly Saddlebrook. One of her daughters is in Somerset, one child is in Georgia, one may be in Louisville, not sure about the others. 293 Red Fox Does anybody know the Hamms : Bill, Jack, Bobby, Barbara? 294 Sunshine I remember all of them. Bill, Jack and Bob (all deceased). I know Barbara married a Cox boy and moved away. Do you remember when Bill was dating Shirley Colyer? And do you remember Betty Vaughn and Tooter Ping? 295 Red Fox Yes, I remember Bill and Shirley. I can remember Betty but not Tooter. 296 Knowslittle Tooter is married to Bunt Phelps, Betty is married to Charles Wallace. 297 Sunshine I think they graduated in 57. Also Bill Hamm and Stanley Cooper. Does anybody remember Red Sears? Played ball for a while. I think he married Sammy and Casey Bell's sister, but I think they are divorced. I don't know what happened to him. 298 Red Fox Do you remember Glen Canada and Max Lay? 299 Sunshine I remember Max Lay. I can't place Glen Canada but the name seems familiar. Did he have a sister? Do you remember Phillip Hancock? He didn't graduate. He moved to Ohio. He went with Peggy Cope for a while. 300 Red Fox Glen had some sisters but I don't remember their names. I remember Phillip and Peggy Cope. 301 Sunshine In my '59 yearbook there's a pic of typing class with Peggy Sears, Darlene Malden, Lida Jones and Carolyn Jones. Do you remember Bobby Sears? He passed away a couple of weeks ago. I think he drove a truck. 302 Red Fox I don't remember him but I do remember those girls. Do you remember Pearl Hardwick? I used to see her sister Mary once in a while but now I haven't seen her in several years. 303 Sunshine Yes, I remember them. Pearl didn't live here. I saw her a few years ago at the Dollar Store. I think she comes in and visits Mary. I haven't seen Mary for a while either. She did run the Dollar Store by the Food Lion. I think she married a Tucker the last time. 304 Red Fox What good old days we had. I just love to talk about them. 305 Sunshine Yes. Have you been to any of the reunions at Ferguson? I haven't been in years, but this thread makes me want to go again. 306 Red Fox I have never been to a reunion. 307 I Remember Sunshine : I received the photos you sent . Thank you very much. I would never have known who you were if you had not written the last line. I laughed as I remembered those days. I've been at the hospital all week. My friend had a knee replacement. Who on here remembers the Marrow sisters? There was Mary and Mattie and a third one whose name I forget. Redfox : Do you have a sister who graduated in 1968? 308 Sunshine Since you hadn't been on here lately, I was beginning to worry. Hope your friend is doing well. When I told my daughter was I was going to write, she said, \"Mom! Everyone on there will know who you are!\" LOL. That's true! Glad you got them. It is so hard to imagine that so much time has gone by. Yes, I remember Mary and Mattie. Mary got killed in a car wreck several years ago. Mattie has had breast cancer, but I saw her not long ago at a gospel singing. I don't remember the other one's name, either. 309 Blondie9 Well, we were in Lexington today. It was our anniversary, so I wanted to eat there, but we ended up at the Stanford Dairy Queen. Now he wants to go to Golden Corral here in Somerset. I'm not going. I wanted to eat in Lexington. 310 Knowitall9 Blondie : Correction. He was in the class of 1961. 311 I Remember When we were in school, who would have thought that someone would invent the computer and we would spend our golden years talking back and forth on it. I never dreamed of such a machine and I would have no way believed I would have been using it. I barely passed typing. It's great that we can carry on this conversation. I wonder if we were in the same room if it would this easy. 312 Knowitall9 Well, this could be a sincere and monumental reunion, with a good pot of coffee, a pack of smokes, a comfortable chair, and a lot of great memories. But --- here, between posts, we have the chance to look up photos, browse through yearbooks, find old newspaper clippings, and think on things overnight. So in a way this is a more in depth conversation than we could have in one long afternoon in the same room. 313 Red Fox No, I didn't have a sister graduate in 1968. 314 Knowslittle You are right. I'm only on here at night. I work during the day and can't get on. Like I said, I didn't go to Ferguson, but I have several friends who did. I love hearing the stories about Ferguson as I know quite a few people from there. 315 Red Fox We'll have to have a guessing game to figure out who is who on here. 316 Knowslittle Red Fox, are you a Ferguson Warhorse? What year? 317 Sunshine Knowslittle, did your husband loan his Chevy pickup to a group of teens to go to Barrn River sometimes in the early 1980s? 318 I Remember Redfox, do you have a brother named Eddie? 319 Redfox No brother named Eddie. What is a Warhorse? 320 Sunshine Do you remember a girl named Linda Sue Tarter? Lived on Garrett Street where Carrie Baker lived across from the Denneys? Blondie9 : Happy Anniversary! No, I hardly ever read my emails anymore. I don't have time. This thread takes up all my spare time. As far as I know, Saturday night is on. Might need to take your umbrella and overcoat. Redfox : Are you SURE you went to Ferguson? 321 Knowsmore Redfox, if you went to Ferguson School you should be ashamed if you do not know what a Warhorse is. 322 Go Somerset Remember Carrie Baker? 323 Knowslittle Sunshine : No, my husband would never have loaned his pickup to a family member, much less a group of teens. I don't know what you're talking about. 324 Sunshine Go Somerset : Yes, I do, and her brothers Harold and Billy. She used to work for a doctor. Used to see her, but haven't seen her for a while. Knowslittle : Sorry I wasn't too clear on that. It wasn't just to a group of teens. It was to a church group. 325 Knowslittle His brother might have loaned the truck. He and his brother did not go to Ferguson either. Are you talking about someone who went to Ferguson School? Carrie still works for the doctor, and her sister in law (Billy's wife) works there, too. 326 Sunshine It was back in 1981. A local church took a group of teens to Barren River for a camping trip. They took two vans and a maroon Chevy truck with the tents and supplies and I drove it. I thought it might have been your husband's. Guess not. I didn't realize Billy lived here now. It's amazing how many people live here and I never see them out anywhere. I go to Walmart or somewhere and never see anyone I know. It's like I live in a strange town. 327 Knowslittle Was that the Baptist Church? I know there are people living here that I graduated with that I never seen. I did see Carrie not long ago at Cracker Barrel 328 Sunshine Yes! It was the Baptist Church. 329 Knowslittle I'll have to think about that. We didn't have a maroon truck that I remember. I don't recall that particular trip, either. 330 Sunshine Well, I know I went and drove that truck. With about 20 teenagers. It was a trip I will never forget. Like about 2 a.m. the boys were mooning the girls. Some church group. 331 Knowslittle I bet I could name some of those boys. Sounds like a blast. 332 Knowitall9 A full moon ? Was the Big Dipper or Uranus anywhere to be seen? 333 I Remember I don't remember Linda Sue Tarter. But then I don't remember girls in my own birthday photo. I swear my memory is really bad. 334 Sunshine I saw her just the other day. It was the first time I'd seen her in years and she lives here. She has had two heart attacks. She said her memory was bad, too. I told her about you and she said \"tell her to hang in there.\" She had a brother named Eddie. She said he passed away with Cancer a few years ago. 335 Redfox Was that the same Bakers that the older girl was Shirley? I remember she had a brother named Harold. 336 Redd Ryder Wow. Can't believe I found this board. I typed in \"Ferguson School\" and Google brought this up. What a neat trip down memory lane. I've read through all the posts. All of you seem to have been just a few years ahead of me in school. I was one of the last basketball players at Ferguson before the state closed the school. We never even got to finish our careers at Ferguson. On my team were me, Billy Brewster, Vernon Norris, Gene Burton, Dennis Whitaker, Eddie Tucker, Larry Burton, Jerry Holsonbach and Ronnie Yanders. One year ahead of us were David Carr, Doug Goff, Jimmy Strunk, Billy Denny, Darwin Minton, Larry Whitaker, and Shannon Hardwick. The varsity above that was seniors Larry Duncan, Jerry Peters and Don Minton, and juniors Eddie Bill Ping, Charlie Tucker, Jackie Linville and Mike Richardson. David Cowan saw the school was going to be closed so he left when his eight seniors (Malcolm Luttrell and that bunch) graduated. Our coach was Dan Omlor. He was a good coach who got there too late. None of the varsity players that 66-67 season had played varsity the year before and they were all too small and slow and couldn't shoot, so they had a poor season. But my team went undefeated and won the regional and got to the State Tournament championship game before Vernon got sick and we lost by 13. David Carr and his bunch went 22-5, won the region and got beat in the state tournament by Meyzeek, which was the junior high for Louisville Male. So for the next several years we were going to have some of the best teams in Ferguson history. Then the state shut us down. Vernon Norris and Billy Denny each had two older sisters. Barbara Flynn was editor of the school newspaper. Brenda New was the yearbook editor. I remember Nancy Atchley, an adorable redhead, Laura Shafer, who dropped out at the beginning of her senior year, Pam Duncan, and Eddie Tucker's older sister Margaret. 337 Sunshine Thank Goodness you found this thread because we have just about exhausted all of our resources. Maybe you can bring us back to life. Tell us some interesting events that happened during your time at Ferguson. 338 I Remember Welcome Aboard! Sounds like you are just full of information. Please please share with us. Knowitall9 is the most informed on here and I think he has now resorted to making stuff up. My memory is to bad I don't know if Knowitall9 is telling the truth or not. You and he should be able to share some great stories about Mr. Omlor. LOL. As I remember he and the coach had a lot to talk about. LOL. 339 Redd Ryder I've been fortunate since leaving Ferguson in that I've been lots of places and seen and done lots of things, but when thinking back to those days my memories always center around two things. The first is how none of us really had anything. We were all really poor. But since we were all about equal, we didn't know it. The Tuckers, Burtons and Duncans had a little more than the rest of us, but not enough to make them wealthy. So all we had was each other, and we had a great time. We all pretty much got along. The girls would argue over some guy, or the guys would fight over some girl, but that was about it, and those blew over pretty quick. Otherwise, we had a great time doing basically nothing with nothing. We rode our bikes everywhere: all over Somerset, down to the lake, out to fishing holes and camping spots and anywhere else. Most of our bikes were hand me downs, stripped down, with no fenders or chain covers. They weren't fancy narrow tire bikes like Somerset kids had. Ours had old balloon tires, fat seats, no gears. In the Summers we'd go swimming every day down at the Car Top. Remember the Car Top? It was a car that had somehow got down into the creek, which we never did figure out because there were trees and big rocks in its way. But there it was. We could jump off the roof of the car into the big swimming hole. We'd mostly just go skinny dippin. We didn't have money for fancy swim trunks. One day Vernon and I were going down for a swim and we heard some splashin and screamin and got quiet and snuk down real slow and peeked around some bushes and there was three girls down there skinny dippin. It was the first time we'd seen any girls except our own sisters totally naked. It was real educational. We knew if they saw us it would be trouble for the rest of our lives. How could we sit next to them in school or church ever again? So we kept real quiet and snuk back out of there. I still remember who it was, but it might be some of the people posting on here, so I won't ever tell. 340 Knowitall9 Those older sisters were Nancy and Olive Norris. Sandy and Sharon Denny. Welcome to this thread. You've named just about everyone I'm familiar with, so we must be close in age. By the way, did you say \"gorgeous red head\" ? Never heard her called a Red Head. 341 Redd Ryder My grandfaher was buddies with Herbert T. Higgins. I didn't like Mr. Higgins. I liked Mr.Overby a lot better. I always thought Mr. Higgins was more of an old fashioned politician, but Mr. Overby was more of an educator. I never thought Higgins even liked kids. My Dad was buddies with Ralph Duncan, who was then school board chairman and ran the tombstone company over on the bypass. So when David Cowan resigned after his eight seniors graduated and he saw a couple of losing seasons coming up, Mr. Higgins and Mr. Duncan told my grandfather and my Dad they wanted to use the opportunity to bring in a real topnotch coach. So they wrote Adolph Rupp at UK and asked him to send them someone. I thought this was just more Higgins talk. He was always talking about what he was going to do and never did most of it. But then one day Dad came home and said they had some guy who drove down for an interview and they thought they might be able to hire him. He was about to be drafted into the Army. So Higgins said he would write the draft board and tell them he needed this guy more than they did. Then o"
