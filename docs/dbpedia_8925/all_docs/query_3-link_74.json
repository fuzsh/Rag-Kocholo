        "text": "Candidate Q&A: Kyle Carter\n\nNote: This entry is part of a series of written Q&As with judicial candidates in contested Democratic primaries. I am also doing recorded interviews with non-judicial candidates.\n\n1: Who are you and what are you running for?\n\nMy name is Kyle Carter. I am a Democrat running for the 125th Civil District Court in Harris County Texas. My experience begins with having been a lifelong resident of Houston. I was born here in 1976 and have made this town my home for me and my family. I am the son of an attorney, who has mentored me and helped pass on the knowledge that an experienced lawyer can provide. My mother is a Methodist Minister, the Reverend Doctor Suzan Carter.\n\nGrowing up in Sharpstown, I attended Pat Neff Elementary and Sharpstown Middle School, before going to high school at Strake Jesuit College Preparatory, where I graduated in 1994. Next, I attended the University of Texas at Austin, graduating with a B.A. degree in Government in 1998. Finally, I attended South Texas College of Law, graduating in December, 2000. I passed the February, 2001 bar exam, and began practicing law in May, 2001.\n\nImmediately, I was given the task of being lead lawyer on a number of cases. Over the years, I have worked countless cases over the past six years, arguing countless motions. I have tried several jury cases, bench trials and administrative cases, all to verdict. I have represented a group of Lincoln Mercury Automobile dealers in a case before the Department of Transportation also involving Ford Motor Company. I have been general counsel to the State Committee on General Investigating and Ethics, as well as, General Counsel to the State Committee on Urban Affairs.\n\nI have also worked to with health care providers to insure the highest level of service, credentialing, reporting, and compliance. Most recently, I along with my law firm have been successfully taking on the Workers Compensation insurance companies before the State Office of Administrative Hearings, and the Travis County District Courts, regarding reimbursements that ultimately affect the ability of working people to have access to quality healthcare in Texas.\n\n2: What kind of cases does this court hear?\n\nThis Court hears civil cases. This Court does not hear criminal, family, or probate matters.\n\n3: Why are you running for this particular bench?\n\nI am running for the 125th Judicial District Court bench because I believe that the current Judge has lost its way. Having been instilled with the value of being a \"man for others\" and I believe that my duty is to serve the people of this community, not just the big business interests.\n\nThe current judge is a remnant of the George Bush governorship, as he was appointed by the then Governor in 1999. Further, this Judge has particularly low marks from the Houston Bar Association judicial poll, as completed by attorneys practicing in the Houston area.\n\nMy candidacy is going to change this. Harris County deserves better. I will be a Judge who is honest, has integrity, and is reasonable and fair. Harris County needs a Judge like me.\n\n4. What are your qualifications for this job?\n\nPlease see the response to Question 1 above.\n\nAdditionally, I am a member of the Houston Bar Association, the Houston Young Lawyers Association, the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, the Texas trial Lawyers Association, and Who's Who's International Historical Society.\n\nI believe in service to my community as I am a Freemason and a member of the Shrine of North America. I believe in philanthropy and have participated in the HBA Habitat for Humanity project, as well as, Operation Compassion, where I served food to people that were impacted by the Katrina disaster. Additionally, I am the only Democrat running in this race that has voted in a Democratic Primary.\n\nFinally, I am married and have two children that deserve the best, as all children do, and I am committed to making Houston, my hometown, the best place on earth to live and raise a family.\n\n5. Why is this race important?\n\nThis race is important because we need a Judge that is of the people, by the people, and for the people. Harris County has been mired in ethical complaints and other issue that has cost elected officials their credibility. I am running to restore this credibility. My experience with the Legislature and particularly the Committee on General Investigating and Ethics has shown me that very bad things can happen when people do not get involved. We need to all get involved with this election and insure that we have the right people elected for the job.\n\n6. Why should people vote for you in the Democratic primary?\n\nPeople should vote for me in the Harris County Democratic Primary because I am the only Democrat running. I am a loyal Democrat, and have been my entire life. I have been endorsed by Congressman Gene Green, and former State Democratic Party Chair, Charles Soechting.\n\nMy primary opponent is not a primary voter, and going back as far as 1996, my opponent has not participated in any Democratic primary election. Finally, my opponent has made a career as a defense lawyer for Wal-mart.\n\nWhile we all choose our paths in life, I believe that I better represent the Democratic constituency than my opponent. I have chosen a path, as an attorney, to fight insurance companies so that we can ultimately all have a better health care system in Texas. My goal is to become a Judge that is representative of not only Democrats, but of all working people and citizens of Harris County. This race is crucial to ending the rule of the Republican party, where might beats right, and I am the man for the job.\n\nFinally, I have lived in Houston my entire life. I was there on Richmond when the Rockets won it all, both times. I was there Enron collapsed and lots of innocent people lost their jobs and retirements. And finally, I was there to help provide assistance to those who lost their homes in Hurricane Katrina. I have been a proud Houstonian through it all, good times and bad. I have chosen to raise my family here and am dedicated to making Houston, and Harris County the best place to live, period. That is why I deserve your vote.\n\nPREVIOUSLY:\n\nJim Wrotenbery, candidate for 125th District Court (Civil).\n\nDiane Trautman, candidate for Harris County Tax Assessor.\n\nJudge Susan Criss, candidate for the Texas Supreme Court, Position 8.\n\nJoe Jaworski, candidate for State Senate, District 11.\n\nBaltasar D.
