        "text": "THIS IS OUR “TOYS FOR TOTS” CAMPAIGN REPORT FROM 2022 -- PRESERVED FOR ARCHIVAL PURPOSES\n\nGREEN BAY, Wis. (WBAY) - Yes, Wisconsin, there is a Santa Claus, and he lives in the generosity of every one of us. Make glad the heart of childhood by answering the call to help TOYS FOR TOTS so that boys and girls, infant to teen, will find a present under their tree this Christmas.\n\nThis year’s Toys for Tots drive is officially over with the end of LAST CALL in Green Bay and Appleton (though you might still find some boxes before they’re collected). The lobby of the WBAY Building is FULL except for some carefully spaced walkways through the toys, some piled waist high or higher!\n\nTHANK YOU to everyone who donated!\n\nThe response this year was heartwarming. All of these toys are going to children in our area who might not have gotten a toy under their tree for Christmas.\n\nThis is what it looked like after he pushed everything together and piled up the toys to get to the doors:\n\nWBAY-TV is proud to help the U.S. Marine Corps celebrate the 75th anniversary of TOYS FOR TOTS, a mission started by a Marine reservist in 1947.\n\nThis is the 18th year WBAY has hosted Last Call, a massive, one-day push to get those last-minute donations to collection points. Our partnership with the Marines started in 1988, and our first Last Call was in 2005.\n\nThe toys are distributed to children in the area where they’re donated … giving a child not just a gift under the tree but a message of hope and motivation to grow into responsible citizens and community leaders.\n\nThis year’s Toys for Tots drive began November 10. People were asked to donate new, unwrapped donations. Last Call was held at the WBAY Building, 115. S. Jefferson St., in downtown Green Bay and the Fox Communities Credit Union branch at 2201 E. Enterprise Ave., right off the I-41 Ballard Rd. exit. U.S. Marines were on-hand to provide curbside service from 6 in the morning until 8 at night. People didn’t even have to get out of their cars!\n\nTo say thank you, donors during Last Call received a 30% coupon for tickets to see the Harlem Globetrotters at the Resch Center in Ashwaubenon on Thursday, Dec. 29. The first 25 people to drop off toys at WBAY each received a pair of free tickets to the game.\n\nEach year the holidays are made brighter for children in our communities with the support of volunteers and the generosity of thousands in Northeast Wisconsin. Thank you in advance for bringing a smile to children’s faces on Christmas Day and creating memories.\n\nPlease patronize these local businesses that helped collect toys in 2022!\n\nAlgoma\n\nAlgoma Long-term Care, 1510 Fremont St.\n\nAutumn’s Journey Assisted Living, 500 Bay Rd.\n\nDairy Deans Family Restaurant, 824 4th St.\n\nDoor County Medical Center, 815 Jefferson St.\n\nFish Tale Ale House, 530 4th St.\n\nRichmond Center, 305 Steele St.\n\nSeiler Tire, 1404 Jefferson St.\n\nSt. Paul’s School, 1115 Division St.\n\nTrue Value, 521 4th St.\n\nAllouez\n\nOlejneczak Realty, 375 W.

Donations will go around the tree in the WBAY Building lobby before being distributed by the U.S. Marines and Salvation Army. Shop online at any store you choose and have the toys shipped to us:\n\nWBAY-TV\n\nAttn: Toys for Tots\n\n115 S. Jefferson St.\n\nGreen Bay, WI 54301\n\nIf the store only gives you one line for the recipient, please use “WBAY Attn Toys for Tots” or something similar. Toys sent to us will be distributed in the greater Green Bay area.\n\nHow Toys for Tots began\n\nIn 1947, the wife of a U.S. Marine Corps reservist handcrafted a doll and asked her husband to take it to an organization that would give it to a needy child for Christmas. Major (later Colonel) Bill Hendricks couldn’t find one, so at his wife’s urging and a group of Marine Reservists in Los Angeles started one. It was so successful, the Marine Corps adopted it in 1948 and it spread to Marine Corps Reserve units nationwide and received publicity from Hollywood celebrities (it didn’t hurt that Hendricks’s weekday job was head of Public Relations for Warner Brothers Studio).\n\nIn 1948, animator Walt Disney designed the Toys for Tots logo still in use today.\n\nStarting in 1980, Toys for Tots began accepting only new toys. Three things precipitated this move: 1) Changes in defense that required more training for Marine Reservists, so they had less time to refurbish used toys; 2) Growing public awareness of safety and health issues with older toys; 3) A feeling that giving hand-me-down toys didn’t give underprivileged children the message Marines wanted to send them on Christmas Day.\n\nIn 1991, acting on U.S. Secretary of Defense authorization, the Marine Toys for Tots Foundation was created to be the fund-raising and support arm of the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve Toys for Tots Program.\n\nIn 1995, the Secretary of Defense declared toys for Tots an official activity of the Marine Corps and official mission of the Marine Corps Reserve.\n\nToys for Tots has been named Readers Digest’s “Best Children’s Charity”; met all 20 standards for the Better Business Bureau Wise Giving Alliance; and for years has received Charity Navigator’s highest rating, four stars, for its sound fiscal management."
