        "text": "Obituaries\n\nWes Tutchings '61, the face of financial aid at Kenyon for many alumni, dies at sixty-three\n\nLong-time Kenyon administrator P. Wesley Tutchings '61, the face of financial aid at the College for generations of students and their families, died Thursday, December 12, 2002, after a brief illness. He was sixty-three and a resident of Norwalk, Ohio.\n\nBorn in Norwalk on August 27, 1939, a son of Maxine Jacobs Tutchings and Paul R. Tutchings, Wes graduated from Norwalk High School in 1957 and entered Kenyon in the fall of that year as a member of the Class of 1961. As a student at the College, he was a member of Beta Theta Pi, the football and wrestling teams, and Student Council. During his senior year, Wes served as president of the Student Assembly.\n\nFollowing graduation, Wes took a teaching position at Western Reserve High School near Wakeman, Ohio. Two years later, in 1963, he moved to Norwalk Junior High School in his hometown. In 1964, Wes returned to Kenyon, serving first as a member of the admissions staff and then as an assistant director of admissions. He soon took on the duties of financial-aid director as well, holding the titles of director of scholarships and student aid and director of student employment for many years. In his almost three decades of distributing scholarship funds, Wes saw the College's financial-aid budget increase from less than $500,000 to more than $3.5 million.\n\nWes retired in November 1990, after more than twenty-six years at Kenyon. The previous year had been a difficult one for him, with the death of his father and an uncle and health problems of his own, brought on in part by the stresses of his job, and he decided it was time to leave the post with which he had been so closely identified. In his letter of resignation, Wes cited his \"declining degree of personal and professional satisfaction\" and noted that he hoped to \"devote time to family concerns and explore other professional opportunities.\"\n\nThe abrupt departure took many at the College by surprise. Former Dean of Admissions and Financial Aid John W. Anderson, who accepted Wes's resignation with \"deep regret,\" called him a \"mainstay of Kenyon's admissions and financial-aid operations\" and said that \"his diligence, his wit, and most of all his knowledge will be sorely missed.\" Former President Philip H. Jordan Jr. summed up Wes's distinguished career in one sentence: \"Despite the restrictions imposed by the College's limited financial-aid budget, Wes labored mightily and quite successfully to meet the demands of an exacting personal tenet: No qualified student should be denied a Kenyon education for financial reasons.\"\n\nAfter leaving the College, Wes worked at a market in Norwalk and at Huron County Services for the Aging. To the dismay of his many friends in Gambier, he failed to maintain ties even to those with whom he was closest. \"Have you heard anything about Wes?\" became a common refrain whenever his old friends met; any bit of news about him was eagerly received. The news of his death, from pneumonia, was greeted with real sadness and the sense, once again, of a great loss.\n\n\"As a prospective college student, as a student at Kenyon, as his colleague on the administrative staff, and most especially as his friend, I had the pleasure of getting to know Wes well over the years,\" says Donald J. Omahan '70, the College's dean of students. \"At each point along the road, Wes was an extremely kind, considerate, and caring person. He was always willing to give of his time to others; you could always count on Wes to be there to lend a hand, offer an ear, or give good advice. No matter what the circumstances, you could always look forward to Wes's smile, to his wonderful sense of humor, to his knowing looks. So many of us will be forever indebted to Wes for what he gave to us and to Kenyon.\"\n\nWes is survived by a brother, Terry Tutchings; a sister, Sondra Schoenegge; and several nieces and nephews, including Donna Schoenegge Norfolk '78 and Paul W. Schoenegge '79.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made to Kenyon College in care of the Office of Development, College Relations Center, Gambier, Ohio 43022-9623.\n\nFormer trustee David Jasper '38 dies at eighty-six\n\nDavid Westwater Jasper Jr. '38 H'83, trustee emeritus and long-time benefactor and volunteer, died January 11, 2003, at the age of eighty-six.

His interest in health-care issues led him to take volunteer leadership roles with the Central New York Health Planning Agency, Community Health Information and Planning Services, the New York State Health Planning Council Advisory Board, and Syracuse Community General Hospital.\n\nIn 1962, Sports Illustrated presented Dave with a Silver Anniversary All-American Award in football in recognition of his accomplishments in college and during his subsequent career. The selection committee wrote to Dave, \"You have done and continue to do your chosen work quietly and well.\" Among the others honored that year was U.S. Supreme Court Justice Byron \"Whizzer\" White, who played college football at the University of Colorado.\n\nDave won election to the College's Board of Trustees as an alumni trustee in 1967. After his second three-year term ended in 1974, he became a trustee at-large until his retirement from the board in 1980. Dave also served as president of the Kenyon Alumni Association of Central New York in 1962, as a member of Alumni Council, and for many years as agent for the Class of 1938.\n\nAt Honors Day in 1983, the College conferred on Dave an honorary doctor of laws degree in recognition of \"a life of achievement.\" The citation for the degree noted, \"You illustrate so well the ideal of liberal education that the College might well be accused of fabrication if the evidence were not so clear.\"\n\nDave is survived by his wife of sixty-one years, Eleanor Osborn Jasper; two daughters, Sara Jasper Cook and Mary Jasper Walter; two sons, David W. Jasper III and Kenneth Jasper; eleven grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.
