        "text": "The first MSU graduate thesis was submitted in 1968. Since then over 3,600 theses have been submitted as part of graduate work at MSU.\n\nSince the fall of 2008 graduate students have been required to submit their thesis in electronic form. Online access to most theses from 2008 to the summer of 2015 is available only on campus. Print copies of all theses up to summer 2018 are available in Meyer Library and in most cases through inter-library loan.\n\nDid you submit a thesis as part of your graduate studies at MSU before 2015? If you would like to see the text of your thesis on this site please contact BearWorks@missouristate.edu"
