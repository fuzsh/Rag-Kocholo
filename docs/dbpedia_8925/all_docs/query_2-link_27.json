        "text": "In September, Judge will come to Europe for eight dates and bring the Hardcore Supergroup World Be Free as a special guest.\n\nWhen Judge reappeared in 2013, the excitement was great. Two sold-out concerts in their hometown of New York kicked off the comeback of one of the most influential hardcore bands of all time. The band around vocalist Mike Ferraro had broken up 22 years earlier to the climax of their success. At the end of the 80s, they had neo-punk, supplemented by the novel use of metallic crunch sounds and shaped the music direction sustainable. The impressive story of Judge was recorded in 2015 in the NOISEYdocumentary \" There Will Be Quiet - The Story Of Judge \".\n\nIn their live shows, the music unfolds its full force and makes for energetic performances, in which the entire audience is put into a euphoric mood. The tour will be opened by World Be Free , who are performing for the first time in Europe. The supergroup, which was founded in 2015, is made up of Joe Garlipp ( Envy ), Arthur Smilios ( Gorilla Biscuits ) Scott Vogel ( Terror ), Andrew Kline ( Strife ) and Judgesdrummer Sammy Siegler.\n\nSupport from World Be Free\n\nPresented by CMH Live and Sakari Empire"
