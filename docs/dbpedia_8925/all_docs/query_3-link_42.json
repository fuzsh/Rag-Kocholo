        "text": "There's been a lot of talk about #GreenBiz24 and how GreenBiz Group conferences have changed (and are still very much evolving along with our space). For me personally, it has become a different place entirely. In the spirit of vulnerability, I shared a personal reflection on my journey from feeling like an outsider to finally feeling like I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be üò´ https://lnkd.in/gGQxUg_5 THANK YOU everyone who made the conference feel like home this year, especially: üêù My dream team: Britt Boza, Erica Chan Glueck (who led a fascinating panel on #carboncredits) and my better half at qb. consulting, Sam Hartsock üíô + former üêùs Monica Baron, Megan Yousef and Lis Best who are still very much a part of our little collective. üôèüèΩ Our amazing clients, partners, friends and ‚ú® qb. community, including: Simone Wren, Erin Dieterich, Heather K. Mak (È∫•Á©éËéú), Robbie Lock, Dylan Siegler, John Kim, Jenny Robertson, Melissa Cantarow, Taylor Price, Mike Schwartz, Keara Fanning, Hannah Erickson, Charlie Reed, Whitney Reyes, Daniel Strechay, Anuraag Jhawar, Stephanie C√°rdenas, Nate Shepley Streed, Shannon Houde, MBA, PCC, Ting Lee + more in comments because I got cut off üôà. To everyone new I met: please don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out, whether you're curious about entrepreneurship, being a #workingmom, jobs in the space or are in need of üåµ #ESG/ #impact / #sustainability #reporting, #stakeholderengagement or #strategy support. SO. MANY. people helped me along the way; I'm always happy to chat. #womenownedbusiness\n\nWhat actually happens at a GreenTech Gathering? üå± Here are 3 things you need to know about us: üíö We're a relaxed and informal space for building real connections with other GreenTech professionals - this means no sales and no cards! üíö We'll ALWAYS use this platform to support the growth of our community. At each event, we invite two speakers to take the stage: an industry leader and a community spotlight. This is an opportunity to share knowledge and insight into local initiatives and innovations. üíö We get it‚Äînetworking events often revolve around alcohol. At GreenTech Gathering, inclusivity is everything. That's why we'll ALWAYS have plenty of soft drinks on hand. Have dietary needs? Just let us know at hello@greentechgathering.co.uk‚Äîwe'll go the extra mile to accommodate you. Any other questions, we're here to help! #sustainability #greentech #networking\n\nToday, I'm at The Business Show with my business buddy Sally Pearce and we're looking forward to what the day will bring. It's a two day event but we're going to pack a lot into just today - Thursday! There are lots of interesting speakers and seminars and when we went last year, we took in a lot of information. We really enjoyed being part of it as participants. Why go? Apart from the fact it's free, you meet lots of interesting people. You learn new things. You get some fantastic tips. You learn about a lot of things you've never thought about or never used before. You gain sore feet by the end but it's worth it! The show also talks about sustainability, and there's an area called Sustainability Zone that helps SME and startup owners to measure, monitor and report on the environmental impact of their processes, making their businesses greener. To me - this is really important. The more you can give back, improve on the impact you have, even as an individual solo business owner, is essential. I think it should be part of our mantra as business owners. There is so much to find out about at the show, I hope to capture as much of it as possible. Let me know if you're going to be there too! #thebusinessshow2023 #businessinspiration #networking #businessideas #copywriteratlarge\n\nThe world is on fire, let me fly to another conference. Am I wasting my time on conferences? On speaking? Does it change anything? I‚Äôve spent more than a decade touring the world (gosh +80 countries ‚Ä¶tons and tons of CO2) and observing the shift from CSR, sustainability, impact to regeneration, but has anything really changed besides giving old bottles new labels? Yes, people might be inspired in the moment, but when they‚Äôre back at their deck Monday morning, isn‚Äôt it just business-as-usual? Yet, we need climate action now and I have this strange feeling I‚Äôm procrastinating. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm stuck and talking and talking and talking about action. The dirty dishes are still there in the sink. Do you recognise this feeling? What‚Äôs your take? Beginning of the week, I joined Sustainable Brands Global Conference in San Diego delivering a 2-hours workshop sharing 7 concrete hacks on how to unlock greater impact and cut through with creativity. Here are the 7 hacks illustrated by an example. 1 Change your leadership: Who can you help people become? - Discovery.co.za 2 Tell me something new ‚Äì https://lnkd.in/dB8-7yER 3 Find your story like a documentarist ‚Äì slaveryfootprint.org 4 Story Do ‚Äì https://lnkd.in/dC8iPhgQ 5 Be visual and simple ‚Äì https://lnkd.in/dY9uHc96 6 Bridge the political fault line, step into people‚Äôs shoes ‚Äì Intermarch√© Inglorious Fruits and Vegetables https://lnkd.in/dygSrQSt 7 Turn people into the activists ‚Äì https://lnkd.in/db8nrQs9 I was incredibly pleased to be joined in the workshop by Jarami Bond from Bond Studios, who shared how to make productions more responsible and inclusive to the communities they operate in. Thanks for joining! I was pleased to get time to join a few sessions and here are two random aha-moments. I joined a truly, refreshing panel with John Izzo, Ph.D. Anu Ramamurtyand Kafia Ahmed on how senior citizens are a tremendous untapped resource in the climate space as most brands simply advertise youthfulness to them, but actually all they want is to be useful. Check out the US organisation called Thirdact.org empowering senior citizens to take action. Imagine, young and old joining arms in climate protests. Hard to ignore no? I did enjoy the experimental approach footwear brand Vivo Barefoot took in terms of embracing local, open-source 3-D printing to create the next frontier of sustainable footwear #VivoBiome. Check it out here https://lnkd.in/djTe8qRE . Lastly, it was a true joy and inspiration to catch-up with the community and re-connect, connect or meet for the first time. Again, is all this worth it? Isn‚Äôt it simply time to turn the cosy community, conference feeling into wider, collective climate action? Down from the stages up on the barricades!

The irony and discomfort of having BP, a fossil fuel giant, sponsor a conference centred around green technology and sustainability, were not lost on us. This lack of clarity and poor communication to attendees and exhibitors around sponsorship was a bitter pill to swallow and something we weren't even aware of when we signed up. It's really important there is transparency in such partnerships as attendees deserve to know who the key sponsors are to make informed decisions about their participation. üçå Pragmatic Approach: This brings us onto our next reflection... we are a #smallbusiness. Therefore we approach all opportunities with pragmatism. We don't hate ourselves for going. The conference provided invaluable insights and connections that we otherwise wouldn't have accessed. üçå Would We Commit Again?: Absolutely. Our experience was overwhelmingly positive. We established meaningful connections, gained invaluable insights for customer development, and engaged in enriching knowledge exchanges that are already starting to shape our future plans! Sometimes the path forward isn't always black and white - especially in business and sustainability. However, seizing opportunities amidst complexity is vital for us. It allows us to further our mission of spreading climate education and creating #meaningfulconversations. Next time, though, a touch more transparency would be greatly appreciated Innovationzero-AR!üòâ #innovationzero Dr Emma Fieldhouse Charlotte Lawson Jodie Evans\n\nDo come! UnConference Invite: How can we accelerate towards a fair and sustainable future? What is an UnConference ? It‚Äôs where you shape the agenda. Come and find out. The Sustainability Accelerator UnConference is a participatory one-day event. We will bring together thinkers from a wide range of backgrounds to discuss challenges and solutions to reach a sustainable future over the long term. At traditional conferences, some of the best conversations happen in the corridors and the audience have just as many ideas as the panel. On the day, participants self-organise to create their own agenda, allowing a dynamic and immediate response to the issues at hand. Any participant can timetable a topic on something that they want to work on. Nothing is out of bounds. Once all the topics are timetabled, participants move into smaller, flexible break-out groups. People work on the things that they feel most passionate about. Date: Friday, 15 September | 9am to 5pm Venue: Chatham House, 10 St James‚Äôs Square, London SW1Y 4LE Registration link in comments.\n\nLeaders Panel at the Decarbonising New Zealand Conference! #Sustainability #ClimateAction #Innovation I'll be participating in the upcoming Brightstar Decarbonising New Zealand Conference. Joining a distinguished panel of experts, including Andrew E. from the New Zealand Green Building Council (NZGBC), Kate Wilson Butler of Chapman Tripp, Dale Eastham from Fulton Hogan, and Robin Davies of BlueScope I'll bring my entrepreneurial insights from Alimentary Systems' circular economy journey to our panel discussion: \"Why are we not acting faster?\" As we tackle the urgent need for sustainable solutions, I look forward to diving into these critical topics. 1. Global, National, and Local Standards & Collaboration: The role of unified standards in accelerating our path to sustainability. 2. Financial Implications: A deep dive into the economics of sustainability - who pays, when, why, and how? 3. Transition Plans: The inseparable duo in effective climate action. 4. Technology & Implementation: Exploring the gap between existing technologies and their application in the real world. These discussions are not just about identifying challenges but about sparking a movement towards actionable solutions. üåø Special Offer: To encourage participation and spread awareness, I'm excited to share that Brightstar is offering a \"Buy 1, Get 1 Free\" deal for the conference, valid until the end of January, thanks to Scott Wright and John Mercer making a two-day ticket $675 pp. Can you imagine the payback on that? üìÖ Conference Date: Feb 19 ‚Äì 20 Cordis, Auckland üîó Details & Registration: https://lnkd.in/gjAA_cfw Your presence and engagement are crucial in shaping a sustainable future. Let's collaborate, share insights, and drive meaningful change. Please reshare this post and spread the word. Together, we can make a difference!
