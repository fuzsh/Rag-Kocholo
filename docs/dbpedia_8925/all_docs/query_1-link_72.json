        "text": "Serving 2020 through 2023\n\nAfter graduation from Friends Seminary, Alice received her BS in Psychology and Education from Emerson College. After working in children’s publishing for a year, Alice received her Master’s in Library Science from San Jose State University. Alice worked for many years as a young adults librarian at the central branch of the Boston Public Library. Since 2000, Alice has been Library Director at the Winsor School in Boston, an independent school for academically motivated girls in grades 5-12. During her time at Winsor, Alice has served as Faculty Annual Fund Chair, has been a leader in DEI work, and advises the Upper School’s GSA. Alice has served on a number of American Library Association committees, including the Newbery Award Committee, and has been a book reviewer for library journals.\n\nThe Quaker education Alice received at Friends has served as a guiding principle throughout her life. Alice has been a class fund agent, and is looking forward to serving Friends in her role as Alumni Council member.\n\nElizabeth Baer ’82 (she/her) was a “lifer” at Friends Seminary, attending from K-4 through 12th grade. She spends her days channeling Phil Schwartz as a Latin teacher in the Lenox (MA) Public Schools and has also at times taught Ancient Greek, English, linguistics and ancient literature in translation. As a side gig, Liz writes a biweekly food column for the Berkshire Eagle, and shares those columns on her blog, CulinUrsa (Latin for “kitchen bear”). In addition, she has served as a contributing editor of a dictionary, co-authored an intermediate Latin reader, and continues to freelance as a proofreader and copy editor. Liz and her husband, Hank, live in the beautiful Berkshires, and have four adult children between them and one brand new grandchild!\n\nServing 2019 through 2022\n\nAfter graduating from Friends in 1987, Jocelyn went on to earn her B.A. Cum Laude at Cornell University. Inspired by the expression of identity through storytelling, media and performance, Jocelyn constructed her own major called \"Language, Literature and Gender\" which was then used as the corner store for creating the forthcoming Women's Studies major open to all undergraduates. Following her time at Cornell, Jocelyn went to Berlin, Germany on a Fulbright Scholarship to study Feminist Jewish identity in the wake of the falling of the Berlin wall. Upon the completion of her Fulbright, she stayed in Germany for another six years, where she was one of the few women leaders at the fore of the underground music scene -- running night clubs, managing performers, as well creating and executing marketing and PR campaigns.\n\nIn 1998, Jocelyn returned to New York City where she expanded her repertoire to digital media and television. As the Technical Executive Producer of hbo.com and its sister properties, Jocelyn was the program manager and liaison between HBO's various marketing departments and the back-end technology group. Her responsibilities included technical event management, i.e. setting up cyber cafés (yes, that was a thing), integrating online and broadcast content (think polling and other audience type of integration during live events), and general back-end development to support HBO's core roster and its specialized campaigns.\n\nMost recently, Jocelyn founded her own agency, Esmerize. Esmerize focuses on the intersection of technology, content and marketing, especially as it relates to both virtual and physical user experiences: web sites, apps, digital signage, event technology, kiosks, etc. Some of her more recent clients have included The New York Stock Exchange, Turner Broadcasting, Lamia's Fish Market, thestreet.com, Brickell City Center, and Evercore. She has also taken great pleasure in volunteering at her daughter's public elementary and middle schools, doing everything from re-branding and marketing campaigns, to building communications and fundraising platforms, to generally playing an active leadership role within the PTA. Now, Jocelyn looks forward to lending her skills to her beloved alma mater.\n\nServing 2021 through 2024\n\nMaisha Yearwood is a Harlem native and a Hollywood writer who has been writing and developing sitcoms and feature films for 25 years.
