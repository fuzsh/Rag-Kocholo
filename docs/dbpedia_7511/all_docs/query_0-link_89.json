        "text": "Good article in The Australian about this.\n\nRevamp to create fast, lethal army\n\nPatrick Walters, National security editor\n\nNovember 29, 2005\n\nAUSTRALIA'S army will be restructured into nine highly flexible \"battle groups\" capable of being rapidly deployed to wage war or perform peacekeeping duties under a $1.8 billion plan to be put to cabinet's national security committee tomorrow.\n\nThe radical overhaul, the biggest transformation of the army's organisation since World War II, would see land forces boosted by an extra 2500 combat troops - almost 10 per cent - by 2012.\n\nDefence Minister Robert Hill hopes to win in-principle cabinet support for his \"hardening and networking\" submission, which aims to restructure the army to cope with the more dangerous global environment.\n\nIt will signal a major shift from the army's existing organisation, based on light infantry battalions of between 750 and 800 soldiers.\n\nThe planned changes would see each new \"battle group\" -- about 750-strong and based on current battalions and regiments -- equipped with all the assets to wage war in the 21st-century battlefield, including artillery, tanks and helicopters.\n\nNew deployable army formations -- ranging from the battle groups to the smallest four-man \"fire team\" -- would be a great deal more lethal and nimble, better protected, and more adaptable than the army's existing five mainstream infantry battalions.\n\nBut with senior ministers still to agree on future real funding increases for Defence beyond 2010, Senator Hill is likely to be asked to bring another detailed costing submission on the army's plan to cabinet budget sessions early next year.\n\nSenator Hill will also seek endorsement tomorrow for Defence's new strategic update paper, which backs the need for a bigger army in the face of global terrorism and nuclear weapons proliferation.\n\nThe army's goal is to create two composite brigade-sized units, each consisting of 3000 soldiers, equipped with artillery, aviation, armoured vehicles and engineering support.\n\nThis would enable a brigade-strength force to be maintained on operations overseas simultaneously with a smaller battalion or battle group -- a key goal set by the Government for the future army in the 2000 Defence White Paper and not yet achieved.\n\nUnder the changes, the army would grow to about 28,000 personnel, compared with its current strength of around 25,500. The army already has approval to lift its strength to 26,500, but is struggling to fill recruitment targets.\n\nThe bigger force would allow the creation of an extra battalion or battle group, as well as enabling hollowed-out units to become fully operational.\n\nThe army plan would also see all units \"networked\", with even individual soldiers given access to sophisticated communications and intelligence links.\n\nArmy chief Peter Leahy has argued that hardening and networking the army is essential if Australia is to retain a genuine landforce fighting capability in coming decades. The 10-year restructuring plan will also see some regular army units moving interstate, with the 3rd Battalion Royal Australian Regiment moving to Adelaide from Holsworthy, in Sydney's west, by 2012.\n\nThe new \"modular\" structure would be more agile and adaptable than the army's traditional combat units and capable of a wider range of independent operations as well as being capable of slotting into bigger fighting formations should the need arise.\n\nCabinet's national security committee is yet to approve a continuation of 3 per cent real growth for the Defence budget beyond 2010 -- an increase that will be essential to achieve the army restructuring.\n\nSenator Hill has won a reprieve from John Howard for two of the three submissions he had hoped to bring to cabinet earlier this month.\n\nThe Prime Minister had wanted cabinet consideration of the Defence submissions postponed until next year, but Senator Hill successfully lobbied for the Defence update and the army plan to be considered before Christmas.\n\nThe third submission, on funding levels and the future defence capability plan, will be held over until next year, according to senior government sources.\n\nThe army plans to offset some of the cost of the restructuring plan from the sale of asset, including valuable property in the Sydney area. Army reservists are also set to play a more active role in the new deployable battle groups.\n\nhttp://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5744,17395937%255E601,00.html\n\nIt's about time some serious attention was being made to the Australian Army. Despite our defence posture being dictated by \"experts\" such as Paul DIBB, which advocated our defence forces possessing high level Naval and Air Forces, but neglecting our Army and deployment capabilities and relegating them to \"support\" roles for the Air Force and Navy, it is our Army which has been called upon to do the bulk of our operational deployments...\n\nIt has done this undermanned and ill-equipped for most of the roles it has been thrust into, with only \"crash\" acquisitions and heavy reliance on our allies capabilities allowing us to partially fill the numerous gaps in our Army's capabilities...\n\nEven now in Al Muthana, our 450 strong force has replaced a 1500 strong Dutch force, equipped with attack helo's, heavy armour and it's own artillery. We have deployed a light infantry force mounted in light wheeled armour, with no helo capability of ANY kind, let alone attack helo's, no heavy armour and no in-direct firepower of ANY kind, let alone artillery... Statements from our Defence Minister like: \"our ASLAV vehicles are the envy of many coalition forces\" are designed to cover up the reality of these deployments.\n\nYes, I'm sure our coalition ally troops are envious of not being able to sit in a lightly armoured wheeled vehicle and would much prefer to instead of their highly armoured tracked Warrior and Bradley IFV's...\n\nOf course we have cleverly managed to deploy our forces to the most secure part of Iraq, a part where British forces patrol in soft skinned Land Rovers, I might add, so it's easy to talk up our capabilities I suppose... I'd like to see how well these advanced capabilities of ours would go in Baghdad for any extended periods. Our sole confrontation with an IED in Iraq to date, left our vaunted ASLAV on it's side, completely vulnerable to any follow-up attack and unable to continue operating.\n\nOur 3 personnel in the vehicle were all injured an unable to continuing operating, with 2 personell so severely injured that they had to be evacuated out of Iraq for medical attention. Fortunately neither died, but I'm sure it was a great consolation to them \"how well their ASLAV\" protected them...\n\nAnyway rant off. Let's hope some serious changes for the better, come from these proposals.\n\nWell said Aussie Digger, I understand your frustrations and totally support your view. But from what I can gather (I know we haven't heard anything in any great detail yet, nor have we heard anything \"official\" from anyone within Defence) there probably won't be any additional heavy armour aquisitions to support this new structure, we will probably have too do with the pathetically small numbers of Abrams we are getting and survive without a true IFV.\n\nYou seem to know quite a lot about the ADF (obviously have or are currently serving) but I am quite uneducated about the ADF (being a civilian) but am extremely interested in our Defence Force (would love to join but already have my dream job), so I was wondering if you could post some information that outlines the structure of different brigades/ battallions etc as I don't know what the hell people are refering to when they talk about troops, units, brigades, HQs, batallions etc. I would really appreciate it.\n\nHopefully we will hear some more information over the next few weeks about this topic."
