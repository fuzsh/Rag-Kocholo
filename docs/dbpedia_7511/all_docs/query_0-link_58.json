RUSSELL, Acting Minister of State for Defence.\n\n[\"London Gazette,\" No. 31082, dated 26th December, 1918.]\n\nHIS MAJESTY THE KING has been graciously pleased to\n\napprove of the award of the Victoria Cross to the undermen\n\ntioned officers, non-commissioned officers, and men:—\n\n1st Military District.\n\nNo. 23 Lance-Corporal Bernard 'Sidney Gordon, M.M., 41st\n\nBattalion.\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty\n\non the 26th-27th August, 1918, east of Bray. He led his\n\nsection through heavy shell fire to the objective, which\n\nhe consolidated. Single-handed he attacked an enemy\n\nmachine gun which was enfilading the company on his\n\nright, killed the man on the gun, and captured the post,\n\nwhich contained one officer and ten men. He then\n\ncleared up a trench, capturing twenty-nine prisoners and\n\ntwo machine guns. In clearing up further trenches he\n\ncaptured twenty-two prisoners, including one officer,\n\nand three machine guns. Practically unaided, he cap\n\ntured, in the course of these operations, two officers and\n\nsixty-one other ratiks, together with six machine guns,\n\nand displayed throughout a wonderful example of fear\n\nless initiative.\n\n2nd Military District.\n\npSTo. 1717 Private John Ryan, 55th Battalion.\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty\n\nduring an attack against the Hindenburg defences on\n\n30th September, 1918. In the initial assault on the\n\nenemy's positions Private Ryan went forward with\n\ngreat dash and determination, and was one of the first\n\nto reach the enemy trench. His exceptional skill and\n\ndaring inspired his comrades, and, despite heavy fire,\n\nthe hostile garrison was soon overcome and the trench\n\noccupied. The enemy then counter-attacked, and suc\n\nceeded in establishing a bombing party in the rear of\n\nthe position. Under fire from front and rear, the\n\nposition 'was critical, and necessitated prompt action.\n\nQuickly appreciating the situation, he organized and\n\nled the men near him with bomb and bayonet against\n\nthe enemy bombers, finally reaching the position with\n\nonly three men. By skilful bayonet work, his small\n\nparty succeeded in killing the first three Germans on\n\n0.4402.\n\nthe enemy's flank, then, moving along the embankment,\n\nPrivate Ryan alone rushed the remainder with bombs.\n\nlie fell wounded after he had driven back the enemy,\n\nwho suffered heavily as they retired across \"No Mail's\n\nLand.\" A particularly dangerous situation had been\n\nsaved by this gallant soldier, whose example of deter\n\nmined bravery and initiative was an inspiration to all.\n\nMajor Blair Anderson Ware, D.S.O., 32nd Battalion.\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery^ initiative, and control\n\nduring the period 29th September to 1st October, 1918,\n\nin the operations against the Hindenburg Line at Belli\n\ncourt and the advance through. Nauroy, Etricourt,\n\nMagny La Fosse, and Joncourt. On 29th September,\n\nafter personal reconnaissance, under heavy fire, he led\n\nhis command forward at a critical period, and restored\n\nthe situation. Moving fearlessly at the head of, and at\n\ntimes far in advance of, his troops, he cheered his men\n\non through Nauroy, thence towards Etricourt. Still\n\nleading his assaulting companies, he observed a battery\n\nof 77mm. guns firing on his rear companies, and c&ushlg\n\nheavy casualties. Collecting a few of his mbA, lie\n\nrushed the battery, capturing fo/ur guns and ten of the\n\ncrew. Then moving rapidly forward, with oflly two\n\nN.C.O.'s, he surprised and captured fifty Germans near\n\nMagny La Fosse. On 1st October, 1918, he again showed\n\nfearless leading and gallantry in attack, and without\n\nhesitation, and regardless of personal risk, dashed for\n\nward and silenced machine guns which were causing\n\nheavy casualties. Throughout he displayed the greatest\n\ncourage, skilful leading, and devotion to duty, and his\n\nwork was invaluable.\n\n4th Military District.\n\nNo. 1153 Lance-Corporal (temporary Corporal) Lawrence\n\nCarthage Weathers, 43rd Battalion.\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery and devotion to dfctty\n\non the 2nd September, 1918, north of Peronne, when\n\nwith an advanced bombing party. The attack having\n\nbeen held up by a strongly-held enemy trench, Corporal\n\nWeathers went forward alone, under heavy fire, and\n\nattacked the enemy with bombs. Then, returning tt>\n\nour lines for a further supply of bombs, he again Went\n\nforward with three comrades and attacked under .very\n\nheavy fire. Regardless' of personal danger, he mounted\n\nthe enemy parapet and bombed the trench, and, with the\n\nsupport of his comrades, captured ISO prisoners and\n\nthree machine guns. His valour -and detenmnatlea\n\nresulted in the successful capture of the final objective,\n\nand saved the lives of many of his comrades.\n\n5th Military District.\n\nNo. 3244a Private James Park Woods, 48th Battalion.\n\nFor conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty near\n\nLe Verguier, north-west of St. Quentin, on the 18th Sep\n\ntember, 1918, when, with a weak patrol, he attacked\n\nand captured a very formidable enemy post, and sub\n\nsequently,, with two comrades, held the same against\n\nheaA'y enemy counter-attacks. Although exposed to\n\nheavy fire of all descriptions, he fearlessly jumped on\n\nthe parapet and opened fire on the attacking enemy,\n\ninflicting severe casualties. He kept up his fire, and\n\nheld up the enemy until help arrived, and throughout\n\nthe operations displayed a splendid example of valour,\n\ndetermination, and initiative.\n\n[\" London Gazette,\" jVo. 30122, dated 8th June, 1917.]\n\nHIS MAJESTY TH3L KINO has been graciously pleased to\n\napprove of the award of the Victoria Cross to the undermen\n\ntioned soldier:—\n\n4th Military District.\n\nNo. 2389 Private Jorgan Christian Jensen, 50th Battalion.\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery and initiative when,\n\nwith five comrades, he attacked a barricade, behind\n\n■which were about 45 of the enemy and a machine gun.\n\nOne of his party shot the gunner, and Private Jensen,\n\nsingle-handed, rushed the post, and threw in a bomb.\n\nHe had still a bomb in one hand, but taking another\n\nfrom his pocket with the other hand he drew the pin\n\nwith his teetli, and by threatening the enemy with two\n\nbombs and by telling them that they were surrounded,\n\nhe induced them to surrender. Private Jensen then\n\nsent one of his prisoners to order a neighbouring enemy\n\nparty to surrender, which they did. This latter party\n\nwas then fired on in ignorance of their surrender by\n\nanother party of our troops, whereupon Private Jensen,\n\nutterly regardless of personal danger, stood on the barri\n\ncade, waved his helmet, caused the firing to cease, and\n\nsent his prisoners back to our lines. Private Jensen's\n\nconduct throughout was marked by extraordinary\n\nbravery and determination.\n\n[\"London Gazette,\" Wo. 310S4, dated 27th December, 1918.]\n\nCENTRAL CHANCERY OF THE ORDERS OF\n\nKNIGHTHOOD.\n\n27th December, 1918.\n\nTHE KING has been graciously pleased to institute a\n\nMilitary Division of the Most Excellent Order of the British\n\nEmpire, to date from the creation of the Order, i.e., the 4th\n\nJune, 1917.\n\nThe following classes of persons will be eligible for appoint\n\nment to the Military Division of the Order:—\n\nAll commissioned^ warrant, and subordinate officers subject\n\nto the Naval Discipline Act or employed under the Order of\n\nthe Admiralty, and all commissioned and warrant officers re\n\ncommended by any Commander in Chief in the field or else\n\nwhere, or by the General Officer Commanding, Independent\n\nForce, Royal Air Force, or employed under the War Office or Air\n\nMinistry, or under the Administrative Head-Quarters of Do\n\nminions or Overseas Forces, or employed under the Ministry of\n\nMunitions, or the Ministry of National Service on work, which,\n\nbut for the creation of those Departments, would have been per\n\nformed by the War Office; and all members of the Naval,\n\nArmy, Dominions, or Overseas Nursing Services, or officii]^\n\nof the Women's Royal Naval Service, Queen Mary's Auxiliary\n\nCorps, or ithe Women's Royal Air Force, and such com\n\nmandants of the Women's Legion, or similar organizations as\n\nare under contract with or employed by the Admiralty, War\n\nOffice, or Air Ministry.\n\nPersons already appointed to the Order who are qualified\n\nfor the Military Division will, on the recommendation of the\n\nFirst Lord of the Admiralty, the Secretary of (State for War.\n\nor the 'Secretary of State for the Royal Air Force, as the case\n\nmay be, be transferred to the Military Division.\n\nThe Insignia for both Military and Civil Division6* will be\n\nthe same, but the ribbon of the Military Division will be dis\n\ntinguished by a vertical red stripe in the centre of the existing\n\nribbon.\n\n[\" London Gazette,\" iVo. 31089, dated 31s£ December, 1918.]\n\nThe following is a continuation of Sir D.

He displayed untiring energy\n\nand courage throughout.\n\nLieutenant (temporary Captain) Harry Walker, 32nd Bat\n\ntalion, attached 8th Light Trench Mortar Battery.\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and resource. He was\n\nwounded during an advance,- but remained with his de\n\ntachment until all his ammunition was expended. On\n\nhis way to the dressing station, hearing that the in\n\nfantry were held up by machine-gun fire and were in\n\nneed of help, he at once collected some men, and led them\n\nforward with ammunition. He .brought a mortar into\n\naction, silenced the enemy machine-guns, and enabled\n\nthe advance to continue. He also put out of action an\n\nanti-tank gun which was hampering the advance of the\n\ntanks. He showed splendid courage and initiative.\n\n6th Military 'District.\n\nCaptain William Lemuel Edward Domeney, 15th Battalion.\n\nFor conspicuous gallantry and able leadership in an\n\nattack. After clearing strong opposition from a village,\n\nhe led forward a party and capturfed an enemy strong\n\npoint which was holding up the advance, taking twelve\n\nmachine guns and some 50 prisoners.

At\n\ndaybreak the post of which this officer was in command\n\nwas strongly attacked.

When his company commander became a\n\ncasualty he assumed command, and led the company\n\nbrilliantly, capturing his objective and consolidating\n\nunder heavy machine-gun and artillery fire. He set an\n\nexcellent example to all ranks.\n\n[London Gazette, No. 31046, dated 3rd December, 1918.]\n\nHIS [MAJESTY THE KING has been graciously pleased to\n\nconfer the undermentioned Rewards on officers and other1 ranks\n\nof the Royal Air Force in recognition of gallantry in flying\n\noperations against the enemy:—\n\nDistinguished Service Order.\n\n2nd Military District.\n\nCaptain Edgar James McCloughry, D.F.C., Australian\n\nFlying Corps.\n\nA bold and fearless officer, who has performed many\n\ngallant deeds of daring, notably on 24th September, when,\n\nattacking a train at 250 feet altitude, lie obtained a\n\ndirect hit, cutting it in two, the rear portion being de\n\nrailed. He then fired a number of rounds at the fore\n\nportion, which pulled up. Sighting a hostile two-seater\n\nhe engaged it and drove it down. Proceeding home, he\n\nobserved seven Fokker biplanes; although he had ex\n\npended the greater part of his ammunition, Captain\n\nMcCloughry never' hesitated, but engaged the leader.\n\nDuring the combat that ensued, he was severely wounded\n\nby fire from a scout that attacked him from behind;\n\nturning, lie drove this machine off badly damaged. His\n\nammunition being now expended, he endeavoured to drive\n\noff two hostile scouts by firing Very lights at them.\n\nExhausted by his exertions, he temporarily lost con\n\nsciousness, but recovered sufficiently to land his machine\n\nsafely.

By skilful manoeuvre he com\n\npletely defeated the enemy in a combat that only lasted\n\ntwenty minutes, at the expiration of which period only\n\nfour hostile machines remained in the air, and these re\n\ntired. Six of the enemy machines were seen to fall in\n\na manner that would justify the supposition that they\n\nwould crash.

During the early stages of the advance\n\nhe located and captured, single-handed, an enemy\n\nmachine gun which was causing casualties, and by turn\n\ning it on the enemp inflicted severe losses. Subse\n\nquently, by the skilful, tactical handling of his guns, he\n\ncut off and captured twenty-five of the euemy. Later,\n\nby fearless reconnaissance under heavy Are, and by the\n\nenergy, foresight, and promptitude with which he brought\n\nfire to bear on various enemy groups, he gave valuable\n\nsupport to the infantry advance. Again/ when short\n\nof ^ ammunition, he secured an enemy machine gun,\n\nwhich he mounted and fired in full view of the enemy,\n\ncausing the enemy to retire further, and enabling our\n\ninfantry to advance. Under intense fire, although\n\nwounded, he maintained the fire of this gun at a very\n\ncritical period. During the following night he steadied\n\nand gave valuable support to a small detached post, and\n\nby his coolness and cheerfulness inspirited the men in a\n\ngreat degree. Throughout the night he kept close\n\nwatch by personal reconnaissance on the enemy move\n\nments, and was evacuated exhausted thirty hours after\n\nbeing wounded. The valour and resourcefulness of\n\nLieutenant Towner undoubtedly saved a very critical\n\nsituation, and contributed largely to the success of the\n\nattack.\n\n2nd Military District.\n\nNo. 1876 Private (temporary Corporal) Alexander Henry\n\nBuckley, late 54th Battalion.\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery and self-sacrifice at\n\nPeronne during the operations on 1st and 2nd Septem\n\nber, 1918. After passing the first objective his half\n\nc'ompany and part of the company on the flank were\n\nheld up by an enemy machine-gun nest. With one man\n\nhe rushed the post, shooting four of the occupants and\n\ntaking twenty-two prisoners. Later on, reaching a moat,\n\nit was found that another machine-gun nest commanded\n\nthe only available foot-bridge. Whilst this was being\n\nengaged from a flank Corporal Buckley endeavoured to\n\ncross the bridge and rush the post, but was killed in the\n\nattempt. Throughout the advance he had displayed\n\ngreat initiative, resource, and courage, and by his effort\n\nto save his comrades from casualties, he set a fine\n\nexample of self-sacrificing devotion to duty.\n\nNo. 726 Private George Cartwright, 33rd Battalion.\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty on\n\nthe morning of the 31st August, 1918, during the attack\n\non Road Wood, south-west of Bouchavesnes, near\n\nPeronne. When two companies were held up by machine\n\ngun fire, from the eouth-western edge of the wood, with\n\nout hesitation Private Cartwright moved against the gun\n\nin a most deliberate manner under intense fire. He shot\n\nthree of the team, and, having bombed the post, cap\n\ntured the gun and nine enemy. This gallant deed had\n\na most inspiring effect on the whole line, which imme\n\ndiately rushed forward. Throughout the operation\n\nPrivate Cartwright displayed wonderful dash, grim de\n\ntermination, and courage of the highest order.\n\nNo. 1584a Private William Matthew Currey, 53rd Battalion.\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery and daring in the attack\n\non Peronne on the morning of 1st* September, 1918.\n\nWhen the battalion was suffering heavy casualties from\n\na 77mm. field gun at very close range, Private Currey,\n\nwithout hesitation, rushed forward under intense machine\n\ngun fire and succeeded in capturing the gun single\n\nhanded, after killing the entire crew. Later, when the\n\nadvance of the left flank was checked by an enemy\n\nstrong point, Private Currey crept around the flank and\n\nengaged the post with a Lewis gun. Finally, he rushed\n\nthe post single-handed, causing many casualties. It was\n\nentirely owing to his gallant conduct that the situation\n\nwas relieved and the advance enabled to continue. Sub\n\nsequently he volunteered to carry orders for the with\n\ndrawal of an isolated company, and this he succeeded in\n\ndoing despite shell and rifle fire, returning later with\n\nvaluable information. Throughout the operations his\n\nstriking example of coolness, determination, and utter\n\ndisregard of danger had a most inspiring effect on his\n\ncomrades, and his gallant work contributed largely to\n\nthe success of the operations.\n\nNo 2631 Corporal Arthur Charles Hall, 54th Battalion.\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery, brilliant leadership, and\n\ndevotion to duty during the operations at Peronne on\n\n1st and 2nd September, 1918. During the attack on the\n\n1st September a machine-gun post was checking the ad\n\nvance. Single-handed he rushed the position, shot four\n\nof the occupants, and captured nine others and two\n\nmachine guns. Then crossing.the objective with a small\n\nparty, he afforded excellent covering support to the re\n\nmainder of the company. Continuously in advance of\n\nthe main party, he located enemy posts of resistance and\n\npersonally led parties to the assault. In this way he\n\ncaptured many small parties of prisoners and machine\n\nguns. On the morning of the 2nd September, during a\n\nheavy barrage, he carried to safety a comrade who had\n\nbeen dangerously wounded and was urgently in need of\n\nmedical attention, and immediately returned to his post.\n\nThe energy and personal courage of this gallant non\n\ncommissioned officer contributed largely to the success\n\nof the operation*, throughout which he showed utter dis\n\nregard of danger and inspired confidence in all.\n\nNo. 6594 Sergeant Gerald Sexton, 13th Battalion.\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery during the attack near\n\nLe Verguier, north-west of St. Quentin, on the 18th Sep\n\ntember, 1918. During the whole period of tlie advance,\n\nwhich was very seriously opposed, Sergeant Sexton, was\n\nto \"the fore dealing with enemy machine guns, rushing\n\nenemy posts, and performing great feats of bravery and\n\nendurance without faltering or for a moment taking cover.\n\nWhen the advance had passed the ridge at Le Verguier.\n\nSergeant Sexton's attention was directed to a party of\n\nthe enemy manning a bank, and to a field gun causing\n\ncasualties and holding up a company. Without hesita\n\ntion, calling to his section to follow, he rushed down\n\nthe bank and killed the gunners of the field gun. Re\n\ngardless of machine-gun fire, he returned to tlyj bank,\n\nand after firing down some dug-outs induced about thirty\n\nof the enemy to surrender. When the advance was\n\ncontinued from the first to the second objective the com\n\npany was again held up by machine guns on the flanks.\n\nSupported by another platoon, he disposed of the enemy\n\nguns, displaying boldness which inspired all. Later, he\n\nagain showed the most conspicuous initiative in the cap\n\nture of hostile posts and machine guns, and rendered\n\ninvaluable support to his company digging in.\n\n3rd Military District.\n\nNo. 2742 Private Robert Matthew Beatham, late 8tli Bat\n\ntalion.\n\nFor most conspicuous (bravery and self-sacrifice during\n\nthe attack north of Rosieres, east of Amiens, on the 9th\n\nAugust, 1918. When the advance was held up by heavy\n\nmachine-gun fire, Private Beatham dashed forward, and,\n\nassisted by one man, bombed and fought the crews of\n\nfour enemy machine guns, .killing ten of them and cap\n\nturing ten others, thus facilitating the advance and\n\nsaving many casualties. When the final objective was\n\nreached although previously wounded, he again dashed\n\nforward and bombed a machine gun, being riddled with\n\nbullets and killed in doing fo. The valour displayed by\n\nthis gallant soldier inspired all ranks in a wonderful\n\nmanner.\n\nNo. 2358 Sergeant Albert David Lowerson, 21st Battalion.\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery and tactical skill on the\n\n1st September, 1918, during the attack on Mt. St.\n\nQuentin, north of Peronne, when very strong opposition\n\nwas met with early in the attack, and every foot of\n\nground was stubbornly contested by the enemy. Regard\n\nless of heavy enemy machine-gun fire, Sergeant Lowerson\n\nmoved about fearlessly directing his men, encouraging\n\nthem to still greater effort, and finally led them on to\n\nthe objective. On reaching the objective he saw that\n\nthe left attacking party was held up by an enemy strong\n\npost heavily manned with twelve # machine guns. Under\n\nthe heaviest sniping and machine-gun fire, Sergeant\n\nLowerson rallied seven men as a storming party, and\n\ndirecting them to attack the flanks of the post, rushed\n\nthe strong point, and, by effective bombing, captured it,\n\ntogether with twelve machine guns and thirty prisoners.\n\nThough severely wounded in the right thigh, he refused\n\nto leave the front line until the prisoners had^ been dis\n\nposed of, and the organization and consolidation of the\n\npost had been thoroughly completed. Throughout a\n\nweek of operations, bis leadership and example had a\n\ncontinual influence on the men serving under him, whilst\n\nhis prompt and effective action at a critical juncture\n\nallowed the forward movement to be carried on without\n\ndelay, thus ensuring the success of the attack.\n\nNo. 6939 Private Robert Mactier, late 23rd Battalion.\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty\n\non the morning of the 1st September, 1918, during the\n\nattack on the village of Mt. St. Quentin. Prior to the\n\nadvance of the battalion, it was necessary to clear up\n\nseveral enemy strong points close to our line. This the\n\nbombing patrols sent forward failed to effect, and the\n\nbattalion was unable to move. Private Mactier, single\n\nhanded, and in daylight, thereupon jumped out of the\n\ntrench, rushed past the block, closed with and killed the\n\nmachine-gun garrison of eight men with his revolver and\n\nbomlbs, and threw the enemy machine gun over the para\n\npet. Then, rushing forward about 20 yards, he jumped into\n\nanother strong point held by a garrison of six men, who\n\nimmediately surrendered. Continuing to the next block\n\nthrough the trench, he disposed of an enemy machine\n\ngun which had been enfilading our flank advancing\n\ntroops, and was then killed by another machine gun at\n\nclose range. It was entirely due to this exceptional\n\nvalour and. determination of Private Mactier that the\n\nbattalion was able to move on to its \" jumping-off \"\n\ntrench and carry out the successful operation of cap\n\nturixiT the village of Mt. St. Quentin a few hours later.\n\n5th Military District.\n\nLieutenant Lawrence Dominic McCarthy, 16th Battalion.\n\nFor most conspicuous bravery, initiative, and leader\n\nship on the morning of the 23rd August, 1918, in attack\n\nnear Madame Wood, east of Vermandovillers (north of\n\nChaulnes). Although the objectives of his battalion\n\nWere attained without serious opposition, the battalion\n\non the left flank was heavily- opposed by well-posted\n\nmachine guns. Lieutenant McCarthy, realizing the\n\nsituation, at once engaged the nearest machine-gun post,\n\nbut still the attacking troops failed to get forward.\n\nThis officer then determined to attack the nearest post.\n\nLeaving his men to continue the fire fight, he, with two\n\nothers, dashed across the open and succeeded in reaching\n\nthe block. Although single-handed, as he had out\n\ndistanced his comrades, and despite serious opposition\n\nand obstacles, he captured the gun and continued to\n\nfight his way down the trench, inflicting heavy casual\n\nties, and capturing three more machine guns. At this\n\nstage, being some 700 yards from his starting point, he\n\nwas joined by one of his men, and together they con\n\ntinued to bomb up the trench until touch was estab\n\nlished with an adjoining unit. Lieutenant McCarthy,\n\nduring this most daring advance, single-handed killed\n\ntwenty of the enemy and captured in addition five ma\n\nchine guns and fifty prisoners. By his gallant and de\n\ntermined action he saved a critical situation, prevented\n\nmany casualties, and was mainly, if not entirely, respon\n\nsible for the final objective being taken.\n\n[\" London Gazette,\" No. 31092, dated 1st January, 1919.]\n\nCENTRAL CHANCERY OP THE ORDERS OF\n\nKNIGHTHOOD.\n\nLord Chamberlain's Office,\n\n1st January, 1919.\n\nTHE KING has been graciously pleased to give orders for\n\nthe following promotions in, and appointments to, the Most\n\nHonorable Order of the Bath, for valuable services rendered\n\nin connexion with the military operations in France and\n\nFlanders :—\n\nTo be Additional MembersV)f the Military Division of the\n\nSecond Class, or Knights Commanders of the said Most Hon\n\norable Order:—\n\n2nd Military District.\n\nMajor-General Charles Rosenthal, C.B., C.M.G., D.S.O.,\n\nCommands and Staffs.\n\nTo be Additional Members of the Military Division of the\n\nThird Class, or Companions of the said Most Honorable\n\nOi'der :—\n\n1st Military District.\n\nColonel (T/Brigadier-General) Cecil Henry Foott, C.M.G.,\n\nGeneral List, Australian Imperial Force.\n\n3rd Military District.\n\nColonel (T/Brigadier-General) Walter Adams Coxen,\n\nC.M.G., D.S.O., General List, Australian Imperial Force.\n\nColonel (T/Brigadier-General) Walter Ramsay McNicoix,\n\nC.M.G., D.S.O., General List, Australian Imperial Force.\n\n5th Military District.\n\nColonel Julius Henry Brucshe, C.M.G., General List, Aus\n\ntralian Imperial Force.\n\nCHANCERY OF THE ORDER OF SAINT MICHAEL AND\n\nSAINT GEORGE.\n\nDowning-street,\n\n1st January, 1919.\n\nTHE KING has been graciously pleased to give directions\n\nfor the following promotions in, and appointments to, the Most\n\nDistinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George, for\n\nservices rendered in connexion with military operations in\n\nFrance and Flanders.
