        "text": "Until October 1939 divisional headquarters and district base headquarters came directly under the control of the Military Board. In October 1939 the Command organization was introduced into the AMF to reduce the number of lower formations directly under the control of Army Headquarters and to bring the peace organization into line with the war organization. Northern, Eastern, Southern and Western Commands were created, each roughly conforming with the state boundaries of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia respectively. The 4th and 6th Military Districts (South Australia and Tasmania) came under control of Southern Command, while 7th Military District and later 8th Military District (Northern Territory, and the Territories of Papua and New Guinea) were the responsibility of AHQ. In January 1942 base headquarters were formed in Northern, Eastern, and Southern Commands to separate the administrative role from the Command headquarters which retained the operational role.\n\nThe higher command organization underwent a complete reorganization in April 1942, Command Headquarters forming corps or divisional headquarters, while base and military district headquarters were organized into line of communication area headquarters. In certain areas, notably New Guinea, Northern Territory, and Tasmania, force headquarters were raised, these having both an operational and line of communication role.\n\nPrior to the reorganization of the Australian Military Forces in April 1942 little interest was shown in providing colour patches for formation headquarters above divisional level, although Corps and Overseas Base Sub-Area headquarters patches had been approved for the Second AIF during 1939/1940. Coloured armlets were deemed sufficient to distinguish officers allotted for duty in certain appointments with higher formation or base headquarters of the Home Forces. In June 1941 the MGO submitted proposals for the allocation of colour patches to higher formation headquarters, and that some efforts were taken in this direction is evidenced by No. 400. A scheme of colour patches was submitted almost immediately upon the reorganization of the command structure in April 1942,(see note 85) and thereafter colour patches were worn by all levels of headquarters until the abolition of the system.\n\nNote 85. Initial proposal was submitted by '0' Branch on 20.4.1942 and was concurred in, with one modification, by 'A' Branch on 21.4.1942. An AG Minute dated 13.5.1942 (AA[Vic.]: MP 508/1, item 107/701/56) makes reference to colour patches recently approved for respective L of C headquarters, and initial order for manufacture was MGO Order No. 2417, placed by LHQ(MGO) Memo No. 62365, 17.6.1942.\n\nIt will be noted that many units, and individual personnel, of certain corps and services were not allotted a distinctive colour patch but wore the colour patch of the headquarters of the formation to which they were attached or allotted for duty. Information relating to these units is contained in the sections pertaining to each arm or service.\n\n400. Headquarters Southern Command, 1942: Ref. Extract of HQ Southern Command\n\nmemo dated 11.4.1942 located in AA(Vic): CRS B1540, item 36/702. This memo\n\nadvised AHQ that this colour patch was currently on issue to the unit, and requested\n\npermission to retain it following redesignation as HQ 1st Aust. Corps on 15.4.1942.\n\nThis patch would appear to have been unofficial, or at least adopted in anticipation of\n\napproval being given, as on 9.4.1942 the authorisation of distinctive colour patches AHQ, Command, Base and District headquarters was still under consideration by the Adjutant-General. Ref. AA(Vic): MP 508/1, item 107/701/56.\n\n401A. Headquarters Allied Land Forces, South-West Pacific Area (L.H.Q.), 1942-1945;\n\nHeadquarters Australian Military Forces, 1945-1946;\n\nArmy Headquarters, 19461949: Auth. GRO 149/1942, 3.7.1942, and MBI 52/1946, 14.6,1946. Formed by redesignation of GHQ(Aust.) on 29.5.1942, formerly Army Headquarters. GRO 60/1945 states that all personnel, regardless of whether they belonged to a particular service or not, posted within the war establishment of LHQ or one of its echelons, were to wear the LHQ colour patch.\n\nAssociated headquarters and staffs wearing this patch between 1942 and 1946 included:\n\nLHQ Local Administrative Staff;\n\nAust. Army Staff (United Kingdom);\n\nAust. Military Mission (Washington);\n\nAust. Military Liaison Staff (Middle East);\n\nAdvanced LHQ / Advanced HQ AMF / HQ Morotai Force;\n\nBranch of the Chief Military Advisor;\n\nHeadquarters of Services, LHQ;\n\nDirectorate of Public Relations;\n\nPrisoner-of-War Information Bureau;\n\nGHQ Regulating System (AMF Component);\n\nFar Eastern Liaison Office (Aust. Army Section);\n\nExperimental Research Unit (MGO Branch);\n\nAust. Provision Office (Eastern Group);\n\nArmy Inspection Staffs;\n\n1st Aust. HQ Military Landing Group;\n\nCombined Operations Section.\n\n401B. General Headquarters (Australia), 1942: Believed to be a variation of No. 40 1 A, in\n\ncompressed felt, and possibly supplied prior to becoming LHQ on 29.5.1942.\n\n402A. Headquarters First Aust. Army, 1942-1946: Auth. GRO 149/1942, 3.7.1942.\n\nFormed by redesignation and reorganization of HQ 1st Aust. Corps on 11.4.1942 and\n\nwas redesignated HQ 8th Military District in February 1946.\n\n402B. Headquarters First Aust. Army, 1942:A size variation, 2 inches square, of No.\n\n402A. This error comprised almost half of the first batch of 2,000 pairs produced by\n\nthe CCF and issued to 3rd Aust. Adv. Ord. Depot at Toowoomba. It might be of\n\ninterest to note that the remainder of this 'initial batch measured I and 3/4 inches\n\nsquare. As far as is known these size variations were issued and worn.\n\n403. Headquarters Second Aust. Army, 1942-1945: Auth. GRO 149/1942, 3.7.1942.\n\nRaised in February 1942 as HQ Home Forces and was redesignated in April 1942.\n\n404. Headquarters 1st Aust. Corps, 1940-1942: Auth. Colour chart/Promulgated with\n\nAHQ(DOS) Memo No. 70030, 21.10.1940. Raised in May 1940 as part of the 2nd\n\nAlF and was reorganized as Headquarters First Aust.

In August 1942 it was redesignated 1st Aust. Corps and New Guinea Force Headquarters, reverted to its original title in August 1943, and was redesignated HQ 2nd Aust. Corps on 12.4.1944. On 20.4.1944 it absorbed HQ New Guinea Force and was re-titled HQ NG Force on 6.5.1944. Reformed as HQ 2nd Aust. Corps on 2.10.1944.\n\n406. Headquarters 2nd Aust. Corps, 1942-1945: Auth.

GRO 149/1942, 3.7.1942. Raised by redesignation of HQ Western Command *in April 1942. Absorbed HQ WA L of C Area on 1.6.1944 and was redesignated HQ Western Command on 10.6.1944.\n\n408. Headquarters Northern Territory Force, 1942-1946: Auth. GRO 149/1942,\n\n3.7.1942. Raised by redesignation of HQ 7th Military District in April 1942 and reverted to that title in April 1946. On 7.12.1942 it was briefly designated HQ 12th Aust. Division, reverting again to HQ NT Force in January 1943. In addition to its operational role it also carried out the duties of HQ NT L of C Area.\n\n409. Headquarters Torres Strait Force, 1943-1944; and\n\nHeadquarters Torres Strait Area, 1944-1946: Auth. GRO 92/1943, 22.1.1943. Raised on 1.9.1942 by redesignation of Thursday Island Fixed Defences Fortress Command.\n\n410. Headquarters Tasmania Force, 1942-1943: Auth. GRO 149/1942, 3.7.1942.\n\nFormed by redesignation of HQ Tasmania L of C Area in June 1942 and reverted back to this title on 29.4.1943. Performed both an operational and L of C headquarters role during its existence.\n\n411. Headquarters New Guinea Force, 1942-1944: Auth. GRO 149/1942, 3.7.1942.\n\nFormed by redesignation of HQ 8th Military District in April 1942. Absorbed as 1st Aust. Corps and NG Force Headquarters between August 1942 and August 1943, and was again absorbed by HQ 2nd Aust. Corps on 20.4.1944, although the new unit retained the title of HQ NG Force. Disbanded on 2.10.1944, reforming HQ 2nd Aust. Corps, the functions of the former HQ NG Force being taken over by HQ First Aust. Army.\n\n412. Headquarters 1st Cavalry Division, 1921-1942; and\n\nHeadquarters 1st Aust. Motor Division, 1942: Auth. SO Clothing Pt 111, 1922. Raised in NSW and Queensland in 1921 as a CMF formation comprising the 1st, 2nd, and 4th Cavalry Brigades, and was reorganized with the 1st and 2nd Motor-Brigades in April 1942. Redesignated HQ 3rd Aust. Armoured Division in October 1942.\n\n413. Headquarters 2nd Cavalry Division, 1921-1942; and\n\nHeadquarters 2nd Aust. Motor Division, 1942: Auth. SO Clothing Pt 111, 1922. Superseded by No. 416 in August 1942. Raised in Victoria and South Australia in 1921 as a CMF formation comprising the 3rd, 5th, and 6th Cavalry Brigades. Reorganized with the 3rd Motor and 6th Armoured Brigades in 1942.\n\n414. Headquarters 1st Aust. Armoured Division, 1941-1943: Ref. Ref AHQ(DOS) Memo No. 14520, 7.3.1941. Raised initially in July 1941 as an AIF formation, comprising the 1st and 2nd Armoured Brigades and Support Group. Reorganized with the 1st Armoured and 3rd Motor Brigades from October 1942 and disbanded in September 1943. A scheme of colour patches for all units of this division had been tentatively approved in January 1941, the shape being an inverted triangle. This was modified to the pentagon shape when it was found that inverted triangles were already in use by some AASC units in the Middle East. On 7.3.1941 the various Commands were advised by AHQ that a requisition had been placed with the CCF for the supply\n\nof colour patches for units of this division.\n\n415. Headquarters 1st Aust. Armoured Division: A right arm, pre-1942 CCF manufactured version of No. 414, comprising a lozenge shape cut out of the facing colour to expose the grey background beneath. See also No's 513, 518 and 522.\n\n416. Headquarters 2nd Aust. Motor Division, 1942-1943: Auth. GRO 301/1942, 7.8.1942. Although this formation is referred to in GRO 301/1942 and the Order of Battle, October 1942, as 2nd Aust. Armoured Division, all contemporary records, including Unit Routine Orders Part 11 and LHQ Postings and Appointment Orders, refer to this formation as 2nd Aust. Motor Division throughout its existence. It will be referred to as such in this book, although it was partially reorganized as an armoured division, with one armoured and one motor brigade.\n\n417. Headquarters 3rd Aust. Armoured Division, 1943: Auth. GRO 165/1943, 19.2.1943. Raised by redesignation of HQ 1st Aust. Motor Division, and comprised the 2nd Armoured and 1st Motor Brigades. Note: A complete scheme of colour patches, less those for the provost company and salvage unit, was submitted for this division during September and October 1942. It is believed that they were actually approved and supplied well prior to the promulgation of GRO 165/1943.\n\n418. Headquarters 1st Division, 1921-1942;\n\nHeadquarters 1st Aust. Division, 1942-1945: Auth. SO Clothing Pt 111, 1922. Functioned as HQ Sydney-Kembla Covering Force during 1941-1942.

SO Clothing Pt 111, 1922. Raised in Victoria and South Australia in 1921 as a CMF formation, comprising the 2nd, 3rd, and 6th Brigades. Disbanded in September 1944.\n\n422. Headquarters 5th Division, 1921-1927; and\n\nHeadquarters 5th Aust. Division, 1942-1945: Auth. SO Clothing Pt 111, 1922. Raised in 1921, functioning as HQ 13th Mixed Brigade. It ceased to exist *in August 1927 when HQ 13th Mixed Brigade was redesignated Headquarters, Field Troops, 5th Military District, and was not re-raised until April 1942 when HQ Northern Command was redesignated HQ 5th Division. Note: The 5th Division, as a formation, did not exist prior to 1942 but was intended to be raised on mobilization from 11th Mixed Brigade, and Field Troops, 5th and 6th Military Districts. When it was eventually formed however it comprised the 7th, 11th, and 29th Brigades, all raised in Queensland.\n\n423. Headquarters 6th Aust. Division, 1939-1946: Ref MGO Branch Line Drawings,p.2. Raised in September 1939 as a formation of the 2nd AIF, initially comprising the l6th, 17th, and 18th Brigades.\n\n424. Headquarters 7th Aust. Division, 1940-1946; and\n\nHQ AMF Rear Details, Balikpapan, 1946: Ref. MGO Branch Line Drawings, p.2. Raised in May 1940 as a formation of the 2nd AIF, initially comprising the 19th, 20th, and 21st Brigades.\n\n425. Headquarters 8th Aust. Division, 1940-1945: Ref MGO Branch Line Drawings, p.2. Raised in July 1940 as a formation of the 2nd AIF, initially comprising the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th Brigades. Functioned in addition as HQ AIF Malaya during 1941 to 1942 and was captured in Singapore in February 1942.\n\n426.

Raised in October 1940 from personnel of HQ AIF in UK, and initially comprised the 18th and 25th Brigades. Superseded by No. 427 in December 1942.\n\n427. Headquarters 9th Aust. Division, 1942-1946; and\n\nHQ AMF Details, Labuan, 1946: Auth. GRO 225/1943, 12.3.1943. The 'T' shaped colour patch designed for this division stood for Tobruk although this was not admitted by its instigator, Lt.-Gen. Sir L. J. Morsehead, until 1952. (Letter, L. J. Morsehead to A. W. Bazley, 25.2.1952.) After the relief of the 9th Division from Tobruk he had decided that the units of the division should wear a common shape, but that as all other simple shapes had long since been allotted to other formations, he had settled on a combination of two oblongs, the larger one on top. Colour patches approved under this scheme were first issued on 17.12.1942, (Tobruk and El Alamein, Barton Maughan, p.750-1.) and LHQ was informed of the change by HQ AIF(ME) Memo No. 14973, dated 22.1.1943.\n\n428. Headquarters 10th Aust. Division: There is no particular evidence that this patch was ever issued, although provisional approval would appear to have been granted by 13.5.1942 and it appears in colour plates undertaken after that date. (AA(Vic): MP 508/1, item 36/702/136.) It however had been deleted prior to the promulgation of the authorities for formation headquarters appearing in GRO 149/1942. This unit had been raised as HQ Newcastle Covering Force in September 1941 and was redesignated in April 1942, comprising at that stage the 1st and 32nd Brigades. It was disbanded over the period July/September 1942.\n\n429. Headquarters 11th Aust. Division, 1943-1946: Auth. GRO 468/1943, 18.6.1943.

Army Tank Battalion, 1942: Ref. RAAC Museum, Puckapunyal. Raised in March 1941 by expansion of 1st Light Tank Company, Aust. Tank Corps, and was transferred to the Aust. Armoured Corps in May 1942.\n\nNote: A series of paintings of Australian Armoured Corps unit colour patches held in the RAAC Tank Museum at Puckapunyal suggests that the 2nd Armoured Regiment wore brown to the front, and that 2nd Light Tank Company wore brown to the top (see No. 1113). It has not been possible to confirm either design. The colours brown, red and green, in that order, are those of the Royal Tank Corps, which when flown horizontally as a flag always have green to the top, and as currently worn by its successor, the Royal Tank Regiment, on shoulder slides, are arranged vertically with brown to the front.\n\n476.

Division in September 1943 and was disbanded in September 1944. Note: The first authority for the change in the colour patches of this brigade was given by the GOC 1st Aust. Armoured Division in November 1942.(See Note 90) At that stage official policy was that colour patches allotted to specific units would not be changed on transfer to another formation, in this case from 2nd Aust. Motor Division to 1st Aust. Armoured Division. LHQ, when they were belatedly informed of the change in late May 1943, varied this policy for 3rd Aust. Motor\n\nBrigade because it involved only an alteration in the manner in which the existing colour patches were worn.\n\nNote 90.

Motor Regiment, 1942-1943: Auth. GRO 301/1942, 7.8.1942. Allotted to the 6th Aust. Armoured Brigade. Disbanded in April 1943. It is believed that these colours, traditionally those of the 3rd Light Horse Regiment, were allotted because the 9th Motor Regiment was formed after unlinking from the former 9th/23rd Light Horse Regiment by the transfer to it on 6.1.1942 of the majority of personnel of the 3rd Light Horse Regiment.\n\n497. 15th Aust.

Motor Regiment, 1943-1944: Ref. MGO Branch Line Drawings, p.26. No official authority has been located for this colour patch, which is believed to have been issued to the regiment soon after their transfer to 1st Aust. Armoured Brigade Group in February 1943. Examples exist of both NSW and WA manufacture. The unit was disbanded on 12th October 1944.\n\n499. 17th Aust. Motor Regiment, 1942-1943: Auth. LHQ (MGO) Memo No. 59218, 9.6.1942.

This unit was originally reorganized to provide an administrative headquarters for the seven existing independent companies, and as such had submitted a design of colour patch for approval which comprised a double diamond in cavalry colours. This was rejected by LHQ who directed that regimental headquarters would wear the LHQ colour patch. (LHQ (CGS) Memo No. 90863, 3.6.1943. AA(Vic.): MP 742/1, item 61/13/72.) After further consideration this colour patch was approved to replace all existing patches worn by RHQ and the independent companies. The regiment was reorganized from late 1943 to comprise the 2/3rd, 2/5th, and 2/6th Aust. Commando Squadrons, all of which wore No. 503.\n\n504. 8th Aust. Divisional Cavalry.
