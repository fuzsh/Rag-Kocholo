        "text": "25th Australian Infantry Battalion\n\nBattalion details at a glance: Origin State: Queensland Division: 2nd Australian Infantry Division Brigade: 7th Infantry Brigade Commanders: Lieutenant Colonel H. Goddard\n\nLieutenant Colonel D.D. Dawson\n\nLieutenant Colonel J. Paton\n\nLieutenant Colonel J. Walker\n\nLieutenant Colonel D.D. Dawson\n\nLieutenant Colonel J. Walker\n\nLieutenant Colonel E.C. Norrie\n\nLieutenant Colonel F.L. Dawson\n\nThe Battalion sailed at 11am on 29 June aboard the S.S. Aeneas. This ship belonged to the Blue Funnel Line. Of the 1,700 men on board, 29 officers and 976 men belong to the 25th Battalion. The S.S. Aeneas arrived off Sydney on 1 July and berthed at Woolloomooloo. The Battalion spent the next few days billeted at the Sydney Showground before sailing from Sydney on 7 July aboard the S.S. Aeneas.\n\nThe Battalion arrived at the Suez on 29 July and on the 4th August 1915 (the anniversary of the start of the war) the battalion finally stepped ashore onto foreign soil. During the voyage the Battalion's records show the deaths of four men due to illness.\n\nOn the 24th August the Battalion's corps letters and numerals were withdrawn and replaced with the colour patches. The patch for the 25th Battalion is black over blue in the diamond shape of the 2nd Division. This patch was worn in WW2 by the 2/25th Battalion and is currently worn by 25th Battalion, Royal Queensland Regiment.\n\nThe Battalion arrived and landed at Gallipoli on 11 September 1915. During the landing only one man was injured, Pte Walter Fulcher was hit in the knee by a stray bullet.\n\nThe first officer killed was Lt Archibald Auchterlonie on 20 October when he was shot through the head. Lt Auchterlonie was a 23-year-old civil servant from Gympie, Queensland\n\nUpon receiving their order to disband in 1918, and to merge with other battalions, the men of the 25th Battalion asked for the most dangerous task in the next battle. After the fighting, they said, there would either be no 25th Battalion left or they would create such a legend that no one would ever dare to disband it.\n\nAt the conclusion of the war, the Battalion returned home and was redesignated a Citizen Military Forces Unit.\n\n25th Battalion\n\nThe 25th Battalion was raised at Enoggera in Queensland in March 1915 as part of the 7th Brigade. Although predominantly composed of men recruited in Queensland, the battalion also included a small contingent of men from Darwin. The battalion left Australia in early July, trained in Egypt during August, and by early September was manning trenches at Gallipoli.\n\nAt Gallipoli the 7th Brigade reinforced the depleted New Zealand and Australian Division. The 25th Battalion, however, had a relatively quiet time because the last major Allied offensive had been launched, and turned back, in the previous month. It left the peninsular on 18 December 1915.\n\nAfter further training in Egypt, the 25th Battalion proceeded to France. Landing on 19 March 1916, it was the first AIF battalion to arrive there. Now fighting as part of the 2nd Division, it took part in its first major battle at Pozières between 25 July and 7 August in the course of which it suffered 785 casualties. After a spell in a quieter sector of the front in Belgium, the 2nd Division came south in October to attack again in the Somme Valley. The 25th Battalion took part in two attacks to the east of Flers, both of which floundered in the mud.\n\nAlthough it acted in a supporting role at the second battle of Bullecourt, the 25th Battalion did not carry out a major offensive role again until 20 September 1917, when it was part of the 2nd Divisions first wave at the battle of Menin Road in Belgium. Victory here was followed up with the capture of Broodseinde Ridge on 4 October. The 25th reprised its role from Menin Road, in what was its last large-scale offensive action for the year.\n\n1918 was an exhausting year for the 25th Battalion. It fought to turn back the German spring offensive in April, and then participated in battles at Morlancourt, Hamel, Amiens and along the Somme Valley as the German Army was pushed ever closer to defeat. These actions sapped the strength of the AIF, already terribly weak due to earlier casualties and lack of reinforcements. In September, the 25th was one of several battalions ordered to disband to reinforce others. Its troops mutinied, winning the Battalion a temporary reprieve.\n\nThe battalion went into the line one last time on 3 October 1918 and took part in a successful attack to break through the German defences around Beaurevoir. It was disbanded nine days later.
