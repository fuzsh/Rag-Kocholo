        "text": "Tom Abke\n\nThe Australian Army is set to relocate almost 1,000 personnel from the nation’s south to its north in the force’s most extensive restructuring in over a decade. The move, announced by the Australian government in September 2023, aims to fortify the nation’s preparedness for potential conflicts in the Indo-Pacific.\n\nThe Defence Strategic Review, released in early 2023 by the Australian Defence Department, known as Defence, emphasized the need for a more focused force that is better suited to address the mounting geostrategic tensions, particularly concerning the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) posture in the region.\n\n“China’s assertion of sovereignty over the South China Sea threatens the global rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific in a way that adversely impacts Australia’s national interests,” the review stated.\n\nTo align with the review’s recommendations, Defence is implementing key adjustments in Army units and formations, including a transition from generalist combat brigades to more specialized combat brigades. The changes seek to strengthen the Army’s capabilities, preparedness and power projection.\n\nUnder the new arrangements, the Army’s 1st Brigade, based in Darwin in the Northern Territory, will become a light combat brigade, well-suited for the littoral environment. Meanwhile, the 3rd Brigade, headquartered in Townsville, Queensland, is set to transform into an armored combat brigade specialized for amphibious operations. The transformation aligns with the Royal Australian Navy’s mission to secure critical terrain. The 7th Brigade, based in Brisbane, Queensland, will shift to a motorized combat brigade capable of rapid deployment by air and sea to address regional contingencies.\n\nMoreover, the Australian Army is reestablishing the 10th Brigade, based in Adelaide, South Australia, to serve as a “fires brigade.” The brigade’s troop numbers are expected to increase gradually alongside the arrival of the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) from the United States.\n\n“The change is about organizing the Army to train as we would fight and making the most of the resources we have been assigned,” acting Chief of Army Maj. Gen. Richard Vagg said in a statement.\n\nTownsville also will become a hub for armored vehicles and Army attack and medium-lift aviation, while Brisbane will be the base for a motorized combat brigade, enhancing personnel uplift and movement capabilities, Defence reported. Adjustments to the Darwin-based brigade will emphasize light forces that can adapt and move quickly. Adelaide will become a hub for long-range strike capabilities, and integrated air and missile defense systems.\n\n“This will mean [the] Army has a concentration of people and capabilities in Australia’s north, making it easier to deploy for training, major exercises, or to support our partners and allies in the region,” Defence Minister Richard Marles said in a statement.\n\nThe restructuring is expected to span several personnel posting cycles over five to six years. The personnel relocations are set to begin in 2025 and align with equipment deliveries.\n\nThe changes reflect a broader reconfiguration of forces by Allies and Partners, including Japan and the Philippines, prompted by the region’s changing security situation, Gen. Charles Flynn, commanding general of U.S. Army Pacific, told the U.S. Naval Institute recently.\n\n“These countries are defined by the armies that protect their territorial integrity and their national sovereignty,” Flynn said. “The security architecture that actually binds the Pacific together is land power, is land forces.”\n\nTom Abke is a FORUM correspondent reporting from Singapore."
