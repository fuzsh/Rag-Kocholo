        "text": "39th Operational Support Battalion – Origins\n\nThe 39th Battalion was restored to the Australian Army Order of Battle on the 8th of August 2006. The significance of the date is the day in which the members of the 39th Battalion Association claim to be the true Kokoda Day, corresponding with the day the unit re-captured Kokoda from the Japanese, albeit briefly. This was the only time that Kokoda itself, the village that became synonymous with the campaign, was ever fought for by Australian forces and is why the Association celebrate Kokoda Day in August as opposed to November each year. 63 years after the 39th Battalion was disbanded on the 3rd of July 1943, and thanks to extensive lobbying by the 39th Battalion Association to the then Governor General of Australia, Major General, the Honourable, Michael Jeffery, AC, AO (Mil), CVO, MC (Ret’d), the unit was once again reinstated to answer the call.\n\nThe event was a significant occasion, marked by a ceremonial parade conducted at the Shrine of Remembrance, Melbourne. The Reviewing Officer was Major General the Honourable Michael Jeffery, AC, AO (Mil), CVO, MC (Ret’d). Distinguished guests included: Chief of Army, LTGEN Peter Leahy AC, 39th Infantry Battalion Association President Mr Alan Moore and surviving members of the 39th Infantry Battalion. More than 500 people attended the ceremony, with more than 50 veterans of KOKODA accompanied by many family members and one of the original Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels, Mr Frederick Soka, flown down from PNG as an honoured guest. This occurred on the sixty-fourth anniversary of the successful attack by the 39th Australian Infantry Battalion to re-capture Kokoda.\n\nLTGEN Peter Leahy AC (Ret’d,) the Chief of Army during the period 2002- 2008, raised the Battalion due to the increased operational tempo at the time and the requirement of Army to prepare for a new era of deployments. He also acknowledged that the emblematic name of the 39th was given to this new unit to honour the legacy of the 39th Infantry Battalion which was disbanded in 1943. The Chief of Army and the Governor General both felt that it was particularly appropriate to pass on the number of the 39th to a force preparation unit because of the limited force preparation given to the 39th Infantry Battalion when it was reformed in October 1941 before their deployment to Port Moresby in January 1942.\n\nEXERCISE KANGA’S RETURN\n\nInitial concept 2017\n\nOver the period 05-15 Aug 2017, 39 OSB conducted a trek of the KOKODA TRAIL to commemorate the 39th Battalions actions in Papua New Guinea (PNG). The activity was called Ex Kanga’s Return 17 (Ex KR 17). The Exercise was named after Alan ‘Kanga’ Moore, a 39th Battalion veteran. The key objectives of Ex KR 17 was to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the 39th Infantry Battalion actions in PNG, as well as provide a professional development opportunity for participating members.\n\nA combined team of 29 personnel, including 23 from 39 OSB and 6 from Army Headquarters, departed Australia on 5 August bound for Port Moresby. After an overnight stay at Sogeri Lodge, the trekkers then boarded charter aircraft for Kokoda. The local population had a special welcome for the group including traditional dancers and the opportunity to visit the Kokoda memorial and museum. The memorial houses an honour roll of the 39th Infantry Battalion.\n\nEach day along the track, Peter Morrison, one of the PNG guides, provided in-depth knowledge of battles and the personal sacrifice experienced by the men of the 39th Infantry Battalion while fighting the Japanese. Members of 39OSB had been paired up before they departed Australia and were given an historic topic to brief during the exercise. These were delivered at the end of each day by one of the pairs.\n\nThe people of PNG knew that 39th Infantry Battalion personnel were walking the track and every village came out to see the trekkers when they arrived in their location. The link between Australia and PNG is strong. The carriers provided for the Kokoda Trail walk were descendants of the Fuzzy Wuzzy Angels who played such an important role in World War 2. To be a carrier on the track is still today, one of the most honourable things a native of PNG can do. It is very important to their culture. On Exercise Kanga, all members of 39 OSB carried education resources and to give to the villages as they passed through them.\n\nA tour highlight was the conduct of the dawn service at Isurava, including the site where Private Bruce Kingsbury (2/14th Battalion) earned a posthumous Victoria Cross. The words on the four pillars-Courage, Endurance, Mateship and Sacrifice embody the characteristics of the brave men that fought at Isurava.\n\nEnduring connection\n\nDespite being an annual activity since 2017 to send two people per year to walk the Kokoda Track, the impact of COVID-19 meant that the activity had not been conducted for some years. In 2022, 39 OSB planned and executed Ex Kanga’s Return 22 (Ex KR 22), leading a combined contingent of 39 OSB and other Army unit personnel across the Kokoda Track. Ex KR 22 was a significant milestone as it commemorated the 80th anniversary of the Kokoda Campaign. It also included a ceremony to scatter ashes of the last surviving officer of the original 39th Infantry Battalion, Alan ‘Kanga’ Moore, who passed away in 2021. The activity was an amazing experience for those who went and gave way to the idea of shaping Ex KR into an enduring activity focussed towards junior leaders across Army.\n\nEx KR is now an annual event that is part of the Olgetta Warrior series of engagements with the PNGDF each year. The concept is for the annual Ex KR to be 39 OSB planned and led, which aims to include junior leaders from across Army as a leadership development activity. The Kokoda campaign contains many examples of exceptional leadership during times of hardship, danger and stress. The exposure of junior leaders to the arduous conditions of the Kokoda Trek, coupled with the historical and military context, will positively shape their leadership while also exposing them to the region. The target audience for Ex KR are JNCOs / LTs who demonstrate strong leadership potential and have performed to a high standard.\n\nEx KR will occur annually over 12 days in the period late July to early September. This will facilitate stronger historical relevance as the trek will occur around the dates of key battles involving the 39th Infantry Battalion including the Battles of Deniki and Isurava, as well as the AIF stand at Brigade Hill. The activity will also include 1 – 2 days either side of the trek in Port Moresby to allow for a commemorative service at Bomana War Cemetery and to visit other key historical sites. It is intended that this enduring connection will keep the legacy of the 39th Infantry Battalion alive and well into the future."
