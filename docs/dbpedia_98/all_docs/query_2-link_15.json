        "text": "The effect of slab touchdown on anticrack arrest in propagation saw tests\n\nPhilipp L. Rosendahl, Johannes Schneider, GrÃ©goire Bobillier, Florian Rheinschmidt, Bastian Bergfeld, Alec van Herwijnen, and Philipp WeiÃgraeber\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-122,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-122, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur research investigates the role of anticracks in snowpacks and their impact on avalanche formation, focusing on anticracks due to weak layer collapse. We discovered that slab touchdown on the snow below the weak layer decreases the energy available for crack propagation, potentially leading to a stop of crack propagation. This underscores the importance of mechanical interactions in snowpack stability. Our work offers new insights for enhancing avalanche prediction and mitigation strategies.\n\nThe 1538 eruption at Campi Flegrei resurgent caldera: implications for future unrest and eruptive scenarios\n\nGiuseppe Rolandi, Claudia Troise, Marco Sacchi, Massimo Di Lascio, and Giuseppe De Natale\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2035,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2035, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe compare recent unrest episodes at Campi Flegrei caldera (Naples, Italy), with phenomena occurred during the historical eruption in 1538. Besides proposing a new, accurate reconstruction of the ground movements in the area since VIII century BC, we deduce a striking similarity of the present unrest with the precursors to the 1538 eruption. We then infer that, if the ground uplift continues, earthquakes up to magnitude 5 are expected, as well as a considerable eruption risk in the next decades.\n\nReview article: Understanding the placement of fire emissions from the Brazilian Cerrado biome in the atmospheric carbon budget\n\nRenata Moura da Veiga, Celso von Randow, Chantelle Burton, Douglas Kelley, Manoel Cardoso, and Fabiano Morelli\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2348,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2348, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe systematically reviewed 69 papers on fire emissions from the Brazilian Cerrado biome to provide insights into its placement in the atmospheric carbon budget and support future improved estimation. We find that estimating fire emissions in the Cerrado requires a comprehensive approach, combining quantitative and qualitative aspects of fire. A pathway towards this is the inclusion of fire management representation in land surface models and the integration of observational and modelling data.\n\nAssessing the performance and explainability of an avalanche danger forecast model\n\nCristina PÃ©rez-GuillÃ©n, Frank Techel, Michele Volpi, and Alec van Herwijnen\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2374,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2374, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study assesses the performance and explainability of a random forest classifier for predicting dry-snow avalanche danger levels during initial live-testing. The model achieved ∼70 % agreement with human forecasts, performing equally well in nowcast and forecast modes, while capturing the temporal dynamics of avalanche forecasting. The explainability approach enhances the transparency of the model's decision-making process, providing a valuable tool for operational avalanche forecasting.\n\nFlood relief logistics planning for coastal cities: a case study in Shanghai, China\n\nPujun Liang, Jie Yin, Dandan Wang, Yi Lu, Yuhan Yang, Dan Gao, and Jianfeng Mai\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-88,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-88, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAddressing coastal city flood risks, this article examines relief logistics planning, employing a GIS-network analysis and optimization model to minimize costs and dissatisfaction. The investigation, grounded in Shanghai's emergency infrastructure and flood relief logistics framework, presents feasible distribution strategies. Meanwhile, the case study indicates that the supply levels of Emergency Flood Shelters and Emergency Reserve Warehouses vary in different coastal flood scenarios.\n\nComparative Analysis of μ (I) and Voellmy-Type Grain Flow Rheologies in Geophysical Mass Flows: Insights from Theoretical and Real Case Studies\n\nYu Zhuang, Brian W. McArdell, and Perry Bartelt\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-87,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-87, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study reformulates the μ(I) rheology into a Voellmy-type relationship to elucidate its physical implications. The μ(I) rheology, incorporating a dimensionless inertial number, mimics granular temperature effects, reflecting shear thinning behavior of mass flows. However, its constant Coulomb friction coefficient limits accuracy in modeling deposition. Comparing μ(I) with Voellmy-type rheologies reveals strengths and limitations, enhancing mass flow modeling and engineering applications.\n\nHas it really stopped? Interplay between rheology, topography and mesh resolution in numerical modelling of snow avalanches\n\nSaoirse Robin Goodwin, Thierry Faug, and Guillaume Chambon\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-123,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-123, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper considers how we can objectivity define stoppage of numerically-modelled snow avalanches. When modelling real topographies, numerically-modelled avalanche snow velocities typically do not converge to 0, so stoppage is defined with arbitrary criteria, which must be tuned on a case-by-case basis. We propose a new objective arrest criterion based on local flow properties, in tandem with a newly-implemented physical yielding criterion.\n\nBrief Communication: Training of AI-based nowcasting models for rainfall early warning should take into account user requirements\n\nGeorgy Ayzel and Maik Heistermann\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1945,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1945, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nForecasting rainfall over the next hour is an essential feature of early warning systems. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful alternative to conventional nowcasting technologies, but it still struggles to adequately predict impact-relevant heavy rainfall. We think that DL could do much better if the training tasks were defined more specifically, and that such a specification presents an opportunity to better align the output of nowcasting models with actual user requirements.\n\nReview article: Co-creating knowledge for drought impact assessment in socio-hydrology\n\nSilvia De Angeli, Lorenzo Villani, Giulio Castelli, Maria Rusca, Giorgio Boni, Elena Bresci, and Luigi Piemontese\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2207,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2207, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDespite droughts are deeply intertwined within sociohydrological systems, traditional top-down approaches often ignore those directly affected. By integrating insights from five research fields, we present a framework to guide the co-creation of knowledge for drought impact assessment. Emphasizing social dynamics and power imbalances, the framework guides a more inclusive approach to drought assessment and adaptation.\n\nEstimating the mass of tephra accumulated on roads to best manage the impact of volcanic eruptions: the example of Mt. Etna, Italy\n\nLuigi Mereu, Manuel Stocchi, Alexander Garcia, Michele Prestifilippo, Laura Sandri, Costanza Bonadonna, and Simona Scollo\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2028,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2028, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nConsidering the question about the quantification of tephra mass deposited on roads following an or a series of explosive volcanic eruptions, in this work we assessed the cumulated tephra mass on the road networks in three selected towns on Etna’s eastern flank during several paroxysms in 2021. This is a first attempt to estimate the amount of tephra that must be removed during a crisis and could be reused instead of disposed, converting in this way a potential problem into an opportunity.\n\nWhat can we learn from global disaster records about multi-hazards and their risk dynamics?\n\nWiebke S. JÃ¤ger, Marleen C. de Ruiter, Timothy Tiggeloven, and Philip J. Ward\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-134,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-134, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMultiple hazards, occurring at the same time or shortly after one another, can have more extreme impacts than single hazards. We examined the disaster records in the global emergency events database EM-DAT to better understand this phenomenon. We developed a method to identify such multi-hazards and analyzed their reported impacts using statistics. Multi-hazards have accounted for a disproportionate amount of the overall impacts, but there are different patterns in which the impacts compound.\n\nCauses of the exceptionally high number of fatalities in the Ahr valley, Germany, during the 2021 flood\n\nBelinda Rhein and Heidi Kreibich\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2066,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2066, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe 2021 flood killed 190 people in Germany, 134 of them in the Ahr valley, making it the deadliest flood in recent German history. The flash flood was extreme in terms of water levels, flow velocities and flood extent, early warning and evacuation were inadequate. Many died on the ground floor or in the street, with older and impaired individuals especially vulnerable. Clear warnings should urge people to seek safety rather than save belongings, and timely evacuations are essential.\n\nFrom rockfall source areas identification to susceptibility zonation: a proposed workflow tested in El Hierro (Canary Islands, Spain)\n\nRoberto Sarro, Mauro Rossi, Paola Reichenbach, and Rosa MarÃ­a Mateos\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-85,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-85, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study proposes a novel workflow to precisely model rockfalls. It compares three methods for defining source areas to enhance model accuracy. Identified areas are inputted into a runout model to identify vulnerable zones. A new approach generates probabilistic susceptibility maps using ECDFs. Validation strategies employing various inventory types are included. Comparing six susceptibility maps highlights the impact of source area definition on model precision.\n\nKinetic characteristics investigation of the Yingxingping rockslide based on discrete element method combined with discrete fracture network\n\nBo Liu, Yufang Zhang, Xiewen Hu, Jian Li, Kun Yuan, Kun He, Jian Cui, and Zhenhua Yin\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2216,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2216, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study focused on a catastrophic post-earthquake rockslide in Wenchuan, Southwestern China. On-site investigations and aerial photography were used to ascertained the basic landslides characteristics. A 3D discrete element method with discrete fracture network was employed to assess the dynamic process of the rockslide. The effects of fractures density and friction angle on kinetic characteristics were analysed, and the role of the check dam as a mitigation work has been verified.\n\nBrief Communication: Stay local or go global? On the construction of plausible counterfactual scenarios to assess flash flood hazards\n\nPaul Voit and Maik Heistermann\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-119,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-119, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFloods have caused significant damage in the past. To prepare for such events, we rely on historical data, but face issues due to rare rainfall events, lack of data, and climate change. Counterfactuals, or \"what if\" scenarios, simulate historical rainfall in different locations to estimate flood levels. Our new study refines this by deriving more plausible local scenarios, using the June 2024 Bavaria flood as a case study. This method could improve future flood preparation.\n\nThe Record-Breaking Precipitation Event of December 2022 in Portugal\n\nTiago M. Ferreira, Ricardo M. Trigo, TomÃ¡s H. Gaspar, Joaquim G. Pinto, and Alexandre M. Ramos\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-130,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-130, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHere we investigate the synoptic evolution associated with the occurrence of an atmospheric river leading to a 24 h record-breaking extreme precipitation event (120.3 mm) in Lisbon, Portugal, on 13 December 2022. The synoptic background allowed the formation, on 10 December, of an atmospheric river associated with a deep extratropical cyclone and with a high moisture content and an inflow of moisture, due to the warm conveyor belt, throughout its life cycle. The system made landfall on day 12.\n\nExploring implications of input parameter uncertainties on GLOF modelling results using the state-of-the-art modelling code, r.avaflow\n\nSonam Rinzin, Stuart Dunning, Rachel Carr, Ashim Sattar, and Martin Mergili\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1819,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1819, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe evaluated the sensitivity of model outputs to input parameter uncertainties by performing multiple GLOF simulations using the r.avaflow model. We found out that GLOF modelling outputs are highly sensitive to six parameters: volume of mass movements entering lakes, DEM datasets, origin of mass movements, mesh size, basal frictional angle, and entrainment coefficient. Future modelling should carefully consider the output uncertainty from these sensitive parameters.\n\nDynamics and Impacts of Monsoon-Induced Geological Hazards: A 2022 Flood Study along the Swat River in Pakistan\n\nNazir Ahmed Bazai, Mehtab Alam, Peng Cui, Wang Hao, Adil Poshad Khan, Muhammad Waseem, Yao Shunyu, Muhammad Ramzan, Li Wanhong, and Tashfain Ahmed\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-95,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-95, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study examines the 2022 monsoon in the Swat River basin, Pakistan, where record rainfall exceeded averages by 7–8 %, causing catastrophic debris flows and floods. These events worsened challenges for low-income communities, resulting in extensive damage and financial instability. Field investigations, remote sensing, and simulations identified deforestation and steep topography as key factors. The study advocates for disaster mitigation, reforestation, and better land use planning.\n\nUnravelling the capacity-action gap in flood risk adaptation\n\nAnnika Schubert, Anne von Streit, and Matthias Garschagen\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-121,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-121, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: open, 2 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHouseholds play a crucial role in climate adaptation efforts. Yet, households require capacities to implement measures. We explore which capacities enable German households to adapt to flooding. Our results indicate that flood-related capacities such as risk perception, responsibility appraisal and motivation are pivotal, whereas financial assets are secondary. Enhancing these specific capacities, e.g. through collaborations between households and municipalities, could promote local adaptation.\n\nPrediction of volume of shallow landslides due to rainfall using data-driven models\n\nJÃ©rÃ©mie Tuganishuri, Chan-Young Yune, Manik Das Adhikari, Seung Woo Lee, Gihong Kim, and Sang-Guk Yum\n\nNat.

Analyzing the Chi-Chi earthquake in Taiwan, we find that lower income and a higher indigenous population at migrants' origins are correlated with higher fatalities at their destinations. This underscores the need for affordable and safe housing in the outskirts of megacities, where migrants from lower-income and historically marginalized groups are more likely to reside due to precarious employment conditions.\n\nModeling Seismic Hazard and Landslide Potentials in Northwestern Yunnan, China: Exploring Complex Fault Systems with multi-segment rupturing in a Block Rotational Tectonic Zone\n\nJia Cheng, Chong Xu, Xiwei Xu, Shimin Zhang, and Pengyu Zhu\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci.

This article introduces a new seismic hazard model, which integrates fault slip parameters to assess the risks associated with multi-segment ruptures. The results reveal the intricate relationship between these ruptures and the regional small block rotation induced by regional low-crustal flow and gravitational collapse.\n\nSatellite-based data for agricultural index insurance: a systematic quantitative literature review\n\nThuy T.

Despite the increasing number of studies since 2010 to present, the review revealed a gap in applying the approach to perennial crops in developing countries. We also highlighted the growing importance of satellite data for index insurance, employing high-resolution datasets to reduce basis risk.\n\nFlood exposure of environmental assets\n\nGabriele Bertoli, Chiara Arrighi, and Enrica Caporali\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci.

Assessing their flood risk is thus seminal, besides required by several norms. Even though, this field is not yet sufficiently developed. We explored the exposure component of the flood risk, and developed an evaluating methodology based on the ecosystem services provided by the environmental assets, to discern assets and areas more important than others with metrics suitable to large scale studies.\n\nAssimilation of temperature and relative humidity observations from personal weather stations in AROME-France\n\nAlan Demortier, Marc Mandement, Vivien Pourret, and Olivier Caumont\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1673,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1673, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: open, 0 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe use of numerical weather prediction models enables the forecasting of hazardous weather situations. The incorporation of new temperature and relative humidity observations from personal weather stations into the French limited-area model is evaluated in this study. This leads to the improvement of the associated near-surface variables of the model during the first hours of the forecast. Examples are provided for a sea breeze case during a heatwave and a fog episode.\n\nMid-field tsunami hazards in greater Karachi from seven hypothetical ruptures of the Makran subduction thrust\n\nHaider Hasan, Hira Ashfaq Lodhi, Shoaib Ahmed, Shahrukh Khan, Adnan Rais, and Muhammad Masood Rafi\n\nNat.

Karachi Port is at higher immediate risk. We conducted this research to understand the city's vulnerability to tsunamis from the Makran Subduction Zone and to improve emergency response plans. Using simulations of seven potential earthquake scenarios, we highlight the need for tailored disaster strategies and effective early warning systems to protect coastal communities.\n\nHow does perceived heat stress differ between urban forms and human vulnerability profiles? – case study Berlin\n\nNimra Iqbal, Marvin Ravan, Zina Mitraka, Joern Birkmann, Sue Grimmond, Denise Hertwig, Nektarios Chrysoulakis, Giorgos Somarakis, and Angela Wendnagel-Beck\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1907,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1907, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work deepens the understanding of how perceived heat stress, human vulnerability (e.g. age, income) and adaptive capacities (e.g. green, shaded spaces) are coupled with urban structures. The results show that perceived heat stress decreases with distance from urban center, however, human vulnerability and adaptive capacities depend stronger on inner-variations and differences between urban structures. Planning policies and adaptation strategies should account for these differences.\n\nAssessment of coastal inundation triggered by multiple drivers in Ca Mau Peninsula, Vietnam\n\nHung Nghia Nguyen, Quan Quan Le, Dung Viet Nguyen, Tan Hong Cao, Toan Quang To, Hai Do Dac, Melissa Wood, and Ivan D.

To overcome this, we have developed an automated approach that uses UAV acquired optical images and deep learning to rapidly generate spatial building damage information.\n\nA regional analysis of paraglacial landslide activation in southern coastal Alaska\n\nJane Walden, MylÃ¨ne Jacquemart, Bretwood Higman, Romain Hugonnet, Andrea Manconi, and Daniel Farinotti\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1086,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1086, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: final response, 2 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn a study of eight landslides adjacent to glaciers in Alaska, we found that landslide movement increased as the glacier retreated past the landslide at four sites. Movement at other sites coincided with heavy precipitation or increased glacier thinning, and two sites showed little-to-no motion. We suggest that landslides next to water-terminating glaciers may be especially vulnerable to acceleration, which we guess is due to faster retreat rates and water replacing ice at the landslide edge.\n\nAn appraisal of the value of simulated weather data for quantifying coastal flood hazard in the Netherlands\n\nCees de Valk and Henk van den Brink\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-912,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-912, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRecently updated flood safety norms in the Netherlands prescribe that sea dikes and other flood-protecting structures should withstand high sea levels reached very rarely, locally down to only once in 10 million years.

By utilizing geodetic strain rate maps for Europe and the ESHM20 source model, we compare geodetic and seismic moment rates across the continent while addressing associated uncertainties. Our analysis reveals primary compatibility in high-activity zones. In well-constrained regions of lower activity, we also observed an overlap in the distribution of seismic and geodetic moments.\n\nA multiscale modelling framework of coastal flooding events for global to local flood hazard assessments\n\nIrene Benito, Jeroen C.

We present a multiscale framework that couples dynamic water level and flood models, and bridges between fully global and local modelling approaches. We apply it to three storms to present the merits of a multiscale approach. Our findings reveal that the importance of model refinements varies based on the study area characteristics and the storm’s nature.\n\nModelling Current and Future Forest Fire Susceptibility in north-east Germany\n\nKatharina Heike Horn, Stenka Vulova, Hanyu Li, and Birgit Kleinschmit\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1380,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1380, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study we applied Random Forest machine learning algorithm to model current and future forest fire susceptibility (FFS) in north-east Germany using anthropogenic, climatic, topographic, soil, and vegetation variables. Model accuracy ranged between 69 % to 71 % showing a moderately high model reliability for predicting FFS. The model results underline the importance of anthropogenic and vegetation parameters for FFS.

Traditional models often overlook how these hazards can interact and worsen each other's effects. By applying our method to the 2015 Nepal earthquake, we successfully demonstrated its ability to predict broad damage patterns, despite slightly overestimating impacts. Being able to anticipate the effects of complex, interconnected hazards is critical for disaster preparedness.\n\nUnbalanced relationship between flood risk perception and flood preparedness from the perspective of response intention and socio-economic factors: a case study of Nanjing, China\n\nYabo Li and Peng Wang\n\nNat.

Still, the amount of water needed for sustainable flows remains unclear and contested. A comparison of two streams in the Berlin-Brandenburg region of NE Germany, using stable water isotopes, shows strong groundwater dependence with seasonal rainfall contributing to high/low flows. Understanding streamflow variability can help assess the impacts of climate change on future water resource management.\n\nExamining the Eastern European heatwave of 2023 from a long-term perspective: the role of natural variability vs. anthropogenic factors\n\nMonica Ionita, Petru Vaideanu, Bogdan Antonescu, Catalin Roibu, Qiyun Ma, and Viorica Nagavciuc\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1207,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1207, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEastern Europe's heatwave history is explored from 1885 to 2023, with a focus on pre-1960 events. The study reveals two periods with more frequent and intense heatwaves (HW): 1920s–1960s and 1980s–present. The research highlights the importance of a long-term perspective, revealing that extreme heat events have occurred throughout the entire study period and it emphasizes the combined influence of climate change and natural variations on increasing HW severity.\n\nUsing seasonal forecasts to enhance our understanding of extreme European windstorm impacts\n\nJacob William Maddison, Jennifer Louise Catto, Sandra Hansen, Ching Ho Justin Ng, and Stefan Siegert\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-686,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-686, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: final response, 5 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this work we estimate the impact of the most extreme European windstorms that could occur in the current climate. Using a large dataset of windstorm footprints created seasonal forecast model output, we find windstorms that are more extreme than any previously observed for most of the countries considered. Impacts from these extreme windstorms are expected to be around 1.5 times stronger than the most extreme storm on record. This information is highly valuable in the insurance industry.\n\nReduction of the uncertainty of flood hazard analyses under a future climate by integrating multiple SSP-RCP scenarios\n\nYuki Kimura, Yukiko Hirabayashi, and Dai Yamazaki\n\nExternal preprint server, https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.170365204.46854879/v1,https://doi.org/10.22541/essoar.170365204.46854879/v1, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe limited number of ensemble members causes uncertainty in future climate predictions. To address this, using multiple simulations under a single future climate scenario can increase the sample size, but data availability is limited in the scenario-based future projection experiment of climate model intercomparison projects. Our proposed method integrates multiple climate scenarios at specific temperature increases, effectively reducing uncertainty in future flood hazard assessments globally.\n\nBrief Communication: From modeling to reality – Insights from a recent severe storm surge event along the German Baltic Sea coast\n\nJoshua Kiesel, Claudia Wolff, and Marvin Lorenz\n\nNat.

By combining experimental data and numerical simulations, we show that on gentle slopes, a crack forms and propagates due to compression fracture within a weak layer, and on steep slopes, the crack velocity can increase dramatically after about 5 meters due to a fracture mode transition (compression to shear). Understanding these dynamics represents an essential additional piece in the dry-snow slab avalanche formation puzzle.\n\nImproving Risk Assessment of Subaqueous Landslides and Tsunami Generation by Understanding the Roles of Pore Pressure and Sediment Cohesion\n\nMaxwell M.

Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-53,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-53, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: open, 2 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBy analyzing historical and instrumental seismic data, fault knowledge and geodetic measurements, we provide a new understanding of seismic hazard in the Lesser Antilles via seismotectonic zoning. We propose new models that can have a significant impact on seismic hazard assessment, such as the inclusion of mantle wedge seismicity, volcanic seismicity and a complete revision of the subduction interface zoning.\n\nThe effect of propagation saw test geometries on critical cut length\n\nBastian Bergfeld, Karl W. Birkeland, Valentin Adam, Philipp L. Rosendahl, and Alec van Herwijnen\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-690,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-690, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: final response, 2 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTo release a slab avalanche, a crack in a weak snow layer beneath a cohesive slab has to propagate. Information on that is essential for assessing avalanche risk. In the field, information can be gathered with the Propagation Saw Test (PST). However, there are different standards on how to cut the PST. In this study, we experimentally investigate the effect of these different column geometries and provide models to correct for imprecise field test geometry effects on the critical cut length.\n\nHow to communicate and educate more effectively on natural risk issues to improve disaster risk management through serious games\n\nMercedes VÃ¡zquez-VÃ­lchez, RocÃ­o Carmona-Molero, and Tania Ouariachi-Peralta\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-994,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-994, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: final response, 2 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFew evidence of the potential of disaster risk management (DRM) games has been documented. This study focuses on exploring the potential of serious games for improving DRM. We employed a methodological triangulation, analysing and comparing data from content analysis of serious games, focus groups with experts and literature review. For the first time, this paper provides a list of recommended features of DRM game. The results can be of great help to teachers and game designers in improving DRM.\n\nCompound winter low wind and cold events impacting the French electricity system: observed evolution and role of large-scale circulation\n\nFranÃ§ois Collet, Margot Bador, Julien BoÃ©, Laurent Dubus, and BÃ©nÃ©dicte Jourdier\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-903,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-903, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: final response, 2 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe objective of this study is to characterize the observed evolution of compound winter low wind and cold events impacting the French electricity system. The frequency of compound events exhibits a high interannual variability and a decrease over the 1950–2022 period. We further show that the regional atmospheric circulation is an important driver of compound events occurence, but do not strongly contributes to the observed decrease.\n\nBlade Hardness Gauge: Snow Hardness Measuring and Analysis Techniques\n\nPeter Karl Aird Barsevskis and Mark J. Paetkau\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-759,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-759, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: final response, 3 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe blade hardness gauge is a promising technology for avalanche forecasters. The research set out to determine standard techniques to use the gauge with respect to insertion rate and the orientation of the gauge to the snowpack. The gauge is more consistent amongst users for measuring snow hardness compared to the use of the hand hardness test. It has the potential for use as a teaching tool for the hand hardness test and for measuring snow hardness over time.\n\nThe role of antecedent conditions in translating precipitation events into extreme floods at catchment scale and in a large basin context\n\nMaria Staudinger, Martina Kauzlaric, Alexandre Mas, Guillaume Evin, Benoit Hingray, and Daniel Viviroli\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-909,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-909, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: final response, 2 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nVarious combinations of antecedent conditions and precipitation result in floods of varying degrees. Antecedent conditions played a crucial role in generating even large. The key predictors and spatial patterns of antecedent conditions leading to flooding at the basin's outlet were distinct. Precipitation and soil moisture from almost all sub-catchments were important for more frequent floods. For rarer events, only the predictors of specific sub-catchments were important.\n\nWhere to start with climate-smart forest management? Climatic risk for forest-based mitigation\n\nNatalie Piazza, Luca Malanchini, Edoardo Nevola, and Giorgio Vacchiano\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-758,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-758, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: final response, 4 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNatural disturbances will increase in the future endangering our forests and their provision of wood, protection against natural hazards and carbon sequestration. Considering the hazard to forests by wind or fire damage together with vulnerability of carbon, it is possible to prioritize high-risk forest stands. In this study we propose a new methodological approach helping with decision-making process for climate-smart forest management.\n\nRegional-scale analysis of weather-related rockfall triggering mechanisms in Norway, and its sensitivity to climate change\n\nRosa M. Palau, Kjersti Gleditsch GisnÃ¥s, Anders Solheim, and Graham Lewis Gilbert\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-46,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-46, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: final response, 2 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper looks at the relationship between rockfalls and weather conditions in two regions of Norway. The study explores how often rockfalls occur and how this might change in the future due to climate change. The results indicate that changes in temperature, rather than just heavy rain or snow melt, can have a big impact on the time rockfalls happen. In particular, when temperatures oscillate up and down, rockfalls are observed more often.\n\nUsing a convection-permitting climate model to predict wine grape productivity: two case studies in Italy\n\nLaura Teresa Massano, Giorgia Fosser, Marco Gaetani, and CÃ©cile Caillaud\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-941,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-941, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: final response, 2 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nTraditional wine-growing regions are threatened by expected climate change. Climate models and observations are used to calculate bioclimatic indices based both on temperature and precipitation. These indices are correlated to grape productivity in two wine-growing regions in Italy. This analysis paves the way for using climate models to study how climate change affects wine production in the future.\n\nAn updated EAWS matrix to determine the avalanche danger level: derivation, usage, and consistency\n\nKarsten MÃ¼ller, Frank Techel, and Christoph Mitterer\n\nNat.

Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-48,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-48, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAvalanche forecasting is crucial for mountain safety. Tools like the European Avalanche Danger Scale and Matrix set standards for forecasters, but consistency still varies. We analyzed the use of the EAWS Matrix, aiding danger level assignment. Our analysis shows inconsistencies, suggesting further need for refinement and training.\n\nRisk Assessment and Mechanism of Water Inrush in Water-rich Deep-buried Karst Tunnel\n\nXin Zhang, Mingtang Lei, Shaoqing Wang, Xiaotian Zhang, Hai Chen, and Xiaozhen Jiang\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-56,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-56, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: open, 1 comment)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis research investigates water inrush disasters in water-rich, deep-buried karst tunnels, focusing on the Nahecun tunnel. By analyzing hydrogeological characteristics and identifying key factors contributing to water inrush disasters, a risk assessment system is developed and validated through field experiments.\n\nCurrent status of water-related planning for climate change adaptation in the Spree River basin, Germany\n\nSaskia Arndt and Stefan Heiland\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-59,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2024-59, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript under review for NHESS (discussion: final response, 4 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study provides an overview of the current status of climate change adaptation in water management, spatial and landscape planning in the Spree River basin. Only 39 % of 28 plans analysed specify objectives and measures for adaptation to climate change. To fill this planning gap, more frequent updates of plans, a stronger focus on multifunctional measures and the adaptation of best practice examples for systematic integration of climate change impacts and adaptation are needed.\n\nFrom insufficient rainfall to livelihoods: understanding the cascade of drought impacts and policy implications\n\nLouise Cavalcante, David W. Walker, Sarra Kchouk, Germano Ribeiro Neto, TaÃ­s Maria Nunes Carvalho, Mariana Madruga de Brito, Wieke Pot, Art Dewulf, and Pieter van Oel\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-650,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-650, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: final response, 3 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe research aimed to understand the role of society in mitigating drought impacts through policy responses in the context of northeast Brazil. Results revealed that socio-environmental-economic impacts of drought are less frequently reported, while hydrological impacts of drought were the most reported. It emphasized that public policies addressing the impacts of drought need to focus not only on increasing water availability, but also on strengthening the local economy.\n\nConvection-permitting climate model representation of severe convective wind gusts and future changes in southeastern Australia\n\nAndrew Brown, Andrew Dowdy, and Todd P. Lane\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-322,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-322, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript under review for NHESS (discussion: final response, 6 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nA computer model that simulates the climate of south-eastern Australia is shown here to represent extreme wind events associated with convective storms. This is useful as it allows us to investigate possible future changes in the occurrences of these events, and we find in the year 2050 that our model simulates a decrease in the number of occurrences. However, the model also simulates too many events in the historical climate compared with observations, so these future changes are uncertain.\n\nCharacterizing the scale of regional landslide triggering from storm hydrometeorology\n\nJonathan P. Perkins, Nina S. Oakley, Brian D. Collins, Skye C. Corbett, and W. Paul Burgess\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-873,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-873, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: final response, 4 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLandslides are a global issue that results in deaths and economic losses annually. However, it is not clear how storm severity relates to landslide severity across large regions. Here we develop a method to estimate the footprint of landslide area and compare this to meteorologic estimates of storm severity. We find that total storm strength does not clearly relate to landslide area. Rather, landslide area depends on soil wetness and smaller storm structures that can produce intense rainfall.\n\nMonitoring snow depth variations in an avalanche release area using low cost LiDAR and optical sensors\n\nPia Ruttner-Jansen, Annelies Voordendag, Thierry Hartmann, Julia Glaus, Andreas Wieser, and Yves BÃ¼hler\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-744,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-744, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript under review for NHESS (discussion: final response, 6 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSnow depth variations caused by wind are an important factor in avalanche danger, but detailed and up-to-date information is rarely available. We propose a monitoring system, using LiDAR and optical sensors, to measure the snow depth distribution at high spatial and temporal resolution. First results show that we can quantify snow depth changes with an accuracy on the low decimeter level or better, and to identify events such as avalanches or displacement of snow during periods of strong winds.\n\nStudy on Multi-water Sources Allocation Based on Multi-scenario potential tapping under Extreme Drought: An Example from the Yellow River Water Supply Area in Henan\n\nFang Wan, Shaoming Peng, Yu Wang, Xiaokang Zheng, Fei Zhang, Weihao Wang, and Xiaohui Shen\n\nNat.

According to PDSI, the extreme drought years are selected to obtain the water shortage in each water supply area. According to different potential mining measures, different water supply scenarios are set up to explore multi-scenario supply increase under extreme drought conditions. The allocation model is constructed, and a multi-scenario supply allocation scheme is proposed.\n\nEffective Storm Surge Evacuation Planning Coupling Risk Assessment and DRL: A Case Study of Daya Bay Petrochemical Industrial Zone\n\nChuanfeng Liu, Yan Li, Wenjuan Li, Hao Qin, Lin Mu, Si Wang, Darong Liu, and Kai Zhou\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2280,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2280, 2024\n\nPreprint under review for NHESS (discussion: final response, 4 comments)\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nStorm surges pose a significant flooding risk to coastal areas. This research, taking China's Daya Bay Petrochemical Industrial Zone as a case study, addresses the dynamic nature of flooding events and the limitations of traditional evacuation plans for individuals with restricted real-time information. By combining the hydrological model and artificial intelligence, the method proves highly effective in optimizing evacuation routes, providing invaluable guidance during actual storm surges.\n\nInvited perspectives: Safeguarding t"
