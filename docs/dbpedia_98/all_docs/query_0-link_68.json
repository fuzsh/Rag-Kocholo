It argues that the conventional form assumed by his drawings or 'inscriptions' â the indications of scale, the delineation of options, the signatures and marginal notes â can be read as traces of seduction that helped 'translate' potential patrons to a taste for Rococo. The essay further suggests that the activation of the taste at the point of commission was kept alive in the designs executed by the bi-modal asymmetry that is characteristic of the goÃ»t pittoresque because its exercise was considered a mark of refinement.\n\nNicolas Delruelle 1965 - 2016\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nStaff Association\n\n2016-01-01\n\nOn Tuesday, 20th September, many CERN colleagues gathered to attend the funeral of Nicolas Delruelle, accompanying and supporting his family in this difficult moment. During the farewell ceremony, many colleagues and friends expressed their deep sorrow, evoking not only the career of Nicolas, but also the personality and qualities of this jovial and likeable person, who was also committed to the Staff Association. We hope that all these moving testimonies could bring some comfort to his bereaved family.

He was soon recruited by the FN Moteur company, a subsidiary of Snecma, and was seconded to the SociÃ©tÃ© EuropÃ©enne de Propulsion (SEP) in Vernon, France, where he worked on testing the cryogenic engines for the third stages of the Ariane rockets. Subsequently he developed and carried out simulations for the new Vulcain cryogenic engine, for use on the Ariane 5 rockets. Â At the end of 1991, Nicolas was recruited by CERN to join the Cryogenics group, where he worked on the SPS superconducting cavities, for the injection of electrons and positrons into LEP. He proved his mastery of cryogenic processes by taking delivery of two helium coolers allowing the superconducting cavities to be cooled to 4.5 K. In the early 1990s, CERN was deploying real-time process monitoring using microprocessors for the first time.

In other words, the relativistic effects on local gravitational instability are considered for systems whose characteristic velocities and corresponding gravitational fields are higher than those permitted in the Newtonian limit. The dispersion relation for the propagation of small perturbations is found in the post-Newtonian approximation using two different techniques. A new Jeans mass is derived and compared to the standard Jeans mass. In this limit, the relativistic effects make the new Jeans mass smaller than the Newtonian Jeans mass. Furthermore, the fractional difference between these two masses increases when the temperature/pressure of the system increases. Interestingly, in this limit, pressure can enhance gravitational instability instead of preventing it. Finally, the results are applied to high-temperature astrophysical systems, and the possibility of local fragmentation in some relativistic systems is investigated.\n\nPost-Newtonian Jeans Analysis\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nNazari, Elham; Kazemi, Ali; Roshan, Mahmood; Abbassi, Shahram, E-mail: mroshan@um.ac.ir [Department of Physics, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, P.O.

Then it is discussed how the Jeans criterion can be derived from the Virial Theorem and the inherent shortcomings in this derivation. Finally, it is indicated how these shortcomings might be overcome. The Jeans criterion is a fragmentation - or condensation -criterion. An expression is given, connecting the fragmentation of an unstable extended medium into masses Msub(J). Rather than picturing the background medium fragmenting, it is probably more appropriate to envisage these masses Msub(J) 'condensing' out of the background medium. On the condensation picture some fraction of the background material separates out into coherent bound nodules under the pull of its self-gravity. For this reason the Jeans criterion is discussed as a condensation condition, reserving the term fragmentation for a different process. The Virial Theorem provides a contraction criterion. This is described with reference to a spherical cloud and is developed to derive the Jeans criterion.

Jean was one of those quietly efficient and conscientious pillars of our community who beaver away unobtrusively for decades and make such a contribution to building CERN. An expert in thermal engineering, he left his mark on many buildings on the Meyrin and PrÃ©vessin sites. At the time of the LEP project at the beginning of the 1980s he was in charge of defining the principles of the ventilation systems for the new accelerator. Through his design studies and the calls for tenders that he launched, he developed these high-performance state-of-the-art installations which not only made LEPâs successes possible but also served as benchmarks for the fundamental principles underpinning the design of the LHC ventilation system. Jean always liked to surround himself with young people and during the years of his stewardship the design office was a splendid training ground.

Our data suggest that at least a few lizards are probably more than 20 years old, and one lizard would be 31.5 years old if it grew at an average rate for the population. Ages of 20 and 30 years seem reasonable given the remarkably slow growth during capture intervals of more than a decade for five of the lizards which we estimated to be 20 or more years old. Like other lizards, island night lizard growth rates vary by size, with larger lizards growing more slowly. In general, growth rates were somewhat greater on San Nicolas Island (compared with Santa Barbara Island), and this increase was sustained through all of the intermediate size classes. The higher growth rate may account for the somewhat larger lizards present on San Nicolas Island, although we cannot discount the possibility that night lizards on San Nicolas are merely living longer. The high percentage of small lizards in the Eucalyptus habitat might seem to reflect a healthy population in that habitat, but the high proportion of small lizards appears to be caused by good reproduction in the 1900s and substantially poorer reproduction in subsequent years. The Eucalyptus habitat has dried quite a bit in recent years. Night lizards in the Haplopappus/Grassland habitat have shown an increase in the proportion of larger lizards since 2000. There has also been an increase in the proportion of large lizards in the Rock Cobble habitat at Redeye Beach. However, there are has been some change in habitat with more elephant seals occupying the same area just above the high tide as do the night lizards. Southern alligator lizards and side-blotched lizards are both non-native on San Nicolas Island. Neither lizard causes obvious harm to island night lizards, and management time and effort should\n\nMillist presidenti Prantsusmaa vajab? / Martin Kala\n\nIndex Scriptorium Estoniae\n\nKala, Martin, 1977-\n\n2007-01-01\n\nPrantsusmaa presidendivalimiste kampaanias on enim silma paistnud neli kandidaati: Jean-Marie Le Pen, Francois Bayrou, Nicolas Sarkozy ja Segolene Royal.

It is found that the Jeans instability is significantly reduced by the presence of the dust-lower-hybrid wave and the ion quantum effect. The minimum wavenumber for Jeans stability depends clearly on ion quantum effect and the dust-lower-hybrid frequency also.\n\nWeâre all behind you, Jean-Yves!\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nLaÃ«titia Pedroso\n\n2010-01-01\n\nJean-Yves Le Meur, developer of the CERN Document Server (CDS) which manages the Organizationâs electronic archives, is about to take part in his third Paralympic Winter Games in Vancouver.

We used 13 kinds of jean fabric from commercial jeans and 26 other fabric types. The physical properties were measured using the Kawabata evaluation system, and the fabric hand was evaluated by 20 subjects using a semantic differential method. To characterise the hand of jean fabrics compared with other fabrics, we used principal component analysis and obtained three principal components. We found that jean fabrics were characterised by the second principal component, which was affected by feelings of thickness and weight. We further characterised the jean fabrics according to âsoftness & smoothnessâ and ânon-fullnessâ, depending on country of origin and type of manufacturer. The three principal components were analysed using multiple linear regression to characterise the components according to the physical properties. We explained the hand of fabrics including jean fabrics using its association with physical properties.\n\nAnnual Quality Assurance Conference Files by Nicola Watson and Rui Li\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n26th Annual Quality Assurance Conference.

Based upon the assumption that the unperturbed cloud is initially uniform, the Jeans instability is non-oscillatory and purely growing. However, Newtonian gravitation precludes strictly homogeneous equilibria, but a way out is offered, in theory, by considering local perturbations, small compared to the inhomogeneity scale lengths. While in itself plausible, this procedure can in most cases not be tested for internal consistency, because real knowledge about the equilibrium is lacking, and is therefore called the Jeans swindle. The severe limitations of such an approach lead to an unavoidable dichotomy, and an example of a plasma will be discussed where the computations can be done explicitly, both for the stationary as well as for the perturbed state, showing that the system is stable at all wavelengths compatible with the equilibrium inhomogeneity. Nevertheless, the present state of affairs does not allow self-consistent equilibria to be worked out in more complicated configurations, like in dusty plasmas with external magnetic fields. This typically leads to the Jeans swindle being used a little longer than desirable\n\nA pedagogical look at Jeans' density scale\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nChu, K-H W\n\n2007-01-01\n\nWe illustrate the derivations of Jeans' criteria for the gravitational instabilities in a static homogeneous Newtonian system for pedagogical objectives.

To answer that question, this book draws on Rashevskyâs unexplored personal archival papers and shares interviews with his family, students and friends, as well as discussions with biologists and mathematical biologists, to flesh out and complete the picture. âMost modern-day biologists have never heard of Rashevsky. Why?â In what constitutes the first detailed biography of theoretical physicist Nicolas Rashevsky (1899-1972), spanning key aspects of his long scientific career, the book captures Rashevskyâs ways of thinking about the place mathematical biology should have in biology and his personal struggle for the acceptance of his views. It brings to light the tension between mathematicians, theoretical physicists and biologists when it comes to the introduction of physico-mathematical tools into biology. Rashevskyâs successes and failures in his efforts to establish mathematical biology as a subfield of biology provide an important test case for understanding the role o...\n\nArea of turbulence\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nAnaÃ¯s Schaeffer\n\n2015-01-01\n\nAs a member of the EuHIT (European High-Performance Infrastructures in Turbulence - see here) consortium, CERN is participating in fundamental research on turbulence phenomena.

For us, his colleagues in the Legal Service, Jean-Marie was a tutor and a reference, who passed on to us his passion for the practice of law in an intergovernmental organisation. As a boss, his abiding managerial quality was his unstinting loyalty to his collaborators. Jean-Marie joined CERN in 1966 and for the next 35 years was to be the guardian of the Laboratoryâs rules. This was his view of the Organization: \"...I have discovered [at CERN] a fascinating universe driven by two forces: science and Europe; a world of physicists and engineers who, encouraged by the States of Europe, run a remarkable Laboratory, where Europeans have achieved reconciliation and restored the grand tradition of European physics, attracting physicists from around the world; a Laboratory that transcends not only the fro...\n\nJeans instability of self-gravitating magnetized strongly coupled plasma\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nPrajapati, R P; Sharma, P K; Sanghvi, R K; Chhajlani, R K\n\n2012-01-01\n\nWe investigate the Jeans instability of self-gravitating magnetized strongly coupled plasma. The equations of the problem are formulated using the generalized hydrodynamic model and a general dispersion relation is obtained using the normal mode analysis. This dispersion relation is discussed for transverse and longitudinal mode of propagations. The modified condition of Jeans instability is obtained for magnetized strongly coupled plasma. We find that strong coupling of plasma particles modify the fundamental criterion of Jeans gravitational instability. In transverse mode it is found that Jeans instability criterion gets modified due to the presence of magnetic field, shear viscosity and fluid viscosity but in longitudinal mode it is unaffected due to the presence of magnetic field. From the curves we found that all these parameters have stabilizing influence on the growth rate of Jeans instability.\n\nJean-Yves Hemery\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\nCERN Bulletin\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe family, friends and colleagues of Jean-Yves HEMERY are sad to announce his accidental death on 24 September, at the age of 63, in Priziac.

He was also a pioneer on the technical application of the microcinematography in laboratory research. His collaboration with clinicians and surgeons in the study of various pathological disorders is little known. From 1918 to the 1920s, he collaborated with such neurologists as AndrÃ© Thomas, Jean Athanase Sicard, and others in the study of various neurological disorders by using cinematography as a scientific tool for understanding the clinical and pathological mechanisms of diseases.

Before the discovery of quarks, he gave the correct formulation of the weak current couplings that in modern terms corresponds to the phenomenon of quark mixing. His formulation, in terms of the famous Cabibbo angle, was later extended to three families of fermions (and more recently also applied to neutrino mixing), and plays an essential role in the Standard Model of fundamental interactions. Over the years he applied his extremely lucid, deep and flexible mind to a wide range of problems, also including experiments, such as the measurement in 1963 of the electron helicity in muon decay, and the conception and design of the parallel computers APE, which he developed, starting in the early 1980s, for the simulation of the QCD theory of the strong interactions on discrete space-time.

In the XVII century these paintings were very popular in the Netherlands, and in this country the cities flourished as cultural centers searching the anatomy knowledge. Nicolaes Tulp was one of the persons in the center of Amsterdam's scene during XVII century. In 1632 Tulp was 39 years old, and he was an anatomist and a surgeon. Rembrandt masterly shows an autopsy performed by Dr. Tulp. This picture is the description of the beginning of a medical intellectual utopia: the absolute visibility of the disease. Unfortunately this utopia is blind to the complete visibility of the psycho-socio-cultural dimensions of the ill.\n\nSpÃ©cificitÃ© pastorale de la personnalitÃ© de Jean-Paul II selon Jean-Marie Lustiger\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRyszard Biernat\n\n2011-04-01\n\nFull Text Available Jean-Marie Lustiger admired John Paul II and he was devoted to him. They both had similar origin. The Cardinal of Paris often accompanied the pope in his pastoral visits. He perceived John Paul II as the man of Providence. He was convinced that God had prepared him to this role. Jean-Marie Lustiger emphasized the attitudes of John Paul II that attracted the attention and admiration of observers. For instance: pray, holiness, attentive pastor and good relation with young people. Jean-Marie Lustiger as an attentive observer also focused his attention on the pastoral methods of John Paul II. In his utterances he often perceived the following methods: each person was important, defense of personâs dignity, the ability to speak with each man, modern language, importance of the pastoral visits and sui generis spiritual pedagogic. Jean-Marie Lustiger noticed radical change of perspective in preaching and in pastoral action of John Paul II. According to him the pope perceived the challenges of the modern times, evaluated needs of the humanity and gave the appropriate answers. For these he did not choose politics, sociology or even anthropology as a re fl ection but addressed to the hurt human who was redeem by Jesus Christ.\n\nNew aspects of the Jeans instability in dusty plasmas\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nVerheest, Frank; Hellberg, Manfred A; Mace, Richard L\n\n1998-01-01\n\nIn contrast to a gas, a dusty plasma can support a variety of wave modes each in principle able to impart to the dust grains the randomizing energy necessary to avoid Jeans collapse on some length scale. Consequently, the stability to Jeans collapse is more complex in a dusty plasma than it is for a charge-neutral gas. After recalling some of the fundamental ideas related to the ordinary Jeans instability in neutral gases, we will extend the discussion to plasmas containing charged dust grains. Besides the usual Jeans criterion based upon thermal agitation, various other ways of countering the gravitational collapse can be considered. One is via excitation of electrostatic dust-acoustic modes, the other via novel Alfven-Jeans instabilities for perpendicularly propagating electromagnetic waves on the extraordinary mode branch. The wavelengths that are unstable are modified due to the presence of a magnetic field and of charged particles. These mechanisms yield different minimum threshold length scales for the onset of instability/condensation\n\nJounin Nicolas, Chantier interdit au public\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nWilliams Nuytens\n\n2011-09-01\n\nFull Text Available Le travail de Nicolas Jounin sâappuie sur des enquÃªtes de terrain rÃ©alisÃ©es dans la premiÃ¨re moitiÃ© des annÃ©es 2000, en France, dans le monde du bÃ¢timent, sur des chantiers et autour de ceux-ci.

Tim\n\n2018-01-01\n\nKelp forest communities are highly variable over space and time. Despite this complexity it has been suggested that kelp forest communities can be classified into one of 2 states: kelp dominated or sea urchin dominated. It has been further hypothesized that these represent âalternate stable statesâ because a site can remain in either of these states for decades before some perturbation causes a rapid shift to the other state. Our research group has maintained a subtidal community monitoring program for 38 years at San Nicolas Island consisting of twice-annual scuba-based surveys at 6 sites distributed within 4 regions around the island. Three types of perturbations are thought to be relevant to subtidal community dynamics at San Nicolas: (1) physical disturbances in the form of major storm and El NiÃ±o/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events; (2) invertebrate diseases, which periodically decimate urchin populations; and (3) the reintroduction and subsequent increase of sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis). These 3 perturbations differ in spatial and temporal specificity; physical disturbances and disease outbreaks occur periodically and could affect all 4 regions, while sea otter predation has been concentrated primarily at the West End sites over the last 15 years. The different types of perturbations and the duration of the time series at the kelp forests at San Nicolas make the data set ideal for testing the âalternate stable stateâ hypothesis. We use nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) to examine spatial and temporal patterns of community similarity at the 4 regions. In particular, we evaluate support for the existence of stable states, which are represented on NMDS plots as distinct spatial clusters. Community dynamics at each site approximated a biased random walk in NMDS space, with one or more basins of attraction and occasional jumps between basins. We found evidence for alternative stable states at some sites, and we show that transitions from one\n\nThe anatomy lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp by Rembrandt : A comparison of the painting with a dissected left forearm of a Dutch male cadaver\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nIjpma, Frank F.

The gravitational force acting on the massive negatively charged interstellar dust grains are considered in presence of both electrical and polarization forces. The basic equations of the problem are formulated and a general dispersion relation is obtained using plane wave approximation in low frequency wave mode. The effect of polarization force in the dispersion relation of the problem, condition of the Jeans instability and expression of the critical Jeans wave number is examined. The unstable growing modes due to self-gravitational force are studied in the situation when polarization force on the dust grain exceeds over the electrical force in magnitude. It is observed that the polarization force increases the growth rate of the system. -- Highlights: â Jeans instability of gravitating dusty plasma with polarization force is investigated. â The fundamental Jeans instability criterion is modified due to polarization effect. â The critical Jeans length decreases due to increase in polarization force. â Polarization force destabilizes the unstable Jeans mode. â The collapsing of interstellar dusty cloud is discussed.\n\nJean Francheteau (1943-2010)\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSclater, John; Le Pichon, Xavier\n\n2010-12-01\n\nJean Francheteau, pioneering marine geologist and geophysicist, AGU Fellow, and emeritus professor at the University of Brest (UniversitÃ© de Bretagne Occidentale), died on 21 July in St-Renan, Brittany, France, at the age of 67 after a long illness.

The nonextensivity is introduced in the Jeans problem by a generalized q-nonextensive velocity distribution function through the equation of state of ideal gas in nonextensive kinetic theory. A new Jeans' criterion is deduced with a factor â(2/(5-3q)) that, however, differs from that one in [Astron.

This change is described here for the first time using the direct simulation Monte Carlo method. When heating is predominantly below the lower boundary of the simulation region, R 0 , and well below the exobase of a single-component atmosphere, the nature of the escape process changes over a surprisingly narrow range of Jeans parameters, Î» 0 , evaluated at R 0 . For an atomic gas, the transition occurs over Î» 0 â¼ 2-3, where the lower bound, Î» 0 â¼ 2.1, corresponds to the upper limit for isentropic, supersonic outflow. For Î» 0 > 3 escape occurs on a molecule-by-molecule basis and we show that, contrary to earlier suggestions, for Î» 0 > â¼6 the escape rate does not deviate significantly from the familiar Jeans rate. In a gas composed of diatomic molecules, the transition shifts to Î» 0 â¼ 2.4-3.6 and at Î» 0 > â¼4 the escape rate increases a few tens of percent over that for the monatomic gas. Scaling by the Jeans parameter and the Knudsen number, these results can be applied to thermally induced escape of the major species from solar and extrasolar planets.\n\nJean-Paul Diss (1928-2012)\n\nCERN Multimedia\n\n2012-01-01\n\nWe were greatly saddened to learn of the sudden death of Dr Jean-Paul Diss at his home on 7 June 2012.

The radiative heat-loss functions also modify the Jeans condition of instability and expression of critical Jeans wave number. It is observed that the polarization force and ratio of radiative heat-loss functions have destabilizing while magnetic field and dust temperature have stabilizing influence on the growth rate of Jeans instability.\n\nNicolae Ceausescu and Santiago Carrillo.

The quantum effects are considered via exchange-correlation potential, recoil effect, and Fermi degenerate pressure, in addition to thermal effects of plasma species. It is found that the electron exchange and correlation potential have significant effects over the threshold value of wave vector and Jeans instability. The presence of electron exchange and correlation effect shortens the time of dust sound that comparatively stabilizes the self gravitational collapse.

Using the plane wave solutions, a general dispersion relation is derived which is modified due to the presence of dust-neutral collisions, strong coupling effect, polarization force, electron radiative condensation, and Jeans dust/neutral frequencies. In the long wavelength perturbations, the Jeans instability criterion depends upon strong coupling effect, polarization interaction parameter, and thermal loss, but it is independent of dust-neutral collision frequency. The stability of the considered configuration is analysed using the RouthâHurwitz criterion. The growth rates of Jeans instability are illustrated, and stabilizing influence of viscoelasticity and dust-neutral collision frequency while destabilizing effect of electron radiative condensation, polarization force, and Jeans dust-neutral frequency ratio is observed. This work is applied to understand the gravitational collapse of SCDP with dust-neutral collisions.\n\nCorrelated Random Systems Five Different Methods : CIRM Jean-Morlet Chair\n\nCERN Document Server\n\nKistler, Nicola\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThis volume presents five different methods recently developed to tackle the large scale behavior of highly correlated random systems, such as spin glasses, random polymers, local times and loop soups and random matrices. These methods, presented in a series of lectures delivered within the Jean-Morlet initiative (Spring 2013), play a fundamental role in the current development of probability theory and statistical mechanics. The lectures were: Random Polymers by E. Bolthausen, Spontaneous Replica Symmetry Breaking and Interpolation Methods by F. Guerra, Derrida's Random Energy Models by N. Kistler, Isomorphism Theorems by J. Rosen and Spectral Properties of Wigner Matrices by B. Schlein. This book is the first in a co-edition between the Jean-Morlet Chair at CIRM and the Springer Lecture Notes in Mathematics which aims to collect together courses and lectures on cutting-edge subjects given during the term of the Jean-Morlet Chair, as well as new material produced in its wake.

Meet him and hear about his exceptional life on 23 April 2008 in the Globe. An accident cost him his legs when he was young, and it was sheer force of character and a passion for the mountains that carried Jean-Yves Le Meur, with one artificial leg and crutches to stay upright, to the very summit of the Mont-Blanc. In his book, Jean-Yves, a computer engineer at CERN, recounts with detachment his personal battle to win back his life and make this impossible ascent. \"Faux Pas\" depicts a series of encounters and people, and recreates the extreme emotions of a man who reconstructed his life and pushed himself beyond his limits.

K.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe effect of spin induced magnetization and electrical resistivity incorporating the viscosity of the medium is examined on the Jeans instability of quantum magnetoplasma. Formulation of the system is done by using the quantum magnetohydrodynamic model. The analysis of the problem is carried out by normal mode analysis theory. The general dispersion relation is derived from set of perturbed equations to analyse the growth rate and condition of self-gravitational Jeans instability. To discuss the influence of resistivity, magnetization, and viscosity parameters on Jeans instability, the general dispersion relation is reduced for both transverse and longitudinal mode of propagations. In the case of transverse propagation, the gravitating mode is found to be affected by the viscosity, magnetization, resistivity, and magnetic field strength whereas Jeans criterion of instability is modified by the magnetization and quantum parameter. In the longitudinal mode of propagation, the gravitating mode is found to be modified due to the viscosity and quantum correction in which the Jeans condition of instability is influenced only by quantum parameter. The other non-gravitating Alfven mode in this direction is affected by finite electrical resistivity, spin induced magnetization, and viscosity. The numerical study for the growth rate of Jeans instability is carried out for both in the transverse and longitudinal direction of propagation to the magnetic field. The effect of various parameters on the growth rate of Jeans instability in quantum plasma is analysed\n\nJeans instability of rotating magnetized quantum plasma: Influence of radiation\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nJoshi, H., E-mail: hjoshi8525@yahoo.com [Department of Physics, Mewar University, Chittorgarh (Raj.)

Mukhtasar Syamsudin\n\n2013-05-01\n\nFull Text Available Abstract: Education Problems of Video Games in the Perspective of Jean Baudrillardâs Theory of Simulacra. In the era of digital age, we are witnessing how video games penetrate childrenâs daily life and it is believed to have some impacts on their cognitive and affective processes. Referring to hermeneutical approach, the present library research seeks to answer the question whether video games create a real identity or simply forge false consciousness in children. In the first step, the data were collected from bibliographiÂ­cal sources that related to data. In the second step, the data were analyzed to examine the pedagogical-philosophical properties of the video games. The results indicate that video games change the way children view the world. Video games present the world as hiper-reality. Bu putting aside the negative values and maximizing the positive ones, the understanding of hiper-reality allows for the inculcation of children. Abstrak: Problem Pendidikan Video Games dalam Perspectif Teori Simulacra Jean Baudrillard. Permainan video games diyakini berdampak positif sekaligus negatif pada proses kognitif dan afektif anak.-anak. Terutama, video games berpengaruh pada proses internalisasi nilai-nilai dan pembentukan identitas mereka. Teknologi virtual yang disajikan oleh video games, seperti didekati oleh teori simulacra Jean Baudrillard, menyuguhkan jebakan akan realitas palsu. Melalui riset pustaka dengan metode \"filsafat herÂ­meneutis\", dianalisis data untuk membangun refleksi filsafat pendidikan atas permainan video games itu. Hasil penelitian ini menyatakan video games menyuguhkan sebuah hiper-realitas dari simulasi realitas, atau simulacra dalam teori Jean Baudrillard. Simulacra adalah dunia yang terbentuk dari salinan realitas, yang menjadi acuan melebihi realitas asli. Disimpulkan bahwa video games menjadi semacam âruang konseptualâ, yang dibentuk oleh simulacra.

The first and regionally most important event is sharply defined by new K-Ar dates between 200 and 209 Ma for the Thuya, Wildhorse, Iron Mask, and Allison batholiths and a 205 +- 10 Ma Rb-Sr isochron for the Guichon Creek batholith. All these plutons were emplaced approximately at the change from Triassic to Jurassic time. The related and slightly older Nicola volcanic rocks are altered by addition of more radiogenic sedimentary Sr (Carnian Nicola limestone having 87 Sr/ 86 Sr=0.7075+- 1) and do not give an isochron date. The Coldwater stock is anomalously old (K-Ar dates range from 215-267 Ma). The Mid- to late Jurassic igneous event is indicated by a 141 Ma K-Ar date for the Mount Martley batholith. Mid-Cretaceous volcanic rocks of the Kingsvale Group give a Rb-Sr isochron date of 112 +- 10 Ma and are postdated by the crosscutting and slightly younger Summers Creek stock (100 Ma by K-Ar). The final event straddles the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary with the Nicola batholith emplaced about 60 Ma ago (K-Ar) and the Rey Lake stock perhaps slightly earlier (69 Ma by K-Ar). Initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratios range from 0.7025-0.7046 with a mean and mode near 0.7037 which is within the range of modern circum-Pacific volcanoes. Initial ratios of 0.7034 +- 1 for the Guichon Creek batholith, 0.7035 +- 1 for the Iron Mask batholith 70435 +-10 for the Thuya batholith, and 0.70379 +- 4 for the Kingsvale volcanic rocks are the most precisely determined. The Coldwater stock is anomalously low at 0.7025. For the other plutonic bodies only scattered or single analyses are available. The Nicola volcanic rocks appear to have once been similar in initial ratio the the Guichon Creek batholith but their calculated initial ratios now scatter from 0.7034-0.7073.

The project decided to focus on jeans because of the large environmental impacts of cotton and the low recycling rates. The project used an open innovative approach by involving many actors from the different phases of the chain and included student and applied researchers. In a 'design jeans for recycling' students' workshop, prototypes of jeans that are easier to recycle have been developed. Integrating the new generation from different disciplines in the project proved to be very successful. The results show that an open innovation process can lead to very creative ideas and that lessons learned from this project could be used to develop new chain projects for other products. An important condition is that key actors are willing to cooperate in an open innovation approach.

We use a previously derived dispersion relation to evaluate the masses and growth times of the dominant modes in this instability. The results show that massive clouds (Mroughly-equal10 6 M/sub sun/) can form quickly (roughly-equal12 million yr) in the high density environments (5 cm -3 ) associated with spiral density wave shocks. For densities larger than about 3 cm -3 , these clouds form primarily as a result of the self-graviational forces in the interstellar medium. Lower mass clouds (Mroughly-equal10 5 M/sub sun/) can form in lower density environments as a result of the pure Parker instability. The masses of the clouds that form when the density exceeds about 3 cm -3 are insensitive to the magnetic field strength, cosmic ray pressure, and ambient density (even in compressed media.). These masses are essentially the Jeans mass in a magnetic interstellar medium. The occurrence of a characteristic mass may explain the similarity of the local OB associations. The role of the Parker-Jeans instability as part of a complete theory of cloud formation is summarized\n\nJean Nicolas De Surmont.

Tim; Bodkin, James L.; Cowen, Robert K.; Harrold, Christopher; Novak, Mark; Rassweiler, Andrew; Reed, Daniel C.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nSan Nicolas Island is surrounded by broad areas of shallow subtidal habitat, characterized by dynamic kelp forest communities that undergo dramatic and abrupt shifts in community composition. Although these reefs are fished, the physical isolation of the island means that they receive less impact from human activities than most reefs in Southern California, making San Nicolas an ideal place to evaluate alternative theories about the dynamics of these communities. Here we present monitoring data from seven sampling stations surrounding the island, including data on fish, invertebrate, and algal abundance. These data are unusual among subtidal monitoring data sets in that they combine relatively frequent sampling (twice per year) with an exceptionally long time series (since 1980). Other outstanding qualities of the data set are the high taxonomic resolution captured and the monitoring of permanent quadrats and swaths where the history of the community structure at specific locations has been recorded through time. Finally, the data span a period that includes two of the strongest ENSO events on record, a major shift in the Pacific decadal oscillation, and the reintroduction of sea otters to the island in 1987 after at least 150 years of absence. These events provide opportunities to evaluate the effects of bottom-up forcing, top-down control, and physical disturbance on shallow rocky reef communities.\n\nJean Desmet and the Early Dutch Film Trade\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nBlom, Ivo\n\n2003-01-01\n\nSince 1957 the Film Museum in Amsterdam has been in possession of the Desmet Collection which contains the estate of the Dutch cinema owner and film distributor Jean Desmet (1875-1956).

This Jeans filtering scale, which quantifies the small-scale structure of the IGM, has fundamental cosmological implications. First, it provides a thermal record of heat injected by ultraviolet photons during cosmic reionization events, and thus constrains the thermal and reionization history of the universe. Second, the Jeans scale determines the clumpiness of the IGM, a critical ingredient in models of cosmic reionization. Third, it sets the minimum mass scale for gravitational collapse from the IGM, and hence plays a pivotal role in galaxy formation. Unfortunately, it is extremely challenging to measure the Jeans scale via the standard technique of analyzing purely longitudinal LyÎ± forest spectra, because the thermal Doppler broadening of absorption lines along the line-of-sight, is highly degenerate with Jeans smoothing. In this work, we show that the Jeans filtering scale can be directly measured by characterizing the coherence of correlated LyÎ± forest absorption in close quasar pairs, with separations small enough â¼100 kpc to resolve it. We present a novel technique for this purpose, based on the probability density function (PDF) of phase angle differences of homologous longitudinal Fourier modes in close quasar pair spectra.

The drawing, until now known only through the black and white photograph, could be thoroughly analysed for the first time. In the context of information thus obtained, the historical context of creating the sketch transpired as an equally important matter, including the hypothetical role that may have been played in its creation by Nicolas-Claude Fabri de Peiresc.\n\nLes espÃ©rances de vie appliquÃ©es Ã des statuts spÃ©cifiques : historique des indicateurs et des mÃ©thodes de calcul\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nNicolas Brouard; Jean-Marie Robine; Emmanuelle Cambois\n\n1998-01-01\n\nCambois (Emmanuelle), Robin?

This analysis contains a systematic comparison of the rousseaunian ideas about the language and the writing with another theories of the 17th (Arnauld and Lancelot, 18th (Condillac, Paillasson, Jaucourt and 20th centuries (Saussure. The contrast of Rousseauâs ideas to Saussureâs about writing also, allows to make explicit Rousseauâs grammatological ideasâs big importance and his relation with the grammatology (Gelb,Derrida, Harris, exceeding avant la lettre modern linguisticsâs phonocentrism.\n\nEffect of secondary electron emission on Jean's instability in a complex plasma in the presence of nonthermal ions\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSarkar, Susmita; Maity, Saumyen; Banerjee, Soumyajyoti\n\n2011-01-01\n\nIn this paper, we have investigated the role of secondary electron emission on Jean's instability in a complex plasma in the presence of nonthermal ions. The equilibrium dust surface potential has been considered negative and hence primary and secondary electron temperatures are equal. Such plasma consists of three components: Boltzman distributed electrons, nonthermal ions and negatively charged inertial dust grains. From the linear dispersion relation, we have calculated the real frequency and growth rate of Jean's instability. Numerically, we have shown that for strong ion nonthermality Jean's mode is unstable. Growth of the instability reduces and the real part of the wave frequency increases with increasing secondary electron emission from dust grains. Hence, strong secondary electron emission suppresses Jean's instability in a complex plasma even when ion nonthermality is strong and equilibrium dust charge is negative.\n\nNicolas Chevillard (XVIIe siÃ¨cleÂ : tableaux en Bourgogne et en Normandie\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRenaud Benoit-Cattin\n\n2012-04-01\n\nFull Text Available La vie et l'Åuvre de Nicolas Chevillard, peintre de MÃ¢con (SaÃ´ne-et-Loire sont fort mal documentÃ©es.
