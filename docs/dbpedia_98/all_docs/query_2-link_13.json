        "text": "Introduction\n\nThe severe acute respiratory coronavirus‐2 (SARS CoV‐2) is associated with viral pneumonia named coronavirus disease‐2019 (COVID‐19), whose ongoing pandemic is posing great challenges to the healthcare systems worldwide. World Health Organization estimates there have been over 25 million confirmed COVID‐19 cases worldwide, with a mortality rate of approximately 4%, despite some differences across countries. 1 Older individuals, those with preexisting respiratory or cardiovascular medical conditions, as well as those with diabetes and hypertension, appear to be at higher risk of severe complications and death.2, 3, 4, 5 Available data suggest that hypertension is the most frequent comorbidity in patients with COVID‐19, and it is associated with a more severe course of the disease and a higher mortality.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 However, sparse data are available on hypertensive COVID‐19 patients, and the role played by anti‐hypertensive medications is unclear. Since the SARS CoV‐2 uses the receptor angiotensin‐converting enzyme (ACE) 2 to infect target cells, 13 a controversial debate is ongoing about whether angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) should possibly be the reason for the emerging association between hypertension and worse outcomes in patients with COVID‐19.14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 On one hand, it has been speculated that both these medications could increase SARS CoV‐2 infection susceptibility, and worsen the course of the respiratory syndromes. Indeed, in animal models and in humans it has been shown that ACEI and ARB may increase ACE2 levels in the lungs.20, 21, 22, 23 On the other hand, other authors have hypothesised that an increased level of the soluble form of ACE2, secondary to ACEI/ARB treatment, may act as a competitive interceptor of SARS‐CoV‐2, thus slowing virus entry and protecting the lungs from injury. 24\n\nThree recently published studies in China reported that hypertensive patients hospitalised with COVID‐19 experienced a lower risk of all‐cause mortality if on treatment with ACEI/ARB compared to ACEI/ARB non‐users.10, 11, 12 Moreover, latest reports showed no evidence that ACE inhibitors or ARB affected the risk of COVID‐19 25 and did not confirm a harmful role of ACEI or ARB in admission to hospital or in‐hospital death. 26\n\nAll the scientific societies have issued statements against any change in the current indications for the use of these medications in view of well documented beneficial effects.27, 28\n\nHence, the aim of the present study is to analyse the association between treatment with ACEI or ARB and in‐hospital death and/or the need of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, among hypertensive patients hospitalised with COVID‐19.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe main finding of the present study was that among patients with hypertension hospitalised for COVID‐19, treatment with ACEI or ARB was not associated with an increased risk of in‐hospital death. Moreover, no differences were highlighted between treatment with ACEI compared to ARB.\n\nInitial epidemiological reports from China have shown that hypertension and diabetes, as well as other cardiovascular diseases, are highly prevalent among COVID‐19 patients.6, 7, 8 Among patients who experienced worse outcomes, including need for ICU admission, use of mechanical ventilation and death,6, 7, 33, 34 the prevalence of hypertension was much higher compared to that of less severe COVID‐19 patients. Likewise, in a study evaluating the prognosis of SARS CoV‐2 patients admitted to ICU, the prevalence of hypertension was higher among patients who died compared to that of patients who could be stabilised and discharged from the ICU. 9 In addition, an analysis of the characteristics of COVID‐19 related deaths in Italy documented that 73% of the patients (mean age 79 years) had an established diagnosis of hypertension, and 30 and 17% respectively, reported a treatment with ACEI or ARB. 35\n\nCollectively, these evidences have suggested a link between hypertension and the severity of COVID‐19 infection. Furthermore, a growing concern has developed that the use of antihypertensive medications, mainly ACEI and ARB, may have contributed to the adverse outcomes observed in the initial studies of COVID‐19 patients.2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\n\nIndeed, since SARS‐CoV2 binds to ACE2 receptor to infect host cells, it has been hypothesised that ACEI and ARB could upregulate ACE2 expression leading to an increased susceptibility to viral entry and propagation.15, 17 Furthermore, it has been postulated that the up‐regulation of ACE2 could increase the lung viral load and worsen the respiratory disease severity. 17\n\nHowever, recent studies did not confirm these concerns. Yang et al., 12 conducted a retrospective study including 126 COVID‐19 patients with hypertension of whom 43 (34%) patients were on ACEI or ARB treatment. Compared to ACEI/ARB non‐users, those on ACEI or ARB experienced a lower death rate but failed to reach statistical significance. Another Chinese study on 362 hypertensive patients with COVID‐19, of whom 115 (32%) were on ACEI or ARB, suggested that these medications were not associated with COVID‐19 severity or mortality. 11 Furthermore, Zhang et al. 10 had recently published a retrospective multi‐centre study in China including 1128 hypertensive adult patients diagnosed with COVID‐19. One hundred and eighty‐eight (17%) patients using ACEI/ARB were paired at 1:1 based on a propensity matching with patients using other anti‐hypertensive medications. Use of ACEI/ARB was associated with a lower risk of COVID‐19 mortality at 28 days, albeit the authors themselves admit that residual confounding cannot be ruled out. More recently, a large population‐based study conducted in Italy did not provide evidences that ACEI or ARB could affect the risk of COVID‐19 infection. 25\n\nIn this study, we did not find an association between treatment with ACEI or ARB and the in‐hospital death (Fig. ). Similarly, a case‐population study done in Spain showed that there is no evidence of a causal relationship between ACE2 levels and outcomes in COVID‐19 patients, nor is it known conclusively if a higher viral load is associated with a worse prognosis in SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. Moreover, ACEI or ARB did not increase the risk of COVID‐19 requiring admission to hospital. 26\n\nThe findings of our study failed to demonstrate that patients on ACEI/ARB could experience a higher risk of the combined end‐point of in‐hospital death and ICU admission suggesting that ACEI or ARB treatment did not influence only the risk of death, but also the course of disease. Furthermore, we could not document any differential impact on the outcomes between ACEI and ARB (Fig. ) but, due the relatively small sample size, this finding remains questionable. Indeed, the evidence prior to the COVID‐19 era was mixed. A systematic review has indicated that ACEI, but not ARB, have a protective role towards the risk of community‐acquired pneumonia and its related mortality. 36 In contrast, among patients with COPD, it has been suggested that ARB might be more effective than ACEI to reduce the severity and mortality due to COPD. 37\n\nMoreover, in our cohort of COVID‐19 patients, among the comorbidities analysed, a history of COPD showed a higher prevalence among non‐survivor patients. Likewise, in a recent meta‐analysis, COVID‐19 infection was associated with substantial severity and mortality rates in patients with COPD. 38 In addition, although in a limited sample, the present data suggest that the risk of death could be age‐dependent, confirming what is stated in other surveys.9, 34, 39 However, no sufficient data were available to demonstrate the independent role of age. Indeed, in a previous report, mortality appeared not predicted by advanced age. 40\n\nTypically, COVID‐19 patients present with fever, myalgia or fatigue and dry cough. 7 Severe cases progress to severe dyspnoea and hypoxaemia usually within 1 week after the onset of symptoms. 41 In hospitalised COVID‐19 patients, the prevalence of hypoxaemic respiratory failure is approximately 20%, and more than 25% may require intensive care treatment. 42 In the present study, we elected to focus on the worse case scenario, for example, death or the composite of death/ICU admission during hospital stay. In order to account for the different clinical severity at presentation, patients were stratified according to NEWS, a widely adopted early warning score. The NEWS score is based on a rapid and quantitative assessment of changes in vital signs, 43 and was developed to identify and track patients at risk of deterioration in non‐critical areas of the hospital in order to ensure an early stabilisation and ICU transfer and to prevent avoidable cardiac arrest. 44 In recent years, the NEWS score has been validated in the ED setting to predict ICU admission and mortality. 45 Furthermore, although not yet validated, the NEWS score has recently been proposed for the triage of COVID‐19 patients in ED. 41 The findings of our study document that patients with a more severe degree of respiratory illness, defined by a NEWS score ≥2 at presentation, were at high risk of rapid deterioration, with a consistent increased risk of death and death/ICU admission.\n\nThese results are consistent with those reported in a recent prospective cohort study in which the NEWS score at hospital admission appeared superior to the quick Sepsis‐Related Organ Failure Assessment score and other widely used clinical risk scores in prediction of severe disease and in‐hospital mortality from COVID‐19. 46 However, larger studies are needed to confirm this finding, and to investigate the optimal cut‐off value for clinical use.\n\nAs for any retrospective study, several limitations are worth considering. First, despite a fair sample size, the number of events was small thus limiting the power of our study. The study was conducted at a single medical centre and, as such, the findings might be not representative of the general population of COVID‐19 patients. The study focussed on the worse case scenarios, that is, in‐hospital death or death/ICU admission. For this reason, we cannot extrapolate the findings to different outcomes as length of hospital stay, other complications, permanent need of oxygen support, loss of autonomy or need to transfer to residential nursing facilities. Similarly, the effect of ACEI/ARB might be different among patients managed in the outpatient setting. Finally, some patients might have been excluded from the analytical sample because it was suggested to interrupt ACEI/ARB treatment due to prior concerns."
