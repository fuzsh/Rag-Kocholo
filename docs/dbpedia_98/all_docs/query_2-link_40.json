        "text": "It was within this architectural and ceremonial framework that the ducal court developed. In comparison with the semifeudal states of the Este in Ferrara, the Gonzaga in Mantova, the Sforza in Milan, the Montefeltro in Urbino, the Aragona in Naples, or even the courts of cardinals in Rome, fifteenth-century Florence had no court. [46] Lorenzo de' Medici had some precious gems engraved \"LAV.R\" (Laurentius Rex), but his title \"Magnifico\" was only a dim reflection of court life elsewhere. \"The honorific Magnifico was a common formula by which rich men without claim to any better title were addressed,\" a recent historian of the Este court at Ferrara in the fifteenth century writes: \"the Este court had a liberal supply of Magnificos, and at least one Magnifica.\" [47] A statement by the Venetian ambassador Vincenzo Fedeli in 1561 has sometimes been taken as evidence that there was little court life under Cosimo I:\n\n[Cosimo, Duke of Florence and Siena] formerly did everything in the grand manner, to match his administration and his government of the state, but has for some time been extremely quiet and retired. He lives not in the accustomed luxury of dukes and princes, but as the head of a leading family. He eats with his wife and children, with no elaborate ceremony. Nor do his children have their own table and other expenses, as is the way at other courts; here there is a single court and one set of household expenses. . . . He has stopped feeding and maintaining all comers as he did, save on his rural estates, and occasionally. [48]\n\nThe Medici court grew gradually during the sixteenth century. The dukes surrounded themselves with court functionaries typical of semifeudal courts elsewhere. Secretaries (segretari) attended the duke in his study, a Maggiordomo managed the household, gentlemen (camerieri) attended his bedchamber and scalci, coppieri, credenzieri the private table; ladies-in-waiting (damigelle) attended the duchesses. Further officials attended the common household table (tinello) and the wardrobe (guardaroba); equerries (scudieri) attended the stables. There were other attendants—staffieri, paggi, musicians, artists, and cooks and lesser servants—not to mention artisans and workmen in the city who provided furnishings and services. The Medici court was a latecomer among the princely courts of Italy, but it developed splendidly. Personnel of the court are revealed partly from lists of the salariati of the dukes that were compiled from the initial rolls (although only the names of the higher personnel were copied out) at the end of the seventeenth century. [50] Some of these have been linked to the censuses to further demonstrate the import of the transition from Palazzo Vecchio to Palazzo Pitti.\n\nThe first lists of salariati, for 1540-43, supply the names of ten secretaries, a Maggiordomo, three gentlemen of the table, three gentlemen of the chamber, two equerries, and three artists (Bronzino, Francesco Salviati, and Bartolommeo Bandinelli)—a total, with certain other individuals, of about forty, not counting lesser servants and guards. By 1550-51 the total had grown to some seventy-nine, which included ten secretaries, twelve gentlemen of the table, seven gentlemen of the chamber for the duke, eleven ladies-in-waiting for the duchess, ten equerries, and the artists Bronzino, Bandinelli, and Cellini. In 1560-61 there were some seventy-three, always omitting lesser servants and guards. But the court had grown in size to a total of some 168 in 1564 when Francesco I attained his majority and assumed effective government of state, to some 233 on the accession of Ferdinando I in 1587. On the accession of Cosimo II in 1609 there were 359 functionaries, and on the accession of Ferdinando II in 1621, when households of two dowager duchesses along with those of the young duke and his brothers were also included, there were 457. In comparison, the court of Vincenzo I Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua, numbered 383 in 1591; the court of Ranuccio I Farnese, Duke of Parma and Piacenza, numbered 226 in 1593; and the court of Alfonso II d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, numbered 480 in 1598. [51] By the end of the sixteenth century the Medici court clearly equaled, and had even begun to surpass in size, the courts of other Italian states.\n\nThe personnel of the court are important because they help identify men close to the duke. In a famous discourse of 1516, Lodovico Alamanni, a republican patrician of the Medici party, had advised the Medici to create a kind of court among young patricians of the city by giving them positions in the military, making them secretaries or ambassadors, or employing them elsewhere in the administration (\"the young easily . . . adopt courtly manners\"). [52] But the lists of salariati indicate that Cosimo I took a different route, at least for his own household; few court personnel of the mid-sixteenth century were recruited among patrician families from the Republic. Cosimo surrounded himself with men who gave him independence from the patrician elite, and with individuals from the Florentine territorial state who helped define the court as a central feature of Florence as a Tuscan capital.\n\nIn the lists of salariati for 1540-43 and 1550-51, a sizeable number of men appear who we have not counted as \"courtiers\": ambassadors and other agents abroad, Camerlinghi or Provveditori of different financial offices in the administration (the Monte Comune, Dogana, Sale, Gabella dei Contratti, Zecca [Mint]), along with important military officers, the Commissario delle Bande and of the Galere di S.E. (the small fleet) and Capitani delle Bande (of Arezzo, Pisa, Fivizzano, the Mugello, Valdarno, Romagnia), and other commanders of cavalry, infantry, and lancie spezzate. Cosimo exercised control of the central administration and of his military by personally paying certain key officials. These additional names had disappeared by the end of the Sienese war. Among \"courtiers,\" none of the ducal secretaries were Florentine patricians in 1540-43 or in 1550-51; instead, provincial men were prominent: Ugolino Grifoni from S. Miniato al Tedesco, Cristofano and Lorenzo Pagni from Pescia, Giovanni Conti from Bucine, and Bartolommeo Concini from Terranuova. The gentlemen of the chamber included foreigners of seemingly modest rank: Claudio da Napoli, Girolamo da Ferrara, Leone da Carpi, Stefano Lalli da Roma, Sforza Almeni da Perugia (of whom more later). Spanish names appear among the attendants and ladies-in-waiting of Eleonora di Toledo: Antonio Ramirez da Montauto, Porzia da Aldana, Lena and Lucrezia Mendozza, Anna Pontes.\n\nThen among courtiers in 1560-61 feudal titles appear more prominently: Cosimo and Pandolfo de Bardi, counts of Vernio; Bishop Giovanni Battista da Ricasoli (the Ricasoli fief at Trappola and Rocca Guicciarda near the Sienese border was restored by Cosimo I in 1564); Marchese Taddeo of Monte Santa Maria (along the border with the Papal States); Marchesi Giovanni Gaspero and Alessandro Malaspina da Mulazzo (toward Pontremoli to the north). The court assumed a distinctly feudal tone. The number of fiefs granted to favorites of the court increased after the Sienese war, often in the territory of Siena. The military commander Luigi di Niccolò (Ciappino) Vitelli received the fief of Cetona as a marquisate from Cosimo I in 1558, Don Antonio da Montauto \"cameriere e coppiere di S.E.\" the marquisite of Sassetta in 1563, the rich Portuguese merchant Sebastiano di Tommaso Ximines d'Aragona later received the marquisate of Saturnia from Ferdinando I in 1593. In 1604 there were fifteen fiefs, but by 1650 there were forty-seven, many of which were ultimately acquired by Florentine patricians. [53] In 1562 Cosimo I created the military and naval Order of St. Stephen, ostensibly to fight the Turks in the Mediterranean. The Order appealed to the military ethos of court society and became a usual way of demonstrating the nobility of families. Families founding a Commenda (a living in the Order) were ennobled if they were not already recognized with this standing. More than a thousand knights were created by the first three dukes, and in their attempt to have a glittering following half were nobles from elsewhere in Italy or abroad, chiefly Spaniards. Another quarter came from provincial Tuscan towns. The remainder were Florentines, mainly from republican patrician families, who in this way demonstrated their entry into the court circle. [54]\n\nThe list of court salariati for 1632, during the reign of Duke Ferdinando II, has eighty-nine names—clearly only part of the total court personnel at this date. [55] Of the eleven secretaries five had the title Bali or Cavaliere, indicating membership in the Order of St. Stephen. Among the twenty-eight gentlemen of the chamber (camerieri), one had the title of duke, six were marquises, three were counts, and nine were Bali or Cavalieri. Among the ten equerries (scudieri), there were two marquises and two knights. Clearly, the ennoblement of the court had advanced since the time of Cosimo I, and Florentine patrician families had now made their appearance. The secretaries included two patricians (one of whom was a Knight of St. Stephen), and among the gentlemen of the chamber there were five (one of whom was also a knight); the equerries included one patrician without title.\n\nWhere did courtiers live? It is clear that some lived in the Palazzo Vecchio or in Palazzo Pitti. There is talk of gentlemen of the chamber and ladies-in-waiting who lived \"nel palazzo\" at the time of Cosimo I. Later, there is talk in inventories of Palazzo Pitti of chambers, folding beds, and many mattresses. [56] But most courtiers had independent addresses in the city. The censuses do not provide much assistance with the two palaces—in 1551 and 1561 no inhabitants were listed in Palazzo Vecchio or Palazzo Pitti, and the census of 1632 listed only eighty-three individuals living in Palazzo Pitti. But it is possible to link names from the lists of salariati with names appearing in the censuses. This presents some problems, because the court lists are not complete and names do not always appear in the two sources in the same way. Also, the censuses list only the names of heads of households; the names of subordinate household members were not given. Still, some linkages can be verified, and the censuses provide additional names not appearing in the lists of salariati whose occupations clearly identify them as personnel of the court: \"segretario di S. Ecc.,\" \"staffiere della duchessa,\" \"staffiere di S. Ecc.,\" and so on. The censuses also identify many artisans and workers in the city who provided services to the court, occupational titles such as \"Barbiere di S. Ecc.,\" \"Cocchiere del Principe,\" \"Guardia di S. Ecc.,\" \"Ortolano a Boboli,\" \"Sarto di S. Ecc.,\" a level of activity not recorded in the lists of salariati. Thus a rough assessment is possible of the location of courtiers who did not live \"nel palazzo,\" and also of the growing sector of employment in court service.\n\nSome examples help to clarify the picture in 1551 and 1561. Only thirty-seven of the seventy-nine names in the court list can be found in the 1551 census, but five additional households were added from the census occupations. None of the eleven ladies-in-waiting to the duchess could be located and only one of the four attendants to the young Prince Francesco (perhaps these lived in Palazzo Vecchio). Among the seven ducal secretaries of the ten located, three lived in crowded quarters near the Zecca (where the short arm of the Uffizi was later built): Pirro Musefilo in a household with six servants, and Domiziano Cappelli and Vincenzo Ricciobaldi, each with one (all in square 60 ). Another secretary, Cristofano Pagni from Pescia, lived with two servants just north of Piazza della Signoria, in Via dei Cimatori ( square 49 ). The chief ducal auditore, Lelio Torelli, lived in a household with eleven servants in the piazza overlooking Palazzo Pitti south of the Arno ( square 77 ), although in 1561 he had moved to another house in Via de Ginori ( square 16) directly behind Palazzo Medici.\n\nThree of the seven gentlemen of the chamber also lived close to the Palazzo Vecchio: Captain Leone da Carpi in Via Baldraccia (behind what became the long arm of the Uffizi), Girolamo da Troti from Ferrara (with 2 servants) in Via dei Gondi, and Claudio Gaetani from Naples (with 3 servants) lived in Via Vaccareccia just west of Piazza Signoria (all in square 60 ). However, the cupbearer Sforza Almeni, who had a long career of service to Cosimo I until his death (at the duke's hand) in 1566, lived with ten servants in a palace in Via dei Servi confiscated from the Taddei and awarded to him in 1546 ( square 17 ). Of the four of ten equerries located, Alessandro Palesi (1 servant) lived near the church of S. Piero Scheraggio and Giulio Benozzi (2 servants) lived in Via dei Gondi (both square 49 ); Carlo da Spelle (1 servant) and Cesare dell' Amica (2 servants) lived in Borgo dei Greci, just east of Palazzo Vecchio ( square 50).\n\nIn 1560-61 about the same number of individuals from the court list could be found in the census (35 of 73, but 23 more were added from census occupations), and they also lived near the Palazzo Vecchio. Again, none of the ladies-in-waiting to the duchess could be found in the census, and no attendants to Prince Francesco were named in the court list. All but three of the fifty-eight households linked lived north of the Arno, and twenty-five (43 percent) lived in the four squares ( squares 49, 50, 60, 61 ) immediately contiguous to the palazzo. Neither of the two artists (Giambologna and Bernardo Buontalenti) could be found in the census, but Giorgio Vasari (who was not in this court list) lived not far away in Borgo S. Croce ( square 51).\n\nIn 1632 the picture was quite different. Of the eight-nine names of higher court functionaries in the court list, forty-eight households were found in the census (and 53 others were added from census occupations, a total of 101). Among these, 28 percent were located north of the Arno, and 73 percent south of the Arno in the S. Spirito quarter. Twenty-seven percent were in the four squares ( squares 66, 76, 77, 83) immediately contiguous to Palazzo Pitti. The court had clearly moved closer to the new ducal palace, although court households were not as heavily concentrated close to Palazzo Pitti as they had been to Palazzo Vecchio in 1561. The more common use of coaches may have made more distant habitations practical. Also, the higher social standing of the court in the seventeenth century required more opulent and thus more scattered places of residence.\n\nThe court structure under Ferdinando II in 1632 also differed from that which had prevailed under Cosimo I. The young duke (he was 22 years old) did not marry until 1634, and he had four younger brothers. His mother Maria Maddalena d'Austria died in 1634, while his grandmother Christine of Lorraine survived until 1636. There was a chief auditore and eleven secretaries of state, twenty-nine gentlemen of the bedchamber, ten equerries, a secretary and three ladies-in-waiting for the dowager duchesses, and four tutors or secretaries for the brothers. Beyond this was the household staff, from the Mastro di Casa downward, and four artists, Matteo Nigetti (\"architetto\") (ca. 1560-1648), Giusto Sutterman (\"pittore\") (1597-1681), Pietro Tacca (\"scultore\") (1577-1642), and Girolamo Frescobaldi (\"musico\") (1583-1643). Of the auditore and eleven secretaries of state, eight were located in the census. The auditore Giulio Cavallo lived in a household with four servants in Piazza Signoria ( square 49 ). The first secretary Bali Andrea Cioli (5 servants, Via Guicciardini, square 77 ), Bali Tommaso de' Medici (7 servants, Via Maggio, square 76 ), and Cavaliere Lorenzo Corboli (5 servants, Via S. Agostino, square 75 ) all lived close to Palazzo Pitti toward the west. Geri Bocchineri (4 servants, Costa S. Giorgio, square 78 ) lived toward the east, behind the palace. Only two secretaries lived north of the river—Lorenzo Usimbardi in the palace his family had bought from the Acciaiuoli in 1603 (9 servants, Borgo SS. Apostoli, square 59 ), and Giovan Francesco Guidi (4 servants, Via Rondinelli, square 35).\n\nAmong the thirteen households found among twenty-nine gentlemen of the chamber, Cavaliere Costanzo Bellincini (6 servants, square 77 ) lived in Piazza Pitti, Marchese Camillo del Monte (40 servants, in Palazzo Dei-Guadagni in Piazza S. Spirito) and Priore Attilio Incontri (8 servants, Via Maggio, both in square 76 ), Marchese Francesco Malaspina (7 servants, Via S. Agostino) and Marchese Francesco Coppoli (1 servant, Via dei Serragli, both in square 75 ), Marchese Roberto Capponi (9 servants, in Palazzo Ludovico Capponi, square 65 ), and Cavaliere Andrea Carlotti (2 servants, Via Romana, square 83 ) lived in the zone west of Palazzo Pitti. Giulio Vitelli (8 servants, Borgo S. Niccolo, square 69 ) lived behind the palazzo. Only two gentiluomini lived north of the river: Prior Donato dell' Antella (9 servants, Piazza S. Croce, square 51 ) and Bali Carlo Marsili (5 servants, Via dei Cimatori, square 49 ). One can still see today in the S. Spirito quarter gracious renovated façades or portals of palaces of members of the ducal court. Among the three artists, however, only one, the painter Giusto Sutterman (3 servants, Via S. Giovanni, square 73 ), lived in S. Spirito. Architect Matteo Nigetti (1 servant, Via Larga, square 26 ), sculptor Pietro Tacca (4 servants, Borgo Pinti, square 12 ), and composer Girolamo Frescobaldi (1 servant, Via delle Belle Donne, square 46) lived north of the river.\n\nThe construction, or renovation, of palaces by members of the ducal court effected an evolution of architectural style in the city. Just as the ducal court added a new level of political influence to Florence as capital, the court architects introduced a new level and standard in taste. The more severe Florentine Renaissance classicism of the age of Brunelleschi gave way to a new mannerist style, often reflective of Rome, of the court architects Giorgio Vasari, Bartolommeo Ammannati, and Bernardo Buontalenti, all influenced by Michelangelo. Given the crowded conditions in the center city (despite the legislation of 1551 that had eased the enlargement of house lots) entirely new palaces were likely to be on more peripheral sites where there was more available space. A likely development was that members of the court appropriated existing palaces and renovated them. Sensitivity to tradition, however, gave rise to legislation in 1571 forbidding removal of the coats of arms \"and memories of the builders and founders\" from older palaces, although new additional arms could be put up with the consent of the Capitani di Parte Guelfa. [57]\n\nMost new palaces of the sixteenth century were north of the Arno, befitting the location of the court in that period. Significant new, or redecorated, places of the period of Cosimo I and Francesco I were commissioned by Sforzo Almeni (Vasari), Giovanni Uguccioni (Folfi?), and by Ugolino Grifoni, Antonio Ramirez da Montauto, Fabio da Mondragone, and Simone da Firenzuola (Ammannati). Sforzo Almeni, from Perugua—his father had served Cosimo's mother Maria Salviati—entered the service of Cosimo I in 1545 and he remained a gentleman of the chamber, or cupbearer, until the duke, in an apoplectic rage, stabbed him to death in the Boboli gardens in 1566. In 1546 Cosimo awarded him with a palace in Via dei Servi ( square 17 ) that had been confiscated from Pietro Taddei after the Battle of Montemurlo in 1537. There were other confiscations of republican palaces at this time, and in the years that followed, from the Strozzi, Girolami, Salviati, Valori, and Altoviti, and after the Pucci conspiracies of 1559 and 1574 from the Pucci, Ridolfi, and Capponi. Almeni redecorated the Taddei palace, first with a large escutcheon bearing the arms of the Medici and of Eleonora di Toledo. A taste developed for façades frescoed with allegorical subjects, or decorated with grey and white sgraffiti carved into the stucco spread, and among the first were palaces belonging to members of the court. Giovanni Battista da Ricasoli, bishop of Cortona, had the Ricasoli palace ( square 57) frescoed with biblical scenes by Francesco Pagani in 1553. The frescoes on Palazzo Almeni were designed by Vasari after his return from Rome in 1554 and were executed by Cristoforo Gherardi. As Vasari wrote: \"Bishop Ricasoli, to do something pleasing to His Excellency, put his hand to having the three façades of his palace frescoes in chiaroscuro . . . when Messer Sforza Almeni, cupbearer and first and most favorite [gentleman of the chamber] of the duke, resolved to also have his house in Via dei Servi painted in chiaroscuro, in competition with the bishop.\" [58] In addition to an escutcheon with the arms of the Medici and Toledo that showed his membership in the court, Palazzo Almeni displayed sgraffito frescoes with a vast panorama of the ages of man, from infancy to old age, each age accompanied by its virtues—the theological virtues, the seven liberal arts, the seven planets, action and contemplation, death, the inferno, resurrection—as well as roundels showing Cosimo founding Cosmopoli (Portoferraio) and the insignia of the Almeni. [59]\n\nGiovanni Uguccioni, from a minor republican family, also appears in the court lists of the 1550s (associated with Girolamo degli Albizzi, the Commissario delle Bande), and his brother Benedetto, made a senator in 1578, was the general overseer of the ducal estates under Cosimo I, Francesco I, and Ferdinando I. The portrait bust of Francesco I mounted by Benedetto over the portal of Palazzo Uguccioni underscored the family connection with the court. The Uguccioni palace was centered on the north side of Piazza Signoria ( square 49 ); it was built following a Roman plan, apparently from a model by the Florentine Mariotto Folfi (1521-1600). A dispensation allowed the palace to intrude a few feet into the piazza. Contemporary rumor had it that the plan had been drawn by Raphael, or even Michelangelo. [60] A portrait bust of the duke mounted above the portal was a feature popular among members of the court. A bust of Cosimo I had been both on the house of Baccio Bandinelli in Via dei Ginori ( square 16 ) and on the palazzo of Senator Baccio Valori in Via degli Albizzi ( square 37); others followed, of Francesco I, Ferdinando I, and Cosimo II. [61]\n\nUgolino Grifoni, from S. Miniato al Tedesco, had been the Maggiordomo of Alessandro de' Medici. He served as secretary under Cosimo and later was associated with the Order of St. Stephen. He had built a palace at S. Miniato, and with his brothers bought houses from the Ricci family in Florence—the entire southwest corner of Piazza SS. Annunziata ( square 10 )—where he commissioned a large and sumptuous palace from Ammannati that was completed in 1574. Its rusticated portals echoed the portals of Palazzo Pitti. The family remained there into the eighteenth century. Antonio Ramirez da Montauto, from the house of Alva in Castille, rose in Florence in the entourage of Eleonora di Toledo, serving as tutor to Don Giovanni de' Medici, as coppiere to the duchess, and then as a gentleman of the chamber to the duke. He was made Lord of Sasseta by Cosimo in 1563 and a Knight of St. Stephen in 1567. He bought houses in Borgo degli Albizzi in 1558-62 ( square 37 ), employing Ammannati to join them together behind a single façade, which was complete in 1568. Here, too, the ducal arms were prominently displayed and, as with Palazzo Almeni, sgraffito decorations were added followed a scheme of Vincenzo Borghini, the iconographer of court spectacles under Cosimo. These showed the chief virtues appropriate to the servant of a prince (temperance, prudence, fidelity, affection, strength, and perseverance), the effects of these virtues (security, obedience, and solicitude), and their rewards (benevolence, contentment, authority, wealth, repose, and fame). [62] Don Fabio de Arizzola, Marchese di Mondragone, also came to Florence in the entourage of Eleonora di Toledo; he served as a tutor to Francesco I. In 1567 he had an architect (possibly Ammannati) restructure houses he had bought in Via dei Banchi ( square 34 ) into a single palace, but he fell from favor and the palace was sold to the patrician Carnesecchi family. [63] Certainly the most beautiful of the Ammannati palaces was the one built entirely new ca. 1565-77 in Via degli Alfani ( square 18) for Simone da Firenzuola from a minor republican family. He was enriched as a merchant in Rome, where he may have known the architect. But he was not an intimate of the Medici court, although his wealth and aspirations would eventually have gained his family access to it had he not died without male heirs. The beautiful palace passed by the marriage of a daughter to the Florentine patrician Giugni family, a favorite of the court of Duke Ferdinando II. [64]\n\nDuring the Sienese war military commanders appeared in prominent places at court and in the city. In 1544 Ciappino Vitelli bought the Gualfonda villa and gardens from the Bartolini in the periphery of the city ( square 13 ), and in 1555 the Marchese di Marignano, Cosimo's commander during the Sienese war, was awarded houses that had belonged to Bindo Altoviti in Via del Parione ( square 58 ). The Altoviti palace soon returned to the Medici, and in 1599 the impoverished nephew of Vitelli sold the Gualfonda villa to the Riccardi, a lesser Florentine family in the fifteenth century who had enriched themselves through banking at Pisa and reestablished themselves in Florence in the 1490s. The great fortune of the Riccardi stemmed from Giovanni di Gabbriello Riccardi (1520-1568) and his three sons Francesco, Giovanni, and Riccardo. Their progress toward the court was marked by their purchase of the palace in Via Maggio, earlier redecorated by Buontalenti for Bianca Cappello in 1586 ( square 76 ), a large country villa previously owned by the Soderini in 1589, and then the Gualfonda villa and garden. Here they offered a sumptuous entertainment in 1600 on the occasion of the departure of Marie de' Medici to France. [65] The Riccardi ascended further in the seventeenth century when they were made marchesi of Chianni and Rivalto, near Pisa, by Ferdinando I in 1629 and 1634. They ultimately bought the old Medici palace in Via Larga in 1659, which they subsequently enlarged and redecorated. A somewhat similar ascent was enjoyed, if on a smaller scale, by a Portuguese family of wealthy merchants in Antwerp, the three sons of Tommaso Ximines [Jiménez] di Aragona: Ferdinando, Emanuele, and Sebastiano. They received the marquisate of Saturnia in 1593. In 1603 they bought a palace built ca. 1500 by the architects Giuliano and Antonio da Sangallo ( square 7); it was enlarged and redecorated for the Ximines by Gherardo Silvani (1579-1675) in the early seventeenth century. [66]\n\nAs the court moved south of the Arno the ducal secretaries began to acquire palaces closer to Palazzo Pitti. The Usimbardi, from a family of notaries in Colle, were early favorites of Duke Ferdinando I. The elder brother Pietro di Francesco was first secretary of the duke in 1587-91 and was made a senator in 1615; the next brother Lorenzo served as a ducal secretary in 1591-1616, the third brother Usimbardo became bishop of Colle in 1592, and the fourth and fifth brothers, Claudio and Fulvio, also held offices in Florence. All profited; the Usimbardi patrimony in the early seventeenth century was thought to be worth \"about 200,000 scudi.\" In 1603 the brothers bought the palace of the Acciaiuoli (Borgo SS. Apostoli, square 59), who had been ruined by an earlier failure of the De' Ricci bank. They renovated and redecorated it with interior frescoes by Bernardino Poccetti (1548-1612), and their picture gallery was said to have contained at least seven portraits of members of the Medici family. But the Acciaiuoli repurchased the palace on the extinction of the Usimbardi in 1663. [67]\n\nFrancesco Vinta, from Volterra, a secretary of Cosimo I in 1551, headed another family that rose through the court. His son Paolo served as a ducal secretary under Cosimo I, Francesco I, and Ferdinando I, and was made a senator in 1593; his brother Belissario, made a senator in 1609, served as secretary under these three dukes and under Cosimo II as well. In 1609 Belissario bought the old Tempi palace (Piazza S. Maria Soprarno, square 67 ) adorning its façade with a bust of Cosimo II and an inscription reading \"Quarto M[eo] Domino ac Moecena,\" since by then he had served four dukes. The family of still another secretary of Ferdinando I, Cavaliere Camillo Guidi, who was made a Knight of St. Stephen in 1593, settled permanently in the S. Spirito quarter. In 1632 the father, Messer Giovan Francesco Guidi from Volterra, still lived north of the Arno (in square 35 ). In 1618 the son bought a Ridolfi palace in Via Maggio, at the end near the church of S. Felice in Piazza ( square 82)—it was the \"casa Guidi . . . by the church,\" Via Maggio 8, where the English poets Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning lived in the nineteenth century. [68]\n\nAlthough palaces there were refurbished, there was not much new building in the S. Spirito quarter. The comings and goings of courtiers undoubtedly created a good rental market to accommodate the many who lived there. The Palazzo Dei-Guadagni in Piazza S. Spirito ( square 82 ), for instance, was rented by the gentleman of the chamber Marchese Camillo del Monte who lived there in 1632, since it was still in possession of the Dei family when they died out in 1683. [69] Via Maggio, however, was on the direct route from Palazzo Pitti over Ponte S. Trinita toward the Duomo. A sector of the wool industry had its shops there in the fifteenth century, but by 1561 few wool shops remained. At least four palaces were built or renovated in Via Maggio in the late sixteenth century: Palazzo Ridolfi-Zanchini (Via Maggio 13, square 76 ), by the Zanchini from Castiglionchino ca. 1585; Palazzo Bianca Cappello (Via Maggio 26, square 76 ), that was rebuilt and decorated with sgraffiti by Bernardo Buontalenti for Bianca Cappello, the lover and later consort of Francesco I (ca. 1579); Palazzo Peruzzi-de' Medici (Via Maggio 28, square 76 ) that was joined together and rebuilt by the Corbinelli family in the late sixteenth century; and the so-called Palazzo della Commenda di Firenze (Via Maggio 42, square 82) that was rebuilt by the Suarez della Conca, a Portuguese family at the court of Ferdinando I in the 1590s. [70]\n\nWe will return in chapter 6 to the growing service sector of the Florentine economy, but at this point it is enough to indicate that households with occupations identifiable in the censuses as providing services to the court grew to a sizeable number, and these also moved from north to south of the Arno. The court became a major focus of the city's luxury service economy. Maps 2.03a-c show the locations of households in service to the court in 1551, 1561, and 1632. A mere thirteen were identified in 1551: an \"armorer of SE\" and a boatman, two musicians, a bell ringer, a cook, a laundress, and several soldiers or guards. These households were scattered through the northern part of the city; none were south of the Arno. In 1561 the number had grown slightly to twenty-nine, and included two households of tapestry makers recently imported from Flanders, the ducal printer, Lorenzo Torrentino, a \"metal founder of SE,\" a tailor, a barber, three musicians, four cooks, three porters, three coachmen, and several soldiers or guards. The only households found south of the Arno were two gardeners (ortolani) who worked in the Boboli gardens, and another household whose head was said to \"work in Palazzo Pitti.\""
