        "text": "Women’s overabundance of the mordant and moribund phlegmatic humour gives feminine hair its lustful, ‘sinful’ connotations in Northern 16th-century medical and theological constructs, where it is closely associated with the pollution of menstruation. The theory of improper humours explains the host of evils associated with the conduct of witchcraft, and Woman’s weaker, softer, ‘unformed’ or ‘defective’ body in the Aristotelian-Galenic paradigm. It is medicalized by Albertus Magnus and his presumed disciple, Pseudo-Albertus Magnus, contributes to a Lutheran iconography of femininity and abject eroticism in Cranach’s melting, malleable feminine forms, and popularized in Baldung’s Mannerist figurations of ideal, allegorical feminine forms. Baldung’s idealised, normatively ‘inverted,’ allegorical, female nudes list and sway like water in the process of being poured – their hair neatly coifed, contained in seemly buns or coils.\n\nOwnership of wild animal furs in Renaissance Italy was a sign of wealth and elevated status. Contrary to modern expectations of conspicuous display, these valuable skins were used as linings for clothing, that is, with the fur on the inside, in contact with the body. Wearing fur on the outside of the garment raised a series of moral issues concerned with the animal basis of fur and its wearer’s relationship to the animal world. For a society that portrayed creatures at the mercy of the basest carnal instincts, such as satyrs, wild men, and the devil, with their bodies covered in hair, the sight of a man wearing fur on his exterior would have triggered analogous mental images. This paper will investigate the complex meanings attributed to fur: its status as a luxury good as well as the visual and symbolic associations to eroticism that inhibited its open display.\n\nCommemorating the fifth centenary of the painter Sandro Botticelli’s death (1445-1510), we pay homage to the work of this renowned Renaissance artist through the relationship between two of his well-known paintings and the texts of two Italian authors: Nastagio degli Onesti and The Birth of Venus exhibit two representations of woman coinciding both in the behavior the Renaissance society expects from her and in Giovanni Boccaccio´s (1313-1375) or Francesco Petrarch’s (1304-1374) medieval models. The pictorial set Nastagio degli Onesti, based upon “The terrible vision” (one of the hundred short stories of Boccaccio´s Decameron), may be understood as a means of a doctrinarian propaganda in accordance with a feudal ideology, that purposes the submission of the female “object” to the male subject, to marriage and to the highest oligarchic interests. The Birth of Venus is, most likely, Botticelli’s masterpiece. Painted at the height of his career, it tries to transpose the aesthetic canon of the Classic world’s pagan Venus to a Christian Laura: woman, as an icon of low and carnal passion, becomes the most higher and spiritual love. As a matter of fact, the beauty of the Botticellian Venus is identified with the Petrarchan Laura, complying also with the Provencal standards to emphasize the corporeal attributes.\n\nThis paper argues that items designed for the bodily extremities such as hair-coverings, hats, fans and other accessories were valued for the ease with which they could be changed and adapted to express a range of different meanings: political, social and individual. They also provided an important point of contact between the world of commerce, the court elites and the wider community of men and women who purchased and used these goods. In studying these often marginalized items, we can explore mechanism for the transmission of concepts of fashion and innovation in the Renaissance period."
