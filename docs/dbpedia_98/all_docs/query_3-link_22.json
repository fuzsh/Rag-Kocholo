        "text": "Intermezzo\n\nSmall meditation about \"big\" and \"little\" objects\n\n\"Big\" and \"little\" shall here be defined as describing the social impact, which a game made during its \"real time\", when it was produced and lived. It's the aim the game research to define such values.\n\nModern bestseller lists for the book market have a similar aim, observations about \"income by visitors of movies\" give values, how popular a movie is in a relevant time. \"Harry Potter\" recently manifested records for both markets ... for the book market already some years ago, for the movie market just in 2011.\n\nSuch lists are unknown for 15th century, so we have to search for other information, which possibly give clues, what really was going on.\n\nFor playing cards one could - one possibility - count the numbers of surviving decks or cards. This method would result in many (\"many\" is relative, actually these are only few) German and many Italian decks during 15th century, less in France, more less in Spain.\n\nFor Italy it would result in many Trionfi decks and only few material for normal decks ... though, every serious researcher agrees, that the conditions of preservation of \"very fine decks\" naturally were far better than those of very cheap decks. So we've lots of worthwhile Trionfi cards surviving in Italy and in the German surviving decks ALSO a great part of elite decks for 15th century.\n\nFor this the method of \"just counting surviving decks\", which would lead to the assumption that during 15th century we had a lot of worthwhile decks and only few cheap playing cards, would be definitely wrong. In fact the relationship between really once produced expensive decks and cheap might be estimated with 1:1000 or 1:10 000 or even much more.\n\nAlthough Ross Caldwell and me both have studied 15th century Trionfi documents in excess, there's a considerable difference in our opinions, how the appearances of the terminus \"Trionfi, ludus triumphorum etc\" has to be evaluated. I think, that cheap Trionfi appeared rather late (and so one should calculate a long phase of low production numbers of this type of deck), Ross considers some mass production VERY EARLY, even before the first appearance of the word in February 1442 (and so high numbers of Trionfi card productions should be calculated).\n\nAs a consequence of these different considerations Ross assumes a very early dominance of decks with 4x14+22-structure, whereby my theory accepts the first appearance of this game form in 1487 with the Boiardo Tarocchi poem, but I've even doubts, if this form was already used for decks which used trumps similar to the later Tarocchi form (trumps with similarities to later Tarocchi existed definitely earlier, there is no doubt about it; the different opinions are about the number of the trumps).\n\nI assume a long state with low production numbers nearly only in \"upper social circles\" (from which the most of the early documents report), which allows a long experimental phase with 5x14-decks and decks with chess associations with 16 or 20 trumps.\n\nThe difference in both considerations is the expected real production number, for Ross the Trionfi card movement is a \"big social impact\" in mid 15th century and I consider a \"little social impact\" limited to the upper society.\n\nNow (back to the theme \"20 figure\") we have two other special objects inside playing card development, once a riddle of \"venti figure\" (= 20 figures) appearing in Naples since 1586/87, and the Tarocco Siciliano, whose \"first appearance\" is accepted in the researches of Dummett and McLeod since 1662.\n\nWell, and additionally there are all these in this thread shown considerations about Trionfi decks with 20 trumps during 15th century, from which one observation (great chess with 20 figures in Italy) might have had a \"little social impact\" (if any), but two others, Lorenzo Spirito's use of a 20-20-20-20-scheme in his lot book and the Great Hazard scheme should be assumed to have had a \"big social impact\". Spirito's book (1482) was a bestseller with many editions and the Hazard game has a well manifested tradition long before playing cards reached Europe.\n\nNow, going to the observation of the \"venti figure\" I see a few appearances in the internet (which is our main research instrument) of this terminus, all of them connected to Naples. I can't conclude from his a \"big social impact\" for this game. However, if I look up the list of allowed games of 1586 ..\n\nIn a report of Nicola Antonia de Giorgio in \"Playing Cards and Tarots in Naples, 15th-18th century\", IPCS vol. 34, number 2, p. 101 (2005), about the game Malcontento the author presents a decree on 6th of April 1585, confirmed 23rd of January [/b]1586, where it is counted as lawful games : \"A piccetto, tarocchi, venti figure, gilè, sbracare, al malcontento, a trapolare, alla gabella, a primiera ordinaria, a primiera scoperta, seu sommaria, et a runfo.\"\n\n... I see it taken (only in Naples) as similar important as other high valued games like Tarocchi, Trappola, Primiera, Runfo and somehow I must accept, it should have been taken once as \"well distributed\" (but only in Naples).\n\nIf I compare now the few appearances of \"venti figure\" to Internet results for Tarocco Siiliano and it's connected term \"Gallerini\" as an expression for Minchiate only used in Sicily and Genova, then I experience, that I found even less about these games (if I omit anything, which just goes back to the recent researches of Michael Dummett).\n\nSo, if I would conclude from existing Internet results to \"real social impacts of games\", then I should conclude, that indeed \"venti figure\" are badly reported and so had only little social impact, but a little more than \"Tarocco Siciliano\" ... so, as you see, I cannot really rely on internet, Tarocco Siciliano had become somehow real with the research of Michael Dummett.\n\nBut, anyway, something of some social importance must be behind the \"20 figure\".\n\nTarocco Siciliano had 20 numbered trumps (and it belonged to Sicily) and the venti figure should have to do something with \"20\" and was located in Naples an this wasn't far away from Sicily.\n\n\"20 figure\" in Naples were earlier and when Tarocco Siciliano got a sort of reality in Sicily it disappeared ... so it looks (at least for the moment). What if both was just the \"same game\", the whole just a matter of name changing, as it is known for \"Trionfi game\" and \"Taroch\" and for Gnav, Malcontento and Cucco (as already discussed)?\n\n****************\n\nPart 5\n\nwell, I wouldn't be shocked, if the \"Venti figure\" of Naples 1585/1586 will explain in future research as something totally not related to 20-figures-games of 15th century and totally not related to Tarocco Siciliano ...\n\n... but for the moment I take it this way.\n\n... .-) ... and at least I know already, that this consideration leads to a not expected, but interesting correspondence, which I didn't saw mentioned in the considerations of Dummett and McLeod.\n\n***************\n\nMilan 1465 and a journey to Naples\n\nNow we have as the deciding social activity, which caused the 4x14+20 structure in the appearances of the 15th Trionfi game [according 5x14-theory], the wedding preparations of Ippolita Sforza in Milan in May 1465.\n\nThe bride Ippolita was dedicated to take her bride journey [a great triumphal action, which could usually endure weeks] from Milan to Naples (with - as one might expect it, if one follows the 5x14 theory and its developments - a Trionfi deck with 20 trumps in her pocket).\n\nThis journey, as history has it, turned out to become a major political scandal, cause Ferrante, king of Naples, killed Sforza's son-in-law Jacopo Piccinino in the mean-time. The bride cavalcade was halted and it caused major diplomatic activities to take the differences between Milan-Naples out of the world. This took months.\n\nFinally Ippolita reached her destination and became quite an accepted member of the Naples court.\n\nby \"Maestro di Ippolita Sforza\"\n\nhttp://www.miniaturaitaliana.com/blog/?p=10856\n\nFor Naples we now have, that Alfonso of Aragon, king of Naples from 1442 - 1458 (lived till a few years before Ippolita's journey), didn't like gambling and the use of playing cards ... as Bisticci described it.\n\nhttp://tarotforum.net/showthread.php?t=92435&highlight=bisticci\n\n\"He strongly condemned gaming, denouncing it as pernicious. He used to tell how, being then 18 years old, he was in Barcelona during the feast of Nativity and, happening to play one evening, he lost some 5 thousand florins. After he had lost them he called one of his chamberlains and bade him to fetch some money. When he was brought he played again and began to win, so that in the end he won back all he had lost and likewise all the money of his fellow-gamesters. With this heap of florins before him, he bade everyone keep quiet, and then bade the chamberlain to fetch the little book of Our Lady, and this having brought, he opened it and then and there made oath, with both his hands on it, swearing and promising to God and the Virgin Mary that he would never play again; a promise, which he kept to the day of his death.\"\n\nAs an indirect confirmation for this anti-playing-cards feelings of Alfonso, we don't have Trionfi card or playing card notes from Naples during the time of Alfonso (at least I don't know them, if there are any).\n\nWe have Trionfi card notes from Naples for the years 1473 and 1474 (a few years later, after Ippolita had arrived there), which is just in the time, when Ferrante prepared marriages for two daughters and a niece:\n\n1. Eleanore d'Aragon married Ercole d'Este in Ferrara (1473)\n\n2. Camilla d'Aragon (niece) married Costanzo Sforza in Pesaro (1475)\n\n3. Beatrice d'Aragon married Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary (1476)\n\nIf one assumes, that Trionfi cards were new in Naples in 1465 with the arrival of Ippolita (who - likely - had a deck with 4x14 + 20 structure), then naturally these later decks from 1473 and 1474 likely followed this model, somehow with \"20 special figures\".\n\nGame \"Venti figure\", Naples 1586\n\nWe have then in 1586 - that's a really long time after Ippolita - a \"venti figure\" card game, which could be traced in the further development only in Naples, as the result of only a little research with not much energy. For the moment there is not much to this game ... it's just a hypothesis, that it might present another \"Tarocchi name\" (as \"Minchiate\" is somehow a \"Tarocchi\" game with another name).\n\nIn matters of politics, the kingdom of Naples disappeared 1501-1504 and with it the high society formed by Alfonso of Aragon's family and possibly also their internal court Trionfi games. Naples was ruled by Spain, and Spain in the older times never took really the Tarocchi cards (at least there is no evidence). It might well be, that in Naples Trionfi cards got out of fashion .. cause political conditions. A long time after (1586) the political conditions might have changed, social reality might have had become more liberal. Tarocchi cards were definitely allowed then (document 1586) and perhaps also an \"older Naples Trionfi game\", which in the modern times got then the name \"Venti Figure\".\n\nAs already said, just an hypothesis.\n\nDummett / McLeod to Tarocco Siciliano\n\nFurthermore we have another rather intensive research of Michael Dummett (he had special favor for these cards) about a rather late Tarocchi development called Tarocco Siciliano. As it is well known, Sicily and Naples are connected by local nearness and often had the same political history. This deck has 22 special cardstrumps, but curiously - different to other Tarocchi versions - it takes two cards as unnumbered, one the \"usual Fool\" and the other called \"Miseria\" or \"Poverta\". So it happened, that the highest trump got the number 20.\n\nusual Fool\n\n\"Miseria\" or \"Poverta\"\n\nI attempt to present the important Dummett/McLeod researches in short form from \"A History of Games Played With the Tarot Pack: The Games of Trumps\", p. 367 - 401,published in 2004. They are, as the authors note, partly dependent on some researches of Franco Pratesi.\n\nAccording Dummett/McLeod the major source for our knowledge about Tarocco Siciliano had been a text inside of 25 volumes of manuscript diaries and 48 manuscript volumes \"Opusculi\" with aspects of Sicilian life, made by ...\n\nFrancesco Maria Emanuele e Gaetani, Marchese di Villabianca\n\nhttp://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Maria_Emanuele_Gaetani_marchese_di_Villabianca\n\n... The manuscripts are housed in the Bibliotheca Communale in Palermo. One of the Opusculi is about games. In this there is information about Tarocco Siciliano and about \"Gallerini\", which is the Sicilian name for Minchiate (Minchiate in Sicily is understood as an obscene expression and likely for this reason wasn't used in Sicily).\n\nThe Tarocco Sicilano (with less cards and trumps, but with two cards similar to Fool) was occasionally addressed as \"little Gallerini\".\n\nThe author Villabianca (lived 1720-1802) wrote the game-chapter likely in 1786. He played himself only till 1766 because of \"deterioting eyesight\". The author thinks, that the game Gallerini became rare at the end of the century. The Tarocco game was mainly played with four hands, a 3-player version reduced the cards and was called Tarocchini. Dummett/Mcleod assume for this reason, that the reduced version with 63 or 64 cards was a later popular production mode, which caused the far spread production of 63-card-versions. They have information from other sources, which say, that till 1862 the 63-cards-deck had been the standard form. After this time the ace of coins (missing in the 63-card-deck as all other aces, all 2s, all 3s and three of the 4s) was generally used in all type of decks to carry a tax-stamp - so also in the Tarocco Siciliano (although it wasn't used in this game).\n\nMy note to this: There was a \"Kingdom of the Two Sicilies\" ...\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Sicilies\n\n... which was established after the Napoleonic wars at the congress of Vienna in 1816 and endured till 1861, when it was overcome by the fights of Garibaldi. One likely has to conclude, that the new tax system of 1862 has a natural relation to the new state Italy in 1861.\n\nFrancesco Caetani, who brought the Tarocco Siciliano to Sicily\n\nVillabianca gives the information, that the Tarocco Siciliano was imported in 1662 or 1663 by ...\n\n******* (from my own researches now)\n\nFrancesco Caetani, 8th duke of Sermoneta, (living 11 March 1613 - says Wikipedia; likely better sources say 1594 - till 9 October 1683)\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francesco_Caetani,_8th_Duke_of_Sermoneta\n\n- \"gentilhomme of the Sanish king\" active in Rome\n\n- Governor in Milan as representative of Spain from 1660-62\n\n- Viceroy of Sicily from September 1662 to April 1667\n\nHe appears especially interested in his garden, and this already in 1620 ...\n\nHe appears variously in the text of cardinal Harrach presented in ...\n\nDie Diarien und Tagzettel des Kardinals Ernst Adalbert von Harrach (1598-1667)\n\nhttp://books.google.com/books?id=fEUFHQSJUOEC\n\n.. for the years 1644, 1655 and 1677, when Harrach met Francesco Caetani in Rome.\n\nThe text is of some importance for general research of games, cause Harrach plays himself rather often. According the introduction (not from Harrach) a list of examples for card games is mentioned: \"Krimpe, Primera, Reversina, Lurtschen, Piccetti, La Bassette, Truccho, l'Hombre, Gänslrupfen, Höllfahren, Baziga, Quindeci, Passadieci, in den Turm, Trik-Track\" ... nothing of this is similar to Tarocchi, Harrach naturally had more relations to games played in Germany/Austria.\n\nThe text uses partly Italian or older German dialect.\n\nCaetani is mentioned (but also elsewhere in the book) for July 1667, a time, when he had given up his engagement as Viceroy of Sicily (which happened April 1667).\n\nHarrach meets Fancesco Caetani, who had been occupied with a game (in isn't told, which sort of game). Although already 74 years old, Caetani looks good.\n\nHere we hear from the second wife of Francesco Caetani, Leonor Mencia Caetani, who asks cardinal Harrach, which festivities he planned for the birthday (12th of July) of the Austrian Empress (17 years old, daughter of the Spanish king, empress since 1666). The cardinal is surprised and doesn't know anything of the birthday and festivities. But he promises to illuminate his house for this occasion.\n\nMargarita Teresa of Spain as child\n\nin 1667\n\nMargarita Teresa of Spain, Holy Roman Empress, in 1667\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margarita_Teresa_of_Spain\n\nThe suspicion exists, that Francesco Caetani might become ambassador for the German emperor. Harrach doesn't know anything about it.\n\nFrancesco's second wife, the \"Pimentella\"\n\nThe second wife of Francesco Caetani since c. 1661 (in earlier full name \"Leonor Mencia Pimentel Moscosa y Toledo\") appears in the text of Harrach as \"Pimentella\" and Harrach is rather interested to have her favor, as she seems to be of some importance for the Empress Maria Anna (1606 - 1646, Empress since 1637, but already married to her husband since 1631; a Spanish king's daughter). Harrach notes the Pimentlla for being present in the Austrian region 1636-39 (then leaving to Spain), then again he meets her in Austrian regions 1446 (in this year the empress died), then again in 1648-49, likey with the function to accompany an Austrian princess to Spain to become the next Queen of Spain. She served as a court lady, and, as it seems, not in low function.\n\nThe Empress and the Spanish Queen\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Anna_of_Spain\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mariana_of_Austria\n\nFor the conditions of the family we see the genealogy ...\n\nhttp://www.genmarenostrum.com/pagine-lettere/letterac/Caetani/caetani.htm\n\nDon Francesco Caetani IV (* Napoli 11-3-1594 + Roma 9-10-1683),\n\n8° Duca di Sermoneta,\n\n4° Marchese di Cisterna, Signore di Bassiano, Ninfa, Norma e San Donato dal 1614 e Patrizio Napoletano;\n\nGentiluomo di Camera del Re di Spagna Filippo IV, compera (7-1641) il ducato di San Marco (confermato Duca 1-8-1641)\n\nCavaliere dell’Ordine del Toson d’Oro dal 27-12-1659, Vicerè di Valenza nel 1660,\n\nrinuncia al ducato di Sermoneta in favore del nipote Gaetano Francesco nel 1660 (?),\n\nVicerè e Governatore del Ducato di Milano 3-1660/9-1662,\n\nVicerè del Regno di Sicilia 24-9-1662/9-4-1667.\n\na) = (contratto: 23-6-1618) Caserta 3-12-1618 Donna Anna Acquaviva d’Aragona\n\n3° Principessa di Caserta dal 1635, figlia ed erede del Principe Don Andrea\n\nMatteo e di Isabella Caracciolo dei Conti di Sant’Angelo (* 1596 + Ariccia\n\n16-9-1659)\n\nb) = 1661 (?) dona Leonor Mencia Pimentel Moscosa y Toledo, figlia di don\n\nAntonio Marchese di Navarra e ministro del Re Filippo IV di Spagna (* 22-10-\n\n1613 + in Spagna 14-1-1685).\n\nSon of first marriage:\n\nDon Filippo II (* Caserta 29-5-1620 + Sermonta 4-12-1687), ebbe\n\nCaivano dalla madre il 6-6-1638, Principe di Caserta dal 1659; Patrizio Napoletano.t\n\na) = 1-4-1642 Donna Cornelia d’Aquino 3° Principessa di Castiglione e\n\nContessa di Nicastro, figlia del Principe Don Cesare e di Donna Laura\n\nd’Aquino Principessa di Castiglione (* Nicastro 18-11-1629 + Roma\n\n15-8-1644)\n\nb) = 1646 Donna Francesca de’ Medici, figlia di Don Ottaviano Principe di\n\nOttaiano e di Donna Diana Caracciolo dei Principi di Avellino (vedi/see)\n\nc) = Palermo 9-1652 Donna Topazia Gaetani, figlia di Don Pietro Marchese di\n\nSortino e Principe di Cassaro e di Antonia Saccano Naselli (* 30-5-1620\n\n+ Cisterna 8-10-1672) (vedi/see), già vedova di Don Giovanni Francesco Fardella\n\nPrincipe di Paceco.\n\nObserving the biography, it seems, that the late marriage to the Pimantella (she 48, himself 67) were part of his promotion to the posts as governor of Valenza (Piedmont; 1660), then governor of Milan (1660-1662) and then as viceroy in Sicily (1662-1667).\n\nTarocco Siciliano - not from Naples ?\n\nBack to Dummett and McLeod: They see from their source (which I don't know, perhaps there's a detail in this text, which is not reported), that the Tarocco Siciliano was NOT FROM NAPLES, but from Rome or Milan. But perhaps they only looked for the \"duke of Sermoneta\" and Sermoneta indeed is located on the territory of the Chiesa, not on territory of the kingdom of Naples. But about Francesco Caitani it is written, that he was born in Napoli and was Patrizio Napoletano as his father was. And, anyway, he had strong relations to the Spanish court.\n\nAnd for Naples ..\n\nNaples was the most populated city in Italy, and third in Europe and, according to many official sources, it was the 7th or 4th most populated city in the world prior to the 19th century. Naples was also the city with the highest amount of typographies in Italy and also had the highest number of theaters and music schools.\n\nIt's difficult to imagine a Duke of Sermoneta with a rather long life (living in 70 km distance to Rome and 160 km distance to Naples) and not taking notice of the cultural life in Naples nearby a least specially when there were good relations to the ruling Spanish kingdom.\n\n*********\n\n...
