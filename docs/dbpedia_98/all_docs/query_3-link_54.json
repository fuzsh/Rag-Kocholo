This post hoc analysis of (AMPLE) trial (NCT00929864) compared efficacy and safety outcomes over 2 years in patients treated with abatacept or adalimumab plus background methotrexate (MTX), who continued GC (≤10 mg/day) versus those who were not receiving GC (no-GC). Of 646 randomized patients, 317 received abatacept + MTX (161 GC, 156 no-GC) and 326 received adalimumab + MTX (162 GC, 164 no-GC). At Year 2, the adjusted mean changes from baseline in Disease Activity Score (DAS28 C-reactive protein (CRP)) and Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) were not significantly different in the GC versus no-GC subgroups receiving abatacept or adalimumab. A similar proportion of patients achieved remission, HAQ-DI score improvement ≥0.3 and radiographic progression rates. No clinically meaningful safety differences were observed between GC versus no-GC subgroups either with abatacept or adalimumab. In patients with active RA of similar baseline disease activity treated with abatacept or adalimumab plus background MTX, there was no additional value of background GC on clinical, functional or radiographic outcomes over two years.

We assayed plasma homoarginine concentrations in 3331 Framingham Offspring Study participants attending examination cycle six (mean age 58.6 years, 53% women). We evaluated correlates of plasma homoarginine and related homoarginine to incident CVD and death. We also classified participants as having higher (upper quartile) versus lower (lower three quartiles) homoarginine and previously assayed asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) concentrations, and created cross-classification groups. We observed 630 incident CVD events and 940 deaths during a median follow-up of 18 years. In multivariable regression analysis, homoarginine was associated positively with male sex, body mass index, anti-hypertensive medication use and systolic blood pressure, but inversely with age and smoking. Higher homoarginine levels were associated with a lower mortality risk (hazard ratio (HR) per SD increment, 0.83, 95% CI: 0.74–0.93) adjusting for standard CVD risk factors, and ADMA. Among the cross-classification groups, participants with higher homoarginine and lower ADMA had a lower mortality risk (HR, 0.81, 95% CI: 0.67–0.98) compared to those with low levels of both. Further studies are needed to dissect the mechanisms of the association of homoarginine and mortality over decades in the community.

An especial link between substance use and sleep seems to exist. While dual disorder patients are certainly at higher risk of experiencing sleep problems, very limited research is available today. Methods: Forty-seven dual disorder hospitalized patients were included in this first study. A complete psychiatric evaluation was performed, and sleep habits, patterns and potential disorders were evaluated with specific sleep scales, as well as anxiety. Results: The global prevalence of insomnia symptoms was considerably higher compared with the general population. Different abuse patterns as a function of concurrent psychiatric diagnosis were found, with no significant gender differences. The association between the investigated sleep parameters and any specific substance of abuse was minor. The addict behavior started in more than half of the patients prior to the main psychiatric diagnosis and close to the beginning of sleep problems. Men had a higher prevalence of insomnia symptoms, together with a higher incidence of anxiety. Overall, subjective daytime functioning was not altered as a consequence of poor sleep. Conclusion: Dual disorder patients face significant sleep disturbances, with low sleep quality. The role of sleep in addiction and dual disorders deserves greater research.

Chronic pancreatitis is the most frequent cause of this pathology in adults. Methods: Patients meeting radiological or histological diagnostic criteria of chronic pancreatitis are enrolled and the stool elastase test is conducted, considering fecal elastase levels >200 µg/g to represent normal pancreatic function, and levels <200 μg/g to indicate the presence of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Additionally, we determine the body mass index of the patients and study their nutritional status and main biochemical and hematological variables, including their glucose and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels. Results: Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is detected in 60% of the patients. Among these, 83.3% are severe cases, and 72% of the latter also are diagnosed with endocrine pancreatic insufficiency (diabetes mellitus). During the nutritional status study, HbA1c levels are significantly higher, and magnesium and prealbumin levels are significantly lower in patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency than in those without this disease. Conclusions: Exocrine and endocrine pancreatic insufficiency are highly prevalent among patients with chronic pancreatitis and an early diagnosis of these diseases is vital to improve the clinical management of these patients and reduce their risk of mortality.

More than 50 monogenic causes of SRNS or FSGS have been identified. Recently, the mutation detection rate in pediatric patients with SRNS has been reported to be approximately 30%. In this study, genotype-phenotype correlations in a cohort of 291 Korean pediatric patients with SRNS/FSGS were analyzed. The overall mutation detection rate was 43.6% (127 of 291 patients). WT1 was the most common causative gene (23.6%), followed by COQ6 (8.7%), NPHS1 (8.7%), NUP107 (7.1%), and COQ8B (6.3%). Mutations in COQ6, NUP107, and COQ8B were more frequently detected, and mutations in NPHS2 were less commonly detected in this cohort than in study cohorts from Western countries. The mutation detection rate was higher in patients with congenital onset, those who presented with proteinuria or chronic kidney disease/ESRD, and those who did not receive steroid treatment. Genetic diagnosis in patients with SRNS provides not only definitive diagnosis but also valuable information for decisions on treatment policy and prediction of prognosis. Therefore, further genotype-phenotype correlation studies are required.

Altered L-arginine (Arg)/nitric oxide (NO) metabolism has been observed in CF patients’ lungs and in connection with malnutrition. The aim of the present study was to investigate markers of the Arg/NO pathway in the plasma and urine of CF patients and to identify possible risk factors, especially associated with malnutrition. We measured the major NO metabolites nitrite and nitrate, Arg, a semi-essential amino acid and NO precursor, the NO synthesis inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and its major urinary metabolite dimethylamine (DMA) in plasma and urine samples of 70 pediatric CF patients and 78 age-matched healthy controls. Biomarkers were determined by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography. We observed higher plasma Arg (90.3 vs. 75.6 µM, p < 0.0001), ADMA (0.62 vs. 0.57 µM, p = 0.03), Arg/ADMA ratio (148 vs. 135, p = 0.01), nitrite (2.07 vs. 1.95 µM, p = 0.03) and nitrate (43.3 vs. 33.1 µM, p < 0.001) concentrations, as well as higher urinary DMA (57.9 vs. 40.7 µM/mM creatinine, p < 0.001) and nitrate (159 vs. 115 µM/mM creatinine, p = 0.001) excretion rates in the CF patients compared to healthy controls. CF patients with pancreatic sufficiency showed plasma concentrations of the biomarkers comparable to those of healthy controls. Malnourished CF patients had lower Arg/ADMA ratios (p = 0.02), indicating a higher NO synthesis capacity in sufficiently nourished CF patients. We conclude that NO production, protein-arginine dimethylation, and ADMA metabolism is increased in pediatric CF patients. Pancreas and liver function influence Arg/NO metabolism. Good nutritional status is associated with higher NO synthesis capacity and lower protein-arginine dimethylation.

Patients with EGIDs usually report impaired quality of life. We aimed to report the clinical and psychological impact of COVID-19 infection in EGID patients. In this prospective web-based study we invited all consecutive EGID patients attending the University Hospital of Salerno (Campania) and Padua (Veneto) to fill an ad hoc COVID-19 survey. Moreover, a telemedicine service for direct consultation was organized. Data regarding the occurrence and perception of COVID-19 infection as well as clinical information were recorded. The study population included 102 EGID patients (mean age 36.6 years, 34 females), of whom 89 had eosinophilic esophagitis, nine had gastroenteritis, and four had colitis. No patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 or had recurrence of his/her primary disease. All of them were adherent to therapy and preventive measures adoption. Most patients were worried because of COVID-19 and social preventing measures but did not consider themselves at major risk or susceptible to COVID-19 or other infections due to their chronic condition or therapy. Female gender and low education level were associated to a higher psychological perception of COVID-19 compared to lockdown status or other demographic and clinical factors (p < 0.05). Overall, COVID-19 had a limited clinical impact on patients with EGIDs. The degree of education and sex, but not the fact of living in a lockdown area, influenced the perception of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

(2) Methods: All participants in this prospective study underwent ultrasonography (US) equipped with the IOTA-ADNEXTM model and subjective assessment by a sonographic expert. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were also generated to compare overall accuracies. The optimal cut-off value of the ADNEX model for excluding benign diseases was calculated. (3) Results: Fifty-nine participants were eligible: 54 and 5 underwent surgery and follow-up computed tomography (CT), respectively. Benign and malignant diseases were confirmed in 49 (83.1%) and 10 (16.9%) participants, respectively. The specificity of the ADNEX model was 0.816 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.680–0.912) in all participants and 0.795 (95% CI, 0.647–0.902) in the surgical group. The area under the ROC curve of the ADNEX model (0.924) was not significantly different from that of subjective assessment (0.953 in all participants, 0.951 in the surgical group; p = 0.391 in all participants, p = 0.407 in the surgical group). The optimal cut-off point using the ADNEX model was 47.3%, with a specificity of 0.977 (95% CI: 0.880–0.999). (4) Conclusions: The IOTA-ADNEX model is equal to gynecologic US experts in excluding benign ovarian tumors. Subsequently, being familiar with this US software may help gynecologic beginners to reduce unnecessary surgery.

In order to better understand the altered milieu of the peritoneal cavity, while acknowledging the reported similarities between endometriosis and neoplastic processes, we applied a multiplex oncology panel to search for specific biomarker signatures in the peritoneal fluid of women with endometriosis, women with deep-infiltrating endometriosis (DIE), as well as controls. In total, 84 patients were included in our study, 53 women with endometriosis and 31 controls. Ninety-two proteins were measured in prospectively collected peritoneal fluid (PF) samples, using the “Proseek® Multiplex Oncology I Panel”. We first compared patients with endometriosis versus controls, and in a second step, DIE versus endometriosis patients without DIE. Out of the 92 analyzed proteins, few showed significant differences between the groups. In patients with endometriosis, ICOS ligand, Endothelial growth factor, E-selectin, Receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2, Interleukin-6 receptor alpha, Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, Fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 ligand, C-X-C motif chemokine 10, Epididymal secretory protein E4 and Folate receptor-alpha were decreased, while Interleukin-6 and Interleukin-8 were increased compared to controls. Looking at patients with DIE, we found Chemokine ligand 19, Stem cell factor, Vascular endothelial growth factor D, Interleukin-6 receptor alpha and Melanoma inhibitory activity to be increased compared to endometriosis patients without DIE. We have shown a distinct regulation of the immune response, angiogenesis, cell proliferation, cell adhesion and inhibition of apoptosis in PF of patients with endometriosis compared to controls. The specific protein pattern in the PF of DIE patients provides new evidence that DIE represents a unique entity of extrauterine endometriosis with enhanced angiogenetic and pro-proliferative features.

The objective of this multi-country study was to assess the most relevant early predictors of employment status in individuals after TBI at one-year post-injury in European countries. Using a prospective longitudinal non-randomized observational cohort (The Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in TBI (CENTER-TBI) project), data was collected between December 2014–2019 from 63 trauma centers in 18 European countries. The 1015 individuals who took part in this study were potential labor market participants, admitted to a hospital and enrolled within 24 h of injury with a clinical TBI diagnosis and indication for a computed tomography (CT) scan, and followed up at one year. Results from a binomial logistic regression showed that older age, status of part-time employment or unemployment at time of injury, premorbid psychiatric problems, and higher injury severity (as measured with higher Injury severity score (ISS), lower Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), and longer length of stay (LOS) in hospital) were associated with higher unemployment probability at one-year after injury. The study strengthens evidence for age, employment at time of injury, premorbid psychiatric problems, ISS, GCS, and LOS as important predictors for employment status one-year post-TBI across Europe.

Long-term in vitro cultures of GCs show significant stem-like characteristics. In the current study, RNA of human ovarian granulosa cells was collected at 1, 7, 15 and 30 days of long-term in vitro culture. Understanding the process of differentiation of GCs towards different cell lineages, as well as the molecular pathways underlying these mechanisms, is fundamental to revealing other possible stemness markers of this type of cell. Identifying new markers of GC plasticity may help to understand the aetiology and recurrence of a wide variety of diseases and health conditions and reveal possible clinical applications of the ovarian tissue cells, affecting not only the reproductive ability but also sex hormone production. Granulosa cells were the subject of this study, as they are readily available as remnant material leftover after in vitro fertilisation procedures and exhibit significant stem-like characteristics in culture. The change in gene expression was investigated through a range of molecular and bioinformatic analyses. Expression microarrays were used, allowing the identification of groups of genes typical of specific cellular pathways. This candidate gene study focused on ontological groups associated with muscle cell morphogenesis, structure, development and differentiation, namely, “muscle cell development”, “muscle cell differentiation”, “muscle contraction”, “muscle organ development”, “muscle organ morphogenesis”, “muscle structure development”, “muscle system process” and “muscle tissue development”. The results showed that the 10 most upregulated genes were keratin 19, oxytocin receptor, connective tissue growth factor, nexilin, myosin light chain kinase, cysteine and glycine-rich protein 3, caveolin 1, actin, activating transcription factor 3 and tropomyosin, while the 10 most downregulated consisted of epiregulin, prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2, transforming growth factor, interleukin, collagen, 5-hydroxytryptmine, interleukin 4, phosphodiesterase, wingless-type MMTV integration site family and SRY-box 9. Moreover, ultrastructural observations showing heterogeneity of granulosa cell population are presented in the study. At least two morphologically different subpopulations were identified: large, light coloured and small, darker cells. The expression of genes belonging to the mentioned ontological groups suggest the potential ability of GCs to differentiate and proliferate toward muscle lineage, showing possible application in muscle regeneration and the treatment of different diseases.

Patients with pHPT and negative/discordant first-line imaging addressed for integrated 18F-FCH PET/4D-CT were retrospectively selected. Sensitivity and detection rate (DR%) of 18F-FCH PET/CT, 4D-CT, and PET/4D-CT were calculated according to the per patient and per lesion analyses, and afterwards compared. Histology associated with a decrease more than 50% of perioperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) blood level was used as a gold standard. Persistent high serum PTH and calcium levels during a 6-month follow-up was considered as presence of pHPT in both operated and non-operated patients. 50 patients (55 glands) were included. 44/50 patients (88%) were surgically treated. On a per patient analysis, sensitivity was 93%, 80%, and 95%, and DR% was 82%, 68%, and 84%, respectively for PET/CT, 4D-CT, and PET/4D-CT. PET/CT was more sensitive than 4D-CT (p = 0.046). PET/4D-CT performed better than 4D-CT (p = 0.013) but was equivalent to PET/CT alone. On a per gland analysis, sensitivity PET/CT, 4D-CT, and PET/4D-CT was 88%, 66%, and 92%, and DR% was 79%, 57%, and 83%, respectively. PET/CT and PET/4D-CT were more sensitive than 4D-CT alone (p = 0.01, p < 0.001, respectively). However, PET/CT and PET/4D-CT performed similarly. In conclusion, 18F-FCH PET provides better identification of hyperfunctioning parathyroids than 4D-CT and the combination of both did not significantly improve diagnostic sensitivity. Further investigations involving larger populations are necessary to define the role of 18F-FCH PET/4D-CT as a “one-stop shop” second-line imaging in preoperative work-up of pHPT, especially considering the additional patient radiation exposure due to multi-phase CT.

The ASO field is an emerging area of drug development that targets the disease source at the RNA level and offers a promising alternative to therapies targeting downstream processes. To translate ASO-based therapies into a clinical success, it is crucial to overcome the challenges associated with off-target side effects and insufficient biological activity. In this regard, several chemical modifications and diverse delivery strategies have been explored. In this review, we systematically discuss the chemical modifications, mechanism of action, and optimized delivery strategies of several different classes of ASOs. Further, we highlight the recent advances made in development of ASO-based drugs with a focus on drugs that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for clinical applications. We also discuss various promising ASO-based drug candidates in the clinical trials, and the outstanding opportunity of emerging microRNA as a viable therapeutic target for future ASO-based therapies.

Familial isolated pituitary adenomas (FIPA) are one of the most important inherited settings for pituitary adenomas and the most frequent genetic cause is a germline mutation in the aryl hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein (AIP) gene. AIP mutations lead to young-onset macroadenomas that are difficult to treat. Most are growth hormone secreting tumors, but all other secretory types can exist and the clinical profile of affected patients is variable. We present an overview of the current understanding of AIP mutation-related pituitary disease and illustrate various key clinical factors using examples from one of the largest AIP mutation-positive FIPA families identified to date, in which six mutation-affected members with pituitary disease have been diagnosed. We highlight various clinically significant features of FIPA and AIP mutations, including issues related to patients with acromegaly, prolactinoma, apoplexy and non-functioning pituitary adenomas. The challenges faced by these AIP mutation-positive patients due to their disease and the long-term outcomes in older patients are discussed. Similarly, the pitfalls encountered due to incomplete penetrance of pituitary adenomas in AIP-mutated kindreds are discussed.

This study aimed to investigate whether oxidative stress could alter fibrin clot properties in AS. We studied 173 non-diabetic patients, aged 51–79 years, with isolated AS. We measured plasma protein carbonylation (PC) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), along with plasma clot permeability (Ks), thrombin generation, and fibrinolytic efficiency, which were evaluated by two assays: clot lysis time (CLT) and lysis time (Lys50). Coagulation factors and fibrinolytic proteins were also determined. Plasma PC showed an association with AS severity, reflected by the aortic valve area and the mean and maximum aortic gradients. Plasma PC was positively correlated with CLT, Lys50, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and tissue factor (TF) antigens. TBARS were positively correlated with maximum aortic gradient, Lys50, and TF antigen. Regression analysis showed that PC predicted prolonged CLT (>104 min; odds ratio (OR) 6.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.58–17.83, p < 0.001) and Lys50 (>565 s; OR 5.83, 95% CI 2.23–15.21, p < 0.001). Multivariate regression analysis showed that mean aortic gradient, PC, α2-antiplasmin, PAI-1, and triglycerides were predictors of prolonged CLT, while PC, α2-antiplasmin, and fibrinogen were predictors of Lys50. Our findings suggest that elevated oxidative stress contributes to impaired fibrinolysis in AS and is associated with AS severity.

The initial screening was performed using medical questionnaires and consultations. The second step of the screening consisted of two individual interviews with an independent multidisciplinary committee. Then, a complete medical, biological and imaging assessment of the directed living D, the R, and her partner was performed over a two-day hospitalization. A total of 239 women contacted our department: 165 potentials R and 74 potentials D. During the first step of screening, 141 R and 45 D were excluded. Only 12 R/D pairs were pursued. During inclusion, 10 R/D pairs were excluded. One R/D pair is still under evaluation. Finally, only 1 R/D pair was definitively included (0.6%), which led us to perform the first French UTx in March 2019 with a successful graft. The primary limiting factors of inclusion were due to very strict criteria and difficulty of having a suitable directed living D. The International Society of UTx (ISUTx) guidelines based on worldwide results of trials can help ease our inclusion criteria in the future while remaining safe for patients.

Perfusion computed tomography (CTP) provides crucial information about the cerebral perfusion status in these patients. We hypothesised that CTP abnormalities would be associated with the severity of intracranial hypertension (ICH). To investigate this hypothesis, twenty-eight patients with STBI and ICP monitors were investigated with CTP within 48 h from admission. Treating teams were blind to these results. Patients were divided into five groups based on increasing intervention required to control ICH and were compared. Group I required no intervention above routine sedation, group II required a single first tier intervention, group III required multiple different first-tier interventions, group IV required second-tier medical therapy and group V required second-tier surgical therapy. Analysis of the results showed demographics and injury severity did not differ among groups. In group I no patients showed CTP abnormality, while patients in all other groups had abnormal CTP (p = 0.003). Severe ischaemia observed on CTP was associated with increasing intervention for ICH. This study, although limited by small sample size, suggests that CTP abnormalities are associated with the need to intervene for ICH. Larger scale assessment of our results is warranted to potentially avoid unnecessary invasive procedures in head injury patients.

Methods: A single institutional retrospective study was carried out, which included all patients with endometrial cancer who underwent surgical treatment between January 2007 and December 2016. We analyzed the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of all patients after sentinel node biopsy and full nodal surgical staging according to their final pathological nodal status, focusing on the impact of the size of nodal metastasis. Results: A total of 270 patients were operated on during the study period; among them, 230 (85.2%) patients underwent nodal staging. On final pathology, 196 (85.2%) patients had negative lymph nodes; low-volume metastasis (LVM) was present in 14 (6.1%) patients: 6 (2.6%) patients had isolated tumor cells (ITCs) and 8 (3.5%) patients presented just micrometastasis; additionally, 20 (8.7%) patients presented macrometastasis. After a median (range) follow-up of 60 (0–146) months, patients with macrometastasis showed a significantly worse PFS compared to LVM and node-negative patients (61.1% vs. 71.4% vs. 83.2%, respectively; p = 0.018), and similar results were obtained for 5-year OS (50% vs. 78.6% vs. 81.5%, respectively; p < 0.001). Half of the patients presenting LVM did not receive adjuvant treatment. Moreover, LVM had a moderate nonsignificant decrease in 5-year PFS compared to node-negative patients. Conclusions: Patients with endometrial cancer and low-volume nodal metastasis demonstrated a better prognosis than those presenting macrometastasis. Low-volume metastasis did not show worse oncological outcomes than node-negative patients, although there was a slight decrease in progression-free survival.

The mechanism of platelet destruction could differ depending on the specificity of antiplatelet antibodies: anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibodies lead to phagocytosis by splenic macrophages, in a Fcγ receptor (FcγR)-dependent manner while anti-GPIb/IX antibodies induce platelet desialylation leading to their destruction by hepatocytes after binding to the Ashwell–Morell receptor, in a FcγR-independent manner. Considering the FcγR-dependent mechanism of action of intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg), we assumed that the response to IVIg could be less efficient in the presence of anti-GPIb/IX antibodies. We conducted a multicentric, retrospective study including all adult ITP patients treated with IVIg who had antiplatelet antibodies detected between January 2013 and October 2017. Among the 609 identified, 69 patients were included: 17 had anti-GPIb/IX antibodies and 33 had anti-GPIIb/IIIa antibodies. The response to IVIg was not different between the patients with or without anti-GPIb/IX (88.2% vs. 73.1%). The response to IVIg was better in the case of newly diagnosed ITP (odds ratio (OR) = 5.4 (1.2–24.7)) and in presence of anti-GPIIb/IIIa (OR = 4.82 (1.08–21.5)), while secondary ITP had a poor response (OR = 0.1 (0.02–0.64)). In clinical practice, the determination of antiplatelet antibodies is therefore of little value to predict the response to IVIg.

The evaluation protocol included ECG monitoring, echocardiography and cMRI. LAS and LVSI were cMRI-determined. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) were defined as a composite outcome including heart failure (HF), ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) and sudden cardiac death (SCD). After a median follow-up of 17 months, patients with LGE+ had increased risk of MACEs. Kaplan-Meier curves showed significantly higher rate of MACEs in patients with LGE+ (p < 0.001), increased LVSI (p < 0.01) and decreased LAS (p < 0.001). In Cox analysis, LAS (HR = 1.32, 95%CI (1.54–9.14), p = 0.001), LVSI [HR = 1.17, 95%CI (1.45–7.19), p < 0.01] and LGE+ (HR = 1.77, 95%CI (2.79–12.51), p < 0.0001) were independent predictors for MACEs. In a 4-point risk scoring system based on LV ejection fraction (LVEF) < 30%, LGE+, LAS > −7.8% and LVSI > 0.48%, patients with 3 and 4 points had a significantly higher risk for MACEs. LAS and LVSI are independent predictors of MACEs and provide incremental value beyond LVEF and LGE+ in patients with NIDCM and myocardial fibrosis.

However, there is currently uncertainty regarding the optimal timing for EVD insertion. This study aims to compare patient outcomes for patients with early and late EVD insertion. Following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, MEDLINE/EMBASE/Scopus/Web of Science/Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for published literature involving at least 10 severe TBI (sTBI) patients from their inception date to December 2019. Outcomes assessed were mortality, functional outcome, ICP control, length of stay, therapy intensity level, and complications. Twenty-one studies comprising 4542 sTBI patients with an EVD were included; 19 of the studies included patients with an early EVD, and two studies had late EVD placements. The limited number of studies, small sample sizes, imbalance in baseline characteristics between the groups and poor methodological quality have limited the scope of our analysis. We present the descriptive statistics highlighting the current conflicting data and the overall lack of reliable research into the optimal timing of EVD. There is a clear need for high quality comparisons of early vs. late EVD insertion on patient outcomes in sTBI.

Endothelial dysfunction involved in CVD pathogenesis is a trigger, or consequence, of oxidative stress and inflammation. Endothelial dysfunction is defined as a diminished production/availability of nitric oxide, with or without an imbalance between endothelium-derived contracting, and relaxing factors associated with a pro-inflammatory and prothrombotic status. Endothelial dysfunction-induced phenotypic changes include up-regulated expression of adhesion molecules and increased chemokine secretion, leukocyte adherence, cell permeability, low-density lipoprotein oxidation, platelet activation, and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration. Inflammation-induced oxidative stress results in an increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mainly derived from mitochondria. Excessive ROS production causes oxidation of macromolecules inducing cell apoptosis mediated by cytochrome-c release. Oxidation of mitochondrial cardiolipin loosens cytochrome-c binding, thus, favoring its cytosolic release and activation of the apoptotic cascade. Oxidative stress increases vascular permeability, promotes leukocyte adhesion, and induces alterations in endothelial signal transduction and redox-regulated transcription factors. Identification of new endothelial dysfunction-related oxidative stress markers represents a research goal for better prevention and therapy of CVD. New-generation therapeutic approaches based on carriers, gene therapy, cardiolipin stabilizer, and enzyme inhibitors have proved useful in clinical practice to counteract endothelial dysfunction. Experimental studies are in continuous development to discover new personalized treatments. Gene regulatory mechanisms, implicated in endothelial dysfunction, represent potential new targets for developing drugs able to prevent and counteract CVD-related endothelial dysfunction. Nevertheless, many challenges remain to overcome before these technologies and personalized therapeutic strategies can be used in CVD management.

Factors were retrieved and compared with the periapical status during the follow-up visit. Healing was considered as the absence of clinical and radiological symptoms. Variables significantly associated by the chi-squared test were included in a logistic regression model (LRM). Preoperative factors associated with healing were: American Society of Anesthesiology (ASA) status (p = 0.01); the absence of preoperative pain (p = 0.04); positive response to pulp tests; when the RCT cause was caries, pain, abscess, or sinus tract; probing depth <4 mm; the absence of mobility; absence or <4 mm periapical lesion (p < 0.01). In the LRM, the factors included were: absence or <4 mm periapical lesion; probing depths <4 mm; RCT caused by caries, pain, abscess, or sinus tract; the tooth was not a bridge abutment. Postoperative factors were: teeth with direct restoration; teeth that did not act as a support for a fixed prosthetic restoration; the favorable condition of the coronal restoration (p < 0.01). In the LRM, only the status of the coronal restoration was included. Preoperative conditions and the adequate fit of the coronal restoration influenced the outcome of RCT.

CC-chemokine ligand 18 (CCL18) is predictive of survival in IPF. We described correlation of CCL18 serum levels with the genotype of rs2015086 C > T polymorphism the CCL18-gene, which was associated with survival in a pre-antifibrotic cohort (Part-A). Herein (Part-B), we aimed to validate these findings and to study the effects of antifibrotics. Two cohorts were prospectively recruited, cohort-A (n = 61, pre-antifibrotic) and cohort B (n = 101, received antifibrotics). Baseline CCL18 serum level measurement by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, serially in cohort B) and genotyping of rs2015086 was performed and correlated with clinical outcomes. The CT genotype was present in 15% and 31% of patients. These patients had higher CCL18 levels compared to the TT-genotype (cohort-A: 234 vs. 115.8 ng/mL, p < 0.001; cohort B: 159.5 vs. 120 ng/mL, p = 0.0001). During antifibrotic therapy, CCL18 increased (p = 0.0036) regardless of rs2015086-genotype and antifibrotic-agent. In cohort-A, baseline CCL18-cutoff (>120 ng/mL) and CT-genotype were associated with mortality (p = 0.041 and p = 0.0051). In cohort-B, the CCL18-cutoff (>140 ng/mL) was associated with mortality (p = 0.003) and progression (p = 0.004), but not the CT/CC-genotype. In conclusion, we validated the correlation between rs2015086-genotype and CCL18 serum levels, which was predictive of (progression-free)-survival in two prospective validation cohorts.

Here, we used an automated and unbiased procedure for determining the NWR threshold and compared the reflex thresholds and corresponding pain ratings in a well-characterized cohort of fibromyalgia (n = 29) and matched healthy controls (n = 21). Surface electrical stimuli were delivered to the foot in a stepwise incremental and decremental manner. The surface electromyographic activity was recorded from the ipsilateral tibialis anterior muscle. Fibromyalgia patients reported significantly higher scores for psychological distress and pain-related disability and a significantly lower score for perceived state of health compared to the matched controls. The subjective pain ratings were significantly higher in patients. The NWR thresholds were similar to the controls. In the patients, but not in controls, the NWR thresholds and subjective pain ratings were significantly correlated. Our results showed an increased subjective pain sensitivity in fibromyalgia, but we found no evidence for spinal sensitization based on the reflex measures.

One of the reasons for this, in male patients, is the high prevalence of erectile dysfunction. This is mainly due to the presence of comorbidities, surgery for kidney transplantation, adverse drug effects, psychological changes related to chronic disease, as well as hyperprolactinemia and hypogonadism. Whenever these endocrine dysfunctions occur after kidney transplantation, they must be corrected with appropriate treatment, i.e., testosterone replacement therapy. Administration of the phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor (PDE5i) sildenafil at the recommended posology does not significantly alter the pharmacokinetics of the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporin A or tacrolimus and does not impair kidney allograft function. Tacrolimus increases the peak concentration and prolongs the half-life of PDE5i in kidney transplant patients and, therefore, daily administration cannot be recommended due to the significant drop in blood pressure. Intracavernous injection or topical application of alprostadil can be a second-line option for the treatment of erectile dysfunction after kidney transplantation, which does not alter cyclosporine concentrations and does not deteriorate kidney function. Finally, penile prostheses can be successfully implanted following pelvic organ transplantation after eliminating the risk of infection associated with surgery.

Association between galectin-3 (Gal-3) expression level, and clinical outcome of T1 lung adenocarcinoma has not been clarified. Methods: From January 2009 to December 2014, 74 patients with surgically resected T1 lung adenocarcinoma were enrolled in this retrospective cohort study. Patient outcomes were followed up until December 2019. Gal-3 expression level in primary tumors was assessed immunohistochemically and evaluated based on the staining intensity and percentage. Patient characteristics and correlation between Gal-3 expression level and clinical outcomes were reviewed. Results: Low Gal-3 expression was associated with increased metastatic events (p = 0.03), especially distant metastasis (p = 0.007), and mortality rate (p = 0.04). Kaplan–Meier analysis revealed that high Gal-3 expression level was associated with favorable recurrence-free survival in T1 lung adenocarcinoma (log-rank p = 0.048) and T1a (≤ 2 cm, American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) 7th edition) lung adenocarcinoma (log-rank p = 0.043). Gal-3 expression along with tumor size showed a larger area under curve (AUC) than tumor size alone for predicting metastatic events (AUC = 0.747 vs. 0.681) and recurrence (AUC = 0.813 vs. 0.766) in T1a lung adenocarcinoma in the receiver-operating characteristic curve. Conclusion: Low Gal-3 expression level in primary tumors was remarkably associated with increased metastatic events and reduced recurrence-free survival in T1 lung adenocarcinoma. We suggest that Gal-3 expression level in addition to tumor size may potentially be stronger than tumor size alone in predicting metastasis in T1a lung adenocarcinoma patients.

The study was performed on 99 single-rooted extracted teeth using the ProTaper Gold endodontic rotary system up to the F2 file (Dentsply Maillefer, Baillagues, Switzerland), which were sealed with GuttaCore (Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) and AH plus epoxy resin sealer (Dentsply DeTrey, Konstanz, Germany) and randomly assigned to the following non-surgical retreatment techniques: ProTaper Retreatment endodontic rotary instruments (D1–D3 files, Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland; n = 33, PTR), Reciproc Blue endodontic reciprocating instrument (R50, VDW, Munich, Germany; n = 33, RCB50), and a combined root canal retreatment technique between Gates-Glidden drills (sizes #3 and #2, Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland) and Hedstrom files (file size 35, 30, and 25, Dentsply Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland; n = 33; H-GG). All of the teeth were submitted twice to a micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) scan, before and after non-surgical endodontic retreatment procedures. The volume of root canal filling material (mm3), volume of remaining root canal filling material (mm3), non-surgical endodontic retreatment working time (min), proportion of remaining root canal filling material (%), and efficacy of root canal filling material removal between the non-surgical endodontic retreatment techniques were analyzed using ANOVA one-way statistical analysis. Statistically significant differences were observed between the proportions of remaining root canal filling material of PTR and H-GG (p = 0.018), between the non-surgical endodontic retreatment working times (min; p < 0.001), and between the efficacies of root canal filling material removal by the non-surgical endodontic retreatment techniques (p = 0.009). However, the non-surgical endodontic retreatment systems allow for similar carrier-based root canal filling material removal.
