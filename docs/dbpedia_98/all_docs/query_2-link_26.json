When compared with survived patients, we found that deceased patients were significantly older (81 (74–85) vs 72 (66–80); P < .001), had worse radiological findings, and had a higher number of comorbidities (Charlson comorbidity index 5 (4–6) vs 4 (3–5); P < .001) (Table ). In particular, deceased patients had a higher rate of dementia (17.5% vs 2.2%, P < .001), and a higher rate of renal disease (33.3% vs 7.7%, P < .001).\n\nAmong vital parameters at admission SpO2, respiratory rate and heart rate were significantly worse in deceased patients, whereas the two groups had similar admission values in term of temperature and blood pressure (Table ).\n\nLaboratory values at admission associated to death were higher C‐reactive protein (CRP), blood urea nitrogen, LDH, absolute neutrophil count, and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (Table ).\n\nAll the four scores evaluated showed a fairly good predictive value with respect to in‐hospital death. The ISARIC‐4C score had the highest area under ROC curve (AUROC) 0.799 (0.738–0.851), followed by the COVID‐GRAM 0.785 (0.723–0.838), NEWS 0.764 (0.700–0.819), and qCSI 0.749 (0.685–0.806) (Figure ). However, these differences were not statistically significant.\n\nWhen comparing score sensitivity, COVID‐GRAM and ISARIC‐4C had the best performance, both reaching 88.1% sensitivity for COVID‐GRAM greater than 17.7 and ISARIC‐4C greater than 8 (Table ). However, COVID‐GRAM had a slightly higher negative predictive value (Table ). The qCSI had the best specificity, thus having a qCSI greater than 5 the highest positive predictive value for death (43.3 (35.1–51.9)) (Table ). The worst performer in this group was the NEWS, still keeping a fair negative predictive value of 89.2 (84.2–92.8) at selected cutoff.\n\nTable 2\n\nScoreROC AUCCut off valueSensitivity (%)Specificity (%)+LR−LRPPVNPV NEWS 0.764 (0.700–0.819)>466.7 (50.5–80.4)69.0 (61.5–75.9)2.1 (1.6–2.9)0.5 (0.3–0.7)35.0 (28.3–42.4)89.2 (84.2–92.8) COVID‐GRAM 0.785 (0.723–0.838)>17.788.1 (74.4–96.0)61.3 (53.5–68.7)2.3 (1.8–2.8)0.2 (0.1–0.4)36.3 (31.3–41.5)95.4 (90.0–97.9) ISARIC‐4C 0.799 (0.738–0.851)>888.1 (74.4–96.0)55.9 (48.1–63.6)2.0 (1.6–2.5)0.2 (0.1–0.5)33.3 (29.0–38.0)94.9 (89.1–97.7) qCSI 0.749 (0.685–0.806)>569.0 (52.9–82.4)77.4 (70.3–83.5)3.0 (2.2–4.3)0.4 (0.3–0.6)43.3 (35.1–51.9)90.9 (86.3–94.1)\n\n4. DISCUSSION\n\nThe main result of present study is that among COVID‐19 older patients the specifically developed scores ISARIC‐4C, COVID‐GRAM, and qCSI, although slightly superior in terms of overall AUROC and sensitivity, do not perform significantly better than the standard NEWS. However, the qCSI gave the best results in terms of specificity by evaluating only three parameters.\n\nThe SARS‐CoV‐2 primarily infects the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, 19 binding to human angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 for cell entry. 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 20 Severe hypoxia and respiratory distress are common features of COVID‐19, and septic shock occurs mainly as a result of end‐stage organ failure. 1 , 2 , 5 Radiological findings confirm the extensive lung involvement, and up to 98% of symptomatic patients show bilateral ground glass opacity, and multiple lobular and subsegmental consolidation areas at chest imaging. 20\n\nThe results of the present study are largely explained by both the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and the clinical presentation of COVID‐19. Indeed, since the acute hypoxia is the main determinant of disease progression and severity, the evaluation of respiratory function is crucial for score prediction ability.\n\nAll the evaluated scores include an assessment of respiratory function, even if obtained in different ways. The NEWS includes both the SpO2 and the respiratory rate in the calculation, as well as the ISARC‐4C and the qCSI. For the COVID‐GRAM calculation, the respiratory function is indirectly derivated by the assessment of X‐ray abnormalities, and directly evaluated as the presence of dyspnea, as reported by the patient. The qCSI and the NEWS both evaluate the supplemental oxygen flow given to patients, although this latter measure has a high variability, being not always directly linked to effective patient's respiratory distress.\n\nApart from qCSI that evaluate only respiratory distress, all the scores evaluate neurological status, by using a simplified version of GCS (normal or <15 for ISARIC‐4C), the Alert, Verbal, Pain, Unresponsive (AVPU) scale (for NEWS), and simply conscious/unconscious for COVID‐GRAM. However, although neurologic involvement is common in COVID‐19, a severe depression of consciousness is rare. 21 Indeed, in our cohort only seven (3.3%) patients presented with GCS less than 15 at admission, and three (1.4%) were unconscious. Hence, the contribution of this item to the score prediction was low.\n\nThe relatively low incidence of shock in COVID‐19 1 , 2 could explain why the blood pressure in ED did not seem to be associated to worse outcome (Table ) in our population. Indeed, none of the specifically designed scores for COVID‐19 evaluates blood pressure.\n\nBoth COVID‐GRAM and ISARIC 4C evaluate patients comorbidities. While the latter utilizes the Charlson Index adding obesity, 22 the COVID‐GRAM evaluates a selected number of conditions, including hypertension and hepatitis B. As our study was conducted in a population of COVID‐19 older patients, most of them presenting comorbidities, the influence of this item was reduced for the overall prediction. Nevertheless, our data confirmed that deceased patients showed an overall higher Charlson comorbidity index, but dementia and renal disease were significantly higher. Indeed, COVID‐19 patients with cognitive impairment are at high risk of worse outcome, and this is a major challenge in geriatric populations. 6 , 23 , 24\n\nAmong the scores we assessed, ISARIC‐4C and COVID‐GRAM include laboratory tests in their model. ISARIC‐4C includes blood urea nitrogen and CRP, whereas COVID‐GRAM include lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and direct bilirubin. CRP and LDH were already described to be associated to advanced pulmonary disease in COVID‐19, 25 , 26 as well as kidney damage and increased blood urea nitrogen, 27 as confirmed in our study. Conversely, we cannot confirm the usefulness of bilirubin evaluation since the hepatic involvement in our cohort was limited.\n\nBoth the COVID‐GRAM and the ISARIC‐4C assign an increased risk value for older age. However, in our selected population of patients above 60 years the weight of age was probably reduced because of the limited age range. This may partly explain why the PPV for hospital mortality of both COVID‐GRAM and ISARIC‐4C was lower than in the original reports. 11 , 13 Among the scores we tested, qCSI had the highest PPV for predicting hospital mortality (43.3% for qCSI > 5). The most likely reason is that qCSI is focused on respiratory failure, which is the major cause of death in COVID‐19 patients. Despite the AUROC of qCSI was the lowest among the scores we tested in our study, this score may be preferred for a quick bedside detection of patients at higher risk of adverse events. In fact, qCSI requires only three clinical parameters (respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, and oxygen flow rate). Conversely, despite the higher complexity and the need of laboratory tests, ISARIC‐4C and COVID‐GRAM showed a high NPV (95%) and, as such, they can be used to exclude the risk of subsequent deterioration in patients destined to a non‐critical area.\n\nFinally, only ISARIC‐4C considers the gender in risk prediction. Nonetheless, although male sex was associated to worse outcome in several reports, 3 , 4 , 5 patient gender was not significantly associated to a different outcome in our population (Table ).\n\n4.1. Study Limitations\n\nAs for any retrospective study some limitations are worth considering. First, our sample size is limited and therefore, the global accuracy of our ROC curve estimation could be reduced, still keeping a good reliability in ROC curve comparison. Moreover, we did not collect data about total time of eventual O2 supplementation before ED admission, and this could affect the SpO2 measurement at ED arrival.\n\n4.2. Conclusions\n\nAmong the evaluated scores, the ISARIC‐4C and the COVID‐GRAM, calculated at ED admission, had the best performance in predicting death in COVID‐19 older patients. Moreover, the qCSI, although not specifically designed for death risk prediction had similar efficacy by evaluating only three items, being the best choice for a quick assessment. However, the longtime validated NEWS had a similar performance and, since it represents the standard early warning score in many institutions, could be appropriate also for older patients with COVID‐19."
