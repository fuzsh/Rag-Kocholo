Pages: 672 Language: Italian Volume V.2 Pages: 672 Volume V.2.\n\nARISSIMO Il libro si inserisce nel filone della contesa che per secoli vide Messina e Palermo l'una contro l'altra armate, per rivendicare la supremazia dell'Università, della Zecca, dell'antichità di fondazione e via via fino a contendersi i Santi, o quanto meno il loro luogo d'origine. Soprattutto, poi, la discussione sulla veridicità o meno della Sacra Lettera inviata dalla Madonna ai Messinesi. L'opera dell'abate Filippo Giacomo d'Arrigo (morto nel 1740 a Messina) và vista in questo quadro, ma è molto importante perchè, anche se scritta per rispondere al volume di Francesco Strada: La clemenza reale ecc. palermitano che aveva attaccato Messina per la sua ribellione al Re di Spagna, finisce per essere una bibliografia, aggiornata all'epoca, di tutti coloro che su tale rivalità scrissero. Si vedono così sfilare i nomi di Menniti, D'Ambrosio, Perimezzi, Belli, Samperi, Chiarello. Nell'Addizione ecco l'attacco al Mongitore (che sotto il nome di Filatete Oreteo aveva messo in dubbio, nel suo \"De Patria Sanctae Silviae\" la veridicità della Sacra Lettera), e poi Rocco Pirro, Domenico Lanza. L'antiporta rappresenta la Madonna della Lettera assisa su una nube, con due angoli che Le rendono omaggio, l'altra incisione reca il ritratto di d'Arrigo, questo risulta eccessivamente rifilato.Peer la bibliografia Mira I, 55; Choix, 20709; Narbone I, 210; Moncada legatura allentata, bell'esemplare, rifilato ma non eccessivamente. rigida pergamena coeva tassello al dorso 21,5 x 16,5. Vol. n. 1: 1 c , 1 tav inc., 1 occhiello, 1 c. frontespizio, 1 tav inc., 8 cc nn occh., ant., front., 8 cc.nn., 213 pp.; segue Addizione al Capo IV, 15 pp."
