Sign up for the free DubsDaily newsletter.\n\nATLANTA  Warriors veteran reserve guard Shaun Livingston will miss Fridays game against the Atlanta Hawks for rest purposes.\n\nThe Warriors (48-14) face an Atlanta Hawks team (19-43) that has the second-worst record in the Eastern Conference, giving the NBA defending champions flexibility to target a rest day without compromising their hope to stay atop the Western Conference standings.\n\nThe Warriors trail the Houston Rockets (48-13) by 1/2 a game for the top seed in the Western Conference, while the Rockets hold a regular-season tie-breaker after winning two of their three matchups.\n\nTo subscribe to the Planet Dubs podcast, click here.\n\nLivingstons absence could spur more playing time for reserve guard Quinn Cook, who left the Warriors G-league team from Santa Cruz since second-year guard Patrick McCaw suffered a left wrist injury two weeks ago. The Warriors plan to reevaluate if McCaw can take his cast off when they return home from their three-game trip this weekend. Still, McCaw will be sidelined for at least two more weeks.\n\nLivingston has averaged 5.1 points on 50 percent shooting in 15.4 minutes through 54 games. So far, Livingston has missed a handful of games because of a sore right knee (four), personal (two), rest (one) and suspension stemmed from an ejection (one)."
