        "text": "A person with direct knowledge of the deal says the Milwaukee Bucks and Houston Rockets have agreed to a trade that involves Peoria’s Shaun Livingston.\n\nThe teams agreed to the deal on Wednesday, a day before the NBA draft.\n\nThe move sends Livingston, who was a part-time starter and averaged 5.5 points this season, and two of his Bucks teammates to Houston.\n\nMilwaukee is sending the No. 12 overall pick and three players to the Rockets for the No. 14 pick and center Samuel Dalembert. The Rockets also get guard Livingston and forwards Jon Leuer and Jon Brockman in the deal.\n\nThe person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the deal was not yet official. Several media organizations reported the deal earlier Wednesday.\n\nDalembert has career averages of 8 points, 8.2 rebounds and 1.9 blocked shots per game. Center is a need for the Bucks, who traded away Andrew Bogut last season.\n\nIn 58 games with the Bucks this season, Livingston started 27 times and averaged 18.8 minutes per game."
