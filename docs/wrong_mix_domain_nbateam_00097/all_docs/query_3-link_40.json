        "text": "Warriors have agreed to terms with free agent point guard Shaun Livingston.\n\n“We intend to enter into a player contract once the player contract with Shaun Livingston once the moratorium period ends,” Bob Myers said.\n\nThe three-year, $16 million deal, first reported by Yahoo! Sports, can’t be signed until the NBA’s moratorium ends on July 10.\n\nLivingston fills the Warriors’ hole behind Stephen Curry. Livingston, a nine-year vet, spent last season with Brooklyn. He was high on the Warriors’ list of potential back-up point guards. The Warriors leaned his way because they could lock him up now for the entire mid-level exception.\n\nLivingston, a former No. 4 overall pick (2004) who suffered a devastating knee injury early in his career, is coming off one of his best seasons. He averaged 8.3 points, 3.2 assists and 3.2 rebounds in 26 minutes — all his highest marks since he dislocated his knee cape and tore four ligaments in his left knee in 2007.\n\nHe started a career-high 54 games and often looked better than former All-Star point guard Deron Williams. Because he’s 6-foot-7, he can play both guard positions – allowing him to play next to Curry and spell Klay Thompson. Both the Warriors’ starting guards need a back-up.\n\nLivingston doesn’t shoot the 3 ball, making only 1 of 6 attempts last season. But he shoots 48.3 percent from the field and gets to the free throw line. Livingston’s free throw rate of .392 is way higher than any of the Warriors’ top seven players. He’s also pretty good in the post.\n\nTheir mid-level exception is now gone, which means they can only sign free agents to minimum salaries to fill out the roster. But the Warriors still have the $9.8 million trade exception left. However, only about $6 million of that remains before the Warriors reach the luxury tax. Also, it expires on July 10.\n\nThe Warriors also still have the Kevin Love trade option out there, which could net players and/or free up more space to use. The Warriors currently have three roster spots open.\n\nMy take: I’m not as high on Livingston as others are, and clearly as the Warriors are. Yes, they need a back-up point guard, someone who can run the show. But they also need a playmaker, someone who can take-over, someone who can score when needed. I think they got the former in Livingston. I’m not sure they got the latter.\n\nMaybe they can get the latter in another move. Maybe Kevin Love makes that need less important. But as the roster stands right now, it looks like they filled just one hole.\n\nDon’t get me wrong. Livingston is a good player. He still has some serious talent. Maybe with more freedom and in the right system, he can take his game to another level. But he seems to be much more a solid player than he is a difference-maker. And when you are taking Curry out of the game, you need to turn the game over to someone who can hurt teams. I’m not convinced Livingston can hurt teams like that.\n\nNext to Curry? Sure. In place of Curry, I’ll have to see it.\n\nBut then again, how can you count out a guy who has been through what he’s been through? It’s hard not to root for the guy, to make it back from that injury. He’s been on eight teams in nine years and somehow manages to keep getting better. Who’s to say he can’t be a difference-maker for the Warriors?"
