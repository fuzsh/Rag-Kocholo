        "text": "Another key piece to the Golden State Warriors' recent dynastic run won't be with the team as it embarks on the 2019-20 campaign.\n\nVeteran guard Shaun Livingston is being waived by the Warriors in a move that will help them with the luxury tax, a source with knowledge of the plan confirmed to USA TODAY Sports' Jeff Zillgitt. The person requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly until the move is official. ESPN first reported the news.\n\nJoining the team in 2014, Livingston had helped the Warriors to the Finals each of the past five seasons, with the team winning the championship in 2015, 2017 and 2018.\n\nThe 33-year-old who joined the NBA out of high school in 2004 averaged a modest 5.4 points, 2 rebounds and 2.4 assists in five seasons with the Warriors, but he was a key bench contributor (17.5 minutes per game) for one of the best five-year runs we've seen by any team. However, Livingston's numbers dipped across the board in 2018-19 (4-1.8-1.8) and he appeared in fewer games than he had in any non-lockout season since 2009-10.\n\nMore: NBA approves coach's challenge; Adam Silver discusses improving free agency process\n\nMore: D'Angelo Russell unfazed by 'business side' of likely one-year Warriors stint\n\nLivingston's exit was preceded by Kevin Durant leaving for the Brooklyn Nets in free agency and the trade of Andre Iguodala, another veteran who was on all three title teams. Additionally, All-Star Klay Thompson is expected to miss a good portion of next season after tearing his ACL in the NBA Finals.\n\nNext season will be undeniably different for the Warriors, who did manage to add some talent this offseason in the form of All-Star guard D'Angelo Russell. Tuesday's news was more confirmation of that.\n\nContributing: Jeff Zillgitt"
