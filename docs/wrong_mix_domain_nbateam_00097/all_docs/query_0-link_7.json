        "text": "In the days following the trade to acquire James Harden, the Houston Rockets have waived five players to bring the roster to the requisite 15 players. The last cut was made Monday, as the Rockets said goodbye to Shaun Livingston.\n\nLivingston, a 6'7 guard, is set for his ninth NBA season, but will now need to find his sixth team in the last five years. Last season, he averaged 5.5 points, 2.1 rebounds and 2.1 assists in 58 games with the Milwaukee Bucks.\n\nOn Sunday, the Rockets released Jon Brockman, Lazar Hayward, Gary Forbes, and JaJuan Johnson. The 6'7 Brockman is the most experienced of the group with three seasons under his belt. Hayward was included in the trade to acquire James Harden, and Johnson was a rookie last year with the Boston Celtics.\n\nWith the cuts, the Rockets roster is complete as they prepare to open regular season play against the Detroit Pistons on Wed., Oct. 31.\n\nGuards\n\nJeremy Lin\n\nToney Douglas\n\nScott Machado\n\nJames Harden\n\nDaequan Cook\n\nCarlos Delfino\n\nForwards\n\nChandler Parsons\n\nPatrick Patterson\n\nMarcus Morris\n\nDonatas Motiejunas\n\nTerrence Jones\n\nRoyce White"
