        "text": "How often do you get asked about the knee injury you suffered almost six years ago? Shaun Livingston: It’s still the elephant in the room. Everybody still asks me about it. I came a long way. Q: Does it bother you any more? Shaun Livingston: It swells from time to time. I’ve still got to do maintenance. I’ll have to do that for the rest of my life. But to play the game of basketball, it’s worth it. Q: Is it true that you have never watched a replay of the injury? Shaun Livingston: Never watched it.\n\nSource: Shaun Livingston thought he was headed for the Philadelphia 76ers once he cleared waivers, a plan up-ended when the Cavaliers claimed him. The takeaway: the 76ers are looking for back-up PG help and apparently are pursuing that need ahead of their obvious shortcomings in size on the frontline.\n\nShortly after losing to the Detroit Pistons, 96-89, on Saturday at Verizon Center – their seventh straight defeat to drop to a franchise-worst 3-22 – the Wizards released Barron and Livingston to open up two roster spots that the team plans to fill with backcourt help, according to league sources.\n\nLiving up to the Linsanity hype and recovering from knee surgery got to Lin early in Rockets training camp, sources close to the team said. The late addition of James Harden didn’t ease things either. Sources said reserve guard Shaun Livingston often outplayed Lin in October. Sensing Livingston might get waived at the end of camp due to financial concerns, several Rockets players and coaches pleaded with management to keep him. A point guard controversy could’ve arrived if Livingston stuck around, but he was waived Oct. 29.\n\nFor Shaun Livingston, it was like coming home. The 6-foot-7 free-agent point guard was signed by the Wizards on Thursday, and was on the practice court on Friday to start his second stint with the team. The Wizards released Jannero Pargo to make room on the roster. “It feels good,” Livingston said after practice on Friday. “It’s an opportunity to play. I haven’t played yet this year. I’m just anxious to get out there, very anxious. I’ve just got to get my legs back, get my wind up and I’ll be alright.”\n\nWashington Wizards President Ernie Grunfeld announced today that the team has signed free agent guard Shaun Livingston. Per team policy, terms of the deal were not released. “We are obviously familiar with what Shaun brings both on and off the court based on his previous time here and we’re confident that he will be a positive addition to our team,” said Grunfeld. “His size and playmaking ability will give us more flexibility in the backcourt.”"
