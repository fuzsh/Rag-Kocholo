        "text": "Published July 2, 2014 8:45am\n\nThe Golden State Warriors addressed their need for a back-up point guard by agreeing to terms with former Brooklyn Net Shaun Livingston, according to Yahoo Sports’ Adrian Wojnarowski.\n\nThe deal, which cannot be officially signed until July 10, is said to be worth $16 million for three years, with the final year only partially guaranteed.\n\nLast season, the Warriors used a combination of Jordan Crawford and Steve Blake to spell All-Star gunner Stephen Curry.\n\nLivingston logged solid minutes for the Nets last season, starting 54 out of 76 regular season games, while norming 8.3 points, 3.2 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 1.2 steals. He got quite a bit of burn in the Playoffs too, with his numbers receiving a slight uptick to 9.7 points, 3.5 rebounds and 3.3 assists.\n\nThe 6’7” floor general was also solid on defense, giving the Warriors flexibility to play him alongside Curry. - AMD, GMA News"
