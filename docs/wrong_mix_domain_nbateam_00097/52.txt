The Peoria native won his fourth career world championship on Thursday night as the Golden State Warriors defeated the Boston Celtics to win the NBA Finals.

Livingston, 36, won three rings as a player with Golden State in 2015, 2017 and 2018. He now is the team's director of player affairs and engagement and was on the court Thursday in Boston as the Warriors celebrated.

Livingston graduated from Peoria High School in 2004 and went right to the NBA as the fourth overall pick of the Los Angeles Clippers. He played 833 NBA games over parts of 14 seasons, overcame a brutal knee injury, and was part of three Warriors championships before retiring after the 2019 season.

Livingston is just the second player in NBA history to complete a tenure of at least five seasons with a team that made at least an NBA Finals appearance in each season, according to the Warriors. The other is Tom Heinsohn, who made the NBA Finals in all nine of his seasons with the Boston Celtics from 1956-57 to 1964-65.
