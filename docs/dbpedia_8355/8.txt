BroadwayWorld.com is pleased to present illustrator Ken Fallin, who brings you original illustrations of everyone's favorite theatrical stars each week. This week's feature: Robin Weigert, Billy Porter, Frank Wood, Robin Bartlett, Zachary Quinto, Christian Borle, Zoe Kazan, and Bill Heck in ANGELS IN AMERICA!

Ken Fallin's career has spanned work in advertising, theatre, network television and, most notably, in print for publications such as In Style magazine, the Wall Street Journal, The New Yorker, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, The Chicago Tribune, The Boston Globe, and The Philadelphia Inquirer. His work has illustrated major ad campaigns for American Express, SHOWTIME, Belvedere Vodka, and CNBC. Most recently, Fallin was nominated for a 2010 Emmy for his commercial illustration work for CNBC.

He considers legendary caricaturist Al Hirschfeld as a major influence, and mimicked his style early in his career for the Forbidden Broadway drawings. Other influences include the German "degenerate" portrait artists of the 1920s, Aubrey Beardsley, Frank Gehry, Eero Saarinen, Richard Avedon, Irving Penn, and Dame Edna Everage.
