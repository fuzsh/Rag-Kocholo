Once the project is completely finished by the end of the year, Norman will have one of central Oklahomaâs most picturesque urban thoroughfares, with bike lanes, bus turnouts, and trees lining both side of the street as well as the center median.\n\nOâLeary said West Lindsey had become a notoriously dangerous street with a crash rate that was three times the national average. Transportation officials also considered Lindsay the most congested traffic corridor in the Oklahoma City area.\n\nOâLeary said the Lindsey Street widening project and the adjacent Interstate 35 bridge and interchange system had a price tag of about $107 million, largely paid for through federal transportation funds. The result will be a modern new entryway for visitors and Norman residents to use and enjoy.\n\nWhile Lindsey Street was the most visible and drew the most discussion, the main purpose of all the work on Lindsey was to improve drainage in the area. He said the project included construction of enormous channels buried as much as 30 feet below the street. That project is also drawing to conclusion and will soon alleviate the notorious flooding problem on McGee Street.\n\nLindsey Street Update 2017-08-18 05:00:00Z 0\n\nRotary Road Rally\n\nKick Off Fall Cycling Season\n\nCap off a great summer season with what is destined to be a fall classic touring event in Norman, showcasing some of the best cycling roads in Central Oklahoma.\n\nRotary Road Rally 2017-08-15 05:00:00Z 0\n\nLegacy, CrossTimbers\n\nLegacy, Cross Timbers Clubs Say Hello\n\nNorman Rotary Club Member Charles Hollingsworth visits with speakers Andrew Seamans and Connie Eckstein.

They are promoting the new Rotary Success Cycle program, which uses bicycles to help boost attendance during the 2016-17 school year.\n\nThe photo was taken during Jefferson Elementary School's Back to School Night, Aug. 16.\n\n- By Chip Minty, Norman Rotary Club\n\nThe first step to being successful in school is showing up.\n\nEncouraging good attendance is a priority at Norman Public Schools because poor attendance leads to poor test scores and higher dropout rates.\n\nThat is why Norman Public Schools and Normanâs Noon Rotary Club have partnered to initiate The Rotary Success Cycle, a program that rewards students just for coming to school each day.\n\nThe program, which involves nine Norman schools, entices students to be consistent in their attendance to improve their chances to win bicycles through the school year. The better their attendance, the better their chances of winning a bike.\n\nStudents who attend five days out of a week have their names added to their schoolâs drawing. The more weeks with perfect attendance, the more times their names are added to the hat. The schools will hold drawings after each nine-week period during the 2016-17 school year.\n\nNormanâs Noon Rotary Club is sponsoring the program through nearly $10,000 in funding for the purchase of 66 bicycles. Each of the winning students will also receive a bicycle helmet and a bike lock.\n\nParticipating schools include Kennedy, Wilson, Madison, Jackson, Adams, Lincoln, Jefferson, Reagan and Dimensions Academy South. The program involves more than 3,000 students in grades K through five.\n\nNoon Rotary President-elect Craig Heaton said the club is investing in the program to help children establish a stronger academic footing while in elementary school. But that is not the only reason. The program also is intended to help the schools achieve attendance rates required for state and federal funding. Schools must achieve 95 percent attendance to be eligible for funding, and schools selected to participate in The Rotary Success Cycle program tend to be on the borderline of that requirement.\n\nâWe borrowed The Rotary Success Cycle idea from a similar program created by a Rotary club in Texas,â Heaton said. The club met with district officials, who helped design the rules specifically for Norman schools and students.\n\nâItâs an exciting initiative and another great opportunity for us to contribute to the community,â Heaton said. âThrough this first-year program, we hope to improve attendance, raise test scores and make a difference for schools that could use a shot in the arm at a challenging time.â\n\nâBesides all of that,â Heaton said, âWe are going to give a bunch of bikes to kids who will really enjoy them, and thatâs important too.â\n\nThe bikes are being displayed at each of the schools through the school year. Signs accompanying the displays were created and donated by FastSigns of Norman.\n\nAlâs Bicycles of Norman assisted the Rotary Club by providing the 67 Haro brand BMX style bicycles at a discounted price. The Norman Police Department contributed about a third of the bicycle helmets that will be given away during the school year.\n\nThe Rotary Success Cycle to Make a Difference for Norman Schools 2016-08-29 00:00:00Z 0\n\nAugust 25â State Auditor Gary Jones\n\nAugust 25â State Auditor Gary Jones, âA billion here, a billion there . . . before long, youâre talking about real money!â: Gary Jones was born at Fort Sill 8/27/1954, the fifth of seven children to SFC James J. & Clara Jones. He started school at Jefferson Elementary in Lawton, but like most military families moved and also attended school in Texas and Germany before returning to Lawton to attend Eisenhower Jr. High. Jones graduated from Eisenhower Sr. in 1972. That fall, Gary entered Cameron University full time while also working full time for Southwestern Bell. At age 20, Gary was promoted into management for Southwestern Bell as one of the youngest managers in company history. The following year he was promoted again to Southwestern Bell state headquarters in OKC and attended night school at Central State University. Gary returned to Lawton in June, 1977 to marry his wife, Mary Jane. Gary attended night classes at Cameron and graduated in July 1978 with a Bachelor of Business Administration with a concentration in Accounting. Jones worked for Bell for 10 years before starting a telecommunications company he owned and operated for 16 years. He was elected as Comanche County Western District Commissioner in August 1994 and served 4 years. In January 1999, Gary returned to Cameron to finish the requirements needed to sit for the CPA exam. In May 2000, he fulfilled his original collegiate goal and became a Certified Public Accountant. In November 2010, on his third attempt, Gary was elected Oklahoma State Auditor and Inspector.

The Theatre is using the money to benefit its studio project, which teaches young people a variety of skills in the performing arts, such as acting, singing and stage design. Rotarians plan to raise an additional $50,000 for The Theatre again through the 2017 event.\n\nLe Tour de Vin 2016 consisted of three separate functions over the course of a weekend in early June. It began with a small painting and wine affair on Thursday evening, followed by a Wine and Dine on Friday and ended with the big event on Saturday night at the Marriott Conference Center. The big event offers patrons opportunities to enjoy fine wine, good food, music and a festive atmosphere.\n\nSince it was established in 2003, the annual wine tasting fundraiser has generated nearly $605,000 in direct benefit to organizations that serve Norman, such as Food and Shelter for Friends, Bridges high school living center, the Center for Children and Families, Mary Abbot House, Thunderbird Clubhouse, American Red Cross, and The Studio of The Sooner Theatre.\n\nStarting out as a joint project between Normanâs Cross Timbers Rotary Club and the Cleveland County Chapter of the American Red Cross, the event has grown in size and stature. Le Tour de Vin has grown to be the second-largest event of its kind in Oklahoma.\n\nIn 2008, Le Tour de Vin picked up steam when the Cross Timbers Club joined forces with Normanâs Noon Rotary Club and the Sooner Rotary Club. Members from each club volunteer their time, donate auction items, and most importantly, attend with their friends, colleagues and other members of the community, making each year a big success.\n\nNormanâs three Rotary clubs use the remaining proceeds from Le Tour de Vin to benefit other nonprofit organizations in Norman, helping to provide housing for our Cityâs homeless and many Rotary International Projects, as part of their continuing effort to fulfill a broad range of community needs. Since its beginning, Le Tour de Vin has raised a net income of $1,101,799.
