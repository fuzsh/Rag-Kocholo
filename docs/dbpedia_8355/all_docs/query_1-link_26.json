Due to the rural character of the state of Kansas, rural tourism can be regarded as a strategic tool for local communities. Although Kansas State University (KSU) contributes greatly to the development of rural communities, to date, no state-wide rural tourism initiatives have been pursued. Thus, upon consulting with a variety of faculty, industry, and community groups, it has been agreed that the best starting point in initiating a state-wide program for rural tourism development is to create a Center for Rural Tourism Development at KSU. The Center's primary mission is to assist local communities achieve sustainable economic development through rural tourism through teaching/training, research, and engagement.\n\nHeather McCrea, History, \"Diseased Relations: Public Health, & State-Building in Mexico.\" While at UT-Austin I will utilize the extensive collections at the Benson Latin American Library.
