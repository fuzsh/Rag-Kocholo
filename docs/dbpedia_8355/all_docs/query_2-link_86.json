        "text": "“Phones down, everybody. PHONES. DOWN.”\n\n“Look at this board!” Vincent (not his real name) spat, pointing to the white board where we—the telesales callers—would mark our victories each night. By this late hour it should have been covered with “H”s—each vertical line representing a package sold with the connecting dash making a pair. Sometimes there’d be single lines. Sometimes you’d strike gold and get four, two couples from Westchester or the 908 part of Jersey. But tonight, nobody had anything. And Vincent was furious.\n\n“You have hot leads tonight! These are renewal leads! I give you Danny Glover in ‘Master Harold’ . . . And the Boys, and you are pissing it away!”\n\nThe speech about to come (“You’re telling, not selling!”) would have been the same if we were hawking Jordan Belfort’s penny stocks. But we weren't. We were the cold callers in the subscriptions department of the Roundabout Theatre Company—and he was the Wolf of Broadway.\n\nVincent was simultaneously the worst and best boss I ever had. A former pianist, actor and, as he reminded us regularly, assistant to Leonard Bernstein, he was nearing retirement age and worked for Roundabout because he loved what the company was doing—reviving respected plays and musicals with big, boldfaced names for limited runs and supporting smaller work by emerging writers. I took the gig when there was really no work in New York and figured it was tangentially related to the arts, though our call center was in a stained-carpet dump nowhere near a stage.\n\nHe was the worst boss because, on a dime, he could transform into a very mean person. He ruled by fear and shamed the underachievers among us. He sat in his small, windowless office adjacent to the call room, waiting (or so it seemed to us) for an excuse to bark at people as the original cast recording of Company played its eternal loop on a cheap boombox. He would even lock the front door a moment or two before the shift began, forcing anyone who got stuck on a train to ring the bell and suffer verbal humiliation for all to see. Any excuse was interrupted with “There is no excuse! I won't listen to your excuse!”\n\nBut he was the best boss because, holy hell, he got results. For the two years I worked there (early 2002 through early 2004), his iron fist of brute management kept the Roundabout’s three stages packed at a time when arts organizations all over New York City collapsed in the post-9/11 ripple effect. He drilled it into us that every single cold call was already a sale, unless you said something to screw it up. Call for Mr. Abrams and the voice on the other end says he died? Don't miss a beat; sell to the widow.\n\nNight after night we interrupted the dinners of well-to-do people in Manhattan, certain parts of Brooklyn, the Forest Hills section of Queens, Long Island, New Jersey, southern Connecticut and the glorious 914 area code of Westchester. We had their numbers because they’d seen a Roundabout production before.\n\n“Mrs. Birnbaum, you saw Cynthia Nixon in The Women didn’t you?”\n\n“Yes, I did.”\n\n“And you loved it!”\n\n“Yes, I did.”\n\n“Well, we want you back!”\n\nI said those exact lines, swapping the name, at least 400,000 times. And, I must confess, I did it pretty well. Indeed, I was consistently ranked third or fourth in the room—a room mostly of out-of-work actors, writers, filmmakers (that was what I was doing at the time), or musicians. I only worked from five to nine P.M. each night and was making more dough than I would at Starbucks or somewhere. I wasn't getting rich, but I had my days free to do my own thing. (My own thing was attending Film Forum and MoMA screenings and plowing through cinema history on Netflix. Were it not for the free time in these underemployed post-9/11 years, I would likely not be a working film critic today.)\n\nI called Upper East Side blue-blood society dames, and I called bewildered businessmen who took their wives to see Cabaret years ago and didn’t want to see it again. (Seriously, a lot of these dudes couldn’t understand that we were offering packages of new plays.)\n\nMy speciality were Jersey/Nassau County hausfraus who wanted in with Manhattan culture but needed a little guidance. I got my hooks in with them easy, regaling them with stories about the company’s workshopping process and dedication to the dwindling art of legitimate theater. I’d get them worked up into a lather, and then they’d hand the phone to their unimpressed husbands, at which point I’d immediately switch gears.\n\n“Listen, what’s four nights out of the year? Keep her happy.”\n\nSometimes the husbands would just flat-out refuse. My trump card was to play to the wives’ independence. “Go with your girlfriends. Let him him order in, you take the train. Sisters are doin’ it for themselves!”\n\n“I’m afraid to go into the city,” one woman confessed. “You know, with all these Arabs.” While her phrasing was a little coarse, terrorism fears were something the Wolf had an answer for.\n\n“Build them up,” he advised us. “Let them know that this is the way they can fight back.” Basically, it was my job to convince these frightened suburbanites that seeing Jackée in a revival of The Boys from Syracuse was doing their part in the global war on terror.\n\nI called Spike Lee at home. He answered and respectfully declined. Same with Alec Baldwin, funny in that he’d later be in a show I was hawking. I got Budd Schulberg out of a pool. I called Woody Allen’s sister on her cell phone while she was at dinner, and she shooed me away. Michael Moore said he’d think about it, but I never got ahold of him again. Al Franken was polite but quick, and didn't have much of a reaction when I told him the movie Coneheads was underrated.\n\nSarah Vowell was a delight. She told me that, on principle, she never bought anything over the phone, but let me do my whole spiel, complimented my approach, and then we yapped for a really long time, connecting on a number of subjects. I half-expected to end up as a story on This American Life as the telemarketer who changed her whole opinion of talking to strangers on the phone.\n\nThe funniest phone encounter I had with a celeb was with Dina Meyer, who was best known to me as Dizzy Flores from Starship Troopers. When I said I was calling from Roundabout, she got very excited and joked, “I’ve been waiting for this call!” I thought, Hey, this is an easy sale, but it turned out she was up for a part in a Roundabout show. It was embarrassing, but I still went ahead with my pitch. Always keep them on the phone.\n\nThe most exciting name I got belonged to a woman I heard about my whole life: Bess Myerson. She was the first Jewish Miss America and, as such, someone my grandmother had many opinions about. In the 1980s, she was involved in a political scandal with Mayor Koch—the “Bess Mess” as it was called—and growing up in the New York area meant hearing about this every time you turned on the news. Alas, Ms. Myerson never picked up the phone no matter how many times I called.\n\nThe top seller in the room—the Golden Boy—was Arnold. He was from South Africa, a stage actor who had a perfect English accent. Over the phone it was as if Laurence Olivier himself was inviting you to come see Tartuffe at the American Airlines Theatre. Arnold was by no means an unattractive man, but the sway he had over those who couldn’t see him was extraordinary. Sometimes when I’d get rebuffed by someone who seemed like a sure sale I’d be told, “Sorry, I only do business with Arnold.”\n\nAnother top earner was Ted. He was an extremely tall comic/actor/rapper/musician with a white-boy fro and a perpetual look of confusion on his face. He came off as extremely confident—a necessity in sales—but strangely unaware about certain facts of life. One time he told me he was feeling sick, then confessed that he’d been eating apples, nothing but apples, for over a week. His affable-space-cadet shtick got him great numbers, almost shocking people into placing orders. He would refer to the company’s Web site as “Roundabout Theatre dot orgasm” and, I dunno, somehow he made that joke work.\n\nWeirder than Ted was Robert. A little older than the rest of us, Robert was from Chicago, wore a wig that made him look like Ron Wood, and a cap on top of it that looked like he was a cab driver from 1942. He said he was an artist/poet and would sometimes go away to “a farm in Indiana” to work and “attend orgies,” he joked (I think.) His secret weapon was having absolutely no clue about theater or popular culture. When we announced Antonio Banderas in the revival of Nine, he had never heard of him. He wasn’t pulling my leg—you can’t fake that kind of dumbstruck stare. One time I asked him if he liked Broadway theater at all, and he barked, “No! I absolutely defecate on it! I defecate all over it!”\n\nBut he’d memorize the talking points, get on the phone, mutter in a deep voice, and somehow, through sheer insane will, convince people to hand over their Amexes. I once heard him segue from “Ludwig van Beethoven and Frank Zappa are absorbed in the same ethereal light” to “Alec Baldwin and Anne Heche in Twentieth Century will be a show for the ages.”\n\nI did O.K. by assuming everyone I spoke to was my mother. “Listen,” I'd say, “an all-deaf cast doing a musical version of Huck Finn may sound a little nuts, but what's the point of getting up in the morning if you don't try something different, right? You want Sunday matinees?”\n\nWe top four were immune to the Wolf’s wrath, but woe to the revolving door of doe-eyed theater kids who didn't know how to close a deal. If he had you in his sights, the mere act of hanging up the phone meant failure. The phrase “I’m not interested” was, according to him, no reason to give up. His method entailed staying on the phone to the point of harassment, and twisting and turning like a dog with clenched teeth, until finally, they said yes to Patrick Stewart in The Caretaker.\n\nBy luck of the draw, my cubicle was right near Vincent’s office. Sometimes he’d wave me in to jaw about movies, musicals, and show tunes. He liked me. Did I like him? Well, I was terrified of him, and I didn't like when he shouted at people. But working in sales changes everything about how you interact with your fellow man. I exploited his affection for me; reverse brown-nosed, if you will. I became a chum, and at least three times a week we’d have a little schmooze. This ensured he’d never shout at me, and he’d often pull me aside after one of his eruptions to say, “I didn't mean you.”\n\nTo spend too much time away from the phones becoming Vincent’s ally, however, would be self-defeating. In order to make a living out of a 20-hour-a-week phone-bank job, you needed to sell more than a certain number of theater packages a week. Then your commission would go from 5 percent to 7.5 percent, a pretty big jump.\n\nInevitably, I’d leave on Thursday night just a tiny bit shy of the threshold, making me a complete nervous wreck. I'd have dreams of calling Mrs. Sandler up in Larchmont . . . she said she needed to get her sister-in-law to decide if she wanted Saturday nights or during the week. Or Mrs. Rosen who said she would do Wednesday matinees by herself, but didn't have her Visa on her and asked me to call back tomorrow after she put the kids to bed.\n\nFor a job I got that was supposed to be a side thing, it was turning me into a jerk. I’d see relatives or friends of the family and end up trying to sell them a package. Not because I thought they'd like the shows, but because I was a few sales away from hitting 7.5 percent that week.\n\nOn weeks that I failed to pass the threshold, I'd blame it on certain people who, I felt, led me on but eventually said no. I knew it was time to leave the gig when, in the subway station, I picked up a payphone, dialed a number from memory, and prank-called the klutz who promised me a full-season renewal then backed out. (I didn't say anything threatening—I just needed to hear his voice one more time as I seethed.)\n\nI eventually found another gig—this one having even less to do with film or writing—but just before I left there was an incident that soured things between the Wolf and me. I went out to Los Angeles to compete in IFC’s Ultimate Film Fanatic game show. I actually won the first round, and was awarded $5,000 and a cheap trophy. On the show, as something of a punchline, I name-dropped my then nascent blog.\n\nVincent, who joked about how little he understood computers, got on his dial-up Dell and saw that an idiot friend of mine made a comment about my job with the “gay Glengarry Glen Ross.”\n\nHow hostile you consider this joke is up to you, but Vincent was very sensitive about such things and flipped out on me. I tried explaining that it wasn’t me who made the remark, but the damage was done.\n\nIt's been a while since I've thought about the Wolf of Broadway, but The Wolf of Wall Street brought it all back. When Leonardo DiCaprio’s character is making that first sale in front of his staff, flipping off the phone and making lewd gestures, the memories flooded back. I confess I made the same vulgar moves, especially when assuring would-be clients that the very dark and depressing A Day in the Death of Joe Egg with Eddie Izzard was a laugh riot.\n\nBut the Wolf taught me a few key things. He taught me to always be on time. He taught me never to take no for an answer. He taught me that it’s a lot easier to talk people into things than we may feel comfortable knowing. And he taught me that you could still be terrifying even if Rodgers and Hammerstein were wafting out of your office."
