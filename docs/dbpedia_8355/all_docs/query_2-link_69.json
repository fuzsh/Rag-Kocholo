On Tuesday afternoon, after a belly full of a delicious holiday buffet at Show Palace Dinner Theatre, we settled in for Santa's tale of a human infant baby that grew up in the North Pole only to discover in his 30s, he wasn't an elf after all. Buddy had a human father, a sort of Scrooge-like Walter Hobbs, a family-ignoring, work-obsessed children's book publisher residing in the Big Apple, who just happened to be on the naughty list.\n\nCarole's Kings Are Back by Popular Demand at Downstairs Cabaret Theatre!\n\nDownstairs Cabaret Theatre is pleased to announce a 2-Week-Only Limited Return Engagement of: CAROLE'S KINGS August 17 -August 26, 2018. Carole's Kings combines the incredible music of Carole King, the hilarious writings of Chicago's Second City, and orchestrations from the same team that brought you Jersey Boys and Beautiful to create a one-of-a kind tribute.\n\nCAROLE'S KINGS Kicks Off FST's 2018 Summer Cabaret Season\n\nStudio Theatre (FST) kicks off its 5th Summer Sidekicks Cabaret Series with the high energy music revue Carole's Kings. Honoring one of the most cherished and revered singer-songwriters of the 20th century, this cabaret transports audiences back in time to when Carole King was queen of the airwaves. Carole's Kings opens in FST's John C. Court Cabaret on June 14, and is part of a 3-show Summer Cabaret subscription package, which can be purchased for as little as $49.\n\nBWW Review: Superb KING LEAR at Avant Bard is Fitting Swan Song for DC Acting Legend Rick Foucheux\n\nTom Prewitt, Avant Bard's current artistic director, knew who he wanted to take on this monumental role: Rick Foucheux. A 35-year veteran of stages large and small in the Washington, DC area, Foucheux has played everything from realism to the avant garde; modern and the classics. Capping off his storied career as he is about to leave the limelight to spend time as a grandfather and to travel, Foucheux taking on Lear is a match made in heaven. Effortlessly commanding the stage, Shakespeare's words and the arc of the tragedy seem newly minted in Foucheux's skillful hands.\n\nCELEBRATION THEATRE presents THE FABULOUS DARSHAN\n\nCELEBRATION THEATRE presents as part of its New Works Reading Series, THE FABULOUS DARSHAN, written by Bob Stewart and directed by Jeffrey Polk.

SMITH on John Barrymore & 'THE CURIOUS INCIDENT'\n\nYet more theatre lore from the crazy world of Mrs. Smith!
