        "text": "I’m not gonna comment on the George Michael song. It’s been too long since I’ve heard the original. It sounded choppy to me but that could just be my bad recall. However, this one works pretty well for you. The only thing I notice and I don’t feel it has any negative effect on your adaptation of the song is may you could hold the lines free and falling out a little longer\n\nNice work\n\n0 ·\n\n@Michael4000 it sounds good. Maybe try putting a little more umph into it on the Free Falling Chorus. Belt it more or something. Piano is great loved the improvisations.\n\n0 ·\n\nVery good! Your voice sound very enjoyable, and you play so well. You could try be more gentle with the piano in the beginning, and really start to hammer the notes later when you lean into the sound. You do it nicely with your voice.\n\nMuch less clipping of sound in this than the earlier recordings\n\n0 ·\n\n@Michael4000 Ok I absolutely love this song and also sing it frequently. I thought you did a great job on it! Love the timbre of your voice and you had great pitch! No complaints here!\n\n0 ·\n\nI really liked this one, it suits your voice nicely. You may have a slight tendency to over-enunciate your words, but that is pretty minor on this one.\n\nId go as far as to say that I really think that there were a few really excellent moments smattered through this one 👍🏻\n\nGreat job man :-)\n\n0 ·\n\nI have always loved this song; I think it represents Tom Petty at his best! You did a good job with capturing the feeling of the song -- nice vocal tone and solid piano playing.\n\n1 ·"
