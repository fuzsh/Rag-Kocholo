        "text": "Kobani International Film Festival Entering film festivals is an essential step for any aspiring filmmaker, and I‚Äôve seen firsthand the transformative impact it can have. As a judge at The Kobani International Film Festival, I strive to be fair and provide guidance to new filmmakers, helping them refine their craft. Film festivals provide a platform where emerging talents can showcase their work to a wider audience, gain critical feedback, and measure their progress against other filmmakers. This exposure not only builds confidence but also fosters a sense of community among creators, encouraging them to push their boundaries and evolve in their storytelling abilities. For new filmmakers, film festivals are more than just a stage for recognition; they are learning experiences that can shape their future careers. I love seeing fresh voices enter the festival circuit because it‚Äôs an opportunity for them to receive constructive criticism, network with industry professionals, and gain valuable insights that are often not available in a classroom setting. Engaging with a diverse audience and receiving feedback from experienced judges allows filmmakers to understand different perspectives and refine their work, making them better prepared for the competitive world of filmmaking. Jano Rosebiani https://lnkd.in/e7PWbsUy #filmfestivals #newfilmmakers #tipsfornewfilmmakers\n\n#LA1Shorts Film Festival - selection process, thoughts and tips! As we get close to selection notification for this years entries, we wanted to share some of the factors at play when selecting for our film festival. It isn't as straightforward as you think. We have a group of industry professionals who view the films with us. These judges help with first pass selection, and then we might ask them to watch a smaller selection once we have narrowed things down... Finally, we vote for the LA1 Best Film in the National category. As always, the Lancashire category is up to the audience on the night... The audience vote is tough! Sometimes the count is extremely close, and the types of films in competition can vary greatly, like opinions between judges and audience. This makes it exciting for our audience, but sometimes unfortunate for some really talented filmmakers. We don't always screen everything we'd like to... Perhaps there are similar films or themes, a subject matter that just doesn't really fit with our festival, which is why we encourage local filmmakers to attend our event to understand how we work, and feel our vibe through whats on screen. Don't rush! Rushing to hit a deadline is challenging. On occasions, we've seen a great idea let down by rushed execution. If you're cutting it fine (haha!), drop us an email, send us the rough cut to start with. We might offer some tips and advice for your edit if that helps? Time is interesting... For starters, we have a total screening time for our festival. So we may not be able to fit in loads of 15min films. We need variety so we can sneak in a really well-made 2, 3, 5min film. Tell the story with what is needed, not with all of your footage! Equally, make sure your film speaks with the right tone for a festival. Not every film fits every festival, and not every festival is right for your film, and that's ok. Basics - Story is key, make sure it hangs together! Have good sound quality and keep the credits short! There's probably more tips tricks and advice we can offer. Let us know if we can help, it's part of our ethos. Feel free to add tips and insights below... Meanwhile - Date for the diary Saturday 25th May 7pm start @TheDukesCinema #LA1Shorts Best of luck to you all. Keep rolling! üëç https://lnkd.in/etXdCGz7\n\n(CONT.) Recent film industry-related regulatory reforms and other noteworthy developments in key African regions. #Malawi: - Inaugural Malawi Film Festival: The Malawi Film Festival was launched in 2022, and organized by the Film Association of Malawi (FAMA). The festival is part of FAMA's strategy to provide a platform for filmmakers to showcase their work and celebrate the artistry of Malawian cinema. The aim is to highlight the potential of the film industry in contributing to the country's socio-economic development. - Training: As part of the festival's activities, film training workshops focusing on film production and acting, will train hundreds of filmmakers. Women are particularly encouraged to participate in these training sessions. - Government Support: The Malawian government pledged ongoing support to the creative industry, including film, to contribute effectively to the country's development. This was stated by the Deputy Minister of Local Government, Unity, and Culture, Owen Chomanika, as part of the country's Malawi 2063 (MW2063) initiative, which seeks to transform Malawi into a wealthy, self-reliant, industrialized middle-income country. - Challenges and Calls for Support: Despite these positive developments, FAMA's President, Gift Sukali, has cited a lack of funds as a major setback to the industry. He emphasized the need for more government-sponsored programs to support filmmakers. These developments demonstrate the Malawian government's awareness of the film industry's potential for cultural representation and economic growth, although challenges remain to be fully addressed.\n\nWe‚Äôre often asked, regarding the Cinema Columbus Film Festival, ‚ÄúWhat is CAPA‚Äôs interest in hosting a film festival? How does that relate to everything else CAPA does?‚Äù I think these are really interesting questions. Let's start back in 1928. The Ohio Theatre was built as a movie house. Flash forward to 1969, when CAPA was created in order to save the Ohio Theatre from the wrecking ball. In CAPA‚Äôs formative years, it was the Summer Movie Series that financially sustained us even as we began the transition to live performances and served as the home for the Columbus Symphony. From Harry Potter films with the CSO to stunning video backdrops for touring Broadway shows, film/animation remains woven into the programming that we provide to our community today. And I have no doubt that the technologies being created now will ensure this partnership lasts well into the future. We think of Cinema Columbus, which marks its third year in 2024, as not only a festival ‚Äúin‚Äù our city but also ‚Äúabout‚Äù our city and ‚Äúfor‚Äù our city. We bring in films from all over the country and internationally, but we're just as focused on promoting the film industry and the creatives that we've got right here in Columbus. Creating awareness for the film/animation industry. Creating pride in our city. Showing the talent we've got in terms of filmmaking here in Columbus. The festival is an opportunity to shine in all of these areas. I think what we're going to see over the long term is more films that are being shot and produced here in Columbus. This growth will happen as a result of the tremendous talent in our local film community and the hard work of many to make this a great city for film. But we believe Cinema Columbus can serve as a catalyst in giving this important industry the recognition it deserves.\n\nAs we traveled to film festivals over the past four years, there is one discussion I had with a young film maker that is burned into my memory. His movie was rejected from most all faith based film festivals because his movie dealt with drugs and had violence in it. He made the movie for almost zero dollars with high school friends. It was truly worthy of recognition. The keynote speaker just spent an hour talking about how \"We have a seat at Hollywood's Table now!\" He looked at me and said \"But I don't have a seat at the table here.\" I knew then that we had to change things. We needed to do two things. 1. Recognize legitimate talent regardless of age. 2. Create a way to build audiences and marketplaces for newer content shunned by older faith based generations. Young talent. Young audiences. New Genres. Science Fiction. Adult Animation. Comedy. Action/Adventure. That's the secret. So we started the work on Fridge Magnet and today we're opening up the opportunity for all filmmakers who want to change the world, young or old to get their project noticed, published and streaming to an audience. As the name implies, Fridge Magnet's are used to highlight new artists and their work. And we are excited to have a continual showcase for new and upcoming talent who are bold risk takers and story tellers. Think of Fridge Magnet as the film festival that never ends. Tell the world.\n\nMust-read film industry memo alert! I'm so proud of supporting this work to elevate San Francisco Bay Area film. I commissioned two Bay Area film research projects, while at Kenneth Rainin Foundation, to deep our understanding of how the Arts Program could better support local filmmakers. I thought learning more about the local film industry would be essential to go beyond just making grants to actually help nurture the ecosystem. After the first project, researcher John Carnwath of WolfBrown recommended that we could greatly deepen our understanding with a follow-up project that could be led by Paula Smith Arrigoni, whom he interviewed as a Bay Area film leader adding perspective to his desk research. Paula, John and Bay Area Video Coalition's research and development manager, Kailen Sallander, did a remarkable job with the second project. There's tons to learn from BAVC's survey of the Bay Area‚Äôs makers and accompanying examination of what we can learn from other cities and regions successfully competing to attract film and media projects. Austin, Denver and New Orleans, to name a few, have major lessons for the Bay and I'm grateful for Paula's idea to subsequently publish the memo below. The work is already contributing to advances in the field. Namely bolstering the Oakland Film Commission's case supporting it's first film rebate incentive and a new production database. Despite huge budget challenges this year, the Oakland City Council approved it! The research's lesson are likely useful for many parts of the country, so if you work in or support film, get to reading. The memo takes the findings and makes them extremely actionable.\n\nA Saudi film chased an award at Cannes in May 2024 ‚Äî marking a first, but likely not last, for the country at the prestigious film festival. That movie, ‚ÄúNorah,‚Äù is a drama about artistic repression in the kingdom in the 1990s from director Tawfik AlZaidi and was selected to compete in the Un Certain Regard category, which has served as a launching pad for emerging film talent. Although ‚ÄúNorah‚Äù didn‚Äôt win, its inclusion at Cannes was another step toward Saudi ambitions to become a film industry powerhouse, an aspiration that‚Äôs nearing an inflection point that could reshape the entertainment industry in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) only a few years removed from cinemas being banned in the kingdom. Saudi-made movies like ‚ÄúNorah‚Äù could soon become commonplace in the Arab world, where Egyptian films long reigned and the desert vistas of the UAE and Jordan have more recently attracted Hollywood. Now Saudi Arabia wants a piece of that action, and the door is open for the oil rich kingdom to seize the spotlight as many of MENA‚Äôs traditional cultural hubs struggle with instability and economic crisis. Amid its sweeping Vision 2030 economic transformation plan, Saudi Arabia has been pouring resources into financing movies, building studios and hosting festivals. Such moves aren‚Äôt necessarily new in MENA but still stand out, notes William Higbee, a professor in film studies at the UK‚Äôs University of Exeter who has studied MENA‚Äôs film industry. ‚ÄúThe scale and ambition of Saudi Arabia is greater than what we‚Äôve seen before,‚Äù Higbee tells Al-Monitor."
