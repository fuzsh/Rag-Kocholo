        "text": "‘Canada’s coolest film fest’ continues to support emerging, diverse and domestic talent with three note-worthy LGBTQ+ focused films, all of which are available to screen online.\n\nThe 21st edition of the Whistler Film Festival will be presented as a hybrid event in Whistler, December 1 to 5 and online December 1 to 31. In-person screenings, Content Summit and events take place in Whistler, British Columbia, from December 1 to 5. From December 1 to 31, audiences across Canada will be able to stream 81 films, access filmmaker Q&As, and attend a virtual Awards Celebration in true Whistler style.\n\nDAWN HER DAD AND THE TRACTOR (Western Canadian Premiere at WFF): John Andrew's (TRAILER PARK BOYS’ Robb Wells) son Donald is now Dawn, home to mourn her mother and repair the estrangement with her Dad. Dawn's attractive looks cause significant reactions from the jocks she grew up with. Some hit on her, not realizing her secret transition, while one fellow remembers gay encounters from the past, which serves to stir up even more confusion. Still, the whole exercise is anchored by a stunning performance by Maya V. Henry (who has 200,000 followers on YouTube). This is a rare example of a transgender performer being allowed to play a transgender character in a feature film. Director Thompson has a son in real life who transitioned, and wanted to ensure authenticity in the casting. Ultimately, the film is about the need for acceptance, both within the immediate family and within the broader community. Another winner from the Maritimes.\n\nPAT ROCCO DARED (World Premiere at WFF): This entertaining and enlightening documentary sheds a light on a pioneering moment in film history and the gay rights movement, as it revisits the break-through 1960s gay films of Pat Rocco. Rocco was responsible for the very first gay films that were shown openly to the paying public in the late 1960s.\n\nMOON MANOR (Canadian Premiere at WFF): A surprisingly upbeat movie, given its somewhat downbeat subject matter. Jimmy is an older man who has proudly lived his life as a gay man.Throughout his final day, we get to know this gay man’s extraordinary life, his wit and good humour as he chose to live a rich and fulfilling life outside of society’s usual norms.\n\nIn-person screenings, Content Summit and events take place in Whistler, British Columbia, from December 1 to 5. From December 1 to 31, audiences across Canada will be able to stream 81 films, access filmmaker Q&As, and attend a virtual Awards Celebration in true Whistler style.\n\nWFF will deliver its Content Summit from December 1 to 10, as a unique hybrid industry event, presenting a snapshot of the most transformative ideas shaping the future of screen entertainment. With over 34 sessions, including keynote conversations, masterclasses, workshops, fireside chats, roundtables, and 1+1 Virtual Market meetings featuring forward thinkers, innovators, and decision-makers, there's something for every interest. 1+1 Virtual Market Meetings registration is now open to Industry and Premium Industry Passholders. Register now.\n\nThe WFF online box office at whistlerfilmfestival.com/tickets/ is open for Tickets, Passes and Ticket Packages for both online streaming and in-theatre films. 50% of net proceeds from online ticket revenues will be shared with the filmmakers or Canadian rights holders. The Festival Box Office is open for phone sales (1-877-838-FILM). Planning to attend the Whistler Film Festival in person? Air travel, ground transportation deals and early bird accommodation rates from WFF’s accommodation partners are available at https://whistlerfilmfestival.com/attendwff/.\n\nProvincial health protocols are in effect and proof of vaccination will be required to enter WFF venues.\n\nThe Whistler Film Festival is funded by the Government of Canada through Telefilm Canada, by the Province of British Columbia and the Resort Municipality of Whistler. We gratefully acknowledge our major festival sponsors: Creative BC, Variety, Directors Guild of Canada-British Columbia, Tourism Whistler, Netflix, Canada Media Fund and William F. White International."
