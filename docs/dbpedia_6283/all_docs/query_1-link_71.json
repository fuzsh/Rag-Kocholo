        "text": "One of the earliest known ­images in British art is the engraving on bone of a horse’s head, found in 1876 at Creswell Crags, Derbyshire. It was discovered among the bones of ­numerous animals – hyenas, woolly rhinoceros, cave lions, bears and reindeer – remarkable evidence of one of the few known Ice Age settle­ments in ancient Britain, when the island landscape was bleak, treeless tundra.\n\nMany thousands of years after that image was made, George Stubbs painted romantic scenes of horses in combat with lions at Creswell Crags, unaware of the thrilling Upper Palaeolithic deposits beneath his feet – though you might be forgiven for thinking that somehow, subconsciously, he was. Born in Liverpool on August 25 1724 – this year marks his 300th anniversary – Stubbs was one of the most original English painters, an artist who saw beneath the surface of life, both in a philosophical sense but also quite literally, in his anatomical studies of horses.\n\nThe son of a leatherworker, Stubbs’s interest in these inner workings found early expression in his drawings of foetuses in the womb, illustrations for a pioneering 1751 manual on midwifery by Dr John Burton (caricatured as the incompetent Dr Slop in Laurence Sterne’s Tristram Shandy). Stubbs had performed the dissections himself on women who had died during childbirth, drawing as he went.\n\nHe had been studying anatomy and subsequently giving lectures at York Hospital, although dissection was a shady undertaking; obtaining corpses was still a secretive activity (unless you were prepared to wait for the slim pickings of the hangman), dependent on the grim profession of resurrectionists – corpse diggers. Aside from the moral dubiousness – Stubbs was said to have a “vile reputation” for his dissection of women – there was also the acute risk of infection at a time before antiseptic preparations.\n\nPerhaps as a result of this reputation (details of Stubbs’s biography are scant, to say the least), in 1756 he took himself to the village of Horkstow, in Lincolnshire, to spend 18 months dissecting and drawing horses in a barn. He was accompanied only by a woman, Mary Spencer, who may or may not have been by that time his common-law wife. It was a gruesome task – acquiring horses, probably destined for the knacker’s yard, leading them to the barn where they were bled to death, the veins and arteries injected with preservatives, hung from the ceiling, and then progressively dissected. At each layer of dissection, right down to the skeletal structure, Stubbs worked on precise drawings, positioning the horses in lifelike poses, as if they were walking or simply standing, stripped of their skin. He got through a fair number, each lasting no more than a couple of months before putrefaction made further work impossible.\n\nFor many years, only 12 of the drawings Stubbs made were thought to have survived – the ­finished, worked-up drawings he made in preparation for publication. Then, during the 1960s, a mysterious package was discovered in a dusty corner of the Royal Academy, which when opened was found to contain 30 or so sheets clearly by Stubbs’s hand, the actual working drawings he had made directly from the horses, some of which appear still to have traces of blood and viscera on them.\n\nDissection and drawing were only the beginning of the Herculean labour of Stubbs’s anatomical project. When he was done with Horkstow, he took his portfolio of drawings to London, but couldn’t find anybody skilled enough to engrave them, so spent years teaching himself how to produce the plates for the book that made his name, The Anatomy of the Horse, which finally appeared in 1766.\n\nStubbs’s anatomical drawings launched his career as a painter of thoroughbred horses for wealthy patrons. These were, in effect, a form of portraiture, at a time when portrait-painting was one of the few ways that artists could make a ­living. His great painting of Whistlejacket (c 1762), an Arabian chestnut stallion in the highly-trained position of “levade” (not “rearing”, as it is misdescribed in the catalogue of the National Gallery where the painting hangs), was commissioned by Charles Watson-Wentworth, the Marquess of Rockingham, and fortunately for Stubbs, one of the richest men in Europe.\n\nHis home, Wentworth Woodhouse, in Yorkshire, was full of sculptures commissioned from artists in Italy, but it was his favourite stallion that he commissioned Stubbs to portray. Thoroughbreds – “Bedouin of Arabia, nourished on English grass”, in the memorable words of Geoffrey Grigson – were a relatively new arrival on this island, a cross between Eastern stallions and English mares, bred for speed but also for their sheer physical beauty. Contrary to what you often hear, Whistlejacket was a success on the field, winning many races and much money for its owner, and famous enough to be mentioned by Oliver Goldsmith in his 1773 play She Stoops to Conquer: “I have got you a pair of horses that will fly like Whistlejacket.”\n\nStubbs was perfectly qualified to capture the individual appearance of Whistlejacket, which was entirely the purpose of thoroughbred painting. The sense of a profound knowledge of the organic structure beneath the surface of the horse’s body, the way the parts fit together and life flows through the forms is remarkable to behold. Alongside Whistlejacket, Stubbs painted a scene of Mares and Foals (1762) for Rockingham that might be counted as one of his greatest visualisations of animal life – a scene of five broodmares and two foals against a monochrome background, in which the focus is entirely on the personality and interrelation of the animals as vivid and particularised living beings. The painting has in recent years been on display at the Fitzwilliam Museum, in Cambridge, on loan from Rockingham’s heirs.\n\nThe experimental curiosity that had driven Stubbs to his dissections propelled him into a great realm of animal painting far beyond the familiar image of the horse. He sketched the noisy menagerie in the Tower of London, with caged tigers, bears, ostriches and a baboon, and made paintings of ­animals kept by wealthy patrons, including the first zebra to be seen in England, given as a present to Queen Charlotte, wife of George III, and kept in the menagerie at Buckingham Palace (then Buckingham House). For his great patrons the brothers and leading anatomists William and John Hunter, he painted a nilgai (an Indian antelope), a moose, and a morose looking rhinoceros – said to have been fond of slurping sweet wine. The rhinoceros now hangs in the Hunterian Museum, part of the Royal College of Surgeons at Lincoln’s Inn Fields, in London.\n\nThese paintings of exotic beasts show not only Stubbs’s great curiosity, but also an idea of painting as a source of scientific knowledge. “Good paintings of animals give much clearer ideas than descriptions,” wrote William Hunter, on presenting a paper about the “Nyl-ghau” to the Royal Society in 1771. After seeing Stubbs’s painting, you would be sure to know a nilgai if you met one.\n\nWhether he was the English Leonardo, as is so often claimed, is another question. Stubbs most likely knew of the great stash of Leonardo’s anatomical drawings held at Windsor Castle, rediscovered during his lifetime. His The Anatomy of the Horse was the realisation of a project that Leonardo, the undisputed pioneer of comparative anatomy, had intended but, like so many of his grand ideas, never brought to completion. Stubbs, like Leonardo, was a great technical experimenter, pioneering a technique of painting with enamel that led to a collaboration with Josiah Wedgwood, who ­created ceramic supports upon which Stubbs painted.\n\nAnd yet, in the final count, they remain very different artists. Where Leonardo’s boundless imagination took in a great range of subjects – mechanics, optics, hydrodynamics, aerodynamics, as well as religious subjects and profoundly poetic portraits – Stubbs remained fixated on animal anatomy, creating paintings of an entirely different nature to those by Leonardo. It is certainly true to say of Stubbs that he elevated the genre of sporting painting to “high art”, but his crucial contribution, aside from anatomical exactitude, was to give his animals psychological expression and depth.\n\nUnlike Leonardo, who was driven by the search for universals, Stubbs painted psychological portraits of individual animals. “His dogs and horses are the real, living thing,” wrote Joseph Mayer, one of his early biographers, in 1879. “Stubbs was the first to paint animals as they are… and never showed an immortal soul in a poodle’s eye.” Such an immortal soul emanating from an animal eye was entirely the point of Leonardo.\n\nIt has become a commonplace to say that Stubbs was more than a painter of horses, although it is less commonly heard that he is an equal to the greatest of English painters, of Reynolds in his own time, and Constable and Turner in the next century. Many of his paintings remain secluded in private collections, so that our view of him still remains partial – and not helped by the lack of any major showing of his work in Britain during this, his ­tricentenary year. The matter of ­ownership was the subject of the beguiling 2022 film Bloodlines, by the artist Amie Siegel, which follows the transportation of Stubbs’s paintings for an exhibition of his work at the Milton Keynes Gallery in 2019.\n\nSiegel’s film makes the ­simple point that many of these paintings remain in the houses of the descendants of the men who commissioned them. The atmosphere of these grand houses around England and Scotland seems to ­preserve the world for which they were made. Bloodlines might be read as a criticism of inherited wealth, although the presence of Stubbs’s paintings offers a counterweight to any sense of injustice. These are works of art that go beyond mere class signifiers, offering a window onto a much wider world in which stableboys, jockeys and farm labourers are pictured as often as the rural gentry, and often in a more heroic cast. The horses and other animals Stubbs paints are not mere possessions, or scientific specimens, but living creatures whose natural animal rights he honours in his highly individualised portraits.\n\nBut for all the captivating quality of his anatomical drawings, and his penetrating and psychological visions of animal life, it is the sheer modernity of Stubbs’s world, and the English landscape that he so excelled at painting, that draws me to his work. One of my earliest encounters with Stubbs was standing in the balcony gallery at the Fitzwilliam Museum, gazing at Gimcrack with John Pratt up on Newmarket Heath (c 1765). The jockey John Pratt looks thoughtfully into the distance with the air of an ancient sage. His horse Gimcrack also appears to be lost in thought, perhaps more with trepidation at the race for which they are training that morning. They stand silent and still in a space that appears both familiar and entirely out of time. A solitary white post on the left balances the composition like a perfectly placed punctuation mark. To the right, the monumental form of a rubbing-down house has the presence of an Egyptian pyramid.\n\nIn other Newmarket paintings, these minimalist structures are often the sole subject, emphasising the vast emptiness of the racing flats. It is this emptiness that Stubbs paints so well, as if his true subject went far beyond mere sporting painting, and was rather the island atmosphere itself, the softness of the air and the watery English light.\n\nJohn-Paul Stonard’s latest book is Creation: Art Since the Beginning (Bloomsbury, £30)"
