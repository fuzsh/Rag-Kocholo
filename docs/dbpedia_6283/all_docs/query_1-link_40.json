        "text": "Snowmaking and Climate Change\n\nClimate change has had a significant impact on winter resorts on both a regional and global level. Just look at the altitudinal-dependent natural snow line: it has become more difficult for winter resorts to reliably set scheduled openings, not to mention the challenges of ensuring that there is enough snow coverage all the way to the valley floor. These issues have a significant impact on the people who live in resort towns, on visitors and tourism, and, ultimately, on the bottom line, affecting the resorts’ financial vitality.\n\nWhistler Through Instagram – The Realities\n\nOn the Tourism Whistler website I’d stare at their backdrop photo. The mountain runs looked like a bowl of vanilla ice cream topped with mint chocolate sauce dripping down the slopes. It looked so tasty.\n\nBefore coming to Whistler I scrolled Instagram daily on #whistler. The pictures revealed secret spots, action sports and the tourist traps to avoid. It also showed me what my age bracket are up to and where I should get my first drink…\n\n5 Things to do in Whistler on a Budget\n\nSeasons pass $1999, new skis/board $300+, rent per month $500+, apres fund per week $50+ = Whistler is expensive.\n\nGibbons has been part of the Whistler community for over 30 years and so we thought we’d share a few of the activities that the locals love that won’t break the bank.\n\nWhat tickets to grab ASAP for the Whistler Film Festival\n\nFrom December 3rd to 7th, 2014, the Whistler Film Festival (WFF) will celebrate its 14th edition as one of Canada’s leading festivals. Featuring innovative and original films from around the world and opportunities to connect with the people who made them, this year’s five day Festival will be filled with a solid lineup of premieres, star-studded guests, lively celebrations and unique industry initiatives.\n\nGrowing a Community – One Bloody Shower Scene at a Time\n\nThere are two ways to solve any problem. You can throw money at it or you can get creative. Heavy Hitting HorrorFest is all about the second option – Whistler Filmmaker Feet Baks.\n\nWhy We Love Scary Stuff\n\nAn attacker comes at you in your own home, instead of going out the front door you choose to run upstairs and secure yourself in a bathroom with a lock that a small child could break.\n\nBefore you know it a knife (if you’re in the city), axe (if you’re in the country), or smoke (if you’re in a vamp movie) comes through the door.\n\nWhy do we love watching scary movies? What is it about Halloween that gets our juices going?\n\nTelling Stories at The Whistler Writers Festival\n\nGibbons Life is proud to sponsor the Whistler Writers Festival. This is a new partnership for us so we asked someone who’s been involved from the very beginning to give us a run down on this grass roots festival that’s celebrating its 13th year…\n\nWhistler Social Netball League and Netball 101 By Steph Ball\n\nSo for the love of Netball and being deprived from a sport I love so much, the Whistler Social Netball League was founded in December 2012. To give you a quick idea of the sport – the development of netball derived from basketball from England in the 1890s.\n\nCelebrating Girls – The Whistler Pretty Faces Film Premiere\n\nThe United Nations made October 11 International Day of the Girl back in 2011 to recognize girls’ rights and the unique challenges girls face around the world.\n\nThis year Gibbons Life is proud to help bring the second Whistler celebration of International Day of the Girl to life with a speaker event followed by a premier film screening.\n\nLast year the Whistler community celebrated by watching the inspiring film Girl Rising, which followed the stories of a courageous group of girls striving to get an education.\n\nWhistler Ranked #1 For Après in North America – Also Known for Good Skiing…\n\nPrestigious ski publication, SKI Magazine, ranked Whistler as the #1 destination in North America for apres – oh, and for skiing too. The poll is in its 27th year so we guess they know a thing or two about ski resorts…\n\nThe New Super Proof Inc. Ski Movie Will Blow Your Mind\n\nOn September 30th Whistler will play host to the first ever Super Proof team film – The Recruitment. This full-length ski film combines a creative screenplay written by Sean Pettit, Max Hill and Leigh Powis with the talents of seven pro skiers. An untold story, Hollywood stylization and, of course, epic ski action makes this film a must-see for the upcoming winter season. For a sneak peak check out the trailer…"
