Not only does this volume bring together six more gems from the studio’s archives, but it also serves as a showcase for the great Humphrey Bogart.\n\nHaving established his stardom in the gangster pictures of the 1930s, Bogart fit easily into the world of film noir, where he was equally at home playing troubled servicemen, slick-talking lawyers, black marketeers, gambling den owners, or hard-up journalists.\n\nColumbia Noir #5: Humphrey Bogart brings together five of the iconic actor’s starring vehicles: John Cromwell’s Dead Reckoning, Nicholas Ray’s Knock on Any Door, Stuart Heisler’s Tokyo Joe, Curtis Bernhardt’s Sirocco, and Mark Robson’s The Harder They Fall, plus Henry Levin’s The Family Secret, a rarity starring Lee J Cobb and John Derek that was produced by Bogart’s Santana Pictures, an outfit that regularly delved into the seedy, shadowy world of noir.\n\nFeaturing a stunning 4K restoration of The Harder They Fall, and with Sirocco and The Family Secret appearing on Blu-ray for the first time anywhere in the world, this stunning collection includes newly recorded commentaries and critical appreciations, archival documentaries and short films, and a 120-page book.

In The Whistler, a guilt-stricken man hires a contract killer to end his life… but finds he cannot pull out of the deal. The Mark of the Whistler sees a homeless man claim the money in an abandoned bank account, only to find the rightful owners on his tail. In The Power of the Whistler, an amnesiac must reconstruct his dark past using only the items in his pockets. Voice of the Whistler finds a poor nurse marry her wealthy, terminally ill patient, only for him to defy the odds and recover. In Mysterious Intruder, a private eye becomes embroiled in a murderous race to track down a missing girl and a lost fortune. The Secret of the Whistler sees a young bride suspect that her new husband may have murdered his first wife. In Dix’s final film, The Thirteenth Hour, the owner of a trucking company is framed for a murder he didn’t commit. Finally, in The Return of the Whistler, Michael Duane takes the lead as a man whose fiancée is abducted on the eve of their wedding.\n\nThis essential four-disc collection marks the UK Blu-ray premiere of all eight films, and features an array of fascinating contextualising extras, including newly recorded commentaries, critical appreciations, rare archival short films, and a 120-page book.

Got it? If not, the film will beat you over the head with it. Luckily, for at least the first two thirds, it’s an effective work of agitprop, with Lee J Cobb (of that other, more notable Union movie) starring as a shopowner who refuses to let his seamstresses unionize, employing mobster Richard Boone to take care of it for him with violence if necessary. There’s a lot of time wasted on the deadwood son of Cobb and doomed union firebrand Robert Loggia’s Italian wife, but when the film gets in our face with its social messaging, I at least admired its gusto if nothing else. There’s also a wonderful set reveal moment early on in which we see the glamorous changing room of the in-store models is separated by a chickenwire door from the lowly sweatshop workers— it’s a smart visual cue far more effective than anything else here in showing the disconnect between the classes.\n\nRe: Forthcoming: The Garment Jungle\n\nQuote\n\n#3 Post by NABOB OF NOWHERE » Thu Jul 23, 2020 12:48 pm\n\nShould go down a storm in Leicester.\n\nFor those who have lost the thread - https://www.ft.com/content/0b26ee5d-4f4 ... 49038de18c\n\nRe: Forthcoming: The Garment Jungle\n\nQuote\n\n#4 Post by rapta » Thu Jul 23, 2020 6:05 pm\n\nLikely part of a Columbia Noir set (or sets) according to comments made on social media and elsewhere.
