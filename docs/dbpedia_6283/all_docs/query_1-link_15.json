        "text": "While the initial reception of Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo (1958) was unspectacular, it made its presence felt in a host of other films-from Chris Marker's Sans Soleil (1983), to Brian De Palma's Obsession (1976), and David Lynch's Mulholland Dr. (1999). What seemed to have eluded the critics at the time is that Vertigo is a film about being haunted: by illusive images, turbulent emotions, motion and memory, the sound and feeling of falling into the past, into a nightmare. But it is also a shrewdly reflexive film that haunts filmmakers, critics, and artists alike, raising fundamental questions about the ontology of moving images and the regime of fascination (exemplified by Hollywood) that churns them out. Douglas Gordon's Feature Film (1999), D.N. Rodowick's The Wanderers (2016), and Lynn Hershman's VertiGhost (2017) are contemporary examples of how the appropriation and contemplation of some the film's most iconic motifs (the figures of Madeleine, the spiral, the copy or fake, and the fetish), themes (liebestod, obsession, the uncanny) and strategies (mirroring, duplicity, and disorientation) ask us to rethink the relation of fetishism to fabulation, and supplementarity to dissimulation and social engineering. Feature Film, The Wanderers, and VertiGhost are supplementary works, but like the original film they are about duplicity, doppelgänger, and dissimulation. What interests us is how they challenge the authority over, or even proximity to, that which returns in the form of the supplement. And ultimately, attaching themselves to the chain of forgers and forgeries, these supplementary works take their place in the vertiginous sequence of substitutions the film established: a neat allegory for a reign of the digital ghosting that Hitchcock could never have anticipated.\n\nS The sound design of sci-fi horror movies plays a central role in creating the chilling pleasures produced by scary encounters with alien beings. Using Alien (1979) as a central example, this paper explores the idea that a specific stylistic element of the audiovisual design, designated as the (preliminary) shock point, constitutes a defining stylistic trait of the sci-fi horror genre’s spectacle. This article will seek to show that this stylistic element functions as a priming mechanism, playing with spectators’ expectations of the scary spectacle in sci-fi horror films as well as with their knowledge of the genre. Lyddesign i sci-fi-horrorfilm spiller en væsentlig rolle i skabelsen af de uhyggelige og ophidsende fornøjelser som opstår I mødet med skræmmende monstre. Med Alien (1979) som et centralt eksempel, undersøger denne artikel ideen om at et bestemt stilistisk element, betegnet chok punktet, udgør et afgørende stilistisk træk indenfor sci-fi-horror genren. Det er intentione...\n\nThis paper offers a broad historical overview of the ideology and cultural roots of horror films. The genre of horror has been an important part of film history from the beginning and has never fallen from public popularity. It has also been a staple category of multiple national cinemas, and benefits from a most extensive network of extra-cinematic institutions. Horror movies aim to rudely move us out of our complacency in the quotidian world, by way of negative emotions such as horror, fear, suspense, terror, and disgust. To do so, horror addresses fears that are both universally taboo and that also respond to historically and culturally specific anxieties. The ideology of horror has shifted historically according to contemporaneous cultural anxieties, including the fear of repressed animal desires, sexual difference, nuclear warfare and mass annihilation, lurking madness and violence hiding underneath the quotidian, and bodily decay. But whatever the particular fears exploited by..."
