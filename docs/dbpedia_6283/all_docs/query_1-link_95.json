It has a deep beating heart and brilliant visual treats, extraordinary performances and fantastic beastly fight scenes... And it cost less than the entire craft service budget on Doctor Strange and/or any other Marvel movie.\"\n\nCurtis can be seen next in the new sci-fi action film Borderlands, which is based on the popular video game series and is set for release on 9 August."
