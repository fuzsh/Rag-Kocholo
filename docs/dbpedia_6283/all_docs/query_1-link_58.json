        "text": "Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret exposes the number one threat to our planet and investigates why none of the major environmental organizations want to talk about it. This humorous and informative documentary has been getting much attention since it premiered and has been dubbed the movie every environmentalist needs to see. There will be a Q&A after the movie with Green Party Candidate and ex Whistler Mayor, Ken Melamed, AWARE Executive Director, Claire Ruddy and Earthsave Whistler Co-Founder, Hayley Ingman.\n\nWatch the trailer at cowspiracy.com\n\nCowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret is a ground breaking feature-length environmental documentary following intrepid filmmaker Kip Andersen as he uncovers the most destructive industry facing the planet today – and investigates why the world’s leading environmental organizations are too afraid to talk about it.\n\nAnimal agriculture is the leading cause of deforestation, water consumption and pollution, is responsible for more greenhouse gases than the transportation industry, and is a primary driver of rainforest destruction, species extinction, habitat loss, topsoil erosion, ocean “dead zones,” and virtually every other environmental ill. Yet it goes on, almost entirely unchallenged.\n\nAs Andersen approaches leaders in the environmental movement, he increasingly uncovers what appears to be an intentional refusal to discuss the issue of animal agriculture, while industry whistleblowers and watchdogs warn him of the risks to his freedom and even his life if he dares to persist.\n\nAs eye-opening as Blackfish and as inspiring as An Inconvenient Truth, this shocking yet humorous documentary reveals the absolutely devastating environmental impact large-scale factory farming has on our planet, and offers a path to global sustainability for a growing population.\n\nThere will be a panel of speakers leading the discussion after the movie – Green Party Candidate and ex-Whistler Mayor, Ken Melamed, AWARE Executive Director, Claire Ruddy and Earthsave Whistler Co-Founder, Hayley Ingman.\n\nKen Melamed\n\nKen is the candidate for the Green Party of Canada in the coming federal election. Twice elected mayor, three term councillor and past AWARE president, Ken has been instrumental in Whistler’s evolution as a global leader in mountain resort tourism and community sustainability planning.\n\nKen has served on a number of boards including Smart Growth BC, Fraser Basin Council, Tourism Whistler, Whistler Housing Authority, and the Whistler Chamber of Commerce.\n\nIn 2012, Ken received the Queen’s Jubilee Medal awarded to honour significant contributions and achievements by Canadians.\n\nClaire Ruddy\n\nClaire has studied and worked in the environmental sector since 1999. In the UK she has worked with businesses to reduce environmental impacts and since arriving in Whistler in 2006 she engaged heavily with Whistler’s environmental charity AWARE, where she now works with as Executive Director. While on a push to reduce her personal environmental footprint Claire decided to change her diet to become predominantly plant-based, with a ‘vegan at home’ regime. Three years on and there is no looking back.\n\nHayley Ingman\n\nHayley runs the Whistler chapter of Earthsave Canada, a registered charity helping people choose foods that benefit our health, the environment, and the lives of all animals. She has been enjoying a plant-based diet for the past 17 years and continues to learn about its benefits. She has a certificate in Plant-based Nutrition from Cornell University and a Raw Food Chef certification from Matthew Kenney Cuisine."
