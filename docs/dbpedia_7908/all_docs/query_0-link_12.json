        "text": "The Rolling Stones boast one of the most illustrious and influential histories in the annals of rock music. With a repertoire spanning more than six decades, their back catalogue holds treasured classics that continue to captivate fans across multiple generations. My personal favourites being the unholy trinity of Gimme Shelter, Sympathy for the Devil and Paint it, Black. Rock n Roll just doesn't get any better than that, in my opinion. But there are countless Stones songs I absolutely adore and listen to A LOT. For fans who may have drifted away from them over the years however, the release of a fresh album, Hackney Diamonds, acts as a catalyst, reigniting the flame of nostalgia and driving renewed interest in the songs that established the band's legendary status. I'm excited about the new record. But I'm equally as excited by the prospect of a whole new audience getting into the Stones' catalogue and discovering such seminal music for the very first time or after a long time away. A spike in interest following the release of the new album also offers an opportunity for fans to delve deeper into the Rolling Stones' back catalogue and rediscover hidden gems. Many tracks, overshadowed by the band's iconic hits, showcase the diversity and artistic flexibility that epitomise the Stones' captivating charm. They are not just a glorified blues band. Far from it, in fact. Optimising the back catalogue allows these hidden treasures to shine, introducing a new generation to lesser-known yet equally brilliant songs. It's really great to see such a focus on catalogue optimisation across the industry at the moment, ensuring that incredible music and iconic artists will be discovered by many generations to come. People will still be listening to the Stones 100 years from now. I wouldn't put it past Keith still being alive then, too. #newmusic #catalogue #optimisation #musicindustry #musicbusiness #musicnews #musicagency #musicmarketing\n\nToday in The Weekend Australian Review, I write about flawless albums with my colleague Alan Howe. When Alan phoned me to lay out the idea for this feature, I was immediately on board, and I listened as my mind’s ear started sketching out a list of titles for potential inclusion. Once I started reviewing those releases to confirm their flawless status, though, I was struck by the surprisingly and fiendishly challenging nature of the task. This isn’t just a list of great albums, it’s those that compel from the first note to the last. Such releases are rarer than you might think. Loads of my favourite collections – and, likely, yours – are spoiled by one or two tracks that you usually skip because they don’t quite measure up to the rest, thus disqualifying them from this list of 52 albums - one for each week of the new year. What follows is a list of albums that are perfect to me. Some titles will be familiar; some you’ll never have heard of (until now). As we turn the page into a new year, we hope you’ll approach this list with an open mind and open ears. You may review this list and think some of our selections are dead wrong. You’ll be right, but you’ll also be wrong, for when it comes to music, there are no correct answers, only opinions – and everyone is allowed to have those.

In the latest edition of the STORYBOOK paper, we delve into a question that social media has been pondering for months: with Rihanna's unofficial retirement from the music industry, could Tyla be poised to fill her shoes as the next non-American global superstar 🌎? On March 22nd, 2024, South African sensation, Tyla Laura Seethal, professionally known as Tyla, released her long-awaited self-titled debut studio album through Fax/Epic Records 🎶 . The album was preceded by popular singles such as ‘Water’ and ‘Truth or Dare’ and represents Tyla’s effort to establish herself in the music industry. The self-titled album recently debuted at #24 on the US Billboard 200, selling 24,000 album-equivalent units in its opening week 💵 . Tyla's ascent has led many fans and critics to draw comparisons between her and the mogul Rihanna, a topic we address in the latest STORYBOOK article. Additionally, we provide a track-by-track breakdown and review of her first LP.

Following last year’s crowning moment of Bryan topping both the Billboard 200 and Billboard Hot 100 in the same week (with his self-titled album and its Kacey Musgraves-featuring lead single “I Remember Everything,” respectively), on May 24 he released the new single “Pink Skies.” This week, the harmonica-laced acoustic number — expected to appear on his upcoming new album — bows at No. 6 on the Hot 100, already the second-highest-charting single of his career, following “Everything.” What does the debut mean for Bryan’s career? And does the song tell us anything about where Bryan may be headed? Billboard staffers discuss these questions and more below. 1. “Pink Skies” debuts at No. 6 on the Hot 100 this week – already Bryan’s second-highest-peaking hit to date, after last year’s No. 1-bowing Kacey Musgraves duet “I Remember Everything.” Is that debut higher, lower or about where you would’ve expected for it? Eric Renner Brown: This placement tracks for me. Bryan is a top-tier star now, and he doesn’t have as much competition in his lane as major pop stars and rappers do in theirs. Plus, “Pink Skies” dropped on a release date without a huge pop album (like Billie Eilish’s the week before) to shoot numerous tracks onto the Hot 100 and crowd other singles out. As he continues to grow in popularity (because I don’t think he’s even close to his ceiling), I think we can expect more strong debuts like this from Bryan. Kyle Denis: This is about right where I expected. Bryan has steadily grown into a streaming force over the past few years, so a top 10 debut isn’t necessarily surprising. Given the stiff competition in the top 5 right now, a No. 6 debut feels just right. Melinda Newman: Higher. There’s always excitement for new music from Bryan (and a seemingly endlessly supply of new tunes coming from him — since May 2022, he’s released two studio albums, two EPs and a live album), but he doesn’t always come in so high. His duet with Maggie Rogers, which came out in 2023 before “I Remember Everything,” peaked at No. 42 on the Hot 100 — and that was after the red-hot success of “Something in the Orange.” Andrew Unterberger: Maybe a little higher — just because we’re in such a loaded moment for big pop hits that a No. 6 debut right now is maybe more like a No. 2 or No. 3 debut a year ago. Not that such a debut would be\n\nIf you're an artist/band with little or no fanbase, please don't be in a hurry to release and album or EP. Even if you have upto 11 well written songs and the budget to record all of them at once, still don't release an album. Here's what I'll advice you to do instead; record all the songs they way you planned, but release 8 of them as singles (one every month). You'll notice that you'll gain new fans with each release (especially if you put in the effort to promote them). After 8 consecutive months of releasing new music every month, you can now announce your 11-track album (of course, those 8 songs you previously released as singles would be part of the album, alongside the other 3 songs you've not released)... This way, you'll have more people listen to the album when it finally drops than you would have gotten if you had just released it initially. Now, before you throw out this post as materialistic, remember that the more listeners you have, the more people you would have impacted by the messages in your songs. #musicindustry #musicbusiness #growth\n\nWould you rather $500,000 or lunch with Jay-Z? Jay-Z recently made headlines with his answer to this question. “You gotta take the money.” He said that what he can offer is already publicly available at a much cheaper price. “You got all that in the music for $10.99 USD. That’s a bad deal, I wouldn’t tell you to cut a bad deal.” Now I’m not sure lunch with Jay-Z is worth $500k, at least not to me in my business. But here’s the way to think about it. 👇 When Jay-Z said you can get all that knowledge for $10.99- he didn’t include the value of your time. According to Wikipedia, Jay-Z has: - 13 studio albums - 1 soundtrack album - 5 collaborative albums - 1 compilation album - 2 live albums - 1 mixtape If each project takes 1 hour to listen to. That’s 23 hours of time listening to his music. And how much time would it take analyzing the lyrics to really understand their meaning? Even though you may be able to learn something on your own, Paying for advice from those with more experience can save you a lot of time and help you avoid mistakes. Again, I’m not sure Jay-Z’s advice is worth $500,000 to me personally. But if someone’s advice can make me an extra $1m of income. I would happily pay $500,000 for that advice. Price only matters in the absence of value.\n\nYou need to give a sh*t about Taylor Swift winning her 4th Album of the Year at The Recording Academy GRAMMYs this year (and being the ONLY Artist to ever do this) Because it applies to YOUR business… 🎤 Yes, EVEN IF YOU DON’T LIKE HER, it still applies to you, because... Taylor Swift started singing at age 9. Taylor is now 34. She has been singing for 25 years. This is a short breakdown of some of the key events from her career*, you can kind of skip over most of it because… 2001 – She learns to play the guitar 2006 – Her 1st single is released 2008 – 2nd album: “Fearless” 2009 – First tour as a headliner 2010 – Wins 4 Grammys, including for album of the year 2010 – 3rd studio album: “Speak Now” 2012 – Fastest-selling single in digital history (“We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together”) 2012 – 4th album: “Red” 2014 – Fifth album: “1989” 2014 – Album of the year Grammy Award for “1989” 2017 – 6th album: “Reputation” 2019 – 7th album: “Lover” 2020 – 8th and 9th albums: “Folklore” & “Evermore” 2020 – Album of the year Grammy for “Folklore” 2022 – 10th studio album: “Midnights” 2024 - Wins her 4th album of the tear for “Midnights”. The point is, it’s LOOOOOOONG, and this is a shortened version. 😅 Taylor didn’t skip steps. She didn’t have an easy run of it. She’s made mistakes. Hell, she’s been slated in the media more times than I think most artists have. But she kept going, and I would say it’s paid off for her. (she's a billionaire FYI) The point is, success is not obtained overnight, but success will NEVER be obtained if you don’t start at all. Start posting on Social Media. 📸 The Internet didn’t disappear after the 80s, and Social Media isn’t going anywhere either (Social Media started in 1997, not long after the Internet & its still kicking). P.s. this post took me 12 minutes to research, write & post and it’s about Taylor Swift god damn it. Start posting. *Source: OfficeTimeline.com #GRAMMYs #TaylorSwift #SocialMediaPosting\n\nWhat does Pink Floyd's song, \"Money,\" have to do with selling? Pink Floyd's album The Dark Side of the Moon is my, \"you're stuck on a deserted island and can only listen to one album for the rest of your life,\" choice. One of my favorite songs on the album is Money. Stay with me non-musicians! The song starts out in 7/8 time (actually 7/4 time, but let's not get TOO technical about it). It's an uncommon choice for a rock song but it's great. The song is going along beautifully, and after a haunting sax solo it switches, unexpectedly, to 4/4 time. The switch to 4/4 time (which bring in David Gilmour's biting guitar solos) \"reinvent\" the song and turn it into something different. It has a different \"feel,\" which works great. Later, for the ending, the song switches back to 7/8 time. (here's a link to the official video if you're interested...the switch comes in at 2:52 - https://lnkd.in/eMDsXHVg) This song would be amazingly great without the time signature changeup. But the time switch makes it SO MUCH more interesting and cool. Sometimes we get lulled into continuing to do the same thing, over and over, even if it's not working for us anymore. Calling the same list, over and over. Sending the same email messages. Giving our \"pitch\" without caring about or listening to the prospect. In Money, the song switches things up then goes back to how it started. In sales, sometimes we need to switch things up too, whether we go back to how we started, because that's what's working best or not. But when we keep doing something just because, \"That's how I've always done it,\" and it's NOT working, that's a losing proposition. Not getting the results you want and need? It may be time to switch to a different time signature, and make more MONEY!! What's your \"deserted island\" album???\n\nReflecting on a Milestone in Hip-Hop History: 20 Years of Jay-Z's \"The Black Album\" 🎶 Today marks the 20th anniversary of a landmark in the hip-hop world - the release of Jay-Z's \"The Black Album.\" This 8th studio album, distributed by Roc-A-Fella Records and Def Jam Recordings, was initially presented as Jay-Z's farewell to music. 🎧 The album's production roster reads like a who's who of the music industry, featuring legends like Just Blaze, Kanye West, The Neptunes, Eminem, DJ Quik, Timbaland, 9th Wonder, and Rick Rubin. A special nod to The Buchananans for their debut with “What More Can I Say.” 🏆 Garnering universal acclaim and commercial success, the album debuted at #1 on the US Billboard 200, selling 463,000 copies in its first week. Now RIAA-Certified 4x Platinum, it stood as Jay-Z’s sixth US number one album. 🔊 An intriguing aspect often overlooked is the vinyl release of “The Black Album” as acapellas, enabling DJs to reimagine the album. This led to \"The Grey Album\" by Danger Mouse, a creative blend of Jay-Z's lyrics with music from the Beatles. 🚫 The controversy surrounding \"The Grey Album\" is notable, with EMI attempting to stop its distribution despite nods from Jay-Z and Beatles members Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr. The response? Grey Tuesday - a digital protest on February 24, 2004, where 170 websites offered the album for free, resulting in over 100,000 downloads in a day. 📅 Two decades later, \"The Black Album\" remains an iconic piece, frequently listed among the all-time greats in music history. A testament to the lasting impact of Jay-Z's artistry. For more on Jay-Z, check out my free newsletter: The Bag - www.newbagdrops.com"
