        "text": "This month we focus on achievers of color born in April who gained success in a variety of fields, such as the arts, business, civil, human and social rights, entertainers, singers, actors, literature, politics, music, dancing, and government, to name a few. Every year we search out people of color, their accomplishments and birth dates to add to this article. We continue to thank the website host “The Black Market” for allowing us to post this article on their website since 1998. Thanks to Tyrone Griffin and his staff.\n\nThe lives of the achievers of color mentioned here transport us to various parts of the United States and other parts of the world, such as Africa, Spain, Netherlands, France, South America, Russia, and the North and South Pole to name a few. If you were born in April, you may share some characteristics with one or more of the achievers born on your birth date.\n\nWe, at Achievers of Color appreciate all the support from those of you who use the article to learn and teach the children, or just to become informed regarding the many contributions people of color have made and are continuing to make within our country and abroad. Some additions have been made from the previous year. Enjoy your learning and thank you. We begin with:\n\nJeremiah Haralson, born April 1, 1846, in Columbus, Georgia, (died possibly in 1916), becomes a slave and kept in bondage until 1865. He will go on to become a politician, who served in the House of Representatives. In 1870, Haralson ran for congress as an independent and defeated the republican candidate. The 21st District elected Haralson to the state senate and two years later he urged Black voters to turn away from the republican movement and remain loyal to the reelection of President Grant. In 1874, Haralson elected to Congress and took his seat Mar. 4, 1875, served on the Committee on Public Expenditures. Though he made no speeches on the House floor, he introduced several pieces of legislation, including a bill to use proceeds from public land sales for educational purposes and a bill for the relief of the Medical College of Alabama. After leaving Congress, Haralson worked as a clerk at Baltimore’s federal custom house and a clerk in the Department of the Interior. By 1912, Haralson returned to Alabama and settled in Selma, but he soon began years as a wanderer, drifting to Texas, Oklahoma, and Colorado. Historians have determined wild animals killed him in 1916, but no official records exist to confirm his death has appeared so far.\n\nJohn H. Riddick, born April 1, 1848, in Sunbury, Gates County, North Carolina, (His death records have not been found in any of the resource material available) becomes a minister, councilman and deputy marshal. In 1857, he moved to Norfolk, Virginia, a slave owned by Rev. Isaac Hunter of Virginia. During the war he served in both armies as a body servant. In 1864, he served in the custom-house of Norfolk, Virginia, under Major J.H. Hudson, special collector appointed by President Lincoln. Riddick later moved to northeast Pennsylvania, where he converted and began the study of theology under Dr. Samuel G. Ortor. He then spent four years in Boston, Massachusetts, where he worked days for support and studied theology and medicine at night, with plans of going into missionary work in some foreign country. He returned to Virginia in 1869. He became an ordained minister in 1871, and elected to the city council of Norfolk, Virginia, and appointed United States deputy marshal in 1872, at the Grant and Greeley election. He has served as an educator among the freedmen in the South and served at the Methodist Conference as a minister of the gospel. Riddick has always been noted for his loyalty to his race and courage for the right and honesty of purpose. When a number of Black people were murdered in the Danville riot, Riddick became the first to lift his voice among all colored men in the state, in a strong address against the murderers at Staunton, Virginia, and their sympathizers. Five thousand copies of the address were published and distributed by request of the people.\n\nAugustus Tolton, born April 1, 1854, in Ralls County, Missouri, (died in 1897), becomes the first universally-recognized Catholic priest in the United States. Augustine Tolton becomes the second Black in America to be ordained a priest in the Roman Catholic Church, born into slavery, the son of Martha Jane Crisley and Peter Paul Tolton. His father left home in 1861 to join the Union Army, and died during the war. His mother escaped with the family into Illinois and freedom, and eventually all the children, went to work in a tobacco factory in Quincy, Illinois. The mother, who had been baptized a Catholic many years before, took the family to the local church and the priest allowed Tolton into the parish school. As he grew up, he aspired to the priesthood and took some training, especially in languages, from a group of German Franciscans. Unable to attend a nearby seminary, the bishop found a way for him to attend the college of the Propagation of the Faith in Rome. He moved to Rome in 1880 and studied there for five years. In 1886 he became ordained and served his first mass on the high altar of St. Peter’s Cathedral in the Vatican, a place usually reserved for the Pope to say mass. There followed some discussion at the time of his ordination over whether Tolton should be sent to the mission field or back to the United States. In the end Cardinal Simeoni sent him back home. Tolton returned to America in 1886 as the only black priest in the United States (the first black priest, James Augustine Healy, at this time served as a bishop).\n\nReuben S. Smith born April 1, 1854, in Jackson County, Florida, (died in possibly 1904), becomes an attorney who taught school before entering politics and going to Washington, D.C. to serve as alternate delegate-at-large from Florida at the National Republican Convention, in 1876, held in Cincinnati, Ohio. Smith worked as a clerk in the United States Treasury department. He also worked as a Washington correspondent for several newspapers. He graduated from the law department of Howard University in 1883.\n\nAlberta Hunter, born April 1, 1895, in Memphis, Tennessee, (died October 17, 1984), becomes a blues singer. In 1936, she also appeared in the film “Radio Parade.” Hunter, semi-retired from 1954 to 1977, became a nurse during these years. In 1961, she would record with Lovie Austin, and in 1962, record with Jimmy Archey. Besides being a blues singer, she became a composer. She wrote at least on classic composition entitled “Downhearted Blues,” a tune which would become famous for blues singer Bessie Smith, in 1923. Hunter recorded under various labels and used at least two other pseudonyms, Mary Alix and Josephine Beatty. (From: Black Women in America, Powerful Black Women)\n\nLucille Bogan, born April 1, 1897, in Amory, Mississippi (died August 10,1948), becomes a blues singer. She is best remembered by blues collectors and historians for writing and singing “Shave Em’ Dry,” one of the bawdiest blues songs ever recorded. In her music, Bogan explored explicit sexual themes and tales of prostitution. Her reputation for risqué’ lyrics and her blatant dealings with controversial topics such as lesbianism and adultery often overshadowed any of her contributions to blues. In 1923, she made her first recording for the Okeh label in New York City. She also recorded for Paramount and Brunswick labels. Sometimes she would record under the pseudonym of Bessie Jackson. In the 1930s she managed a group called Bogan’s Birmingham Busters. She died in 1948, in Los Angeles, California. She became one of the first blues singers to be recorded.\n\nJuliette Aline Derricotte, born April 1, 1897, in Athens, Georgia, the fifth of nine children of Isaac and Laura Hardwick Derricotte, (died in 1931), becomes the first woman trustee of Talladega College, appointed in 1918. Derricotte served as a delegate at the World’s Student Christian Federation convention in the years 1924 and 1928, where she represented all American students. She served as the YWCA’s National Student Secretary. She resigned this position in 1929 to become Dean of Women at Fisk University. In November of 1931, she decided to return home for a visit with her mother. Making the trip with her were three Fisk students from Georgia. The group stopped in Chattanooga, Tennessee, for lunch, with Derricotte driving. About a mile outside Dalton, Georgia, the car collided with that of a white couple. The details of the accident have never been known. Derricotte and one other student were seriously injured. The other two students were treated and released from the hospital. The local tax-supported hospital did not admit Black patients, so Derricotte and the other student were taken to the home of a local Black woman who had beds available for the care of Black patients. The student dies during the night, and they took Derricotte to Chattanooga’s Walden Hospital, where she died the next day. Many in the Black community attributed her death to the policies of segregation which kept her from getting immediate medical care. Memorial services were held all over the country. Her friend, Howard Thurman delivered the eulogy in her home town. He recanted the words she spoke at Mysore conferences in China and Japan, “My head whirls, but now and again I remember that there is so much more to know than I am accustomed to knowing, and so much more love, than I am accustomed to loving,” (December 1929). The Juliette Derricotte Day Care Program has been formed in Mobile, Alabama in her honor, and there is also a building on the campus of Talladega College dedicated to the memory of Juliette Derricotte, built in 1940-1941, as a gift from the Harkness Foundation. It formerly served as a staff residence and guesthouse, but in 1988, it became converted into a women’s honors dormitory.\n\nClara “Mother” McBride Hale, born April 1, 1905, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, (died December 18, 1992), becomes the founder of a home for children. She spent her life caring for children, beginning with a foster home for children out of her own home, and in 1969, she began caring for drug babies. This happened when a young woman appeared at her door with a note from Clara’s daughter, Lorraine, and left the baby on the floor. A few days later the mother appeared with two more children. After that, the word soon spread, and other mothers began bringing their babies. In 1970, at the age of 65, Hale founded Hale House, a home for drug-addicted babies. With a small staff, she would care for 800 or more babies born to drugs and children with AIDS. She received funds from private and public sources. In his 1985 State of the Union Address, former President Ronald Reagan hailed Mother Hale as an American hero. Hale received two awards from the Salvation Army’s, their highest awards, in 1987. She died in 1992. Her daughter, Dr. Lorraine Hale, PhD. took over as director of Hale House.

Christianity Before Christ American Atheist Press p. xiii)\n\nHarry Carney, born April 1, 1910, in Boston, Massachusetts, (died Oct. 8, 1974), becomes a jazz musician, who began his musical career playing the clarinet. At the age of seventeen, he ran off to join Duke Ellington’s (born April 29, 1899-May 24, 1974) band. After being noticed by Ellington in 1927 during a working trip to New York City, the famed bandleader talked Carney’s parents into allowing their son to join his band. He began on alto sax, and then shifted almost exclusively to baritone, occasionally playing bass clarinet and clarinet over the years. Carney, who for years also acted as Ellington’s chief driver, became very closely linked with Duke and his orchestra. After Ellington’s 1974 death, Carney said: “This is the worst day of my life. Without Duke I have nothing to live for.” And four months later, Carney also died.

Her parents were both teachers. She spent 30 years employed at the New York Public Library. She began this journey in 1937. The library located on 135th Street Branch, later became changed to the Countee Cullen Regional Branch. Baker retired as the coordinator of children’s services in 1974. In 1953, Baker became the first Black librarian to be appointed to an administrative position at the New York Public Library, one of the largest public library systems in the world during that period of history. She talked to editors, authors, and publishers about the need for better books about Black life, enlisting the help of interracial organizations in the cause. Baker helped to advance the idea that books could help children of different cultures and traditions understand and respect one another while instilling pride in their own traditions. During the 1950s, Bake received national recognition for her efforts. She became the first recipient of the E. P. Dutton-John MaCrae Award from the American Library Association (ASA). She has also served as a consultant for the TV show “Sesame Street.” Throughout her career, Baker has received many awards and honors.

As the boys grew older, they began singing in the choir of the Cyrene African Methodist Episcopal Church and in the Park Avenue Baptist Church in Piqua. After their lessons at the Spring Street Grammar School, they would gather in front of their father’s barbershop on Public Square or at the corner of Greene and Main to sing and play the kazoo to passers-by. At one show, Harry Mills forgot his kazoo – the group’s usual accompaniment – and ended up trying to emulate the instrument by cupping his hand over his mouth. The brothers were surprised to hear the sound of a trumpet proceeding from Harry’s mouth and they began to work the novelty into their act. The innovation would help define their style of music – with John, who also accompanied the group on ukulele and guitar, mimicking tuba and bass trumpet, Donald the trombone and saxophone, and Herbert (the subject of this biographical entry) makes the second trumpet and saxophone. Broadcasting executive William S. Paley, at CBS radio in New York, turned on his office speaker one day in September of 1930 at the urging of Ralph Wonders to listen to a broadcast of these four young men that had been performing under different names in Cincinnati on WLW. When Paley heard their performance, he immediately set about arranging for them to broadcast on network CBS radio. The Mills Brothers signed a three-year contract and became the first African- Americans to have a network show on radio.

He became known as a Boogie piano master. While both Richard and Brown at one point relied on religious zeal, Milburn relied on the devil’s firewater for inspiration. He graduated from high school in 1942, and after lying about his age, enlisted in the Navy. While in the Navy, he developed a boogie-woogie style of playing piano in the officer’s messes across the world. When he returned to Houston, he signed with Aladdin label and played the club circuit.

(died April 1, 1984), becomes one of Motown record label’s greatest R&B singer. Gaye signed with Motown in 1962 and began a 22- year career that included hits with Mary Wells and Tammi Terrell. He sang in church as a child and grew up listening to Ray Charles, who became a major influence on his work. In 1958, he joined the vocal group the Moonglows. Three years later, he signed a recording contract with Tamla, one of the subsidiaries of Motown Record Company, serving as a drummer and later, as a singer. Further influenced by Frank Sinatra, and Nat “King” Cole, Gaye had hoped to sing as a crooner. But after his first album received little attention, Motown had him record a more up-tempo style of soul music. Some of his songs that became classics are “Stubborn Kind of Fellow” and “I Heard It through the Grapevine.” Some of Gaye’s other popular records from the Motown era include “Can I Get a Witness,” “How Sweet It Is,” “Ain’t That Peculiar,” and “I’ll Be Doggone.” Later in the decade, Marvin Gaye recorded a series of romantic duets with Tammi Terrell. Shortly after Terrell’s death in 1970, Gaye established a new style of music with the album “What’s Going On,” a deeply personal and spiritual reflection on family, social issues and the Vietnam War. This work marked one of the first times Motown had given an artist nearly complete creative control. By the end of the 1970s, Gaye’s career declined and his personal problems mounted. He retreated to Europe, where he recorded the hit song “Sexual Healing” which won two Grammy Awards. He then returned to the United States and moved in with his parents. In 1984, in the midst of a heated quarrel, his father shot him to death. Three years later, he received induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Boyd told Contemporary Authors in an interview, “I think like a poet who alters my view of the ordinary. I am inspired to write by whatever catches my eye or ear or heart. I am especially attracted to history, or what I feel is of historical interest. As a black person living in America, I am concerned about the conditions and circumstances of oppressed people in this country and elsewhere. I am interested in bringing attention to what is too often ignored or belittled in this fast-paced society driven by greed and materialism. I am also interested in the beauty of life, and in finding beauty that is distinct in its own being. Although I often write on difficult and painful subjects that reflect suffering and injustice, I still believe that humanity is capable of greatness that contradicts the severity of its most ugly moments.” (From: Contemporary Authors)\n\nGregory Abbott, born April 2, 1954, in New York City, New York, becomes an R&B soul singer and musician, playing the keyboard and drums.
