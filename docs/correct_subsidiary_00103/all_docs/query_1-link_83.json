        "text": "TARGET AUDIENCE\n\nThis activity has been designed to meet the educational needs of oncology nurses, nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists involved in the treatment of prostate cancer.\n\nOVERVIEW OF ACTIVITY\n\nCancers of the genitourinary system affect hundreds of thousands of individuals within the United States each year and account for more than one fourth of all newly diagnosed human cancer cases. Of this diverse array of distinct diseases, tumors of the prostate are among the most prevalent and are thus the focus of extensive ongoing clinical research. A result of this research is that the clinical management of both early and more advanced presentations of prostate cancer (PC) is constantly evolving, necessitating rapid and consistent access to learning opportunities for nurses who care for these patients. Interprofessional collaboration is becoming increasingly important in the provision of effective care, and prospective and retrospective patient-level research has shown that oncology nurses can play a critical role in the successful delivery of systemic therapy.\n\nThis webcast archive of a live CNE webinar symposium originally planned for the 2020 ONS Congress in partnership with The University of South Florida (USF Health) Office of Continuing Professional Development uses the perspectives of a group of leading clinical investigators and nurse practitioners to address some of the most frequently encountered questions and controversies facing clinicians involved in the management of PC and thus to help oncology nurses in the optimal application of newer, more effective options in patient care.\n\nPURPOSE STATEMENT\n\nBy providing information on the latest research developments in the context of expert perspectives, this CNE (NCPD) activity will assist oncology nurses, nurse practitioners and clinical nurse specialists with the formulation of state-of-the-art clinical management strategies to facilitate optimal care of patients with prostate cancer.\n\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\n\nApply existing and emerging research data in the therapeutic and supportive care of patients with early and advanced PC.\n\nEvaluate the published research database supporting the recent FDA approvals of secondary hormonal agents in the management of nonmetastatic castration-resistant PC, and apply this information in the discussion of nonresearch treatment options with patients.\n\nCounsel patients with hormone-sensitive metastatic PC regarding the use of cytotoxic and secondary hormonal therapy to ensure appropriate and informed shared decision-making.\n\nRecognize how prior therapeutic exposure and patient and disease characteristics factor into the selection and sequencing of available systemic treatments for metastatic castration-resistant PC.\n\nEducate patients about the side effects associated with approved therapies commonly employed in the management of advanced PC, and provide preventive strategies to reduce or ameliorate these toxicities.\n\nIdentify opportunities to enhance the collaborative role of oncology nurses in the comprehensive biopsychosocial care of patients with PC to optimize clinical and quality-of-life outcomes.\n\nCONTACT INFORMATION\n\nIf you have questions regarding credit, please contact cpdsupport@usf.edu.\n\nACCREDITATION STATEMENT\n\nUSF Health is accredited as a provider of nursing continuing professional development by the American Nurses Credentialing Center’s (ANCC) Commission on Accreditation.\n\nCME credit is no longer available for this issue\n\nONCC/ILNA CERTIFICATION INFORMATION\n\nCME credit is no longer available for this issue\n\nFOR SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION\n\nAudio Program: This CNE activity consists of an audio component.\n\nCNE credit is no longer available for this issue\n\nVideo Program: This CNE activity consists of a video component.\n\nCNE credit is no longer available for this issue\n\nCONTENT VALIDATION AND DISCLOSURES\n\nUSF Health adheres to ACCME and ANCC standards regarding commercial support of continuing medical education.
