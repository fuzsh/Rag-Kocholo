        "text": "Cell Free DNA (cfDNA) Testing Market\n\n\"The new report published by The Business Research Company, titled \"\"Cell Free DNA (cfDNA) Testing Global Market Report 2024 - Market Size, Trends, And Global Forecast 2024-2033\"\", delivers an in-depth analysis of the leading size and forecasts, investment opportunities, winning strategies, market drivers and trends, competitive landscape, and evolving market trends.\n\nAs per the report, the cell free DNA (cfDNA) testing market size has grown exponentially in recent years. It will grow from $7.07 billion in 2023 to $8.74 billion in 2024 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.6%. The cell free DNA (cfDNA) testing market size is expected to see exponential growth in the next few years. It will grow to $20.63 billion in 2028 at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 23.9%.\n\nDownload Free Sample Report @\n\nhttps://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/sample.aspx?id=15757&type=smp\n\nImpact Of Rising Cancer Prevalence On The Cell-Free DNA (cfDNA) Testing Market\n\nThe rising prevalence of cancer is expected to propel the growth of the cell-free DNA (cfDNA) testing market going forward. Cancer is a complex group of diseases characterized by the uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells in the body. These cells can invade and destroy normal tissue and, if not controlled, can significantly harm the body. The prevalence of cancer is due to aging populations, shifts in lifestyle, environmental influences, and advancements in detection and diagnostic techniques. cfDNA testing detects genetic mutations associated with cancer at an early stage, often before symptoms appear. This allows for early intervention, improving patient outcomes and survival rates by identifying cancer in its initial stages. For instance, in February 2024, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), a Switzerland-based intergovernmental organization, there are expected to be over 35 million new cases of cancer in 2050, a 77% increase over the projected 20 million cases in 2022. Therefore, the rising prevalence of cancer is driving the growth of the cell-free DNA (cfDNA) testing market.\n\nLabcorp Launches An Advanced Liquid Biopsy Test For Precision Oncology\n\nMajor companies operating in the cell-free DNA (cfDNA) testing market focus on developing innovative technologies, such as liquid biopsy tests that offer greater sensitivity, specificity, and efficiency in detecting cancer-related mutations and genetic alterations. Liquid biopsy tests refer to diagnostic procedures that allow oncologists to evaluate circulating cell-free DNA released by tumor cells, facilitating personalized, targeted therapy plans. For instance, in May 2023, Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (Labcorp), a US-based life sciences company, launched Labcorp Plasma Focus, a new liquid biopsy test designed for patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. This test evaluates circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) released by tumor cells from a standard blood draw, making it minimally invasive and providing fast results. It enhances access to precision oncology by identifying clinically actionable biomarkers across several common cancers, such as non-small cell lung, colorectal, breast, esophageal, gastroesophageal junction, gastric cancers, and melanoma.\n\nThe cell free DNA (cfDNA) testing market covered in this report is segmented -\n\n1) By Product: Donor-Derived Cell-Free DNA, Circulating Cell-Free Tumor DNA, Cell-Free Fetal DNA\n\n2) By Platforms: Next Generation Sequencing (NGS), rPCR And Multiplexed PCR, qPCR And dPCR, Other platforms\n\n3) By Application: Oncology, Non-Invasive Prenatal Test (NIPT), Gynecology, Transplantation, Other Applications\n\nBuy Now & Get Exclusive Discount on this Report, Checkout link @\n\nhttps://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/Discount?id=15757&type=discount\n\nMajor companies operating in the cell free DNA (cfDNA) testing market are F.
