        "text": "<strong>Managed</strong> <strong>Security</strong> <strong>Services</strong> <strong>Overview</strong> As companies continue to enlist the Internet to expedite business processes, the incurred security risk grows in accordance. Today, many organisations provide network access to partners, suppliers, customers and mobile employees fostering opportunities for people with ill intent. Although these organisations may establish strong perimeter security, it is only a first line of defence. Bottom Line For an organisation to effectively safeguard critical information, it takes more than integrating the latest security hardware and software. A complete security program including around-the-clock management and monitoring, real-time security intelligence, global infrastructure and a staff of 24 hours a day 7days a week (24x&) security experts are key elements for keepingpace with today’s increasingly complex network security threats.
