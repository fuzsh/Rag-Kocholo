        "text": "07 January 2002\n\nAcquisition Expands VeriSign’s Illuminet Portfolio of Telecommunication Services by Adding End-to-End Billing and CRM Applications for Wireless Carriers\n\nMountain View, Ca., January 7, 2002 – VeriSign, Inc., (NASDAQ: VRSN), the leading provider of digital trust services, today announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire H.O. Systems, Inc., a leading provider of billing and customer care solutions to wireless carriers. H.O. Systems’ advanced billing platform combined with the signaling, intelligent network and clearing services of VeriSign’s Illuminet Holdings, Inc. subsidiary will give wireless carriers a comprehensive package of essential services needed to succeed and grow in a highly competitive marketplace.\n\nH.O. Systems’ core product, speedSUITE, is a highly flexible, integrated, end-to-end billing and Customer Relationship Management service designed to assist wireless carriers by targeting and supporting each stage of the subscriber cycle from initiation through retention. The functionality of speedSUITE supports current 2G and 2.5G service offerings and lays the groundwork for the introduction of next generation (3G+) services. H.O. Systems has numerous independent wireless carrier customers, including affiliates of AT&T.\n\nH.O. Systems’ billing and CRM services complement Illuminet, which operates the largest independent SS7 network in North America, providing signaling, intelligent network and clearing services to more than 900 carrier customers in 23 countries. Illuminet’s network enables call control across carrier networks and delivery of other essential telecommunications services such as seamless roaming, fraud management, toll-free database services, calling name and local number portability. Illuminet also provides roaming and real-time account management for prepaid wireless service, and a host of OSS interconnection and network management services.\n\n“As demand for wireless communications grows, so does the need for services that combine the wireless voice and data and billing functions. The combination of Illuminet’s services and trusted expertise with H.O. Systems’ wireless billing and real-time provisioning systems creates a powerful offering for wireless carriers,” said Terry Kremian, Executive Vice President and General Manager of Illuminet.\n\n“The blending of our cultures and technologies creates a powerhouse in the wireless market,” said Hart Williford, President, H. O. Systems, Inc. “Our combined product vision will accelerate our capabilities to serve our clients with state-of-the-art mobile Internet and m-commerce solutions.”\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, VeriSign will pay approximately $340 million in stock and cash for the stock of H.O. Systems. This acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase transaction and is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2002. VeriSign expects the acquisition to be neutral to slightly accretive to its fiscal 2002 earnings. VeriSign will offer revenue guidance upon closing of the acquisition. The acquisition has been approved by the board of directors of each company and is subject to various closing conditions, including approval under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.\n\nIn addition to immediately augmenting Illuminet’s wireless services portfolio, H.O. Systems adds several opportunities for synergies including expansion of VeriSign’s payments gateway by combining VeriSign’s payments gateway with H.O. Systems’ speedBILL electronic bill payment infrastructure for wireless carriers. VeriSign’s payment platform already services more than 56,000 merchants.\n\nFounded in 1988, H.O. Systems has approximately 300 employees based primarily in Savannah. Williford leads an experienced team that includes approximately 170 product developers and programmers.\n\nAdditional information on H.O. Systems is available at www.hosystems.com.\n\nAbout H.O.
