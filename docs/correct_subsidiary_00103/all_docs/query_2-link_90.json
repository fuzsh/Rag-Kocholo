        "text": "SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT (publ. 05/31/07)\n\nAn article about Stratton Sclavos leaving VeriSign included incorrect biographical information. Sclavos, 46, joined VeriSign as its first chief executive months after it spun off from RSA, but was not one of the founders.\n\nStratton Sclavos, founder and chief executive of VeriSign, resigned Tuesday in a surprise management shake-up that left more questions asked than it answered.\n\nThe Mountain View Internet infrastructure provider was vague about the reasons for the departure, which comes in the wake of an internal investigation into stock-option granting practices that may cost VeriSign $250 million.\n\n“I am proud of my role in building VeriSign into the great company it has become, and wish all of my associates the very best in the coming years,” Sclavos said in a statement released by the company.\n\nTwo board members will take over executive management of VeriSign, the largest of the companies that manage Internet domain names. Bill Roper, formerly a lead independent director at VeriSign, will serve as president and CEO, and former Williams-Sonoma CEO Edward Mueller will become chairman.\n\nAn evasive conference call with financial analysts Tuesday left Wall Street puzzled as to why Sclavos, who has led VeriSign since it spun off from RSA in 1995, walked out, and whether he did so willingly.\n\n“It remains unclear as to what necessitated the change at the top,” Stifel Nicolaus analyst Todd Weller wrote in a research note released Tuesday.\n\nVeriSign declined to comment beyond the analyst call and statements from Sclavos and the new executives. Sclavos could not be reached for comment.\n\nSclavos presided over VeriSign’s rocket rise during the dot-com boom, annual losses of as much as $13.4 billion during the bust, and recovery during the past few years that drove its stock price from the single digits to the mid-$30s.\n\n“VeriSign’s former CEO was viewed as being a visionary, and we believe that Mr. Sclavos deserves a lot of credit for taking VeriSign where it is today,” Weller wrote. “At the same time, we believe there are a fair amount of investors that question whether many of the visionary moves resulted in material growth.”\n\nThe company paid $21 billion to buy domain-name company Network Solutions in 2000, then split the business and sold part of it to a private equity firm in 2003 for $100 million, retaining a 15 percent stake.\n\nSome analysts predicted VeriSign’s new executives might sell off other business units, or even the entire company, to a large technology business or telecommunications carrier such as AT&T or Sprint.\n\n“Sclavos, as a founder/CEO, may have been perceived as an obstacle to a potential sale of the company, which would be a potentially attractive target,” Merrill Lynch analyst Edward Maguire wrote in a research note.\n\nDuring the conference call, though, Roper and Mueller stressed that VeriSign’s current strategy would remain in place.\n\n“I don’t think you should expect dramatic changes,” Roper said. “We’re going to emphasize managerial discipline in business processes and cost controls.”\n\nA San Francisco native and lifelong Bay Area resident, Sclavos, 45, has strong ties to the community as a philanthropist in education and medicine, part owner of the San Jose Sharks hockey team and proprietor of the Greek restaurant Dio Deka in Los Gatos, which opened in November.\n\nYet VeriSign has struggled with the stock-option backdating scandal that has roiled much of Silicon Valley.\n\nIn November, the company said an internal investigation into option-granting practices from 2001 to 2005 revealed misdated options, and estimated the cost to the company at about $250 million. Although VeriSign said it would finish the review by the end of 2006, it has yet to be released. The company said Tuesday that the investigation was “substantially completed” and it “did not find intentional wrongdoing by any current member of senior management, including Sclavos.”\n\nHis web of connections also link him to several of the worst backdating offenders. Sclavos sits on the board of Juniper Networks, which determined that it had overstated its earnings by nearly $900 million due to options backdating. His Sharks co-investor Greg Reyes, former CEO of Brocade Communications Systems, was charged with securities fraud over backdating. And Sclavos also sits on the board of Intuit, which was subpoenaed by federal prosecutors over its stock-option granting practices.\n\nRoper, the new CEO, was most recently an executive vice president and chief financial officer of government contractor Science Applications International Corp., or SAIC, based in Washington, D.C. During the late 1990s, he helped manage Network Solutions, then a subsidiary of SAIC.\n\nVeriSign’s stock price rose 69 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $27.94 during market hours Tuesday, but fell 22 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $27.73 after the market closed."
