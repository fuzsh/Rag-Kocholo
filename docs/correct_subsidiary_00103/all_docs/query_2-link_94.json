        "text": "MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- VeriSign, Inc. (NASDAQ: VRSN), the leading provider of digital infrastructure for the networked world, today announced that the board of directors has elected D. James Bidzos to become chairman, replacing Edward A. Mueller who has resigned after his recent selection as the chairman and CEO of Qwest Communications International.\n\nBidzos is an Internet and security industry pioneer whose accomplishments include building RSA Security into the early standard-bearer for authentication and encryption and launching VeriSign as a company in 1995 to develop the digital certificate infrastructure for Internet commerce. Bidzos has been named one of Time Magazine's \"Digital 50\" and is in CRN's “Computer Industry Hall of Fame\".\n\n\"It was Jim’s vision that launched VeriSign over a decade ago, and his leadership and experience make him the ideal person to take over as our new chairman,\" said Bill Roper, president and chief executive officer of VeriSign. \"Jim has already made significant contributions to VeriSign and to the industry, and we look forward to partnering with him as we bring more focus and discipline to VeriSign's future.”"
