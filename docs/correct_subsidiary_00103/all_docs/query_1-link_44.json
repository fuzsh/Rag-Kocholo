        "text": "Target Audience\n\nThis program is intended for medical oncologists, hematology-oncology fellows and other allied healthcare professionals involved in the treatment of gastrointestinal cancers.\n\nLearning Objectives\n\nDevelop a long-term care plan for individuals diagnosed with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), considering the patient’s biomarker profile (BRAF, MSI, HER2), tumor location, prior systemic therapy, symptomatology, performance status and personal goals of treatment.\n\nAppreciate published research data documenting the efficacy of combined BRAF/MEK/EGFR inhibition for patients with relapsed/refractory CRC and a BRAF-V600E mutation to optimally incorporate this therapeutic strategy into current clinical algorithms.\n\nUse HER2 status, PD-L1 combined positive score, clinical factors and patient preferences to personalize the selection and sequence of systemic therapy for patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastric/gastroesophageal cancer.\n\nRecall the biologic rationale for and available data with the use of trastuzumab deruxtecan for patients with previously treated HER2-positive CRC or gastric/gastroesophageal cancers, and discern the current and potential future clinical applicability of this treatment strategy.\n\nRecall the FDA approvals of anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies for microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) mCRC, and appropriately integrate these agents into current treatment algorithms.\n\nDescribe ongoing research to validate the potential benefit of immune checkpoint inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy, targeted therapy or other immunotherapies for patients with MSI-H/dMMR and MSI-stable mCRC, and use this information to guide trial design and referral.\n\nDevise a rational approach to the incorporation of TAS-102 into the treatment algorithms for previously treated locally advanced or mCRC or gastric/gastroesophageal cancers.\n\nRecall new data with investigational agents demonstrating promising activity in gastrointestinal cancers, and use this information to refer appropriate patients for participation in ongoing trials.\n\nCME Credit Form\n\nCME and ABIM MOC credit form links will be emailed to each participant within 5 days of the activity.\n\nAccreditation Statement\n\nResearch To Practice is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to provide continuing medical education for physicians.\n\nCredit Designation Statement\n\nResearch To Practice designates this live activity for a maximum of 1.5 AMA PRA Category 1 CreditsTM. Physicians should claim only the credit commensurate with the extent of their participation in the activity.\n\nAmerican Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) — Maintenance of Certification (MOC)\n\nSuccessful completion of this CME activity, which includes participation in the evaluation component, enables the participant to earn up to 1.5 Medical Knowledge MOC points in the American Board of Internal Medicine’s (ABIM) Maintenance of Certification (MOC) program. Participants will earn MOC points equivalent to the amount of CME credits claimed for the activity. It is the CME activity provider’s responsibility to submit participant completion information to ACCME for the purpose of granting ABIM MOC credit.\n\nPlease note, this program has been specifically designed for the following ABIM specialty: medical oncology.\n\nPersonal information and data sharing: Research To Practice aggregates deidentified user data for program-use analysis, program development, activity planning and site improvement. We may provide aggregate and deidentified data to third parties, including commercial supporters. We do not share or sell personally identifiable information to any unaffiliated third parties or commercial supporters.
