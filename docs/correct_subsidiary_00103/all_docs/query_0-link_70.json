        "text": "Another Promising Foundstone Spin-Off: Special Ops Security, Inc.\n\nI previously blogged how fellow ex-Foundstoners Kevin Mandia launched Red Cliff Consulting and Clinton Mugge started C-Level Security. I just learned that my friend Erik Birkholz, author of the excellent Special Ops Security book, started his own company: Special Ops Security, Inc. His press release contains the following:\n\n\"Specialized security firms Foundstone, @Stake and Guardent were acquired in late 2004 by large, product-only vendors McAfee, Symantec, and VeriSign, creating a void for highly customer-focused security players in the industry. Special Ops Security meets that growing demand for specialized information security knowledge by blending consulting, training and technology into a new hybrid breed of educational solutions for our customers. With the combined talent of Erik Pace Birkholz, Steven Andrés, and Chip Andrews, the company, with a unique all-CISSP certified management team, is committed to delivering tactical and strategic solutions that optimize the people, processes and technology that protect customer data.\"\n\nI think Erik has a point. If a customer goes to McAfee, Symantec, or Verisign for security consulting, they will end up with a pitch for each company's products or services. In world where best-of-breed security solutions tend to not all come from a single vendor, I think it is useful to have independent security consultants with a view of the \"big picture.\"\n\nThe Special Ops books page also mentions three future books on \"Tactical Host And Network Security,\" \"Strategic Security,\" and \"Operational Host And Network Security.\" Good luck Special Ops team! If I need to contact you, I'll be sure to call your number: 888-R-U-OWNED (for real).\n\nZeek in Action Videos\n\nThis is a quick note to point blog readers to my Zeek in Action YouTube video series for the Zeek network security monitoring project . Each video addresses a topic that I think might be of interest to people trying to understand their network using Zeek and adjacent tools and approaches, like Suricata, Wireshark, and so on. I am especially pleased with Video 6 on monitoring wireless networks . It took me several weeks to research material for this video. I had to buy new hardware and experiment with a Linux distro that I had not used before -- Parrot . Please like and subscribe, and let me know if there is a topic you think might make a good video.\n\nMITRE ATT&CK Tactics Are Not Tactics\n\nJust what are \"tactics\"? Introduction MITRE ATT&CK is a great resource, but something about it has bothered me since I first heard about it several years ago. It's a minor point, but I wanted to document it in case it confuses anyone else. The MITRE ATT&CK Design and Philosophy document from March 2020 says the following: At a high-level, ATT&CK is a behavioral model that consists of the following core components: • Tactics, denoting short-term, tactical adversary goals during an attack; • Techniques, describing the means by which adversaries achieve tactical goals; • Sub-techniques, describing more specific means by which adversaries achieve tactical goals at a lower level than techniques; and • Documented adversary usage of techniques, their procedures, and other metadata. My concern is with MITRE's definition of \"tactics\" as \"short-term, tactical adversary goals during an attack,\" which is oddly recursive. The key word in the tacti\n\nNew Book! The Best of TaoSecurity Blog, Volume 4\n\nI've completed the TaoSecurity Blog book series . The new book is The Best of TaoSecurity Blog, Volume 4: Beyond the Blog with Articles, Testimony, and Scholarship . It's available now for Kindle , and I'm working on the print edition. I'm running a 50% off promo on Volumes 1-3 on Kindle through midnight 20 April. Take advantage before the prices go back up. I described the new title thus: Go beyond TaoSecurity Blog with this new volume from author Richard Bejtlich. In the first three volumes of the series, Mr. Bejtlich selected and republished the very best entries from 18 years of writing and over 18 million blog views, along with commentaries and additional material. In this title, Mr. Bejtlich collects material that has not been published elsewhere, including articles that are no longer available or are stored in assorted digital or physical archives. Volume 4 offers early white papers that Mr. Bejtlich wrote as a network defender, either for technical or pol"
