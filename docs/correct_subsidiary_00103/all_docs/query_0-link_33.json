        "text": "Computer security is one of the most complex challenges facing large enterprises today. Securing a multinational enterprise is a balancing act based on solid risk management and technical solutions in a multifaceted, changing environment. Managing risks without securing the enterprise is meaningless, but is there a one-size-fits-all solution or special technology to secure the organization? Will this solution or technology be cost-effective? What about the intersection between IT security, physical security, and information security? Ultimately, tackling computer security within a large enterprise is more than a technical problem; it must be based on people, process, and technology in order to properly manage risks associated with threats.\n\nJerry Brady, Executive Director, is the Global Head of IT Security for Morgan Stanley, responsible for IT Security Strategy, Consulting and Assurances, Security Solutions, and Service Delivery.\n\nMr. Brady has previously been Chief Technology Officer for Guardent, a security services firm later acquired by VeriSign, managed the Security Management Applications business unit and Emerging Technologies for Internet Security Systems, and was VP of Engineering for CertCo (A Bankers Trust Spin-off).\n\nMr. Brady has also held several management roles in financial services firms including Bankers Trust, JP Morgan, and Touche Ross, and as Chief Security Officer for Prudential, responsible for the company wide Information Security program for all divisions."
