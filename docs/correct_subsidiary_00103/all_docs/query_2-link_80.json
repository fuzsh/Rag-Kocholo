        "text": "VeriSign, Inc.., the trusted provider of Internet infrastructure services for the networked world, recently announced that Yahoo! Shopping merchants can now enhance their listings so that shoppers can more easily identify which merchants have safeguarded their sites and whose identities have been verified by VeriSign.\n\nNow available on Yahoo! Shopping, the VeriSign Verified™ Seal for Comparison Shopping identifies merchants who secure their site with a VeriSign® Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) Certificate. Because they've deployed VeriSign SSL protection, these merchants can choose to have a VeriSign Verified Seal appear in connection with their listings on Yahoo! Shopping, the most popular online comparison shopping engine (comScore, September 2008). The seal helps merchants indicate to consumers that VeriSign has verified the identity of the merchant and that the merchant owns or has a right to use the website to do business, and that the Web site is secured with a VeriSign SSL certificate. As 85 percent of online shoppers will turn to online tools to find bargains this holiday season,1 the VeriSign Verified Seal for Comparison Shopping is another tool to help merchants help customers feel confident when they shop online.\n\n\"The driving focus of Yahoo! Shopping is to provide people with an efficient way of finding the best products at the best prices online,\" said Greg Hintz, General Manager, Yahoo! Shopping. \"By displaying the VeriSign Verified Seal for Comparison Shopping, we want to make sure our users have everything they need to make an informed purchase. This new feature delivers a valuable service to our merchants and online shoppers alike, as we all prepare for another busy season of online holiday shopping.\"\n\nFor merchants looking to maximize sales this holiday season, VeriSign is offering a 90-day free trial of the new VeriSign Verified Seal for Comparison Shopping service to Yahoo! Shopping merchants who own a VeriSign SSL Certificate.\n\nMore than 15 online businesses large and small and across a wide range industries have already adopted the VeriSign Verified Seal for Comparison Shopping. Companies include Brookstone.com, Ghirardelli.com, GreenMountainCoffee.com, Wakeside.com and FragranceX.com.\n\n\"The VeriSign brand is one of the most trusted brands on the Internet, and I like to think of it as my virtual hand shake to let potential customers know it's safe to shop with me,\" said John Lucey, Internet Marketing Manager for Brookstone.com. \"With the new VeriSign Verified Seal for Comparison Shopping, I can attract perusers not only looking for a good deal, but also looking to buy from someone they can trust.\"\n\nAccording to TNS research, 65 percent of consumers shop only at sites they know and trust, and 65 percent of online shoppers have abandoned a shopping cart because they did not \"trust\" the transaction. With the VeriSign Verified Seal, merchants can stand out to customers as a more trustworthy site at the point when they are choosing between multiple vendors. Within the Yahoo! Shopping search results, merchants can help show potential customers that their business is legitimate and that customers can trust that their transactions will be secure. With the VeriSign Verified Seal, merchants can stand out to customers as a trustworthy site at the point when they are choosing between multiple vendors.\n\n\"It's getting increasingly difficult for retailers to stake out some kind of differentiation online, particularly when they first appear to shoppers as one of several merchants in a list,\" said Michael Lin, vice president of SSL product management at VeriSign. \"That makes the VeriSign Verified Seal such an important tool for Yahoo! Shopping merchants. Now merchants who protect their sites with VeriSign SSL Certificates don't have to wait for shoppers to click through to their site to learn they are secure. From the moment a merchant's name appears in a search, they can reassure users of a trusted shopping experience.\"\n\nVeriSign is the most respected and trusted SSL authority on the Web. More than 95 percent of the Fortune 500 – and the world's 40 largest banks – rely on SSL Certificates sold by VeriSign (including VeriSign's subsidiaries, affiliates and resellers) to meet their security needs.
