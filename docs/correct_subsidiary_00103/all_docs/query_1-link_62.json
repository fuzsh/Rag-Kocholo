        "text": "Hong Kong-based Codex Genetics has announced an exclusive collaboration with Guardant Health Asia, Middle East and Africa (AMEA) to offer comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) tests to hospitals and clinics in Hong Kong and Macau. Guardant Health AMEA is a wholly owned subsidiary of US-based Guardant Health, Inc.\n\nAs part of the collaboration, Guardant Health's tests such as Guardant360, Guardant Reveal, Guardant360 TissueNext and Guardant360 Response are now available through Codex Genetics to advance clinical adoption of CGP testing in Hong Kong and Macau.\n\nThe tests provided by Guardant Health aim to transform cancer care at all stages of the disease with Guardant Reveal for residual disease and recurrence monitoring in patients with early-stage colorectal cancer and Guardant360 and Guardant360 TissueNext for guiding treatment decisions in patients with advanced solid cancers.\n\nGuardant360 CDx is the first US FDA-approved comprehensive liquid biopsy which can provide tumor mutation profiling for all solid cancers. According to Guardant Health, the Guardant360 liquid biopsy test has been ordered by more than 12,000 oncologists globally, with 300,000 tests performed to date."
