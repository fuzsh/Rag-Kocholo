We bring this perspective, our experience and the right amount of capital to help you succeed.\n\nWhen we were building our own entrepreneurial companies, we found that it was often our independent board members, not the VC board members, who contributed the most value. Invariably, it was the independent board members who had the deep experience and strong operational networksâ€”and who had been in our shoes. At .406, we aim to bring these qualities, in addition to capital, to every one of our portfolio companies. It is our goal to be the most valuable member on your board. We love what we do and have fun doing it!"
