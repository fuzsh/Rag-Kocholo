It has all sort of verified labels - almost too many of them. I got suspicious that this website was supposed to be in Geneva, yet the prices were in € and also it seamed to be in several other countries (found through google, not linked together one the site), South Africa and Greece, the exactly the same prices and exactly the same products. When I went to the sign up there was no httpS so I canceled and decided for the first time to make a lookup on VeriSign for this shops. It took ages to find it, I got all sorts of pages how to detect a scam, did a scam test, got endless of pop ups in new windows, learned all about their nice green bar (which I couldn't find where to download) but finally I made it to the point where I could put in the url and run it through.\n\nAnd the result was that VeriSign does not have this company registered.\n\nSo I thought the right thing to do was to report it. Again started too long search for a report button, a search that ended by 4 links of scam-reporting sites. And frankly, I'm just out of time for this now.\n\nDoes VeriSign really not want to know if someone is using their precious \"You can trust us\" logo without being their customer?\n\nHi Begga,\n\nVerisign are just one of the certificate authorties that supply certificates for SSL (HTTPS) for web sites, and as KB88111 says anyone who's willing to pay can get a basic certificate.\n\nHowever there are more tightly controlled types of certificate that aren't so freely available. With these, the certificate authority performs more in-depth checks to confirm the identity of the company requesting the certificate. In modern web browsers these certificates should cause all or part of the address bar to turn green.\n\nAnother thing you can do to check out a website is lookup details of the domain names registered owner. You can do this on whois.sc, although it's worth remembering that the registrars don't often take steps to verify that the info you see here is correct (one notable exception is the .us TLD).\n\nOverall though, I'd say the golden rule is \"if it looks too good to be true, it probably is!\"\n\nHope this helps, and hopefully see you at the curry night this week\n\nNot quite. Verisign couldn't possibly assure you that there's no virus in the download.\n\nSSL, as indicated by the HTTPS:// portion of a URL provides two major services:\n\n1. Authentication : That the server you're talking to is who it says it is.\n\n2. Transport Layer Encryption : That communications between you and the server are encrypted and uninterrupted (i.e. no man-in-the-middle can eavesdrop).\n\nNow anybody can go and buy a certificate but Verisign are pretty damn good at point 1. They insist on a VAT number, a listing of the company in some public record and they call the phone number listed against that public record to verify that the company exists and that the requestor is authorised to act on behalf of the company. But that's where it ends; As you correctly point out, the company's business practices are not the business of Verisign - their certificates just provide a reasonable level of authentication.\n\nPart 2 works well but is also often misunderstood. The content could be a virus. That virus will be encrypted as it traverses the untrusted network (the internet), but when it reaches you and is decrypted its still a virus.\n\nThe other misunderstood part is that only the connection is covered by point 2. Once the data reaches the end server it is decrypted and its no longer an SSL problem. It can sit on a USB stick unencrypted for all you know, or be forwarded straight to a printer in the middle of an open plan office.\n\nSSL is very good technology. The biggest failing is that its intricacies are not well understood by 99% of its consumers. Companies like Verisign and those developing web browsers tell people that the an HTTPS connection is secure, but they don't do a good enough job of telling people what secure means in this context.\n\nSorry for nerding the whole place up"
