        "text": "To select the best treatment, doctors and patients must have access to detailed genomic information about the disease. But this information is not easy to obtain. Traditional tissue biopsies require physical access to tumor tissue and come with serious risks for some patients. And for many patients, they aren’t even an option.\n\nWe believe the key to conquering cancer is unprecedented access to its molecular information throughout all stages of the disease. We are developing a solution through tests that require only a blood sample.\n\nToday, Guardant’s blood tests are enabling timely therapy selection for patients with cancer while we also advance programs for recurrence detection and early cancer detection. In addition, we are working together with pharmaceutical companies to discover and understand new treatment approaches that lead to better outcomes for patients.\n\nCancer affects millions, but at Guardant Health AMEA, you will focus on the individual and be asked to imagine each patient as a member of your own family.\n\nYou will work with a mix of top scientists, engineers, clinicians, commercial experts, reimbursement specialists, and many more talented individuals.\n\nWhen you join us, you become an integral part of the team, contributing your unique skills and talents to solve some of the most challenging and complex problems in healthcare.\n\nWe prioritize our people and provide rewarding careers for the intellectually curious and unabashedly determined. Are you ready to make a difference?"
