        "text": "By LAWRENCE M. FISHER\n\nAN FRANCISCO -- In the costliest acquisition of an Internet company to date, VeriSign Inc., a producer of online security software, agreed to acquire Network Solutions Inc., the Virginia-based company that maintains the master list of Internet addresses.\n\nA company that has lost its monopoly still fetches a huge price.\n\nVeriSign valued the deal, a stock swap, at $21 billion, although a drop in its share price took it down to $17 billion -- still a high premium for a company with 1999 earnings of $26.9 million on sales of $220.8 million. The deal rivals Lucent Technologies Inc.'s $20 billion acquisition of Ascend Communications Inc. in January 1999 as the biggest high-tech acquisition ever. The major difference is that Ascend had $1.6 billion in sales in the previous year.\n\nAnalysts said the price was all the more astonishing because Network Solutions no longer enjoys a monopoly in the registration of domain names, as Internet addresses are known, and will see growing competition in the years to come.\n\nThe merger also constrains VeriSign's ability to form partnerships or strategic alliances with a generation of companies that now compete with Network Solutions in registering domain names, analysts said.\n\nSuch concerns drove VeriSign shares down $47.4375 to close at $200, in Nasdaq trading. Network Solutions shares soared, closing at $407.3906, up $46.7656, to make it the biggest gainer on the Nasdaq.\n\n\"The combination of these two companies makes sense,\" said Charles Rutstein, an analyst with Forrester Research. \"The cross-selling and up-selling opportunities are evident to most observers.\"\n\nBut he added: \"What's a bit confusing is why VeriSign needed to own this company as opposed to being a marketing partner. The two have done business together before. At the end of the day, you have to wonder whether $21 billion was too much.\"\n\nInternet Governance\n\nArticles\n\nOngoing Coverage of Internet Governance\n\nUnder the agreement, VeriSign, whose software keeps sensitive information safe when people buy and sell things on the Internet, will issue 2.15 shares of VeriSign common stock for each share of Network Solutions stock, as constituted before a 2-for-1 split of Network Solutions stock on March 10. Verisign had earnings of $4 million on revenues of $84.8 million in 1999.\n\nThe companies said that by combining they would be able to offer services including domain registration, global directory listings, basic Web site creation and secure processing of online transactions.\n\nStratton Sclavos, VeriSign's president and chief executive, called Network Solutions \"one of the most undervalued assets on the Internet by any of the standard metrics -- number of customers, type of business model, revenue growth, profitability, cash flow.\"\n\nAnalysts said there were regulatory issues and competitive pressures that made the outcome of the merger difficult to predict.\n\nIn 1998, the Commerce Department created Internet Corp. for Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann, to end Network Solutions' monopoly and open up the registration of Internet addresses to competition. Tuesday, at an Icann meeting in Cairo, people were caught off guard by the announcement.\n\n\"It's a real eye-opener,\" said Ken Stubbs, who runs a nonprofit group that now competes with Network Solutions. But he said he was not concerned about its impact on his group. \"I think I'll register more names tomorrow than today,\" he said.\n\nFounded in 1979, Network Solutions pioneered the registering of Web addresses ending in .com, .net, .org and .edu. It is the world's leading registrar with more than 8.1 million domain registrations. It also offers so-called registry services, meaning that it maintains the InterNIC database, the telephone directory of the Internet. Network Solutions' registry customers include all the new competing companies that register domains ending in .com, .net and .org."
