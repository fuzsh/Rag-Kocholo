        "text": "The reimbursement expands access to blood-based comprehensive genomic profiling with Guardant360 CDx for patients with advanced solid tumor cancers and their care teams across Japan.\n\nTOKYO, August 3, 2023 – Guardant Health, Inc. (Nasdaq: GH), a leading precision oncology company, announces it has recently received national reimbursement approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) for the Guardant360® CDx liquid biopsy test for comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) for patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. This approval is effective July 24, 2023, and follows the regulatory approval of the Guardant360 CDx test for CGP by the MHLW in March 2022.\n\nSRL Corporation, which offers clinical laboratory testing, has begun accepting orders for the test.\n\nThere were over one million new cancer cases in Japan in 2020 with lung, stomach, prostate, colon and breast being the most prevalent cancer types.1 The Guardant360 CDx test analyzes circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to provide comprehensive genomic profiling, or tumor mutation profiling, for all solid tumors. It is used by healthcare professionals to detect actionable biomarkers from the tumors that are released in the patients’ blood that may help inform their therapy selection.\n\nCurrently, Guardant360 CDx is approved by the MHLW as a companion diagnostic to identify patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-High) solid tumors who may benefit from Keytruda® (pembrolizumab) and patients with MSI-High advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) who may benefit from Opdivo® (nivolumab). The MHLW also granted regulatory approval of Guardant360 CDx as a companion diagnostic for identifying patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who may benefit from treatment with LUMAKRAS™ (sotorasib).\n\n“We are very pleased that we can start providing our CGP test Guardant360® CDx. The test provides meaningful information that can help inform treatment for patients with advanced cancer, particularly when it is difficult to perform tests on solid tumor samples”, said Guardant’s CEO Asia, Middle East and Africa, Mr. Simranjit Singh.\n\n“Our mission is to conquer cancer by making full use of data, and we will do our utmost to make a positive impact on patients and their families as we aim to further advance personalized medicine in cancer treatment through the use of CGP.”\n\nThe test offers oncologists and healthcare specialists the opportunity to move beyond the limitations of tissue biopsies to rapidly obtain clinically relevant information in time to match patients to the optimal personalized treatment, informing treatment decisions in patients with advanced-stage disease.\n\nThe Guardant360 CDx test was the first blood test to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for comprehensive genomic profiling for all solid tumors, and it is now FDA approved as a companion diagnostic test for four targeted therapies in NSCLC and one in advanced breast cancer. Guardant360 CDx is also CE-Marked and approved by Singapore’s HSA for comprehensive genomic profiling for all solid tumors. Since being introduced as a laboratory developed test (LDT), the Guardant360 liquid biopsy has become widely accepted for blood-based CGP with more than 400 peer-reviewed publications.\n\nThe approval for reimbursement with the Japanese healthcare system represents a positive step for innovation and precision oncology by the MHLW and will lead to improved treatment and diagnosis for patients.\n\nAbout Guardant Health Japan\n\nGuardant Health Japan is part of Guardant Health AMEA, a wholly owned subsidiary of Guardant Health, Inc., a leading precision oncology company focused on helping conquer cancer globally through use of its proprietary blood tests, vast data sets and advanced analytics.
