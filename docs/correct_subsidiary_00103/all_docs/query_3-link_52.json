        "text": "DUBLIN, March 1, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The \"Next Generation Sequencing Services Market by Type (Targeted, RNA, De Novo, WES, WGS), Technology (Sequencing by Synthesis, Ion Semiconductor, SMRT, Nanopore), Application (Research, Clinical [Oncology, Reproductive]), End User - Global Forecast to 2030\" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The next generation sequencing services market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 19.9% from 2023 to 2030 to reach $20.39 billion by 2030 The growth of this market is mainly attributed to the reduced cost of NGS procedures, the development and approval of new targeted therapies, the rising prevalence of cancer, partnerships between NGS service providers and pharmaceutical companies, the high cost of sequencing infrastructure, and technological advancements in NGS. In addition, advancements in sequencing data analytics and the increasing applications of NGS in cancer and agri-genomics research are expected to offer significant growth opportunities for NGS service providers. However, the availability of alternative technologies, lack of skilled professionals for sample preparation and analysis, and actionable mutations for precision medicine may restrain the growth of the NGS services market. Moreover, regulatory & standardization concerns in diagnostic testing and the ethical issues & costs related to non-invasive prenatal genetic testing are major challenges to the growth of this market. Based on type, the global NGS services market is segmented into targeted sequencing services, whole-genome sequencing services, RNA sequencing services, exome sequencing services, de novo sequencing services, ChIP sequencing services, methyl sequencing services, and other NGS services. In 2023, the targeted sequencing services segment is estimated to account for the largest share of the global NGS services market. The large share of this segment can be attributed to the relatively lower cost, faster turnaround time, and accurate, easy-to-interpret results of targeted sequencing in the study of disease-related genes. Based on technology, the global NGS services market is segmented into sequencing by synthesis, ion semiconductor sequencing, single-molecule real-time sequencing, nanopore sequencing, and DNA nanoball sequencing. In 2023, the sequencing by synthesis segment is estimated to account for the largest share of the global NGS services market. The large share of this segment is attributed to its highest yield of error-free throughput, base call value above Q30, and higher accuracy in DNA sequencing compared to other sequencing technologies available in the market. Based on application, the global NGS services market is segmented into research applications and clinical applications. In 2023, the research applications segment is estimated to account for the largest share of the global NGS services market. This segment's large share is mainly attributed to the increasing demand for gene-based medicines, growing investments in drug research and development activities, and increasing research programs for personalized medicine. Based on end user, the global NGS services market is segmented into hospitals & clinics, pharmaceutical & biotechnology companies, academic institutes & research centers, and other end users. In 2023, the hospitals & clinics segment is estimated to account for the largest share of the global NGS services market. The largest share of this segment is attributed to factors such as high capital requirements for building in-house NGS capabilities in hospitals & clinics, the rising prevalence of cancer and other chronic diseases, the growing demand for advanced medical treatments, and the rising number of biomarker-based therapies. North America is expected to command the largest share of the global next generation sequencing services market in 2023, followed by Europe and Asia-Pacific.

Since NGS platforms can sequence an entire genomic region or even an entire genome, a single test can examine hundreds or thousands of clinically important genetic variations. This means that one test can replace multiple conventional single-gene tests, providing an advantage in price and in the amount of precious sample needed for the test itself. NGS is often more accurate and reliable than existing diagnostics. This can result in better clinical outcomes. For example, NGS can increase the pregnancy success rates in in vitro fertilization applications. Also, in rare genetic diseases, NGS can increase the success rates for determining a molecular diagnosis. The NGS platform enables companies to expand the menu of disorders/diseases over time after initial launch of a test. This strategy has been employed in reproductive health applications, for example, launching a test to initially screen for aneuploidies, and then later expanding the test to include screening for additional genetic variants. These features of NGS platforms provide a solid basis for the use of this technology in the clinic. The scope of the report includes clinical NGS technologies, applications, industries, initiatives, patents, and companies. The markets for NGS-based diagnostics are given for the years 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 and 2028. This report reviews the main sequencing technologies and explains why genetic variation is important in clinical testing. It then discusses some of the significant research initiatives that impact clinical NGS applications. Liquid biopsy formats are discussed. The main market driving forces are also discussed. The report examines the markets by test complexity, clinical indication and test purpose. Test complexity refers to the plex level (i.e., the number of genetic markers that can be analyzed within a sample) and coverage (e.g., the extent to which the genome is covered) of the test. Examining the market by test complexity provides valuable insight into which products (e.g., sample preparation, NGS instrument, informatics, etc.) will be in demand in the future. The report provides market data and forecasts for NGS diagnostics by specific applications, including those for oncology, cardiovascular diseases, clinical microbiology/infectious diseases, Mendelian disorders, metabolic/immune disorders, neurological disorders, reproductive health, and transplant medicine. Industry sectors analyzed include DNA sequencing instruments; long-read sequencing; sequencing informatics; target enrichment; CTC capture and detection; liquid biopsy; cancer screening/early detection; direct-to-consumer testing; and noninvasive prenatal testing.
