Heâ€™s published over a dozen books, holds patents, has spoken on Capitol Hill about the increase in international cyber threats, and is a recognized keynote speaker. In 2006, Foster founded the cyber security firm, Ciphent. Ciphent grew to almost 100 employees with 1000 customers by 2010 when it was acquired by Accuvant. With a three year growth rate of 8900+%, Ciphent was recognized as the #16th Fastest Growing Private Company in the US and #1 in Maryland by Inc. Magazine. As Chairman of the Advisory Board and SVP while at Accuvant, Foster led the successful acquisition of V3rity while the company achieved 50% year-over-year growth in 2011 with revenues in excess of $325M. Additionally, Foster has had the privilege of working with several other high growth cyber security organizations such as Booz Allen and Hamilton and Computer Sciences Corporation, and executing on exit strategies for Foundstone (acquired by McAfee for $86M), Guardent (acquired by Verisign $135M), and Information Security Magazine (acquired by Tech Target Media for an unpublicized amount). Foster started his career as a civilian in the United States Navy in Annapolis, Maryland. In 2005, Foster became a Fellow from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania and received his Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering from Capitol College."
