        "text": "If there’s one thing I love, it’s an unexpected movie fact. For instance, I never knew that Jim Carrey nearly took Will Ferrell’s iconic role in Elf.\n\nAnd I was pretty surprised to read that yup, that was Barry Keoghan in the nude scene at the end of Saltburn.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut not even my fact-weary mind could have prepared myself for the Home Alone fact Talk2pops_ recently shared on TikTok.\n\nHe began the video by explaining that most of the snow in the classic Christmas movie was, in fact, “mashed potatoes” (or more specifically, dried potato flakes).\n\nNO?!\n\nYes! The TikToker cut to a clip from the Home Alone episode of Netflix’s The Movies That Made Us, revealing original footage of the behind-the-scenes work in the film.\n\n“There was no snow on the ground,” a voiceover says in the documentary, “so what they did was they had rolls of white material” for the ground.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSide note ― Dawson’s Creek also used this budget special effect, leading fans to notice a hilarious sinking effect once the series made it to HD TV.\n\nBut for the falling snow, they used good ol’ dry potato flakes.\n\nPeople were pretty blindsided\n\n“Thanks for sharing, I never knew this!” one commenter shared.\n\n“Craaaaaaaazy,” another commented (I’m with you on that).\n\nTalk2pops also shared other facts most people don’t know about the movie, including the fact that the actor who plays cousin Fuller is actually Macaulay Culkin’s brother, Kieran.\n\nMany of the stunts in the movie were really done by the actors, and the movie actually created its own film-within-a-film for Macaulay Culkin to watch on screen.\n\nMost of the movie was actually shot outside of the home in the same school that Ferris Bueller’s Day Off was filmed, too."
