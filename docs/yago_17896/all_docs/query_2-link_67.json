Catherine O'Hara, Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern, and, of course, Macaulay Culkin bring the wacky characters to life in a way that leaves fans cracking up, whether it's their first watch or 100th. Enjoy this behind-the-scenes look at the iconic comedy with some insider info from members of the cast and crew. From the filming tricks behind your favorite moments to funny interactions between the cast (including the sweet name Macaulay calls Catherine to this day), read on for all the Home Alone trivia you never knew about."
