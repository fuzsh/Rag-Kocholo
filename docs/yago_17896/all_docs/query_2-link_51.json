        "text": "Home Alone, Christmas family comedy film released in 1990 about the adventures of Kevin McCallister, an eight-year-old boy, played by Macaulay Culkin, who has to fend for himself and thwart the attempts of a pair of bungling burglars trying to break into his family’s house after he is inadvertently left behind when his family departs for a holiday trip to France. The movie, written by John Hughes and directed by Chris Columbus, is considered a Christmas classic, and it made Culkin one of the most well-known child actors of the 1990s.\n\nThe movie begins the night before Peter (John Heard) and Kate McCallister (Catherine O’Hara) and their five children are scheduled to leave for Paris with Peter’s brother and sister-in-law and their children. During a chaotic dinner with all the family members, the McCallisters’ youngest child, Kevin (Culkin), is teased by his siblings and cousins and provoked by his elder brother Buzz (Devin Ratray), after which Kevin attacks Buzz and sets off a chain reaction of accidents. As punishment, Kevin’s mom sends him to the attic bedroom for the night, and he tells her that he wishes his family would just disappear.\n\nIn the middle of the night, a power outage causes the alarm clocks to reset, which results in the family members oversleeping and having to scramble to get to the airport on time. In their rush, Kevin is left behind, and they don’t realize it until they are in the air. When Kevin wakes up and finds the house empty, he believes his wish has come true.\n\nInitially, Kevin is ecstatic. He enjoys a huge ice cream sundae, potato chips, and a soda pop while watching a gangster movie; he sleds down the stairs, raids Buzz’s room, and uses his father’s aftershave. As time goes on, however, he becomes frightened when he hears the burglars, Harry (Joe Pesci) and Marv (Daniel Stern), who have been targeting his neighborhood, outside. He turns on the porch lights and scares them away and, later, vows to be prepared should they return.\n\nBy the time they come back, Kevin has set up the appearance of a house full of people by using lights and moving mannequins and stand-up poster cutouts to create silhouettes on the front curtains. When the burglars return, Kevin lights firecrackers and plays a gangster movie to make the burglars think they are hearing another set of burglars fighting inside the house. On the day of Christmas Eve, Harry and Marv return again to see what is going on in the house, and Kevin overhears their plan to come back at 9:00 pm that night.\n\nMissing his parents and the rest of his family, Kevin goes out early in the evening to visit Santa and ask him for their return instead of Christmas presents. Unbeknownst to him, they have been frantically trying to get a flight back since the second they landed in Paris.\n\nWhile walking home, Kevin hears a choir singing Christmas music in a church. He goes in to listen and notices his neighbor Mr. Marley (Roberts Blossom), who was rumored to have murdered his family many years ago. The old man wishes Kevin a merry Christmas, sits with him, and tells him he is there to watch his granddaughter sing. He also assures Kevin that there is no truth to the rumors about him. Kevin learns from Marley that Marley and his son had a horrible argument years ago and they have not spoken to each other since. Kevin realizes that Marley is a kind, but lonely, person, and he suggests that Marley try to make up with his son. They part ways with a handshake, and Kevin heads home to prepare his next defense against Harry and Marv.\n\nOnce home, Kevin hoses down the outdoor steps to make them icy and sets up booby traps throughout the house. As Harry and Marv near the back door, Kevin shoots them with a pellet gun, causing them to fall on the ice. When they manage to get inside, Kevin’s traps cause numerous superficial injuries, and the burglars chase him in frustration. After Harry and Marv catch Kevin, Marley sneaks up and knocks them out with a snow shovel.\n\nIn the end, Harry and Marv are arrested, and Kevin’s family makes it home for Christmas morning. After their cheerful reunion, Kevin looks out the window and sees Marley hugging his son.\n\nHome Alone earned more than $470 million worldwide and was the highest-grossing movie of the year. It was Hughes’s greatest commercial success and inspired three sequels: Home Alone 2: Lost in New York (1992), Home Alone 3 (1997), and the television movie Home Alone 4: Taking Back the House (2002) as well as other Home Alone films."
