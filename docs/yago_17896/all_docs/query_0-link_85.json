        "text": "GoEast: The 12th Festival of Central and East European Film in Wiesbaden, held in April 2012, devoted its symposium section to a thorough and scintillating reevaluation of Lenfilm, entitled: RealAvantGarde – With Lenfilm Through the Short 20th Century.\n\nAbout the Lenfilm Studio\n\nJeremy Hicks\n\nLenfilm, the first Soviet studio to be founded after the revolution, but perpetually the second studio of the USSR exerted enormous influence at crucial periods of Soviet and Russian film history: from its contribution to the 1920s avant-garde with the FEKS films and innovative animation, to its era-defining Chapaev and Maxim trilogy in the 1930s, through less famous, but no less crucial contributions to Thaw cinema, genre cinema, Brezhnev-era realism, concluding with a revisiting of experimentation in the Perestroika era. While the studio’s future is far from clear, GoEast: The 12th Festival of Central and East European Film in Wiesbaden, held in April 2012, devoted its Symposium section to a thorough and scintillating reevaluation of Lenfilm, entitled: RealAvantGarde – With Lenfilm Through the Short 20th Century. One of the great merits of the symposium, curated by the protean talents of Barbara Wurm and Olaf Müller, was its emphasis on the lesser known and less recognised dimensions of the Lenfilm catalogue, so that there was no screening of the FEKS films or Chapaev. Instead, there was a consistent attempt to push beyond the boundaries of the obvious to discuss neglected names or disregarded dimensions of the studio’s production. To aid this, each of the four days coupled morning lectures with afternoon and evening screenings of films discussed there. The effect was intellectually stimulating and unprecedentedly popular for the GoEast festival symposium.\n\n2012 – The Year of Soviet Studios\n\nNatascha Drubek\n\nIn May 2012 the Russian online journal openspace.ru published an extensive article by Ivan Chuviliaev on Soviet film studios — some of them still working, some closed down. There is a growing need to understand the institutional aspects of Soviet cinema. This has been an important part of cinema studies in the West where the phenomenon of the American studio has been under the scrutiny of film historians for many decades. By contrast, there has been little continuous tradition of research into Soviet cinema history that focuses on the studios.\n\nOne has to be all the more gratified that in 2012 there have been several film retrospectives devoted to Soviet film studios. This started with a grand retrospective of films produced by the Mezhrabpom-Film studio at the 62th Berlinale in February. Entitled “The Red Dream Factory. Mezhrabpom-Film and Prometheus 1921—1936”, the festival showed 43 films produced by Mezhrabpom-Film. The studio was a joint venture set up in 1922 by Soviet producer Moisei Aleinikov and German communist Willi Münzenberg, initially called Mezhrabpom-Rus’. It produced approximately 600 films between 1922 and 1936. At the height of Stalinism it was transformed into a studio for the production of children’s films.\n\nLenfilm, another important (and still active) studio was presented during the Lenfilm retrospective and symposium at the 12th GoEast Festival in Wiesbaden in April 2012. This symposium made speakers and audiences realize how important the legacy of Soviet film history for Russian cinema today. The studio now has become a talking point in the Russian media.\n\nLenfilm, which was founded in 1918, is in debt and in danger of being closed. The land on which the studio stands is very valuable as it is in the center of St. Petersburg, not far from the Fortress of Peter and Paul. Until recently there were three groups who fought for their ideas for the future of the studio. The first group wanted to transform it into a production center (According to other sources initially this group had plans to turn the studio into something called Lenfilm-Park which would be a Disney World on the Neva). The second option, put forward by a company that planned to turn the property into a business park, was withdrawn recently. The third option would be to modernize the Lenfilm studio to the standard of a contemporary film studio, and to retrieve the rights of past Lenfilm productions lost a decade ago. This concept has been put forward by director Aleksandr Sokurov who wants to revive a specialized production profile in the studio, and add an educational center. It now seems that Sokurov and his group were not successful.\n\n1.

Shostakovich in Film\n\nJohn Riley, film scholar and author of Dmitrii Shostakovich: A Life in Film talks about Shostakovich’s approach to film music and its relation to the Lenfilm tradition. In the second part of the interview, John Riley talks about Shostakovich’s use of song in Grigorii Kozintsev and Leonid Trauberg’s Alone (Odna, 1931). In the symposium, Shostakovich’s film music was represented in particular by his contributions to Mikhail Tsekhanovsky’s animated films as well as to Kozintsev and Trauberg’s more widely known The Youth of Maxim (Iunost´ Maksima, 1934).\n\n4. The Discovery of Evgenii Cherviakov\n\nPetr Bagrov, film historian at State University of Film and Television. St. Petersburg, and an unrivalled authority on Lenfilm, discusses the significance of the discovery of Evgenii Cherviakov’s film My Son (Moi syn, 1926) fragments of which he previewed at the symposium. Cherviakov’s Cities and Years (Goroda I Gody, 1930) was also screened at the symposium.\n\n5. The Place of Studios and the importance of Fridrikh Ermler\n\nhttps://artmargins.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/EastWest2012_RileyInterviewsKapterev-Lenfilm.mp3\n\nSergei Kapterev, of Moscow’s Film Research Scientific Institute and the State Institute of Cinematography, is a film historian recognised equally in the English and Russian-speaking worlds. He discussed the place of the studio in Russian film history, and the unique contribution of director Fridrikh Ermler, whose 1965 film, Before the Judgment of History (Pered sudom istorii) was screened at the Symposium.\n\n6.
