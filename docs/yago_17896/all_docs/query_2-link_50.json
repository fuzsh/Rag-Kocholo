        "text": "NOT ALONE IN HERE (Short Film, 2020)\n\nDirected by David F. Sandberg\n\nWritten by Lotta Losten, David F. Sandberg\n\nStarring Lotta Losten, David F. Sandberg\n\nSo we’ve all been trying to be productive during the shutdown. I cleaned my closet, organized a few things, write a few more pitches for comics that I hope to be picked up, and started up a new Youtube channel—MLMillerFrights. But LIGHTS OUT director David F. Sandberg has been really busy as he put together a 6 minute short horror film called NOT ALONE IN HERE.\n\nThe story focuses on a woman (Lotta Losten) getting ready for bed. She goes through her routine and locks the door to her apartment as she brushes her teeth. Something she’s done a million times before. But upon returning from the bathroom, she notices her door wide open. The rest of the short follows the woman as she narrates in her head how anxious and scared she is that someone is in the house. Is there anyone there or is it just her imagination?\n\nWhile this is a short film as short as they come, I knew from David F. Sandberg’s previous short film LIGHT’S OUT (which inspired the full length film) that the director has the power to terrify me to my core in just a few short moments. And he does so here, both by playing with camera movement, lacing the scenes with compelling narration from Losten, and playing with simple tropes we’ve seen in countless other horror films.\n\nThe film ratchets up the tension to a painful level by the final moments as you are simply waiting for the other shoe to drop and knowing this is a short film, understanding that the shoe is going to drop pretty darn quickly. And drop it does and the results are wonderfully terrifying. I loved the pace, tone, and just about everything about NOT ALONE IN HERE. It’s proof that Sandberg isn’t a one trick pony and I can’t wait for this lockdown to be over with so he can get out there and make more films for me to squirm to. NOT ALONE IN HERE was a fantastic appetizer for those who are hungry for new, fresh, and wickedly effective horror. Watch it below if you don’t believe me!\n\nClick here for the full short film NOT ALONE IN HERE!!"
