        "text": "ONE of the major treats of the current New York Film Festival at Lincoln Center will be the one-time-only screening tonight of that classic of Soviet silent cinema, Grigory Kozintsev and Leonid Trauberg's ''New Babylon'' (1929). The film is as much a celebration of Expressionistic cinema, of which it is a delirious example, as it is of the Paris Commune of 1873, which is its subject.\n\nFor this special retrospective presentation, the festival moves temporarily to Radio City Music Hall, where ''The New Babylon'' will be shown at 9:30 P.M. with - and this is a large part of the spectacle - the Radio City Music Hall Chamber Orchestra, under the direction of Omri Hadari, playing the film's original musical score by Dmitri Shostakovich. When the film opened here (to tepid reviews) on Dec. 1, 1929, which, by chance, was the also the opening day of G. W. Pabst's ''Pandora's Box,'' it was without the Shostakovich score.\n\nTonight's Radio City screening will be the first opportunity the general public in this country has had to see and hear the film as it was designed to be presented. If tonight's showing matches the Friday afternoon press preview, it should be a smash.\n\nImmediately after the preview Mr. Hadari apologized for the occasional lapses in synchronization between the orchestra and the film, though these were not immediately apparent to most members of the audience.\n\nWhat was gloriously apparent was that this Shostakovich score, the composer's first for a motion picture, is a model of its kind - witty, occasionally rousing and often extremely funny all on its own, though it never comes between the images and the audience. One never has the wish to turn it off or, at least, down, as one does while listening to Carmine Coppola's relentless score for Abel Gance's ''Napoleon.''\n\nThis difference in scores, of course, also represents the difference between the two films. ''Napoleon'' is a big, grandly patriotic emotional binge. ''The New Babylon'' is something else entirely, a series of wicked political sketches, not unlike Goya's ''Disasters of War.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
