        "text": "MOSCOW, May 11—Grigory Kozintsev, a Soviet director known for his Shakespearean movies, died today in Leningrad. He was 68 years old.\n\nMr. Kozintsev was best known abroad for his “Hamlet,” produced in 1964 with Innokenti Smoktunovsky in the title role. Both received the Lenin Prize the following year.\n\nMore recently Mr. Kozintsev directed “King Lear,” which has also been widely shown abroad. In addition to filming Shakespeare plays, Mr. Kozintsev was the author of a book, “Shakespeare: Time and Conscience,” published in the United States in 1966 by Hill & Wang.\n\nA native of the Ukranian city of Kiev, Mr. Kozintsev began his career as an art student in Leningrad (then Petrograd), before joining the film industry as an actor and director in the early nineteentwenties.\n\nTogether with Leonid Trauberg, screenwriter and director, Mr. Kozintsev founded the Factory of the Eccentric Actor, an early experimental group that sought to give punch to Communist political slogans through the use of circus acts, camera tricks and a rapidly paced action.\n\nIn the late nineteen‐twenties, Mr. Kozintsev and Mr. Trauberg collaborated on a number of silent films, including “The Overcoat” (1926), based on a story by Gogol, “S.V.D.” (1927), which tells about the Decembrist revolt of young czarist officers in 1825, and “The New Babylon” (1929), about the Paris Commune of 1871.\n\nA series of sound films by the two collaborators was the trilogy about Maxim (1932–38), about a young worker who becomes a revolutionary leader. The three films were awarded the Stalin Prize in 1941 and have become classics of the Soviet cinema.\n\nToward the end of the Stalin era, Mr. Kozintsev made number of biographical films“Pirogov” (1947), about a 19th‐century surgeon, and “Belinsky” (1951), about a liberal writer of the last century. In 1957 Mr. Kozintsev produced “Don Quixote,” which was successful abroad."
