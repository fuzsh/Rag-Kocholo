ORLANDO -- Backup big man Chris Kaman suffered a strained right shoulder in the Trail Blazers' Friday night loss to the Orlando Magic and his playing status against the Memphis Grizzlies is uncertain.

Kaman said Friday he wasn't sure how he suffered the injury or if he would be healed in time for Saturday's important matchup against the Grizzlies. Kaman played nine minutes in the Blazers' 111-104 loss to Orlando, recording eight points and four rebounds, while making all four of his field goal attempts.

But at some point in the first half, Kaman injured his shoulder, and he did not play in the second half. Kaman, who is the Blazers' first big off the bench, was averaging 8.7 points and 6.6 rebounds before facing the Magic Orlando.

Joel Freeland and Meyers Leonard filled in for Kaman in the second half against the Magic and it seems likely both would seen an uptick in playing time if Kaman is forced to sit out Saturday.
