        "text": "As captain for the past two seasons, Lillard has made it clear to his teammates that their playoff checks should be donated to the Blazers’ support staff, which consists of everybody from massage therapists to the trainers at the practice facility. With some Blazers teams, the locker room leadership was not always as generous. Three seasons ago, when veteran Chris Kaman joined the team, he became appalled that the Blazers were keeping their playoff checks. Kaman, who became close with Lillard, told him if he ever led a team he should insist on getting the guys to donate to underscore the importance of unity and having one’s back.\n\nPeople want to know where Chris Kaman is, is he retiring, what his future might be. I always thought it was funny that he would say to you very often, “I hated every head coach I ever played for, but I like you.” So that’s probably the ultimate compliment that you could ever receive from somebody. We’ll lose a lot of humor on the bus and the team planes if he’s not around, but have you talked to him at all or do you know what he’s doing? Stotts: He’s back in Michigan. He did come back here, you know, he bought some property out in central Oregon and he came back here to get some of his stuff. I think he’s leaving his options open as far as playing next year. I don’t know where he is with that. I just heard today that he is beginning a workout regimen. He’s a talented guy. I think people know he could have helped us last year. Last year was about our young guys. He was extremely admirable in fulfilling that role."
