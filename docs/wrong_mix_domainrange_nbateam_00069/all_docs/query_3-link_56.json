        "text": "EASTERN CONFERENCE\n\nTeam-by-team capsules for the NBA's Eastern Conference, listed alphabetically within divisions:\n\n___\n\nATLANTIC DIVISION\n\nBOSTON CELTICS\n\nLAST SEASON: 48-34, lost in Eastern Conference quarterfinals.\n\nCOACH: Brad Stevens (fourth season, fourth NBA season).\n\nPROJECTED STARTING FIVE: F Jae Crowder (14.2 ppg), F Amir Johnson (7.3 ppg), C Al Horford (15.2 ppg), G Avery Bradley (15.2 ppg), G Isaiah Thomas (22.2 ppg).\n\nADDED: Horford, F Jaylen Brown.\n\nLOST: G-F Evan Turner, F Jared Sullinger.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH: Horford. The Celtics definitely improved around the rim by adding Horford on the inside. He also has the ability to stretch the floor as a shooter, which should open up things more for Boston's backcourt, and gives the Celtics a much-needed veteran presence.\n\nOUTLOOK: Some bad luck on the injury front late in the season stunted Boston in the playoffs, and the Celtics aren't expected to have Kelly Olynyk (offseason shoulder surgery) ready to start this season. But with a young core — Thomas, Bradley, Crowder, Marcus Smart and Terry Rozier — to combine with Horford, and with the highly respected Stevens leading the way the Celtics could be Cleveland's biggest challenger in the East.\n\n___\n\nBROOKLYN NETS\n\nLAST SEASON: 21-61, missed playoffs.\n\nCOACH: Kenny Atkinson (first season, first NBA season).\n\nPROJECTED STARTING FIVE: F Rondae Hollis-Jefferson (5.8 ppg), F Trevor Booker (5.9 ppg), C Brook Lopez (20.6 ppg), G Jeremy Lin (11.7 ppg), G Bojan Bogdanovic (11.2 ppg).\n\nADDED: Lin, Booker, G Randy Foye, G Greivis Vasquez, G Joe Harris, F Luis Scola, F Justin Hamilton, F Anthony Bennett, F Caris LeVert.\n\nLOST: F Thaddeus Young, F Thomas Robinson, G Jarrett Jack, G Wayne Ellington, G Shane Larkin, G Donald Sloan, G Markel Brown.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH: Lin. Nearly five years after Linsanity briefly lit up New York, the point guard returns to the city coming off a strong season as a backup in Charlotte and believing he's ready to lead a team again as a starter. Playing under Atkinson, who was a Knicks assistant during that 2011-12 season, should help his transition.\n\nOUTLOOK: The Nets are thinking about the long term in building the team, which means the now isn't going to be pretty. Absent the star power they tried to line the roster with in their first few years in Brooklyn, the Nets should be one of the worst teams in the NBA and miss the playoffs for the second straight season.\n\n___\n\nNEW YORK KNICKS\n\nLAST SEASON: 32-50, missed playoffs.\n\nCOACH: Jeff Hornacek (first season, fourth NBA season).\n\nPROJECTED STARTING FIVE: F Carmelo Anthony (21.8 ppg), F Kristaps Porzingis (14.3 ppg), C Joakim Noah (4.3 ppg), G Derrick Rose (16.4 ppg), G Courtney Lee (9.6 ppg).\n\nADDED: Rose, Lee, Noah, G Brandon Jennings, G Justin Holiday, C Guillermo \"Willy\" Hernangomez, C Marshall Plumlee, F Mindaugas Kuzminskas.\n\nLOST: C Robin Lopez, G Arron Afflalo, G Langston Galloway, G Jose Calderon, G Jerian Grant, F Derrick Williams, F Kevin Seraphin.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH: Rose. The oft-injured guard played in 66 games last season for Chicago, his most since his MVP season of 2010-11. He said he's healthy now and was able to focus on basketball during the offseason instead of rehabbing from injury, but the transition to his new team has been delayed while he missed most of preseason because of his now-completed rape civil trial in Los Angeles.\n\nOUTLOOK: The talent Phil Jackson brought in is good enough to get the Knicks into the playoffs for the first time since 2013. But they have to stay healthy, and that's been a problem in particular for Rose and Noah.\n\n___\n\nPHILADELPHIA 76ERS\n\nLAST SEASON: 10-72, missed playoffs.\n\nCOACH: Brett Brown (fourth season, fourth NBA season).\n\nPROJECTED STARTING FIVE: PG T.J. McConnell (6.1 ppg), SG Nik Stausukas (8.5 ppg), SF Robert Covington (12.8 ppg), PF Jahlil Okafor (17.5 ppg), C Joel Embiid (missed first two seasons).\n\nADDED: G-F Ben Simmons, G Gerald Henderson, G-F Timothe Luwawu.\n\nLOST: G Ish Smith.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH: Embiid. Surgeries cost him his first two pro seasons, meaning he hasn't played since his lone season at Kansas — and therefore could win rookie of the year, three years after he gets drafted. The versatile 7-foot-2 center has become a hit in Philadelphia with his social media posts. The 76ers are counting on even more production on the court and have loosened the minutes restrictions they expected to place on him this season.\n\nOUTLOOK: It will still be a struggle. Simmons, the No. 1 overall pick, should be sidelined for months because of a broken bone in his right foot and Okafor and Noel are both battling injuries. The Sixers are no longer tankers, but seem well away from the playoffs. No, they won't win 10 games again. But more than 20 would be a major success.\n\n___\n\nTORONTO RAPTORS\n\nLAST SEASON: 56-26, lost in Eastern Conference finals.\n\nCOACH: Dwane Casey (sixth season, eighth NBA season).\n\nPROJECTED STARTING FIVE: G Kyle Lowry (21.2 ppg), G DeMar DeRozan (23.5 ppg), C Jonas Valanciunas (12.8 ppg), F DeMarre Carroll (11.0 ppg), F Jared Sullinger (10.3 ppg).\n\nADDED: Sullinger, C Jakon Poeltl, F Pascasl Siakam, G Fred VanVleet.\n\nLOST: C Bismack Biyombo, F James Johnson, F Luis Scola, C Jason Thompson.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH: DeRozan. After averaging a career-high 23.5 points per game last season, DeRozan opted out of his contract before signing a $139 million, five-year deal to remain a Raptor without really testing the free-agent market. He helped the U.S. win a gold medal at the Rio Olympics, and says he represents Toronto \"harder than anybody.\"\n\nOUTLOOK: Toronto brings back the core of the team that put together the best regular season record in team history and its deepest playoff run. While Eastern Conference opponents such as New York and Chicago had busier summers, the Raptors continue to build around DeRozan and Lowry. The elusive goal is to unseat LeBron James, whose teams have represented the East in six straight NBA Finals.\n\n___\n\nCENTRAL DIVISION\n\nCHICAGO BULLS\n\nLAST SEASON: 42-40, missed playoffs.\n\nCOACH: Fred Hoiberg (second season, second NBA season).\n\nPROJECTED STARTING FIVE: F Jimmy Butler (20.9 ppg), F Nikola Mirotic (11.8 ppg), C Robin Lopez (10.3 ppg), G Rajon Rondo (11.9 ppg), G Dwyane Wade (19.0 ppg).\n\nADDED: Wade, Lopez, Rondo, G Michael Carter-Williams, G Jerian Grant, G Denzel Valentine.\n\nLOST: G Derrick Rose, F Pau Gasol, C Joakim Noah, G Tony Snell.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH: Butler. His reputation took a hit last season for calling out Hoiberg and simply not clicking with Rose. But now he has a three-time champion to learn from in Wade, and could take a major step forward.\n\nOUTLOOK: The Bulls figure to be a whole lot more interesting at least with the additions of Wade and Rondo. But will they be better? The Bulls needed to shake things up coming off their first playoff miss since 2008. They sure did that by jettisoning Rose — the Chicago product and former MVP — to New York. Wade comes home to Chicago with three championships and 12 All-Star selections in 13 seasons with Miami, but he and Rondo are both on the wrong side of 30.\n\n___\n\nCLEVELAND CAVALIERS\n\nLAST SEASON: 57-25, won NBA championship.\n\nCOACH: Tyronn Lue (second season, second NBA season).\n\nPROJECTED STARTING FIVE: F LeBron James (25.3 ppg), F Kevin Love (16.0 ppg), C Tristan Thompson G (7.8 ppg), G Kyrie Irving (19.6 ppg), G J.R. Smith (12.4 ppg).\n\nADDED: F Mike Dunleavy, C Chris Andersen, G Kay Felder.\n\nLOST: G Matthew Dellavedova, C Timofey Mozgov, G Mo Williams, F/C Anderson Varejao, C Sasha Kaun.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH: Irving. He's healthy and bursting with confidence after winning a league title and Olympic gold medal this summer. It took some time, but Irving has figured out how to play alongside James and vice versa. Irving, still just 24, has matured on and off the floor and has been helped by Lue, a journeyman point guard who is bringing out the best in one of his stars.\n\nOUTLOOK: The pressure is off for James and his teammates, who made history with their comeback from a 3-1 deficit in the NBA Finals to become the first Cleveland team to win a championship since 1964. At 31, James is showing no signs of decline and remains the game's most complete player. He's three titles from catching Michael Jordan, and for the first time in his career he's embracing the chase. A Finals rematch with Golden State looks inevitable.\n\n___\n\nDETROIT PISTONS\n\nLAST SEASON: 44-38, lost in Eastern Conference quarterfinals.\n\nCOACH: Stan Van Gundy (third season, 11th NBA season).\n\nPROJECTED STARTING FIVE: F Tobias Harris (14.7 ppg), F Marcus Morris (14.1 ppg), C Andre Drummond (16.2 ppg), G Reggie Jackson (18.8 ppg), G Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (14.5 ppg).\n\nADDED: G Ish Smith, F Jon Leuer.\n\nLOST: G Steve Blake, G Jodie Meeks, F Anthony Tolliver.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH: Drummond is the player the Pistons have built around, but his free throw shooting prevented him from being on the court late in some big games last season. He was 35.5 percent from the line in 2015-16, and there's been no clear evidence of improvement during the preseason.\n\nOUTLOOK: Detroit returned to the playoffs last season for the first time since 2009, and the next step for this young team is to improve to where it can advance past the first round. Van Gundy has helped lift this franchise after some pretty lean years, although the Pistons are facing an immediate challenge in 2016-17 because Jackson could miss at least the first month of the regular season because of knee and thumb problems.\n\n___\n\nINDIANA PACERS\n\nLAST SEASON: 45-37, lost in Eastern Conference quarterfinals.\n\nCOACH: Nate McMillan (first season, 13th NBA season).\n\nPROJECTED STARTING FIVE: PG Jeff Teague (15.7 ppg), SG Monta Ellis (13.8 ppg), SF Paul George (23.1 ppg), PF Thaddeus Young (15.1 ppg), C Myles Turner (10.3 ppg).\n\nADDED: Teague, Young, C Al Jefferson, F Georges Niang, G Aaron Brooks.\n\nLOST: PG George Hill, C Ian Mahinmi, F Jordan Hill, F Solomon Hill.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH: George. Admittedly not 100 percent last season, the three-time All-Star still played well most of last season and was dominant in the playoffs. Now, after winning an Olympic gold medal, the 26-year-old star appears poised for a breakout season as he chases an NBA championship.\n\nOUTLOOK: Indiana's offseason moves — including having McMillan replace Frank Vogel — have completely changed the look of this team. The addition of Teague will allow the Pacers to play at Larry Bird's preferred up-tempo pace. The addition of Young and the maturation of second-year center Myles Turner now make this a true spread team. The question is whether they're good enough to challenge the defending champion Cavaliers in the East.\n\n___\n\nMILWAUKEE BUCKS\n\nLAST SEASON: 33-49, missed playoffs.\n\nCOACH: Jason Kidd (third season, fourth NBA season).\n\nPROJECTED STARTING FIVE: F Giannis Antetokounmpo (16.9 ppg), F Jabari Parker (14.1 ppg), C Miles Plumlee (5.1 ppg), G Matthew Dellavedova (7.5 ppg), G Tony Snell (5.3 ppg).\n\nADDED: Dellavedova, Snell, F Mirza Teletovic, G Jason Terry, F Thon Maker, G Malcolm Brogdon.\n\nLOST: G Jerryd Bayless, G Michael Carter-Williams, G Tyler Ennis, G O.J. Mayo, G Greivis Vasquez.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH: Antetokounmpo. The forward-looking Bucks lived up to their motto in signing the athletic fourth-year player to an extension just before the start of the season. Now the 6-foot-11 Antetokounmpo will handle ball-handling responsibilities for a full season for the first time after excelling in the role late last year.\n\nOUTLOOK: Playoff hopes took a hit when leading scorer Khris Middleton (18.2 ppg) was lost for six months to a hamstring injury in September. Antetokounmpo is a matchup problem and should only get better, as should fellow franchise cornerstone Parker. The Bucks have to improve their outside shooting with Dellavedova, Snell and Teletovic, and can't allow 103 points per game again.\n\n___\n\nSOUTHEAST DIVISION\n\nATLANTA HAWKS\n\nLAST SEASON: 48-34, lost in Eastern Conference semifinals.\n\nCOACH: Mike Budenholzer (fourth season, fourth NBA season).\n\nPROJECTED STARTING FIVE: F Kent Bazemore (11.6 ppg), F Paul Milsap (17.1 ppg), C Dwight Howard (13.7 ppg), G Kyle Korver (9.2 ppg), G Dennis Schroder (11.0 ppg).\n\nADDED: Howard, G Jarrett Jack, G Malcolm Delaney, F Taurean Prince, F DeAndre Bembry.\n\nLOST: F-C Al Horford, G Jeff Teague.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH: Howard. The Atlanta native transformed the Hawks' lineup, giving the team the legitimate center it lacked through much of the past decade, when he signed a three-year, $70.5 million deal in July. Howard's defensive rebounds and shot-blocking skills could trigger fast breaks, with the super-quick Schroder leading the way.\n\nOUTLOOK: The Hawks were given a mini-facelift after making their ninth straight playoff appearance, the longest active streak in the East. Getting swept by Cleveland in the second round showed the Hawks weren't title contenders. Howard is in the spotlight, but equally important to the makeover will be Schroder's ability to utilize his quickness while playing under control as he takes over the point guard position.\n\n___\n\nCHARLOTTE HORNETS\n\nLAST SEASON: 48-34, lost in Eastern Conference quarterfinals.\n\nCOACH: Steve Clifford (fourth season, fourth NBA season).\n\nPROJECTED STARTING FIVE: F Marvin Williams (11.7 ppg), F Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (12.7 ppg), C Cody Zeller (8.7 ppg), G Kemba Walker (20.9 ppg), G Nicolas Batum (14.9 ppg).\n\nADDED: G Marco Belinelli, C Roy Hibbert, G Ramon Sessions.\n\nLOST: G Jeremy Lin, G Courtney Lee, C Al Jefferson, C Tyler Hansbrough.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH: Walker. He elevated his game last season with vastly improved 3-point shooting and a better working knowledge on how to set up the pick and roll. Several teammates felt like Walker should have been an All-Star. Walker, who is coming off offseason knee surgery, has set that as a goal this season. When the Hornets need a basket late in the game, chances are Walker is going to be the one taking it.\n\nOUTLOOK: The Hornets aren't going to be as good as they were offensively after losing Lin, Lee and Jefferson. They're hoping Clifford can help resurrect the careers of Belinelli and Hibbert, who are coming off tough seasons.\n\n___\n\nMIAMI HEAT\n\nLAST SEASON: 48-34, lost in Eastern Conference semifinals.\n\nCOACH: Erik Spoelstra (ninth season, ninth NBA season).\n\nPROJECTED STARTING FIVE: G Goran Dragic (14.1 ppg), G Dion Waiters (9.8 ppg), C Hassan Whiteside (14.2 ppg), F Justise Winslow (6.4 ppg), F Derrick Williams (9.3 ppg).\n\nADDED: Waiters, Williams, F Luke Babbitt, F James Johnson, G Wayne Ellington, C Willie Reed, G Rodney McGruder.\n\nLOST: G Dwyane Wade, F Luol Deng, G-F Joe Johnson, G Gerald Green, C Amare Stoudemire, G Dorell Wright.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH: Whiteside. He has a $98 million contract for the next four seasons, and with Wade gone and Chris Bosh not in the team's plans going forward the pressure to lead now falls on his shoulders. Time will tell if he's ready.\n\nOUTLOOK: The Heat believe they have enough to be in the playoff mix, though there's obvious uncertainty entering a season without Wade for the first time in 14 years. Waiters could be a major key — he took a $2.9 million deal, saying he's betting on himself this season. And the Heat will play faster, a pace Dragic likes. Getting Josh Richardson back from his knee injury will be an early season boost.\n\n___\n\nORLANDO MAGIC\n\nLAST SEASON: 35-47, missed playoffs.\n\nCOACH: Frank Vogel (first season, seventh NBA season).\n\nPROJECTED STARTING FIVE: F Aaron Gordon (9.2 ppg), F Serge Ibaka (12.6 ppg), C Nikola Vucevic (18.2 ppg), G Evan Fournier (15.4 ppg), G Elfrid Payton (10.7 ppg).\n\nADDED: Ibaka, C Bismack Biyombo, F Jeff Green, G Jodie Meeks, G D.J. Augustin, F Damjan Rudez.\n\nLOST: G Victor Oladipo, C Dewayne Dedmon, F Ersan Ilyasova, G Brandon Jennings, F Andrew Nicholson.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH: Gordon will be a key. Vogel has shifted Gordon to small forward this season, which means his outside game will be called upon more and he'll be asked to guard smaller — and quicker — players. Vogel envisions Gordon being in the mold of Paul George when he coached him with Indiana.\n\nOUTLOOK: Orlando hasn't been in the playoffs since Dwight Howard departed in 2012. Vogel hopes to get Orlando there by improving the defense with the offseason acquisitions of Ibaka and Biyombo, who should greatly improve the interior defense. But there's also scoring questions, and whether Now the Magic just have to find some consistent scoring among Fournier, Gordon, Green and Meeks.\n\n___\n\nWASHINGTON WIZARDS\n\nLAST SEASON: 41-41, missed playoffs.\n\nCOACH: Scott Brooks (first season, eighth NBA season).\n\nPROJECTED STARTING FIVE: G John Wall (19.9 ppg), G Bradley Beal (17.4 ppg), C Marcin Gortat (13.5 ppg), F Markieff Morris (12.4 ppg), F Otto Porter (11.6 ppg).\n\nADDED: C Ian Mahinmi, G/F Tomas Satoransky, G Trey Burke, F Andrew Nicholson, F/C Jason Smith.\n\nLOST: G Garrett Temple, F Jared Dudley, F/C Nene, G Ramon Sessions, F J.J. Hickson, F Drew Gooden.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH: Wall. Even though he's coming off a surgical procedure on each knee, Wall is primed for a fourth consecutive all-star appearance at age 26. The 2010 No. 1 pick had career highs in points, assists, rebounds and steals last season and is determined to get the Wizards back to the playoffs, even if he has to carry them there himself.\n\nOUTLOOK: Changes were guaranteed after Washington missed the playoffs following two postseason trips, and it started with replacing Randy Wittman with Brooks. He wants consistent defense and better home-court play to be hallmarks for the Wizards, who have talent to score. If everything goes right, the Wizards will return to the playoffs — a first step toward bigger things down the road.\n\nWESTERN CONFERENCE\n\nTeam-by-team capsules for the NBA's Western Conference, listed alphabetically within divisions:\n\nSOUTHWEST DIVISION\n\nDALLAS MAVERICKS\n\nLAST SEASON: 42-40, lost in Western Conference quarterfinals.\n\nCOACH: Rick Carlisle (ninth season, 15th NBA season).\n\nPROJECTED STARTING FIVE: G Deron Williams (14.1 ppg), G Wesley Matthews (12.5 ppg), F Harrison Barnes (11.7 ppg), F Dirk Nowitzki, (18.3 ppg), C Andrew Bogut (5.4 ppg).\n\nADDED: Barnes, Bogut, G Seth Curry, F Quincy Acy, C A.J. Hammons.\n\nLOST: F Chandler Parsons, C Zaza Pachulia, G Raymond Felton, F David Lee.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH: Barnes will play under the expectations of a max deal after Golden State had to turn him loose in free agency to add Kevin Durant, which is also why the Mavericks ended up with Bogut in a trade. Barnes shot poorly in the preseason, just as he did in three straight losses in the NBA Finals when the Warriors blew a 3-1 lead against Cleveland.\n\nOUTLOOK: The Mavericks had to settle for seconds after another failed run through their first options in free agency. The outlook brightened a bit when the Durant decision landed Dallas two starters from the 2015 champs, but it will still be a difficult task to finish in the West's top four something they haven't done since Dirk Nowitzki led them to a title in 2011.\n\nHOUSTON ROCKETS\n\nLAST SEASON: 41-41, lost in Western Conference quarterfinals.\n\nCOACH: Mike D'Antoni (first season, 13th NBA season).\n\nPROJECTED STARTING FIVE: F Trevor Ariza (12.7 ppg), F Ryan Anderson (17.0 ppg), C Clint Capela (7.0 ppg), G James Harden (29.0 ppg), G Patrick Beverley (9.9 ppg).\n\nADDED: Anderson, G Eric Gordon, C Nene.\n\nLOST: C Dwight Howard, F Josh Smith, F Michael Beasley, F Terrence Jones, G Jason Terry.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH: Harden. He put up career-highs in points, rebounds (6.1) and assists (7.5) last year to carry the team in a difficult season where coach Kevin McHale was fired after just 11 games and the Rockets took a step back after reaching the Western Conference finals in 2015. With Howard gone, Harden is now the undisputed leader.\n\nOUTLOOK: Harden should thrive in D'Antoni's fast-paced offense and should be helped by Anderson, a solid outside shooter who led the NBA with 166 3-pointers in the 2011-12 season. The question is if Capela will be able to make up for the loss of Howard. If he doesn't show he can, Houston may go with the veteran Nene. Either way, it seems unlikely that the Rockets can compete with the West's elite teams.\n\nMEMPHIS GRIZZLIES\n\nLAST SEASON: 42-40, lost in Western Conference quarterfinals.\n\nCOACH: David Fizdale (first season, first NBA season).\n\nPROJECTED STARTING FIVE: C Marc Gasol (16.6 ppg), F JaMychal Green (7.4 ppg), F Chandler Parsons (13.7 ppg), G Mike Conley (15.3 ppg), G Tony Allen (8.1 ppg).\n\nADDED: G Chandler Parsons, F James Ennis, G Troy Daniels, G Wade Baldwin, C Deyonta Davis.\n\nLOST: G Lance Stephenson, F Matt Barnes, C Chris Andersen, G Jordan Farmar, G P.J. Hairston, G Xavier Munford.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH: Gasol. The former defensive player of the year was limited to 52 games last season after breaking the navicular bone in his right foot. The 7-foot-1, 255-pound Gasol had surgery to repair his foot and missed the Rio Olympics to ensure he would be healthy for the season.\n\nOUTLOOK: The Grizzlies will seek to extend their streak of playoff appearances to seven only San Antonio and Atlanta have longer current runs. Fizdale's experience as Miami's top assistant earned him instant credibility and trust. He shifted Zach Randolph from the starting lineup to a reserve role, and hopes to keep the Grizzlies' aging core fresh for the postseason by limiting regular-season minutes.\n\nNEW ORLEANS PELICANS\n\nLAST SEASON: 30-52, missed playoffs.\n\nCOACH: Alvin Gentry (second season, 14th NBA season).\n\nPROJECTED STARTING FIVE: F Anthony Davis (24.3 ppg), F Solomon Hill (4.2 ppg), C Omer Asik (6.1 rpg), G E'Twaun Moore (7.5 ppg), G Tim Frazier (5.1 ppg).\n\nADDED: Hill, Moore, G Buddy Hield, G Langston Galloway, F Terrence Jones, F Lance Stephenson, Cheick Diallo.\n\nLOST: G Eric Gordon, F Ryan Anderson, G Norris Cole, C Kendrick Perkins, F Luke Babbitt, G Toney Douglas.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH: Davis. A three-time All-Star who will be trying to mesh with a host of new regulars at nearly every position after averaging 10.3 rebounds and two blocks per game last season.\n\nOUTLOOK: The Pelicans are hoping to climb back into playoff contentions for the second time in three seasons, but there are many unknowns that could tip the balance either way. It's unclear when or how well Tyreke Evans and Quincy Pondexter will return from prolonged rehabilitation from knee operations. It's also not clear how long starting guard Jrue Holiday will be on leave to care for his wife, former women's soccer star Lauren Holiday, who recently gave birth and is being treated for a brain tumor.\n\nSAN ANTONIO SPURS\n\nLAST SEASON: 67-15, lost in Western Conference semifinals.\n\nCOACH: Gregg Popovich (21st season, 21st NBA season).\n\nPROJECTED STARTERS: F LaMarcus Aldridge (18.0 ppg), F Kawhi Leonard (21.2 ppg), C Pau Gasol (16.5 ppg), G Danny Green (7.2 ppg), G Tony Parker (11.9 ppg).\n\nADDED: Gasol, C Dewayne Dedmon, F-C David Lee, C Joel Anthony, F Davis Bertans, G Dejounte Murray.\n\nLOST: F Tim Duncan, F-C David West, F Boris Diaw, F Matt Bonner, C Boban Marjanovic, G Andre Miller, G Kevin Martin.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH: Leonard. His emergence enabled the Spurs to evolve from their reliance on the Big Three of Duncan, Parker and Manu Ginobili. Duncan's retirement puts even greater pressure on Leonard, who Popovich labeled as the future face of the franchise in 2012. Leonard responded last season with career-highs in points, assists and 3-point shooting (44 percent), but now the Spurs need his leadership to emerge.\n\nOUTLOOK: The Spurs still have a veteran presence with Parker, Ginobili, Gasol and Green, but they have revamped their roster to feature more youth and athleticism. Gasol's presence will almost certainly help fill the Duncan void.\n\nNORTHWEST DIVISION\n\nDENVER NUGGETS\n\nLAST SEASON: 33-49, missed playoffs.\n\nCOACH: Michael Malone (second season, fourth NBA season).\n\nPROJECTED STARTING FIVE: G Emmanuel Mudiay (12.8 ppg), G Gary Harris (12.3 ppg), F Danilo Gallinari (19.5 ppg), F Nikola Jokic (10.0 ppg), C Jusuf Nurkic (8.3 ppg).\n\nADDED: G Jamal Murray, F Juancho Hernangomez, G Malik Beasley.\n\nLOST: G D.J. Augustin, C Joffrey Lauvergne.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH: Murray. The 6-foot-4 sharpshooter gives the Nuggets another much-needed outside threat. Murray made 113 3-pointers at Kentucky last season, the second-most by a freshman in NCAA history behind only Stephen Curry (122). He should pair nicely with Mudiay, the seventh overall pick in 2015.\n\nOUTLOOK: This team will be tricky when they play their big men, Jokic and Nurkic, at the same time. Mudiay has an improved jumper and a year of experience. And Wilson Chandler returns after hip surgery sidelined him all last season. For this team to get back to the postseason, it must drain outside shots more consistently. That's a big reason why Murray was selected, with hopes he can take some pressure off Gallinari.\n\nMINNESOTA TIMBERWOLVES\n\nLAST SEASON: 29-53, missed playoffs.\n\nCOACH: Tom Thibodeau (first season, sixth NBA season).\n\nPROJECTED STARTING FIVE: PG Ricky Rubio (10.1 ppg), SG Zach LaVine (14.0 ppg), SF Andrew Wiggins (20.7 ppg), PF Gorgui Dieng (10.1 ppg), C Karl-Anthony Towns (18.3 ppg).\n\nADDED: PG Kris Dunn, C Cole Aldrich, SG/SF Brandon Rush, F Jordan Hill.\n\nLOST: F Kevin Garnett, F Tayshaun Prince, F Damjan Rudez, F Greg Smith.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH: Towns. The reigning rookie of the year put together one of the best rookie seasons in more than two decades after being drafted No. 1 overall out of Kentucky. He garnered some All-NBA consideration as a center last year and has taken the torch from Garnett with a mission to restore pride in a downtrodden franchise.\n\nOUTLOOK: The talent is there. Alas, so is youth. With Towns, Wiggins and LaVine, the Wolves will likely start three 21-year-olds, but the hope is the youngsters will blossom under Thibodeau's hard-driving leadership. If Wiggins can make the leap in his third season and Rubio adds improved shooting to his playmaking and defensive prowess, these Wolves could make it to the playoffs and end a 12-year postseason drought.\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY THUNDER\n\nLAST SEASON: 55-27, lost in Western Conference finals.\n\nCOACH: Billy Donovan (second season, second NBA season).\n\nPROJECTED STARTING FIVE: F Andre Roberson (4.8 ppg), F Domantas Sabonis (rookie), C Steven Adams (8.0 ppg), G Russell Westbrook (23.5 ppg.), G Victor Oladipo (17.4 ppg).\n\nADDED: Oladipo, Sabonis, F/C Joffrey Lauvergne, F Ersan Ilyasova, G Ronnie Price, G/F Alex Abrines, G Reggie Williams.\n\nLOST: F Kevin Durant, F Serge Ibaka, G Dion Waiters.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH: Westbrook. He's a former scoring champion and two-time All-Star MVP who no longer has to share the spotlight with Durant. Westbrook had 18 triple-doubles last season, the most since Magic Johnson had 18 in 1981-82. He averaged career-highs of 10.4 assists and 7.8 rebounds last season, and there's no telling what he'll do this season.\n\nOUTLOOK: Oklahoma City should still be a danger. The Thunder added Oladipo in the offseason, a player nearly as athletic as Westbrook, to play shooting guard. Adams emerged as a legitimate scoring threat during last year's playoffs. Enes Kanter, a key reserve, will have a greater role. Sabonis is versatile and mature beyond his years.\n\nPORTLAND TRAIL BLAZERS\n\nLAST SEASON: 44-38, lost in Western Conference semifinals.\n\nCOACH: Terry Stotts (fifth season, ninth NBA season).\n\nPROJECTED STARTING FIVE: G Damian Lillard (25.1 ppg), G CJ McCollum (20.8 ppg), F Maurice Harkless (6.4 ppg), F Al-Farouq Aminu (10.2 ppg), C Mason Plumlee (9.1 ppg).\n\nADDED: G Shabazz Napier, F Evan Turner, C Festus Ezeli.\n\nLOST: G Gerald Henderson, G Brian Roberts, C Chris Kaman.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH: Lillard. His scoring and assist averages have gone up with each season, and last year he averaged 25.1 points and 6.8 assists. Only two players reached 50 points in multiple regular-season games last year Stephen Curry did it three times for Golden State, and Lillard did it twice.\n\nOUTLOOK: The Lillard-McCollum pairing is probably as good as almost any other 1-2 punch in the NBA. Portland looks to build on its success of last season, but the Blazers and all the other teams in the West will have difficulty overcoming the Warriors. The Blazers might have been considered a surprise last season. More success won't surprise anyone this season, though the Blazers open with a tough stretch of 18 of their first 30 games being on the road.\n\nUTAH JAZZ\n\nLAST SEASON: 40-42, missed playoffs.\n\nCOACH: Quin Snyder (third season, third NBA season)\n\nPROJECTED STARTING FIVE: F Gordon Hayward (19.7 ppg), F Derrick Favors (16.4 ppg), C Rudy Gobert (9.1 ppg), G Rodney Hood (14.5 ppg), G George Hill (12.1 ppg).\n\nADDED: Hill, F Joe Johnson, F Boris Diaw.\n\nLOST: G Trey Burke, F Trevor Booker.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH: Hayward. The seventh-year forward should be in his prime after playing at a borderline All-Star level the last two seasons. He added muscle during the offseason and worked on playing at his own pace. Hayward is expected to exercise his player option to become a free agent after the season, so both he and the team are looking to make an impression.\n\nOUTLOOK: It's playoffs-or-bust for the Jazz. The organization spent the last several seasons slowly rebuilding a roster with young talent and allowing it to grow without the addition of veterans who could stunt that development. Now it's time to reap the benefits. The Jazz added veterans in Hill, Johnson and Diaw understanding that depth and experience is needed to reach the postseason for the first time since 2012.\n\nPACIFIC DIVISION\n\nGOLDEN STATE WARRIORS\n\nLAST SEASON: 73-9, lost NBA Finals.\n\nCOACH: Steve Kerr (third season, third NBA season).\n\nPROJECTED STARTING FIVE: G Stephen Curry (30.1 ppg), F Kevin Durant (28.2 ppg), F Draymond Green (14.0 ppg), G Klay Thompson (22.1 ppg), C Zaza Pachulia (8.6 ppg).\n\nADDED: Durant, Pachulia, F David West, G Patrick McCaw.\n\nLOST: C Andrew Bogut, F Festus Ezeli, C Marreese Speights, F Harrison Barnes.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH: Take your pick from two-time NBA MVP Curry, All-Stars and Olympians Durant, Green, Thompson, new center Pachulia or defensive menace and high-flying scoring threat Andre Iguodala or Shaun Livingston coming off a deep bench that gives Kerr so many lineup options. The Warriors are loaded.\n\nOUTLOOK: Even with Durant joining Curry, Thompson and Green, the Warriors realize it might take time to get in sync. And as much as the 73-wins record meant to Golden State last season, the Warriors would rather bring home another championship after falling just short against LeBron James and Cleveland in Game 7 at home. Curry probably won't top his record 402 3-pointers either given Durant will now take some of his shots. Watch Nov. 3 the first time Durant faces his former Oklahoma City team.\n\nLOS ANGELES CLIPPERS\n\nLAST SEASON: 53-29, lost in Western Conference quarterfinals.\n\nCOACH: Doc Rivers (fourth season, 21st NBA season).\n\nPROJECTED STARTING FIVE: F Blake Griffin (21.4 ppg), G Chris Paul (19.5 ppg), C DeAndre Jordan (12.7 ppg), G J.J. Redick (16.3 ppg), F Luc Mbah a Moute (3.1 ppg).\n\nADDED: F-G Alan Anderson, F Brandon Bass, G Raymond Felton, F Brice Johnson, F-C Marreese Speights, C Diamond Stone.\n\nLOST: C Cole Aldrich, F Jeff Ayres, F Branden Dawson, F Jeff Green, G Pablo Prigioni, G C.J. Wilcox.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH: Griffin. Heads into his sixth season together with Paul still looking to get past the second round of the playoffs. Griffin missed 41 games last season with a left quadriceps injury that he re-aggravated in the team's first-round playoff exit. He also was suspended four games after breaking his hand while punching a former staff member.\n\nOUTLOOK: This could be the last go-round together for Griffin, Paul and big man Jordan if they don't make a deep playoff run. Paul and Griffin will be free agents at season's end, while Jordan has two years remaining and Paul Pierce is playing his final season. A complete roster revamp seems likely unless the team finally produces.\n\nLOS ANGELES LAKERS\n\nLAST SEASON: 17-65, missed playoffs.\n\nCOACH: Luke Walton (first season, first NBA season).\n\nPROJECTED STARTING FIVE: F Julius Randle (11.3 ppg), F Luol Deng (12.3 ppg), C Timofey Mozgov (6.3 ppg), G D'Angelo Russell (13.2 ppg), G Jordan Clarkson (15.5 ppg).\n\nADDED: Deng, Mozgov, F Brandon Ingram, C Ivica Zubac, G Jose Calderon, F Yi Jianlian, F Thomas Robinson.\n\nLOST: G Kobe Bryant, F Brandon Bass, C Roy Hibbert, C Robert Sacre, F Ryan Kelly.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH: Russell. With Bryant's retirement, control of the Lakers' offense belongs to the point guard who showed glimpses of his ample potential during his rocky rookie season. Walton expects the 20-year-old to improve his shot selection while ramping up his playmaking in an up-tempo offense. The Lakers' future is tied to Russell's continued development into an elite NBA player.\n\nOUTLOOK: After the three worst seasons in team history and Kobe's departure, the 16-time champion franchise is starting over with a new coach and a young, intriguing roster. The new mix seems highly unlikely to yield an immediate return to the playoffs, but the Lakers are hoping Russell, Randle and Ingram will be the core of an eventual contender.\n\nPHOENIX SUNS\n\nLAST SEASON: 23-59, missed playoffs.\n\nCOACH: Earl Watson (second season, second NBA season).\n\nPROJECTED STARTING FIVE: F P.J. Tucker (8.0 ppg), F Jared Dudley (7.9 ppg), C Tyson Chandler (7.2 ppg), G Devin Booker (13.8 ppg), G Eric Bledsoe (20.4 ppg).\n\nADDED: Dudley, G Leandro Barbosa, F Marquese Chriss, F Dragan Bender, G Tyler Ulis.\n\nLOST: F Mirza Teletovic, F Jon Leuer, G Ronnie Price.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH: Booker. NBA general managers voted the young guard as their pick to be this season's \"breakout\" player. LeBron James picked Booker as the under-the-radar player most likely to develop into a superstar. So the pressure is on for the 6-foot-6 guard to live up to those lofty expectations. He made the all-rookie team last season.\n\nOUTLOOK: After a dismal, injury-plagued season, the Suns went young with the drafting of Bender and Chriss early in the first round and added stabilizing veterans in Dudley and Barbosa. The raw but marvelously athletic Chriss was impressive in the preseason. The strength of this team is the backcourt of Bledsoe, Booker and sixth man Brandon Knight. But the West is loaded, so a tough season may await.\n\nSACRAMENTO KINGS\n\nLAST SEASON: 33-49, missed playoffs.\n\nCOACH: Dave Joerger (first season, fourth NBA season).\n\nPROJECTED STARTING FIVE: F DeMarcus Cousins (26.9 ppg), F Rudy Gay (17.2 ppg), C Willie Cauley-Stein (7.0 ppg), G Arron Afflalo (12.8 ppg), F Darren Collison (14.0 ppg).\n\nADDED: Afflalo, G Ty Lawson, F Matt Barnes, G Isaiah Cousins, F Skal Labissiere, C George Papagiannis, G Malachi Richardson, G Garrett Temple, F Anthony Tolliver.\n\nLOST: G Rajon Rondo, G Marco Belinelli, G Seth Curry, F Quincy Acy.\n\nPLAYER TO WATCH: Cousins. The talented but temperamental big man added the 3-point shot to his repertoire last season, making 70 out of 210 after hitting only 11 his first five seasons. The Kings hope the experience of winning an Olympic gold medal will help him become an even better team player after years of feuding with coaches.\n\nOUTLOOK: With a new defensive-minded coach and a fancy downtown arena, the Kings enter the season with a positive outlook after missing the playoffs for 10 straight seasons. But the roster still lacks impact players beyond Cousins. Finding pieces to build around with Cousins is the first step needed before the team can think of getting back to the playoffs."
