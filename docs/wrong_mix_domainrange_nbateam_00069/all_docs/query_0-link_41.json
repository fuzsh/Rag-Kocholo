        "text": "As free agents small forwards Caron Butler and Josh Howard are expected to meet with the San Antonio Spurs tomorrow and the small forward list growing to seven candidates, the Spurs have finally been linked to a center.\n\nAccording to Yahoo’s Adrian Wojnarowski’s tweet, the Spurs are keeping a close eye on Los Angeles Clippers’ Chris Kaman and his future with the team.\n\nSpurs, Pistons keeping close check on Chris Kaman, but Clippers won’t move him until resolution on restricted free agent DeAndre Jordan.\n\nThough he was injured for most of the season, Kaman, 29-years old and a one time All-star, played in 32 games while averaging 26 minutes, 12.4 points per game, seven rebounds, 47% shooting, and 1.5 blocks per game with the Clippers.\n\nKaman’s best season was in the 2009-2010 NBA season when averaged 18 points and nine rebounds per game.\n\nThe trouble with this is that the Clippers are in bind as they are currently interested in putting a package together to acquire either Dwight Howard of the Orlando Magic or Chris Paul of the New Orleans Hornets. DeAndre Jordan could potentially be a sign-and-trade chip in such a deal as could Kaman’s one year, 12.7 million dollar contract.\n\nBut will the Spurs be willing to take on Kaman’s contract knowing they do not currently have much salary-cap wiggle-room?\n\nRegardless, Kaman would help answer the Spurs’ big man situation and paired with Tim Duncan in the paint would form a nice duo. Not to mention, Kaman could relieve TD for long periods of time on the court and be adequate to play a full game should Popovich decide to rest Duncan on one of those dreaded back-to-back-to-back stretch of games in the shortened season.\n\nOne positive to look at over the summer was the fact Kaman looked healthy when playing for Germany in the 2011 FIBA Eurobasket."
