        "text": "The door to the visiting locker room burst open and Carlos Maples, the Lakers’ longtime equipment manager, charged through.\n\n“Nash!” he said. “You’ve gotta get dressed.”\n\nSteve Nash, two days away from his 40th birthday and at the tail end of his Hall of Fame career, was in street clothes, feasting on a smorgasbord of pizza, chicken wings and other concession-stand snacks. He and the rest of the injured Lakers were waiting out the final minutes of that night’s game in Cleveland and stuffing their faces.\n\n“He was like, ‘Shit, are you serious?’” Maples remembered.\n\nNash jumped up, and Maples began to tear through a duffel bag stuffed with uniforms that was already packed for the next city. Maples rummaged wildly until he emerged with Nash’s purple No. 10.\n\nNash slipped into uniform and sprung into action.\n\n“I remember him running out there,” Maples said. “Shoes barely even tied. We looked kind of crazy.”\n\nWhat happens when an NBA team runs out of eligible players? In the history of basketball, that’s a question that has not been often asked. The situation has only happened to two teams — twice for the injury-riddled Golden State Warriors in 2010 and then that fateful night in Cleveland, when the combination of a pair of Lakers getting hurt and two more fouling out would have, if not for an obscure rule, forced Nash into action.\n\nOne Laker scored his career high. Another broke his knee. And, most famously of all, a third Laker unintentionally launched a viral meme that served as the lasting image of a bad-luck season.\n\nThat game, one of the strangest in NBA history, might also be viewed as a case study for the moment in which the NBA now finds itself.\n\n“We were the guinea pigs, I guess,” laughed Dan D’Antoni, a former Lakers assistant and the older brother of then-head coach Mike D’Antoni.\n\nAs the league forces its way through a pandemic, teams are navigating a rash of postponements and forced to play with rosters ravaged by positive COVID-19 tests and contact tracing. Last weekend, the Philadelphia 76ers took the floor against the Denver Nuggets with the league-minimum eight players available, including one, Mike Scott, who was injured and was not going to play.\n\n“Dwight Howard is going to play point guard tonight,” Sixers coach Doc Rivers joked.\n\nWesley Johnson was at home in New Orleans last weekend when he heard Rivers describe the bleak state of his roster.\n\n“I was like, shit,” the former Lakers forward said. “That was our situation.”\n\nJason Phillips was going through his final preparations on the court at Quicken Loans Arena on Feb. 5, 2014. The veteran referee scanned the active players list for both the Lakers and Cavaliers. Then he glanced at the small throng of Lakers warming up.\n\nHe turned to a Lakers staffer.\n\n“Hey, you still got guys in the back, right, that are coming out?” he asked.\n\n“Nope, that’s it for tonight,” came the reply.\n\nThe Lakers would go on to lead the NBA that season in total games missed due to injury. Fourteen players would miss a combined 319 games. Kobe Bryant, a year removed from rupturing his left Achilles the previous spring, missed all but six games after suffering a fractured knee in December, and Nash missed 65. But the injuries were pervasive throughout the roster.\n\nThe night before, in a loss in Minnesota, starting center Jordan Hill had strained a muscle in his neck. Jodie Meeks sprained an ankle. Starting point guard Steve Blake, in his first game back after missing the previous 26 with a torn ligament in his elbow, suffered a ruptured ear drum.\n\nOf the three, only Blake would play against the Cavs. That left the Lakers with eight players. The Athletic reached out to each of those eight for this story. Five of them agreed to be interviewed.\n\n“I remember being in pregame and we just looked at each other and were like, well, this is our team,” said Robert Sacre, who started at center and, fittingly, would become the central figure in the night’s events. “Let’s go out there and play.”\n\nThe Lakers entered the game on a seven-game losing streak and had lost 13 of their last 15 games. They were on their way to a 27-win season, the worst record in franchise history, and were the first of six straight Lakers teams to fail to qualify for the playoffs. Mike D’Antoni’s team entered the night at 16-32, just like the lowly Cavs, who had not recovered from losing LeBron James four years earlier and did not know they were five months away from getting him back.\n\nEven with their short bench, the Lakers started hot, including 15 first-quarter points from Johnson. Then, in the second quarter, their lead ballooned to 29 points.\n\n“We went on a crazy run,” Sacre said. “It was like, ‘We’re gonna win this game. Nice!’ And they just kept subbing new guys, new guys and we were like, ‘Well, we don’t have all these new guys to sub in the same way they are.’”\n\nWith 2:21 left in the second period, Nick Young twisted his left knee after a hard foul by C.J. Miles. Young stayed in the game until halftime, but that injury — later diagnosed as a fractured patella that would keep him out of the next 17 games — was actually the first domino to fall.\n\nThe Lakers were suddenly down to seven players who were somehow still getting it done. Through three quarters, rookie Ryan Kelly scored 22 points on his way to a career-high 26.\n\n“Ryan Kelly had the game of the year,” Sacre said.\n\nIt was a strange night to record a career high, but said Kelly, who is playing this season for the Sun Rockers Shibuya in Japan, “The good news is for more than one reason I’ll never forget it.”\n\nThat’s because the real weird stuff hadn’t even happened yet.\n\nJordan Farmar, the former UCLA star in his second stint with the Lakers after winning two championships alongside Bryant several years earlier, was on the court for the first time in more than a month after tearing his left hamstring for the second time that season. With only one other guard, Blake, available for the Lakers, Farmar blew through his minutes restriction and was piecing together a nice game with 21 points and eight assists.\n\nBut with 9:47 left, he missed a layup and reached for his left calf upon landing.\n\nHis night was over.\n\nThe Lakers then had six players.\n\nThe Cavaliers, meanwhile, had climbed back into the game, pulling within 10 after a 3-pointer by Miles.\n\n“We all looked at each other like, ‘What’s next?'” Sacre said.\n\nWhat was next was Chris Kaman fouling out.\n\nThe veteran center, who had been an All-Star earlier in his career, amassed six fouls in just 14 minutes, the last of them coming with 8:29 remaining when he barreled through Anderson Varejao in an overeager attempt to get out to defend an open 3-pointer.\n\nSacre, the last man on the Lakers’ bench, checked in with four fouls.\n\nAt that time, minds began to wander to the possibility of what would happen if he went the way of Kaman. Or if there was, knock on wood, another injury.\n\n“Some of us definitely thought that we would have to play five-on-four, like if he were to foul out,” Kelly said. “I don’t know if anybody had experienced anything like that or seen anything like that.”\n\nThe second-year center made it nearly five minutes without committing a foul. That was a dam that had to break at some point, however, and with 4:03 left, Sacre hacked rookie Anthony Bennett.\n\nThe Lakers called timeout to figure out what was going on. Sacre had one more foul left, then he would have presumably been disqualified.\n\nPhillips, the lead referee, went over to the Lakers’ bench to check with D’Antoni.\n\n“I can’t remember exactly what he said,” Phillips said, “but he came up with a quippy remark about basically don’t call any more fouls on my guys because I don’t have any more guys.\n\n“And I said, ‘Well, Mike, I would prefer you just talk to your guys about that and not put me in that position.’”\n\nAround this time, Gary Vitti, the longtime trainer who won eight championships with the franchise before retiring in 2016, instructed Maples, who would stay with the organization until 2018, to go summon Nash.\n\nAlthough Nash did not start the night in uniform, he was technically on the active list. But Nash was still prohibited from playing back-to-backs and had logged 25 minutes in Minnesota.\n\n“What was happening with Steve at that point, he could play. We could get him to play,” Vitti said. “It’s just that, after he played, he needed like a week to recover. So here we are in an extraordinary set of circumstances, and it took an extraordinary amount of preparation to get him ready to play.”\n\nA moment’s notice and the slice of pizza getting cold back in the locker room hardly qualified as detailed preparation for the meticulous Nash.\n\n“You see Steve running from the back like he was Superman,” Johnson said, “rip off his warmups.”\n\nNash ran to the bench and joined the Lakers’ huddle.\n\n“We see Steve just appear,” Johnson said. “And we’re like, ‘What are you doing?’ He goes, ‘I’m gonna check in,’ and we’re like, ‘Hell no. Go to the back.’ And he was laughing. D’Antoni was like, ‘Steve get out of here.’ He shooed him away.”\n\nSacre had one foul left.\n\n“It was definitely, ‘Bobby, don’t foul,'” Kelly said.\n\nBobby fouled.\n\nOn the very next possession, he moved laterally toward the block to cut off the baseline for the Cavs’ Miles.\n\nChirp!\n\n“My last foul was garbage,” Sacre said. “It was B.S. It was straight-up B.S. I know I didn’t foul anybody, but it is what it is. It’s a call. I just remember after that call I didn’t know what was going to happen after that.”\n\nMike D’Antoni certainly didn’t know what would happen next.\n\n“I remember him asking on the bench and nobody on the bench knew either,” Dan D’Antoni said.\n\nThe crew of officials huddled for a long time before Phillips went over to talk to Mike D’Antoni.\n\n“What do I do now?” the coach asked.\n\nPhillips explained that if the Lakers did not have a fifth player to sub in, then the team would be assessed a technical foul and Sacre could stay in the game. Any additional fouls by Sacre would also earn technical fouls.\n\n“I tell you what,” Dan D’Antoni said, “it probably made everybody, especially Mike, a better coach. Because he couldn’t mess up substituting anybody.”\n\nOn ESPN, retired referee Steve Javie said, “I know the officials on the floor are probably scratching their heads, and that’s why you’ve got to get their three heads together and try to get this right. Because I know they’ve never seen this before either. Really, really crazy situation.”\n\nWhat were Mike D’Antoni’s options? He later said he considered letting Farmar, with his injured calf, stand in the corner under strict orders not to move. He was never going to go to Nash in that situation, even though by rule he would have technically been eligible.\n\nSo Sacre stayed in.\n\n“I played basketball since I was four years old,” Farmar said, “and I never knew you could play with less guys and just take a technical.”\n\nSaid Johnson: “That was something that they made up. That’s in no rule book.”\n\nBut there is a rule. It is, in fact, NBA Rule No. 3, Section I (a): If a player in the game receives his sixth personal foul and all substitutes have already been dis-qualified, said player shall remain in the game and shall be charged with a personal and team foul. A technical foul also shall be assessed against his team.\n\nAny additional fouls by Sacre would receive another technical, which could get Cleveland back in the game quickly.\n\n“I remember Dion Waiters was like, ‘I’m coming at you,’” Sacre said. “And I was like, ‘Oh my goodness. Time to move your feet, boy.’”\n\nThese were about to be the most treacherous four minutes of Sacre’s career.\n\n“He was the kind of guy who threw his body around, and he fouled a lot,” Vitti said. “So you’ve got a guy who fouls a lot in a game where the one thing you don’t want to do is foul.”\n\nBy this point, Kaman had gotten pretty comfortable having the Lakers’ bench all to himself. Seven-footers occupy a world designed by shorter people, and it’s not often they have so much room to stretch out and relax.\n\n“During timeouts,” Phillips said, “you’re looking over there and there’s the coaching staff and then there’s this wide gap of like four or five chairs with nobody in it. It was an odd feeling.”\n\nIn one of those timeouts, Kaman quipped that there was enough room for him to lie down.\n\n“Chris being the cat that he is, he’s like, ‘There’s nobody on the bench,'” Johnson said. “I’m looking. He’s cracking up like, ‘This is the craziest shit I’ve ever been part of.'”\n\nAnd then Johnson returned to the court and didn’t see Kaman lean back, cross his arms across his chest and appear to take a nap.\n\n“The fact that a 7-footer can lie flat on the bench and not bump into anybody is just crazy,” said Blake, who recorded his second career triple-double in the game.\n\n“It was literally just a split second as a joke,” Kelly said, “but obviously the camera’s always on.”\n\nThe memes flew.\n\nKaman was photoshopped into a scene from Sleeping Beauty and onto the table at The Last Supper. One had him getting pinned by The Undertaker. Young Simba tried to bring him back to life as though Kaman had just been trampled by a stampeding herd of wildebeest.\n\nThe image surfaced again two seasons ago, when LeBron James left a suspiciously large gap on the bench between himself and the rest of his Lakers teammates. It was just enough space to squeeze in a sleeping Chris Kaman.\n\n“It was probably a two-second thing that they got just a glimpse of,” Farmar said, “and they made it a screen shot and it was over after that.”\n\nOf course, few players realized this moment had even occurred until later.\n\n“When you’re in the game and you’re actually playing and you’re a professional athlete,” Farmar said, “you’re not thinking about all the funny shit that’s going on around you or how something can be perceived. But I think it started hitting everybody shortly after the game.”\n\nKaman declined to be interviewed for this story. (I’d be lying down on the job if I didn’t mention that.)\n\nNot everyone found it funny.\n\nVitti told Kaman he was embarrassing himself and the team.\n\n“We were on a losing streak,” Vitti said. “We were beat up, we were losing and it was a sign of apathy to go and lay on the bench like that. And you can’t have that.”\n\nYears later, after Magic Johnson and Rob Pelinka had been brought in to clean up four years of losing, ESPN’s Ramona Shelburne reported that the incident had been seen as an embarrassment inside the organization, and that owner Jeanie Buss had dealt with “fallout from both corporate partners and league officials.”\n\n“That really was kind of a microcosm for our season though,” Kelly said, “just trying to piece together enough bodies to get through it.”\n\nSacre played the final 3:32 without committing another foul. Cleveland pulled within six with 1:17 left, but Blake answered with a 3-pointer that gave him that second career triple-double. The Lakers won 119-108.\n\nThe next day, the Cavaliers fired their general manager, Chris Grant.\n\n“Just one of those crazy nights that just seems like could be more feasible going forward,” Blake said.\n\nSince the 76ers played with seven players on Jan. 9, losing to the Nuggets 115-103, the NBA has postponed nine games, a number that will almost certainly grow. On Wednesday, the league announced 16 players had tested positive for the coronavirus since Jan. 6.\n\n“It kind of seemed like they played that one game and since then have been postponing more games,” Kelly said, “because it’s really difficult to play and compete with that few number of guys. With the risk of injury and more minutes and all the different factors, it’s hard.”\n\nIf any team does find itself at risk of falling below the threshold for eligible players during a game, they can look back to Feb. 5, 2014, for guidance.\n\n“You’re a little more prepared this season knowing something like that (could happen),” Dan D’Antoni said. “We were blindsided.”\n\nBut it wasn’t all bad.\n\nAsked what he would tell a player playing on such a shorthanded team, Kelly, whose 26 points still stand as his NBA career high, said this:\n\n“Well, as you saw with me, you might as well fire it up. Because there aren’t many people that can come in and sub for you.”\n\n(Photo of Chris Kaman: Mark Duncan / Associated Press Photo)"
