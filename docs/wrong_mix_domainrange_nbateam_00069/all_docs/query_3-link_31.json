        "text": "Jodie-Meeks-Stan-Van-Gundy.jpg\n\nJodie Meeks is one of five free agents Detroit Pistons president/coach Stan Van Gundy has signed.\n\n(Brendan Savage | MLive.com)\n\nIt's going to take more than a couple of free-agent signings to revive the Detroit Pistons, according to Detroit Free Press columnist Drew Sharp.\n\nThe Pistons signed shooting guard Jodie Meeks, swing man Caron Butler and point guard D.J. Augustin to help upgrade their offense. All are solid outside shooters who are expected to help improve the perimeter shooting that has been lacking the last several seasons.\n\nThey also added role players Cartier Martin and Aaron Gray.\n\nMeeks was the top player among those five but Sharp wasn't impressed with his signing.\n\nNot one bit, in fact.\n\n\"Such news is more deserving of a coroner than a coronation,\" Sharp wrote. \"But it taps into the utter desperation of an egregiously flawed franchise still fooling itself into believing that it's potentially just a couple of pieces away from returning to the playoffs. While other Eastern Conference teams are advancing forward — some more significantly than others — the Pistons have effectively flatlined.\n\n\"They're a pulseless corpse.\"\n\nDoesn't sound like he's impressed, eh?\n\n• Detroit Free Press: While Sharp didn't think much of the Meeks signing, colleague Shawn Windsor – in a counterpoint piece – believes Stan Van Gundy's rebuilding effort is off to a good start. \"Meeks is here to spread the floor and give the big guys some room. Caron Butler is here to guide the young guys and hit a few shots. DJ Augustin arrives to back up Jennings. It's called depth. Get enough guys who care in a room and you've got something. Van Gundy isn't trying to win the title next season. He is trying to change the culture and extract more from the talent he inherited. There is value in that.\"\n\n• FoxSportsDetroit.com: Is Van Gundy using the same game plan he employed when he guided the Orlando Magic to the 2009 NBA Finals? Dave Hogg thinks so. \"As Van Gundy predicted last month, the Pistons have a free-agent class made up of high-character guys who know the role they are here to fill. There probably isn't an All-Star in the group, but they are exactly the type of players that Van Gundy put around Dwight Howard in Orlando, and he's planning to do the same with Andre Drummond in Detroit.\"\n\n• The Oakland Press: There are at least seven former players from Detroit's four pro teams who are worthy of making the Hall of Fame in their respective players and Ben Wallace is one of them, writes Pat Caputo. \"Time should be kind to Big Ben. He was 34th all-time in rebounding, 15th in blocked shots and won the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year award four times. He also was the key piece to the puzzle on an NBA championship team, the 2004 Pistons. So he couldn't shoot free throws? Who cares?\"\n\n• Detroit Free Press: With LeBron James heading home to play for the Cleveland Cavaliers, EliteDaily.com put together a list of what each NBA team's starting five would look like if it were composed of all local players and James Jahnke offered his thoughts. \"The Pistons might struggle to make the playoffs. The Pistons would have Detroit natives Jordan Crawford and Chris Douglas-Roberts in the backcourt, Saginaw's Draymond Green and Kenyon Martin at forward and Wyoming's Chris Kaman down low. Not terrible, but we'd take the Pistons' current starting five over that one.\"\n\n-- Download the Detroit Pistons on MLive app for iPhone and Android"
