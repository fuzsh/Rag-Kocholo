        "text": "MEMPHIS -- Trail Blazers' backup big man Chris Kaman has been ruled out for the team's Saturday night matchup at the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nKaman strained his right shoulder in the first half of the Blazers' Friday night loss at the Orlando Magic, an injury that forced him to sit out the second half. After the game, Kaman said he did not know how he suffered the injury.\n\nKaman, who is averaging 8.7 points and 6.6 rebounds in 64 games, is the Blazers' most experienced and most effective post player off the bench.\n\nJoel Freeland and Meyers Leonard most likely will see increased playing time in Kaman's absence."
