        "text": "Dwight Howard had 22 points and 15 rebounds, and the Orlando Magic rolled past the Los Angeles Clippers, 113-87 on Tuesday night to tie a season high with their sixth straight victory.\n\nJameer Nelson had 17 points and Rashard Lewis added 15 to help the Magic take a 26-point halftime lead and cruise to a blowout after beating the Lakers in an NBA finals rematch Sunday.\n\nBaron Davis fought through a stomach illness that forced him to miss the Clippers' morning shootaround. He came off the bench to finish with 16 points, and Chris Kaman added 12 as Los Angeles lost for the sixth time in the last seven games.\n\nThe Clippers announced Tuesday that Mike Dunleavy and the team parted company for good, barely a month after he relinquished his head coaching duties to focus solely on being general manager.\n\nThe Magic were trying to muster whatever energy they had left after a big win against the Lakers in a bruising battle two days earlier.\n\nThey had plenty.\n\nLos Angeles' other team didn't take as much effort or offer as much talent to slow down Orlando. The Clippers had little intensity and allowed the Magic to put this one away early, turning things into a highlight show.\n\nIt was hardly a shocker that Howard led the way -- except for the way he did.\n\nSure, Howard had his blocks, swatting one of Drew Gooden's shots into the seats near the Clippers' bench. And he had his dunks, hustling on one play to beat Kaman down court and finish with a two-handed slam.\n\nBut his ballhandling skills?\n\nThe All-Star center took a rebound and led a fast break late in the second quarter. He made a quick dribble down the lane before he dished to Brandon Bass for a dunk."
