        "text": "Phoenix just showed a lot more interest, overall, and definitely in how they negotiated. I don't know what New Orleans' plans are for me. There are no negotiations right now.\n\nThey drafted another shooting guard, a combo guard like me, which tells me they have another plan.\n\nThe interest wasn't there. I have to move on, and I'm just a basketball player at the end of the day. Wherever I'm at, I just have to play ball. But right now, it's going to be for the Phoenix Suns.\n\nMy patience is not high. Would yours be, especially when I'm a big proponent of greatness surrounding itself with greatness? All these [Team USA] guys seem to have great players around them.\n\nIt's tough seeing all these guys that are young and older who have all played in the playoffs. When they start talking about that, I have nothing to talk about. If I don’t make the playoffs next year I don’t know what will happen.\n\n“I know why I didn’t sign my extension,” Paul said on Sunday before the U.S. Olympic team practiced. “I’m going to play this season out and see what my options are.”\n\nPaul wouldn’t entirely rule out ending up in a Knicks uniform and neither would Anthony, who smiled when asked about Paul’s future prospects.\n\nFor Oklahoma City, [luxury tax] figures are paramount as both Harden and Ibaka become extension eligible this summer. And, as it stands now, both are looking at figures in the $12-million-plus range if contracts stay consistent with recent trends.\n\nIf Clay Bennett decides he can stomach the luxury tax hit, he's looking at somewhere between $72 and $76 million in salary commitments for seven players (assuming players currently under contract stay with the team).\n\nIn total, Bennett would probably be looking at an overall team cost of $85-90 million before his luxury tax hit."
