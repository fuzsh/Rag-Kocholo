        "text": "About Last Night: The Misplaced Punch Line Version\n\nAP Photo/Patrick Semansky\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nPrint\n\nIn case you were out living a life of leisure, here’s what you missed in sports on Wednesday.\n\nThe Los Angeles Clippers acquired Chris Paul for three players, Eric Gordon, Chris Kaman, and Al-Farouq Aminu, and a first-round draft pick. To be fair, McCoy spent his formative years Texas, so he pretty much always sounds like he’s concussed.\n\nSources indicate that the Orlando Magic have pulled Dwight Howard off the trade block. Graham told reporters he was thrilled with the move, and can’t wait to spend the next 8-10 months of his life in beautiful Tempe.\n\nNo. 2 Ohio State bounced back from its first loss of the season with a Jared Sullinger double-double and an 82-58 win over South Carolina-Upstate. However, if the players keep a clean record for roughly six months, he said that they’ll be front-runners for high political office in Cincinnati.\n\nNo. 7 Baylor knocked off Bethune-Cookman 69-42 to remain undefeated. Paul took the trade in stride, telling friends and family that he knew if he worked hard enough, he’d get moved up to the major league Lakers some day.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers used the league’s amnesty clause to release guard Baron Davis. When the final vote was tallied, the other four spots on the first team all belonged to Tim Tebow.\n\nAn Ohio prosecutor has decided against filing charges against players involved in the Xavier-Cincinnati brawl. Sources reported that the quarterback keeps trying to get girls to sign the boot, but the only person to agree so far is Troy Polamalu, who Roethlisberger mistakenly asked when he saw him from behind.\n\nCleveland Browns president Mike Holmgren said medical staff did not give Colt McCoy a concussion check before they sent him back in to last Thursday’s game. “If I can only get a win against South Carolina-Downstate, my dreams will have come true,” said Sullinger, before adding, “I have weird dreams.”\n\nThe AP college football All-America team, featuring four first-teamers from Alabama and three from LSU, was released yesterday. Originally, the franchise tried to use the clause to rid themselves of Dan Gilbert and his reign of comic-sans terror, but commissioner David Stern blocked the move, saying the rule didn’t apply to owners.\n\nArizona State hired Todd Graham, as its new head football coach. Graham had nearly finished his first year as coach of the Pittsburgh Panthers when the news came. Next, they plan to move him to the chopping block, the stumbling block, or, if things get extreme, the writer’s block.\n\nBen Roethlisberger skipped practice again, and wore a walking boot to help rest his injured ankle ahead of Monday’s game against the 49ers. After the game, Cookman told reporters that he was sick and tired of having to play full basketball games all by himself.\n\nRead more of The Triangle, Grantland’s sports blog.\n\nContact us at triangle@grantland.com\n\nFiled Under: About Last Night, Baylor, Chris Paul, Cleveland Browns, Cleveland Cavaliers, Dwight Howard, Los Angeles Clippers, Ohio State, Orlando Magic\n\nArchive\n\nMore From\n\nMore About Last Night\n\nMore The Triangle\n\nMore from\n\nMoneyBrackets: A 15-Step Guide to Conquering March Madness\n\nCollege Hoops Hype Meter: Which Freshmen Should You Get Excited About?\n\nThe End of a Brilliant Summer: Rory at the Ryder Cup\n\nThe Ryder Cup Preview: Massive, Unhinged, Scottish\n\nPitchCraft: The 2014 Year-End GIF Awards\n\nSee all from\n\nMore About Last Night\n\nAbout Last Night: Still Federer\n\nAbout Last Night: The Djok Is on Murray\n\nAbout Last Night: You’ve Been Kershaw’d\n\nAbout Last Night: Playoffs in the Cards?\n\nAbout Last Night: Keystone Showdown\n\nSee all About Last Night\n\nMore The Triangle\n\nWe Went There: Clippers-Mavs and DeAndre Jordan Night in Los Angeles\n\nNo Messi, No Problem: Neymar Becomes a Superstar\n\nWorld Series Weekend: Five Questions for Three (or Two) Royals-Mets Games\n\nNBA Overnight: Where Was the Spark?\n\nNHL Grab Bag: Let’s Get Spooky\n\nSee all The Triangle"
