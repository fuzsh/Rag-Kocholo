If the Raptors' recent 2019 NBA Finals championship win hasn't convinced you of Canada's obsession with basketball, this quiz will definitely help. While the majority of our players go on to play for American NBA teams, many Canadian pro basketball players got their start playing on high school or university teams.

Given the fact that basketball was invented by Canadian Dr. James Naismith in 1891, no one should be shocked by the incredibly gifted players Canada has produced.\n\nSo, sports fans, let's see how much you know about Canada's proven track record with the NBA. Only the most dedicated basketball fans will be able to score enough three-pointers to win!\n\nthegrandkenyon via YouTube\n\nIf you were at the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame on November 8, 2014, you would have been present for this retired NBA player's induction ceremony.
