        "text": "By Frank Urbina and Raul Barrigon |\n\nThe 2003 NBA Draft class is considered one of the GOAT draft classes in league history, along with the 1996 and 1984 groups.\n\nNot only does the ’03 class have one of the two main GOAT candidates as the No. 1 pick but it also features three other current or future Hall-of-Famers right after him, along with an abundance of serviceable role players.\n\nBelow, check out our re-draft for the 2003 class, with players going in the order we believe they’d go in today.\n\nNo. 1 pick: LeBron James\n\nConsidered the GOAT by some, LeBron James faced nearly insurmountable expectations heading into the NBA, was proclaimed to be a future Hall-of-Famer before dribbling a basketball even once as a professional, and has undoubtedly surpassed them all. The all-time leading scorer in the NBA, James could do everything at an elite level, be it get buckets, create for others, or rebound the ball, as well as defend multiple positions. Even as his once-otherworldly explosiveness has dwindled, James remains a Top 10 player in the league into his late 30s thanks to how well he has adapted his game as he has aged. The only question now is: Will he be able to add to his four-ring total before it’s all said and done?\n\nActual position: No. 1\n\nCareer earnings: $482,593,428\n\nCareer stats: 27.1 ppg, 7.5 rpg, 7.3 apg, 50.5 FG%, 34.6 3P%\n\nCareer Salary Info\n\nNo. 2 pick: Dwyane Wade\n\nWhen he was drafted fifth overall in 2003 by the Miami Heat, no one knew Dwyane Wade was about to embark on a career that would leave him considered as a Top 3 shooting guard of all time, according to many. As a prospect, Wade lacked a jumper but did display his elite athleticism and craftiness even at Marquette, causing Miami to take him in the Top 5 that year despite him being a bit older than a lot of his peers in that draft class, a decision the Heat would not regret, as Wade would help Miami win three championships during his time there over two different eras of greatness. His playoff runs from 2005 and 2006, in particular, are what made him a legend, but his contributions and willingness to take a sidekick role during the 2012 and 2013 championships were likewise very commendable and impressive. We also can’t forget that Wade’s peak probably came between those two eras, as in 2009 and 2010, Wade was a borderline MVP-level producer.\n\nActual position: No. 5\n\nCareer earnings: $199,499,205\n\nCareer stats: 22.0 ppg, 4.7 rpg, 5.4 apg, 48.0 FG%, 29.3 3P%\n\nCareer Salary Info\n\nNo. 3 pick: Carmelo Anthony\n\nComing out of Syracuse a national champion already, it’s unfortunate Carmelo Anthony never had a good enough team around him to make a similar deep playoff run in the NBA. Regardless, outside of that, Anthony is another first-ballot Hall-of-Famer from this draft class, one of the smoothest scorers of all time thanks to his face-up game, quick first step and deceptive jab step. There’s also FIBA Melo to discuss, as Anthony was one of the best Team USA performers of all time, winning three Olympic gold medals with the Americans. Sure, he could have passed the ball more in his prime or played better defense, but as far as bucket-getting, few in league history can match Anthony’s prowess.\n\nActual position: No. 3\n\nCareer earnings: $240,843,702\n\nCareer stats: 22.5 ppg, 6.2 rpg, 2.7 apg, 44.7 FG%, 35.5 3P%\n\nCareer Salary Info\n\nNo. 4 pick: Chris Bosh\n\nOne member of the 2003 draft class who is already in the Hall of Fame, though for unfortunate, health-related-retirement reasons, Chris Bosh will greet two of his former teammates in Springfield one day, as the first member of the Big 3 Heat to receive the honor. Many may not remember but Bosh was truly a special player in his heyday, even before going to Miami, an All-Star-level big man with a feathery jumper, a quick first step and creativity in the low block. Bosh also had quick feet and good length that helped him defend when forced to switch. The big lefty was already great in his era but one has to wonder how he would have fared in today’s NBA, where he would have been shooting threes instead of deep twos and been a very effective floor-spacing center. There’s a chance a prime Bosh in 2023 would have put up even more impressive numbers.\n\nActual position: No. 4\n\nCareer earnings: $242,110,053\n\nCareer stats: 19.2 ppg, 8.5 rpg, 2.0 apg, 1.0 bpg, 49.4 FG%\n\nCareer Salary Info\n\nNo. 5 pick: David West\n\nLongevity grants David West the final spot in the Top 5 of our re-draft, as although the drop-off seems steep going from four future Hall-of-Famers to this Hall-of-Very-Gooder, West was still a two-time All-Star in his career as well as a two-time NBA champion. Alongside Chris Paul in New Orleans, West was a deadly pick-and-pop finisher thanks to his smooth outside jumper and strong screen setting. West was then a mainstay on various Indiana Pacers teams that were the Big 3 Heat’s toughest foe in the East for various playoff runs, as his ability to post up Miami’s smaller defenders gave Indiana a puncher’s chance in those series. West then finally finished up his career as mostly a reserve for Golden State but was very effective when called upon, finishing plays as a fourth option on offense and providing toughness on defense and the glass.\n\nActual position: No. 18\n\nCareer earnings: $93,047,916\n\nCareer stats: 13.6 ppg, 6.4 rpg, 2.2 apg, 49.5 FG%\n\nCareer Salary Info\n\nNo. 6 pick: Kyle Korver\n\nOne of the best shooters in league history, Kyle Korver was not a star in the NBA but he was a star in his role as a sharpshooter off the ball, always fighting relentlessly to get open and possessing a lightning-quick, high-elevation jumper that was very difficult for opponents to defend. Among players with at least 5,000 career three-point attempts in the NBA, Korver was actually the most accurate shooter ever at 42.9 percent, with Stephen Curry trailing just behind at 42.8 percent. Not bad for being the 51st pick in his draft class.\n\nActual position: No. 51\n\nCareer earnings: $82,712,208\n\nCareer stats: 9.7 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 1.7 apg, 42.9 3P%\n\nCareer Salary Info\n\nNo. 7 pick: Mo Williams\n\nA one-time All-Star in his career, Mo Williams was a quick point guard with good scoring skills, including from three, who could get shots off and knock them down while also facilitating offense for teammates. He was particularly effective for the Cleveland Cavaliers as an off-ball point guard for James because he was a very sound three-point shooter with his feet set.\n\nActual position: No. 47\n\nCareer earnings: $67,606,431\n\nCareer stats: 13.2 ppg, 4.9 apg, 2.8 rpg, 37.8 3P%\n\nCareer Salary Info\n\nNo. 8 pick: Jose Calderon\n\nDespite going undrafted, Jose Calderon enjoyed a solid 14-year career in the NBA, putting up great shooting numbers albeit without star-level volume. Calderon was a dependable floor general when he wasn’t injured, adept at setting up teammates for good looks as well as at knocking down shots, be it from three or the free-throw line, where he was a career 87.3 percent shooter.\n\nActual position: Undrafted\n\nCareer earnings: $86,202,087\n\nCareer stats: 8.9 ppg, 5.8 apg, 2.4 rpg, 40.7 3P%\n\nCareer Salary Info\n\nNo. 9 pick: Boris Diaw\n\nIt can be a bit of a tired trope to wonder how a player from a previous era might fare even better in the modern game – hell, we already did it with Bosh in this very re-draft article – but the same can be said for Boris Diaw, who was truly unique in his time and would likewise stand out today. Diaw could play everything from small forward to center, even handling point-guard duties from time to time throughout his career. Diaw could dribble and get to the basket, post up, set up teammates or shoot the ball despite being on the heavier side. One of the most important role players of the San Antonio Spurs’ 2014 title run, Diaw averaged 9.2 points and 3.4 assists while shooting 40.0 percent from three in the postseason that year, totally befuddling foes on how best to defend him as San Antonio coasted to the championship.\n\nActual position: No. 21\n\nCareer earnings: $81,865,921\n\nCareer stats: 8.6 ppg, 4.4 rpg, 3.5 apg, 49.3 FG%\n\nCareer Salary Info\n\nNo. 10 pick: Leandro Barbosa\n\nOne of the faster players in the league during his prime, Leandro Barbosa could scoot down the court quicker than most any defender and finish in transition or get to the basket in the half-court against set defenses. He was also a capable outside shooter despite having a funky release on his jumper. A player mostly focused on scoring, Barbosa was a menace off the bench, winning Sixth Man of the Year in 2006-07 with the seven-seconds-or-less Phoenix Suns, when he averaged 18.1 points as mostly a reserve, as well as a championship with the Warriors in 2015.\n\nActual position: No. 28\n\nCareer earnings: $47,617,717\n\nCareer stats: 10.6 ppg, 2.0 rpg, 2.1 apg, 38.7 3P%\n\nCareer Salary Info\n\nNo. 11 pick: Chris Kaman\n\nAs legend has it, Heat decision-maker Pat Riley considered Chris Kaman heavily for the No. 5 spot in the 2003 draft. Miami, at the time, had a bigger need at center and point guard than at off-ball guard, as the Heat had Eddie Jones as their starting shooting guard at the time, who was still averaging over 18 points nightly, leading Riley to look at players like Kaman (and two others coming up later in this re-draft) when the draft process was getting started. Kaman was no slouch, either, coming off a junior season at Central Michigan where he averaged over 22 points and 12 rebounds. He wasn’t a bad NBA player, either, making one All-Star appearance and providing low-post scoring and rebounding for many years. He just wasn’t a Wade-level player. Luckily for the Heat, Wade the draft prospect won Riley over in the end thanks to his star-level potential, which he fully met in the NBA, and then some.\n\nActual position: No. 6\n\nCareer earnings: $86,527,368\n\nCareer stats: 11.2 ppg, 7.6 rpg, 1.3 apg, 48.9 FG%\n\nCareer Salary Info\n\nNo. 12 pick: Josh Howard\n\nFrom a late first-round pick to an All-Star appearance, two-way swingman Josh Howard was another success story from the 2003 draft class. Howard was an important member of various elite Dallas Mavericks teams alongside Dirk Nowitzki, peaking in 2006-07 when he averaged 18.9 points, 6.8 rebounds and 1.2 steals as Dallas won 67 regular-season games before being upset by the We Believe Warriors in round one. It’s a bit sad Howard was unable to finish the job in Dallas, getting traded the season before the Mavericks won the 2010-11 championship.\n\nActual position: No. 29\n\nCareer earnings: $40,327,083\n\nCareer stats: 14.3 ppg, 5.7 rpg, 1.6 apg, 44.8 FG%\n\nCareer Salary Info\n\nNo. 13 pick: Zaza Pachulia\n\nA feisty role player who played with a lot of tenacity, especially on the glass and as a screen-setter, Zaza Pachulia lasted 16 seasons in the NBA and was usually on good teams, eventually winning two championships as the starting center for the Warriors in 2016-17 and 2017-18.\n\nActual position: No. 42\n\nCareer earnings: $60,356,464\n\nCareer stats: 6.8 ppg, 5.8 rpg, 1.3 apg, 46.9 FG%\n\nCareer Salary Info\n\nNo. 14 pick: Kirk Hinrich\n\nOne of the other players Riley had an eye on early in the 2003 draft process, Kirk Hinrich entered the NBA after a four-year college career at Kansas, one that culminated with him averaging 17.3 points and 1.9 steals as a senior, leading the Jayhawks to a 30-8 season and getting all the way to the national championship game where Hinrich and Co. fell to Anthony and Syracuse in a heartbreaking 81-78 result. Hinrich did enjoy a successful NBA career, lasting 13 seasons thanks to his off-the-dribble scoring and elite on-ball defense.\n\nActual position: No. 7\n\nCareer earnings: $71,692,268\n\nCareer stats: 10.9 ppg, 4.8 apg, 2.9 rpg, 37.5 FG%\n\nCareer Salary Info\n\nNo. 15 pick: Nick Collison\n\nIt never really translated in the NBA but Hinrich’s teammate at Kansas, Nick Collison was a monster in college, averaging 18.5 points and 10.0 rebounds as a senior and earning 1st Team All-American honors before getting drafted late in the 2003 lottery. Collison would never average double-digit points or rebounds in the NBA but he did set good screens and box out well while being a well-respected teammate, so he lasted 14 seasons in the Association anyway, all with the Oklahoma City Thunder. (Well, the first four of those seasons were technically with the Seattle SuperSonics, but it’s still the same franchise.)\n\nActual position: No. 12\n\nCareer earnings: $60,322,642\n\nCareer stats: 5.9 ppg, 5.2 rpg, 1.0 apg, 53.4 FG%\n\nCareer Salary Info\n\nNo. 16 pick: TJ Ford\n\nLack of size and top-level athleticism did him as far as being a star in the NBA, as did a serious spinal injury that cost him the second year of his career, but TJ Ford still lasted eight seasons in the NBA and received 2nd Team All-Rookie honors in his inaugural campaign. Ford was a star in college, named Naismith Player of the Year as a sophomore before declaring for the draft after averaging 15.0 points, 7.7 assists and 2.0 steals per game while leading Texas to the Final Four.\n\nActual position: No. 8\n\nCareer earnings: $43,534,324\n\nCareer stats: 11.2 ppg, 5.8 apg, 3.1 rpg, 43.3 FG%\n\nCareer Salary Info\n\nNo. 17 pick: Luke Ridnour\n\nA playmaker in the NBA who had success despite lacking physically, Luke Ridnour played 12 seasons in the NBA and was a solid creator and shot-maker, capable of hitting shots off the dribble and from three-point range.\n\nActual position: No. 14\n\nCareer earnings: $45,269,478\n\nCareer stats: 9.3 ppg, 4.5 apg, 2.3 rpg, 43.1 FG%\n\nCareer Salary Info\n\nNo. 18 pick: Kendrick Perkins\n\nNow a TV personality extraordinaire, Kendrick Perkins was a solid player in the NBA, a starter for the Big Three championship Boston Celtics 2007-08 alongside Kevin Garnett. Perkins had next to no skill outside of the paint but was a tough rebounder and solid defender against opposing post-up attempts.\n\nActual position: No. 27\n\nCareer earnings: $56,886,841\n\nCareer stats: 5.4 ppg, 5.8 rpg, 1.0 apg, 53.0 FG%\n\nCareer Salary Info\n\nNo. 19 pick: Steve Blake\n\nDespite lacking in size, Steve Blake enjoyed a solid NBA career thanks to his fun playmaking skills and ability to hit threes, both with his feet set and off the dribble.\n\nActual position: No. 38\n\nCareer earnings: $36,946,977\n\nCareer stats: 6.5 ppg, 2.1 rpg, 4.0 apg, 38.3 3P%\n\nCareer Salary Info\n\nNo. 20 pick: Marquis Daniels\n\nA slashing swingman who could defend multiple positions, Marquis Daniels was a three-point shot away from being the prototypical 3-and-D wing, which would have bought him even more time and a bigger role in the NBA.\n\nActual position: Undrafted\n\nCareer earnings: $36,697,352\n\nCareer stats: 7.9 ppg, 2.8 rpg, 1.8 apg, 45.1 FG%\n\nCareer Salary Info\n\nNo. 21 pick: Carlos Delfino\n\nPart of the Argentinian golden generation of hoopers that won Olympic gold in Athens 2004, Carlos Delfino was a respectable swingman in the NBA, providing toughness on the wing and a serviceable three-point shot.\n\nActual position: No. 25\n\nCareer earnings: $24,777,037\n\nCareer stats: 8.1 ppg, 3.6 rpg, 1.7 apg, 36.5 3P%\n\nCareer Salary Info\n\nNo. 22 pick: Matt Bonner\n\nHe may have had a funky release on his outside jumper but former Gator Matt Bonner could knock down threes at a high clip, a career 41.4 percent shooter from three, which helped him last 12 seasons in the NBA.\n\nActual position: No. 45\n\nCareer earnings: $30,128,334\n\nCareer stats: 5.8 ppg, 3.0 rpg, 0.7 apg, 46.4 FG%\n\nCareer Salary Info\n\nNo. 23 pick: James Jones\n\nNow best known for his exploits as the general manager of the Phoenix Suns, James Jones was an impactful role player for many years thanks to his outside shooting skills, where the former Miami standout hit over 40 percent from three for his career.\n\nActual position: No. 49\n\nCareer earnings: $25,835,822\n\nCareer stats: 5.2 ppg, 1.8 rpg, 0.5 apg, 40.1 3P%\n\nCareer Salary Info\n\nNo. 24 pick: Travis Outlaw\n\nA defender on the wing, Travis Outlaw was mostly a spot-up-three threat or a slasher during his time in the NBA. He could also knock down shots from the midrange.\n\nActual position: No. 23\n\nCareer earnings: $44,871,226\n\nCareer stats: 8.5 ppg, 3.2 rpg, 0.8 apg, 42.3 FG%\n\nCareer Salary Info\n\nNo. 25 pick: Mickael Pietrus\n\nA fan favorite for his high-effort style of play, Mickael Pietrus could hit threes and pick up steals, a 3-and-D swingman that was an important part of the unexpected Finals run by the 2008-09 Orlando Magic.\n\nActual position: No. 11\n\nCareer earnings: $34,658,718\n\nCareer stats: 8.3 ppg, 3.1 rpg, 0.8 apg, 42.5 FG%\n\nCareer Salary Info\n\nNo. 26 pick: Willie Green\n\nNow the head coach for the New Orleans Pelicans, Willie Green spent years in the NBA as a bench player, someone capable of coming in and hitting threes to provide a spark of offense when called upon.\n\nActual position: No. 41\n\nCareer earnings: $23,373,140\n\nCareer stats: 8.3 ppg, 1.8 rpg, 1.4 apg, 42.5 FG%\n\nCareer Salary Info\n\nNo. 27 pick: Luke Walton\n\nLuke Walton didn’t amount to much as a head coach but he was a decent role player, coming off the bench for two championship Lakers teams in the late 2000s.
