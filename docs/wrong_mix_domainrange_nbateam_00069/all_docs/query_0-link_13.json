        "text": "You know that award the writers give out at the end of the year that nobody really cares aboutâ€”the one that's arbitrarily handed to the player who was stashed on the bench the prior year, sees his minutes tripled, and logically the rest of his stats skyrocket?\n\nAfter all, you don't normally see a player who's been in the league for a few years suddenly go from a bad or decent player to All-Star caliber or better overnight.\n\nInsert your typical, every year candidates in here. LaMarcus Aldridge has taken over the starting job in Portland with the departure of Zach Randolph, and has doubled his scoring output (in 12 more minutes per game). But really, who didn't expect him to have this kind of a season? He showed at the end of last season that he could do it, that's why he was picked No. 2 overall. How improved is he really?\n\nHow about Rudy Gay? Same story, different second year player. Getting more playing time, shooting more, scoring more, etc.\n\nRashad McCants, a third year player who's excelling on one of the worst teams of recent memory, is putting in over 15 points per contest as opposed to just over five last year. So, is he the most improved player?\n\nNo. The answer is that none of the aforementioned players should even be in the discussion for the award. It should be a two man race between two veterans who are having career years after being written off this offseason.\n\nHedo Turkoglu of the Orlando Magic and Chris Kaman of the Los Angeles Clippers are the most improved players in the league this year, by far. Take your pick between the two for the award.\n\nWhen the Magic handed out a max deal to Rashard Lewis, many people wrote off Hedo Turkoglu as the odd man out in Orlando. Naysayers said Lewis did everything that Turkoglu provided, only better. They said that Turkoglu would be traded for some front-court help to complement Dwight Howard.\n\nLittle did they know, Hedo would be the first place Magic's second leading scorer, while putting up career highs in rebounds and assists. Turkoglu, hardly considered to be on the upswing of his career in his eighth NBA season, has gone from 13.3 points, 4.0 rebounds and 3.2 assists per game in just over 31 minutes per game a year ago to 18.7, 6.1 and 4.2 respectively in over 37 minutes per game on one of the most improved teams in the East. He is the definition of the \"Most Improved Player.\"\n\nTravel out West to \"the other Los Angeles team,\" and you'll find the most improved big man in the league, Chris Kaman. Written off by many people as a bust after regressing a bit last season, \"Kaveman\" has answered the bell this season.\n\nWhile his team has struggled without Elton Brand all year, Kaman has become a reliable post scorer (17.4 ppg), an elite rebounder (13.8 rpg, third in the NBA) and a great shot blocker (3.1 bpg, third in the NBA).\n\nThe 5th year pro is putting up such great numbers for the first time of his year, with previous career highs of 11.9 ppg (2005-2006), 9.6 rpg (05-06) and 1.5 bpg (06-07).\n\nEveryone knew he had the talent, but he has very quickly gone from a disappointment to a guy who figured it all out and is one of the best centers in the league. That, to me, defines improvement."
