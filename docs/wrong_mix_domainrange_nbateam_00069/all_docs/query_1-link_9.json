        "text": "One big man that may be a trade target for multiple teams in the NBA is Chris Kaman of the Los Angeles Clippers. Kaman has spent his entire career as a member of the Los Angeles Clippers since being drafted in 2003 out of Central Michigan University. He has one more year left on his current contract, and will then become an unrestricted free agent at the end of next season.\n\nDue to injuries, Kaman did not see much action last season, while rookie Blake Griffin and third-year man DeAndre Jordan stole the show in Los Angeles. Jordan was selected by the Clippers in the second round of the 2008 NBA Draft. He averaged a career-high 7.1 points and 7.2 rebounds during the 2010-11 NBA season.\n\nIt appears that the Clippers will look to re-sign Jordan to a multi-year contract and pair him alongside Blake Griffin in the frontcourt. This also means that the Chris Kaman era is over in Los Angeles and the team will look to move the seven-footer before the trade deadline (assuming the 2011-12 NBA season officially takes place).\n\nThese five teams are in need of a big man and could use Kaman’s services and if things do not work out, then Kaman can become a free agent at the end of the 2011-12 NBA season.\n\nThe Houston Rockets lost former No. 1 draft pick Yao Ming to retirement earlier this summer, and starting center Chuck Hayes is a free agent. Hayes may be a popular choice for other teams during free agency so the Rockets may have to come up with some contingency plans.\n\nThe Rockets have Hasheem Thabeet on the roster, but the former No. 2 overall draft pick in 2009, has not proved that he is NBA ready after splitting time with the Memphis Grizzlies and the Houston Rockets.\n\nThe Miami Heat could look to bring in Kaman to help Chris Bosh in the frontcourt. Starter Joel Anthony of Miami last season showed that he is more of a defensive-minded player and a rebounder than an offensive-minded player.\n\nWith the recent retirement of veteran NBA center Zydrunas Ilgauskas, and the inability of Erick Dampier and Jamaal Magloire, the Heat need to fill the position in some manner to give them options during the season.\n\nThe Toronto Raptors are another team in need of a center which will also allow them to move Andrea Bargnani to his more natural power forward spot. Also needing major help in the rebounding department, Kaman may be a decent overall fit.\n\nKaman may be an interesting addition to the team in terms of his scoring ability and reasonable rebounding averages with the Clippers thus allowing Bargnani to play around the perimeter. If this move does happen and works out well, then Kaman may find a new contract offer north of the border.\n\nThe New York Knicks have been on the lookout for a center to play alongside Amar’e Stoudemire and the newly-acquired Carmelo Anthony. Kaman would be an interesting addition to the team as he is going to most likely change his game.\n\nHe would have to go from being a scorer and back-to-the-basket type of player to one that is more of a shooter or more of a rebounder and play close to the rim. His touches will also be limited as he would not be the main focus of the offense under Mike D’Antoni.\n\nYes, the Orlando Magic may be interested in Kaman’s services if they do decide to trade Dwight Howard sometime this coming NBA season. Dwight Howard is one of the very few players currently in the NBA that is irreplaceable, but if worst comes to worst, the Magic can at least bring in a player that has proven that he does belong in the NBA.\n\nHowever, one way I can picture Chris Kaman in Orlando is part of a potential multi-team Dwight Howard trade (if that occurs it is going to be one of the toughest decisions Otis Smith will have to ever make)."
