        "text": "Welcome to the 2012 NBA Trade Deadline, where Commissioner David Stern is praying to the Basketball Gods that a huge deal gets done before everyone turns their attention to their brackets. Yes, professional basketball is about to be eclipsed for the rest of the month by its hipper college counterpart, and it's hoping for a quick fix makeover to make it look younger and sexier. It certainly doesn't help the NBA that its most entertaining young player is out for the season, the biggest trade story involves a level of indecision that would infuriate Hamlet and that the miracle turnaround in New York has reached its expiration date.\n\n1. Mike D'Antoni Is Done In New York\n\nSo, remember those few weeks when it seemed that Jeremy Lin was keeping New York Knicks' head coach Mike D'Antoni's job safe? Well, things have changed. The Knicks suffered a six game losing streak, their longest of the season. Amar'e Stoudemire has been complaining in the press that his teammates haven't been serious enough. Carmelo Anthony, who has been getting the majority of the blame for the team's struggles since his return to the lineup, allegedly made it clear to ownership that he could not coexist with D'Antoni.\n\nSo on Wednesday Mike D'Antoni resigned, assistant Mike Woodson took over as interim coach. It's not really clear if D'Antoni resigned on his own or at the behest of owner James Dolan. I'm not sure it made a difference, really. After all, before Jeremy Lin came from nowhere to lead the Knicks to an improbable winning streak, D'Antoni looked like a coach who was hoping to be fired. D'Antoni never found a way to get Anthony and Stoudemire to share the court effectively, particularly on the defensive end, and Anthony's last edict suggested the situation was only going to get worse. Now, Knicks fans are hoping for former Bulls/Lakers coach Phil Jackson to come out of retirement to save their team, but it's hard to understand why he would want to deal with this decidedly dysfunctional bunch.\n\nD'Antoni's resignation completes the New York Knicks' swift descent from their brief moment as the NBA's unlikely success story back into their more familiar role as one of the NBA's biggest messes. Linderella's coach has turned back into a pumpkin. Maybe \"Fairytale of New York\" is just a Christmas song after all.\n\n2. Dwight Howard: The Indecision\n\nThe main question of Thursday's NBA Trade Deadline seems to be: Is this it? It's quite possible that the blockbuster trade of the season happened during training camp when Chris Paul landed with the Los Angeles Clippers. With Chris Paul off the table, 90% of the trade talk has revolved around Orlando Magic center Dwight Howard and where he could possibly land. Dwight Howard wants to be traded, most of the time it seems, but he's been just indecisive enough that the Magic have convinced themselves that Howard might stay despite the \"He's Just Not That Into You\" vibes he gives off.\n\nSo earlier this week, presumably after realizing that the Magic were not likely to trade him, Dwight Howard made a public statement and said he was willing to \"roll the dice\" and stay with the Orlando Magic. The public mostly took the statement as a blatant P.R. move, to make it seem like Howard was making some sort of sacrifice for the good of the team when he was really just promising to fulfill the remainder of his contract and then, presumably, planned to depart via free agency during the summer.\n\nMaybe Howard figured out that his statement didn't really appease the Orlando Magic or their fans, because Wednesday he went one step further and said that he wouldn't opt out of his contract in July and would remain with the Magic next season. This most likely means that this whole blasted affair will happen yet again next trade deadline. So unless there's a major reversal today, the most long-running subplot of the entire season has led absolutely nowhere. This has been even more anticlimactic than the finale of \"Lost\".\n\nNB: Immediately after writing this, reports came out that Dwight Howard will NOT surrender his opt out clause at the end of the season like he, apparently, had promised the Orlando Magic hours before. Any difference between what's written above and Dwight Howard's actual current status is solely the fault of Howard himself and not the writer.\n\n3. Monta Ellis Has Been The Biggest Name Moved So Far\n\nSo Dwight Howard is staying in Orlando, for the time being, and it doesn't seem likely that the Boston Celtics will trade point guard Rajon Rondo. Thankfully, the Golden State Warriors made sure there was at least one major in-season deal when they traded shooting guard Monta Ellis, along with forward Ekpe Udoh and center Kwame Brown, to the Milwaukee Bucks for always-injured center Andrew Bogut and forward Stephen Jackson.\n\nEssentially, the team has given up its most prolific scorer for a player whose name has become synonymous with \"out for the season\". This trade might go down as the one trade in NBA history where the team trading away Kwame Brown ends up on the losing end.\n\nOr not: Trading away the talented but streaky Ellis might be the start of a culture change for Golden State, leading them away from the entertaining yet unsuccessful style of play that is Warriors basketball: Score as many points as possible without bothering with discipline or, egads, defense. If Andrew Bogut somehow remains healthy - stop snickering it's not entirely impossible - he would be one of the more effective centers in the game. Plus, again this cannot be emphasized too much: THEY HAVE GOTTEN RID OF KWAME BROWN. It's called addition by subtraction.\n\nAn interesting detail is that if the Warriors, who will be without Bogut for most of the season, end the season with the seventh or worse record in the league, this would prevent their 2012 first round draft pick from going to the Utah Jazz. I'm honestly interested in seeing a Golden State Warriors team actively trying to play bad basketball to secure the pick. I honestly believe they will end up accidentally winning a bunch of games by accident a la \"The Producers\" and I guarantee you that it will be Nate Robinson's fault.\n\n4. We Must Go On Without Ricky Rubio\n\nWith one freak injury, the NBA lost one of its great attractions for the rest of the season. Minnesota Timberwolves point guard Ricky Rubio's entertaining rookie campaign ended when he tore his ACL while playing the Los Angeles Lakers and even the most cynical NBA fan must feel his loss. Ricky Rubio was one of the most fun things to happen to pro basketball in a long time. He's been in the league less than three months, but already it's difficult to imagine the league without his impossible space-bending passes and his infectious energy. Clearly there's an evil power attempting to suck all the joy out of the world. What will be his next move? Will he outlaw kittens, rainbows and sunshine? Will he cause Adele to lose her voice? WILL HE LET BILLY CRYSTAL HOST THE OSCARS AGAIN?\n\nInstead of lamenting what we've lost, we must soldier on and be thankful for what remains. While Rubio's absence hurts the league, it will help the profile of at least two players: Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love. Rubio's injury effectively hands the NBA Rookie of the Year Award to Irving. The dangerous Cleveland Cavaliers guard has been a godsend to a fanbase eager to forget about their last franchise icon.\n\nMeanwhile, Rubio's Timberwolves teammate Kevin Love has quietly emerged as a longshot MVP candidate. While Rubio certainly made him, as well as all of his teammates, a better player, maybe without Rubio's dazzling passes, people can finally notice just how great Kevin Love is. Everybody already knows that he's a tremendous rebounder, but with Rubio on the sidelines maybe people will realize what a great all-around player Love has become! Did you know he recently scored 39 points against the Clippers? In some respects, Rubio's absence can be a blessing in disguise! (Note: Yeah, no I don't buy this either.)\n\n5. Other Things We've Learned\n\nClipper Darrell is Clipper Darrell Again.\n\nChris Kaman has a way with visual metaphors.\n\nIt wasn't all bad Knicks fans, Jeremy Lin DID strip the ball away from Derrick Rose during a losing effort against the Chicago Bulls.\n\nMeanwhile, with much of the league in shambles, everything is going perfectly with the first place Oklahoma City Thunder where there are absolutely no problems or potential media distractions. No, just kidding, Russell Westbrook is still acting like a complete dink.\n\nSunday night's game between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics might have been the end of an era. It was the last meeting of the two teams in the regular season, and despite Kevin Garnett's belief that \"anything is possible,\" it's extraordinarily unlikely that the two teams will meet in this year's finals. No, the next time they face each other will be next year, and at least several of the rivalry's key figures won't be there.\n\nAt least the era ended with one last great game. After a sloppy first half, where the Celtics kept missing shots and the Lakers kept turning the ball over, both teams came alive in the game's third quarter: Fights broke out on the court and opposing players began matching each other's shots. In the end the Lakers overcame a five point deficit in the final minutes to beat the Celtics in a game that, like so many of the games between the two teams, had an undeniable postseason intensity to it.\n\nThis game also featured an additional aura of sadness, or at least finality, about it. The Celtics and Lakers rivalry will exist, in some form or another, as long as the NBA does, but it won't be the same next season. The Celtics' New Big Three (Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen) will no longer be together and Kobe Bryant will likely have a different supporting cast. They won't be the same Lakers and Celtics teams that faced off in the 2008 and 2010 Finals. No, this game marked the end of this particular era of the rivalry, it was one last chance to appreciate a present before it was, forever and irreversibly, part of the past."
