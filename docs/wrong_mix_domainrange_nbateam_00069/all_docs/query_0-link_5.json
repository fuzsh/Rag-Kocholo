        "text": "One of the sources said the Warriors would not give up Ellis for Hornets center Chris Kaman, reportedly New Orleans’ key piece in the three-team talks. Golden State sources have consistently said they want a star in return if they move Ellis. Kaman, who is two years removed from his best year and is a free agent at season’s end, doesn’t qualify in the Warriors’ minds. There is basically no combination of players, from Orlando and/or New Orleans, that will make the Warriors part with Ellis.\n\nSince his return to the court on Feb. 6, Kaman — an All-Star in 2010 who played in just 32 games last season and 31 games in 2008-09 because of left foot injuries — has averaged 16.1 points and 9.8 rebounds while shooting just 39.7 percent from the field and taking 16.7 shots per game. “It’s been tough, man,” Kaman said. “It’s a real unprecedented situation for me. I didn’t know how to handle it all the time, just try to be as cool as I could be about it. But as bitter, mad, upset or frustrated as you are, you’ve got to be a professional and come in and do your job. That’s what I kept telling myself. “But now, getting the opportunity to play and just try to do what I can do and help the team the best I can, I think I’ve shown what I can do enough to where they trust me a little bit more.”"
