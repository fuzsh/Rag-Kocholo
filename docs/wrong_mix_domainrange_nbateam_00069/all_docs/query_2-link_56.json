        "text": "Certainly not a household name to most NBA fans, Mix enjoyed a 13-year NBA career (1970-72; 1974-83), with all but four of those seasons residing in Philadelphia. Though never a full-time starter, Mix was a valuable forward whose most noteworthy season came in 1974-75, when he averaged career highs of 15.6 points and 10.9 rebounds. He also earned the only All-Star nod of his career during that campaign. However, injuries limited Mix to just 46 games that season for the 76ers.\n\nMitchell should be considered one of the league's most-noted scorers during a 10-year NBA career (1979-88), mostly spent in San Antonio. He averaged 19.8 points per game and scored more than 15,000 during his NBA run, but is a name likely unknown to today's fan base of the Association. Mitchell's third season of 1980-81, while with the 28-54 Cleveland Cavaliers, proved to be his best from a statistical standpoint. Mitchell averaged a career-high 24.5 points, while also pulling down 6.1 boards and dishing out 1.7 assists per contest.\n\nDuring the 1978-79 season, Shelton won an NBA title with the Sonics. Three seasons later he was an All-Star. During the 1981-82 campaign, the power forward averaged 14.9 points, 6.3 rebounds, 3.1 assists and just over a 1.5 blocks to join more prominent Sonics teammates Jack Sikma and Gus Williams on the Western Conference All-Star squad. Shelton was also named a second-team All-NBA Defensive performer in 1982.\n\nNo doubt Ainge was a better-than average player during his 14-year NBA career (1982-95). He was a two-time NBA champion with the Boston Celtics, but how many remember that Ainge was also an All-Star during the 1987-88 season with the storied franchise? While starting all 81 games he played that season, Ainge averaged 15.7 points, shooting 49.1 percent from the field and 41.5 percent from 3-point range. Not to mention, he also posted a career-high 6.2 assists and 1.4 steals per contest.\n\nThe 7-foot-2 Donaldson played parts of 14 seasons in the NBA from 1980-81 to the 1994-95 season. And though he averaged 10.8 points and 11,9 rebounds while starting all 82 games during the 1986-87 season for the Mavs, Donaldson's only All-Star nod came one year later — and that was as an injury replacement for the 1988 contest. That year, Donaldson started all 81 games he played, also pulling down 9.3 rebounds while scoring just 7.0 points per contest. Then again, with Mark Aguirre, Rolando Blackman and Derek Harper regularly filling the cup, Donaldson's value was more than just found on the offensive end of the court.\n\nThe well-traveled Johnson played for seven teams during a more-than-serviceable NBA career that began in 1981 with the Kansas City Kings and ended in 1991 with Golden State. The 6-foot-10 Johnson averaged 11.7 points for his career, with two of his best seasons coming in 1986-87 and '87-'88 while a member of the Portland Trail Blazers. That latter campaign rated Johnson an All-Star, averaging 15.4 points, 5.6 rebounds and 1.3 assists — even though the season before was better for from a statistical standpoint. However, an injury kept Johnson from playing in the mid-season showcase.\n\nAn exceptional college player at Bradley, Hawkins was a first-round pick of Philadelphia (from the L.A. Clippers via draft-day trade). By his third NBA season, Hawkins was an All-Star for the 76ers. However, 1991 would mark the only time Hawkins earned the honor, and did so during a season in which he averaged a career-high 22.1 points (on 47 percent shooting), along with 4.3 rebounds and 3.9 assists per game. Though Hawkins was never again named an All-Star, he enjoyed a solid 13-year NBA career with four teams.\n\nServing as a role player during his first three NBA seasons with the Bulls, Armstrong was a key presence during the team's run to three straight titles from 1991-}\n\n93. Armstrong took on a starting guard role — opposite Michael Jordan — in 1992-93, and started all 82 games in '93-'94 and '94-'95, when Jordan temporarily retired. His lone All-Star credit, as a starter nonetheless, came in 1994, during a season where Armstrong averaged a career-best 14.8 points, shot 44.4 percent from 3-point range and dished out nearly 4 assists per contest.\n\nLike most others on this list, Barros enjoyed a long NBA career that spanned parts of 14 seasons from 1989-2004. Now, the former Boston College star enjoyed his most consistent success during the middle of that tenure, while with Philadelphia and Boston. During the 1994-95 season as a Sixer, Barros was named an All-Star for the first and only time, and went on to earn NBA Most Improved Player while setting career highs for average minutes (40.5), scoring (20.6), rebounding (3.3), assists (7.5) and games (82).\n\nCeballos is perhaps best known for being one of the league's best dunkers, and winning the 1992 NBA Dunk Contest with the Phoenix Suns, in his second season. However, he proved there was more to his game than highlight-reel jams. After four seasons in Phoenix, Ceballos headed further west to L.A., where he was named an All-Star in his first season with the Lakers in 1994-95, but couldn't play due to injury. That season, Ceballos set career bests for average points (21.7), rebounds (8.0) and assists (1.8) per game.\n\nThe No. 11 overall pick in the 1990 NBA Draft, it wasn't as if Hill was not a valued performer during his first three seasons as a member of the Golden State Warriors. However, it's when he moved to Cleveland that Hill came into his own as a complete NBA player. He averaged at least 10 points three times in four seasons with the Cavaliers, highlighted by the 1994-95 All-Star campaign, when he set career bests of 13.8 points and 10.9 rebounds. In all, Hill played 14 NBA seasons, with just the one All-Star effort.\n\nOne of the more interesting All-Star moments, Gatling made his only All-Star appearance as a member of the Dallas Mavericks. In 1996-97, when he averaged career highs of 19.1 points and 7.9 rebounds in 44 games before being dealt to the New Jersey Nets just days after the All-Star Game. Though Gatling went on to play five more seasons in the NBA, he never replicated a campaign like his All-Star effort, although he averaged 10.3 points in 11 solid seasons.\n\nThe man known as \"Googs\" was a member of the NBA All-Rookie First Team in 1992, and played his best basketball during the first seasons of his career — spent with Washington, Golden State, Minnesota and Phoenix. With the Timberwolves, Gugliotta averaged at least 20 points in back-to-back seasons, and was an All-Star in '96-'97, when he scored a career-high clip of 20.6 points per game. He also pulled down an average of 8.7 boards and recorded 4.1 assists per game that season, one of which many serious NBA fans probably don't remember just how good Googs played.\n\nLaettner is one of the great college basketball players of all time. However, we tend to forget that while he wasn't as dominant on the NBA level and was traded six times, he played nearly 700 games over 13 seasons and averaged 12.8 points, 6.7 rebounds and 2.6 assists for his career. Many also might not remember that Laettner made the 1997 Eastern Conference All-Star team as a member of the Atlanta Hawks. That season, Laettner averaged 18.1 points, 8.8 boards and nearly 3 assists per contest.\n\nDavis was all about cleaning the glass during a successful 16-season NBA career. The first nine of those seasons came with Indiana, where the 6-9 Davis enjoyed his most consistent success on both ends of the floor. However, it wasn't until the final season of that run with the Pacers that Davis earned a well-deserved All-Star nod. It came in 2000, and during a season in which he averaged 10.0 points, nearly 10 rebounds and a little better than one blocked shot per contest.\n\nAnother potent big man with a 10-plus season NBA career. Though McDyess's most complete and consistent success came during the first seven seasons of his career, he was essentially a valuable asset right to the end of his 15-year NBA run in 2011. McDyess's only All-Star season of 2000-01 came during his second run with the Denver Nuggets. It was also the second time he averaged a double-double in points (20.8) and rebounds (12.1), while starting all 70 games he played on that campaign.\n\nSure, this list seems dominated by the same type of player: the hard-working big man that proved invaluable to NBA teams during the 1990s and into the 2000s. But, the praise is worthy, and while these type of players seem interchangeable, they each possess a unique talent. A 6-10, 235 pounds, Ratliff was a powerful post presence who led the league in blocks per game on three occasions during a 16-season NBA career. His lone All-Star selection came during an interesting 2000-01 season with Philadelphia, when he averaged career highs of 12.4 points, 8.3 rebounds and 3.74 blocks per game. However, Ratliff suffered a wrist injury prior to the mid-season showcase and was limited to just 50 games that campaign, which included his trade to Atlanta following the All-Star break.\n\nSzczerbiak had a respectable 10-season NBA playing career and remains a basketball fixture in the broadcasting world. A career 48.5-percent shooter, who also made more than 40 percent of his 3-point attempts, Szczerbiak was honored with his only All-Star selection during the 2001-02 season while starring for the Timberwolves as a third-year player. He averaged 18.7 points, shot 50.8 percent from the field and a career-best 45.5 percent from beyond the 3-point arc. Szczerbiak also dished out 3.1 assists that season.\n\nAtter starring in Russia, Kirilenko came to the U.S. early this century after he was the first Russian selected in the first round of the 1999 NBA Draft. However, that NBA career didn't begin until 2001, but by 2003-04, Kirilenko was an All-Star. That season, the 6-9 Kirilenko averaged 16.5 points and 8.1 rebounds, plus 3.1 assists and 2.8 blocks, while starting all 78 games he played. Though Kirilenko played until 2014-15, led the NBA in blocks (3.2 per game) in 2004-05 and was a first-team All-NBA Defensive First Team member in 2006, he only made the one All-Star appearance.\n\nThe Toronto native who also works for the Raptors organization, Magloire might be one of the more underrated NBA big men this century. The 6-10 Magloire played parts of 12 NBA seasons, and in 2004 became the second Canadian to be named an All-Star by the league — joining Steve Nash. That season, with the Hornets now playing in New Orleans, Magloire averaged career bests of 13.6 points and 10.3 rebounds, plus 1.23 blocked shots per contest, while starting all 82 games.\n\nHoward enjoyed a nice run of success with the Mavericks from 2004-10. During that stretch, he was named to the Western Conference All-Star team in 2007. For that season, the talented, though somewhat inconsistent, shooting guard averaged 18.9 percent from the field, and set career highs for both attempted 3-pointers (239) and makes (92) — resulting in a 38.5-percent shooting effort from distance. Howard also averaged nearly 7 rebounds and 2 assists per game that season.\n\nIf it seemed like Williams played in the NBA forever, it just felt that way. Actually, it was a rather impressive 13-season run for the popular guard, who was a gifted role player that also had his moments of stardom while playing with seven different clubs. Yet, fans should be able to agree that Williams' best days came as a member of the Cleveland Cavaliers. During his first go-round with the franchise, he was named to his only All-Star team in 2008-09. That season, he set career bests by averaging 17.8 points and shooting 43.6 percent from 3-point range. Seven years later, Williams returned to Cleveland and helped the franchise win their first NBA title.\n\nIt's safe to say that the 7-foot Kaman was a steady player throughout his 13-year NBA career, spent mostly with the Clippers. For that career, Kaman averaged 11.2 points, 7.6 rebounds and 1.3 assists. Though never considered a star, Kaman was named to a single All-Star squad during his NBA run. That came in 2009-10 — seven years into his career — when Kaman averaged 18.5 points and 9.3 boards while starting all 76 games he played during that season.\n\nDrafted No. 10 overall by the Lakers directly out of high school in 2005, Bynum never seemed to silence his NBA critics during a career that lasted eight seasons. He was chided for underachieving, labeled lazy and judged to be lacking the killer instinct needed to be a successful 7-foot, 294-pound center in the NBA. Pretty much, Lakers fans wanted a second-coming of Shaq, but that wasn't going to happen. That said, Bynum seemed to eventually find his form, and was eventually named an All-Star in 2012, during a season in which he set career highs of 18.7 points and 11.8 rebounds — plus averaged nearly 2 blocks per contest.\n\nOne of the great 3-point shooters in NBA history, Korver ranks within the top 10 all-time in league history with 2,450 made triples and a 42.9 shooting percentage from beyond the arc. However, during a strong NBA career that spanned 17 seasons (2004-20), he only averaged 9.7 points and was widely considered a role player of specialist. In fact, Korver didn't make his only All-Star team until his 12th season in the league, and with his fourth team, the Hawks. On that 2014-15 campaign, Korver averaged 12.1 points and shot 49.2 percent from distance in starting all 75 games he appeared for Atlanta."
