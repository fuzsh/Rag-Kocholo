        "text": "The Trail Blazers’ recent signing of Greg Stiemsma likely means that Chris Kaman’s time as a player is over in Portland.\n\nThe Trail Blazers added a veteran presence to their post rotation in the form of journeyman center Greg Stiemsma. With that signing, it likely means that Chris Kaman‘s final chapter as a player in Portland has already been written. Terry Stotts acknowledged that Kaman was keeping his options open on his NBA future, which kept some speculation alive that Portland could come calling before camp. Two of the last three signings have been post players, so it appears that the roster is relatively set before training camp.\n\nWhile Kaman was lost in the shuffle for most of last year, his time with the Trail Blazers shouldn’t be forgotten. In his first year with Portland he appeared in 74 games, which included 13 starts. Kaman averaged a solid 8.6 PPG and 6.5 RPG as Stotts’ primary option off of the bench. His ability to pick up the slack with Robin Lopez injured allowed for the Trail Blazers to keep pace in the playoff chase.\n\nHis role as a mentor during last season proved to be just as important. At 34 years old, Kaman served as the elder statesman of the Trail Blazers. His ability to put aside his pride and accept a leadership role should pay dividends for Portland in the years to come.\n\nPortland Trail Blazers guard Damian Lillard (0) celebrates with center Chris Kaman (35).

While he doesn’t have the same pedigree as a player like Kaman, he will still be asked to be a solid example for the younger players on the team. Stiemsma has battled his way onto four different NBA rosters since going undrafted out of Wisconsin. His hard work and determination to find a home in the league should be a model for the more unproven commodities at the bottom of Portland’s current roster.\n\nWhile a playing future in Portland might be out of the question for Kaman, a future role with the team isn’t far-fetched. He has shown a lot of respect for coach Stotts, so joining his coaching staff seems like a logical step. Either way, his time with the Trail Blazers should be remembered by the success that he brought to the organization as a mentor and as a player.\n\nMore from Rip City Project\n\nThis article originally appeared on"
