This document provides guidance on writing a memorandum for the bar exam. It discusses structuring the memorandum with a statement of facts, issues, and arguments. For the statement of facts, the document advises including only facts favorable to your client and citing evidence. For issues, it recommends limiting them to four and deriving them from your arguments, not the other way around. It also offers tips on phrasing issues and arguments clearly and simply. The overall message is to make the memorandum easy for the examiner to read by avoiding unnecessary complexity or creativity.",
