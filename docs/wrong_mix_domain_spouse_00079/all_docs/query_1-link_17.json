        "text": "Established 1996\n\nElectric power and energy systems are of great importance to the economic well being and competitiveness of the United States. The power engineering area at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is one of the leading programs in the nation, with extensive education and research activities. These awards were created through a gift from the Grainger Foundation to recognize the importance of the field and the performance of the graduates of the University of Illinois College of Engineering.\n\nPurpose\n\nTo reward highly qualified and well-motivated undergraduate and graduate students who have chosen to pursue a field of study in electric power engineering.\n\nUndergraduate awards\n\nA student completing a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree is eligible for consideration if all the following criteria are met:\n\nU.S. citizen or permanent U.S. resident (as defined by the U.S. DHS)\n\nenrolled in the Urbana-Champaign campus of the University of Illinois for at least two years\n\nsubmitted an application by the designated deadline\n\nsuccessfully completed all of the BS degree requirements in any engineering program at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign with a field of specialization in electric power engineering\n\nTo meet the requirements of a field of specialization in electric power engineering, the graduating senior must have successfully completed ECE 430 and a minimum of either all three courses in list A below, or two courses from list A and one course from list B below. Students who have additional involvement in electric power engineering activities such as independent research or student team projects will be given special consideration in the selection of awardees.\n\nList A: ECE 431, ECE 464, ECE 476\n\nList B: ECE 307, ECE 330, ECE 333, ECE 469, ENGR 491, ECE 486\n\nTo learn more or to apply for this award, please visit the Grainger Power Engineering Awards page.\n\nAward:\n\nThe recipient(s) will be recognized during an annual Student Awards Banquet. All student recipients are featured on the second floor of the ECE Building's Student Honors Wall.\n\nPast Recipients of the Award"
