        "text": "Romantic comedy set in London during the late 1800’s inspired by Oscar Wilde’s play. Rupert Everett plays Arthur Goring, an upper class, womanising bachelor famed for his idleness and wit. His best friend Sir Robert Chiltern (Jeremy Northam) is a respected politician with a captivating and righteous wife (Cate Blanchett). Arthur’s loyalty and friendship is put to the test when the foundation of his friend’s idyllic marriage is threatened by the arrival of the scheming Mrs Cheveley (Julianne Moore) carrying secrets from Sir Robert’s past. Arthur finds himself caught up in a web of love, betrayal and deceit as he attempts to console his friends and protect their marriage. His actions inadvertently lead to changes in his own life and future. Also stars Minnie Driver and John Wood. Screenplay by Oliver Parker. Photography by David Johnson. Edited by Guy Bensley.
