        "text": "Below is a full list of our 2024 Official Selections. This list is organized in alphabetical order. First by category, then by the film title. We strongly suggest that you use the find feature on your computer by pressing Command + F (For MAC users) and Control + F (For PC users). After pressing this combination of keys enter the name you are looking for. PLEASE NOTE: AAHSFF may change a submission category if we feel a film is a better fit or has a better chance of being selected in a different category - so your film may not appear in the original category you submitted to.\n\nWhat is an Official Selection? Official Selections are films that will be screened at the 2024 All American High School Film Festival from October 18th to October 20th, 2024 at the AMC Empire 25 Theaters in Times Square, NYC. Every year we receive thousands of films submitted by student filmmakers from around the world. All of our Official Selections are the best of the best, and have been selected by our panel of industry judges. All Official Selections are eligible to be nominated for an award. All award nominees and winners will be announced at the Teen Indie Awards on Sunday, October 20th at The Kings Theatre in Brooklyn, NY.\n\nWant to know more about festival events? Follow us on social media at @hsfilmfest and check out our 2024 Festival Page featuring: complete festival schedule of events, screening schedule, planning guides, maps, FAQ and more...\n\nIf your film was selected, congratulations! Please be sure to review the information below carefully. If you see any information that is incorrect please let us know as soon as possible by emailing info@aahsff.com. Monday, August 19th is the deadline to inform us of any errors before we lock in our festival programs for publishing.\n\nPlan on coming to the fest to see your film? Get your tickets, find out when your film will be screening, and check out our Festival Planning Guide.\n\nIf your film was not selected, know this: We started this festival ten years ago, and every year it gets more competitive. Every year we receive more submissions that illuminate higher quality storytelling and film technique and we simply cannot screen them all. Of course, this reinforces our belief that the future of film is brighter than ever before and we know you want to be a part of it. But stay focused, not getting in is just another moment in your journey. If you really love filmmaking (and we know you do!) the best thing you can do to improve is to attend the festival and soak in all of the resources we bring together... See what other high school students are creating and where the bar is set, attend panels and workshops designed to specifically help you grow, learn what colleges and universities are looking for, explore the latest technology, and most importantly, form relationships with other young filmmakers that share your dreams and who can help you as you develop your skills. Whatever you decide, don’t give up on your passion.\n\nKeep filming.\n\nKeep following your dreams.\n\nNever Stop Creating.\n\nSee you in New York City!\n\nBest,\n\nTom Oliva & Andrew
