        "text": "Idyllic 1950s suburban setting as neighbours and best friends endure a terrible tragedy that rents the two households apart.\n\nCelebrating her 43rd birthday, the immaculate Celine (Anne Hathaway) looks to the equally immaculate neighbour Alice (Jessica Chastain) for friendship and support. The two families are close with lives intertwined – their only sons are the same age and attend the same school. But tragedy strikes leaving the emotional balance of the two women teetering on the edge. Guilt, suspicion and manipulative behaviour results in uncertainty for the two friends.\n\nMothers’ Instinct looks ravishing in award-winning cinematographer Benoît Delhomme’s directorial debut feature – an English-language remake of the Belgian film Duelles. It’s sophisticated and stylish but more artifice than content as the callow, psychological power games unspool on screen.\n\nRating: 55%\n\nDirector: Benoît Delhomme\n\nWriter: Sarah Conradt (Night Always Comes, TV’s 50 States of Fright) – based on the novel by Barbara Abel\n\nMain cast: Anne Hathaway (Love & Other Drugs, The Idea of You), Jessica Chastain (A Most Violent Year, The Help), Eamon Patrick O’Connell (Darla in Space)\n\nA macho underground world of power and violence that is oddly compelling but deeply unpleasant as illegal gambling on survival tests the limits of acceptance.\n\nDesperately short of cash with his father in hospital without sufficient health insurance, electrician Vince Ferro (Sam Riley) takes on a dead man’s identity. Having overheard plans that should guarantee big bucks, Sam travels incognito in the hope of saving his father and the family home. But the remote country house, the expectation placed on him and 12 others along with the level of money passing hands leaves the thirteen comatose with fear.\n\nAn English-language remake of his Sundance-winning Georgian film 13 Tzameti, director Géla Babluani certainly attracted a top notch cast for what is ultimately a deeply distasteful narrative. Ruthless Jason Statham has more than $2 million on brother Ronald (Ray Winstone) but it appears Ben Gazzara is pulling the financial strings as the likes of Mickey Rourke look to survive the night of deep, psychological trauma and violence.\n\nRating: 40%\n\nDirector: Géla Babluani (13 Tzameti, Money)\n\nWriter: Géla Babluani (13 Tzameti, Money), Greg Pruss (Marlowe)\n\nMain cast: Sam Riley (Control, On the Road), Jason Statham (Spy, The Bank Job), Mickey Rourke (The Wrestler, Angel Heart)\n\nGentle, genteel and nuanced, Living is exquisitely understated as a faceless bureaucrat confronts a medical diagnosis where he is given only a few months to live.\n\n1950s London and a world of commuters, bowler hats, briefcases, stiff upper lips and social position. As Head of Public Works at London County Council, Mr Williams (a dignified Bill Nighy) is appropriately distant from the rest of his small team as paper applications swamp desks and which are eternally moved around departments for approval. On receiving the medical news, widowed, with his son and wife living in the family home and little outside interests, Williams realises he does not know how to spend his last few months. A chance encounter in the city with a former team member, Miss Harris (Aimee Lou Wood) changes all that as he finds a young soulmate to confide in and talk.\n\nButtoned-up emotions, English-style in this reworking of Akira Kurosawa’s 1952 film Ikiru, Living as directed by Oliver Hermanus carries considerable emotional power in spite of its quietude and silences.\n\nNominated for 2 Oscars in 2023 – best actor and adapted script (Kazuo Ishiguro)\n\nRating: 74%\n\nDirector: Oliver Hermanus (Moffie, Beauty)\n\nWriter: Kazuo Ishiguro (The Remains of the Day, Never Let Me Go)\n\nMain cast: Bill Nighy (Love Actually, Notes on a Scandal), Aimee Lou Wood (The Electrical Life of Louis Wain, TV’s Sex Education), Alex Sharp (The Trial of the Chicago 7, The Hustle)\n\nThe east coast of Ireland and four quietly jubilant sisters attend the funeral of conniving brother-in-law, John Paul (Claes Bang). The fifth of the clan, second eldest Grace (Anne-Marie Duff) mourns his accidental death. Or was it? Insurance brokers Clafflin & Sons are less than convinced, although the unscrupulous eldest son Thomas (Brian Gleeson) has his own reasons for not paying out the million Euros.\n\nOver ten episodes, Bad Sisters mixes the current with the immediate past as we witness the bullying John Paul totally control and isolate Grace. The other four siblings can only look on in dismay as Grace loses confidence and slowly withdraws from their sisterly activities. There’s only one course of action according to fourth sister, Bibi (Sarah Greene). Get rid of him.\n\nWith each of the four having their own reasons to despise their brother-in-law, the reasoning behind such drastic measures are, by combining drama and comedy, entertainingly explored. It can be patchy (the insurance brokers’ detective tactics to avoid payment quickly wears thin) and occasionally overreaching for a small coastal town. But with the distasteful and judgemental John Paul splendidly ‘bad’ and the sisters actions ‘justified’ in accordance with the narrative, Bad Sisters is an irreverent dramedy with a sharp, incisive script and packed with rounded characters (as eldest sister Eve, Sharon Horgan is also the creator of this adptation from a Belgian television series).\n\nRating: 74%\n\nFor all its over-the-top absurdities with a reckless and excessive police vehicle chase through the streets of LA in pursuit of a bank heist gone badly wrong, Ambulance is an unexpected entertainment from director Michael Bay (Armageddon, 13 Hours).\n\nA psychotic Danny Sharp (Jake Gyllenhaal – Brokeback Mountain, Nightcrawler) ropes in family man and best buddy Will (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II – The Trial of the Chicago 7, Us) as the driver in the $32 million heist. Everything that can go wrong does so with the two survivors resorting to the hijacking of the ambulance carrying shot cop, Officer Zach (Jackson White – TV’s Tell Me Lies, Mrs Fletcher) and paramedic Cam Thompson (Eiza González – Baby Driver, I Care a Lot). The chase is on…\n\nIt’s showy, it’s exhausting, it’s all pretty stupid muscular testosterone. But with time spent on character development in the confines of the ambulance and subplots out on the streets, Ambulance, against your better judgement, draws you in.\n\nAn English-language remake of the 2005 Danish film, Ambulancen.\n\nRating: 62%\n\nEntertaining if undemanding eight part miniseries as the son of the about-to-be-announced American ambassador to the UK and prominent U.S. media mogul Katherine Newman (Uma Thurman) is kidnapped. No financial recompense is demanded – only for Newman to ‘Tell the Truth’.\n\nThe ‘TTT’ gains ground globally just as five everyday Brits are targetted by the authorities back in the UK as likely suspects to the kidnapping. Claiming to not know each other, the five – all of whom were in the same New York hotel at the time of the abduction – are questioned but released, much to the frustration of the FBI. Unbeknownst to the five, they are all placed under surveillance.\n\nBut just how innocent are they? As, inevitably, their paths cross in a desperate attempt to prove their innocence, so secrets are revealed – the financier Natalie (Georgina Campbell) with dirty money stashed under her bed; electronics expert Aadesh (Kunal Nayyar) hacking corporate security firewalls; single mum and Oxford university lecturer Tara (Elizabeth Henstridge) guilty of a direct campaign against the Newman family and money. And that’s just for starters. Throw in an Irish assassin (Elyes Gabel), conflict between the two British and Americans heading the case (Noah Emmerich and Angela Coulby), family dramas and plenty of unexpected reveals, and Suspicion provides thrills and surprises over its eight part narrative.\n\nRating: 64%\n\nBased loosely on Israeli series Kfulim\n\nMelbourne-set miniseries as three members of the same family explore and experience love.\n\nWith the death of his wife Christine (Sarah Peirse) after a long illness, Glen (Hugo Weaving) finds himself alone for the first time in 40 years. His live-at-home university student son Aaron (William Lodder) is in the thralls of first love with the older Ella (Shalom Brune-Franklin) whilst approaching-forty daughter Clara (Bojana Novakovic) is on a dating app looking for the elusive partner.\n\nThus the stage is set for an engaging if inconsistent six episode miniseries as the dramas and melodramas of contemporary life ebb and flow on screen. Persuaded to travel on the luxury holiday he had booked as an anniversary present, Glen meets Anita (Heather Mitchell). Clara bumps into neighbour and model Peter (Bob Morley) whilst Aaron is blind to the feelings of longterm schoolfriend, Jesse (Mitzi Ruhlmann). Lots of opportunities for the concept of love and acceptance are thus there to be explored.\n\nDealing with the loneliness of a strained final years within marriage and the guilt of meeting someone so quickly after his wife’s death, Weaving, as usual, is impeccable. With Mitchell and the occasional glimpse of Peirse, it is by far the strongest narrative whilst the ultra-successful medico Sarah and Morley provide the glamour. Sadly, the weakest link is the story of young love. Lodder is a mollycoddled young 21 year-old and a relationship with the sassy DJ, Ella, fails to convince. Love Me overall, however, is an easy going watch as the separate narratives interweave and interconnect.\n\nBased on the original Swedish series written by Josephine Bornebusch\n\nRating: 63%\n\nAn English-language remake of the French hit La famille Bélier, CODA moves the action to a coastal fishing village in New England as teenage Ruby (Emilia Jones) struggles to be the only hearing member of her family.\n\nIt’s a feelgood narrative underpinned with wry humour and serious issues – the isolation of the family in a close-knit community and the pressures placed on Ruby to translate for her family. As school years come to a close, Ruby’s dream is to enrol in Berklee College of Music in Boston. But with the family having no idea how good a singer she is, the concern is for their fishing business.\n\nA sincere and heartwarming crowd pleaser, CODA, with an exceptional cast, provides rare mainstream focus on its subject. Writer/director Sian Heder allows the film to evolve into total predictability, but when you have Troy Kotsur in the cast as dad, it’s best to simply go with the flow.\n\nExpect Oscar nominations.\n\n(Update: Nominated for 3 Oscars in 2022, won 3 – best film, best supporting actor (Kotsur), adapted screenplay)\n\nRating: 73%\n\nDirector: Sian Heder (Tallulah)\n\nWriter: Sian Heder (Tallulah) – adapted from the French language film La famille Bélier\n\nMain cast: Emilia Jones (High-Rise, One Day), Troy Kotsur (The Number 23, Wild Prairie Rose), Marlee Matlin (Children of a Lesser God, TV’s Switched at Birth)\n\nAn English-language remake of the multi award-winning Danish feature Den Skyldige, director Antoine Fuqua wisely sticks to the claustrophobic magic of the original in the race against time to save a kidnapped woman.\n\nDemoted and likely to be disgraced police officer Joe Baylor (Jake Gyllenhaal) finds himself on the eve of his enquiry in the emergency call dispatch centre when a phone call comes in. Emily (he discovers) has been kidnapped and is in the back of a vehicle. Her young children are left alone at home. A frantic response as Baylor tries to track her and her children down. But not all is as it seems.\n\nConfined to the dispatch centre with Gyllenhaal never off screen, The Guilty is an intense, emotive experience. But, lacking in the conviction of the material, banks of video monitors showing news footage of out-of-control Californian forest fires provide a visual distraction. Anger, frustration, relief, joy – all short-lived, all a little like watching acting exercise tropes. It’s all a little too intense, a little too try-hard.\n\nRating: 64%\n\nDirector: Antoine Fuqua (The Equalizer, Southpaw)\n\nWriter: Nic Pizzolatto (The Magnificent Seven, TV’s True Detective) – English-language remake of the Danish film Den Skyldige\n\nMain cast: Jake Gyllenhaal (Brokeback Mountain, Southpaw), Riley Keough (voice) (American Honey, Logan Lucky), Peter Sarsgaard (voice) (An Education, Blue Jasmine)\n\nSurprisingly maligned on its release as merely ‘excellent’, such is the expectation of the work of Martin Scorsese, The Departed finally saw him collect a long-overdue best director Oscar in 2007 (Scorsese is the most-nominated living director (nine) but still only has one win to his name).\n\nSet in Boston and the Irish-American organised crime world, all Scorsese’s trademarks – psychological drama, violence, profanity, corruption – are in abundance that, whilst convoluted, is one of his most accessible narratives. Jack Nicholson has ruled South Boston for years, placing Matt Damon inside the Boston Police Force and ensuring he is fast-tracked to promotion. That same police force has placed Leonardo DiCaprio so far undercover only two people know of his identity. When it becomes clear there’s a mole in each organistion, the two need to find a way to do their job and save themselves.\n\nFull of energy with twists and turns aplenty, The Departed is a thrilling ride with a stellar cast (DiCaprio a standout) and cracking script delivering a hugely entertaining crime story. But, like most Scorese films, it’s not for the faint-hearted.\n\nNominated for 5 Oscars in 2007 including best supporting actor (Mark Wahlberg), won 4 – best film, director, adapted screenplay, editing.\n\nRating: 80%\n\nDirector: Martin Scorsese (GoodFellas, The Irishman)\n\nWriter: William Monahan (Body of Lies, The Gambler) – adapted from Hong King film Infernal affairs written by Alan Mak and Felix Chong\n\nMain cast: Matt Damon (Good Will Hunting, Bourne), Leonardo DiCaprio (The Revenant, Titanic), Jack Nicholson (One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, Chinatown)"
