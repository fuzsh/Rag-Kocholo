        "text": "My favorite play was Othello. Othello is a very complex play. Iago turns the play on its head, and brings the audience along for the ride. He never seemed to have any true clear cut motives for what his actions. Maybe it was just money or jealousy. Iago is possibly Shakespeare’s greatest villain. He is a fantastically great manipulator, and even fools the audience for a time. How can we trust what he tells us about things we cannot or will not see? Iago played us all as much as he played himself.\n\nIago is one of the most misunderstood villains in Shakespeare literature. We side with Othello from the start because his name is on the cover of our paperback, we read Othello when learning about heroes, so we expect Iago to be a villain, a ruthless manipulator. We don’t know why, he doesn’t state it plainly or in simple English, so we assume that he’s evil, that he’s just a disgruntled sociopath out to exact his exaggerated revenge on good and noble Othello. Iago’s misunderstood reputation is a result of not truly examining his character, and answering the “why” factor behind his actions. After all, everyone is innocent until proven guilty. His goal in the play was not just to destroy Othello for the fun of it. His objective,\n\nThis next part of Iago’s character plays an equally important role in the play. An article says that a “... superb ability of Iago is that he has an acute eye for his victim's weaknesses and exploits them mercilessly.” (“Villainous Role of Iago in Othello”). Iago is able to use the characters weaknesses against them for his own selfish reasons. While the audience is aware of Iago’s plan, the other characters are oblivious to his evil\n\nThroughout Oliver Parker’s filmed rendition of this Shakespearean classic, audiences are able to feel bourgeois while indulging in an elite art, while still understanding everything that is going on in the story; which is a big testament to the actors, as well as the rest of the creative team. Enjoyable moments are plentiful throughout this film, not only story wise, but also involving the actors/actresses’ performances. The most intriguing character in the film, hands down, is Iago (Kenneth Branagh). Branagh’s Iago perfectly portrays just how manipulative the character is, and showcases all of the techniques that AMDA preaches. His moment to\n\nWilliam Shakespeare’s Othello, the Moor of Venice is a play of great manipulation and jealousy. Iago is the antagonist character of the play Othello. Iago becomes irate and filled with jealousy when Othello names Michael Cassio as his lieutenant, because Iago believed he should have been the one promoted not Michael Cassio. By manipulating everyone around him, Iago portrays himself as an honest noble man whom can be trusted. Iago being known for the honest man he earns everyone’s trust and therefore learns their weakness for his ultimate plan of destruction. Iago’s greatest skill is disguising his manipulative schemes of destroying and betraying the ones around him with what he leads people to believe as honesty. Iago uses their\n\nThroughout the play Iago portrays a great deal of fraudulence, He acts as if all he wants is the success of others but it is the complete opposite. Throughout the Play he it seemed as if that he and Rodrigo were the bestest of friends. He gives Rodrigo something he seemed to not have much of , Hope he gave Rodrigo hope that one day with his help he could win over desdemona for him while getting his revenge on Othello at the same time. Iago is by far the fakest character anyone could ever read about.\n\nJealousy is a powerful drug. When someone is jealous, one can only imagine how far someone would go because of it. In the play Othello by William Shakespeare, there were several characters that went through different ways of processing their jealousy. Iago’s jealousy provokes his idea to get back at the people he felt was not deserving enough of the things they had or their happiness. His plans succeeds but by the end, no one wins. Iago’s jealousy forms at the beginning of the play which causes Othello’s jealousy towards the end and because of it, it results in people hurt mentally and physically.\n\nThe scene features Othello and Desdemona kissing which builds upon the dramatic passion they share for each other. You can infer by Othello’s demeanor that he is confident and proud of his actions and also Iago’s feelings toward Othello are very comparable to the play. When Iago states, “I hate the Moor” it is obvious that he does not like Othello, but he says that when he is alone, so only the audience knows of his hatred for Othello. Contrariwise, in the play’s first scene Roderigo states, “Thou toldst me thou didst hold him in they hate” and Iago replies “Despise me if I do not” (Othello. 1.1). Because this is not in the film the director used a different strategy to reveal Iagos strategy to destroy Othello by using Chess pieces. Parker uses mysterious lighting and a fireplace to give the audience a feeling of mischievousness while Iago situates the Black King and White Queen next to each other, then he inserts a white knight in between, which is clearly representative of him. The film audience feels Iago’s split personality much easier than the play due to the facial expressions enhanced by camera angles, and music. He seems to be everyone’s friend, and even Othello calls him “Honest Iago”. Othello is consistently seen as a military hero, honorable and noble, so when he is overwhelmed by weakness it puts the\n\nBy the middle of the play Othello’s mood and demeanor seem to shift from being peaceful and patient to very anxious, paranoid, and gullible. For example when Othello is talking to Iago and Iago suggests that maybe his wife is not being faithful to him, it becomes Othello’s obsession to get down to the bottom of it and catch her. “I have been talking with your suitor here, a man that languishes in your displeasure / Who is’t you mean / Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord” (III.iii.41-43). In this dialog between Othello and Iago, with just two sentences Iago causes Othello to lose trust in his wife and believe she is being unfaithful to him which grows stronger and stronger each scene of the play. Because Iago is extremely cunning and manipulative, he is able to control almost anyone he chooses and he is in control of Othello’s emotions because he knows the things Othello fears. Iago is pretending to be Othello’s friend but secretively is going behind his back and bringing him down. Iago convinces Othello that Cassio is having an affair with Desdemona. “I humbly do beseech"
