The new film is The Great Escaper, starring Michael Caine and the late Glenda Jackson. They natter about how the film came to be, and the challenges involved in making the film.\n\nThey also recall when Parker managed to get Othello down to just over two hours, and running times in general. Plus, in a not entirely expected turn, they end up chatting too about Clive Barker, and the plans once upon a time to bring Hellraiser to the stage!\n\nThe Great Escaper is in UK cinemas on October 6th 2023.\n\n—\n\nThank you for visiting!
