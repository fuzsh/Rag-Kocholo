        "text": "The winners of the 2022 British Animation Awards have been announced with Britain’s two Oscar-nominated short films Affairs of the Art and Robin Robin winning their categories.\n\nAffairs of the Art, created by Joanna Quinn and Les Mills, picked up three awards: Best Short Film, Writers Award and Best Voice Performance (for 86-year-old Little Britain star Menna Trussler as ‘Beryl’).\n\nRobin Robin, Aardman Animations’ Netflix Original film about an optimistic robin raised by a family of mice, won the award for Best Original Music for its score written by The Bookshop Band – Ben Please and Beth Porter.\n\nLondon-based animation studio Magic Light Pictures was successful in two categories, with BBC-One Christmas special Zog and the Flying Doctors winning for Best Use of Sound and Milkshake! and Sky Kids series Pip and Posy, picking up the award for Best Children’s Pre-School. Meanwhile, the Best Children’s category was won by Fourth Wall’s feline-focused series Milo, also shown on Channel 5’s Milkshake!\n\nOne of the closest-fought categories of the night was the Best Long Form category, which saw victory for Locksmith Animations’ debut feature Ron’s Gone Wrong. Directed by Jean-Phillipe Vine, Sarah Smith and Octavio E Rodriguez, the film tells the story of a socially-awkward middle-schooler who befriends a defective robot.\n\nBest Animation in a Commercial category was Airwick for its Breath of Nature campaign, directed by Peter Szewczyk of Nerd Productions. And the Best Music Video Award went to animator Ged Haney, with his video for Rocket Freudental’s ‘Der Stuhlkreis’.\n\nA hard-hitting film featuring the voices of some of Hollywood’s hottest stars picked up the award for Best Factual. Save Ralph, an animated short film warning about the cruelty of testing on animals, produced for the Humane Society International, was written and directed by Spencer Susser and featured the voices of Taika Waititi, Ricky Gervais, Zac Efron and Oliver Munn. Meanwhile, the Social Good category was won by Typically, a film aiming to remove the taboo surrounding periods, produced for period poverty charity Bloody Good Period and directed by Anna Ginsburg and Caitlin McCarthy.\n\nIn two of the new categories for 2022, the Best Immersive Animation award was picked up by Grant Berry and Dane Winn’s The Beast, while the Wildcard category was won by Osbert Parker’s Timeline.\n\nThe Cutting-Edge award was won by Jamie Jay Johnson and Asa Movshovitz’s E4 series about a role-playing fantasy game Dead Pixels. And this year’s Design Award was won by Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey, a Netflix Original directed by Ian Spendloff, with VFX by Lucy Hare.\n\nSome of the leading British animation courses were represented in the Best Undergraduate and Best Postgraduate Student film categories including nominees from Falmouth University School of Film and Television, University of Creative Arts in Farnham, Arts University Bournemouth, Royal College of Arts London and National Film & Television School. The winners were Renee Zahn’s (NFTS) O Black Hotel! for Best Postgraduate Student Film and Miles Jezuita’s (Arts University Bournemouth) Suburb for Best Undergraduate Student Film.\n\nIntroduced in 2020, The Lamb Award bridges the gap between current categories which recognise student achievements and general best-in-class awards, and is open to any young professionals working in the animation and VFX industry. The winner of the 2022 Lamb Award is Production Coordinator Hodan Abdi, who was nominated by Illuminated Films.\n\nThree awards on the night were decided by members of the public, voting for their favourites in a special online poll. The winners of these audience awards were: Tony Comley’s Time to Recover for Best Music Video, Uri Lotan’s Black Slide for Best Short Film and Sky Kids’ hit children’s series The Brilliant World of Tom Gates for the Children’s Choice Award.\n\nBAA Director Helen Brunsdon and Producer Kieran Argo said: “We have been amazed at the quality of the entrants for this year’s British Animation Awards and would like to offer our heartfelt congratulations to all the winners and nominees. After a particularly tough couple of years animation continues to be one of the most productive and creative industries in the UK”.\n\nThe full list of finalists and winners\n\nBest Long Form\n\nSesame Street’s: The Monster at The End of the Story – Dir: Mark Taylor\n\nRon’s Gone Wrong – Dir: Jean- Philippe Vine, Sarah Smith, Octavio E Rodriguez (Co-Director)\n\nShaun the Sheep: The Flight Before Christmas – Dir: Steve Cox\n\nBest Voice Performance\n\nTaika Waititi and Ricky Gervais – Save Ralph\n\nMenna Trussler – Beryl in Affairs of the Art\n\nBen Wishaw – The Adventures of Paddington\n\nBella Ramsey – Hilda: The Fifty Year Night\n\nBel Powley- Little My in Moominvalley\n\nBest Children’s Series\n\nThe Brilliant World of Tom Gates – Dir: George Sawyer\n\nMilo – Dir: Chris Capstick\n\nHilda: The Deerfox – Dir: Andy Coyle\n\nBest Children’s Pre-School\n\nThe Adventures of Paddington – Dir: Adam Shaw, Chris Drew\n\nHey Duggee – Dir: Grant Orchard, Sander Jones\n\nCircle Square – Dir: Greg Mcleod\n\nMilo – Dir: Chris Capstick\n\nPip and Posy – Dir: Jeroen Jaspaert, Matt Tea\n\nBest Animation in a Commercial\n\nThe Girl Who Built a Rocket – Dir: Neeraja Rj\n\nBreath of Nature – Dir: Peter Szewczyk\n\nSave Ralph – Dir: Spencer Susser\n\nMotoGP Returns – Dir: Andton Alfimenko\n\nBest Music Video\n\nRocket Freudental, Der Stuhlkreis – Dir: Ged Haney\n\nMama Jerk and the Ladyfingers, Mountain – Dir: Harrison Fleming\n\nFoo Fighters, Chasing Birds – Dir: Emlyn Davies, Josh Hicks\n\nChristy Moore, The Voyage – Dir: Jessica Patterson\n\nJamie Cullum, Age of Anxiety – Dir: Neil Pymer\n\nWriters Award\n\nCircle Square: Pizza Mystery – Myles Mcleod\n\nAffairs of the Art – Les Mills\n\nRon’s Gone Wrong – Peter Baynham and Sarah Smith\n\nThe Rubbish World of Dave Spud: Twinfestation – Madeleind Brettingham\n\nShaun the Sheep: The Flight Before Christmas – Mark Burton and Giles Pilbrow\n\nBest Post Graduate Film\n\nO Black Hole!
