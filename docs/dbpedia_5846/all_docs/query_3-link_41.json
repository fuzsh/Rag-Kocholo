        "text": "An Othello so weak in conception that Iago emerges as the principal character, Oliver Parker’s film adaptation of Shakespeare’s tragedy is one of the worst movies ever drawn from the world’s greatest playwright. Parker sounds a single glum note throughout, and his Othello, Laurence Fishburne, is dreadful beyond measure. Account this an Othello without an Othello—at least, without one that matters.\n\nNor does Fishburne make even the most superficial sense in the part. He isn’t as old as his bride Desdemona’s father, and therefore the latter’s objection to the marriage, cloaking too familiar feelings, loses a major portion of its motivation. The upshot is that a light is shone on the racial difference between groom and bride. Yet here also the casting of Fishburne distracts. An African American, Fishburne is too light-skinned to convince as the black Moor, and numerous shots of this Othello and his Desdemona scarcely manage much of a contrast in their complexions. A darker actor, or a white one in blackface, would have made more sense, not just to underscore the racial (and class) divide, but also to help develop the racial metaphor for Othello’s “layers” of identity, the virtue buried beneath the disdained visage of a soldier with a heathen past. Fishburne brings nothing of value to his performance, which he cranks out as though taking cues from an offscreen coach.\n\nFishburne’s Othello’s sexual and racial jealousy, incidentally, falls far short of raging passion. Rather, it possesses the tentativeness of a half-swallowed sigh.\n\nThe real protagonist of this version is Iago, not Othello—the trusted ensign and, beneath his “white” surface, vicious villain who exploits Othello’s sensitivities in order to help bring about the hero’s downfall. Kenneth Branagh is excellent as Iago. Regrettably, the Othello here is so flimsy that, through no fault of Branagh’s, it becomes fun to watch Iago take this Othello down.\n\nIrène Jacob, surpassingly lovely and the soul of innocence, is the Desdemona of our dreams. I named Jacob 1995’s best supporting actress for her splendid acting in both Michelangelo Antonioni’s Beyond the Clouds and this film. Jacob, of course, is one of the greatest actresses on earth; she was named best actress at Cannes for the exquisite Double Life of Veronique (1991) and was superb again in yet another film by Krzysztof Kieślowski, Red, the masterpiece of his Tri-Color Trilogy (1994).\n\nApart from Fishburne’s, the acting is not the problem in Parker’s film. (Nathaniel Parker, whom we seem to watch being drained of youth, is a fine Michael Cassio.) The problem is Oliver Parker’s puny conception of a towering and tremendous play."
