        "text": "An exercise for senior high school students based on Oliver Parker’s film adaptation of Othello (1995). The film is widely available in DVD format from school and public libraries. Alternatively, it may be purchased and downloaded from a number of streaming service providers.\n\nIn order for students to complete this exercise it is necessary that teachers first provide a viewing of two scenes from the film which should be identified as ‘Scene A’ and ‘Scene B’. The scenes are:\n\nScene A: ‘Look to your wife’ - Iago suggests to Othello that Desdemona has been unfaithful to him (film time 49:26 – 53:04, corresponding play text Act 3 Scene 3 lines 199–272)\n\nScene B: ‘These men’ - a heartbroken Desdemona discusses marital infidelity with Emilia (film time 1:27:16 – 1:29:39, corresponding text: Act 4 Scene 3 lines 55–100).\n\nThe exercise tests students’ capacity to analyse the techniques used by the director and explain how these techniques enhance the viewer’s understanding of the play script. The exercise could be set as a test. Answer suggestions have been provided.\n\nSuggested curriculum relevance Australian Curriculum - English (Senior secondary curriculum) Unit 1\n\nACELR002 - Investigate and reflect on different ways of reading literary texts including how mode, medium and form shape responses to texts\n\nUnit 2\n\nACELR028 - Compare and evaluate the form, language and content of literary texts including the use of a combination of sound and visual devices in literary texts, for example, soundtracks, cinematography, iconography\n\nNational Curriculum in England - English programmes of study: key stage 4 Reading\n\nPupils should be taught to understand and critically evaluate texts through\n\nexploring aspects of plot, characterisation, events and settings, the relationships between them and their effects\n\nPlease provide a rating. Comments and suggestions are welcome.\n\nCover image: detail from ‘16th-century costume guide’ by Cesare Vecellio (1598). British Library, identifier 003765638. Public Domain."
