        "text": "This is the humiliating morning after, in which I confess that the wires of my natural pessimism and my considered reflections got crossed—as, for instance, where I suspected, in my Oscars prediction post last week, that Natalie Portman’s extraordinary performance would be overshadowed by Annette Bening’s sentimental one, and where I imagined that no reasonable person, even one who chose “The King’s Speech” for Best Picture, could consider its director’s work superior to that of David Fincher on “The Social Network.” (I picked the winner in ten of the twenty-four categories.) Well, the Hollywood gerontocracy has spoken, and we can count on seeing many more movies in which royals act cute. I was pleasantly surprised by Natalie Portman’s win, which I didn’t expect; after my post went up last Friday, I landed on a Web site, Film Experience, that offers a fascinating analysis of the ages of Best Actor and Actress victors, which might well have swayed my prediction. Best Actor awards preponderate for men in their late thirties to mid-forties; for Best Actress, the swell is in the thirties—and yet “29 is the most common age to win Best Actress.” That’s Natalie Portman’s age, and it’s worth recalling, vulgarly but accurately, that old men tend to like looking at young women.\n\nBut the real news regarding Portman’s Oscar triumph is that she also won for Best Actress on Saturday night, too, at the Film Independent Spirit Awards. “Black Swan” was a relatively inexpensive film to make: it was budgeted at $13 million; to date, it has taken in over $100 million at the box office. The movie was named Best Picture at the Spirit Awards, and Darren Aronofsky, who also won Best Director for it, said, in his acceptance speech (according to Deadline.com):\n\nProducer Brian Oliver and his company made a really terrible deal to get this movie made. People said they would never make money on it and now they are fucking rich.\n\nAnd both best-supporting Oscars, which went to Christian Bale and Melissa Leo, also came in a relatively low-budget film: “The Fighter” cost $25 million to make, and has taken in $90 million. The takeaway? It’s good for actors to get involved with artistically ambitious directors on projects that don’t, on the face of it, look like conventionally commercial productions. So those such as Mark Harris—who, in his lament in GQ titled “The Day the Movies Died,” worries about the “decades-long marginalization of the very notion of creative ambition by the studios”—are just wrong: ambitious, audacious, original, and personal movies made on a (relatively) low budget are already attracting some of the best talent in the house. When, as now, the rewards for working on such films (financial and professional as well as artistic) are potentially so great, even more Hollywood people will clamor to do so. The artists won’t let the studios determine the entire course of their professional lives, and the studios will get involved with these films because it’s often in their best interest. And as for “the stuff in the middle” that Harris frets about—well, that’s “The King’s Speech,” and it’s doing just fine, alas.\n\nP.S. In a historical moment in which political revolutions are being made in part by way of the power of social media (and for anyone who thinks that the Internet is politically incidental, it’s worth considering why China and other authoritarian regimes take such pains to control it), it’s interesting to look at the fundamental difference between “The King’s Speech” and “The Social Network” (beside obvious ones of artistic quality)—namely, the difference between hard and soft power. What gives the British drama its kick is the political context of King George VI’s oratorical obligations: the Second World War. It’s the good war, and the drama of the King who rouses his subjects to fight it also rouses Hollywood’s unambiguous spirits. Whereas “The Social Network” depicts the creation of a new sort of power, one that, from the very start, destabilizes and challenges acknowledged authority—it’s the drama of the creation of a tool that, as Mark Zuckerberg and Sean Parker say in the movie, is “cool” precisely because “we don’t know what it can be, we don’t know what it will be.” And the idea of concentrating such epochal yet amorphous power in the hands of a college student must give the insiders of the movie industry, as of any industry, long and serious pause—a pause long enough to cost the film, its director, and its star their deserved awards."
