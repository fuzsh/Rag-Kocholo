        "text": "Pop singer Eason Chan released his latest studio album, titled Chin Up!, on Oct 27.\n\nThe album features eight new songs, all composed by Terence Lam, arranged by award-winning producer Ronghao Li and Lam. With this album, Chan says he wishes to invigorate those going through life's ups and downs, offering encouragement and resilience to face the future with optimism.\n\nOne of the songs from the new album, named Homo Sapiens, was awarded the Song of the Year award at the inaugural Wave Music Awards hosted by Tencent Music Group, and was also recognized at the 34th Golden Melody Awards for Best Lyrics.\n\nOn Friday, he also renewed his contract with the Universal Music Greater China â€” China vision of the Universal Music Group, which is a leading music-based entertainment company.\n\nThis extended partnership between UMGC and Chan signifies the continuation of more than 19 years of musical collaboration between the artist and label.\n\nDuring the news conference in Macao on Friday, a music video of Chan's new song, Don't Mind Me, was premiered, featuring an appearance of award-winning actor Tony Leung.\n\nIn his decadeslong career, Chan has released 22 albums and Eps, gaining 154 chart-topping singles.\n\nIn November 2021, Chan's single, Warrior of the Darkness, skyrocketed to become a phenomenon in the Chinese music market. With less than two years since its release, the song has garnered more than 8.4 billion streams.\n\n\"Four years in the making, this new album truly reflects the journey of my mind in the past isolated few years. My deepest appreciation and admiration to this album's co-producers Terence Lam and Ronghao Li, who also made spectacular arrangements for these lovely tunes. And to my dear friend, a true legend, Tony Leung, for taking part in the latest music video of Don't Mind Me,\" said Chan in Macao on Nov 3.\n\nReflecting upon the cherished moments over the past 19 years with Universal Music Group, he said that \"it has been an unforgettable voyage\"."
