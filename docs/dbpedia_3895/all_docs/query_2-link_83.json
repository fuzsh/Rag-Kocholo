        "text": "\"I Am > I Was\" (pronounced “I am greater than I was”), the second studio album from Atlanta rapper 21 Savage, was released in late December. It went on to debut at No. 1 on Billboard’s first album chart of 2019, and remained at the top for a second week.\n\n\"I Am > I Was\" features guest vocals from many fellow Atlantans, including Childish Gambino, Offset, Gunna, Lil Baby and 21 Savage’s cousin, Young Nudy, along with J. Cole, Post Malone, Schoolboy Q, Travis Scott and others. Behind the production board, Atlanta’s Metro Boomin, Southside, TM88, FKi 1st and Wheezy are among the beatmakers crafting the tracks."
