The song truly brought the band to the mainstream, and reached number one in the UK.\n\nIt ended up topping the US charts too in 1988, after being performed at Nelson Mandela's birthday tribute concert.\n\nPhil Collins - 'Another Day in Paradise'\n\nPhil Collins - Another Day In Paradise (Official Music Video)\n\nThis ballad saw Phil Collins sing the tune from a third-person perspective, looking at a man crossing the street to ignore a homeless woman, imploring listeners not to turn a blind eye to those in need.\n\nPhil Collins releases the original demo version of 'Another Day in Paradise', and it's amazing to hear\n\nThe 10 greatest Phil Collins songs ever, ranked\n\nIt became Phil's seventh and final number one single in America, while David Crosby of Crosby, Stills and Nash appears on backing vocals.\n\nCulture Club - 'Karma Chameleon'\n\nCulture Club - Karma Chameleon (Official Music Video)\n\nThis was the song that made Boy George an even bigger star around the world. It was the UK's biggest selling single of 1984 and topped the US chart.\n\nThe Story of... 'Karma Chameleon'\n\nBoy George later explained the song: \"It is about the terrible fear of alienation that people have, the fear of standing up for one thing. It's about trying to suck up to everybody.\n\n\"Basically, if you aren't true, if you don't act like you feel, then you get Karma-justice, that's nature's way of paying you back.\"\n\nRick Astley - 'Never Gonna Give You Up'\n\nRick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up (Official Music Video)\n\nIf there's one song from the Stock, Aitken and Waterman era that has stood the test of time, it's Rick Astley's international number one smash.\n\nThe 1987 dance-pop anthem has lived long in the memory thanks to the Rickroll craze that still goes on today, and the video has been streamed over 1 billion times.\n\nSting - 'Englishman In New York'\n\nSting - Englishman In New York\n\nThe ‘Englishman’ in question in this song is the famous eccentric and gay icon Quentin Crisp. Sting wrote the song not long after Crisp moved from London to an apartment in the Bowery in Manhattan.\n\nSting's 10 greatest songs ever, ranked\n\nCrisp had remarked jokingly to the musician “that he looked forward to receiving his naturalization papers so that he could commit a crime and not be deported.”\n\nThere's not many songs that can feature both a drum breakdown and a saxophone solo closer and still be a massive pop hit.\n\nINXS - 'Need You Tonight'\n\nINXS - Need You Tonight (Official Video)\n\nThis funk rock track has one of the most recognisable riffs of the 1980s.\n\nMichael Hutchence: INXS singer's tragic death and his relationship with Kylie Minogue explained\n\nThe band's Andrew Farriss said that the riff appeared suddenly in his head while waiting for a taxi to go to the airport to fly to Hong Kong. He asked the driver to wait a couple of minutes while he grabbed something from his motel room.\n\nHowever, he went up to record the riff and came back down an hour later with a tape to a very annoyed driver.\n\nSpandau Ballet - 'True'\n\nSpandau Ballet - True (HD Remastered)\n\nThis was the song that turned Spandau Ballet from potential one album wonders to true pop legends.\n\nSpandau Ballet's 10 greatest songs ever, ranked\n\nGary Kemp wrote this love song at his parents' house as a homage to Motown and Marvin Gaye. He said: \"'True' became a song about writing a love song. Why 'Why do I find it hard to write the next line? I want the truth to be said?' Because I didn't want to write it down—because there's nothing more embarrassing.\"\n\nIt soon became something of a standard, and one of the best love songs of all time.\n\nVan Halen - 'Jump'\n\nVan Halen - Jump (Official Music Video)\n\nVan Halen’s most successful single was the lead track from their 1984 album, and differs from earlier Van Halen songs in that it is driven by a rolling synth line (played on an Oberheim OB-Xa by Eddie Van Halen).\n\nAfter years as an instrumental, David Lee Roth attempted to come up with lyrics, and remembered seeing a TV report about a man threatening jump off of a building, and that onlookers would probably shout “go ahead and jump”. Instead of being about death, the words were written as an invitation to love.\n\nBilly Ocean - 'When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going'\n\nBilly Ocean - When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going (Official Video)\n\nProbably Billy Ocean's biggest and most famous hit, this track reached number one in the UK and number two in the US.\n\nBilly Ocean's 10 greatest ever songs, ranked\n\nThe Story of... 'When the Going Gets Tough', as told by Billy Ocean\n\nIt was the theme tune to the Michael Douglas movie The Jewel in the Crown and its sequel, and was later a number one for Boyzone in 1999 in aid of Comic Relief.\n\nThe Story of... 'When the Going Gets Tough' by Billy Ocean\n\nBruce Hornsby and the Range - 'The Way It Is'\n\nThe Way It Is\n\nThis track deals with various social injustices, referencing divides between the rich and poor and racial segregation, and how the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was a victory in the civil rights movement, but how more is still needed.\n\nIts famous piano melody later sampled in the 2Pac track ‘Changes’. The song was Hornsby’s most successful, reaching the top spot in the States.\n\nHeart - 'Alone'\n\nHeart - Alone\n\nComposed by Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly, this power ballad first appeared via their 1983 pet project, I-Ten, on Taking a Cold Look.\n\n19 of the greatest power ballads of all time\n\nIt was later recorded by Valerie Stevenson and John Stamos for the soundtrack of the CBS sitcom Dreams in 1984.\n\nBut it wasn't until US rock band Heart cover it that it became a hit, scoring a number one with it three years later.

The whole time I thought I was being cool, being this two-timer, but there really wasn't that much emotion involved.\n\n\"I did feel guilty about the first girl – and I have seen her since – and the idea of the song was about her.
