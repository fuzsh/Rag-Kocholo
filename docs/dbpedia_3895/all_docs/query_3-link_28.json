Fans of heavier music can head to Underground Arts and Franklin Music Hall for This is Hardcore, a festival dedicated to none other than hardcore.\n\nEven post-summer the concerts show no sign of slowing down. Charli XCX and Troye Sivan, Billie Eilish and Justin Timberlake are coming to town this fall.\n\nWhy go home after the encore? Book the Visit Philly Overnight Package and get free hotel parking and choose-your-own-adventure perks, including two tickets to The Franklin Institute, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, or the National Constitution Center and the Museum of the American Revolution.
