        "text": "Concerts\n\nGrammy-nominated Dove Winning the Collingsworth Family and Triumphant Quartet\n\nAn Evening with The Collingsworth Family & Triumphant Quartet!\n\nCONCERT DETAILS:\n\nSaturday September 14th\n\n6:00 – 9:00 PM\n\nThe Metropolitan Bible Church\n\n2176 Prince of Wales Dr.\n\nOttawa, ON\n\nInformation & Tickets CollingsworthsandTriumphant.eventbrite.ca\n\nThe Collingsworth Family\n\nFounded by Phil and Kim Collingsworth, contemporary gospel group the Collingsworth Family began as a duo in the mid-'80s before evolving into a family affair.\n\nIn 2000, after performing and holding positions at numerous Christian institutions around the country, the couple made the transition to a full-time concert ministry, and began recording professionally with Nashville producer Wayne Haun and making regular appearances at Gaithers Homecoming Concerts. As their ministry grew, so did their family, and by the end of the decade, they were joined by daughters Brooklyn and Courtney (violin, vocals), Olivia (vocals), and son Philip (vocals), releasing a string of successful praise & worship albums including God Is Faithful (2006), We Still Believe (2007), and Answer (2009).\n\nIn 2011, the group signed a long-term deal with Stowtown Records and issued Part of the Family, which hit the Top Ten of the Billboard Christian Albums chart. They returned to the chart with the seasonal album Feels Like Christmas (2012), and The Lord Is Good and Hymns from Home both charted simultaneously in the fall of 2013. That Day Is Coming followed in 2015 for their second Top Ten Christian album. Next up was Brooklyn & Courtney, a violin duo album that featured an appearance by the Nashville Symphony Orchestra. It was released by Stowtown in early 2017. Another symphonic release followed in 2018 with Mercy & Love, which featured performances of both new songs and older material backed by the Prague Philharmonic. The holiday-themed True Family Christmas arrived in 2019.\n\nTriumphant Quartet\n\nFans first experienced the exceptional four-part harmony of genre leader Triumphant Quartet at Louise Mandrell’s beloved theater in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee, in 2003. When they came together to form the group, the four friends realized they had stumbled upon something incredibly special.\n\nThe acclaimed quartet performed with the legendary Mandrell daily until 2008, when they began touring, taking their polished harmonies to churches, performing arts centers and auditoriums all across the nation. The members credit the country music superstar for helping them perfect their stage presence and pursue excellence at every turn.\n\nTwenty years later, Triumphant Quartet remains a quintessential act in the gospel music industry. Consistently voted a fan favorite, the group has garnered multiple chart-topping hits, as well as Dove, Singing News and BMI Awards, including numerous Quartet of the Year honors. Perhaps most remarkably of all, the StowTown Records group has become a household name without experiencing any lineup changes over the past two decades.\n\nNow, as Sean Barber replaces original member Scotty Inman, Triumphant Quartet opens a new chapter of music, faith and friendship as — together with Barber (Lead) — founding members David Sutton (tenor), Eric Bennett (bass) and Clayton Inman (Baritone) enter the next decade of ministry."
