        "text": "Jay, who is serving as a youth intern, wrote in to ask:\n\nI have been searching and searching for songs which have theological depth and substance but it has been quite the challenge in looking through the modern worship scene. I have found Sovereign Grace Music and the songs of Townend and Getty to be a huge help. But what I am asking is, what would you suggest for the next 10 or so songs that we could add to our youth group worship service?\n\nI’ll start by making a few general recommendations, then suggest specific songs. It’s worth picking up any CD by Matt Redman, Tim Hughes, Indelible Grace, and the new Matthew Smith CD. Paul Baloche’s latest, A Greater Song, has some fine songs on it as well. Here are some of the songs we’ve found helpful, not only for our parent/youth meetings, but also for Sunday mornings. By the way, I’m not recommending everything on these CD’s. The CD title is in parentheses.\n\nJesus Paid it All – Passion version (Everything Glorious)\n\nNothing but the Blood – Matt Redman (Facedown)\n\nMaker of All Things – Tim Hughes (Here I Am to Worship)\n\nHow Great is Our God – Chris Tomlin (Passion: How Great is Our God)\n\nBlessed be Your Name – Matt Redman (Blessed Be Your Name)\n\nGreat is the Lord – Starfield (Beauty in the Broken)\n\nGiver of Life – Tim Hughes (When Silence Falls)\n\nMatchless – Aaron Shust (Anything Worth Saying)\n\nMy Savior, My God – Aaron Shust (Anything Worth Saying)\n\nLet the People Praise – Aaron Shust (Anything Worth Saying)\n\nOffering – Paul Baloche (Offering of Worship)\n\nI Will Boast – Paul Baloche (A Greater Song)\n\nLost in Wonder – Martyn Layzell (Lost in Wonder)\n\nYou Opened Up My Eyes – Martyn Layzell (Lost in Wonder)\n\nKen Boer, Music Director at my home church, also keeps a list of the songs we’ve done at Covenant Life. You can access it here."
