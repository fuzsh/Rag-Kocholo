As a result the field is far more subtle, expansive, and interdisciplinary than it was just two decades ago. The North American Religions series builds on this transformative momentum. Books in the series move among the discourses of ethnography, cultural analysis, and historical study to shed new light on a wide range of religious experiences, practices, and institutions. They explore topics such as lived religion, popular religious movements, religion and social power, religion and cultural reproduction, and the relationship between secular and religious institutions and practices. The series focus primarily, but not exclusively, on religion in the United States in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.\n\nBooks in the series: Ava Chamberlain, The Notorious Elizabeth Tuttle: Marriage, Murder, and Madness in the Family of Jonathan Edwards Terry Rey and Alex Stepick, Crossing the Water and Keeping the Faith: Haitian Religion in Miami\n\nAnnie Blazer, Playing for God: Evangelical Women and the Unintended Consequences of Sports Ministry Elizabeth Pérez, Religion in the Kitchen: Cooking, Talking, and the Making of Black Atlantic Traditions\n\nKerry Mitchell, Spirituality and the Jodi Eichler-Levine, Suffer the Little State: Managing Nature and ExperiChildren: Uses of the Past in Jewish and ence in America’s National Parks African American Children’s Literature Finbarr Curtis, The Production of Isaac Weiner, Religion Out Loud: American Religious Freedom Religious Sound, Public Space, and M.

I have led worship services countless times both on the Sabbath and the High Holidays, and, for a few years, I worked at a Jewish private school in Manhattan where I taught music and facilitated daily prayer services. I have the liturgical knowledge and the musical skill required to lead prayer, and I have even tried my hand at writing music for worship, but I never found myself to be very good at any of it. I knew that I could keep the congregation on course and on key, but I felt that I lacked some other facility that would turn our collective singing into something greater and more profound. I could recite the prescribed texts and I could encourage the congregation to sing faster or slower, but I never felt that I succeeded in enabling others (or myself for that matter) to turn those texts into prayers. I struggled to understand how to use songs in the context of congregational worship to enable something that might be called a “religious experience.” I tried to figure out which of the key elements were limiting my experience and understanding of prayer: Was it the music? Was it the liturgy? Was it me? These questions led me to ask who really understood how to create congregational prayer in all its complexities. Who was asking the best questions about how to use music to encourage expression or elicit experiences of the sort that seemed more like whatever it was I imagined prayer to be? Where did worship appear to be working? My quest led me deeper into scholarship on congregations, on music, and on worship and xi\n\nxii | Preface\n\nall of the accounts of what it is supposed to do and how it is supposed to feel. It also led me to church. At churches throughout the United States, I found congregations full of people ready to sing at full volume, and with a kind of commitment that I had rarely experienced. I encountered songs I had never heard that were both beautiful popular cultural artifacts and that seemed to be able to draw people both together and upwards, toward whatever they believed to be there. I saw people weep openly, hold their heads in their hands, raise their arms exuberantly, and speak quietly what I understood to be words of prayer. In all my years of synagogue attendance, I don’t believe I ever saw such regular expressions that seemed to break the ritual framework of worship and allowed people to pray on their own terms. I received a few free compact discs (CDs) of worship music, and I bought a few more, so that I could learn the songs and understand what made them work. I enjoyed singing along with them, both in church and on my own. For me, the central experience was that of music that always seemed on the verge of becoming something else, and I wanted to know how people who made music for worship did it. I wanted to know this, in part, because I never felt I ever managed to make music in worship that was anything other than ritual performance. But I observed people who seemed capable of doing so. How did the people responsible for making music understand and approach their work, and how did it play out in practice? I wanted to know how to make music that made worship, so I set about trying to immerse myself in the world of worship music production. Over four years, I interviewed over 75 people, attended six multiday conferences for worship leaders or Christian songwriters, observed a school for worship leaders, spent countless Sundays in church, and listened and read for thousands of hours trying to understand how they made worship out of music and vice versa. Those experiences, conversations, and encounters comprise the majority of the research for this book. They helped reveal the social and cultural considerations that underlie the creation of music for congregational worship that can enable people to express their faith in prayer. Over the course of my research, I was asked two questions more than any others. In church, I was regularly asked, “Are you a believer?” What people really wanted to know is whether or not I am a Christian. I’m not, so I would answer, “I’m Jewish.” While that response does not nec-\n\nPreface\n\n|\n\nxiii\n\nessarily clarify my status as a believer, it led to a number of fascinating discussions about Hebrew tattoos (please check your spelling and the direction of the text), my family (my father is a rabbi), what it feels like to be a member of the “chosen people” (I tend not to think about it), about Israel (which I typically found more complicated a conversation than they did), and other questions about Jews and about Judaism and its relationship to Christianity. The question about my faith usually came from many of the people whom I’ve had the opportunity to interview about their experiences with worship music as songwriters, pastors, worship leaders, and professionals in the music industry. They were all Christians and they know worship music from the inside out, writing, producing and performing songs, organizing marketing efforts, writing about songs and songwriting, leading worship, and living as worshippers and as members of church communities. Some thought it strange that a Jewish scholar would be interested in worship music, while others took the opportunity to talk scripture and still others used the occasion for a little gentle proselytizing. The people who generously gave of their time and shared their insights, experiences, stories, and music inspired me to write this book, and this book is partially for them, though I often wonder whether there is anything that I have to add to a conversation about their faith, their daily work, or the music they make. In addition to the question about my beliefs, the other question I often received came from my academic colleagues, who were not concerned with my faith, as they assumed that I did not have much, if any, to speak of. They usually asked after my soul, as well, though they were more concerned about the withering effects they believed that worship music might have on it. Working primarily in secular, research universities, some of my colleagues are scholars of music and others are scholars of religious studies but most of them are not themselves practitioners of religion, and their inquiries betrayed some shared assumptions about American evangelicals and the quality of their music.1 Frequently, they expressed their condolences for the fact that I must have had to endure hours of listening to what they assumed to be the terrible, cloying sounds of contemporary evangelical worship. Or worse, they assumed that going to church was a chore, as it meant having to listen to bad music and heavy-handed sermonizing, both of which they assumed to be second-rate, baldly utilitarian, and both politically and theologically overdetermined. To them,\n\nxiv | Preface\n\nI could offer a far more direct and affirmative answer than I could to my Christian interlocutors: I genuinely liked a lot of the music I heard. I did not find it to be derivative or a poor version of pop music. Much of it was catchy and enjoyable to sing and listen to. I loved singing it in church and I put more than a few songs on a playlist that was the soundtrack to countless morning runs in cities around the world. I came to appreciate the craft and the creativity of worship music, and some of what I heard in it kept me curious enough to continue thinking about what made this music so engaging and so successful at facilitating worship. To be sure, I did not love all of the music that I encountered during the course of this study, but that would be generally true of almost every record and CD that I own, or every radio station I listen to. Similarly, I thoroughly enjoyed singing along in church to songs that did not resonate with me theologically, but this was not so different from my experience of praying in many Jewish contexts. More than mere fascination, I developed a true affinity for the music I was singing and studying, detecting in it the contrapuntal strains of popular music and popular religion, and coming to appreciate the harmonies and dissonances such an encounter made audible. Yet, as much as I enjoyed singing in church and listening to worship music elsewhere, what follows does not dwell on the experience of worship or worshippers. There are loads of books that plumb the phenomenological depths of worship and religious experience, or that try to explain why communal singing is so pleasurable to so many. This book builds on those but takes a different approach to this phenomenon by attending a little more intently to the people, practices, and considerations that shape the music that people eventually sing as worship. Specifically, it focuses on the production and creation of songs for worship that, if they are to succeed, must allow people to use the ritual of congregational worship to transcend the ritual itself. Songwriters, worship leaders, and music industry professionals are keenly aware that they make music for ritualized worship, and they express no small measure of concern about this. They worry that their songs might become the focus, rather than an instrument of worship. They worry that their songs might be so pleasurable to sing that worshippers might mistake the good feelings of communal song for the experience of worship itself. In short, they worry that the forms of musical worship they create might eclipse the ability of people to enter deeply and earnestly into worship itself. With\n\nPreface\n\n|\n\nxv\n\nthis awareness, they invest in making music that, they hope, will allow people to transcend the songs they’ve written. The result are great songs that both enable people to worship however they may and are tethered to deep concerns about the urgency and limitations of human expression. *** There were many people involved in the production of this book, and it is a result of their uncoordinated efforts, though I take full responsibility for its contents, errors, and tone deafness. It began when I was on the faculty of UC Davis, and my colleagues there were beyond supportive. Specifically, I want to thank Caren Kaplan, who invited me to give a talk before I had anything to say; Douglas Kahn, whose insights into sound and sound art helped me through earlier versions of the ideas here; and Carolyn Thomas, who encouraged me to reach out beyond my office and across the campus. Carolyn helped to support the project with some early funding that made some of the fieldwork possible, and she helped kick-start the research that is largely at the heart of the book. Stanford University has been an encouraging environment in which I could see this book to fruition. My colleagues in and beyond the Graduate School of Education and the Department of Religious Studies have introduced me to new literatures and new ways of approaching phenomena like music and religion, and have made this book far richer than I imagined it could have been. Special thanks to Keith D. Eiten of Wheaton College’s Busman Memorial Library for some eleventh hour help with one of the book’s images. Throughout the research and writing, I have been touched and encouraged by the extraordinary trust and openness shown me by many of the people who appear in this book. Over meals and meetings in offices and coffee shops, countless people shared their time and insight, and, in the process, taught me everything I know about worship and music and how they go together. I can only pray that this book is intelligible to them, and that it represents the world that they know, and that it, in some small way, may offer new insights into the work they do. In particular, I want to highlight the generosity of Ross Parsley, Glenn Packiam, Chuck Fromm, Brent Bourgeois, and Bob Kauflin, each of whom not only shared their own stories and insights with me but also connected me to others whose voices were so crucial to this book’s eventual insights.\n\nxvi\n\n| Preface\n\nTo my friends and family, who heard so much about this project along the way, I am grateful for your patience and humor, and to the students in my classes at both UC Davis and Stanford, I appreciate your willingness to learn along with me as I worked out some of these ideas with you. To my colleagues and friends who asked about how the book was going over these many years, I can only say that each conversation helped nudge it toward completion, however gently. This book has been a long time coming, and I’m especially indebted to a few readers who, thanks to the anonymous scholarly review process, I will never be able to thank directly, but who, along the way, gave me gifts that the manuscript did not quite warrant and helped to orient me toward what became the book that you have here. It could not have been written without their collegial and generous help and insights, and for that I am grateful and humbled to work in research and scholarship. Specifically, I want to call out Marc Gidal and Kristen Dombek, who have been collaborators on the ideas in this book in so many ways over the decades we’ve known each other. On the nuts and bolts side of things, I have been fortunate to have had outstanding assistance from Megan McKoy, Joanna Carr, and Elayne Weissler-Martello, each of whom arrived at precisely the right moment to provide exactly the help I needed to get this book to its next stage. Thank you to the wonderful team at NYU, particularly Laura Levitt and David Watt, who encouraged me early on and waited patiently as I dallied and wrote before finally bringing to you the best book that I could for your fine series. Along with Tracy Fessenden, you two have cultivated an exceptionally rich editorial vision and I am beyond happy that you wish to claim this little book as one of your own. Jennifer Hammer has been a great coach and shepherd as well, helping me to navigate all of the parts of bringing a book to published form. Writing a book is always an adventure, and Jennifer is as sure-footed and steady a guide as I could ask for. Thank you for your encouragement, your firm hand, your keen eye, your guidance, and your patience. Thank you to Amy Klopfenstein, for taking care of most of the details and for transforming all of the elements of bringing all the words on the pages that follow into the form of a book. I began this book before I met my wife and before either of our children joined us. Eva, Bella, and Malachi: you are why I do what I do. You make me put my prayers into practice, and my practice into prayers. And, more importantly, you make those prayers possible and worthwhile.\n\nIntroduction Why Make Music? Yet a time is coming and has now come when the true worshipers will worship the Father in the Spirit and in truth, for they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks. God is spirit, and his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in truth. —John 4:23–241 Worship is about the heart and it’s about your life, it’s not about any type of song. The style of worship songs will change, but the heart of it never will. —Chris Tomlin2\n\nOn the last night of a Christian songwriters’ retreat in 2008, songwriter Paul Baloche led worship. It was late and I was exhausted, having spent the previous three days doing as many interviews as I could, listening to lectures, going to songwriting workshops, and even trying my hand at a little songwriting (it wasn’t pretty). I had taken too many field notes for my own good and I was looking forward to returning home so I could get some rest and a little distance from all that I’d gathered. Sitting in a covered wooden chapel in the Santa Cruz Mountains, with windows open to the redwoods and a simple stage at the front, it was quiet for a few moments as people chatted with one another before Baloche and his band took the stage. Baloche started in and people sang, and I sang along, too, as best I could. People stood, so I stood. The singing seemed to rise in intensity, and somewhere near the end of the final song Baloche and his band did something. I’m still not sure what it was. Maybe they extended a break or they played a coda of some kind, but the music seemed to open up as the band sat on a single, swirling chord, holding it for some time. People started humming and vocalizing. Someone began 1\n\n2\n\n| Introduction\n\nspeaking extemporaneously, blessing Baloche and all of us. Someone else quietly spoke in tongues. Other people wept or held their head in their hands or closed their eyes, lips moving and hands extended outward as if they were holding something in their arms. I hummed along, too, enjoying the feeling. The song had almost ceased to be a song, but Baloche and his bandmates held us all together, hovering around a single chord while the rest of us sang or chanted or spoke or simply took in the scene and the sound. I do not know how long it lasted, but I know I was not ready for it to end. I was enjoying this moment and I was moved by whatever it was that was happening. When Baloche and his band brought the song and the evening to a close, we all looked around and nodded. It felt like we’d shared something quite unusual. Two different people asked me if I could feel the Holy Spirit in the room. They could, they told me. I mumbled some kind of response, at that moment not entirely certain what I had experienced. I knew that the music and the singing felt good and right, and it made the air feel thick with promise and challenge, and it seemed as if Baloche had done something extraordinary. It felt both powerful and personal, as if the music brought us together and allowed each one of us to pray in his or her own way. I wanted to ask him again how he did what he did, even though I knew what he would say. How do you take a room of tired people and, over the course of five or six songs, create space for them to pray their own prayers? Part of it was due to Baloche and his band, each of whom is an exceptional musician and a person who holds his or her faith deeply. Part of it could have been that we were in an open-air structure in the redwoods, making music together. Part of it could have been that we were not under the typical time constraints of a Sunday worship service, so Baloche and his band could hold us as long as it felt good and right to do so without arousing the anxiety of a pastor waiting to take the stage or a family trying to get to a soccer game after church. Part of it could have been attributed to the people in the ad-hoc congregation who were songwriters of Christian music, and were both experienced with and predisposed toward this kind of thing. It may have been some combination of all of these things, but it still took Baloche and his band, his songs, and his singing to create the conditions for that encounter. We needed music that would enable us to pray, even\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n3\n\nas Baloche also understood how and when to silence his songs and let us pray on our own. This book is an effort to understand moments like that one by exploring how songwriters, worship leaders, and music industry professionals collaborate to make music that can become prayer. Embedded in this investigation is an understanding that Baloche’s worship session made clear: inasmuch as it is possible to focus on the music itself, the ultimate aim of those responsible for making music is never the music itself. The music, they explain, is only a medium for a more profound and more important message, one that is necessarily more urgent and greater than any song can contain. Understanding that worship is not, fundamentally, about music allows music makers to be agnostic about style and serious about their faith as they adapt popular musical forms for sacred purposes. Focusing on the production of worship music highlights the extent to which social and cultural concerns underwrite forms of congregational worship, and how investments in cultural forms also make it possible to transcend them. Making music that works in this way requires both a great deal of creative effort and an ongoing reckoning with the theology of worship, the power of popular music, the craft of songwriting, the persuasive dimensions of performance, and an understanding of the role of a commodified form in serving the expressive needs of worshippers. Instead of undermining worship music, highlighting its social and cultural elements emphasizes the fact that even the most transcendent examples of human expression require coordinated and sometimes contradictory human efforts.\n\nMusic in Worship This book is concerned with understanding how people make the songs that become congregational and individual prayer. How do they turn their own worship into songs, and how do they imagine that others might turn their songs into worship? What considerations shape their output, and how do they manage their commitments to art, to their congregations, and to God? How do they understand their efforts as creators of music in the context of an American religious movement that holds that it is possible for anyone to encounter God directly and without mediation? This theological stance would seem to suggest that\n\n4\n\n| Introduction\n\ntheir music is, at best, unnecessary and at worst a distraction, and it puts worship music makers in a double bind: they write songs that they hope will allow worshippers to sing them for worship, but not as worship. They hope their songs will help others to pray, but they understand that the songs themselves always contain the possibility that they might eclipse the worship they have been created to facilitate. The better their songs are, the more likely they will fall short of worship because they might become too pleasurable to sing and stop people from worshipping directly to God. They write songs that serve as ritualized forms to mediate a relationship that they believe should be unmediated and unritualized. Songwriters, worship leaders, and music industry professionals are all aware of this tension, but nevertheless they invest themselves in music for worship. Scholar of religion Birgit Meyer calls worship songs and other cultural artifacts “sensational forms,” which she understands as a religious convention that allows both for the expression of “content and meaning and ethical norms and values” as well as “a modality or device that allows for repeated . . . action.”3 Sensational forms are thus explicitly ritual in nature. With respect to music, historian of religion Stephen Marini defined “sacred song” as music with “mythic content” that is used for “effective ritual action.”4 Congregations, in particular, thrive on these forms because prayer is not easy. It requires committing one’s self to expressions that may or may not be reciprocated by the divine being to which one is praying. It thrives on repetition and practice, but it can stagnate when it becomes too repetitive. People who make worship music create sensational forms that they hope will provide enough ritual structure and enough expressive opportunity to enable worship to resist becoming merely rote. Worship songs or liturgies, hymnals or projection screens, cantors and worship leaders help; each serves those trying to worship by providing readily available and accessible ritual forms for people to engage with without having to reinvent modes or expressions of prayer each time one feels moved to do so. They can be thought of as devices or shortcuts that serve like ready-made expressions that, on good days, can transport those who engage with them into a space of prayer. Sensational or ritual forms give familiar features to grand questions, and, as a result, they make the ritual of prayer easier. They may also sow the seeds for new orthodoxies, as people grow attached to songs and styles, associating them with prayer itself.\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n5\n\nAt worst, these ritual elements privilege form over content. At best, sensational forms mediate content that, in its most successful moments, breaks through the form and allows for something greater, something deeper, something transcendent to take place. The sensational form of musical worship is so pervasive that no other activity figures as prominently as worship in the lives of American congregations. Sociologist Mark Chaves’s national survey of American congregations revealed that “worship services take up more congregational resources and involve more people than anything else congregations do.” Moreover, worship services are the main point of contact between the congregation and the outside world, and as such they constitute a congregation’s most public face, the self-portrait religious congregations offer to the outside world. There is also a sense in which worship events are more truly collective than anything else congregations do. . . . However staid the service, it is more collectively effervescent than any other congregational event.5\n\nWith a nod to Émile Durkheim, Chaves argued that worship creates congregations. It brings people together more often than other activities, and it shapes congregational identity (from both inside and out) more than any other function. With all due respect to education and social action, worship is what congregations do. Usually, worship involves music. In his analysis of the “repertoire[s] of available worship elements” in American congregations, Chaves observed that 98 percent of people who attend worship services engage in congregational singing and 96 percent of all congregations feature singing in their worship.6 Songwriter and longtime worship leader and teacher Bob Kauflin explained to me that the reason there is so much singing in evangelical congregations, specifically, is that the biblical command to sing praise is hard to miss: “There are about 400 references to singing, 50 direct commands to sing God’s praise. [Psalm] 47:6 [says], ‘Sing praises to the King, sing praises to God, sing praises to our King, sing praises.’ So, that’s pretty clear. God wants us to give Him praise not just with our lips but with our songs.”7 But the Bible is not as clear with respect to how songs should sound.8 For example, Ephesians 5:18–19 reads, “Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery. Instead, be filled with the Spirit,\n\n6\n\n| Introduction\n\nspeaking to one another with psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit. Sing and make music from your heart to the Lord.” Colossians 3:16 offers a similar prescription: “Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another with all wisdom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts.” What the Bible means by the repeated use of “psalms, hymns, and songs from the spirit” is the subject of much debate. Differences of interpretation and intention have generated volumes of writing and more than one schism among practitioners, theologians, songwriters, worship leaders, pastors, denominations, and congregations. These arguments are not new. They stretch back at least as far as Martin Luther’s 95 Theses and they wind a circuitous path through the refractions of institutional denominationalism, the exuberance of the First and Second Awakenings in the United States, and the search for spirituality that emerged from the counterculture of the late 1960s.9 They informed Luther’s composition of hymns and influenced those of Isaac Watts and Charles Wesley, ultimately shaping the work of songwriters and worship leaders who began writing worship music that sounded like rock and roll. Beginning in the 1960s, critics like Bob Larson wrote vociferous arguments condemning the inclusion of rock and roll in worship, and decades later writers like Robb Redman offered spirited arguments in its favor.10 Music is often the register for larger debates about what counts and what does not count as worship, and discussions about the proper place of music in worship continue to shape how music for worship is made and, consequently, the sound and substance of congregational worship itself. For many observers and scholars, the centrality of music in worship has made them sound nearly synonymous. Popular news stories about evangelical churches reinforce this impression by regularly detailing stories about worship that emphasize music.11 The ubiquity of music has led some scholars to conclude that “the term worship means singing.”12 Others observed that “at a church like the Vineyard, music is prayer.”13 But many of those invested in the production of worship are quick to refute this impression with claims that when music attracts too much attention it can become a distraction for worship and worshippers. Songwriter and worship leader David Crowder explained to me that “if worship consists of music, then I feel like we’re kind of in a bad space since the vehicle or container is so limited in terms of what it provides us.”14 Charlie Pea-\n\nIntroduction\n\n| 7\n\ncock, one of Christian music’s greatest champions and fiercest critics, put it more pointedly: “Where the discussion of worship begins and ends with music, there will always be foolishness, error, and strife.”15 Songwriter Sara Groves suggested something similar when she explained that “worship cannot just be this one small passageway of music.”16 Lutheran theologian Marva Dawn also wrote that “music is the outgrowth/consequence (not the antecedent) of worship, the response to God’s presence.” Songs can distract or engage, but, she admonishes, “it is idolatry to think that our work makes the difference.”17 Songs, they all agree, are vehicles—disposable, transposable, dispensable, and ephemeral. Songwriters and critics understand that worship music is supposed to facilitate worship, not become worship, warning against the conclusion that worship is defined by its musical forms. The question, then, for those who make worship music, is how to write, perform, or produce songs that serve the needs of worshippers without falling prey to the false equivalence of music and worship. The answer lies in the efforts of critics, songwriters, worship leaders, and music industry professionals who both invest in and resist music as the focus of their efforts. Music, they assert, is a medium of both collective song and individual expression, and their songs work best as worship when they become the worship of others. This remains true in congregational settings, where a shared repertoire of ritual elements allows a congregation of worshippers to sing together while still enabling individuals to express their own prayers.18 The sensational form of the song and the cultural practice of singing it in a congregation both create the impression that music is worship and, simultaneously, allow expressions of worship to exceed the music provided for it.\n\nThe Cultural Production of Worship Music The process by which public practice and mass-produced cultural forms become vehicles for private expression of something transcendent is what religious studies scholar Robert Orsi means when he refers to prayer as a “switching point between the social world and the imagination.”19 For Orsi, prayer is often “misidentified as private and so therefore assumed not to have a history or a politics. But people at prayer are intimately engaged and implicated in their social worlds.”20 Prayer, he argues, is always social, no matter how much emphasis people place on its ability\n\n8\n\n| Introduction\n\nto channel an individual directly to the divine. Accounting for the social dimensions of worship, however, does not make private expressions illusions. Rather, Orsi’s insight emphasizes the ways in which private expressions are tethered to social and cultural forms even then they offer the possibility of communion with God. The sense of the Holy Spirit that some described to me on that night in the Santa Cruz Mountains was not a fiction, but it was not purely a result of social forces, either. It was, in a sense, the product of people in their social worlds deploying the practice and form of prayer to transcend them. To make worship music in this context is to produce songs that make “switching points” possible. In that service, it bears a significant responsibility for defining, modeling, and teaching people what worship is, how to do it, and what it ought to sound and feel like. Following Orsi, even the most seemingly subjective examples of worship emerge from social conditions and take social forms. The romantic notion of the singer-songwriter pouring her heart out at the piano or the worship leader standing rapt in front of a congregation masks the much larger network of actions, actors, institutions, practices, and conventions that help to bring songs into congregations and turn them from individual expressions of faith into occasions for corporate worship. Songs need songwriters, of course, and the formulation of something called “worship music” also depends on congregations and music publishers, on pastors and worship leaders, on copyright law, LPs and CDs, and on a host of websites and other resources created to help promote and produce the best possible songs for congregations and worshippers to make their own. As music scholar Tia DeNora has argued about Beethoven, even his apparently singular stature can be understood as the product of a host of institutional actors who collaborated on the construction of the very category of the “modern genius.”21 The music may have come from Beethoven but it needed a constellation of social, cultural, ideological, and material investments that allowed it to circulate in the ways that it did and to assume the stature and meaning that it now holds. The production of worship music is not terribly dissimilar, insofar as its social conditions shape the ways worshippers understand, imagine, and engage in prayer. Sociologists Richard Peterson and Howard Becker have each offered useful frameworks for understanding the social and institutional dimensions of the production of culture, of which worship music is one\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n9\n\ninstance.22 Informed by their lifelong interest in music, both scholars understand culture not as a “reflection” of social life, but as the result of collaborations among social actors, institutions, markets, and cultural forms. Both argue that to attend to art or music largely as receptacles of cultural value, in the mode of early cultural studies or in the fashion of the “myth and symbol” school of American Studies, is to focus too narrowly on meanings that inhere in the products themselves.23 Songs or paintings or novels or movies might reveal certain cultural truths about historical moments, but approaching them only or primarily as expressions of culture mutes the effort that created the conditions for their appearance. Interpreting culture as representation, Peterson and Becker argue, abstracts it from the material conditions of its production and reifies cultural expression in ways that distort its relationship to the social and cultural contexts that make it meaningful. These contexts include those in which cultural artifacts are made. Peterson first turned the tools of sociology on the people and structures responsible for the “production of culture.”24 By shifting the locus of cultural investigation away from cultural products and onto their production and producers, he tried to provide a more thorough account of the evolution of cultural forms and their meanings. For example, his study of authenticity in country music highlighted the evolution of cultural conventions that led to their acceptance as characteristics of the genre.25 He traced the ways in which elements of the style were not merely reflections of everyday life, but were themselves artifacts of the larger mechanisms of popular musical production. Becker extended Peterson’s insights about the production of culture in his examination of “art worlds.” Building on the insights of art critic Arthur Danto, Becker located the creation of art within a complex of individuals and institutions, and not only as the result of creative individuals acting on their own. The phenomenon known as “art,” then, could be better understood as the result of a loosely coordinated but collaborative effort of artists and critics, galleries and museums, financiers, art schools, and others. To indicate that he was not talking about art-as-artifact, Becker called the results “art worlds,” which, he explained, consist of all the people whose activities are necessary to the production of the characteristic works which that world, and perhaps others as well,\n\n10\n\n| Introduction\n\ndefine as art. . . . The world exists in the cooperative activity of those people, not as a structure or organization, and we use worlds like those only as shorthand for the notion of networks of people cooperating.26\n\nDifferently from Peterson, who focused on the specific work of cultural producers operating within discrete media industries, Becker’s “worlds” approach revealed the varied human efforts that collaborate in less formal ways to produce cultural phenomena. In the realm of music, specifically, musicologist Christopher Small offered the concept of musicking as a way of understanding the variety of practices involved in the production of musical culture, from musicians and their audiences to ticket-takers at a concert.27 Musicking, for Small, refers to the array of practices that are engaged in the production of musical culture. His insistence on using the gerund “musicking” serves as a reminder that music is never only what it sounds like, and that it always reverberates with the human efforts that give it sound and form. Thus, for both Becker and Small, neither art nor music can be reduced to the singular product of a creative act, but each must be considered within broader networks of human activity that make the act and the product possible. Musical cultures and art worlds cannot be separated from the sound of music or the appearance of art; they are what happens when people engage in art or music making, or in meaning making in conversation with those cultural forms. In some respects, making worship music is no different from these other cultural forms, as it engages all six facets of Peterson’s theory of the field of symbolic production: technology, law and regulation, industry structure, organization structure, occupational career, and market.28 As worship music evolved since the late 1960s and adopted the sounds of rock and roll, it adhered to conventions of popular musical production: record albums, artists committed to making worship and leading worship, attention to album sales, magazines, journalists, critics, and organizations committed to managing music copyright for houses of worship. These were not incidental by-products of a nascent music industry; they can be understood as integral parts of the mechanisms of cultural production. Even worship songs can be understood as a specific cultural form designed to serve congregations in worship, and not as “natural” results of prayerful intent or expression. Again, using the cultural production ap-\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n11\n\nproach does not mean that worship is artificial or hollow, but rather that the worship song is a cultural form whose social context does not necessarily preclude it from enabling transcendent expressions of worship. In this light, congregational worship can be understood as a cultural product, but worship music is not a perfect analogue to Becker’s take on art or Small’s understanding of “musicking” because worship, almost by definition, cannot be contained by a “world.” Even though it assumes culturally specific forms and practices, it is supposed to allow those engaged with it to transcend them and to enable practitioners to express and perhaps encounter something universal or divine. This is what separates worship, however one might choose to define it, from other modes of expression or communication. If worship is a cultural “world,” it is one that cannot totally encompass the intent or experience of worship itself; the act of musicking in the context of worship must make more than just sound, or else it is merely music. This understanding of the relationship between music and its intended purpose situates critics, songwriters, worship leaders, music industry professionals, and worshippers in a somewhat unstable relationship with the music they collectively make. The production of culture approach helps highlight these coordinated and contradictory efforts by calling attention to the ways in which they came to be, and not just to how they sound. Attending to the intentions, concerns, and aspirations of songwriters, worship leaders, and music industry professionals, as well as to debates about worship music, amplifies the variety of investments that enable sacred practice. Considering cultural production highlights the ways in which key cultural producers imagine their work in relation both to God and to the human needs of those who might sing their songs for worship. It enables us to hear the contradictory conditions inherent in creating music for worship that should, ideally, not be necessary for worship. Attending to the production of worship music does not compromise its power, though it may help to explain how it makes worship possible.\n\nThe Scope of the Work and a Note on Terminology How to refer to music for worship is almost as contested as the music itself and almost as influential to its cultural formation. The history of music in worship is so long that the form has taken on any number of\n\n12\n\n| Introduction\n\ntitles, each iteration referring to its function and alluding to broader social relationships in which it circulates. The emergence of a specific generic assignation is a more recent development that coincided with the rise of genre as the organizing logic of the musical marketplace in the early 20th century.29 For centuries of worship music publishing, genre mattered less than publishing format or denominational affiliation, as songs for worship were typically published in hymnals or songbooks that were sold to churches. As a result, published collections used a number of terms to refer to the music they held. The subtitle of the 1651 Bay Psalm Book, the first hymnal published in the American colonies, referred to “Psalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs.” Half a century later, British minister and hymn-writer Isaac Watts called his 1701 hymnal “Psalms and Spiritual Songs.” John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, entitled his 1761 collection “Select Hymns,” and, in 1801, the first hymnal published by an African American congregation referred to “Spiritual Songs and Hymns” in its title.30 Beginning in the late 19th century, “gospel music” emerged as a term that referred to more contemporary-sounding songs written for worship. Led by composers like Thomas A. Dorsey and others, the rise of gospel music eschewed the traditionalism of hymn-based worship and traded on new sounds and new styles.31 The term applied to music by and for both black and white Christian communities and, as historian of religion James Goff and others have noted, the black and white gospel music traditions drew on one another, even as sociological and emerging music market conditions segregated them.32 The music industry played a powerful role in shaping American popular music by creating genres that aligned with markets, often defining them according to racial categories. This included a small but significant market for sermons by African American preachers who understood the power of emerging recording technologies as a tool for evangelism.33 Market dynamics, put in place by policies of racial and commercial distinction, helped to create two parallel industries for religious recordings: one white and one black.34 The music of the African American church has long retained the label “gospel music,” though that, too, is beginning to change. Deborah Smith Pollard, a scholar of African American religious music, found that “praise and worship music” had entered the black church, observing that “praise and worship music is used during the opening period of a church\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n13\n\nworship service, gospel musical or concert.” She noted that “praise and worship music” was even threatening to “replace the older gospel song repertoire.”35 The evolution of gospel music and the worship practices of African American congregations is a fascinating and rich story, and it is one that has had a greater impact on the evolution of American popular music than either white gospel music or the much younger forms of Christian rock. Yet the distinction between largely Anglo and largely African American churches is more than just musical. The fissure between white and African American evangelical churches (to say nothing of the growing number of Spanish-language evangelical congregations in the United States) is a well-documented sociological fact. Michael O. Emerson and Christian Smith have examined the ways in which race informs the understandings, experiences, and institutional structures of American evangelicalism, ultimately concluding that the two, appeals to the universal “body of Christ” notwithstanding, are quite different indeed.36 Multicultural churches, as documented by Gerardo Marti, represent a small fraction of houses of worship that attend assiduously to their multicultural makeup.37 But the majority of American houses of worship remain quite segregated. I respect the distinction among forms and sites of American evangelicalism, and my research could not address every aspect of the cultural production of worship music in American evangelical congregations across race and region. So I focus, here, on the production of music for largely white American evangelical congregations, with the understanding that scholars like Deborah Smith Pollard and others are working on projects parallel to this one.38 This book focuses on the music that emerged in predominantly white churches and became the soundtrack for the resurgence in American evangelical life during the latter decades of the 20th century. Owing in large part to the significant place of popular music in the counterculture of the 1960s, a new strain of music influenced by the blues and folk rock eclipsed both “Southern Gospel” and traditional hymns. It first came to be known as Jesus Music and then as Christian rock or contemporary Christian music (CCM). Music written for worship came to be known, successively, as “praise and worship,” “praise choruses,” “praise music,” “contemporary worship music,” “modern worship music,” and, most recently, “contemporary congregational songs,” though this, too, is likely to change in the future.39 Changes in nomenclature have represented\n\n14\n\n| Introduction\n\nchanges in how people make sense of music and its relationship to worship.40 Insofar as each and every label for music represents a compromise between the descriptive, the analytical, the practical, and the strategic, I want to state from the outset that, when I use the term “worship music,” I am using it to refer to a product of musical and cultural practices that have come to characterize congregational worship in primarily white evangelical churches since the late 1960s, when rock and roll became the predominant stylistic referent in predominantly white evangelical congregations. This book examines the production of worship music across four realms: discourse, songwriting, worship leading, and the music industry. Each will be the focus of a single chapter, providing ample space to examine the production of worship music in that realm, even as each is intertwined with the others. Woven through this book’s four chapters are persistent concerns that inform the production of worship music: concerns about the faith and character of worshipers, questions about the prominence that music should have in worship, the definition of worship, the relationship between congregational worship and worship as a lifestyle, and tensions between commercial interests and sacred service. Connecting these is an overarching appreciation of the centrality of music in worship and the understanding that, to serve as worship, the music must not call too much attention to itself. Focusing on the cultural production of worship music grounds the phenomenon in discursive, material, social, sonic, and spiritual concerns that are channeled through talking about worship, the craft of songwriting, the perils of live performance, and the mechanisms of a media industry. Emphasizing these realms of cultural production allows for an account of worship songs as paradigmatic “sensational forms” that calls attention both to their form and to the efforts required to create them.41 Understood as a cultural production, worship music also becomes more than just an accumulation of “sacred songs” that serve the needs of a congregation for music with which to worship. By focusing on the production of worship music, Shout to the Lord denaturalizes both the sensational and practical qualities of the music, and reveals the human concerns that make worship possible.\n\n1\n\nMaking Worship and Music Expression, Experience, and Education My mouth is filled with your praise, declaring your splendor all day long. —Psalm 71:8 Good worship shouldn’t be a question of style. . . . When someone is up there doing the best they can and you still don’t like what you’re hearing because it’s not your style, then you’ve got a golden opportunity to enter into a worshipful attitude. . . . That’s when you know you’re really worshipping and not just getting carried away with the music. You’re making [a] conscious choice to overlook the style and focus on the content. —Twila Paris1\n\nOne Sunday, I was in church outside of Nashville. I arrived a little later than I normally do on ethnographic outings because I planned to attend the second worship service at this particular church after going to the early service at another and I had misjudged the time it would take to get there. I had not originally planned to go to this church. I had not even heard of this congregation until earlier in the week, when two or three professionals in the worship music industry told me that this is where they go on Sundays. I figured that if they recommended it, it was probably worth seeing for myself. When I asked why they went there, and not to any other church, they all reminded me that this is Nashville. World-class musicians were everywhere, including in church, and they had little tolerance for musicians who seemed like they were trying too hard. This particular congregation, they told me, did not feature flashing lights and hyperanimated worship leaders. It did not even usually sing the most popular worship songs. 15\n\n16\n\n| Making Worship and Music\n\nI slid into my row, right next to one of the people I’d spoken with earlier that week. We nodded a “good morning,” and she kept singing. Glancing across the room, I noticed two other people I’d interviewed. The crowd was modest—maybe 500 people—and the music was more muted than I’d been expecting. The mix was clean but minimal, and the voices in the congregation nearly rose above those of the worship leaders at the front of the room. The worship leaders did not sit on an elevated stage, so I had to peer around those sitting in front of me to get a good view and look for cues that might help me to follow along. Unlike almost everywhere else I had been, they did not have a projection screen with lyrics. Instead, I tried following along on a handout that contained the lyrics of the morning’s songs. Despite having become pretty familiar with the music of worship, I was at a bit of a loss because I did not know any of the songs we were singing. They were not hard to learn, but not knowing any of them was a little disorienting, even to me. We sat down and the pastor delivered a sermon before we sang one more song that brought the morning’s worship to a close. Sitting in my car a few minutes later, jotting down field notes, I found myself wondering: How did we get here? Here I was in Nashville, the center of the Christian music industry, and the very people whose insights shaped my understanding of worship music were here, too, trying to avoid the crowds, the projection screens, and the dramatic swoop and swell that characterized so much of the music they helped to make. Their choice of congregation seemed to speak less to the music itself, and more to the culture of musical creation in which they figure so centrally. They spend their weeks making worship music, and on Sundays they still make worship music, but they do it differently, as members of congregations who sing along with everyone else. Although they are both worshippers and producers of the phenomenon known as “worship music,” their explanations of where they worship on Sundays and why they worship where they do suggests some tension between their different roles in the culture of music making. What these music executives wanted from their own worship did not perfectly align with the music they made for the congregational music marketplace. Importantly, they neither disavowed nor discounted the music they make as professionals; they believe their work to be sincere and even possibly sacred. They believe in the music they make and they appreciate its resonance with\n\nMaking Worship and Music\n\n|\n\n17\n\nthe millions of worshippers who sing it in church. Yet, when it comes to musical expressions that capture or enable their own expressions of worship, their desires move them in a different direction. “I listen to worship music all week long,” one told me. “I don’t want to think about work while I’m trying to pray.” The desire to distance one’s self from work and focus on prayer is both a spiritual and a material concern. It is a claim about what one wants from worship and what one expects from it. It is also an acknowledgement of how difficult it is to focus on worshipping with music when one makes music for a living. The choice of where to worship and the conditions that inform it emerge from an ongoing engagement with three themes that are central to the discursive production of worship music: worship music is supposed to allow people to express themselves in worship, to create occasions for profound experiences, and to educate worshippers about their practice and their faith. This chapter explores each of these three themes and establishes them as discursive frameworks for the production of worship music. These themes are less descriptive of worship music than they are constitutive of it, and understanding them will establish a set of cultural, conceptual, and theological issues at play in the production of worship music without even playing a note.\n\nDefining Worship Music Following Peterson and Becker, it takes more than musicians to make music. As music scholar Simon Frith has written, “Part of the pleasure of popular culture is talking about it; part of its meaning is this talk, talk which is run through with value judgements.”2 This is as true for fans and critics as it is for musicians and clergy, and it is as true for popular forms as it is for sacred ones. Talking about music is part of making music. Because of the high stakes of worship, the tone and tenor of these discussions takes on a greater significance as people disagree about style but are often arguing about worship itself. How people talk about worship music is an important mode of cultural production in its own right, as discussions of the music help frame the ways in which it ought to be heard, circulated, presented, and understood. As Eric Porter has argued with respect to jazz, musicians should be understood for their intellectual as well as their creative contributions.3\n\n18\n\n| Making Worship and Music\n\nApproaching their nonmusical contributions as evidence of an “intellectual history” of jazz, Porter situates his work in relation to that of Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci, who distinguished between intellectuals and intellectual work, writing, “All men are intellectual but not all men have in society the function of intellectuals.”4 The function of an intellectual is “directive and organisational, i.e. educative, i.e. intellectual”5 Their efforts provide their social groups a sense of “homogeneity and an awareness of its own function not only in the economic but also in the social and political fields.”6 Gramsci identifies two classes of intellectuals: the traditional and the organic, and he strongly favors the latter for its ability to contribute to the self-awareness of their community and, ultimately, to the transformation of social conditions. For Porter, talking or writing about jazz amounts to far more than a self-reflexive habit of jazz musicians explaining their own music for themselves and their fans. Instead, he argues, jazz musicians who write about music should be understood as part of a multidimensional effort to both make music and to make sense of that music by drawing on questions of culture, history, race, nation, migration, religion, and class. As a result, jazz can be understood as the product of both creative and intellectual efforts, and the cultural labor of jazz musicians should be understood similarly and specifically in terms of their contributions to an antihegemonic cultural narrative. The intellectual work of the producers of worship music is not dissimilar, as they both make music and talk about making music. In the process of explaining worship and its relationship to music, they attempt to situate the community of evangelicals for whom they write in relation to what they see as the corrosive elements of secular American culture. In this way, they see themselves as antihegemonic and understand their efforts to draw people’s attention toward God as part of a critique of the materialism of American culture. Treating makers of worship music as intellectuals also runs counter to historian Mark Noll’s famously scathing critique of American evangelicalism that took the community to task for abandoning intellectual commitments, saying, “The scandal of the evangelical mind is that there is not much of an evangelical mind.”7 Historian Molly Worthen’s history of American evangelicalism in the 20th century offered a counternarrative to Noll’s famously bleak portrait as she explored “how evangelicals have navigated the upheavals in modern American culture and global Christianity.” For Worthen, those\n\nMaking Worship and Music\n\n|\n\n19\n\nmost influential in this effort were those whose contributions have been most legibly “intellectual”: theologians, philosophers, or historians, often working within churches or in higher education.8 Within American evangelicalism, these would count as Gramsci’s “traditional” intellectuals who marshal the forces of institutions and other sources of traditional authority to maintain the status quo. Working as organic intellectuals within American evangelicalism means that certain actors make music that can threaten the status quo by empowering people to assert their own accounts of worshipful expression or by offering songs that teach people about faith outside of classrooms, Bible studies, or other formal educational settings. The power and possibility of people working outside those institutions is central, Worthen concludes, to the larger struggle over defining evangelicalism in the late 20th century. Adding songwriters, musicians, and music industry professionals to Worthen’s list of intellectuals mitigates this tension while expanding the range of people and places from which influential ideas and knowledge emerge and where they take root. Although songs might be the most recognizable products of this intellectual effort, writing and talking about what those songs mean plays a critical role in how the music is made and how it circulates. Songwriters who describe their music in terms of theology or church history or popular culture or pedagogy take their ideas about music as seriously as they do their songs, recordings, and live performances, and they are quite self-conscious of their roles as creators and as theologians, critics, and teachers. They are formulating visions not only of worship music but of the place of the church and Christians in the world. Their intellectual efforts both make and make sense of the music, its place in the lives of people who use it in worship, and the place of those people in relation to the church and the world at large. One dimension of this formulation of worship music is the construction of its relationship to the genre known as contemporary Christian music (usually referred to by its initials, CCM).9 CCM refers to a wide range of musical styles that share only one element in common: lyrics with explicit Christian content.10 Defining a musical style according to its lyrics is unusual, but it speaks to the ways in which differences among forms of Christian music have been muted in the service of a generic title that serves the logics of the music industry, even if it does not ad-\n\n20\n\n| Making Worship and Music\n\nequately describe the different sonic qualities of the music it subsumes. CCM includes hip-hop and country, heavy metal and pop, made by and for Christians with lyrics that tend to reflect or refer to religious ideas or themes. If CCM has been defined as Christian music for recreational listening, then worship music can be understood as a subcategory of CCM that is produced explicitly for use by congregations in worship. Although they sound similar and songs and artists cross over with some frequency, the intention behind the music generates some significant differences between them. The discursive production of one as distinct from the other aids in defining what worship is and how music might figure within it. Their sonic similarities often result in the two forms being mistaken for one another. In 2007, Ben Ratliff, a music journalist for the New York Times, blurred these distinctions in a story about music in church. “This was Sunday night worship for the young-adult subset of the church’s congregation,” he wrote, “but it was also very much a rock show, one that has helped create a vibrant social world in this otherwise quiet desert town.” Despite his attention to the performance and sounds of the church, Ratliff nevertheless failed to attend to the differences between CCM and worship music writing: “Church-based Christian rock—often referred to as C.C.M., for contemporary Christian music—does not exist primarily to compete in mainstream culture; it exists first to bring together a community.”11 Descriptions like these are pervasive, even among scholars, although they obscure the different roles that music plays within American evangelical culture. William T. Romanowski, one of the first scholars to write about CCM, explained that worship music “is best defined as evangelical popular music that co-opted existing popular musical styles with religious lyrics added for ecclesiastical purposes, specifically, worship and evangelism.”12 Music historian David Stowe, who devoted an entire book to exploring the thematic give and take between “Christian rock” and mainstream popular musical culture during the early 1970s, also failed to note the difference between the more popular genre and the practice of worship. On the first page of his book, Stowe erroneously referred to “Christian rock” as the “default music of worship, sounding forth on Sunday mornings and evenings in thousands of churches across North America.”13 Worthen also observed that “CCM . . . now plays a dominant role in evangelical worship across most denominations.”14\n\nMaking Worship and Music\n\n|\n\n21\n\nLumping all Christian music together under a single generic label creates the impression that all music with lyrics about God or Christ functions similarly within evangelical communities. In so doing, it silences different ways of engaging with music and it ignores the fact that those differences matter, particularly where worship is concerned. In spite of a growing number of crossover artists and songs (discussed in detail in chapter 4), the confusion of CCM and worship music mistakes audience and market for function and form. CCM and worship music cater to the same community but they perform different roles within it, and the ways in which those differences are constructed draw on different understandings of music’s role in Christian culture and on the place of music in worship, more narrowly construed. Some songs might be sung on Sundays in worship and also played on the radio, and some artists might be popular in both domains, but the production of a particular song as a “worship song” relies on a larger discursive and intellectual apparatus that frames it as a song with certain expressive, experiential, and educational features. As a result, definitions of worship music tend to focus on the purpose and practice for which it was initially created. In his dissertation about the independent Christian music industry, Andrew Mall defined worship music as “music . . . intended mainly for use in intentional worship, both formal and informal.”15 Writing for a popular audience, journalist Deborah Evans Price, who covered Christian music extensively for Billboard magazine during the 1990s and early 2000s, offered a narrower definition that emphasized its role in worship. In an article called “Praise and Worship: A Primer,” she twice claimed that “it is music sung directly to God.”16 If music is used for worship, she explained, then it should orient the worshipper’s efforts “vertically,” toward God, rather than “horizontally,” among worshippers.17 The long-serving worship pastor of Saddleback Church, Rick Muchow, defined worship music almost purely with respect to its function: “The message is what makes a worship song a worship song. . . . Any song that helps people devote more of their lives to God is a worship song. The goal of worship is to lead people to respond to the greatness of the one and only living God.”18 Music journalist and essayist John Jeremiah Sullivan offered a more general, if slightly sardonic, definition in his description of “Praise and Worship, a new form of Christian rock in which the band and the audience sing,\n\n22\n\n| Making Worship and Music\n\ntogether, as loud as they can, directly to God.”19 Noting that “praise and worship” was “new,” Sullivan suggested a distinction between one form of music for people to sing together and another form of Christian rock for which this was not the aim or the intent. For each of these writers, the music’s defining feature derives primarily from its ability to serve the needs of worshippers in congregational settings. Some definitions of worship music emphasize qualities that highlight its stylistic proximity to American popular music, which both blurs its relationship with CCM and with popular music more generally. Author and teacher Robb Redman, who favored the term “Contemporary Worship Music,” defined it as “worship music in the genres of popular music produced over the past thirty years by North American Protestant recording and publishing companies, churches, and individuals.”20 In her dissertation, Monique Ingalls departed from Redman’s definition but offered a similar formulation with respect to “the broad repertory of evangelical congregational song composed from the late 1960s to the early 2000s in mainstream Western popular musical styles.”21 Although they acknowledge the significance of style, they still revert to explanations of worship music that privilege its use in and for worship. Ingalls frames her definition in terms of “congregational song.” Redman delineates the difference in terms of how style can inform practice: “Contemporary Christian Music (CCM) is a name applied to music meant for solo or ensemble performance, not congregational singing. . . . Music is performed in keys and tempos that are comfortable for the artist; such settings do not always work for churches.”22 Articulating differences between CCM and worship music, is, in a sense, less about distinguishing one from the other by musical qualities or generic classification, and more about creating meaningful language for describing the different social and cultural roles that music might play in American evangelical life. With echoes of Peterson and Becker, many scholars of music make a similar argument about genre more generally. Instead of approaching the formation of genres as a reflection of technical or stylistic musical differences, they emphasize the production of genres by sociological or marketing concerns.23 Nevertheless, the assignation of genre still seems to reflect an emphasis on musical style, not cultural production. Increasingly sensitive to this terminological problem, other scholars have suggested more flexible terms such as “subcul-\n\nMaking Worship and Music\n\n|\n\n23\n\nture” or “scene” as better modifiers than genre for capturing the social and cultural dimensions of music making.24 CCM, then, might be identified as the music of an evangelical subculture, which would fit nicely with Christian Smith’s deployment of that term to describe American evangelicals.25 Congregational worship music might best be understood as the music of a “scene” within that subculture, wherein its music can be defined by its use for a specific purpose. This mode of describing worship music follows DeNora, who proposed that people conceptualize “musical forms as devices for the organization of experience, as referents for action, feeling, and knowledge formulation. Music’s materials provide resources that can be harnessed in and for imagination, awareness, consciousness, action, for all manner of social formation.”26 For DeNora, engaging with music requires fusing a variety of realms including the imaginary and the social. Recalling that Orsi’s definition of prayer also utilized these terms amplifies the facilitating role that music can play for those who use it to toggle between the place of music in their everyday lives and its more elusive qualities that lend themselves to expressions of worship and not just music.\n\nMaking Expressive Worship Worship music is not only defined by its use in worship, but also by an understanding of what it enables people to express through prayer. Essayist Annie Dillard, whose writing is infused with religious and spiritual themes, offered one of the most popular and compelling visions of prayer as an act fraught with danger in which rote recitation cannot suffice: Why do people in church seem like cheerful, brainless tourists on a packaged tour of the Absolute? . . . Does anyone have the foggiest idea what sort of power we blithely invoke? Or, as I suspect, does no one believe a word of it? The churches are children playing on the floor with their chemistry sets, mixing up a batch of TNT to kill a Sunday morning. It is madness to wear ladies’ straw hats and velvet hats to church; we should all be wearing crash helmets. Ushers should issue life preservers and signal flares; they should lash us to our pews. For the sleeping god may wake someday and take offense, or the waking god may draw us to where we can never return.27\n\n24\n\n| Making Worship and Music\n\nTo my knowledge, Dillard does not identify as an evangelical, though she writes regularly about religion and about the power of prayer in her own life. Her description of prayer as combustible and more profound than ritualized worship was shared by many of the people with whom I spoke for this book. Everyone wanted worship that could capture, in cultural form, some version of their own expression of God’s greatness. These expectations, with their high stakes and potential power, understand worship as a unique form of expression. Dillard’s quasi-comical rendering of church captures the sense that prayer is dangerous work, and that any conventions for prayer should privilege the radical nature of expressive worship over adherence to ritual or form. What makes worship so potentially powerful is, of course, what makes it so dangerous: that congregations of people, equipped with a repertoire of songs and practices, might, together, express their souls directly to God. What kind of expression could matter more? As Anne Lamott, another writer whose essays frequently address spiritual matters, offered, “Prayer is us—humans merely being, as e. e. cummings put it—reaching out to something having to do with the eternal, with vitality, intelligence, kindness, even when we are at our most utterly doomed and skeptical. God can handle honesty, and prayer begins an honest conversation.”28 That honest conversation begins with an understanding of worship as a response to God’s grace. In his Introduction to Christian Worship, James F. White defined “public worship” as “a response in praise to God in the midst of daily life. It is a response not just to word and sacraments but to the totality of daily experience—the sun coming up, the squabbles in the family, the tedium of work. Thus it is a sharing of our words to God in a corporate fashion.”29 Philosopher James K. A. Smith offered a similar description: “The congregation’s response to the call to worship, after gathering, is the ‘invocation’ of God’s mercy and grace. We have a sense that we’re in over our head; we’ve responded to a call—and even the response is by grace—to a vocation that we can’t possibly fulfill on our own. . . . Gathering as an answer to the call to worship is a displacement of any human self-confidence or presumption.”30 Particularly for American evangelicals, whose persistent critique of other streams of Christianity and of religion itself rests on a sense that others are too preoccupied with decorum, formality, and structure, this definition of worship places the individual’s relationship to God at the center of its\n\nMaking Worship and Music\n\n| 25\n\npractice. Worship offers a method for expressing, exploring, and renewing that relationship. Reflecting on her ethnography of a Vineyard church, anthropologist Tanya Luhrmann explained, “One cannot overestimate the importance of prayer in this kind of church. It is the means to Jesus and to God, the tool with which you build the relationship that will literally (as it is understood) save your life. Prayer is modeled as the central act of your life. . . . And the goal of prayer is to develop a direct, personal, and vividly felt relationship with their creator experienced through dialogue, through an interaction between two intentional consciousnesses.”31 This description of the role of prayer in the lives of worshippers reinforces what Chaves noted about the sociological dimensions of worship in the life of a congregation, but Luhrmann’s interpretation shifts attention away from the importance of worship on the congregational level and toward an appreciation of its effects on the lives of individuals. The danger and excitement of worship lies in its promise that it might provide a ritual form that can open the kinds of dialogue and expression to which Luhrmann and Lamott refer. The paradox of the expressive effort of prayer, and of ritual in general, is that in order to create experiences of the sort that they describe, individuals and communities often rely on scripts and formulae, on formats and conventions. In those conventions lurks a suspicion about the ritual forms themselves. Edging too far in one direction, one risks falling prey to rote institutionalization. Too far in the other might lead to the dispersion of community, or to theological or moral relativism. This paradox is central to expectations about worship and to definitions of worship as both structured by ritual and intended to exceed ritual forms. This is brought into clearer relief in emerging definitions of worship that privilege expressions outside of normative, church-bound settings. In fact, a strong current of thought around 21st century evangelical worship questions the need to limit worship to regularly scheduled congregational prayer. Instead, many insist on understanding worship as a “lifestyle,” in which any manner of responses to God’s grace should be considered valid. Dan Kimball, an outspoken leader of younger Christians called the “emerging church,” explains that worship is not something we do only once a week on Sunday morning or evening. Worship is a lifestyle of being in love with God and in awe of\n\n26\n\n| Making Worship and Music\n\nhim all week long (Romans 12:1–2). It is offering our love, our adoration, and our praise to him through all of our lives. We are to adore the Lord all week, not just at “worship gatherings.” Our minds, our hearts, our bodies, our marriages, our families, our jobs—everything should be offered to him in worship. This includes what we think about, what we do, what we say, what we eat, and what we spend time doing.32\n\nThis was made clear to me in a conversation I had with Christian singersongwriter Sara Groves, a well-known and much beloved artist in the world of Christian music. Groves was as plainspoken as she was insightful, and her choice of words in our conversation matched the sharpness of her lyrics. We were talking about writing songs and the nature of worship, and how those two practices intertwine and weave their way through her life. “I am a worshipper,” she explained, “and I try to do that in everything that I do and do it with excellence.” She did not limit her sense of being a worshipper to singing or songwriting alone, and she refused to privilege those practices above others where she feels that she is worshipping by “bringing glory to God,” like gardening and being a mother. Declining to separate music from her broader conception of how she lives a “fully integrated life of the believer,” Groves explained patiently to me, “I write worship music. I don’t write congregational worship music. I have tried over the years to write corporate [congregational] worship songs and I went through a real period where I was really trying to write, and they just never turned out very corporate.”33 The difference between worship music and congregational worship music, Groves explained, is only partially “semantic.” It rests in part on her understanding that “worship is bigger” than the prescribed times of church-based, congregational singing. Defining worship in terms of whatever congregations sing on Sunday mornings between 9:30 and 11:00, she felt, would limit the range of ways in which people understand and, more importantly, express themselves in worship. Charlie Peacock, a longtime producer, songwriter, and critic of Christian music, put it similarly: “There is no distinction between sacred and secular. . . . It’s all for God, or it’s all for nothing.”34 In this formulation, the call to worship does not limit opportunities to worship by either music or setting. It encompasses a range of expressions and forms, and it can infuse every aspect of the life of a worshipper, allowing one to experience and respond\n\nMaking Worship and Music\n\n| 27\n\nto God’s grace wherever one is at the moment. Limiting worshipful expression to a specific place or time, Groves patiently and passionately explained, sells worship short, sells her own expressive life short, and, as a result, sells God short as well. Such is the power and possibility of worship, and it is why Groves’s distinction between “worship music” and “corporate worship music” is so revealing and so significant. It speaks both to her capacious definition of worship and to her understanding that different modes of worship might take different forms. This conceptualization of worship seeks to mute the tension between ritualized expression and the desire for more permissive and powerful forms of worship that stretches back to the late 1960s, when baby boomers first embraced worship music that drew on rock and roll to better express their faith. They wanted music that they could claim as their own and that, they claimed, could speak for them.35 They brought guitars and drum kits into worship. They wrote songs that sounded more like the Byrds than Bach, and they traded in their hymnals for mimeographed handouts and overhead projectors. “Rock ‘n’ roll was simple,” wrote critic Michael Hamilton. “It engaged deep emotions, and it portrayed itself as free of hypocrisy. But above all else, it focused the baby boomers’ longing and anxieties, their values and ideals. . . . Music was so important to baby boomers, it was inevitable that if they came to church at all, they would be bringing their music with them.”36 The ability to express one’s faith in that idiom helped to reinvigorate American evangelicalism by drawing people who might not otherwise have come to church, but also by creating an opportunity for baby boomers to express themselves and experience worship in a musical aesthetic that they felt they owned.37 As a result, early descriptions staked a great deal on the expressive power of the music itself. “The great vehicle of the Jesus movement is music,” Robert Ellwood, the author of one of the first scholarly examinations of this phenomenon, explained. “The ability of Jesus rock and gospel melodies to generate rich and powerful feelings in a mood and emotion-oriented age has brought and held the movement together. It is largely music that has made the movement part of a pop culture and it is the Jesus movement as pop culture that distinguishes it from what is going on in the churches.”38 Ronald Enroth, another early scholar of the Jesus People, described the music of a prayer meeting in similar terms.\n\n28\n\n| Making Worship and Music\n\nThe music—said to be a fulfillment of the command to worship the Lord with singing and praises and accompanied by the orchestra and unbridled foot-stomping, hand-clapping, and dancing in the Spirit—is truly impressive. It is joyous; it is celebrative; it is nearly a frenzy. And most of all, it is loud, almost unbelievably so. Thirty instruments and three hundred people singing at the tops of their voices.39\n\nEthnographic reports from worship music’s formative years both described the phenomenon and helped to make it legible and reasonable to parents and mainline Protestants who might otherwise be worried about what these young people were doing in Jesus’s name. In so doing, these explanations also shaped discursive formations about the music, what it meant, how it felt, and both how and why young people were using it to worship. They ascribed an affective power to the music itself, investing in the new sounds of worship an expressive depth and range that contrasted with the modes of worship from most mainline Protestant churches. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, this represented the expressive vanguard of a resurgent American evangelicalism, defining religious ritual for what sociologist Wade Clark Roof has called the “generation of seekers,” which he contrasted to the religious “dwellers” of the preceding generation.40 Religious seeking implied a kind of dynamism to religious life that many baby boomers understood to be lacking in the religious commitments of their parents. They wanted rituals that could allow them to express their personal yearnings to and knowledge of God in ways that were not formulaic, but deeply felt. They wanted music that could help them to break out of the ritual forms they had inherited in the name of a more expressive, exuberant set of worship practices. In the decades since, the styles and sounds of worship music have continued to change, as a younger generation of evangelicals has emerged that seems even more prepared than their baby boomer parents to embrace a lifestyle of worship that emphasizes the personal dimensions of religious expression and, simultaneously, to invest even more deeply in the music that seems to enable it.\n\nMaking Worship and Music\n\n|\n\n29\n\nExperiencing Worship Worship music developed during this period both to provide more expressive range in evangelical worship and because it promised a deeper experience of worship. Without reifying religious experience as the aim of worship, the experiential side of worship nevertheless came to represent a powerful locus of both authority and understanding. It provided another way of knowing and learning religious practice that often seemed more powerful than text and more moving than rote recitation. The experience of worship as a kind of open channel of communication with God fit well within the long-running American evangelical critique that religion has become too formulaic and too structured, and that it lacks the flexibility, responsiveness, and creativity through which one can foster a direct relationship with the divine. The perceived power of worship music that drew on rock and roll seemed to deepen and expand the experience of worship, drawing on emotion to propel worshippers’ attention toward God. Experience, while not the intention of worship, provided a powerful concept for articulating worship when it worked. This approach emphasized individual experience over collective action or ritual forms. Peacock’s, Groves’s, and Kimball’s embrace of worship as a lifestyle suggests that their own faith commitments outweigh the efforts of religious institutions to rein them in. I heard this opinion more than once during Sunday worship services when a worship leader or pastor said something like, “I have Jesus; I don’t need religion.” That formulation captured an approach to faith that sought to dispense with formalities and empty ritual in favor of an immediacy of connection between humans and the divine. Rejecting religion, in this context, represents a desire to expand one’s own relationship with God, outside of or in addition to institutional religious structures. More severely, some have posited that religion has become something of an obstacle to or a distraction from their expression of a more immediate engagement with God. A billboard for a popular evangelical Silicon Valley church that appeared during the early 2010s provocatively asked potential members, “Not Religious? Neither Are We” (see figure 1.1). Books like Phillip Yancey’s Soul Survivor, which is subtitled “How Thirteen Unlikely Mentors Helped My Faith Survive the Church,” offer accounts of Christianity imperiled or at least challenged by institutional\n\n30\n\n| Making Worship and Music\n\nFigure 1.1. “Not Religious? Neither Are We.” Billboard for C3 Church, Palo Alto (renamed Vive Church). Photo by Jan Adams. Used by permission.\n\nstructures.41 Yancey’s book is a spiritual autobiography of sorts, written in response to his question, “What allowed me to ransom a personal faith from the damaging effects of religion?”42 This theme also echoed in Groves’s capacious definition of worship as a lifestyle; throughout our interview, she called herself a Christian and a worshipper, but never once used the words “religion” or “religious.” Each of these examples represents a rejection of the formality of church-and-ritual-based religion in favor of something more personal, more personalizable, and more deeply rooted in individual encounters with the divine. As a result of this approach to religion and faith, many people have become religious “nones,” despite retaining a deep sense of faith, a commitment to regular prayer practices, and even regular church attendance.43 The Pew Research Center’s reports on the American religious landscape, released in 2007 and 2015, both found a sharp rise in the religiously unaffiliated. Sociologist Robert Putnam referred to them as the “fastest growing group on the U.S. religious spectrum,” a label that highlighted both their demographic growth and their inclusion within a broader religious discourse.44 The increase in people who do not identify as religious does not necessarily mean that more and more people are identifying as “secular” or “atheist,” but rather that the appeal of religious denominations and affiliations appears to be on the decline. As sociologists Claude Fischer and Michael Hout have found, “religious nones”\n\nMaking Worship and Music\n\n|\n\n31\n\nalso include any number of evangelical Christians who attend church regularly, who have a strong belief in God, and who read the Bible and worship regularly, but whose faith commitments have outflanked their willingness to identify with or adhere to any particular religious denomination.45 The Pew Research Center corroborated this finding, reporting that 21 percent of “nones” pray every day and 68 percent say they believe in God, though with respect to congregational worship more generally, the Pew Research Center observed that “the religiously unaffiliated population is increasingly composed of people who rarely or never attend religious services.” Yet Pew also noted that the numbers of people who attend church regularly have not varied much over the past few decades despite an increase in people claiming to have “no religion.”46 Even though many claim to have no religion, they seem to maintain behaviors that might resemble religion. Some portion of this trend can be attributed to the “new metaphysicals” or to the rise of people claiming to be “spiritual but not religious.”47 Denominations seem to be weakening but religion and the individual impulses that motivate it remain powerfully ensconced in American private lives and subcultures, even among those who claim to have none of it. The readiness with which so many evangelicals disavow the term “religion” to describe their commitments to God and the Bible draws in part on the strength of their personal encounters with God both within and beyond formal “religious” rites. This perspective aligns with philosopher William James’s notion of “religious experience.” He argued that there is nothing definitively “religious” about the feelings with which religious experience is associated, and he instead thought of religion as a descriptive category for particular kinds of experience: “There thus seems to be no one elementary religious emotion, but only a common storehouse of emotions upon which religious objects may draw, so there might conceivably also prove to be no one specific and essential kind of religious object, and no one specific and essential kind of religious act.”48 Drawing on the American transcendentalist tradition, James saw nothing unique in religion per se, but he certainly understood the utility of religion to refer to a category of experiences, or as a way of organizing ideas, objects, experiences, and people: “The name ‘religion’ should be reserved for the fully organized system of thought, feeling, and institution, for the Church, in short, of which [this] personal religion is called,\n\n32\n\n| Making Worship and Music\n\nbut is a fractional element.”49 Even for James, religion is not the source of those feelings but a discursive structure deployed to make sense of them, organize them, or describe them in terms of “windows through which the mind looks out upon a more extensive and inclusive world.”50 For James, encounters with something transcendent validate religion as a framework for understanding them, not the other way around. Prefiguring an observation of Jonathan Z. Smith, one of the most influential scholars of religion in the late 20th century, James understood religion as an anthropological category, not a theological one.51 James’s formulation of religion as grounded more firmly in personal experience follows that of German philosopher Friedrich Schleiermacher, who was among the first to suggest that religion is best understood not by looking at doctrine or text, but by examining how individuals experience it.52 His emphasis on the centrality of subjective experience in defining religion initiated a new stream of research into the nature of religion, as told from the subjective perspective rather than the institutional one.53 Religious studies scholar Ann Taves sharpened this observation further, formulating a notion of “experiences deemed religious” as a method for understanding religion itself as a product rather than a source of experience, despite the difficulties in rendering “experience” itself legible to others. “Rather than abandon the study of experience,” she wrote, “we should disaggregate the concept of ‘religious experience’ and study the wide range of experiences to which religious experience has been attributed.”54 Taves offers a way of understanding how people define religion and, as importantly, how they define what it is not. By appealing to subjective accounts of experiences that might be “deemed religious” as a way of collecting “building blocks” of religion, Taves both accepted the idea that religion is a discursive production and reaffirmed the sense that individual experience lay at the core of whatever people might define as religion. Thus, she argues that religion should not be understood as an ontological category but, as for James and Smith, an anthropological one. American evangelicals who reject religion also follow in this tradition, hoping to avoid the human constructions of religion in favor of a deeper, less mediated, and more expansive notion of faith and of the ways in which one expresses it. With respect to the role of worship in what is called “religious experience,” anthropologist Martin Stringer argues that it is impossible\n\nMaking Worship and Music\n\n| 33\n\nto establish the nature of worship, and that, at best, scholars can only engage with the “experience” of worship. Drawing on William James, Stringer argues that worship is not the same thing as a text or a song, nor is it equivalent to the performance of a text; rather, worship is, first and foremost, the experience of a text. “‘Worship,’” he explains, “implies something other than, or perhaps more than, the rite, the ritual, or the liturgy. The use of the word ‘worship’ places the emphasis not on the text or the performance as a thing in itself . . . but implies some level of engagement or experience of that thing.”55 The problem, of course, is that experience, central as it is to evangelical Christianity, is so deeply subjective, and, as a result, Stringer resigns himself to conclude that “the problem with the experience (of worship) itself, however, is that it is practically impossible to say what it is, or even what kind of thing it is.”56 Stringer’s critique of how we understand religion echoes claims of scholars like Peter Berger, who has argued that religious experiences are “irreducible” to quotidian or scholarly logics, and thus exist outside social and cultural frameworks.57 Yet people describe their experiences in words and, more importantly, continue to pursue them through the use of social and cultural forms, even when those linguistic or ritual forms fail to capture the entirety of the experience in question. Like Robert Orsi, Wayne Proudfoot, a philosopher of religion, put this perspective sharply when he argued that what appear to be transcendent encounters that defy expression are actually beholden to cultural logics and"
