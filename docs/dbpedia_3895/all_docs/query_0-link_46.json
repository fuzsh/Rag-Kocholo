        "text": "researched and compiled by Jo-Ann Beck\n\nLet’s hear and discuss our modern hymns, praise songs, and hymnal music,\n\nused in our weekly Sunday Worship Service.\n\nAnd Can It Be\n\nChrist, the True and Better Adam\n\nHymn #469 “How Sweet and Awesome Is the Place”\n\nHymn #286 “Worship Christ the Risen King”\n\nAs we celebrate the Lord’s Supper , we will have a wonderful opportunity to sing some wonderful music back to our Lord.\n\nStuart Townend took the inspiring hymn, “And Can It Be” and kept the melody, but revised part of the lyrics. This hymn always brings goosebumps to me as i sing it. It was originally written by Charles Wesley. Di you know that he wrote an average of 2 hymns each week for 50 years?! That works out to be about 5,000 – 6,000 hymns.\n\nThe Getty’s, along with Matt Papa, wrote, “Christ, the True and Better Adam”, our second praise hymn. As you read the lyrics, you’ll see it’s not just Adam, but Isaac, Moses and David that Christ exemplifies and excels. Our Middle School students have learned about God and His covenants with these men…yet only God could fulfill this ‘contract’. He made is for man’s benefit, but Christ has to serve as the mediator.\n\nHymn #469, “How Sweet and Awesome Is the Place” was written by Isaac Watts. It is an old Irish hymn melody that flows beautifully with the words. Watts began learning Latin at age 4 . At 16, he went to study in London under Reverend Thomas Rowe.\n\nJack Hayford wrote our last hymn, #286, “Worship Christ the Risen King” in 1986. He wrote over 500 hymns and choruses, with the most well-known, “Majesty” made popular by Sandy Patty. He was “an acknowledged ‘bridge-builder’, helping to forge healthy bonds among all segments of the Body of Christ…Recognized for his balance in preaching the Word, avoiding extremes while not diluting or compromising the demands of truth.”\n\n1/21/24 – Worship Service\n\nRejoice\n\nHe Will Hold Me Fast\n\nHymn #441 “Jesus Shall Reign”\n\nHymn #442 “Arise, O God”\n\nAs Pastor David continues in Mark 4, with 3 parables, be sure to see how our songs lifted to our God, reflect any and all of these verses.\n\nOur two praise Hymns are by the Getty’s. “Rejoice” is a song of gratitude and praise. The tune is very uplifting with the repeated phrase , “Praise the Lord”. If you haven’t sung this before, the catchy tune is one that is very easy to pick up.\n\n“He will Hold Me Fast” has been sung several times, so we should all be familiar with it. Where the first song lifts our hearts, this second one reminds us that when times are difficult, God will hold onto us, firmly and tenderly. If you have time, read over Psalm 139 as a parallel. This hymn was originally written in 1906 , by Ada R. Habershon.\n\nIsaac Watts composed hymn #441 in 1719. It reflects Psalm 72. It was always the goal of Watts to infuse the Gospel into the Psalms. During his day, there was no organized mission effort, in order to spread the Good News from ‘shore to shore’. Today, with our technology, we are able to share God’s Kingdom in places we’ve never been able to before.\n\nThere is little background on the author of hymn 442, “Arise ,O God”. We know William Hurn was born in 1754 and died in 1829. he was a teacher, served in the military for about a year, then was ordained and served until his passing.This Hymn was written in 1813, and seeks to encourage us to reach out to the world , with our Lord’s help and guidance.\n\nSee you Sunday for Worship, and the brief business meeting and electing of officers afterwards.\n\n1/14/24 – Worship Service\n\nSongs Come, Thou Almighty King\n\nHow Deep the Father’s Love For Us\n\nHymn #100 “Holy, Holy, Holy!”\n\nHymn #383 “Almighty God, Your Word Is Cast”\n\nOur sermon is based on Mark 4: 1-34 and a look at 4 well-known parables.\n\nOur praise hymns are familiar, and both are done by the Getty’s and their other musicians. “How Deep The Father’s Love for Us” reminds us in Verse 2 to remember that when Christ hung on the cross, he was there because of our sin. “…my sin upon His shoulders, ashamed I hear my mocking cry…among the scoffers”.\n\n“Come Thou Almighty King” follows the text of hymn 101, but a chorus has been added which praises the Trinity.\n\nHymn 100, “Holy, Holy, Holy” was composed by Reginald Heber ( 1783-1826). While the Anglican Church of his day preferred the metrical psalters, he helped introduce Compositions by Newton and Cowper. Alfred Lord Tennyson claimed that this hymn should be considered the world’s greatest hymn.\n\n“Almighty Word, Your Lot is Cast”, hymn 383, is a new one for me. It was written by John Cawood ( 1775-1852) in 1819. he wanted it sung after the sermon as it alludes to thee parable of the Sower and the Seeds. It was his intention that we should remind ourselves to plant God’s Word into our minds which should be fertile and ready to reactive the message.\n\nBefore the sermon, we will sing “Speak , O Lord”, again a Getty composition. The lyrics and the melody should put our minds in the proper frame to receive the sermon.\n\n1/7/24 – Worship Service\n\nYour Words are Wonderful (Sovereign Grace)\n\nWe Will Feast in the House of Zion\n\nHymn #30 “Our God, Our Help in Ages Past”, vv.1-3, 7\n\nHymn #342 “Christ Is Made the Sure Foundation”, vv.1, 3, 5\n\nBlessings to you this new year! As we are ringing out the old and in with the new, pay close attention to the 4 songs we are using to augment our worship this week. They are both old and new, yet all are firmly based on the Holy Scriptures.\n\nOur praise songs are familiar, and are from Sovereign Grace and Sandra McCracken and the Getty’s. Both are based on the Psalms. “Your Words Are Wonderful” is adapted from the first 16 verses of Psalm 119.\n\n“We Will Feast in the House of Zion”, written by Sandra McCracken, also uses referneces from the Psalms. this time it is 126 and 139, with portions from Isaiah 30 and 43, Lamentaions, Philippians and Romans. Its focus is to be encouraging both now and looking to the future.\n\nHymn 30, “Our God, Our Help in Ages Past” is derived from Psalm 90. Isaac Watts wrote this because he was concerned for the Cogregational churches of his time. Queen Anne, who was tolerant of those not aligning with the Church of England, was on her deathbed, with no heir. Watts was concerned as to the future and the Church. This hymn deals with Time and the God who is both above time and the creator of time. Watts wanted believers to trust that God was in control.\n\n“Christ is Made the Sure Foundation”, hymn 342, is from a 7th Century Latin hymn ( to the tune of ‘Angels From the Realms of Glory’. John Mason Neale ( 1818-1866) spent many years translating ancient Latin and Greek hymns. Isn’t it fascinating to see that what we think of as Past, present and Future , is joined together for us to praise our gracious Father?!\n\n12/24/23 – AM / PM Worship Service\n\nCome Thou Long Expected Jesus\n\nHow Great Our Joy\n\nHymn #201 “O Little Town of Bethlehem”\n\nHymn #196 “Come, Thou Long-Expected Jesus”\n\nEmmanuel (Hallowed Manger Ground)\n\nBehold Him\n\nHymn #194 “O Come, O Come, Emmanuel”\n\nHymn #210 “Silent Night! Holy Night!”\n\n12/17/23 – Woship – 3rd Sunday of Advent JOY\n\nEmmanuel Hallowed Manger Ground\n\nThe First Noel (Born is the King)\n\nHymn #200 “It Came Upon The Midnight Clear”\n\nHymn #195 “Joy to the World! The Lord Is Come”\n\nHello, beloved friends. I need to take the next few weeks off from doing the MUSIC NOTES. Just like most of you, this season can be very overwhelming- even in a good way. I will start back again in January.\n\nUntill then, a great source of mine is the website, Hymnology.com, and of course, Google. feel free to check them out , especially when you have been moved by a particular hymn.\n\nBlessed Holidays to all\n\n12/10/23 – Worship – 2nd Sunday of Advent\n\nCome Thou Long-Expected Jesus\n\nCrown Him (Christmas)\n\nHymn #203 “Hark! The Herald Angels Sing”\n\nHymn #213 “What Child is This?”\n\nHello, beloved friends. I need to take the next few weeks off from doing the MUSIC NOTES. Just like most of you, this season can be very overwhelming- even in a good way. I will start back again in January.\n\nUntill then, a great source of mine is the website, Hymnology.com, and of course, Google. feel free to check them out , especially when you have been moved by a particular hymn.\n\nBlessed Holidays to all\n\n12/3/23 – Worship – 1st Sunday of Advent\n\nPraise His Name\n\nAngels from the Realms of Glory/Emmanuel\n\nHymn #194 “O Come, O Come, Emmanuel”\n\nHymn #214 “Angels We Have Heard on High”\n\nHello, beloved friends. I need to take the next few weeks off from doing the MUSIC NOTES. Just like most of you, this season can be very overwhelming- even in a good way. I will start back again in January.\n\nUntill then, a great source of mine is the website, Hymnology.com, and of course, Google. feel free to check them out , especially when you have been moved by a particular hymn.\n\nBlessed Holidays to all\n\n11/26/23 – Worship w/communion\n\nTurn Your Eyes\n\nO Come, O Come, Emmanuel\n\nHymn #715 “Come, Ye Thankful People, Come”\n\nHymn #125 “Let All Things Now Living”\n\nOrdination and Installation Service\n\nHymn #469 “How Sweet and Awesome Is the Place”\n\nHymn #347 “The Church’s One Foundation”\n\nOh dear, I try to keep this short, but there are way too many interesting tidbits. So please bear with me.\n\nThe first praise hymn is the familiar, “Turn Your eyes Upon Jesus”. ‘Eyes’ can be an organ of sight, or it can be figurative of God. I found 68 verses using ‘eye’ or ‘eyes’.\n\nOur 2nd praise is the hymn,”O Come, O Come, Emmanuel”. This is a 12th C Latin Antiphons. This is a Plainsong style whose text is from Psalms. There are 7 prayers, called the Great ( or O) Antiphons for Advent. It focuses on Rev 22:20-‘Come ,Lord Jesus’. The 7 titles are: Sapientia (Wisdom), Adonai (Lord), Radix Jesse ( Root of Jesse), Clavis David (Key of the Kingdom), Oriens(Dawn), Rex Gentium (King of Nations), Emmanuel (God with us). If you reverse the 1st letters , it spells out ERO CRAS: ‘I AM COMMING SOON”.\n\n“Come, Ye Thankful People, Come” (715), was composed by Henry Alford (1810-1871). He was known to pray before and After a meal, as well as at the end of day. This hymn was for harvest festivals in English villages. It focuses on completed tasks, jobs well done, and for God’s harvest of His own people.\n\nHymn #125, “Let All Things Now Living” was written by Kathryn K Davis.\n\nShe studied at Wellesley College and also as a teaching assistant there. After 1929, she focused on music composition. She wrote over 800 , mainly choral works. Interestingly, she wrote one of my childhood Christmas tunes: “Little Drummer Boy”.( and now, you too, have the drum sounds stuck in your head!). Hopefully, the tune from this hymn, ‘Ash Grove’, will replace the Pa rum pum pum pum.\n\n11/19/23 -Worship\n\nOnly a Holy God\n\nIn Christ Alone\n\nHymn #98 “Now Thank We All Our God”\n\nHymn #116 “For the Beauty of the Earth”\n\nPlease stop and consider, all that you have to be thankful for in your life.\n\nOur praise hymns are familiar and very appropriate for this season. “In Christ Alone”, by the team of Getty and Townend, wants us to ponder what you are looking to Christ to do for you. While God has given us many gifts, the Gift of His Son is the most important one. Try to count all the descriptive words and phrases about CHrist. In just the 1st verse, I found over 10.\n\nCityAlight recorded over 6 years ago, “Only A Holy God”. Our Middle and High schoolers are learning about who God is. Just last week , we focused on His holiness. Again, pay attention to the lyrics as they focus on God’s greatness.\n\n“For the Beauty of the Earth” (#116), was written by Folliet Pierpont in 1864. He was born in Bath, about 97 miles west of London. This was a city that existed during Roman times, and got its name from the warm springs there, so suitable for bathing. Pierpont attended and taught at Cambridge University. At age 29, he returned home and was overwhelmed by his hometown’s beauty. This caused him to write an 8 stanza Communion hymn that ended with,’ Christ our God, to thee we raise this our sacrifice of praise’. Notice that each verse focuses on a different kind of beauty.\n\nHymn #98, “Now Thank We All Our God” was written by pastor Martin Rinkart in 1636. It is the 2nd most sung hymn in Germany. He was the only minister in Eilenberg during the Thirty Years War. In 1637, he performed over 5,000 funerals, including his wife’s. This hymn reminds us that, in spite of trials, we can, and must, praise our God.\n\n11/12/23 – Worship\n\nCome Thou, Almighty King\n\nCome, Behold the Wondrous Mystery\n\nHymn #311 “Hail to the Lord’s Anointed”\n\nHymn #580 “Lead On O King Eternal”\n\nContinuing in Mark, we will look at the teachings of fasting and the Sabbath.\n\nOne of our praise Hymns is a beautiful mix of old and new. “Come Thou, Almighty King” has been updated by the Getty’s. The lyrics are the same, with the tune just a little refreshed , and a chorus added praising the Trinity. The original hymn was anonymously written, but has been attributed to Charles Wesley. It imitates the English national anthem, “God Save Our Gracious King” that had just been adopted. If it was Wesley who wrote it, it is assumed that he was reminding people who is most important in ruling….\n\nBoswell, Papa and Bleeker, three composers who work with the Gettys, wrote, “Come , Behold the Wondrous Mystery”. In Christianity, a mystery is when God reveals His purposes. Paul identifies the mystery of Christ: the atoning death, God’s plan to include Gentiles, and the reconciliation of all things to God.\n\nHymn #311, “Hail to the Lord’s Anointed”, was written by James Montgomery ( 1771-1854). In 1822, though a Moravian, he spoke at a Methodist missionary meeting. The Methodists were just beginning to organize outreach activities. Montgomery had published 11 volumes of poetry and at least 400 hymns. Our Trinity Hymnal has 10 of his works.\n\n“Lead On O King Eternal”, #580, was written by Ernest Warburton Shurtleff (1862-1917). By the time he graduated for Andover Seminary, he had published 4 books of poetry. He was asked to write a poem for graduation, but instead wrote this hymn. He and his wife moved to Europe in 1905, and during WWI, they were active in refuge relief work in Paris.\n\n11/5/23 – Worship\n\nGod of Wonders (Agnus Dei)\n\nChrist Our Hope in Love and Death\n\nHymn #444 “O Zion, Haste, Your Mission High Fulfilling”\n\nHymn #467 “Wonderful Grace of Jesus”\n\nBe sure to read over Mark 2:13-17. And also check out the 1st statement in the Heidelberg Catechism of 1563, Isaiah 52 and Romans 10.\n\nThe last 3 are reasons for 2 of our hymns Sunday.\n\nOur first praise hymn is “God of Wonders (Agnus Dei). This was composed by Mac Powell ( 3rd Day) and Caedmon’s Call. It was played as a wake up call while the Space Shuttle Columbia was on its second mission . The astronauts commented that is was most appropriate, as they could see many wonders for their vantage point. Sadly, a few days later, Columbia disintegrated while in space and all 7 astronauts were lost.\n\n“Christ , Our Hope in Life and Death” is another beautiful hymn from the Getty’s ( 2021). “This modern hymn…expresses the comfort and assurance that flow from trusting Christ, who has conquered death and guaranteed our future by His resurrection”. It was inspired by the 1st question of the Heidelberg Catechism.\n\nMary A. Thompson, one night , caring for her critically ill child (1868), suddenly realized that what was most important to God was the evangelizing of the world. She wondered if she would be willing to , if her son recovered, let him go as a missionary? From this , she wrote hymn #444, “O Zion, Haste, Your Mission High Fulfilling” . This hymn blends Isaiah 52 and Romans 10.\n\nHymn #467, “Wonderful Grace of Jesus” was written by Haldor Lillenas in 1918. He was a Nazarene minister in Illinois. While both he and his wife were hymnwriters, they did not have money at the time to purchase a piano. He paid $5 for a ‘wheezy little organ’- and the rest is history, as they say. Key here is “you cannot outs in God’s grace, His forgiveness is greater than your guilt”.\n\n10/29/23 – Worship w/Communion\n\nAmazing Grace (My Chains are gone)\n\nUnto Him\n\nHymn #168 “I Greet Thee, Who My Sure Redeemer Art”\n\nHymn #92 “A Mighty Fortress Is Our God”\n\nAre you as excited about October 31st to arrive? No, I am NOT talking about Halloween. The most significant event on that day was when Martin Luther posted his 95 questions and concerns on the door of the Wittenberg Church. Thus began the Reformation within the Christian Church. Did you realized that Luther, Calvin and the others were NOT calling for a NEW Christian Church, but merely to re-form it back to its roots? Have you thought that WE should constantly be reforming our beliefs to align them with the Scriptures? When we say the Apostle’s Creed , it is prefaced by the minister with these words:”Christian, what do you believe?”. May we all seek to bring our thoughts and beliefs into the ‘form’ that God requires of us.\n\nMay you have a blessed Reformation Day!\n\nThis week, our praise songs will be Chris Tomlin’s, “Amazing Grace( My Chains Are Gone), and our new song from last week, “Unto Him” ( Based on Jude 24, 25).\n\nHymn #168, “I Greet Thee, Who My Sure Redeeemer Art”, doesn’t list an author, but it has been attributed to John Calvin. Were you aware that he did NOT want either organ nor choir to be part of his Sunday services? His desire to REFORM worship was to have the congregation sing ( churches at that time did not allow this), and to only sing the Psalms.\n\nAnd we all know who wrote hymn #92. Martin Luther wrote this hymn, based on Psalm 46:1-3, in 1529 ( 12 years after Wittenberg ). In our everyday disappointments and worries, when we hear about events happening in the world, may we always remember that God IS our fortress, redeemer and Savior. He is truly Sovereign.\n\n10/22/23 – Worship\n\nUnto Him\n\nJesus Messiah\n\nHymn #53 “Praise to the Lord, the Almighty”\n\nHymn #585 “Take My Life, and Let It Be”\n\n“Something old, something new” , no, I’m not getting married, but our two praise hymns fit this ditty. The first one, if you read the Eblast, is new to us. There is a link for you to listen to it before Sunday. “Unto Him”, from the duo, Shane and Shane, is based on Jude 24 and 25. ( Jude is just before Revelation) This is a very familiar set of verses, in fact , I sang it with the youth group I was helping, 50 years ago! The tune may not be as easy as others to pick up on, but take some time to listen ahead of Sunday.\n\nThe second praise song, is very familiar to us. “Jesus Messiah” was written by Chris Tomlin. It is the story and purpose of Christ. See how many names for Jesus you can find, and then tie this in with Ephesians 4:25-5:2, and ask yourself, what are we to do in order to be like Him?\n\nHymn #53, “Praise to the Lord Almighty” is based on Psalm 103. It was written by Joachim Neander , who’s father and grandfather were Lutheran ministers. He, however led a very rebellious life up to the age of 20. Then God reached down and changed him. He became a German Reformed theologian. Even though he died at age 30, he is recognized as the most important German Reformed hymn writer. This hymn is his most famous one of the 60 he wrote.\n\n“Take My Life And Let It Be”, #585, was composed by Frances Havergal in 1874. I previously noted that she wrote this while on a retreat with 10 other folks: Christian and Non-Christian. How many body parts does she think we should use in God’s service? Be sure to compare with Sunday’s scripture, Ephesians 4:25-5:2.\n\n10/15/23 – Worship\n\nAnd Can It Be\n\nChrist is Mine Forevermore\n\nHymn #261 “What Wondrous Love Is This”\n\nHymn #247 “O Sacred Head, Now Wounded”\n\nOh, what beautiful music we have this week to offer to our Lord in praise and gratefulness!\n\nCityAlight leads us off with , “Christ Is Mine, Forevermore”. This is a quiet, folksy tune, which allows us to truly focus on the lyrics. Each verse uses the word, ‘mine’, so that as we sing, we can make it a personal prayer to God. most importantly, we can rest in our sure and blessed future.\n\nStuart Townend ( who works with the Getty’s) has slightly ‘tweaked’ the old hymn by Charles Wesley: “And Can it Be “ ( 455 in our hymnal). The tune is the same, but only stanzas 1,3,4 and 5 are used. The last 3 verses repeat their final line, instead of using the Chorus.\n\n“What Wondrous Love is This”, ( #261), is an American folk hymn. It was first published in 1811 durin the 2nd Great awakening. The melody is similar to an English ballad. ‘what is a ballad?’- I’m glad you asked! It is a slow, sentimental song that usually tells a story. Can you agree with that description?\n\nFinally, hymn 247, “O Sacred Head Now Wounded”, is truly ‘and oldie, but a goodie’, in that it was written by Bernard of Clairvaux in the early 1100’s ( that’s more than 900 years ago). Bernard became the abbot of the Clairvaux monastery at the age of 25. He wrote several other hymns, but also was instrumental in reforming the Benedictine monasticism, as well as encouraging the 2nd Crusade. The musical arrangement in our hymnal was done by Johann S. Bach. Be sure to see the pictures of God’s love, and the suffering of Christ.\n\n10/08/23 – Worship\n\nCome, Thou Almighty King\n\nPraise His Name\n\nHymn #521 “My Hope Is Built on Nothing Less”\n\nHymn #327 “One Day He’s Coming\n\nSo many activities in our Church life. Have you joined a prayer group, Bible Study, or other enrichment for your spiritual walk? You know, it’s not to late to ‘jump’ into one or more of these programs. And, of course, be sure to attend the 9:30 class each Sunday, “Respect the Image”.\n\nMusic this week features a focus on Revelations 22:1-7. In fact, if you look at the key words in each title of our songs, you will find: ‘Come’, ‘Praise’, ‘Hope’ and ‘Coming’.\n\n“Come, Thou Almighty King”, was written anonymously, but has been attributed to Charles Wesley. The lyrics are similar to England’s National anthem: “God Save Our gracious King”. If it was in fact Wesley, it was felt that it was his way to remind people of what is to be their true priorities.\n\n“Praise His Name” is our ‘new’ praise hymn from last month. Take a moment to read over the Call to Worship, Revelation1:5b-7, to see how each reflects the other.\n\nEdward Mote was raised by parents in London who owned a pub. He had no idea who God was until he apprenticed under a cabinetmaker, who took him to church. One of the hymns he wrote was , #521, “My Hope is Built on Nothing Less”. He wrote other hymns and later published them under the title, “The Immutable Basis of a Sinner’s Hope”. ( sort of makes our ‘Trinity Hymnal’ look a bit dull as far as the title goes,huh?)\n\nFinally, hymn #327, “One Day He’s Coming”, was composed by J. Wilbur Chapman in 1910. He was a Presbyterian Minister and evangelist. He served under D.L.Moody at the Chicago World’s Fair, he hired Billy Sunday at $40 per week to assist in evangelistic duties, and served at Bethany Presbyterian- the largest Presbyterian church at that time. If you are interested, google his name, and click on the wholesome words.org for more interesting tidbits.\n\nMay your week be blessed and insightful.\n\n10/01/23 – Worship\n\nHis Mercy is More\n\nLiving Hope\n\nHymn #497 “I Need Thee, Precious Jesus”\n\nHymn #307 “Nothing but the Blood”\n\nThis week’s sermon continues in Mark 1. Be sure to read verses 40-45. This is the story of the leper—who did not obey Jesus- in a sense.\n\nOur two Praise hymns are familiar to us. “Living Hope” and “His Mercy is More”. My thoughts on Living Hope: why does it a sense of desperation to drive us to our Lord? Yet, we are like that leper, so desperate that he would approach Jesus and ask for healing, ‘if you will’. And how kind that He answered, ‘I will’. The lyrics of this song bring out the fact that He breaks every chain.\n\nThe second is, “His Mercy is More”. He is stronger than darkness ( sin and Satan), and His mercy (not getting what we deserve) is more than our sins. And he is omniscient, patient and a true and perfect sacrifice.\n\nHymn # 497, was written in 1855 by Frederick Whitfield. “I Need Thee, Precious Jesus” is his most widely known hymn. He was born in Shropshire, England and serve as a vicar or curate in 5 different parishes.\n\nRobert Lowry, born in Philadelphia in 1826, has a very dynamic biography. I would encourage you to google: Robert Lowry, and click on the hymnary.org site. he joined the baptist church at age 17, then felt the call to ministry at age 22. He graduated at age 28 with the highest honors in his class. His biography is extensive, but very interesting. Oh, almost forgot: his hymn we are singing is #307, “Nothing But the Blood of Jesus”. What a great hymn to carry us into the rest of our Sabboth and the whole week as well!\n\n9/24/23 – Sunday Worship with Communion\n\nWonderful Merciful Savior\n\nHe Will Hold Me Fast\n\nHymn #634 “Sweet Hour of Prayer”\n\nHymn #179 “Hallelujah! Thine the Glory”\n\nHello brothers and Sisters in Christ- it has been a wild and crazy week! Nothing has been bad, except it seems as if my 24 hours have been drastically shortened- or maybe just trying to cram more stuff into each hour!\n\nThat being said, there will not be my usual MUSIC NOTES this week.\n\nThe praise hymns are familiar. And the hymns should be also. If you feel adventurous, you can go on Google or YouTube for information.\n\nHopefully next week , “We will return to our regularly scheduled broadcast”.\n\n9/17/23 – Sunday Service\n\nPraise His Name\n\nWe Will Feast in the House of Zion\n\nHymn #173 “Praise Him! Praise Him!”\n\nHymn #164 “O for a Thousand Tongues to Sing”\n\nEver have that feeling of Deja vu? Well, this is sort of one of those times. We are going to hear pastor David give his insight of Mark 1:21-34. Bryant did an EXCELLENT ( this word is featured in hymn #174 today) job sharing more on Ephesians last week.\n\nAnyway, our praise hymn, “Praise His Name”, will be sung again this week. And, again, look for all the references to nature and how it , too, praises our great Creator.\n\nWe are also singing the praise hymn by the Getty’s, “We Will Feast in the House of Zion”. This is a very encouraging hymn, as we look to that future time of weeping no more. Some in our midst knew Pastor Thomas Wenger Jr, who suddenly went to be with our Triune God this week. We can be comforted, as well as those in our congregation who too have lost loved ones, that we all will feast- and weep no more!\n\nHymn #173, “Praise Him! Praise Him!” Is one of the many hymns by fanny Crosby. Let me ask: What is the greatest thing in your life? Now, think about this…’His greatness exceeds our ability to praise Him’! While you sing this hymn, also ponder all the descriptions applied to Jesus. How many do you find?\n\nHymn 164, “O for a Thousand Tongues to Sing”. Charles Wesley wrote this to commemorate the anniversary of his conversion. He was inspired by a Moravian who stated that if he had 1,000 tongues, he would praise the Lord with all of them! May we all have that thought as we sing praises to our great God and Savior.\n\n9/10/23 – Sunday Service\n\nPraise His Name\n\nGod of Wonders\n\nHymn #170 “Fairest Lord Jesus”\n\nHymn #195 “Joy to the World! The Lord Is Come”\n\nHave you ever looked at how all the gears in a watch work together? Well, this week, all 4 songs perfectly mesh together , not only with each other, but also with the sermon scripture! Read Mark 1: 21-34, before Sunday. Awe-some!\n\nOur two praise hymns, “Praise His Name” and , “God of Wonders” echo each other in their content. The first, may be new to you, but as you sing it, look for all the aspects of nature acknowledge God’s greatness. If you have time, read Psalm 148 from which came the inspiration for Sovereign Grace to compose this piece.\n\nAbout 8 years ago, Paul Baloche wrote “God of Wonders”. This , too, focuses of God’s handiwork. ( If you are able, go to YouTube and key in:” Cosmic Eye” , if a picture of a lady laying in the grass comes up, you have found the right one! I hope to share this with my Middle school class on Sunday as well)\n\nHymn #170, “Fairest Lord Jesus” is referred to as the ‘Crisader’s Hymn’, although probably NOT sung during the Crusades. More likely, it was sung by the followers of John Hus ( Hussite’s) in the 1400s. This hymn also mimics Psalm 148.\n\nFinally, have you ever REALY looked at hymn #195, “Joy to the World”? There is nothing in the lyrics that focuses on Christ’s birth! It is based on Psalm 98:7-9, which also does NOT mention His birth, but on His return in judgement.\n\nSince the sermon looks at Mark 1:21-34, I wanted to learn more about Capernaum (Nahum’s village). It was a fishing village along the Sea of Galilee. It’s population was approx. 1,500. Excavators found 2 synagogues, one above the other. It is believed to be the birth place of Peter.\n\nHave a Blessed Sabbath\n\n9/3/23 Labor Day weekend\n\nRejoice\n\nThe Power of the Cross\n\nHymn #442 “Arise, O God”\n\nHymn #441 “Jesus Shall Reign”\n\nThis Sunday’s lesson will focus on John 6: 27-29. (Believe in Him who God sent)\n\nOur two praise hymns are both by the Getty’s. They are: “Rejoice” and “Power of the Cross”. When we look at the lyrics of both, they allow us to soberly see what Christ did for us at Calvary- and then sing a joyous reminder to PRAISE the Lord for all he has done.\n\nHymn #442, was composed by William Hurn in 1813 ( later modernized in 1961). He was born in Norfolk, England, and served as a curate ( assistant to the vicar) at various areas. he then became a Vicar ( parish priest) for about 32 years. During this time, he wrote over 400 hymns. He then held a pastorate for 6 years until his death.\n\nIsaac Watts, wrote hymn #441, “Jesus Shall Reign”, which is based on Psalm 72. This precocious man began studying Latin at age 4, and wrote verses at age 7! At 16, he attended the Academt of Reverend Thomas Rowe, an Independent minister. In 1719, Watts accepted an invitation to reside at the home of Sir Thomas Abney, which was very beneficial due to his poor health. Many of his hymns were written to be sung following his sermon so as to augment what he was preaching.\n\nPlease take a few moments to read our lesson ( John 6:27-29), then see how it relates to all four hymns on Sunday.\n\n8/27/23 – Worship & Communion\n\nIn Christ Alone\n\nTurn Your Eyes\n\nHymn #402 “Abide with Me: Fast Falls the Eventide”\n\nHymn #353 “I Love Thy Kingdom, Lord”\n\nSunday we welcome Bryant back to the pulpit, after a relaxing week off. Please be sure to look at his chosen text: Ephesians 4: 1-6. Here are the key words in that passage: humble, gentle, patient, loving. Also: ONE : body, Spirit, hope, Lord, faith, baptism. God & Father, who is : over, through and in all.\n\nOur praise hymns are very familiar to us, so I’m not going to spend time on them. They have beautifully written lyrics. “Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus” ( based on Helen Lemmel’s 1922 hymn) and, “In Christ Alone”, by the Getty’s.\n\nHymn # 402, “Abide with Me”, cas composed by Henry F. Leyte in 1847. He coined the phrase, “Better to wear out than rust out”. And he wore out at age 54, from asthma and tuberculosis. This hymn is based on the request by the 2 men on the road to Emmaus. They asked Jesus to abide with them ( Luke 24:29). Also, look at the 4th verse, this reflects his thoughts as he knew he was going to die shortly.\n\n“I Love Thy Kingdom, Lord” (#353), was composed by Timothy Dwight. He could read Latin at age 6, graduated from Yale at 17, then later became the. President of that college after serving as chaplain for the Army in 1777. When he became Yale’s president in 1795, there may have only been 5 professing Christians on campus. With God’s help and Dwight’s enthusiasm, there was a revival on campus, and he wrote this hymn during that time. This is the earliest American hymn that is still in use today. He truly followed in his grandfather’s footsteps: Jonathan Edwards!\n\n8/20/23 – Worship\n\nArise, My Soul, Arise\n\nBefore the Throne of God Above\n\nHymn #65 “Before Jehovah’s Awesome Throne”\n\nHymn #591 “Jesus Calls Us”\n\nOur worship committe have picked some great music this week! Yes, I know, they always do, but these selections really make me excited! Please be sure to read Mark 1: 14-20, so you too can see how well these songs exemplify the lesson.\n\n“Arise, My Soul, Arise” has been sung here over at least 15 years. The original was a hymn by Charles Wesley (#305 in our Hymnal). Kevin Twit, originally from Timonium Presbyterian, modified the tune, and added a chorus where the women echo the men.\n\n“Before the Throne of God Above” is another reworked hymn from the past. Charitie Lee Bancroft wrote the original in 1863, but it did not appear in hymnals until 1997. Charitie did not have any tune, only the verses.\n\nDid you know that John Calvin, while only using the Psalms to sing to, used well known , local tunes to place with the lyrics? Ms Bancroft may have done the same thing, so that each congregation could sing it to their own familiar tune, thus not needing a hymnal.\n\nHymn #591, “Jesus Calls Us “ was written by Cecil ( a woman) Alexander. She and her husband served the very poor ares of Northern Ireland in the 1800’s. While she usually wrote songs for children ( # 120 & 225), this hymn was intended for adults. Her husband asked her to write a hymn that would go along with his sermon on the Calling of Andrew. Mark 1: 15,16.\n\nIsaac Watts wrote hymn # 65. The original title used the word, ‘Awful’, but our hymnal uses ‘Awesome’. Is there a difference? Awful, or awful , means ‘full of awe’. Today’s meaning and useage of ‘awesome’ usually signifies a different tone (awesome, dude). Spurgeon once led a congregation of nearly 10,00 in singing this hymn- with the harmonies enveloping the people in praise ( now that is awesome !). It was commented that the swelling of the voices was reflective of heaven when we will raise our voices in praise. ( John Calvin wanted the congregation to join in singing- something that wasn’t done in the Catholic or Anglican churches)\n\n8/13//23 – Worshp\n\nJesus Messiah\n\nChrist, the True and Better\n\nHymn #310 “Rejoice, the Lord Is King”\n\nHymn #654 “O Jesus, I Have Promised”\n\nWell, I’ve had a crazy, even though good, week. How about you? Have you looked for God’s hand in what is going on in your life? Well, let’s turn our hearts and minds back to all that God is teaching us.\n\nThis Sunday, we will look at Mark 1:9-13. I guess you could say that this passage is the ‘Cliff’s Notes” version from the book of Luke.\n\nOur first praise song is Chris Tomlin’s “Jesus , Messiah”. As you sing these words, see how it displays Christ’s life and purpose very succinctly.\n\nThe Getty’s hymn, “Christ, the True and Better” , walk us through the Old Testament stories. They beautifully compare Christ, and His purpose, to Adam, Isaac, Moses and David.\n\nHymn #310, “Rejoice, the Lord is King”, was composed by Charles Wesley. This hymn reflects Paul’s letter to the Philippians. He was in prison, in Rome. This was during the time of Nero’s reign ( not a good time to be a Christian). Each stanza focuses on different aspects: adoration, thanksgiving and exultation.\n\nJohn Ernest Bode, was serving in the parish of Castle Camps, near Cambridge, England. This hymn was written for his daughter and two sons who were being Confirmed. originally, the 1st line uses the term,’we’, because they were being confirmed together. Later it was changed to ‘I’. May these words be also yours as we close our worship service.\n\n8/6/23 – Worship\n\nYour Words are Wonderful\n\nBehold Him\n\nHymn #196 “Come, Thou Long-Expected Jesus”\n\nHymn #165 “Ye Servants of God, Your Master Proclaim”\n\nAs David takes us into the study of Mark 1:1-8, be sure to see how his sermon and the four hymns all reflect on God’s Word.\n\nOur two praise hymns are, “Behold Him” and “Your Words are Wonderful”. The first is very prayerful in style, but also notice the use of opposites when we look to Christ. The second hymn is in a more contemporary style, but it is based on Psalm 119. (“Taste and see that the Lord is good”, Ps 34:8)\n\nThe two more classical hymns , # 196 and #165, are both composed by Charles Wesley, the lesser known brother of John. Yet, Charles composed over 8,000 hymns. The Wesley brothers, while acknowledging that the Anglican Church WAS orthodox, and the people sang straight from scripture, wanted the people to think about what they were singing. Did it mean anything to them? They wanted the people to meet Christ personally as well as historically. “Come, Thou Long Expected Jesus” is one of 18 Christmas hymns that Charles wrote.\n\n“Ye Servants of God”,was composed during a time when the Methodists were being persecuted in England. The Wesley’s published a small hymn book to offer encouragement. In fact, this song was to be ‘sung in a tumult’. An omitted stanza reads: ‘Men, devils engage, the billows arise and horribly rage, and threaten the skies, their fury shall never our steadfastness shock, the weakest believer is built on a rock’\n\n7/30/23 – Communion\n\nRejoice\n\nChrist Our Hope in Love and Death\n\nHymn #100 “Holy, Holy, Holy!”\n\nHymn #55 “To God Be the Glory”\n\nI wandered a little from the actual praise song, “Christ Our Hope in Life and Death”. But before I go off track, see that in the 3 verses, some phrases are repeated: ‘Christ Alone’, ‘God is Good’, and , ‘Christ he lives”. We know that whenever a phrase is repeated in Scripture, we need to make special note of it.\n\nBut look at the second line in the chorus…”Our hope springs eternal”. Have you heard that phrase before? Did yoou know that it is from a poem by Alexander Poe, “An Essay on Man”? John Milton picked up that theme of optimism in his “Paradise Lost” work, and later was satirized in “Candide” by Voltaire.\n\nWe are also repeating our new praise hymn from last week: “Rejoice”. Both of these modern hymns were composed with the Gettys.\n\nHymn 100: “Holy, Holy, Holy” was written by Reginald Heber while a parish priest in England. he wanted his congregation to not only sing from the metrical Psalter, but also to sing hymns by Newton and Cowper. Alfred Lord Tennyson called this one of the world’s greatest hymns. The tune, Nicaea’ is named after the Council of NICEA in 325, that among other doctrines, affirmed the doctrine of the Trinity.\n\nWe all love Fanny Crosby’s story of being blind , yet composing ,any wonderful hymns….on average, 1 a day! Hymn #55 is no exception, “To God Be The Glory”. You can’t help but want to sing it boldly.\n\nShe commented about her blindness,” Darkness may throw a shadow over my outer vision, but there is no cloud that can keep the sunlight of hope from a trustful soul” .\n\n7/23/23\n\nRejoice\n\nKing of Kings\n\nHymn #647 “How Sweet the Name of Jesus Sounds”\n\nHymn #345 “Glorious Things of Thee Are Spoken“\n\nBe sure to read Ephesians 3:1-13, so you can see how the various hymns reflect these verses.\n\n“Rejoice”, by the Getty’s and others, is a relatively new song from last year. The Getty’s seek to create hymns that are energetic, full of joy and yet rich in scripture. They went to the Anglican Book of prayer for inspiration. As a ‘cross reference’ check out Philippians 4:6.\n\nHillsongs, while under scrutiny of its staff, has published many wonderful songs. “King of Kings”, is one of them. We have sung this prayerful hymn in the past, and the lyrics are very compelling.\n\nOur two hymns for our Trinity Hymnal are both by John Newton. While his most recognizable hymn is “Amazing Grace”, these two, # 647 and #345 probably would come in 2nd and 3rd.\n\n“How Sweet the ame of Jesus Sounds” is based on Song of Solomon 1:3. Newton worked with William Cowper to publish their works in “Olney Hymns”. Newton contributed more than 200 to this work. If you would like to hear a more modern version, check out Indelible Grace’s album, Pilgrim Days. YouTube has it on their site.\n\n“Glorious Things of Thee are Spoken” is based on Psalm 87:13 and Isaiah 33:20-21. The tune was composed by Frank Josef Haydyn, known as ‘Austria”, but is actually notated as No.62 in C Major, or, Emperor. “Stonewall” Jackson loved this hymn, and even sang it to waken his troops.\n\n7/9/23\n\nMajesty\n\nHow Deep the Father’s Love For Us\n\nHymn #254 “Alas! and Did My Savior Bleed”\n\nHymn #261 “What Wondrous Love Is This”\n\nWhat an amazing and busy week we’ve had! Celebrated our nations’ 247th year as a country. Praised and sang a brother in Christ to his wonderful new home. Now , ready to delve into Ephesians 2. And don’t forget, we have a week of exciting VBS!\n\nOur first praise hymn is one that, if you have never heard it before, should inspire and raise our heats to God! Written in 1978, made famous by Sandi Patti, and composed by Jack Hayford. Mr Hayford was a Pentecostal minister who wrote over 600 songs and hymns, and was much involved with Promise Keepers. he passed away in January of this year.\n\nOur second praise hymn, “How Deep the Father’s Love for Us”, is familiar to us. Written by Stuart Townend. Please check out his site: stuarttownend.co.uk, for more insight. He writes: “what did it cost the Father to give up his beloved son to a torturous death on a cross? And what was my part in it?”\n\n“Alas and Did My Savior Bleed” was written by Isaac Watts. But ‘the rest of the story’ points to a blind woman, over 100 years later , who surrendered her life to Christ- Fanny Crosby!\n\nWe are used to hearing music in an 8 tone scale, but hymn 261 is done in a 6 tone scale. “What Wondrous Love is This?” Is listed as a spiritual, or folk tune that originated in the Appalachian area. This different scale lends a mournful affect- perfect for the lyrics.\n\n7/2/23\n\nAmazing Grace (My Chains are gone)\n\nIt was Finished Upon That Cross\n\nHymn #308 “Jesus Paid It All”\n\nHymn #358 “For All the Saints”\n\nBe sure to read Ephesians 1:15-23 in preparation of Bryant’s message. And also read Psalm 18:1-3.\n\nThis week’s music should be familiar to the majority of us. We have sung, “Amazing Grace, (My Chains are Gone)”, as well as “It was Finished Upon That Cross”. You should be sensing a theme here. Look fo that e nuances between these praise songs and the Message.\n\nHymn 308, “Jesus Paid it All” was also known as ‘ I Hear the Savior Say’. This hymn was written by Elvira Hall in 1865. What is interesting is that she wrote it while attending New Lute of Zion Church, here in Baltimore. One hot summer Sunday, instead of listening to the Pastor pray ( see? You are not alone), she wrote the lyrics on the fly leaf of the hymnal. Later, she went to show her poem to the pastor, who told her to talk with the organist, as he had just written some music. Well, God DOES work in mysterious ways, because both the word and music fit very well together!. When she passed away, she was interred at Green Mount Cemetary in Baltimore.\n\nWilliam Walsham How ( 1823-1897) was an Anglican Bishop. He wrote this hymn for All Saint’s Day ( kids, this is the day after Halloween). It focuses on Hebrews 11- the ‘Faith Chapter’. This is not his only contribution to our hymnal- we also list 6 other hymns. Take a moment to look at his other hymns: 140,239,394,432,492 and 668.\n\nHave a blessed Fourth of July, remembering for a moment how much God has blessed us.\n\n6/25/23\n\nTurn Your Eyes\n\nI Will Wait For You\n\nHymn #101 “Come, Thou Almighty King”\n\nHymn #660 “O God beyond All Praising”\n\nI’m not sure how much information I’m going to give about the 4 songs, as 3 are very familiar, and the last hymn, is totally unknown to me.\n\nI guess the very place to begin is with the sermon Scripture. Bryant is continuing in Ephesians. Looking at chapter 1, verses 11-14, I would like you to look over that and see how many beautiful references are made about our Triune God. I counted 8.\n\nThe next task is to keep those attributes mentioned in Ephesians, and see how they are reflected in the two praise hymns. They are, “Turn Your Eye” and “I Will Wait For You”.\n\nDo you see any references to: our inheritance, the counsel of His will, praise, word of truth, sealed with the promise, and praise to his glory? It may not be verbatim, but look for synonymous intent.\n\nHymn 101, “Come Thou Almughty King” was anonymously written, but has been attributed to Charles Wesley. This hymn is often sung on Trinity Sunday ( which was June 4th). Each verse focuses on one person of the Trinity.\n\nNow, for the last hymn, “O God Beyond All Praising”, is a new hymn for me. And it may be for most people, as it was written in 1982. The lyrics are simple, and only 2 stanzas. If you check it out on YouTube, it is sung by a formal choir with multiple instruments. What is interesting , is that the melody IS of a more classical tone. Gustav Holst composed this musician 1918, for part of his better known works, “The Planets”. The author of the lyrics is, Michael Perry. Only one person by that name shows up on Google, and he is the correct age, but this hymn is not found on his info, I will assume he IS the author, and I even messaged him to verify, but if he isn’t, I will clarify ext week.\n\n6/18/23 – Communion / Father’s Day\n\nYour Words are Wonderful\n\nHis Mercy is More\n\nHymn #599 “Savior, like a Shepherd Lead Us”\n\nHymn #642 “Be Thou My Vision”\n\nWhat a busy week! General Assembly has completed another year, it is Father’s Day, and most significant, it is Communion Sunday.\n\nDid you know that the first time in America to celebrate fathers, was in 1908, in West Virginia, to honor the tragic deaths of 362 men killed in a mining explosion? About 2 years later, a woman in Spokane, Washington tried to make it a national day of honor. But it was not until 1972 that it actually became a federal holiday. In other countries, fathers are honored on St Joseph’s Day on March 19th.\n\nThe scripture to focus on is Luke 1:50, (…His mercy is for those who fear him from generation to generation..”\n\nWith that verse in mind, as you sing our four songs on Sunday, see how many times this verse is reflected in the individual lyrics. The two praise songs are, “Your Words are Wonderful” and “His Mercy is More”.\n\nHymn 599, “Savior, Like a Shepherd Lead us” is credited to Dorothy Thrupp. She had published a book of hymns and poems, but this song did not bear her usual initials. It focuses on phrases from Psalm 23, John 10, and I Cor 6:20.\n\n“Be Thou My Vision” is an Irish hymn from the 8th Century. From 500-700 AD, there was a great missionary emphasis in Ireland. They traveled from Scotland to Switzerland. One of the most famous was Columba. Look for the many references to the titles for God in this hymn. I found about 9.\n\n6/11/23\n\nYour Words are Wonderful (Psalm 119)\n\nYet Not I, But Through Christ In Me\n\nHymn #172 “Let Us Love and Sing and Wonder”\n\nHymn #457 “Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing”\n\nAs Bryant walks us through Ephesians, be sure to take a few moments to finish reading the first chapter (last Sunday we read up to verse 6). Our music this week is both new and old. I’m only familiar with 1 praise and 1 hymn this week…so we will all gain some knowledge.\n\n“Your Words are Wonderful”, by Sovereign Grace Music, is based on Psalm 119 ( you know, that Psalm of 176 verses!). But for now, take time to read over the first 16 verses. How are we blessed? What is our responsibility as we walk with our Father? Can you claim the promises that this song lays out?\n\nCityAlight gave us “Yet Not I , But Through Christ in Me”. They remind us that unless Christ is IN ME, we are lost. He is our only hope. Again, see how this song meshes beautifully with Ephesians 1: 6-14. How many times is that little, but mighty, word, “IN” placed in these verses?\n\nI am not familiar with hymn #172, “Let Us Love and Sing and Wonder”. John Newton of “Amazing Grace” renown, wrote this hymn later in his life. There are many theological points throughout this hymn. Pay special attention to verse 4, second line…”when through grace in Christ our trust is, justice smiles and asks no more.” Grace and Justice, it has been said, should never share a sentence…but they perfectly work here.\n\nHymn 457, “Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing” was written by. Robert Robertson. He grew up quite rebellious to the Christian life, but was converted at a George Whitefield meeting. This hymn was written by him when he was 23 and serving at the Calvinistic Methodist Church in Norfolk, England. ( personal view- I would think that Calvinistic and Methodist would NOT blend together…but it did).\n\n6/4/23\n\nMy Worth is Not in What I own\n\nCome Behold The Wondrous Mystery\n\nHymn #521 “My Hope Is Built on Nothing Less”\n\nHymn #699 “Like a River Glorious”\n\nAfter a very busy week or more, I am now ready to go back to a routine! Aren’t we peculiar creatures, that on one hand we complain about the “same old, same old”, but then relish those times of predictability?\n\nOur music, in one sense is familiar, but it is also refreshing as we see how the lyrics work themselves into the sermon Scriptures.\n\nThe praise songs are from the music family of the Getty’s, including Matt Papa and Matt Boswell. The first song is, “My Worth is Not in What I Own”. How absolutely true is that for believers? The Getty’s remind us in the lyrics that we need to look at our ‘worth’ and our ‘unworthiness’. Very humbling.\n\nMatt Papa, in “Come, Behold the Wondrous Mystery” has us ponder the true meaning and cost of what Christ did for us. I have been listening to Alastair Begg’s ‘Truth for Life ‘ series, and this week he was looking at I Timothy 3: 14-16, which speaks of a great mystery, too. Take a look at it later today.\n\n“My Hope is Built on Nothing Less”, hymn #521, is full of Edward Mote’s deep theological view and his personal experiences. You know, we should never dismiss someone as lost. Mote’s parents ran a tavern in London, and let him play in the streets on Sundays. When he was apprenticed to a cabinetmaker ( do you see irony here?), that was when he became a believer. Later , he served as a Baptist minister. But while still working his trade, he wrote this hymn on his way to work and while at task.\n\nHymn #699, “Like a River Glorious” is based on Isaiah 26:3. Frances Havergal, one of our more prolific female composers. At the Gathering, this week, we learned that most references to ‘Sea’ is usually negative and threatening. Yet, ‘River’ is usually one imaging peace and tranquility.\n\nIf we are alert to what our lives are experiencing daily, we should be able to see God’s hand in those events. Have a blessed week\n\n5/28/23 – Rememberance Sunday\n\nChrist is Mine Forevermore\n\nWonderful Merciful Savior\n\nHymn #302 “Come, Christians, Join to Sing”\n\nHymn #691 “It Is Well with My Soul”\n\nI don’t know about you, but the songs and hymns today are some of my personal favorites.\n\nFirst Praise song is from the group, CityAlight. “Christ is Mine Forevermore”. This is about 6 years old, and I’m sure most of you have heard is sung here. The verses take us through many human emotions: ‘hope in my Redeemer’; ‘tears in sorrow’; ‘peace from heaven’ and, ‘days here as a stranger’. But we can be assured that CHRIST is mine – Forevermore!\n\nOur next praise song should be recognized by almost everyone, as it was sung by the group Selah, about 11 years ago, and was very popular. “Wonderful, Merciful Savior” has a peaceful flow to the melody, and the lyrics are full of encouragement.\n\nHymn 302, “Come Christian, Join to Sing” was originally written for children, as the first title was ,’Come Children…’ Adults loved it so much that the title was changed. Christian Bateman began as a Moravian, then on to Congregational churches in England and Scotland, before settling into the Church of England. Repeated words: Alleluia and Amen can be understood as – Praise the Lord, and, Truly, Truly.\n\n“It Is Well With My Soul” as an amazing backstory. Many of you may be familiar with it. Horacio Spafford and his wife lost a son to illness, just before the Great Chicago FIre, Spafford suffered financial disaster from the fire, as a businessman. When he heard that D.L. Moody was preaching in London, he sent his wife and 4 daughters on a ship, and he would join them shortly. In the middle of the Atlantic, their ship was struck by another, and in 12 minutes, their ship sank. All 4 daughters were lost. On Spafford’s voyage, he went to his cabin and composed this poem, especially ,”When sorrows like sea billows roll…It Is Well With My Soul”. Do you have the rock solid faith and trust he had? May we all!\n\nAsk me about our riverboat cruise 4 yours ago is you see me Sunday.\n\n5/21/23 – Communion / International Sunday\n\nOnly a Holy God (Solo el Santo Dios)\n\nLord, I Need You (Señor, Te Necesito)\n\nHymn #693 “Blessed Assurance”\n\nHymn #498 “Jesus! What a Friend for Sinners!”\n\nWhat an exciting Sunday! We are having our “International Sunday” to recognize our friends/students from ESOL. Our two Praise Hymns are offered in Spanish for those who wish to sing in that beautiful language.\n\nWe are also going to finish hearing about Jonah and his ‘attitude adjustment’.\n\nMr Beau Miller will preside over our Communion Table- what better way to look at what communion is to signify to the family of believers!\n\nCityAlight presents our first praise hymn, “Only a Holy God” (Solo el Santo Dios). Look for correlations between the lyrics and what God did for Jonah ( hint: not really obvious)\n\nMatt Maher composed “Lord , I Need You” ( Senor, el Necessito). It is a favorite of mine in its prayerful presentation, and flowing melody. Jonah really needed this praise song! The lyrics speak of ‘my righteousness’, and I had to Google the definition. It is a ‘quality of being morally right, or justifiable’. Now I understand how that word can be applied to me, where before, I had only thought of it being a quality reserved for God.\n\nHymn 693, “Blessed Assurance”, by Fanny Crosby has an interesting back story. Phoebe Knapp had written the melody, and brought it to Fanny. She listened to it 3 times before declaring that the words that came to her were, ‘blessed assurance, Jesus is mine’. Did you realize that Fanny wrote 8,000 hymns, used over 200 pen names, and averaged 3 hymns per week while she was under a publisher’s contract!?\n\nLast week we sang, “One Day He’s Coming” , by J. Wilbur Chapman. This Sunday we will sing another of his better known hymns, “Jesus! What a Friend for Sinners” (#498). Chapman held 6 pastorates within the Presbyterian church before going about as an evangelist. He was a contemporary of Moody as well as Billy Sunday.\n\n5/14/23 – Mother’s Day\n\nKing of Kings\n\nLiving Hope\n\nHymn #32, “Great Is Thy Faithfulness”\n\nHymn #498, “Jesus! What a Friend for Sinners!”\n\nFirst, may I wish all the mother’s a Happy Mother’s Day. And secondly, a joyous Welcome to our new members.\n\nBe sure to read First Thessalonians 5, to be ready for the message on Sunday. Reading this will help explain the ‘why’ for the music selections.\n\nOur two praise hymns are familiar to most of us. “King of Kings” is from Hillsongs, and it focuses on how the Law and prophets were fulfilled. I love thinking about how the angels were in AWE of the Resurrection.\n\nPhil Wickham wrote “Living Hope”. He writes lyrics so as to turn our hearts and minds toward God and His mercy.\n\nThomas Chisholm was a Methodist minister for only a year, when he had to resign due to health problems. he spent the rest of his life as an insurance agent. Hymn #32, “Great is Thy Faithfulness” is a familiar song written in 1923. Chisholm lived from 1866 to 1960. Be sure to spend time thinking about the 3rd verse.\n\nJ. Wilbur Chapman ( 1859-1918) was a Presbyterian evangelist. He also wrote another familiar hymn, “ Jesus! What a Friend for Sinners”, #498. In 1890, he accepted a call to Bethany Presbyterian Church. At the time, this church had the largest Sunday School in the WORLD! One wealthy man was also a member: John Wanamaker.\n\nHave a blessed Sabbath\n\nMay 7, 2023\n\nWe Will Feast in the House of Zion\n\nI Will Run to You\n\nHymn #585 “Take My Life, and Let It Be”\n\nHymn #706 “Jesus Lives, and so Shall I”\n\nBe sure to prepare for the music and the sermon by reading First Thessalonians,chapter 4. I was touched by verses 1,3,7,9 and 10, 11,12. What about you?\n\n“We Will Feast in the House of Zion” is from our friends, the Getty’s. If we look forward to meals for special events and holidays, how much more are we expectantly awaiting Heaven and the Lord’s Banquet? As you sing the lyrics, look for the references to hope and promise.\n\n“I Will Run to You” teaches us about running the spiritual race, led by the Spirit as we ourselves run to God. Are we training ourselves to run the race in our lives? No matter how burdened our hearts may be with trials and troubles- God Is There!\n\nHymn 585, “Take My Life” is an old favorite for many of us. Frances Havergal wrote this hymn while visiting in a home with 10 other people. Some wee unconverted, some were us rejoicing Christians. She prayed that God would turn the hearts of all there at that time- and He did! Can you see how this hymn reflects the sermon scripture? Christian Gellert wrote, “Jesus Lives, and So Shall I” , hymn # 706, to echo John 14:19. We are not only to live in a right relationship with God, but also with others in our daily lives.\n\nSo much to ponder, learn and share.\n\nApril 30, 2023\n\n10,000 Reasons\n\nLord, I Need You\n\nHymn #94 “How Firm a Foundation”\n\nHymn #431 “A Parting Hymn We Sing”\n\nToday being a Communion Sunday, let’s take special care to read the words of each of our songs and hymns. Let them speak to your heart as you worship.\n\nPraise hymn, “Lord, I Need You”, by Matt Maher, is prayerful and confessional. Four key words are : Confess ( to admit fault of a crime), Need ( require something that is essential), Grace ( unmerited gift of God) and Defense ( my plea to God for His mercy).\n\n“10,000 Reasons, Bless the Lord” is a very popular song. Again, study the key words in this song: Bless ( to invoke divine favor), Worship ( literally to bow in acknowledgement that God is Sovereign. As you sing the second verse, make it your prayer to the Lord. According to Colossians 3:16, we are commanded to sing to the Lord as part of our worship.\n\nHymn #94, “How Firm a Foundation” was first found in Rippon’s Selection of Hymns” 1787. The melody , though, is a traditional American melody. John Rippon’s lived in England 1751- 1836, and was a Baptist preacher. He collected over 400 hymns for his ‘selections’.\n\n“A Parting Hymn We Sing”, #431, is in the section labeled: The Church, Lord’s Supper. Aaron Wolfe, 1858-1902, was born in New Jersey and attended Union Seminary.He was then licensed by the 3rd Presbytery of New York. During his lifetime, he was in charge of two school for young ladies ( Fla, and N.J.)\n\nSing because it means something to you, and not worry if you miss a note, this is your offering to God ( even if it seems no more worthy than the widow’s mite).\n\nApril 23, 2023\n\nDeath Was Arrested\n\nTurn Your Eyes\n\nHymn #442 “Arise, O God”\n\nHymn “Speak, O Lord”\n\nBe sure to preview the sermon scripture of I Thessalonians 2. Paul and his friends suffered in Philippi, but they needed to please God and not man. They shared not only themselves, but more importantly, the Gospel. He reminds his readers that they were his glory and joy. May we too be so.\n\nOur two Praise songs are familiar. “Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus” is that beautiful rewording of the classic hymn. It takes us musically thru the last days of Christ- both His Crucifixion and Ressurection. ( By the way, have you taken advantage of this month’s free audio book on Resurrection Hope?)\n\n“Death was Arrested” is the second praise song. To ‘arrest’ means to legally seize and take into custody; to stop or check the progress of something. Do you think this is a good use of that word in this song? be sure to look for the agonizing phrases, the promises and the aspect of joy in this song.\n\nHymn 442, “Arise ,O God” was written by William Huron (1754-1829). There is not much about him in my sources, but he was a Bishop in Norfolk ( Eng.) and wrote over 400 poems and hymns. While I am familiar with the lyrics, our Trinity Hymnal has a different tune from the one I remember.\n\nFinally, Our last hymn is not in the Hymnal, but will be via PowerPoint. It is “Speak O Lord”, which we have sung as a praise song. This is a song that encourages us to feed on the Word, have Truth planted in us, to renew our minds and to seek to know God’s plans for us.\n\n( if you are in attendance on Sunday, please be sure to come to the table for the Strawberry Festival, to see how you can help)\n\nApril 16, 2023\n\nMay the People Praise You\n\nHe Will Keep You\n\nHymn #273 “Jesus Christ Is Risen Today”\n\nHymn #591 “Jesus Calls Us”\n\nI hope you all had a blessed Easter! Pastor David is preaching on I Thessalonians 1, a very uplifting scripture. And so it should be seeing what it means that Christ died for us and has welcomed us into the fellowship of faith.\n\nThe first praise song, “May The Peoples Praise You”, is a most uplifting tune by the Gettys. It exudes joy and love to our Lord for all He’s done. The melody will get your toes tapping and your hearts pulsing with joy.\n\n“He Will Keep You”, by Sovereign Grace, will remind us that He will always walk alongside with us. The tempo is much slower, offering us time to truly soak in the words of this song. For those with young children, this song would be good as a lullaby, sending our sweet ones into restful sleep.\n\nHymn 591, “Jesus Calls Us” was written by Cecil Frances Alexander. When you first look at the author’s name, you’d be surprised to realize it is a woman. She started writing poetry at age 9. She married William Alexander , a parish minister in rural Northern Ireland. Every day she would visit the homes, taking food, clothing and medical supplies. While she loved to write hymns for children: “All Things Bright and Beautiful”, “Once in Royal David’s City”; this hymn was intended for adults. ( taken from One Year Book of Hymns)\n\n“Jesus Christ is Risen Today”, is not the one most folks think it is. The title is often confused with Charles Wesley’s hymn, “Christ the Lord is Risen Today” (277). This one is hymn # 273. Originally, it was from a Medieval text. The first verse has an unknown author, stanzas 2 & 3 are from a Psalter of 1740, BUT, Charles Wesley wrote the 4th stanza!\n\nApril 9, 2023 – 11:00 am Easter Service\n\nMan of Sorrows\n\nChrist Our Hope in Life and Death\n\nHymn #286 “Worship Christ the Risen King”\n\nHymn #277 “Christ the Lord is Risen Today”\n\nApril 9, 2023 – Easter Sunrise Service\n\nIt was Finished Upon That Cross\n\nResurrection Hymn\n\nHymn #276 “Up from the Grave He Arose”\n\nHymn #274 “Thine Be the Glory”\n\nApril 7, 2023 – Good Friday\n\nYour Will Be Done\n\nThe Power of the Cross\n\nHymn #257 “Stricken, Smitten, and Afflicted”\n\nHymn #247 “O Sacred Head, Now Wounded”\n\nHymn #261 “What Wondrous Love Is This“\n\n4//2/23 – Palm Sunday\n\nI am going to keep this week’s article as short as possible, but I have a great desire to go off on many tangents. In short, please pray for all who have been affected by many tragedies this week: senseless shootings, weather conditions, fire, and much more. May the music chosen for this week give us comfort and encouragement.\n\nJesus is Alive\n\nIn Christ Alone\n\nHymn #235 – “All Glory, Laud, and Honor”\n\nHymn #295 – “Crown Him With Many Crowns”\n\nWe are learning a new praise song, “Jesus Is Alive”. CityAlive and the Getty’s have performed this. As you learn the tune, pay attention to the key words: HOPE, The KING, Perfect LOVE, and DEATH is Undone.\n\nNext, we are singing the song by the Getty’s; “In Christ Alone”. May this song give us comfort as we focus on the lyrics: HOPE is found, GIFT of Love, No GUILT in Life, nor FEAR in Death…..I’ll STAND.\n\nTheodulf was made a Bishop of orleans by King Charlemagne. He lived from 750- 821. After Charlemagne’s death, Theodulf was exiled on charges of conspiracy. While confined, he wrote this hymn, which later became a processional hymn for Palm Sunday, almost worldwide. “All Glory, Laud and Honor” hymn # 235.\n\n“Crown Him with Many Crowns”, #295, is, shall we say, a collaboration between a Catholic and an Anglican. Matthew Bridges ( 1800-1894), Roman Catholic, wrote the original hymn. Thirty years later, Godfrey Thring, and Anglican, felt that more verses should be added. So with approval from Bridges, who never actually met Thring, this hymn was published.\n\nHAVE YOU READ YOUR HYMNAL LATELY?\n\nThis is the last ‘class’ on our hymnal, but it’s sort of saving the best for last. Pages 896 to 943 offer us the ability to switch hymn tunes, find songs that match up with scripture and more.\n\nIf you look at hymn 235, lower right, these are numbers: 7.6.7.6.D. This means that the # of syllables are 7-6-7-6. Now turn to pages 896-899, and you’ll find other hymns with that same phrasing.\n\nIf you want to sing a hymn relating to a certain scripture, look at pages 900 to 903. And at the top , right of hymn 235, there is a heading of ‘Jesus Christ”- and the Topics section will help you find other hymns that correspond.\n\nLastly, if you are old, like me, and you cannot remember the title of a hymn, but know the first line, check out pages 936- 943 for First Lines and Titles.\n\nLast week , we sang James Ward’s rendition of “Rock of Ages”, but did you know he slightly altered the original tune and wrote hymn # 287, “Morning Sun”? Check it out- because music is a gift from and to God.\n\n3/26/23 –\n\nBehold Him\n\nWhat He’s Done\n\nHymn #501 “Just As I Am, without One Plea”\n\nHymn #500 “Rock of Ages, Cleft for Me”\n\nOnly 2 more weeks and we can proclaim, “He is risen indeed!”. Our music this week is taking us further into this most blessed season. And like the season of Spring, we will sing some old songs, some familiar songs, some old songs with new tunes and also just plain new music. But all carry the same message.\n\nIn our praise music section, we are singing, “Behold Him” which should be familiar, and “What He’s Done”, a new song. When you sing “Behold Him”, be sure to look for the opposites. Lion and Lamb. Sinners and Saints. Buried death and rose to life. And there are more.\n\n“What He’s Done” is by Passion music, and this song is new to me. This song, look for all the references dealing with Christ’s purposes for the cross.\n\nCharlotte Elliott ( 1789-1871) was a gifted artist and writer of verse, but a serious illness caused her to sink into a deep depression. A minister asked her if she had peace with God, a question she highly resented. Later, in apologizing, she told him that she needed to clean up some things in her life. He then told her to “come just as you are”. Fourteen years later she wrote the hymn with that title ( #501).\n\nAugustus Toplady (1740-1778)was converted by a Methodist evangelist. But Toplady disagreed greatly with the Wesley Arminianism. They disagreed with each other up to Toplady’s death at age 38. “Rock of Ages, was composed for a magazine article. Yet, two years before succumbing to TB, Toplady published his own hymnal- with Wesley’s hymn, “Jesus, Lover of My Soul” was placed next to his own hymn. Hymn 500 is a new tune, written by James Ward (1984).\n\nHAVE YOU READ YOUR HYMNAL LATELY?\n\nStarting at page 888, you will find a section on Composers, Arrangers and Sources of Tunes. Here you can see who wrote. a tune, or if it is a folk tune, Plainsong, a national melody, or from a Psalter.\n\nWhen you see, at the bottom , right corner of a hymn, such as #501, that something is in all capital letters, this is a specific tune, which you can find on pages 893-895.\n\n3/19/23\n\nCornerstone\n\nYour Will Be Done\n\nHymn #648 “My Jesus, I Love Thee”\n\nHymn #327 “One Day He’s Coming”\n\nWhile we are singing some wonderful songs, looking at the sermon topic and scripture, we are going to also have a wonderful sermon!\n\n“Cornerstone” is a familiar praise hymn with us. It is a Hillsong piece from 2012. As I listened to it the chords between the verses reminded me of a construction scene. So, i of cours, had to check the definition of ‘cornerstone’. It is a stone upon which all other stones line up against and are supported by. This is why Christ referred to himself as ‘the chief cornerstone”. Kids, see if you can find our churches 2 cornerstones ( get your parents to help).\n\nCityAlight composed, “Your Will Be Done” during the time we were sequestered during COVID. As you sing this song, see the references about Jesus in The Garden as he neared his last days on earth. may you be encouraged with the lyrics and the gentle melody.\n\nHymn # 648, “My Jesus, I Love Thee”, was a poem by William Featherstone. he wrote this when he was. 16, and had just become a Christian. He died when he was 26, but God was not done with him yet. William sent this poem to his aunt in Los Angeles ( he lived in Montreal). She sent it to England where it was placed in the London Hymnal ( 1864). A Baptist minister in Boston saw it, didn’t like the tune, so composed the music himself, and as it is said: the rest is history!\n\n“One Day He’s Coming” was written by J. Wilbur Chapman, a Presbyterian evangelist in 1910 ( also hymn 498). He preached with D.L. Moody and was influential for Billy Sunday’s success.\n\nHAVE YOU READ YOUR HYMNAL LATELY?\n\nIn the rear of the hymnal, you will find the Psalter Readings ( various Psalms selected for responsive reading), then the Creeds ( Apostle and Nicene). You will also see the Westminster Confession of Faith and the Shorter Catechism. Both of these are a vital part of a believer’s reading ( even if you may not fully comprehend all of it)\n\nThe Indexes begin on page 881, with a list of the copywriter holders. This tells the congregation that the Trinity Hymnal has been given permission to print the music inside its cover.\n\nPages 883-887 list authors, translators and sources of the hymns. here you can look up Featherstone and Chapman to see what other hymns they have written that are in our hymnal.\n\n****** More Next Week*****\n\n3/12/2023\n\nHis Mercy is More\n\nHe Will Keep You\n\nHymn #461 “Not What My Hands Have Done”\n\nHymn #650 “I Will Sing of My Redeemer”\n\nFirst, I’d like to thank Sherie for playing a hymn I haven’t heard for many years, during the offeratory- “Jesus, Sweetest Name I Know” !\n\nThis week, the sermon is focusing on Redemption. For us ‘oldsters’, we may recall S & H Green Stamps, that when the booklet was filled, you could ‘redeem’ them for items equal to the points. The definition on Google says;”the act of regaining or gaining possession of something in exchange for payment, or clearing a debt.” Romans 3 gives us a much better redemption than this stamps.\n\n“His Mercy Is More”, by Matt Papa and Matt Boswell help us focus on what it cost our Lord to pay the cost for our sin. His mercy is stronger than darkness, He doesn’t remember our wrongs, His blood was the payment and His life was the cost.\n\nSovereign Grace’s, “He Will Keep You” is based on Psalm 121. If you are not familiar with this hymn, please listen to it on Google or YouTube. The tune is very quiet and soothing, with almost a lullaby effect. If you can’t actually hear the song, then please read Psalm 121\n\n“Not What My Hands Have Done”, by Horatius Bonar (#461), was written in 1861. One man commented about Bonar:”he was just like his hymns- not great, but tender, sweet and tranquil”.\n\nHymn #650, was written by Philip P. Bliss. He was a song leader for evangelist, Major Whittle in Chicago. He and his wife were killed in a train accident, and these words were found in his trunk. I hope to hear the echo in the chorus this Sunday!\n\nHAVE YOU READ YOUR HYMNAL LATELY?\n\nI hope you took a few minutes to read the Introduction last week. We are now ready to look at page 11: Symbols, Notations and Abbreviations. I suggest that you can look at Hymn #9 for almost all the different symbol. But it can be more meaningful , if you also look at this Sunday’s hymns (461 & 650). So now, when you sing a hymn, scan over the full page to glean ( and maybe ‘redeem’?) more information about the song we are singing.\n\nPages 12 and 13 can also be helpful for musicians who want to add an ‘amen’ or accompany with a stringed instrument.\n\n3/5/2023\n\nOn Jordan’s Stormy Banks\n\nLord , from Sorrows Deep I Call\n\nHymn 257 – “Stricken, Smitten and Afflicted”\n\nHymn 254 – “Alas, and Did My Savior Bleed”\n\nIs it really March? Must be, nature is gearing up for perhaps an early Spring. And, yet, in this Lenten season, we also need to soberly think about the reason Christ came- to die. Our music this week is very Solomon, sober, yet also inspiring toward worship.\n\n“On Jordan’s Stormy Banks”, was written by the Getty’s to a more Celtic sound, yet the lyrics are the same as the one written by Samuel Stennett in 1787. (YouTube has the Gaither’s singing the older version).When I hear the lyrics, my mind goes to the ending scenes of Pilgrim’s Progress 1 and 2.\n\nMatt Papa, who performs with the Getty’s, wrote, “Lord , from Sorrows Deep I Call’. This song is based on Psalm 42. I truly reminds us that our true home and worth are found in heaven and Christ.\n\nHymn 257, “Stricken, Smitten and Afflicted”, a familiar hymn for most of us, was composed by Thomas Kelly in 1804. He started out to become a lawyer, but a spiritual change had him take Holy Orders. But because his preaching style was more evangelical than the usual style, he was forbidden to preach. But we all know that that doesn’t stop the Holy Spirit- so he started his own church.\n\nIsaaac Watts, beside writing more than 800 hymns, wrote #254- “Alas, and Did My Savior Bleed” in 1707. He learned Latin at age 4, wrote verses at age 7, and entered the Academy os Rev. Thomas Rowe, and independent minister.\n\nHAVE YOU READ YOUR HYMNAL TODAY?\n\nThis week, take a look at the Table of Contents, there is much more to be gleaned from this book than just hymns.\n\nAfter the Contents page, there is a fascinating article known as the Preface. It helps answer such questions as: why a hymnal?what is the origin of this hymnal? Why are all these items in the hymnal- for what purposes? And lastly, look over the names on the committee- do any of them seem familiar? For me, I recognize Clooney, Kostyra.\n\nFinally, please read the Introduction ( pg 9 & 10). Do you see that YOU are important to the worship service and the singing of songs? You are!\n\n2/26/2023\n\nIn Christ Alone\n\nHe Will Keep You\n\nHymn #111 “This Is My Father’s World”\n\nHymn #447 “Christ for the World We Sing”\n\nOur praise hymns are both simple in tune and beautiful in words. The first is , “In Christ Alone”, by the Getty’s. We have sung this many times in the past. A new song, by Sovereign Grace Music, is, “He Will Keep You ( Psalm 121)” This is a familiar Psalm, and it has been composed to be encouraging and have an easy to follow melody.\n\nHymn #111, “This Is My Father’s World”, was written by Maltbie Babcock in 1901. He was a minister at 1st Presbyterian Church in Lockport, N.Y. Beside, pastoring the congregation, he was also a good athlete. Many times he would take a break and run to a hill overlooking Lake Ontario, then run down to a ravine populated with over 40 species of birds. On his way out to run, he would say, “I am going out to see my Father’s world”\n\n“Christ For the World We Sing”(447), was written by Samuel Wolcott in 1869. He did not start writing hymns and poetry until he was 56. Yet he wrote over 200 since that time! This hymn was inspired by a YMCA convention in Cleveland. The banner announcing the theme was, “Christ for the World and the World for Christ”.\n\nHAVE YOU READ YOUR. HYMNAL , LATELY?\n\nOur church has been blessed musically, in that we blend various music formats: new and old, projected on the wall, and in a hymnal. On physical benefit to having the lyrics projected on the wall, is that now we actually ‘raise’ our voices before the Lord, instead of singing to our feet.\n\nBut, have you really looked through the Trinity Hymnal lately? Have you truly read what is wishing the hardback covering? Well, for a few weeks, I want to focus on the various parts- front to back.\n\nJust past the Title page, we see that it was printed in 1990, by Great Commission Publications. This is our denomination’s publishing firm that also supplies our Children’s S.S. Material. And it tells us that all scripture in the hymnal is from the NIV Bible.\n\nThe Table of Contents is a good place to find out ‘what is in the hymnal’. You can see that the hymnal is much more than just the hymns.\n\nThis week, if you have a copy at home, or you have a chance to read it anytime you are at church, please read the PREFACE. This is an important ‘jumping off’ place to begin. Happy Reading!\n\n2/19/2023\n\nLiving Hope\n\nKing of Kings\n\nHymn #283 “Alleluia! Alleluia!”\n\n“Sing Hallelujah! Praise the Lord!”\n\nThis is the last in a series of looking at the 5 books within the book of Psalms. Pastor will be looking at Psalm 150. The key word is Hallelujah, or Alleluia. It is a very short Psalm, definitely not the length of Psalm 119! So please look at the verses and see how our 4 music selections echo and exemplify the Psalm.\n\nPhil Wickham, wrote “Living Hope”. The chorus states, “ Hallelujah , praise the one who set me free”. This well-written song describes just how far removed we are from our Triune God , yet He has given us, not just hope, but a living hope.\n\nHIllsongs prayerfully and quietly sings ,”King of Kings”. We are called to praise the Trinity- forevermore. Lift your voice up in prayer when you sing this beautiful song.\n\nHymn 283, “Alleluia! Alleluia!” Was penned by Christopher Wordsworth. Does his last name sound familiar? He was the nephew to the poet, William Wordsworth. Christopher lived from 1807 – 1885. He was a Greek scholar, yet had time to publish a hymnal of 117 original hymns. His main goal in writing hymns was to teach sound doctrine so then sould could be saved. This hymn is sung to one of my favorite hymn tunes: EBENEZER- which is the tune for “O the Deep, Deep, Love of Jesus”.\n\nFinally, the hymn, “Sing Hallelujah! Praise the Lord” is not found in our hymnal. John Swertner ( 1746-1813) wrote this hymn. He was born in Holland, and was a Moravian minister in England and Ireland. The Moravian church had its founding in the Czech Republic, as was John Hus. The tune is your typical, grandly written song, but the tune should be very easy to follow.\n\n2/12/2023\n\nBefore Sunday, if possible, be sure to read Psalm 107. This is the 1st Psalm in the 5th book . Take a few moments to really grasp the intent of this Psalm…and see on Sunday where pastor David takes us in this scripture.\n\nAmazing Grace (My Chains are gone)\n\nJesus Messiah\n\nHymn #4 “All Praise to God, Who Reigns Above”\n\nBoth praise hymns are by Christ Tomlin, and they are well written and include many scriptural texts. The first is, “Amazing Grace- My Chains Are Gone” . This song blends the lyrics of ‘Amazing Grace’, with a slight restyling. It is song in a prayerful manner, giving the singer a chance to focus on the words.\n\nOur second praise is, “Jesus Messiah”. Some of the lyrics make us consider other names of Jesus. For instance, Messiah (anointed one), Redeemer ( to set free via a purchase), Emmanuel (God with us), rescue for sinners, ransom from heaven. See if you can find these words of hints of them in Psalm 107 during the sermon.\n\nThe hymn, “All Praise to God, Who Reigns Above” will be sung in two sections. Verses 1-3 will be before the Sermon, and 4-6 at the conclusion. This hymn was written by Johann Jacob Schultz in 1675. He lived from 1640 to 1690. He was both a lawyer and a hymn writer, which I find to be an interesting combination. This hymn reflects on Psalm 107.\n\n2/5/2023\n\nI’m not sure where to begin, but let me say, that last week’s first praise hymn was beautifully done. Singing “How Great is Our God’ that slowly helped me to focus on the words and then see who God is and what He has done for me.\n\nWe Will Feast in the House of Zion\n\nMighty to Save\n\nHymn #419 “In Your Arms, Lord Jesus Christ”\n\nHymn #30 “Our God, Our Help in Ages Past”\n\nThis week’s selections are also well chosen. I’m not going to give a lot of background on the songs and artists. Instead, I would like to encourage all of us to first read Psalm 90, our sermon text, and then see how the two praise hymns and the last hymn reflect this Word of God. Our first Hymn, #419 is in honor of the baptism that Pastor David is doing.\n\n“We Will Feast in the House of Zion”, was written by the Getty’s. The fourth book of the Psalms is titled, “From Everlasting to Everlasting”. Ps 90 is a prayer of Moses, and while it is not a direct tie-in with this praise hymn, there are many common ideas and intents.\n\nHillsongs performed the next praise hymn in 2006. “Mighty to Save”, reminds us just who God is and what He does for us. It tells us that we need compassion, forgiveness. It asks God to take us as he finds us- our fears and failures. Why? Because He is mighty to save. Now read through Psalm 90:12, and then humbly bow in praise and thanksgiving.\n\nHymn # 419, “ In Your Arms Lord, Jesus Christ” was composed by Edmund P. Clooney. He was born in Philadelphia, Pa in 1917 and passed in 2005. He served as the president of Westminster Theological Seminary in Philadelphia. This hymn is listed for baptism. Ponder on the meaning and intent of baptism. Welcome to our family, Hana.\n\nWe actually sang hymn #30 on January 1st of this year. Isaac Watts wrote this to the theme of Psalm 90. Take a few minutes before the service to see how it ties in with Moses’ Psalm.\n\n1/29/2023 – Communion Sunday. I have been given a brief respite from teaching Sunday School. But, once a SS teacher, always a SS teacher. So I am asking that you prepare for the Morning Worship Service by reading both Psalm 51 ( our Confession of Faith) as well as Psalm 73. The sermon and hymn 657 focus on this Psalm.\n\nHow Great is Our God\n\nKing of Kings\n\nHymn #657 “In Sweet Communion, Lord, with Thee”\n\nHymn #252 “When I Survey the Wondrous Cross”\n\nI’m not sure where to begin, but let me say, that last week’s first praise hymn was beautifully done. Singing “How Great is Our God’ that slowly helped me to focus on the words and then see who God is and what He has done for me.\n\nThis week’s selections are also well chosen. I’m not going to give a lot of background on the songs and artists. Instead, I would like to encourage all of us to first read Psalm 90, our sermon text, and then see how the two praise hymns and the last hymn reflect this Word of God. Our first Hymn, #419 is in honor of the baptism that Pastor David is doing.\n\n“We Will Feast in the House of Zion”, was written by the Getty’s. The fourth book of the Psalms is titled, “From Everlasting to Everlasting”. Ps 90 is a prayer of Moses, and while it is not a direct tie-in with this praise hymn, there are many common ideas and intents.\n\nHillsongs performed the next praise hymn in 2006. “Mighty to Save”, reminds us just who God is and what He does for us. It tells us that we need compassion, forgiveness. It asks God to take us as he finds us- our fears and failures. Why? Because He is mighty to save. Now read through Psalm 90:12, and then humbly bow in praise and thanksgiving.\n\nHymn # 419, “ In Your Arms Lord, Jesus Christ” was composed by Edmund P. Clooney. He was born in Philadelphia, Pa in 1917 and passed in 2005. He served as the president of Westminster Theological Seminary in Philadelphia. This hymn is listed for baptism. Ponder on the meaning and intent of baptism. Welcome to our family, Hana.\n\nWe actually sang hymn #30 on January 1st of this year. Isaac Watts wrote this to the theme of Psalm 90. Take a few minutes before the service to see how it ties in with Moses’ Psalm.\n\n1/22/2023 –\n\nIt was Finished Upon That Cross\n\nHymn #304 “I Heard the Voice of Jesus Say”\n\nHymn #662 “As the Hart Longs for Flowing Streams”\n\nI don’t have , before me, the Psalms that we will be studying this Sunday, but I do know that we have 4 very stirring songs to worship our Lord with. before I share them, may I encourage anyone who enjoys not only hymns, but the history of hymnody, to get hold of a copy of this month’s TableTalk magazine, and read pages 68 and 69. If we run out of copies, just ask me and I will make a copy for you. The title is , “Why Hymnals?”\n\nOur two Praise hymns are familiar. The first, “It Was Finished Upon That Cross” focuses on the finality of the Crucifixion, the Living sacrifice.How much more dynamic were the words, “It Is Finished”, than any conclusion of a movie? Did you cheer when the Death Star was destroyed? Or when Aragorn, in the Lord Of the Rings, was crowned king and the hobbits returned to the Shire? Did your heart quicken when Aslan, who freely gave his life for the 4 children, returned to life? May this song remind us of His great love for us.\n\n“He Will Hold Me Fast”, has very simple lyrics, yet it provides encouragement for all our trials. Christ will always be there when we go through trials, because He loves you with a love immeasurable.\n\nHymn # 304 is one of Horatius Bonar’s 600+ hymns. This is an interesting song , in that it begins in A flat major key, but changes to F major. Let the lyrics and the music work together to give you a ‘feel’ for the intent of ,”I Heard the Voice of Jesus Say”.\n\n“As the Hart Longs for Flowing Streams” was written in 1975, by Danna Hawkins. This hymn is taken from Psalm 42, and it uses one of my favorite melodies. Our hymnal says it is an Appalachian folk melody, but to anyone of Scottish background, it is also called, “O Wally Wally”, from the 17th C.\n\n1/15/2023 – Praying that all those who have been feeling a little under the weather, are doing better. And to all who have had “boo-boo’s” this past year, i am thinking in buying stock in bubble wrap- just so no one else gets hurt. Anyway, it’s a new year, and we can enjoy many an old, or familiar, song.\n\nOnly a Holy God\n\nLord, I Need You\n\nHymn 9 – “All You the Fear Jehovah’s Name”\n\nHymn 310 – “Rejoice the Lord is King”\n\nCityAlight’s song, “Only a Holy God” should be known to many of us. Take a few minutes to ponder what they have put in their lyrics. Who can whisper and darkness trembles? What other splendor outshines the sun? What other glory consumes like fire? Or can raise the dead? Who else would offer His only Son? Only a Holy God.\n\nMatt Maher, Christy Nockels and several others worked on a beautiful, prayer-like song. “Lord I Need You” truly offers a humbling prayer to our mighty Lord. ‘Lord, I need You- every hour …” . This is one that I sing in the car- quietly and reverently.\n\n“All You the Fear Jehovah’s Name”, hymn #9, is based on Psalm 22:23-26,31. It is very familiar to most of us.Here is an English lesson: Jehovah means God, or, (the) Lord in our language. It is a version of YHWH, which is mentions over 6,00 times in scripture. This Tetragrammaton ( 4 letters) is the ‘ineffable’ name ( meaning too great or extreme to be expressed or described in words).\n\nOur final hymn, #310, “Rejoice the Lord is King” was composed by Charles Wesley in 1746. Did you know that he wrote over 6,000 hymns- to encourage his Methodist followers? This hymn was inspired by Paul’s letter to the Philippians. Paul wrote his letter to them while he, himself , was in a Roman prison, yet the letter expressed joy and encouragement.\n\nHave a most blessed Lord’s Day\n\n1/8/2023\n\nDid you make a New Years Resolution? Have you broken it already? If so, how did you feel when you realized you didn’t go one week, much less a whole year, before you failed’? Did you remind yourself, that we are weak, sinful creatures, but God is ever faithful ? Our music this week reflects this.\n\nThe Goodness of Jesus\n\nDeath Was Arrested\n\nHymn #486 “God, Be Merciful to Me”\n\nHymn #341 “O Breath of Life, Come Sweeping through Us”\n\n“Death Was Arrested”, begins mournfully in the first two verses, but the chorus offers a refreshing alternative. Verse 3 offers us relief and joy, but verse 4 reminds of the great cost for that relief.\n\n“The Goodness of Jesus” is new to me, and performed on YouTube by CityAlight. This modern song also deals with weariness and anxiety, but we are encouraged to rest in His peace and the goodness of Jesus. Stanza 2 reminds us that the world has nothing to offer, and stanza 3 encourages us to find hope in Jesus. He is all He said He would be.\n\nHymn 486, “God, Be Merciful to Me”, is taken from Psalm 51:1-15. This is David’s confession before God of his heinous sin and cover-up. This hymn first appeared in the Psalter of 1912, so it is fairly recent. It is such a blessing to know that we, too, can fall before the throne of God and confess our sins. ( we may think our sin isn’t as ‘bad’ as David’s, but to God, all sin is heinous).\n\nFinally, hymn 341, “O Breath of Life, Come Sweeping Through Us”, was written by Elizabeth Ann Porter Head in 1914. She was born in Ireland and was the secretary in Swansea. She also served with the Sout Africa General Mission from 1897-1907. While in South Africa, she helped found YMCA’s in various cities.\n\n1/1/2023 – New Year’s Day – May you all be blessed this New Year, “May His face shine upon you”….\n\nOn Jordan’s Stormy Banks\n\nAll Glory Be to Christ\n\nHymn #30 “Our God, Our Help in Ages Past”\n\nHymn #32 “Great Is Thy Faithfulness”\n\nThese notes will again be brief, as I am visiting our son and family in Florida. And if you know the Burguette’s, they also say hello.\n\nI wish I were with you, worshiping this Sunday because the music that has been selected, is very inspiring and moving. Sing loudly for me.\n\n“On Jordan’s Stormy Bank”, has wonderful lyrics and a beautiful melody. When I hear ,”I am bound for the promised Land”, … “ that happy place, forever blessed’, I can’t help but think of both Pilgrim’s Progress allegories by John Bunyan. Regardless of the trials and troubles we may face this year, and in the future, God has promised to bring us to his home- forevermore.\n\nKings Kaleidoscope, in 2012, wrote, “All Glory Be to Christ”. While the lyrics may be new, the tune is familiar to young and old alike. What a wonderful time to sing to the tune of Auld Lang Syne ( which means- times long past, or literally: old long since) . May it bring a tear of remembrance and joy to our eyes.\n\nHymn # 30, “Our God, Our Help in Ages Past” was written by Isaac Watts. Yes, he wrote ‘Our’, but John Wesley changed it to ‘O’. I grew up with the second version, but our hymnal uses the original. This hymn is based on the first 5 verses of Psalm 90, a psalm of Moses. Please take time to read these inspiring verses of assurance, promise and hope.\n\n“Great is thy Faithfulness”, # 32, was written by T.O. Chisholm. He was converted at age 26, then went into the ministry in the M.E. Church. In his 1,200 poems, he always strove to include as much scripture as possible.This hymn was inspired by the simple realization that God works daily in our lives. Maybe we should Resolve to look for all the times we see God working in our own daily existance.\n\n12/18/22 – 4th Sunday in Advent – LOVE\n\nPlease take a few minutes before this week’s service to read and meditate on the beauty of the sermon scripture: Isaiah 53. Such a stirring and compelling chapter.\n\nChristmas Offering, O Come All Ye Faithful / We Adore Thee\n\nHymn #218 “Angels, from the Realms of Glory”\n\nHymn #203 “Hark! The Herald Angels Sing”\n\nOur praise hymns are both composed by Paul Baloche. Paul was born in New Jersey in 1962. He was the Worship Pastor for a church in Texas for 26 years. In 2015, he and his family moved to New York City in order to be closer to family.\n\nThe first song is “Christmas Offering”, which may sound very familiar to those who listen to the contemporary sound. This is the Christmas. Version of his song, “Offering”. While I see a couple small inaccuracies, overall it is a beautiful song.\n\nThe other praise hymn is , “O Come, All Ye Faithful/ We Adore Thee”. The lyrics at the beginning are from the familiar hymn, but the tempo is in 6/8 time, instead of the usual 4/4 time.\n\nHymn 218, “Angels, From the Realms of Glory”, was written by James Montgomery. Other than Watts and Wesley, Montgomery was a one of the most prolific of hymn writers. His parents were missionaries in the West Indies, but died while he was still in boarding school. He published 11 volumes of poetry and at least 400 hymns. Our hymnal features 10 of these.\n\n“Hark! The Hearald Angels Sing” (#203), was written by Charles Wesley. It has been said that if you look at each line of text in this hymn, that you could study a line a day for almost a month. Look at the last 3 lines and meditate on each one’s meaning. ‘Born that man no more may die’ , ‘Born to raise the sons of earth’, ‘Born to give them second birth’.\n\nMay we all know deeply, the real reason for this season\n\n12/11/22 – 3rd Sunday in Advent – JOY\n\nFor Unto Us A Child is Born\n\nEmmanuel (Hallowed Manger Ground)\n\nHymn #221 “Lo, How a Rose E’er Blooming”\n\nHymn #198 “Lift Up Your Heads, Ye Mighty Gates!”\n\nThe first Praise Song, which is an unusual format for a hymn, is a blending of two songs: “For Unto Us a Child is Born” and “Open the Eyes of my Heart”, so the tunes are very familiar. These songs were combined about five years ago by Paul Baloche. The beginning is from Handel’s “Messiah”, while the second part of the song was made popular years ago by Michael W. Smith. The lyrics for both help us focus on this Advent season.\n\nOur second praise song is by Chris Tomlin. I listen to Bright FM, and Tomlin is featured several times during the day. This song, “Emmanuel (Hallowed Manger Ground) was written in 2009. The tune follows a prayerful lullaby style. Chris Tomlin was born in Texas and has co-written over 90% of his music. One of his songs we have sung st LRPC is the Easter song, “Is He Worthy,” one of my favorites.\n\n“Lo, How a Rose E’er Blooming.” hymn #221, is a German hymn from the 1500’s, based on Song of Solomon 2:1, which says, “I am a rose of Sharon” Medieval interpreters assigned this term to Christ.\n\nHymn #198, “Lift Up Your Heads, Ye Mighty Gates,” is based on Psalm 24, a hymn of David. Georg Weissel (1590-1635), was a German scholar, teacher and pastor who died during the Thirty Years War. This war was most horrid, as many areas in Europe suffered not only the usual results of war, but also plagues and other disasters, The population dropped from 16 million to just about 6 million during this war. One of Weissel’s other tunes was picked up by Johann S. Bach for his Christmas Oratorio.\n\n12/4/22 – 2nd Sunday in Advent\n\nNewborn King\n\nJoy to the World (Our God Saves)\n\nHymn #196 “Come, Thou Long-Expected Jesus”\n\nHymn #201 “O Little Town of Bethlehem”\n\nOur praise hymns are, of course, focusing on this season. The first song, “Newborn King”, has been sung here before. Listening to the background music, it reminds me of twinkling stars. The lyrics also echo last week’s theme of ‘hope’. One line reminds us that Mercy triumphs and Grace abounds.\n\nThe second song is “Joy to the World (Our God Saves)”. The tune is the familiar one, until the bridge, – ‘Our God Saves’.\n\nHymn 196, “Come, Thou Long Expected Jesus “. This familiar hymn was written by Charles Wesley. He wrote 18 Christmas hymns. The Wesley’s, while recognizing that the hymns of their day were orthodox and objective ( “just the facts, ma’am”), they focused on the more subjective, or personal experience. Wesley wanted his congregation to see the allusions to prophesy, but also apply the Biblical facts to a personal experience.\n\nI found out that during the time of Christ, Bethlehem was a small village of only about 300 people. Put in perspective, that’s about equal to 3 of our Sunday attendance counts.\n\n“O Little Town of Bethlehem” (#201), was composed by Phillip Brooks ( 1835-1893). he was an Episcopalian minister serving in Philadelphia and Massachusetts. In 1865, he visited the Holy Land at Christmas. He was so impressed by Bethlehem, that he wrote this hymn for the children in his congregation. Let’s sing it with child-like joy and innocence.\n\n11/27/22 – Communion and 1st Sunday in Advent – The first Sunday of Advent is one of HOPE. So, hopefully, our music selections will help us all see the promises and joy of the season.\n\nCome Behold The Wondrous Mystery\n\nJoyful Joyful We Adore Thee\n\nHymn #194 “O Come, O Come, Emmanuel”\n\nHymn #431 “A Parting Hymn We Sing”\n\n“Joyful, Joyful, We Adore Thee ( Rejoice, Rejoice)”, by Rend Collective, is a beautiful blending of 2 familiar songs. The tunes are Beethoven’s “Hymn to Joy” and “O Come, O Come, Emmanuel”. Henry Van Dyke, composer of “Joyful, Joyful”, was a Presbyterian minister. He was an author of many books, professor at Princeton, a Navy chaplain in WW 1 and an ambassador to Holland and Luxembourg under president Woodrow Wilson.\n\n“Come Behold the Wondrous Mystery” needs us to really ponder the meaning of the lyrics. The first word is ‘mystery’. The definition means something difficult or impossible to understand. Do we really understand WHAT Christ did when he took on human flesh? Expanding this, a Person can be a mystery when we can’t explain their identity, whose nature or identity is puzzling or unknown. And what about the word, ‘condescending’? Modern definitions imply patronizing, or superior attitude- which we think of as a negative trait. But Christ really, in a good way, condescend. If we think about antonymns- approachable, humble, friendly- these also apply to our Lord.\n\nEchoing one of the praise songs, hymn #194, is the more familiar version of “O Come ,O Come, Emmanuel”. This is a very old hymn from the 1700’s, that was from a 12th C. Latin antiphonal and a 13th plainsong tune. The text is a series of phrases that focus on Biblical names for Christ. Can you find all 7?\n\n“A Parting Hymn We Sing”, written by Aaron R. Wolfe in 1858, brings to a beautiful close of the Celebration of the Lord’s Supper. He , too was a Presbyterian minister. This is his most well-known hymn of the seven he wrote.\n\n11/20/22 –\n\nLiving Hope\n\nYour Will Be Done\n\nHymn #254 “Alas! and Did My Savior Bleed”\n\nHymn #172 “Let Us Love and Sing and Wonder”\n\n11/13/22– I don’t know how your month has been going, but typing the date, I realized we are almost half way through the month, and it seems like it just started! Please take time to read the Call to Worship, Ezekiel 34:11-16, as well as looking over the reading in James for this week. It will help make our 4 hymns come even more alive as we sing them.\n\nBehold Him\n\nCornerstone\n\nHymn #573 “Am I a Soldier of the Cross”\n\nHymn #457 “Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing”\n\nOur two praise hymns are familiar; “Behold Him” and “Cornerstone”. The second one derives it’s tune and lyrics from Edward Mote’s hymn,”Solid Rock”. ( check out Hebrews 6:19,20 to gain more depth in the song. People have wondered what , “my anchor holds within the veil”, is referring to. My research says that the veil is the one that tore in the Temple, and Christ is our anchor. Simply- we can face our God knowing that Christ has anchored us in faith.\n\nHymn 573, “Am I a Soldier of the Cross”, was penned by Isaac Watts.Many of his hymns were written to accompany his sermons, and this one is based on I Corinthians 16:13-“Holy Fortitude, or Remedies against Fear”. He was encouraging his congregation to practice virtues, plead for the oppressed and be courageous before scoffers.\n\n“Come Thou Fount of Many Blessings” was written by Robert Robinson. As a teen, he attended a George Whitfield service with the only intent to ridicule it. God had other plans as he was converted while there. He wrote this hymn at age 23- after becoming a minister himself.\n\n11/6/22 – International Day of Prayer\n\nTurn Your Eyes\n\nIn Christ Alone\n\nHymn 719 – Be Still My Soul\n\nForgive Our Sins As We Forgive\n\nThis week’s hymns run from well-known and familiar, to almost unknown ( but very well written). Life is truly an adventure.\n\n“Turn Your Eyes” has been song many time by our congregation. I enjoy singing this as the tune is prayerful and uplifting. Sovereign Grace Music began 35 years ago, first in Maryland and finally settling in Kentucky. Their missi"
