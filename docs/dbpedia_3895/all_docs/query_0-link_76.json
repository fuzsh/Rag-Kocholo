        "text": "Aaron Greer Band\n\nAgents of Change\n\nSince 2005, Aaron Greer Band has been sharing the Gospel through shows that combine music with technology and other forms of media. In conjunction with the concerts and tour, Agents of Change is the second album that this band has recorded. The CD gives listeners a rare taste of melodic guitar rock mixed with clean lyrics and electronic background sounds. Though Aaron Greer’s timeless message and clear vocals are solid, some may find the album to be too old-fashioned sounding. With simple guitar licks, some vocal echoing, and synthesizer noises, the result mostly sounds like something from the 90s. Album Highlights: “May Your Glory Move” and “I Want My Life to Speak.” – amy nickerson\n\nAdie\n\nDon't Wait\n\nBenjamin Gate fans looking for a reunion album on Adie’s new Don’t Wait shouldn’t hold their collective breath. Adie’s done with the hard rock. Now she features a softer side on her first solo album. Leaning more towards adult contemporary rock, she exercises pianos and acoustic guitars this time around. Her husband, Jeremy Camp, who’s now the edgier one of the two, shares some songwriting and playing credits on such songs as “When It’s Over” and “If I’ll Ever.” The ballads (i.e., “What Have I Done” and “Time”) are tender, and if you get over the fact that she can wail on the microphone a lot harder than this, they’re actually kind of pleasant. You’ll recognize her cover of the Byrds’ “Turn, Turn, Turn;” it rocks a little but doesn’t lift off the ground high enough. Overall, take a look at this album with fresh eyes and ears, and you just might enjoy it. Album Highlights: “Overwhelm Me” and “Don’t Wait (Lazy Day)” - jennifer e. jones\n\nAddison, Shari\n\nShari Addison\n\nShari Addison was crowned runner up to winner Crystal Aikin on BET's \"Sunday Best,\" a singing competition. While not the winner of the competition, Crystal did not give up but rather kept running, and her hard work is paying off. Addison released her debut album in January. The CD is a mix of traditional and contemporary Gospel music, and is sure to be loved by those who favor the type of music. Addison provides a variety of tunes from slow to upbeat tempos with lyrics that worship Christ and others that seek Him. Shari Addison is a pretty good album to be Addison's first, and I look forward to seeing what comes from her in the future. Album Highlights: \"Whateva,\" \"No Battle, No Blessing,\" and \"Please Make Me Better\" - kimberly a. lilly\n\nAfters, The\n\nNever Going Back to OK\n\n“Beautiful Love” fans can jump off the edge of their seats because the long-awaited follow-up album to I Wish We All Could Win is here. The former coffee shop guys now known as The Afters are at their rock/pop best with 12 cross-over-ready tracks on Never Going Back to OK. The ballads show more depth than they have before, and you get that when you really listen to “Ocean Wide” and “Beautiful Worlds”. As cheesy as it sounds, “Myspace Girl” is surprisingly cute and catchy, and “Falling Into Place” has multiple layers lyrically and musically. The Afters continue to explore the bounds of earthly and heavenly relationships. And they get a little better with every step. Album Highlights: “Falling Into Place” and “Myspace Girl\" - jennifer e. jones\n\nI Wish We All Could Win\n\nThis debut by The Afters is a rock’n’roll wave of honest lyrics that show the reality of our often bumpy journey of faith. Read the full review...\n\nAgnew, Todd\n\nBetter Questions\n\nThe ghost of Johnny Cash has been haunting Todd Agnew. At least, that’s the impression I got hearing the depth of Agnew’s soul in the first notes of “Still Has a Hold”. He truly shed the boy-next-door worship leader image he had on Grace Like Rain and exchanged it for that of a rugged spiritual outlaw. “Why can’t you see me as one of the least of these?” is just one of the \"better questions\" he asks on this country/rock-filled road. He shows his frailty and strength in every lyric and guitar stroke. His take on “Our Great God” is a powerful yet gentle giant. Better Questions tops off at sixteen songs, and Agnew satisfies even the most critical ear . Album Highlights: “Our Great God”, “On a Corner in Memphis” and “Least of These”- jennifer e. jones\n\nDo You See What I See?\n\nTodd Agnew’s powerful style, and storytelling lyrics share new perspectives of the Christmas story in his third and latest project, Do You See What I See?. Each original song is written from the point of view of different eyewitnesses of Christ’s birth. Everyone’s life was changed. Personal dreams were replaced with God’s plans. But then again, He sees our future more than we can, so put your trust in Him. Other Christian music artists joined Agnew on this CD, including Vince Lichlyter from Jonah33, Mike Weaver of Big Daddy Weave, Anthony Evans, and more. Grab a copy of this uplifting album and another one to give to a friend. Album Highlights: “Did You Know?”, “He is Called Jesus,” and “In the First Light” - hannah goodwyn\n\nReflection of Something\n\nZealous worship leader Todd Agnew shares his passionate songs with music fans once again. Straight-forward lyrics question and humble as each song will open your eyes to see God's breathtaking wonder and glory. Agnew changes it up from his first CD by adding blues and southern gospel tones to his powerful rock style. Expect great things from this one. Album Highlights: \"My Jesus,\" \"In the Middle of Me,\" \"Where Were You\" and the 10 other songs - hannah goodwyn\n\nAikin, Crystal\n\nCrystal Aikin\n\nBET's \"Sunday Best\" winner and former ER room nurse, Crystal Aikin, released her first album in January 2009 and it is Awesome--with a capital \"A\"! Aikin's new found fame is very much deserved, as her journey to present day was not an easy one. Before becoming the winner of \"Sunday's Best,\" Aikins saw many doors closed in other competitions, before seeing an open one. And, she even witnessed her father pass away from a sudden heart attack. But everything happens for a reason, and surely there is a time and season for everything. And God's timing, it's perfect. Based on the lyrics, arrangements, tunes, etc. heard on Crystal Aikin, every closed door and tough experience has only brought Miss Aikin closer to God. Because of her experiences, through her music you will be drawn closer to Him too. This CD has music to worship to, dance to, cry to, and even laugh too, but more importantly it is an album that will help you seek, worship, and praise Jesus Christ. It is definitely a must have. Album Highlights: The entire album! - kimberly a. lilly\n\nAll Star United\n\nLove & Radiation\n\nLet the lineup change as it may, All Star United still rocks. Love and Radiation is pure Christian pop rock like newsboys or Audio A. The title track kicks things off with very descriptive visions of God (”You’re the virus that’s running through my veins / You’re a danger like love and radiation / Seeping into my brain”). Although it’s one “yeah, yeah” too many, the perkiness of “You You You Yeah Yeah Yeah” is infectious. The musically predictable “We Could Be Brilliant” is one I could do without, however the audacity to fly in the face of popular Christian music on “Song of the Year” is remarkable. Irreverent and holy at the same time, ASU reigns supreme. Album Highlights: “Song of the Year” and “Love and Radiation” - jennifer e. jones\n\nAnberlin\n\nCities\n\nAnberlin is one of the most unique voices in Christian rock today, and their new album, Cities, only solidifies their title. Frontman Stephen Christian’s emo-ridden vocals sing with more conviction than some worship songs. They are still challenging the lost souls with lyrics such as, “There’s more to living than being alive” from “Reclusion”. And the driving beats and synthesized keys made famous from their first hit “Ready Fuels\" continue on tracks “Godspeed” and “A Whisper and a Clamor”. Yet, with all the “clamor” and hype, they slow it down for “The Unwinding Cable Car” and “Inevitable”. The best Anberlin album is here. The only thing sweeter will be hearing these new songs live in concert. Album Highlights: “Dismantle.Repair” and ”Godspeed” - jennifer e. jones\n\nAnderson, Jared\n\nWhere Faith Comes From\n\nSome may know Jared Anderson from his active involvement with Colorado’s Desperation Band. Other fans might remember his first solo effort, Where To Begin, released in 2006. Now, the artist is back with an all-new album entitled, Where Faith Comes From. The solid lyrics take an honest look at exactly that as the CD explores the beauty of Christ, the trials of this world, and the act of finding Him within this life. Nonetheless, fans of Desperation could find this album disappointing. A few tracks stay true to the genuine, energetic sound of the worship band. However, others fall a bit flat, dragging down the momentum of the CD instead of pushing it onward. Album Highlights: “All I Want,” “Glorified” - amy nickerson\n\nAnderson, Nigel\n\nThe Catalyst\n\nThe Catalyst is the sophomore project from Nigel Anderson, better known as Legin. The catchy beats of these tracks are what initially draw you into this Gospel Rap album, but it is Legin’s powerful lyrics that leave a lasting impression. His love for Christ and people shine through in every song. In “Seek the Lord,” he encourages listeners to press into God and spend time seeking His face. In “Believe Thee” he expresses a burden to reach unbelievers. He writes, “Sometimes it gets hard, and then it gets easy, You say you won't forsake, no, You won't leave me. Every night I pray, Lord, that you keep me. What is it gonna take for this world to believe Thee?” It is the heart-felt passion on this track and others that brings depth to the album. Album Highlights: “Seek the Lord,” “Move,” “Believe Thee,” and “God is an Artist.” - belinda elliott\n\nAndrews, Meredith\n\nThe Invitation\n\nThe Invitation is the title of the latest album from Meredith Andrews. With this album, the talented musician invites listeners to experience God’s grace. Songs such as, “You Are Not Alone” and “You Invite Me In,” remind listeners of God’s promise to never leave them, nor forsake them. Another song on the album entitled, “Show Me What It Means” share Andrews’ desire to know more about God and his will for her life. Other songs on the album simply take the time to honor God with praise and worship. Over all, the entire album invokes listeners to reflect on who God is and to accept his invitation of love unconditional. Album Highlights: \"You Invite Me In,\" \"Draw Me Nearer,\" and \"Deeper.\" - kimberly ann lilly\n\nAshmont Hill\n\nAshmont Hill\n\nThe self-titled debut album by Ashmont Hill has developed out of four relatives from a community near Boston who have led music in their church for years. Most of the songs included on the CD are originals written by Phil Thompson, though listeners will recognize a few Matt Redmond tracks, “Gifted Response” and “Blessed Be Your Name.” With tight harmony and calming melodies, Ashmont Hill will catch the interest of fans of classic gospel music. However, even with the worshipful lyrics and smooth vocals, this album is not for everyone. Album Highlights: “You Proved Your Love” and “Gifted Response” - amy nickerson\n\nAudio Adrenaline\n\nUntil My Heart Caves In\n\nIt is hard to imagine a band like Audio Adrenaline recording an album that drips with love and emotion. But that is exactly what they have done with their ninth studio release, albeit in their own raucous way. From Mark Stuart’s trademark growl to Ben Cissell’s thundering sledgehammer drumming on the opening track “Clap Your Hands,” it is clear Audio A’s intention is to recapture the classic rock sound. The power groove continues on the title track but eventually settles into comfortable pop rock territory, definitely not their strength. Not to be confused, this is a very likable album. It just lacks the lyrical creativity that fueled previous Audio A standards. Album Highlights: Clap Your Hands\" and \"Light of the Sun\" - chris carpenter\n\nAuge Joel\n\nOn The Blue\n\nIn his solo debut, Joel Auge brings his original worship music and folk-rock style to Christian homes and radio stations. With 12 tracks that blend strong vocals (including some nice falsetto) with acoustic melodies and truth-filled lyrics, On The Blue offers something for everyone. Auge says that he hopes that his songs “will stretch people’s hearts and minds while they’re worshipping Jesus.” Singing biblically sound lyrics that focus on God and invite everyone to give Christ the glory instead of themselves (even stating this outwardly in “Glory Glory”), Auge should be proud to have fulfilled his goal. Album Highlights: “Even The Rocks” and “Singing Hallelujah.” - amy nickerson\n\nAvalon\n\nFaith: A Collection of Hymns\n\nThe only real downfall of Avalon’s Faith: A Hymns Collection has nothing to do with its content but rather its timeliness. After hearing every pop Christian act (from Jars of Clay to Out of Eden) record a hymns project last year, fans of the genre may be a bit weary of “How Great Thou Art” covers. Nevertheless, the members of Avalon sing their hearts out as they do best. They don’t do anything revolutionary to the songs but the perfect harmony in which Jody, Greg, Melissa, and Janna sing shines a new light all their own. The war-like drums on “It Is Well” is a new take on the classic. A folk version of “Jesus Loves Me/’Tis So Sweet” is precious. Also, it was fairly ambitious of them to tackle “Total Praise,” a song mostly done by choirs 10 times their size. Avalon fans will delight in this addition to their collection, as might fans of hymns. Album Highlights: “Great Is Thy Faithfulness” and “Total Praise” - jennifer e. jones\n\nStand\n\nFew groups sound just as strong together as they do individually and Avalon stands above the crowd. Those who love their signature vocal harmonies will dig their latest release, Stand. While their lyrics couldn’t get more simplistic at points (“Love won’t leave you empty-handed” from “Love Won’t Leave You”), their strong suite remains their ballads. “Orphans of God” is a sweet but strong reassurance of the Lord’s love, and the title track is also a powerful call for the faithful. They get out of their element with the funky intro on “I Survive” and make it work with heavy guitars in the chorus. Over all there aren’t easily recognizable hits like “You Were There” or “Adonai” but Avalon still sings as good as they ever have. Album Highlights: “We Will Stand” and “I Survive” - jennifer e. jones\n\nBarfield, Warren\n\nWorth Fighting For\n\nEncouraging, convicting and comforting are words that describe Warren Barfield’s new album Worth Fighting For. The 11-track project, which is Barfield’s third, has catchy tunes behind lyrics that are filled with life experiences that everyone can relate to. The first single off the album, “Love Is Not A Fight,” speaks of what love is and why it is worth fighting for. “Say It With Your Life,” reminds believers to let their life reflect what they believe. While “The Singer Not The Song,” tells that worship is not something we sing, but something we live. This new album shows the maturity of Barfield as a man and the growth in his walk with Christ. It is one that his fans will appreciate. Album Highlights: “The One Thing,” “As It In Heaven” and “Love Is Not A Fight.”\n\n- kimberly a. lilly\n\nReach\n\nWhat I love about Warren Barfield’s sophomore release Reach is twofold. First, he lets the natural soul in his voice shine through – especially on the first track “I’ll Be Alright.” His confidence level has grown to feature not only quality songwriting but the vocals to go with it. Secondly, track after track, Warren maintains a smooth groove with vulnerable passion that almost sounds a bit like Maroon 5 but still very much Barfield. Warren continues in the vein of “Mistaken” and “Soak It Up” with lyrics you can identify with (i.e., “I’m on top of the world / And my world’s upside down / All I have is you” on “Closer”). On Reach, Warren reaches for soulful heights and grasps them with near perfection. Album Highlights: “Closer” and “Shadow” - jennifer e. jones\n\nBarlowGirl\n\nAnother Journal Entry\n\nDon’t let the lackadaisical title fool you. Another Journal Entry is something you want to read. On their sophomore release, this sister act serves up more rock beats and power ballads. Their lyrics still strive to go deeper than the typical teenage angst (as seen in “I Need You to Love Me” with lines like: “Your love makes me forget what I have been”). Vocally, BarlowGirl mix their sweet voices with hard riffs. While nothing on this album will rock your world, BarlowGirl fans will be satisfied, and even the toughest cynic can’t deny that these little ladies have promise. Album Highlights: “5 Minutes of Fame,” “No One Like You,” and “Never Alone (Acoustic Version)” - jennifer e. jones\n\nBates, Brian\n\nWorlds Collide\n\nMusician and songwriter, Brian Bates, has found new inspiration in the past couple of years. His second album, Worlds Collide, clearly indicates this, showing a passion and love of missions, travel, and other “worlds.” More specifically, Bates has partnered with World Vision in an attempt to bring water, food, healthcare, and education to people in Sierra Leone in Africa. Brian’s newest CD tells the stories of his work there, with songs like “You Danced” and “Elijah” exploring issues of poverty and brokenness while also revealing an awe for the simple joy some of the poorest people have. While the music may seem like anything else on the radio today, Brian’s insight and heart will easily keep you listening. Album Highlights: “Under” and “You Danced.”– amy nickerson\n\nBattistelli, Francesca\n\nMy Paper Heart\n\nWith a style reminiscent of Sara Bareilles (especially on the album's first single, \"I'm Letting Go\") Francesca Battistelli's soulful voice and unique songwriting ability make My Paper Heart shine. Whether it is celebrating God’s unconditional love and acceptance of us (“Free to Be Me”), trusting Him with our future (“I’m Letting Go”), or allowing Him to heal our wounds (“My Paper Heart”), Battistelli’s lyrics are as authentic as they are vulnerable. Well I’ve been treated like a valentine / That’s been ripped apart and left behind /I’m a fragile girl /In a crazy careless world, she writes in the album’s title track. Her versatile styles range from piano-driven pop to a more funky jazz sound (“Blue Skies”). This album has it all -- powerful vocals, stick-in-your-head choruses, and refreshing lyrics. Expect to be hearing a lot more from this talented artist. Album Highlights: ‘I’m Letting Go,” “Free to Be Me,” “Time in Between” – belinda elliott\n\nBarrettsmith, Brooke\n\nBrooke Barrettsmith\n\nYou might remember Brook Barrettsmith from American Idol’s Season Five; she made it to the top 40 before being eliminated. Well, Brooke is back. Her self-titled debut album, Brooke Barrettsmith, was released on June 10 and is very impressive. The pop/rock artist has a style that is similar to something you’ve probably heard before, but nevertheless, she makes every song personal and unique by sharing her life experiences and her faith. The ten tracks on the album give insight on various topics including: the comfort of God, letting go of past mistakes, and faith in God. Album Highlights: \"Quiet My Heart,\" \"Farwell,\" and \"More Real.\" - kimberly a. lilly\n\nBeeching, Vicky\n\nYesterday, Today and Forever\n\nWhen female worship leaders who praise on guitar are few and far between, Vicky Beeching arrives with Yesterday, Today and Forever. It’s essentially Chris Tomlin meets Jennifer Knapp. Her songs are fetching with enough of a hook to catch on in any church service. Lyrically, Beeching lets her devotion run deep and never strays from Scripture. She offers solid songs of her own like the title track, “Call to Worship” and others. Yet she provides a soft touch to worship standards like “Above All Else” and “Turn Your Eyes.” Certainly, Beeching is sharing songs from her heart that you’ll be singing on Sunday mornings in 2006. Album Highlights: “Call to Worship” and “Turn Your Eyes” - jennifer e. jones\n\nBig Daddy Weave\n\nEvery Time I Breathe\n\nEvery Time I Breathe is not so much a step up for Big Daddy Weave as it is a step sideways. They’re still rocking with the same sound that started their career on One and Only. Although it smacks of typical Christian radio fluff, a few bright tracks make it a pleasurable listen. “All the Same” is a venture into Dave Matthews Band’s world with a full band sound. They cover Rich Mullins’ “Hold Me Jesus,” and their edgier version of “Let It Rise” isn’t half-bad. However, these songs get lost in a sea of familiar riffs and lyrics that are the same as Weave’s contemporaries. A decent new album but if this is a sign of what’s to come from Big Daddy Weave, I’ll stick with an “Audience of One.” Album Highlights: “All the Same” and “Every Time I Breathe” - jennifer e. jones\n\nBluetree\n\nGod of This City\n\nBluetree’s latest record features rock anthems for the church who isn’t afraid of getting a little loud in their praise to God. This band of Irish brothers in Christ, with its rock and ballad-style songs, is sure to be the next big leader in bringing new songs to worship services around the world. The band’s fun rock sound, backed by strong lyrics that glorify God, is definitely their strength. Favorites: “God’s Plan”, “Life’s Noise,” and “Burn Me Up” - hannah goodwyn\n\nBoone, Pat\n\nGlory Train: The Lost Sessions\n\nOriginally intended to be a cutting edge crossover release when it was recorded in 1975, this album is easy listening by today’s standards. But you can’t help but like the man who made white buck shoes popular. What sets this album apart is not the novelty of lost recording sessions but the inclusion of a newly recorded all-star tribute to the world’s most famous evangelist, Billy Graham. Entitled “Thank You Billy Graham,” the ensemble single and supplementary DVD features a diversified line up including, Bono, Leanne Rimes, dcTalk, Andre Crouch, to name a few. Album Highlights: \"Thank You Billy Graham\" Album Highlights: \"Fire,\" \"Confused\" - chris carpenter\n\nBrennan, Moya\n\nAn Irish Christmas\n\nThere’s something very enchanting about the Celtic melodies of Moya Brennan. Her voice is light and airy as she softly sings both traditional and new holiday songs. Obviously, fans of Enya, Michelle Tumes and other like singers are more likely to enjoy this Irish rendition of yuletide joy. Listeners will get an earful of sweeping vocal arrangements and the gentle plucking of a harp. Brennan is a one-woman choir on “Carol of the Bells,” yet she gives the most delicate of performances on the final track “Silent Night”. An acquired taste but well worth it. Album Highlights: \"Carol of Bells\" and \"Silent Night\" - jennifer e. jones\n\nBrewster, Lincoln\n\nToday is the Day\n\nToday is the Day, gives Lincoln Brewster fans two things: an appetizer of the expected CCM hits, and then a musically diverse, meaty entree. Like his other releases, this album has several accessible hits for corporate worship. The title track, a solid praise tune co-written with Paul Baloche, is already getting heavy Christian radio play, and worship teams will easily adapt the meditative “Power of Your Name.” But while each song has its definite merit, the main course begins with his newer, less-predictable material. Highlights: The soulful, jazzy, gospel styles he introduces on “Give Him Praise,” “The Arms of My Savior,” and “This Love,” and his shredding guitar solos on songs such as “Let Your Glory Shine” and “Salvation is Here.” - rebekah wilson\n\nBuilding 429\n\nBuilding 429\n\nBuilding 429 released their self-tilted album on October 21 and it is not so pleasing to the ear. Personally, after hearing this album I’m not ready to be one of their fans. I do not doubt that Jason Roy, Michael Anderson, and Jesse Garcia are talented young men, but that talent is just not heard on this album. The lyrics of many of the songs are interesting and thought provoking, but in others if the vocals don’t put you to sleep, then the tunes are bound to give you a headache. Nevertheless, I won’t completely write the album off because admittedly I’m not a huge fan of the band’s style of music, and because of that I do recommend that you give it a listen and evaluate the album for yourself. Highlights: “Shoulder,” “Always” and “End of Me” – kimberly a. lilly\n\nIris to Iris\n\nI know it’s unfair to wish that Building 429 would make another hit as easily catchy as “Glory Defined”. However, I believe that a band as evolved as this one should have a sound that matures with every album. I’m not finding that to be the case on Iris to Iris. While I appreciate the sold-out devotion to Christ in every lyric, the tracks don’t pop out of the mundane. For example, “Amazed” sounds like every other song on Christian radio today, as does “Waiting to Shine,” in spite of its sincere tenderness. This ship doesn’t sink completely. “Constant” comes up for air with a light melody and a guitar riff that echoes behind Jason Roy’s voice. Iris will pacify the absolute Building 429 fan, but we should all hope for better. Album Highlights: “Constant” - jennifer e. jones\n\nThe Space in Between Us\n\nThere’s nothing terribly original about Building 429, but they sure do know how to craft a catchy pop-rock song. Read the full review...\n\nRise\n\nIf you loved Building 429’s first album The Space in Between Us than you will absolutely love their sophomore release Rise. The reason is simple; it sounds nearly identical. While the disc is certainly enjoyable to listen to, the boys from Nashville have not really broken any new ground. This is a concept album through and through. Beginning with the title track and continuing through “Fearless” and “Alive,” the theme of rising from a world of brokenness to a life filled with potential, promise, and hope is quite prevalent. A confession, I absolutely love their cover of Blessid Union of Souls’ “I Believe.” It is a gritty performance that will resonate for hours after you hear it. Album Highlights: “Searching for a Savior,” “Empty” (featuring Tait), and “I Belong to You” - chris carpenter\n\nBy the Tree\n\nWorld on Fire\n\nI love the theme of By the Tree’s new album, and it's beautifully illustrated in the title track: “There is a Savior in the sky / Giving His life to set this world on fire.” However, the musical vehicle to get that theme to your ears is running tired. World on Fire is more adult contemporary Christian rock that’s suffering from a lack of originality. Their knack for covering worship songs is helpful to distinguish one song from another, but the effort to be novel is missing. \"Rain Down\" is grand, but it’s hard to mess up a delirious? song. On “Shine” (not the newsboys’ song), former drummer, now lead singer Aaron Blanton says it all when he sings, “What can I do that’s never been done / What can I sing that’s never been sung?” My sentiments exactly. Album Highlights: “How Beautiful You Are” and “Rain Down” - jennifer e. jones\n\nCadia\n\nCadia\n\nTori Smith and Courtney Myers may be young and new to Nashville’s music world, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t worth a listen. In fact, this duo’s debut, Cadia, offers tight vocals, challenging lyrics, and a refreshing energy that is hard to come by. With a sound like BarlowGirl or Krystal Meyers and a blend of biblically-based wisdom on topics ranging from high school life and dreams (“This One’s for the Girls”) to prayer and apologetics (“Only a Prayer Away” and “Curious”), these girls will please the teen crowd and the parents. Album Highlights: “This One’s for the Girls”, “Jesus” and “Inside Out.” - by amy nickerson\n\nCaedmon's Call\n\nOverdressed\n\nCaedmon’s Call and Derek Webb join forces again for social change and divine discomfort on Overdressed. Like a ‘60s hippie band thirsty for a revolution, it’s hard to deny their fight (especially on the acoustically driven, campfire song, “All Across the Western World”). The melodies take a backseat to the message on this album, which sadly makes some of the songs quite underwhelming. Nevertheless, their points pack a serious punch (i.e., “The reaching of the steeple felt like one more expensive ad for something cheap” from “Expectations”). The one song where lyrics and harmony stand toe-to-toe is “Hold the Light” -- a two-minute outro rolls on while the title is whispered over a light guitar solo. Overdressed is hardly CC’s Share the Well, nor is it Webb’s Mockingbird. But fans of the old days will still feel the magic. Album Highlights: “Hold the Light” - jennifer e. jones\n\nIn the Company of Angels II: The World Will Sing\n\nOn the press release accompanying Jeremy Camp’s latest album, Speaking Louder Than Before, a bold headline reads, “Husband. Father. Artist.” Along with a few pictures of Jeremy Camp the rock star, is a family portrait. This is a good metaphor for his latest CD and the direction of his career. In a way, Jeremy Camp’s music is secondary to his personality and his celebrity in the Christian music world. Along with being an artist, Jeremy Camp strives to be a minister and a model of a solid Christian guy (which is admirable), but doesn’t seem overly interested in breaking new ground as an artist. With polished, upbeat inspiration tracks like “I’m Alive” and “Giving You All Control”, Camp creates pop-friendly songs, but doesn’t explore any new territory. Camp fans will dig the latest record, but it isn’t anything we haven’t heard before. Highlights: “There Will Be a Day” “My Fortress” – jesse carey” - jennifer e. jones\n\nCamp, Jeremy\n\nSpeaking Louder Than Before\n\nOn the press release accompanying Jeremy Camp’s latest album, Speaking Louder Than Before, a bold headline reads, “Husband. Father. Artist.” Along with a few pictures of Jeremy Camp the rock star, is a family portrait. This is a good metaphor for his latest CD and the direction of his career. In a way, Jeremy Camp’s music is secondary to his personality and his celebrity in the Christian music world. Along with being an artist, Jeremy Camp strives to be a minister and a model of a solid Christian guy (which is admirable), but doesn’t seem overly interested in breaking new ground as an artist. With polished, upbeat inspiration tracks like “I’m Alive” and “Giving You All Control”, Camp creates pop-friendly songs, but doesn’t explore any new territory. Camp fans will dig the latest record, but it isn’t anything we haven’t heard before. Highlights: “There Will Be a Day” “My Fortress” – jesse carey\n\nBeyond Measure\n\nIf you already love Jeremy Camp, then you’ll take an interest in his latest album. However, Camp will be hard-pressed to win over new fans with Beyond Measure. This project -- and honestly every project since 2002’s Stay -- is a mix of the same songs and lyrics scrambled just enough to call it new. If played against heavy hits like “Understand” or even “Lay Down My Pride”, very few songs on Beyond Measure can measure up. “Feels Like” is the strongest attempt at stirring up praise where Camp belts out a half dozen “hallelujahs” near the end. Don’t get me wrong. Camp is a phenomenal rock star with a message that is nothing short of inspiring. However, I’m afraid that we’ve seen the best he’s got in his earlier works. Album Highlights: “Feels Like” and “I Am Nothing” - jennifer e. jones\n\nLive Unplugged\n\nHe’s live, he’s unplugged, and he sounds exactly the same. Even in this stripped down acoustic set (which really isn’t stripped down when you have a full band and mini orchestra), Jeremy Camp’s vocals are note-for-note the same as on the originals. Certain selections such as “I Still Believe” and “Walk by Faith” are nearly identical to the album versions. There’s no improvisation nor added innovative spice to the songs. The saving grace of Live Unplugged is the DVD. Camp talks about his new family, shares his faith, and shows a humorous side that’s downright charming. Diehard, can’t-get-enough-of-him fans will covet this intimate look at Camp but for everyone else, wait until something new comes out. Album Highlights: “My Desire” and “Stay” - jennifer e. jones\n\nCarlozo, Lou\n\nStick Figure Soul\n\nWhat happens when a critic makes his own attempt at musical greatness? If Lou Carlozo’s (Chicago Tribune) new album is a guide, it isn’t anything to get excited about. Having played in two bands before, Carlozo is a talented musician, but his dated sound (think late 60’s) will resonate with few listeners. Probably anticipating this, Carlozo tried to make up for it with his lyrics. But his aims at grand symbolism are more confusing than inspiring, and sometimes he uses the same symbols on more than one track. Further, parents need to look out for songs like “Solomon Has Sung,” which heavily hints at sex. Stick Figure Soul does have an overlying message of redemption—which is clearly heard in the songs “Always” and “Morning Hurts My Eyes”—but that can be found on nearly any Christian album. Finding it on Carlozo’s comes at too high a cost. Highlights: “Morning Hurts My Eyes” and “Always.” – bethany duval\n\nCarr, Sheri\n\nFearless Now\n\nIn the realm of Christian worship music, Sheri Carr is no amateur. The artist has participated in several Vineyard recordings and is already being played on the radio. Fearless Now, Carr’s solo debut, is quickly revealing that her dynamic voice and humble attitude is worth recognition. The album is exactly what should be expected of a contemporary worship leader, complete with a backup choir on a few tracks and simple repetitive lyrics that make it easy to catch on. The 12 songs that make up this album are not the successful, jumpy pop tunes heard too often today. Instead, they are the basic offerings of a Christ follower and church leader. And that is what makes them valuable. Album Highlights: \"Into Your Arms\" and \"Sing Your Praise\" – amy nickerson\n\nCarried Away\n\nCloser to You\n\nCarried Away offers pop worship at its sugary worst. They harmonize like angels but after a few tracks, they sound like an all-female Jump5 cover band with far less energy. The rock songs pale in the afterglow of groups like BarlowGirl. Their Disney-esque arrangments may delight preteens but not anyone who wants depth in their lyrics. The silver lining on this album is their duet with Jeff Deyo mostly because it has his signature sound. Album Highlights: \"Carried Away\" - jennifer e. jones\n\nCasting Crowns\n\nThe Altar and The Door\n\nThere’s a reason why Casting Crowns is one of the best Christian bands out today, and that reason is evident when you listen to The Altar and The Door. After three albums, lead singer/songwriter Mark Hall still knows how to speak for those who cannot. “Every Man” hits you right between the eyes as Hall places himself in everyone’s shoes. He paints a hopeful picture of forgiveness on \"East to West\" (i.e., “Can you tell me how far the east is from the west... One scarred hand from the other”) . He still knows how to ask the hard questions as he does on “Somewhere in the Middle” when he says, “Would we trade our dreams for His?” The Altar and The Door leaves plenty of room for the sinners and the saints to come closer to Jesus. Album Highlights: “East to West” and “What This World Needs” - jennifer e. jones\n\nLifesong\n\nWhat a relief to know that Mark Hall hasn’t back down lyrically. While “Lifesong” and “Praise You in This Storm” are full of the usual CCM sentiments, songs like “Does Anybody Hear Her,” “Love Them Like Jesus,” and “While You were Sleeping” go straight to your heart and pull you into deeper levels of loving your neighbor. While they continue to serve up Top 40 pop melodies, they show their diversity in “Prodigal” with a beautiful classical guitar. As good as the first time? Well, Mark’s hard-hitting lyrics may no longer be novel, but they still pack a mean punch. The songs where they go off the beaten CCM trail are worth the second time around. Album Highlights: “Set Me Free,” “Does Anybody Hear Her,” and “Prodigal”\n\nCasting Crowns\n\nRadio hit \"If We Are the Body\" is only the beginning of the rich treasures found on this CD. Read the full review...\n\nCasting Pearls\n\nCasting Pearls\n\nVeterans of the indie scene, Casting Pearls, make a solid showing in their national debut, one that is sure to encourage all listeners to \"Focus\" on God. Fronted by Bryan Olesen, former Newsboys guitarist, this Midwest band blends modern acoustic and high-energy rock along with powerful vocals to give music fans a variety of songs that will not bore. Album Highlights: \"Alright,\" \"All About Love,\" \"Revolution,\" \"Loves Done Something\" - hannah goodwyn\n\nChapman, Steven Curtis\n\nThis Moment\n\nIn addition to a legacy of accolades and achievements, Steven Curtis Chapman is celebrating today -- right now -- on his latest album. His classic CCM sound is heard throughout tracks like “Miracle of the Moment\". He runs the full range of the human experience from walking the streets of London in “Yours” to the joy within the struggles of motherhood on “One Heartbeat at a Time”. Speaking of family, look out for “Cinderella” to catch on as the next big father-daughter song like its predecessor “Butterfly Kisses” by Bob Carlisle. Chapman’s sons, Will and Caleb, are now part of his band, and you can hear their influence on the youthful “Children of God” and “You Are Being Loved”. Definitely a keeper for SCC fans. Album Highlights: “Miracle of the Moment” and “You Are Being Loved” - jennifer e. jones\n\nAll I Really Want for Christmas\n\nThis is everything a Christmas album should be. Rather than falling into the too often used routine of regurgitating a compilation of slightly different renditions of traditional Christmas tunes, Steven has produced an album with a truly nice mix of traditional and original work. You’ll be put in a praising mood with the song, “Angels From The Realm of Glory,” and be getting into the Christmas spirit with “God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen.” Steven’s passion for God and family comes thru loud and clear, which is what makes him Steven Curtis Chapman. Icing on the cake of this work is the delightful storytelling introduction and concluding song by daughter Shaohannah. This album is a must have for any Christmas collection. Album Highlights: \"Angels from the Realm of Glory\" and \"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\" - tim crowley\n\nChasen\n\nShine Through the Stars\n\nChasen Callahan, lead singer of Chasen, states that his band’s goal is to reach people wherever they are. Though other bands with this goal might neutralize their lyrics in order to draw in non-Christians, Chasen’s debut album, Shine Through the Stars, leaves no doubt as to what the band holds as their top priority. With a light rock style, Chasen’s simple praise lyrics are reflective of their time spent writing choruses for their church. The opening track sings, “If it comes down to the world and loving you, I choose you.” Other songs such as “Crazy Beautiful” and “History Tonight” acknowledge the pain of this world while offering the hope of God. Though these lyrics certainly aren’t new to the Christian music world, Chasen does deliver them with admirable skill that, if not inspiring, is still pretty enjoyable to listen to. Highlights: “Crazy Beautiful” and “Drown.”\n\n- bethany duVal\n\nCircleslide\n\nUncommon Days\n\nCircleslide puts on a great live show but lacks a consistent “wow” factor on CD. Tracks like “Gravity” and “Walking on the Waves” are songs of great spiritual significance lyrically, as is most of the album, but musically they simply don’t go far enough. Because several songs sit on the margin, certain ones stand out brilliantly such as the hope-inspiring “Get Up.” The guitar sizzles on “Noah,” where the U2 influences can be heard. Plus, “The Weatherboy (C’mon, C’mon)” lets Gabe Martinez really dig into his vocal depth. The days aren’t terribly uncommon at times but they offer a decent debut nonetheless. Album Highlights: “The Weatherboy (C’mon, C’mon)” and “Get Up” - jennifer e. jones\n\nCollins, Curt\n\nAnother Day\n\nEdgy and original are two words that describe Curt Collins new album Another Day. The album is great for people who are seeking praise & worship, and inspirational songs in one CD. Having a variety of slow, medium, and fast-paced tempo songs, Collins’ music gives listeners lyrics and beats to dance, relax, or worship to. It also includes Collins’ rendition of the Classics \"Blessed Assurance\" and \"Jesus Paid It All.\" Over all, when compared to other Christian artists, Collins’ sound and style is very unique and is truly his own. His fans, past and future, will not be disappointed. Album highlights: \"Shelter Me,\" \"Once Again,\" and \"Jesus Paid It All\" – kimberly a. lilly\n\nConnersville\n\nConnersvine\n\nChris Wilson, the artsy guitarist, and Hunter Smith, the professional football player, wouldn’t strike most as a likely pair, but when they’re singing as a band in the recording studio, every difference is forgotten. In their self-titled album, Connersvine, these young men bring us a soft rock sound very similar to that of Jeremy Camp. The first song, “Glory Be,” introduces a theme of worship that continues through the rest of the album in songs such as “Lay Down” and “Hosanna.” In the middle, listeners will closely identify with the songs “Sacred Mystery,” which speaks of the impossibility of fully knowing God, and “Closely Far Away,” in which Wilson and Smith wrestle with the conundrum of the distance of God’s kingdom and the closeness of His Spirit. Most wouldn’t put these men together, but together they bring a solid message in a format that will be welcomed by listeners of all kinds. Album Highlights: “Glory Be,” “Closely Far Away,” and “Overflow” - bethany duval\n\nCrabb, Jason\n\nJason Crabb Like Christy Nockels, Jason Crabb is not new to the Christian music scene. For years, he and his family (simply known as The Crabb Family) entertained and encouraged audiences with their Southern Gospel sound. Now Jason's stepping out with his first CD as a solo artist. The record is what you'd expect from this southern music lovin', pastor's kid; it's packed full of catchy, country-flavored tunes and energetic Gospel songs. For those who aren't used to the country music genre, the twang might be a little much. All in all, this Dove Award winning artist will do well as a solo artist. Album Highlights: \"Somebody Like Me\" and \"Walk on Water\" - hannah goodwyn\n\nCunningham, Adam\n\nAdam Cunningham\n\nAdam Cunningham couldn’t be normal even if he tried. Although he’s a down-home boy who’s a whole lot of country with a little bit of rock and roll, his self-titled project is unpretentious and close to the heart. Like any debut, there are home runs, and there are a few ground balls. Adam has radio-ready hits in “What Love Can Do” and “One Angel”, while I could do without the bouncy “Come Back”. He mixes love songs for his wife and for his Savior, which is a refreshing trend for new Christian artists. He also pines for the salvation of an old friend on “Friend of Mine”. His worship leader side comes out on songs like “You Are My God” and “Glory Down”. With all that, Adam should be the artist to watch in ’07. Album Highlights: “What Love Can Do” and “Friend of Mine” - jennifer e. jones\n\nD, Barry\n\nBorn to Play\n\nGot jazz? Barry D does. And gospel and R&B too. With his latest jazz instrumental album, Born to Play, Barry D gives you a little bit of everything. A piano prodigy by age eight, Barry has learned a lot along the way. Tracks like \"Going Through\" and \"Take Me Higher\" offer traditional jazz vibes, while songs like \"The Wind\" feel more like smooth R&B. Barry has even mixed in a little Spanish influence with \"Si Usted Tiene Sed\". Although a couple of the original songs missed the mark for me, the majority are good and the covers are impeccable. The 'piece de resistance' is Barry’s cover of \"I Want to Know What Love Is\". It is simply beautiful, and it really takes you back. It’s also one of the only tracks with choral accompaniment. Album Highlights: \"I Want to Know What Love Is\" and \"The Train’s Comin’\" - pilar davis\n\nD'Arcy Carmen\n\nA Place Called Grace\n\nIf you like to listen to music while soaking in the presence of the Lord then Carmen D’Arcy’s debut album, A Place Called Grace is for you. The album is all about worshipping God to the fullest and nothing less. D’Arcy is an experienced worship leader and a gifted song writer, both of which are very evident on the album. She co-wrote ten of its eleven songs. Many of them are authentic love songs to God. “We Adore Thee” and “You’re Beautiful” give thanks to God for his grace and mercy to all. Another song, “Fade” is a reminder that the highest glory and honor is due to God alone. A place Called Grace is a worship album that ranks with the best and it is a must have for all who love to glorify God. Album Highlights: “We Adore Thee,” “You’re Beautiful,” and “You Are Everything.” – kimberly a. lilly\n\nDavid Crowder Band\n\nRemedy Club Tour\n\nThe David Crowder Band released the Remedy Club Tour CD/DVD on August 19, and it is one of those albums you either love or hate. The CD has everything you would expect from the Crowder Band — fun rock songs and cool sing-along lyrics. So if you’re already a die-hard fan of the band, then you are sure to love this album. However, if you’re one of those people that has been waiting for the right DCB song to take you over the edge before declaring yourself a fan, then unfortunately that song is not on this album—nor is it on the DVD. Album Highlights: \"O Praise Him,\" \"No One Like You,\" and \"Surely We Can Change.\" – kimberly a. lilly\n\nRemedy\n\nIt was next to impossible to top the epic A Collision, which landed David Crowder Band on the top of all the “Best of” charts. So, the band did one better… and didn’t even try. Remedy is a completely different animal, shorter in length (a mere 10 tracks) and musically more concise. Gone are the peeks and valleys. Remedy is a quick shot in the arm full of everything you love about DCB. Futuristic worship and a heart that’s bleeding for a Savior to come are the crowning achievements of this album. “Glory of It All” is a welcoming call to dive in. The first single, “Everything Glorious”, is straight Crowder, while “We Won’t Be Quiet” is soon to be the next concert crowd pleaser. Underneath it all is a message that simply says “Jesus is the answer.” It’s thoroughly enjoyable and the healing balm for a hurting world. Album Highlights: “We Won’t Be Quiet”, “Remedy”, and “Glory of It All”- jennifer e. jones\n\nA Collision\n\n\"Innovative worship\" and \"David Crowder Band\" should be synonyms. The Texans bring together all genres to praise the Lord on A Collision. What I love about DCB is that they utilize every instrument in their band to create a unique sound all their own. They can do simple, get-the-youth-group-jumping praise like “Here is Our King” and the melancholy but hopeful “O God Where Are You Now.” You really see DCB’s diversity during “Part B” where they dabble in southern gospel and bluegrass with the help of the fabulous Marty Stuart and his mandolin. Somehow through all the others who dipped in and out of the pop worship trend, DCB has not only stayed in the game but remained on top. A Collision is \"depravity\" meeting \"divinity,\" and yes, it is a \"beautiful collision.\" Too hard to pick album highlights. It’s an experience piece that should be listened to in its entirety with headphones on and hands lifted high. - jennifer e. jones\n\nB Collision\n\nYour need to buy David Crowder Band’s B Collision is directly proportioned to how much of a fan you are. B Collision would more aptly be called A Collision: The Remix, because it’s mostly the same songs with a few twists. More acoustic cuts are done of “Beautiful Collision” and “Wholly Yours.” “Everybody Wants to Go to Heaven” is extended from an intro into a full song. The live versions of “Be Lifted” and “I Saw the Light” are fun but not that much different than the originals. If you can’t get enough of DCB, then by all means, flock to this latest release. But if the seven songs aren’t enough for you, then A Collision was extensive enough to keep you satisfied until the band comes out with new material. Album Highlights: “Beautiful Collision-B Variant”- jennifer e. jones\n\nDay of Fire\n\nCut & Move\n\n“I’m not afraid to show my heart.” This line from “Hole in My Hand” is a truth that’s evident in Josh Brown's gravel-deep vocals as he sings about Christ on Day of Fire’s new album Cut & Move. Their debut self-titled CD was a hard act to follow, but Day of Fire brings it on with even harder guitars and hard-hitting lyrics. For example, the bass lines are deeper and the drums more driving – especially on “Run.” They keep it interesting while never deviating from the sound that made them a breakout artist on the hard rock scene. Album Highlights: “Reborn” and “Hole in My Hand” - jennifer e. jones\n\ndc Talk\n\nJesus Freak: The 10th Anniversary Edition\n\ndc Talk… Even 10 years later, Toby, Michael and Kevin still know how to redefine CCM. The 10th anniversary re-release of Jesus Freak is re-mastered, cleaner, and a Godsend for those of us whose 1995 CDs barely play past “Colored People”. For the Jesus Freak lover, this album has everything: every track from the original that plays as fresh as the first time, live performances of the Beatles’ “Help!”, REM’s “It’s the End of the World (As We Know It)” among others, and modernized make-overs of classic dc Talk songs. Unlike the anti-climactic Freak! (the snooze fest of Jesus Freak covers by Gotee artists), the remixed versions of “So Help Me God”, “Like It, Love It, Need It”, and others transform them into trip-hop, acoustic pop, or acid jazz for the soul. This double-disc delight only proves that dc Talk is and always will be ahead of its time. Album Highlights: “So Help Me God (Savadocious Junk Yard Mix 1974)” and “What Have We Become? (dDubb Remix)”- jennifer e. jones\n\nDecembeRadio\n\nSatisfied\n\nAugust 26 was a great day for rock music lovers, as it is the day DecembeRadio’s new album, Satisfied, was released. The album has a lot of hardcore rock songs that are sure to please young rockers and other songs that will even reach non-rock lovers. The CD is made up of tracks that will encourage and inspire fans, and songs that will surely be satisfying to their ears. Album Highlights includes: \" Love Can,\" \"Be Alright,\" \"Find You Waiting\" – kimberly a. lilly\n\nDecembeRadio\n\nDecembeRadio paves a possible road to crossover success on their debut self-titled album. Their sound (very Bon Jovi meets Nickelback and Default) is backroads rock’n’roll with Christ-centered lyrics. “Drifter” has the country soul guitars and the southern organ that recalls their West Virginian roots. They don’t sound like anything on Christian radio today which may work to their favor. The God-is-comin’-to-get-you track, “Can’t Hide,” and the even tougher “Dangerous” are hard-hitting. “Alright My Friend” is more mellow yet still gripping. Impressive. This band brings Christian rock back to its origins. Album Highlights: “Drifter” and “Alright My Friend” - jennifer e. jones\n\nDelirious?\n\nKingdom of Comfort\n\nSince the debut album in 1996, Delirious? has been a well-known Christian rock band – and for good reason. The newest CD, Kingdom of Comfort, offers listeners yet another album to enjoy. The album gives old fans more classic Delirious? moments, while also adding a grittier guitar sound to the mix. With a relevant message on apathy, the band challenges people to “break the silence” and ask the question “what are we living for?” (see the songs “Break the Silence” and “Kingdom of Comfort”). At times, the album sounds a bit depressing in mood, but overall portrays a message of hope, revolution, and rock and roll. Highlights: “Love Will Find A Way” and “All God’s Children” – amy nickerson\n\nNow Is the Time: Live at Willow Creek, Chicago USA\n\nWorship is really meant to be recorded live over an audience with hands raised high. You feel that on Delirious?’s latest album, Now Is the Time. The UK band came to Chicago’s Willow Creek Community Church to lift up Jesus and play a few of their favorite songs. They get a little raucous (“Paint the Town Red”) but know how to slow it down too (“What a Friend”). After several lackluster covers released by other bands recently, it was a joy to hear Delirious? reclaim “Rain Down” again. Plus, it’s simply splendid how “Every Little Thing” blends right into “I Could Sing of Your Love Forever” and “Take Off My Shoes,” then launches into a larger-than-life rendition of “Majesty.” Now Is the Time is truly a masterpiece of a performance with everything a worship-lover wants. This epic album serves as a reminder that Delirious? is still among the forerunners of modern rock worship. Album Highlights: “Rain Down” and “Our God Reigns” - jennifer e. jones\n\nDeyo, Jeff\n\nSurrender\n\nIt's raw, unabashed worship live. A must-have for worship music lovers and those who own Light or Saturate. After a slew of pop artists wore out the worship trend, Jeff Deyo comes back and displays the passionate adoration for God with musical skill and precision that makes this genre come alive again. Album highlights: \"More Love, More Power\" and \"Bless the Lord\" - jennifer e. jones\n\nDiaz, Jonny\n\nMore Beautiful You by Jonny Diaz INO Records' newest artist Jonny Diaz steps onto the Christian music stage with a solid debut release in More Beautiful You. This singer, songwriter delivers sincere lyrics about life and faith with a pleasant, easy-on-the-ears voice. Listeners can expect to hear tunes reminiscent of Jason Mraz's fun melodies in \"Soon Will Fade\" and “Love Like You Loved”, and a little bit of Rascal Flatts-esque country in \"One Thing\". All and all, it's a good start for this new artist. Album Highlights: \"Soon Will Fade\" and \"Love Like You Loved\" - hannah goodwyn\n\nDijon\n\nFrom a Kid's Point of View\n\nWhile junior soul brothers like Ne-Yo and Chris Brown dominate the R&B charts with meaningless revamped Usher hooks, there is a voice in the wilderness that’s calling out for Christ. Meet the passionate Dijon – the 14-year-old singing sensation. There’s a whole lot of music inside this young talent and his debut, A Kid’s Point of View, is an excellent showcase. I especially give him kudos for a different version of “How Great Is Our God” that’s worthy of the original. Also, the title track speaks the mind of any child suffering through divorce. He is, as his songs say, “a true soldier for God”. Album Highlights: “A Kid’s Point of View” and “How Great Is Our God” - jennifer e. jones\n\nDillon, Bethany\n\nWaking Up\n\nWith her third album, Bethany is waking us up to her staying power, and fans of her breathy vocals and distinctive lyrics will not be disappointed. On tracks such as “Tell Me,” and “Come Find Me,” she displays stirring raw strength and emotion and even delivers a few feel-good love songs (“When You Love Someone” and “You Could Be the One”) that teens will love to dream to. While the album is essentially successful, watch out for a few mildly monotonous tracks, and listen for “The Kingdom,” the driving force behind the album’s power that leaves even the title track in the dust. The most likable element is identifying with lines such as “Teach me how to hunger/’Cause I don’t know the words yet,” showing Bethany’s characteristic longing for truth on this praiseworthy release. Album Highlights: “The Kingdom,” and “You Are On Our Side” - rebekah wilson\n\nImagination\n\nIt’s more teen acoustic pop from the Inspo/AC charter Bethany Dillon. This sophomore release plays like a part two of her self-titled debut. That’s not necessarily a bad thing but it doesn’t exactly imply growth or stretch as an artist. A few songs like “New” and “Hallelujah” are rehashing typical CCM radio. However, “My Love Hasn’t Grown Cold” is smooth and allows Bethany to experiment with a little bit of Norah Jones-esque crooning. Whether you’re expecting more or less from this follow-up, Bethany still gets brownie points for being so talented at so young an age. Album Highlights: “Airplane,” “Dreamer,” and “My Love Hasn’t Grown Cold” - jennifer e. jones\n\nDisciple\n\nSouthern Hospitality\n\nDisciple's Southern Hospitality has a welcoming start that almost departs from the band's holy scream-fest, mosh-worthy origins. The title song rolls along the same southern hard rock tracks as DecembeRadio. However, it doesn't stay there for long. \"Romance Me\" is almost emo, and by the sixth song, Disciple is back to its old habits. The chorus of \"Phoenix Rising\" sounds a lot like its first single, \"The Wait Is Over\". It's good, but we've heard it before. Hardcore fans of the band will probably dig into this new release; however, I'm still holding tight to their far more superior (and cohesive) sophomore album, Scars Remain. Album Highlights: \"Southern Hospitality\" – jennifer e. jones\n\nScars Remain\n\nThe wait is over for Disciple fans who couldn’t be satisfied with the scream-fest that was their last self-titled release. Scars Remain is serious metal that may leave you with some flesh wounds, but you’ll be better for it in the end. Front man Kevin Young’s voice pierces through every track like a sword. The words “This is what I want / for you to die” run through the chorus of the opening track, “Regime Change”, and set the tone for the rough’n’tumble rock romp. The guys use brute force on “Game On”, yet, they get downright sentimental on their ballads (i.e., “I arrange the light of your first day / I create the rhythm your heart makes” on the divine love song “After the World”). Disciple delivers a surprisingly thoughtful album that still rocks. Album Highlights: “Game On” and \"My Hell\" - jennifer e. jones\n\nDJ Maj\n\nBoogiRoot\n\nIt’s time to get back to the BoogiRoot. DJ Maj assembled an all-star cast to help him out on his fourth album. From the Verbs to LA Symphony to Mars Ill’s manChild, it’s a parade of rappers slinging decent rhymes on funky rhythms. In spite of the multitude of collaborators, BoogiRoot has a consistent flow that doesn't drop the ball from track to track. Maj also manages to stay true to his own sound while still highlighting the best of the visiting MCs (i.e., tobyMac’s “Can’t Take It Away” sounds like a bonus track off of Diverse City). Get up with the deep beats of \"uAppeal” or groove with “Soul Window.” It’s all good through and through. Album Highlights: “Gotta Go Now” and “Love (So Beautiful)\" featuring Liquid Beats, “Soul Window” featuring MOC and Ayiesha Woods, and “uAppeal” featuring manChild and Special ED - jennifer e. jones\n\nDownhere\n\nWide-Eyed and Mystified\n\nAfter five years, Downhere hits its stride with Wide-Eyed and Mystified. The lyrics are on point; their sound is fuller, and Marc Martel’s unique vocals have never sounded better. “The More” stands out as the first track and radio single for good reason. It rocks the hardest with a fun beat and a chorus that begs you to sing along. They weigh the balance between rock guitar and melodic piano well with a consistent rhythm throughout the entire project. Tracks such as the acoustic, thought-provoker “1,000 Miles Apart” and the powerful “Surrender” show the band is finally comfortable in their own musical skin. After one listen, fans will fully understand what Downhere means when they sing, “I’m here to testify / It’s been an amazing ride with You.” Album Highlights: \"The More\" and \"1,000 Miles Apart\" - jennifer e. jones\n\nDriscoll, Phil\n\nDrops of Praise\n\nPhil Driscoll is more than just a trumpeter. His voice resounds with the experience of over 30 years in the music business. With Joe Cocker grittiness and a soulful yearning like early Mylon Lefevre, Driscoll offers an album that mixes all of his styles into one. There’s blues (“True Love Cannot Hide”), bossa nova (“Love Unchanging”), gospel (“Drops of Praise”) and everything in between. “I Will Dance” is a back-porch-on-a-summer-day, reflective ballad about the passing of a loved one. He put the traditional worship song “Lord I Give You My Heart” to a mellow jazz tune. Overall, Drops of Praise is an excellent watermark in an already remarkable career. Album Highlights: “Capital,” “True Love Cannot Wait,” and “Beautiful” - jennifer e. jones\n\nBryan Duncan & the NehoSoul Band\n\nA NehoSoul Christmas\n\nIt’s blue-eyed soul for the holiday season as Bryan Duncan and his NehoSoul Band serve up a few Christmas classics. He gives old school songs like “Silent Night” and “Winter Wonderland” a jazzy spin, and he is in his groove on “Christmas Time is Here.” With only ten songs, it’s a little short, and it flows so well you don’t want the party to end so soon. You gotta love the carefree, debt-glorifying melody of “Christmas Comes But Once a Year,” and Bryan Duncan’s own “This Christmas” (“Treat every soul like it was Christmas”). Great holiday fun! Album Highlights: “Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas” and “Christmas Time is Here” - jennifer e. jones\n\nFalling Up\n\nCaptiva\n\nWhile listening to the fourth release from Falling Up, I found myself wondering, “Where’s the punch?” These new songs lack the excitement that we’ve come to expect from the BEC recording artists. They’re still good though. “The Dark Side of Indoor Meets” has a ghost-like quality about it. However, there are no tracks like “Moonlight” or “ Broken Heart” that just get inside your head and refuse to come out. Songs such as the title track have the band exploring their electronic, down-tempo side. True fans of Falling Up will embrace the shift while those looking for another record full of radio hits should keep looking. Album Highlights: “The Dark Side of Indoor Meets” and “Capitva” - jennifer e. jones\n\nDawn Escapes\n\nPiano melodies interwoven in dark guitar riffs have always been Falling Up’s signature, and Dawn Escapes gives more of what their fans adore. Hats off to the boys for having one of the coolest album covers of the year. However, this album’s main downfall is the lack of standout hits like last year’s “Bittersweet.” Every song bleeds into the next without a clear, strong winner. Hardcore Falling Up followers should dig it but newbies should buy their first album, Crashing, for a proper introduction. Album Highlights: “Into the Gravity,” “Moonlight” and “Contact” - jennifer e. jones\n\nFamily Force 5\n\nDance or Die\n\nThis sophomore effort from Family Force 5 is a mixed bag. On the one hand, every song is full of energy and guaranteed to get you dancing. On the other hand, the band veers from their signature style somewhat and fans looking for lyrical depth won’t find much here. What they will find is a plethora of synthesizers and an electronic sound reminiscent of the 80s. Most of the tracks explore themes of love (\"The First Time\"), heartbreak (\"Share it with Me\"), or dancing (\"Dance or Die,\" \"‘Rip it Up\"). However, a few songs (\"Radiator,\" \"Wake the Dead’) do offer more spiritual connotations. There are no overt Christian lyrics here, but perhaps that is the appeal for many FF5 fans. The band diligently avoids hitting listeners over the head with a spiritual message. If funky dance tunes are what you’re craving, you'll love this rock party. Album Highlights: “Wake the Dead” “The First Time,” and “Radiator” – belinda elliott\n\nBusiness Up Front... Party in the Back\n\nBuckle up and brace yourself for ATL’s Family Force 5. From the start, you’re caught up in a crazy mix of tricked out rap metal with plenty of crunk. Not since 4th Avenue Jones have I heard such a genre-breaking band on a CCM label. FF5 announces their presence with force on the opening track “Cadillac Phunque.” “My mama raised me in the dirty south” is their anthem on “Kountry Gentlemen,” and songs like “Love Addict” and “Earthquake” promise that this band rocks a live show. It is light on the Christianese, which may unnerve parents but rest assured that the message of a man’s need for Christ is clear in “Replace Me” (“Make me what you want me to be / I am yours for you to use”). Business Up Front, Party in the Back… much better than a mullet. Album Highlights: “Kountry Gentlemen,” “Earthquake,” and “Put Ur Hands Up” - jennifer e. jones\n\nFee\n\nWe Shine\n\nFee draws you in before you’re even aware that you’re tapping your foot to the beat. The youth-group-oriented Georgia band already earned buzz through the Passion conferences, and it shows when you listen to the bouncy rock/pop of We Shine. It’s hyperactive worship music in the same vein as David Crowder Band and Hillsong United. The title track alone is enough to make you stand up and dance. You can’t escape the joy that bubbles over on “Happy Day”. By the same token, “Burn For You” details a desire for Christ without shame. There’s no doubt that these guys love God, love what they do and want to share it all with you. Such enthusiasm and talent deserves two thumbs up. Album Highlights: “We Shine” and “Happy Day” - jennifer e. jones\n\nFFH\n\nStill the Cross\n\nThe band’s newest offering provides a mixture of the funky pop that FFH fans have come to love along with a few more mellow ballads. Read the full review...\n\nVoice From Home\n\nFFH attempts to capture God speaking to His children. This idea is a great one, but the results are slightly disappointing. In their efforts, the band oversimplifies God’s attributes. The messages in all the songs are hopeful and encouraging, but I was hoping for lyrics that would dig a little deeper. The band also differs from the toe-tapping folk music of previous albums, opting for a more piano-driven pop sound. While their previous albums are better suited to my taste, this album does provide an important message -- that both God’s faithfulness and His love for us are immeasurable. Album Highlights: “Grand Canyon,” “The Only Hand You Need,” and “Worth It All” - belinda elliott\n\nFiction Family (Jon Foreman & Sean Watkins)\n\nFiction Family\n\nFiction Family has a bit of a folk music twist. Listeners are introduced to the album with an acoustic intro by Jon Foreman and guitarist Sean Watkins. I found myself in deep thinking trying to take in the metaphoric lyrics. “When She’s Near” gives off a sweet, steady melody that is pleasant to the listeners. It’s a perfect illustration of “puppy love”. “Out of Order” carries the album in another direction, brining forth counteractive rhythms that shift the mind in different modes. The music is a perfect reflection of disorder. “Please Don’t Call it Love” shifted my mind in a peculiar mode as Jon Foreman sings from his heart about what he believes to be love. Look for My Baby ends the album with a classic rock n roll twist. Listeners of Fiction Family will definitely enjoy what this new album has to offer. - ashley card\n\nFighting Instinct\n\nFighting Instinct\n\nThis self-titled album from southern rock band Fighting Instinct is a must get for all rockers out there. The extraordinary talents of guitarist/lead singer T.J. Harris, drummer Dallas Farmer, and bassist Jason Weekly has the potential to make all 10 original songs hits. Harris’ strong, pure rock voice and amazing guitar riffs give the band a impressive start with this debut CD. Influences from great rock legends Lynyrd Skynyrd and Jimi Hendrix and the band’s strong faith message and worshipful lyrics set them apart. “My Heart Cries Out” rocks an expression of real passion for our God. The band also shows beautiful melodies and soft rock sounds in “Crush” and “Back To You.” Album Highlights: “You Don’t Know,” “Just To Please You,” and “You Found Me First” - hannah goodwyn\n\nFlatfoot 56\n\nKnuckles Up\n\nPut up your dukes. Flatfoot 56 is coming to town. I guarantee you haven’t heard anything quite as raucous under the Christian mantel. The four-man band, complete with thrashing guitars, bagpipes, and a mandolin, march onto the Flicker Records label with maddening Scottish punk/metal that’s an assault on your senses. But that’s a good thing. From the moral lessons in the title track to the irreverent \"Holdfast,\" Knuckles Up is as close to authentic punk rock as you’ll get while still giving glory to God. You see the heart behind the moshing especially on “The Rotten Hand” (“My Father’s got a plan for my life / So now I follow Him with my back turned from sin / Lead me on my Father Adonai”). It’s an amazing piece of work. This album should come with a warning though: Not for the timid listener. Hardcore punk fans only. Album Highlights: “Rotten Hand” and “Knuckles Up” - jennifer e. jones\n\nFlyleaf\n\nFlyleaf\n\nAfter their EP climbed the rock charts, Flyleaf finally shows us what they’re made of with the release of their self-titled full-length album. Immediately what grabs you about Flyleaf is the twisted soprano singing of Lacey Mosley. She’s not afraid to give a hard rock scream although she’s half the size of her male bandmates. The band bares their faith with dark lyrics like “I tried to kill you / You tried to save me.” Listeners get the hit songs “Red Sam” and “Breathe Today” (although I like the EP version better) along with new music including “There For You,” which features Dave Navarro on guitar. Musically, Flyleaf offers little above its contemporaries, but this album is worth a buy for Mosley's voice alone. Album Highlights: “Cassie” and “I’m So Sick” - jennifer e. jones\n\nFM Static\n\nCritically Ashamed\n\nIt’s time for fun pop-punk again! FM Static returns with Critically Ashamed. The fact that they don’t take themselves too seriously helps this tongue-in-cheek album be entertaining. The nearly nonsensical love story of “Video Store” is just what those TRL teeny-boppers want. They actually point out some real life ironies in “Flop Culture” (such as pseudo-\"Sk8r Girl\" Avril Lavigne posing in men’s magazines). “Waste of Time” is spiritually tinged and offers the lost a chance to be loved just as they are (“I’ll be everything that you want me to / Except for perfect”). FM Static fans should be pleased. Album Highlights: “Flop Culture” and “Waste of Time” - jennifer e. jones\n\nFoolish Things\n\nEven Now\n\nThough it was released independently, the powerful lyrics and catchy melodies on this sophomore album from Foolish Things make it worthy of attention. The song’s title track \"Even Now\" is a beautiful reminder that God’s love and care for us remains constant regardless of our circumstances. \"He hasn’t left you out to dry, even now. You haven’t left his watchful eye, even now,\" the song says. It encourages us to remember that \"when we don’t see how, My Father is worthy of my hope even now.\" Other powerful tracks include \"Love Chained Me Here,\" a love song written from God’s perspective and the energetic \"Who’d You Put in Charge,\" about who we let control our lives. It is rare that I enjoy all the songs on an album, but every song this album offers reflects both the depth of the band’s talent as well as their passion for God. This is a band to watch! Highlights: \"Even Now\" and \"Keep Us Together.\" - belinda elliott\n\nForeman, Jon\n\nLimbs and Branches\n\nA compilation of choice tracks from his Seasons collection, Limbs and Branches holds the best of Switchfoot frontman Jon Foreman's solo work. His most popular songs from his Fall, Winter, Spring, and Summer EPs are included, along with two new tunes, \"Broken From the Start\" and \"Over the River.\" Fans of the progressive Seasons CDs may not love this one as much as it’s a bit all over the place since Jon’s songs are mix-matched on the album. Still, what's not to love about his poetic, folksy vibe and personal vocal vision? Album highlights: “The Cure for Pain,” “Your Love is Strong,” “Resurrect Me.” - hannah goodwyn\n\nSummer EP\n\nJon Foreman easily pulls off Summer, his fourth and last EP in his Seasons collection. Connecting it with the other three albums to provide fans with a complete look at a year works well. However, the solo EP also proves to be a success in its own right. With songs on themes such as resurrection, true substance, and everlasting life, this album offers a hopeful look at what’s to come (“The House of God Forever”), while also challenging believers to trade in their shows and religious games for what is real (“Instead of a Show”). Jon Foreman is honest, bold, and full of creativity in this album of acoustic tunes and soft ballads that any fan will enjoy. Album Highlights: “A Mirror is Harder to Hold” and “Instead of a Show” – amy nickerson\n\nSpring EP\n\nSince 1997 when the first Switchfoot album came out, Jon Foreman has been an obvious talent. This third acoustic EP in Foreman’s new solo collection proves what many have already known – Jon is not only a gifted rocker, but also a poetic genius. With a sound much like Bob Dylan’s and thoughtful lyrics pulled straight from Scripture, this CD is sure to capture the attention of many. Spring is an artistic look at love and new life that is sometimes melancholy, but always deep. Album Highlights: “Your Love Is Strong” and “Baptize My Mind” – amy nickerson\n\nWinter EP\n\nI must admit I was a bit skeptical when I heard Switchfoot frontman Jon Foreman was releasing a series of solo EPs based on the four seasons. It just sounded too self-indulgent. But I must confess, Winter is a winning disc. Featuring a musical sparseness reminiscent of a cold winter’s day, Foreman delivers six strong tracks that are very clear about where he stands on faith. Unlike Switchfoot, there are no vague lyrics to be found. Especially strong is “Learning How to Die”, a song about how we were created to be in Heaven, not earth, and “Somebody’s Baby”, a tale of a homeless woman’s downward spiral from hopefulness to death. If you are expecting Switchfoot, don’t bother to pick this up. But if you are looking for music that is real and brutally honest, then Winter is for you. Album Highlights: “Learning How to Die” and “Somebody’s Baby” - chris carpenter\n\nFall EP\n\nJon Foreman is the mastermind songwriter behind Switchfoot. So it’s no surprise that his solo EP, Fall, is a lyrical delight. Six songs are just enough to chew on as Foreman takes you on a road trip through his mind. He’s forever longing for heaven on earth with songs such as “The Cure for Pain”, and his view of humanity’s duality on “Equally Skilled” is both chilling and revealing. This is the perfect way to spend that iPod gift card. Album Highlights: “Equally Skilled” and “Southbound Train” - jennifer e. jones\n\nFranklin, Kirk\n\nThe Fight of My Life\n\nThere's a struggle going on within Kirk Franklin, and it's transparent on his latest album. While The Rebirth of Kirk Franklin and Hero stand an inch or two taller than this record, The Fight of My Life still has plenty of reach. The first single \"Declaration (This Is It)\" is an urban gospel war cry that will raise up the warrior inside of you. \"Jesus\" is like a throwback jersey with its comfortable, hip grooves. However, I could do without the watered down \"Hide Me\". tobyMac makes a splendid appearance on the rocked out \"I Am God\". This is definitely a pick-me-up to those in the valley and a reminder that God is the only one who gets you through. Album Highlights: \"Declaration (This Is It)\" and \"Jesus\" - jennifer e. jones\n\nHero\n\nHe’s the most famous non-singing singer in CCM, and now Kirk Franklin raises the bar for urban gospel on Hero. I miss the “live” feeling of previous albums like The Rebirth but overall it’s a much cleaner recording. As usual he’s ready to move seamlessly between mainstream R&B and Christian radio with songs like “Sunshine” and “Better.” Vocally, Kirk’s choir is stronger than ever and has perfected their harmonizing since the last album. As if his singers weren’t enough, he sought the help of other gospel greats such as Fred Hammond, Yolanda Adams, and J Moss to name a few. With the salvation message tucked into the “Brokenhearted reprise,” this album has set yet another standard for the rest of Christian music to chase after. Album Highlights: \"Sunshine,\" \"Keep Your Head\" and \"Looking for You\"\n\nFraser, Brook\n\nAlbertine\n\nAlbertine. That is the title of Brook Fraser’s second album. The New Zealand native sings with so much depth in her lyrics that it is easy to write the album off as boring on the first listen. However, with the second listen you get a better understanding of what she is singing about. “Albertine,” a song on the album (and its title) is about an orphan Fraser met while visiting Rwanda. After seeing the way of life in the nation devastated by genocides, Fraser sings of her responsibility to help. In another song, “Faithful,” she tells of how she has learned to seek God even when his presence is not felt. For a 19 year old, Fraser seems to have a great amount of wisdom, which is displayed in every song. Though this album is her second, it is her first to be released in the U.S., but I doubt that it will be her last. Her sound is different in a good way and is a good pick for those who are tired of the norm. Album Highlights: “Shadow feet,” “Faithful, and “Deciphering Me.” – kimberly a. lilly\n\nThe Fray\n\nThe Fray\n\nPeaking at the No.1 spot of the Top Modern Rock/Alternative Albums Billboard chart, this new self-titled record from The Fray is a solid soundtrack. Famous for their previous hit \"How to Save a Life\", The Fray showcase their talent on a new track called \"You Found Me,\" which has already gained popularity on the radio and online. Its honest lyric and strong melody compels you to sing along. Unfortunately, this new album has a weakness: the lack of variety from track to track. Listeners may find it hard to distinguish between a few of the songs; they are too alike. Album Highlights: \"You Found Me,\" \"Syndicate,\" and \"Happiness.\" - hannah goodwyn\n\nFree Chapel Worship Center\n\nMoving Forward\n\nWhen Moving Forward kicked off with “Great God”, I thought I was in for another rousing, yet typical worship album. However, Israel Houghton, Ricardo Sanchez and all of Free Chapel Worship Center were just warming up. Give this album some time, and it will truly set something a’blaze in your soul. By the sixth track, “I Call Your Name”, I was worshipping along with the enrapturing praise. “My Nation Healed” goes off on a holy call for the countries of the world to come to Christ. And the Latin grooves on “Celebrate” will get your feet moving. This is the perfect gift for someone who loves vivacious corporate worship. Album Highlights: “My Nation Healed” and “I Call Your Name” - jennifer e. jones\n\nFreeman, Ronnie\n\nGod Speaking\n\nNashville-based worship leader Ronnie Freeman is back with his sophomore album. The pop Christian artist released his debut project five years ago, and this one is just as powerful. Focusing on the struggles we sometimes face while walking out our faith, as well as the freedom that Christ offers, Freeman’s rich voice and smooth melodies provide hope and encouragement. Quite a skilled song-writer, Freeman’s lyrics are the strength of this album. Listeners may recognize the title track, \"God Speaking,\" which American Idol finalist, Mandisa, also recorded on True Beauty. Other songs that pack a spiritual punch are the guitar-driven \"Breakaway,\" and the inspirational \"The Other Side.\" Freeman’s songs provide a great opportunity to allow God to search our hearts and to spend time reflecting on where we are in our walk with Christ. Other album highlights: \"My Inheritance,\" with Watermark’s Christy Nockels and \"Sober Me.\" - belinda elliott\n\nHall, Charlie\n\nThe Bright Sadness\n\nThe Bright Sadness is the name of latest CD from recording artist Charlie Hall. The greatness within this album is found in the lyrics of each song. Hall is very detailed within his lyric, passionate, and more importantly he sings the Word of God. However, when sound is considered it’s easy to realize that there is no variety on the album, as many of the songs sound very similar. Because of the close similarity of songs, the album will become boring to listeners really quick. It is Hall’s monotone voice that will lead listeners down the road of boredom and possibly cause The Bright Sadness to be ejected from CD players and replace with something more appeasing to the ear. Album Highlight: \"Mystery,\" and \"Walk The World\" – kimberly a. lilly\n\nFlying Into Daybreak\n\nThree years have passed since the Christian music scene heard anything new from singer/songwriter Charlie Hall. So it is good to now realize his new album, Flying into Daybreak, was worth the wait. Charlie’s Spirit-sensitive lyrics capture the heart of his walk with God on this 12-track CD, entirely written by him. Declarations of God’s consuming love and beauty are in surplus on this contemporary worship treasure. Marching band-like beats call a people who are willing to take hold of their destinies and the work needed on this earth. His passionate love songs to Jesus and “on your feet” praise make this must-hear music. Album Highlights: “Sum of Beautiful,” “All My Love,” “Running with Your Heart,” and “Come For Me” - hannah goodwyn\n\nHart, Sarah\n\nInto These Rooms\n\nRemember how that first breeze of Spring feels coming through your window? That's what listening to Into These Rooms feels like. Sarah Hart is a breath of fresh air into contemporary music with her sweet vocals and warm acoustic melodies that wrap around you like an old quilt. Each song is thoroughly pleasing to the ear and musically well crafted down to the last note. Whether she's praising God in \"So We Will Worship\" or pleading for His help in \"Be With Me, Lord,\" Sarah Hart reveals her delicate heart on this album. I can only hope the rest of the world sees its beauty. Album Highlights: “His Name is Joseph” and “Brave New World” - jennifer e. jones\n\nHawk Nelson\n\nHawk Nelson is My Friend\n\nThese Canadians pop-rockers get high scores for this, their third, CD. It is their best yet. It’s classic Hawk Nelson with powerful lyrics set to tunes featuring high-energy electric guitar and drum rhythms, and pleasant surprises like the Ramones-esque shouts in “Friend Like That”. Lead singer Jason Dunn’s strong vocals work in tandem with bring-the-house-down beats that will compel your feet to tap and head to bang to their impressive melodies. – hannah goodwyn\n\nSmile, It's the End of the World\n\nDon’t let the album’s title confuse you. It sounds pessimistic, but really, it’s a clever way to remind us to hold on to happiness despite our circumstances. In “One Thing I Have Left,” the lyrics remind me of the childhood saying “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words will never hurt me.” Several songs touch on difficult topics, but overall spiritual undertones are subtle and somewhat rare. So don’t expect this album to become your next favorite worship collection. Still, I enjoy how these guys don’t take themselves too seriously, but also successfully cover subjects like suicide and feelings of abandonment. I imagine their teenage fans can certainly relate to their music, especially the piano-driven ballad “Zero.” I hope to see even more maturing the next go-round. Album Highlights: “Zero,” “Everything You Ever Wanted,” “Something on My Mind” - andrea d. hicks\n\nHawkins, Walter\n\nA Song in My Heart\n\nThe \"Godfather of Gospel\", Bishop Walter Hawkins, takes us to church with his latest offering. With legendary strong vocals, he sticks close to his traditional gospel roots, especially on the \"Staple Singers Tribute (Help Me Jesus)\". As old school as it sounds, A Song still has a few surprises including the hidden hymn on \"All I Know\". Album Highlights: \"Highest Praise,\" \"A Song in My Heart\" - jennifer e. jones\n\nHeath, Brandon\n\nWhat if We\n\nKnown for his hit, “I’m Not Who I Was”, singer-songwriter Brandon Heath is back with a new set of potential radio favorites. His new song, “Give Me Your Eyes”, has already gained popularity on the charts, peaking at #1 on Billboard’s “Hot Christian Songs” list and staying at the top for the past fourteen weeks. This Dove award winner knows just how to get a listener’s attention with his inspirational lyrics and catchy beats. A plus on this Brandon’s sophomore album, is “Sore Eyes”, a new tune recorded with Jars of Clay. Album Highlights: “Sore Eyes”, “Give Me Your Eyes”, “Wait and See”, “London” and more – hannah goodwyn\n\nDon't Get Comfortable\n\nWhen Brandon Heath’s debut album, Don’t Get Comfortable, first came across my desk, I thought, ‘Just what the world needs: one more guitar-playing singer/songwriter.’ Perhaps that’s true, but the world definitely needs Brandon Heath. His simple approach to acoustic adult contemporary music puts him in the same league as Warren Barfield and other treasures of CCM. “Steady Now,” Heath’s mid-tempo confessional, is the first track to catch your attention. There he sings, “We don’t have to wait until the end of the night / Just to say that something’s wrong and maybe nobody’s right.” The uplifting “Our God Reigns” is a nice foray into praise and worship. By the album’s end, you’ll admit too that Heath has a nice launching pad to take off into what looks like a promising career. Album Highlights: “Steady Now” and “Let’s Make It Last” - jennifer e. jones\n\nHeller, J.J.\n\nOnly Love Remains\n\nThink of lyrics that swim in a deep ocean of melancholy hope and you’ll get a hint of what J.J. Heller is all about. Her brand of mellow acoustic folk/pop makes her a blend of Sara Groves and Sarah Hart. She reminds us of how amazing grace truly is in “Thank You.” The variety of lonely hearts she displays is touching on “Love Me.” Heller is not afraid to sing the way she thinks with an honesty that stings a little. Certain tracks like “Make Believe” make Heller a storyteller reminiscent of Jewel on Pieces of You. Without a lot of fuss and flare, Heller delivers a strong album for those who like their music quietly stirring. Album Highlights: “Love Me” and “When I Leave” - jennifer e. jones\n\nHill, Kim\n\nBroken Things\n\nThirteen albums later and Kim Hill still never ceases to amaze us. Like a female John Mellencamp, the Memphis-raised Hill has found a voice in deep, gritty Southern rock. This time around on Broken Things, she aims for the wounded hearts. She offers hope for the woman who’s killing herself to be perfect on “A Million Pieces.” “Wide” gives similar reassurance as she sings, “Nothing could lessen the weight of her sin / Or the bruises she gave herself carrying them… I wish she could see / He’s never left her.” Hill writes some of her own songs but gets good help from talents like Marc Byrd (Third Day), Kate Miner and Jill Phillips. With skill like Hill’s, she’ll turn 13 back into a lucky number. Album Highlights: “A Million Pieces” and “Wide” - jennifer e. jones\n\nHillsong\n\nCelebrating Christmas\n\nThe great aspect of a Hillsong Christmas album is that Darlene Zschech has a team of talented singers and musicians to work with. That makes for an diverse collection of holiday songs that glorify the birth of Christ. The acoustic instrumental of “O Come, O Come Emmanuel” warms your soul like a fireplace. They favor big band jazz on “God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen”, yet release their soulful side on the calming “Hark the Herald Angels Sing”. The original “O Rejoice” resounds with the worship sounds that made the Australian praise team so popular. I’m thoroughly impressed with Hillsong’s way of Celebrating Christmas. Album Highlights: “God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen” and “O Come, O Come Emmanuel” - jennifer e. jones\n\nMighty To Save\n\nIn a sea of worship albums and praise songs, you really need to rise above the mundane to craft a song that will be sung in churches across the world. It’s a tall order but that seems to be Hillsong’s specialty. Darlene Zschech leads the Aussie ministry team into another quality live CD full of catchy songs to liven up your worship experience. It’s tough to keep your feet still during “The Freedom We Know” as they sing, “Our broken dreams have life again.” “Adonai” (not to be confused with the song by Avalon) also rocks but it’s the softer melodies like “At the Cross” that drive this album. For example, “Found” lightly welcomes you into a calming holy presence. Hardcore worship fans will revel in this release. Album Highlights: “The Freedom We Know” and “Found” - jennifer e. jones\n\nHillsong London\n\nHail to the King\n\nIf you are already a Hillsong fan, than I am sure you’ll love Hillsong London’s recent release entitled, Hail to the King. On the hand, if you’re not already a Hillsong fan, than this is not the album to bring you over the fence. The CD features a variety of tunes with slow and upbeat tempos, along with lyrics that exalt and worship King Jesus. Yet, it has nothing unique or fresh about it that you wouldn’t expect from a band with “Hillsong” in the front of it’s name. Nonetheless, though the album is slacking when it comes to uniqueness, that does not take away from the fact that it’s does provide good worship music and because of that you should give it a listen. Album Highlights: “You Brought Me Home,” “Hail to the King” and “I’m Not Ashamed” – kimberly a. lilly\n\nJesus Is: Remix\n\nHillsong London jumps in the mix with its remix album of 2006’s Jesus Is. The thumping techno beats whirl around you on 12 electronic worship songs. The ambient intro to “Lord of All” gets you in the mood with praise-worthy deep grooves. “Follow the Son” is straight out of an ‘80s video game soundtrack for anyone feeling nostalgic. The tempo gets down for “Where the Love Lasts” and “Above All”. All the while, you get the same wide open faith that you expect from a Hillsong production. For newbies to this genre, this is an inspiring introduction. Album Highlights: “Lord of All” and “Jesus Is” - jennifer e. jones\n\nHillsong United\n\nAll of the Above\n\nHillsong United is well on its way to superseding the impact of Darlene Zschech and its elder Aussies. Fourteen-tracks strong, All of the Above is the truest definition of modern rock worship. As they sing, “Call us out / Let the world see / You are God” on “Point of Difference”, you get an accurate picture of what this youth group band is all about. Their songs are excellent illustrations of their passion. “Break Free” does just that as the guitars rip through the track. Then the chords whisper within ballads “Desperate People” and “Draw Me Closer”. High-energy and strictly vertical, this album is another great movement of Hillsong United’s mission to light this generation on fire for Christ. Album Highlights: \"Break Free\" and “Lead Me to the Cross” - jennifer e. jones\n\nHoughton, Israel\n\nLive: A Deeper Level\n\nIf there ever was a praise anthem composer for the new millennium, my vote would be for Israel Houghton. “Again I Say Rejoice” and “You Are Good” are staples in a lively church. Now Houghton returns from his previous South African album to A Deeper Level. He manages to stay on the platform he’s built for himself with great, high energy songs you will inevitably hear in your church over the next year. “Say So” is classic Houghton with a chorus that rings through the rafters. In between the radio-ready praise songs, there is plenty of spontaneous, Upton-esque worship. The gentle melody of “So Come” is an instant call to the throne room. It’s rare to find but this songbird can do no wrong. Album Highlights: “Say So” and “So Come” - jennifer e. jones\n\nHughes, Tim\n\nHolding Nothing Back\n\n\"Wait, didn’t Matt Redman write ‘Here I Am to Worship?” Although many people believe that, the author is actually a fellow Brit—worship leader Tim Hughes. His third and latest album, Holding Nothing Back, is another mixture of heart-felt worship and celebrations, keeping in focus all Jesus has done for us, as with the upbeat single “Happy Day.” But he doesn’t just stop there! As the title suggests, Tim pushes past mere commitment to God in favor of total surrender in every part of life with songs like “Everything” and the title track. Several are the result of collaborations with Delirious frontman Martin Smith and guitarist Stu G. Look for more fabulous worship hits from this album to make the “Now playing at ‘your church’ this Sunday morning” status. Album Highlights: “Everything,” “Happy Day,” and “Clinging to the Cross.” - rebekah wilson\n\nHyper Static Union\n\nLifegiver\n\nHyper Static Union is hard rock with soul. If it doesn’t sound plausible, just listen to their bass lines. You don’t find this kinda funk in your everyday Christian rock band. The flagship band off of Rocketown’s new rock imprint, RKT Music, mixes it up from track to track. “Right Where You Want Me” takes me back to the beginning days of ‘80s new wave ballads. Songs like “Can’t Leave It Alone” could double as good samples for hip-hop artists. They are unapologetically Christian in their lyrics, and if they keep this up, they can continue to sing, “This funky light of my salvation / I’ve got to let it shine” for many years to come. Album Highlights: “Can’t Leave It Alone” and “Praying for Sunny Days” - jennifer e. jones\n\nMaher, Matt\n\nEmpty and Beautiful\n\nMatt Maher’s Empty and Beautiful is one of the best new albums I’ve heard this year. The album was released on April 8 and is sure to be a favorite of all who hear it. Joyful upbeat songs such as “Your Grace Is Enough,” “Look Like A Fool,” “Great Things” and “Shine Like The Son” are bound to have you on your feet leaping around praising God. Similarly, the songs “As It Is In Heaven,” “Leave A Light On,” “Unwavering” and “Lay It Down” will quickly lead you into a quiet place of worship. “Empty and Beautiful” is an album that is fun and one that has something for everyone. It will not disappoint! Album Highlights: The entire CD! – kimberly a. lilly\n\nMandisa\n\nTrue Beauty\n\nRefreshing and revealing, thought-provoking and truthful, Mandisa’s debut release True Beauty is an absolute delight. Stellar vocals and a rich full musical sound add to the pure joy of a CD that reflects the heart of a woman who has found the love of Jesus in the midst of heart-wrenching pain. I’d like to give this CD to everyone I know with the words, “Listen to this. This is what Jesus is all about.” If you only buy one new CD this year, make it this one. Buy it for yourself and buy it for someone you love. Album Highlights: \"God Speaking\" - linda michaels\n\nManic Drive\n\nRest & Rewind\n\nIn their latest album, Reset & Rewind, Manic Drive has managed to beat the sophomore lull and turn out an album sure to be a favorite. Though the messages are traditional, the band doesn’t hold back in how these messages are presented. In “Obvious” they challenge listeners to deepen their faith, singing, “Sing your melodies, but would you ever think to die for it, like many men who have devoted their whole lives for it?” For those already on their way, but unsure of where to go next, “Eleven Regrets” vents the frustration of loving God and having nothing left to offer. After the harder material that makes up most of the album, listeners will be happy for the 11th (“L-O-V-E”) and 13th (“The Inventor”) tracks, which let up for some light praise. Though decidedly a rock album, Reset & Rewind has a little something for everyone. Highlights: “Obvious,” “December Mourning,” and “L-O-V-E\"- bethany duval\n\nMars Ill\n\nPro Pain\n\n“This ain’t just a rhyme / It slips into your skin.” The words of manCHILD properly sum up the long-awaited Gotee Records release Pro Pain. After a year of stalling and false starts, Mars Ill finally unleashes a powerful album. In raw hip-hop beats that sample old school soul (“I Is”), rock guitars (“Glam Rock”), and ‘70s bass lines (“Say So”), the duo describe life stuck in between greatness and reality. Honesty about fame's rough side in “Dog Ear Page” and “The Moment” give this reviewer more respect for the men who added essential bricks the foundation of Christian rap. You have to dig deep for the spiritual content but songs like “When Heaven Scrapes” will leave little doubt of where Mars Ill’s convictions lie. Album Highlights: “More” featuring Ahmad Jones and “Effortless” - jennifer e. jones\n\nMarty Stuart and his Fabulous Superlatives\n\nSouls' Chapel\n\nAside from having a cool band name, Marty Stuart and his Fabulous Superlatives offer this blues/country medley that is southern comfort to the soul. Inspired by the Staple Singers as a child, you can hear the influences of the southern and black gospel as well as the blues legends in his downhome guitar licks. It kicks off with “Somebody Save Me” that has the Soggy Bottom Boys-esque harmonies with a lot of soul. It rocks on to the last song, which is the title track, where the guitar echos in a dream-like haze. Definitely for the blues lover in you. Album Highlights: “Souls’ Chapel,” “Lord Give Me Just a Little More Time,” and “I Can’t Even Walk” - jennifer e. jones\n\nMary Mary\n\nThe Sound\n\n“The Sound” is completely opposite of what you’ve heard from Mary Mary in the past. The album features many R&B/Hip-hop like tunes that will appeal more to the younger generation. Technically and musically, the album is very well put together, as it explores a variety of musical elements that I am sure many people will appreciate. However, on a spiritual and intellectual level the album is suffering drastically and as a result the best thing about it is the sound of the beats to many of the songs. Album Highlights: “I’m Running” and “Seattle” – kimberly a. lilly\n\nMary Mary\n\nThe princesses of Christian R&B return with more hip-hop soul. Heads are still bobbin’ from “Shackles,” and the ladies did not disappoint for their third album. They have a little something for everyone with the big band sounds of “Biggest, Greatest Thing” to the disco-flavored “The Real Party.” The collaboration with Kirk Franklin, “And I,” is an airy, mellow mix -- unexpected but went with the album’s flow. Lastly, Mary Mary really showcases their spectacular singing. Their vocals are solid from track to track. Album Highlights: “Believer,” “What Is This,” “Biggest, Greatest Thing,” and “Yesterday” - jennifer e. jones\n\nMax, Kevin\n\nThe Imposter\n\nKMax has one of the most recognizable voices in music. It’s sweet to hear that it’s not only the highlight of The Imposter, but has only gotten stronger with age. The sophomore release on Northern Records holds nothing that’s typical and everything that’s relevant about today’s “Killers-Franz Ferdinand” rock scene. “Confessional Booth” kicks off the album with a good scream and total rock’n’roll flare. “Sanctuary” is a solid radio hit, and lines like “I find your beautiful mind in everything / And everything is all I need” in “Beautiful Mind” highlight Max’s hidden sensitivity to the divine. In my favorite surprise of all, listen to KMax go gospel on “When He Returns.” You just gotta love this guy. Album Highlights: “Platform,” “Confessional Booth,” “Sanctuary,” “When He Returns” - jennifer e. jones\n\nMcDonald, Shawn\n\nScattered Pieces: Live\n\nShawn McDonald is raspy and full of heart on his live CD, Scattered Pieces. He starts off with the breathless “Ramblings of a Beggar” from Ripen and bleeds right into “I Am Nothing” from his debut album -- showing how much this artist has truly grown in the last three years. McDonald keeps it cool with his mostly acoustic blend. If I had one complaint, it’s that certain songs sound dangerously like their album versions, thus making the performance less exceptional. However, within the 17 tracks, McDonald tries to mix it up (i.e., the up tempo “Gravity”, “Take My Hand” and the sweet serenity when Shawn and his audience join in the chorus of “Amazing Grace”). Shawn McDonald fans will get their money’s worth with Scattered Pieces but others may want to wait for new material. Album Highlights: “Gravity” and “Amazing Grace” - jennifer e. jones\n\nRipen\n\nShawn McDonald has grown up from the shy guy with a lone guitar, and his sophomore album Ripen shows every inch of that evolution. McDonald’s sound is much more full now with a wide array of instruments. Listen to Ripen with headphones on, and you’ll hear a rainforest of sounds, especially on songs like “The Rider on the White Horse.” Lovers of Simply Nothing may be surprised but rest assure that Shawn still keeps it acoustically mellow (The heartfelt-almost-made-me-cry ball"
