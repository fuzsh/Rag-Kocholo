Read About the Berean Test and Evaluation Criteria prior to reading this review.\n\n1. What message does the song communicate?\n\nChrist is our source of desire, admiration, and power. When we turn to Jesus for help, fears are gone. Lives are restored. Hope is found. We respond to His salvation with worship, asking to experience more of His Presence.\n\nScore: 10/10\n\n2. How much of the lyrics line up with Scripture?\n\nThe entire song aligns with Scripture.\n\nLyrics posted with permission.*\n\nThis song does not contain a Verse/Chorus/Bridge format. Therefore, I assigned stanzas to each paragraph.\n\n[Stanza 1]\n\nPraise is rising, eyes are turning to You, we turn to You\n\nHope is stirring, hearts are yearning for You, we long for You\n\nGeneral statements that communicate that some desire God (Psalm 42:1-2, Psalm 63:1, Psalm 73:25, Psalm 119:20, Psalm 119:81, Psalm 143:6, Isaiah 26:9, Amos 8:11, John 4:13-14, John 6:35, John 7:37, Revelation 21:6, and Revelation 22:17)\n\n‘Cause when we see You we find strength to face the day\n\nThat is, our power comes from God (Nehemiah 8:10, Psalm 22:19, Psalm 28:7-8, Psalm 46:1, Psalm 118:14, Isaiah 12:2, Isaiah 33:2, Isaiah 40:29-31, Habakkuk 3:19, 2 Corinthians 12:9-10, Ephesians 3:16, Ephesians 6:10, and Philippians 4:13). By “seeing”, we fix our eyes on Jesus (Hebrews 12:2).\n\nIn Your presence all our fears are washed away, washed away\n\nWhen we come to God, we find rest for our worries, problems, and fears (Matthew 11:28-30). We have no reason to fear (Genesis 15:1, Joshua 1:9, Deuteronomy 31:6, 1 Chronicles 28:20, Psalm 23:4, Psalm 27:1, Psalm 34:4, Psalm 56:3-4, Psalm 94:19, Psalm 115:11, Psalm 118:6, Isaiah 35:4, Isaiah 41:10-13, Isaiah 43:1, Isaiah 54:4, John 14:25-27, Romans 8:15, Romans 8:38-39, 2 Timothy 1:7, Hebrews 13:5-6, 1 Peter 3:13-14, 1 Peter 5:6-7, and 1 John 4:18).\n\n[Stanza 2]\n\nHosanna, Hosanna\n\nYou are the God who saves us\n\nThis word comes from the Koine Greek term “hósanna” and appears in Matthew 21:9, Mark 11:10, and John 12:13 to exclaim Christ as “help” or “save, I pray”. Christ is the Savior who takes away our sins (Isaiah 53:7-11, Matthew 1:21, John 1:29, Galatians 1:4, Galatians 3:13, 1 Timothy 2:6, Titus 2:14, 1 Peter 2:24, 1 Peter 3:18, 1 John 2:2, 1 John 3:5, and Revelation 1:5).\n\nWorthy of all our praises\n\nThis is a great reason to praise God (1 Chronicles 16:25, 2 Samuel 22:4, Psalm 96:4-5, Psalm 145:3, and Revelation 4:11).\n\nHosanna, Hosanna\n\nRepeats line 1.\n\nCome have Your way among us\n\nThat is, we surrender to God (Isaiah 64:8, Matthew 10:38, Matthew 11:28-30, Matthew 16:24, Mark 8:34-38, Mark 10:28, Luke 9:23, Luke 14:27, John 15:1-11, Romans 6:13, Romans 12:1-2, Galatians 2:20, Philippians 2:5-8, Hebrews 11:6, James 4:7-10, and 1 Peter 5:6).\n\nWe welcome You here, Lord Jesus\n\nThis is not a statement against God’s omnipresence. Rather, the request is for increased sensitivity to experience God’s Presence.\n\n[Stanza 3]\n\nHear the sound of hearts returning to You, we turn to You\n\nSee commentary on Stanza 1, lines 1 and 2.\n\nIn Your Kingdom broken lives are made new, You make us new\n\nDescribes the transformation process from deadness in sin to made alive in Christ (Romans 6:1-11, Romans 7:4-6, Galatians 2:19-20, 2 Timothy 2:11, and 1 Peter 2:24).\n\n‘Cause when we see You we find strength to face the day\n\nIn Your presence all our fears are washed away, washed away\n\nRepeats Stanza 1, lines 3 and 4.\n\n[Stanza 4]\n\nHosanna, Hosanna\n\nYou are the God who saves us\n\nWorthy of all our praises\n\nHosanna, Hosanna\n\nCome have Your way among us\n\nWe welcome You here, Lord Jesus\n\nRepeats Stanza 2.\n\n[Stanza 5]\n\n‘Cause when we see You, we find strength to face the day\n\nIn Your Presence all our fears are washed away\n\n‘Cause when we see You, we find strength to face the day\n\nIn Your Presence all our fears are washed away, washed away\n\nRepeats Stanza 1, lines 3 and 4.\n\n[Stanza 6]\n\nHosanna, Hosanna\n\nYou are the God who saves us\n\nWorthy of all our praises\n\nHosanna, Hosanna\n\nCome have Your way among us\n\nWe welcome You here, Lord Jesus\n\nRepeats Stanza 2.\n\n[Stanza 7]\n\nHosanna, Hosanna\n\nYou are the God who saves us\n\nWorthy of all our praises\n\nHosanna, Hosanna\n\nCome have Your way among us\n\nWe welcome You here, Lord Jesus\n\nRepeats Stanza 2.\n\n[Stanza 8]\n\nHosanna, Hosanna\n\nHosanna, Hosanna\n\nRepeats Stanza 2, line 1.\n\nScore: 10/10\n\n3. How would an outsider interpret the song?\n\nThe concept of praise, word “Hosanna”, and explicitly naming Jesus all point to a Christian worldview. Unbelievers will likely interpret this song as Christians who depend on God for strength and hope, abandoning their autonomy to follow and worship Him. The only thing that may not comprehend is what is meant by “saves us”.\n\nScore: 8/10\n\n4. What does this song glorify?\n\nIt glorifies Jesus as the object of our worship.\n\nScore: 10/10\n\nClosing Comments\n\nPaul Baloche’s Hosanna (Praise Is Rising) is a great song. It praises Jesus as our source of hope, redemption, and stability. We abandon self to follow Him, bringing Christ glory. Its simplicity in language eases unbeliever interpretation to similar conclusions, though perhaps not understanding what is mean by “saved”, easily rectified with a Gospel presentation before or its use.\n\nI highly recommend this for corporate worship.\n\nFinal Score: 9.5/10\n\nArtist Info\n\nTrack: Hosanna (Praise Is Rising) (Live) (listen to the song)\n\nArtist: Paul Baloche\n\nAlbum: Live\n\nGenre: Rock\n\nRelease Year: 2014\n\nDuration: 6:17\n\nAgree?
