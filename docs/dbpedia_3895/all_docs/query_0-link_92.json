        "text": "Puccini\n\nGiacomo Antonio Domenico Michele Secondo Maria Puccini (December 22, 1858 â November 29, 1924) was an Italian composer whose operas, including La BohÃ¨me, Tosca, and Madama Butterfly, are among the most frequently performed in the standard repertoire. Some of his arias, such as \"O Mio Babbino Caro\" from Gianni Schicchi, \"Che gelida manina\" from La BohÃ¨me, and \"Nessun Dorma\" from Turandot, have become part of popular culture.\n\nThe subject of Puccini's style is one that has been long avoided by musicologists; this avoidance can perhaps be attributed to the perception that his work, with its emphasis on melody and evident popular appeal, lacked \"seriousness\" (a similar prejudice beset Rachmaninoff during his lifetime). Despite the place Puccini clearly occupies in the popular tradition of Verdi, his style of orchestration also shows the strong influence of Wagner, matching specific orchestral configurations and timbres to different dramatic moments. His operas contain an unparalleled manipulation of orchestral colors, with the orchestra often creating the sceneâs atmosphere.\n\nThe structures of Puccini's works are also noteworthy. While it is to an extent possible to divide his operas into arias or numbers (like Verdi's), his scores generally present a very strong sense of continuous flow and connectivity, perhaps another sign of Wagnerâs influence. Like Wagner, Puccini used leitmotifs to connote characters (or combinations of characters). This is apparent in Tosca, where the three chords which signal the beginning of the opera are used throughout to announce Scarpia. Several motifs are also linked to Mimi and the Bohemians in La BohÃ¨me and to Cio-Cio-San's eventual suicide in Butterfly. Unlike Wagner, though, Puccini's motifs are static: where Wagner's motifs develop into more complicated figures as the characters develop, Puccini's remain more or less identical throughout the opera (in this respect anticipating the themes of modern musical theatre).\n\nDionisio Aguado\n\nDionisio Aguado y GarcÃ­a was a Spanish classical guitarist and composer of the late Classical and early Romantic periodsSpanish 19th-century composer for the guitar.Born in Madrid, this Spanish Maestro surname is derived from the spanish word for \"soaked\" : this was a nickname an ancient relative, a knight, acquired after returning from a battle caked in mud! Dionisio Aguado was taught\n\nPhilippe Roux\n\nPhilippe Roux Composer.\n\nDonna Summer\n\nLaDonna Adrian Gaines (born December 31, 1948), known by her stage name, Donna Summer, is an American singer/songwriter who gained prominence during the disco era of the 1970s. Summer is a five-time Grammy winner and was the first artist to have three consecutive double albums reach number one on the US Billboard chart. She also charted four number-one singles in the US within a thirteen-month period.\n\nPaul Simon\n\nPaul Frederic Simon (born October 13, 1941) is an American songwriter, musician, and member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In 2006, Time magazine called him one of the 100 \"people who shape our world.\" As of 2007, he resides in New Canaan, Connecticut.\n\nHe released Paul Simon in 1972, which contained one of his first experiments with world music, the Jamaican-inspired Mother and Child Reunion, and There Goes Rhymin' Simon in 1973. His 1975 album Still Crazy After All These Years is considered to be among his finest work, particularly the title track and the hit single \"50 Ways to Leave Your Lover.\" The One Trick Pony album, Simon's first album with Warner Bros. Records was also paired with a major motion picture of the same name, with Simon in the starring role. Simon's next album Hearts and Bones, while critically acclaimed, did not yield any hit singles and marked a lull in his commercial popularity in the early 1980s.\n\nIn 1985, Simon lent his talents to USA for Africa and performed on the famine relief fundraising single \"We Are the World\". In 1986 he released the immensely popular Graceland, for which he won a Grammy. The album featured the groundbreaking use of African rhythms and performers such as Ladysmith Black Mambazo. In 1990, he followed up Graceland with the commercially successful and consistent successor album The Rhythm of the Saints, which featured Brazilian musical themes.\n\nHis 2000 studio album You're the One, did not reach the commercial heights of previous albums but was considered by many fans and critics to be an artistic success and received a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year. Simon's latest album, Surprise, produced by himself and Brian Eno, was released on May 9, 2006. In commenting on US TV show Ellen what drove him to write material for this latest album, Simon noted the events of September 11, 2001 and also turning 60 since his previous album You're the One.\n\nKurtis Parks\n\nHaving written over 1200 songs in every genre since the age of 13, and being a worship leader since the age of 13, Kurtis truly understands the gift of music, and the potential for itâs impact on our world today. Some may recognize him as a top 50 finalist on American Idolâs fourth season.\n\nLjubisa Pavkovic\n\nLjubiÅ¡a PavkoviÄ Musician Born: June 14, 1947 (age 74 years), Belgrade, Serbia Albums: Zapisano u vremenu\n\nSongs Medeno kolo Zapisano u vremenu Â· 2012 Milanovo kolo Zapisano u vremenu Â· 2012 Kosmajski biser Zapisano u vremenu Â· 2012\n\nMike Allemana\n\nMike Allemana Musical artist Born: July 2, 1969 (age 52 years) Songs Cravo e Canela The Night's Womb and the Morning Sun Â· 2006 Velho Piano The Night's Womb and the Morning Sun Â· 2006 Viola Fora de Moda The Night's Womb and the Morning Sun Â· 2006.\n\nChris Daughtry\n\nChristopher Adam \"Chris\" Daughtry (born December 26, 1979) is an American musician and the lead vocalist, rhythm guitarist and main-songwriter for his band Daughtry. He was the fourth-place finalist on the fifth season of American Idol, eliminated from the competition on May 10, 2006.\n\nAfter his fallout from Idol, he was given a record deal by RCA Records. His self-titled debut album sold more than 1 million copies after just 5 weeks of release, becoming the fastest selling debut rock album in history. In its ninth week of release, the album reached number one on the Billboard charts. Chris Daughtry is now the third most successful American Idol contestant in terms of record sales, only behind Kelly Clarkson and Carrie Underwood, who both won their respective seasons. He is the most successful contestant, in terms of record sales, from his season and the most successful non-winner or non-runner up. At the 50th Grammy Awards, he was nominated for Best Rock Song for \"It's Not Over\".\n\nBaruch Levine\n\nBaruch Levine is a Canadian-born American Orthodox Jewish composer and singer whose songs have become popular and classic throughout the Orthodox Jewish world. His slow, soulful, heartfelt tunes have gained wide popularity at Shabbat tables and kumzits gatherings.\n\nIsaac Albeniz\n\nIsaac AlbÃ©niz i Pascual (Spanish pronunciation: ) (May 29, 1860 â May 18, 1909) was a Spanish pianist and composer best known for his piano works based on folk music.\n\nAlbÃ©nizâ Suite EspaÃ±ola Op.47 is comprised mainly of pieces written in 1886, and grouped together in 1887 in honor of the Queen of Spain. Like many of AlbÃ©niz' piano pieces, these works are miniature tone pictures of different geographical regions and musical idioms of Spain. The eight original titles are Granada, Cataluna, Sevilla, Cadiz, Asturias, Aragon, Castilla and Cuba but only the first three titles and Cuba appeared in the original collection. The other pieces were published in later collections, often with different titles. The publisher Hofmeister published all eight titles of Suite Espanola in 1911 after AlbÃ©nizâ death, appropriating other pieces for the other four titles so those pieces do not always accurately reflect the geographic designation of the titles, most obviously in the case of Asturias (Leyenda) whose Andalusian flamenco rhythms bear little resemblance to the music of the northern province Asturias. The opus number 47 assigned by Hofmeister has no relation to any chronological order in AlbÃ©nizâ oeuvre, in which opus numbers were randomly given by publishers or by AlbÃ©niz himself, with some pieces appearing in more than one collection.\n\nGordon lightfoot\n\nGordon Meredith Lightfoot Jr. CC OOnt (born November 17, 1938) is a Canadian singer-songwriter and guitarist who achieved international success in folk, folk-rock, and country music. He is credited with helping to define the folk-pop sound of the 1960s and 1970s. He is often referred to as Canada's greatest songwriter and is known internationally as a folk-rock legend.\n\nEythor Thorlaksson\n\nEythor Thorlaksson (EyÃ¾Ã³r ÃorlÃ¡ksson) (22 March 1930 â 14 December 2018) was an Icelandic guitarist and composerEythor was born at Krosseyrarvegur in HafnarfjÃ¶rÃ°ur. His parents where MarÃ­a JakobsdÃ³ttir, from AÃ°alvÃ­k and ÃorlÃ¡kur GuÃ°laugsson from Biskupstungur.In the years 1950â1952 he studied guitar in England, Denmark and Sweden and in 1953 in Madrid with Daniel Fortea and Quintin Esquembre. In the years 1954â1957 he studied harmony and counterpoint with Victor Urbancic and in 1958â1961 he completed his guitar studies with Graciano TarragÃ³ in Barcelona.\n\nTrinh Cong Son\n\nTrinh Cong Son (Trá»nh CÃ´ng SÆ¡n) (February 28, 1939 â April 1, 2001) was a Vietnamese composer, musician, painter and songwriter. He, along with Pham Duy and Van Cao, is widely considered one of the three most salient figures of modern (non-classical) Vietnamese music.\n\nTrinh Cong Son wrote over 600 songs, and, during the 1960s and 1970s, Joan Baez dubbed him the Bob Dylan of Vietnam for his moving antiwar songs. He became one of South Vietnam's best-known singer-songwriters, after his first hit, Æ¯á»t mi (Tearing 'Lashes) in 1957. He was frequently under pressure from the government, which was displeased with the pacifist's lyrics of such songs as Ngá»§ Äi con (Lullaby, about a mother grieving for her soldier son). After the reunification in 1975, Son was sentenced by the new communist government, to \"retraining\" in a labour camp after his family fled to Canada. However, he was eventually honoured by the government and many officials sent their respects with floral tributes. His often melancholy songs about love and postwar reconciliation earned new acceptance and popularity in later years.\n\nThere are two singers' names often associated with Trinh Cong Son. One is Khanh Ly. The other one is Hong Nhung.\n\nKhanh Ly, with her unique vocals, helped popularize Trinh Cong Son music in the early years. They often performed together in South Vietnam University Campuses. The voice and the music seemed to be inseparable.\n\nLater on in his life, Hong Nhung, many years his junior, replaced Khanh Ly's place until his death.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people gathered at his funeral in Ho Chi Minh city, for a spontaneous ad hoc funeral concert, making such a spectacle the largest in Vietnamese history, next to the funeral procession of Ho Chi Minh. His music remains very popular among Vietnamese, old and young.\n\nRichard Rodgers\n\nRichard Charles Rodgers (June 28, 1902 â December 30, 1979) was an American composer of music for more than 900 songs and for 43 Broadway musicals. He also composed music for films and television. He is best known for his songwriting partnerships with the lyricists Lorenz Hart and Oscar Hammerstein II. His compositions have had a significant impact on popular music down to the present day, and have an enduring broad appeal.\n\nRodgers is one of only two persons to have won an Oscar, a Grammy, an Emmy, a Tony Award, and a Pulitzer Prize (Marvin Hamlisch is the other).\n\nTrinh Nam Son\n\nTrinh Nam Son is an outstanding Vietnamese singer-composer in the Vietnamese community. ... During his school years, he studied composition, orchestration, and conducting with famous film composers such as Henry Mancini, Bill Conti, Alan Ferguson,Dick Grove, Roger Steinman, Jack Feiberman, and David Angel.\n\nKlaus Karl\n\nKlaus Karl-Kraus (* 6. Dezember 1951 in Erlangen) ist ein deutscher Kabarettist, Musiker, Autor, Moderator und Dipl. -Betriebswirt, der seine Auftritte in frÃ¤nkischem Regiolekt absolviert.\n\nCharitie L.

Her hymns, well known in England and Ireland, were included in Lyra Sacra Hibernica, Ryle's Spiritual Songs, Lyra Britannica, and Times of Refreshing.\n\nIrving Berlin\n\nIrving Berlin (May 11, 1888 â September 22, 1989) was a Russian-born American composer and lyricist, and one of the most prolific American songwriters in history. Berlin was one of the few Tin Pan Alley/Broadway songwriters who wrote both lyrics and music for his songs. Although he never learned to read music beyond a rudimentary level, with the help of various uncredited musical assistants or collaborators, he eventually composed over 3,000 songs, many of which (e.g. \"God Bless America\", \"White Christmas\", \"Anything You Can Do\", \"There's No Business Like Show Business\") left an indelible mark on music and culture worldwide. He composed seventeen film scores and twenty-one Broadway scores.\n\nAaron Gilmartin\n\nAn award-winning composer and song-writer for film, stage and people's enjoyment.

While it is uncertain how many albums the band has sold, estimations range from 130 million to over 300 million albums worldwide.\n\nThe band is noted for their musical diversity, multi-layered arrangements, vocal harmonies, and incorporation of audience participation into their live performances. Their 1985 Live Aid performance was voted the best live rock performance of all time in an industry poll.\n\nQueen had moderate success in the early 1970s, with the albums Queen and Queen II, but it was with the release of Sheer Heart Attack in 1974 and A Night at the Opera the following year that the band gained international success. They have released fifteen studio albums, five live albums, and numerous compilation albums. Eighteen of these have reached number one on charts around the world.\n\nFollowing Mercury's death in 1991 and Deacon's retirement later in the decade, May and Taylor have performed infrequently under the Queen name. Since 2005 they have been collaborating with Paul Rodgers, under the moniker Queen + Paul Rodgers.\n\nBeatles\n\nThe Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. Their best-known lineup, consisting of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr, became the greatest and most influential act of the rock era, introducing more innovations into popular music than any other rock band of the 20th century. Rooted in skiffle and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later utilized several genres, ranging from pop ballads to psychedelic rock, often incorporating classical elements in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \"Beatlemania\", but as their songwriting grew in sophistication, they came to be perceived by many fans and cultural observers as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the era's sociocultural revolutions.\n\nThe band built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg over a three-year period from 1960. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act and producer George Martin enhanced their musical potential. They gained popularity in the United Kingdom after their first modest hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. They acquired the nickname the \"Fab Four\" as Beatlemania grew in Britain over the following year, and by early 1964 they had become international stars, leading the \"British Invasion\" of the United States pop market. From 1965 on, the Beatles produced what many critics consider their finest material, including the innovative and widely influential albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966), Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), The Beatles (1968), and Abbey Road (1969). After their break-up in 1970, they each enjoyed successful musical careers. Lennon was shot and killed in December 1980, and Harrison died of lung cancer in November 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active.\n\nJames Blunt\n\nJames Blunt (born James Hillier Blount, February 22, 1974) is an English singer-songwriter whose debut album, Back to Bedlam, and single releases â especially the number one hit \"You're Beautiful\" â brought him to fame in 2005. His style is a mix of pop, rock and folk. Along with vocals, James Blunt performs a variety of instruments, including piano and guitar. He is signed to Linda Perry's independent American label Custard Records. Blunt won two BRIT Awards and two Ivor Novello Awards, and was nominated for five Grammy Awards in 2006. Blunt subsequently released his second album, All The Lost Souls, in 2007; this album was certified gold within its first week of release. The first single from his second album, \"1973\", was Blunt's first Global Number 1 in October 2007, beating \"You're Beautiful\" which peaked at Number 2 in the United World Chart.\n\nPrior to embarking on a career in music, Blunt was an officer in the Life Guards, a reconnaissance regiment of the British Army, and served under NATO in Kosovo during the conflict in 1999. While posted to Kosovo, Blunt was introduced to the work of MÃ©decins sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) (Doctors Without Borders), a humanitarian aid group best known for its emergency medical care in conflict-torn regions. Since then, Blunt has supported MSF by holding meet-and-greet auctions at many of his concerts.\n\nBlunt's primary residence is now on the Spanish island of Ibiza, where he wrote many of the songs on his second album.\n\nAlan Menken\n\nAlan Menken (born July 22, 1949 in New Rochelle, New York) is an American Broadway and an eight-time Academy Award winning composer and pianist. Menken has collaborated with several renowned lyricists including Howard Ashman (1950-1991), Tim Rice and Stephen Schwartz.\n\nReuben morgan\n\nReuben Timothy Morgan is an Australian worship pastor at Hillsong Church UK and one of several worship leaders and songwriters in Hillsong Worship group.

Although he introduced no new forms, he enriched the prevailing German style with a robust contrapuntal technique, an unrivalled control of harmonic and motivic organisation in composition for diverse musical forces, and the adaptation of rhythms and textures from abroad, particularly Italy and France.\n\nRevered for their intellectual depth and technical and artistic beauty, Bach's works include the Brandenburg concertos; the Goldberg Variations; the English Suites, French Suites, Partitas, and Well-Tempered Clavier; the Mass in B Minor; the St. Matthew Passion; the St. John Passion; The Musical Offering; The Art of Fugue; the Sonatas and Partitas for violin solo; the Cello Suites; more than 200 surviving cantatas; and a similar number of organ works, including the celebrated Toccata and Fugue in D Minor.\n\nWhile Bach's fame as an organist was great during his lifetime, he was not particularly well-known as a composer. His adherence to Baroque forms and contrapuntal style was considered \"old-fashioned\" by his contemporaries, especially late in his career when the musical fashion tended towards Rococo and later Classical styles.

Primarily consisting of John Lennon (rhythm guitar, vocals), Paul McCartney (bass guitar, vocals), George Harrison (lead guitar, vocals) and Ringo Starr (drums, vocals) throughout their career, The Beatles are recognised for leading the mid-1960s musical \"British Invasion\" into the United States. Although their initial musical style was rooted in 1950s rock and roll and homegrown skiffle, the group explored genres ranging from Tin Pan Alley to psychedelic rock. Their clothes, styles, and statements made them trend-setters, while their growing social awareness saw their influence extend into the social and cultural revolutions of the 1960s. After the band broke up in 1970, all four members embarked upon solo careers.\n\nThe Beatles are one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands in the history of popular music, selling over a billion records internationally. In the United Kingdom, The Beatles released more than 40 different singles, albums, and EPs that reached number one, earning more number one albums (15) than any other group in UK chart history.

According to the Recording Industry Association of America, The Beatles have sold more albums in the United States than any other band. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine ranked The Beatles number one on its list of 100 Greatest Artists of All Time. According to that same magazine, The Beatles' innovative music and cultural impact helped define the 1960s, and their influence on pop culture is still evident today. In 2008, Billboard magazine released a list of top-selling Hot 100 artists to celebrate the chart's fiftieth anniversary; The Beatles reached #1 again.\n\nBert Kaempfert\n\nBert Kaempfert (born Berthold Heinrich KÃ¤mpfert, 16 October 1923 â 21 June 1980) was a German orchestra leader, multi-instrumentalist, music producer, arranger, and composer.

These last two were later replaced from the band, in favor of Kirk Hammett and Cliff Burton, respectively. In September 1986, Metallica's tour bus skidded out of control and flipped, which resulted in Burton being crushed under the bus and killed. Jason Newsted replaced him less than two months later. Newsted left the band in 2001 and was replaced by Robert Trujillo in 2003.\n\nMetallica's early releases included fast tempos, instrumentals, and aggressive musicianship that placed them as one of the \"Big Four\" of the thrash metal subgenre alongside Slayer, Megadeth and Anthrax. The band earned a growing fan base in the underground music community, and some critics say the 1986 release Master of Puppets is one of the most influential and \"heavy\" thrash metal albums. The band achieved substantial commercial success with its self-titled 1991 album, which debuted at number one on the Billboard 200. Some critics and fans believed the band changed its musical direction to appeal to the mainstream audience. With the release of Load in 1996, Metallica distanced itself from earlier releases in what has been described as \"an almost alternative rock approach\", and the band faced accusations of \"selling out\".\n\nIn 2000, Metallica was among several artists who filed a lawsuit against Napster for sharing the band's copyright-protected material for free without the band members' consent. A settlement was reached, and Napster became a pay-to-use service. Despite reaching number one on the Billboard 200, the release of St. Anger in 2003 disappointed some critics and fans with the exclusion of guitar solos, and the \"steel-sounding\" snare drum. A film titled Some Kind of Monster documented the recording process of St. Anger.\n\nAndres Segovia\n\nAndrÃ©s Segovia Torres, 1st Marquis of SalobreÃ±a (21 February 1893 â 2 June 1987) was a virtuoso Spanish classical guitarist from Linares, Spain.

It usually refers to the first volume of a series of books transcribed and collated by Berklee College of Music students during the 1970s.The name is derived from \"fake books\", so called because they contained only rough outlines of music pieces rather than fully notated scores. Early fake books were often used by professional bands who performed mostly standards, often more geared to society and dance bands rather than jazz ensembles, and devoted much space to show tunes, novelty tunes, traditional jazz, etc. The first three Real Book volumes, in contrast, contained many bebop and other jazz standards that were likely to be encountered on jazz gigs at the time. For this reason, the books were quickly adopted among jazz players in the 1970s, particularly on the east coast.\n\nMarc Shaiman\n\nMarc Shaiman is an American composer and lyricist for films, television, and theatre, best known for his collaborations with lyricist and director Scott Wittman.
