        "text": "DANNY GOKEY TO RELEASE FIFTH STUDIO ALBUM SOUND OF HEAVEN, JULY 26th\n\nNew focus track, \"wannabe,\" available today\n\nNashville, TN (May 24, 2024) - Danny Gokey's fifth studio album, Sound of Heaven is coming July 26, 2024 with its latest instant grat track, \"wannabe,\" available across all DSPs today. The three-time Grammy nominee, three-time K-LOVE Fan Award Male Vocalist of the Year winner and eight-time Dove Award winner's last album Jesus People peaked at #1 on Billboard's Top Christian Albums chart and has since accumulated 300M global streams.\n\nFeaturing eleven brand new songs, Sound of Heaven captures a wide variety of sounds and messages that reflect Gokey's passion for uplifting music and his heart for people. The grat track \"wannabe\" follows previously released tracks \"Todo El Mundo” and his recent radio song, “I Got You,\" currently No. 23 at AC radio earning over 4.5M global streams. Produced by an array of producers including Ben Glover, Jordan Sapp, Jeff Sojka, and Colby Wedgeworth, the project is as diverse sonically as it is thematically. Fans will bop their heads to the energetic title track, “Sound of Heaven,\" dance to the Spanish influenced track “Lean On Me,\" and appreciate the notable features including Evan Craft, Niko Eme, Limoblaze, and Naomi Raine. “Still On The Throne” and “Open Up The Gates” round out the album with a worship focus, the latter of which will be the next single available on June 28th. Full track listing is below.\n\n\"The phrase ‘Sound of Heaven,’ and each of the songs on this album, will mean different things to different people in different places of life, and I believe that each of these songs communicate the hopeful messages of heaven in ways that will speak to people - whatever their season of life,\" shares Gokey.\n\n\"I believe that the 'sound of heaven' is as diverse as all of God's creation. Some people think it's one dimensional with just angels singing with harps, but it's way more than that. It's full of joy, where all creation in heaven and earth comes together and makes a beautiful sound,\" he says. \"To me, there’s no greater joy than us getting to participate in the 'sounds of heaven' by glorifying Him with our lives here on earth. In whatever walk of life or profession; whatever nation, tribe or tongue, we all make up the 'sound of heaven' if we're following Jesus. My prayer is that each of these songs meet each person right where they are and help them experience the 'sound of heaven' in a fresh new way, in just the way they need it!\"\n\nTrack Listing:\n\nSound of Heaven\n\nwannabe\n\nI Got You\n\nStill On The Throne\n\nOnly For A Moment\n\nTodo El Mundo (feat.

Following Idol, Gokey dropped his first album, My Best Days and has since celebrated five No. 1s including his follow-up releases Hope In Front of Me, Rise, Haven’t Seen It Yet, Jesus People and holiday albums, Christmas Is Here and The Greatest Gift. Spawning singles like, “We All Need Jesus”, “Love God Love People,” and RIAA Gold-certified “Hope In Front of Me”, “Tell Your Heart to Beat Again” and “Haven’t Seen It Yet,” Danny Gokey has cemented his place on the radio charts with multi-week, multi-chart-topping runs in the United States, Canada, and now Latin markets with the releases of Spanish singles and collaborations. The desire to make a broader impact with his message of hope led to the founding of nonprofit organization Better Than I Found It, which is doing community giveback 'Bus Stops' during his touring initiatives. He and his wife Leyicet also launched Livin’ la Vida Gokey, a podcast featuring conversations about faith and family. They currently live outside Nashville, TN with their four beautiful children, Daniel, Victoria, Gabriel, and Emanuel. Find out more at DannyGokey.com.\n\nMedia Collective Contact:"
