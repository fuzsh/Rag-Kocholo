        "text": "Grammy Award\n\nAmerican music award\n\nTop Questions\n\nWhat is a Grammy Award?\n\nA Grammy Award is any of a series of awards presented each year in the United States by either the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences or the Latin Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences. The Grammys, as they are commonly known, are meant to recognize spectacular work in the music industry.\n\nHow did the Grammy Award get its name?\n\nSince the first Grammy Awards ceremony in 1959, the statuette presented to winners is a gold-plated gramophone, also known as a phonograph or record player. The name Grammy is an homage to the gramophone and its revolutionary impact on the music industry.\n\nWho gives out the Grammy Awards?\n\nThe Grammy Awards are annually presented in the United States by the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences (NARAS). Each year, record companies and academy members submit entries for consideration. NARAS voting members select five nominees for each award, with each voter casting a ballot only in their field of expertise.\n\nWhen was the first Grammy Awards ceremony?\n\nThe first Grammy Awards ceremony was held in Los Angeles in 1959, and 28 awards were presented. Famous recipients included Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra, and the Kingston Trio.\n\nWhat is the Latin Grammy Award?\n\nIn 1997 the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences created the Latin Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences as a response to the booming Latin American music industry. Recordings eligible for the Latin Grammys may be released anywhere in the world, but they must be recorded in the Spanish or Portuguese language. The first Latin Grammy Awards ceremony was held in Los Angeles in 2000, with award winners including Shakira and Carlos Santana.\n\nRecent News\n\nAug. 26, 2024, 8:07 PM ET (BBC)\n\nMariah Carey's mother and sister die on the same day\n\nAug. 23, 2024, 4:26 AM ET (Irish Times)\n\nDún Laoghaire hosts Grammy-winner Daniel Ho for annual Ukulele Hooley\n\nAug. 20, 2024, 3:28 AM ET (NPR)\n\nVictor Wooten, Bach, & Gospel Marching Band : From the Top\n\nAug. 16, 2024, 7:13 PM ET (AP)\n\nSongwriter-producer The-Dream seeks dismissal of sexual assault lawsuit\n\nGrammy Award, any of a series of awards presented annually in the United States by the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences (NARAS; commonly called the Recording Academy) or the Latin Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences (LARAS; commonly called the Latin Recording Academy) to recognize achievement in the music industry. Winners are selected from more than 25 fields, which cover such genres as pop, rock, rap, R&B, country, reggae, classical, gospel, and jazz, as well as production and postproduction work, including packaging and album notes. Four general awards are also given for record, album, song of the year, and best new artist; in total more than 75 awards are presented. The honorees receive a golden statuette of a gramophone.\n\nTo be eligible for a Grammy from NARAS, the recording or music video must be released in the United States between October 1 of the previous year and midnight September 30 of the given Grammy year. Entries are submitted by record companies as well as members of the academy and are reviewed to determine eligibility and category placement. The voting members of NARAS, through a series of ballots, select five nominees for each award and ultimately the winner; the voters cast ballots only in their areas of expertise. The winners are announced during a televised ceremony.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nSound Check: Musical Vocabulary Quiz\n\nThe Grammy Awards were first presented by NARAS in Los Angeles in 1959, when 28 prizes were given. Winners included Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra, and the Kingston Trio. The number of awards has increased as musical genres have emerged. Rock was first recognized as a genre by the academy at the 1980 ceremony and rap at the 1989 presentation. An award for best music video was first handed out in 1982 to acknowledge the growing influence of the medium. In 2011 NARAS radically restructured the Grammy category system and reduced the total number of awards from 109 to 78. Gender-based categories were eliminated, as were those that distinguished between solo and group efforts. Awards recognizing genres such as Hawaiian music, Native American music, and zydeco were folded into a single category, dubbed “regional roots music,” and instrumental categories were drastically scaled back. Further adjustments were made in subsequent years, and by 2017 the number of awards stabilized at 84.\n\nWith the rise of Latin music, NARAS created LARAS in 1997. To be eligible for a Latin Grammy, a recording may be released anywhere in the world, but it must be recorded in the Spanish or Portuguese language between July 1 of the previous year and June 30 of the award year. The first Latin Grammy Awards ceremony was staged in Los Angeles in 2000, with Carlos Santana and Shakira among the winners.\n\nReceipt of a Grammy of any sort usually results in greater record sales, as well as increased recognition to the artists. Among those who have received the most Grammys are Beyoncé (32 awards), Sir Georg Solti, Quincy Jones, Alison Krauss, Stevie Wonder, and Chet Atkins.\n\nGrammy Award winners\n\nSelect Grammy Award winners are provided in the table.\n\nGrammy Awards year record of the year* song of the year** album of the year best new artist\n\n*Record of the year recognizes the performance and production of a song.
