        "text": "Shvpes (pronounced ‘Shapes’) will release their second studio album, Greater Than, on November 9th via Search and Destroy/ Spinefarm Records.\n\nHaving initially planned to run with three ‘mixtapes’ leading into the full record next year, the band have decided to bring the album forward, following an incredible fan response to first single “Undertones”, issuing it as a single body of work, to support an exciting autumn/winter touring schedule, details being confirmed.\n\n“We’ve decided to bring you the full SHVPES experience this year with Album 2: 'Greater Than’ out on November 9th.

We put about 10 takes of him on there, so we’ve got this vocal gang monster!”\n\nSince releasing their highly-praised 2016 debut Pain. Joy. Ecstasy. Despair. Shvpes have been riding the wave of acclaim that rapidly attached itself to their name, touring Europe with some of the biggest bands in hard rock (Trivium, Bullet For My Valentine, Blessthefall) and appearing at festivals the world over. But in 2018, with Greater Than the band have truly arrived…"
