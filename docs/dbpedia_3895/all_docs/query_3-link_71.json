        "text": "What are endorphins?\n\nEndorphins are chemicals (hormones) your body releases when it feels pain or stress. They’re released during pleasurable activities such as exercise, massage, eating and sex too. Endorphins help relieve pain, reduce stress and improve your sense of well-being.\n\nEndorphins are created in your pituitary gland and hypothalamus, both located in the brain. Endorphins are a type of neurotransmitter, or messenger in your body. They attach to your brain’s reward centers (opioid receptors) and carry signals across your nervous system.\n\nEndorphin comes from the words “endogenous,” which means within the body, and “morphine,” an opiate pain reliever. Put together, that means endorphins are natural pain relievers. They are “feel-good” chemicals because they can make you feel better and put you in a positive state of mind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy\n\nWhat are the different types of endorphins?\n\nThere are more than 20 types of endorphins in your body. Beta-endorphins are the endorphins involved in stress relief and pain management. Beta-endorphins have a stronger effect than morphine on your body.\n\nWhat do endorphins do?\n\nEndorphins are released when your body feels pain or stress. Your body releases endorphins to help you survive. When you feel pain, nerves in your body send pain signals to your brain. Your brain releases endorphins to block the nerve cells that receive the pain signals.\n\nThis essentially turns off your pain. It helps you to continue functioning, even in painful or stressful situations. Because you naturally seek to avoid pain, you’re more likely to do something if it makes you feel good.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat are the benefits of endorphins?\n\nEndorphins have many benefits. Studies have shown they can help in the following ways:\n\nEasing symptoms of depression: Endorphins released during exercise have been shown to help reduce the symptoms of depression.\n\nHelping with stress and anxiety: As endorphin levels increase, stress and anxiety have been shown to decrease.\n\nImproving self-image: Studies have shown endorphins can increase levels of confidence, leading to better self-esteem.\n\nContributing to weight loss: Releasing endorphins has been shown to regulate your appetite.\n\nAlleviating childbirth pain: Studies have shown higher levels of endorphins have helped with pain experienced during childbirth.\n\nWhat is the difference between endorphins and dopamine?\n\nEndorphins and dopamine are both chemicals in your body that make you happy, but they function in different ways. Endorphins relieve pain naturally. When they attach to your brain’s reward centers (opiate receptors), dopamine is then released.\n\nFor example, endorphins will naturally help soothe a runner’s achy muscles. Then dopamine will be released, producing a runner’s high. Dopamine motivates you to do something over and over again. So endorphins and dopamine do work together.\n\nIs serotonin an endorphin?\n\nNo. Endorphins and serotonin are both chemicals in your body that make you happy, but they function in different ways. Serotonin helps stabilize your mood and well-being. It helps other systems in your body function as well. Endorphins are focused on pain relief and stress relief.\n\nWhen should I call my healthcare provider?\n\nIf you experience the following symptoms of endorphin deficiency, you should call your healthcare provider right away:\n\nDepression.\n\nFibromyalgia.\n\nExercise addiction.\n\nSelf-harm.\n\nA note from Cleveland Clinic\n\nEndorphins are an important chemical released by your body to help you relieve pain and reduce stress. They also help improve your mental well-being. There are many ways to boost your endorphins. Try a new sport, eat spicy food, have sex, laugh at a joke or watch a funny movie. If you’re worried about your endorphin levels, contact your healthcare provider."
