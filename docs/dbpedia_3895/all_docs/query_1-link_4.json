        "text": "Last week, Integrity Music legacy artist, worship leader and singer-songwriter Paul Baloche released a deluxe version of his trailblazing album ‘A Greater Song’ to celebrate its 15th anniversary! Since then, we have been playing it non-stop, enjoying the classics and rediscovering some of Paul’s songs through his beautifully reimagined versions, all the while worshipping our God. “The songs on ‘A Greater Song’ were birthed in the midst of worship in my local church 15 years ago,” he says, before adding: “I remember it being a season of intense and consistent prayer in our community and I can hear it in the voices on the original recordings. I can still picture the faces of our congregation as we lifted up these songs as prayers to God from our fellowship. Surprisingly, many of these choruses are still being sung in churches around the world.” Though fifteen years have passed since the live recording of this album, its core message still rings fresh and true to our ears and hearts today; Paul Baloche has a way of capturing the powerful message of the Gospel in a relevant and relatable manner.\n\nHaving served as the Worship Pastor at Community Christian Fellowship in Lindale, Texas for more than 25 years, Paul Baloche is an ordained minister with an MDiv from the Methodist Episcopal Church. In addition to writing, recording, and touring, he founded LeadWorship.com to serve, equip, and train local church worship teams across the globe. Paul Baloche is a contributing writer for bothWorship Leader and Worship Musician magazines, a featured blogger on ChurchLeaders.com, and has written the books The Same Love: A Devotion (David C. Cook) and God Songs – How to Write and Select Songs for Worship. He has three grown children and currently resides in Philadephia, PA, with his wife Rita."
