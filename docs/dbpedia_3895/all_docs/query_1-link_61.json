        "text": "Paul Baloche releases second French worship album\n\nIt’s hard to believe, but in many circles, Paul Baloche is still not exactly a household name, though he is in fact responsible for many of our modern worship songs. So vast is his catalog of compositions, that on a Sunday morning four years ago, we took a 2-hour driving listening to his first French language worship album, knowing the words to all but two of the songs in English. I reviewed that album here. I wrote:\n\nAujourd’hui nous avons conduit pendant deux heures pour aller à l’église. Dans la deuxième heure, nous avons écouté le Paul Baloche & Friends; une collection de chansons de culte et louange par Paul Baloche traduit en Français et enregistré au Québec.\n\nOkay, I didn’t write a word of that, I got my son to translate it. About a year later, we got to get out of the house for the first time in years (literally) and attended one of Paul’s concerts. I reviewed that here. I wrote:\n\n…Admittedly in the middle of a tour that had left some of the band a bit punchy, he later defined what he was doing as trying to blend the worship into the everyday; something about which he believes strongly. My wife put it this way, “I liked that he didn’t take everything seriously, but he knew what to take seriously.”…\n\n…The worship songs were strong; actually it was a kind of worship “greatest hits” evening, to the point where the projected lyrics were redundant…\n\n…My biggest take-away from the evening is that when you subtract the stories and testimony and some of the lighter moments, just about 100% of what was shared was from the Bible. If you want to make your mark as a worship leader, begin in the Word…\n\nBut today’s review of his new album requires one more set-up. It concerns a thought I had watching a video of the worship time at InterVaristy’s Urbana conference, which I wrote about here.\n\nBut what if some of the songs we sing in heavenly places are songs that we now know, with each one singing in their own language? Think about it, we’ve increasingly seen some of today’s worship choruses transcend the broadest denominational spectrum. And the internet takes songs around the world instantly.\n\nBut what of the people who didn’t live in the 21st century?\n\nWhat if the saints who have gone before us live out their role as a “great cloud of witnesses” are eavesdropping on our weekend services and learning our songs? Do they sing along on some (not all) of them? What if their greatest delight is to hear sincere praise emanating from our lips as we sing the songs which advance the purposes and power of God in our generation?\n\nWhat if those people who said after a good worship time, “I believe we’ll be singing those songs in heaven” were partly right? What if those who offered, “I believe that was a taste of heaven” weren’t completely off the mark?\n\nAll this to say I’ve had some interesting takeaways listening to music where I didn’t understand a word, at least in the language being spoken.\n\nWhich brings us to Glorieux, the new album. Paul Baloche is one of the hardest working Christian musicians out there. Anyone who follows Paul on Twitter — where he seems to tweet something new every five seconds — was aware of the number of different people who were involved in putting these songs together and making them sound natural in a second language, recording almost right up to the release date.\n\nIn the American Christian music market, the second language is usually Spanish. But in Canada, where French and English are both official languages, worship music en Francais is equally rare. Quebec-based worship usually emphasizes the composition itself and ‘feel’ of the song over enhanced production values.\n\nSo…what we have in Glorieux is 14 songs including some you know in English (Glorious, The Same Love, King of Heaven, Today is the Day, and some I should have recognized) and some that are unfamiliar all done with a full studio sound and the aforementioned host of vocal helpers. (The first album had all the exterior packaging in English for some reason, making song recognition easier. This one is mostly French, though the cover art describes Paul Baloche and Friends instead of et amis.)\n\nChristian music reviews are rare in a Christian blogosphere that emphasizes book reviews; and to review an album in a language that few of my mostly American readers speak may seem absolutely pointless.\n\nSo here’s the point: It’s a big world out there. The Body of Christ is much larger, so much more varied than what we see from our vantage point sitting in North American weekend services. In fact if you’re not taking that summer trip to Paris this year, maybe you should just buy this and let your mind transport you to another part of the bigger, capital ‘C’ Church that worships God around the world.\n\nIn Canada at least, Glorieux is available as a physical CD. For more info check out the album page at Your Music Zone. Enjoy a sample of the title song on YouTube. (Static image video loads at all connection speeds.) And if you have a francophone friend, you know what to buy them as a gift.\n\nGlorieux (Glorious)\n\nTu Nous A Sauvés (You Have Saved Us)\n\nTout Mon Espoir (My Hope)\n\nRoi Des Cieux (King Of Heaven)\n\nCet Amour (The Same Love)\n\nNous Sommes Sauves (We Are Saved)\n\nPar Le Don De La Croix (All Because Of The Cross)\n\nÊtre Près De Toi (Just To Be With You)\n\nVoici Le Jour (Today Is The Day)\n\nOh Seigneur (Oh Our Lord)\n\nVois Donc Le Seigneur (Look Upon The Lord)\n\nRègne En Moi (Reign In Me)\n\nMerci Pour La Croix (Thank You For The Cross)\n\nAlléluia\n\nIf you attended a Christian music concert in Toronto anytime in the 1980’s, I was there. The reasons were often quite varied:\n\nattending to a display of Christian music by other artists (many times)\n\nbeing the master of ceremonies (at least half a dozen)\n\nworking with the concert promoter (about a dozen)\n\nbeing the opening act (twice that I can remember)\n\ndoing sound (once)\n\nescorting and assisting a video crew from a local TV station (twice)\n\nbeing part of the counseling team (once or twice)\n\nplaying keyboard with one of the bands (twice)\n\nactually being the concert promoter (once, and only once!)\n\nBut when we moved out to the boonies, a lot of concert connection — including the free admission and going out for pizza with the artist after the concert — abruptly ended. (Although personally, I think my wife once saved a Brian Duncan concert in a nearby town when she had the necessary cough candies in her purse.)\n\nThen the kids came, and nobody wanted to be our regular babysitter, so we just gave up on the ‘date night’ concept and stayed home. For about twenty years.\n\nUntil Wednesday. Given that one of them is starting university in the fall, we don’t need a babysitter anymore, so I realized we were running out of excuses. So for her birthday, Mrs. W. got, among other things, tickets for us to go to a “worship concert” — the woman who took our tickets told us to “enjoy the show” — with songwriter and worship leader Paul Baloche.\n\nListening to open act Joel Augé, who apparently is also known for inventing some game that is part of Facebook, I got this strange feeling — not a deja vu, exactly — that I was doing something I had done in another lifetime, only now the sound and lighting were better. Although he’s a worship leader at The Meeting House, Canada’s fastest growing church movement, for this night Joel did a short but excellent peformance set including a killer version of James Taylor’s “Fire and Rain.”\n\nThe remaining 2 1/2 hours — less an intermission and the now obligatory presentation for Compassion, which didn’t exist back in the day — belonged to Paul Baloche. If you’re still scratching your head wondering what songs he has contributed to the worship genre, check out a post I wrote here several months ago about a rather obscure French worship album that Paul released which lists a few, or a most recent post here about the Compassionart project, to which Paul was a contributor, or just hang on for a few paragraphs. (The host church, in their newsletter, actually counted the songs their worship team does which Paul authored, and there are twenty-one of them!)\n\nAlthough some of us were expecting a worship event, and not a concert, while others were expecting a concert and not a worship event, Paul’s treatment of the evening was certainly commendable. Starting out conversationally, he sought to get to know. and thereby connect with, his audience. I’ve read more than a few blog posts recently where the opinion is expressed that some worship sets fail because the element of connection between worship leader and congregation is missing.\n\nAdmittedly in the middle of a tour that had left some of the band a bit punchy, he later defined what he was doing as trying to blend the worship into the everyday; something about which he believes strongly. My wife put it this way, “I liked that he didn’t take everything seriously, but he knew what to take seriously.”\n\nThen there were the many, many personal moments in the concert, including introducing people he recognized in the audience, and telling a bit of their story, which a few times intersected with his own.\n\nAnd then there were the many, many lighter moments. If you’ve seen the Compassionart DVD, you know that Paul takes life a little less seriously than most. Around the middle of the evening, I wondered if that would prove a distraction to worship purists, but really, that’s who he is, and it is out of all that his worship songs quite naturally flow. Throughout the evening he was able to move from rather silly moments to serious worship, and the audience was willing to make the transitions.\n\nThe worship songs were strong; actually it was a kind of worship “greatest hits” evening, to the point where the projected lyrics were redundant. Paul likes to start songs with just the band, but a few times the audience jumped right in. Although not all these songs were performed that night, consider this is the guy who wrote or cowrote:\n\nA New Hallelujah\n\nAbove All\n\nAll the Earth Will Sing Your Praises\n\nArise\n\nBecause of Your Love\n\nI Love to Be In Your Presence\n\nOffering\n\nOpen the Eyes of My Heart\n\nOur God Reigns\n\nPraise Adonai\n\nRevival Fire Fall\n\nToday is the Day\n\nWhat Can I Do?\n\nYou Gave Your Life Away\n\nYour Name\n\nand the various Compassionart songs\n\nand another 120+ worship songs\n\n~source CCLI\n\nI wished that Baloche had done one of the songs from the French album, although Belleville, Ontario, while it’s part of Canada, isn’t exactly a French part of the country. I also wished that a couple of the songs from Compassionart had been part of the concert, especially with all the airplay they are currently getting, not to mention the natural lead-in they would have been to the Compassion appeal before the intermission. But with over two hours already accounted for, these aren’t major concerns.\n\nMy biggest take-away from the evening is that when you subtract the stories and testimony and some of the lighter moments, just about 100% of what was shared was from the Bible. If you want to make your mark as a worship leader, begin in the Word.\n\nGiven my strong suspicion that no two Paul Baloche events are the same, I would definitely buy a ticket for another concert, now that I’m a Christian concertgoer once again.\n\n…\n\nWanna read more about worship?
