        "text": "Moments before the 2024 ACM Awards on May 16th, as country music fans were wondering what surprises might be in store during the Frisco, Texas ceremony, Morgan Wallen offered up an unexpected treat of his own by sharing a new unreleased song.\n\nThe snippet for âLove Somebodyâ, which was accompanied by a video of the Sneedville singer-songwriter cruising down the river in Nashville, follows the release of Morgan's blockbuster collaboration with Post Malone, âI Had Some Helpâ on May 10th.\n\nExcitingly, this seems to signal that new music from Morgan Wallen is immanent, with âLove Somebodyâ the latest in a string of unreleased teasers for tracks such as the fan-favourite âLies, Lies, Liesâ, âI Guessâ and âCome Back As A Redneckâ. With âLies, Lies, Liesâ dropping on July 5th, we're hoping âLove Somebodyâ is next in line for a streaming release ahead of Morgan's One Thing At A Time follow-up.\n\nAlthough we're still waiting on an official release date, Morgan Wallen captioned the infectious, pop-leaning clip with a caption teasing, âI feel like this one's gonna sound good on the boatâ. This surely means Morgan's planning on dropping âLove Somebodyâ before summer gets fully underway, with the uptempo offering seemingly set to be the perfect heatwave companion for âI Had Some Helpâ.\n\nAcross the snippets he's been sharing so far, Morgan Wallen has been showcasing his willingness to venture into new sonic territory, epitomised on âLove Somebodyâ.\n\nWhile Morgan's signature drawl and the heartbroken, whiskey-fuelled lyrics ensure this track remains grounded in country music, the front-and-centre drum pattern and hazy synth backing give âLove Somebodyâ an â80s pop ambience - something the âThought You Should Knowâ hitmaker hasn't explored before now.\n\nâRumors goin' all over town\n\nCan't keep my name out your mouth these days\n\nYeah they say\n\nThat I live too fast to settle down\n\nThe truth is I just ain't about these games\n\nThey allâplayâ\n\nMorgan Wallen begins by addressing an ex, lamenting the fact that she keeps spreading negative rumours and gossip about him, presumably during the aftermath of their break-up. He then highlights the contents of one of these tall tales she's been telling, in which his old flame implies Morgan is living âtoo fast to settle downâ.\n\nThis aligns with the rowdy, rule-breaking persona that's often associated with Morgan Wallen, but he reveals in the next line that his reasons for not getting into a long-term relationship having nothing to do with his 100mph touring lifestyle. Rather, he simply wants to avoid âthe gamesâ being played by the women he meets.\n\nâWannaâfind\n\nSomethingâstronger than theâwhiskey\n\nAnd, oh, I'veâtried\n\nBut every time I feel you kiss me, keep comin' up emptyâ\n\nHe goes on to emphasise that, even though he's had some disappointing romantic experiences of late, he's still holding out hope that he can find the one. Alcohol has been a recurring theme throughout Morgan's catalogue, and he often utilises this as a tool for accentuating a point, as he does here by underlining he wants to find a love that has a stronger effect on him than his beloved whiskey.\n\nInterestingly, Morgan Wallen again addresses his ex - or perhaps an on-off partner - directly, admitting that he doesn't feel anything close to a spark or passion when they kiss.\n\nâYeah, I just wanna love somebody, who won't leave a hole in my heart\n\nI just wanna love somÐµbody, that don't want me fallin' apart\n\nAnd I'd be lucky if I evÐµr find, somethin' more than a crazy night\n\nI just wanna love somebody, who ain't hypnotizedâ\n\nThe sinuous, addictive hook revolves around Morgan Wallen's repeated declarations that he's desperately looking to love someone that won't leave him feeling cold and alone. He hints at a series of toxic previous relationships - as he does on âI Guessâ and âI Had Some Helpâ - by suggesting that a number of his exes were actively wanting to see him âfallinâ apartâ, ultimately leaving a âhole in his heartâ.\n\nAlthough there's an undercurrent of quiet optimism about the prospect of falling in love, Morgan Wallen concludes the chorus by sharing that he thinks it may be a long shot, and that he'd âbe lucky if I evÐµr find somethin' more than a crazy nightâ.\n\nAlongside the social media teaser video for âLove Somebodyâ, Morgan Wallen joked in the caption about the ideal setting in which he thinks fans should sit back and enjoy this summery new earworm, âI feel like this one's gonna sound good on the boatâ. We can't help but agree - but a full-length version would sound even better...\n\nâRumors goin' all over town\n\nCan't keep my name out your mouth these days\n\nYeah they say\n\nThat I live too fast to settle down\n\nThe truth is I just ain't about these games\n\nThey allâplay\n\nWannaâfind\n\nSomethingâstronger than theâwhiskey\n\nAnd, oh, I'veâtried\n\nBut every time I feel you kiss me, keep comin' up empty\n\nYeah\n\nI just wanna love somebody, who won't leave a hole in my heart\n\nI just wanna love somÐµbody, that don't want me fallin' apart\n\nAnd I'd be lucky if I evÐµr find, somethin' more than a crazy night\n\nI just wanna love somebody, who ain't hypnotizedâ\n\nFor more on Morgan Wallen, see below:"
