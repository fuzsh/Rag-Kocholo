        "text": "Mahalia Jackson’s version of “Somebody Bigger than You and I” from her 1960, album “I Believe” emphasizes humbleness and the need to perceive that our actions and achievements in life are part of a larger, more significant picture.\n\nAmerican singer Mahalia Jackson otherwise known as the “Queen of gospel music,” is widely considered as one of the most influential vocalists of the 20th century. She also became the first gospel recording artist to tour Europe.\n\nRELATED: Never Lose Hope with Mahalia Jackson’s “There’ll Be Peace in The Valley for Me”\n\nThrough this song, Mahalia sought to convey the message that no matter our accomplishments or struggles, we should know our place and be aware of God’s superiority.\n\nMeaning Behind the Song\n\nThe powerful song was inspired by powerful words about God’s greatness. It emphasizes recognizing that there is a higher power far greater than ourselves.\n\nWritten by Johnny Lange, Hy Heath, and Sonny Burke, Jackson aims to express the belief that what God awards upon us can also be taken away. It talks about the momentary nature of blessings and the importance of remaining humble.\n\nRELATED: From Rock to Gospel: Elvis Presley’s Soulful “Somebody Bigger Than You and I”\n\nThe song’s lyrics illustrate our place in the broad perspective of things. It highlights that no matter how high we may sense we have risen, we should remember that God, as the supreme creator, is above all.\n\nSo if you haven’t heard Mahalia Jackson’s version of “Somebody Bigger than You and I,” you can enjoy the full performance below."
