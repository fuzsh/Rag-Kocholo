        "text": "There are a handful of songs in American pop culture that are so pervasive and successful, it’s likely that there isn’t anyone left in the country who hasn’t heard them. One of the best examples of one of these inescapable smashes is Journey’s “Don’t Stop Believin’,” which has just earned a very special honor.\n\nAccording to the RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America), “Don’t Stop Believin’” is now an 18-times platinum-certified single. That means that between pure sales and other forms of consumption–namely streaming–the song has shifted at least 18 million equivalent units in the United States alone.\n\nNow that it’s been certified 18-times platinum, “Don’t Stop Believin’” ranks as the biggest song in America–but it’s not alone in this position. Journey’s most beloved single ties with the only track in U.S. history that has already reached that milestone. Post Malone and Swae Lee’s “Sunflower”—officially titled “Sunflower (Spider-Man: Into The Spider-Verse)”—was certified 18-times platinum last May.\n\nThe announcement that “Don’t Stop Believin’” had reached such an impressive milestone came as something of a surprise. Before this latest honor, the song had only ever been certified up to quadruple platinum status. It hit that mark in May 2013. In the more than decade since then, the RIAA hadn’t bestowed any additional certifications on the hit, but clearly it was accruing millions of sales and equivalent units shifted behind the scenes.\n\n“Don’t Stop Believin’” was released in October 1981, and its potential was made clear pretty quickly. The song rose to No. 9 on the Hot 100, becoming one of Journey’s biggest hits. Even though the tune wasn’t their highest-rising track on the chart, it’s become the rock band’s signature smash in the decades since it dropped.\n\nThe smash was so powerful, it helped Journey score their first No. 1 album. The set that “Don’t Stop Believin’” was featured on, Escape, was released months before the tune was spun off as a proper single, and it conquered the Billboard 200.\n\nCurrently, the runner-up on the ranking of the most-consumed and most-certified songs in U.S. history is Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road.” That single has been certified 17-times platinum, and it will surely improve that figure in the coming years. Three hits are tied at 16-times platinum status–Drake’s “God’s Plan,” Ed Sheeran’s “Thinking Out Loud,” and Imagine Dragons’ “Radioactive.”"
