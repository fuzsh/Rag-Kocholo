        "text": "Paul Baloche is probably one of the best known worship leaders / songwriters of the present day, having penned classics such as “Open the Eyes of my Heart” and “Praise is Rising” – songs I know I have sung on many occasions and which are sung in churches around the world every week. The first 12 tracks (co-written with some very big names in worship music such as Brenton Brown and Graham Kendrick) from the original album release were recorded live in 2006 at Paul’s home church in Texas. This is followed on the current release by 6 updated versions with new voices and varied arrangements. The tracks begin with ‘Hosanna (Praise is Rising)’, perhaps one of Paul’s best-known tunes which I have become used to being full of energy and sung with some gusto! However, this rendition is far more relaxed in its delivery – pleasant enough, but never really building up into the rip-roaring praise anthem I was expecting. Just when you think the drums and guitars are building, they drop back again and the song continues at pretty much the same pace all the way through. The mid-paced ‘Because of Your Love’ follows on with mainly piano, guitar and some very low-key drums. There’s nothing musically spectacular here but do have to make note of some great vocals on here from Paul’s wife which blend so well. The pace is wound even further back with the title track ‘A Greater Song’ where in the earlier part of the song, we see the vocals shine through as opposed to the musical arrangements, although the music does build in the latter half which helps lift the mood a little. In stark contrast, we then have ‘I Will Boast’ which cranks up the levels significantly and is more of a classic worship anthem which I can imagine being sung at many of the summer worship events/festivals. OK, today it may not be the most modern and funky arrangement, but it still holds its own and has stood the test of time well with bags of energy and enthusiasm in the vocals. ‘Your Name’ winds things back down again with subtle strings in the intro and throughout which work well in adding to the atmosphere of the track. We are treated to some build up in the chorus though, so it doesn’t fall flat. We don’t see much change in style and delivery until ‘Thank You Lord’ which is classic Country and Western in style, complete with train beat drums, Hammond style keyboards and steel guitar. I’m not generally a fan of the genre, but I did enjoy this rendition as it reminded me of some of David Crowder’s older work, especially ‘My Beloved’. The following 3 tracks are low to mid-paced numbers with ‘Just as I Am’ being a beautiful, albeit very brief rendition led by Mrs Baloche. ‘Rising’ brings us back to worship anthem territory with more upbeat instrumentation, good build up and some effective choral-style vocal backing. ‘Hosanna’ is the first of the “reimagined” tracks which to my mind beat the original into submission with much more of the build-up and gusto I have come to love in this song, so for me it’s the best of the remixes. Some of the reworked tracks I felt were better than others. ‘What Can I Do’ I found a little dull but ‘You Have Been So Good’ was an improvement on the original, with some good strings and subtly delivered vocals giving it the feel of a love song. Overall, a good well produced release with a few notable tracks, but not sure those with the original recording will feel massive benefits in updating their collection. 8/10 Simon Redfern"
