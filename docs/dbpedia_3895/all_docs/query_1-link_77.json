        "text": "The worship song “Shout to the Lord” is how old?! Yup, if you can believe it, the tune that some say started the turn of CCM to its current worship bent, is celebrating thirty years in 2024.\n\nTo be sure, worship music had been in existence prior to Hillsong Church and Darlene Zschech via Maranatha and Vineyard, but nothing quite like the worldwide smash “Shout to the Lord.”\n\nWell, I began thinking about the other influential worship songs of the last 25-30 years and my cynicism quickly turned to enthusiasm as I began making a mental list of others I’d put in that category. That list reached more than twenty before I knew it so I figured I’d just keep going and match the anniversary of the song (30 years) with thirty songs I think had the biggest influence on the worldwide church in that span.\n\nFull warning: this is not a deeply researched list. I simply went from memory of what I’ve experienced, read about, and heard the last thirty years. I’m sure there are plenty of gaps that others can fill in, this is simply a conversation starter and celebration of what I think were/are the cream of the crop. Please add yours too.\n\nAnyway, here we are. Thank you for checking out the list. If you’ve read my blog/lists before you may be expecting it to be ranked, but I decided against it, simply looking to identify the thirty most “influential” or what I think are the “essentials” of congregational-directed songs. I also decided to go with a one-song per artist rule to highlight as many artists as possible. They are in order of the year they released starting with 1994 and working up to the present day in 2024 at the time of this writing.\n\nYou may also enjoy: These 5 Albums “Altared” the Christian Music Industry\n\nLastly, I included an additional twenty of my personal favorites and will link my All-time Favorites Worship Playlist of nearly 200 songs which I sourced this list from at the end of that post.\n\nHere we go!\n\n“Shout to the Lord” – Darlene Zschech (Hillsong Worship) (1994)\n\n“Better is One Day” – Matt Redman (1995)\n\n“Breathe” – Marie Barnett (1996)\n\n“I Could Sing of Your Love Forever” – Delirious (1997)\n\nIt was a simple staple of the era.\n\n“Days of Elijah” – Robin Mark (1997)\n\n“Trading My Sorrows (Yes Lord)” – Darrell Evans (1998)\n\n“The Heart of Worship” – Matt Redman (1998)\n\nOne could make an argument that this is the most “important” worship song of the last 30 years and you’d get no argument from me. we still need it more than ever.\n\n“Above All” – Lenny Leblanc/Paul Baloche (2000)\n\n“God of Wonders” – Marc Byrd/Steve Hindalong (2000)\n\nAside from “Shout to the Lord” or “Heart of Worship” this is the first worship song I remember dominating worship sets in nearly every church across America.\n\n“Open the Eyes of My Heart” – Paul Baloche (2000)\n\n“Here I Am to Worship” – Tim Hughes (2001)\n\n“How Great is Our God” – Chris Tomlin (2004)\n\nThis one celebrate twenty years in 2024! This one may have surpassed “Shout to the Lord” as THE most sung and known song overall. It would certainly be in the convo for #1 if I were ranking the list.\n\n“Friend of God” – Israel Houghton/Michael Gungor (2003)\n\n“How He Loves” – John Mark McMillan (2005)\n\nOh who could forget the “sloppy wet kiss” vs. David Crowder Band’s change of lyric on their cover to “unforeseen kiss?!” More importantly, which lyric do you like better?! 😂 I’m unashamedly team “sloppy wet kiss” and prefer JMM’s version. The story behind the song may surprise you and is definitely worth looking up if you’re curious, as is John’s emotionally gut-wrenching version on his album The Song Inside the Sounds of Breaking Down.\n\n“Jesus Paid it All” – Kristian Stanfill (Passion) (2006)\n\nBoth this tune and the one below it brought in some hymns to be modernized or hymn-like structure that I wish were utilized more in our present worship leading. It’s needed and appreciated by us old guys. 😉\n\n“In Christ Alone” – Keith & Kristin Getty (2006)\n\n“Revelation Song” – Kari Jobe/Gateway Church (2006)\n\nThe song was inescapable for the rest of the decade from 2006 forward with multiple covers from other artists keeping it evergreen. Well deserved. Songwriter Jennie Lee Riddle really nails it and Kari Jobe brought it to life vocally.\n\n“Everlasting God” – Brenton Brown (2006)\n\n“Your Love Never Fails” – Chris McClarney (2008)\n\nGods Not Dead (Like a Lion) – Daniel Bashta (2010)\n\nCovered by both David Crowder Band and then again by The Newsboys, the song also inspired a movie franchise. I’ll take Crowder’s version from Passion: Awakening (2010).\n\n“Holy Spirit” – Bryan & Katie Torwalt (2012)\n\n“Oceans (Where Feet May Fail)” – Hillsong United (2013)\n\nHere’s another pivot point song for worship music. This. Song. Was. HUGE. I truly believe the entire CCM industry was swung way to the worship side from this point forward.\n\n“This is Amazing Grace” – Phil Wickham (2013)\n\n“Good Good Father” – House fires/Pat Barrett (2015)\n\n“Waymaker” – Sinach (2015)\n\nWritten by Nigerian-gospel singer Sinach, Leeland and Michael W. Smith brought this truly great song to a much wider audience. Terrific tune.\n\n“Reckless Love” – Cory Asbury (2017)\n\nAnother hotly debated song…is God’s love reckless? Is it calculated? I know one thing tor site, it’s mysterious and glorious. Also, Asbury is a top-notch writer worth digging into his greater catalogue.\n\n“Goodness of God” – Bethel Music (2019)\n\nThis one still dominates CCLI charts and is song regularly almost 5 years later, and that’s pretty hard to do in the worship scene/music industry that is becoming churning over songs quicker and quicker the more the market is flooded with them.\n\n“The Blessing” – Kari Jobe/Cody Carnes (2020)\n\n“Graves into Gardens” – Brandon Lake (Elevation Church) (2020)\n\n“Jireh” – Maverick City (2021)\n\nThis collective of worshippers known as Maverick City has taken the genre by storm in relatively quick fashion. Since 2019 I’d venture a guess that no worship artist or church worship has been as prolific with new songs, EPs, albums, or collaborations.\n\n20 Additional Favorites:\n\n“Hosanna” – Brooks Fraser (Hillsong United (2007)\n\n“Blessed Be the Name” – Matt Redman (2002)\n\n“Lord, I Need You” – Matt Maher (2013)\n\n“Great Are You Lord” – All Sons & Daughters (2014)\n\n“O Come to the Altar” – Elevation Worship (2015)\n\n“10,000 Reasons” – Matt Redman (2013)\n\n“Death Was Arrested” – Northpoint Church (2018)\n\n“Tremble” – Mosaic MSC (2016)\n\n“Who You Say I Am” – Brooke Fraser/Hillsong Worship (2018)\n\n“What a Beautiful Name” – Brooke Fraser/Hillsong Worship (2017)\n\n“You Won’t Relent” – Misty Edwards/Jesus Culture (2008)\n\n“No Longer Slaves” – Johnathan & Melissa Hesler/Bethel (2015)\n\n“Firm Foundation (He Won’t)” – Cody Carnes (2023)\n\n“Is He Worthy?” – Andrew Peterson (2018)\n\n“Amazing Grace (My Chains Are Gone)” – Chris Tomlin (2006)\n\n“Gratitude” – Brandon Lake (2020)\n\n“He Knows My Heart” – Tommy Walker (1999)\n\n“Love Note” – UPPERROOM (2021)\n\n“Break Every Chain” – Will Reagan & United Pursuit (2009)\n\n“No One Like You” – David Crowder Band (2002)\n\nWhew! That’s fifty songs, and of course there are many others with perhaps your favorite not making my list. Or maybe I have an egregious unintentional snub, and if so (it’s likely) please let me know in the comments. I have been known to retroactively take a readers suggestion from time to time.\n\nAlright, here’s the promised 200 Song Worship Mix. Enjoy!\n\n-Josh"
