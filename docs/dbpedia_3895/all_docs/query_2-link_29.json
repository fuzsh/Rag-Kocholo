        "text": "Fri, May 24th 2024 11:55 am\n\nNew focus track, ‘wannabe,’ available today\n\nPress Release\n\nDanny Gokey's fifth studio album, “Sound of Heaven,” is coming July 26. The latest instant latest grat track, \"wannabe,\" is available across all DSPs today. The three-time Grammy nominee, three-time K-LOVE Male Vocalist of the Year winner and eight-time Dove Award winner’s last album, “Jesus People,” peaked at No. 1 on Billboard's Top Christian Albums chart and has since accumulated 300 million global streams.\n\nFeaturing 11 brand-new songs, “Sound of Heaven” captures a wide variety of sounds and messages that reflect Gokey's passion for uplifting music and his heart for people. The grat track, \"wannabe,\" follows previously released tracks \"Todo El Mundo” and his recent radio song, “I Got You,\" currently No. 23 at AC radio (earning over 4.5 million global streams).\n\nProduced by an array of producers including Ben Glover, Jordan Sapp, Jeff Sojka and Colby Wedgeworth, the project is as diverse sonically as it is thematically. Fans will bop their heads to the energetic title track, “Sound of Heaven,\" dance to the Spanish-influenced track “Lean On Me,\" and appreciate the notable features including Evan Craft, Niko Eme, Limoblaze and Naomi Raine. “Still On The Throne” and “Open Up The Gates” round out the album with a worship focus, the latter of which will be the next single available on June 28.\n\n\"The phrase ‘Sound of Heaven,’ and each of the songs on this album, will mean different things to different people in different places of life, and I believe that each of these songs communicate the hopeful messages of heaven in ways that will speak to people – whatever their season of life,\" Gokey shared.\n\n\"I believe that the 'sound of heaven' is as diverse as all of God's creation. Some people think it's one-dimensional with just angels singing with harps, but it's way more than that. It's full of joy, where all creation in heaven and earth comes together and makes a beautiful sound,\" he added. \"To me, there’s no greater joy than us getting to participate in the 'sounds of heaven' by glorifying him with our lives here on earth. In whatever walk of life or profession, whatever nation, tribe or tongue, we all make up the 'sound of heaven' if we're following Jesus. My prayer is that each of these songs meet each person right where they are and help them experience the 'sound of heaven' in a fresh new way, in just the way they need it!\"\n\nMore on Danny Gokey\n\nThree-time Grammy Nominee, three-time KLOVE Male Vocalist of the Year, Dove Award winner, and eight-time Dove Award nominee Gokey became a favorite of millions of fans as a top 3 finalist on season eight of “American Idol.” Following “Idol,” Gokey dropped his first album, “My Best Days,” and has since celebrated five No. 1s, including his follow-up releases “Hope In Front of Me,” “Rise,” “Haven’t Seen It Yet,” “Jesus People,” and holiday albums, “Christmas Is Here” and “The Greatest Gift.”\n\nSpawning singles “We All Need Jesus,” “Love God Love People,” and RIAA Gold-certified “Hope In Front of Me,” “Tell Your Heart to Beat Again” and “Haven’t Seen It Yet,” Gokey has cemented his place on the radio charts with multi-week, multi-chart-topping runs in the U.S., Canada, and now Latin markets with the releases of Spanish singles and collaborations.\n\nThe desire to make a broader impact with his message of hope led to the founding of nonprofit organization Better Than I Found It, which is doing community giveback “bus stops” during touring initiatives. Danny and his wife, Leyicet, also launched “Livin’ la Vida Gokey,” a podcast featuring conversations about faith and family."
