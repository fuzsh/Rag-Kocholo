With poetic lyrics and emotive vocals, her songs follow a journey of faith and life.\n\nRorie debuted her first Full-Length Album, Valley in the Mirror, in winter 2020 (funded through Kickstarter and released completely independently). With honest songs written everywhere from her living room to the emergency room, the album is the most comprehensive picture of Rorieâ€™s artistry to date.\n\nThe music is a vibrant mixture of synth-pop energy and singer-songwriter authenticity. In September 2021, she released a new EP called Resonate, which is a collection of hymns, worship songs, and spiritual songs (four originals and two classics).\n\nRorie is continuously writing new music and was recently featured by AMC Theaters and on NBCLX.\n\nRelated\n\nTagged as Bloom Radio Rorie\n\nWe are a Christian urban radio station whose mission is to minister to people of all walks of life, across all age brackets, and in all parts of the world.
