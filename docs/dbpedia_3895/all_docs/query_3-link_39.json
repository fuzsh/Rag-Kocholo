        "text": "Taylor Swift declared that Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist, and he agreed very much. A few weeks after he was name-dropped in the title track of Swift’s The Tortured Poets Department, Puth has broken his silence theoretically by announcing his latest single, “Hero,” on TikTok, via lip singing of course. “These last couple of weeks have been really crazy for obvious reasons, but I wanted to share something with you,” Puth wrote on screen as he mouthed the words to the song. “Sometimes I get a little nervous being overly honest in my music which is why this was sitting on my hard drive for awhile. But I think someone out there was giving me a sign that I needed to release it… Thank you for your support… you know who you are.” Obviously, he means Swift, who’s probably stoked she’s getting a new Puth song. It comes out on May 24, giving her time to add it to her pre-show playlist on the Eras Tour in Portugal. As for Puth’s other supporter, maybe Matty Healy will set some time aside to listen to this one."
