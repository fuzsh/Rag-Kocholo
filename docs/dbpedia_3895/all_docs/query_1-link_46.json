Here is a list of the most popular old Christian worship songs.\n\nMost of the time when we see songs trending, they have been released in the last few months. This is a list of exceptions. These songs are rising on the charts and released in the 90s and 2000s. These are classics and throwbacks that are making a comeback. Take a look at these old worship songs that are still trending.\n\nPrayer is a vital part of a Christian's relationship with God - it is our conversation with our Creator who knows us intimately and loves us deeply. And prayer isn't just talking, but can be singing as well. We can sing out our heart's cry, just as much as we can speak, whisper, or think our prayers. Download chord charts, lead sheets, or choir arrangements of songs and hymns about prayer.\n\nIn the last 20 years, Christian songwriters and worship leaders have caught on to the fact that Christmas is a significant time for worship in the church. More than just Christmas carols, there are so many great worship songs that highlight the themes of Christmas in a style that flows with worship songs we sing all throughout the year. These songs talk about joy, hope and peace in ways that are relevant to our modern lives, just as the classic carols connect us to the rich theology of our history."
