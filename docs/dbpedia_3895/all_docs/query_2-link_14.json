        "text": "- September 11th, 2012 –\n\nSIXTH STUDIO ALBUM ‘AWAKENED’ DUE OUT SEPTEMBER 25 ON METAL BLADE\n\nGROUP TO HEADLINE PRIVATE, FREE ALBUM RELEASE SHOW TO CELEBRATE METAL BLADE 30TH ANNIVERSARY PARTY TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 25 IN NEW YORK CITY AT SANTOS PARTY HOUSE\n\nAs the Grammy-nominated rock group AS I LAY DYING prepare to release AWAKENED September 25 on Metal Blade, the group has premiered their first single and video “A Greater Foundation” today (September 11) via RCRD LBL and PUREVOLUME. To listen, to the track on RCRD LBL, visit: http://rcrdlbl.com/. To watch the clip on PUREVOLUME, click: purevolume.com:\n\nMeanwhile, AS I LAY DYING are set to headline a special album release show that’s also in celebration of the 30th Anniversary of Metal Blade Records Tuesday, September 25 at Santos Party House in New York City. For entry to the private, free album release show, fans can pre-order AWAKENED at three-New York City area independent record stores starting Friday, September 14 and receive a free laminate for access into the show. Participating indie record shops include: Looney Tunes (31 Brookvale Ave. West Babylon, NY), Vintage Vinyl (51 Lafayette Rd Fords, NJ) and J&R (1 Park Row). For fans that cannot be in New York, the hosts of VH1 Classic “That Metal Show” Don Jamieson & Jim Florentine and Jose Mangin of SiriusXM’s “Liquid Metal” will emcee a live online broadcast starting at 8:00 pm Eastern via Livestream at: www.livestream.com/metalblade.\n\nNext up, AS I LAY DYING will launch a European tour October 15 with Trivium, Caliban and Upon A Burning Body before returning to the U.S. for California Metal Fest 6 at the NOS Events Center in San Bernardino, CA on Saturday, November 24.\n\nAWAKENED–which marks the group’s sixth studio album– is garnering early critical acclaim. In his 4/5 star album review for Alternative Press magazine, writer Jason Schreurs hailed, “Screamer Tim Lambesis has never sounded better than on a metal anthem like ‘Overcome,’ his shattered scream completely ripping faces. …Awakened is the best As I Lay Dying album you can point to as metal both modernized and maximized.” (October 2012). Elsewhere, in his 4/5 star album review for Artist Direct , Rick Florino singled out the preview track “Cauterized” as “An unshakable anthem, the song is the best kind of aural assault and battery from one of heavy metal’s most dynamic outfits. Morphing from a steamrolling six-string storm courtesy of Nick Hipa and Phil Sgrosso, the track shifts into a polyrhythmic crusher fueled by drummer Jordan Mancino and bassist Josh Gilbert’s immortal groove. Tim Lambesis seamlessly segues from a gruff growl into one of the group’s tightest and toughest clean choruses to date.” Florino adds, “‘Cauterize’ is a metallic remedy of the highest order. As I Lay Dying prove to be a genre leader by progressing while pummeling, and it’s evidence that Awakened is another level altogether. They’re set to wake up the genre with a landmark album.” (September 2012)\n\nFor AWAKENED, the San Diego-based band–NICK HIPA (guitar), TIM LAMBESIS (vocals), JORDAN MANCINO (drums), PHIL SGROSSO (guitar) and JOSH GILBERT (bass)–holed up in the Blasting Room in Fort Collins, CO with renowned rock producer Bill Stevenson (Descendents) and mixer Colin Richardson. AWAKENED marks the follow-up to the Decas EP (2011) which reached # 2 on the iTunes Rock Chart. The group’s last LP, 2010?s immensely successful The Powerless Rise, debuted on the Billboard Top 200 at #10. The Powerless Rise also reached #2 on Billboard’s Independent Albums Chart and #3 on Billboard’s Hard Music Albums Chart.
