        "text": "(FRANKLIN, Tennessee) – (FRANKLIN, Tennessee) – This week, Nashville-based Christian music label, Integrity Music, moved to a new location, encompassing the entire top floor of a brand-new office building at 5030 Carothers Parkway in Franklin, Tennessee.\n\nThe nearly 15,000 square-foot office will be the home and hub for Integrity’s 60 global employees – nearly 50 of whom are based in Nashville – as well as serve as a welcoming space for artists, songwriters, and the music community to collaborate and create.\n\nIntegrity Music had outgrown its smaller 4,500 square-foot space in Brentwood, where the company has been located for the past nine years. The new, specially-designed space features a photo and video studio, a podcast studio, and two premium songwriting rooms, as well as a 1,300 square-foot multi-purpose room for gatherings and events.\n\n“This beautiful new building represents the culmination of years of prayer, hard work, and growth,” said Integrity Music and David C Cook CEO, Bill Reeves. “Every detail was planned with our staff, artists, and friends throughout the Christian music industry in mind. We are excited to share Integrity Music’s new home with them, as well as with the greater Nashville community.”\n\nJason Jones, VP of Creative, added, “Our goal for this space is that everyone feels welcome, inspired, and empowered to contribute to revealing God's Kingdom together.”\n\nWhat began in 1985 as Integrity’s Hosanna! Music, the label became a significant vehicle in pioneering the widespread popularity of modern worship music. Today, about one-third of songs sung in churches around the world today are Integrity Music songs, including the breakout worship song, “Way Maker” which has charted in every country CCLI represents and is being sung globally in every major language. Integrity’s roster includes well-known artists such as Paul Baloche, Sarah Kroger, Leeland, and Grammy Award-winning worship leader and songwriter Matt Redman, whose double Grammy-winning song “10,000 Reasons” has charted in CCLI’s top 10 for over a decade."
