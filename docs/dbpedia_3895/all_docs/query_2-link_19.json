Largely written over the course of their average of 120 tour dates a year, CHOOSE TO WORSHIP features 13 tracks that range in sound and meaning. The album all returns to a greater message that’s explained through the album artwork, “We used a labyrinth as our album art concept to reflect the confusing, messiness of life. So many twists and turns, so many little micro decisions, so much uncertainty and doubt, so much fear. In the middle of all this it can be so easy to forget to make the one choice that ultimately makes all the others insignificant : to love God with all our heart, soul, mind and strength.”\n\nCHOOSE TO WORSHIP Album Track Listing:\n\nI CHOOSE TO WORSHIP\n\nREVIVAL ANTHEM\n\nDAY OF VICTORY\n\nSING IT FROM THE SHACKLES\n\nMY ADVOCATE\n\nSTILL\n\nUNCONDITIONAL\n\nBEHOLD HE COMES\n\nDEFIANT\n\nYOUR NAME IS POWER\n\nREND THE HEAVENS\n\nWHOLEHEARTED\n\nYOUR NAME IS POWER – Acoustic\n\nListen to CHOOSE TO WORSHIP by Rend Collective here now!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BG11iiDKY8Y"
