        "text": "hello, new guy here time to bring out a shovel and dig this up… since I’m intrigued by the beat buddy\n\nI attend a very small church with no drummer and all guitarists (4 guitars 1 bass… a piano player every once in awhile) and i am not a worship leader so I am wanting to know if theses songs that are listed will work with the mini or will I be better off getting the regular?\n\nreally not looking to spend $300.00+ when i can pick up a mini for a $100… not even sure this would work for our set up so a $100 risk is better for me since it’s my purchase and not the church’s.\n\nbut if these general settings can be used quickly for the mini I can start suggesting some songs to at least help out with P&W\n\nI’m also a worship leader in a small church. I purchased the full BeatBuddy ($300), because of the loadable playlists using the SD card, shareable files, and the community support – Most of the files and configurations users share can only be used on this device.\n\nThe mini will work as long as you keep the same beat/setting for your whole worship set – which doesn’t give you the flexibility the as BeatBuddy.\n\nHere are my recommendations for P&W Leaders:\n\nPurchase the BeatBuddy (forgo the Mini)\n\nPurchase the Switch Peddle (allows for easy switching between songs in the play list AND accent cymbals)\n\nJoin Facebook Group BeatBuddy Worship – A growing community of worship leaders with BeatBuddy’s, sharing experiences and files pertaining to Praise and Worship.\n\nHope this recommendation helps.\n\nI play drums for that song at church and it should just be a straight 16th note rhythm at a faster tempo (I think about 140-150 bpm) for the chorus parts.\n\nFor the verses its just a kick drum and HH 8th notes, and then some toms added at the prechorus (maybe one of the Roc toms songs). An off the shelf BB song will not have all those variations, but you should be able to piece together a custom song with existing song parts already in the BB with no need to bring in any other beats/sounds.\n\nPlayaround with Pop 11 and Rock 12, maybe changing drum sets. You probably could put something together with those 2 and one of the toms beats."
