        "text": "(as seen in the Jan/Feb 2012 Worship Leader Magazine – pg. 28-33 / pic from their site)\n\nWorship Leader magazine recently published a list of the 20 most influential worship albums of the past twenty years. That’s a pretty big statement they are making. The word “influential” means so many things to so many people, so I believe they could have used a better word, but needless to say, that’s why I blog and they sell magazines. The list below is from their website and I’d like to ask you to take a gander at it, dissect it, and analyze it. Check out my questions below…\n\nFor fun and as a look down memory lane, we have chosen what we consider the top 20 most influential worship releases of the past 20 years.\n\n20. OFFERINGS – Third Day, 2000\n\n19. BREAK THROUGH – Tommy Walker, 2006\n\n18. ETERNITY – Misty Edwards, 2003\n\n17. WORSHIP – Michael W Smith, 2001\n\n16. HUNGRY – Vineyard UK, 1999\n\n15. WE CRY OUT – Jesus Culture, 2007\n\n14. HEART OF WORSHIP – Soul Survivor, 1996\n\n13. DONNIE MCCLURKIN – Donnie McClurken, 1997\n\n12. A COLLISION OR (3+4=7) – David Crowder Band, 2005\n\n11. SHOUT TO THE LORD – Hillsong, 1996\n\n10. PASSION: BETTER IS ONE DAY – Passion Band, 1999\n\n9. PRAY – Andrae Crouch, 2010\n\n8. BEAUTIFUL THINGS – Gungor, 2010\n\n7. FACEDOWN – Matt Redman, 2003\n\n6. UNITED WE STAND – Hillsong United, 2010\n\n5. CHANGE MY HEART, OH GOD – Vineyard, 1996\n\n4. LIVE FROM ANOTHER LEVEL – Israel Houghton, 2004\n\n3. A GREATER SONG – Paul Baloche, 2006\n\n2. ARRIVING – Chris Tomlin, 2004\n\n1. CUTTING EDGE – Delirious?, 2000\n\nHere are some questions for you:\n\nA) How many of these titles did you recognize?\n\nB) How many of these titles did/do you own?\n\nC) So, 16 of the best 20 worship releases have been released since 2000?\n\nD) Did you agree with these selections? If not, what other suggestion would you argue?\n\nI am not an expert in this field…anyone who claims to be is silly. But, I am fairly current on music releases and I feel as though I would have recognized the majority of this list. But, I only knew of eight of the twenty albums. I only own/have owned three of the twenty.\n\nAre they correct in this thinking? Why or why not? Leave us a comment!!!"
