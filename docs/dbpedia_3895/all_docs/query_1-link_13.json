Baloche was also nominated for Songwriter of the Year in 2002.Baloche uses his position as a recording artist to provide resources for churches.\n\nHis catalog of six albums is focused on providing worship music for the listener to worship along with, and for churches to use in their own services. His albums are released by Hosanna! Music, a division of Integrity Music.\n\nThrough Integrity, Baloche has also written a book, God Songs, and released instructional DVDs that cover a variety of issues central to contemporary worship, such as music styles, music theory, creating flow in worship, and guitar techniques (including his distinct open chord voicings).\n\nIn addition to his material output, Baloche annually participates in several seminars for worship leaders and musicians throughout North America (many of which are facilitated by Integrity), and has started to participate in seminars in Asia as well.\n\nHis 2006 release, A Greater Song, is a live recording featuring new songs, some cowritten with leading worship artists like Matt Redman (\"A Greater Song\") and Integrity executive vice president Don Moen (\"Thank You Lord\")."
