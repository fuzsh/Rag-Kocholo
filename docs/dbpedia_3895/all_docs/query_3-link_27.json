        "text": "Elton John is a world-renowned British singer, songwriter, pianist, and composer. Born Reginald Kenneth Dwight on March 25, 1947, in Pinner, Middlesex, England, he became one of the best-selling music artists of all time. Known for his flamboyant style and powerful performances, Elton John has produced numerous hits such as “Rocket Man,” “Your Song,” “Bennie and the Jets,” and “Candle in the Wind.”\n\nHe has won multiple awards, including Grammy Awards, Brit Awards, and an Academy Award for his work on “The Lion King.” Elton John is also known for his partnership with lyricist Bernie Taupin, which has been one of the most successful collaborations in music history.\n\nBeyond his music career, Elton John is a prominent philanthropist, particularly in the fight against HIV/AIDS. He established the Elton John AIDS Foundation in 1992, which has raised millions for HIV/AIDS prevention and support.\n\nElton John was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1998 for his services to music and charitable services. He continues to influence the music industry and remains a beloved figure worldwide.\n\nThis article explores his Elton John’s greatest songs, showcasing the remarkable impact of his work on the music industry.\n\nList Of Elton John’s 50 Greatest Songs\n\nElton John is a legendary British singer, songwriter, and pianist known for his amazing talent and timeless music. For over five decades, he has created some of the most memorable and iconic songs in music history. His greatest hits, like “Rocket Man,” “Your Song,” “Tiny Dancer,” and “Candle in the Wind,” have touched millions of fans worldwide. As the singer-songwriter begins his final big world tour, we rank his 50 greatest songs.\n\n50. Island Girl (1975)\n\nOne of Elton John’s most fun songs, but the lyrics (“Island girl, what you wanting with the white man’s world?”) made him stop performing it live in 1990.\n\n49. Part-Time Love (1978)\n\nElton took a break from his long-time songwriting partner Bernie Taupin. New lyricist Gary Osbourne didn’t quite match the same magic.\n\n48. Honky Cat (1972)\n\nThis playful song was overshadowed by “Rocket Man”, a bigger hit from the same album, Honky Chateau. Features the line “Time to drink whisky!”\n\n47. Come Back Baby (with Bluesology) (1965)\n\nRecorded when Elton, then known as Reg Dwight, was a teenager. It’s an early effort from his rhythm and blues band Bluesology.\n\n46. The Ballad of Blind Tom (2013)\n\nFrom the minimalist album The Diving Board, Elton recalls his early years with this song about a blind Deep South bluesman.\n\n45. Please (1995)\n\nA heartfelt song from Made in England, where Elton, as an older man, sings about love and asks, “let me grow old with you”.\n\n44. When Love Is Dying (with Leon Russell) (2010)\n\nElton’s first US performance was with Leon Russell, who later joined him for the album The Union. This song is about fading love.\n\n43. Believe (1995)\n\nAfter his throat surgery, Elton’s deeper voice shines in this song. He left the wild outfits and lifestyle of the 70s behind.\n\n42. Dan Dare (Pilot of the Future) (1975)\n\nInspired by the 1950s comic character Dan Dare, this song features one of the first uses of the talkbox, a special effects pedal.\n\n41. Blue Eyes (1982)\n\nA mid-career, Grammy-nominated gem, laden with dollops of trademark melancholy (“Blue eyes … holding back the tears, holding back the pain.”)\n\n40. Grey Seal (1973)\n\nThis lesser-known song from Goodbye Yellow Brick Road shows off Elton John’s great piano skills, similar to his version of The Who’s Pinball Wizard in the movie Tommy. It’s a classic 70s ballad perfect for stomping in Dr. Martens boots.\n\n39. All the Young Girls Love Alice (1973)\n\nThis energetic rock song from Goodbye Yellow Brick Road was originally about Alice Cooper but was quickly changed to be about a tragic lesbian schoolgirl sex worker.\n\n38. Circle of Life (1994)\n\nA big, famous ballad from Disney’s The Lion King with lyrics by Tim Rice. Elton created a “stunning demo” in just 90 minutes.\n\n37. Little Jeanie (1980)\n\nAfter a failed disco experiment with Victim of Love in 1979, new partner Gary Osbourne helped Elton return to the US top five with this soft-rock hit. Elton celebrated with a free concert in Central Park, dressed as Donald Duck.\n\n36. Nikita (1985)\n\nThis song features one of Elton’s best vocals and tells a story of a doomed love with an Eastern European border guard. The synthesizer solo is very 80s, just like shoulder pads.\n\n35. This Train Don’t Stop There Anymore (2001)\n\nFrom the film Songs from the West Coast, starring Justin Timberlake as Elton during his glam era, this is a classic Elton John ballad. Time to get the scarves out.\n\n34. Elderberry Wine (1973)\n\nWritten by Bernie Taupin, this song from Don’t Shoot Me, I’m Only the Piano Player features lively saxophone and piano. Despite some awkward lyrics, it’s a fun retro rocker.\n\n33. Don’t Let the Sun Go Down on Me (with George Michael) (1991)\n\nOriginally a hit in 1974, this big ballad about unrequited love became a No.1 hit again in the 90s when Elton and George Michael performed it together.\n\n32. Skyline Pigeon (1969)\n\nElton’s career improved after meeting lyricist Bernie Taupin. This stirring, hymn-like song, originally played on harpsichord, was later re-recorded by Elton and became an early favorite.\n\n31. Can You Feel the Love Tonight? (1994)\n\nWritten with Tim Rice for The Lion King, where it’s first sung by a meerkat and a warthog. Elton’s version became a hit, winning an Oscar and a Grammy.\n\n30. Border Song (1970)\n\nElton’s first song to chart in the US, this gospel-influenced track was later covered by Aretha Franklin. Their 1993 TV duet is a must-see.\n\n29. I Guess That’s Why They Call It the Blues (1983)\n\nAfter a six-year gap, Elton John and Bernie Taupin returned with this song featuring Stevie Wonder on harmonica. It’s a rejuvenated, bluesy track with Elton singing passionately.\n\n28. Sad Songs (Say So Much) (1984)\n\nElton loves emotional songs, and this one is a timeless anthem about the uplifting power of sad music. It’s a favorite on local radio.\n\n27. I’m Still Standing (1983)\n\nDespite his great 70s records, this 80s song is a standout. It’s a piano-driven celebration of resilience and has even inspired “I’m Still Standing” underwear.\n\n26. Madman Across the Water (1971)\n\nThis complex song from the album of the same name features what Elton calls “one of Bernie Taupin’s eeriest lyrics”. It’s written from the perspective of a person gone mad.\n\n25. I Want Love (2001)\n\nThis beautiful ballad, about love after addiction, became famous with a one-take video featuring Robert Downey Jr.. It has a Beatles-like quality and is heartfelt.\n\n24. Daniel (1973)\n\nOne of Elton’s biggest hits, this lovely ballad features the memorable line, “Daniel, you’re a star!”.\n\n23. Don’t Go Breaking My Heart (with Kiki Dee) (1976)\n\nThis duet with Kiki Dee came out the year Elton revealed he was bisexual. The playful song was his first British No.1 and he later performed it with Miss Piggy on The Muppet Show.\n\n22. Funeral for a Friend/Love Lies Bleeding (1973)\n\nThis 11-minute song shows Elton John’s love for prog rock. It also inspired the band name for Welsh rockers Funeral for a Friend.\n\n21. Step Into Christmas (1973)\n\nOne of the catchiest Christmas hits, popular during the era of festive glitter along with bands like Slade and Wizzard.\n\n20. Ego (1978)\n\nIn the late 70s, Elton was struggling with bulimia, seizures, and substance abuse. This song reflects his dramatic state and possibly addresses his own ego or rival David Bowie.\n\n19. The Bitch Is Back (1974)\n\nInspired by a comment from Bernie Taupin’s wife, this hard rocker features John Lennon on tambourine. Elton considers it his theme song.\n\n18. Crocodile Rock (1972)\n\nA playful, upbeat song that pays homage to the rock ‘n’ roll era. Elton sings about fun times with Susie.\n\n17. Levon (1971)\n\nThis song was inspired by Levon Helm from The Band. Elton liked the name so much he named his first son Zachary Levon Furnish-John.\n\n16. Rotten Peaches (1971)\n\nAn underrated gem from Madman Across the Water about a prisoner missing home. Part of Elton and Bernie’s nearly flawless run between 1970 and 1975.\n\n15. Someone Saved My Life Tonight (1975)\n\nA dark, seven-minute hit about Elton’s suicidal feelings in the late 60s. The “someone” is Long John Baldry, who offered advice. Ironically, Elton attempted suicide again shortly after the song’s release.\n\n14. Sacrifice (1989)\n\nElton’s first British solo No. 1 hit. A haunting ballad about a couple drifting apart, it became a personal favorite for both Elton and Bernie.\n\n13. Philadelphia Freedom (1975)\n\nA tribute to Philly soul and the Philadelphia Freedoms tennis team. This strings-peppered song became his fourth US No. 1.\n\n12. Are You Ready for Love (remix) (2003)\n\nOriginally released in 1979, this disco cut was remixed by DJ Ashley Beedle in 2003, giving Elton an unexpected fifth British No. 1.\n\n11. Candle in the Wind (1974)\n\nA haunting ballad about Marilyn Monroe, which Elton later rewrote and performed at Princess Diana’s funeral, becoming the biggest-selling UK single ever.\n\n10. Empty Garden (Hey Hey Johnny) (1982)\n\nA tribute to John Lennon, who was killed in 1980. This touching ballad remains one of Elton’s most affecting songs.\n\n9. Song for Guy (1978)\n\nA mostly instrumental piece inspired by the death of Elton’s messenger boy, Guy Burchett. The song’s only words are “Life isn’t everything.”\n\n8. Sorry Seems To Be the Hardest Word (1976)\n\nA beautiful yet sad song about dying love, reflecting the toll of touring and drug use on Elton in the mid-70s.\n\n7. Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters (1972)\n\nNever released as a single, this song about New York’s crime and characters is one of Elton’s personal favorites.\n\n6. Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (1973)\n\nA huge, wistful ballad about disillusionment with fame, inspired by The Wizard of Oz. It’s the title track of his best-selling double album.\n\n5. Bennie and the Jets (1974)\n\nInitially deemed too far-out, this song became a US No. 1 thanks to soul and R&B stations. It imagines a futuristic rock band of androids.\n\n4. Your Song (1970)\n\nOne of Elton’s most-loved songs, it began as a B-side but became a hit, turning him into a pop star. It’s a favorite for many couples.\n\n3. Saturday Night’s Alright for Fighting (1973)\n\nA rocking classic from Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, known for its energetic guitar riff and raucous lyrics about a wild Saturday night.\n\n2. Rocket Man (I Think It’s Going To Be a Long, Long Time) (1972)\n\nThis 70s space travel anthem was inspired by something Bernie saw in the night sky. It also reflects Elton’s rise to stardom.\n\n1. Tiny Dancer (1971)\n\nIt flopped when it was released as a single in the US, but this six-minute track became one of Elton’s best-loved songs after featuring in Cameron Crowe’s 2000 film Almost Famous. It’s now weirdly ubiquitous in popular culture, referenced in song by David Guetta and Lana Del Rey, covered by Dave Grohl, and in a 2015 John Lewis advert (with a rumoured reappearance this year). When Ed Sheeran sings (in Castle on the Hill) of “driving at 90 down those country lanes”, Tiny Dancer, inevitably, is the song playing in the car. Perhaps the anthemic tune and Bernie’s poignant depiction of free-spirited California girls in the 1970s speaks to our timeless yearning for liberation.\n\nElton John’s Net Worth\n\nElton John’s net worth was estimated to be around $500 million. His wealth stems from his successful career as a singer-songwriter, pianist, and composer.
