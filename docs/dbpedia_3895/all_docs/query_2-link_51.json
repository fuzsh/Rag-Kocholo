        "text": "What “I got’s still not enough” of Dan + Shay’s new album “Bigger Houses”. It isn’t necessarily the best country album of the year but definitely one that is underrated and severely overlooked.\n\nReleased on September 15, 2023, multi Grammy Award-winning country duo, Dan Smyers and Shay Mooney, released their fifth studio album with two of their songs hitting Country Music Billboard Top 50 in less than a week: “Save Me The Trouble” and “Bigger Houses.” After touring in 2021, the couple’s relationship nearly met a dead end, but after they resolved their conflicts, they produced this highly anticipated album about the pursuit of true happiness and an ode to the idea of the American dream.\n\n“Save Me The Trouble,” a stirring ballad that examines the intricacies of love and forgiveness, is one of the album’s highlight tunes. Dan + Shay’s music speaks to anyone who has gone through the ups and downs of interactions because of its emotional lyrics and harmonies, and it welcomes listeners on their own personal journey of reconciliation.\n\n“Bigger Houses,” the album’s title track, is an anthem for dreamers. It pays homage to the American dream, with its vivid storytelling and soaring melodies. The music captures the essence of the duo’s journey from humble beginnings to universal stardom, while embracing the idea that sometimes the key to happiness lies not in material wealth but in the basic pleasures of life.\n\nAnother highlight is “The Road Less Traveled,” a reflective ballad that encourages listeners to break free from the shackles of conformity and continue on their own path. Its moving message and easy instrumentation transform it into a raw and emotionally charged piece that shows the compositional speed of Dan+ Shay.\n\nThe upbeat and delightful tune “Wildflower Dreams” exudes hope and cheerfulness. It is a musical representation of pursuing your goals with unyielding vigor and relishing the ride along the way. This music is going to be a fan favorite because of the catchy choruses and the lively composition.\n\nThe song “Unseen Stars” examines the idea that there are invisible stars that can help us find hope and light, even in the most dire circumstances. Its reflective lyrics and tender acoustic guitar accompaniment make for a powerful and reflective listening experience.\n\nOn “Bigger Houses,” Dan + Shay have developed an album that is not only a statement of their musical evolution, but also a moving investigation of love, resilience and the discovery of happiness. While it may not grab the headlines as the best country album of the year, “Bigger Houses” is a hidden gem that deserves to be unearthed by country tune enthusiasts. Dan + Shay’s commitment to their craft and personal journey shines brightly on this compilation of songs, making it a substantial addition to any country song playlist. In a world of older homes and louder voices, this album is a reminder that the deepest stories are often found in peaceful moments, waiting to be heard.\n\nThis musical journey is not just about older homes. They talk about greater goals, deeper emotions and finding life’s hidden gems, as this album continues to please fans. The duo’s lyrics, “What I have is still not enough,” serves as a reminder that true happiness is not dependent solely on financial wealth. Although “Bigger Houses” may not have the most catchy country song title, it is a hidden gem that will interest listeners in finding its emotional melodies and moving lyrics."
