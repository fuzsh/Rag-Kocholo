Most reviewers have taken a liking to the multitude of stylistic shifts in the album,[5][10][11][12] however one was not enthused with them because of the incomplete and unrefined nature to the music.[22] Another reviewer said that some listeners might not be able to understand the music throughout the varying stylistic shifts.[15] At AllMusic, David Jeffries rated the album four stars out of five, and according to him it is \"Right-sized at ten songs with no filler to speak of, Welcome to the New is another entry in the band's long list of triumphs.\"[10]\n\nAt USA Today, Brian Mansfield rated the album three stars out of four, remarking that \"Here, renewal and spiritual transformation actually sound fun.\"[6] Grace S.

Sarah Fine rated the album four-and-a-half stars out of five, saying that \"It's more like 12 steps and a giant leap\" forwards.[11] Jonathan Andre of Indie Vision Music rated the album a perfect five stars, proclaiming that \"With plenty of rock songs to please the alternative genre, Welcome to the New stretches musical boundaries to boldly assert its authority as one of this year’s standout albums.\"[12] Christian Music Review's Laura Chambers rated the album four point two out of five, noting how that \"As a themed album, Welcome To The New sticks to the same topic very well, exploring it at different angles.\"[15] At CM Addict, Julia Kitzing rated the album four-and-a-half stars out of five, writing that \"It’s catchy and fun, with a wonderful message of hope woven throughout.\"[21]\n\nJoshua Andre of Christian Music Zine rated the album four-and-a-half out of five stars, stating that the band \"have crafted a fine effort\" with Welcome to the New.[5] At Hallels, Timothy Yap gave a positive review, praising the song \"Dear Younger Me\", when he stated the album is worth it just because of that gem of a track.[14] In addition, Yap states that \"MercyMe puts the Christ back into Christianity\", which \"when Christ is central, this is where the party begins.\"[14] Louder Than the Music's Jono Davies rated the album four-and-a-half stars out of five, remarking that \"There is a true freshness to this album\".[9] At The Sound Opinion, Lindsay Williams rated the album a perfect five stars, noting that \"Welcome to the New is musically ambitious, lyrically sound and one of MercyMe's best records yet.\"[13] Tom Frigoli of Alpha Omega News graded the album a B+, calling the release \"fun, exciting, and fresh\".[24]\n\nAt Jesus Freak Hideout, Mark Rice rated the album three-and-a-half stars out of five, cautioning that \"Without a doubt, Welcome To The New is worth a try for any fan of Christian music, and while many will be put off by it, many more will love it.\"[22] Piet Levy of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel gave a mixed review on the album, criticizing them because they are \"hardly Christian rock's answer to the Black Keys\", and the release in that \"Lyrically, MercyMe doesn't offer anything much more complex than its uplifting 'God is great' messaging, but that approach doesn't provide much incentive for non-fans to seek out 'Welcome to the New.'\"[7]\n\nWelcome to the New and its lead single, \"Shake\", were nominated for Best Contemporary Christian Music Album and Best Contemporary Christian Music Performance/Song respectively at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards.\n\nCommercial performance\n\n[edit]\n\nFor the Billboard charting week of April 26, 2014, Welcome to the New was the No. 4 most sold album in the
