Last week, Integrity Music legacy artist, worship leader and singer-songwriter Paul Baloche released a deluxe version of his trailblazing album ‘A Greater Song’ to celebrate its 15th anniversary! Since then, we have been playing it non-stop, enjoying the classics and rediscovering some of Paul’s songs through his beautifully reimagined versions, all the while worshipping our God. “The songs on ‘A Greater Song’ were birthed in the midst of worship in my local church 15 years ago,” he says, before adding: “I remember it being a season of intense and consistent prayer in our community and I can hear it in the voices on the original recordings. I can still picture the faces of our congregation as we lifted up these songs as prayers to God from our fellowship. Surprisingly, many of these choruses are still being sung in churches around the world.” Though fifteen years have passed since the live recording of this album, its core message still rings fresh and true to our ears and hearts today; Paul Baloche has a way of capturing the powerful message of the Gospel in a relevant and relatable manner.
