        "text": "Aerosmith Cancel Farewell Tour, Officially Retire From Touring\n\nAerosmith has canceled their farewell tour and has officially announced they have retired from touring.\n\nThe band issued the following statement:\n\n“It was 1970 when a spark of inspiration became Aerosmith. Thanks to you, our Blue Army, that spark caught flame and has been burning for over five decades. Some of you have been with us since the beginning and all of you are the reason we made rock ‘n’ roll history.\n\nIt has been the honor of our lives to have our music become part of yours. In every club, on every massive tour and at moments grand and private you have given us a place in the soundtrack of your lives.\n\nWe’ve always wanted to blow your mind when performing. As you know, Steven’s voice is an instrument like no other. He has spent months tirelessly working on getting his voice to where it was before his injury. We’ve seen him struggling despite having the best medical team by his side. Sadly, it is clear, that a full recovery from his vocal injury is not possible. We have made a heartbreaking and difficult, but necessary, decision – as a band of brothers – to retire from the touring stage.\n\nWe are grateful beyond words for everyone who was pumped to get on the road with us one last time. Grateful to our expert crew, our incredible team and the thousands of talented people who’ve made our historic runs possible. A final thank you to you – the best fans on planet Earth. Play our music loud, now and always. Dream On. You’ve made our dreams come true.”\n\nA Brief Timeline of the Aerosmith Rescheduled Tour Dates\n\nIn September 2023, Aerosmith postponed a handful of dates on their farewell tour. At the time, it was revealed Tyler suffered vocal cord damage that led to “subsequent bleeding.” Doctors also instructed him to go on vocal rest and not sing for 30 days.\n\nWeeks later, Aerosmith postponed their entire farewell tour until 2024 due to issues related to Tyler’s vocal cord injury.\n\nThe band shared in a statement, “Unfortunately, Steven’s vocal injury is more serious than initially thought. His doctor has confirmed that in addition to the damage to his vocal cords, he fractured his larynx which requires ongoing care.”\n\nThe band noted, “He is receiving the best medical treatment available to ensure his recovery is swift, but given the nature of a fracture, he is being told patience is essential.”\n\nTyler added in his own personal statement, “I am heartbroken to not be out there with Aerosmith, my brothers and the incredible Black Crowes, rocking with the best fans in the world. I promise we will be back as soon as we can!”\n\nErica Banas is a news blogger who's been covering the rock/classic rock world since 2014.
