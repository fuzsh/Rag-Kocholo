        "text": "Casey Desmond is rendered on the cover of her new album the way she presents herself in performance: a neon vision of an electro-pop siren. Bright, out of this world, maybe just a little gauche — all perfect ingredients for the slinky dance pop the Boston-based singer-songwriter and artist has been tirelessly peddling for the past few years.\n\nAfter a taste of fame last year as a contestant on the first season of “The Voice,” there’s been no logical reason why Desmond and her music haven’t caught fire, especially given current tastes in electronic dance music.\n\n“Déjà Vu” tries to rectify that with songs that are slaves to the rhythm, as plastic as they are pretty. This album sounds expensive, which is to say that the beats are big and bouncy, the melodies perfectly molded for Top 40 radio. And then there’s Desmond’s voice, strong and assured of where it wants to lead the music.\n\nSeveral of these songs, some of which Desmond co-wrote with Robert Ellis Orrall, sound like they could be hits — if not for Desmond, then for another pop star. The title track has traces of Lady Gaga — “I wanna savor this déjà vu/ Relive the flavor, the taste of you” — right down to a spoken-word interlude. “Talking to God” is such a natural fit for Madonna, you could imagine it on Madge’s most recent album or even “Ray of Light.”\n\nESSENTIAL “Déjà Vu”"
