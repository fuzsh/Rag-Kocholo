        "text": "Introduction\n\nCharles Stewart Desmond served on the Court of Appeals for 26 full years-the second longest tenure of a Judge on the Court of Appeals. He was, at the time of his appointment, the second youngest man to ever be elected to the Court and was the first Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals to also hold the title of Chief Judge of the State of New York.1 He was a devout family man and the pride of Buffalo, New York. The prestigious Moot Court competition at the State University of New York at Buffalo School of Law bears his name to this day.\n\nJudge Desmond was born in a room above his father’s saloon near the Lake Erie docks in Buffalo on December 2, 1896; he was the son of Patrick Desmond and Katherine Jordan Desmond. His grandfather was a very strong-willed railroad man from County Court, Ireland.2 Judge Desmond attended Immaculate Conception grade school where he was selected to give the commencement speech in 1910. He graduated in 1913 from the Jesuit-run Canisius High School, where he developed a lifelong connection to Catholic principles and a flair for Latin.\n\nCharles Desmond obtained an A.B. degree in 1917 and an M.A. degree in 1918 from another Jesuit institution, Canisius College. At Canisius, Desmond received many academic honors, participated in several dramatic productions, was an editor and frequent contributor to the Canisius Monthly (a literary magazine), served as an officer for the Athletic Association in football and basketball, and was elected senior class president.3\n\nThe First World War briefly interrupted Desmond’s studies. He served as gunnery sergeant and a second lieutenant in the United States Marines Flying Force. However, he caught influenza during training and did not serve overseas before the Armistice. Upon his graduation from Canisius, he entered law school at the University of Buffalo where he received his LL.B. degree in 1920. Desmond was admitted to the New York Bar on October 16, 1920.4\n\nDesmond engaged in the general private practice of law in Buffalo from 1920 to 1939, first as an associate of, and then as a partner with, Thomas C. Burke. Not much is known of Desmond’s private practice, but he did practice considerable admiralty law.5 During this period he became active in Democratic Party politics. In 1928, at the age of 33, he married Helen Ryan in Buffalo. The couple had four children: Ryan, born 1929; Sheila, born 1931; Kathleen, born 1932; and Patricia, born 1938.\n\nIn the early 1930’s Desmond was mentioned as a possible United States Attorney for the Western District of New York, but President Roosevelt chose another for the post. In 1935, during the middle of the Great Depression, Governor Herbert Lehman appointed Desmond to the New York State Board of Social Welfare, an entity which had supervision over private asylums and charity institutions in the state. During this time, Desmond became increasingly involved in various welfare and civic organizations in western New York.6\n\nDesmond experienced an almost meteoric rise to the Court of Appeals. In January 1940, Governor Lehman appointed Desmond to the vacancy on the State Supreme Court created when Presiding Justice of the Appellate Division, Fourth Department, Charles Sears was appointed to the Court of Appeals. Desmond would need to run for office that November to secure the full 14-year term. His political sponsor, Paul E. Fitzpatrick, tried to persuade western New York Republicans to cross-endorse Desmond for the full elective term on the Supreme Court in the fall of 1940. When Fitzpatrick failed to secure the cross endorsement, he decided instead to put Desmond’s name on the ballot as the Democratic candidate for the Court of Appeals. Desmond secured the nomination and then defeated his opponent in the general election.\n\nJudge Desmond was so well admired and well respected that when he ran for reelection in 1954, he was cross-endorsed by all major political parties. He was elected as Chief Judge in November 1959 and took that seat on January 1, 1960, following the retirement of Chief Judge Albert Conway. Judge Desmond served as the 28th Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals until he reached the constitutional age limit of 70 and his term expired on December 31, 1966. During his more than a quarter of a century on the Court, he wrote more than 700 opinions and by his own estimation participated in over 12,000 appeals.\n\nWriting Accomplishments\n\nIn 1949, Judge Desmond published his first book, called Sharp Quillets of the Law (From Decisions of the New York Court of Appeals),7 a collection of 83 unusual and curious cases decided by the Court between 1847 and 1947. Designed for the lay person, the work gives a glimpse into the kinds of cases that reached the Court during its first 100 years and offers a brief view into the workings of the Court.\n\nIn 1959, Judge Desmond followed up Sharp Quillets with Through the Courtroom Window, which he designed in a similar format to his first book by collecting 32 short descriptions of cases that reached the Court during his tenure. Among the highlights of the book are Judge Desmond’s account of People v. Valletutti (297 NY 226 [1948]), a felony murder case where the Judge authored the majority opinion reversing the conviction; People v. Conroy (287 NY 201 [1941]), a capital murder prosecution where-following the Court of Appeals’ affirmance of the conviction -the defendant was executed; and People v. Wolfe (304 NY 556 [1952]), a fantastic murder prosecution where the defendant insisted on trying to represent himself and claimed he was God.\n\nThe gem of the book may be the vignette, entitled “The Crime that was Never Committed.”8 In very readable prose, Judge Desmond recounts the full story of People v. Trowbridge (305 NY 471 [1953]), which, many New York lawyers will remember from their law school days, is famous for the rule of evidence prohibiting bolstering. Desmond’s account of Trowbridge, and the robbery that never occurred, yields three remarkable insights. First, the case demonstrates how a seemingly technical rule of evidence, often criticized by the public as responsible for letting the guilty go free, can produce equitable results. Second, Trowbridge shows that juries are made up of human beings who do not always come to the right answer in a criminal case. Third, and perhaps most significantly, the case is revealing of the rules that assigned counsel worked under prior to Gideon v. Wainwright (372 US 335 [1963]). Judge Desmond observes that a key aspect of the case was the able representation by “a youthful but able and aggressive lawyer (John A. Murray of Troy)” who represented Trowbridge without compensation.9 At that time, only lawyers appointed by the court in capital cases were entitled to compensation for their services; lawyers appointed by the court to serve indigent defendants in noncapital cases worked for free in “the fine old traditional rule of the profession.”10\n\nApart from his two books, Judge Desmond was a prolific contributor to legal journals, covering almost every major subject. Judge Desmond’s writings frequently ventured beyond the realm of state law. For example in 1943, he spoke to the graduates of Canisius College warning against American isolationism:\n\nOur acceptance, after victory is ours, of our share of world responsibilities added to the sacrifices in the conflict itself, will give us the right to be heard as to the interpretation of the war aims we have announced…We shall then have the right to say that ‘freedom for all peoples’ was no mere slogan…Let us face the fact that colonial empires are things of the past, and then perhaps wars, too, will become things of the past.11\n\nJudge Desmond’s writings were frequently influenced by Catholic moral teachings on natural law and social justice. On the bench, natural law principles no doubt influenced his opinions for the Court in Packer Collegiate Inst. v. University of the State of New York (298 NY 184 [1948])-holding an Education Law statute, requiring registration of private nonsectarian schools under the Board of Regents, unconstitutional as an invalid delegation of legislative power-and People ex rel. Portnoy v. Strasser (303 NY 539 [1952])-overturning a lower court order that removed a child from her mother’s custody and firmly establishing that the custodial parent has sole control of the child’s upbringing.\n\nIn a 1943 speech, Judge Desmond observed: “Disabuse your minds of any idea that Catholic teaching as to moral law conflicts with American traditions, history or law system.”12 Judge Desmond rejected the criticisms directed at believers in natural law: “We need not be ashamed of being naive when we find ourselves in the company of Cicero and Sophocles, Blackstone and Chief Justice Marshall, as well as the greats minds of our own Church.”13 Judge Desmond continued: “Either we admit that there is a higher law, not of our making to which the majority is subject and the majority is bound, or we have the way wide open to totalitarianism.”14\n\nIn an address at a symposium held by the Guild of Catholic Lawyers of New York City in December 1953, Judge Desmond asserted: “from the Republic’s founding days till now, the decisions of our highest courts have repeated over and over that there is a higher or natural law, antedating all positive law and expressing fundamental rights which governments and constitutions do not grant and cannot take away, but must protect, and that the courts must strike down as unconstitutional legislative or administrative acts of government repugnant to natural justice.”15\n\nPrayer from his faith tradition also permeated his public speeches. Thus, on the retirement of Chief Judge Albert Conway in December 1959, Judge Desmond stated:\n\nand we pray for you (Chief Judge Conway) in the words of Cardinal Newman: ‘may He support us all day long till the shades lengthen and the evening comes, and the busy world is hushed and the fever of life is over and our work is done. Then in His mercy may He give us a safe lodging and a holy rest and peace at the last.’16\n\nWork as a Court of Appeals Judge\n\nJudge Desmond served 19 years as an associate judge under four Chief Judges. During this time, he refined a very forceful and lean writing style. As noted by former Presiding Justice of the Fourth Department Michael Dillon, Judge Desmond “was a master in the use of words, insisting always upon precision of language-and particularly so in the art of opinion writing. . . . He wrote exactly what he meant to say, sprinkled with just enough Latin to provide emphasis and reflect his liberal arts Jesuit training.”17\n\nJudge Desmond was difficult to classify politically. According to the New York Times, he was generally regarded as a leader of the liberal wing of the Court, but his opinions often defied easy characterization.18 Judge Desmond’s progressive side was illustrated most notably in criminal law and criminal procedure law, illustrated, for example, by his dissents in People v. Prior (294 NY 405 [1945]) and People v. Spano (4 NY2d 256 [1958], revd sub nom Spano v. New York, 360 US 315 [1959]) and by his majority opinion in People v. DiBiasi (7 NY2d 544 [1960]).19\n\nIn the area of First Amendment law, Judge Desmond could be regarded as a balancer. He was no absolutist and somewhat conservative, at least from a current perspective. In People v. Doubleday & Co. (297 NY 687 [1947], affd by an equally divided Court 335 US 848 [1948]), he joined a unanimous Court in upholding a conviction of a publisher for releasing a book “composed of six interrelated stories” that were allegedly “obscene and lewd.” In Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson (303 NY 242 [1951], revd 343 US 495 [1952]), Judge Desmond joined a majority of five Judges and concurred separately in upholding a determination of the Board of Regents which revoked a license to exhibit a motion picture on the ground that it was “sacrilegious.” The Judge’s concurring opinion specifically upheld the right of the government to censor motion pictures, and advocated a deferential standard of judicial review of the state regulators’ decision that the film was sacrilegious, a term he concluded was constitutionally no less vague and definite as the term “obscene.”\n\nThe Judge, however, was not a sure vote in favor of censorship. He wrote the opinion for the Court in Matter of Excelsior Pictures Corp. v. Regents of Univ. of the State of N.Y. (3 NY2d 237 [1957]) striking down a Board of Regents’ refusal to grant a license to a motion picture called “Garden of Eden” on the ground that it was “indecent.” The Judge held that the word “indecent” within the meaning of Education Law ‘ 122 means “obscene” and that the picture, which was a fictionalized description of a nudist group in a secluded private camp in Florida, was not obscene nor was it found to be obscene by the Board of Regents. Nevertheless, the very next year in Matter of Kingsley Intl. Pictures Corp. v. Regents of the Univ. of the State of N.Y. (4 NY2d 349 [1958]), he concurred with the majority in holding constitutional the Board of Regents’ decision to deny a license to the film “Lady Chatterley’s Lover” that had been based on the ground that the film was immoral because it “‘portray[ed] acts of sexual immorality…or lewdness’ and… ‘present[ed] such acts as desirable, acceptable or proper patterns of behavior.'”20\n\nJudge Desmond’s position on the relationship between the First Amendment and obscene or pornographic works can best be illustrated in his extrajudicial writings. The Judge noted in his characteristically direct style:\n\nMy thesis, so far as I have one, is that there is nothing in American law, constitutional, statutory or conventional, to prevent pre-censorship for obscenity, and that pre-censorship, applied reasonably and justly and without destruction of real literary values is not offensive to historic American tradition of freedom of publication.\n\n. . .\n\nWe agree with Thomas Jefferson that as to the general content of newspapers, interference is the worst of all evils, since ‘our liberty depends upon the freedom of the press, and that cannot be limited without being lost.’ But obscenity, real serious, not imagined or puritanically exaggerated, is today as in the past centuries, a public evil, a public nuisance, a public pollution.21\n\nIn the area of tort law, Judge Desmond could be viewed as a moderate. On the pro-defendant side, he dissented from the majority in Battalla v. State of New York (10 NY2d 237 [1961]), which gave a plaintiff a cause of action where she alleged that the defendant’s employee had failed to lock her securely into a ski-lift and, even though there was no physical impact, she suffered emotional damages. He also dissented in Klimas v. Trans Caribbean Airways (10 NY2d 209 [1961]), a case where the majority upheld an award of workers’ compensation benefits to an employee whose fatal heart seizure was allegedly brought on by workplace stress and anxiety. Finally, in Badigian v. Badigian (9 NY2d 472 [1961], overruled in part Gelbman v. Gelbman, 23 NY2d 434 [1969]), the Judge refused to abandon the rule that immunized a parent from negligence actions brought by the parent’s son or daughter.\n\nAs illustrated by other many tort cases, however, the Judge could be considered pro-plaintiff. The leading example is the Judge’s opinion in Woods v. Lancet (303 NY 349 [1951]), holding that an individual could recover damages for injuries she alleged the defendant negligently inflicted while she was still in her mother’s womb. In a classic common-law passage, Judge Desmond wrote:\n\n[Lack of precedent] . . . is not a very strong reason . . . in a case like this. Of course, rules of law on which men rely in their business dealings should not be changed in the middle of the game, but what has that to do with bringing justice to a tort-feasor who surely has no moral or other right to rely on a decision of the New York Court of Appeals? Negligence law is common law and the common law has been molded and changed and brought up-to-date in many another case.22\n\nIn Steitz v. City of Beacon (295 NY 51 [1945]), the plaintiff’s house was destroyed when, upon the outbreak of a fire, it proved impossible to douse the flames, because the City had negligently failed to maintain the valves and hydrants regulating the pressure. Relying on Moch Co. v. Rensselaer Water Co. (247 NY 160 [1928]), the majority affirmed the dismissal of the complaint. Judge Desmond dissented on the ground that the waiver of governmental immunity effectuated by Court of Claims Act ‘ 8 and the Court’s decision in Bernardine v. City of New York (294 NY 361 [1945]) should apply to the negligent conduct of the fire department. Judge Desmond continued on this theme later as Chief Judge in his lone dissent in Motyka v. City of Amsterdam (15 NY2d 134 [1965]) stating: “[t]he time has come to remove from our law all the remaining vestiges of governmental immunity. We should be done with exceptions and incongruities. . . . Cities should be held to the same standards of conduct as apply to private persons, since the risk of liability (and insurance against the risk) is incidental to municipal activities.”23\n\nMorever, Judge Desmond either wrote or was solidly in support of the majority of the Court in the development of the law of warranty, putting to bed any remnants of the ancient doctrine of privity in cases like Greenberg v. Lorenz (9 NY2d 195 [1961]), Randy Knitwear, Inc. v. American Cyanamid Co. (11 NY2d 5 [1962]) and Goldberg v. Kollsman Instrument Corp. (12 NY2d 432 [1963]).\n\nIn a decision that cannot be easily characterized as either liberal or conservative, Judge Desmond was instrumental in writing a landmark opinion for the Court in the conflicts of law field. Kilberg v. Northeast Airlines (9 NY2d 34 [1961]) is generally regarded as the central building block upon which all of New York’s modern conflicts of law jurisprudence is built because it is expressly built on an “interests analysis” instead of a more formalistic approach.\n\nInterestingly, during the years Judge Desmond served as an Associate Judge, he engaged in other outside activities besides his writing projects and teaching duties. Slightly after World War II, Judge Desmond advised the United States Atomic Energy Commission on legal affairs.24 In 1951, he was named chairman of a new Defense Production Administration Committee that was to scrutinize the effect of special tax concessions to industry on the negotiation of defense contracts.25\n\nCourt Years as Chief Judge\n\nAs Chief Judge, Desmond wielded a powerful presence in the Conference Room. Desmond, according to Judge Stanley Fuld, urged “his views upon his associates fervidly and persuasively, eager to have them prevail, but always willing to modify his positions when discussion engender[ed] doubt.”26 Judge John Van Voorhis said “when the conflicts in thought and experience that go into the fashioning of the law were over,” Chief Judge Desmond could “unfailingly eat and drink with his judicial colleagues as friends.”27 Judge Kenneth Keating called Chief Judge Desmond’s presence in the Conference Room “dynamic, but never domineering. [He kept] order among seven men of rather determined views whose arguments in the conference room were often more heated than those in the courtroom.”28\n\nDuring this period, the Judges dined most frequently at the Fort Orange Club, an exclusive men’s club, immediately to the west of the State Capitol. Chief Judge Desmond would enjoy a before-dinner highball, preferably scotch, and sometimes a post-dinner cigar. Dinner time was relaxed; the Judges talked about football, the weather, and other light subjects, but tried hard to keep the Court’s work out of the conversation.\n\nAs Chief, Judge Desmond’s interests gravitated toward judicial administration, sometimes taking controversial stands. For example, the Judge tried for many years to abolish jury trials in civil cases, a move he was confident would unclog court calendars.29 He supported a merger of all trial courts, calling the Court of Claims “a historic accident.”30 He also spoke of judicial reform when he left the Court in 1966, observing with the wisdom of personal experience:\n\n“the present caseload is far too heavy for this seven member court. Those who are expert at judicial statistics say that a court like ours should not be burdened with more than 25 to 35 cases per judge per year. Here, the average per judge is more than twice that-and ever growing.”31\n\nWithin the area of criminal law, Chief Judge Desmond remained keenly cognizant of defendants’ rights. In People v. Donovan (13 NY2d 148 [1963]), the Chief Judge joined the majority in holding that a written confession taken from a defendant in a police station after his lawyer had been refused access to him was inadmissible and a violation of the defendant’s state constitutional right to the effective assistance of counsel. Most notably, he authored People v. Huntley (15 NY2d 72 [1965]) which implemented Jackson v. Denno (378 US 368 [1964]) addressing the voluntariness of confessions and what sort of remedy should be available for those imprisoned based on convictions that had been predicated upon confessions put to a jury without any prior factual finding of voluntariness by a judge. Huntley was a major broadening of the availability of state post-conviction remedies in New York and gave Chief Judge Desmond strong grounds on which to rest his attacks on the widespread use of federal habeas corpus review to “second guess” state appellate court review of criminal convictions.32\n\nAlthough Judge Desmond never voted to declare New York’s death penalty unconstitutional, he did become satisfied as a policy matter that the death penalty should have been abolished. According to the Buffalo Evening News, Judge Desmond stated: “I question the state’s right to take human life. I doubt that it [the death penalty] acted as a deterrent. And only a relatively few persons sentenced to death paid the supreme penalty.”33\n\nPost Court Years\n\nJudge Desmond’s retirement from the Court at age 70 on December 31, 1966 did not mark the end of his public life. In 1967, he was the only delegate to the State Constitutional Convention elected with a Democratic and Republican endorsement. At the Convention, he led an unsuccessful effort to add an anti-bugging amendment to New York’s Bill of Rights. “I predict that this convention, which holds in horror the secret police, will continue a practice that is characteristic of totalitarianism everywhere. . . . Wiretapping is an excuse for lazy police work,” he said.34 Judge Desmond called wiretapping “a dirty business, revolting business, abhorrent business. This practice is destructive of one of the basic rights for which our forefathers died.”35\n\nJudge Desmond also continued to teach at Cornell Law School, a position he first accepted in 1957. When the Court was not in session, the Judge would travel to Ithaca one day a week and teach a course on appellate advocacy.36 After retirement, he also served as a lecturer in appellate practice at the State University of New York at Buffalo School of Law and continued to teach at a summer seminar at New York University for appellate judges from across the country.\n\nJudge Desmond also served as Chairman of the Canisius College Board of Trustees (he was the first layman so chosen), as a member of the Board of Editors of the New York Law Journal, as co-campaign chairman for Arthur Goldberg-the former Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States-in his run for Governor in 1970, and as a frequent arbitrator in labor disputes. According to the Buffalo News, Judge Desmond “gave [former New York State Governor Mario] Cuomo a strong and politically important endorsement in the primary contest for the Democratic nomination for Governor in 1982 when Cuomo upset New York City Mayor Edward I. Koch, the endorsed candidate.”37\n\nTributes and Honors\n\nObviously, one would expect many tributes for any Judge who sat on the state’s highest court for as long as Judge Desmond, but the sheer amount and depth of the praise for the man is overwhelming. According to one commentator, “[f]ew appellate judges enjoy more genuine popularity and more affectionate esteem than the friendly, even tempered, unassuming and plain spoken Chief Judge of the State of New York.”38 At Chief Judge Desmond’s retirement, Judge Stanley Fuld, who would soon be installed as Chief Judge, observed in part:\n\nChief, you came to the Court as a young man some 26 years ago and you step down from the bench today still a young in heart, vision and mind, notwithstanding that along the way you have acquired in years the Biblical three score and ten. You have served on the Court with e?clat and distinction, longer than any of our predecessors, and yet you still retain the priceless attributes of talented youth-a keen intellect, tireless energy and infectious enthusiasm. To this Court and our consultations you have brought not only dedication and skill but also rare wisdom and fresh insights, the products of your firmly held and oft expressed belief that the dictates of common sense are compatible with the principles of the common law39\n\nThe praise from his colleagues on the bench was unanimous. Judge Adrian Burke keenly described the Judge’s strength of character, observing that in Judge Desmond’s\n\nlegal endeavors there is no loss of individuality-no enlistment in the mass movements of the particular moment. He is neither vague nor casual, and his work will always be a living reflection of what he thinks and what he cherishes. Untouched by the success he has achieved, through the years he has remained his unique self, exploring ways to express his attitudes toward life and the world around him in his own fashion.40\n\nFormer Presiding Justice of the Appellate Division Michael Dillon said:\n\nThis remarkable, unique man of four score and ten years never grew old, even as his body gave way to the years. He was ever young and up to date, whether the subject be law, politics or other current events. He lived not in the past, except to apply its experience to the present and the future. He spoke often and reverently about his parents and the politics he learned from his father. He exuded paternal love when he spoke of his children and he reveled in the accomplishments of his grandchildren.41\n\nUnited States Supreme Court Justice William Brennan described the qualities possessed by Judge Desmond in this way: “massive common sense, downright forcefulness, and obvious lack of subtlety and an abiding instinct for fair play.”42 Governor Mario Cuomo, who knew the judge well from his days as a law clerk to Judge Adrian Burke, praised Judge Desmond in a testimonial held in April 1986, calling the Judge “a man of extraordinary intelligence, rock-solid judgment and unbending convictions.”43 He characterized the witty Judge Desmond as blessed with “a quick and incisive mind and a pleasant sense of humor . . . [He was] a man with a love of people and integrity of person and purpose.”44\n\nJudge Desmond was the recipient of 13 honorary degrees from colleges and universities across the country.45 The Judge received a citation for distinguished service to the legal profession from the University of Buffalo in 1954. He was the winner of the National Conference of Christians and Jews “Brotherhood Award” in 1955 and recipient of the New York State Bar Association’s prestigious Gold Medal Award in 1967.\n\nJudge Desmond died on February 9, 1987 in Mercy Hospital after a brief illness. Just the Wednesday before his death, Judge Desmond finished teaching a course at the State University of New York at Buffalo School of Law. Memorial exercises were held at the Court of Appeals on February 10, 1987. Chief Judge Wachtler expressed the deepest sympathy of the Court to his family as it remembered him in thoughts and prayers. Judge Desmond is buried in the Immaculate Conception section of the Eden Evergreen Cemetery in Eden, New York.\n\nProgeny\n\nJudge Desmond was survived by three daughters and 12 grandchildren. Daughters: Sheila Landon (children Peter Cook Landon, Timothy Landon, Patrick Desmond Landon [deceased], Christopher Landon [deceased]); Kathleen Hughes (children Bridget Trimboli, Maura Bowman and Desmond Hughes); Patricia Williams (children: Amelia Williams, Gregory Williams, Edward Williams). Judge Desmond’s only son, Charles Ryan Desmond (known as Ryan), died tragically in a car accident in 1985. He was survived by four children: Charles S. Desmond II, Julie Schechter, Joseph Desmond and Mollie Scanlon.\n\nThis biography appears in The Judges of the New York Court of Appeals: A Biographical History, ed. Hon. Albert M.
