        "text": "Casey Desmond landed a place on Adam Levine's The Voice team with a blind audition performance of 'Born This Way' by Lady GaGa. However, the red-haired singer narrowly missed a place on the live shows following her battle round duet with Jeff Jenkins, who was an early favorite after all four coaches vied to work with him during the audition rounds. The pair performed Elton John's classic track 'Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me' and although the coaches told Casey she gave a great performance, Adam ultimately decided to award the win to Jeff.\n\nCasey recently spoke to reporters about battling Jeff, her thoughts on Adam's decision, and her plans for the future:\n\nHow did you feel going up against Jeff who had all four coaches turn around for him? Did you feel like you didn't stand a chance or were you prepared to live up to him?\n\n\"I felt like I was prepared to live up to him because I feel like we are equal in talent, even though the blind auditions didn't kind of prove that as far as the coaches were concerned. I think he's a really talented person but I feel like I'm talented as well, so it felt like it was just luck of what happened. I felt like it was just the style that Adam wanted or the style that the coaches desired more over another because I felt like our vocals were equally as strong. It's just really a matter of style. He did an amazing job so I'm really proud of him because yes, he's awesome.\"\n\nAdam seemed to struggle with his decision. What was going through your mind?\n\n\"It felt fabulous! It felt great that he struggled, no offense, Adam! Hopefully he lost some sleep! No, I'm just kidding, totally just kidding! I mean it felt good because it made me feel like me and Jeff got to step up to the plate and really do the best we could, not that I thought he was going to do bad or that I thought I was going to do bad or whatever, but it made me feel like we had done our job by giving them a solid performance. I'm really sad that he didn't choose me but at the same time it made me feel good that he didn't just go, 'See you Casey'.\"\n\nHow did you find working with a partner on stage?\n\n\"Me and Jeff got along really well as friends and I can tell that we are going to be friends for a while; we just worked. We got to all work with some choreographers really briefly to kind of run through some ideas, but nobody had to do exactly what they said, it was just ideas for us. We kind of changed it around ourselves and we actually worked on the choreography together. I feel like half of it went out the window once we got on stage because we were just feeling it so much, but it still worked because we had really good chemistry. We had just a really good connection as friends and we had practised a ton in all different kinds of ways, like with the piano and dancing around, so I feel like it came naturally because of the connection between us as people.\"\n\nWhat are your plans for your career now?\n\n\"I'm trying to pitch songs to artists and I'm writing a lot with other people, including Rob Ellis Orrall in Nashville. He's such an amazing person. We've been working on songs for me as a performer but we're also writing songs in other genres that we'll try to pitch to other artists. It would be nice to make some money and be able to sell music and hear other peoples' interpretations of the songs, but I want to make it as a pop singer as well. It would be awesome to work with someone like Red One or Dr Luke. I'd give everything. But I also don't want to lose the part of me as an artist that is production. I do a lot of my own production and the instrumentations on my albums and stuff. I also think it would be fun to write and produce songs for some of the artists on The Voice.\"\n\nThe Voice continues Tuesday at 9/8c on NBC\n\nWatch a video of Casey Desmond and Jeff Jenkins perform 'Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me':"
