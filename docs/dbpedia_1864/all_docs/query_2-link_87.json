        "text": "In collaboration with Kate B. Reynolds Charitable Trust, Marguerite Casey Foundation, Winston-Salem Foundation, and Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation, Bookmarks will launch the 2024 Book with Purpose Program with an event featuring Pulitzer Prize winning author Matthew Desmond. Attendees will receive a copy of his latest book Poverty, By America courtesy of Marguerite Casey Foundation.\n\nThe event will focus on discussing the systemic issues facing our communities and how they can be addressed. Desmond will be in conversation with Dr. Carmen Rojas, President and CEO of Marguerite Casey Foundation, about his latest book, Poverty, by America.\n\nThis is a free event with registration required. Attendees will also receive a copy of this year's Book with Purpose: One Person, No Vote: How Voter Suppression Is Destroying Our Democracy by Carol Anderson courtesy of Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation.\n\nClick here to register on Eventbrite or scroll below.\n\nTo ask questions about accessibility or request accommodations, please contact Bookmarks at info@bookmarksnc.org or (336) 747-1471 x1001. At least two weeks' notice will allow us to provide the best experience possible for you and your guests.\n\nAbout Bookmarks' Book with Purpose Program\n\nBook with Purpose is a program that engages and unites the Winston-Salem community in book discussions for all ages centered around one book or central topic. In 2024, Book with Purpose will be centered on the history of voting rights and aims to provide programming throughout the summer that will include talks, voter registration drives, and explorations about the history of voting rights through a variety of perspectives and mediums for community members of all ages. Bookmarks' program goal is to donate 5000+ copies of One Person, No Vote: How Voter Suppression Is Destroying Our Democracy by Carol Anderson to the community, with every high school senior having the opportunity to receive a young adult version of the book.\n\nAbout Matthew Desmond\n\nMatthew Desmond is the Maurice P. During Professor of Sociology at Princeton University and the founding director of the Eviction Lab. His last book, Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City, won the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Critics Circle Award, and the PEN/John Kenneth Galbraith Award, among others. The recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship, Desmond is also a contributing writer for The New York Times Magazine.\n\nAbout Poverty, by America\n\nThe United States, the richest country on earth, has more poverty than any other advanced democracy. Why? Why does this land of plenty allow one in every eight of its children to go without basic necessities, permit scores of its citizens to live and die on the streets, and authorize its corporations to pay poverty wages?\n\nIn this landmark book, acclaimed sociologist Matthew Desmond draws on history, research, and original reporting to show how affluent Americans knowingly and unknowingly keep poor people poor. Those of us who are financially secure exploit the poor, driving down their wages while forcing them to overpay for housing and access to cash and credit. We prioritize the subsidization of our wealth over the alleviation of poverty, designing a welfare state that gives the most to those who need the least. And we stockpile opportunity in exclusive communities, creating zones of concentrated riches alongside those of concentrated despair. Some lives are made small so that others may grow.\n\nElegantly written and fiercely argued, this compassionate book gives us new ways of thinking about a morally urgent problem. It also helps us imagine solutions. Desmond builds a startlingly original and ambitious case for ending poverty. He calls on us all to become poverty abolitionists, engaged in a politics of collective belonging to usher in a new age of shared prosperity and, at last, true freedom.\n\nPlease Note: Bookmarks cannot be held responsible for changes to an author's schedule and cannot guarantee that books will be signed by the author, either before or after an event.\n\nBy registering and attending this event, you agree to have your email address added to our newsletter distribution list.
