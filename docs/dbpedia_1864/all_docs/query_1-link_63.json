Billy Joel’s ex Christie Brinkley is Boston-bound in a touring production of “Chicago,” coming to the Wang Theatre Nov. 1-4. Her costar will be John O’Hurley, the Maine native best known for his role as John Peterman on “Seinfeld.” … And a shout-out to Fairy Dog Parents founder Marlo Manning, who was featured this week as one of CNN’s 25 “Heroes of 2012” for her work preventing dogs from ending up in shelters."
