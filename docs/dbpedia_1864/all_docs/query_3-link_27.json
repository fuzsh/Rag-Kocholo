        "text": "3.1. Flow effect on biofilm deformation and detachment\n\nIn this study, the time was very short during the flow tests, therefore, bacterial growth and EPS production were negligible. Deformation and detachment of the biofilm with 46% EPS at four inlet flow velocities are shown in Figures and , which are representations of the biofilm at 14 and 40 ms time points, respectively. At the lowest inlet flow velocity of 0.1 m/s, the biofilm elongated along with the flow direction and detachment occurred at the rear part of the biofilm (Figure ). Because of the gradient fluid shear force along the z direction and the patchy structure of the biofilm, the top of the biofilm deformed much more than its bottom. Biofilm deformation was dominant during exposure to this lowest level fluid shear force and only erosion occurred. No further erosion or detachment were observed between 14 and 40 ms (Figure ).\n\nWhen the inlet flow velocity was increased to 0.2 m/s, detachment at the rear part of the biofilm occurred as early as 3 ms (Figure S3). Compared to the lowest inlet fluid velocity (i.e., 0.1 m/s), detachment frequency increased sharply, both biofilm erosion and sloughing took place (Figure ). As expected, the comparison of Figure illustrates the higher flow velocity led to an increase in detached biofilm volume at the same duration. However, the biofilm was not removed at the end of simulation when the inlet flow velocity is 0.2 m/s (Figure ).\n\nHigh‐frequent biofilm detachment events could also be captured by further increasing the inlet flow velocity to 0.3 m/s. At this higher flow, biofilm sloughing was the predominant behavior during the detachment process. A small fraction of biofilm still adhered to the surface at 14 ms (Figure ). The remainder biofilm, which in continuous exposure to the fluid shear force, experienced more biofilm cluster detachment and only a layer of biofilm was left at 25 ms (Figure S4A). Interestingly, this remaining biofilm layer started rolling along the rough wall under the steady fluid shear force after then (Figure S4B‐D). Finally, biofilm moved out of the original location (the initial surface occupied by the pregrown biofilm) by this rolling motion at around 40 ms (Figure ). This phenomenon was firstly observed by Rupp et al. in their experiments, in which Staphylococcus aureus (a common biofilm forming pathogen associated with medical implants) microcolonies moved downstream by rolling in a flow cell (Rupp et al., 2005).\n\nAt the highest inlet fluid velocity, 0.4 m/s, biofilm clusters with different sizes detached rapidly due to the high fluid shear force. Figure displays the morphology of the biofilm after being subjected to the shear force for 14 ms, only a thin layer of biofilm remained adhered to the surface. Furthermore, the biofilm rolling motion was also captured at this flow speed. The biofilm rolled along the surface for several microseconds then lifted from the surface by the fluid (Figure S5A‐D). Eventually, the biofilm was washed away along the direction of the fluid flow (Figure ).\n\n3.2. EPS effect on biofilm deformation and detachment\n\nTo study how the EPS amount affected the deformation and detachment of biofilms, we examined a single fluid flow condition, 0.3 m/s sustained for a duration of 40 ms. For biofilms with a low amount of EPS (20% EPS), the biofilm clusters could easily detach from the biofilm matrix (erosion‐dominated) at high frequency, accompanied by the escape of single bacterial cells (Figure S6). This may be due to the limited EPS availability to immobilize the cells in biofilm (Flemming & Wingender, 2010).\n\nThe detachment frequency of biofilm decreased with the increase in EPS amount. Figure shows the biofilms after being subjected to the fluid flow for 14 ms. The volume of detached biofilm decreased as the EPS amount increased. For the biofilm with low EPS amount (20%, 32%, and 40% EPS), most biofilm were detached but a thin layer remained adhered to the surface wall at the end of 40 ms (Figure ). However, when the EPS volume ratio was increased to 46%, the biofilm was removed by a rolling motion. The results suggest that the rolling motion depends on the amount of EPS. When the EPS volume ratio further increased to 51%, about half of the initial biofilm remained on the surface at 40 ms (Figure ). It is evident that the same flow caused less detachments for biofilm with higher EPS amount, which further suggests that the biofilm with greater amounts of EPS was stiffer and resisted well against fluid flows.\n\nThe local detachment, such as erosion and sloughing, could be significantly captured within the time of 14 ms. However, biofilm removal occurred after this period when the inlet fluid velocity was greater than 0.2 m/s. Therefore, the detachment rate coefficient, which is defined as the ratio of the volume of detached biofilm cluster to the total volume of biofilm per millisecond, was calculated during the initial detachment period (14 ms) and adopted to describe the biofilms detachment behavior under the range of hydrodynamic conditions. Each simulation was run for three replicates and the average results were calculated. As displayed in Figure , the detachment rate coefficient increased with the inlet fluid velocity which agrees with previously reported experimental observations (Stoodley et al., 2002). There was no significant detachment until inlet flow velocity increased to 0.2 m/s, the coefficient increased sharply before the inlet flow velocity reached 0.3 m/s and then slowed down when the inlet fluid velocity was further increased. In keeping with the visual results (Figure ), a negative correlation was found between the EPS amount and detachment rate coefficient when the inlet fluid velocity was kept constant (Figure ). The detachment rate coefficient for the biofilm with 20% EPS was approximately twice that for the biofilm with 51% EPS. The results suggest that the resistance of the biofilm to the external fluid is largely attributable to the EPS amount. EPS is responsible for the mechanical stability of the biofilm due to its cohesive properties, therefore, the biofilms with a greater density of EPS components are predicted to be more stable when exposed to the fluid flow.\n\n3.3. Biofilm viscoelastic response during deformation‐recovery test\n\nDeformation of the biofilm with 46% EPS was monitored for 3 ms as the fluid velocity was incrementally increased from 0 m/s at a constant acceleration. Then the fluid flow was stopped, the biofilm was allowed to relax for 17 ms. The stress–strain curve was obtained from the loading and unloading cycle. Figure shows the deformation and recovery properties of the biofilm (46% EPS). In this case, the fluid velocity was accelerated at 20 m/s2 and reached the maximum value (0.06 m/s) at 3 ms. The maximal deformation angle was captured at the same time (Figure ), approximately 25.3 degree (0.44 rads). After the fluid flow was stopped, the biofilm started to recovery. As seen in Figure , the biofilm had not returned to the original shape after the full relaxation time, about six times of the duration of flow induced biofilm deformation. The results were not surprising for our simulation, as the interactions between the biofilm particles were modeled as spring‐dashpot based viscoelastic models. It matches observations of real world biofilms, as this kind of residual strain was also be observed in Klapper et al. (2002), and such a residual deformation is due to the viscous nature of biofilm (Jafari et al., 2018).\n\nTo understand the viscoelastic deformation of biofilms at different loading rates and stresses, additional simulations were performed by accelerating the fluid at 30 and 40 m/s2 for 3 ms, with the corresponding peak fluid velocities of 0.09 and 0.12 m/s, respectively. Figure shows the fluid‐induced shear stress on biofilms overtime. It is evident that the higher flow acceleration resulted in higher shear stress imposed on biofilms (Figure ). This can lead to larger deformation (or shear strain) and deformation rate of biofilms (or strain rate), as seen in Figure .\n\nAfter the flow was removed at 3 ms, the fluid induced stress in the biofilm decreased rapidly (3–4 ms, Figure ), and some of the deformation (8%–10%) was immediately recovered attributable to a time‐independent elastic response. Afterward (4–20 ms, Figure ), the stress decay slowed down dramatically and almost reached a plateau at the end of the recovery. A residual deformation (or strain) during biofilm relaxation was captured in each deformation – recovery test and increased with the maximum fluid velocity. Such a strain rate‐dependent recovery was due to the nature of viscoelastic models adopted within the biofilms and is a common characteristic for viscoelastic materials (Capurro & Barberis, 2014; Chen et al., 2011).\n\nFigure shows the corresponding stress–strain curve of biofilms during biofilm deformation (0–3 ms) and recovery process (3–20 ms). At the lowest shear stress and shear rate, the stress could recover to zero within the allotted 17 ms of relaxation time while a full recovery could not be achieved for higher shear stresses with higher strain rates. The hysteresis loop in the curve represents the dissipation of energy during the biofilm deformation process. The area of hysteresis loop increased with the maximum fluid velocity, which suggested more energy dissipation. The calculated apparent shear moduli of biofilms (Equation 1) determined at small deformation (strain < 0.1), were 10.75 ± 1.28, 12.41 ± 1.24, and 15.21 ± 1.94 Pa at given fluid velocities (0.06, 0.09, and 0.12 m/s), respectively. The apparent shear modulus is affected by the deformation rate (or strain rate) due to the nature of viscoelastic effect. It is expected that the lower deformation rate leads to a smaller apparent shear modulus, which is also seen in this study. If we take into account different deformation rates of biofilms at different fluid velocities, it yields consistent equilibrium shear modulus and viscosity which are in the range of 3.8–4.8 Pa and 6.9–8.7 mPa*s, when using the Prony series viscoelastic model for curve fitting at different deformation rates (Chen & Lu, 2012).\n\nTo study the EPS effect on biofilm mechanics, we also focused on biofilms containing higher EPS amounts (40%, 46%, and 51%) subjected to the ramping fluid velocity at a constant acceleration of 40 m/s2. Biofilms with lowers EPS amount were not considered here since they could easily detach, thus the stress–strain curve would not be captured during deformation.\n\nFigure show the fluid induced stress and strain changes overtime. For biofilms with 40% and 46% EPS, the fluid induced stresses on the biofilm were similar, but the peak shear stress on the 51% EPS biofilm (Figure ) was higher. The different stress profiles could be attributed to the different height profiles of the biofilms. Since the fluid flow was applied along the top wall in the simulation domain, the velocity varied with the height of simulation box (Figure S7). Therefore, it is important to note that although the inlet fluid condition was set as the same, the biofilms would be subjected to different fluid shear force if their height varied due to growth.\n\nThe deformation of the biofilm with 40% EPS was greater compared to biofilm with 46% EPS, and both experienced similar shear stresses. This suggests that higher EPS resulted in the better resistance to the external fluid shear force. However, the shear strain of the 51% EPS biofilm was lowest although the maximum stress was almost 16% higher than for its counterpart biofilms. Taken together, the results suggest that biofilms with higher EPS might be stiffer, which agrees with what was found in Gloag et al. (2020). As seen in Figure , the stress–strain curve was almost linear at very small strains (<0.1), which was also found in our experimental measurements for flow induced biofilm deformation of Bacillus subtilis (Figure S8). When ignoring the deformation rate (or strain rate) effect, the apparent shear modulus at given loading conditions was 12.82 ± 2.03, 15.21 ± 1.94, and 17.18 ± 3.3 Pa for biofilms with 40% EPS, 46% EPS, and 51% EPS, respectively. When the deformation rates were accounted for, it yields the equilibrium shear modulus of 3.5 ± 0.7 Pa, 5.7 ± 1.7 Pa, and 5.6 ± 0.4 Pa for those three biofilms when using the Prony series viscoelastic model for curve fitting at different deformation rates (Chen & Lu, 2012). These are consistent with several biofilms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Stoodley et al., 1999) and Staphylococcus aureus (Rupp et al., 2005). The reported corresponding viscosity for those three biofilms is 8.4 ± 4.5, 6.6 ± 1.6, 8.3 ± 3.2 mPa*s, respectively. There is no evidence for correlation between the equilibrium shear modulus and viscosity of biofilms, as found in other recent studies (Houari et al., 2008; Klapper et al., 2002; Rupp et al., 2005; Safari et al., 2015; Stoodley et al., 1999; Vinogradov et al., 2004; Wloka et al., 2004). The predicted viscosity was the resultant of the mechanical interactions for bacteria–bacteria, bacteria–EPS and EPS–EPS.\n\nIn general, all the simulated biofilms exhibited some strain stiffening effect followed by strain softening at larger strains, which is due to the viscoelastic properties and the change in the microstructure of biofilms during the deformation (Figure ). This is consistent with experimental measurements of biofilms at a wide range of strains (Jana et al., 2020). ANOVA test was used for statistical analysis (α = 0.05). The result (p < 0.05) suggests that the change of shear modulus with EPS amount has a statistically significant difference.\n\nAfter the fluid was stopped, the stress on the biofilms decayed exponentially and the deformation recovered slowly which is a common feature for viscoelastic materials (Chen & Lu, 2012). The overall biofilm deformation recovery was 16%, 20%, and 22% for biofilms with 40%, 46%, and 51% EPS within the simulation period, respectively. The results suggest that the abundant presence of EPS in the deformed biofilms makes a significant contribution to their mechanical recovery, as the bacterial cells are much more loosely associated with other bacterial cells than EPS agents. Similar results were also verified in the experimental work, which released that the EPS is required to induce bacterial rearrangement during stress relaxation (Peterson et al., 2014)."
