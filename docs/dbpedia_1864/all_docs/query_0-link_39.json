        "text": "It was a simple night at our apartment watching \"It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia\" - nothing out of the usual. I was convinced Casey didn't have the ring yet after the jeweler accidentally called me that day to let me know it was ready for pick up... He still went to retrieve it, but said it was a mistake and convinced me it wasn't finished yet. Little did I know later that evening I would turn around to be surprised with Casey down on one knee and a ring in his hand! To make it even better... we later found out we got engaged on Danny DeVito's birthday. We can't wait to celebrate this next chapter of our lives with our favorite people."
