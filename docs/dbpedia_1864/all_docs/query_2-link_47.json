It is also a nickname; in the case of girls, it can be used as a derivative nickname for the name Cassandra or, for either sex, the initials K.C.. It is in use for girls or boys in both the United States, the United Kingdom and other English-speaking countries.\n\nIt has ranked among the 1,000 most used names for American boys between 1900 and 1919 and again from 1942 to 2022. It was the 336th most popular name for boys born in the United States in 2022. It ranked among the 1,000 most popular names for girls in the United States between 1967 and 2019 and again in 2022. It ranked 946th for newborn American girls in 2022. The name was among the top 200 names for both sexes in the 1990s.[1]\n\nKayce, a spelling variant, ranked 587th for American newborn boys on the U.S. popularity chart in 2022. The increase in usage of the name was inspired by the popularity of the television series Yellowstone that is set in modern-day Montana and of its spinoffs, 1883 and 1923, about ancestors of the family. The name might evoke the American frontier for some new parents.[2] Place name Kaycee, Wyoming uses another spelling variation.\n\nSome other spelling variants in use for both sexes include Cacey, Caci, Caicey, Casi, Cayce, Ceysee, Kacey, Kacee, Kejsi, KC, Kaci, Kasi, Kacy, Kacie, Kaisey, Kasey, Kasie, Kaycey, Kaycie, Kayci, Kaycie, Kaysee, Kaysey, Kaysi, Kaysie, and Keize.\n\nPeople with the
