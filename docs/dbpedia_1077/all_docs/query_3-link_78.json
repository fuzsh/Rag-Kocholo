THE REGISTER REGISTER STAFF WRITER Clinton to last year's national championship in women's softball. Jennings went to Eau Claire, to deliver diplomas to team members unable to attend commencement because of the tournament. Behind Jennings' desk sits a white construction helmet. It's symbolic of the most visible changes on campus during his tenure .\n\nIn the past decade, the college has renovated Carver Science Hall, Wallace Hall and the Amy Robertson Music Center. But it might be his 1992 decision to change the athletic teams' name that more college alumni and outsiders will remember him for. Jennings had studied how other schools handled the issue of Indianrelated team names, and he decided that appointing a committee would do nothing to bridge the two opposing viewpoints. So, after checking with some key trustees, he simply announced the change. The old names could be considered racist and sexist, he argued, and they should be changed voluntarily before someone else forced the issue .\n\n\"It's still a lightning rod for some people who think I caved in to political correctness,\" Jennings said. \"I've got alumni who won't talk to But Walt and other observers say other decisions he made as president IOWA DEATHS ARNOLDS PARK Thomas Leslie Beedle, 86.

Under his leadership, Simpson increased its presence in the Des Moines area .\n\nJennings said he sometimes spends every day of the week there visiting alumni or business leaders. How important are Des Moines and its suburbs? A third of Simpson's full-time students come from just up U.S. Highway 65-69. Almost all the 600 students enrolled in the school's division of Adult Learning classes in West Des Moines are from there, too. Jennings said the Des Moines area represents a continuing challenge for his successor .\n\nThe growing competition in Des Moines from other private colleges and the state universities is one of the key emerging issues for the college. So are keeping private college affordable and equipping classrooms with the most technology, he said. up There also is talk of expanding the college's curriculum to include a master's degree program. And Simpson must decide how much it can grow without losing its small-college appeal. But those will be someone else's concerns .\n\nJennings' last day at Simpson is to be July 10. \"It's been a very good 11 years to be here,\" he said. \"I just hope my next 11 are like BLUFTON Paul W.
