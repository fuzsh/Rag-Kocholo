Primaries were held on June 2.[1]\n\nMost experts and pollsters considered this race and the concurrent presidential race as a tossup due to incumbent president Donald Trump's low approval ratings and Ernst's own popularity dropping in polls, partly due to a viral moment in a debate where she did not know the price of corn.[2] Despite this, Ernst was reelected by a larger-than-expected 6.6 points, while Trump simultaneously won the state with a similarly unexpected margin of victory. Ernst carried an overwhelming majority of the state's counties including many rural ones, while Greenfield carried only eight counties: Polk, Linn, Scott, Johnson, Black Hawk, Story, Cerro Gordo and Jefferson.[3]\n\nRepublican primary\n\n[edit]\n\nNominee\n\n[edit]\n\nJoni Ernst, incumbent U.S. senator[4][5][6]\n\nWithdrawn\n\n[edit]\n\nPaul Rieck[7][8]\n\nEndorsements\n\n[edit]\n\nJoni Ernst\n\nResult\n\n[edit]\n\nRepublican primary results[10] Party Candidate Votes % Total votes 229,721 100.00%\n\nDemocratic primary\n\n[edit]\n\nOn June 2, 2020, Theresa Greenfield won the Democratic primary with 47.71% of the vote, defeating three other major candidates, including Michael Franken, a retired U.S. Navy admiral and former aide to U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy.[11][12][13][14][15]\n\nNominee\n\n[edit]\n\nTheresa Greenfield, businesswoman, candidate for Iowa's 3rd congressional district in 2018[16]\n\nEliminated in primary\n\n[edit]\n\nMichael Franken, retired U.S. Navy admiral and former aide to U.S. Senator Ted Kennedy[17]\n\nKimberly Graham, child welfare attorney[18][19]\n\nEddie Mauro, businessman, teacher, candidate for Iowa's 3rd congressional district in 2018[20]\n\nWithdrawn\n\n[edit]\n\nCal Woods, journalist and U.S. Navy veteran[21][22][23] (endorsed Michael T.

likely to decide control of the Senate after the 2020 election.[58][59] Polls conducted after the primary showed a close contest between Greenfield and Ernst, with neither candidate leading by more than 4 points.[60][61][62][63]\n\nThrough June 2020, Greenfield had raised $11.5 million, compared to $14.6 million for Ernst but by September, Greenfield had pulled ahead, raising $40.0 million compared to $21.6 million for Ernst.[64][65][66] The race was expected to be the most expensive in the state's history,[67] and the second most expensive Senate race in the United States, after the 2020 United States Senate election in North Carolina, where Cal Cunningham challenged Thom Tillis.[68]\n\nDebate\n\n[edit]\n\nHost Date & time Link(s) Participants Joni Ernst (R) Theresa Greenfield
