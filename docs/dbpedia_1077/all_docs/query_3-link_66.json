        "text": "A few years ago, I had the occasion to write a column about children and adults with special needs. I made the case that retired Sen. Tom Harkin’s leadership in sponsoring the American with Disabilities Act was one of the most significant and bipartisan pieces of legislation in the last 50 years.\n\nAs a boy growing up in Nokomis, Illinois, my best friend was Gene Schneider. Gene had cerebral palsy and spent his entire life in a wheelchair. After high school, Gene was excited about heading off to Southern Illinois University. His adoptive parents had secured the services of a 24-hour attendant to live with Gene and take care of his needs. The day before he was to move to Carbondale, his aide backed out. Gene never made it to college. Government help? Non-existent. That bothered me over 50 years ago and bothers me to this day. That’s not right.\n\nYears later, after we moved to Sioux City, Bev and I became guardians for Mary Jo, a Down’s Syndrome woman who had spent her entire life in institutions. We cared for Mary Jo for nearly 15 years until her passing. Mary Jo couldn’t tell red from blue and couldn’t count to five. But she could hug you all day long and smile like every day was Christmas.\n\nSiouxland is chock-full of wonderful non-profit organizations who do incredible work for those with special needs. Off the top of my head they are Camp High Hopes, Opportunities Unlimited, S.T.A.R.S. and Mid-Step Services. Without exception, these organizations deliver critical services to their populations in a highly efficient manner.\n\nThe competition for charitable dollars can be intense. Significant needs and great causes go up against limited funds. The federal government has essentially said, “you’re on your own,” and eliminated earmarks under the guise of tax relief. Big mistake. Restore earmarks. They are tax-friendly and, more important, people-friendly.\n\nAll of us have our preferred charities. Mine happen to be those with whom I have a personal relationship. Some of my favorites are Briar Cliff University, the June E. Nylen Cancer Center, Camp High Hopes, the Children’s Miracle Network, Mater Dei Parish and the Mayo Clinic. Bev and I support all of them because they mean so much to us.\n\nI admire all these organizations, but there’s one that really nails it for me. That’s the Miracle League of Sioux City. It combines two interests that I love. Children with special needs and baseball.\n\nThe MVP of this organization is Kevin Negaard. Kevin has brought to fruition a vision that just five years ago was a dream. The Miracle League complex in Riverside Park is simply amazing.\n\nWithout much hype, Kevin began his work to create the Miracle League back in 2013. Fast forward to 2018 and you will find a $1.6 million complex that includes a baseball field for children, playground, mini-golf course, splash pad, music park and walking path. Each entity is designed especially for people with disabilities, but is open to the public. The range in ages of those using the Miracle League park is 3 to 72. You must see it to believe it.\n\nThe Miracle League also represents the good that can happen when the private sector partners with the public sector. None of this happened without the support of the City of Sioux City and corporate benefactors like CNOS and Tyson Foods.\n\nNext September, Sioux City will be hosting the Miracle League All-Star Weekend. This event will bring over 150 players and their families to Sioux City from across the country. All the players are children with special needs. This is a big deal. To pull it off, Kevin and his friends need to raise $300,000. They have very quietly raised one-third of their goal.\n\nWant to help? Here’s your chance. On Nov. 19 the Miracle League will be hosting an event at Rebo’s on Fourth Street. If you love sports, you’ll want to be there. Tickets to the NCAA national championship football game, Green Bay Packers tickets and three items from my Cardinals stash – a valuable Dizzy Dean autograph that my dad asked Dizzy for and received, a 1959 Stan Musial Topps baseball card and an autographed Bob Gibson Cardinal hat - will be auctioned. You’ll hear more about this event in the next few weeks, but I would encourage you to call Kevin at 712-490-0988 and get your tickets today.\n\nThe Miracle League of Sioux City is a home run. Let’s step up to the plate.\n\nNext week: Steve Warnstadt\n\nJim Wharton, of Sioux City, is a former member of the Sioux City Council and a former mayor of Sioux City. He and his wife, Beverly, have one daughter, Dr. Laura Giese, and four grandchildren."
