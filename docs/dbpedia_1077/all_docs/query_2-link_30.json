        "text": "2x Olympic bobsledder and professional soccer player, Shauna Rohbock shares the secret to her success. 🌟👀 After completing the USA bobsled combine, my friend Julia and I invited Shauna and a couple others to lunch to get to know their stories more.⬇️ I was in awe as Shauna shared how she grew up playing soccer from a young age into college. Her college coach shared about an opportunity to tryout for USA bobsled near the end of her college experience and she had a craving to try the sport. She had a natural talent for bobsled and at the same time was also balancing play time on the professional soccer team, San Diego Spirit. ⚽️ Shauna went on to win silver🥈in the 2006 Winter Olympics and have numerous World Cup/ world championship podium finishes for bobsled. When I asked Shauna what helped her most in her journey, she explained that it was her openness to trying new things‼️ She continued by saying that when she was growing up, she played every sport she could get her hands on. This helped to expand her athleticism because she developed multiple skills. Fast forward, when the opportunity came to try bobsled, she was open to the sport because she did not keep herself in the box of only playing soccer and could pull from multiple sport backgrounds to help her out. What you can learn from this🕺: ⭐️Don’t stay inside your box⭐️ I encourage you to try new things, challenge yourself, allow yourself room for growth and new opportunities as you continue through your week! Comment 🙌 below if you enjoyed reading this\n\nGreat leaders elevate everyone around them in all aspects of life. They enable teams to grow by creating a culture of empowerment. Every setback, obstacle, or challenge is an opportunity. It's a culture that breeds success. No one did it better than Coach Dick Gould. Gould coached the men’s tennis team at Stanford University for 38 years, from 1966 to 2004, and built a dynasty. He guided his teams to 17 national championships, compiled a .840 winning percentage with an overall record of 776-148, and produced 10 NCAA singles champions, seven NCAA doubles titles, and 50 All-Americans. Close to 100 percent of Gould’s players graduated, and he spearheaded a fundraising campaign that raised over $25 million to build a state-of-the-art tennis facility on The Farm and fully endow the Stanford men's tennis program. On top of all that, Gould wrote \"Tennis, Anyone?\" (a bestselling how-to book), conducted tennis clinics around the world, and taught a thousand college-age kids how to teach tennis through his own coaching company. In 2018, Gould retired after 57 years at Stanford — five as a student/tennis player, 38 as a coach, and 14 as the director of tennis — setting a standard of excellence that may never be equaled. 🏆 Any leader can create a culture of success with any team or organization. 🚀 ✅ Establish trust 🎯 Encourage action 💪 Provide development opportunities 👏 Recognize and celebrate achievements Champions are made.

My article for site below. #Olympics2028 #lacrosse #squash #baseball #softball #flagfootball #lacrossesixes #wimerworks New Additions Ready For 2028 Olympics As the host for the 2028 Olympics, the United States' organizing committee added five sports: lacrosse, squash, baseball/softball, cricket, and flag football. Each sport has male and female versions, so in effect 10 new medals. Baseball and softball have been there before. Baseball had a run as an official Olympic sport from 1984-2008 before being dropped partially because of the absence of the best professional players. Softball's connection with baseball contributed to a similar stretch, that also saw its removal in the late 2000s. It's not the first time for lacrosse in the Olympics, having been a medal sport in 1904 and 1908, then a demonstration event in 1928, '32, and '48. But it has taken a significant effort (see a great take on this in a recent InsideLacrosse article by Kevin Brown) to get back to the big stage in a slightly different format: 6-person teams instead of 10 men or 12 women. Squash is the lone individual sport of the five new entrants. Cricket is an interesting addition, as it has seen significant growth in the United States, but it traditionally played throughout the Commonwealth and remnants of the old British Empire. And flag football got a major push from the considerable influence and deep pockets of the NFL and its never-ending efforts to grow viewership around the globe. Not unsurprisingly, France chose a bit more avant-garde new sport selections for the upcoming 2024 Olympics: breaking, sport climbing, skateboarding, and surfing. Interesting that with the exception of climbing, all of these sports originated on these shores. Also intriguing sociologically, is that the US chose mostly team sports, while the French chose individual disciplines. For the sports slated for 2028, the next five years will be filled with major activity, as state-sponsored entities will pour resources into their growth to put their best foot forward in the pursuit of new medal opportunities.\n\n🥍 Coaches, players, parents, fans, everyone is so excited to hear about this, and you can count me as one of the excited, for sure. But...for someone who loves this game, it is sad to see how much we had to change the game to make it more palatable for the IOC. 👉🏼 Don't get me wrong, I love 6s as much as the next player, but I will also be the first one to say that 6s can be exclusionary. 👉🏼 Well, this is the Olympics - it's supposed to be exclusionary - it's the best athletes in the world competing! Yes, I agree with you here, but soccer doesn't have to change their format to play, and the fans are still riveted 💯 My fear of exclusion more so exacerbates itself when I think of our younger players and the budding athletes who want to give lacrosse a shot, but are intimidated about this format, or feel that they won't be able to keep up 😕 The game of lacrosse as it is, the full field, celebrates players of all sizes, body types, and abilities, with the understanding that it is these beautiful differences that 👏🏼make 👏🏼up 👏🏼a 👏🏼team. ♟️ Teammates learn to use their strengths & weaknesses, as a whole, and coaches are forced to constantly strategize with these variables in mind, to help make the best outcomes for their team. Again - I LOVE sixes. They are a TON of fun to play in and to coach 🖤 But I'm also privy to my former teammates and people I coach throwing in the towel, because of their pace, and not wanting to compete. (Yes, I know this is NOT the case for the Olympic Games...) 👉🏼 But let's be real. Lacrosse is already a tad exclusionary. It's expensive as hell. (And this format has now added another level to that.) I come from a county where we had no business playing lacrosse - we were too poor to afford it. But our athletes? 🔥 They were amazing - they had the fire that all coaches want on their team! 🥍 However, I'd be crazy to negate the fact that if it wasn't for a coach, who got her own grant to bring it to the school, we would've never been able to experience it. Because of her, we came to the field met with sticks, goggles, and an excitement that this was our opportunity to play. 🧐 Taking this into mind, and the format of the sixes, I'd be silly to say I wasn't nervous, as a lover of the game. 🎉 My hope is that this is just a test and that the full field, beautiful game of lacrosse, will one day make its true entrance onto the world stage. Am I excited about this development though? Hell yeah. If you think I won't be screaming alongside fans around the world, you got another thing coming. I simply wanted to share this alternative opinion. What are your thoughts? #lacrosse #lax #OlympicGames\n\nLeague One Volleyball nabbed $35M in Series B #funding, according to Sportico. \"The round was led by Left Lane Capital, with support from Ares Management Corporation,\" Sportico says. Other backers: #Olympic skier Lindsey Vonn, #NBA's Jayson Tatum, Fenway Sports Group partner Linda Henry, comedian Amy Schumer, and WNBA (Women's National Basketball Association) player Candace Parker. \"Kevin Durant’s Boardroom Sports Holdings , an existing investor, contributed new funding, too.\" LOVB [pronounced 'love' articles mention — the 'B' looks like an 'E', see] #CEO Katlyn Gao said most of Series B #investors were women. This brings its total raised to $60M, according to American City Business Journals coverage. Women's pro sports this year has been all up this year, with more investors, franchises, and value for #WNBA teams; international sports tournaments; and now this. LOVB has teams #Atlanta, #Houston, #Madison, Wisc., #Omaha, Neb., and #SaltLakeCity, and plans to add a sixth. It's more than 40 affiliated network youth clubs have 1,100 teams in 21 states. The league plans a launch next year; two other leagues do as well. Pro Volleyball Federation's celebrity backers include Cincinnati Bengals #QB Joe Burrow [and his parents!]; former #NFL QB and current coach at University of Alabama at Birmingham, Trent Dilfer; and Orlando Magic owner Dan DeVos. DeVos, #chairman of DP Fox Sports & Entertainment [or perhaps DP Fox Ventures?] has the PVF #franchise in Grand Rapids, Mich. The family — which traces its biz life to co-founding Amway — also owns the American Hockey League's Grand Rapids Griffins. Athletes Unlimited has four sports #softball, #lacrosse, indoor #volleyball and #basketball — and raised $30M last October. The number of #girls playing high school volleyball grew 15% in 20 years [2002-2022], Sportico notes. \"The U.S. women’s national team claimed its first Olympic gold in indoor volleyball with a win over Brazil in 2021 and currently ranks No. 2 in the world heading into the ‘24 Games.\" https://lnkd.in/guKPJgx4\n\nLA28 Olympic & Paralympic Games proposes five additional sports for Olympic Games in 2028 Following its review of the LA28 Organising Committee's proposal, the IOC's Olympic Programme Commission will issue a recommendation to the IOC Executive Board. If accepted, it will then be presented to the IOC Session for approval. Five sports have been proposed by the LA28 Organising Committee for inclusion at the Olympic Games in Los Angeles in 2028, pending approval from the International Olympic Committee (IOC). If approved, the final event programme and number of athlete quotas in the additional sports will be finalised in the future. Of the five proposed sports, three have previously been sports contested at the Olympic Games: baseball-softball (1992–2008 and 2020), cricket (1900), and lacrosse (1904 and 1908). Unlike its only previous appearance at the Paris 1900 Games, cricket will not be contested as a two-innings-a-side competition. Instead, the proposal foresees a limited-overs Twenty20 format for the event. The proposed format for lacrosse is Lacrosse Sixes. Lacrosse appeared in consecutive Games in the early 20th century, with Canada winning both gold medals awarded in the sport. Baseball-softball, meanwhile, was most recently included on the Olympic programme at Tokyo 2020 in 2021, where hosts Japan won both gold medals. “LA28’s proposed sports ignite the imagination on the field of play and drive culture off it. They’re relevant, innovative and community-based, played in backyards, schoolyards, community centers, stadiums and parks across the U.S. and the globe,” said LA28 Chairperson Casey Wasserman. “They will bring new athletes to the Games, engage diverse fanbases and expand the Games’ presence in digital spaces, further amplifying LA28’s mission to deliver an unparalleled experience.” They are baseball-softball, cricket, flag football (a limited-contact version of American football), lacrosse, and squash #la28 #summer2028 #olympicgames #losangelesca #fiveadditionalsports #sportsindustry #loc #baseball #softball #flagfootball #lacrosse #squash\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/geAD46nm Hi team, this has been a passion project I’ve been working on for a while to challenge my analytical and strategic abilities in an area of interest, while possibly adding value to one of my great loves that’s in a bit of strife at the moment. Like many passionate Aussie rugby fans, I bottomed out last Monday morning which provided a bit of motivation on the holidays to finish this site off which I’m excited to share. While a pending Wallaby exit from the pool stage is certainly one of the more significant jolts that the games’ experienced- I don’t believe it’s our ‘rock bottom’ as some have suggested. There’s still lots of great things happening across rugby with lots of great people involved. Rock bottom is when they’re all gone and while we’re not there yet, unfortunately we’re on the trajectory for that to become a reality. After 40 years of loving this game and spending half of that time watching its steady decline, I feel compelled to do something beyond a social media rant accompanied by one or two ideas to ‘turn the game around’. Rugby’s problems are a complex mix of interwoven issues that stretch the width of the game (compounded by the challenging landscape it operates in) and there’s no quick fixes. Popular ideas such as ‘getting the game into schools’ at grassroots level, a third tier at the pathways level or signing NRL talent at the elite level are not the answers on their own or even collectively. This plan for an aligned rugby ‘ecosystem’ involves amending structures and delivering integrated strategies from head to toe to ensure that as well producing positive results in the area they specifically relate to, they work together to achieve improved outcomes across the game. I’d love to get feedback from other passionate rugby people and those of you in my network who come with experience in other fields. In addition to my own lived experience in participation and pathways, while observing successful sports both locally and around the globe; conversations with people that have their own unique perspectives is what’s shaped my thoughts and understanding which I’ve now packaged into this. In addition to feedback, this is a bit of a ‘coo-ee’ and I appreciate any shares/likes if you think it’s on the right track. I don’t profess to have all the answers and the ones that I think I do have may be off base, but it would be great to connect with other passionate people in our rugby community to build momentum and elevate the numerous aspects of this important conversation to arrest the decline that ends at the ACTUAL ‘rock bottom’. While we’re still a fair way from it, we’re on that path and I fear some of the more prominent existing strategies such as investing in established NRL talent will lead us there sooner rather than later.\n\nIn high school, our girls' handball team was kind of a buzzkill for the competition. Not because we were jerks – we were all about respect (and crushing it on the court!). Nope, it was because we just kept winning. A LOT. Our school director? She was all about embracing excellence. Provincial tournament wins meant Sunday night victory parades, school door welcomes, and the glorious right to rock our gold medals on Mondays. She drilled \"winning\" into us, and let me tell you, it worked. But here's the flip side: sometimes winning brings out the ugliest in people. Jealousy and envy replaced cheers from rival teams. Ouch. But hey, we were a unit. Our school took handball seriously, with killer coaches and twice-weekly practices. Walk the halls today, and you'll see walls plastered with our team's championship banners – a constant reminder of the glory. We even had victory anthems to keep our spirits high, and let's not forget the epic post-win celebrations. Epic. The point is, having a winning team and a supportive system makes a world of difference. It fuels the fire and makes those victories even sweeter. Don't waste your energy on the haters – let their jealousy be their problem. The real lesson? Own your awesomeness. Shine your light as bright as possible, and inspire others to do the same. Now, let me know... How has winning, or striving to win, shaped your journey? Let's fill the comments with winning stories or epic comebacks! ________ Hi!
