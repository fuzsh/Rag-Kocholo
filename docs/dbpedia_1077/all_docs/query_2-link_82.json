IMPAG contributed to 105 winners for a 92% success rate. Obviously, contributions from Iowa physicians were used effectively. But we cannot stop there. The 1996 elections are just around the comer. We cannot afford to let the interest of medicine be overshadowed by the banter of political rhetoric. The strides made by IMPAG in 1994 must be sustained through 1996 if Iowa physicians are to be heard by their lawmakers. If doctors abdicate responsibility to participate in the political process, it is certain that non-physician groups will take our place. They have already begun their fund-raising and grass roots work for 1996 and we cannot afford to fall behind now. The time has come to step forward and be heard through a strong IMPAG. Join IMP AC today! JANUARY , 1996 IMS DEADLINE news Late-breaking news of interest to Iowa physicians • BIG NEWS FOR IOWA PHYSICIANS ON THE CHMES FRONT unfolded during the past few weeks. It appears as though the July 1, 1996 deadline for Iowa physicians to comply with requirements of the Commianity Health Management Information System (CHMIS) will be delayed one year. As you probably already know, the CHMIS law passed by the Iowa Legislature three years ago called for mandatory electronic claims processing and a central data repository containing information taken from HCFA-1500 and UB-92 claim forms. Bids for setting up the data repos- itory received by the CHMIS Governing Board in mid-December were over twice as high as anticipated. The Iowa Legislature anticipated that the CHMIS would be paid for by the par- ticipants and allocated no funds to support it. The Governing Board has no idea how to fund the data repository at the level of the current bids . They Governing Board has decid- ed to ask the 1996 Iowa Legislature for an extension of the deadline while they try to decide the future of the CHMIS. Rest assured that the IMS will continue participating in this process to ensure that physician concerns are addressed. Late last month, the IMS sent a mailing to all member physicians notifying them of these important CHMIS developments. Additional details can be found on page 11, or call Ed Whitver of the IMS staff. •medicare coding errors are the focus of a clampdown which began January 1 . Though recent issues of Iowa Medicine have contained details, it bears repeating that this initia- tive is beginning. Medicare carriers plan to run all claims through computerized screens ' designed to catch physicians who bill for incorrect combinations of services. The screens are programmed to spot over 87,000 incorrect combinations. For more details, call Barb Cannon at the IMS, 800/747-3070. •the federal register published DECEMBER 8, 1995 contains the 1996 Relative Value Units, conversion factors and discussion of changes to Medicare payment policy. The pub- lished information is effective January 1, 1996 although there is a comment period until Februaiy 6, 1996. Copies can be ordered from the Government Printing Office for $8.

V\\(hen the plan was announced, IMS staff estimated the services being bundled could total $500. IMS approached the DHS to voice extreme concern on behalf of Iowa physicians and the DHS reevaluated the decision. Physicians will receive a letter of explanation from Unisys — the Medicaid fiscal intermediary — completely rescinding the policy. If you have questions, call Barb Cannon of the IMS staff. • THE IMS IS LAUNCHING A PRCX3RAM which will help Iowa physicians understand HCFA's new documentation requirements for E & M coding. The program has three components — a series of workshops around the state, a chart scoring service and a video self-study course. Complete details were mailed to all IMS members. The insert in this month's magazine includes a registration form for the workshops.

We asked the ABI leaders what they look for when selecting a health plan for employees. The reply, not unexpectedly, was cost and value (value being loosely translated as quali- . ty). Naturally, the next question involved how you determine quality. Their reply was, “Our employees tell us and we listen.” Thus, it is the employees impression of care that is very important to the employer. Wliat physi- cians regard as quality of care may not be the same and may not be as important to the patient. This dichotomy was pointed out in a study done a few years ago by the Picker Institute. They noted that quality in health care has two distinct connota- tions. One has to do with profes- sional competence, the appropri- ateness of exams, technical quality of diagnostic and thera- peutic procedures, etc. This is appropriately assessed by profes- sional standards. The quality of the patient’s experience is another issue. This can be assessed only by the patients themselves and this is what concerns ABI employers. A Prudential survey of what patients want yielded the following: patients want emotion- |i al support, someone who listens to them, compassion, someone who remembers them by name and someone who gives them a feel- ing of being cared about. No real surprise here for most physicians I am sure. The sur- vey also revealed that if a patient could talk 46 to 60 seconds without being interrupted, he or she felt they had been listened to. A great return for a small investment of time. The Picker Institute survey revealed seven broad areas of care that most affected patient’s experiences: 1) Respect for patient’s values, prefer- ences and expressed needs. 2) Coordination of care and integration of services within an institutional setting. 3) Communication between the patient and providers, dissemination of accurate, timely and appropriate information and edu- cation regarding the long-term implications of disease and illness. 4) Physical care, comfort and alleviation of pain. 5) Emotional support and alle- viation of fears and anxiety. 6) Involvement of family and friends. 7) Continuity of care during the transition from one locus to another. Most threatening to patients was the sense of vulnerability and helplessness that illness and hospitalization create and the dependen- cy on others even for help with the most rou- tine activities of daily living. Help from their doctors in addressing these concerns defines quality care in the eyes of patients and it behooves us as doctors to be aware of this. IE3 Their reply was, “Our employees tell us and we listen” Joseph K MD Iowa Medicine Volume 86 / 1 January 1996 7 MANAGED CARE news you can use Capitation not as prevalent in Minnesota HMDs as believed Contrary to belief, capitation is not the payment method of choice used by Minnesota IIMOs. Alliana Health System, one of Minnesota’s mega-HMOs, uses just 21% capitation. Some providers want to capitate to lock in capitation rates based on current utilization, HMOs want to wait until utilization declines further to negotiate more favorable rates. Federal ruling clears way for Finley-Mercy plan to proceed A federal Judge has ruled that the U.S. Department of Justice failed to prove that a merger between Mercy Health Center and Finley Hospital would create a regional monopoly. According to a recent story in the Dubuque Telegraph Herald, the ruling clears the way for the long-delayed merger to take place. The new partnership will be called Dubuque Regional Health Services. In 1993, the two hospitals had combined gross revenues of about K150 million. A spokeswoman for the Justice Department said an appeal is being considered. Will there be a future role for fee-for-service medicine? Despite the growth of managed care, the American Medical Association maintains there will always be a role for fee-for-service medicine and the results of a recent survey seem to support that position. The survey of Massachusetts residents showed those with fee-for- service health care were happier than people in HMOs, reported the Journal of Commerce. In the survey of 411 people, 93% of those with fee-for-service said they were satisfied; 6% were dissatisfied. Of HMO members, 82% said they were satisfied; 16% were dissatisfied. The survey was conducted by the University of New Hampshire. Deere clinics set to open this month in Des Moines Two John Deere Health System clinics under construction for several months will open this month. A facility in Urbandale was built from scratch; the second facility is the old Best Buy building near Merle Hay Mall. Each building had a ;^1.15 million budget, according to the Des Moines Business Record. How much patient care will managed care eliminate? The march of managed care, new technologies and alternative settings will prompt a 34% decrease in inpatient hospital days over the five years from 1994 to 1999, according to a new analysis by the Sachs Group. In the same period, discharges could decline by 26% while average length of stay could drop from 6.1 days to 5.5 days. The study predicted that ' ambulatory facilities will eliminate many surgical inpatient days, with orthopedics dropping ' 38% and general surgery down 15%. The use of birthing centers will increase and many new ( mothers and healthy newborns will be in the hospital for stays averaging 12 hours that won’t j count as discharges. 8 Iowa Medicine Volume 86 / 1 .kinuary 1996 A guideline by any other name They’re being called by many different i names — practice parameters, utilization guidelines, protocols, “best” practices or care management criteria. ! No matter what euphemism you choose, they are practice guidelines and their major purpose is to manage cost. Such guidelines are becoming more prevalent in discussions of health care reform and managed care. Practice guidelines are being used in a ■ variety of ways: to reduce liability risk, to assess quality, to guide case decision-making. Perhaps the most apparent to physicians is i the use of guidelines to make admission, discharge and continuing stay decisions. The press is full of examples where medical judgment and managed care guidelines clash. Practice guidelines will be a source of ' conflict as physicians advocate for medically necessary care and services while managed care entities assert cost management. I Physician input, discussion and partic- ipation in determining guidelines and adequate time for education and assimilation ■ into practice routines are key elements for i successful implementation of guidelines. I Do guidelines affect physician behavior? Many important issues remain unresolved. For example, do practice guidelines affect physician decisions? An article in the November 16 issue of JAMA reports on the effect of utilization review on physician behavior. The article concluded that both actual review and sham review may have I decreased physician use of hospital services. Do guidelines consider quality issues? How do guidelines affect access to care? Should guidelines be public or held by private firms? Trying to balance medical judgment and practice guidelines can place physicians in ' an ethical dilemma. Ultimately, the physician I is liable for patient care and nothing should override medical judgment. Yet, patient relationships are strained when services are not paid. Grievance procedures may be time- consuming. Add to this the pressure of financial incentives for reducing costs. Recent court cases have set a precedent regarding adverse managed care decisions — that the physician who does not protest a managed care organization decision that is contrary to the physician’s medical judgment risks liability exposure. Brand new ethical issues In this dawning era of managed care, physicians are struggling with ethical issues unheard of just a decade ago. In a recent article in LACMA Physician, experts listed the following as the top five ethical issues inherent in managed care: 1. Maintaining clinical autonomy; 2. deliv- ering different standards of care based on a patient’s payer; 3. informed consent and sharing of information; 4. incentives for underutilization; 5. limitations on services. Change is inevitable and practice guide- lines will be part of that change. However, it is essential for physicians to pay attention to guidelines as they are being developed and implemented and to participate in ongoing evaluation of the guidelines. AMA policy states that all practice guidelines should be developed with the involvement of relevant physician organizations and with mechanisms to monitor their use.

CHMIS DATA REPOSITORY BIDS The CHMIS Governing Board has received four bids in response to the Request for Proposals (RFP) from compa- nies interested in becoming the data repository. Bids were received from IBM, the Iowa Foundation for Medical Care, National Computer Systems and Shared Medical Systems. A committee has been established to review the bids and will make a recom- mendation to the Governing Board at its December 15, 1995 meeting. It is antici- pated the Governing Board will review the contract at that time. Awarding the contract for the data repository will influence many future deci- sions on how CHMIS evolves, especially how the CHMIS will be financed. CHMIS PRIORITIES The CHMIS Governing Board has devel- oped the following list of goals to accom- plish during 1996 and will prioritize this list in December. • Ensure that all networks operating in Iowa will be able to communicate with other Iowa networks and accept all payer claims. • Ensure that all networks comply with Iowa network certification rules. • Develop a plan to implement eligibili- ty, remittance advice and supplemental information as a part of the Iowa CHMIS. • Ensure that all hospitals will be sub- mitting standardized claims data elements in the American National Standard Institute format. • Ensure that pharmacy networks will submit the agreed-to subset of outpatient pharmacy claims. • Identify the vendor partner for the CHMIS data repository. • Develop a plan to administer patient satisfaction/liealth surveys. • Identify additional provider groups to join the system and develop a timeline for their participation. • Deal with transfer of data between the Iowa Health Data Commission and CHMIS. • Develop a financing plan and fee structure. Late-breaking CHMIS news — Governing Board seeks one-year delw At a meeting of the CHMIS Governing Board December 15, IMS representatives learned that funding the data repository component of the CHMIS will be much more dif- ficult than anticipated. The CHMIS Governing Board received four bids on the reposito- ry. Two bids were discarded for not meeting the criteria and the remaining two bids are more than double the amount projected by the CHMIS Governing Board. When the Iowa Legislature passed the CHMIS bill — which mandates electronic claims submission and a central data repository containing information collected from claim forms — no funding was provided. The CHMIS Governing Board expected to fund the data repository through a two-cent per claim surcharge; an 18-cent per-claim surcharge could be required to fund the data repository bids received in December. The CHMIS Board will ask the Iowa Legislature for a one-year delay in imple- menting CHMIS, which was originally scheduled for implementation for Iowa physi- cians on July 1, 1996. A task force will be appointed to study the Board s options. Since the Iowa CHMIS was first proposed, IMS representatives and IMS members have continually raised concerns about the proposed data repository, particularly the issue of patient confidentiality.

The Medical Records Omfidentiali ty Act would .specify who may see medical re- cords and under what circu mstances. • Several major newspa- pers reported that Medicare’s 37 million beneficiaries will not feel the effects of the GOP budget-balancing bill, if it becomes law. • Congressional auditors recently disclosed that the price tag for Hillary (Jlinton's health care task force was nearly S14 million. The task force attemj)ting to overhaul our health care system was origi- nally projected to cost less than SI ()(),()()(). Legislative committee meets with payers The Iowa Legislature eonvenes on January 8 and the IMS Committee on Legislation has finalized priorities for the 1996 session. In addition to priorities reported in the Deeember Iowa Medicine, the committee has added a priority of the Iowa Chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians. The IMS will support legislation to provide enhanced penalties for assaults on health care workers in hospitals. Health care work- ers are increasingly subject to violence in hospital emergency rooms. It is hoped that enhanced penalties will deter these assaults. The committee invited representatives of third party payer organizations to attend the meeting and discuss the issue of postpartum hospital stays. Representatives of John Deere Health Plans, Blue Cross Blue Shield and Principal Health Care presented their compa- ny’s policies on hospital length of stays. While policies differ between payers, all voiced opposition to legislative intervention in the issue. The IMS will continue to discuss this issue with third party payers, legislators and other interested groups and individuals in preparation for the legislation session. WJiile the IMS has long opposed legislative mandates, the IMS is concerned about insuf- ficient medical consultation on these kinds of issues. Several legislators have requested that bills be drafted to address this issue. The IMS, Iowa Medical Group Management Association (IMGMA) and Polk County Medical Society are working with third party payers to develop a uniform credentialing form for use by managed care organizations. Development of a universal form would sig- nificantly decrease the administrative burden placed on physician offices as physicians join new managed care networks or are recreden- tialed for existing networks. Contact Becky Roorda of the IMS staff for more information on these and other legisla- tive issues. IMS leaders meet with lawmakers Iowa physicians attending the AMA Interim Meeting in Washington, DC were among those using the meeting as an oppor- tunity to discuss Medicare reform with Iowa congressmen. The timing of the meeting was crucial since it fell during the last two weeks before required action on the budget. During round two of the Medicare reform battle, the AMA pledged to fight for four out- standing Medicare issues — antitrust reform for Provider Sponsored Organizations; CLIA reform; medical liability reform; medical sav- ings accounts; and the ^^350 floor for capitat- ed Medicare payment. A memorandum from the AMA govern- ment affairs staff asked that physicians take the time to thank members of Congress who went “above and beyond” during the first round of the Medicare debate. Rep. Greg Ganske was on the list of those mentioned. IMS leaders expressed appreciation to Rep. Ganske on behalf of organized medicine. As of press time, Gongress remained dead- locked over the key issues of tax cuts, Medicaid, Medicare and other nondefense spending.

This requirement has been in effect since May of 1992. In Iowa, preauthorization of these cases can be obtained by calling PRO-West at 800/783-2477. Phones are staffed from 5:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday-Friday. You may fax your preauthorization request to 800/431-2565. Authorization must be obtained not more than 30 days and not less than two working days prior to the admission or procedure. If the admission or surgery is urgent, providers have up to two working days afterward to obtain authorization. MGMA expands member board The Medical Group Management Association has agreed to expand its 14 member board in 1996 to include two non- voting physician members. MGMA has campaigned throughout the year to educate the administrator-dominated group about the importance of physician input in board debates. Insurers expect boost from GOP plan Medicare reform has the health insurance industry gearing up for a huge increase in business. GOP proposals to encourage more Medicare beneficiaries to enroll in managed care plans could triple insurers’ share of the health care market, from 8% to 24%. If the GOP plan passes, this could translate into an enormous revenue increase for insur- ers. By the year 2002, they would handle a projected $70 billion in Medicare business annually, compared to )$15 billion today. In anticipation of this boost. Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in several states are making plans to aggressively market their Medicare managed care products. The GOP legislation gives the elderly an incentive to join managed care plans — it eliminates the need for Medigap policies that cover costs not included in Medicare. Critics say there will be little to prevent managed care plans from discouraging high- cost patients from joining; insurers say that Republicans are going to require IIMOs to take all comers. The Republican plan will also make it easier for physicians to form their own provider networks. Handbook for older lowans AT A GLANCE Experts predict that by 1998, HMOs will cover 80% of all employees, up from 65% now. In the short term, this tneans lower premium hikes for most employers. How- ever, costs may jump afiain later. • A legal information and resource guide produced by the Young Lawyers Division of the Iowa State Bar Association is now avail- able. The booklet gives legal information on a number of topics of interest to the elderly and also lists programs and resources for elderly services.

Cost of premiums slowing The Chicago Sun Times recently reported on a new study showing that the cost of monthly premiums for health insurance is slowing around the country. However, Midwesterners still pay the most in premiums for health maintenance organi- zations and preferred provider organizations. HMO premiums in Illinois rose 3.4% in 1995, compared to the national average of 1%. lEI] According to a study reported in JAMA, physi- cians often misunder- stand or ignore patients’ last requests, resulting in large numbers of peo- ple who die alone, in pain and hooked to arti- ficial life support. The article reports that advance directives were recognised in only about 25% of hospital admis- sions. Physicians — especially those in pri- mary’ care — have a spe- cial role to play in encouraging the use of advance directives, the article concluded.

This replaces the local modifier — “ZS”. Physicians are advised to continue using CPT modifier — ZS on E & M service codes to indi- cate the E & M serivce was separately identi- fiable. Incorrect answer in Part B News The November 13, 1995 “Special Report” of Part B News included an answer to a ques- tion on coding which is not correct for billing Iowa Medicare claims. Question #4 stated that a patient’s primary care physician cannot use a consultation code to bill for the evaluation of their estab- lished patient for a surgeon prior to surgery. This is not correct for Iowa Medicare billing. The June, 1993 Medicare Info addresses this issue and states that consultation codes are appropriate as long as the criteria for a consultation are met (Physician A asks Physician B for an opinion on a specific prob- lem and Physician B responds.) Either office or inpatient consultation codes are appropriate, depending on where the service was performed. Advice on coding phone calls to patients In a recent article in a specialty society newsletter, a consultant suggested that physi- cians may choose E & M visit codes which are one level higher to compensate for telephone calls to patients and review of lab results between visits. This advice is very mislead- ing. The E & M code must be selected based on the documented services performed on the day you see the patient. 113 Midwest Medical Insurance Company Focus ON Risk Management A case of communication breakdown A patient was examined by her physician for complaints of a lump in her breast. A mammogram identified a suspicious lesion near the right nipple. She was referred to a surgeon, but no clinical information was pro- vided to the surgeon. The surgeon attempted to aspirate a lump on the far side of the right breast. In a report to her physician, the surgeon said he was unable to obtain any fluid and believed all findings to be normal. The surgeon described the areas he had palpated and aspirated. The areas he described were different from the area of suspicion on the mammogram. The physician did not notice the discrep- ancy and advised the patient that findings were normal. He told her to have a repeat mammogram in the near future, but she did not follow through. One year later, she was diagnosed with carcinoma of the right breast. Significant lymph node metastases were pre- sent and a malpractice claim was filed. This case illustrates a frequent cause of claims — a breakdown in communication between physicians. Inadequate communica- tion between providers can result in failure to follow up on potentially serious condi- tions, the prescription of contraindicated medications or confusion about who is responsible when problems arise. Managed care may have an impact on the quality of communication as physicians are less likely to know or have worked with each other. To minimize the risk of patient injury: •Provide consultants with adequate clini- cal information. •Spell out responsibility for follow-up care. •Complete written reports to referring physicians in a timely manner.

MSAs ease health care squeeze Dear Editor: If there was one thing Americans concluded during the 1994 health care debate, it was that price controls and top-heavy bureaucracy are not the answer. Health maintenance organiza- tions (HMOs) are providing doctors and pa- tients just that — price controls and bureau- crats dictating medi- cal treatment proce- dure. In addition, ex- panded use of HMOs does not get at the un- derlying problem fac- ing our nation’s health care system — the ex- ploding costs which threaten the availability of quality health care for many Americans. Instead, health care providers are forced to shift costs where they can; savings in one area result in added costs somewhere else. The Con- gressional Budget Office (CBO) states, “. . . it cannot be assumed that further growth of man- aged care would reduce either the level or the rate of increase of system-wide health spending.” As HMOs expand, there will be fewer areas left to bear the eost shifts. Providers will have to accept less income for their services and/or cease providing charity services and taldng Medicare patients, whom doctors already treat at about 70% of cost (according to the CBO). As for those patients covered under HMOs, the quality of their health care will be threat- ened. The only way in which insurers and providers can slow rising costs will be to limit the availability of services. Which brings us to the opportunities pre- sented by medieal savings aeeounts (MSAs). Basieally an MSA is a high deductible cata- strophic insurance plan aecompanied by a sav- ings aecount whieh the individual ean use for day-to-day health eare expenses. Employers and employees deposit their respeetive shares into the MSA and unused funds in the aeeount Letter to the Editor eolleet interest and ean be carried into subse- quent years. The individual would have an ineentive to use the savings account wisely, as any money over a certain balanee could be withdrawn for personal use or rolled over into , an IRA. Some have argued that poor people will not be able to take advantage of MSAs. But, U.S. Congressman, Dr. Greg Ganske, writes, “This argument would only be true if the funds in an MSA aeeount were available for non-medical uses . . . MSA withdrawals, however, are only permitted to pay for health eare expenses.” Nor do MSAs result in favorable seleetion or “cherry picking” that has occurred with HMOs. The eatastrophic insurance will provide 100% coverage to those individuals whose health eosts exeeed the deduetible. Although employers are offering MSAs to their employees, inequitable tax treatment by Congress is retarding their growth. Congress needs to aet quiekly to eliminate this inequi- table tax treatment. Also, MSAs need to be offered to Medieare reeipients as an option, both for the recipients’ benefit and to help maintain Medieare’s solveney. Health eare providers, particularly doctors, have been caught in the viee between rising demands and eosts for health eare and shrink- ing reimbursements from third-party payers..- Medieal savings aeeounts would loosen this grip, allowing doetors and patients to breathe easier. — Steve Grubbs, state representative, ; Davenport.

Iowa Medicine Volume 86/1 January 1 996 17 Iowa I Medicine FEATURE ARTICLE Stay Hauglaxd, MD Dr. Haugland is a family physician who practices at Iowa Methodist Medical Center. He is medical director at the Powell Chemical Dependency Center and chair of the IMS Subcommittee on Aging. Though we live in a violent society, hurting the elderly and children — those who are most defenseless — seems especially deplorable. This month’s Iowa Medicine examines the problem of elder abuse. The following articles by Iowa physicians discuss how to recognize it and what to do about it. No culture has been without elder abuse and neglect; however, only since the mid- 1970s has it gained the attention of the medical community. In 1975, A. A. Baker described “granny battering”. His work generated a plethora of terms noted for their lack of clarity in defining this type of behavior. My own preference is simply “inadequate elder treatment”. Physicians required to report elder abuse Those of us in the healing arts must report abuse of anyone who is dependent on another for daily needs. We may be charged with a misdemeanor if we fail in this duty. The prevalence of elder abuse and neglect is estimated at 4% of those over age 65; the actual prevalence may be between 10-15%. In Iowa, there are 426,106 persons over the age of 65. Four percent would mean 17,044 abused elders. At 10%, the best guess would mean we probably have at least 42,610 abused elders. The reasons for under-reporting are lack of screening, the fear that reporting will make a bad situation worse and ageism. Some health care workers may feel that the elderly person is not worth as much as a younger person and may not live much longer anyway. Our culture’s emphasis on youth and beauty doesn’t work to the advantage of the elderly. Most abuse done by family members Abuse can be physical, emotional, psychological, sexual and financial or can be I simply neglecting to provide the necessities of life. We tend to view abuse and neglect , differently in cases where the care givers are ; actually trying their best to help the victim but may be doing the wrong thing due to ignorance or stress. Physicians contribute to this problem whenever we treat older adults with less respect than younger patients or speak to and listen to the care giver instead of the patient. It appears that most abuse and neglect are committed by family | members (65% by spouses; 23% by j children). The majority of victims { of elderly abuse appear to be males | because males are less likely to be living alone as they age. Why does anyone allow abuse and neglect to occur? The victims They may be embarrassed for anyone to know their spouse or child is abusing them. 18 Iowa Medicine Volume 86 / 1 Januarv 1996 FEATURE ARTICLE are usually frail, have multiple impairments, are afraid they will end in a nursing home if they tell anyone and sometimes believe they deserve the abuse. They may also be embarrassed for anyone to know their spouse or child is abusing them because this means ' they have failed as a parent or spouse. I Why do care givers abuse? Transgenerational abuse and neglect does occur, although much less frequently than ( other types. In transgenerational abuse, the [ care giver was abused by the patient over the years and now the tables have turned. Abuse by caregivers with a serious mental health problem also occurs, but these cases are a minority. Why do care givers abuse? Many are older and becoming frail themselves. Others are simply overburdened with care giving duties in addition to taking care of themselves and their families. Stress is a major factor behind abuse and neglect. This is important for physicians to appreciate because relieving care giver stress may help alleviate abuse. Whenever abuse is suspected, it is imperative to interview the patient and care giver separately. It may well be that the physician will need to concentrate on the patient while another staff member speaks . with the care giver. Interview in a positive fashion. For the care giver, it is important that questions be I asked in a way that indicates you are aware of the burden they may be carrying and that you wish to help, perhaps by sending a social worker or nurse into their home. Having a third party come to the home is often a ‘ significant factor in reducing abuse. i What to ask patients, care givers Questions to ask the care giver include; “How are you getting along?” “How may I help you?” “Does the stress sometimes overwhelm you?” or “How do you reduce your stress?” Questions to ask the patient include: “Do you feel safe in your neighborhood?” “Do you feel safe in your home?” “Does anyone ever hurt or take advantage of you?” Emphasizing the nature of the physician-patient relation- ship may encourage the victim to be candid. In some instances, it may be necessary to recommend that the patient be transferred to an intermediate care facility or into the hospital if circumstances justify an admission. It is important to remember that the physician may be the only individual who sees the victim and the care giver. This means the physician is in a unique position to ameliorate this problem. Violence against anyone is despicable. It is unlikely that such behavior can ever be eliminated, but it can be ameliorated if we take an interest. We in the helping and healing arts need to remind ourselves that our patients look to us for leadership. We do not have to like each other, but we need to be kind to each other. Dr. Peabody’s address to the American Medical Association in 1927 still holds true. “The best patient care is caring for the patient.” [Ml The physician may be the only person who sees the victim and the care giver. Signs of elder abuse and neglect •Unexplained injuries/accidents •Conflicting stories from the patient and caregiver •Drug/alcohol use by the patient or caregiver •Dementia, tendency to wander •Incontinence •Fear or depression •Dehydration, mal- nutrition, poor hygiene •Inappropriate or soiled clothing •Caregiver an<iwers all questions, even when questions addressed to the patient Iowa Medicine Volume 86 / 1 January' 1996 19 lowalMetliciiie ELDER ABUSE Elder abuse reporting and ethical dilemmas a LEWS Williams, MI) Dr. Williams is with the University af Iowa Department of Family Fractice. In cases of suspected elder abuse, the first consideration is the safety and well-being of the patient. The seeond priority is to report any suspicion of abuse to the designated state authority.^ Physicians are mandatory reporters as are all health care practitioners who in the course of their employment examine, attend, counsel or treat a dependent adult who they reasonably believe has been abused. Any one of these professionals who believes that abuse has oeeurred but who found out about it outside their job is a permissive reporter. 2 Iowa has elder abuse hotline Many states, including Iowa, have an elder abuse hotline for reeeiving confidential reports about abuse in the community or health eare facility. The toll-free 24-hour Iowa number is 800/362-2178 (in-state only). The person in charge of the dependent adult must be informed of the report and, if there is immediate danger, the local law enforcement agency must be notified. A member of the staff of a hospital or similar institution who attends a suspeeted victim, must notify the person in charge of the institution. They, in turn, will make the report to the Department of Inspeetions and Appeals. 2 Physicians may hesitate to report because to do so would be to breach the confidentiality of the doetor-patient relationship. Amer- ican Medical Association guide- lines for elder abuse and neglect say that a physician’s duty to report supersedes the issues of doctor-patient confidentiality. There is little case law on the subject to help physicians make ethical decisions.! Physicians may also be uncomfortable ! when they report suspected abuse because the privacy of the patient and family is being i violated. Another issue is whether the abuse ' investigation itself might cause harm by disturbing family relationships or by | provoking the alleged perpetrator to anger. A i dependent elderly person who becomes ’ angry with the physieian may be discouraged | from seeking future medical help. 3 Taking the time to talk to the patient and the family is important. It is necessary to explain earefully that physicians are compelled to report by law and that states have the power to protect people who are unwilling or unable to protect themselves. The goal of reporting is to stop the abuse, to organize help and meet unmet needs. However a 1986 survey of Iowa providers showed that 36% of their clients refused to allow the abuse to be reported. 3 There is little case law on the subject to help physicians make ethical decisions. Immunity for good faith reports A mandatory reporter who does not report dependent adult abuse is guilty of a simple misdemeanor but is also civilly liable for any proximate damages. A person who reports in good faith or assists in evaluating a 20 Iowa Medicine Volume S6 / I .lanuary 1996 FEATURE ARTICLE case of abuse is immune from civil or criminal liability. Before reporting, three faets must be established: That the elder is a dependent adult. Under Iowa Code 441-176.1 (235B), dependent adult is defined as a person 18 years of age or older who is unable to protect the person’s own interests or unable to adequately perform or obtain services necessary to meet essential human needs, as a result of a physical or mental condition which requires assistance from another. 2 That the caretaker is identified. Under Iowa Code 441-176.1 (235B), a caretaker is a related or unrelated person who has the responsibility for the protection, care or custody of a dependent adult as a result of assuming the responsibility voluntarily, by contract. through employment, or by order of the court. ^ That lawful abuse has occurred. (See table below for the Iowa Code definitions of dependent adult abuse.) Specific time deadlines are established for reporting and investigating eases in Iowa, after the initial eall to the Elder Abuse Hotline. (See next page.) Sometimes a reporter is allowed to give the eomplete report by telephone, otherwise a written report must be delivered to the local, district or state Department of Human Services office, county attorney or a law enforcement agency. The official reporting form may be used or a form developed by the reporter. The report should eontain details of the victim’s dependence, the nature and extent of the abuse and the names and addresses of continued Specific time deadlines are established for reporting and investigating cases in Iowa. Iowa Code definitions related to adult abuse Adidt abuse means any of the following as a result of the willfid or negligent acts or omissions of a caretaker: 1. Physical injury to or unreasonable confinement or unreasonable punishment of a dependent adult. 2. The commission of a sexual offense under Iowa Code chapter 709 or Iowa Code section 726.2 with or against a dependent adult. 3. Exploitation of a dependent adult which means the act or process of taking unfair advantage of a dependent adult or the misuse of the adult’s physical or financial resources for one’s own personal or pecuniary profit by the use of undue influence, harassment, duress, deception, false representation or false pretense. 4. The deprivation of the minimum food, shelter, clothing, supervision, physical and mental health care and other care necessary to maintain a dependent adult’s life or health. 5. The deprivation of the minimum food, shelter, clothing, supervision, physical and mental health care and other care necessary to maintain a dependent adult’s life or health as a result of the acts or omissions of the dependent adult.

It is important to maintain accurate, detailed medical records with notes of conversations and photographs or X-rays, if indicated. All these may be needed in court proceedings and must be stored in a secure area. May need court-appointed conservator A complete investigation is then conducted. Investigators may include county attorneys, law enforcement officers, multidisciplinary teams and social service agencies, with the assistance of the physician reporter. The outcome will be a determination whether the abuse report is founded, unfounded or undetermined. Approximately 25% of the 300 elder abuse cases reported each year in Iowa are founded. 3 Copies of the completed report are sent to the county attorney. Central Registry, the dependent adult (or guardian) and the alleged perpetrator. The court may appoint a guardian or conservator and order services, or it may suggest voluntary services such as day care, home health aide or visiting nurses. An incompetent adult who refuses services may need a court-appointed conservator or guardian. In this case, the physician will need to evaluate the patient’s cognitive state. Nobody can force com- petent elderly people to accept assistance they do not want. Thus, if they refuse the recommended services nothing will have changed. When this happens, the involved professionals are usually very frustrated and may feel that the report, the investigation and the associated stress made no difference to the patient. Training requirements for reporters All mandatory reporters must meet state requirements for training on dependent adult abuse. The Code of Iowa requires two hours training within one month of employment (or within six months if group- trained), followed by two hours retraining every five years thereafter. The prescribed curriculum includes recognition of elder abuse and reporting procedures. Proposed changes in the Iowa elder abuse laws will not alter the reporting laws and are unlikely to affect physicians’ roles. Definitions of dependency and caretakers are likely to become more inclusive and some changes are to be expected in how abuse investigations are conducted. In the long run, increasing public awareness of elder abuse is likely to be more effective in decreasing the incidence of abuse than any changes in the law.

FEATURE ARTICLE Abuse and neglect can be categorized as active or passive. Physical abuse may be intentional or unintentional. It is difficult without a social history to differentiate between intentional vs. unintentional abuse and active vs. passive neglect. Indicators of intentional neglect Upon evaluation of a patient, there may be certain indicators that there has been intentional neglect. These indicators may include injuries that have not been taken care of properly or have not been reported to the physician. Apparent fear or flinching as you move toward the patient, chronic cuts, lacerations, puncture wounds and bruises are indicators of abuse. The patient may have both new and old bruises. Other indicators are; chronic malnu- trition, dehydration, pallor and other signs of inadequate care such as bedsores, insect bites, inadequate administration of medication, poor skin hygiene, soiled bed and clothing and burns which have the appearance of cigarette burns. Unsual signs of fractures, recurring fractures, spiral fractures of the femur and chronic dislocations of the larger extremities may point to physical violence on an intentional basis. Confining someone, tying them to furniture or locking them in a room are all symptoms of an abusive situation. Bone injuries that have not been seen in a timely fashion are signs of physical abuse. Also be on the lookout for repetitive skin and body injuries. During home visits, it may be noted that the patient is not dressed appropriately and that the patient needs a walker, cane, etc. but none is available. The house may be cold and the patient may be living in unsafe conditions. This usually is a type of passive abuse, but can be active abuse. Frequent use of an emergency room and doctor shopping may also indicate physical abuse. During the examination, the physician should carefully evaluate the circumstances of an injury, the type of injury and discuss the nature of the injury with the patient. If you have an established rapport with the patient, you may be able to ask directly if the injury is the result of abuse. Take note of whether the patient seems fearful of the caretaker or if the patient seems to have a panic disorder. Facts about elder abuse In Iowa • Elder abuse is one of the most under recognized and under reported social problems in America. It is far less likely to be reported than child abuse because of lack of public awareness. • Experts say only one of 14 incidents of elder abuse comes to the attention of law enforcement or human services agencies. Last year in Iowa, 1,000 cases of elder abuse were reported. • Elder abuse can happen anywhere — in private homes, at health care facilities and in the community.

Iowa ranks first in the nation in the percentage of persons age 85 and older, second in the nation in percentage of persons age 75 and older and third in the nation in percentage of persons age 65 and older. It is predicted that elder abuse will be a growing problem in the next century as the population of those over age 60 increases from the current 41 million to 72 million by the year 2000. Elder abuse can take the form of verbal abuse, sexual abuse, physical abuse, financial exploitation, neglect by the caregiver or self- neglect. Abuse through neglect (failing to provide for the person’s basic needs) is more prevalent among older persons and persons with disabilities. What is available for the victim of elder abuse? A variety of community resources are available to assist victims, families and the public in addressing this issue, [d Deaxxa Clingan- Fischer, JD Ms. Clingan-Fischer is legal services developer for the Iowa Department of Elder Affairs.

PROBLEMS IN THE SYSTEM • Guardians or conservators are not always available for low-income clients. • Even clients with income cannot always find an appropriate guardian or conservator. • Services cannot be initiated in “founded” cases unless the client and/or care giver agree to receive the services or a guardian is appointed who consents to services for the client. • Accessible emergency services such as emergency respite care or emergency protective services for adults are not available. • There is a lack of alternative places to live such as foster homes or other non- institutional living arrangements. Many choose to stay in an abusive situation rather than face the unknown. • Mandatory reporting of suspected abuse can jeopardize the relationship of trust betwen the client (victim) and those attempting to help such as the physician or the agency providing services. • There is a lack of public awareness about the extent and causes of elder abuse. • There are inadequate resources allocated for prevention, enforcement of the statute and provision of services. • Background checks of professional care givers are not always conducted. • Evaluators do not specialize in adult abuse and need more training in working with elderly victims. • There is a lack of coordination between agencies involved in dependent adult abuse issues. PROBLEMS WITH THE LAW • The definition of what “dependent” means is unclear as it relates to dependent adults. • The law narrows the potential perpetrator to the care giver, disregarding others who might be involved. • There is confusion over the concepts of child abuse, domestic abuse and dependent adult and elder abuse. • The victim must initiate legal action by filing charges. • Psychological or emotional abuse is not specifically addressed in the law. • Consequences are not incorporated into the statute. • The mandatory reporters definition should include employees of financial institutions. PROPOSED CHANGES In response to concerns identified by the Elder Abuse Committee, Area Agencies on Aging and service providers, the Department of Elder Affairs plans to introduce draft legislation which would change portions of the current dependent adult abuse law. The proposed changes to the law redefine the terms “caretaker”, “dependent adult” and “exploitation” and proposes creation of a multidisciplinary team to assist in assessing the needs of dependent adults who are vietims of abuse, neglect or exploitation. The proposal would also add a new section to the law to allow legal remedies for the vietim.

The home can no longer be seen as immune to the violence that affects other aspects of American life and the elderly must be added to the list of those affected by vio- lence. This article discusses the prevalence, characteristics, assessment and potential interventions for elder abuse. Elder abuse defined A general definition of elder abuse is acts of commission (abuse) or omission (neglect) that result in harm or threatened harm to the health or welfare of an older adult. The term elder mistreatment is used to define physical, psychological and financial abuse or neglect. This mistreatment can be further divided into intentional or unintentional harm. Inten- tional is the conscious or deliberate intent to inflict harm or injury such as battering; unin- tentional is the inadvertent act resulting in harm caused by ignorance, inexperience, or lack of ability or desire on the part of a care giver. Unintentional mistreatment would also apply to the individual who is self-neglecting because of cognitive or other deficits. It is estimated that between 2% and 5% of the elderly are being mistreated. Using ran- dom sample surveys, Pillemer and Finkelhor demonstrated that 32 of 1,000 older adults were mistreated at least once since reaching age 65 and that there was an annual inci- dence rate of 26 out of 1,000 elderly popula- tion.^ It is further estimated that only 1 in 14 mistreatment cases is reported to public agencies.^ From January of 1983 through December of 1992, 1.7% of lowans 65 and older were reported to the Department of Human Ser- vices as potential abuse victims. In rural counties, the 10-year prevalence report rate was approximately 1%. If only 1 in 14 cases is reported, Iowa’s yearly prevalence rate of mistreatment is 2.4% in non-rural and 1.4% in rural counties. There are many theories on the etiology of elder mistreatment, most of them unsubstan- tiated with good clinical data. Theories include transgenerational violence where the child who is abused grows up to be a spouse abuser, then graduates to be abused as an elder. Psychopathology in the caregiver who suffers from alcohol and drug addiction or emotional problems is another potential source for abuse. ^ Dependency and vulnera- bility of the victim and stress from economic pressures, lack of community support and increased care needs are also cited as poten- tial causes of abuse.^ Since the mistreated elderly may be isolat- ed, the physician caring for this person must screen for potential abuse. Examples of screening questions would be, “Has anyone at home ever hurt you?” “Has anyone taken anything that was yours without asking?” “Are you afraid of anyone at home?” It is important to examine the elderly patient away from the caregiver. Asking screening questions on a regular basis may yield posi- tive answers as rapport is established with the patient. To diagnose and document clinical findings of elder mistreatment requires a comprehen- sive medical examination with documenta- tion of the patient’s statements, behaviors and appearance.^ If possible, obtain pho- tographs of visible physical findings. Tj^pes of mistreatment include physical abuse (push- ing or striking) and sexual assault. As with child abuse, unexplainable physical injuries The IMS Education Fund has designated this article as the Henry Albert Scientific Presentation Award for January 1 996. Gerald Jogerst, MD Dr. Jogerst practices with the University of Iowa Departmen t of Family Practice. Iowa Medicine Volume 86 / 1 January 1996 29 Iowa Medicine Diagnosing and managing elder abuse continued must raise suspicion. Physical neglect can include withholding of adequate meals and failure to provide eye glasses or dentures. The patient may present with dehydration or pressure ulcers. Financial or material abuse include stealing and coercing the elder to sign contracts or change wills. Financial neglect may take the form of failure to use available funds to sustain health or substandard care despite adequate finances. The violation of personal rights is another form of abuse which comes with denial of privacy and the right to make desicions. This may also include forcible placement into a nursing home. Safety is first priority The patient’s safety must be the first con- sideration.^ Is the patient in immediate dan- ger? If safety is a concern, the patient needs to be removed from the environment; in some situations, short-term hospitalization or nursing home placement is the only alterna- tive. If the person is returned to the present environment, are there barriers to further assessment? If the patient is unlikely to return, provisions may need to be made for short-term placement in a controlled envi- ronment. The following case is presented to illus- trate the importance of early detection of abuse to prevent subsequent injury. Louise D. is a 68-year-old who was seen in the office of her local physician starting in November of 1988. The patient had been liv- ing in a board and care facility. On November 21, 1988, the office note indicated “uses a walker, primarily due to residual right-sided hemiparesis.” In June of 1989, there was a no-show appointment; the patient was seen in February of 1990 for a sore of the right leg that wouldn’t heal. The patient was followed up in April of 1990 at which time she had a blood pressure of 182/120 in her left arm. The patient did not show up for two appoint- ments scheduled in May of 1990 but came back to the office in June of 1990 in a wheel- chair. There was a 5 cm irregular, deep, somewhat necrotic ulcer on the back of the calf as well as the heel of the left lower leg. A shallow left anterior leg ulcer was present. The plan was to use Elase with Chloromycetin ointment and it was recom- mended the patient return in one month. This was the last visit to the local physician’s office. Between July 13, 1990 and December 11, 1990 there were eight calls to the physi- cian’s office for refills of medication, four for the Elase with Chloromycetin ointment. The patient was dependent upon the care giver at the board and care facility to come to the office and, over a one-year period, there were three missed appointments and a delay in return for appointments for serious med- ical problems. There was no follow-up after June 20, 1990 for serious pressure ulcers. A pattern of neglect was shown by the caregiver as well as failure of the physician to recognize a neglectful or abusive situation. On December 12, 1990 the patient was seen in the hospital emergency room. The record documents, “foul smell from wounds of buttocks X 3, and left foot, left heel ulcer, to calcaneus.” The patient was admitted to the hospital with a diagnosis of decubitus ulcers, multiple and severe; gangrene, dia- betes, desseminated candidiasis, streptococ- cal septicemia, chronic osteomyelitis left leg, adult maltreatment syndrome, late effects of cerebral vascular disease (left hemiparesis), aphasia and hypertension. The patient under- went debridement of the pressure sores as well as skin graft, large bowel exteriorization and below-the-knee amputation on the left. Pressure ulcers were described as right ischial with exposure of underlying ischial tuberosity externally measuring 10 x 12 cm with subcutaneous tunneling to a second ulcer on the sacrum measuring 18 x 20 cm to the sacral preliganientous structures. There was a left trochanteric 10 x 12 cm pressure ulcer down to the troehanteric prominence. Left ischial ulcer measured 8 cm x 7 cm with no exposure of underlying ischial tuberosity. Cultures were obtained and the patient started on Timentin and Flagyl. Social ser- vices and adult protective service referrals were made and surgical consultation was obtained. The patient’s albumin was 1.6 with a eholesterol of 67, signifying severe malnu- trition. A chest x-ray noted bilateral healed rib fracture deformities and an old healed severe fracture deformity of the right humer- al neck. There is overwhelming evidence of a pat- tern of conduct which resulted in deprivation of services necessary to maintain minimum 30 I ()Wu Medicine Volume 86 /I January 1996 SCIENCE AND EDUCATION physical health in this dependent patient. Negligent behavior before the admission to the hospital caused injury including massive pressure sores which significantly endan- gered her life. Serious injuries may have been avoided if the local physician recognized the clues to abuse and neglect. There was a pat- tern of no-show appointments and the requests for medications to treat pressure ulcers that should have triggered further intervention. Abuse can occur anywhere Physicians need to keep in mind that abuse occurs among men and women of all racial, ethnic and social economic groups. Perpetrators of abuse are often one’s spouse or an adult child. Physical and cognitive impairment, mental illness, alcoholism, and drug abuse in the older person or in the care giver may be associated with mistreatment. ' Other factors are social isolation and depen- 1 dence, past abusive relationships, financial or ' other family problems, inadequate housing or ' unsafe conditions in the home. Victims may I experience several forms of mistreatment. A physician may be the only contact the abuse victim has outside of the home and it is our duty to be alert for signs of mistreatment.

George Santayana (1863-1952) Philosophical writer and essayist At the start of the new year, let us exam- ine one of our society’s most serious problems — violence. In previous issues of Iowa Medicine (January and February 1995) we addressed domestic violence in our society. We must face also the prevalence of violent crime perpetrated by some youth of today. Though statistics show that the over- all crime rates have dropped slightly in America, teenage crime has been rising steadily. Patrick F. Fagan, Fitzgerald Fellow for Family and Cultural Studies at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.G., declared recently that the real root cause of violent crime is the break- down of the family. A study in 1988 of 11,000 indi- viduals found that single parent households with children between the ages of 12 and 20 are associat- ed with higher rates of violent crime and behavior. The same study made it clear that the association of race and crime is false. The absence of a complete family unit increased crime among whites as well as blacks. Increasing percentages of children enter- ing kindergarten have unmarried teenage- mothers. It has been predicted that the rate of illegitimate births will reach 50% in the next 12-20 years. A lack of family cohesive- ness can breed a lack of values which have been the tradition of family life. Conflicts with the parent can lead to violence. Violent families produce violent youth who in turn produce violent communities. The pattern in the development of the future violent criminal; Stage 1: Parental neglect and abandon- ment of the child in early life. Stage 2: The embryonic gang becomes a place to belong. Stage 3: The child joins a delinquent gang. Stage 4: Violent crime and full-fledged criminal gang activity emerge. Stage 5: A new generation of criminals is born as the youngster abandons the girl whom he has impregnated. Rebuilding stable families and communities will not be easy, avers Fagen. He outlines four sim- ple principles for affirmative action: 1) marriage is vital; 2) parents must love and nurture their children physically and spir- itually; 3) children must be taught how to relate to each oth- er; and 4) the backbone of strong communi- ties is friendship and cooperation among families. For the sake of our children, our own lives, our communities and our nation, let us resolve for the new year to rebuild the family structure. D3 The absence of a complete family unit increased crime among whites as well as blacks.

A problem: is my challenge quantitative (“too much,” “too little”) or qualitative (“incorrect,” “use- less”)? Years ago I tried to establish the souree of the notion that “medical information has a half-life of five (or seven) years.” I centered on J. Robert Oppenheimer, who made that sort of unattributed comment regarding atomic physics. How the metaphor beeame a frequently repeated shibboleth of medical education I could never learn. I believe it’s an unverifiable falsehood, since so much of daily practice uses long-established knowl- edge and skills. Of course there are loads of new information, some of it even true. The dilemma is to sift through it for the applicable nug- gets. We are deluged with journal- istic hype, the current advances in information technology, the entre- preneurial spirit of egotistical and acquisitive folk who labor in the arenas of elinical pharmacology, surgical techniques and even basic scientific laboratories. A simultaneous boon and curse have been laid upon us by such technological pioneers as Johannes Guttenberg, Alexander Graham Bell or Bill Gates. Thoreau said, “I hear a telegraph now permits Maine to speak to Texas, but it may be that Maine has nothing to say to Texas.” T.S. Eliot has phrased the challenge this way: “Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge?AVhere is the knowl- edge we have lost in information?” The skills of information retrieval are now a formal part of the U of Iowa’s new curricu- lum for medical freshman. Finding truth and quality in a tidal wave is mighty tough. Socrates tried to teach his students to find truth through reasoning, a technique still exceedingly valuable. To experimentally veri- fy hj'potheses by repetition and accurate pre- dietion works just fine to test Newton’s equa- tion for acceleration by rolling steel marbles down an inclined plane. But to replicate clin- ical studies to attain a convincing demonstra- tion, for example, about the efficacy of vari- ous treatments for a Stage I prostate cancer in a 70-year-old- man — that’s quite a differently colored horse. Even if the statisti- eal story were unassailable, the patient and his doetor must still make deeisions that depend great- ly on unquantifiable value judge- ments. The information revolution is a marvel to behold. But it doesn’t answer the ancient philosophical conundrums. Socrates and his intellectual lineage have always urged the search for truth and wisdom, yet Socrates declaimed against writing, fearing it would produce atrophy of memory. We’ve made it over that hurdle, but (to mix my metaphor) only to enter a different frying pan. ESI Of course there are loads of new information, some of it even true.
