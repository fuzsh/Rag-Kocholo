        "text": "Sometimes, it’s not the player with the best serve, the best forehand, the best backhand or the best movement who wins. How? I was talking recently with Caroline Garcia and Borja Duran on the Tennis Insider Club podcast about a key milestone in my career. I was coaching Marcos Baghdatis in a Challenger in November 2004, early on in his career. He went to the final, and was up against the world No 14, Dominik Hrbaty, playing at home. At the time, he was ranked around No 200 in the world. His opponent, a former French Open semi-finalist, was better than him in all aspects. Hrbaty also got off to a better start, gaining a double break early in the first set. I thought to myself: this is going to be tough. And yet, Marcos ended up winning. That day, I was a very bad coach because I didn't believe enough in my player. Marcos found a way; he wanted it more, and believed in himself, even when I didn’t. The only explanation was his competitive edge. He taught me a lesson I’ll never forget: that anything is possible on a tennis court. This was the same thing that caught my eye when I first saw Stefanos Tsitsipas play on YouTube as a 16-year-old. Sure, he hit the ball fantastic, but Stefanos’ standout feature was how competitive he was. He had that deep desire to win, and belief that it was possible. This asset is not called forehand, or serve, not even mental or physical: it's called competitiveness. It's the ability to find a way to win the point, win the game, the set, the match, even if you are not necessarily stronger than your opponent. Like all qualities, you can develop and work on it, but the ones who have it naturally have huge potential. As I shared with Caroline and Borja, Roger Federer recently shared a crazy stat in a commencement speech at Dartmouth University: even the greatest players in the world only win between 52 and 54 percent of points in their careers. The winner of a tennis match often comes down to one or two key points that shift momentum. Players that are fiercely competitive find a way to be the ones who win these points. #PatrickMouratoglou #tenniscompetitor #playeranalysis #tennis #sport\n\nAll bets were on the pro tennis player and his partner to win their Celebrity Shootout match during the National Pickleball Championships this past week in the Dallas area. Since the event was at my racket club, I watched the match between these two teams: top-ranked mixed doubles pickleball player Ben Johns and former top-ranked U.S. tennis pro John Isner vs. top-ranked mixed-doubles pickleball player Anna Leigh Waters (Ben’s partner) and top-ranked PGA golfer Scottie Scheffler. It was a major upset: the pro golfer and female pickleball pro whipped the pro tennis player and the male pickleball pro. What happened? In this match, Isner made way too many mistakes because he was playing tennis on a pickleball court. At one point, his pickleball pro partner jokingly asked him to go stand off the court to give them a better chance. As a tennis player who has tried pickleball, I can relate. It’s hard to resist using your grooved tennis strokes to try to power the ball over the net in pickleball, but that isn’t a winning strategy. Golf pro Scheffler didn’t have to fight old habits to learn how to play pickleball, so he executed pickleball strategies and shots amazingly well. The same is true in business. When there’s a disrupter in your industry, it isn’t an advantage to stick with what you’ve always done before. In fact, it’s probably a big disadvantage, but most of us aren’t comfortable with making changes. How do you approach adopting new strategies to address changing factors? #pickleball #business #success #influence #change #disruption #melindamarcus\n\n𝗥𝗼𝗴𝗲𝗿 𝗙𝗲𝗱𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗿’𝘀 𝗜𝗻𝘀𝗽𝗶𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗦𝗽𝗲𝗲𝗰𝗵 𝗮𝘁 𝗗𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗺𝗼𝘂𝘁𝗵 𝗖𝗼𝗹𝗹𝗲𝗴𝗲 Tennis legend Roger Federer was awarded an honorary doctorate at Dartmouth College in the US, where he delivered an unforgettable commencement speech filled with inspiring life lessons. 𝗘𝗳𝗳𝗼𝗿𝘁𝗹𝗲𝘀𝘀 𝗶𝘀 𝗮 𝗠𝘆𝘁𝗵 He debunked the myth of \"effortless\" success, emphasizing that his achievements were not solely due to talent but also years of hard work and perseverance. Federer shared that making things look easy but took immense effort, including years of frustration and struggle before mastering his composure on the court. One key lesson Federer imparted was, 𝐼𝑡’𝑠 𝑜𝑛𝑙𝑦 𝑎 𝑝𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡. He illustrated this by reflecting on his loss to Rafael Nadal at the Wimbledon 2008 finals, reminding graduates that despite hard work, setbacks are inevitable, and resilience is crucial. Federer highlighted that even after losing his number-one ranking, he knew the importance of continuing to work hard and compete. Federer’s final lesson, 𝗟𝗶𝗳𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗯𝗶𝗴𝗴𝗲𝗿 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝘂𝗿𝘁, urged students to embrace a balanced life. He recounted how his life was enriched by travel, culture, friendships, and family, beyond his achievements in tennis. Emphasizing the importance of staying grounded and true to one’s roots, Federer spoke of his love for travel, not only for leisure but also for philanthropic endeavors, showing that the world extends far beyond any single pursuit. As we reflect on Federer's words, may we find inspiration to embrace life's challenges with grace and determination, knowing that greatness is not achieved overnight but through steadfast effort and unfaltering resolve..!! https://lnkd.in/dc7QCqDf #inspiration #life #effort #resilience #perseverance\n\n\"Even top-ranked players win barely more than half of the points they play\" - I will always remember watching Roger Federer play at the Australian Open. I was in awe of his gobsmacking talent - it was like watching ballet on the court. In his career he played 1526 single matches. He won almost 80% of those matches. But, he only won 54% of the points in those matches. He learnt not to dwell on on every shot - when the point is behind you, it's behind you. \"Negative energy is wasted energy\" His point is to keep moving forward with intention, clarity and focus. It's a valuable mindset we can bring to the workplace - not to dwell or ruminate on what happened, but to keep moving forward. Does this resonate? Where can you use this mindset in the week ahead? #WorkplaceWisdom #mindset #HR #Peopleandculture https://lnkd.in/gPAZzvX4\n\nA must watch! 👀 🎾 👨🏼🎓 tennis is a huge passion of mine - and Roger Federer's commencement speech at Dartmouth encapsulates why I think it's one of the best sports for a founder to play. 🏆 Roger won 82% of his matches: (1251 - 275) ❌ BUT.. he only won 54% of the points. Yes(!) - one of the greatest tennis players in history barely won half the points he played, and most players do not have that W/L ratio! Here are some examples: Serena Williams: 86%(!) Novak Djokovic: 83% Rafael Nadal: 82% Andy Murray: 77% Pete Sampras: 77% Andre Agassi: 76% Alexander Zverev: 69% Stan Wawrinka: 61% And what about a top 20 tennis player like Taylor Fritz? 56%. 🤯 🔑 The key was that he won the points that mattered. How? His MINDSET. Here are three key points from the speech: 🧮 A point is only a point: In that specific moment, the point you're playing is the most important thing in the world, but win or lose, once it's done that point is behind you. No time to dwell on it. Negative energy is WASTED energy. 🏃🏼♂️➡️ Effortless is a Myth: A lot of hard work goes into making hard things look easy. There is no such thing as perfection, but the easier you make things look, the more you'll hear the word 'effortless'. 🌏 Life is bigger than the court: Tennis was Roger Federer's life until he realised there was a whole world beyond it. It's important to expand your horizons. Founders, like tennis players, have to be resilient. They're obsessive and tenacious. They work unbelievably hard in a field that is unforgiving and at times can feel very unrewarding. But we come back day after day because we know we can always be better and strive for greatness. It's important to keep your mindset positive and focussed on the things that matter. There will always be another point to play and win - losing one point doesn't mean you've lost the match. An amazing speech in full, this 2 minute snippet gives you a quick teaser to see why:\n\nThis insightful article elicits the financial adversities encountered by professional tennis players, unearthing numerous realities inherent to the sport. Still, it seemingly dismisses the pivotal reason why just 18% of tennis revenues end up in the players' pockets. While tennis as a sport is not owned by the players, the magnetism of these athletes draws a fervent fan base. This loyal following is the driving force behind the $3 billion revenue flowing into tennis. Yet, these spectators pay their cash for the sheer delight of watching the athletes perform, not to line the pockets of the commercial entities or federations controlling the tournaments. This set-up, aimed at achieving maximum profits, rewards players merely with enough earnings that are needed to ensure their appearance in the tournaments. This results in a disproportionate amount of wealth being accumulated by the top-tier players, thereby exacerbating the issue of lower pay for those outside the top 50. It's almost unfathomable that a top 200 tennis player is generating only about $100K in income. Comparatively, a top 200 footballer is typically playing for one of the top ten clubs, earning millions and basking in the glory of being at the top echelon of their sport. On the other hand, a top 200 tennis player endures a challenging life on the tour, operating on a much more constrained budget. This disparity is particularly absurd, considering that tennis garners the support of an astonishing 1.2 billion fans globally and brings in $3 billion of revenues. Tennis stands as the fourth most-watched sport in terms of fan numbers worldwide, and this striking contrast serves as a stark reminder of the profound inconsistencies within the pay structures of different professional sports. Personally, I question whether Saudi investment will dramatically adjust the financial framework within professional tennis. A significant shift appears plausible only when the professional players themselves possess ownership of the sport, much like the structures in place in the Premier League or the NBA.\n\nMaster class in winning……………. Alcaraz beats the mighty Djokovic, who has won Wimbledon seven times and that is one less than Roger Federer. No wonder he was gutted. That’s it the two weeks of tennis are over and most of us will stop going to the park. Whether it’s because we can’t get in like Karim Doukir - Corporate Training Fresh Prince Style or whether it’s the weather or maybe a slow realisation that this sport is so difficult……………… If you want to learn tennis, golf or any other sport, get a coach. It ensures that you learn the basics correctly and then you can build on a solid base. If you are in business, get a coach. The same benefits can be applied, build a solid base and then start to expand. I meet so many people who are in the process of building a business, but often have to take a step backwards to build a foundation before being able to move forward. BUT - make sure you get the right coach for you. Its an investment, not a cost and with New Level Results Limited you can measure your return on investment (‘RoI’) with the help of their award-winning software. #Businessowners #Womeninbusiness #Growthmindset #Coach DM me to find out more.\n\nThought for the Week – Bridging the Gap Between Ordinary and Extraordinary It’s Wimbledon season, a time when even those of us who aren’t tennis fans will take a peek at how the world’s best racket wielders are doing at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club. If you’re all-in on the Wimbledon experience and reside in the US, you can tune-in live on Saturday morning and have a bowl of strawberries and cream (a Wimbledon thing) for breakfast while watching the fun. Does anyone know if there is a croquet equivalent to the Wimbledon tennis tournament? My old friend Steve Warnstadt recently shared something with me that was extraordinary. A little background first. Steve and I served together in the US Army over three decades ago. He is one of those guys who can offer philosophical-level logic under the most chaotic circumstances, like combat. His observations often had a calming effect when things were anything but. Steve shared something on LinkedIn about advice that Roger Federer (ah, there’s the Wimbledon tie-in) gave the graduating class at Dartmouth. If anyone else had commented about a tennis champion speaking at a college commencement, I wouldn’t have given it a second, but this came from Steve. Federer won twenty Grand Slams and eight Wimbledon men’s singles titles during his career. He achieved the remarkable feat of winning nearly 80% of his career matches. However, Steve pointed out that he only won 54% of his points. In Federer’s case, the difference between ordinary and extraordinary is slightly better than a coin toss. Steve concluded that “some combination of fortune and persistence” made all the difference for Federer and it does the same for us. Federer savored the wins only long enough to return his attention to the next task. And as Steve and Mr. Federer point out, the same goes for the failures: learn from them and move on. Even one of the greatest players in tennis lost 46% of his points. As you encounter setbacks, learn and lean forward into the next task. When you have wins, celebrate, but don’t linger too long. I hope you have a great week! #professionaldevelopment #personaldevelopment #b2bsales"
