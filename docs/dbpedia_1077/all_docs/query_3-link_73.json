Creation Platform wars The latest handset! Technology arguments Millions of users “Will this work? Who will win?” Deployment The big winners are clear Steady, incremental improvement Commodity technology (mostly) Billions of users “What can we build with his?” As we pass 2.5bn smartphones in use, the issues that matter are changing\n\n7. 7 “What can we build with this?” A new kind of scale for technology, and new kinds of computer. New ways to change other industries. Two of those industries: ecommerce & cars.\n\n8. A new kind of scale\n\n9. 9 0 100 200 300 400 500 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 Annual revenue ($bn, real terms) Wintel GAFA Changing of the guard Google, Apple, Facebook & Amazon (GAFA) are 3x the scale of Wintel Source: Bloomberg, a16z\n\n10. 10 The Wintel explosion in 1990s – 14x growth The golden age for Intel and Microsoft saw 14x revenue growth and dominance of tech Source: Bloomberg, a16z 0 10 20 30 40 50 1990 1995 2000 Wintel annual revenue ($bn, real terms)\n\n11. 11 … But GAFA has 10x the scale Fundamental change in what it means to be a leading tech company Source: Bloomberg, a16z 0 100 200 300 400 500 1990 / 2005 1995 / 2010 2000 / 2015 Annual revenue ($bn, real terms) Wintel 1990-2000 GAFA 2005-2015\n\n12. 12 From important to dominant When tech was scared of Microsoft, it was a pretty small company Source: Bloomberg, a16z GAFA Wintel All other 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 1995 2016 Top 20 US listed companies by market cap (indexed) GAFA Wintel All other\n\n13. 13 That scale means much more investment Annual capex has increased from $1bn to $34bn since 2000 Source: Bloomberg, a16z 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Annual capex ($bn real) Amazon Facebook Apple Google Microsoft\n\n14. 14 And 10x more people (Though this chart includes a lot of warehouse and retail staff) Source: Bloomberg 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Permanent employees (000) Amazon Facebook Apple Google Microsoft\n\n15. 15 Today’s tech giants have a totally different character of scale to Wintel or IBM before them. Giants in the economy, not just in tech. And (at least) four competing giants, not one.\n\n16. 16 So Apple is a global top 10 retailer 500 stores, ~$25bn revenue make it a top 20 retailer. $53bn including the online store… Making Apple the 10th largest global retailer by revenue. Not bad for a marketing operation. Retail ran at 12% of revenue before Apple stopped disclosing it: direct is 25%.

Combined, they’re 16% of US production budgets Source: IHS\n\n18. 18 Is Netflix a threat? “Is the Albanian army going to take over the world?” - Jeffery Bewkes, CEO Time Warner, 2010\n\n19. 19 Making your own chips: Intel’s whole business becomes a side-project. Google: ‘TPU’ machine learning FPGA. Amazon: ‘Annapurna’ networking ASIC. Apple: A10 is the fastest mobile SoC – plus custom chips for TouchID, Airpods, etc.\n\n20. 20 Scale of 5bn mobile users Vast supply chain of commoditised components & platforms Scale of the winners GAFA have much greater global scale than Wintel or IBM ever had New ways to compete Custom hardware Retail & distribution Content (Cars) Building on scale Huge companies building on an ecosystem that commoditises almost everything before\n\n21. In the mean time, the new thing – machine learning\n\n22. 22 “Is there a dog in this picture?” After 50 years of work, computer vision systems got this right 72% of the time. A whole class of similar problems – easy for people and hard/impossible for computers. Consensus: decades more work. Then, in 2013, machine learning. Source: Imagenet\n\n23. 23 The arrival of machine learning Performance on decades-old challenges has been transformed Image recognition Speech recognition 28% error rate 7% 26% error rate 4%\n\n24. 24 Machine learning: data instead of rules Fundamental shift in AI from trying to codify perception to massive data and applied maths Old: rules Build systems to look for ears, noses, legs, fur… Hire linguists and write grammar rules. Try to codify how human intelligence works (though we don’t really know). Machine learning: data 10k pictures labelled ‘dog’ and 10k labelled ‘no dog’, and let a neural network work it out. Learning rather than rules. Possible now because we have ~1m times more computing & data.\n\n25. 25 “Every time I fire a linguist, the performance of the speech recognizer goes up.” - Frederick Jelinek\n\n26. 26 Since we’re analysing data, not looking for dogs, this works for many other data sets. “Which customers are about to churn?” “Will that car let me merge?” “Is anything weird happening on the network?”\n\n27. 27 Alpha Go – board games and air-con Google took the machine learning platform that won Go and applied it to data center cooling. Achieved a 15% energy saving. Building systems that find patterns in data.\n\n28. 28 “We will move from mobile-first to AI-first.” - Sundar Pichai, 2016\n\n29. 29 Data New analysis on almost any data set Interaction Images, voice, devices, new UX models Images ML can read images as easily as text? Surprises Things that don’t look like ML use cases ML use cases: how many patterns, how much data? Things that only people could do, but at a scale that people could never do\n\n30. 30 At the top and bottom of the stack Training models at vast scale in the cloud… But once trained, many models could run on very small/cheap devices. A $10 widget could run on a cheap DSP with a commodity camera, looking for just one thing – people, leaks, cars…\n\n31. 31 0.0 2.5 5.0 7.5 10.0 12.5 2014 2015 2016e 2017e Global image sensing market size ($bn) Other Cars PC & Tablet Camera Mobile Cameras in everything, except in cameras Imaging, combined with machine learning, may be becoming a universal sensor Source: Sony\n\n32. 32 What does it mean if computers can read images in the way they’ve always been able to read text?\n\n33. 33 Complexity and abstraction Arms race of science, engineering and product – a new front for GAFA competition Surge in complexity Building the engineering on top of the science ‘How to build the right ML for this problem’ is becoming a new CS field Even as the science still has far to go Rush to abstraction Google, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, etc. rushing to build ML platforms in the cloud Core, cutting-edge ML tech available to rent\n\n34. 34 The machine learning S-Curve Still in the very early days of creation, with lots and lots of low-hanging fruit Creation Deployment Crazy idea Scaling Frenzy Maturity Machine Learning\n\n36. 36 0 200 400 600 800 1,000 1,200 1,400 1,600 Jun-13 Jun-14 Jun-15 Jun-16 Billion minutes online, USA Mobile browser Mobile app Desktop Obvious but boring: apps have won mobile Smartphone apps are now close to 60% of all time spent online in the USA Source: Comscore\n\n37. 37 0 200 400 600 800 1,000 1,200 1,400 1,600 Jun-13 Jun-14 Jun-15 Jun-16 Billion minutes online, USA Mobile browser Facebook app Mobile app Desktop … with increasing concentration Facebook has 15-20% of mobile time (making it the largest mobile web browser) Source: Comscore, a16z\n\n38. 38 More important: a new generation of computing After 30 years, we shift to a new and more sophisticated kind of computer Intensely personal Always with you Imaging as primary input Touch, tilt, location, microphone App stores Ignore battery & bandwidth 1000x faster Cloud & machine learning And yet much easier to use…\n\n39. 39 Both more sophisticated and easier to use New sensors, inputs and interfaces New creation: live, social, broadcast, touch, imaging New computing model…\n\n40. 40 Both more sophisticated and easier to use New sensors, inputs and interfaces, machine learning New creation: live, social, broadcast, touch, imaging New computing model, and new creation models Leave the PC behind, presume mobile-only and mobile-native, not mobile-first\n\n41. 41 How many old assumptions does live video break? Assume high quality camera, fast CPU/GPU for encoding and effects, touch, always on, always in your pocket. Assume unlimited bandwidth & battery. Assume 1bn high-end smartphones on earth - there can be 50 companies trying this. And turn the whole phone into the camera. Source: Houseparty, Yixia\n\n42. 42 Direct interaction - unbundling the app from the phone No buttons, apps or intermediate steps – just use it. Hardware sensors as unbundled apps - deep links within apps. Apps moved to a new context. And of course all built with commodity components from the smartphone supply chain.\n\n43. 43 Sensors Smartphone, or cheap smartphone components Machine learning Speech recognition, computer vision Action Lighting everything up with machine learning Smartphone supply chain enables this – machine learning makes it useful\n\n44. 44 Sensor Commodity smartphone components Machine learning Speech recognition, computer vision Action (If the machine can answer) Still need to narrow the domain to things you can actually do, and tell your users “I’m sorry Dave…”\n\n45. 45 Changing friction and changing choices Massive proliferation of UX models. All about removing friction. And choices… Removing questions and friction Do you have the printer driver? What’s your password? Where did you save that file? … What soap do you want to buy? With which app? But also choices Questions are also choices Huge strategic incentive for big platforms to be the ones to answer the question for you “Who owns the customer?”\n\n46. 46 A computer should “never ask the user for any information that it can auto-detect, copy, or deduce.” - Eric Raymond\n\n47. 47 From direct, physical interaction with data… Source: IBM47\n\n48. 48 To direct, physical interaction with data Source: Magic Leap48\n\n49. Ecommerce\n\n50. 50 Retailers as newspapers “History doesn’t repeat, but sometimes it rhymes” Fixed cost base with falling revenue. Shift from paid to freemium, unbundling, different skills. The distribution advantage moves. New medium means different consumption – you buy different things, not just in different places.\n\n51. 51 Break up old bundles and aggregators New aggregators emerge And they shape consumption in different ways Everything the internet did to media will happen to retail\n\n52. 52 So far, mostly, what you already know you want Ecommerce is much better at logistics than demand generation *Ex. food service, gasoline, auto.

Amazon is Google for products, but we don’t have a Facebook or Buzzfeed – we don’t have suggestion and discovery. The internet lets you buy, but it doesn’t let you shop.\n\n55. 55 Digital demand generation: step 1 $500bn spent annually on ads (a third on digital) – and another $500bn on marketing Source: Zenith, Google, a16z 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 Global ad spending ($bn, real terms) Other internet Google Print Other TV\n\n56. 56 “Your margin is my opportunity” - Jeff Bezos (So what is advertising?)\n\n57. 57 The channel is the product Soap as a Service. New purchasing journeys mean new kinds of decisions. If you change how things are bought, you change what gets bought.\n\n58. 58 Train your AI on 10 years of Elle / Dwell / NYT Recipes Take a photo of your outfit / living room / kitchen counter “What would I like that I’ve never seen?” Scalable curation Scaling curation with machine learning? When can we infer taste and preference, without a purchase history or a salesperson?\n\n59. 59 Data works its way through retailing Data has affected every part of retail except demand itself, so far ERP 1990s Supply chain & logistics Digital metrics 2000s Advertising Data Social Machine learning 2010s Demand\n\n60. 60 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015 Annual revenue ($bn, real terms) Amazon Walmart Retail S Curves Walmart used new technologies to change retail – the same will happen again Source: Amazon, Bloomberg\n\n61. 61 Sectors up-ended by software so far… Source: a16z 0 200 400 600 800 1,000 1,200 1,400 Car sales Advertising Consumer Media Mobile phones Pay TV Online advertising TV production Global revenue, 2015 ($bn)\n\n62. 62 And in the future Source: a16z 0 5,000 10,000 15,000 20,000 25,000 Retail Car sales Advertising Consumer Media Mobile phones Pay TV Online advertising Global revenue, 2015 ($bn)\n\n63. Cars\n\n64. 64 Cars as phones “History doesn’t repeat, but sometimes it rhymes” Today’s tech moat disappears. Key components become commodities. Value moves to software. Network effects move away from hardware. ‘Phone’ means something totally different.\n\n65. 65 Two paths for disrupting cars Electric Happening right now. Removing the engine & transmission destabilizes the car industry and its suppliers. Doesn’t change how cars are used (much). Autonomy 5-10 years? Longer? Many challenges to resolve. Changes where the value is. Accelerates on-demand. Changes what cars are. Changes cities as much as cars changed cities. The growth of electric and autonomy are both, separately, changing what cars are\n\n66. 66 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 0 200 400 600 800 1,000 1,200 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Lithium-ion battery economics Battery $/KwH Energy Density (watt hours/litre) Going electric: riding the battery cost curve Growth of electric cars is a function of battery economics starting to work Source: US Department of Energy\n\n67. 67 Electric unbundles cars Radical simplification Complex, proprietary gasoline engines & transmissions disappear Replaced by simple, commodity batteries & motors 10x fewer moving parts Whole basis of competition changes New bases for competition Scale, design, distribution remain, for those who can navigate the change But value moves to software - entirely new skill set And then with autonomy, new layers of value built on top Electric makes cars much simpler and turns many elements into commodities\n\n68. 68 Precedent – unbundling phones Once, you had to have co-invented GSM to make phones. Now, all components unbundled 2001, Nokia “Manufacturing is a core competency & competitive advantage” 75% of Nokia phones made in 8 Nokia factories 2016, Apple The iPhone has 189 suppliers with 789 locations None owned by Apple\n\n69. 69 (Unfair but relevant – capex scale) Leading tech companies now spend as much on capex as car OEMs Apple has $237bn gross cash, while Google has $73bn Source: Bloomberg 0.0 2.5 5.0 7.5 10.0 12.5 15.0 VW Apple Toyota Google Daimler GM Ford BMW Honda Nissan Tesla 2015 capex ($bn)\n\n70. 70 Meanwhile, progress to autonomy Steady, incremental progress, solving one tech challenge at a time Old-fashioned cruise control Smart cruise control & lane keeping Automatic, but driver needs to be ready to take over Driver only needed in exceptions, bad weather etc No controls, no driver, no cabin 1958 Now 5-10 years? Source: VDA, a16z 1 2 3 4 5 Level Level\n\n71. 71 Physical scale Electric changes barriers to entry… But bashing metal is still about scale Data network effects Driving behaviour data to feed ML HD 3D maps How many winners? On-demand network effects Virtuous circle: density of cars + density of riders Uber + Lyft Where is the competitive moat in cars? Once batteries and sensors are commodities, where are the strategic levers?
