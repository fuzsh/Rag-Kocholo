        "text": "The air was full of humidity and the skies were overcast as we headed into our final day in Siouxland. Our first school visit on Thursday, March 29th took us to Sioux City West High School. Here we were greeted by local leade r Leslie Dake. Leslie is an association leader in Sioux City Educational Support Professional's Association (SCESPA) and a member of ISEA-PAC Central Committee. Leslie is a Bookeeper and Prom & Graduation Secretary here at West High.\n\nWe were first whisked off to one of the school's gyms where long-time association leader, Math teacher and Dance team coach Julie DeGroot was holding practice with her team. Julie has led the dance squads at West High for the last 34 years!\n\nJulie shared she has 100 students involved in her dance squads. Her teams annually compete in state competition and every other year compete at the national level. This year her squads placed in nine events--bringing home eight first place awards and one second place award.\n\nThe most touching part of our conversation was when Julie shared the stor y of Marcus Williams. Marcus (surrounded by a new set of \"fans\") is like too many of our students--having more challenges in his personal life then any young person should have in a full-life. One area of Marcus' challenges was his struggle with some areas of academics, but found the dance squad was a true passion. It was his involvement on the Dance Squad that motivated him to stay in school. And as we know, there is no \"bubble test\" that checks for understanding for activities such as the Dance Squad. Both Wanda Synhorst, retired Council Bluffs EA leader and Donna Walsh, Sioux City EA president were moved to give generous contributions towards the cost of Marcus' \"bill\" for Dance Squad so he can continue his part-time job to pay off the bill and graduate this spring.\n\nAlso joining us in the gym before the first bell to mark the start of the school day was Amy DeGroot, Julie's daughter. Amy is a Counselor here at West High and joins her mother as a Dance Squad coach.\n\nWe next had a few minutes to relax in a conference room to enjoy Leslie's homemade coffee cake and coffee. Stopping by before heading to class was Jody Kennedy (pictured at left). Jody is a Math teacher--teaching Algebra, Geometry II, and Consumer Math. Amy also finds time to be an assistant Dance Squad coach. She shared how she is a graduate of West High and was a member of Amy DeGroot's Dance Squad in her high school years.\n\nWe next had the chance to stop by classrooms and greet some local leaders. Steve McHugh is a Math teacher here at West High, Treasurer of the Sioux City Education Association and a veteran of the War in Iraq. It was a treat to get to thank Steve personally for his service to our country as well as stepping up to take a leadership role in the SCEA!\n\nWe had the chance to stop by the classroom of West High Math teacher Ron Colling. Ron and his wife Katie are long-time friends. Ron continues to volunteer as a member of the Sioux City EA Negotiations team. It was great to see Ron again!\n\nOur tour of West High ended in the school's Media Center. The murals (below) depict the regional Siouxland history. These photos really don't do justice to the beautiful work.\n\nIn the school's Media Center we met Director and teacher-Librarian Shelley Sweeney. Shelley (pictured with white sweater) shared how this is her 3rd year as a member of the West High staff. She shared just a few of the many activities that take place here in the Media Center.\n\nJan Fridley, Media Center Secretary and past president of SCESPA, joins her colleague Leslie Dake for a photo. Jan was generous with her praise for the work of Shelley Sweeney in increasing usage in the school's Media Center. Jan said that usage has increased ten-fold under Shelley's leadership. I think this team of Shelley and Jan is a great example in continuing to find ways to meet the ongoing needs of students and staff!\n\nThanks Leslie Dake for your continued great leadership on behalf of students and the association. Thanks, West High for your warm hospitality! You do indeed have great things going on!\n\nAfter a full day in the classroom, Siouxland UniServ leaders joined us for a relaxing meal at Minervas in Sioux City.\n\nSiouxland Team ISEA leaders gathered (left side of table-front to back) are Brenda Zahner, Sgt. Bluff-Luton 5th grade teacher and local president; Bruce Lear, Siouxland UniServ Director; Donna Walsh, Sioux City EA president and 2nd grade teacher at Hawthorne Elementary; Leslie Dake, SCESPA UniServ Rep and Book Keeper at Sioux City West High School; Wanda Synhorst, my guest for the week; and Julie DeGroot, Math teacher at Sioux City West High School.\n\nOn the right side of the table (front to back) Jan Olson, ISEA Executive Rep from Siouxland, Counselor at Sioux City East High and Mentor trainer; myself; Diane Cox, English Language Learner teacher at Sioux City North High School; Vince Cox, Math teacher at Sioux City East High School; and Gayle Jeffers, NEA Board of Directors and French teacher at Sioux City East High School.\n\nThese are some of my very favorite people in all ISEA! Dedicated professionals that have a passion for providing challenging opportunities for Iowa's students in helping them discover success! Thanks Siouxland leaders--you exemplify the \"team\" in Team ISEA!\n\nAfter visits to Western Iowa Tech Community College, three buildings in Sgt. Bluff-Luton, (don't forget lunch), a stop at Hinton Community Schools on Wednesday, March 28th our day was still not complete. UniServ Director Bruce Lear always does an awesome job of having opportunities to sit down with the local media. Here I'm getting ready to head to my interview with the Sioux City Journal.\n\nRight outside the entrance to the Journal's office is a statue of Seaman. Seaman was explorers Lewis & Clark's dog. A few years back local artist painted the Seaman likeness and this little guy looks just like he is ready to take on the role of a newspaper reporter. Pictured with Newspaper Seaman is Sioux City EA president and 2nd grade teacher at Hawthorne Elementary Donna Walsh. Having Donna along on Wednesday and Thursday gave her the opportunity to connect with members throughout the district.\n\nConducting the interview was reporter Jenny Welp. I'm pictured in one of the conference rooms at the Sioux City Journal with Jenny. I had the chance to applaud the efforts of local legislative leaders Rep. Roger Wendt and Senator Steve Warnstadt for their work on raising Iowa's teacher's salaries. I told Jenny, \"It is a new day for public education, with a majority party that really does stand up for kids and public education.\"\n\nWednesday morning, March 28th, brought us to the Sioux City campus of Western Iowa Tech Community College. Bursting through the doors to welcome me with open arms was Helen Lewis. Helen (pictured at left) is a Humanities instructor at WIT and the WIT rep on ISEA's Higher Education standing committee. Helen did an awesome job of notifying members to visit over coffee the first two hours of our day.\n\nPenny Schempp (at right) is a Counselor at WIT. Penny shared with me her responsibilities include both personal and career counseling.\n\nA welcome face to stop by was that of Donnin Custer. Donnin (at left) is vice president of the association and a member of the Negotiations team. I first met Donnin on my first visit to WIT two years ago and got to see him work his magic--standing before his Electronics classroom and leading instruction!\n\nAlso able to join us was Bea Houston. Bea is an instructor for Spanish. She shared her excitement for her upcoming trip to Spain this summer where she will complete work on another Master's degree.\n\nDr. Pat Simmons (at left) an adult Reading instructor for those with special challenges shared how every student is given a test to check for reading and math skill level as they enter WIT. Dr. Simmons heads the program for providing developmental education.\n\nThe final WIT HEEA member to stop by for conversation was president of the association Brian Smith. Brian (seated at right) is an instructor for Cyber Crime Investigations. Isn't it exciting to know that our Iowa Community Colleges continue to provide the most up-to-date curriculum to meet the needs of Iowans?!\n\nThanks Team ISEA leaders at Western Iowa Tech Community College for your continued leadership in the classroom and in the association!"
