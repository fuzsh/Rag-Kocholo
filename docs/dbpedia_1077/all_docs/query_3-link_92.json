January, 1997 IMS DEADLINE news Late-breaking news of interest to Iowa physicians • PHYSICl^ OFFICES 33J IONA are being inundated with calls from patients as the effective date of Iowa's new handicapped parking law approaches. Physician offices should inform patients who need handicapped parking permits that they have until January 1, 1998 to get the new permits. Even though it officially goes into effect January 1, 1997, the new law provides a one-year phase in of the new permits. For more information on the new require- ments, see page 12 of this issue of Iowa Medicine or check the IMS web site at http: 7/www. IowaMedicalSociety.org. •AS OF PraiSS TIME, several organizations had filed a lawsuit to delay implementation of the new parental notification of abortion law, which is scheduled to go into effect January 1, 1997. The law will affect any physician who provides pregnancy-related services to a pregnant minor, whether or not an abortion is contemplated. The lawsuit claims the law is unconstitutionally vague and will violate the rights of the pregnant minor. A hearing is scheduled for January 2 and a decision on the request for a temporary delay in implementa- tion of the law is expected within a few days. IMS members will be notified of the results of this hearing. See page 12 of this Iowa Medicine for more information on the law. •TIE IOWA FOUNDATION FOR MEDICAL CARE (IFMC) recently approved a plan for restructur- ing. The new plan — approved unanimously - decreases the number of directors from 40 to 18 while continuing representation for all Iowa physician members. Ten of the 18 positions are to be held by Iowa IFMC physician members, a voting majority. A letter detailing all bylaw amendments was recently sent to all IFMC physician members. The amendments will go into effect imless petitions signed by at least 10% of the members of record are received requesting a full membership vote. •'HE IMS WES SITE is up and luinning at http://www.IowaMedicalSociety.org.

Society is demanding cheaper, more “successful” means of delivering care. Technical advances coupled !| with problems such as drug resistant TB and drug use by teenagers challenge the most earefully crafted professional guidelines. ! Methods of compensation under managed M care may destroy traditional incentives and certainly test our ethics. Is it enough for physicians to fall back on [ I, venerable answers such as “do no harm, patient confidentiality and patient welfare above self”? I believe we need the collective wisdom of our profession to plot a course true to the core values that elevate our calling. 1 think it is time to call upon our best navigators to chart that course. In sailing we know the best way to find the next mark is to follow the leader, but who is that? I believe that each of us I has met that leader and “It is us”. With the right tools, I enough time and a kind of compassionate tenaeity, any Ij of our 4,000 member Iphysieians could be the leader we would trust and follow. If you feel you lack leadership potential, you can help by simply lending your perspective when the IMS determines its future direction. When I first entered medieal politics I hoped to make a difference, maybe right some wrongs. I learned that my straight- forward answers sometimes got lost in the process and politics. I also learned, however, that a defeated issue or lost eleetion teach the realities of our system and provide experience to judge the right way to initiate successful ehange. But you have to be there to succeed. The rewards of participation in IMS leadership are many. You are part of a group of physicians who get a unique perspective on today’s health care issues, you serve your profession and you have the opportunity to meet colleagues from across thd country. You gain influence in your eommunity and the respeet of your peers and your family. The bottom line is, the Iowa Medieal Society needs you. To that end, we pledge to supply knowledge of the issues, communi- cations training, exceptional staff support and fair elections. Remember, all politics is local, so I encourage those who want to make a differenee to attend your IMS caucus. (A list of caucuses can be found on page 11.) Help define the issues. If the IMS needs to head in a different direetion, jump in and lead the way. There is not a finer organization to represent or be represented by. Our job is to keep it that way. Ignore this valuable opportunity and very likely politics, economics and lawyers will decide our future for us. 113 L believe we need the collective wisdom of our profession to plot a course true to the core values that elevate our calling.

Unless you’ve been hiding for the past six months, you know the the Internet is making its mark as the newest medium of I I communication . Everyone seems to be prais- ing its vast resources. The Internet is far from perfect, though. Crossed signals and slow downloading times can make novices and experts alike click out of cyberspace in despair. Sifting through the immense amount of information on the Internet is in itself frustrating. Don’t give up yet. Recognize the Internet’s great resources as well as its limitations. You’ll find the Internet will become a tool in running your practice. It might just take a lit- tle time and you may need a little help. The IMS web site is a good starting point for learning how the Internet can help you in your practice. Besides news clips and an e-mail directory of IMS staff, you’ll find prac- tice management advice including a practice management question of the week and I Medicare E&M utilization data on the IMS web site.

Mercy Clinic offers many advantages to physicians (Sixth in a series) Mercy Clinic, a broad-based Des Moines corporation which offers both clinical and educational services, opened its doors in 1983. Today the Mercy Clinic system includes 18 sites, 100 physicians, 700 employees, 150,000 regular patients and 500,000 outpatient visits yearly. Physician-governed, muitispeciaity group “With changes in health care, physicians were the last ones to get themselves orga- nized. Insurance companies, government entities and hospitals were vying for control, but none of them were as close to patients as physicians were,” explains Dr. Stephen Gleason, CEO and chief medical officer of Mercy Clinic. After several proposals, a group of physicians went into partnership with Mercy Hospital and created a new corpora- tion independent of the hospital. Dr. Gleason describes Mercy Clinic as a foundation model, physician-governed, multi- specialty group with a strong primary care base. The clinic is modeled after Mayo Clinic with a board of five physician directors and several representatives from the community and Mercy Hospital. The centerpiece of the organization is the seven-member Physician Practice Advisory Committee. According to Dr. Gleason, most key decisions are made by this committee and the management team. Many advantages for physicians “1 think a physician-driven or governed sys- tem is important to maintain a patient-cen- tered perspective,” comments Dr. Gleason. “What makes Mercy Clinic unique is that physician members of our board of directors are elected to office, not appointed. Our physi- cians have a chance to participate in manage- ment and governance if they so choose by run- ning for office and voting for board members.” There are other advantages for physicians in this type of structure. Within Mercy Clinic, physicians can take an active role in education and research. In the last three years, staff raised 88.3 million for clinic research funding. In addition, a new program in partnership with the Mayo Medical School just began which includes a residency pro- gram and research. Another advantage to organizing this type of group is the ability to finance a support staff that pays attention to changes in regula- tions, the legal environment and accounting rules. Continued growth is goal for the future “We’ve added 40 physicians in the last three years. We’d like to expand our primary and specialty care in rural Iowa,” remarks Dr. Gleason. Currently Mercy Clinic has sites in urban, suburban, rural and inner city areas. Eleven specialty areas are represent- ed and a medical ethicist is on staff also. Advice for Iowa colleagues Dr. Gleason offers several tips for physi- cians contemplating organizing. “There is some safety in numbers and some economies of scale when physicians collaborate. Don’t get upset with colleagues trying creative ven- tures; someday they may be your partner. Don’t sell out for cash — participating in gov- ernance and policy-making is more impor- tant in the long run. Look at the organiza- tional structure of the group you may collab- orate with. Can you participate in some capacity in determining the future course of the organization?” Dr. Gleason concludes, “Aside from iden- tifying good partners, practicing good medi- cine and being nice to patients is still the best thing one can do.” E3 IOWA MEDICINE ''Don’t get upset with colleagues trying creative ventures; someday they may be your part- ner. ” Key CONTACTS: Mercy Clinic 515/248-4515 Stephen Gleason, DO CEO/chief medical officer Dave Sweiskowski, MD Assistant chief medical officer James Caterine, MD Chief of specialty services Linda Salomone Senior vice president for operations If you knovD of other innovative practice arrarigements — especially those controlled by physi- cians and posi- tioned to compete in the managed care market — call Barb Cannon or Chris McMahon at the IMS, 515/223- 1401 or 800/747- 3070.

Survey of Iowa physicians This month, the Iowa Medical Society will be asking Iowa physicians about their con- cerns, their priorities and what the IMS can do to help. As part of a comprehensive strategic plan- ning process, the IMS will survey all practic- ing physicians. The survey will be the first tool used by IMS leadership to determine the future direction of the organization. The survey contains very specific ques- tions about issues which most concern Iowa physicians today and new services which IMS might offer to help members cope with the changes in health care delivery. The focus of the survey is on issues which affect medical practice. IMS leadership urges all physicians to complete the survey and return it to IMS. The survey is being conduct- ed by the IMS Board of Trustees with the assistance of Charlton Research Company. If you want to know what issues are on the minds of your Iowa colleagues, check future issues of Iowa Medicine for survey results. New IMS Directory on its way Due to a computer problem in the member listing, a new 1997 IMS Directory has been published and will be sent to you very soon. The new directory will have the color red on the cover; the words “Revised Edition” will appear in the upper right hand corner. If your clinic ordered multiple copies of the old directory, you will receive the same number of new ones. Members are asked to throw away the old directory as soon as the new one arrives. We apologize for any inconvenience the directo- ry may have caused. News from Iowa Medical Group Management Association (IMGMA) A beneficial relationship The relationship between the Iowa Medical Group Management Association and the Iowa Medical Society has been mutually beneficial. There are several reasons for this. The most obvi- ous being that the business of medicine is the core of our existence. The second reason is that the executive director of the IMGMA, Dana Petrowsky, is also employed by the IMS and she is able to eoordinate efforts between the IMGMA and IMS. This working relationship has been amicable for both entities and further enhancement of the relationship is desired. Taking this relationship one step further is the job of IMGMA’s president, Nancy Park and the board of IMGMA. A collaborative agreement will soon be negotiated with the IMS. For the IMGMA, the agreement will ensure eoordination of practice management educational seminars and programs. The IMS will be able to offer various programs that are relevant for today’s medical offices. Fundamental to both IMGMA and IMS is the advocacy for legislative issues and other business topics of both organizations.

Some state and federal lawmakers are propos- ing legislation to mandate 48-hour hospital stays. Changes to Iowa’s handicapped parking law made by the Iowa Legislature in 1996 will be effective January 1, 1997. Under the changes, holders of permits will have to reapply for a new parking permit during 1997. A signed statement from a physician must accompayty an application for a perm it. Call Bev Corron at the IMS for a copy of the new requiremen t or check the IMS web site. New laws affecting physicians Pregnant minors Physicians who provide pregnancy-related medical care to pregnant minors should be aware of a new law which went into effect January 1. The law requires physicians to offer the minor on the first visit, viewing of a video which is intended to assist the minor in making decisions relating to her pregnancy. The video and a manual will be provided at no cost to all family physicians, obstetricians and pediatricians in Iowa; they should arrive at your office in early January. Physicians who do not receive the materials should write to Carol Hinton, Family Services Bureau, Iowa Department of Public Health, Lucas State Office Building, Des Moines, lA 50319- 0075. The new law also requires that in most cases a parent must be notified prior to the minor receiving an abortion. Parental con- sent is not required. In a medical emergency a parent must be notified within 12 hours after the abortion is performed. Notification of the parent is not required in any of the fol- lowing circumstances: a parent has submit- ted written authorization of the termination of the pregnancy, a court has authorized waiver of the notification requirement, the minor declares being a victim of child abuse by the parent which has been reported or founded or the minor deelares being a vietim of sexual abuse which has been reported. The IMS provided detailed written eom- ments whieh were incorporated into the final version of the administrative rules imple- menting this new law. For a eopy of the parental notification rules call Cheryl Peers at the IMS or for more information eall Becky Roorda. Handicapped parking permits Another new law physieians should be aware of makes several changes relating to handicapped parking permits. Beginning January 1, 1997 handicapped parking per- mits may only be issued to persons meeting at least one of the following eriteria: • Cannot walk 200 feet without resting; • Cannot walk without an assistive deviee; • Is restrieted by lung disease sueh that the foreed expiratory volume for one seeond is less than one liter or the arterial oxygen ten- sion is less than 60mm/hg on room air at rest; • Uses portable oxygen; • Has a eardiae eondition with funetional lim- itation in class HI or IV according to American Heart Association standards; • Walking is severely limited due to an arthrit- ie, neurologieal or orthopedie eondition. For temporary permits the physieian’s statement must state the period of time dur- ing whieh the person is expeeted to be hand- icapped and the period for which the permit should be issued, not to exeeed six months. Temporary permits may be renewed. The handieapped person is responsible for applying for the permit through the Department of Transportation driver lieense station and for obtaining and submitting the physieian’s statement. The physieian’s state- ment must be on letterhead. A patient or physician who provides false 12 Iowa Medicine January 1997 IOWA MEDICINE information with the intent to defraud in obtaining a permit may be fined ^300. 1997 legislative agenda The 1997 session of the Iowa legislature begins on Monday January 13. IMS priorities for the session were reeommended by the Committee on Legislation and have been approved by the Board of Trustees. Liability reform and managed care issues are the two top priorities for the IMS in 1997. With the change in leadership in the Senate, passage of needed liability reform seems more possible. The IMS will pursue a cap on noneconomic damages and a reduction in the long statute of limitations for minors (an IMS bill passed the House in 1995 but was not passed by the Senate). In the arena of managed care, the IMS will work for legislation to require employers who provide health benefits to offer employees either a fee for service plan or point of service feature in a managed care plan. The point of service feature would allow the patient to go to physicians outside the provider network; the patient may have to pay a slightly higher premium, deductible or copayment based on the actuarial costs of the plan. Many other issues are expected to come up as well. Scope of practice issues continue to be important as the health care delivery sys- tem evolves. Changes are being proposed to the Iowa Administrative Procedures Act which sets out the procedures used by the Board of Medical Examiners and other state agencies in the disciplinary process and other contested cases. The Act also lays out the process by which regulations are adopted by state agencies. The IMS will work to ensure due process for physicians and opportunities to affect the regulatory process. There are many new legislators in 1997. The IMS will send out a legislative directory as soon as it is available. If you do not know the name of your state senator or representa- tive, call Cheryl Peers at the IMS. Good news on optometry lawsuit the Iowa Academy of Ophthalmology (lAO) by the Iowa Optometric Association and nine optometrists. The good news is that the judge upheld the lAO in all of the issues raised by the optometrists concerning the Board of Medical Examiners’ declaratory ruling on postopera- tive care. The lAO has been totally absolved of any liability in those matters. However, the judge allowed the plaintiffs to keep a toehold in the case based on what he thought was a narrow “material issue of fact” which remains in dispute. According to the law, a summary judgment motion cannot be grant- ed if there is room for controversy or disput- ed facts. The remaining issue concerns a local con- flict in Cedar Rapids. The lAO plans to be very aggressive in resolving the matter. 1113 Contacting your legislators Telephone numbers during the session: Senators Representatives Governor 515/281-3371 515/281-3221 515/281-5211 Write to them at: STATEHOUSE Des Moines, Iowa 50319 You may also contact your legislators at home when the legislature is not in session.

Iowa’s average payment is S5,195; the Midwest average is S5,971 and the U.S. average is 86,769. Insurance reforms in the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill were actually passed by the Iowa Legislature years ago, Iowa Insurance Commissioner Therese Vaughan told the IMS Board of Trustees at a November dinner meeting. Ms. Vaughan fore- sees no major legislative initiatives from the Iowa Division of Insurance beyond “tinkering” with Iowa law to bring it into compliance. Ms. Vaughan also told the Board that she is concerned about issues such as gag clauses which arise when certain managed care companies enter a state. with the IMS to assure this pilot is done in as fair, efficient and effective way as possible.” He said he is pleased to be working with Iowa physicians and looks forward to their assis- tance in the pilot. GMIS is a Pennsylvania- based firm that was recently acquired by IIBO and Company. Dr. Kelly stated that since the pilot site is Iowa, IMS must know and understand what GMIS is doing. They look forward to an exchange of information both on the process and on the pilot findings. More information will be reported in Iowa Medicine as it becomes available. Iowa is test site for T.18 edit software Iowa has been selected as the pilot test site for the Medicare test of the GMIS claim edit- ing software. GMIS, an “off the shelf” com- mercial claim editing software package, is in wide use throughout the country by private payers and managed care companies. It has been suggested that using off the shelf type editing software will save the Medicare pro- gram millions of dollars annually from claim errors. The Iowa test will not have any effect on actual claim payments. Rather the pilot will be a parallel test run for analysis only. The test is slotted to begin in April 1997 and most likely be completed with a report to HCFA in September 1997. If potential savings are doc- umented in the Iowa test, the GMIS software may be implemented nationally by Medicare. The GMIS software is a database that is used to review the logic and accuracy of physician billing. One component of the Iowa pilot is detailed review of the database to be sure it is consistent with existing national Medicare payment policy and that the soft- ware works in the Medicare claim processing environment. Dr. John Kelly, chief medical officer of GMIS, in a telephone call to the IMS, said that “GMIS is looking forward to working IMS joins attorney general tobacco suit The Iowa Medical Society is participating in a lawsuit brought by Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller against the tobacco com- panies. The suit, like those being brought in other states, seeks to recover Medicaid funds used to treat smoking-related illnesses. In late November, members of the IMS Board of Trustees participated in press con- ferences around Iowa announcing the filing of the lawsuit. Remarks made at the Des Moines press conference by Dr. William McMillan were replayed on several radio sta- tions. Big changes at Blues Blue Cross Blue Shield is undergoing “rad- ical reform” under John Forsyth, the new chief executive officer, said a recent Des Moines Register article. Forsyth’s goals are reducing administrative expenses, eliminat- ing corporate hierarchy and focusing on pub- lic health issues. The IMS Board of Trustees will meet with Mr. Forsyth January 15; he will address the IMS Executive Council January 16. CEl 14 Iowa Medicine January 1997 IOWA MEDICINE & TECHNOLOGY Physician profiles now available through IIVIS The Iowa Medical Society is pleased to announce the signing of a contract with QuadraMed Corporation for the exclusive use of their QuanTIM Clinical Performance Measurement software. The software and an all-payer, all-patient data base allows IMS to help physicians analyze their own perfor- mance data. Organizations such as insurance compa- nies, managed care organizations, hospitals and other health care providers are using var- ious data bases to “rate” physicians. How- ever, these organizations usually have access to a limited data base, or do not risk adjust the data prior to analysis. IMS and QuadraMed have purchased an inpatient data base which will reside at IMS along with the software. This gives the IMS a tool to help physicians analyze their own data in an educational rather than punitive envi- ronment. Other data bases will be purchased as they become available to help you analyze data trends. The QuanTIM Clinical Performance Meas- urement software allows a physician to com- pare his or her inpatient outcomes to other physicians across the state or within a specif- ic specialty for self-assessment or quality improvement. The all-payer, all-patient data base gives a more complete analysis than is possible by external organizations. Most importantly, the software utilizes a risk ad- justment technique to account for the fact that different patients with the same diagno- sis may have pertinent, risk increasing condi- tions or characteristics that impact the prob- ability of having a particular outcome. Risk adjustment is absolutely necessary before performance data can be analyzed. Physicians will order reports directly from the IMS. The first report and graph will dis- play your data compared to other Iowa physi- cians on a broad scale at a cost of $250. Included is a comprehensive interpretation to tell you what the numbers and graphs mean. You may purchase other reports to chart your data in virtually unlimited combinations. This is valuable if you are classified as an “outlier” (high or low) or if you are simply curious. The software gives you the ability to look at data in significant detail — to individ- ual patient level data if necessary. Physicians may choose inpatient clinical outcomes covering six major analysis cate- gories; 1) general; 2) cardiac; 3) obstetrics; 4) neonatology; 5) surgery; 6) mortality. Addi- tionally, there are 103 specific outcome top- ics within these six categories, e.g., postoper- ative infection, c-section, VEAG, CABG mor- tality, MI mortality, etc. It is imperative that you become aware of how you are being rated by other organiza- tions. This service can help you: • Understand how data can be utilized to your advantage; • Prepare more accurate and comprehensive analyses of your patterns; • Utilize the data to market your areas of excellence; • Realize why your outcomes may be differ- ent than your peers; • Determine changes you can implement so the numbers will east you in a better light.

Practice analysis software available A helpful service for physician offices is being offered by the Center for Research in Ambulatory Health Care Administration (CRAHGA), a subsidiary of the Medical Group Management Association. GRAHCA has developed software called “Physician Services Practice Analysis” (PSPA). PSPA is a comprehensive, responsive soft- ware designed by and for practices whose physicians understand the need to analyze performance compared with other practices and to project future performance. PSPA uses key practice management vari- ables and the Resource-Based Relative Value Scale to analyze productivity and conduct cost accounting and payer analysis. PSPA software can be purchased from CRAHGA for $925 (MGMA member price). It can be loaded into your computer. Your data is periodically submitted to CRAHGA, where it is merged with data from other practices across the country. You will receive reports comparing your practice and other practices. You can use the software to help set charges for services, develop physician compensation programs, negotiate and analyze payer contracts and many other functions. You can even use PSPA to compute Per Member Per Month premiums needed to make capitation profitable.

The physician diagnosed a fracture and the patient was taken to surgery for an open reduc- tion of the fracture and casting. On the 11th post-op day she was examined and an area of redness from “cast irritation” along the back of her leg was noted. It was documented that this area was healing nicely. Approximately two weeks later, she was examined and the area was still reddened. The physi- cian recommended padding and an antibiotic cream. The patient later went on to develop an ulcer- ation and eventually required aggressive treatment with split-thickness grafting. A malpractice claim was filed claiming the physician improperly casted her leg and improperly monitored and treated the area of irritation. During the investigation of this claim it was discov- ered that there were two differing copies of the medical record. In one there was a short note regarding the area of irritation with the recommendation of padding and antibiotic cream. The other was more comprehensive about the irritation and the treatment plan. When the original record was viewed closely, the longer version note could be seen pasted over the top of the short- er version. The physician admitted he “may” have gone back after he had been notified of the mal- practice claim and clarified this note. This claim was eventually settled due to problems in defending the care with two differing sets of medical records. Alteration of medical records can turn a medically defensible case into a loser because “innocent” additions or late dictation can be perceived as attempts to conceal mistakes. Most alterations and additions are detectable simply because copies of records have already been released before the physician is made aware of the malpractice claim. Never alter or make additions to the record after notification of a bad outcome or malpractice claim. It’s much easier to explain incomplete or unclear documentation at deposition than to explain additions that were made after the fact.

Mr. Abrams also shares what he believes is the biggest challenge facing physicians and what the IMS can do to meet the needs of Iowa’s physicians. Mick\\el Abh\\ms Mr. Abrams started ■with the IMS on November 11. He was director of the Depart- ment of Government Relations and Market- ing at the Indiana State Medical Association prior to joining the IMS. Qa Tell US about your background. WTiat were your responsibilities at the Indiana State Medical Association? A« I have a bachelors degree in political sci- ence from Indiana University and a masters degree in public administration, also from lU. My graduate degree has a concentration in public policy analysis. I joined the Indiana State Medical Association in August 1987 as a lobbyist. In that capacity, I spent about 95% of my time lobbying the state legislature on health issues. After two sessions, my predecessor left to work for the state department of health and I was promoted to chief lobbyist and director of government relations. As a result of strategic planning, departments were consolidated and my new department (the Department of Government Relations and Marketing) was created. My department was responsible for federal and state government affairs, assistance to physi- cians who are addicted to alcohol and other drugs, practice management consulting, reim- bursement ombudsman activities, member- ship recruitment and retention and data col- lection. I loved my work at ISMA because my department was responsible for such a wide array of issues, all of them critical to the med- ical society’s success. Qa Why did you want to come to Iowa and to the Iowa Medical Society? s physicians rein- A. There are many reasons why Iowa is an attractive opportunity for my family and me. First, the state itself is a very welcoming place. We are very impressed with the education system and the people of Iowa. Second, the vent themselves profession- ally, their needs will change. IMS will be prepared to change with those needs. dynamics of the health community and Iowa physicians are quite similar to Indiana, so I immediately felt comfortable with the med- ical society. Finally, I believe that serving 20 Iowa Medicine January 1997 IOWA MEDICINE Iowa physicians as EVP of the Iowa Medical Society is going to be not only professionally ehallenging to me, but will also be very enjoy- able! There are a lot of ehanges taking place in the medical community and the way in which physicians deliver care to their patients and it will be important for IMS to be involved with those ehanges and continue to 1 be significant to our members. Qa What will be your immediate priorities : during your first year as Iowa Medieal Society i executive vice president? Ab a top priority will be strategie planning. I ; believe it is eritical for organizations to con- stantly revisit their mission, their purpose, i their core values; using this to guide their aetions. What values do the IMS hold deeply? Why does IMS exist? What do we aspire to attain? Why should a physician belong to any medical society? What value to we add to their professional lives? How can we be more important, more indispensable to the prac- tiee of medicine? A good strategic planning process can help answer these types of ques- tions and ensure that we are progressing with a vision of where were are going and what our role is. Another priority will be membership recruitment and retention. As physicians ; reinvent themselves professionally, their needs will ehange. IMS will be prepared to change with those needs so that Iowa physi- ji cians continue to need IMS. : Finally, I want to spend a great deal of time learning the culture and the community. ; Until now, most of my exposure to Iowa came ; every four years during the presidential eau- cuses! It is important for me to learn how the medieal community and the community at large work with IMS. Qb We understand there will be a eompre- hensive strategic planning process for the IMS in early 1997. What will this entail? What do you hope to accomplish through this process? Ab The process will entail a lot of introspec- tive study. What do our members want and need from an organization such as IMS? We need to learn that not from our leadership, but from the rank-and-file physieian who is busy at practiee in Anywhere, Iowa. The membership study will be conducted using a number of study tools, ineluding a survey, focus groups and telephone interviews. Beyond that, there will be a series of lengthy meetings, off-site planning retreats and staff continued 'I ( Ij IJ i; i; i„i : ii |!i I 'ii :|,l Ij; , i ‘ii : <: Ml : III Iowa Medicine January 1997 21 4 IOWA MEDICINE continued I believe it is critical for organi- zations to con- stantly revisit their mission, their purpose, their core values; using this to guide their actions. research intended to provide more informa- tion regarding our society’s core values and purpose. The intended result of the strategic plan- ning process will be a fresh vision of IMS pur- pose: our mission statement, core values and the activities on which we intend to focus to accomplish our mission. Qb What is the biggest challenge facing physicians? A« Physicians have always been empowered by the health system to advocate on behalf of their patients. 1 believe that one of the biggest challenges facing not only physicians, but patients, is the preservation of that patient- physician relationship— the ability for a patient and a physician to come together and decide a treatment plan and to pursue that plan without interference by government, payers or other entities not directly impacted by the decision. Another major challenge for physicians is medical education and physician distribu- tion. Managed care has raised some impor- tant issues about how physicians will be trained and how that educational process will be funded. There are no easy answers to these chal- lenges, but 1 am energized by the discussions and possible solutions. Qa What can organized medicine do to sup- port physicians in the new environment? Aa Hopefully our strategic planning process will allow us to focus like a laser on the most important things that physicians need, but 1 can imagine a few services that should be provided. For example, there is a great demand for data. 1 believe that IMS should be the leader in collecting, analyzing and disseminating data on health care in Iowa, including out- comes, length of stay, charges, severity- adjusted complication and mortality data and similar information. We are uniquely equip- ped to do this because of the expertise avail- able throughout our membership. Second, I sense a demand for assistance with practice management issues. Perhaps we can be helpful to physicians as they go through the painful process of reinventing themselves and answering such pressing questions as “should I participate in a PHO or a PH” or “should I become a hospital employ- ee?” Qa WTiat do you enjoy in your leisure time? Aa I love to read. And when I read, I do not necessarily seek out books that only relate to my profession. I find that a good book helps me relax and enjoy life, so I am almost always working on a book. I love any book by Sinclair Lewis and I enjoy reading books about history. I can also enjoy a good Grisham novel! My wife and I also enjoy short day trips. If we have some time, we enjoy getting in the car and traveling a few hours away to stay in a town and explore a new area. Moving to Iowa has opened up lots of new possibilities for day trips! Golf is also a hobby of mine, although 1 just recently took it up and am not at all good. I am that dangerous combination: a bad golfer who truly loves the game. Qa If you could invite anyone to a dinner party who would you invite? Aa I would invite Jesus Christ, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Thomas Jefferson. That should provide some stimulating conversa- tion! BZ] 22 Iowa Medicine January 1997 Can you afford to ignore the Internet? Probably not. Nearly 40 million people already have Internet access, and that number is expected to grow to 300 million people in the next three years. It truly is a new form of communication that’s here to stay. Besides, you’re missing a wealth of information by not using the Internet. The Internet is a 24'hour virtual library of medical resources. The Internet also allows the exchange of e-mail and real-time discussion groups for doctors and patients.

Through this global network, users can send e-mail, talk to other people in discussion groups and view weh sites on the World Wide Web. The World Wide Weh is the part of the Interraet that allows graphics, what you generally think of as the flashy part of the Internet. The other features of the Internet, such as e-mail, are text-based. What do you need to get connected? To get connected to the Iriternet you will need a computer, a modem, a telephone line and the software to link your computer to an Internet service provider. You will also need an account with a commercial online service or an Internet service provider. Computer: Remember that your Internet software and your current software will run at the same speed. If your computer is sluggish now, it will be sluggish in cyberspace as well. Most Internet service providers recommend that you have 1 6 MB of memory and at least a 486 processor for PCs. A system with a Pentium processor works best for the Internet. Macintosh computers work best run- ning on System 7 or higher with 8 MB of memory and 3-5 MB of disk space for applications. Modem: The faster your modem, the better it will he for using the Internet. Modems slower than 14-4 Kpbs will he frustrating to use. If you are buying a new modem, get a 28.8 Kpbs modem. Telephone line: You might consider getting a separate telephone line for your modem, unless you don’t mind having the line tied up while you are using the Internet. Software: You will receive easy-to-install software from the commercial online service or Internet service provider when you set up an account. Make sure you also purchase a browser program, such as Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer. These programs allow you to view weh sites on the World Wide Web. Many Internet service providers include these programs with their software. How do you choose a service provider? There are two primary ways to get connected to the Internet; through a national commercial online service such as CompuServe or AmericaOnline, or through a dedicated Internet service provider. When deciding which route to take, consider that providers don’ t all charge in the same way. Find out the initial set- up fees and monthly charges. Also ask about whether you can access the service by calling a local number. If you can’t call a local number, you will pay long distance phone fees for the time you are connected to the Internet. What is best for you depends on your use of the Internet. Commercial online services are easy for new users, hut they limit the number of hours you can use the service each month. After reaching that limit, you pay for additional time. Internet service providers generally have more flexible plans based on the amount of time you expect to be using the Internet.

IOWA MEDICINE Combatting fraud and abuse Anti-Kickback Statute As the Medicare and Medicaid programs have become a larger part of the federal bud- get, the government has increased its resources for discovering and prosecuting fraud and abuse. Enactment of the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Account- ability Act (Kassebaum-Kennedy) enhanced the federal government’s ability to combat fraud and abuse. One of the main tools likely to be used for prosecution is the Federal Health Care Pro- gram Anti-Kickback Act. In an environment where the roles and relationships of physi- cians are changing, this law causes concern. Because of the law’s broad language, it is uncertain whether a wide array of business practices such as discounts, investments in health care entities and compensation arrangements are prohibited. What’s prohibited? The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits I knowing and willful solicitation or receipt of remuneration, including any kickback, bribe or rebate, in return for making a referral or purchasing, leasing or ordering equipment that may be paid for by state or federal mon- ey. The law also prohibits the knowing and j willful offer or payment of remuneration to I induce such activity. A violation of these provisions is a felony punishable by up to five years imprisonment and/or up to 1^25,000 in fines. The Office of Inspector I General of the Department of Health and I Human Services (DHHS) also may exclude an individual from federal health care pro- grams. The potential range of prosecutions should not be underestimated. It covers many activ- ities including employee/employer relation- ships, rental of space or equipment, owner- ship interests in health care entities and participation as a provider in managed care plans. The jurisdiction of the government over such claims should not be underestimated. One referral of a Medicare or Medicaid (or other federal health care program) patient can subject a physician to the law; there is no requirement to show harm to the patient or the government. Courts have held if just one purpose of the payment is to ind,uce future referrals, the statute has been violated. Safe harbors Fortunately, the law provides for certain exceptions as well as “safe harbors”. The statutory exceptions include bona-fide employment relationships, certain discounts and payment of administrative fees by ven- dors to certain group purchasing organiza- tions of providers. Kassebaum-Kennedy cre- ated an important exception for risk-sharing arrangements such as remuneration to a physician pursuant to arrangements that place the physician at substantial financial risk for the cost or utilization of items or ser- vices the physician is required to provide. Regulations implementing the Anti-Kick- back Act provide safe harbors that cover var- ious business relationships. The safe harbors address investment interests, space and equipment rentals, personal services and management contracts’ sale of practices, continued Willard Boyd III Mr. Boyd is an attorney’ with the Nyemaster, Goode, McLaughlin, Voigts, West, Mansell & O’Brien, PC law firm in Des Moines. Iowa Medicine January 1997 23 IOWA MEDICINE continued a ne referral of a Medicare or Medicaid patient can subject a physi- cian to the law; there is no require- ment to show harm to the patient or the government. referral services, warranties, discounts, employment arrangements, group purchas- ing organizations and waiver of beneficiary coinsurance deductible amounts. Proposed safe harbors exist for other types of activities including physician recruitment and cross referral arrangements for special- ists. Wdiile these safe harbors would appear to cover many activities, each contains sev- eral requirements that often make it uncer- tain whether legitimate conduct actually falls within a safe harbor. While failure to meet the requirements does not necessarily mean a physician has violated the law, falling under a safe harbor does give the physician comfort in knowing that the conduct will not be challenged. Under Kassebaum-Kennedy, a procedure for public participation in the safe harbor devel- opment process has been established. Kassebaum-Kennedy also allows requests for advisory opinions by the DIIIIS Office of Inspector General to clarify the law’s applica- tion. While such opinions are binding only on the requesting party and DHHS, they should provide guidance. DHHS has issued special fraud alerts that provide guidance on various types of arrangements, including hospital-based physicians, physician practice acquisitions, hospital incentives to physi- cians and joint venture arrangements. “Knowingly and willfully” An essential requirement in showing a violation of the law is that the action of the provider must be knowing and willful. In a 1995 case decided by a California federal appellate court, Hanslester Network v. Sha- lala, physician self-referral joint ventures were challenged as “shams” used as conduits for payment to physicians for referrals. The court found “ample evidence” that defen- dants intended to encourage physician-own- ers to refer business to the joint venture lab- oratories and offered physicians the opportu- nity to profit indirectly from referral when they could not profit directly. The court found the defendant providers believed their conduct to be lawful and held that the “knowingly and willfully” requirement of the law required proof that the provider knew what the statute forbade and intended to dis- obey the law. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit rendered a decision in 1996 also interpreting the “knowingly and willfully” requirement. In Utiited States v. Jain, the appellate court reviewed a trial court’s con- viction of a physician in which there was evi- dence that remuneration under a marketing agreement between a hospital and the refer- ring physician was not for marketing services but for patient referrals. The government argued that “willfully” under the statute referred to consciousness of the act but not consciousness that the act is unlawful. The defendants argued that the standard used in Hanslester should be adopted. The trial court “adopted a middle ground” and inter- preted “willfully” to mean unjustifiably and wrongfully, known to be such by the defen- dant. The trial court instructed the jury that “good faith” was a defense to this charge, explaining the physician acted in good faith if he believed he was being paid for promot- ing the hospital, not for referring patients. The court concluded that the government needed to prove the physician knew his con- duct was wrongful, rather than prove he knew it violated a known legal duty. While the “heightened” willfulness requirements set out in Hanlester and Jain decisions appear helpful to providers, they could be overruled by the U.S. Supreme Court. It is important for physicians to follow developments in this area. 113 24 Iowa Medicine January 1997 Your blueprint to financial independence IOWA MEDICINE In today’s complex financial environment, understanding what you want to accom- plish and developing a strategy for meeting your objectives is eritieal. If you have ever been in the market for a finaneial planner, you have probably seen two approaches to the proeess. First, you probably talked with a planner who displayed a sample financial plan that’s several inches thick. Your plan would look the same as the sample except names and numbers would change. It’s generally a boilerplate plan that doesn’t allow for flexibility to address your needs. You may have then walked down the street and talked to the next planner whose plan represents a “needs analysis” that will show a definite need for additional life insurance — whieh he or she ean provide to you. Neither one of these is nec- essarily wrong. However, a finaneial plan is not Just the finished product. A true finaneial plan is never done. Finaneial planning is a proeess; a relationship built upon the need to define and redefine goals and create and implement solutions to problems. The fin- ished product is the blueprint, the map to your financial independence. At this point the relationship with your planner beeomes criti- cal as you work together to follow the blue- print. I suggest you categorize your planning into three major strategies: Accumulation phase: This is the process of defining goals you have for education costs, vacation home, retirement, etc. and establish- ing a plan to meet them. Management phase: How do you manage the assets and effeetively utilize your income sources? This requires a disciplined invest- ment strategy that ineludes a written invest- ment poliey and systematic approach to tax planning strategies. Distribution phase: This process is neces- sary to ensure your retirement objeetives are met by establishing an income distribution strategy that will integrate social security, retirement plan assets, real estate income, part-time work, inheritanee, etc. Planning early will help maximize income by minimizing the potentially devastating effeet of various tax laws. You should also develop a strategy for your estate in the event of your death. Proper planning ean minimize the tax your estate will pay. There are many strategies you ean implement in finan- cial planning. Wliat makes sense today may not later beeause of changing circumstances. That’s why finaneial planning is not a book on your shelf that is never reviewed. Financial planning is a relationship with a professional who will work as an advisor and advoeate for your personal and financial objectives. H3 ^j^m\\ inancial planning is a process; a relationship built upon the need to define and redefine goals and create and implement solutions to problems.

Part 2 will be published in the February issue. Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most common neurologic disorders cared for by neurologists and primary care physicians. It is characterized by the cardinal clinical features of tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and postural instability. Three of these four features are needed for a firm clinical diagnosis, but the manifestations of Parkinson’s disease in individual patients are quite variable, ranging from all four cardinal features to a more benign presentation predominantly with tremor. Other disorders may mimic idiopathic PD and are collectively referred to as the parkinsonisms. In these conditions, one or more of the cardinal clinical signs of PD are present, most often akinesia and rigidity. Additional atypical features such as onset at an earlier age, more rapid progression, autonomic instability, supranuclear gaze palsy, cerebellar signs or pyramidal tract involvement assist in distinguishing parkinsonism from idiopathic PD. Another important diagnostic point is that idiopathic PD responds to levodopa in the majority of cases, whereas in parkinsonism the therapeutic response is less prominent or absent, and if present, short lived. The parkinsonisms include disorders such as progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple systems atrophy and corticobasal ganglionic degeneration. Acquired parkinsonism may result from such varied causes as multiple subcortical strokes involving the basal ganglia and cerebral white matter, dopamine blocking or depleting medications and certain toxins. The medical and surgical treatment of PD has developed greatly over the last 25 years since the introduction of levodopa. With the increased number of treatment options now available, it has become critically important to understand when and how to institute treatment to allow the patient to return to a normal lifestyle. Treatment in early Parkinson’s disease An assessment of the patient’s lifestyle impairment and discomfort is required in deciding when to institute treatment. Frequently, at the time of diagnosis, clinical signs and symptoms may be present, but there is no disability. The presence of occupational, cosmetic and social disability all need to be explored. If the manifestations of PD are affeeting any of these realms and impairing lifestyle, symptomatic therapy should be instituted. If impairment in lifestyle cannot be identified, there may be benefit from delaying treatment. Complications after long-term therapy with levodopa may include motor fluctuations, dyskinesias and early morning dystonia. However, there is controversy as to whether these adverse outcomes develop from chronic exposure to the medication, as a result of progression in the primary disease process or from both. Some experimental data suggests that early institution of levodopa may increase the oxidative stress on surviving dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra accelerating neuronal loss. Accordingly, in early mild PD, where there is little or no disability, strong consideration should be given to instituting therapy with an alternative medication. These include selegiline (Eldepryl), amantadine (Sym- metrel) or anticholinergic medications such as trihexiphenidyl (Artane) or benztropine (Gogentin). The IMS Education Fund has designated this article as the Henry Albert Presentation Award for January 1997.

I,' :: r . 0- Iowa Medicine January^ 1997 27 IOWA MEDICINE Current therapy of Parkinson’s disease continued Selegiline Selegiline, in low doses, is a selective inhibitor of the the enzyme monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B). At recommended dosages there is no risk for the hypertensive crises seen in patients ingesting tyramine containing foods while receiving the non- selective antidepressant monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Selegiline has been shown to delay the need for more potent dopaminergic therapy when used in early mild PD. Despite its mechanism of action, the ability of this medication to delay therapy with more potent dopaminergic medications makes it an excellent choice for treatment in early mild PD. Because of its potential for neuroprotection, treatment should be considered in patients with no disability. The recommended daily dose is 5 mg twice daily, morning and noon, since doses later in the day may result in insomnia. Due to its irreversible inhibition of MAO-B, treatment with 5 mg per day may be as effective and reduce cost and side effects. Potential sei'ious drug interactions have been reported in a small number of patients taking selegiline and tricyclic antidepressants or serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Although recent studies have suggested this interaction is extremely rare, some have been fatal secondary to autonomic nervous system involvement. Amantadine Amantadine may result in mild improvement in the symptoms of PD, partly through enhancing the release of dopamine from surviving nigrostriatal nerve terminals. However, benefit may begin to wane after two or three months of therapy and often is absent after a year. The initial dosage is 100 mg twice daily. This medication may cause confusion and hallucinations in some elderly patients with PD. Other side effects include livedo reticularis and ankle edema. Anticholinei^cs Anticholinergic medications are most effective for treatment of PD tremor. Other features such as bradykinesia, postural instability and rigidity are less often improved. Therefore, anticholinergic medications are a reasonable choice in patients whose major disability arises from tremor. The two most commonly used medications in this category are trihexy- phenidyl (Artane) and benztropine (Cogentin). These drugs have the potential anticholinergic side effects of visual blurring, urinary retention, sedation and constipation as well as increasing intraocular pressure in patients with closed angle glaucoma. In elderly patients the risk of causing confusion, hallucinations and impaired memory exists. Anticholinergic medications should therefore be used cautiously and in low dosages in the elderly and avoided in patients with any evidence of dementia. With a gradual increase in the dose of anticholinergic medication, a great deal of the peripheral side effects can be avoided. Trihexyphenidyl should be begun at 1 mg twice daily and increased by one tablet per week to a dose of 2 mg three times daily, if tolerated. Benztropine may be begun at 0.5 mg per day and increased to 1 mg twice daily. If these medications must be discontinued they should be tapered off slowly due to the risk of rebound worsening of PD symptoms with abrupt cessation. Moderately advanced disease Patients in this group have disability beyond that which can be managed effectively with selegiline, amantadine or anticholinergics alone. This level of disability requires therapy with levodopa. The long- term implications of levodopa therapy include a 30-50% incidence of motor fluctuations and/or abnormal involuntary movements after five years of therapy. Therefore, avoidance of premature therapy with levodopa and administering the lowest possible dose for symptomatic control is advised. Levodopa Levodopa is administered along with carbidopa in a combined tablet (Sinemet). Garbidopa is a peripheral inhibitor of dopa decarboxylase, the enzyme responsible for the peripheral metabolism of levodopa to dopamine. Peripheral inhibition of this enzyme reduces untoward side effects of 28 Iowa Medicine January 1997 H levodopa, most notably nausea. Most patients I require around 60 to 150 mg of carbidopa. ; Therefore, the 10/100 mg dosage form of carbidopa/levodopa may not provide adequate i carbidopa to reduce these peripheral side effects. Supplemental earbidopa tablets |i (Lodosyn) at a dose of 50 to 75 mg per day j may be required for nausea that may I accompany treatment with carbidopa/ i levodopa tablets. Carbidopa/levodopa is available in standard .release (Sinemet) and sustained release preparations (Sinemet GR). Standard Sinemet is less expensive and is available in generic norm. Sinemet CR has the advantage of fewer daily doses. Sustained release Sinemet also reduees the pulsatile stimulation of striatal dopamine receptors related to the periodic ingestion of levodopa by providing for a more continuous plasma level of levodopa. This may reduce the development of motor fluctuations and dyskinesias. Some physicians may choose to initiate therapy with sustained release carbidopa/ levodopa 25/100 twice daily for the first week and increase to 50/200 twice daily. The medication’s effectiveness should be evaluated after the first month. Due to the slow release of levodopa and its longer latency for onset of action, especially in the morning, additional administration of one-half to one tablet of a standard 25/100 carbidopa/levodopa tablet upon awakening may be recommended to speed the onset of effect with this first dosage. If the sustained-release preparation is not chosen as initial therapy, the standard preparation may be tried at a dose of one-half of a 25/100 mg tablet three times daily and increased after seven to 10 days to one tablet three times daily. If the clinical response is suboptimal after one month, a further inerease in the dose should be considered. If levodopa doses over 800 mg are required, the addition of a dopamine agonist sueh as bromocriptine or pergolide should be considered before adding more levodopa. Selegiline may be eontinued for its potential neuroprotective and levodopa-sparing effects. Similarly, anticho-linergic medications may provide added benefit in relatively young patients with prominent tremor.

The doctor is torn between a desire to relieve suffering and the concern over being dooped by an addict. Whether legitimate patients or bonified addicts, these individuals are a source of frustration and anxiety for doctors and staff. Drug-seeking behavior can become tiresome, especially when demands of more seriously ill patients are present in a busy practice. Through my experience as a family practi- tioner and director of several chemical dependency programs, 1 have found a solu- tion. It stems from a technique used in all treatment programs known as a “contract”. Once it has been determined a patient has exhausted all other reasonable treatment alternatives (i.e., pain center, nerve block, etc.) but still has chronic pain and/or anxiety for which ongo- ing analgesics and/or psy- chotropics are indicated, a contract is drawn up in the form of a letter. The letter specifies the medication to be paticiiL iiao however, is our legitimate concern and compassion for those who are truly suffering. used, the dosage and the number to be taken physician learns any other physician or phar- macy is prescribing or dispensing medica- tions, the contract and the doctor-patient relationship will be terminated. The office is no longer under siege by calls from the patient and pharmacy for refills. The patient is far less anxious about obtain- ing relief from pain and has a clear under- standing of how the system works. This sys- tem is also useful when the prescribing physician is not available. Most partners are reluctant to prescribe narcotiqs or psy- chotropics for patients with whom they are unfamiliar. I generally leave written prescrip- tions with my nurse for any “contract” patients before leaving for vacation.

System Difference, call Numerous physicians made their mark IOWA MEDICINE In 1840 Dr. John B. Elbert came from Ohio to Keosauqua. His boundless ener- gies lead to his election to the Territorial Legislature in 1842. He enjoyed a fine reputa- tion as a surgeon, having received honorary degrees from the University of Missouri and the University of Pennsylvania. He was a charter member of ISMS and was elected its third president in 1852. In 1838 Dr. Henry Murry located in Iowa City. Born in Ireland, a graduate of the Uni- versity of Louisville, Kentucky, he was the first physician to settle in the present limits of Johnson County. In the same year a Dr. Ezra Bliss came from Vermont to Iowa City, but in a few years he moved to New York City. The Iowa State Medical Society was formed in June 1850 when 25 physicians met in Burlington under the impetus set by Dr. John F. Sanford of Farming- ton. Inspii'ed while attending the third annual meeting of the AMLA. he went by stage to Keosauqua, Fairfield, Mt. Pleasant, Washington and Davenport and by steamer to Muscatine, Burlington, Ft. Madison and Keokuk espous- ing the need for a state med- ical society. Early physicians in the newly-opened ter- ritory of Iowa often received their medical training under the supervision of a preceptor. The first preceptor in Iowa, according to available records, was Dr. Isaac Galland who founded the settlement known as Nashville, located a few miles north of Keokuk. Berry- man Jennings was one such individual who learned medicine from Dr. Galland. Numer- ous other physicians assumed the position of preceptoi's; some for good cause, others to have someone to do chores for them.
