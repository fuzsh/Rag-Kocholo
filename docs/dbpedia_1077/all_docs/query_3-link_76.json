This inﬂux of economic development activity has had an extremely positive impact on\n\nthe overall economic health of our area. However, it has also placed a strain on the local labor market.\n\nIn order for our area to maintain the unprecedented economic growth that we have experienced, it is\n\nimperative that we both grow and train our local labor force.\n\nSUPPORT REQUESTED\n\nIn an effort to proactively confront the workforce issues in the tri-state area, The Siouxland Initiative (TSI)\n\ncreated the position of Director of Workforce Solutions in August 2015. The Director of Workforce Solutions\n\nhas been working closely with state and local governments, educational institutions, local businesses, and\n\nother strategic partners to identify and address the challenges facing our region.\n\nWe acknowledge that a shortage in available workforce is not unique to the Siouxland area, and recognize\n\nthe important role the federal government must play in responding to this issue. Thus, we would urge our\n\ntri-state Congressional delegation to not only build upon existing workforce development initiatives, but to\n\nencourage the appropriate federal agencies to support and actively participate in our region’s workforce\n\ndevelopment efforts.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe unemployment rate in the Sioux City metro area has been averaging approximately 3.5% since\n\nApril 2015. In comparison, the national unemployment rate is at 5% and some areas of our nation are\n\nexperiencing rates as high as 9%. Labor economists describe full employment as the condition when\n\nunemployment is in the low 5% range.\n\nThis condition has been compounded by the $2 billion CF Industries’ expansion in Port Neal, and will be\n\nfurther impacted by the arrival of the 600,000 sq. ft. Seaboard Triumph Foods pork plant in Sioux City.\n\nEmployment at the pork plant is expected to ramp up gradually, starting with a single shift of approximately\n\n1,100 salaried and hourly employees in mid-2017.\n\nAlthough this situation could be described as a “nice problem to have,” it still presents our region with a\n\nsigniﬁcant challenge. In order to maintain a pattern of economic growth, it is vital that we both grow and\n\ntrain our local labor force.\n\nThe new Director of Workforce Solutions has been tasked with working closely with key stakeholder groups\n\n(business community, education, public sector, media and labor) to address the workforce shortage in the\n\ngreater Sioux City metro area.\n\nFollowing an extensive research and intake process, several community challenges and opportunities\n\nwere identiﬁed, including:\n\n• The workforce shortage is impacting a wide variety of industries and businesses within the Siouxland\n\nregion. However, two areas of particular concern are skilled labor and degreed young professionals.\n\n• As a society we need to do more to encourage young people to pursue in-demand skilled labor\n\nprofessions (welders, electricians, machinists, nurses, advanced mechanics, etc.), and to overcome\n\nthe perception that every high school graduate is beneﬁted by attending a four-year educational\n\ninstitution. According to recent reports, over 40% of full-time four-year college students fail to earn a\n\nbachelor’s degree within six years.\n\n1\n\n62nd Annual Siouxland/Washington Conference\n\n• The Siouxland region is fortunate to be home to a variety of higher education institutions, including\n\nprivate colleges, state universities and technical/community colleges. These institutions are able to\n\ncustomize their curriculums to meet the needs of the business community, and are vital partners in\n\nthe continued education of the existing Siouxland workforce. The reskilling and upskilling of today’s\n\nworkers in order to adapt to technological advances is crucial.\n\n• Quality of life plays a major role in the recruitment and retention of young professionals. There is a\n\nwealth of research that supports the concept that such workers are looking for creative, culturally-\n\nvibrant communities.\n\n• The Siouxland area is experiencing a shortage in housing, both in the multi-family and single-family\n\nmarkets. Having a broad variety of available residential options is key to workforce recruitment efforts.\n\n• A shortage in available workforce is not unique to the Siouxland area. As early as 2003, the Bureau\n\nof Labor Statistics projected that there would be a national labor shortage of over ten million people by\n\n2010. As a result of this “national crisis,” all three of the respective Siouxland states (Iowa, Nebraska,\n\nSouth Dakota) have implemented workforce development initiatives. These initiatives will be critical\n\ncomponents of our regional workforce development efforts.\n\nOver the past several months, task force committees comprised of the key stakeholder groups have been\n\nworking diligently to formulate a comprehensive workforce solutions strategy including both internal and\n\nexternal components. This strategy will include:\n\n• Collaborating with our educational partners on programs to guide students from high school into\n\noccupational programs that will help meet the workforce needs of our business community\n\n• Partnering with local communities to address issues that could potentially impede workforce recruitment\n\nand retention efforts (transportation, affordable and available housing, amenities, recreational\n\nopportunities, etc.) and to build upon existing quality-of-life attributes\n\n• Identifying synergies and developing partnerships with state and federal agencies in an effort to\n\neducate the Siouxland business community on existing workforce development programs\n\n• Partnering with higher education to retain recent college graduates, as well as promote workforce\n\ntraining opportunities to local employers\n\n• Creating a blueprint to attract outside talent to our area\n\nAs articulated by the Sioux City Journal Editorial Board on August 16, 2015, “the Siouxland metro region\n\nis strong and, largely, moving in the right direction. It is a good time to live and work here.” Recruiting and\n\nretaining a skilled workforce will be critical to continuing this forward progress.\n\nAUTHOR(S)\n\nKory Menken, Director of Workforce Solutions, The Siouxland Initiative,\n\n[email protected], 712.255.7903\n\n2\n\n62nd Annual Siouxland/Washington Conference\n\nCOMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT BLOCK GRANT (CDBG) & HOME INVESTMENT\n\nPARTNERSHIP PROGRAM (HOME) FUNDING CUTS\n\nISSUE\n\nThe City of Sioux City is a recipient of United States Department of Housing and Urban Development\n\n(HUD) Entitlement funds and currently receives allocations from the Community Development Block\n\nGrant (CDBG), Home Investment Partnership Program (HOME), and Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG)\n\nprograms. Sioux City is the lead agency within the Sioux City Consortium (which also includes South\n\nSioux City, NE and Dakota City, NE), which is a recipient of HOME funds. Since ﬁscal year 2010, the\n\nSioux City Consortium’s HOME allocation has decreased by approximately 35%. In addition, Sioux City\n\nhas seen a 28% decrease in CDBG funds since 2010.\n\nSUPPORT REQUESTED\n\nThe Sioux City Consortium requests support to restore the funding of the HOME program to the 2010\n\nlevel. The signiﬁcant reductions in HOME funding has had a detrimental effect with regard to creating and\n\nmaintaining affordable housing in the Siouxland area. Restoring the funding level of HOME to the 2010\n\nlevel would allow for additional safe and affordable housing units to be available to hundreds of families in\n\nSioux City and South Sioux City, Nebraska.\n\nIn addition, the City of Sioux City requests support to restore the funding of the CDBG program to the\n\n2010 level. CDBG is critical to providing funding for public improvements, public services, economic\n\ndevelopment, and affordable housing. CDBG provides the City of Sioux City with the ﬂexibility needed to\n\ndevelop essential programs and projects to assist low income individuals and families.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe HOME Investment Partnership Program has been active within the Sioux City Consortium\n\nsince 1995. Since then, HOME has funded down payment assistance programs, the construction of\n\nnew rental units, the construction of new owner-occupied units, Tenant Based Rental Assistance\n\n(TBRA), and a security deposit assistance program. In the last ten years, approximately $4 million\n\nin HOME funds has been invested into the creation of 2,649 units of affordable housing in Sioux City.\n\nIf the level of cuts to HOME continue, the ability to create affordable housing units in our community would\n\nbe greatly diminished. Sioux City has recently seen an increased need with regard to affordable housing\n\ndue to recent economic development success in the area. HOME is a vital resource in the creation of\n\ndesperately needed housing units.\n\nThe City of Sioux City has administered a successful CDBG program since 1974. Over the last 40+ years,\n\nthousands of families have received assistance through housing rehabilitation programs. In addition to\n\nserving the low income population, funds speciﬁcally target the elderly and disabled. These programs\n\ntruly make a difference in the lives of those who need it most. In addition, the housing investment ensures\n\nthat the units will be maintained and will be available for future generations of people who choose to live\n\nand work in Sioux City. Further cuts to CDBG would be devastating to the City of Sioux City. If a ﬂawed\n\nformula from a study that did not consider all potential costs found that the overwhelming majority of Public\n\nHousing Authorities (PHAs) were underfunded, then clearly the current levels of administrative fee funding\n\nare not acceptable. These low levels of funding have forced PHAs to lay off staff, enact hiring freezes, and\n\nimpose furloughs, resulting in increased caseload sizes and straining PHAs’ ability to remain in compliance\n\nwith the myriad HUD regulations. These low funding levels also have consequences for the low-income\n\nfamilies the voucher program serves, including a reduction in the level of services provided to participants.\n\nAUTHOR(S)\n\nJill M. Wanderscheid, Neighborhood Services Manager, City of Sioux City, IA, [email protected],\n\n712.224.5136\n\n3\n\n62nd Annual Siouxland/Washington Conference\n\nSECTION 8 HOUSING CHOICE VOUCHER FUNDING CUTS\n\nISSUE\n\nThe City of Sioux City is a recipient of United States Department of Housing and Urban Development\n\n(HUD) funds for the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher Program. Administrative fees to operate the\n\nprogram continue to be insufﬁcient to operate the program. With unemployment levels hovering around\n\n3.5%, housing becomes a critical factor in recruiting a skilled workforce.\n\nSUPPORT REQUESTED\n\nThe Sioux City Housing Authority requests support to adequately fund Section 8 administrative fees by\n\nrestoring the proration to 100% and streamlining the time-intensive details and administrative burdens of\n\nthe voucher program. The downward spiral of the administrative fees needs to be stopped and brought\n\nback to appropriate levels to effectively manage the administratively-intense Section 8 Housing Choice\n\nVoucher Program.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nHUD’s Section 8 programs help to form the backbone of HUD’s housing assistance programs. They are an\n\nessential component in helping to provide low-income American families with access to affordable housing.\n\nThe Housing Choice Voucher Program, the largest program in the Section 8 family of programs, provides\n\nrental assistance to nearly 2.2 million low-income families to rent privately-owned units in the location of\n\ntheir choosing. In addition to the large number of people served, the Housing Choice Voucher program\n\nalso serves a wide variety of program participants including families, seniors, persons with disabilities,\n\nhouseholds displaced by disasters, homeless veterans, and children aging out of the foster care system.\n\nBoth the size of the program and the diverse populations that the program serves make it critical that\n\nCongress highly prioritize the Housing Choice Voucher Program when making funding decisions.\n\nFunding for the Housing Choice Voucher Program is appropriated through two accounts. In addition to\n\nthe pass-through grants that Public Housing Authorities (PHAs) send to landlords on behalf of program\n\nparticipants (known as Housing Assistance Payments), Congress also funds an account for administrative\n\nfees to support the operations of the program. Essentially, HUD reimburses PHAs for the costs of\n\nadministering the program for each family under lease. While Congress has provided adequate funding\n\nfor the vouchers themselves in recent years (in FY 2016 Congress fully funded this Housing Assistance\n\nPayments Account), the administrative fee funding to reimburse PHAs for the costs they have incurred has\n\nfallen to dangerously inadequate levels.\n\nThere is empirical evidence showing that the administrative fee is funded at a much too low level. In the\n\nsummer of 2015, HUD published the Housing Choice Voucher Program Administrative Fee Study. The\n\nstudy measured the costs of running an efﬁcient Housing Choice Voucher Program and then proposed a\n\nnew administrative fee formula. While the National Association of Housing and Redevelopment Ofﬁcials\n\n(NAHRO) believes that there are ﬂaws in the study that led to a formula that undervalues the true cost of\n\nrunning a Housing Choice Voucher Program, even this study that undervalues the true cost of running a\n\nvoucher program found that Congress underfunded the administrative fee during the study period. The\n\nstudy found that 92% of PHAs were underfunded during the study period of July 1, 2013 through June 30,\n\n2014.\n\nIf a ﬂawed formula from a study that did not consider all potential costs found that the overwhelming\n\nmajority of PHAs were underfunded, then clearly the current levels of administrative fee funding are not\n\nacceptable. These low levels of funding have forced PHAs to lay off staff, enact hiring freezes, and impose\n\nfurloughs, resulting in increased caseload sizes and straining PHAs’ ability to remain in compliance with\n\nthe myriad of HUD regulations. These low funding levels also have consequences for the low-income\n\nfamilies the voucher program serves, including a reduction in the level of services provided to participants.\n\nIn 2015, Sioux City Housing Authority reduced stafﬁng levels by one full-time position, and caseloads\n\nincreased 33%.\n\n4\n\n62nd Annual Siouxland/Washington Conference\n\nThe Sioux City Housing Authority serves approximately 1,200 families in Sioux City under the Section 8\n\nHousing Choice Voucher Program with an annual budget of approximately $5 million. Housing assistance\n\npayments to landlords participating in the rental assistance program alone add about $355,000 to the local\n\neconomy every month. Ongoing reductions in administrative fees below the 100% proration will adversely\n\nimpact the City of Sioux City’s staff in administration of the Section 8 Program. We will ﬁnd it necessary\n\nto reduce additional critical staff that carry out program activities and keep Sioux City in compliance with\n\nall applicable laws and regulations, and citizen and participation requirements. Shortfalls in administrative\n\nfee funding can lead to staff reductions that negatively impact the ability of families to utilize the Section\n\n8 Program. Reductions in stafﬁng will not allow us to respond appropriately to the need. The cost of\n\nadministering the Section 8 Program has been on the rise, with contributing factors including higher\n\npostage and employee health care costs. In every year since 2004, Congress has provided administrative\n\nfees that were at least 6% lower than the 2003 rate. 9%, or 4 out of 44, PHAs in Iowa have transferred their\n\nvouchers to another entity because they can no longer afford to administer the program.\n\nThe City of Sioux City is a member of the Iowa Chapter of the National Association of Housing and\n\nRedevelopment Ofﬁcials (INAHRO). INAHRO supports measures to streamline the operating environment\n\nin which PHAs operate. Until such time as adequate funding is restored, PHAs should not be held to\n\nunattainable standards. Section 8 Management Assessment Program scores should be made advisory\n\nto reﬂect the imbalance between resources and requirements. It is important to note that Veterans Affairs\n\nSupportive Housing (VASH) Program is a highly staff-intensive program that serves homeless veterans\n\nand receives the same administrative fees to meet the regulatory intensive demands. If prorations continue\n\nto be required, relief of some of the numerous administrative duties needs to come quickly. Section 8\n\nprograms must be reformed now, especially with funding reductions as drastic and severe as we have\n\nwitnessed.\n\nAUTHOR(S)\n\nAmy Tooley, Housing Services Division Manager, City of Sioux City, IA, [email protected],\n\n712.279.6980\n\n5\n\n62nd Annual Siouxland/Washington Conference\n\nWORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT THROUGH CAREER & TECHNICAL EDUCATION\n\nISSUE\n\nThirteen million students are enrolled in Career and Technical Education programs in nearly 13,000 public\n\nhigh schools. In the Sioux City Community School District nearly 5,000 students annually earn over\n\n16,000 college credits through rigorous career and technical programs in a Career Academy structure\n\nfocused on college and workforce development. Today’s increasingly global society requires American\n\npublic schools to equip their students with a set of skills that is far more sophisticated and advanced\n\nthan what was required in the manufacturing-based economy of 50 years ago. Speciﬁcally, the 21st\n\nCentury economy demands greater knowledge and more complex computational, communication, and\n\ntechnological skills of its workforce.\n\nThe reauthorization of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act, which was scheduled for\n\n2013 yet has not been voted on, provides Congress with a critical opportunity to reinforce the importance\n\nof effective high-quality Career and Technical Education (CTE) programs in schools that are aligned with\n\ncollege and career readiness standards, as well as the needs of employers, industry and labor. We\n\nbelieve there are provisions in the current Perkins Act that must be sustained in any reauthorization,\n\nbut we also believe changes must be made to the legislation in order to maintain a highly-qualiﬁed and\n\nprepared workforce.\n\nSUPPORT REQUESTED\n\nWe enjoy robust Career Academy program offerings for our students in high school in our local community.\n\nThese offerings are only possible through the partnerships with other organizations such as Western Iowa\n\nTech, our local businesses and industries, the Siouxland Chamber of Commerce, and the community.\n\nThe overarching purpose of our Career Academy High School is to improve high school graduation rates,\n\nimprove post-secondary planning, and develop successful citizens through workforce development. Our\n\nefforts are showing progress: the Sioux City Community School District boasts one of the highest graduation\n\nrates of urban schools in the state of Iowa, with a graduation rate of nearly 90%, and a corresponding\n\ndropout rate of only 1.85%. While we offer programs in all 16 federally-recognized career pathways, none\n\nof this would be possible without the funding through the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education\n\nAct. We urge our tri-state members of Congress to:\n\n• Maintain the current basic state grant funding formula for the distribution of funds to states and local\n\nschool districts and appropriately fund the basic state grant program.\n\n• Leave the Perkins funding streams allocated for K-12 institutions and higher education institutions\n\nseparate.\n\n• Oppose any changes to Perkins funding that would mandate set-asides to be used for competitive\n\ngrants.\n\n• Support efforts in the next reauthorization to incentivize local school districts to partner more closely\n\nwith industry and the business community.\n\n• Support a requirement that every local education agency or a consortia of districts that share career\n\nand technical education programs form a higher education and economic development council.\n\n• Support the creation of a new funding stream that would ensure districts can offer career planning and\n\ncounseling to all students.\n\n• Create, through the reauthorization, programming that assesses the quality of a CTE program based\n\non the following measures: academic skill attainment in reading/math, technical skill attainment,\n\ngraduation rate, and secondary placement.\n\nIn conclusion, we believe every adolescent should graduate from high school prepared for college or a\n\nfulﬁlling career, but Congress must increase the federal investment in career and technical education\n\nprograms as well as make important changes to the Perkins Act to accomplish this goal. We are committed\n\nto doing everything in our power to ensure all young people can be college and career ready.\n\nAUTHOR(S)\n\nDr. Paul Gausman, Superintendent, Sioux City Community School District, [email protected],\n\n712.279.6643\n\n6\n\n62nd Annual Siouxland/Washington Conference\n\n185th AIR REFUELING WING (ARW)\n\nREADY FOR NEXT GENERATION MID-AIR REFUELING TANKER\n\nISSUE\n\nThe Iowa Air National Guard strategic plan seeks to ensure the 185th Air Refueling Wing (ARW) is positioned\n\nwell for the next generation of Aerial Refueling Tanker, the KC-46A Pegasus. The 185th ARW has desirable\n\nmanpower, facilities and experience needed to modernize its tanker to the next generation.\n\nThe wing has been ﬂying the KC-135R Stratotanker since 2003. The 185th ARW remains the unit to\n\nemulate for superior performance and is recognized throughout the Air National Guard for their successes.\n\nBelow are a few of the prestigious awards the 185th ARW has received:\n\n2014 Air Force Outstanding Unit Award (8th award received)\n\n2013 AMC KC-135 Fuel Efﬁciency Award\n\n2011 Airlift Tanker Association Outstanding Unit Award\n\n2009 Distinguished Flying Unit Recipient\n\n2008 Metcalf Trophy for Best Heavy Aircraft Unit\n\nSUPPORT REQUESTED\n\nThe 185th ARW is currently active and fully engaged with the country’s military priorities worldwide. We\n\nurge our tri-state Congressional delegation to support the modernization of the 185th ARW aircraft with the\n\nnew KC-46 to keep them on the leading technological edge.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe mission of the 185th ARW is to provide rapid, global mobility and sustainment for America’s armed\n\nforces while ensuring air refueling support of the national strategic mission. The 185th ARW also plays a\n\ncrucial role in providing humanitarian, state and national disaster response.\n\nLast year, the 185th ARW in Sioux City deployed more than 320 Airmen serving in nine countries in support\n\nof the U.S. Central Command and Paciﬁc Command. The 185th ARW has always been 100+% manned\n\nwith members bursting with a Midwest work ethic. The base is strategically positioned in the middle of the\n\ncountry with easy access to both coasts and beyond, providing global support for all U.S. and coalition\n\nforces.\n\nThe 185th ARW is leading the way in the KC-135 community. The hard work and dedication of the unit was\n\nproven when they were awarded their 8th Air Force Outstanding Unit Award. The award was given to units\n\nthat have distinguished themselves by exceptionally-meritorious service that clearly sets them apart from\n\nother Air National Guard bases. Their successes make them ideal to take on a more modern airframe,\n\nsuch as the KC-46 Pegasus, KC-Y, and/or other mission sets.\n\nOver the past year the 185th ARW annual payroll was $51,543,900 and annual expenditures of $6,767,500.\n\nThe base employed 398 full-time members and 849 traditional guardsmen last year. Additionally, they\n\nprovide $1,429,400 in assistance and bonuses to Airmen for betterment of their education. Using a\n\nstandard Air Force formula places the annual value of indirect jobs created at $11,010,300 for a total\n\neconomic impact of $70,751,100 in ﬁscal year 2015.\n\nThe 185th ARW is accessible, responsive, and capable of taking on the challenge of the next generation of\n\naerial refueling tankers and other mission sets.\n\nAUTHOR(S)\n\nCol. Lawrence L. Christensen, Wing Commander, 185th Air Refueling Wing,\n\n[email protected], 712.233.0502\n\n7\n\n62nd Annual Siouxland/Washington Conference\n\nEPA’S WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES RULE &\n\nWATER QUALITY ISSUES\n\nISSUE\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently issued a ﬁnal rule signiﬁcantly expanding the\n\ndeﬁnition of “Waters of the United States” (WOTUS) under the Clean Water Act. The WOTUS rule\n\nwould grant the EPA regulatory authority far beyond the limits approved by Congress, and would impose\n\nsigniﬁcant burdens and uncertainty on many groups in the Siouxland area, including industry, agriculture,\n\nand municipal utilities. We urge our congressional delegation to support any legislative effort to block the\n\nWOTUS rule.\n\nAt the same time, the nation is confronting various water quality issues, including excessive nutrient loads.\n\nSUPPORT REQUESTED\n\nWe urge the tri-state delegation to support the many ongoing, voluntary efforts to address these issues,\n\nincluding appropriating funds to help them succeed.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe WOTUS rule expands EPA’s jurisdiction over waters and land uses beyond what Congress intended\n\nand beyond the limits of the Clean Water Act as interpreted by the Supreme Court. Moreover, the WOTUS\n\nrule was ﬁnalized without the EPA conducting the required regulatory impact analyses and without\n\nappropriately consulting with states and other affected stakeholders.\n\nIt is, therefore, not surprising that more than half of the states and numerous stakeholder organizations\n\nhave ﬁled lawsuits challenging the WOTUS rule. Two separate federal courts have already determined that\n\nthe WOTUS rule may be unlawful and have imposed injunctions temporarily blocking its implementation.\n\nBut these injunctions could be lifted. As long as the WOTUS rule remains on the books, businesses of all\n\nsizes, as well as state and local governments, will suffer the regulatory uncertainty from the rule itself and\n\nfrom the ongoing litigation.\n\nCongress has tried to stop the EPA’s overreaching WOTUS rule through legislation and passage of\n\nresolutions under the Congressional Review Act. Unfortunately, these attempts have failed. In order to\n\nprevent the WOTUS rule and corresponding regulatory uncertainty from further harming the economy, we\n\nurge the Siouxland delegation to support any future legislation Congress may propose to block the rule.\n\nWe further recognize that there are water quality issues facing the nation, including excess nutrients in\n\nour waters. Nutrient runoff from agriculture contributes to the annual “dead zone” in the Gulf of Mexico—\n\nan area of low oxygen caused by excess nutrients, making it difﬁcult for marine life to survive. Excess\n\nnutrients have also contributed to algal blooms across the country (such as the annual algal bloom in Lake\n\nErie) and have required municipal water utilities to expend resources to ensure that the nation’s drinking\n\nwater complies with federal standards.\n\nWe support the many voluntary efforts currently underway in the Siouxland region to improve water quality.\n\nA wide range of stakeholders—including industry associations, local and state governments, farmers, and\n\nindustry—have launched programs to address nutrient runoff by, among other things, providing farmers\n\nwith the technical and ﬁnancial assistance to implement conservation practices. Nutrient loss is a large-\n\nscale problem, and it will take all of these groups working together to solve it. We encourage the Siouxland\n\ndelegation to support these efforts to boost water quaity in any way, including through the appropriations\n\nprocess.\n\n8\n\n62nd Annual Siouxland/Washington Conference\n\nFurthermore, Congress reduced funding in the 2014 Farm Bill for the conservation programs used by\n\nAmerica’s farmers by nearly $6 billion over the next ten years. These programs cannot be sustained with\n\nfurther reductions. We urge the Siouxland delegation to support the $860.374 million funding level outlined\n\nin the President’s FY17 budget proposal for the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service’s (NRCS)\n\nConservation Operations account. This program supports the critical work of conservation districts in\n\nenlisting land owners and operators to participate in voluntary conservation practices that ensure clean\n\nwater, healthy soils, and other vital beneﬁts on which the public relies each day.\n\nAUTHOR(S)\n\nRicky J.

Bud Day Field has a $218 million local economic impact. It is imperative that\n\nwe continue to have commercial air service to support economic development, business retention, and\n\nfuture growth of our community. The Sioux Gateway Airport Board of Trustees, City of Sioux City, and the\n\nSiouxland Chamber of Commerce are continuing efforts to attract additional service, expand the number\n\nof ﬂights, and add an additional hub to accommodate those ﬂiers that need to go west from Sioux City.\n\nSioux City has been dependent on the Essential Air Service (EAS) program to provide basic service since\n\n2012. Beginning May 1, 2016, however, we were able to secure commercial air service without the need\n\nfor the EAS program through the competitive proposal process. The EAS program continued to provide\n\ncommercial service while our community was able to show the local demand and ultimate successful\n\ntransition to a no subsidy service.\n\nCongress will be considering a new Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reauthorization bill this year and\n\nit is important that the Essential Air Service program is included and fully funded for the current airports\n\nthat depend on the EAS program to retain commercial air service. We successfully secured commercial\n\nair service because of the EAS program.\n\nSUPPORT REQUESTED\n\nThe Sioux Gateway Airport Board of Trustees, City of Sioux City, and Siouxland Chamber of Commerce\n\nrecommend continued support of the EAS program. As Congress looks at reauthorization for the coming\n\nyear, we ask that the EAS program budget be maintained at sufﬁcient levels to meet the current contract\n\nobligations and that no new restrictions are added that would eliminate the Sioux Gateway Airport from\n\nbeing eligible for the program. It is important to view Sioux City as a success and also to maintain the\n\nprogram if needed in the future.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe tri-state community has always supported the Sioux Gateway Airport/Col. Bud Day Field as the\n\nregional airport.\n\nOn October 14, 2011, two airlines submitted competitive bids for the Sioux City service, and American\n\nEagle Airlines was selected by the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) to provide EAS service to\n\nChicago with two ﬂights per day using 44-seat and 50-seat regional jets. American Eagle began service\n\non April 3, 2012 under the EAS program. The USDOT contract was for two years; however, it included\n\na waiver of the hold-in requirements that allows American Eagle to leave this market if they give written\n\nnotice to the USDOT. If American Eagle discontinued service, USDOT would be required to go back\n\nthrough the Request for Proposal (RFP) process under the EAS program to get a new service provider.\n\nThe contract was for $1.5 million per year for two years.\n\nUnder the current EAS contract, the USDOT asked for proposals that were due in December 2012 for the\n\nnext two-year contract beginning April 2014. Bids were received from American Eagle Airlines ($611,000)\n\nand United Airlines ($1.4 million). We believe the lower proposed cost for these next two years indicates\n\nhow successful the service has been and that the EAS program is working to help bridge the gap for air\n\nservice in Sioux City.\n\nAmerican Eagle has shown their ability to build service in other EAS markets and has been successful\n\nin eliminating the need for EAS in those markets. During the past few years prior to 2011, enplanements\n\nhad been declining at Sioux Gateway Airport, but the 2011 enplanement numbers showed a substantial\n\nincrease over 2010 and enplanements remained strong in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015. This increase\n\nin enplanements is indicative of the demand for service from Sioux City to other areas of the country.\n\nAverage load factors have also been higher for the past four years since American Eagle began service\n\nto Chicago.\n\n10\n\n62nd Annual Siouxland/Washington Conference\n\nAccess to the EAS program ensured our ability to retain air service while we worked with American Airlines\n\nto build our market and to become self-supporting, eliminating our need for the EAS program. Currently\n\nSioux City has the second lowest per passenger subsidy at $12 of all the EAS communities (subject to the\n\n$200 per passenger subsidy cap).\n\nThe most recent EAS program bids were due November 5, 2015 for a two-year contract to begin May 1,\n\n2016. United Airlines submitted a bid of $324,159 and American Airlines bid $1,261,601. American then\n\nnotiﬁed the USDOT they would continue ﬂying without subsidy beginning May 1, 2016, which ended the\n\ncompetitive bid process. American Airlines currently provides twice daily service to Chicago and will add\n\na daily ﬂight to Dallas/Fort Worth beginning May 5, 2016.\n\nAUTHOR(S)\n\nMike Collett, Assistant City Manager, City of Sioux City, IA, [email protected], 712.279.0170\n\n11\n\n62nd Annual Siouxland/Washington Conference\n\nFEDERAL DEFICIT REDUCTION\n\nISSUE\n\nThe federal government does not have a strategic plan which is continuously adhered to, to decrease the\n\nfederal deﬁcit.\n\nSUPPORT REQUESTED\n\nThe Siouxland delegation asks that Congress put in place a strategy to decrease the federal deﬁcit by\n\ncreating a surplus. More accountable spending should be expected, and the federal deﬁcit’s ceiling should\n\nnot be as ﬂuid as it has been in years past. Once a strategy is in place to reduce the deﬁcit, it is imperative\n\nthat the strategy is followed and the true deﬁnition of the deﬁcit not changed.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nMany elected ofﬁcials, department heads and economists talk about the federal budget and the federal\n\ndeﬁcit. The talking points used by individuals and groups have varying facts and ﬁgures creating arguments\n\nover what should or should not be included in the debate over the federal budget and the federal deﬁcit.\n\nThe federal budget should include all actual expenditures and all actual revenues. This would allow for\n\nmore transparency and accountability of what is spent and received. This accountability would create a\n\ngenuine target number on whether each budget continues to expand the debt or helps reduce the debt.\n\nStates, cities, and even families are including all expenditures and all revenues while ﬁguring out their\n\nbudgets.\n\nAs of February 12, 2016, the current outstanding debt is over $19,014,913,300,000, a staggering $159,000\n\nper taxpayer according to the U.S. Department of Treasury. Most recently, President Obama has submitted\n\nhis FY17 budget request that would increase the national debt by another $4.1 trillion. Currently, the way\n\nto gauge the amount of the federal deﬁcit is based on semantic choices on how to label government\n\nreceipts and payments. Governmental agencies and departments do not use uniform and consistent\n\nlanguage when rolling out economic policies. Different years and various ofﬁces overseeing the budget\n\nmay choose to refer to receipts by labeling it taxes or loans. Income from interest earned or the principal\n\nitself in a government account may be spent to cover an expenditure or payment, and these monetary\n\ntransfers may not be accounted for as actual spending. This phraseology juggling allows a wide range of\n\ninconsistent numbers to be reported as the federal deﬁcit throughout the years.\n\nIn order to clearly understand the federal deﬁcit, the government needs to deﬁne the federal deﬁcit so that\n\nit includes every type of expenditure and then insist that this one deﬁnition be used exclusively throughout\n\nall budgeting processes. The current reported debt of over $19 trillion does not include every type of\n\nexpenditure, and the number would substantially grow if all expenditures were added. In 2000 the reported\n\nnational debt was just over $5.6 trillion and by 2014 this number had tripled. The government applauds\n\nitself when they create less of a deﬁcit than the previous year. Creating a budget with a smaller deﬁcit than\n\nthe preceding year is not the answer. Spending more than what was received still increases the overall\n\ndeﬁcit. The only way to reduce the overall federal deﬁcit is to create a surplus.\n\nOnce the actual overall receipts and payments are included in the federal budget, this could create an\n\nimproved understanding of the federal deﬁcit’s exact size. More accountable spending should be expected,\n\nand the federal deﬁcit’s ceiling should not be as ﬂuid as it has been in years past. Once a strategy is in\n\nplace to reduce the deﬁcit, it is imperative that the strategy is followed throughout the budgeting process\n\nand the true deﬁnition of the deﬁcit is not changed.\n\nAUTHOR(S)\n\nJim Johnson, President, Taxpayers Research Council, [email protected], 712.252.5859\n\nTaylor Goodvin, Executive Director, Taxpayers Research Council, [email protected], 712.252.5859\n\n12\n\n62nd Annual Siouxland/Washington Conference\n\nHEALTH CARE PROVIDERS PRIORITIES\n\nISSUE\n\nThe implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) continues to carry a high proﬁle across the country\n\nand in Siouxland. The issues presented in this paper are those of the health care delivery system providers\n\nwho are members of the Siouxland Chamber of Commerce.\n\nSiouxland providers have in good faith and with full effort worked diligently to transition policies, procedures\n\nand practices to comply with the ACA. The issues presented in this paper are primarily focused on\n\nlegislative or regulatory changes that are necessary as we continue to redesign the delivery and payer\n\nsystems.\n\nSUPPORT REQUESTED\n\nThe health care provider members of the Siouxland Chamber of Commerce respectfully asks Congress\n\nto address the following issues:\n\n• Continue efforts to address backlog of Recovery Account Audit (RAC) audit appeals\n\nRecent adjustments in the RAC process reducing the number of reviews from 2% to 0.5% is a positive\n\nstep for providers. The backlog of RAC appeals ﬁled by providers continues to be extensive with some\n\nestimates as high as 800,000. The providers in Siouxland understand the pressures to be accountable\n\non accuracy and completeness of Medicare claims and share the concerns of Congress to stem, if not\n\neliminate, fraud and abuse. At the same time providers have little to no recourse for timely resolution\n\nof errors made by the RAC auditors and to be paid on contested claims.\n\n• Continue support of Community Health Centers\n\nAs the Siouxland Community Health Center celebrates its 25th anniversary of service, we ask Congress\n\nto eliminate the continued threat of “the funding cliff.” In April 2015, Congress approved H.R. 2, the\n\nMedicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, which extended Health Centers’ mandatory\n\nfunding for another two years. We are now one year away from the expiration of that legislation, and\n\nwe would encourage Congress to resolve the Community Health Center funding issue before the law\n\nis allowed to expire.\n\nThe Siouxland Community Health Center has become a critical provider of health care in our region.\n\nMore than 27,000 patients from our tri-state area have made the Community Health Center their\n\nmedical home. The focus on care of the underserved is central to the mission of the Siouxland\n\nCommunity Health Center, and we would urge Congress to avoid the scenario witnessed in 2015 that\n\nwould have slashed Health Center budgets by nearly 70%.\n\n• Two midnight rule\n\nThe premise of the two midnight rule as a determinant for inpatient Medicare payments has been\n\nﬂawed from the outset. Recent changes to consider the two midnight rule on a case-by-case basis is\n\na step in the right direction. Born out of the RAC process and not out of medical necessity for inpatient\n\ntreatment as determined by the attending physician, the two midnight rule should be eliminated as a\n\nrequirement for inpatient payment. As payment methodologies migrate to Provider Risk Based Plans\n\nsuch as the Next Generation Accountable Care Organization (ACO), the necessity of the two midnight\n\nrule is even less valid.\n\n13\n\n62nd Annual Siouxland/Washington Conference\n\n• STARK law revision (also known as the physician self-referral law)\n\nThe STARK law was passed to prevent fraud and abuse in the Fee for Service or volume-based\n\npayment system of traditional Medicare. With the advancement of value-based purchasing and\n\nProvider Based Risk programming, it is critical that physicians, hospitals, and all other partners in the\n\nnew delivery model can work openly together to achieve highest quality patient outcomes at the lowest\n\npossible cost of care. Providers who are participants in an alternative payment methodology and who\n\nshare ﬁnancial risk in the patient’s care and outcomes should be excluded from STARK restrictions.\n\nAUTHOR(S)\n\nJames Fitzpatrick, CEO, Mercy Medical Center, james.ﬁ[email protected], 712.279.2297\n\nStacy Harmelink, Administrator, Midlands Clinic, [email protected], 605.217.5550\n\nGreg Miner, CEO, Dunes Surgical Hospital, [email protected], 605.232.3332\n\nDavid Smetter, Vice President, Mercy Medical Center, [email protected], 712.279.2915\n\nMike Stiles, Chancellor, St. Luke’s College, [email protected], 712.279.3148\n\nKaren Van De Steeg, Executive Director, Health Inc., [email protected], 712.252.9301\n\nJim Wharton, Director, Siouxland Community Health Center, [email protected], 712.224.1815\n\nLynn Wold, President & CEO, UnityPoint Health - St. Luke’s, [email protected], 712.279.3632\n\n14\n\n62nd Annual Siouxland/Washington Conference\n\nIMMIGRATION REFORM\n\nISSUE\n\nDespite emerging as one of the most divisive and frequently partisan issues of the day, there appears to\n\nbe broad consensus that the current immigration system in the United States is deeply ﬂawed and may\n\nbe irreparably broken. So polarized and entrenched have the parties advocating opposing positions on\n\nthis issue become that even the use of the labels “illegal aliens” and “undocumented immigrants” have\n\nbeen perceived as political posturing. Furthermore, while the actual number of impacted immigrants is\n\nunknown, estimates vary considerably from 11.7 million1 “undocumented immigrants” to 18-20 million2\n\n“illegal aliens.”\n\nSUPPORT REQUESTED\n\nThe Siouxland Chamber of Commerce recognizes that our immigration system is defective. In order to ﬁx\n\nthe problem, a comprehensive, rational approach to immigration reform is needed. While the debate rages\n\nregarding how to address this issue, we believe that the federal government’s longstanding stalemate and\n\ninaction must be replaced with a constructive dialogue aimed at achieving consensus and resolving this\n\nmatter for all concerned, including immigrants, families, employers, government agencies, etc. We believe\n\na solution that is equitable, balanced, meets the needs of our growing economy, and passes the test of\n\ncommon sense is required.\n\nTherefore, we respectfully urge our tri-state Congressional delegation to continue to work with other\n\nMembers of Congress, as well as the Obama Administration, which should not be acting unilaterally, to\n\nﬁnd a viable and permanent solution to this divisive issue.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nWe urge Congress to work together to ﬁx our immigration system by ﬁnding common ground and common\n\nsense solutions that address meaningful immigration reform. A comprehensive approach to immigration\n\nshould include embracing and enforcing a system that functions efﬁciently for employers, workers, and\n\ngovernment agencies; further develops a reliable, accurate, efﬁcient and modern employment eligibility\n\nveriﬁcation system (E-verify); ensures that all workers enjoy the same labor law protections; addresses\n\nborder security; examines the impact to the public education system; enforces the laws; considers raising\n\nthe cap on H-1B visas; streamlines the process for hiring highly-skilled workers; and evaluates the future\n\neconomic needs for workers, as well as addresses the status of immigrants who are currently living and/\n\nor working in the United States in violation of federal law.\n\nAUTHOR(S)\n\nBarbara M.

IDEA was last reauthorized in\n\n2004. As this legislation was being developed, national groups successfully promoted signiﬁcant changes\n\nthat shifted program emphasis from complying with legal requirements to improving education outcomes\n\nand accountability for all students. Although federal legislation initially promised to provide 40% of the\n\nexcess cost to educate students with disabilities, all appropriations have fallen short, leaving states and\n\nlocal school districts to make up the difference. It is important that the reauthorized IDEA also include\n\nexpectations of appropriation to fully fund the 40% of excess cost to educate all students with disabilities.\n\nIDEA had been scheduled for reauthorization in 2011, but reauthorization appears to be delayed until 2016\n\nor even later.\n\nSUPPORT REQUESTED\n\nWe recommend a strategic approach to reauthorization of IDEA with a strong emphasis on improved\n\neducation outcomes for students with disabilities. In preparation for the next IDEA reauthorization, we urge\n\nour tri-state Members of Congress to:\n\n• Support legislation that recognizes the authority of local school boards.\n\n• Oppose unnecessary, burdensome, and costly reporting and data collection requirements related to\n\nIDEA Reauthorization and other related bills.\n\n• Engage our state associations in providing opportunities for local school boards to identify issues of\n\nconcern and offer recommendations for modiﬁcations to the current law.\n\n• Fully fund the 40% of excess cost to educate students with disabilities.\n\nDuring the last reauthorization in 2004, the IDEA leaders had excellent bipartisan support in Congress\n\nthat helped negotiate ﬁnal language. We ask for that same bipartisan support and work toward successful\n\nchanges to shift the program emphasis from legal processes to improving education outcomes and\n\naccountability for all students.\n\nIt is imperative that appropriations match the needs through IDEA reauthorization. Districts have long\n\nstruggled since the original authorization and reauthorization of IDEA, and are using local tax dollars to\n\ncover the burdens required by the federal government under the law. Please consider full funding of the\n\nfederal expectations as a part of reauthorization.\n\nAUTHOR(S)\n\nDr. Rod Earleywine, Superintendent, Sergeant Bluff-Luton Community School District (IA), [email protected],\n\n712.943.8787\n\nDr. Vernon Fisher, Superintendent, South Sioux City Community Schools (NE), [email protected], 402.404.1277\n\nDr. Paul Gausman, Superintendent, Sioux City Community School District (IA), [email protected],\n\n712.279.6643\n\nAl Leber, Superintendent, Dakota Valley School District (SD), [email protected], 605.422.3800\n\n16\n\n62nd Annual Siouxland/Washington Conference\n\nSIOUXLAND’S PUBLIC & NOT-FOR-PROFIT HIGHER EDUCATION PRIORITIES\n\nISSUE\n\nThe Siouxland region is blessed with a rich diversity of post-secondary education options for our citizenry.\n\nResidents of Siouxland can choose between publicly-funded community colleges, private not-for-proﬁt\n\nresidential liberal arts colleges, a private not-for-proﬁt specialized nursing and health science college, a\n\ntribal college, as well as publicly-funded and state-operated colleges and universities.\n\nWorkforce development is a priority for business and industry throughout the tri-state area. The legislative\n\nand regulatory priorities and concerns of this rich mixture of colleges and universities are all linked to and\n\nfully aligned with workforce development.\n\nSUPPORT REQUESTED\n\n• We continue to support reauthorization of the Higher Education Act.\n\n• We support year-round Pell. We recognize and acknowledge that many of today’s students are seeking\n\nyear-round programs of study to allow them to complete their education and enter the workforce as\n\nsoon as possible. We also recognize and acknowledge that many of today’s students are second\n\ncareer or non-traditional students who are working full time while enrolling part time year round to\n\nadvance their career. Year-round Pell will better serve these students.\n\n• Student debt concerns our institutions and our local governing boards. We believe that costs are best\n\nmanaged by our local boards, in our local markets and will continue to reﬂect our respective missions\n\nand curriculums.\n\n• We ask Congress to not support or act on the concept of “Institutional Risk Sharing” that would require\n\ncolleges to put up ﬁnancial guarantees on student loans. Such an action could add signiﬁcant ﬁnancial\n\nburden on colleges and drive up the cost of tuition as colleges have no other source to fund such\n\nguarantees or to pay penalties on defaulted student loans. Today’s students are highly mobile and\n\nmany transfer from college to college with their debt following them to the last college attended. This\n\nburdens the student’s last college of attendance with debt or default exposure accumulated at one or\n\nmore other institutions and artiﬁcially inﬂates the risk of the last college attended.\n\n• We continue to be concerned about intended or unintended regulatory burden and urge caution and\n\nrestraint in adding new requirements on colleges and universities, particularly those that will add cost\n\nwith little or no direct impact on student learner outcomes and workforce development.\n\n• We support voluntary accreditation and value accreditation’s core function of ensuring educational\n\nquality. Regional accreditors embrace the diversity of post-secondary institution’s missions,\n\ngovernance, funding and teaching models while focusing on assuring learner outcomes are pertinent\n\nto the student’s chosen discipline and degree level. We are concerned that a federal regulator will not\n\nequally embrace institutional diversity and autonomy.\n\nAPPRECIATION NOTED\n\n• We are pleased that the U.S. Department of Education (DOE) scorecard as implemented did not result\n\nin a single metric, rating or ranking. We continue to support public accountability and transparency\n\nas an obligation to the taxpayer who funds the federal ﬁnancial aid programs that our students are\n\ndependent upon.\n\n• We are pleased that the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) and the IRA Charitable Rollover\n\nwere made permanent in the Omnibus Tax and Appropriations Act that also fully funded Pell, restored\n\nfunding for Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants (SEOG) and Federal Work Study.\n\nAUTHOR(S)\n\nMike Stiles, Chancellor, St. Luke’s College, [email protected], 712.279.3148\n\nDr. Michael R.

Embrace pro-small-business tax laws that\n\npromote business growth and make working pay.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nFederal tax law needs to focus on small business growth, on making working better than not working for\n\nall able-bodied persons, and on building the economy. These tax policies need to be enacted or retained.\n\nIncome Tax\n\nNo changes to individual or corporate income tax law that increase tax rates or brackets should be\n\nconsidered until real, signiﬁcant and lasting reduction – not just reduced growth – in government spending\n\noccurs. Eliminate the 39.6% bracket.\n\nMake Working Pay\n\nPersons able to work collect government support payments and coupons while across America “help\n\nwanted” signs up and down Main Street go begging for applicants. Make working pay. Reexamine and\n\nrestructure unemployment and disability beneﬁts programs to make working better than not working.\n\nTax Rates on Capital Gains\n\nTaxing passive income at the same rates as active income has merit but increasing the tax rates on\n\ncapital gains from the sale of business assets and real estate is counterproductive to sensible business\n\ntransitions and overall business growth. Set 15% as the maximum tax rate on all such capital gains.\n\nAlternative Minimum Tax (AMT)\n\nAMT continues to be a stealth tax on middle-class, working-American, job-creating, small business owners\n\nand needs to be terminated.\n\nDeath Tax\n\nHigher Uniﬁed Credit protection and portability were positive but ending the death tax is better farm-\n\noperator and small business tax policy.\n\nTaxes from Affordable Care Act (ACA)\n\nThe ACA imposes excessive employer penalties (i.e. $100/day = $36,500 per employee per year) if\n\nemployees do not have “qualifying” health insurance, and then ACA denies “qualifying” status to most\n\nhealth insurance options such as pre-tax cash to employees to use to purchase their own health insurance\n\non the State exchanges. Health insurance portability and coverage for child dependents up through age\n\n25 were steps in the correct direction. Beyond that, the ACA is job-killing. Eliminate the employer tax\n\npenalties imposed by the ACA. Use incentives to achieve health insurance goals.\n\nAUTHOR(S)\n\nLance D.

Support is requested in seeking additional funding through various sources\n\nto complete a four-lane Highway 35 in Nebraska. It is requested that the balance of the existing funds\n\nallocated to the Nebraska Highway 35 project be released for land acquisition and the design of the\n\ninterchange. Continued support for the completion of statewide four-lane U.S. Highway 20 in Iowa is also\n\nrequested, with a completion date of November 2018 on the near horizon.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nU.S. Highway 20\n\nOne of the very ﬁrst coast-to-coast highways in the United States, U.S. Highway 20, starts in downtown\n\nBoston and travels through Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa,\n\nNebraska, Wyoming, Idaho, and Oregon. U.S. Highway 20 is a direct route from Iowa’s manufacturing\n\nand food processing industries to the northeastern United States, one of the world’s largest and wealthiest\n\nmarkets.\n\nThe Iowa Legislature passed, and Governor Terry E. Branstad signed into law, a 10 cent per gallon\n\nincrease in the state’s gas tax in February 2015. Due to the increased revenue, the Iowa Department of\n\nTransportation (IDOT) Commission amended their 2015-2019 Iowa Transportation Improvement Program\n\non March 10, 2015, to include purchase of right-of-way for four-lane U.S. 20 between Correctionville and\n\nU.S. Highway 59 at Holstein, a major step toward eventual completion. In June 2015, the DOT Commission\n\napproved the new Five Year Plan which included completion of the entire project on a fast track schedule.\n\nU.S. Highway 20 will become the state’s second east-west four-lane when completed in November 2018.\n\nThe Iowa Department of Transportation (IDOT) is now in the midst of grading two new lanes of U.S.\n\nHighway 20 from Moville to Minnesota Avenue west of Correctionville. Construction on the segment\n\nfrom Minnesota Avenue to Correctionville began in 2015 with a 2018 completion date. Construction on\n\nredesigned ﬁve-lane U.S. Highway 20 in Correctionville was completed in 2015. Bids for the Correctionville\n\nto Holstein, and Holstein to Adams Avenue (east of Galva) segments were let in February 2016. Bids for\n\nthe ﬁnal segment from Adams Avenue to Early will be let in summer 2016.\n\nWhen complete, the statewide four-lane U.S. Highway 20 will serve the manufacturing, agriculture, value-\n\nadded ag, and service industries as well as the traveling public in northwest Iowa while providing relief\n\nfor an over utilized Interstate 80. Completing U.S. Highway 20 in Iowa will provide a crucial link between\n\nthe major Midwestern hubs of Chicago and Denver. It will also connect the only two cities of 20,000\n\npopulation or greater in Iowa not presently served by a connecting four-lane highway: Sioux City and Fort\n\nDodge. Where safe, efﬁcient, and modern transportation does not exist, the loss of population, business,\n\nand opportunity is experienced. U.S. Highway 20 is also a direct route for Iowa’s exports to the western\n\nseaports. Over 50% of Iowa highway trafﬁc moves east/west with only one four-lane facility, Interstate 80,\n\nsupporting this demand.\n\nA four-lane U.S. Highway 20 is strategically positioned to increase national roadway capacity by becoming\n\nthe “Midwest Connector.” Your support of this project has been crucial to its success. We thank you for\n\nyour efforts and look forward to celebrating completion of the long-awaited project!\n\n19\n\n62nd Annual Siouxland/Washington Conference\n\nNebraska Highway 35\n\nNebraska Highway 35 Expressway is a 70-mile planned project for the Nebraska Expressway System. This\n\ndiagonal four-lane segment would connect the conﬂuence of four-lane highways coming from the northeast\n\ninto Sioux City, Iowa with Norfolk, Nebraska and the four-lane Highway 81 Expressway to Interstate 80.\n\nThe Planned 35 Expressway is a signiﬁcant link that would provide four-lane expressway continuity in\n\nthe Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Iowa and Nebraska region and between national destinations. The\n\nNebraska Department of Roads (NDOR) held a public hearing on the draft environmental impact statement\n\nand proposed route on February 12, 2008. The hearing was very positive with only a few isolated concerns\n\nregarding individual parcels of land planned to be acquired as part of this project. The City of South Sioux\n\nCity, Nebraska, along with other entities, stated strong support for the interchange on I-129 to remain part\n\nof this 35 Expressway plan.\n\nThe 70-mile Nebraska Highway 35 Expressway is part of a larger expressway proposal by former Nebraska\n\nState Senator Joel Johnson to extend the diagonal route to Colorado Springs, Colorado, which will save\n\nsigniﬁcant distance, fuel, and time in moving people and goods between major markets. Nebraska is one\n\nof only two states that lack a north / south four-lane Interstate route. 90% of all Nebraskans would be within\n\n25 miles of an expressway or Interstate if this route was constructed.\n\nThe following information depicts the miles saved with the new diagonal route:\n\n• Sioux City to Colorado Springs, CO 240 miles\n\n• Sioux City to Grand Island, NE 96 miles\n\n• Sioux City to York, NE 55 miles\n\nSeveral large corporations that ship products on a regional, national, and international basis use the\n\nPlanned 35 Expressway route, including Afﬁliated Foods, Tyson/IBP Pork Division, Tyson/IBP Beef Division,\n\nGreat Dane Trailers and Michael Foods.

For this reason it is important for a community to build infrastructure to resolve conﬂicts\n\nand improve the safety and efﬁciency of its transportation networks. Historically, Sioux City has had\n\nsuccess in constructing projects which address these concerns. Projects include the recent over and\n\nunderpasses with the construction of Outer Drive North, the construction of Floyd Boulevard several years\n\nago, and the Iowa Department of Transportation (IDOT) crossing of Gordon Drive (built in the 1930s). All of\n\nthese projects eliminate conﬂict in their respective areas. Even with these past successes, the City needs\n\nto continue the effort to resolve conﬂicts that pose a safety threat and slow down access to important\n\ncommercial areas of the City. Among these identiﬁed improvements is the 18th Street Viaduct, which\n\nreceived federal funding through the Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER)\n\nPlanning Grant Program in 2014.\n\nSUPPORT REQUESTED\n\nSioux City would like to again thank you for the support provided in acquiring the 2014 TIGER Planning\n\nGrant. This grant was a crucial ﬁrst step in the development of the 18th Street Viaduct Project. These\n\nfunds have allowed the City to design area improvements and consider the impacts that new infrastructure\n\nwill have on the established Hoeven Valley Corridor. The planning study also allowed for the development\n\nof alternative transportation options through the area for citizens wanting to safely access the City’s\n\nrecreational trail system.\n\nWe ask our tri-state Congressional delegation for their continued legislative support. It is critical as we\n\nprepare to request funding assistance through the upcoming 2016 TIGER Construction Grant and the\n\nIowa Clean Air Attainment Program (ICAAP).\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nHoeven Valley is the home of several major industries which depend upon efﬁcient and safe transportation\n\nroutes to operate and grow. Many of these industries also have dependence on the rail network for the\n\nsupply of raw materials for the transportation of their ﬁnished goods. Projects such as the 18th Street\n\nViaduct will help to improve the efﬁciency and safety of the existing road and rail infrastructure. These are\n\nthe kinds of enhancements that allow the businesses to thrive and grow in the communities in which they\n\nare established.\n\nThe City has repeatedly applied for the TIGER Construction Grant which would provide funding to build\n\nthe infrastructure projects, such as the 18th Street Viaduct. In 2014 the City submitted an application\n\nfor a TIGER Planning Grant which would provide funding for the planning and design of infrastructure\n\nimprovements in the Hoeven Valley corridor. The City was notiﬁed of the TIGER award after the Chamber’s\n\n2014 Siouxland/Washington Conference and the receipt of legislative support from our Iowa delegation. An\n\napplication was not submitted for the 2015 TIGER Construction Grant as the City was working through the\n\nplanning stages with the awarded TIGER Planning Grant; however, application preparation is underway\n\nfor the anticipated 2016 funding requests.\n\nIn early discussions with the Federal Highway Authority (FHA), it has been suggested that the planning\n\ngrant is an important ﬁrst step in assembling a project that will be more qualiﬁed for future construction\n\nfunding. Over the next couple of months the City will work to complete planning and design in preparation\n\nof the 2016 requests for federal assistance. Legislative support associated with continued infrastructure\n\nfunding programs will help to ensure growth of these Sioux City based industries.\n\nAUTHOR(S)\n\nBrittany Anderson, Senior Civil Engineer, City of Sioux City, Iowa, [email protected], 712.279.6401\n\nMarty Dougherty, Economic Development Director, City of Sioux City, Iowa, [email protected],\n\n712.279.6345\n\nGlenn Ellis, City Engineer, City of Sioux City, Iowa, [email protected], 712.279.6330\n\nChris Myres, Economic Development Specialist, City of Sioux City, Iowa, [email protected],\n\n712.224.5502 22\n\n62nd Annual Siouxland/Washington Conference\n\nINTERSTATE 29 RECONSTRUCTION PROJECT\n\nISSUE\n\nThe Iowa Department of Transportation (IDOT) continues to make progress with the reconstruction of\n\nInterstate 29 (I-29). The direct impact to Sioux City is the requirement to move major utilities out of the\n\nInterstate right-of-way. Initial estimates had the City’s costs at $25 million dollars. Considering the actual\n\ncost of projects, the estimates for future work, and a few additions, the costs are now estimated to be over\n\n$40 million dollars.\n\nSUPPORT REQUESTED\n\nWe ask our tri-state Congressional delegation to:\n\n• Identify funding opportunities that will assist communities impacted by large State roadway projects\n\nto offset ﬁnancial burdens related to the project\n\n• Support infrastructure programming that assists communities with the maintenance of aging systems\n\nto ensure that cities are able to maintain environmental compliance and able to avoid the economic\n\nhardships associated with improvements that are made to provide a larger regional beneﬁt\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe City of Sioux City has been working with IDOT for several years on the I-29 reconstruction project.\n\nThis project is important for Sioux City, the State of Iowa, and the other States in the region. The costs of\n\nrelocating utilities are high and continue to increase as projects develop and are bid. These increasing\n\ncosts place a huge burden on Sioux City utility customers who may see a relatively small beneﬁt from the\n\nproject overall.\n\nThe City of Sioux City was informed that in order to accommodate the reconstruction of I-29, the water,\n\nsanitary sewer, and storm sewer infrastructure which conﬂicted with the State’s existing and future rights\n\nof way, would need to be relocated. The City understood this requirement and began to work with IDOT to\n\njointly design projects which would accomplish this utility relocation requirement. The working relationship\n\nbetween the City and IDOT is very good. IDOT has been accommodating and has made the City a\n\npartner in the development of the projects. A speciﬁc example of the cooperation is the inclusion of the\n\nreconstruction of Zenith Drive. This project was identiﬁed in 2013 and State ofﬁcials worked diligently to\n\nensure that funding was available and that the project was included in the overall work plan. As a result of\n\nthis cooperation, the Zenith Drive project is nearing completion, which in turn helped Sioux City to retain\n\na major company.\n\nWhile the working relationship with IDOT on these projects is good, the increasing cost of these projects\n\nis placing a substantial ﬁnancial burden on the City. Initial estimates for the utility relocation portion of the\n\nI-29 work were $25 million. Through the bidding processes and based on recent revised estimates, it is\n\nbelieved that the total cost of these projects will be close to $40 million. These costs are all borne by the\n\nresidents of Sioux City and utility users in the tri-state area.\n\nWhile some of the infrastructure that is being moved with these projects is in need of replacement, most\n\nof the pipes are still in good condition and would provide adequate service for years to come. Additionally,\n\nthere are no new connections to this relocated infrastructure and thus no new sources of revenue. This\n\nmeans that the costs of these new pipes are entirely on the existing users. These are the same users that\n\nalso have to support the repair and replacement of the aging infrastructure throughout the City.\n\nAUTHOR(S)\n\nJeff Hanson, Community Development Operations Manager, City of Sioux City, Iowa,\n\n[email protected], 712.279.6103\n\n23\n\n62nd Annual Siouxland/Washington Conference\n\nSOUTHBRIDGE BUSINESS PARK\n\nISSUE\n\nThe City of Sioux City wishes to provide a progress update on infrastructure and industrial development\n\nprojects in the Southbridge Business Park.\n\nSUPPORT REQUESTED\n\nThe City requests continued Congressional support for the construction of critical infrastructure to help\n\nsecure major new economic development projects through the continued growth of the Southbridge\n\nBusiness Park. The City requests federal support for the construction of additional industrial-scale\n\ninfrastructure and improvements to the transportation network, including planning of a potential new\n\nInterstate 29 (I-29) Southbridge interchange.\n\nIn addition, the creation of a rail-served industrial business park will positively impact Sioux City and the\n\nsurrounding regional area by increasing safety and providing efﬁcient growth of freight rail transportation,\n\nwith reduced truck trafﬁc, vehicle emissions, and other environmental beneﬁts over the projected 20-year\n\nhorizon. The new rail yard offers the opportunity to provide direct rail service to companies locating in\n\nSouthbridge as well as the potential for trans-load service for area businesses.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nThe development of the Southbridge Business Park was necessitated by the limited opportunities for large,\n\nﬂat industrial development sites in the community, and the economic challenges faced by the community in\n\nrecent years. The City will incur signiﬁcant development costs to be able to continue creating opportunities\n\nfor the attraction of quality jobs and capital investment.\n\nThe City is currently also ﬁnancially burdened by the ongoing reconstruction of I-29 (the 10-year project\n\nhas about 3-4 years of construction remaining). The I-29 project incorporates critical safety and capacity\n\nimprovements to the 10-mile length of this vital transportation link for the tri-state region. While the highway\n\nconstruction costs are paid through state and federal highway funds, the City’s required utility relocation\n\ncosts exceed $40 million.\n\nUpdate\n\n• Increased demand: The recent successful sale of 250 acres of land in the Bridgeport Industrial area\n\nof Sioux City for the new Seaboard/Triumph Foods project will result in greater reliance on Southbridge\n\nfor additional major industrial development. This greatly increases the importance of the continued\n\ndevelopment of Southbridge. The City and The Siouxland Initiative (TSI) are exploring the potential for\n\nadditional development sites in Southbridge.\n\n• Southbridge Business Park: Southbridge Business Park is strategically located immediately south\n\nof the Sioux Gateway Airport/Col. Bud Day Field, adjacent to I-29, with nearby rail service and several\n\nthousand acres of potentially-developable land. In addition to the purchase of more than 300 acres of\n\ndevelopment property, the City has invested over $65 million in infrastructure:\n\n• Water Treatment Plant - A $35 million water treatment plant and well system went online in\n\nearly 2012. The facility is interconnected to the City’s existing water system and provides\n\nan additional 10 mgd (expandable to 30 mgd) of clean water capacity.\n\n• Southbridge Drive - Working with the 185th Air Refueling Wing of the Iowa Air National\n\nGuard, the existing airport access road was relocated out of the airport area, providing\n\na new north/south access road into the new business park. The project also improved\n\naccess and security to one of Iowa’s two National Guard bases, and was opened in 2012.\n\n• 225th Street - This rural gravel road was reconstructed to industrial standards to meet the\n\ndemands of growing industry. All associated utilities were also upgraded as part of this project.\n\nA ﬁnal leg of this projec"
