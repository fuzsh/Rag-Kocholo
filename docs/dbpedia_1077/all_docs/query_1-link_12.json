        "text": "He is no firebrand preacher, but more and more Senator John Kerry is seeing audiences that sound like revival meetings.\n\n''Amen! Aaaaamen!'' Barry Cheeney, 44, a father of two, screamed when Mr. Kerry promised on Saturday in Davenport never to make American ''sons and daughters'' fight overseas to defend America's dependence on Mideast oil.\n\nIn Dover, N.H., on Thursday, Mr. Kerry, of Massachusetts, was riffing on health care and how he had been cured of cancer. ''I had the best health care in the world,'' he said, setting up his promise to give everyone access to the same health plan that senators enjoy. ''Why?''\n\nA woman yelled, ''Because God's got a plan for you!'' The audience of 500 thundered approval.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Kerry tripped over people on the floor of a packed Veterans of Foreign Wars post. Even Republicans raised their hands and announced conversions on the spot.\n\n''I'll be very honest with you,'' Shirley Cohen of Hollis, N.H., said. ''I was a Republican. I changed to become independent two months ago. I was very strongly leading toward another candidate. But you've very thoroughly convinced me tonight.''\n\nOther candidates may be talking about religion, but at almost every stop in Iowa, Mr. Kerry is making believers of large numbers of Democrats and others who say they are unimpressed by Howard Dean, unsure of John Edwards's experience and uninspired by Richard A. Gephardt in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
