        "text": "1. An Annual Report on B2B Thought Leadership by Edelman Business Marketing and LinkedIn US REPORT\n\n2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Over the past three years, Edelman has collaborated with LinkedIn to investigate the power and impact inherent in publishing quality Thought Leadership content. This year’s study confirms that B2B Decision-Makers are spending meaningful time consuming Thought Leadership content and, when that content is done well, that it has the potential to significantly influence brand perception and buying behaviors. However, even though a sizeable amount of this content is being created, the Decision-Makers reading it continue to be disappointed in its overall quality, which poses real risks to the reputation and sales of the B2B companies publishing it. This year's survey results show that while more than half of the Decision-Makers we surveyed spend more than one hour every week consuming Thought Leadership, only 17% of them rate the quality of most of what they read as very good or excellent. This situation becomes even more concerning when you know that 88% of Decision-Makers surveyed say that Thought Leadership can be effective in enhancing their perceptions of an organization. In addition, most marketers are missing the opportunity to connect Thought Leadership efforts to measurable business impact, including high-priority KPIs such as account lift, MQL, SQL and other measures of how content is driving positive customer behavior. This year’s survey found that only 23% of marketers can tie the Thought Leadership they produce to sales and business wins. This disconnect is perpetuating a negative cycle of inadequate investment, poor quality content and an underestimation of Thought Leadership’s impact — both positive and negative. This data makes the bottom line very clear – producing Thought Leadership is an excellent way to gain the attention of the people who make B2B decisions, but if your organization is not committed to doing it well over the long-term, your efforts can move the needle in the wrong direction. KEY LEARNINGS 1. Three years of data make it clear – Thought Leadership is a powerful way to connect with B2B Decision-Makers. 2. Most Thought Leadership producers are unable to measure its impact on business opportunities – signaling a missed opportunity and potential risk. 3. Brands that cultivate a culture of Thought Leadership reap greater reputation and sales impact than those that do not. SEIZING THE UNTAPPED BUSINESS POTENTIAL OF THOUGHT LEADERSHIP\n\n3. TERMINOLOGY Free deliverables organizations or individuals produce on a topic they know a lot about and feel others can benefit from having their perspective on.

BEST PRACTICES: THE EDELMAN THOUGHT LEADERSHIP FLYWHEEL 04\n\n31. BEST PRACTICES: THE EDELMAN THOUGHT LEADERSHIP FLYWHEEL WHITE SPACE ATTRIBUTION BREVITY TRUST RELEVANCE VISION\n\n32. CAPITALIZE ON WHITE SPACE Seek out timely topics that pose challenges for your customers Explore Thought Leadership topics at the intersections between timely industry trends, customer pain points and your company’s growth priorities. Play the contrarian or unexpected angle Conduct a media analysis to uncover opportunities to say something novel, especially around crowded topics. Seek out new angles and a counterintuitive POV. Be bold and imaginative in your storytelling B2B Thought Leadership need not be limited to whitepapers. Even for well-covered topics, find creative and unexpected ways of delivering your story to create whitespace and distinguish you from competitors. FIND OPPORTUNITIES WHERE YOUR BRAND CAN OWN AND LEAD TIMELY CONVERSATIONS WHITE SPACE\n\n33. BE RELEVANT Avoid the “everything to everyone” trap Narrow the target audience for Thought Leadership to a set of companies, a particular industry or key function within the buyer committee. The more specific your target, the more tailored your communications can and should be. Find customer insights in the trenches Engage frontline sales and customer relationship managers early in the Thought Leadership development process to uncover what topics most concern current customers and prospects on a day-to- day basis. Embrace martech that fuels creative editorial content Instead of a one-to-many editorial approach, embrace publishing technologies that enable granular personalization and tailored content experiences to niche audiences (e.g., website personalization, progressive profiling, account-based marketing). STRONG THOUGHT LEADERSHIP IS CLOSELY MAPPED TO CUSTOMER NEEDS RELEVANCE\n\n34. VISION SET A VISION Explain not just “what” but “why\" Don’t just identify trends – demonstrate an understanding of why things are happening in a way that nobody else can. Especially for senior Decision-Makers, seek to explain the underlying causes of trends that map back to their key business challenges. Uncover what’s next for your customers Inspire customers by looking around corners to find new opportunities that will benefit them. Spend less time on the features/benefits your company offers, and more time explaining how your customers can gain a competitive advantage in the future. Use big picture thinking to condition the selling environment Many companies focus on chasing down leads for product purchases. Fewer invest the effort to earn credibility in the minds of customers and create an environment that stimulates demand. Visionary ideas are more likely to resonate with senior decision-makers, especially those who think about their own business in holistic terms. DECISION-MAKERS WANT TO KNOW WHERE THEIR INDUSTRY IS GOING VISION\n\n35. EARN TRUST Showcase your people to earn credibility Harness the power of your people – senior executives, deep subject matter experts and employee “amplifiers” – to convey your Thought Leadership in a more personal and authentic style. “Pay it forward” by teaching customers how to solve a problem Invest in journalistic-quality content and ideas that go beyond products and services to educate customers and provide genuine value and knowledge they can use. Generosity pays dividends. Aspire to consistency and longevity Explore how your Thought Leadership can be an ongoing franchise rather than a one-off event in order to generate goodwill over time. Increased followers, opt-in subscribers and ultimately, a captive audience, are the rewards. Align with trusted, recognizable voices outside of your company Enhance credibility through partnerships with industry influencers, academia, media publishers and other sources of information that your target audiences already know and trust. BEING A TRUSTED SOURCE IS KEY TO DRIVING THOUGHT LEADERSHIP ENGAGEMENT TRUST\n\n36. BE CONCISE Think in terms of headlines Imagine how a journalist would write a story about your Thought Leadership. Anticipate the key messages and insights that people would want to pass along to others. Craft your story around the most memorable and quick-hitting ideas. Entice readers along a journey Create short, snackable media such as infographics and rich media that capture attention, provide immediate value and motivate readers to continue on to consume longer-from content. Break down content into smaller chunks that can be easily consumed via social media, email newsletters, etc. Simplify complex stories with a human touch. Consider video and audio as storytelling aids to quickly deliver hard- to-digest information in a personable format that people want to spend time consuming. BREVITY IS OVERWHELMINGLY PREFERRED BY BUSY PROFESSIONALS BREVITY\n\n37. MEASURE PROGRESS Begin at the end Before executing Thought Leadership campaigns, identify what company leadership and the broader organization will consider success, and how it will be measured. Engage with sales early Align sales and marketing on high-priority KPIs such as account lift, MQL, SQL and other measures of how content is driving positive customer behavior. Adopt measurement tools aligned with your priorities Ensure you have the right tech and data in place to understand content performance from awareness through purchase – especially site-side analytics that track customer actions after they have consumed Thought Leadership. Beyond “how many,” focus on “who” Look beyond the large numbers typically tied to outbound tactics such as impressions and anonymous clicks; dig deeper to verify the identity and quality of the audience, and what kinds of interactions thought leadership is driving.
