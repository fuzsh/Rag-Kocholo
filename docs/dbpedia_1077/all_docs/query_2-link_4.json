        "text": "Leadership Matters: A Ryder Cup Postscript Congratulations to the European Team and Captain Luke Donald on a decisive 16.5 - 11.5 Ryder Cup victory in Rome. Here’s just a few of the competitive advantages the Europeans exploited on their way to victory (aside from the obvious home crowd): - Inspiration: The Europeans had 12 players but 13 lockers. The extra was in memory and spirit of Seve Ballesteros which was a source of inspiration for the winning team. Luke Donald pulled on the heartstrings of his team and it worked. - Championship Form: The Americans hadn’t played competitive golf in 5 weeks and it showed getting shutout in the first session 4-0. Each of the 12 European players competed in the BMW PGA Championship September 14-17 on the DP World Tour. There’s a big difference between rested and rusty. - Captain’s Picks: US Captain Zach Johnson made 6 captains picks and they combined for a 4-12-4 record. On paper the US had better talent, but the Europeans had a better TEAM suited for the course at Marco Simone. Interestingly Luke Donald wasn’t the original pick to lead the European Team. He was pressed into service a little more than a year ago to replace Henrik Stenson when he jumped to the LIV Tour. Now many are calling for Donald to lead the Europeans at the 2025 Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black in New York. Captains matter. Leadership matters! #Leadership #coaching #RyderCup\n\nThe Rugby World Cup France 2023 has come to an end with an incredible, record breaking, one point margin, back to back victory of the reigning champions, the Sprinboks 🇿🇦, over their biggest rivals, the All Blacks 🇳🇿, after a classic 80 minutes clash of heavyweights!! The final match has been the proper conclusion of a 2 months long, extraordinary show put on by all the 20 teams. 💪 Watching the games with my 5 and 8 years old kids offered me the chance to teach them some valuable lessons that can be useful in the business life too. 💡 For example, the power of focusing on progress over results. 🎯 We always find ourselves under immense pressure to deliver given results, which are important to get of course, but it is focusing on progress that we can achieve better performance, motivation, engagement and higher level of confidence and self-belief. 👍🏻 With this in mind I chose the picture below: Aaron Smith who, despite having thousands of reasons to be upset in that moment, is proudly showing his kid the silver medal and, as the incredible team leader he is, most probably focusing on the lessons learned during the whole world cup rather than the loss over the Boks.🔝 #rugby #lessons #businesscoach #teamleader #springboks #allblacks #performance #result #leadership #gpspeaking\n\nI absolutely had to share this experience... Recently, while prepping for an U11 rugby training session at Aylesford Bulls, I stumbled upon something amazing. I was fast-forwarding a match between the All Blacks and Australia, focusing on the rucking forwards. Then, Tana Umaga, one of the world's fastest wingers, appeared on screen. At 1.5x speed, he was practically a blur - it was incredible to see his speed in this new light! Usually, my conversations revolve around board rooms and management teams, discussing core values, personal excellence, and role fulfillment. But this experience got me thinking about the lessons our young players learn through rugby: 👉Listening and following instructions. 👉Handling disappointment gracefully. 👉Playing as a unified team. 👉Building confidence. 👉Cultivating self-discipline. 👉Making decisions and communicating effectively under pressure. 👉Analysing situations and developing strategies. These are not just rugby skills, they are life skills. They're the same principles that can transform a business team's performance. So, I ask you, does your team truly understand their roles and their impact on your business's success? Let's take inspiration from the rugby field to the boardroom and beyond. Here are some of the greats who have: Tim Stimpson, Topsy Ojo, Philip Vickery MBE DL, Ollie Phillips. What can your team learn from this approach? #BusinessStrategy #BusinessCoach #Rugby #LifeSkills\n\nThis weekend, I laced up my boots and stepped onto the Gaelic football field for the first time ever. \"GAA Dads & Lads\" is a social hurling and football programme for those aged 35ish and older keen to enjoy Gaelic games outside the traditional competitive structures of the GAA. At 44, having not played any team sports in nearly 30 years, and what experience I had being pretty negative, the apprehension was real – I can walk into a boardroom to meet with complete strangers but this took me so far outside my comfort zones. It definitely taught me a few things about myself, here’s what I think I learned: 1. Embracing New Experiences: Stepping onto the field with no experience was terrifying. Historically I would have found an excuse to cry off. But I was glad I didn't and deny myself what turned out to be a great experience. 2. The Strength of Vulnerability: Admitting you are a newbie in any setting can be daunting, but it opened doors to support, camaraderie and craic that I never expected. 3. Overcoming Apprehension: The nerves I felt before the game were natural and not a reason to stop. I told myself nobody was going to die (hopefully) and it was all going to be over in a hour no matter what happened so what the hell! 4. The Joy of Participation: The real win wasn’t in the score (it really wasn't in the score!), but in the participation. It was a celebration of taking part, regardless of the outcome. The craic was great as was the hospitality of the competition. The experience was less about the sport and definitely more about confronting some demons, ignoring the nerves and giving something new a go. It was a lesson in the value of stepping out of my comfort zone and the positive things that can lead too. Who knows how many other positive experiences lie just beyond the edge of the familiar, ready to be embraced if we're willing to try? #NewChallenges #NeverTooLateToStart #GaelicFootballBeginner\n\nWatching the Rugby World Cup Final this weekend provoked a lot of thought in me about how scenarios play out and impact our state of mind. The \"what ifs\", \"what could have beens\" and \"I should have done this\" thoughts can eat us alive if we're allowed to dwell on them in the moment. But perspective always helps, and sometimes it can help to visualise the longer term narrative, or perhaps position yourself in the Hero's Journey. So many sports teams and individuals have been through such seemingly devastatingly low times, but have later become almost defined by those moments when experiencing their achievements. Wrexham is a great example of a local community and fans who have experienced lows for many years; not of their own making. Yet, would the current highs that they are experiencing be as impactful if not for those low points in time. Sheffield Wednesday overturned a 4-0 deficit from the first leg of the League One playoffs last year, having been written off by most, and even some of their own players. Would they have achieved that success if they didn't take a long hard look at the failure that was just 90 minutes in length, and was just half the amount of time of the competition. They had time to influence the outcome. Mark Cavendish bounced back from many years of disappointment, illness and mental health struggles to achieve four stage victories at the 2021 Tour de France, equalling Eddy Merckx's record for the most amount of individual stage wins. Tyson Fury had written his own career off through retirement, whilst suffering from some terrible mental health challenges, only to resurrect his career emphatically after an almost 3 year break, and go on to become WBC World Heavyweight champion, defending his crown a further 3 times. If you're facing a current setback, or perhaps the thought of an eventual setback is stopping you from taking action, think through these questions: - Wouldn't you rather have had, or taken the opportunity than not? - Would you regret not pushing yourself to get to greatness? - Would you trade in all the lows that you might experience for one legacy defining high? Sam Cane will no doubt reflect and dwell on his red card in the game on Saturday, and Jordie Barrett on his missed long-range penalty to take the lead in the closing minutes. But they will come back stronger and more determined for it, and they will have a team around them that will equally want to help them reach their dreams. This may be the moment that makes them.

Every year, I'm hooked on watching players give everything they've got and push through their mental and physical barriers. 💪 🎾 I've even been lucky enough to go to Wimbledon twice and see my all time favourite player, Rafael Nadal, in action. (As well as seeing him play against his biggest rival, Federer, at the O2. 😊) Nadal is widely considered a legend for his repeated success in the face of adversity and making his comebacks greater than his setbacks. He plays every point like it's his last - his warrior mentality never allowing him to give up. Early on, Nadal had expectations against him - being labelled as a one-trick-pony who would only ever succeed on clay courts. And throughout his career, he has suffered a stream of serious injuries, some of which put him out of the game for over a year at a time. In response to these setbacks, Nadal consistently pushed his fitness levels and adapted his game, using legendary matches against Federer and Djokovic to elevate his play. 🏆 And in 2008, he took the Men's Wimbledon Title from Federer in a 5 hour match dubbed 'the greatest ever final'. These days, Nadal is celebrated for his resilience and determination because he didn't let his setbacks get in the way of winning 22 Grand Slam titles, ranking world No. 1 for 209 weeks, getting Gold at the Olympics and breaking records. 🤯 His story is one of my key inspirations because it's a reminder that resilience and determination are what makes our comebacks greater than our setbacks. Who inspires you? What setbacks have you overcome? 💪❤️ #Inspiration #Resilience #Determination #RafaelNadal #Wimbledon #NeverGiveUp #Leadership #Success #Perseverance #Motivation #Rec2Rec #Recruitment #CareerGoals #Setback #Thecomebackisgreaterthanthesetback\n\nR&A Champion Golfer of the Year …. Xander Schauffele Having played a fair amount of golf and following it intently in my younger years, it is amazing how much emphasis is placed on equipment, swing plain, practice and repetition. In fact, the golf swing may be the most analyzed functional movement in all of sport. Yet, when it comes down to it, the ability to achieve success is predicated in large part in mastering the nervous system. As legendary golfer Bobby Jones has stated, “Competitive golf is played mainly on a five-and-a-half inch course … the space between your ears.” Schauffele has been labeled as one of golf’s elite for several years now. In contention in Major Golf Tournaments many times, yet falling short of winning the prize! 🏆 His breakthrough moment came this past May as he won the PGA Championship, his first Major. Now, 2 months later, he has bagged 2 of the 4 Major Championships for 2024. He is noted for being a “flatliner” or showing little to no emotion on the course, focusing in the moment, the next shot. In golf, the two best to ever play the game, Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods had amazing resolve in which they seldom, if ever, beat themselves. Bill Belichick, arguably the greatest football coach of all time is noted for stating to his teams that more games are lost than are won. His teams went into games knowing they had that competitive edge, believing they were mentally tougher. The ability to train the brain for peak performance is available to us all. Can you think back to your breakthrough moment, be it an athletic, personal or professional challenge which resulted in the desired outcome? #XanderSchauffele #TheOpen #Golf #InnerGame #Emotions #Fear #MentalGame #LimbicSystem #Neuroplasticity #Breathwork #Interoception #Performance #Stress"
