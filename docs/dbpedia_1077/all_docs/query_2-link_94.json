Apr Chicago bears coach Dave Wannstedt still is kicking himself Over the teams kicking game. Wannstedt said monday that Field position played a big part in sundays 35-28 loss at Green Bay 35-28, tying the bears and packers for first place in the nil Central. A we would have had better Field position if we had put every Kickoff out of Bounds a he said. Chicago kicked off five times against the packers who returned them for a total of 147 Yards a 29-Yard average from the Point of the catch. Their average Field position for the Start of these drives was at their own 39-Yard line. And on the one drive that started on their 22, it came As a result of a penalty against Green Bay. A the kicking is not what it needs to be but we also did a very poor Job of covering kicks a said Wannstedt. A a in la be Quick to pull the trigger if i have the bears pulled the trigger on punter Mitch Berger who was signed last week to give Rookie Todd Sauerbrun some Competition. Berger was not activated for the Packer game and was waived monday. On tuesday the bears will look at Pat of Neill who was recently released by new England and Greg Montgomery who was with Detroit last season. A a it a just a workout. They re not coming Here to be signed a Wannstedt said. A we will go into the game with Todd and Kevin Butler doing the kickoffs. A Todd made some improvement in his punting but he a not close to what he is capable Butler replaced Sauerbrun on kickoffs in the second Quarter sunday after the packers already had three touchdowns. In addition Wannstedt said that some fresh faces May be on the Kickoff coverage team. A the coverage team is the thing that is disappointing. We re capable of doing a better Job a said Wannstedt. The bears will also take a hard look at doing a better Job defending on third Down plays which the packers converted 7-of-12 times for a 58 percent ratio. A a in a not going to be specific but possibly try to do something there with personnel a said Wannstedt. A a we re going to look at our secondary and see if we got the Best Guys on or if we can do anything to improve he did indicate satisfaction with the defensive line play against the run but Felt the pass Rush could improve. Bears notes cornerback Donnell Woolford who missed the packers game with a shoulder injury and safety Mark Carrier who sprained a knee in the first Quarter could be sidelined against Detroit this weekend. Tight end Keith Jennings concussion and guard Jay Leewen Burg Back should be healthy enough to face the Lions.
