Gerald Green Biography

In 2005 the Boston Celtics picked highflying Gerald Green with the 18th overall pick in the 1st round of the NBA Draft. Picked straight out of Gulf Shores Academy in Houston, Texas, where he was a McDonald’s All-American and averaged 33 points and 12 rebounds, Green made an immediate impact on the Celtics as a rookie and had a big year in 2007, scoring 10.4 points a game. Since being traded to the Mavericks and seeing time with the Nets and Pacers he’s become a solid contributor for the Phoenix Suns, averaging nearly 15 points a game the last two seasons and 10 points over the course of his eight-year career.

During his time in the league he’s made a huge splash at the NBA Slam Dunk Contest, showcasing big-time dunks with style and flare that captured him the 2007 Slam Dunk trophy and also allowing him to become a three-time competitor. In 2014 Green was named the NBA Most Improved Player.
