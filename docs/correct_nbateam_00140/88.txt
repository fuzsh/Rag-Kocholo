BOSTON – Gerald Green is back in Boston, but not quite in the role he envisioned.

The veteran wing who has had two separate stints with the Celtics, was recently signed to a one-year, non-guaranteed deal by his hometown team, the Houston Rockets, and will be available to play tonight when Boston hosts Houston.

Green, drafted by the Celtics with the 18th overall pick in the 2005 NBA draft, spent two separate stints (2005-2007; 2017) with Boston.

He appeared in 160 games with Boston, in addition to playing a pivotal role in Boston’s postseason run last season which ended with the Celtics losing in the Eastern Conference finals to Cleveland.

Before they got the Cavs, Boston rallied from a 2-0 series deficit in their first-round series with Chicago and the play of Green was pivotal to Boston’s turnaround.

“He’s a guy that can score the ball; he’s a guy that’s been doing it for a long time,” said Celtics head coach Brad Stevens. “He’s a big reason why we advanced out of the first round.”

Green made five starts in the Chicago series, averaging 8.8 points while shooting 45.9 percent from the field and 40.9 percent from 3-point range.

There was some consideration in bringing Green back during the offseason, but the Celtics decided to go in a different direction.

Green says there are no hard feelings.

“Boston, they made a lot of changes to their roster this year and it’s for the better,” Green said. “They’re the number one team in the East, and they’re doing well. So, things for me and Boston did not end bad; it is what it is.”
