Free agent Gerald Green will not be returning to the Boston Celtics after reportedly agreeing to a contract with the Milwaukee Bucks.

The Vertical's Shams Charania first reported the news:

Though he produced meager stats during his lone season in Boston (this time around), Green will be missed by the Celtics -- and not just because he helped the team turn around a first-round series against the Chicago Bulls. The small forward drank hot chocolate on the bench, held court with teammates before games, and typically brought a vibrant energy to the locker room every day. His personality made him a hit in Boston.

After the season, Green stressed he wanted to return to the Celtics, play for "genius" coach Brad Stevens and work toward finishing what he and the team started. But, obviously, Green didn't get his wish. The Celtics still have an open roster spot after a wild offseason, but might prefer to target size rather than another wing.
