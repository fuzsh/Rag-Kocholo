        "text": "BOSTON (CBS) â€“ Former Celtics draft pick and notorious dunker Gerald Green is reportedly returning to Boston.\n\nGreen, who the Celtics selected with the No. 18 pick in the 2005 draft, has agreed to sign a 1-year guaranteed contract in Boston, a source told Sean Deveney of the Sporting News.\n\nIn addition, Deveney reports that league sources say Boston \"remains active in seeking to make a larger trade.\"\n\nGreen averaged 8.9 points per game last season with the Miami Heat. In 2013-14 as a member of the Phoenix Suns, Green notched nearly 16 points per contest.\n\nAs a member of the Celtics in 2007, Green won the Slam Dunk Contest during All-Star Weekend."
