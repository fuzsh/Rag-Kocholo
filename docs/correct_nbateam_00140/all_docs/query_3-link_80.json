        "text": "Gerald Green has played for eight different NBA teams, and he spent time in the developmental league and overseas. But in December the Rockets decided to take a chance and sign him, and in the past two games, he has dropped 27 points on the Magic and 29 points on the Warriors with James Harden out injured.\n\nAfter scoring those 29 points, Green had a pretty awesome quote about what he was doing in between October (when the Bucks cut him before this regular season started) and December, per ESPN:\n\n\"All I've been doing is shooting in my driveway and playing one-on-one with my Rottweiler,\" Green told ESPN after his 29-point performance off the Rockets' bench in Thursday's 124-114 loss to the Golden State Warriors.\n\nIf you go to Green's Instagram, there's actually a photo of him playing with his dog captioned, \"Damm Zeus let me work on my game!\" I guess he really was practicing like that - it wasn't just for the 'gram.\n\nNot that Green is the only NBA player to take on his dog on the court. Paul George does this too.\n\nWhen ya mans want that one on one #GodSpeed\n\nA post shared by Paul George (@ygtrece) on Oct 21, 2014 at 2:40pm PDT\n\nMORE:\n\nCharles Barkley's lost Rose Bowl bet to Ernie Johnson cost him $12,000\n\nGenius dog takes herself sledding in delightful snow video\n\nSee Grigor Dimitrov's amazing display of sportsmanship after opponent is injured\n\nAly Raisman was so excited to get Kyrie Irving's jersey after win over Cavaliers"
