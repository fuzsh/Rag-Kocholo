        "text": "Gerald Green must look to Isaiah Thomas in order to get comfortable with the Boston Celtics\n\nSince joining the Boston Celtics, Isaiah Thomas has been the clear cut go to offensive option. He has been unmatched in terms of generating offense for himself and he is the one who gets them to function at their highest level as a whole. Thomas sets the pace and instigates the ball movement and there is no one else more responsible for his own and the team’s offensive success than Thomas.\n\nEvery player on the Celtics needs to look to Thomas to be at their best. Everyone needs to work with Thomas in order to optimize their game, but Gerald Green needs Thomas a bit more than anyone else because of how much he can help in terms of establishing team chemistry. That chemistry is to just necessarily what Green and Thomas do together. What is most important is the chemistry as a unit, and Thomas is in a unique position to know how to get that out of Green.\n\nMore from Hardwood Houdini\n\nGreen is currently expected to make the final roster, but there is no guarantee. They desperately need his offensive production on the second unit, but he needs to prove that he can be productive in order to earn the playing time. For Green on and off the court, Thomas is the best way for him to get comfortable, and the best way for him to fit in the offense that he wants to be a part of.\n\nGreen and Thomas were briefly teammates with the Phoenix Suns and indications from when they played together are that they can work well together on the court. Taylor C Snow of NBA.com highlights these comments made about the relationship between the two guards: “It was amazing because it’s not like we had any outside practice, it’s not like we talked about each others’ game – we just clicked instantly”. Green clearly loves to play with Thomas and the level of comfort they have together could be the difference maker in getting him playing time.\n\nThomas’ impact, however, could be as much off the court as it is on. Even if Green is a part of the rotation, his time will be on the second unit and the majority of the minutes will not be with Thomas. Brad Stevens is always creative with his lineups and Green will certainly get playing time with Thomas, but he needs to prove that he can produce without him on the court as well in order to have a consistent role.\n\nThomas has done a remarkable job of not only optimizing himself in Stevens’ offense, but finding ways to accommodate all his teammates. Thomas will have a better understanding of what Green needs to do to fit than anyone else, and he can play a crucial role in getting him comfortable in Stevens’ offense.\n\nApr 26, 2016; Atlanta, GA, USA; Boston Celtics guard Isaiah Thomas (4) is defended by Atlanta Hawks forward Thabo Sefolosha (25) and forward Mike Scott (32) in the first quarter in game five of the first round of the NBA Playoffs at Philips Arena. Mandatory Credit: Brett Davis-USA TODAY Sports\n\nStevens himself will also be crucial. He has proven that he will optimize whatever talent is at his disposal and that is putting Green in a great position. He has people around him and should give him an easier transition than many would have anticipated, but Green needs to show a willingness to adapt, and Thomas should help him learn what that entails on the Celtics.\n\nVersatility has been absolutely crucial to the Celtics on both ends of the court, and Green can attack in a dynamic way with his athleticism and three point shooting. A career mark of 36 percent from three could be a difference maker for the Celtics, and he has the ability to be aggressive in the paint as well. Those skills alone will not be enough, however. The more time Green gets on the court with Thomas the better off he will be. Green has proven that he can be a productive player with Thomas, but he needs more than just than to be an important player to the Celtics.\n\nThomas also made comments on NBA.com about the kind of role he envisions for Green: “We’ve got some threats in the paint, we’ve got some guys that are able to get in the paint, and we’ve got to be able to stretch the floor, and he helps us do that”. Thomas understands the value of Green’s shooting and Green should learn quickly that he needs to shoot well to get into the lineup.\n\nThomas has done a great job of becoming the play maker that makes all the difference for the shooters around him, and Stevens would love to have a guard on the second unit that can stretch the floor. Thomas went from the go to scorer, to that and the main distributor, and he should continue to build on that this season. Thomas is the best option to help create for Green, then all he needs to do is hit those open shots.\n\nGreen needs to be able to play without Thomas on the court with him, but Thomas still needs to be the player he looks to. There is a lot of youth that will be running the second unit offense and if Green can find a way to fit in well quickly, then his presence could be incredibly valuable.\n\nGreen could end up being one of the crucial pieces on the second unit, and both Stevens and Thomas have made comments about his ability to score. Green is certainly elevating the offensive talent level of the second unit and with what Stevens and Thomas have accomplished with sub par offensive talent, Green is in a great position to have a great impactful year for the Boston Celtics.\n\nThis article originally appeared on"
