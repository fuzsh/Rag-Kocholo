        "text": "LAKE CHARLES, La. - The Houston Rockets recently announced their broadcasting team for the upcoming 2023-24 NBA season. Craig Ackerman and Ryan Hollins will continue to handle play-by-play duties with Vanessa Richardson as the sideline reporter.\n\nBut when it comes to the new addition, the Rockets have added former guard and Houston native Gerald Green to their pregame and postgame show. Green will be joining Hall of Famer Calvin Murphy and Kevin Eschenfelder.\n\nGreen played 13 years in the league and averaged 9.7 points across 658 games. He played three seasons for the Rockets after joining the team for one game during the 2007-08 season.\n\nHe returned nearly a decade later and played a critical role in helping the Rockets reach the Western Conference Finals during the 2017-18 campaign.\n\nIn 115 career games played for the Rockets, Green averaged 10.2 points on .404/.360/.844 shooting splits.\n\nThe newly announced Space City Home Network (SCHN) will broadcast all 82 games and four preseason matches. Fans will be able to watch SCHN on the same channels as the team’s previous network, AT&T SportsNet, without the need to take any action.\n\nAll Rockets games will be available on the radio broadcast home of the Houston Rockets, SportsTalk 790 KBME and NewsRadio 740 KTRH as well as in Spanish on TUDN 93.3 FM.\n\nMatt Thomas continues as the lead voice of the Rockets' English radio broadcast and will once again be joined by Adam Clanton and Adam Wexler. Adrian Chavarria remains as the team’s Spanish radio voice."
