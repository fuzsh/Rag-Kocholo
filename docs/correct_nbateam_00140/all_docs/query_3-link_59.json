        "text": "Issac Baldizon/Getty Images\n\nMiami Heat shooting guard Gerald Green was hospitalized the morning of Nov. 4 for undisclosed reasons, according to the team. After recovering from the injury and serving a two game suspension, he is ready to return.\n\nContinue for updates.\n\nGreen Active vs. Timberwolves\n\nTuesday, Nov. 17\n\nThe Heat announced Green will play against Minnesota.\n\nGreen Discharged from Hospital\n\nSunday, Nov. 8\n\nAmy Viteri of WPLG Local 10 reported Green was released from the hospital Saturday night. The Heat later refused to say if he had been released, adding they would have no further update, per Ira Winderman of the South Florida Sun Sentinel.\n\nDetails from 911 Call Surface\n\nSaturday, Nov. 7\n\n\"According to the transcript of the 911 call of the incident, a woman at the front desk of Green's condo is heard on the recording saying, 'I have a resident that just passed out. He's bleeding,'\" relayed Winderman.\n\nChalmers Details Situation Leading to Green's Hospitalization\n\nThursday, Nov. 5\n\nAccording to Manny Navarro of the Miami Herald, point guard Mario Chalmers said he received a phone call from somebody in Green's building to alert him of the situation.\n\n\"I didn't really see [Green] in [a state]. I was just trying to be there for him and trying to figure out what was going on,\" said Chalmers, per Navarro.\n\nChalmers also spoke with Green today, per Winderman: \"Yeah I talked to him this morning. He's goodâ€”back in good health.\"\n\nSpoelstra, Teammates Comment on Green\n\nThursday, Nov. 5\n\n\"We're grateful that he's safe and he's healthy right now,\" Heat head coach Erik Spoelstra said, per Winderman. \"And our thoughts are with him and his family.\"\n\n\"When we found out he's OK, we moved on,\" guard Dwyane Wade said, according to Winderman. \"I talked to him today, and he said he was doing better. That's all I can ask for.\"\n\nHeat Release Statement on Green\n\nWednesday, Nov. 4\n\n\"This morning we were informed that Gerald Green was admitted into the hospital. Right now our concerns are with Gerald, and we have no further comment at this time,\" the team's statement read.\n\nWinderman reported Chalmers, who lives near Green, was with him when EMTs arrived.\n\n\"No one was Tased, and no one was Baker Acted. Fire Rescue called for our assistance because of problems with a patient. But we don't know what those problems were,\" announced Miami Police Detective Frederica Burden, per Winderman and Linda Trischitta of the Sun Sentinel."
