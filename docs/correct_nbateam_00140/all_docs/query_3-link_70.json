        "text": "WALTHAM -- Gerald Green has enough self-awareness to know the Boston Celtics benefitted from trading him nine years ago. If he didn't know at the time of the deal in 2007, it became clear when Boston won a championship the ensuing season with Kevin Garnett, and it was obvious throughout Garnett's entire stint with the team.\n\n\"Shoot,\" Green said Monday at Celtics media day, \"I would trade myself for Kevin Garnett too.\"\n\nThat trade probably feels like a lifetime ago to Green. Since then, he has blown out a birthday candle in the NBA dunk contest; played professional basketball in Russia, China, and the D-League; and emerged, after such a long journey, as a viable NBA scorer. That's the role he expects to play for the Celtics this season after signing a one-year deal to rejoin his first team.\n\n\"I still have a lot in the tank,\" the 30-year-old vowed Monday.\n\nGreen will need to prove himself right to earn a role off the Celtics bench. The team could use another perimeter shooter, but his numbers dipped in that area last season when he shot just 32.3 percent from behind the arc for the Miami Heat. Interestingly, Green pointed out how the Phoenix Suns' fast-paced style helped him during his previous NBA stop. Over two seasons with the Suns, he averaged 20.8 points per 36 minutes to go along with 38.0-percent 3-point shooting -- numbers that are much better than the ones he posted during one campaign in Miami.\n\n\"I think in Phoenix...Phoenix is like the run and gun team,\" he said. \"We used to do a drill where we'd try to score in the first seven seconds. We used to do that in practice. Once we came into the games, it was natural for us. People didn't understand the way we were playing. That's just how we played. In Miami it was all about slowing it down, giving it to our core guys, giving it to our horses, (Dwyane) Wade and Chris Bosh. That's something we did periodically, just kind of play off those guys and get your shots from there.\"\n\nLike the Suns, Boston likes to push the ball in transition. Green will have freedom to shoot early in the shot clock and, given how many turnovers his new team forces, should see plenty of fast break opportunities. After playing the Celtics last season, he remembers thinking how much joy they seemed to be having.\n\nNow Green will be in that system, too, thanks partially to the recruiting efforts of former Suns teammate Isaiah Thomas.\n\n\"You know what, IT was a big influence (in free agency),\" Green said. \"My family is here (in the Boston area) as well, my two kids so I kind of wanted to be close to them, but IT was a pretty big influence for me. Hearing how the players really had adapted to Coach Stevens. All the players are playing for him so I just wanted to be a part of that. I remember in Miami when we played them, they looked like they were having so much fun. I don't know, I just felt like I wanted to be a part of that.\"\n\n\"Me and Isaiah always talk,\" Green added. \"We talked in the summer time. I go to his camps that he has in Seattle. I wasn't able to go this past summer because of playoffs but we actively talk all the time. During free agency, I remember Danny (Ainge) gave my agent a call and said, 'Hey, we might be interested in you.' Then I talked to Isaiah and said, 'Hey, what's up? I might be going to Boston.' He was like, 'Man, you need to come here.' I was like, 'Let's make it happen,' so we made it happen.\"\n\nIt happened, and now Green's back where he started his NBA career. How has he changed since the last time he played for the Celtics? Well, that was a long time ago.\n\n\"I was fresh out of high school so I didn't really know any better,\" he said. \"Now, this is my 12th season professionally so I'm very mature now. I still got a lot in the tank. Legs feel good, everything feels good about myself. I feel like I've learned so much about myself. I feel like I'm a way better defensive player. I know I'm a way better defensive player than when I first came here. I know all the schemes and terminology. I just can't wait for (the first practice Tuesday).\"\n\n\"I can still do most of that (dunking) stuff,\" Green added. \"It was just a lot easier to do it obviously when I was 19 than when I was 30. I can still do some of that stuff, yeah, I can. I'm blessed, man. God has blessed me with an amazing opportunity, amazing talent. It's an amazing dream to come back to the team that drafted me so I'm blessed man. I'm blessed to be sitting here talking to you right now. I'm very honest and very humbled to be back with the Boston Celtics.\""
