        "text": "Former Boston Celtics guard Gerald Green is going to join the Rio Grande Vipers, the Houston Rockets G-League affiliate, according to The Athletic and Stadiumâ€™s Shams Charania. He has not registered an NBA minute since 2018-19 . He missed the 2019-20 season with a foot injury. Green had been an assistant coach with the Rockets but left the team Thursday to pursue a return to the NBA.\n\nGreen is a 12-year NBA veteran who has played for eight organizations, including three seasons over two stints with the Celtics and two seasons with the Rockets. He played 160 games in Boston after being drafted with the No. 18 pick in the 2005 NBA draft.\n\nGreen played in 73 games for the Rockets in 2018-19, averaging 20.2 minutes, 9.2 points, 2.5 rebounds and 0.5 assists per game. He was most productive with the Phoenix Suns from 2013 to 2015, when he averaged 14 points per game and shot 38% from 3-point range."
