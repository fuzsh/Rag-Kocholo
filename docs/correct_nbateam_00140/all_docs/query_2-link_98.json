        "text": "After reportedly suffering a broken left foot during a preseason game in Japan against the Toronto Raptors, Houston Rockets guard Gerald Green is in danger of missing the entire season.\n\nThe Athleticâ€™s Shams Charania reports that the injury is worse than initially thought after an initial diagnosis estimated Green would miss a few months.\n\nGreen is a key reserve for the Rockets and a go-to 3-point threat off the bench. The 32-year-old shooting guard has spent the last two seasons in Houston, where he averaged 9.2 points and 2.5 rebounds while hitting 2.1 3-pointers per game at a 35.4 percent clip last season.\n\nHis absence is a blow for a Rockets team built around 3-point shooting on the precipice of the NBA season. His absence will likely lead to more playing time for Ben McLemore and Thabo Sefolosha.\n\nMore from Yahoo Sports:"
