        "text": "MIAMI (AP) - Gerald Green of the Miami Heat was hospitalized Wednesday for unknown reasons, and did not accompany the team to Minnesota for its game there Thursday.\n\nThe Heat have ruled Green out for Thursday's game, citing illness - the same reason given when he sat out Tuesday's home game with Atlanta.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding Green's trip to the hospital were a mystery. He was admitted Wednesday morning, and Miami television station WSVN showed video of Heat guard Mario Chalmers walking outside Jackson Memorial Hospital with a police officer in the afternoon.\n\nAsked if there was any ongoing investigation of Green, a Miami police spokeswoman said no, adding that Miami-Dade Fire Rescue would have more information.\n\n\"We only assisted them with restraining and loading the patient,\" the spokeswoman said.\n\nFire rescue officials said privacy laws prohibited them from revealing whether they transported Green.\n\n\"This morning we were informed that Gerald Green was admitted into the hospital,\" the Heat said in a statement. \"Right now our concerns are with Gerald and we have no further comment at this time.\"\n\nGreen has averaged 10.3 points in three games with the Heat. He signed with the club as a free agent in July."
