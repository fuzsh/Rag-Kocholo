        "text": "Gerald Green started and ended Thursday as a concerned parent. He became the newest Houston Rocket in-between those points.\n\nThe Rockets guard’s whirlwind day included parenting, contract talks and the epic Rockets vs. Boston Celtics game at TD Garden, as USA TODAY’s Jared Weiss recounted prior to tip-off via Twitter.\n\nYes, you read that correctly. Green had been in talks with the Rockets but only came to Boston to check on his son. The Rockets were in town for a nationally televised game, signed him and put him onto their active roster immediately. The only problem is Green didn’t fly with basketball shoes. Luckily, Rockets guard Trevor Ariza wears a similar-sized shoe as Green and happened to have an extra set.\n\nGreen knows his way around Boston, having played for the Celtics between 2005 and 2007 and again in the 2016-17 season."
