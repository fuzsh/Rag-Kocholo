        "text": "Houston Rockets veteran guard Gerald Green could perhaps miss the entire season with a broken left foot, according to a report from Shams Charania of The Athletic.\n\nNews of Green’s injury was first made known on Sunday, with Charania reporting that Green was expected to possibly be sidelined a few months.\n\nGreen suffered the injury, which was initially diagnosed as a sprain, in Japan during the Rockets’ preseason matchups against the Toronto Raptors. Charania reported Sunday that Green would seek more medical opinions on the injury.\n\nGreen had been averaging 10.0 points and 2.3 rebounds in 14.6 minutes over three games this preseason. He was a regular contributor off the bench for the Rockets last season, posting 9.2 ppg in 20.2 mpg over 73 games.\n\nThe Rockets will likely give guards Austin Rivers and Ben McLemore increased action off the bench as Green recovers."
