        "text": "Former Boston Celtics draft pick Gerald Green has announced his retirement and he will join the Houston Rockets coaching staff, the team announced Friday. Green, a Houston native, was picked by the Celtics No. 18 overall in the 2005 draft. He spent his first two seasons with Boston before being traded in the deal that landed the Celtics Kevin Garnett. He later returned to the Celtics for one year in 2016-17 in a bench role, scoring 5.6 points per game.\n\nHis best production came with the Phoenix Suns in 2013-14, where he played in all 82 games and scored nearly 16 points per game while shooting 40% from three-point range. He finished fourth in the league that year in made-three-pointers. In his 12-year career, Green played for eight different NBA teams and overseas.\n\nGreen has not played since 2018-19 after missing last season with a foot injury. He had been a free agent after being waived by the Rockets in December 2020."
