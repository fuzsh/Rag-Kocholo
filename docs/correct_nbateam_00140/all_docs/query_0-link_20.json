        "text": "The Boston Celtics are filling out the back end of the roster. As Sporting New’s Sean Deveny reports, they will sign former prospect Gerald Green to a one-year, guaranteed deal. The Celtics drafted Green 18th overall in the 2005 draft before including him in the Kevin Garnett trade in 2007.\n\nSteve Bulpett of the Boston Herald reports Green will sign for the league-minimum.\n\nGreen brings experience, athleticism and average three-point shooting to the back of the rotation. In a quest to become uber-athletic and constantly fast-breaking, Green fits the need.\n\nAfter coming into the league out of high school, Green is now 30 years old and has become a stable bench contributor in the league. He will compete with the likes of Jaylen Brown and RJ Hunter for minutes in the rotation.\n\nDemetrius Jackson in, Young on the brink\n\nThe Notre Dame standout point guard fell out of the lottery and all the way to the Celtics at the 45th pick. He has signed a guaranteed deal that is still being finalized as the team and Jackson’s camp negotiate years, per Adam Himmelsbach of the Boston Globe.\n\nWith Green, Tyler Zeller and Jackson on guaranteed deals, RJ Hunter, Ben Bentil, John Holland and James Young are in the competition for the 15th spot on the roster. Hunter has the clear advantage, with multiple members of the Celtics front office and coaching staff making public comments about their frustration with Young’s languishing development.\n\nHimmelsbach reports that a source contends there are probably changes coming, which makes sense with the Celtics now having 17 players on the roster including the unsigned Jaylen Brown and non-guaranteed John Holland.\n\nMeanwhile, Abdel Nader’s future is still in limbo. He impressed all observers during the summer league and has strong potential to be a rotation player someday. But with the Celtics’ current roster crunch, finding a place for him in Maine will be a challenge. They do not have the room to keep him on the inactive list and send him to Maine, so he would have to sign a D-League contract with the Red Claws to keep him there. With D-League salaries miles below what is available across the pond, Nader may prefer to sign in Europe or China next season."
