        "text": "The Boston Celtics will have at least one representative in Las Vegas for the NBA's All-Star Weekend, but they'll have to wait for the future to actually land any players in the big game itself.\n\nSecond-year swingman Gerald Green will participate in the Sprite Slam Dunk contest as part of tonight's All-Star events (8:30, TNT), making him just the fourth Celtic in team history to participate. Dee Brown won it as a rookie in 1991 with his arm-across-the-eyes, no-look jam, while both Greg Minor (1996) and Ricky Davis (2004) came up short in their attempts.\n\nGreen has said all week that he has four very special dunks ready for tonight, one of which will incorporate teammate Paul Pierce and should be special for fans of the Celtics' storied history. He's worked on one in practice that involves bouncing the ball off Boston's 1986 championship banner, but that won't work at the Thomas and Mack Center tonight â€” there are no banners hanging from their rafters.\n\nOther rumors include a tribute to Brown's winning jam or something honoring the late Red Auerbach. Could Green, who has a 48-inch vertical leap, possibly dunk the ball, retrieve a cigar from atop the backboard, and light it up on the way down?\n\nReebok, with whom Green has a shoe deal, has chosen the youngster to wear its new shoe for the event, which has been dubbed \"The Gerald Green Show.\"\n\nConsidering the competition, it might be just that.\n\nGreen will face a field that includes 5-foot-9 defending champion Nate Robinson of the Knicks, 6-10 Magic center Dwight Howard and 6-9 Bulls forward Tyrus Thomas.\n\n\"I feel like whatever I've got can top everybody,\" Green told reporters. \"I feel I can dunk just as good as they can. It's a gift that God gave me.\"\n\nOf course, if the judges for the event were actually participating, it would be the greatest dunk contest in the history of the game, and Green's chances would be severely lessened. \"Dr. J\" Julius Erving, Michael Jordan, Dominique Wilkins, Kobe Bryant and Vince Carter will all judge the contest, which includes two new rules: one dunk must involve a teammate, and there is a two-minute time limit for each dunker per round.\n\nLittle guys like Robinson often get the sympathy vote (read: Spudd Webb), but not two years in a row, and not without the 14 attempts he had last year. Howard is supposedly working on a dunk in which he'll dunk two balls and kiss the rim. He also requested that the rim be raised an additional two feet for his dunk, but the request was denied.\n\nTyrus is likely to get booed out of the building after proclaiming the only reason he was participating was for the \"free money,\" a statement which earned him a $10,000 fine from the Bulls.\n\nBut Green seems to be the fan favorite heading into the event, and Reebok has been quick to capitalize. YouTube.com has been inundated with searches for Green's numerous heart-stopping dunks from high school, the McDonald's All-American dunk contest and his brief NBA career. There's even a video posted by Reebok that shows Green preparing for this year's contest by watching film, working out and practicing dunks over a black-jack table and an Elvis impersonator.\n\nEvery one of his teammates thinks Green will win the contest, and they've all offered their advice.\n\n\"A lot of people are, but I'm the GM right now,\" he said. \"I make all the decisions on my dunks. I'm the Danny Ainge of my dunks right now.\"\n\nHmm ... considering Danny Ainge has put together a team that failed to yield one official All-Star (not even in the rookie-sophomore game), maybe Green ought to re-think that approach heading into tonight.\n\nContact Tim Weisberg at timweisberg@hotmail.com\n\nHere are the participants in tonight's Slam Dunk and 3-Point contests, which will be televised by TNT beginning at 8:30. DUNKERS Gerald Green, Celtics Dwight Howard, Magic * Nate Robinson, Knicks Tyrus Thomas, Bulls SKILLS CHALLENGE Kobe Bryant, Lakers LeBron James, Cavaliers Chris Paul, Hornets * Dwyane Wade, Heat 3-POINT SHOOTERS Gilbert Arenas, Wizards Damon Jones, Cavaliers Jason Kapono, Heat Mike Miller, Grizzlies * Dirk Nowitzki, Spurs Jason Terry, Spurs * defending champion\n\nSTAR POWER"
