        "text": "WALTHAM – Gerald Green is a shooter, but he can’t shoot unless he gets the ball.\n\nFortunately for Green, point guard Isaiah Thomas believes in him and will have no qualms about passing to him when they’re on the court together this season with the Celtics.\n\n“When we played in Phoenix,” Thomas recalled of the first half of the 2014-15 season before the Celtics acquired him, “it was like we played together for years because we clicked so easy. I know where he likes the ball, I know where his hot spots are.”\n\n“From right away,” Green said, “when we both stepped on the court, we both had the same mentality – by any means necessary, go get a bucket and go get stops, try to play harder than the next team.”\n\nAs a free agent last summer, Green reached out to Thomas before deciding to return to the Celtics, who took him with the 18th pick in the 2005 draft as a 19-year-old out of high school, but included him in the deal to Minnesota two years later for Kevin Garnett.\n\n“He did call me,” Thomas said, “and Gerald doesn’t call anybody.”\n\nThe 6-foot-7 swingman averaged a career-high 15.8 points and shot a career-best 40 percent from three-point land in 2013-14 for Phoenix, but slumped to 8.9 points and 32.3 percent for Miami last season. Green’s minutes dipped from 22.6 per game in the regular season to only 9.2 in the playoffs and he averaged just 3.3 points and shot only 28.6 percent from beyond the arc. But Thomas still has faith in him.\n\n“We needed someone like him,” Thomas said, “a guy that can shoot the ball, a guy that can space the floor, and he’s just an instant scorer, whether he starts, whether he comes off the bench, that’s what he’s going to do. And he’s explosive.”\n\nCeltics coach Brad Stevens hasn’t had many good shooters in his three years in Boston. So Green has an opportunity to help out.\n\n“He scores in bunches,” Stevens said. “We need to be able to shoot the ball well and make people pay for getting overextended or over-helping, and so we’ve got some threats in the paint. We’ve got some guys that are able to get in the paint. We’ve got to be able to stretch the floor and he helps us do that.” Green, 30, hasn’t taken part in any of the Celtics’ first five practices because of a sore hip flexor.\n\n“I don’t think I stretched properly,” he said. “I’m not 25 no more.”\n\nStevens expects Green to be ready to practice by early next week. After practice Thursday, Green worked up a sweat by taking 3-pointers and he was the last player to leave the court.\n\nGreen is thrilled to be wearing green again.\n\n“This is a great feeling to be back,” he said during media day on Monday. “I’ve been telling everybody since I’ve been back that I never really had hard feelings. Shoot, I would trade myself for Kevin Garnett as well too. So there’s never been any hard feelings at all. I’m glad to be back. I didn’t think I left on bad terms.”\n\nGreen won the 2007 NBA Slam Dunk Contest, but the Celtics won only 33 games his rookie season and dipped to 24 victories the following year.\n\n“Stressful, stressful,” Green said. “Trying to crack the rotation. I know we were losing a lot and it was tough as a team as an organization and for fans to watch it, it was tough, but I do remember just growing. I remember being taught by Paul Pierce, teaching me to be better professional, him and (Brian) Scalabrine.”\n\nGreen has often admitted he wasn’t mature enough to be a productive NBA player early in his career. Traded by Minnesota and then waived by Houston and Dallas, Green took his game and his immaturity to Russia and China.\n\n“It was not what I thought it would be,” he said.\n\nGreen longed to return to the NBA and he realized the only way he could was to grow up and work harder. He got his wish. The Celtics are his fifth NBA team since he returned to the league in March 2012.\n\nAnother reason Green wanted to return to Boston is that his sons, Geremiah, 5, and Julius, who turns 2 in November, live in Dracut.\n\n“It’s going to be great,” he said. “My kids are always around every season. I always want them to be a part of my NBA journey.”\n\nDid those Russian winters prepare him to play in Boston?\n\n“Listen,” he replied, “believe me, it’s like summertime in Boston compared to Russia. Russia is super cold.”\n\nContact Bill Doyle at william.doyle@telegram.com. Follow him on Twitter @BillDoyle15"
