        "text": "Green said he was surprised by the Celtics’ extensive reconstruction after winning 53 games last season.\n\n“But Danny Ainge, he’s a genius, man,” Green said. “He knows what he’s doing. Every year he makes changes that nobody knows. And for some reason they always be successful the next year. So I’m pretty happy for where they are.”\n\nGreen had a minor role with the Celtics last season, but then he stepped into an improbable position as a starter after they fell behind the eighth-seeded Bulls, 2-0, in the opening round of the playoffs.\n\nGreen started the next four games of that series, and the Celtics won each. Green’s highlight was an 18-point, 7-rebound performance in Game 4. Celtics coach Brad Stevens on Thursday said Green was a big part of why Boston advanced to the conference semifinals. When that sentiment was relayed to Green, he waved off the praise.\n\n“I’d tell him he’s being modest,” Green said. “I think it was a team thing. Obviously the way he was able to make adjustments [in] Game 3, Game 4, and throughout the rest of the playoffs was big as well.”\n\nGreen was an unrestricted free agent last summer. He was signed by the Bucks in September before being released at the end of training camp. He said he was told he had made the team, and then the morning after the last preseason game, he said, the franchise had a change of heart. But now he is glad to get a fresh opportunity.\n\n“I already know how I feel about Houston,” Green said. “Especially with everything that Houston’s been through this summer, for me to just be a part of this team and how they’re playing right now, it’s like this definitely was my Christmas gift.”\n\nThe Celtics’ G-League affiliate, the Maine Red Claws, traded for former No. 1 overall pick Anthony Bennett on Thursday. Bennett was selected by the Cavaliers first overall in 2013 but averaged just 4.4 points and 3.8 rebounds over four mostly disappointing seasons with the Cavs, Timberwolves, Raptors, and Nets. Still, the 6-foot-8-inch forward is just 24 and is a talented rebounder.\n\nThe Celtics have a roster spot but cannot call up Bennett from Maine. If they wish to add him to the team they would need to sign him to a contract. Also, any NBA team can sign Bennett while he is playing for the Red Claws.\n\nBut Bennett’s presence in Maine gives the Celtics a good opportunity to get an up-close look at a mostly discarded prospect. Also, the Red Claws run the same system as the Celtics, so Boston’s brass can see how he fares in it.\n\n“We all know that the G-League is being evaluated every day by every team’s scouts. So regardless for your organization or for the other 29, it’s a good thing for the player,” Stevens said. “Then, for us, it’s great because it gives us a chance to coach guys and be around guys and learn about guys that you don’t know as much about until you’re really around them and coaching them. [Red Claws coach] Brandon Bailey — we look at Brandon and Alex [Barlow, his assistant] and their staff as part of our staff. We’re in constant contact with those guys, they do what we do, it’s a real benefit, I think.”\n\nThe Red Claws acquired Bennett and a third-round pick from Phoenix’s affiliate, the Northern Arizona Suns, in exchange for a second-round pick and the rights to former Harvard standout Wesley Saunders.\n\nRockets All-Star Chris Paul on Thursday missed his third consecutive game with a groin injury. Houston also was without starting center Clint Capela, who suffered an orbital fracture in the team’s Christmas Day loss to the Thunder . . . For the Celtics, Jaylen Brown missed his second game in a row with a sore knee and backup forward Semi Ojeleye sat out with back soreness . . . New York Yankees general manager Brian Cashman attended Thursday’s game. He received a locker room tour from longtime Celtics equipment manager John Connor, where Cashman took pictures of his son, Teddy, with Celtics Jayson Tatum, Terry Rozier, and Marcus Morris."
