        "text": "Gerald Green wears his emotions like a neon suit.\n\nGreen's pride comes out as clear as his frustration during games. Recent games have shown a mix as the Suns swingman's role was reduced even as he played well during the team's six-game winning streak that featured more of the three-point-guard lineup.\n\nGreen is playing fewer minutes per game this season (22.2 entering Friday night vs. 28.4 last season) because he started 48 times last season, but he also was down to 18.2 minutes per game during the win streak. Isaiah Thomas' struggles and opponent's backcourt size prompted Green to play more in this week's losses at New Orleans and Oklahoma City.\n\nGreen entered Friday's games with the 13th highest scoring rate in the NBA, averaging 30.0 points per 48 minutes. Only starters are ahead of him now that Golden State's Marreese Speights is a starter.\n\n\"It's frustrating at times, I'm not going to lie, because I'm a basketball player, but I know everybody has made sacrifices on this team,\" Green said. \"I just don't want to be the only person who is pouting about it. Certain games aren't going to be my game. Certain games aren't going to be other people's games. As long as we win with the main goal to make the playoffs, that's all that matters.\"\n\nGreen arrived in Phoenix with that attitude when it looked like he would not have a rotation role entering the 2013 training camp. Green states the same approach, although he clearly is frustrated when he is pulled from games. That includes not finishing games, something he did often last season.\n\n\"It's hard but whatever decision Coach (Jeff Hornacek) makes, I'm always going to ride with it,\" Green said. \"I'm never going to second-guess him. I'm never going to talk to him on the side and ask why because I feel like he's done a great job since last year in getting us prepared to win games.\"\n\nGreen said he recognizes his time to make an impact has shrunk. He seems to be trying to make the most of it, taking a shot every 1.9 minutes â€“ the most frequent rate of his career.\n\nHe is more foul- and turnover-prone, the mistakes that can send him to the bench in moments that can visibly frustrate Green and Hornacek.\n\n\"He's such a good kid,\" Hornacek said. \"You know he's just into the game and wants to do well. Five minutes after the game is over, he's back to normal. It's no effect. You live with him getting a little mad there. We don't want them to show it but you should be upset if you don't get in the game or you come out. Everybody should be competitive enough that they want to be out there.\"\n\nGreen's 3-point percentage (38.7) is nearly on par with last season (40.0) and his rebounding has improved.\n\n\"I was talking to my agent, and he thinks I can be more efficient,\" Green said. \"That's what I was thinking as well because my window is a little bit smaller than last year. Instead of me going out and having eight shot attempts with six 3s, let me see if I can have just four 3s and attack the basket and try to get fouls and rebound better.\n\n\"I don't want to just shoot 3s. I'm not that type of player. I need to be more of a take-what-the-defense-gives-me player and not force the issue. Last year, I was forcing it because I needed to score to help the team win. This year, my scoring really is not needed. I just need to go out there and not make a bozo play and give the other team momentum. Now, we're trying to fight back. I can still take crazy plays.\n\nFree throws\n\n-- Even though Tony Mitchell is not joining the Suns after being acquired in the Anthony Tolliver trade, the Suns have not waived Mitchell in case his guaranteed salary slot is useful in a trade.\n\n-- The Suns entered Friday as the NBA leader in technical fouls with 0.9 per game. Markieff Morris and Eric Bledsoe each has seven technical fouls, one behind leader Russell Westbrook of Oklahoma City.\n\n-- Former Suns player development coach Sean Rooks is Philadelphia's player development coach.\n\n-- Former Suns guard Jason Richardson has not played since Jan. 18, 2013, due to a knee injury, but he is traveling with the 76ers in hopes of returning this month. Richardson, who turns 34 on Jan. 20, could be trade material if shows some of his old form.\n\n-- By a fan vote, NBA TV added a broadcast of Tuesday's Suns-Bucks game, which still will air on Fox Sports Arizona."
