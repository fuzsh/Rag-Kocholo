        "text": "Many are familiar with NBA veteran Gerald Green’s comeback story — being out of the league in 2017, playing pickup basketball in his driveway with his dog before being signed to a contract by the Rockets.\n\nBut there’s more to Green’s time in the league than that, from impressive showings in slam dunk contests to building bonds with some of the current Celtics to returning to the NBA as an assistant coach with the Rockets. Now there is his latest endeavor: preparing for the Big3. Green has stories to tell.\n\nGreen sat down to chat about the Rockets, the NBA, the Big3 and more. This is the Part 2 of a two-part series; Part 1 of Green’s story can be viewed here.\n\n(Editor’s note: Parts of the interview have been edited for clarity and brevity.)\n\nYou’ve worked closely with Rockets head coach Stephen Silas. What is it about him?\n\nI love Silas. I think he’s such a good coach. He teaches so much. He puts the right pressure on the players but not enough for them to break. And that’s huge. That’s huge. Because I’ve played with coaches — won’t name names — that, if I wasn’t good as I was, I would have broken, and I wouldn’t have been in the league 15 years. I would have been in the league three to five years because they put so much pressure on you. You know, Silas doesn’t do that. Silas applies pressure but relieves pressure, too. He installs confidence in you but tells you when you’re lacking in other areas. But it’s not in a way where you feel unconfident; he tells you to where he makes you more confident.\n\nFor instance, if a guy’s outrebounding Al P (Alperen Şengün), coach is not going to say: “Al P, you need to get on the fucking rebounds! You can’t rebound?” He’s gonna say: “Al P, this guy can’t out rebound you. What are you doing? You’re the best rebounder in the world. Don’t let him fucking outrebound you.” Some kids can’t take that. Listen, I get it; it’s no boys allowed, I understand that. But it’s a different world. These kids aren’t how we were growing up. Everybody’s a social media star. So I think Silas does a good job of teaching and making guys accountable but, at the same time, giving guys confidence. That’s very hard for coaches. A lot of coaches don’t do that. Either coaches give you a hell of (a lot of) confidence, or they just scream all day. Silas does all of it, and that’s why I love him for that group. Silas is perfect for this team. I’m not a GM, I’m not (Rafael) Stone, I don’t make decisions, but I really think that he will be there for a while.\n\nYou know I need one John Lucas story from you, too.\n\n(Laughs) I got too many crazy Luc stories. I’m gonna tell you how I first met Luc.\n\nSo I had my high school coach, Juice Williams. Obviously at this time, I knew who John Lucas was, but I wasn’t really working out with him. I just knew who John Lucas was because I know the game. So he’s like, “Man, I’m gonna bring you in there.” I was kind of nervous because I knew there were pros there. I walked in there, I saw Dwight Howard, Josh Smith, Cuttino Mobley, Steve Francis, Maurice Taylor. Pros after pros after pros, bro. Lucas said, “You wanna play?” I was nervous, but I didn’t say no. I remember just having my moment playing with those guys when I shouldn’t have been playing. I remember Luc was like, “You stay with me, boy, you’re gonna be a pro.” And that’s what I did. He was right. I stuck with him until I made it, and even after that, I stuck with him. Luc is hard-nosed like a motherfucker, but man, he’s helped me. He’s another person that I have to thank a lot. He’s helped me a lot in my career.\n\nYou’ve talked about almost playing in the NBA Finals. You have ties to the Boston Celtics. What do you recall about being around guys like Jaylen Brown and Marcus Smart?\n\n(Former head coach) Brad Stevens would bring me in the office, and Amir Johnson and Al Horford were the older guys. A lot of times, I wasn’t playing, but I wouldn’t be that type of guy in the locker room who still wouldn’t teach. And that was my role. I recall just me, Marcus Smart, Jaylen Brown, we would always play one-on-one together. Always. And I remember Jaylen just being special. Marcus has always been special. He never gets the credit because he’s that guy when you look at the stat sheet. You’re gonna be like, “Oh he didn’t play that good,” but if you know basketball and watch the game, you’ll see how effective he is all around the court.\n\nI’m very pleased with their growth; it’s not a surprise at all. Opportunities like this don’t come often. They don’t. Sometimes, you’ll get here. Sometimes, you don’t. But when you’re here, you gotta take full advantage of it.\n\nThere’s also a backstory to your Celtics tenure during that 2007 dunk contest, if I’m not mistaken. You’ve mentioned it to me before.\n\nMan, it was crazy. I never really worked on those dunks in Vegas. I’ve never worked on any of my dunk contests, ever. Even the one where I blew out the cake, I never really practiced it. Paul Pierce was my partner. So, how I remember, going all the way up until the dunk contest, I didn’t see P! I was calling him, but he wouldn’t answer my phone. So I’m nervous like, damn, I’m in my second year in the league, I don’t want to not have a partner. So, I’m asking Ben Gordon if Paul Pierce doesn’t come, can you be my partner? He’s like yeah, for sure, bro, no problem.\n\nAs soon as I’m getting ready to go up (and dunk), Paul comes out of nowhere, shirt untucked, talking crazy. He’s at All-Star having a good time. I was like, “Where have you been?” He’s like: “Man, I’ve been at poker winning some money, young fella. Don’t worry about it, let’s get this dunk contest and win.” And we won that shit. So, that was crazy. People don’t know that I almost didn’t have a partner. But P came through in the clutch. That’s what Paul Pierce does. He’s probably the clutchest player of all time.\n\nAnd what about the famous cupcake dunk in 2008?\n\nMy brother thought of that. He called me one day; he knew I was going back into the dunk contest to defend my title. He was like, “I had a dream that you blew out a cupcake, you blew out a candle.” I went to a restaurant with some friends. And when they sing happy birthday, they bring out the cake and the candle, and it clicked in my head. I knew I could get my head above the rim. I just didn’t want to get close to where I can hit my teeth. So when I saw that, and I saw the lady blow out the candle where her cake was, it instantly popped in my head like, that’s it. And so again, I never tried it until the event, and it worked out perfectly. But those are the best dunks man, the ones that you don’t practice. You just see if you can do it or not.\n\nSo why the Big3? Why now? Are you looking to prove something, to yourself or to others?\n\nI’m looking to show everybody that I’m still an NBA player. Like, I’m trying to get back. I know my age is my age, but I’m still running faster than somebody 10 years younger than me. I’m jumping higher than somebody who’s 10 years younger than me. And I know I’m damn sure smarter than somebody 10 years younger than me. So there shouldn’t be any reason why I don’t get another opportunity. Even if it’s a training-camp deal, non-guaranteed (deal), couple 10-days … that’s just why I’m trying to prove, but at the same time, trying to go have some fun. Summertime ball, you know? If you want to be technical, I just unretired in January, and it hasn’t been a full year, so why not? Why take this break? I already took a break, so let me go ahead and do it for myself, do it for my fans. It’s a league that I want to be a part of. I like the Big3. I like what they’re doing for the game of basketball.\n\nWherever you end up playing, your trainer will be right by your side, right? The bond with Kenny Ellis has been pretty important over the years, but how has that relationship grown through your different career phases?\n\nThat’s my dog. I feel like sometimes, I don’t do enough for him. He’s done so much for me in my career. I thank him a lot. We talk all the time, always check on each other. Me and Kenny talk for hours on the phone, just talking about everything — life, kids, basketball, wives. It’s not just like: “Hey, you coming to the gym today? OK, I’ll see you at 11.” It’s never like that, you know what I mean? Kenny’s like family to me, man. Sometimes, I feel like I don’t do enough for him, because he’s been a very key focal point in my development and in my career.\n\n(Photo: Alex Bierens de Haan / Getty Images)"
