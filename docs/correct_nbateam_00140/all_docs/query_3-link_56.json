        "text": "\"Man, he's going to help us out,\" Thomas said. \"He can shoot the ball. He's athletic, something we don't really have: a knockdown shooter and someone that can create for himself.\n\n\"When we played in Phoenix together, it was tough, because we played so well together, and they had two other guards that were pretty good as well.\n\n\"I'm excited to get things going, and he's been here before, so it's nothing new for him. I know he's going to help us, and I know he's excited.\"\n\nGreen's best pro season came in 2013-14 with the Suns, one year before Thomas arrived, when he averaged 15.8 points and 3.4 rebounds per game. He also made 40 percent of his 3-pointers while shooting them at a high volume, 6.2 per game.\n\nThe following year, Green and Thomas were caught in a bit of a logjam in the backcourt, along with Eric Bledsoe and Goran Dragic. Last season Green, the 18th overall pick of the 2005 draft, played for the Heat and struggled to make shots, converting 39.2 percent of his field-goal attempts overall and 32.3 percent of his 3-point tries. But the Celtics believe that Green can still be dangerous.\n\n\"I've been a big Gerald Green fan, because I've been scared of him,\" Celtics coach Brad Stevens said recently. \"And I think that that's a great way to figure out how good a player is. When you go into a game, he's on your scouting report, maybe in a highlighted way, because he could go off for a lot of points in a short amount of time. He can change the course of a game.\n\n\"Does he do it every night, historically? No. But he's had moments and times where he's done that. So I think he brings a spurt-ability to us that we clearly needed from a scoring standpoint.\"\n\nGreen is expected to compete for playing time with rookie forward Jaylen Brown, second-year guard R.J. Hunter, and third-year wing James Young, although Hunter and Young are likely to be in a training camp competition to earn the team's final roster spot.\n\n\"I mean, he's ready,\" Thomas said of Green. \"He's more mature now. He's ready for the opportunity.\n\n\"I know Coach Brad is excited to have him because, like I said, he's someone you can throw the ball to and he can get a bucket. If he can't do anything else, he can go and score the basketball.\n\n\"I'm excited to have him, another piece to the puzzle, and I know he's ready.\"\n\nThe Celtics will open training camp Sept. 27.\n\n. . .\n\nLast Tuesday, 14-year-old Robbie McNulty was shooting baskets by himself at St. Peter's Park in Cambridge when Thomas stopped over and joined him for an impromptu shootaround.\n\nNow, after getting to play with Thomas, Robbie will get a chance to join him at work. McNulty's mother, Siri, said \"Good Morning America\" contacted her regarding the Globe's story about the chance meeting between Robbie and Thomas.\n\nOn Monday morning, the show aired a live segment with Robbie recounting his experience with the NBA All-Star, and at the end, it showed taped footage of Thomas at the Celtics' practice facility, inviting Robbie to be his guest at a Celtics game at TD Garden this season.\n\nThomas was leaving back-to-school night for parents Tuesday at his son Jaiden's school, Cambridge Montessori, when he saw Robbie shooting baskets and decided to join him for about 10 minutes.\n\n\"I bet he didn't even think it would be that big of a deal to me,\" Robbie said. \"But for me, like, it's crazy.\""
