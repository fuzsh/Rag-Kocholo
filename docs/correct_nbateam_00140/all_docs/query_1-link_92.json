        "text": "Jae Crowder\n\nMiami Heat center Hassan Whiteside pulls down a defensive rebound in front of Boston Celtics forward Jae Crowder (99) in the first quarter of an NBA basketball game, Wednesday, April 13, 2016, in Boston. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola)\n\nThe Boston Celtics had a lot of overachievers on the roster last season, which was a big part of the reason the team was so successful without a generally agreed-upon superstar -- winning 48 games and tying for the third-best record in the Eastern Conference.\n\nThat success can be partially attributed to coach Brad Stevens. It might not be fair to his players to say Stevens helped them overachieve, but he did help put many of them in position to reach their highest potential.\n\nOver at ESPN Boston, the Celtics Summer Forecast panel debated\n\nHere's the link to the full post, and here's my response:\n\nTom Westerholm, MassLive (Gerald Green): Heaven help me, I believe in Brad Stevens. After witnessing Jordan Crawford's resuscitation, it's impossible not to. It's entirely possible Green doesn't even get on the floor, but if he does, are you putting it past Stevens to turn Green into a 3-point-shooting and windmill-dunking threat? I'm not.\n\nThis was a tough question, because frankly, the answer might very well be \"all of them.\" On how many teams is Isaiah Thomas an All-Star? On how many teams are Jae Crowder and Avery Bradley borderline untradeable?\n\nBut one of the biggest overachievers of the past few years was Crawford, who even earned Eastern Conference Player of the Week honors at one point. Like Crawford, Green can heat up and score a ton, and the Celtics have a very real need for a shooter. If Green can make a good percentage of his 3-point attempts, he'll certainly get on the floor for the Celtics and could become a corner 3-point threat that provides valuable spacing (and hopefully catches a few high-flying alley-oops).\n\nGreen could also shoot roughly 32 percent from behind the arc (like last year) and be out of the rotation fairly quickly. If he isn't producing, Stevens won't play him. But he will get a chance, and on a veteran minimum contract, he could certainly prove to be an overachiever."
