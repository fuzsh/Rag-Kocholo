        "text": "Green managed 12 points (5-15 FG, 2-10 3Pt), four rebounds and two assists across 27 minutes in Thursday's 120-103 victory over the Texas Legends in the Western Conference Semifinals.\n\nGreen was not the most efficient shooter on Thursday, but his side downed the Legends comfortably enough that it didn't matter in the end. That being said, he will want to get closer to his season averages of 42.6 percent from the field and 34.7 percent from deep in the Conference Final on Saturday.\n\nGreen tallied 16 points (6-12 FG, 4-8 3Pt, 0-1 FT), three rebounds and three assists across 26 minutes in Saturday's 130-128 loss to the Agua Caliente Clippers.\n\nGreen shot 50 percent from beyond the arc Saturday as he made an impact off the bench against Agua Caliente. He's averaging 16.6 points per game this season as the Vipers head into the G League playoffs.\n\nGreen put up 26 points (9-17 FG, 7-14 3Pt, 1-1 FT), three rebounds, two assists and a block across 33 minutes in Friday's 110-100 victory over the Stockton Kings.\n\nGreen made half of his three-pointers Friday as he led his team in scoring against the Kings. He's shooting an impressive 9.3 times per game from beyond the arc in the G League this season and is making 36.7 percent of those shots.\n\nGreen posted 30 points (11-27 FG, 6-17 3Pt, 1-1 FT), six rebounds, one assist and two steals across 43 minutes in Saturday's 139-131 loss to the Memphis Hustle.\n\nGreen shot 40.7 percent from the field and 35.3 percent from deep Saturday, which is in line with his season averages for RGV. With a few injured teammates for the game, his 30 points wasn't enough to defeat the Hustle.\n\nGreen logged 11 points (4-6 FG, 3-4 3Pt), four rebounds, an assist and a block across 19 minutes in Friday's 124-106 victory over the Iowa Wolves.\n\nGreen shot efficiently off the bench Friday, and he's averaging 16.9 points per game despite starting in just five of his 12 appearances for RGV this season. He's making just 36.5 percent of his 8.0 three-point attempts per game, however.\n\nGreen tallied 15 points (6-15 FG, 1-9 3Pt, 2-2 FT), 11 rebounds, one assist, four blocks and a steal across 26 minutes in Thursday's 115-111 victory over the South Bay Lakers.\n\nGreen wasn't very efficient, but he made up for it with a good effort defensively and on the glass, and he still ended up with a double-double despite his limited minutes against the Lakers. He's averaging 19.2 points in 28.5 minutes per game for RGV this season.\n\nGreen tallied 23 points (7-14 FG, 2-7 3Pt, 5-5 FT), 11 rebounds, three assists, one steal and one block in 33 minutes during Wednesday's 127-117 win over the Sioux Falls Skyforce.\n\nGreen has scored 20-plus points in all five of his starts since joining the Vipers. Across nine total appearances with Rio Grande Valley, the 36-year-old is averaging 19.7 points, 5.6 rebounds, 2.1 assists and 1.1 steals in 28.7 minutes.\n\nGreen registered 27 points (10-17 FG, 6-11 3Pt, 1-1 FT), nine rebounds and one assist in 34 minutes during Tuesday's 130-119 loss to the Sioux Falls Skyforce.\n\nGreen was back in the starting lineup Tuesday and scored a season-high 27 points, notching his fifth 20-plus point outing since joining the G League. He also tied his season-high with nine boards, a mark he's reached twice. Across eight appearances (four starts) with Rio Grande Valley, the 36-year-old is averaging 19.3 points, 4.9 rebounds, 2.0 assists and 1.1 steals in 28.2 minutes per game.\n\nGreen mustered 14 points (5-10 FG, 3-6 3Pt, 1-1 FT), four rebounds and one assist in 27 minutes during Thursday's 139-127 win over the Austin Spurs.\n\nGreen bounced back from his first single-digit scoring outing with the Vipers to notch an efficient 14 points Thursday. Across six appearances with Rio Grande Valley, the 36-year-old is averaging 18.2 points, 4.5 rebounds, 2.2 assists and 1.3 steals in 27.4 minutes.\n\nGreen recorded 20 points (8-13 FG, 3-6 3Pt, 1-1 FT), three rebounds and two assists in 17 minutes during Friday's 127-115 win over the Santa Cruz Warriors.\n\nGreen has scored at least 20 points in all four of his contests with the Vipers. The 36-year-old is on the NBA comeback trail and is averaging 21.5 points, 5.0 rebounds, 2.3 assists, 1.8 steals and 1.3 blocks across 28.8 minutes per game in the G League.\n\nGreen put up 24 points (8-16 FG, 6-12 3Pt, 1-1 FT), two rebounds and three assists across 31 minutes in Wednesday's 112-100 victory over the Austin Spurs. He also had six steals and a block in the game.\n\nGreen missed Monday's loss to the Spurs with an undisclosed injury, but he returned emphatically in Wednesday's rematch. He will need to cut down on his four turnovers in the game, but he was able to offset that impact with an amazing defensive performance as well.\n\nGreen did not dress for Monday's 127-124 loss to the Austin Spurs with an undisclosed injury.\n\nGreen is dealing with an injury or illness at the moment, but his next opportunity to return will be in Wednesday's rematch against the Spurs. He is averaging 21 points, 7.5 rebounds and two blocks per game in the G League this season.\n\nGreen tallied 22 points (8-24 FG, 6-14 3Pt, 0-1 FT), nine rebounds, an assist, a steal and a block across 35 minutes in Saturday's 117-115 loss to the Agua Caliente Clippers.\n\nGreen was a threat from deep in his second game for RGV on Saturday, and he's been a big focal point for the team so far with 21 points and 7.5 rebounds per game. He's attempted 12 and 14 three-pointers in his two games, respectively, but he improved significantly against Agua Caliente (42.9 percent) compared to his percentage against South Bay on Thursday (16.7 percent).\n\nGreen posted 20 points (6-17 FG, 2-12 3Pt, 4-4 FT), six rebounds, three assists and three blocks across 33 minutes in Thursday's 130-121 loss to the South Bay Lakers.\n\nGreen put up solid numbers Thursday in his first G League game in a decade, but he was wasteful with his shooting against the Lakers despite leading his team in scoring. He made just 16.7 percent of his 12 three-point shots in the game, but he is a 36.1 percent career shooter from deep in the NBA, so that may be due to rust.\n\nGreen signed a G League contract with the Rio Grande Valley Vipers on Friday, Shams Charania of The Athletic reports.\n\nGreen, who had been working as an assistant coach for the Rockets, averaged 9.1 points and 2.4 rebounds in 18.6 minutes per game across 12 professional seasons, but he announced his retirement from professional basketball in October after not playing during the 2020-21 season. However, with a record number of players appearing in NBA games this season, the soon-to-be 36-year-old will try to follow in the footsteps of Isaiah Thomas, Joe Johnson and Lance Stephenson by making a return to NBA action during these unprecedented times. It's unclear when Green will be officially available to play in a game for the Vipers.\n\nGreen announced his retirement from professional basketball Friday, Cayleigh Griffin of AT&amp;T SportsNet Southwest reports.\n\nGreen was waived by the Rockets ahead of the 2020-21 campaign and didn't end up finding work elsewhere. The 35-year-old averaged 9.1 points and 2.4 rebounds in 18.6 minutes per game across 12 professional seasons. He'll now embark on a coaching career after accepting a position on the Rockets' player development staff.\n\nGreen was waived by the Rockets on Saturday, Jonathan Feigen of the Houston Chronicle reports.\n\nGreen joined the Rockets on a one-year, non-guaranteed contract for training camp, but he was unable to land a roster spot during the regular season. The veteran didn't suit up last season but averaged 9.2 points and 2.5 rebounds over 20.2 minutes per game across 73 appearances in 2018-19. It's unclear whether he'll find another spot on a roster this season.\n\nGreen signed a one-year, non-guaranteed contract with the Rockets on Monday, Tim MacMahon of ESPN reports.\n\nGreen was on the Rockets' roster heading into last season, but he broke his foot during the preseason and was eventually moved to Denver -- and subsequently waived -- at the trade deadline. The veteran wing did not suit up for an NBA game in 2019-20, but he'll return to Houston and look to make the roster on a veteran's minimum contract. In 2018-19, Green appeared in 73 games for the Rockets and averaged 9.2 points and 2.5 rebounds in 20.2 minutes."
