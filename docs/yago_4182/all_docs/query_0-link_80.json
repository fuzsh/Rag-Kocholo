        "text": "MARITAL STATUS\n\nProfessions Director , Screenwriter , Actor more\n\nNationality French\n\nBirth October 25, 1889 (Paris)\n\nDeath November 10, 1981\n\nBIOGRAPHY\n\nBorn Abel Eugène Alexandre Perthon in Paris in 1889 (natural child of another, he would not be legitimized until the age of three by the marriage of his mother and Adolphe Gance), Abel Gance is, in the same way as Louis Delluc or Marcel L’Herbier , one of the pioneers of French (and international) cinema, coming after the generation of Lumière and Méliès . Attracted by theater and literature, he became an actor in 1908, playing the young Molière in a film by Léonce Perret (1909), writing tragedies, poems and screenplays (notably for the same Perret), before he wrote to him is finally asked to move on to production. In 1915, The Madness of Doctor Tube , a festival of tricks and daring, marked the first real breakthrough (and the first failure, without consequences) of this born experimenter, who would never stop pushing the limits of technology (he received the International Prize for Invention in 1954, after having developed various processes, including polyvision – for his Napoleon – or the pictograph).\n\nAuthor of propaganda films during the war (including The Death Zone), from 1917 he made Mater Dolorosa , The Tenth Symphony , J’accuse and La Roue , which would reveal him. Above all, in 1927, he produced his great work, Napoleon seen by Abel Gance , full of technical and visual innovations, initially planned to be part of a set of six films dedicated to the emperor. He plays Saint-Just, Antonin Artaud inheriting the role of Marat. The film will have sound in 1934 ( Napoleon, seen and heard by Abel Gance ), and modified in 1971 (version known under the title Bonaparte and the Revolution ). Hailed as a major work in the history of cinema, this success will however have no real future, the lyricism, the excessive ambition of Gance subsequently coming up against both economic constraints and criticism.\n\nIn 1931, The End of the World , a disaster film in which he played the lead role, was a failure, and the filmmaker, as admired for his inventiveness and imagination as vilified for his grandiloquence, did not really recover. He was unable to complete some of his projects (Christopher Colomb, Ignace de Loyola, Scarron…), due to lack of funds, and therefore made films considered less personal, literary adaptations (Le Capitaine Fracasse, 1942) or films historical ( Lucrèce Borgia with Edwige Feuillère , 1935; Jérôme Perreau hero of the barricades, evocation of the Fronde, 1935), among others. Among his following films, we can still cite A Great Love by Beethoven (1936), Paradise Lost (1940), La Tour de Nesle (1955), Austerlitz (1960) or Cyrano et d’Artagnan (1964). Awarded the first Grand National Cinema Prize in 1974, Abel Gance received an honorary César in 1981, a few months before his death, at the age of 92."
