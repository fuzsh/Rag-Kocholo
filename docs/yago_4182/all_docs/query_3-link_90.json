        "text": "This Sunday on London’s South Bank, film buffs of all ages will fill the Royal Festival Hall to witness a unique cinematic spectacle: Abel Gance’s Napoleon, accompanied by the London Philharmonia.\n\nIt’s a rare chance to see this 5½ hour epic as it should be seen, on the big screen with a full orchestra (if you can’t be there on Sunday, the British Film Institute’s new digitally restored version is in cinemas nationwide next week).\n\nNinety years since it was made, Napoleon still seems revolutionary - and the story behind the movie is almost as dramatic as the film itself\n\nNinety years since it was made, Napoleon still seems revolutionary - and the story behind the movie is almost as dramatic as the film itself.\n\nGance’s silent masterpiece was supposed to be the first of a six part series, but after the French auteur blew nearly all the budget on the first film, about Napoleon’s early life, the studio pulled the plug.\n\nThe other five films were never made and Gance’s Napoleon remained a fragment of what might have been - albeit a fragment with a running time of seven hours.\n\nNapoleon took two years to make, and was fraught with mishaps (Albert Dieudonné, who played the title role, nearly drowned while filming a storm scene in Corsica; Gance was badly burned while filming the siege of Toulon) yet the result was a tour de force.\n\nThe crowd scenes were spectacular and Gance’s direction was mesmeric, particularly his innovative camerawork. He attached a camera to a galloping horse, a pendulum, a guillotine. His rapid cutting was unprecedented. His split-screen editing was similarly avant-garde.\n\nThe film's crowning glory was its closing scene, a hypnotic triptych in which Napoleon's vast army marches toward the viewer, spread across three screens.\n\nThe opening night, at the Paris Opera in 1927, received lavish praise and fierce condemnation, sometimes even in the same reviews.\n\n‘A great work,’ declared the French writer Jean Prevost, ‘full of incoherence and puerility.’ Paris Soir called it a ‘titanic poem, worthy of the hero who inspired it,’ but distributors were frightened by the film’s titanic length. They cut the movie themselves (invariably a catastrophe for moviemakers), even tampering with the running order.\n\nThese mangled versions did immense damage to the film’s reputation. Gance became so depressed, he even destroyed some of his own footage. By the 1950s, Napoleon had virtually disappeared.\n\nOver the next twenty years, between other jobs, he gradually reassembled Gance’s greatest film\n\nThat might have been that if it hadn’t been for a schoolboy cinephile in London called Kevin Brownlow.\n\nFor Christmas, Kevin’s parents bought him a film projector, and he was scouring the libraries for old films to play on it when he stumbled upon the first two reels of Napoleon. Kevin had never heard of it, but when he saw it he was enthralled.\n\n\"One of the indications of great art is you want to see it again and again and again, and you never get tired of it, and that’s true of Napoleon,\" he says. \"It’s the most fantastic feeling just lying back and watching that amazing footage.\"\n\nKevin tracked down another four reels, and when Gance visited the BFI, Kevin bunked off school to go and meet him. He found a copy of the script, so he could see what material was still missing.\n\nWhen he left school, he became a film editor and film historian. Over the next twenty years, between other jobs, he gradually reassembled Gance’s greatest film.\n\nFinally, in 1980, his 5½ hour restoration premiered at the Empire Cinema in London’s Leicester Square, with a new orchestral accompaniment, conducted by Carl Davis.\n\nMuch of the original score, by Arthur Honegger, had been lost, so Davis created a mélange of music by composers of Napoleon’s own era: Mozart, Hadyn and – above all - Beethoven.\n\nAs Davis says, Beethoven’s oeuvre echoed Napoleon’s own character. \"What characterises Beethoven’s music? It has drive, it has surprise, it has deep feeling, a sense destiny. It has all these characteristics which are Napoleonic.\""
