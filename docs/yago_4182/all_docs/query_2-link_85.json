        "text": "Members of the Beethoven Project have used algorithms to finish composing his final uncompleted symphony.\n\nWhen Beethoven died in 1827, he left behind nine symphonies that were complete and fragments of a 10th.\n\nTo mark the 250th anniversary of the composer's birth, a team of musicologists and programmers, together with telecommunications company Deutsche Telekom, launched the ambitious project of teaching a computer to complete the symphony using artificial intelligence, or AI.\n\nIn order to train the algorithm, the team played snippets of Beethoven.\n\nAn algorithm was left to improvise and then was taught what was appropriate and what could be viewed as a mistake.\n\nThe finished piece premiered during a livestream of Beethovenfest over the weekend."
