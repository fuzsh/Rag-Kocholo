My experience of this album on CD has been of a very clean, slightly bright and thin sound ...\n\nLux - Brevik | Robert Fernandes - August 3, 2024\n\nWell said Marcus!\n\nYes: The Yes Album | Downunderman - August 6, 2024\n\nAgree with Analogue on this one. Really surprisingly good.\n\nJohn Coltrane: Live at the Village Vanguard | Downunderman - August 18, 2024\n\nThis version was released in May 2024 and the jacket advises it is mastered by Ryan Smith of Sterling Sound. The Obi. advises it as \"Verve Label Group 2024 DSD\". It is a ...\n\nBruckner: Symphony No. 7, Bates: Resurrexit - Honeck | Rudolf de Vries - August 17, 2024\n\nI recently downloaded this recording from the Native dsd website in the dxd (32 bit) format. Bruckner is one of my favorite composers, I always loved his 7th symphony, really ...\n\nDvořák: Symphonies 6-9 - Davis | Steven Harrison - August 13, 2024\n\nYes. But only Symphony 6 was released as sacd. The others were rbcd. Symphonies 7-9 were some of the early LSO Live releases.\n\nRameau: Keyboard Suites - Hewitt | breydon_music - August 11, 2024\n\nAbsolutely agree with you Stephen, and the shame is that if you dip a toe into Hyperion's Hewitt CD's expecting more of the same you will be sorely disappointed in audio ...\n\nDvořák: Symphonies 6-9 - Davis | John Broggio - August 17, 2024\n\nAlso Smetana: Má vlast - Davis\n\nDvořák: Symphonies 6-9 - Davis | hiredfox - Yesterday 11:22 pm\n\nDvorak's 9th was also a SACD recording, part of the SCD Anthology set.\n\nHighResolutionAudio.net (or HRAudio.net for short) is the home for independent information and reviews of hi-res music content ... in both stereo and multichannel ... including Super Audio CD and Blu-ray Audio. Full details, reviews and links to a number of online vendors for purchase are provided.\n\nBy simply creating a login you can comment on the music or reviews, maintain a library here of the music you own and add others to a wish list.\n\n(High Resolution here is defined as anything better than CD quality. Since most music nowadays is recorded, or mastered from analogue, at better than 16bits/44.1kHz it makes sense to acquire the maximum lossless resolution available.)\n\nRecent Reviews\n\nHow to get the most from this site:\n\nClick/tap on the Menu icon at top right to navigate throughout the site. Some functions (e.g. My Library) require you to have created a login and be logged in.\n\nWhen you move your mouse pointer over thumbnails, a small More icon may appear. Click/tap on this to access additional functions (such as moving music from your Wish List to Library). In My Library you can rename individual titles to your requirements (click/tap on the title name in the popup window to edit in-place and hit Return).\n\nThis site implements Responsive Web Design. What's displayed will adapt to your screen/window size, tablet orientation etc. Changes in layout and/or additional information may appear as space is available.\n\nIf you click/tap on a vendor name (e.g. amazon.com) it will take you directly to the corresponding listing on that store. This is generally more reliable (and a lot more convenient) than searching the vendor site yourself. It will also ensure your purchases help contribute to the upkeep of this site.\n\nIf you subscribe to Apple Music you can listen to much of the content here in full. Follow the link and load music onto your smartphone for later listening, for example. This is a great way to sample before you buy, especially for unfamiliar repertoire.\n\nSubscribe to this site's RSS feed to be immediately notified when a new review is added.\n\nUser registration is entirely automated. If you didn't receive an email in a timely fashion, check your spam folder. Due to the vagaries of email, sometimes mail doesn't get through. Try registering again a week later after which your details are recycled.\n\nThis site is designed to work with modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox (Mozilla), Safari and Microsoft Edge. It has been tested extensively with the latest versions of all four. It also works great with Chrome for Android and Safari for iOS."
