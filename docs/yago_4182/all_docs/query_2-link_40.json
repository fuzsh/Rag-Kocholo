Feel free to browse our performances in the meantime.\n\nVirginia G. Piper Music Director Tito Muñoz Extends Tenure to Conclude in 2024 with Triumphant Tenth Season\n\nAfter ten years as artistic leader of The Phoenix Symphony, Muñoz’s tenure is one of the longest in Phoenix Symphony history. Praised for his versatility, technical clarity, and keen musical insight, Tito Muñoz is internationally recognized as one of the most gifted conductors on the podium today. As a proponent of new music, Tito founded The Phoenix Symphony’s REVERB festival, which celebrates newly composed music through some of contemporary classical music’s most respected living composers and performers.\n\nRead Full Press Release\n\nThe Phoenix Symphony’s signature fundraiser, SAVOR THE SYMPHONY, is a must-attend social event. Guests receive exclusive access to “eavesdrop” on an orchestra rehearsal and meet guest artists. The delicious luncheon is curated by one of the Valley’s preeminent chefs.\n\nThis year, we honor Virginia G. Piper Music Director Tito Muñoz, who is leaving the Symphony after ten years of conducting our world-class orchestra.\n\nDmitri Shostakovich struggled his entire life to maintain his integrity as an artist while also serving the Soviet state as required. His 10th Symphony, completed after the death of dictator Joseph Stalin, was a balancing act as well as a mid-life crisis set to music. The Phoenix Symphony welcomes pianists Michael Stephen Brown and Adam Golka to play Mozart’s Concerto for Two Pianos (No. 10), which Mozart composed for himself and his sister, Maria Anna, to perform. Tito Muñoz conducts the world premiere of a new piece by multidisciplinary artist Annie Nikunen exploring the connections between movement and sound.\n\nWhen Gustav Mahler debuted his Second Symphony, it was immediately clear that the popularity of the symphony nicknamed “Resurrection” would last well beyond his lifetime. In fact, Classical Music Magazine dubbed Mahler’s Symphony No. 2 one of the greatest symphonies of all time. The Phoenix Symphony concludes its season with the musical journey that begins at the funeral bier of a beloved friend and ends with redemption and resurrection in a mighty choral finale. Katherine Whyte, a compellingly dramatic soprano, and Megan Esther Grey, a potently precise contralto, join The Phoenix Symphony Chorus in a work that is both profound and extraordinary."
