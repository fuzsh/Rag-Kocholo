        "text": "The evolution of immunoassay diagnostics\n\nFrom the laboratory to self-testing at home\n\nDefinition\n\nAn immunoassay is a test that exploits the binding reaction between an antigen and antibody to detect and measure specific substances in biological samples, such as blood and other bodily fluids. Used for a wide range of applications in both science and medicine, the test has several formats. Immunoassays are routinely used for clinical diagnostics, biopharmaceutical analysis, therapeutic drug monitoring, drug abuse testing, environmental monitoring and food safety testing.\n\nDiscovery\n\nThe development of immunoassays is rooted in the late nineteenth century when scientists made a number of discoveries while investigating how the body defends itself against microbial infections. Among those who spearheaded this work were Emil von Behring and Paul Ehrlich, two scientists based in Germany. In the 1890s they noticed that serum appeared to contain a substance that could inactivate foreign invaders like bacteria.\n\nFor some time it was unclear how the substance worked and remained a controversial issue between immunologists based in Germany and France. The source of protection in blood was subsequently identified to be an antibody, a form of protein produced by the immune system in response to antigens which are proteins that the immune system recognises as non-self or altered self. Antigens are often found on the surface of foreign substances and cancerous cells. Antibodies are usually highly specific, meaning that they only recognise and bind to one specific antigen.\n\nFirst serological tests using antibody-antigen reaction\n\nOne of the first to take advantage of the antibody-antigen binding interaction was George-Fernand Widal, a French physician. In 1896 he developed a rapid diagnostic for the detection of Salmonella Typhi, a bacterium known to cause typhoid and food poisoning. Widal reported that it was possible to diagnose if patients were infected based on whether their blood formed clumps, known as agglutination, when mixed with a suspension of killed S. Typhi bacterial cells. Visible to the naked eye, such clumping singled out patients who had developed antibodies for the bacteria as a result of infection.\n\nSoon after this, in 1901, two Belgian scientists, Jules Bordet and his brother-in-law Octave Gengou, pioneered another method to detect the presence of a specific antibody or antigen. Known as the 'complement-fixation test', it was based on the discovery of another important protective component in sera. First spotted in 1891 by Hans Buchner, a German bacteriologist, the substance was initially called 'alexin', meaning 'to ward off' in Greek. It was subsequently renamed 'complement' after Bordet found that it helped antibodies that were bound to the bacterium to destroy the foreign target. Antibodies bind well without complement but once bound they interact with complement to eliminate the target. Unlike antibodies, Bordet noticed that the complement was not antigen-specific (Nesargikar, Spiller, Chavez). Bordet and Gengou's test took advantage of the specific way complement proteins bind to antibodies to detect infectious agents in blood. Their test was initially used for diagnosing typhoid before going on to be adapted for many diseases, including syphilis.\n\nAnother important figure in the evolution of immunoassays was Karl Landsteiner, an Austrian biologist based at the University of Vienna. In 1900 he began investigating why some blood transfusions were more successful than others. As part of this work, he noticed two distinct reactions when he mixed together blood samples from different people. They would either clump together or not. After extensive tests Landsteiner established there to be at least three types of human blood. These could be differentiated by the type of antigen the red blood cells carried on their cell surface membrane. It also explained why two people's blood was not always compatible with one another. By 1909 Landsteiner and his colleagues had classified human blood into four groups (A, B, AB and O). Paving the way to making blood transfusion safe, Landsteiner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1930 for his finding.\n\nIn addition to his pioneering work on blood groups, in 1917 Landsteiner devised a way to chemically treat proteins to produce artificial antigens. He was inspired to do this based on the work of two Austrian scientists Ernest Pick and Friedrich Obermeyer. In 1906 they demonstrated that it was possible to chemically modify the antigenic properties of a protein. One of Landsteiner's aims in developing the artificial antigens was to help him investigate the specificity of antibodies. Experimenting with the new antigens he discovered a group of new substances which he called 'haptens'. He noticed that haptens could combine with antibodies but alone they could not stimulate an immune response (Goldman, Schmalstieg).\n\nThe birth of fluorescent immunoassays\n\nLandsteiner realised that haptens provided a powerful means to label proteins, a technique that he began to try out when he moved to the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York in 1919. One of those who cottoned on to his method was Florence Sabin, an American medical scientist who, in 1925, was appointed the first female head of a department at the Rockefeller Institute. Devoted to researching immune cells and the lymphatic system, in 1939 Sabin tested out labelling antigens with a dye-protein to track how protein antigens circulate in the body and how antibodies form. But the dye proved insufficiently sensitive for this purpose (Sabin; Silverstein).\n\nA new chapter opened up with the work of Albert Coons, an American physician and scientist based at Harvard Medical School. In 1940 he began looking for ways to label antibodies to make them easier to detect in his research to understand the cause of rheumatic fever, a very rare condition that can make the heart, joints, brain and skin swell up and has a significant risk of mortality. At that time many believed that rheumatic fever resulted from a hypersensitive reaction to infection by a group of bacteria called Group A Streptococcus but the idea had not been tested (Coons).\n\nCoons was encouraged to pursue his idea by the American biomedical chemist John Enders with whom he had done some laboratory work during his medical training. This was before Enders won the Nobel Prize in 1954 for helping to grow the poliovirus for a vaccine. Although not guaranteed to answer the rheumatic fever question, Enders believed that having labelled antibodies would 'provide a general procedure for locating antigens in tissues and cells' and could be utilised for 'countless problems' (Coons).\n\nIn Coons' search to label antibodies he looked to the work of John Marrack, a British chemical pathologist. In 1934 Marrack had successfully managed to attach R-salt with tetrazotized benzidine to antibodies against cholera and typhoid. His method had the advantage of being able to turn the antibodies red without altering their specificity. But when Coons repeated Marrack's method, the antibodies only showed up as faintly pink under the microscope. Without the right colour intensity Coon knew he would struggle to find small amounts of antigen in tissue (Coons).\n\nIn his hunt for an alternative labelling technique, Coons turned to Hugh Creech and Norman Jones, two chemists at Harvard. They were conjugating fluorescent compounds with proteins as part of an effort to get animals to be able to make antibodies against carcinogens, substances capable of causing cancer. Working together they managed to couple anthracene isocyanate with a pneumococcal antibody. This proved 'brilliantly fluorescent' when placed under the ultraviolet beam of a microscope (Creech; Coons). First published in 1941, their technique marked a major breakthrough as it provided a means to visualise and locate molecules in a wide range of cells or tissues preserved with chemical treatment such as formalin (Coons; Arthur). Over the following years the basic technique of linking antibodies with fluorescent labels, called immunofluorescence, continued to be refined and improved, making it a highly versatile tool for both diagnostic applications and for probing disease pathways (Silverstein).\n\nSolid-phase platform\n\nMost immunoassays in the early days were performed on glass slides or in test tubes. But over time antigens and antibodies began to be immobilised on solid surfaces, known as a solid-phase platform. One of the first ways this was done was with latex particles. Two of the key pioneers of this method were Jacques Singer, a bacteriologist, and Charles Plotz, a rheumatologist, based at Mount Sinai Hospital, New York. In 1956 they published a latex agglutination assay for the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Their work was inspired by an earlier test, described in 1948, which indicated that it was possible to diagnose rheumatoid arthritis by mixing a patient's serum with erythrocytes (red blood cells) taken from sheep previously immunised with beta hemolytic streptococci, a type of bacteria that can cause severe sore throats. Clumps formed in the mixture if the patient had rheumatoid arthritis (Plotz, Singer 1956a; Plotz, Singer 1956b).\n\nPlotz recalls that he quickly realised that the sheep cells used in the test 'were erythrocytes coated with antibody so that they could detect a possible antigen in a patient's serum. What were antibodies, I thought? They are all gamma globulin or Fraction 2. Why not try using the gamma globulin of other species to coat the sheep cells? We did, and the test worked well. Then came a crucial step. Why not try human Fraction 2, which was readily available since it was being used by the Red Cross in those pre-Salk polio-fighting days.' Eager to eliminate the need for bleeding sheep, which neither Plotz nor Singer enjoyed doing, they searched for a biological inert particle to couple with the antibody. Plotz explains, 'The most promising were collodion particles, but they were too unstable and the results could not be duplicated. At this point, American industry came to our rescue. Water-based latex paints became widely substituted for oil paints. What were latex-based paints? They were simply easily manufactured latex particles that were dyed and suspended in water.' Plotz managed to secure various sizes of latex particles from Dow Chemical Company in Michigan, which he and Singer coated with gamma globulin. One of the benefits in using latex particles as solid supports was that they could be 'custom synthesised' for any application. The simplicity of the technique enabled it to be adopted for the detection of antibodies for other diseases (Plotz 2011; Plotz 2013; Plotz, Singer 1956a; Plotz, Singer, 1956b; Molina-Bolivar, Galisteo-González).\n\nRadioimmunoassay\n\nSoon after Plotz and Singer published their paper, radioactive labels began to be explored for immunoassays. The foundation for their use was laid by Rosalyn Yalow, a biophysicist, and Solomon Berson, a physician, based at the Veterans Administration Hospital in New York. From the mid-1950s they began investigating why patients with type-2 diabetes who were able to produce insulin, a small peptide hormone, could not control their blood sugar levels (Bonolis; Science History Institute).\n\nAs part of this work, in 1956 Yalow and Berson noticed that insulin, labelled with radioiodine, remained longer in plasma taken from diabetic patients who had received long-term insulin treatment. By contrast the insulin cleared rapidly in people who were not diabetic and diabetic patients not previously treated with insulin. At this time diabetes could only be treated with insulin from cattle and pigs. Yalow and Berson hypothesised that it took longer for such insulin to clear in diabetic patients because they had developed antibodies to the hormone, which slowed down its passage through the body. This contradicted the prevailing belief that insulin was too small a protein to trigger an immune response and produce antibodies (Yalow).\n\nIn order to prove that the protein bound to insulin in blood was an antibody, Yalow and Berson tried out various methods. One of the challenges they faced was that insulin usually exists in very low concentrations within the body which made it difficult to detect in blood. The most effective method proved to be an 'radioimmunoassay', a new technique they developed. Commonly shortened to RIA, their method, first published in 1960, takes advantage of the fact that when two antigens have affinity for the same antibody the one with the highest concentration will displace the other in binding to the antibody (Khan, Roth).\n\nYalow and Berson performed their test by first mixing known amounts of radioisotope-tagged insulin (antigen) and antibodies to form an antigen-antibody complex. They then added a small amount of blood from a patient and incubated the mixture to give both the labelled and unlabelled insulin time to bind with the complex. Following incubation, the radioactively labelled antigens that had not bound with the complex were removed and then a radiation counter was used to measure the bound, labelled antigens. Armed with RIA, they were able to measure the maximum insulin-binding capacity of an antibody in plasma (Yalow, Berson).\n\nRIA marked a major turning-point because it made it possible to measure tiny amounts of nearly every hormone and many other biologically interesting substances in a variety of body fluids, including blood, urine and saliva, as well as bodily tissue. It had the advantage of being both highly sensitive and specific, making it possible to measure certain substances in the presence of thousands of other substances. This could be done by either radioactively labelling antigens or antibodies (Khan, Roth; Bonolis).\n\nRIA had a profound impact in clinical medicine because it provided a means to diagnose conditions caused by small changes in the quantity of hormones that could not be detected by previous methods. Able to be used for a wide variety of biological substances, RIA opened the way to new insights in many different areas including endocrinology, immunology, cardiology, gastroenterology, nephrology and neuroscience (Khan, Roth; Bonolis). Figure 10 shows how the technique gained popularity over time.\n\nThe path to enzyme immunoassays\n\nDespite its success, the RIA was a cumbersome procedure and technically demanding. In addition, radioactive labels had a limited shelf-life and were costly. They also made the immunoassay testing process difficult to automate. But above all they raised concerns about radiation exposure for laboratory staff and their disposal as waste. Many laboratories built special facilities to contain the risk to protect staff, but fears persisted (Lequin, 2005).\n\nThe potential health threat posed by radiation encouraged other researchers to look for safer labels. Among those explored was ferritin, a protein that stores iron inside the cells of the body. In 1959, Seymour Jonathan Singer, a physical chemist at Yale University reported that attaching ferritin to antibodies provided a useful tool for studies of cells and tissue sections under the electron microscope (Singer). He believed it had the potential to improve histopathology, a discipline that looks at cells and tissues for signs of disease.\n\nBetween 1966 and 1969 attempts were also made to conjugate antibodies with various enzymes but the results were variable. Preliminary experiments nonetheless indicated it was feasible to link antibodies with an enzyme. This challenged the perception that such a method would not work. Many assumed an enzyme was too large and bulky a molecule to conjugate with an antibody and would hinder the antibody-antigen interaction (Lequin, 2005; Nakane, Pierce 1966; Nakane, Pierce 1967).\n\nIn the end the most effective enzyme label proved to be horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Horseradish root tissue had been observed to have a brilliant blue colouring effect as early as 1810 by Louis Antoine Planche, a French pharmacist. But for many years the enzyme was only available in crude extracts which hindered its adoption. Relatively pure forms of the enzyme finally became commercially available in the late 1950s which opened up the possibility for it to be explored for multiple applications, including histopathology and cytochemistry, the science of studying cells after staining their constituents (Odendaal; Nakane, Pierce 1966; Nakane, Pierce 1967).\n\nSome of the first attempts to link HRP with an antibody were made by the Japanese born scientist Paul Nakane and his American colleague Barry Pierce. Based in the Department of Pathology at the University of Michigan they published two articles highlighting that they had successfully located tissue antigens under light and electron microscopes by conjugating HRP with an antibody (Nakane Pierce 1966; Nakane, Pierce 1967). They were not the only ones active in this space. So too was the Greek born scientist Stratis Avrameas and his colleagues at the Pasteur Institute in Villejuif, France, who also published a method for using the enzyme (Avrameas, Uriel). The two groups noticed a brown precipitate formed at the site of the HRP-labelled antibody when coupled with diaminobenzidine and hydrogen peroxide. This precipitate could be seen easily with an ordinary light microscope (Vector).\n\nAnother person working in the same area was Charles Nicholas Hales, a clinical biochemist based at the University of Cambridge with a strong interest in diabetes. His investigation of diabetes was in part prompted by the death of his paternal grandfather due to the disease. Both his mother and younger sister also had diabetes. Hales looked to improve the RIA method as part of his PhD. His goal was to make it simpler and faster to perform as well as more sensitive and specific. Hales published his first paper on this work in 1963 together with Philip Randle, his supervisor (Siddle, Luzio, O'Rahilly).\n\nWhat was novel about Hales' technique was it enabled the antibody-insulin complex to be rapidly recovered by filtration. It also required only one tenth as much radioactivity as Yalow and Berson's method and took only one day to complete. Hales realised early on that the new immunoprecipitation procedure he created to separate antibody-bound and free fractions was amenable to automation. Believing this would make it more attractive to use in the clinic, Hales tried to build a machine to perform online filtration assays. But he was hampered by the lack of proper equipment in the Biochemistry Department. As a result he and Randle approached the Radiochemical Centre, set up in 1949 in Amersham on the outskirts of London, to produce radioisotopes for medical and industrial purposes. In collaboration with the Wellcome Foundation (as it then was) the Radiochemical Centre managed to produce the world's first commercial radioimmunoassay kit. Launched in 1968, the kit helped to stimulate research into diabetes and development of a highly lucrative immunoassay industry (Hales, Randle; Siddle, Luzio, Ozanne; Clutterbuck).\n\nHales continued to work on the measurement of insulin after completing his doctorate. In 1968 he suggested that one way to make immunoassays easier and more sensitive would be to replace radioactive isotope labels with enzymes or coenzymes (Miles, Hales). His idea was quickly seized upon by other researchers and set the stage for three new enzyme-based immunoassays to be published in 1971 (Siddle, Luzio, Ozanne).\n\nThe first, called 'Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay' (ELISA), was reported by Peter Perlmann. Based at the University of Stockholm, in Sweden, Perlamnn developed the test together with his graduate student Eva Engvall. One of their motivations for developing the test, Engvall recalls, was because RIAs 'were too sophisticated for many areas of research and diagnosis because they required expensive equipment and used antigens and antibodies labelled with radioactive isotopes with short half-lives. We wanted something simpler with the same sensitivity.' Having such a test they believed would be useful for both immunochemistry and diagnostic tests that check for specific antibodies in blood, known as serologic assays (Engvall).\n\nTo try out their idea, Engvall and Perlmann set out to develop a test to measure rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG). This is one of the most common forms of antibody. It helps to protect the body by 'remembering' previously encountered pathogens. Engvall and Perlmann used the rabbit IgG as an antigen in their assay. The rabbit IgG was immobilised on a plate and then a labelled sheep antibody (sheep anti-rabbit IgG) was then used to detect the immobilised antigen. Engvall indicates the labelled antigen was designed to compete with unlabelled antigens in a sample 'for binding to antibodies covalently coupled to cellulose particles.' Repeated centrifugation and washing was used to separate antibody-bound antigens from free antigens. Initially Engvall and Perlmann's paper was rejected because it 'contained nothing new'. But their method quickly caught on once published (Engvall).\n\nWhile Engvall and Perlmann were developing their ELISA, Anton Schuurs and Bauke van Weemen were devising a similar test they called an 'Enzyme Immunoassay' (EIA). Based at the Research Laboratories at NV Organon, a Dutch company specialising in reproductive health, Schuurs and van Weeman were looking for a way to detect pregnancy in urine samples. For the test they conjugated HRP with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a hormone secreted by the placenta that was first discovered in 1925. Their method made it possible to detect small quantities of the hormone 6-8 days after the fertilised egg gets implanted into the uterus (Schuurs van Weemen; van Weemen Schuurs; Lequin, 2005).\n\nA third enzyme immunological technique was published in 1971 for measuring cellular immunoglobulins by Avrameas and Brigitte Guilbert at the Pasteur Institute. Their method used an antibody labelled with HRP. Unlike the two other methods, it gained less attention. In part this was because it was primarily used by histologists and cytologists, whereas the other two were used for diagnosis by clinical chemists (Avrameas, Guilbert; Avrameas; Lequin 2006).\n\nOther researchers subsequently adapted the ELISA methods. This included the development of the 'competitive ELISA' in 1976 by Donald Yorde and his colleagues at the Medical College of Wisconsin to measure HCG (Yarde, Sassa, Wang). Also known as ab 'inhibition ELISA', this test is used to measure antigens. Another one was the 'sandwich' ELISA method, first published in 1977 by Kanefusa Kato and his colleagues based in the department of biochemistry at Tokushima University, Japan (Kato, Hamaguchi, Okawa). Figures 16 and 17 illustrate the different steps in the two tests.\n\nWhere ELISA tests proved particularly helpful was for evaluating whether a patient has an autoimmune disease. In this situation patients develop abnormal immune responses to their own cells, tissue and proteins. Capable of striking nearly every organ and system of the body, autoimmune disorders have highly variable symptoms, ranging from mild to severely debilitating. Some of the best known examples of autoimmune disorders are type-1 diabetes, Graves' disease, Coeliac's disease, inflammatory bowel diseases (Crohn's and ulcerative colitis), rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and multiple sclerosis. Because autoimmune diseases share many similar symptoms with each other and other diseases, diagnosis can be difficult.\n\nOne of the key markers of autoimmune diseases are autoantibodies. Such antibodies do not directly attack cells and tissue but are linked to the overall immune response that can cause inflammation and damage. Some autoantibodies can be detected many years before the onset of clinical symptoms, as can happen in the case of lupus.\n\nIn 1978 one of the first ELISA tests was published to detect autoantibodies. It was designed to find autoantibodies to human serum albumin thought to be linked to liver disease (Lindström, Wagner). Since then ELISA tests have become an indispensable clinical tool in the diagnosis and management of autoimmune disorders They can not only help identify and differentiate autoimmune illnesses, but also to monitor their progression and the efficacy of treatment. Some idea of the importance of ELISA for the detection of autoantibodies can be gauged from figure 18 which provides the results from a search for articles listed on PubMed that had these two words in their title between 1977 and 2020.\n\nMonoclonal antibodies and microplates open up new chapter for immunoassay diagnostics\n\nThe development of enzyme immunoassays became much easier following a breakthrough made in the United Kingdom by César Milstein and Georges Köhler at the Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. In 1975 they published a new technique, called 'hybridoma technology', which made it possible to produce endless quantities of antibodies in the laboratory for the first time. Prior to their invention the only way to source antibodies was from serum collected from immunised animals or human serum, as in the case of blood grouping sera. But this had major downsides. Firstly, it is difficult to stimulate animals to produce antibodies to a specific target and supply is limited to the lifetime of the animal. Secondly, immunised serum contains many different antibodies each differing in affinity and specificity. This made antibodies expensive to produce and difficult to standardise. Known as monoclonal antibodies, or mabs, the antibodies produced by Milstein and Köhler had the advantage that they could be mass produced to a specific target, were cheap and could be standardised (Marks 2013).\n\nBy the time mabs arrived, researchers had begun to use microplates for ELISA tests. Such plates contain multiple wells arranged in a rectangular matrix, each of which are labelled with a number. The first microplate was created in 1951 by Gyula Takátsy, a Hungarian physician and microbiologist, to rapidly identify the influenza virus in blood samples during a serious influenza epidemic. At the time the standard method was too slow and unreliable as well as time-consuming. Part of the challenge was that it required many reagents and dilutions. Takátsy pioneered a side-by-side arrangement of wire metering loops. Made out of platinum, and shaped like a tulip, these loops replaced the need for pipettes. In addition, he created plastic plates with multiple wells arranged in a grid, which he hand-machined. This made it easier for him to use the loops to mix and transfer a set amount of liquid from one well to another. Over time Takátsy refined his method which made it possible to work simultaneously with six-to-eight loops in one hand. Now able to drop a defined volume of liquid in multiple wells all in one-go, his method significantly increased the throughput of samples in his laboratory (Astle; Banks; Mishra; Jaquith). Takátsy's work laid the foundation for the 96-well microplate, first marketed in 1965.\n\nOne of the earliest adopters of the microplate for the ELISA method was Alister Voller, an immunologist who completed his PhD at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and had a long-standing interest in malaria and other infectious diseases. From the mid-1960s he began developing fluorescent antibody techniques for the detection of malaria (Voller 1964; Voller 1974). In 1971 he and his colleague, Paul O'Neill, published an immunofluorescence method that enabled multiple tests to be carried out in one-go for the detection of antibodies to malaria in blood on a large-scale (Voller, O'Neill).\n\nIt did not take long before Voller turned his attention to ELISA. He did this with Dennis Bidwell, a virologist, who came to work with him in 1970 at the WHO Collaborating Laboratory based at the Nuffield Institute of Comparative Medicine in London. For them ELISA offered a means to overcome the drawbacks of immunofluorescence and RIA. As they explained, 'Immunofluorescence is tedious, time consuming, and not easily automated so it can be used for only small batches of tests. In contrast, RIA is particularly suitable for large-scale operations but the short shelf-life of the reagents, the rather sophisticated expensive equipment, and the strict regulatory controls on the use of isotopes have tended to exclude RIA from many small laboratories' (Voller, Bartlett, Bidwell).\n\nTesting for infectious diseases\n\nVoller and Bidwell believed the ELISA offered an ideal method for the rapid detection of parasitical and virological infections in remote areas where laboratories had only very basic equipment (Bidwell, Bartlett, Voller). One of their key contributions was to incorporate the microplate into the ELISA which they started to explore in 1974 (Manns). In 1975 they published two ELISA methods using a microplate. The first was for the detection of Chagas' disease, a condition caused by trypanosoma, a parasite, that can damage the heart and the central nervous system (Voller, Draper, Bidwell, Barlett). The second was for detecting rubella (Voller Bidwell 1975). Also known as German measles, rubella is caused by a highly contagious virus. Rubella is usually a mild condition. But it can cause harm in pregnancy, such as miscarriage and serious defects in the developing foetus, including heart and neurological problems, loss of hearing and eyesight, brain damage and liver or spleen damage (Craddock-Watson).\n\nEncouraged by their progress, in 1976 Voller and Bidwell argued that in due course enzyme immunoassays, especially ELISA, could be used for a wide range of applications and become routine laboratory tests. They went as far as to suggest they could one day 'replace other serological tests, such as complement-fixation, haemagglutination, and immunofluorescence' (Voller, Bidwell, Bartlett, 1976; Voller, Bidwell 1980).\n\nWhere enzyme immunoassays made their first significant mark was in blood banking. They were quickly adopted for detecting the hepatitis B virus which is highly infectious and a leading cause of death worldwide. A third of the world's population get infected with the virus at some point in their lives, with 5% going on to be chronic carriers. What is particularly challenging about the virus is that many of its carriers do not initially experience any symptoms so are unaware they are infected. The development of the first enzyme immunoassays for the disease was aided by the discovery, by Baruch Blumberg, in 1968 that the hepatitis B virus carried a specific antigen on its surface. It was called the 'hepatitis B surface antigen' (HBsAg) (Marks 2018). From the early 1970s blood banks began screening for the antigen using either (semi) automated RIA or more cumbersome hemagglutination tests which look for the clumping together of red blood cells by viral particles.\n\nThe first practical microplate enzyme immunoassay for the detection of HBsAG was devised in 1976 by Schuurs and his colleagues at Organon Teknika. They created it by coating a microplate with antibodies taken from sheep previously immunised against HBsAG and a sheep antibody against the same antigen that was labelled with HRP. Its results compared 'very favourably with that of RIA' (Wolters, Kuijpers, Kacaki). Proving highly reliable, it became the first commercialised enzyme immunoassay (Hepanostika) (Lequin, 2006).\n\nIt did not take long before other enzyme immunoassay tests emerged. A search of PubMed for the words 'enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay' and 'enzyme immunoassay' shows the number of articles that began to appear on this topic from the late 1970s. Such articles increased steadily throughout the 1980s and 1990s. But they began to decline following the introduction of other diagnostics, such as real-time PCR which began to be used in 1995. The use of real-time PCR increased dramatically from 2000, in part because it offered greater sensitivity and higher throughput (Figure 24) (Deepak, Kottapalli, Rakwal).\n\nOne of the most important tests developed early on was for the detection of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). The virus weakens the immune system by targeting the body's white blood cells, a condition called Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS). First noticed in May 1981, it took until 1984 to work out that AIDS was caused by a new virus, HIV, and that it was spread through sexual intercourse and blood. By this point the disease had reached epidemic proportions raising major public health concerns around the world and demands for an effective diagnostic.\n\nAmong those involved in the development of the first HIV ELISA test were Scott Weber, Robin Gutierrez, George Dawson and John Heller at Abbott Laboratories, an American company based in Illinois specialising in medical devices. Working round the clock they managed to devise an ELISA test within nine months. Gutierrez remembers, 'We would work evenings or come in on the weekends, often dining out of the vending machines, in order to maintain progress on this project. Working on this test was truly one of those \"once in a lifetime\" opportunities that I'll never forget.' Their aim was to provide a reliable test to screen blood. This was urgently needed to stem the panic generated by AIDS. News of AIDS made many people reluctant to donate and receive blood and even undergo necessary surgery because of the risk of getting infected (Barik, Mohany, Bisht).\n\nApproved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March 1985, Abbott's test was the first ELISA developed for HIV. It was immediately adopted by the American Red Cross and rolled out by other blood organisations around the world for screening blood (Abbott 2019). Following this, several companies developed a variety of automated and manual ELISA methods for the detection of HIV (Barik, Mohany, Bisht).\n\nPregnancy - the stepping stone to self-testing immunoassay diagnostics\n\nThe same year Abbott gained approval for its HIV screening test, a new rapid over-the- counter (OTC) pregnancy test was launched. Marketed under the brand name 'Clearblue', this device not only made the process of pregnancy testing much easier and faster but also provided a template for the development of other self-testing diagnostics using immunoassays. For most of the 20th century pregnancy testing had remained the preserve of the medical profession and the laboratory. Part of the challenge was the tests had to be conducted in animals by specialists in a laboratory which could take days to provide a result. Click here for more information.\n\nOne of the first immunoassay techniques for detecting pregnancy was pioneered by Leif Wide when he was still a medical student at Uppsala University, in Sweden. Encouraged by Carl Gemzell, a gynaecologist and obstetrician based at Karolinska Hospital, Wide first began working on the development of a test for the detection of human growth hormone (hGH) in blood in 1959. His starting point was an agglutination inhibition technique published in 1951 by Stephen Boyden at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research. Proving unreliable for the detection of hGH, Wide instead looked to see if it could measure hCG in urine. To do this, he immunised two rabbits with hCG and then created hCG-coated particles with the help of sheep red blood treated with formalin and tannic acid. The new test proved effective at determining which women were pregnant on Gemzell's ward (Wide; Mishell, Wide, Gemzell).\n\nExcited about the test's potential to replace the need to use animals for diagnosing pregnancy, Wide turned his attention to developing reagents that could be commercialised. He did this by freeze-drying hCG-coated particles and antiserum, which he then freeze-dried together in an ampoule. This was a major breakthrough. As he later commented, 'The pregnancy test was now so simple that only urine and buffer had to be added to the ampoule. The ampoules were sealed and could be stored for future use and seemed suitable as \"test kits\" for a doctor's office or a pharmacy' (Wide).\n\nBy May 1960, Wide recalls, 'I felt that we were ready to approach a possible manufacturer of the reagents for the pregnancy test. The method was remarkably reliable. None of the tests on over 300 morning urine samples provided incorrect results. The hCG-coated particles could be made in batches for 20,000 reactions and they were stable for months. The antiserum from one of the rabbits could be used for over one million reactions. The results from quantitative determinations of hCG in urine of 110 women in early pregnancy indicated that such determinations would be of clinical value.' The test provided a positive test 21-23 days after the estimated day of ovulation and had an accuracy of 98.9 percent on 2,230 urine samples. By January 1961 the University Hospital in Uppsala was routinely using the test and several other hospitals in Sweden soon also adopted it (Wide, Gemzell).\n\nHaving received research funds from NV Organon in the Netherlands, Gemzell wrote to Mauris Tausk, the company's managing director about the feasibility of commercialising Wide's test. Tausk highlighted the test 'takes only one to two hours, gives a quantitative answer and can be performed in every laboratory or even in a doctor's office. It is also very inexpensive.' Organon took out a patent on the test and launched it as 'Pregnosticon' in the spring of 1962 for use in doctors' surgeries. Its introduction opened the way for pregnancy tests to be done more regularly in doctor's offices (Wide; Leavitt).\n\nFive years after launching Pregnosticon for use by doctors, Margaret Crane, a 26-year-old New York graphic designer, wondered if it could be adapted for use by women themselves. Hired to design packages for lipsticks and ointments for Organanon, in West Orange, New Jersey, Crane first had the brain wave after seeing hundreds of test tubes suspended over a mirrored surface in the company's laboratory. On learning they were used as pregnancy tests, Crane says she immediately thought 'It's so simple, just a test tube and a mirrored surface. A woman could do that herself... It just came to me just like that.' Critically she saw that it would provide a means to empower women. As she argued, if women had the tools to test themselves they would no longer need to rely on doctors and wait weeks for the result. Crane's thinking resonated with the nascent American women's health movement's campaign to give women greater control over their bodies and reproduction (Caitlin; Nwofor; Leavitt; Robinson).\n\nBut Crane's colleagues were not enthusiastic about her idea. As she recalls, 'The company was worried it would lose its lab business to doctors if everybody tested themselves at home.' It was also concerned that women would not know how to follow the instructions and be too emotional to know what to do. Despite this Crane persisted. Not a scientist herself, Crane used her graphic design skills to develop a prototype for the home pregnancy test. This gained the attention of the Organon executives in the Netherlands who patented it (Caitlin; Nwofor).\n\nWhile revolutionary in helping women to test for pregnancy within the privacy of their homes, the new kits were far from perfect. Importantly they had relatively poor sensitivity because they relied on a relatively crude antibody which could not differentiate between hCG and luteinizing hormone (LH), another human gonadotropin that shares many of its biological characteristics. Unlike hCG, which is closely tied to pregnancy, LH helps to regulate ovulation. In addition, the crude antibody could only detect hCG once it had reached a sufficiently high level which only occurs in advanced pregnancy. This rendered the pregnancy home tests useless for the detection of early pregnancy (NIH; Braunstein).\n\nReliance on the crude antibody was eventually overturned in the 1970s as a result of the work of Judith Vaitukaitis. Joining the National Health Institute in 1970, Vaitukaitis never set out to improve the pregnancy test. Instead, she wanted to to be able to diagnose choriocarcinoma, a very rare type of cancer that can form in the womb during pregnancy that secretes hCG. This required a more sensitive antibody for hCG. With relatively little was known about the hormone this was a major challenge. But Vaitukaitis and her team soon discovered that the biological activity of hCG resided specifically in its beta-subunit. Armed with this information, they sought to create an antibody specific to the beta-subunit of hCG. They did so by immunising rabbits with hCG purified from urine collected from a local retirement home for nuns (NIH; Braunstein).\n\nThe new antibody had the benefit that it did not cross-react with LH and could detect hCG in peripheral blood as early as 7.5 days after fertilisation (Braunstein). Based on this, Vaitukaitis and her colleagues recognised that the new antibody not only provided a tool to diagnose cancer but could also detect early pregnancy and complications like ectopic pregnancy. Just before publishing their method in 1972 (Vaitukaitis, Braunstein, Ross; NIH; Romero), the group explored the possibility of patenting it. But NIH lawyers refused on the grounds that the work was supported by public funds so felt it belonged in the public domain (NIH).\n\nThe first pregnancy test to take advantage of the NIH breakthrough was developed by Warner-Chilcott, an American company. Called E.P.T (for early pregnancy test) it could be performed nine days or longer after a missed period. Launched on the American market in 1978 with the approval of the FDA, the test could be bought in shops for use at home. Warner-Chilcott's test was far more accurate and easier to use than previous tests. But it was not optimal for the end user. It required nine different steps and took two hours to produce a result (Brody; Wilson).\n\nSelf-testing for pregnancy at home became much simpler with Clearblue, a new test developed by Unipath. Set up in the United Kingdom in 1984, Unipath was a spin out from Unilever, an Anglo-Dutch company. It emerged on the back of a collaboration established in 1978 between the University of Birmingham and an immunology laboratory set up in 1971 by Unilever in Colworth, Bedfordshire. The core mission of this partnership was to leverage mabs to develop medical immunodiagnostics. This work was led by Philip Porter who had completed a PhD in immunochemistry at Liverpool University (Jones, Kraft).\n\nThe collaborators developed a simple kit using the mab technology. It included a mab fixed to a nylon support and a mab tagged with an enzyme that changed colour according to how much antigen was absorbed. The kit had the attraction that it could be easily modified for a range of different diagnostic tests (Allen). Porter and his colleagues filed a patent (GB 8020160) for the method in the UK in June 1980 (Davis, Porter).\n\nUnipath rapidly adapted the kit for detecting pregnancy as its flagship product. For the company, such a test provided a way to break into the competitive diagnostic market which at this stage was still dominated by a few large companies. With most of these companies focused on providing tests to large hospitals and clinics, Unipath saw an opening in providing OTC diagnostic products directly to consumers which remained largely untapped. Testing for pregnancy offered an ideal means to do this.\n\nFrom the start, Unipath's guiding principle for its pregnancy test was maximum 'simplicity, sensitivity, speed and specificity'. It also ran focus groups to gauge women's preferences. In particular women highlighted their dislike of handling urine. So Unipath designed a hygienic and non-invasive 'bucket' collection system for the urine. Released on to the British market as Clearblue in June 1985, Unipath's test took just 18 months to develop. Deliberately packaged and marketed to appeal to the 'modern independent woman in control of her life', Clearblue rapidly caught on. Within just three months it captured 30 percent of the British market. Part of its success was because it was less messy, more reliable and more sensitive than competitors (Jones, Kraft; Olszynko-Gryn June 2017; Olszynko-Gryn Sept 2017).\n\nThree years later Unipath introduced its 'One-step Clearblue' test which was much faster and simpler in design. Critically it did not require the 'wash and wait' stages of previous kits by incorporating a 'porous nitrocellulose membrane built into a \"one-pot\" system'. Women just needed to urinate onto a test strip at one end of the test and they could read the result at the other end after three minutes. This was achieved with the help of a dipstick impregnated with two mabs and a colour-creating enzyme to detect hCG in the urine. The device included a 'control feature giving added reassurance: two blue lines being positive for pregnancy, one blue line indicating a negative result'. Not only was the test easier and faster to use. It could also be used on the first day of a missed period and no longer had to be used first thing in the morning (Jones, Kraft).\n\nCommonly known as the 'dip and read test', the concept of the dipstick was not new. It grew out of a urine test strip introduced in 1956 for monitoring the level of glucose in the urine of diabetic patients. Called 'Clinstix', the test was developed by the husband and wife team, Albert and Helen Free, two biochemists based at Miles Laboratory, a company based in Elkhart, Indiana. Originally their test involved dipping filter paper into reagent solutions which was then dried in an oven. They subsequently found a way to 'combine reagents for two or more tests on one strip' by creating a 'water-impervious barrier' to prevent the two reagents from running together on the paper. This underpinned the release of Uristix in 1957, 'a dip-and-read test' for detecting glucose and protein in urine and was thereafter modified for the detection of other substances (American Chemical Society).\n\nThe dipstick takes advantage of how liquid moves across paper, a process called lateral flow. Since its first development, the lateral flow test (LFT) has gone through multiple changes, but it retains the same basic format. To start with a sample, which contains the analyte of interest, is placed at one end of the test. It then flows through a series of pads with the capacity to transport fluid, such as urine, blood and urine. Each pad serves a different purpose. Once soaked into the first pad, the sample flows into another zone that contains reactive molecules designed to conjugate with the target molecule in the sample. In the case of a pregnancy test, at this point hCG (the antigen) gets marked by a specific mab tagged with an enzyme designed to trigger a reaction further along the test strip. It then moves into another zone that contains immobilised mabs that bind to hCG. At this point the enzyme linked to the mobile mabs can activate dye molecules, embedded in the test strip, to change colour. The colour only changes when hCG is present in the urine sample (Brunning).\n\nClearblue proved highly profitable, generating an annual trading profit of £8 million in the UK by 1988 (Jones, Kraft). In 1989 the Clearblue One Step won the British Design Award in Medical Equipment (Olszynko-Gryn Sept 2017). Unilever went on to launch several OTC dipstick fertility tests. This included Clearplan, released in 1989, which tested for LH to identify the onset of ovulation for getting pregnant. Unipath continued to refine its technology over the coming decades. This included the incoporation of a hand-held computerised LED monitor in 1996 to make it easier for women to read the result (Jones, Kraft).\n\nMoving infectious disease testing beyond the healthcare setting\n\nIn 2001 Unilever sold Unipath to the US-based Inverness Medical Innovations Group (now Alere) (O'Caoimh Van Zeller Veira). By now LFTs had become a routine diagnostic platform, helped by the fact that they were affordable, easy to handle, user-friendly and could provide results within minutes. In addition to enabling individual health monitoring at home, called self-testing, LFTs proved useful to point of care diagnostics (POC), also called near-patient testing or bedside testing. POC testing is now carried out in many different locations, for example in a GP surgery, A&E, or out in the community. One of the key advantages of LFTs is they do not require trained laboratory technicians and clinicians. This means they can be performed by many different people including paramedics, nurses, doctors and other professionals. The ability to conduct rapid tests near the patient is key to better disease diagnosis, treatment monitoring and management.\n\nWhere LFTs have proven particularly powerful has been in the diagnosis of infectious diseases. Detecting such diseases quickly is vital to limiting their spread and protecting public health. The use of LFTs for this purpose is helped by the fact that they are simple to use, disposable and do not require expensive equipment or highly skilled technicians. This is particularly important in resource-limited countries which tend to be most affected by infectious disease.\n\nFrom the 1990s a number of LFTs were developed to diagnose infectious diseases. This included tests for malaria, HIV, Strep A (group A Streptococcus) and influenza A/B. Many of these were developed for use in primary healthcare settings and clinics and pharmacies. But a select number was also developed for self-testing at home.\n\nThe way in which LFTs helped shift testing for an infectious disease at home is illustrated by the case of HIV. The concept of self-testing for HIV at home was first put forward by Elliott Millenson, an entrepreneur, to the FDA as early as 1986. But the regulator initially rejected the idea. This was due to the assumption that face-to-face counselling was needed from a healthcare worker before and after every HIV test to make sure patients who tested positive received the right support to prevent suicide. The FDA subsequently reappraised its position once more HIV treatments became available. In 1996 it approved two OTC kits for HIV, one developed by Millenson. Users still had to send their blood to a laboratory, following which they could obtain their results a week later by calling a free telephone number that also provided counselling (Wright, Katz).\n\nThe FDA approval was a major turning point. In the United States it opened up anonymous HIV testing nationwide, even in states where it was illegal. This was crucial given how much discrimination still surrounded HIV. Ten years later the FDA went even further when it approved the first rapid HIV antibody test. This test had the advantage that it could be performed on oral fluid collected from inside the mouth. In addition, the user could read the result themselves. This took between 20 and 40 minutes to appear directly on the test (Wright, Katz; Fischer, Abrahams, Shankland; McMillen).\n\nJust how valuable the HIV self-test proved can be judged by the fact that in 2016 the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended it be made as widely available as possible. It did so on the grounds that such testing was 'a safe, accurate and effective way to reach people who may not test otherwise' (WHO, 2016; WHO, 2019). WHO's decision was based on evidence collected from a large-scale community-based cluster randomised trial conducted between 2011 and 2014 in urban Malawi. Led by the epidemiologist Liz Corbett and colleagues at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), the trial looked at the impact of distributing self-testing kits through health workers combined with optimal home-based HIV care. They found that it helped increase the uptake of antiretroviral therapy for HIV (MacPherson, Latloo, Webb; LSHTM).\n\nLSHTM researchers later on did a large-scale evaluation of HIV self-testing across Africa. Called HIV Self-Testing Africa (STAR), the study was conducted by multiple partners. The work was supported by Unitaid which provided funding for 4.8 million HIV self-test kits to be distributed across Malawi, Zambia, South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland by 2020. The first phase of the study ran between 2015 and 2017 in Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Data collected from this was then used to roll out HIV self-testing in sub-Saharan Africa and expand implementation in Eswatini, Lesotho and South Africa. Overall, the programme helped to increase uptake of the tests from negligible volumes in 2015 to 5.5 million in 2018 (LSHTM).\n\nTaking LFTs to the next level - COVID-19 mass testing\n\nThe ability to self-test with a LFT gained even greater prominence with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. This was triggered by the arrival of a new virus called 'severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2' (SARS-CoV-2). First reported in the city of Wuhan, China, in December 2019, the virus spread rapidly across the world leading the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020. It did not take long before WHO declared, on 11 March 2020, there to be a global pandemic.\n\nIn April 2020 a global collaboration, known as the Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, was launched to help fast-track research and development to help end the pandemic. One of its missions was to develop affordable and accurate rapid diagnostics to support countries and areas in greatest need, especially low-income and lower middle-income countries. With no effective vaccine or treatment yet on the horizon, such tests were regarded as crucial to pandemic surveillance and response (WHO April 2022).\n\nAt the start of the pandemic most COVID-19 cases were diagnosed with reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The technique has the advantage that it can detect the genetic material of any pathogen, including a virus, even in small quantities. This meant it could determine the presence of SARS-CoV-2 within a day of a person getting infected. Another benefit was that the RT-PCR was a well-tested diagnostic platform for other infectious diseases, including previous coronavirus infections. It was also relatively straightforward to adapt. All that was needed was to know the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2, which was first released into the public domain on 12 January 2020. In the case of COVID-19, the RT-PCR was designed to detect RNA, which is the key genetic component of SARS-CoV-2 (Datta, Naiyer, Mansuri).\n\nWhile highly sensitive and accurate, the RT-PCR test is a complex and multi-step process that can only be run in a well-resourced centralised laboratory with trained staff. In many countries where the healthcare infrastructure was weak and laboratory capabilities were limited it was not possible to roll out this test. Another problem is that RT-PCR turnaround can be slow, with results taking between 1 and 3 days to come through (Pavia, Plumber; Jawerth; Manning, Nehl, Farmer). This was not ideal given the need to know as soon as possible if people were infected so that appropriate precautions could be taken to prevent its transmission to others and treatment started.\n\nWhat was needed was a simple, low-cost and portable test that could be carried out in locations other than healthcare settings and provide a result within minutes. One of the best tools for this purpose was a LFT which could rapidly detect SARS-CoV-2 antigens in samples collected from the upper respiratory tract (nasal or nasopharyngeal swabs or salvia). The first rapid antigen tests received emergency authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration in May 2020. It did not take long before several other rapid antigen tests gained such approval in other countries (Pavia, Plumber; Xu, Kerr, Jiang).\n\nOne of the first companies to gain emergency authorisation for a rapid antigen test for COVID-19 was Abbott Laboratories. Abbott managed to develop the test with the help of the point-of-care expertise it gained from its acquisition of Alere, a rapid diagnostics company, in 2016. In January 2021 Abbott reported that it had supplied 150 million of its rapid antigen tests to the US Federal government for the Department of Health and Human Services to distribute around the country. These were intended for use in places like nursing homes, assisted living facilities, schools and universities. Providing results in just 15 minutes, the test was priced at $5. The company also developed a rapid test for countries outside the United States (Abbott 2021). During 2021 the company produced 1 billion COVID-19 rapid antigen tests to meet demand. This accounted for a fifth of its $43 billion in revenue that year (Abbott, Loftus).\n\nAdopted on an unprecedented scale, LFTs facilitated access to testing beyond the traditional healthcare setting and the ability to roll out mass testing on an unprecedented scale. This was helped by their simplicity, low-cost, and quick capacity to detect infection (Budd, Miller, Weckman). Reflecting just how much weight was accorded to SARS-CoV-2 antigen rapid tests, in September 2020 the WHO announced a set of agreements to make 120 million such tests available to lower middle-income countries over a six-month period. A key part of this was to achieve 'equitable access to effective and timely testing'. It argued 'Testing is a critical cornerstone of the COVID-19 response, enabling countries to trace and contain the virus now, and to prepare for the roll-out of vaccines once available. Effective testing strategies rely on a portfolio of test types that can be used in different settings and situations. While molecular tests started to be rolled out within a month of the virus being sequenced, these tests are mainly laboratory based, relying on infrastructure and trained personnel to conduct them. Rapid tests to detect the presence of the virus at the point of care, which are faster and cheaper, are a vital addition to the testing arsenal needed to contain and fight COVID-19' (WHO 2020).\n\nThe same sentiments were echoed by Michael Mina, an American epidemiologist and immunologist. In November 2020 he and his colleagues wrote: 'A point-of-care test that was inexpensive enough to use frequently would have a high sensitivity for detecting infections in time to act, without having to meet the benchmark analytic limit of detection... For an effective Covid filter that will stop this pandemic, we need tests that can enable regimens that will capture most infections while they are still infectious. These tests exist today in the form of rapid lateral-flow antigen tests... Such tests are cheap (<$5), can be produced in the tens of millions or more per week, and could be performed at home, opening the door to effective Covid filter regimens... SARS-CoV-2 is a virus that grows quickly inside the body, so by the time a benchmark PCR test becomes positive, the virus is well into exponential growth. At that point, it is probably hours, not days, before the virus grows by orders of magnitude, reaching the detection thresholds of currently available cheap and rapid point-of-care tests. It is after this point, when people would have positive results on both tests, that they would be expected to become infectious' (Mina, Parker, Larremore).\n\nSeveral countries, including the UK, China, South Korea, Austria, Luxembourg and Slovakia implemented mass testing with rapid antigen tests to help keep their economies open. The first country to do this was Slovakia. In autumn 2020 it rolled out nationwide rapid antigen testing. Coupled with the quarantining of positive cases and repeated mass antigen testing, this policy appeared to temporarily slow down the number of new infections in Slovakia (Kahanec, Lafférs, Schmidpeter).\n\nJust how pivotal LFTs were to the pandemic is highlighted by the number of LFTS distributed in England. Here the use of LFTs significantly outpaced RT-PCR testing, with 20 million tests used in less than 12 months following their introduction in January 2021. It soon also became the most widely accepted and preferred means of self-testing in Europe and the USA as well in low and middle-income regions. The test proved especially useful for screening for asymptomatic individuals in places like schools, care homes, workplaces and at mass gatherings. A survey conducted by the WHO found 'that regions implementing COVID-19 LFT self-testing perceived many benefits, including more timely diagnosis and self-isolation, increased access to testing and uptake in the population, increased testing frequency, increased adherence to public health and social distancing measures, decreased transmission, and earlier return to pre-COVID-19 activities' (Budd, Miller, Weckman). While the urgency of the pandemic has now faded, the need for COVID-19 testing is likely to continue to be important into the future for handling new variants of the virus.\n\nImmunoassays going forward\n\nSince their first development, the use of antibodies in laboratory tests for the detection of biological molecules, known as immunoassays, have been adopted for a wide range of purposes. Just how important immunoassays have become can be judged by the fact that in 2023 the global immunoassay market was estimated to be worth US$35 billion and was expected to be US$46.7 billion by 2028 (Markets and Markets). Their widespread use can in part be attributed to their simplicity and the fact that they are inexpensive, accurate, fast and can detect very low levels of molecules.\n\nWhere they have made their most significant impact has been in disease diagnostics and monitoring treatment. They are used extensively in hospitals, laboratories and research centres to diagnose various diseases. In particular they are invaluable for the detection of infectious diseases. In 2022, infectious diseases accounted for more than 31 percent of the global market share (Precedence Research). Immunoassays have played a key role in the management of many communicable diseases like HIV, tuberculosis, hepatitis B and neglected tropical diseases. The growing prevalence of emerging diseases and resistance to antibiotics means the demand for immunoassays is likely to rise even further in the future as they fill the demand for quick and cheap diagnosis.\n\nToday immunoassays are not only critical to the detection of infectious diseases, but also essential to many non-communicable diseases, also known as chronic diseases. The main type of non-communicable diseases are cardiovascular diseases (such as heart attacks and stroke), cancers, chronic respiratory diseases (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma) and diabetes. Several immunoassay techniques are now used to detect such diseases. Beyond the clinical setting, immunoassays are now routinely used for the detection of drug abuse in the workplace and in sports. They are also pivotal to biopharmaceutical research and development, including vaccines and gene and cell therapy.\n\nIn addition to their benefits to healthcare, immunoassays are essential to food production and development. Here they are used to detect dangerous contaminants or allergens. This includes looking for gluten, toxic chemicals, heavy metal contamination or pathogens like Escherichia coli. They have also proven useful for environmental monitoring, helping to test for certain pesticides and highly carcinogenic chemical compounds such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).\n\n---\n\nThis piece was written by Lara Marks in May 2024.
