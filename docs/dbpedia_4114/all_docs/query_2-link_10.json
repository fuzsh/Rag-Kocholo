        "text": "hilary d\n\nThe Amersham Fair Organ Museum 5.3.23 We came to the museum for the free open day,my friend had told me about it as she had visited before. We had a lovely time listening to the different organs on display,enjoying all the tunes of yesteryear,with a lovely cuppa and cake!\n\nInspire42158747373\n\nFound a real jewel of a place on our doorstep How could we not have known of this great place after living nearby for over 30 years! We found out via IANVISITS a web based guide to Whats On. Starting with working out why the SatNav didn't locate it to walking around the corner and seeing their signpost; traditional signposts always work when your phone fails you. Led in by the sound of organ pipes playing traditional melodies we were greeted by a cuppa and cake to spend listening to 4 hours of delightful music from these beautifully restored fair organs. We even won a prize in the raffle. Go find this time machine and be whisked back to a time when automation was first replacing musicians, perhaps the first AI. Keep restoring and preserving these wonderful pieces of automation and they will live forever to enliven future generations lives.\n\nDrStrange888\n\nAmazing The Amersham organ museum is a sight to behold it has a stunning collection of organs and friendly stewards.\n\nSallyM2013\n\nFollow the music In an unassuming building, it's easy to miss - you need to follow the sound of the music to find it. Once inside, you can buy a cup of tea and a cake, take a seat and enjoy the sounds of fairground organs from yesterday, but get there early as it can get busy. There are only limited open days.\n\nrentaquote\n\nMuseum of mystery With its limited opening hours, obscure location and lack of information about its exhibits, this is a museum of much mystery. I've been twice and discovered nothing about the collection of organs. All I can tell you is that they are beautifully crafted and make one hell of a noise! Housed in anonymous shed on an industrial estate, the museum is unknown even to many lifelong Amersham residents. On its handful of open days - typically the first Sunday of the month from November to March - members of the public are allowed in to listen to the organs. Admission is free, tea costs £1 and cake is £1.50. It's fun to marvel at the sophistication of the seven mighty music machines. But it would be far more interesting if one knew even a little of their history and how they came to be here. How hard would it be to provide an A4 sheet for each organ giving some basic information about it? The museum website is no help. For many months it has been promising that a comprehensive history of the organs will be 'coming soon'. It takes a trawl through various third party websites to discover that the Amersham museum houses the personal collection of organ enthusiast Ted Reed and has taken 50 years to assemble. Definitely worth a visit, but a bit more information would be a bonus.\n\nThisisMe\n\nWhat a gem! I heard it advertised on the local radio. They only open on occasional Sundays. It's free. It's hidden. It's unique. It's bizarre. It's fun.... we took our three children aged 7, and 5 year old twins and they were totally taken aback. The music is SO loud. You just go there, but a cuppa and cake, sit down and relax and enjoy the music. I've never seen anything like it. We were shown around by one of the fabulous volunteers and they explained how they work... oh! What a wonderful day to spend a freezing cold January Sunday afternoon.\n\nWitchazel_11\n\nFab...u...lous What a great place and novel way to spend the afternoon. Nothing to be negative about. The whole experience was wonderful and I would totally recommend it.\n\nAndy S\n\nGood cold day visit Anyone been to a steam fair in the summer. If you can remember seeing the organs, this museum houses many of the organs. In the winter, once a month it is possible to visit and hear them play. It's an amazing experience for people of any ages. The drinks and cakes were nothing special but Amersham has some great tea places, restaurants and pubs.\n\nSceptre1902\n\nAn unusual Sunday musical treat Secret gem hidden in an industrial estate, it's more a collection of working organs than a museum. On occasional Sundays the beautifully decorated machines are cranked up to belt out raucous tunes, while you can sit and listen with a cuppa and some excellent home made cake. Make sure to peek round the back and see how the music is fed into the machinery."
