Charities for the Poor, p. 101.\n\nThe former borough of Arundel, (fn. 1) dominated by its castle and 19th-century Roman Catholic church, later cathedral, lies c. 3 miles (5 km.) from Littlehampton, at the lowest point where the river Arun could be bridged.\n\nThe borough and civil parish were co-extensive in the early 19th century (fn. 2) and possibly earlier. (fn. 3) In 1881 they consisted of 1,969 a. including water. In 1902 they were enlarged on the south side by the addition of the north-east corner of Tortington (c. 85 a.), together with a strip of waste land belonging to the same parish north of Chichester Road. In 1911 and 1971 Arundel had 2,054 a. (831 ha.). (fn. 4) Most of the rest of the ancient parish of Tortington was transferred to Arundel in 1985. (fn. 5) The present article deals broadly with Arundel parish as constituted before the last named date. (fn. 6)\n\nThe parish in past centuries included arable north-west of the town, since converted to other uses, together with downland pasture in the same area; riverside meadow in the south and east; and forest and parkland, the latter afterwards converted to agriculture, on the shallower soil of the west and north-west. (fn. 7) In the east the boundary followed a meander of the river Arun, evidently to include the meadow later known as the burgess brooks. The south-eastern boundary, including other meadow called the south marshes, also follows a watercourse which, however, pace Allcroft, apparently never was the main course of the river. (fn. 8) Part of the western boundary follows a linear earthwork, possibly prehistoric, (fn. 9) which also served as the boundary of Rewell wood west of the medieval Great park. In 1605 part of that boundary was disputed between Arundel and Madehurst. (fn. 10)\n\nThe parish lies largely on chalk, overlain in the south-west by brickearth, valley gravel, and Reading Beds clay, and in the river valley and in Park bottom west of the town by alluvium. (fn. 11) North and west of the town the ground rises on the dip slope of the South Downs to between 100 and 125 metres (328 and 410 ft.), giving fine views of the coastal plain; beyond the northwestern boundary it falls sharply away to Fairmile bottom in Madehurst. Park bottom west of the town and Pughdean bottom to the north are valleys in the chalk, in each of which a stream formed a pond. Swanbourne lake in Pughdean bottom, a former mill pond, lies in South Stoke. Park bottom may once have been an inlet of the river Arun, since the town gate at the west end of Maltravers Street was known as the Watergate. In the mid 17th century, when the pond there was called the great pond, it was 17 a. in area. (fn. 12) By 1732 it had been drained, forming a close later called the Boggy meads. (fn. 13)\n\nThe river Arun seems in Roman times to have formed a wide tidal estuary, (fn. 14) its Celtic name Trisantona (i.e. Tarrant) perhaps alluding to its proneness to flooding. (fn. 15) The depth of alluvium at more than one place near the town is over 30 metres (100 ft.). (fn. 16) In the early Middle Ages there may have been more than one channel, as in the river Adur at Bramber, (fn. 17) but the often repeated, yet erroneous, statement that the present course of the river past the town was newly cut by the earl of Arundel in the mid 16th century (fn. 18) seems to derive from misconstruction of a 17th-century reference to river improvement higher up the valley. (fn. 19) The name Tarrant is recorded c. 725 and c. 1270, but the normal medieval name was apparently the river of Arundel, Arundel river, or the high stream of Arundel. (fn. 20) The modern name is recorded from 1577, (fn. 21) but the names Arundel river or great river continued to be used later. (fn. 22) In the 20th century the Arun was said to be the second fastest flowing river in the country, with a speed of up to seven knots at full flood. (fn. 23)\n\nThe area later called the burgess brooks had been inned by the late 11th or early 12th century, when the burgesses had pasture rights there. (fn. 24) Several meadow of 84 a. mentioned in 1272 (fn. 25) was presumably what later became the south marshes; the hay on 75 a. was said in 1275 to have been destroyed by floods. (fn. 26) The 100 a. of meadow belonging to the castle in 1386 (fn. 27) was evidently the same. River defences in Arundel are perhaps alluded to in the late 14th century, (fn. 28) and there are references to inning in the area in the 1540s. (fn. 29) The burgess brooks had defences against flooding in 1546 (fn. 30) and the south marshes apparently in 1570. (fn. 31) A particularly destructive flood was recorded in 1509. (fn. 32)\n\nIn the burgess brooks in the 17th and 18th centuries a river wall, i.e. bank, delimited brookland pasture from strips of land called slips or slipes outside; osiers or reeds grew on the slipes in the earlier 17th century, but by 1761 the land provided good pasture, one slipe having been mowed regularly for c. 60 years. (fn. 33) An outer bank was constructed to include the slipes, apparently by 1782 and certainly by 1799. (fn. 34) Under an Act of 1793 a towpath was made from Arundel to Littlehampton on the west side of the river. (fn. 35) Further severe floods were recorded in 1774, in 1809, (fn. 36) and later in the 19th century and early 20th, possibly exacerbated by dredging, embanking, and the elimination of meanders above the town, which increased the volume and force of water in the river. (fn. 37) The river bank was raised in 1834. (fn. 38)\n\nThe fishing of the river at Arundel was held in demesne by the lords of the rape from 1086 (fn. 39) or earlier, often being farmed. (fn. 40) The fishing of a weir (gurgite), perhaps at Swanbourne, was also mentioned in 1272; (fn. 41) in 1421 and presumably earlier the earl of Arundel's fishery extended from the sea as far upstream as Pallingham in Wisborough Green. (fn. 42) In the 17th century (fn. 43) and again in the mid 19th (fn. 44) the lords of the rape acted strenuously to preserve their rights to the river, though in 1658 there was only poor fishing since the river was full of weeds. (fn. 45) The Arundel estate still claimed the bed of the river from the sea to Pallingham in 1980, letting fishing rights to local clubs and mooring rights to individuals. (fn. 46) Pike and eel were abundant in 1817, (fn. 47) but the grey mullet caught between Arundel and the sea had a special reputation for size and flavour from the mid 17th century, being praised by Isaak Walton and Thomas Fuller, and the subject of a rhyme. (fn. 48) In the 1650s and 60s mullet were sent both to Arundel House in London and to Henry Howard's house at Albury (Surr.), and in the 18th century and early 19th to London. (fn. 49) Large quantities were netted c. 1907, but catches afterwards became rarer, (fn. 50) though they still occurred in 1991. (fn. 51) The name mullet has been used as a sobriquet for natives of the town.\n\nGENERAL HISTORY OF THE TOWN.\n\nThere are traces of prehistoric settlement, including a field system, in the west end of the parish, (fn. 52) and there was possibly a prehistoric earthwork on the site of Arundel castle. (fn. 53) A large and luxurious Roman villa, with a hypocaust, mosaic work, and much painted plaster, was built in the 1st century A.D. between the west end of Tarrant Street and the river Arun. Comparable to those at Angmering and elsewhere in Sussex, and accessible both from the river and from the Roman road between Chichester and Brighton, it may be the successor to a pre-Roman nobleman's farm. (fn. 54) No later Roman settlement in the parish is known.\n\nThere was apparently a minster church at Arundel before the Norman Conquest, suggesting an important Anglo-Saxon settlement, but the entry in Domesday Book is equivocal. (fn. 55) Possibly the earthworks north-west of the castle represent a late Saxon burh succeeding that at Burpham 1½ miles (2.4 km.) north-east, in the same way that Guildford (Surr.) replaced Eashing. (fn. 56) Their site is traversed from north to south by a presumably ancient road; it would have been a likely one for settlement, and there may already have been a small port on the river. (fn. 57)\n\nBy 1086 Arundel was a town with burgesses. (fn. 58) In the Middle Ages it was very much under the domination of the lords of the rape, both economically and in other ways, and also served as the centre of rape administration. The prosperity of the town in the later 13th century is perhaps shown by the presence of a Jewish community, which may have lived in Mill Lane, later known as Jury Lane. (fn. 59) In 1334 Arundel had the third largest assessment to subsidy of any Sussex town outside the Cinque ports. (fn. 60) Its development was retarded by two fires, in 1338 and 1344–5, the first of which was claimed to have destroyed at least half the town; (fn. 61) as a result, Arundel's assessment to the tax of 1340 was the lowest among Sussex towns outside the Cinque ports. (fn. 62) In the later Middle Ages the less regular residence of the earls of Arundel may have acted as a brake on the growth of trade. Another reason for sluggish development at that date is likely to have been the nearness of Chichester, which besides being the centre of a rape and a more important port, was also the seat of the bishop. Arundel was the scene of a rising during the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 (fn. 63) and of an abortive aristocratic plot against Richard II in 1397. (fn. 64)\n\nIn 1524 three quarters of the inhabitants owned goods valued at £2 or more; yet Arundel was then only tenth in the ranking of Sussex towns, (fn. 65) a position it roughly retained during the 17th and 18th centuries. (fn. 66) In 1586 Camden described the town as 'greater in fame than in fact'. (fn. 67) By the mid 16th century a close corporation had developed, which in the 17th and 18th centuries was the chief governing body of the town. (fn. 68) During the same period the earls of Arundel and their successors the dukes of Norfolk, partly because they only occasionally resided, and partly perhaps as a consequence of the attainder of Philip Howard, earl of Arundel, in 1589, lost much of their control over the town.\n\nIn the mid 17th century a Presbyterian party was dominant in Arundel. (fn. 69) In 1631 a clergyman, William Lewis, was violently seized and imprisoned on suspicion of drunkenness by the mayor and constable; they were later fined in absentia and excommunicated by the court of High Commission. (fn. 70) The corporation minute book in the 1640s and 50s uses the expressions 'minister' for vicar, 'Lord's day' for Sunday, and 'ungodly' behaviour, and c. 1650 the oath for new burgesses was replaced by a 'faithful promise'. (fn. 71) In 1662 the mayor and 11 burgesses, presumably the entire corporation, were dismissed from office for refusal to take the Corporation Act oath. (fn. 72) At the view of frankpledge in 1671, however, the Presbyterian faction engineered the election of several Dissenting burgesses and a Dissenting mayor, John Pellett; while the resulting lawsuit was in progress two more Nonconformist mayors were elected. (fn. 73) Two burgesses refused the oath of fidelity to William III in 1690. (fn. 74)\n\nIn the early 18th century visitors to the town described it variously as poor, paltry, and decayed. (fn. 75) From the 1720s the dukes of Norfolk began to reside there more often, leading to a gradual revival of Arundel's dependence on the castle. Duke Edward's attempt in 1735 to regain the seigneurial interest in parliamentary elections was abortive, but by the 1770s he had succeeded, (fn. 76) and in 1775 he was on good enough terms with the corporation to receive it officially. (fn. 77) From 1779 or earlier the dukes presented the corporation annually with a buck for a feast. (fn. 78)\n\nDuke Charles (d. 1815) began from the later 18th century to buy property in and around the town on a large scale; the consequent enlargement of the castle grounds, the creation of the new landscaped park north of the town, and the rebuilding of the castle itself gave physical embodiment to the re-establishment of seigneurial dominance. In 1796 the Arundel volunteers were entertained to dinner at the castle, (fn. 79) and the corporation's acceptance of a similar invitation in 1810 (fn. 80) indicates its acquiescence in the new situation. In 1814 the duke founded what was later the Church of England school, setting the pattern for many further acts of largesse by successive dukes. (fn. 81) In 1815 the newly refurbished castle was the setting for a fête held to mark the 600th anniversary of the signing of Magna Carta, and which also expressed the dukes' renewed local status. In a deliberate attempt to recreate the town's medieval splendour, carriages as they arrived were saluted by bugles from the parapet of the new castle gateway, suits of armour and weapons were hung from the internal walls as decoration, and dinner was accompanied by martial music, venison being served by two park keepers and the chief forester dressed in Lincoln green; a ball concluded the celebrations. (fn. 82)\n\nMeanwhile, the late 18th century and early 19th had seen a considerable boom in the town's trade, (fn. 83) evidenced in the grand buildings put up then; it had begun to slow down apparently by the 1830s, with the town's replacement by Littlehampton as the chief port on the river Arun. (fn. 84) Labourers from the town took part in the unrest of 1830 with the support of some better-off inhabitants who were reluctant to be enrolled as special constables. (fn. 85) In the early 1830s, during the agitation which led to the reform of municipal corporations in 1835, opposition to Arundel's close corporation was fomented by Duke Bernard Edward (d. 1842) through his steward Robert Watkins, who organized a petition on the subject. (fn. 86) After the reform Watkins, who was the object of strong personal dislike in the town, (fn. 87) attempted to influence elections to the new town council. (fn. 88) By then, however, the vast increase of the ducal estates in and around Arundel was beginning to be felt by some as a threat: the duke was thought to have designs on the burgess brooks, and to be planning to develop Littlehampton at Arundel's expense. (fn. 89) In 1851 Duke Henry Charles's attempt to close Mill Lane was successfully opposed at quarter sessions. (fn. 90)\n\nAn important aspect of the town's history in the same period was the growth of tourism. Bishop Pococke in 1754 (fn. 91) had noted Arundel's 'very pleasant' situation on the side of a hill, and another writer in 1790 praised the view from Lyminster and Burpham, with the 'noble shade of woods and hills' as a backdrop to town and castle. (fn. 92) In the late 18th century and early 19th visitors to Brighton and Bognor made summer excursions to Arundel, (fn. 93) and c. 1832 its environs were said to have many pleasant walks and rides. (fn. 94) Like other Sussex towns, it was already becoming a place of residence for retired or moneyed people; (fn. 95) sixteen 'private residents' were listed c. 1832, including five clergy, (fn. 96) and in 1851 many were said to be drawn to live there because of the fine scenery nearby. (fn. 97) One visitor in the mid 1830s who was particularly struck was the painter John Constable (d. 1837); he stayed more than once with the brewer George Constable, not a relative, finding the town and its surroundings magnificent: 'the Castle is the cheif ornament ... but all here sinks to insignificance in comparison with the woods, and hills'. (fn. 98)\n\nRelations between town and castle improved after the accession of Duke Henry in 1860, an address being presented to him on his majority in 1868 by the town council, and a firework display held in honour of his wedding in 1877. (fn. 99) The new rapprochement survived the high feelings engendered by the 'Fitzalan chapel case' of 1879–80 and the building of the new Roman Catholic church shortly before, (fn. 100) and was symbolized at the end of the century by the replacement of Mill Lane in 1894, to the town's satisfaction, with the tree-lined Mill Road, and by the duke's election in 1902 as mayor. (fn. 101) In 1897 five thousand local children were entertained in Arundel park in celebration of the Diamond Jubilee, the whole town being en fête. (fn. 102)\n\nMeanwhile, the renewed dominance of the dukes led from the mid 19th century to a bias against change. Duke Bernard Edward (d. 1842) had apparently opposed the idea of a railway in 1837, (fn. 103) the first two stations to serve the town were over a mile away, and the direct line when it arrived in the 1860s remained at a distance. As a result, the town's economy continued to be eroded. In 1847 Arundel was said to be quiet except on market and fair days, (fn. 104) and in 1874 to have changed little in the previous 25 years. (fn. 105) Writers in the early 20th century referred to its 'low pulse' and stationary trade; (fn. 106) that period saw the decline of important industries and the extinction of the town's port, market, and fairs.\n\nDuke Henry was particularly concerned to preserve the town's historic character, and medieval styles were used in the later 19th century both in the rebuilding of the castle and in new buildings on the Norfolk estate and elsewhere. (fn. 107) The growth of tourism continued. With the advent of the railway Arundel had become a goal of excursionists, for instance members of the Ancient Order of Foresters from Brighton in 1849. (fn. 108) In the later 19th century the town's ancient appearance and restful atmosphere attracted increasing numbers. (fn. 109) By then many individual visitors too were day excursionists from the lower middle classes, to judge from a contemporary guide book explicitly addressed to the 'toilers and moilers' and 'the fagged clerk, or wearied assistant'. (fn. 110) Anglers from London were said to visit Arundel in 1904. (fn. 111) By 1934 the chamber of commerce was trying to boost tourism, (fn. 112) and by 1953 there was a large car park by the river which could accommodate hundreds of cars and coaches, many other summer visitors coming from Littlehampton by boat. (fn. 113) In the 1980s there were large numbers of visitors in the town during much of the year.\n\nThe number of 'private residents' listed had risen to 46 by 1874 and 72 by 1895, but declined thereafter. (fn. 114) Unlike other Sussex towns, Arundel did not become a centre of large-scale villa settlement in the later 19th century and early 20th, because of the resistance of the Norfolk estate and the unsuitability of the ground for building. (fn. 115) After c. 1970, however, many newcomers bought houses in the town itself. (fn. 116)\n\nRoyal visits to Arundel were made by William II in 1097, (fn. 117) Henry I in 1101, (fn. 118) Stephen in 1139, (fn. 119) Henry II c. 1182, (fn. 120) Richard I perhaps in 1189, (fn. 121) and John (fn. 122) and Edward I (fn. 123) on several occasions. Letters patent of Edward II, Edward III, Richard II, and Henry VII of various dates were given at Arundel. (fn. 124) Henry VIII stayed at the castle in 1526, hunting in the park and receiving the nobility and gentry of the district; (fn. 125) he was again in Arundel in 1538. (fn. 126) Queen Victoria passed through the town twice in 1842 en route between Brighton and Portsmouth. (fn. 127) In 1846 she made a three-days' visit to the duke of Norfolk; received by the town council at the west end of Maltravers Street, where a triumphal arch was erected near the site of the medieval Watergate, she was taken from there in procession to the castle gates. (fn. 128)\n\nPopulation.\n\nFifty-six persons were assessed to the subsidy in 1296, 53 in 1327, and 34 in 1332. (fn. 129) In 1524 there were 79 taxpayers, (fn. 130) and 69 men were mustered in 1539. (fn. 131) The figure of 400 inhabitants recorded in the Compton census of 1676 seems to represent the total population of the parish, but is suspiciously round. (fn. 132) In 1724 there were 188 families, (fn. 133) and in 1767 apparently 182 heads of families. (fn. 134) The population in 1801 was 1,855; it rose quickly to 2,803 in 1831, then fluctuated between c. 2,500 and 3,000 during the rest of the 19th century. A steep drop in the 1850s was followed by a steeper rise in the 1860s, attributed to the influx of building workers on the Roman Catholic church and other buildings. The area of the parish as enlarged in 1902 had 3,059 inhabitants in 1901, 320 of whom lived in the added area. Despite an increase in that area to 464 in 1921, the population of the parish as a whole declined to 2,490 in 1931; a rise in the 1930s and 40s was followed by another fall. In 1991 the parish as further enlarged had 3,039 inhabitants. (fn. 135)\n\nTHE TOWN AS A COUNTY CENTRE.\n\nThe county court met at Arundel at least once in the early 14th century (fn. 136) and the county coroner c. 1330 was an Arundel man. (fn. 137) Richard FitzAlan, earl of Arundel (d. 1376), attempted unsuccessfully shortly before his death to subsume the county court into his Arundel honor court. (fn. 138) The county coroner sat at Arundel in the 1540s and 1550s on local cases. (fn. 139)\n\nThe county Vice-Admiralty court was held at Arundel in 1594 (fn. 140) and a Vice-Admiralty visitation in 1638. (fn. 141) In the 1640s the Sussex county committee regularly met in the inns of the town. (fn. 142) Quarter sessions were held from 1562 or earlier, most often at Epiphany. Between 1640 and 1690 sessions were held c. 10 or 12 times a decade, but thereafter until 1732 with decreasing frequency. (fn. 143) The sessions house mentioned in 1638 (fn. 144) was apparently part of the buildings of Arundel college. (fn. 145) A house of correction was ordered to be established at Arundel for the three western rapes in 1650, replacing separate ones at Chichester, Horsham, and Petworth. (fn. 146) Quakers from the town were committed there in the 1650s and 60s, (fn. 147) but there is no evidence that it functioned after that date and the building, which adjoined the churchyard, is not mentioned after 1702. (fn. 148)\n\nMILITARY EVENTS.\n\nThe castle was the object of a siege in 1102. (fn. 149) In 1322 Arundel was wealthy enough to supply two armed footmen for service against the Scots, (fn. 150) and in 1588 it was ordered to help bear the cost of a ship to fight the Spanish Armada. (fn. 151) In 1589 it was to be a port of embarkation for soldiers going to the help of Henri IV of France, (fn. 152) and in 1599 or 1600 to raise soldiers for the defence of the county; (fn. 153) 160 soldiers from the rape were ordered in 1626 to be billeted in and around the town. (fn. 154) Apparently c. 1586, (fn. 155) and certainly in 1626, (fn. 156) Arundel was one of the towns in the county appointed to be a store for arms and powder.\n\nIn December 1642 Sir William Waller, en route for Chichester, sent 100 men to capture the castle, which in the absence abroad of the earl of Arundel had been left poorly guarded. The main gate was blown in with a petard, the garrison surprised, and the castle taken. (fn. 157) Arundel remained in Parliamentary hands until December 1643, when a detachment from Lord Hopton's garrison at Petersfield under Sir Edward Ford and Col. Joseph Bampfield retook the town for the King as part of a planned three-pronged Royalist advance on London. The castle was put under siege, and three days later, after the arrival of Hopton himself, was surrendered by its garrison. (fn. 158) Fortifications were quickly thrown up to improve its defence: a double earthwork near Swanbourne lake, and the south-westwards extension to Park bottom of the northern earthwork of the Little park (the present castle cricket ground). The northern earthwork itself was perhaps strengthened as well. (fn. 159) Ford and Bampfield were then left in charge with over 200 foot and a fair number of horse. (fn. 160) Claims later made by 38 inhabitants of Arundel for loss and damage sustained during the Royalist capture of the town and castle indicate that they were hotly contested, even allowing for exaggeration: the sums concerned range from £1 to £950, making a total of £3,772. (fn. 161)\n\nOn 19 December 1643 (fn. 162) Waller returned from Farnham, camping in the Great park, and the following day after an artillery bombardment he attacked Arundel from both the north-west and south-west. After the northern earthwork of the Little park and its south-westwards extension were gained the town fell, the outer castle gate near the churchyard being also captured, and the Royalists being forced back into the castle itself. Simultaneously another party advanced down Pughdean bottom north of the town and forced the double earthwork near the mill at Swanbourne in order to reach Arundel by way of Mill Lane. (fn. 163)\n\nThere followed a 17-days' siege of the castle. Parliamentary troops are said to have been quartered in the Fitzalan chapel of the parish church, (fn. 164) and cannon were mounted on the tower of the church to fire into the castle, the defendants also being kept awake by setting off alarms. The defendants were ill supplied with provisions, either for themselves or for their stock, some oxen eventually being pushed over the curtain wall for lack of fodder. Meanwhile Waller succeeded in diverting the water supply. Numerous reinforcements arrived to swell the besieging force, while many members of the garrison deserted; an attempt by Hopton to raise the siege was unsuccessful. A sortie from the castle on Christmas day was driven back, and there were other skirmishes. On 6 January 1644 the garrison surrendered, c. 1,000 prisoners being taken, including the High Church divine William Chillingworth who had been acting as an engineer. (fn. 165) Arundel town had once again suffered during the siege; a visitor arriving there not long afterwards found it depopulated, 'all the windows broken with the great guns', and many of the shops and lower rooms of houses turned into stables by the soldiers. (fn. 166)\n\nThe castle was immediately strongly fortified by Waller, (fn. 167) a permanent garrison and magazine being installed. (fn. 168) Capt. William Morley was governor between 1645 and 1652. (fn. 169) In 1645 prisoners taken during the 'Clubmen' riots were sent to the castle for safe keeping, (fn. 170) and in 1647 the ordnance, arms, and ammunition from the dismantled garrison at Chichester was taken to Arundel, whose establishment in future was to be 100 foot besides officers. (fn. 171) In the same year the town's arrears of the county rate for poor relief and the maintenance of maimed soldiers were waived because of the financial burden caused by the presence of the garrison. (fn. 172) In 1651 the establishment was reduced to 57 besides the governor, (fn. 173) but partly because of the castle's usefulness as a prison (fn. 174) Arundel remained a garrison town until 1653, when it was disgarrisoned, 'the walls and works' of the castle were made indefensible, and the keys to the domestic part of the castle returned to 'Mr. Howard', i.e. Henry Howard, brother of the earl of Arundel. (fn. 175)\n\nSoldiers were stationed at Arundel on at least one occasion in the 18th century to combat smugglers, (fn. 176) and in 1778–9 when a French invasion was feared the castle was to be held as an advance post. (fn. 177) A corps of volunteer infantry based on the town was formed in 1794 to man guns at the coastal batteries, and was revived in 1803. (fn. 178) In the early 19th century barracks were built at Crossbush in Lyminster just east of the town. (fn. 179)\n\nGROWTH OF THE TOWN.\n\nIn 1086 there were at least 4 burgages in the town, besides 13 'haws', or urban properties attached to estates outside it. (fn. 180) The Norman town seems to have lain chiefly along the north-west to south-east route the lower part of which was followed in 1995 by High Street, climbing steeply the spur of chalk on which Arundel is built; c. 1200 it was described as the street leading to the ferry (passag'). (fn. 181) Whether or not the earthworks north-west of the castle represent a late Saxon burh, (fn. 182) there seems to have been early medieval settlement within what was later the Little park (the present castle cricket ground); (fn. 183) that may have included the place called Vinhard or Wynyerd (i.e. vineyard), in the south-west corner of which two tenements and gardens were mentioned c. 1200. (fn. 184) Buildings between the Little park and the top of the modern High Street were demolished in the early 19th century during enlargement of the castle grounds. (fn. 185)\n\nMaltravers and Tarrant streets, running westsouth-westwards roughly at right angles to High Street, were probably subsidiary streets of the Norman town. Maltravers Street was the road to Chichester, the other chief town of Roger de Montgomery's Sussex lands; its former name Old Market Street (fn. 186) is reflected in its wider central section where presumably the market was once held. Tarrant Street ran along the edge of the higher ground to give access to the river frontage. A roughly parallel street north of the church, later called Marygate Street, (fn. 187) may also have been part of the Norman town layout, since there were houses along it by c. 1200; (fn. 188) it was later to form part of the main road to London. (fn. 189) On the other side of High Street there was once a road running from the site of the George inn (nos. 30–4) under the south-east front of the castle; it was closed by the duke of Norfolk before 1785. (fn. 190)\n\nIn 1302 there were 94 burgages. (fn. 191) Most evidently lay in High and Maltravers streets, as later; Tarrant Street presumably had little early settlement, since in the 1780s only three entries in the borough rental were for property there. (fn. 192) The area enclosed by defences c. 1300, however, was considerably larger, (fn. 193) evidently comprising much open land: in the 15th century the earl of Arundel's property in the borough included numerous gardens, tofts, and other plots without buildings. (fn. 194) Very likely the west end of the town within the defences was former arable belonging to the pre-Conquest settlement, since the only arable later recorded near the town lay northwest of the Marygate. (fn. 195)\n\nMill Lane, leading north-east from the lower end of High Street round the foot of the hill on which the castle stands, may have existed by the later 13th century if its alternative name Jury Lane refers to the Jewish community then living in the town; the modern name occurs in 1379. (fn. 196) The low-lying land between Tarrant Street and the river, however, including what was later the market place at the south-east end of High Street, may not at first have been part of the built-up area. Though at the west end of Tarrant Street there was settlement in Roman times and at least one house in the later Middle Ages, (fn. 197) nearer the bridge the river may once have been wider, the waterfront, with the common quay, being extended gradually outwards, as in other medieval ports. (fn. 198) The area would probably have been liable to flooding and therefore less suited to settlement; no through road was ever constructed along it, (fn. 199) and the land by the bridge occupied by the Dominican friary is likely to have been unused before the friars arrived in the mid 13th century. (fn. 200) That may also have been the reason why the south-east corner of the town never had defences. The original market area, indeed, seems to have been in Maltravers Street rather than High Street: for much of its length High Street seems too steep for use as a market site, and its alternative name in the later 18th century was New Market Street. (fn. 201) Possibly, there fore, the open area between the foot of High Street and the bridge developed later as a new or additional market area closer to river transport.\n\nThe 38 shops or stalls recorded in 1302 (fn. 202) perhaps included some in the market place. In the early 15th century property was mentioned there or in the market quarter; the five shops and a 'shamble' lying in Middle or Mid Street (fn. 203) presumably belonged to the island of buildings between the market place and the bridge, or to the smaller island north-west of it, comprising the court house and other buildings, which was removed in the mid and later 18th century. (fn. 204) By the early 15th century there were at least two buildings on the quay. (fn. 205)\n\nIn the mid 17th century there were houses north of Maltravers Street in the King Street and Mount Pleasant area. (fn. 206) Coxes croft pond, later Panets pond, at the north end of King Street is recorded from 1679. (fn. 207) Reference was made in 1703 to the upper end of the town near the Marygate. (fn. 208) The junction of Marygate and High streets near the former gate to the castle was known as Castle green in 1636, (fn. 209) while College green mentioned in 1796 apparently lay south of the church along the line of what was later London Road. (fn. 210) The common quay in 1680 extended between the bridge and a point part of the way down the modern River Road, (fn. 211) so that there were unlikely to have been houses along the river there in the mid 17th century as depicted by Hollar. (fn. 212)\n\nIn the mid 18th century the court house which stood in the market place was demolished by the corporation, the two or three houses adjoining it being pulled down by Sir John Shelley and the duke of Norfolk in or before 1773. (fn. 213) In the 1780s (fn. 214) High and Maltravers streets still contained most of the town's buildings. High Street, which had the grander and more regular ones, was fully built up on both sides between the market place and the site of the modern castle lodge, and on the east side also north of that, opposite the college and churchyard. Much of Maltravers Street was built up by the same period, though in 1789 the street was described as a hollow way meanly built; (fn. 215) both there and in the lesser streets were many stables and other non-domestic buildings, together with much open land, especially north of Maltravers Street, used as gardens, nurseries, and orchards. At the north end of the town, besides houses in Marygate Street, there were buildings west and south-west of the church, (fn. 216) including the Parsonage farm buildings. (fn. 217) Between Tarrant Street and the river much land was then in industrial or commercial use. Much of the river frontage remained an open quay; there were some warehouses along it, which were joined in 1831 by a corn store near the bridge. Commercial and industrial premises in the area included a shipbuilding yard or yards, timber yards, and presumably the premises of the various merchants mentioned in the 1790s. (fn. 218) There were six or eight houses in Mill Lane in 1785.\n\nDuring the later 18th century and earlier 19th there was much building in the town, reflecting contemporary prosperity. Four builders were listed in the 1790s; (fn. 219) in the period 1801–31 the number of houses grew by over half, from 355 to 537, the rate of increase being especially rapid in the decade 1801–11. (fn. 220) Maltravers Street during the period established its character, adumbrated in the mid 18th century, (fn. 221) as the best residential street and the home of the town's professional men, (fn. 222) the houses on its south side enjoying fine views of the Arun valley.\n\nIn the same period Duke Charles (d. 1815) began to engross property at the north end of the town (fn. 223) in order to enlarge the grounds of the castle and reassert ducal dominance. Nineteen houses in High Street, presumably chiefly on the east side, were demolished between 1800 and 1805, (fn. 224) their gardens, which had run up to the castle ditch, (fn. 225) being later incorporated in the castle grounds. In 1803 the London road was diverted to run south of the church instead of north; (fn. 226) the old castle gate north-east of the churchyard was removed shortly afterwards and a new one built further south on the site of the modern lodge. (fn. 227) Six houses in Marygate Street, including four near the Marygate, were taken down in 1805. (fn. 228) About the same date two houses remained west of the gate and two to the east, (fn. 229) and by 1809 the duke had acquired the gate itself. (fn. 230) In 1811 he received the site of the former vicarage nearby in exchange for a new vicarage house in Parson's Hill. (fn. 231) The lands thus engrossed were enclosed by a forbidding wall of grey stone from Plymouth (fn. 232) along the new London road, though some property within the wall remained for the moment in other hands; seven tenements near the Marygate were bought by Duke Bernard Edward in 1826. (fn. 233) Until 1848, moreover, the former north section of High Street remained a right of way to the north door of the church. (fn. 234) Further houses on the east side of High Street were bought in 1850, (fn. 235) enabling the construction there in 1850–1 of another stone wall, of more picturesque design in castellated style, with a new matching lodge and gateway to the castle. (fn. 236)\n\nAt the south-east end of the town Duke Charles also bought houses and meadow in Mill Lane with the aim of increasing the castle's privacy on that side; (fn. 237) three of the houses were demolished in 1794–5. (fn. 238) An attempt to close Mill Lane in 1850, however, was abortive, and its diversion was not achieved until 1894. (fn. 239)\n\nThe houses demolished for the enlargement of the castle grounds were replaced by new streets at the north-west end of the town. Fifty houses, chiefly let out on building leases, are said to have been put up in that area c. 1810, (fn. 240) others following.\n\nBetween the mid 19th century and the early 20th High and Tarrant streets were the chief shopping streets of the town, Tarrant Street in 1910 having four general stores. Markets and fairs ceased to be held in the streets by the early 20th century. Maltravers Street, meanwhile, remained the best residential street; (fn. 241) the Parade on its north side was apparently constructed c. 1850 (fn. 242) and is first mentioned as an address in 1855. (fn. 243) New buildings erected at the time, many in medieval styles, are described below; (fn. 244) their cumulative effect was to make the town by c. 1900 appear much more medieval than it had done a century earlier. The medieval centrepiece proposed for the market place in 1893–4, however, a tall cross with a fountain on a stepped polygonal plinth, (fn. 245) was not carried out. The town by c. 1900 was also evidently more ducal and more Catholic, the skyline presenting as dominant accents from the later 19th century the enlarged castle and the huge new Roman Catholic church; around the latter was a Catholic enclave containing the various buildings mentioned below, besides a Catholic cemetery. (fn. 246) The reduced importance of the borough since its reform in 1835 was clearly expressed by the much less prominent position of the 19th-century town hall by comparison with that of the earlier court house.\n\nMany 19th-century walls survived in 1995, besides those of the castle grounds mentioned above; several are of grey Plymouth stone, for instance in the churchyard, in Parson's Hill, in Surrey Street, and in Mount Pleasant. (fn. 247) The raised pavements necessitated by the steepness of the land in several places, for instance at the lower end of King Street and notably in Maltravers Street, are also 19th-century, the latter being datable from the posts of railings along them to the years 1849–50. (fn. 248)\n\nBetween Tarrant Street and the river houses were built in the mid 19th century and early 20th for artisans, labourers, or mariners. (fn. 249) The least salubrious were the c. 15 old and dilapidated buildings, some closed at the rear, in a court east of Arun Street, which in 1885 were served by a central open drain and had only two closets between them. (fn. 250) Industry and commerce continued in the same area, with timber yards, the premises of builders, stonemasons, and barge builders, coal yards, corn merchants' and other warehouses, and the Eagle brewery, besides numerous wharves, including one owned and occupied by the duke of Norfolk at the west end of the town. (fn. 251)\n\nIn the 1930s the approach to the town from the south-east was made more open by widening the bridge and removing buildings nearby, especially the burnt-out corn store on the river front. (fn. 252) Gardens were laid out on both sides of the bridge at that period. (fn. 253)\n\nSouth of the river there seem likely to have been buildings by the early 13th century; the two messuages in the 'suburb' of Arundel with which Pynham priory in Lyminster was dealing at that date (fn. 254) were probably along the causeway, for whose upkeep the priory was responsible. More houses were built there later, (fn. 255) presumably by reclamation from adjacent marshland as at Bramber; (fn. 256) three or four are mentioned on one occasion in the early 15th century. (fn. 257) By 1785 there were 15–20. (fn. 258) During the succeeding 50 years industrial firms settled on the south bank of the river; by c. 1841 there were a brewery and maltings on opposite sides of the Brighton road, together with a timber yard, coal yards, and a soap factory to the west. (fn. 259) The unsuitability of the adjacent ground for building inhibited southwards expansion, though by c. 1875 the advent of the railway had brought a few scattered villas between the bridge and the station, which lay just beyond the Arundel—Lyminster boundary; more were built before 1910, (fn. 260) together with six 'co-operative cottages' south of Queen Street. (fn. 261) There were a few houses along the river to the south-west by c. 1841 in the part of the parish already called the south marshes: (fn. 262) by the 1870s there was one terrace, more were built by 1896, and there was further building in the early 20th century in what by the 1930s was called Fitzalan Road; (fn. 263) six council houses were put up there in 1935. (fn. 264)\n\nArundel's chief expansion in the early 20th century, however, was south of Chichester Road in what before 1902 was part of Tortington parish. Red or brown brick terrace houses, some belonging to the Norfolk estate, were built in Ford Road and Wood View by 1896 and in Kirdford Road by 1910. (fn. 265) The higher-lying land to the west around Torton Hill Road was developed by the town council from c. 1913 as an estate chiefly of large detached houses in various styles. (fn. 266)\n\nIn the mid 20th century High Street continued to be the chief shopping and business street, with smaller shops in Tarrant Street and elsewhere, Tarrant Street after c. 1980 having arcades or closes of shops occupying some former commercial or industrial premises. Maltravers Street remained largely in residential or professional use; in 1947 guest houses were apparently becoming common there, (fn. 267) but in 1988 even the biggest houses were still mostly in single domestic occupation. Tower House in London Road, on the other hand, was converted into flats in 1984. (fn. 268) The River Road area was earmarked after 1945 for light industry, (fn. 269) but by 1972 an industrial estate had opened on the south side of the river, (fn. 270) and concurrently firms in or near Tarrant Street and River Road began to close or move away. By 1990 only one factory was left there, many former industrial or commercial buildings later being converted as dwellings or replaced by new houses and flats, usually in vernacular styles. Beyond the bridge by the 1980s there were some larger shops in Queen Street. Further houses and bungalows were built after 1945, (fn. 271) some being destroyed when Fitzalan Road was cut in two by the town relief road of 1973.\n\nThe west end of the town also continued to grow in the mid 20th century. Houses for the Norfolk estate had been erected near the sawmill c. 1909, (fn. 272) and more were put up near the castle stables in the 1950s and south-west of London Road at about the same date. (fn. 273) Between Torton Hill and Chichester roads many dwellings, including some council houses, were built from the 1950s; (fn. 274) by 1991 the area south of Chichester Road had become twice as populous as the older part of the town. (fn. 275)\n\nSTREET NAMES.\n\nOf the town's streets High Street was so called c. 1216; (fn. 276) its lower portion may have been the Wide Street mentioned in the early 15th century. (fn. 277) Alternative names were High Market Street, recorded from 1658, (fn. 278) New Market Street, used in the later 18th century, (fn. 279) and possibly Market Street, mentioned in 1570 and later. (fn. 280) Maltravers Street was apparently Old Chipping (i.e. Market) Street in the early 15th century, (fn. 281) and was generally Old Market Street between the 16th and 18th centuries; (fn. 282) the modern name has not been found before the 1830s, (fn. 283) the old name being occasionally used later. (fn. 284) The junction of High Street and Maltravers Street was called Warningcamp corner by 1601, (fn. 285) either from property nearby belonging to Byworth and Warningcamp manor, (fn. 286) or from the surname of a property owner or tenant. (fn. 287)\n\nTarrant Street was so named in the early 15th century, (fn. 288) and from the mid 18th was also the lower lane. (fn. 289) Mill Lane, the old road to South Stoke, was so called in 1379; (fn. 290) its alternative name Jury Lane, recorded from 1570, (fn. 291) may allude to a medieval Jewish quarter. (fn. 292) The junction of Mill Lane and High Street was called Lasseter's corner by 1851, (fn. 293) after the watchmaker whose shop was there. (fn. 294)\n\nOther streets in the town have also had multiple names. King Street, recorded from 1636, (fn. 295) may have been the Kings Lane mentioned in 1525 and later; (fn. 296) in 1785 it was Panets Pond Lane, (fn. 297) and it may have been Punetts Lane recorded in 1574. (fn. 298) Parson's Hill, so called by the 1870s, (fn. 299) was previously Ibbetsons Lane, commemorating a property occupier of that surname; (fn. 300) it was also Farmers Lane in 1785 (fn. 301) and Parsonage Hill in 1879. (fn. 302) The street which marks the western edge of the town, formerly known as Whitings dyke, (fn. 303) was called Poorhouse Hill or Lane in the late 18th century and later; (fn. 304) by 1875 its lower part was Park Place (fn. 305) and by 1889 apparently its upper part Mount Pleasant. (fn. 306) School Lane was apparently Pottmans Ware Lane in 1636. (fn. 307) London Road was so called by the 1830s, (fn. 308) but was alternatively New Road in 1874–5. (fn. 309) The central part of River Road was called the Shipyard in 1660 and later. (fn. 310) Bakers Arms Hill was Short Lane in 1785 (fn. 311) and Baker Hill in 1874–5; (fn. 312) Brewery Hill was Brewhouse Hill in 1872 (fn. 313) and evidently the Short Lane mentioned in 1805. (fn. 314) The road beyond the bridge was described as Arundel causeway in 1660, (fn. 315) and later as the causeway between Arundel and Lyminster. (fn. 316) Its west part was Bridge Street or Queen Street in 1830, (fn. 317) and the east part Brighton Road c. 1832 (fn. 318) and Station Road by 1896. (fn. 319)\n\nLost or unidentified streets were Potente Street (recorded 1311), (fn. 320) Dede, Dide, or Dyde Street (early 15th century), (fn. 321) Jennet Lane (1570 and later), (fn. 322) Mincing Lane south of Tarrant Street (1686), (fn. 323) and Puttock's Hill north of Tarrant Street (1875). (fn. 324) Postern Lane near Hermitage Lane (recorded 1615 and later) and Slutters Lane nearby (1636) evidently lay beyond the Marygate. (fn. 325)\n\nRural settlement.\n\nOutside the town there was never much settlement in the Middle Ages or later, apart from the water mill at Swanbourne, (fn. 326) replaced in the mid 19th century by the castle dairy, windmills and a malthouse by the river in the 19th and 20th centuries, and lodges in the successive parks of the parish. At the conversion of the Great park into a farm in the mid 18th century a farmhouse was built in Park bottom. Apparently at the end of the century it was replaced by Park House, which was demolished after 1824; (fn. 327) a flint terrace of estate cottages was put up on its site before c. 1841 (fn. 328) and survived in 1986. The farmhouse moved in the later 18th century to the modern Park Farmhouse further west. A row of what were apparently farm cottages, called Rooks buildings, was put up south of Chichester Road by 1842; (fn. 329) one single-storeyed cottage survived in 1986. Further cottages east and west of Park Farmhouse were built later in the 19th century.\n\nSECULAR BUILDINGS.\n\nSurviving late medieval secular buildings in High Street are nos. 37–41 (the former Crown inn), including a range parallel with the street much altered later, (fn. 330) and no. 71 (Sefton House), a Wealden house with a small hall. On the corner of High Street and Maltravers Street was a big medieval house jettied on both frontages which was demolished in the later 19th century. (fn. 331) No. 8 Maltravers Street nearby is part of a late medieval threebayed hall house with crown-post roof, while no. 79 at the west end of the same street has evidence of a crown-post roof mostly destroyed. There was a late medieval house at the west end of Tarrant Street on part of the site of the Roman villa, (fn. 332) and a timber-framed house, apparently jettied and perhaps medieval, facing the west front of the church. (fn. 333)\n\nThere are many 16th- and 17th-century houses in the town. No. 51 High Street has late 16thcentury timber-framed ranges along High and Tarrant streets; the angle between was filled in the earlier 17th century by a new block whose ground-floor room has an elaborately moulded plaster ceiling; both that room and the one above retain much original panelling. No. 26 High Street is a notable house of c. 1600 with panelling of early 17th-century style, apparently ex situ, in one back room; there is identical panelling in the front room of no. 33 High Street, which is jettied. No. 12 High Street was perhaps also originally jettied, as was a large house now demolished on the east side of the street opposite Maltravers Street. (fn. 334) In the island of buildings between the market place and the river the low no. 25 High Street on the west side, of timber framing with brick nogging, is 17th-century or earlier, while nos. 17 and 19 on the north side, of the late 17th century, are faced with painted brick. A hip-roofed and timber-framed 16th- or 17th-century house with a large chimneystack stood beside the bridge until the early 20th century. (fn. 335)\n\nSixteenth- or 17th-century houses in Maltravers Street include the timber-framed Little House on the corner of Bakers Arms Hill and the low adjacent brick terrace; two substantial 17thcentury or earlier buildings east of no. 14 (fn. 336) were destroyed in the later 19th century. In Tarrant Street surviving timber-framed houses of the period include the low nos. 13 and 15, faced partly in weatherboarding and partly in painted brick, and no. 21, which is jettied. (fn. 337) A timberframed, hip-roofed house on the south side of the street demolished c. 1900 was 17th-century or earlier, (fn. 338) while the Quaker meeting house on the corner of Tarrant and Arun streets, demolished in 1867, was a tall range, apparently flintor rubble-faced, with a doorway of 16th-century character. (fn. 339)\n\nA much larger demolished building apparently of the 16th or early 17th century was the house called Nineveh at the east end of Tarrant Street. (fn. 340) It was roughly square in plan, faced with flint with stone dressings and stone mullioned windows, and had a massive brick chimneystack. The street frontage was probably occupied from the first by shops, for the two entrances in the early 19th century were a brick arched side doorway in Gothic style and a large porch on the south or river front, both then leading to a large hall which contained a staircase with big newel posts and elaborately carved balusters. There were four or five other rooms on the ground floor, besides cellars in the sloping ground. The chief room seems to have been upstairs; it had moulded oak panelling, two bay windows, and a large open fireplace containing a chimneypiece of Sussex marble with a carved wooden overmantel. The builder of the house is unknown; despite the presence in it of allusions to the heraldry of the earls of Arundel, it seems less likely to have belonged to them than to be the town house of some other important local family. The name Nineveh is recorded, as 'Ninivy', from 1718 and may be a cryptic biblical reference to the house's size. (fn. 341) In 1718 part at least of the building was the Star inn, but by the early 19th century it was in multiple occupation as dwellings and workshops. The building was demolished after 1833, (fn. 342) part of the site being later occupied by the Congregational chapel.\n\nTwo 17th-century timber-framed houses remain in Queen Street south of the bridge: the low no. 10, faced with red brick, and no. 20, which lies back from the street and is rendered. The White Hart inn, also in Queen Street, demolished in the later 19th century, was an apparently jettied building of the 16th century or earlier. (fn. 343)\n\nDuring the early and mid 18th century several houses in the town were refronted in brick, for instance nos. 37–41 and 71 High Street and nos. 8 and 79 Maltravers Street; the encroachment on the street which often accompanied refronting was opposed in vain by the corporation in 1766. (fn. 344) New houses were also built during the period. The former George inn, nos. 30–4 High Street, which incorporates an earlier brick chimneystack at its north end, is a three-storeyed red brick building with rusticated brick quoins, Venetian windows, and some 18th-century internal fittings. It seems likely to have had a central archway to the inn yard, later converted to the shop front of no. 32; the shop fronts of nos. 30 and 34 are late 18th- and early 19th-century respectively. The back range of nos. 55–7 High Street is a three-storeyed red brick structure of mid 18th-century date with an original staircase, while no. 61, also of three storeys, the residence in the 1780s of the lawyer Edward Carleton, (fn. 345) has a simple 18th-century staircase and late 18th-century decoration in some rooms. In the island of buildings between the market place and the river are two three-storeyed houses of the mid or late 18th century: no. 1 High Street facing the river, of red brick formerly stuccoed, and no. 11 on the east side, of whitewashed brick.\n\nIn Maltravers Street nos. 14 and 16 are basically early 18th-century and mid or late 18th-century respectively. Three other mid 18th-century houses in the same street are grander. No. 51, the residence in the 1780s of the timber merchant John Bull, (fn. 346) is a detached three-bayed house with a red and grey brick front, the central bay being pedimented; it has some original internal fittings, and was enlarged at the back in the early 19th century. There is a contemporary detached coach house and stable in Kings Arms Hill. No. 26, the house of John Shaft, grocer and tallow chandler, in the 1780s (fn. 347) which became the vicarage in the mid 20th century, has an impressive brick front with original two-storeyed canted bay windows and a later porch. (fn. 348) The interior is fitted to a high standard with plaster cornices and much original joinery; the staircase has original carved tread ends, but its newel posts and fret in Chinese Chippendale style do not match them, and were apparently brought from elsewhere. A contemporary coach house and stable adjoin. Nos. 50–4 Maltravers Street, the residence in the 1780s of the coal merchant George Lane, (fn. 349) comprise a mid or late 18thcentury building of two and a half storeys and three bays, which was enlarged in the early 19th century at the sides and rear, with overarched Venetian windows in the side bays. The side facade of the west wing has a Portland stone depressed-arched doorway with 'Gibbsian' rusticated quoins, and two Portland stone keystones; the type of stone is unusual for Arundel, and they may be fragments from the early 18th-century work at the castle, removed during rebuilding c. 1800.\n\nIn minor streets, no. 2 Bakers Arms Hill, of the early 18th century, has a facade with elaborately moulded brick window cornices surprising in such a small building, while no. 24 River Road, of grey brick with red brick dressings and rubbed brick voussoirs, is very lavish for its position. There are also 18th-century brick or flint houses and cottages in less important areas of the town: Arun Street, Park Place and Mount Pleasant on the west edge, and Queen Street south of the river; in Park Place is an 18th- or early 19th-century coach house possibly for a house in Maltravers Street.\n\nMany large red brick houses in the town of the late 18th and early 19th centuries share common features: a weak cornice formed by a single course of brick modillions, a terrace plan with toplit staircase across the building between front and rear rooms, and a slim unbroken baluster rail, usually of mahogany.\n\nThe grandest are in Maltravers Street. (fn. 350) No. 13 (Duff House) at the east end, is a three-bayed, two-storeyed building, originally detached; a brick on the rear façade has a date in the 1780s, when the merchant Joseph Coote lived there. (fn. 351) There is 18th-century decoration on the first floor, but the ground floor was refitted c. 1815, when the two main rooms were interconnected by double doors. No. 15, of three much taller storeys, was built on to no. 13 apparently in the 1790s; (fn. 352) a dining room with a low coved ceiling and other 'Soanian' decoration was added on the west side c. 1825, and the porch is 20th-century. (fn. 353) There is a contemporary stable and coach house adjoining, and the garden preserves its original extent downhill to Tarrant Street. Further west nos. 53–61 form a continuous terrace of two or three storeys with a basement. Nos. 55–7, which externally seem a single house, were built c. 1780 for two members of the Digance family, both merchants. (fn. 354) No. 55 has a good front room on the first floor and a large back room on the ground floor with a fine Adam-style entablature and a boarded dado with elaborate top moulding; a new wide entrance hall was added on the east in the early 19th century, the old hall being thrown into the front room. Nos. 59–61 are also a pair: no. 59, the smaller, has a big first-floor front room with fine late 18th-century decoration including an Adam-style entablature, while no. 61 has a very large first-floor room across its whole frontage and a fine square staircase hall with pyramidal skylight. (fn. 355)\n\nNos. 45–9 and 49A Maltravers Street, also on the south side, are an early 19th-century (fn. 356) stuccoed terrace of three storeys and basement with a prominent continuous cornice; nos. 49 and 49A were refitted internally in the mid or late 19th century, when a two-storeyed tiled iron veranda and bow windows were added at the back. No. 18 Maltravers Street on the north side is also stuccoed, with a segmentally bowed window on the ground floor; built between 1833 and 1847, it occupies the site of one of Arundel's theatres. (fn. 357)\n\nThe tall front range of nos. 55–7 High Street, of the late 18th century, is of local yellow brick with stone dressings; in the 1780s it was the residence of the mercer, later banker, Charles Bushby. (fn. 358) Almost opposite, the imposing red brick Norfolk Arms hotel was built by the duke of Norfolk between 1782 and 1785, (fn. 359) its most striking feature being the large-scale lettering of its name added in the early 19th century over the central archway to the yard. The early 19th-century no. 67 High Street has various internal fittings brought from elsewhere, including a coffered ceiling in Italian 16th-century style.\n\nTarrant Street between 1785 and 1788 acquired at its western end a group of mainly threestoreyed red brick houses; (fn. 360) no. 42 has a fine porch, while no. 54 has an original coach house and stable on the west, and a business office added later between with a separate entrance. New buildings built elsewhere in the town in the early 19th century were generally humbler. At the north-west end there are plain two-storeyed terraces mostly of flint or beach pebbles with brick dressings, some whitewashed, in King and Bond streets, Orchard Place, and Mount Pleasant. Other contemporary terraces of cottages are nos. 8–18 Arun Street, of galletted flint with yellow brick dressings, nos. 7–25 Surrey Street, of Plymouth stone (fn. 361) with yellow brick dressings and dated 1821, and the mid 19th-century stuccoed nos. 74–84 Maltravers Street. (fn. 362)\n\nSome 19th-century public buildings in the town were in classical style: the Bridge hotel in Queen Street, (fn. 363) the corn store on the town quay, (fn. 364) and the Victoria institute in Tarrant Street, built in the 1840s or 50s as the Arundel savings bank, (fn. 365) which has 'Egyptian'-style window surrounds. The Swan hotel was rebuilt in the mid 19th century in Italianate style. By far the more common style for new buildings in the town after that period was revived medieval or Tudor. Two earlier examples were Tower House in London Road built c. 1795 (fn. 366) and the new town hall in Maltravers Street of 1834–5. (fn. 367) Tower House is a pair of tall semidetached villas of yellow stock brick with ashlar dressings, asymmetrical in plan with a polygonal stone tower at the east end. Its castellated Gothic style, which can be compared to that of the contemporary work on the castle and was evidently meant to match it, seems to have been due to the duke of Norfolk, and was dubbed by a visitor in 1803 the 'Arundelian order of architecture'. Further examples in the town alluded to then and later (fn. 368) evidently included the restored Marygate and college buildings, and buildings in the castle grounds and park. The town hall, designed by Robert Abraham, (fn. 369) is in a gloomy Norman style, evidently also intended to pay homage to the castle, and echoed in the same architect's Congregational chapel in Tarrant Street and in the contemporary pumping house at Swanbourne lake. (fn. 370)\n\nMedieval- or Tudor-style buildings put up between the mid 19th century and the earlier 20th are more picturesque. A pair of Norfolk estate cottages in Maltravers Street of 1849 are in Tudor style, in red and grey brick with decorated bargeboards; the brick and stone façade of no. 38, the former custom house, is similar. (fn. 371) Nos. 40–4 Maltravers Street of c. 1883, designed by J. A. Hansom, (fn. 372) are also of red brick and stone with a prominent first-floor corner statue in a niche of Duke Henry's patron saint, the Emperor Henry II. Also perhaps by Hansom, and with some half-timbering, are nos. 66–70 Maltravers Street, at the west end, and a building on the corner of Maltravers and High streets, whose first floor is jettied on both frontages like that of its medieval predecessor.\n\nThe north-west part of the town, largely belonging to the Norfolk estate, acquired several comparable buildings from the 1860s, notably Hansom's French Gothic Roman Catholic church of 1869–73 and its attached presbytery. The Catholic boys' school, later St. Mary's hall, on the corner of London Road and Mount Pleasant, is also by Hansom, and has a prominent corner statue under a canopy of the Virgin and Child. (fn. 373) In Bond Street is a terrace of red brick and sandstone estate cottages dated 1868, enlivened by projecting porches and dormer windows with bargeboards, and raised on a brick platform. Other Tudor-style estate cottages of c. 1870 in London Road also have tall chimneystacks.\n\nFour striking buildings in historical styles were put up at the lower end of the town in the 1890s and early 1900s. Nos. 18–20 High Street, dated 1890, is of red brick and stone with flushwork and diaper patterning, one of its six gables carrying a stone anvil emblematic of the ironmonger's shop below. Lloyds Bank next door, built before 1893, (fn. 374) is in Norman Shavian halftimbered style with tall chimneys, a dormer window, and another prominent gable. The post office building of c. 1895, by the Norfolk estate architect W. Heveningham, (fn. 375) with a red brick ground floor and half-timbered, many-gabled upper floor, acts as a frontispiece to the town when approached from the south-east, leading the eye up to the castle on the skyline. Still more picturesque are the new offices of the West Sussex Gazette built in 1899–1900 to the designs of Wheeler and Lodge of London, and then described as probably 'the most artistic newspaper office ... in England'. (fn. 376) The elaborately detailed façade of three storeys with a gable uses glass, pebbledash, and limestone ashlar as well as brick and timber, and the south side is crowned by six attached chimneys of hexagonal plan. The printing works of 1906 at the rear, with an ornate façade on Tarrant Street, is by the same firm of architects. (fn. 377)\n\nOUTSIDE THE TOWN.\n\nPark House or Arundel Park, (fn. 378) in Park bottom west of the town, may have existed by the mid 1790s. The home of Lord Henry Howard-Molyneux-Howard (d. 1824), brother of Duke Bernard Edward (d. 1842), (fn. 379) it was of nine bays and two storeys; (fn. 380) it was demolished after his death. (fn. 381) The grounds of the house included an oblong lake and specimen trees. (fn. 382) A pair of stone lodges on Chichester Road, built by 1804, (fn. 383) survived in 1995.\n\nPark Farmhouse further west is chiefly late 18th- or early 19th-century, with a three-bayed classical west front of knapped flint with yellow brick dressings; the building is otherwise mostly of flint rubble. A chimneystack, together with some window frames and a stone moulding on the east front, perhaps re-used, survive from an earlier building, which was presumably a lodge in the park; some internal doorcases, however, seem grander than would be expected in a lodge, and may be 18th-century work from the castle, removed at its remodelling in the later 18th century or early 19th. The north front, in contrast to the west, is in asymmetrical Gothic style with a two-storeyed stone bay window apparently intended as an 'eyecatcher'; the front is not 16th-century (fn. 384) and may have been designed by Duke Charles (d. 1815). (fn. 385) Model farm buildings were added to the east in the mid 19th century, including a large flint barn dated 1837 and a piggery built in 1845. (fn. 386) There is also an octagonal horse gin.\n\nDEFENCES.\n\nAs the first defensible site inland from the Arun estuary Arundel is likely to have had fortifications of some sort from an early period. Part of a curved earthwork which survives north-west of the north bailey of the castle may represent a fortification preceding that, perhaps prehistoric in date.\n\nThe Little park (the present castle cricket ground) north-west of the castle is bounded on its north, west, and south sides by linear earthworks. That on the north, of impressive size, was continued south-westwards in the mid 17th century on a much slighter scale; (fn. 387) the earthwork as a whole, therefore, cannot be a prehistoric attempt to defend the chalk promontory on which the town lies, as suggested by Tierney. (fn. 388)\n\nThe Little park earthworks may have been constructed to contain the putative late AngloSaxon burh, (fn. 389) an idea perhaps corroborated by Saxo-Norman pottery found in the northern earthwork. (fn. 390) The south part of the western earthwork is missing, possibly through 19th-century landscaping of the castle grounds, while the lack of an eastern earthwork may be due to the steepness of the cliff at that point. (fn. 391) The southern earthwork seems to have been re-used as part of the later medieval town defences. (fn. 392) At the point where the northern earthwork is cut by the apparently early track descending the downs, the lower portion of which is followed by High Street, (fn. 393) are the remains of a chalk rubble and Caen stone gateway seemingly built in the late 11th century or early 12th, (fn. 394) but perhaps succeeding an earlier one. The gate was apparently the Red gate mentioned in 1570, (fn. 395) since the London road to the north was called Red Lane. (fn. 396) It still stood in part in 1851 (fn. 397) but was afterwards grassed over.\n\nThe Norman town, which seems to have lain chiefly along the track mentioned both inside and outside the Little park, (fn. 398) probably had no defences until the late 13th century, the north gateway being then perhaps used less for defence than for collecting tolls. In 1295 a 10-years' grant of murage was obtained for the town by the earl of Arundel. (fn. 399) The line of defences created was apparently new and excluded the Little park, the north-westwards continuation of High Street being diverted. Starting from what was apparently a new gate (fn. 400) by the outer ditch of the north bailey of the castle the circuit ran west to a second gate, the Marygate, built across the new London road; the earthwork between the two gates may be the re-used southern defence of the putative Anglo-Saxon burh, turned to face outwards instead of inwards, and provided with a ditch on the north side which survived in 1995. From the Marygate the line of the new defences ran south-west, first within the modern castle grounds, and then down Mount Pleasant, Park Place, and School Lane, where a natural cliff was scarped back. (fn. 401) Mount Pleasant was known by 1615 as Whitings dyke, (fn. 402) possibly from a personal name. A section of earthwork was said to be still visible by the St. Mary's Gate inn in London Road in 1851. (fn. 403) At the point where the circuit crossed Maltravers Street was a third gate called the Marshgate or Watergate. (fn. 404)\n\nThe medieval defences seem only ever to have been of earth, as also happened in some larger medieval towns. (fn. 405) It is notable that they protected only the north and west sides of the town. The south side would have been defended by the river, though nothing is known of any gate on the bridge. The sector between the bridge and the castle was undefended, the terrain perhaps making it unnecessary. References to 'the new ditch' in or near Tarrant Street in the early 15th century (fn. 406) may suggest either that the south end of the western line of defence was not completed until then, or that it was extended at that date nearer the river.\n\nIt is not clear which gate was referred to in 1321, when packing service was owed at Ham manor in Angmering 'beyond the gate of Arundel'. (fn. 407) The Marygate probably existed in 1343, when a chapel, apparently dedicated to St. Mary, was said to have been newly founded at the north gate of the town. (fn. 408) The name Marygate was in use by the early 15th century. (fn. 409) The medieval building is said to have been of ashlar masonry. Besides the chapel over the archway, which had a two-light cusped window and was reached by an external flight of steps, there was a room each side on the ground floor. (fn. 410) Part of the gate at least had apparently been converted into a dwelling by 1636, (fn. 411) and the structure was certainly used as dwellings later. (fn. 412) Only the side piers of the gate next to the north bailey ditch remained in 1781, (fn. 413) and only the ivy-covered stump of its east pier, of flint and stone, by 1989. The Marshgate or Watergate is recorded only between 1615 (fn. 414) and 1712 (fn. 415) and had been demolished by 1785. (fn. 416) A postern gate near the Marygate is indicated by the road name Postern Lane recorded in the area in the early 17th century. (fn. 417)\n\nThe town defences were strengthened in December 1643 by Ralph Hopton, Lord Hopton, after his capture of the town for Charles I. (fn. 418) A south-westwards continuation of the northern earthwork of the Little park down to Park bottom prevented access from the west; the portion of Hopton's work which survives on either side of London Road and which was later known as Roads ditch, possibly from a personal name, (fn. 419) is distinguished from the northern earthwork of the park by its much slighter scale. (fn. 420) At the same time the latter was apparently heightened and its ditch deepened. Hopton also threw up a double earthwork north of the town near Swanbourne lake in order to cut off a possible approach by way of Mill Lane under the east side of the castle. That seems to be the ditch and banks of which there are traces on the steep hill between the lake and the north-east corner of the Little park. (fn. 421) When Sir William Waller returned to retake the town for Parliament soon afterwards he broke through both lines of defence, those on the west withstanding his assault for two hours. (fn. 422) The circular mounds at each end of the northern earthwork of the Little park (fn. 423) may be gun emplacements created thereafter to command the castle.\n\nAfter Waller's capture of the town and castle in January 1644 the fortifications of the town may again have been strengthened. In 1653, however, the castle was slighted, (fn. 424) and six years later the town defences were ordered to be 'thoroughly' demolished. (fn. 425)\n\nThe Marygate may have been damaged in the Civil War, for lead was removed from the roof, apparently by the mayor, before 1652. (fn. 426) The upper storey survived in the 1720s, (fn. 427) but by 1780 the arch had been taken down as dangerous to users of the London road, (fn. 428) apparently the chief means of approach to the town by land. (fn. 429) By 1809 the duke of Norfolk had acquired the remains of the gate (fn. 430) and before 1815 he restored it in medieval style. (fn. 431) Part of the original structure remains on the south side west of the archway, but the present building is mostly 19th-century and later; it is of flint with sandstone dressings, including some flushwork, and has battlements and machicolations on both faces. The portion of wall west of the gate was built of Plymouth rock shortly before 1817. (fn. 432) The gate was again restored in the early 20th century, when an external staircase to the upper floor was built on the south side. (fn. 433) The ceiling of the upstairs room has four massive oak timbers with 16th-century-style heraldic decoration which partly relates to the FitzAlan family. (fn. 434) Evidently too large and too much weathered to have been part of an interior decorative ensemble, they may be timbers from a drawbridge. (fn. 435)\n\nThe landscaping of the castle grounds in the early 19th century apparently included major alterations to the Little park earthworks, which in 1819 had been said to be still complete. (fn. 436) The bank east of the Marygate was levelled and turned into two terraces apparently by 1825, (fn. 437) while its east end seems to have been pushed into the ditch to give a link and a level vista to the park from the section of the grounds nearer the castle. The south part of the park's western earthwork may have been removed at the same date.\n\nRELIGIOUS HOUSES.\n\nArundel was the site of seven medieval religious houses; five at least were under the patronage of successive lords of the rape, as were two others nearby, Pynham priory in Lyminster and Tortington priory. (fn. 438)\n\nThe histories of the apparently pre-Conquest minster church, the Norman priory, and the college which succeeded it in the later 14th century are treated below. (fn. 439)\n\nCollege buildings.\n\nThe buildings of the college perhaps occupied the same site as those of the priory, and are architecturally en suite with the new parish church of the same date. The Fitzalan chapel of the parish church formed the college's north side, and there were two-storeyed east, south and west ranges; the east range lies beyond the east end of the Fitzalan chapel, and the outer wall of the west range is aligned with the east wall of the south transept of the church. The entrance gateway was apparently at the south-west corner, (fn. 440) on the same site as the present 19th-century entrance, and the master's house is said to have been in the north-east corner, a small gallery giving access to the Fitzalan chapel behind its high altar. (fn. 441) There was a cloister along the northern section of the east range and also along the wall of the Fitzalan chapel; (fn. 442) part survived in 1989.\n\nSince the area enclosed by the three ranges and the chapel is very large, it may originally have been divided into separate north and south courtyards, as at the slightly earlier college at Cobham (Kent). (fn. 443) If so, the northern courtyard may have had a cloister all round, and the hall mentioned in 1382 (fn. 444) may have lain in the cross range between the courtyards, as at Cobham. A chapter house was mentioned in 1401. (fn. 445) It is not clear whether there was a college graveyard separate from the parish churchyard.\n\nIn 1644 the east and south ranges of the college were depicted as complete. (fn. 446) A visitor in 1635 had mentioned the cloister and gardens, and 'a fair long building' nearby, perhaps the hall, in which quarter sessions were then held, and at the end of which was a low round tower of stone with a conical top, apparently a former calefactory. (fn. 447) At that time part of the buildings at least was let, presumably as a dwelling. (fn. 448) The college was apparently damaged during the Civil War, for stone and timber were removed from it for re-use elsewhere in 1657–8. (fn. 449) Repairs were carried out between 1659 and 1664 (fn. 450) and c. 1678. (fn. 451) In the mid 18th century the buildings were described by two separate visitors as merely remains, (fn. 452) and in 1780 the east and west ranges seem to have survived in parts of their outer walls only. (fn. 453) There were some structures inside the shell of the south range in 1788. (fn. 454)\n\nThe north-east corner of the quadrangle, on the other hand, had been rebuilt or restored during the 18th century as a residence for the duke of Norfolk's agent. (fn. 455) In the 1780s that building consisted of a west range running north-south, with a canted bay under its north gable, and an east range running east–west with an 18th-century porch on the north side. (fn. 456) Between 1804 (fn. 457) and 1815 (fn. 458) the building was rebuilt in Gothic style and about that time it housed a private school. (fn. 459)\n\nIn the late 18th or early 19th century, apparently by 1797, (fn. 460) Duke Charles (d. 1815) restored the south range of the college, its west end becoming a Roman Catholic chapel, with the chaplain's residence and other dwellings further east; (fn. 461) a terrace was constructed on the south side above the new London road. Some contemporary fittings remained in that range in 1989. The late 18th- or early 19th-century work was in grey Plymouth stone, (fn. 462) in contrast to the flint and stone with sandstone dressings of the original work; the walls were crenellated, a practice continued in later 19th- and 20th-century alterations. (fn. 463) In 1834 the external walls of the unrestored east and west ranges retained many, if not most, of their original trefoil-headed windows. (fn. 464) The Catholic chapel was lengthened westwards in 1865, but ceased to be used after the new Catholic church was opened in 1873. (fn. 465)\n\nBy 1842 part of the east range was used as a laundry for the castle, (fn. 466) as later. (fn. 467) In the 1850s the south-east corner of the college was converted into a convent, (fn. 468) as it remained until the 1950s. (fn. 469) At the same period the appearance of the north side of the courtyard was spoilt by the building of the funerary chapel of Duke Henry Granville (d. 1860), which projects from the south side of the Fitzalan chapel. Between the mid 1870s (fn. 470) and the 1890s (fn. 471) the west part of the south range and a new west range were used for a girls' and infants' school; a girls' club occupied part of those premises in 1899, and they were added to the convent in 1903–4, when further alterations and repairs were carried out. (fn. 472) The 19th-century west range was later removed, leaving the west wall to stand alone.\n\nBetween c. 1961 and 1974 the college buildings were used as a children's home with 30 inmates, and after 1976 the south range and part of the east range were converted as an old people's home and the north-east corner was divided into flats for the elderly, both run by the Order of Malta Homes Trust. (fn. 473) The former Catholic chapel was converted in 1976–7 for use as a theatre, (fn. 474) the early 19th-century west gallery and flat ceiling in Gothic style remaining, the former ex situ.\n\nDominican friary.\n\nThe Dominican friary founded in Arundel by 1253 (fn. 475) has been said since 1834, on the basis of oral tradition, to have occupied a site on the east or west corner of Maltravers Street and Parson's Hill; (fn. 476) Hollar's view of Arundel of 1644 shows a church apparently there with a tower and low spire like those of the parish church. (fn. 477)\n\nHollar's view of the town, however, is untrustworthy in other details, (fn. 478) and it is more likely that the second church in it was added simply for artistic effect. It is clear from other evidence that the friary occupied the buildings beside the bridge hitherto identified with Holy Trinity hospital (the Maison Dieu). In 1619–20 reference was made to the building of a pier or jetty at the north side of the bridge next to the Friars, (fn. 479) and two drawings of the buildings by Grimm are captioned 'the friary chapel'. (fn. 480) A body was said to have been washed ashore at 'Fryers' within the borough in 1543, (fn. 481) which corroborates a riverside site, as does mention of a boathouse beside the friary in the late 14th century. (fn. 482) A close next to the former friary in the 16th or 17th century was called Friars meadow. (fn. 483)\n\nFurther, though the buildings of the 'Maison Dieu' themselves lack dating evidence, except for a possibly 14th-century doorway in the demolished west range, (fn. 484) finds made during partial excavation of the site in the 1960s included 13thand early 14th-century material. (fn. 485) The prominent site by the bridge, the port, and the market would be much more appropriate to a preaching order than to a hospital. Moreover, the scale of the buildings is not incommensurate with the friary, which though it was poor by 1402 (fn. 486) and remained so at the Dissolution, when there were only five inmates, had earlier had perhaps 20 or 22. (fn. 487) In the mid 19th century interments were said to be still traceable in what was presumed to be a former cemetery nearby. (fn. 488)\n\nThe buildings of the friary, formerly known as the Maison Dieu, may have consisted of north, south, and west ranges round a courtyard; (fn. 489) no east range is known, and the east side of the courtyard may have been open. In the 17th century part of the site at least was apparently let as a dwelling, and repairs were mentioned in 1659. (fn. 490) The two-storeyed south range, which survived in 1995 between Mill Road and the river, had been gutted by 1780, when only its east wall, with a large window, survived above ground-floor level. At that date it was used as a timber yard, (fn. 491) as it continued to be in the mid 19th century. (fn. 492) The range is of flint and clunch with sandstone dressings, the north wall showing evidence of a cloister on its north face. The west range, also of two storeys, may have been the dormitory; (fn. 493) an arched doorway in its west wall was possibly 14th-century, (fn. 494) and there was a large three-light window in the north wall of its upper storey. (fn. 495) By 1780 the range had become a malthouse, (fn. 496) as it remained in 1851; (fn. 497) most of it was destroyed apparently in the later 19th century, (fn. 498) and what remained of the north wall collapsed in a gale in 1965. (fn. 499) The north range was apparently already in ruins by 1780; (fn. 500) part, also of flint and clunch with stone dressings, survived in 1995 behind the post office in High Street. The north range evidently contained the church, which in 1382 had both a high and a low altar. (fn. 501) Traces of a gateway between the south and west ranges are said to have been visible in 1834. (fn. 502) The surviving remains were consolidated and restored in the 1990s. (fn. 503)\n\nHospitals.\n\nThe hospital of St. James for female lepers recorded between 1182 and 1301 (fn. 504) was occupied by a hermit by 1435. (fn. 505) Its site was north-west of the town towards Park bottom near the pale of the Great park, (fn. 506) where ruins of the hermitage were visible in 1636 (fn. 507) and where fields called the Hermitage or Armitage remained in 1776. (fn. 508) Foundations were said to be discernible in 1834 (fn. 509) and medieval tiles and pottery were found there in the early 20th century. (fn. 510)\n\nSince 1793 the site of Holy Trinity hospital (the Maison Dieu) founded in 1395 has been assumed to occupy the remains of buildings by the bridge; (fn. 511) but for reasons stated above those buildings rightly belong to the Dominican friary. The hospital, which was to have chapel, refectory, and dormitory, (fn. 512) was founded under the aegis of the college, (fn. 513) and could be expected to be near it and secluded, rather than half a mile away and in a prominent, public, and noisy position. Further, one of the tasks enjoined on the aged or infirm inmates was weeding the churchyard walks, (fn. 514) a difficulty if it involved climbing the length of High Street. The most likely site for the hospital is north-west of the church, where an almshouse was said to stand in 1636, (fn. 515) and where a visitor in the 1720s mentioned an 'old priory' in the process of being demolished, stone from it being used to build the new bridge. (fn. 516) The northern part of the west wall of the churchyard together with the westwards continuation of its north wall seem in their lower courses to belong to that building; they are of flint and stone, with windows and doorways of 14th- or 15th-century character, (fn. 517) and closely match the contemporary church and college in style. Within the castle car park which they partly enclose numerous human bones were excavated in the early 19th century, (fn. 518) perhaps from the chapel of the hospital.\n\nThe hospital of St. John the Baptist mentioned in 1269 (fn. 519) has not been located, and no more is heard of it.\n\nCOMMUNICATIONS. (fn. 520)\n\nRoads.\n\nThe Roman road from Chichester to Brighton passed through the south end of the parish, apparently crossing the river Arun by a ferry between the sites of the gasworks and the railway station. (fn. 521) High Street seems to be part of another early route, running from the crest of the downs, through what later became first the Little park and afterwards the castle cricket ground, to a higher river crossing on or near the site of the modern bridge. The route later followed by Mill Lane along the west side of the river valley north of the bridge may also be early.\n\nIn the Middle Ages (fn. 522) and later (fn. 523) Arundel lay on the main road between Chichester and Lewes, part of the great route between Southampton and Canterbury. The section between Chichester and Arundel was especially important while the rapes of Arundel and Chichester were still undivided; (fn. 524) east of Arundel the road used the drier downland country via Findon and Steyning. The downland road to Steyning remained important in later times, providing an alternative route to Horsham in 1771 (fn. 525) and to London in 1775. (fn. 526) The road from Arundel to Shoreham, the modern A 27, was mentioned c. 1215 (fn. 527) and also remained important, (fn. 528) though never turnpiked. (fn. 529) South and south-east of Park Farm the gradient was apparently eased in the late 18th century or early 19th by a cutting and embankment which survived in 1986. Canada Road, south of Chichester Road, was cut c. 1813 to replace part of it (fn. 530) but never did so; it was called Green Lane in 1910. (fn. 531)\n\nA causeway across the valley existed at a date before 1151, when Adelize, wife of William d'Aubigny, earl of Arundel, founded Pynham priory in Lyminster with the duty of maintaining it; the alternative name of the priory was de Calceto ('of the causeway'). The priory's exemption from tax in the 1340s seems to have been granted in order not to prejudice that work. (fn. 532) It is not clear whether the main channel or channels of the river were bridged by the mid 12th century as well; the description of High Street in the later 12th or early 13th century as the road leading to the ferry (apud passag') suggests not. (fn. 533) A bridge existed, however, by 1263. (fn. 534) Bridge and causeway are mentioned together in 1454, (fn. 535) and implicitly in 1568, when the bridge was described as an ancient one of timber, of great height and length. (fn. 536) The borough authorities were concerned with repair by the mid 15th century, (fn. 537) and in the early 16th income was also received from bequests. (fn. 538)\n\nAfter the Dissolution the borough assumed Pynham priory's responsibility for the bridge, (fn. 539) perhaps including the rest of the causeway, and between the 16th century and the 19th the mayor generally had the additional title of bridgewarden. (fn. 540) The profits of the burgess brooks, however, were retained by the corporation for its own use. (fn. 541) The cost of bridge repair was met partly by local collections until 1568, when the corporation received licence to raise money for the purpose by the export, duty free, of 400 qr. wheat a year for five years. (fn. 542) Further collections were made c. 1593 (fn. 543) and in 1610 (fn. 544) from parishes in western Sussex, and in the early 1640s in the town and its immediate vicinity, 100 loads of timber being supplied by the earl of Arundel. (fn. 545) Money was still apparently sometimes collected in the early 19th century. (fn. 546)\n\nMeanwhile, an application to quarter sessions in 1592 for a rate to be levied for the purpose on the three western rapes was refused, (fn. 547) and in the early 1640s the corporation was forbidden to levy a bridge rate within the borough. (fn. 548) As a quid pro quo Arundel was exempted in the 18th and 19th centuries, and perhaps earlier too, from the general rate for bridge repair within the rape, and from rates for the repair of other individual bridges in the county. (fn. 549) In 1679, nevertheless, (fn. 550) the corporation did levy a bridge rate, and in the early 19th century the poor rate met most of the cost of repair, the sum received in 1802 being £68. (fn. 551) Two additional items of income between the later 16th century and the early 20th (fn. 552) were the annuity of £2 devised in 1592 by Thomas Taylor, a former mayor, from the Crown house in High Street, presumably the Crown inn, (fn. 553) and the rent of a storehouse by the quay devised in the following year by another former mayor, Edmund Shephard. (fn. 554)\n\nThe bridge was depicted in 1644 as of wooden trestle construction. (fn. 555) It was replaced in 1724 by a.new stone bridge of three arches, paid for by a relation of one of the town's M.P.s. (fn. 556) Portland stone was used for repairs in 1784 and 1805, and the crown of the bridge was levelled in 1785. (fn. 557) In 1825 the inhabitants resolved to widen the bridge to cater for the increased traffic caused by the growth of nearby coastal resorts. (fn. 558) The work, which included levelling the approaches and adding a paved footpath on each side supported on brackets, was carried out in 1831 using surplus funds of the Arundel savings bank which the mayor and bridgewarden William Holmes later had to repay. (fn. 559)\n\nIn 1896 repairs were being financed from the town rates and a Local Government Board loan. (fn. 560) The unfairness of a small town's having to maintain a bridge for the benefit of traffic generated by much larger, and faster growing, places was finally recognized in 1900, when the new West Sussex county council agreed to pay £150, three fifths of the estimated cost of the bridge's improvement; (fn. 561) the county council, however, did not take over permanent responsibility for the bridge until 1930. (fn. 562) A new, wider, threearched bridge of reinforced concrete faced with sandstone was built in 1935, inscriptions of 1724 and 1831 being reset in it. (fn. 563)\n\nA ferry at an unknown site was maintained by the corporation in 1609. (fn. 564)\n\nA relief road for east—west traffic, first planned in the late 1930s, (fn. 565) was opened in 1973 (fn. 566) across the marshes south of the town; a north-westwards continuation beside Park bottom bypassed the town for London traffic too. A new bypass road further south was being planned in 1995.\n\nThe medieval road to London, as indicated above, originally passed through what was later first the Little park and afterwards the castle cricket ground. It seems to have been diverted westwards round the Little park when the latter was created apparently c. 1300, passing through the new line of defences by way of the Marygate. North of the town the road was known as Red Lane by 1636. (fn. 567) In 1675 the London road was depicted via Billingshurst, (fn. 568) but in the 18th century an alternative route ran through Petworth. (fn. 569) In the later 18th century the Arundel—London road was said to be very good. (fn. 570)\n\nIn 1757 the London road in the parish was made a turnpike, as part of a route via Bury to Guildford; (fn. 571) the work authorized had not been completed by 1778, (fn. 572) however, and in 1799 the trustees were absolved from repairing the section of road between Arundel and Newbridge in Wisborough Green. (fn. 573) The London road within the parish was afterwards diverted in two stages during the creation of the new landscaped park. In 1793 the duke of Norfolk was authorized to close the northern section and replace it by a new road already built from the north-west corner of the Little park by way of a new lodge, the Green Doors lodge, to Whiteways in Houghton on the crest of the downs. (fn. 574) The southern section was replaced in 1803 by a second new road, (fn. 575) planned from 1796, (fn. 576) which led from near the top of High Street round the south side of the church and college to a point beyond the Green Doors lodge. The two new sections of road were turnpiked between 1803 and 1881. (fn. 577) The southern part of the old road, however, remained open in 1829, when a visitor complained that the entrance through the Marygate was one of the worst town approaches in Britain. (fn. 578) The line of the medieval road was followed by a track in 1995.\n\nTwo minor roads branched off from the old London road north of the Little park. Pughdean Lane to the north-east, recorded from 1615, (fn. 579) led to Houghton by way of Pughdean bottom above Swanbourne lake. (fn. 580) On the west side Hermitage Lane, so called in 1636, (fn. 581) led to the site of the former leper hospital near Park bottom. (fn. 582) Both roads survived in the 1770s (fn. 583) but were later absorbed into the new landscaped park created after 1786. Hermitage Lane was still traceable in 1834 (fn. 584) but afterwards disappeared. The line of Pughdean Lane was marked in 1922 by a double row of old trees 400 ft. (122 metres) south of Hiorne's tower; (fn. 585) in 1988 it was followed in part by a bank.\n\nA road to Madehurst was mentioned in 1158. (fn. 586) The track leading to Slindon along the southwest side of Rewell wood is presumably ancient, since it is followed in part by the parish boundary; (fn. 587) in 1817, however, it was overgrown and evidently ceasing to be used. (fn. 588) Queens Lane and Fitzalan Road on the east side of the river led to the windmill south of the town (fn. 589) but were unnamed until the 20th century. (fn. 590)\n\nThe street names of the town are discussed above. (fn. 591) Surrey Street joining the western ends of Tarrant and Maltravers streets was cut c. 1783 by the parish surveyors of highways across land belonging to the duke of Norfolk. (fn. 592) The New Cut between the eastern ends of Maltravers Street and London Road, so named c. 1875, (fn. 593) was made c. 1805. (fn. 594) Mill Lane, the old road northwards to Swanbourne mill and South Stoke along the edge of the river valley, was proposed for closure by the duke of Norfolk in 1850, since conversations, including offensive language, could be heard from it within the castle; a new road was to replace it across the marshes up to ⅓ mile (535 metres) east of the town. The proposal was rejected on appeal to quarter sessions by the brewer George Constable. (fn. 595) Mill Lane was eventually closed to traffic in 1894, when the wide, tree-lined Mill Road was opened, nearer the town than the replacement road of 1850. (fn. 596) The line of Mill Lane through the castle grounds could still be traced in 1987.\n\nCarriers.\n\nA carrier of Arundel was presented apparently for Sunday drinking in Binsted in 1626. (fn. 597) There was a carrier to London in 1657 (fn. 598) and there were two in 1681; (fn. 599) probate inventories survive for three others between 1690 and 1734. (fn. 600) In the mid 1790s a carter's wagon arrived from London twice weekly. (fn. 601) By the early 1830s there were carriers to London and Portsmouth four days a week, to Chichester, Brighton, and Bognor two days a week, and to Littlehampton daily. (fn. 602) The London carrier no longer operated in 1852, when a 'railway carrier' at the Norfolk Arms hotel was first mentioned, the service continuing until 1938 or later. By 1866 Chichester and Brighton were the only distant places to be served by carriers; the service to Brighton ceased by 1874, and that to Chichester after 1913. (fn. 603) In 1900 carriers plied between Arundel and several nearby villages at least weekly. (fn. 604)\n\nCoaches and buses.\n\nAn Arundel coach ran to London apparently by way of Lewes in 1791; (fn. 605) in the mid 1790s there were coaches to London and back three times a week. (fn. 606) A short-lived service via Horsham was running in 1809, (fn. 607) and in 1812 the London coach went by way of Petworth. (fn. 608) About 1818 R. W. Walker of Michelgrove house in Clapham set up a rival daily coach via Dorking. (fn. 609) In the early 1830s there were six London coaches a week in winter and nine in summer; (fn. 610) in the 1840s the journey apparently took four hours. (fn. 611) Brighton and Portsmouth were served three times weekly in the mid 1790s; (fn. 612) there was a daily service to Brighton in 1812 (fn. 613) and to Portsmouth by 1817. (fn. 614) A coach to Salisbury and Bath ran via Chichester in 1809. (fn. 615) In the early 1830s there were six coaches a week to Southampton and three to Bath and Bristol. (fn. 616) London, Southampton, and Portsmouth could all still be reached daily by coach in 1845, but all coach services to and from the town ceased soon afterwards. From 1847 or earlier horse omnibuses of the railway company met each train at successive stations serving Arundel. Motor b"
