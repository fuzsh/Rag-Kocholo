        "text": "Similarly, Shreya mapped the many individuals of Indian heritage such as coin dealer Chanda Mall (active 1872-1901) who sold coins to British numismatist Richard Bertram Whitehead (1879-1967) to help develop his collection. Using a visualisation programme called Onodo, Shreya’s research aimed to decentre Whitehead as a collector and contextualise his collecting in relation to the many Indian individuals that aided his collecting practices. Catalina too used the relational approach to unpack symbolic reparations and highlight overlooked parties involved in the development of the Museum of Memory of Colombia. Megan showed how gaps in the archive could be bridged in her research on the representations of Ananse, a prominent figure in Ashanti folklore, within museum collections through contemporary visual culture. This Afro/African-futurist lens provide an ‘against-the-grain’ reading of the colonial archive that currently dominates the way in which Ananse is understood within the museum context. These presentations offered alternative and creative ways to think through silences and absences that can often be encountered during research.\n\nWorking with institutional memory\n\nResearchers use a variety of sources, tangible to intangible, to piece together histories of institutions. However, presentations given by Mark Liebenrood and Jenny Durrant reminded me that institutions are made up of individuals, which seems like an obvious statement to make but sometimes working with archives can distance you from the very individuals that are a part of this history. Mark’s paper focused on developing an institutional history of the LYC Museum and Art Gallery in Cumbria, which was established by Li Yuan-chia (1929 - 1994), a Chinese artist, poet and curator in 1972. Using the LYC’s exhibition catalogues, all of which are unique in terms of the design and information they include within the pages, Mark posed the question if and how an institutional history could be composed using the catalogues as a source. For me, this presentation demonstrated that exhibition catalogues, uniform in style or not, can embody the knowledge and idiosyncrasies of the individuals involved in their creation. While Mark was working with a tangible archive, Jenny’s paper focused on her use of oral history in recording curatorial memory. Jenny, who had worked as a curator at the Royal Albert Memorial Museum in Exeter, reflected on her ‘insider’ status and the impact that has on creating an institutional history. Jenny’s thoughtful questioning on the ethics of using information gained through her insider status and trust from former colleagues is an issue that many researchers grapple with as they undertake collaborative research projects where the staff at institutions that we are studying are also colleagues and confidants.\n\nTracing histories through objects\n\nObjects can be tangible reminders of overlooked, unknown and unusual connections between people, institutions and places in the world, which was exemplified in the research being conducted by Viveca Mellegård and Tobias Gardner. Tobias Gardner work-in-progress paper traced the links between Sheffield and Atlantic slavery through plantation hoes and Bowie knives manufactured in Sheffield. Tobias explained Sheffield’s production of plantation hoes, which were used by enslaved peoples on plantations in the Americas, and Bowie knives engraved with pro-slavery inscriptions, complicate narratives that focus on Sheffield’s antislavery activism. Through his presentation, Tobias raised questions as to how this history can be made accessible to a wider public and reflected on the exhibition of plantation hoes and Bowie knives within museums spaces. At Kew's Economic Botany Collection, we were shown samples of Indigo and related material by Viveca, who is researching Kew’s collections of Indigofera tinctoria from India and its links with contemporary indigo production and dyeing in West Bengal. Viveca described the many sources from which indigo samples ended up in the Economic Botany Collection, and I was particularly surprised to find out that Coleman's (of Coleman's Mustard fame) produced indigo too! We only had time to see a small portion of the collection but what Viveca was able to show and explain to us in that time made us all want to come back to visit the Economic Botany Collection again.\n\nTechnical issues\n\nIt was a steep learning curve to deliver an online event of this scale, and we did not foresee the range and scale of the technical issues we would face. Access to equipment, software, and technical skills varied amongst our participants, and many required additional support. We responded by setting time aside to provide this support despite the fact that participants were in various time zones in different parts of the world. For some, a few emails back and forth sufficed, but others required short demonstrations via video. Unexpectedly, in providing such support, we developed a rapport with our participants, fostering great relationships and camaraderie despite the physical distance of an online event.\n\nLarge video files were downloaded and stored on an external hard drive, then uploaded to SharePoint, a secure web-based collaborative platform used by University of Brighton. Uploading the videos to SharePoint was a lengthy process as the platform would frequently crash due to the large multimedia files. Minor technical problems continued during the conference, the most critical issue was the sound dropping out or distorting during some videos. It is worth noting that distortion was caused by people splicing their videos before sending in. In some cases, this problem was remedied by reuploading the video to the site. For other videos we required the invaluable support and expertise of the university's IT support team.\n\nOutcome and impact\n\nMuseum Exhibition Design: Histories and Futures conference took place between September 1-11, 2020. Over 500 attendees and 58 presenters/speakers participated. Key themes that emerged from the conference papers included collaborative, multi-authored exhibitions, often from a decolonial and postcolonial perspective; the materiality of exhibition design that goes ‘beyond text’, focusing on labour and production processes; and methodological approaches to studying museum exhibition history. The aim is to develop these themes further in an edited volume.\n\nThe advantages of an online conference are many- it is low cost, carbon neutral, more accessible and inclusive. Inclusivity is worth a mentioning in more detail, we lost count of the number of times people thanked us for the opportunity to watch the presentations in their own time and at their own pace. Subtitles were provided through YouTube and text transcripts were available for those who requested. The conference provided other lessons too – above all, for presenters and organisers, the importance of learning digital skills and adapting to an online format. The website enabled us to include everything in one place, abstracts, participant information, reading lists, details of global research centres and archives. The disadvantages of online events can lead to a feeling of distance and isolation and in order to offset these factors, we developed opportunities for panellists and audience participants to come together as much as possible. We did this through a noticeboard and chat room functionality on the website, a finale of a live plenary discussion and encouraged engagement through social media. In post-conference evaluation below, attendees highlighted their experiences and offered suggestions for improvements:\n\n“Fantastic speakers, an accessible delivery model, a highly-engaged level of debate and, overall, an extremely well-organised event. It really set the bar for how online conferences can work. I will also really appreciate being able to draw on legacy resource in my teaching and practice in the future.”\n\n“I liked the more leisurely and on your own time way of viewing the presentations but missed the rigor of in-person and the chance to socialise and share in person…. Finding a way to have more synchronous attendee interaction would be good. However, I really like the virtual format because you could go back and re-watch presentations, and of course it cut out the sometimes challenging cost and time of travel.”\n\n“I really appreciated the moments when the conference was hyper local (based on speaker’s expertise, no matter what geographical region or museum type); when content supported or current moment’s politics of anti-racism and decolonization; when speakers and content moved beyond standard euro-U.S. stories.”\n\n“Watercooler/coffee bar moments and the ability to connect with speakers soon after their presentations were absent here. How might they be restored?”\n\n“Overall I thought this was a great conference that ran very smoothly and a helpful resource for ongoing research.”\n\nThe conference highlighted the importance of investing in technology and software and ensuring continuous training in IT for those wishing to engage in educational and public-facing events. With the help of our participants, we created an international research community for the duration of the conference and a much needed, useful, accessible and permanent resource on museum exhibition design histories.\n\nHajra Williams and Kate Guy\n\nUniversity of Brighton\n\nTo visit the conference website:\n\nhttps://musex-design.org\n\nCentre for Design History at the University of Brighton: https://www.brighton.ac.uk/cdh/index.aspx\n\nSir George Scharf (1820-1895) looms large in the history of the National Portrait Gallery. Appointed Secretary 1857 and then created Director in 1882, he was instrumental in the Gallery’s early development. Indeed, Trustees deemed him a model of ‘unflagging zeal and industry’. He was a trained artist, an enthusiastic antiquarian, and a meticulous record creator. The Gallery’s Archive holds a substantial collection of his papers and at their core are over two hundred volumes of pocket sketchbooks, densely populated with drawings, notes and references. A new digital resource draws on a discreet set of sketchbooks documenting Scharf’s work for the 1857 Art Treasures of Great Britain exhibition, prior to joining the Gallery. If your research intersects with old master artworks, private art collections, public exhibitions or social history of this era, please explore the digital offer at https://www.npg.org.uk/research/scharf-sketchbooks/\n\nScharf and the Art Treasures exhibition\n\nMGHG members are doubtless familiar with the famous Art Treasures exhibition. Staged in Manchester May-October 1857, it was a landmark in scale and approach to public art appreciation, using classification and chronological arrangement to promote understanding of successive periods and schools of art. Over 16,000 exhibits in diverse media drew more than 1.3 visitors to the specially constructed Art Treasures Pavillion at Old Trafford (fig. 1).\n\nScharf was Art Secretary to the exhibition. He also curated its Ancient Masters section, for which he sourced 1,200 loaned works. He secured these loans with characteristic diligence, visiting more than one hundred collections, and recorded his efforts in sketchbooks (fig. 2). In Scharf’s own words, he documented ‘an ideal gallery on paper, taking the choicest specimens of every master in the history of art, as far as I remembered their existence in this country.’ The data Scharf recorded for old master artworks in British private collections drew Dr Philip Cottrell of the School of Art History and Cultural Policy, University College Dublin, who recognized the sketchbooks’ immense research potential. Volumes analysed by the recent project are full of notes and images. Scharf recorded artworks and their environs during his rail-enabled travels to locations in England, Scotland and Wales. He also documented his visits to the finished exhibition, making studies of works on display and a number of ‘wall maps’ recording sections of the chronological hang (fig. 3).\n\nA new digital resource\n\nDr Cottrell led The George Scharf Manchester Art Treasures Sketchbooks project, funded by The Samuel H. Kress Foundation, The Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art, and The Thomas Dammann Junior Memorial Trust. Dr Cottrell and the National Portrait Gallery collaborated to deliver the recently launched online resource, and it is one Scharf would have found invaluable. He peppered his physical records with handwritten cross-references, attempting to achieve on paper something much more feasible in the digital age. Thanks to the project, digital images of sketchbook pages are available online alongside detailed database entries created by Dr Cottrell.

Entries draw together valuable information on provenance, the contents of Victorian private collections (many subsequently disbursed), and the present day location of artworks, where known.\n\nScharf and his papers at the National Portrait Gallery\n\nFor those curious about Scharf and his legacy, the digital resource also includes an introductory guide to his papers at the National Portrait Gallery Archive.\n\nAny who venture further will find his Art Treasures sketchbooks one thread of a far richer seam. Scharf’s artistic skill renders his sketchbooks particularly appealing. One discreet sequence contain sketches of his travels to sites in Asia Minor with the 1839-1844 archaeological expeditions of Sir Charles Fellows. The wider run of his personal sketchbooks initially reflect the development of his draughtsmanship, then navigate his time as a lecturer, researcher and teacher of art, and following his appointment at the National Portrait Gallery contents increasingly reflect his portrait research and surveys of art collections public and private. A separate sequence of Trustees’ sketchbooks document portraits offered to the Gallery for acquisition and collections Scharf surveyed in an official capacity. Contents throughout reflect Scharf’s lived experience. His renderings of artworks are interspersed with sketches of everyday scenes, architecture, and even dogs in fancy dress(!)\n\nBeyond his sketchbooks, Scharf’s meticulous approach to research, note taking and diary keeping offer much to historians of his era. His papers are a splendid resource for scholars of museum history, offering considerable insight into the early development of the National Portrait Gallery in particular. Known as ‘The Father of the Gallery’, Scharf oversaw diverse areas of activity as the institution grew, including visitor access and the development of research resources. He influenced the formation of the portrait Collection and established an institutional acquisition methodology rooted in portrait research, aspects of which still inform current practice. His contribution to the curatorial field has been the subject of recent study: Elizabeth Heath examined the advancement of his professional approach in her 2018 doctoral thesis ‘Sir George Scharf and the early National Portrait Gallery: reconstructing an intellectual and professional artistic world, 1857–1895’. This interrogated Scharf’s personal and professional networks, emphasizing his place in an emerging professionalization within the field, an approach combining rigorous, academic research with public service impulse. His institutional impact is evident in National Portrait Gallery’s Archive & Library. Scharf began all of the collections that specialist staff across curatorial, library and archive spheres maintain today. He laid the foundations of the institutional archive and established sequences of reference images, built up a working Library, and accumulated primary sources. These resources assisted him in his wide-ranging role and created an invaluable legacy for future staff and visitors to the Archive & Library.

Yet, there is no National Aviation (or Aerospace) Museum, despite several attempts to create one and Britain’s impressive record of aeronautical achievement. Sir Peter Masefield campaigned for such a museum in the 1950s. This blog post explores the background to this proposal and the reasons for its failure. These include an assumption that there was little demand for such a museum and the belief that the provision in two existing museums was adequate. A particularly important factor was government departments’ reluctance to fund a new museum.\n\nFor the first half of the 20th century, the Science Museum had collected aircraft and associated material as an emerging technology, whilst the Imperial War Museum regarded aircraft as a weapon. Individuals such as Richard Nash and Richard Shuttleworth had assembled their own collections of aircraft from the early days of British aviation. The Royal Air Force felt in the 1930s that the IWM’s remit – the First World War – was limiting its exposure to the public and tried, via the Air Ministry, to set up an Air Services museum, but first the Depression and then Britain’s rearmament programme meant that no funds were available.\n\nThe early 1950s brought concerns that elements of Britain’s aeronautical heritage might be lost, and that existing displays were inadequate. In 1953 an editorial in The Aeroplane called for improvements in the Science Museum’s aeronautics display. A further impetus came in January 1954, when the Royal Aeronautical Society (RAeS) announced that it had purchased the Nash Collection. Fears had been expressed that the collection might vanish overseas: in November 1953 Nash had received an offer ‘from America’. Nash had presumably approached the Shuttleworth Trust, since Air Commodore Allen Wheeler (a trustee) had written an article discussing the need for a national museum. This article brought a response from Nash, who explained that in addition to the 14 aircraft in his collection, built between 1908 and 1920, he might have been able to add another 16, had the necessary finance and storage space been available, but the 16 had been destroyed during the war.\n\nThe RAeS called a meeting in October 1954 to consider the creation of a National Aeronautical Collection of historical aircraft. Seventeen organisations attended included government departments, national museums, and various aviation groups. The meeting was chaired by Peter Masefield, whose long aviation career included acting as an adviser to the government on civil air transport, and board appointments at Bristol Aircraft and British European Airways. He was President of the RAeS from 1959-60. Masefield had already written to senior RAF officers, seeking their support for ‘the foundation of a National Aeronautical Collection on similar lines to the National Maritime Museum and Trust.’ The meeting agreed that some form of National Collection was desirable, and Masefield suggested that it could be located at Croydon airport or RAF Hendon. A working party was formed to carry the project forward.\n\nA report in November 1955 that an American museum was seeking to acquire British, German and French aircraft of the First World War brought a further call for a national aviation museum. It seems likely that the collector James H ‘Cole’ Palen was involved; it may have been Palen who tried to purchase the Nash Collection in 1953.\n\nThere was, however, little enthusiasm in the Ministry of Works for another museum. Officials were sceptical about the appeal of an aviation museum, since aviation had a relatively brief history. They were also concerned that the creation of ‘an air museum’ would encourage the Army to demand similar treatment, and feared that their funding would suffer. It was acknowledged, however, that Britain was ‘playing a leading part in aeronautics and it may be that eventually there ought to be some sort of museum of this kind.’ The Treasury was similarly unimpressed: one official wrote that the museum was unlikely to receive gifts ‘unless one regards as benefaction gifts by aeroplane manufacturers of old aeroplanes which they have been rather too shamefaced to scrap hitherto.’ He concluded ‘this project should be played long and killed – with kindness if possible.’ The National Air Museum project was eventually shelved when the Financial Secretary to the Treasury made it clear that the necessary financial backing would not be forthcoming, citing ‘pressure to spend considerably more on existing national institutions’ and that aviation was already represented in the IWM and Science Museum’s collections. The Air Ministry was content for the RAeS to draft lists of aircraft and engines that could form the national collection. The aircraft lists were eventually published in 1959; plaques would be presented to the owners of aircraft ‘considered to be of historic importance.’ During 1959 the Science Museum began planning its new aeronautical gallery; perhaps the seed planted by Masefield’s lobbying had taken root.\n\nThe RAeS list identified 185 specific aircraft – both British and foreign - worthy of preservation. Some were already in museums, but most were not. Nearly all of them have survived; a few were later sold overseas and others were scrapped, but some are still flying. The British Aviation Preservation Council (now Aviation Heritage UK), a group formed in 1967 to represent, coordinate and assist aviation museums, compiled its own register in the 1980s. It currently stands at over 2000 aircraft in the many museums that have sprung up since Masefield’s time. However, Masefield’s pioneering listing exercise, and his attempts to set up a national air museum have largely been forgotten.\n\nBy Philip W. Deans\n\nIntroduction\n\nOver September-November 2018 I undertook a placement at Imperial War Museums (IWM). This placement was generously supported by the Arts and Humanities Research Council via the Northern Bridge Doctoral Training Partnership scheme, which has overseen my doctoral studentship. During the placement, I assisted curators to develop an exhibition entitled Art in Exile looking at the IWM during the Second World War: the protection of its collection from aerial attack. This links directly with my own doctoral research on the broader history of the IWM over that period (see Deans 2017) and work for the UK National Committee of the Blue Shield. It also paralleled scholarship presented at the Museums and Galleries History Group’s 2018 summer conference Museums, Collections and Conflict, 1500-2010.\n\nDuring this conference, various institutional experiences of war were discussed. These included museum evacuation procedures such as at the Bologna Museum and the Louvre. The evacuations were often effective, or at the very least comprehensive. Over the two days, I was struck by how different the IWM’s evacuation experience was from those presented at the conference. This has motivated me to write about the IWM’s evacuation processes and problems. Decisions made on the spot, plus a conservative mindset on cultural value, caused an ineffective evacuation which had ramifications for the collection.\n\nThe Imperial War Museum prepares for war, 1933-1939\n\nAs the Second World War loomed, the United Kingdom took extra measures to safeguard its most vulnerable cultural property. The first meeting on the issue took place during 1933, not long after Germany withdrew from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference. The IWM participated from the outset along with other national museums across London. The impetus was the advances in air war during and following the last war. For the first time, the United Kingdom had come under threat by potential enemies operating from mainland Europe. As these threats increased and became clearer with the Spanish Civil War, the dangers posed to the United Kingdom crystallised. There seemed a realistic prospect that the country would suddenly and decisively be knocked out of any conflict with Germany. This fear became reflected in the IWM’s interwar evacuation plans. For example, from 1934, any evacuation was eventually anticipated to be needed with little or no notice, at night, under fire. Consequently, a decision had been taken to arm the museum’s staff with old trench clubs so they could fend off mob attacks on the evacuation lorries.\n\nPlans for the initial evacuation were driven by practical and ideological considerations. The IWM’s collection included many big, bulky or heavy objects which could not easily be evacuated, e.g. vehicles, aircraft and guns. But it also included more manoeuvrable collections, ranging from smaller objects of materiel, art, photographs, manuscripts, maps and books. The London Fire Brigade reports on aerial bomb damage from the previous war, for example, were unique. Even so, during preparations, there developed a view at the institution that its collection possessed little inherent cultural value compared with those held in the other older national institutions. Alongside more understandable issues concerning size, therefore, this inferiority complex limited the evacuation. Initial removals were thus restricted to oil paintings, watercolours – its modern art at the time comprised the largest and most important in the country – and photographs.\n\nThis evaluation sits problematically with the IWM’s foundation and early years. On opening, the institution aimed to sanctify the war dead of the British Empire. Its exhibits were treated as ‘sacred relics’ – objects comprising tangible remains of or links with a saint. Accordingly, the collection was seen as forming tangible connections to the war dead. Yet just nineteen years later, the same collection had begun being treated more like junk. The apparent willingness to jeopardise its collection brings the institution’s commitment towards that message into question. The move also shows the persistence of conventional schemes of value whereby fine art outweighs ephemera and social history material.\n\nThe evacuation, August 1939\n\nThe initial evacuation of the IWM was far less eventful than had been anticipated. In a pre-emptive move, all the national institutions closed at the Home Secretary’s orders on 23 August 1939. Besides, the knockout blow that had been feared never materialised. When the United Kingdom declared war against Nazi Germany on 3 September 1939, no bombs fell immediately. The evacuation took place over 24-25 August 1939. Three lorries provided by the Office of Works were despatched: two on the first day, three on the second. The IWM’s staff sorted the material that had been designated for evacuation in order of priority by three exits. This was planned with meticulous detail, facilitating rapid evacuation while ensuring staff could track where everything went. The lorries they received, however, were far bigger than anticipated. This led to the plans eventually being ignored when it was realised the job could be done faster by just filling each lorry to capacity rather than as per the evacuation schedule.\n\nWith loading complete, the lorries proceeded to prearranged refuges. These were three country houses spread out across south east England.\n\nThe refuges\n\nThe use of country houses became central to the IWM’s safeguarding plans from 1934. Over the years, various properties were identified. During 1939 these had been confirmed as Colworth House near Sharnbrook in Bedfordshire, owned by Henry Ludwig Mond, 2nd Barron Melchett; Penn House near Amersham in Buckinghamshire, owned by Francis Curzon, 5th Earl Howe; and Ramster Hall near Chiddingfold in Surrey, owned by Florence Priscilla Norman, Lady Norman. Country houses comprised the main refuge for the United Kingdom’s national collections, but were problematic. Although located away from strategic infrastructure, they nevertheless comprised unsafe places to store museum collections. Firstly, they were old. This meant it was difficult to maintain good environmental conditions in them. Their combination of design and materials caused fluctuating relative humidity and temperature, which can be detrimental for museum collections. Secondly, they were often still inhabited or kept in regular use, rendering them a fire risk. That many had been made of flammable material such as wood did not help in this regard. Thirdly, they were often difficult to reach and monitor, being far away from the museums which used them. And fourthly, while landlords willingly looked after so called ‘valuable’ material, the same could not be said for large or less aesthetic material.\n\nThe IWM experienced challenges at its refuges. Reflecting on their use after the conflict, the institution’s Director-General, Leslie Ripley Bradley, commented that they had been far from ideal situations. This is most clearly seen with the IWM’s experience at Penn House, near Sharnbrook in Bedfordshire. Penn House was originally owned by the 5th Earl Howe, a Trustee of the IWM since the 1920s. During 1934, the 5th Earl Howe promised Penn House to the museum in an emergency. But circumstances eventually problematised this arrangement. By 1939, responsibility for Penn House transferred over to his son, Edward Curzon, 6th Earl Howe, who served in the Royal Navy during the Second World War, thus frequently leaving the property unoccupied. Although the 6th Earl Howe honoured his father’s pledge, the environmental conditions at Penn House became unsuitable for the watercolours and drawings that had been deposited there. As a result, these were mostly reclaimed by mid-1940. Yet some fifty oil paintings remained in a separate garage on the estate. These included works by well-known artists, including John Singer Sargent and William Orpen. About ten were described as ‘large’ works, suggesting that Sargent’s famous oil painting, Gassed – ‘the jewel in the IWM’s crown’, one curator told me – may have been among them. But eventually even these needed removing after the 6th Earl Howe decided to lease out the property. The new tenant was a boys’ prep school, which used the garage for vehicles. Over several months, therefore, the oil paintings shared their refuge with working motorcars. The unacceptability of this was quickly realised by staff at the IWM, who arranged for their transferal to Ramster Hall during November 1940.\n\nImplications and further evacuations\n\nSuch was the unexpected size of the lorries sent by the Office of Works during the initial evacuation that the IWM’s staff considered extending the evacuation schedule, but decided against it. This would be a decision they may have come to regret. When the Blitz started on 7 September 1940, the IWM found itself at continuous risk. Located in central London near overt targets, the institution was far more vulnerable to air raids than other museums located around the more peaceful South Kensington area. Further evacuations thus became necessary.\n\nAlthough fortunately nobody was ever killed at the IWM during the Second World War, some material fell victim to bombing. On 31 January 1941, for example, the IWM’s Naval Gallery received a direct hit. Alongside the destruction of many expensive ship models and other material that had remained there, the museum lost the world’s last Short Seaplane – damaged beyond repair. Flown at the Battle of Jutland during the First World War, this specimen was the first aeroplane ever to participate in a Naval engagement.\n\nWith the Blitz underway and its building suffering damage, the IWM’s evacuation policy shifted to a reactive as-and-when-necessary approach. Some items were temporally accepted by other, more safely located institutions into their temporary care. Some were sent on tours around the country. And some were granted refuge in further country houses – this latter method being arranged commercially via the Office of Works. One of the last areas to be evacuated was the IWM’s library. It had long been intended that library material would remain for as long as possible at the institution. This is because the library was thought to be required for consultation by the general public and the state, which indeed became the case. Eventually, however, even this policy became unsustainable. Consequently, during June 1941, the library was evacuated to Barnstaple. With that, virtually everything which could be removed from the IWM’s building, had been removed.\n\nConcluding reflections\n\nThe IWM’s struggle with the principles and practices of evacuation during the Second World War sheds light on wider issues around cultural property protection. Its experience was far from universal. A combination of circumstances and conceptions produced an evacuation strategy that became highly conservative and not fit for purpose. In sum, the first problem was that not enough material had been removed from the IWM in the initial evacuation. This came at a cost in air raid damage, and meant the museum eventually necessitated further, more difficult and expensive evacuations once the war started biting. The second problem was the inadequacy of storage locations such as Penn House. Intolerable environmental conditions, brought about by the landlord’s absence, resulted in the refuge being abandoned after just one year. And the third problem was the institution’s hitherto inexplicable inferiority complex, which produced an initial evacuation schedule that conveyed a very specific schema of value. This goes against core museum philosophy today, and the decision making around it would prove costly both in the short and long term. Unfortunately, such schemas of value can still pervade the heritage sector today. This account shows the ramifications conceptions like these potentiate where they are tolerated.\n\nPhilip W.

By far the most comprehensive source is the two-part unpublished War History of the Imperial War Museum, 1933-1946 manuscript. This comprises an unpublished account, produced by the Director-General for a proposed volume of the official History of the Second World War civil series about the national museum and galleries, which never came to fruition. This is currently viewable at IWM’s reading room.\n\nFurther reading\n\nDeans, Philip W., ‘The Imperial War Museum Originally Opened As a Museum to End All Wars – That Didn’t Last Long’, The Conversation, 7 March 2017 <https://theconversation.com/the-imperial-war-museum-originally-opened-as-a-museum-to-end-all-wars-that-didnt-last-long-72679> [2 January 2019].\n\nGardiner, Juliet, Wartime: Britain, 1939-1945 (London: Headline Publishing, 2004).\n\nMcCamley, N.

For me, although this conference was over a year ago, it raises issues which are still valid and reveals some potential problems and opportunities for the group as it seeks to ‘promote the study of the history and theory of museums’. A key problem, or potential problem, was the very title of the conference which prompted the roundtable: the museum of NOW. Do museums, and museum studies as a discipline, have any interest in the past of museums, and should they? Museums in general do not devote a great deal of attention to investigating their own past despite the fact that they use it on an almost daily basis, working with accession numbers and indeed entire collections which were assembled sometimes considerable time ago, and often inhabiting buildings designed for earlier understandings of display. Of course, in most cases such a lack of interest in the past is a result of practical constraints, above all on curatorial time and energy; but is it also produced by a growing rhetoric (emanating from funding and governmental bodies, not museums themselves, I think) tending to equate change with progress and to reject a good deal of museums’ pasts as elitist? Graham Black has accused museums today of a certain ‘amnesia’ about what they were actually like in the past in order to throw into relief their current democratic, inclusive and useful credentials, but it can seem like an article of faith that museums are throwing off the outmoded practices of the past in order to be relevant to contemporary society.\n\nFor the roundtable, a number of academics and practitioners, and practitioner-academics, gave their thoughts on the value of studying museums’ history. I introduced the discussion with my own thoughts on the issue; as a historian not a museologist or curator, I see self-evident value in museum history as part of the cultural history of the period. But I don’t think the value stops there or that museum history doesn’t have value for museums now. Conal McCarthy, of Victoria University Wellington (NZ) spoke next, and highlighted what he felt was a problematic lack of knowledge among museum practitioners about museum history – he argued that they had no sense of their institutions as having a past which shaped their present, and that more emphasis on museum history in training programmes would allow professionals to understand how practices have evolved and are contingent. Bronwyn Labrum, of Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, was also concerned with what she described as the ‘amnesia’ of current museums, leading to a lack of awareness of the possibility of doing things differently. Provocatively, she suggested that museums today were more interested in bling buildings than in history of any sort.\n\nChris Whitehead, of Newcastle University, suggested rather that museums and galleries were worried that they might seem to be navel gazing if they investigated their own history; there was a perceived need to be forward-looking. Yet, he suggested, if we see museums as places (and, I would add, as communities), then they needed to be understood as coming into being historically. Alan Crookham, of the National Gallery, tackled an issue maybe more true for art galleries, that institutional history needed to be investigated to prevent the creation of hagiographies around important donors, founders and directors. He argued that reflection on institutional history could prevent a somewhat regressive attitude whereby the past acted as a ‘dead hand’. For him it was not just about paying attention to museum history, but about paying critical attention to it. Simon Knell, of Leicester University, was similarly interested not just in investigating museum history, but in investigating it for specific purposes – using it to counter reductionism and to enable or de-essentialise groups who had been excluded.\n\nOverall, then, there was a sense that if as a museum you know your own history, then you ‘know thyself’ in important ways. Such historical understanding, though, needs to be approached in the right way, and not just used to shore up existing attitudes. One comment on the session suggested that the point of museum history had not been nailed down – ‘it depends’. I’m pretty happy with this as the answer – I don’t think that history should have a preordained job to do with regard to museums and galleries; that way lies poor history and a failure to leave room for what we could know if we looked further. Although the same response suggested that it wasn’t enough to do museum history for the sake of it, I disagree – I’m happy to see some instrumental work which is focused on particular contemporary problems, but I think where there is the time and resource for ‘blue sky’ museum history research, it can reveal the full richness of a past which could help current institutions in ways we can’t yet imagine. But does the ‘luxury’ of such research mean only academics and large institutions can undertake it, and what does this mean for small institutions and their lively history of making do and managing with little?\n\nI presume as MGHG members you’re all already convinced of the value of museum history – but why? Where does it lie? Who or what are we doing it for? And is there a dichotomy between present-focused and antiquarian historical research in this area?\n\nDr Kate Hill, Chair of the Museums and Galleries History Group\n\nDaniel Mytens’ pendant portraits of Thomas Howard, 14th Earl of Arundel, 4th Earl of Surrey and 1st Earl of Norfolk, and Alathea, Countess of Arundel and Surrey (both c. 1618), frame the sitters in their (idealised) sculpture and portrait galleries at Arundel House in the Strand. Both Thomas and Alathea were prominent collectors and patrons of the arts, but Thomas has received the most scholarly attention to date. By kind permission of The National Portrait Gallery, London (NPG 5292 and NPG 5293)\n\nOur recent conference, Gendering Museum Histories, held on 7-8 September 2016, addressed the relationship between museums, galleries and gender from the eighteenth century to the present, and was superbly hosted by the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. This event attracted almost fifty delegates from around the world, and from a variety of backgrounds, including museum professionals, academics, early career scholars and students. Our sessions and roundtables were accompanied by eight poster presentations, a networking lunch for postgraduate students hosted by our new Postgraduate Officer, Phil Deans, and our Annual General Meeting attended by our members and President, Helen Rees Leahy. What follows is a brief recap of the event, and what stood out for me as both an organiser and a delegate.\n\nPlanning for the 2016 conference began in early December 2014, and the issue of gender arose as a subject which spoke immediately to the research interests of our Chair, Kate Hill, and Secretary, Sarah Longair, but which also had many subtle resonances across the wide variety of fields and disciplines pursued by our board members. Our conference would follow such notable events as the Space Invaders: Women Museum Leaders conference at the Imperial War Museum in March 2016 and the Inclusive Museum conference at the National Science Centre, Delhi, India, in August 2016, but would differ significantly from them by analysing the construction of gendered identities in museums and galleries from an historical perspective. We invited proposals which addressed the full spectrum of gender representation, and our speakers addressed issues of gender roles, identities and sexuality and their changing relationships to acts of representation, interpretation, (curatorial) knowledge construction, authorship, collecting, connoisseurship and performance.\n\nI was sorry to miss part of our first panel on women at the Pitt Rivers Museum 1884-1945, in which Alison Petch, Frances Larson and Jaanika Vider, chaired by Elizabeth Hallam, examined the gendered history of this richly-documented collection at a granular level, as well as the careers of a number of women who served as field collectors for the institution, including Beatrice Blackwood (1889-1975), Winifred Blackman (1872-1950) and Maria Czaplicka (1884-1921). I was, however, delighted to welcome our speakers and delegates at the reception desk on Day One, and was amply supplied with coffee by the generous Ashmolean staff. I completed my MA internship at the Ashmolean during its 2009 redevelopment, so it was wonderful to be back and see the displays without dust covers and Tyvek, and the objects I had helped install still in situ.\n\nParticular highlights of the conference for me included Ana Baeza Ruiz’s study of a young female stenographer who worked at the National Gallery between 1949-50 and who was dismissed on the grounds of her so-called emotional ‘invert’ – or, lesbian – nature. Ana’s presentation skilfully illuminated the constructed nature of the archive, an historical artefact in its own right, and how we risk uncritically reproducing the (gendered) logics of the archive in our own work. Similarly, Liz Mitchell’s presentation on Mary Greg’s (1850-1949) collection of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century ‘bygones’ – objects chosen by Mary to represent traditional crafts, as well as toys, clothing and domestic life – uncovered changing perceptions of value and worth within Manchester City Galleries, as well as the fact that many of the museum’s records pertaining to Mary (in contrast to those relating to her husband Thomas and his pottery collection) had later been ‘weeded’ (disposed of). The choice of wording suggests both an anomaly and an irritant within the institution, something it could not understand and consequently refused – initially – to engage with. While museums have limited resources, this is a powerful reminder that our conditions of worth are subject to a presentism which has the capacity to silence voices in the future as well as in the past.\n\nThis emerging theme of institutional memory and self-censorship was complemented by Martina D’Amato’s fascinating study of forgotten female collectors of Renaissance art during the Belle Epoque. By focussing on the careers of women such as Marie-Louise-Jeanne Peyrat, Marquise Arconati-Visconti (1840-1923), a philanthropist and collector of Renaissance art and furniture who engaged in acts of overt cultural performance and identity construction, photographing herself in male Renaissance attire against carefully staged backdrops and in a variety of poetic poses, Martina was able to reconstruct the important role these women played in what is now seen as a primarily male-dominated arena.\n\nAs an early modernist, I was strongly reminded of Alathea Howard (née Talbot), Countess of Arundel (c.1590 -1654), a collector, traveller and patron of the arts to whose activities less attention has been paid than those of her husband, Thomas Howard (1585-1646). It also calls to mind Isabella d’Este (1474-1539), Marchesa of Mantua – referenced by Martina as a model for the Marquise – a seminal female collector and patron who was described, astonishingly, by a V&A text panel in 2011 as ‘intellectual and snobbish’; something I have never been able to forget. Moreover, I spent the night in Oxford University’s Wadham College, founded in 1610 by a woman, Dorothy Wadham (1534/5 –1618), albeit in accordance with the wishes of her husband, yet women were not admitted to the college as full members at all levels for another 364 years (Wadham College 2016). Although Wadham was one of the first colleges to admit women, there is something rather poignant about the length of time it took for attitudes and conditions of worth to change, particularly in a building emblazoned and adorned with Dorothy’s image in paint, stone and stained glass.\n\nOne of our delegates, Hadwig Kraeutler, who also contributed an intriguing poster, In A Rough Voice. Alma S. Wittlin (1899-1992). A Case Study, noted the larger presence of women than men at the conference, and introduced us to the German concept of Leidensdruck – which loosely translates as the burden, or pressure, of suffering, which implies that it is only when this pressure becomes severe that we give it consideration and engage with it. Could this, she asked, be why more women than men attended the event, bearing in mind the same was true of Space Invaders?\n\nMark Carnall also raised the thorny question of male-female ratios in the museum workforce, and in museum studies programmes. However, as the recent Incluseum blog post notes, we need to distinguish between equality and equity. The mere profusion of one gender in a single field of practice does not amount to equity. Moreover, ‘the field needs to stop using “gender” as a synonym for “women” and “gender equality” as a synonym for “equality between men and women.”’ As Sonya O. Rose observes in her 2010 book What is Gender History?, ‘Often […] gender has been interpreted as meaning “women”, as if “men” were not gendered beings’. The social construction of gender throughout history has been one of the core means by which power relations have been represented, and justified (Scott 1999; Cott and Faust 2005). As such, gender can be understood as a fluid process as well as a state or category of being, which is performed in a cultural setting (Wharton 2012: 9).\n\nMuseums and galleries play a critical role in negotiating power relations and the construction of identities. Fiona McGovern’s examination of the display of art by lesbian, gay and transsexual artists from the 1970s to the present highlighted the challenges of curating art shows which aim to engage with and showcase the work of minority groups. For many artists, this has meant a public coming out, and the risk of being placed into a curatorial black box, rather than allowing their work to speak for itself. Furthermore, McGovern asks whether such shows are truly representative of minority groups within these minority populations, which has implications for the practice of gender mainstreaming – the assessment of the implications of a policy action or programme upon different gender groups.\n\nOur keynote speaker, Merete Ispen, Director of the Women’s Museum in Denmark, delivered a truly powerful presentation on the challenges of presenting exhibitions on challenging and traumatic subjects such as rape, but also dispelled the myth that boys and men are not welcome or represented in the Museum. Rather, as Ipsen argues, their presence is essential, for how can we talk about girls without boys, or women without men? I would argue that one of the reasons for this museum’s continued success is its ability to define the nuances of gender in broad terms which supports both its core mission and inclusive ethos.\n\nAt the 31st General Assembly of the International Council of Museums (ICOM) in Milan in 2016, a second resolution was adopted pertaining to ‘Inclusion, Intersectionality and Gender Mainstreaming in Museums’. In the light of recent developments in the museum sector, in particular a number of calls to arms to tackle gender equality (Khan 2016), as well as political events around the world, our understanding of the social construction of gender and how museums have engaged with this issue in past eras and in the present would seem to be more relevant than ever, with Guardian journalist Paul Mason citing the outcome of the US presidential election as a triumph for sexism as well as racism. It is clear there is more work to be done, and it’s not just about battling discrimination against women. It’s about how we represent ourselves to ourselves, who we choose to give a voice to, what we choose to censor and recognising how the mechanisms by which we achieve all this – consciously or unconsciously – always privilege one set of values over another. In this struggle we must become more aware of our history than ever, so let’s keep this important conversation (and its historical mythbusting) going!\n\nWith many thanks to Kate Hill, Sarah Longair and the entire MGHG conference team, all our wonderful speakers and delegates, and the staff of the Ashmolean Museum for making this event such a success.\n\nFirst they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—\n\nBecause I was not a Socialist.\n\nThen they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out—\n\nBecause I was not a Trade Unionist.\n\nThen they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—\n\nBecause I was not a Jew.\n\nThen they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.\n\nMartin Niemöller (1892–1984)\n\nReferences\n\nCott, Nancy F, and Faust, Drew Gilpin, ‘Recent Directions in Gender and Women’s History’, in OAH Magazine of History 19.2, (2005), 4-5\n\nICOM, ‘Resolutions adopted by ICOM’s General Assemblies, 1946 - to date’, Milan 2016, http://icom.museum/the-governance/general-assembly/resolutions-adopted-by-icoms-general-assemblies-1946-to-date/milan-2016/ [accessed 10 November 2016]\n\nKhan, Yasmin, ‘Museums must dust off old ways and address gender equality in leadership’, The Guardian, 1 April 2016, https://www.theguardian.com/culture-professionals-network/2016/apr/01/museums-gender-equality-leadership [accessed 11 November 2016]\n\nMason, Paul, ‘Globalisation is dead, and white supremacy has triumphed’, The Guardian, 9 November 2016, https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/09/globalisation-dead-white-supremacy-trump-neoliberal [accessed 10 November 2016]\n\nRose, Sonya O., What is Gender History?
