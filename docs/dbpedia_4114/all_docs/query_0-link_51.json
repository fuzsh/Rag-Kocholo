        "text": "Paul Dryburgh, Chair of Trustees\n\nA Yellerbelly (for the uninitiated I am from Lincolnshire), I have spent most of my working life with archives and bringing some of the country’s most important pre-modern collections to life. I completed my doctoral thesis entitled ‘The career of Roger Mortimer, 1st earl of March (c. 1287-1330)’, at the University of Bristol in 2002. My postdoctoral work on research council-funded projects at, respectively, the universities of Bristol, Reading and King’s College London resulted in a handbook to records relating to medieval Ireland at The National Archives (UK), publications on the medieval wool trade in England around 1300, and an edition, both online and in print, of the Fine Rolls of the Reign of King Henry III (www.frh3.org.uk). I have therefore ranged across the full chronological span of government records in the medieval period and developed a strong research interest in the structure and operation of English ‘colonial’ administration in the Middle Ages. I also have a rather puritanical interest in editing records for publication and indexing, being one of the Joint General Editors of the Pipe Roll Society (with Professor Louise Wilkinson).\n\nI qualified as an archivist at the University of Aberystwyth in 2014, having volunteered first at Lincolnshire Archives and then worked professionally from 2011 as the Access Archivist and Medieval Records Specialist at the Borthwick Institute, University of York. In York, I was responsible for managing access to the collections – engaging new and current audiences within the university and across Yorkshire, sorting and cataloguing new accessions, notably the archive of the playwright Sir Alan Ayckbourn, and devising new access initiatives. I also immersed myself in medieval and more modern records of provincial, diocesan and parish government in the North. I was one of a team behind the York Archbishops’ Registers project (archbishopsregisters.york.ac.uk), which aims to conserve, digitise and index the registers of the pre-modern archbishops.\n\nIn 2014, I moved to TNA where I am now Principal Records Specialist (Medieval Records). I am part of a small team within the Collections Expertise and Engagement Department tasked with researching our medieval collections, leading on cataloguing projects, liaising with volunteers, managing research students on placements, devising and delivering student training, and engaging new audiences with our pre-modern collections, amongst a varied and ever-changing set of responsibilities alongside the main duties involved in advising researchers.\n\nSince 2009 I have been Honorary Secretary for the Lincoln Record Society, one of the country’s leading local record publishing societies, where I have been fortunate to work with some of the most knowledgeable and passionate scholars on a vast array of projects, publications and events. In that year, I was also approached to be one of the Honorary Presidents of the newly-formed Mortimer History Society, which aims to study the medieval Mortimer families and the Marches of Wales.\n\nElection as a trustee of the BALH is therefore a particular honour for me. The BALH represents the very best of scholarship combined with a mission to bring local history to as wide an audience as possible across Britain. These are ambitions to which I aspire, even if I am not always successful in realising them! As a new trustee, I naturally hope to work with colleagues in several academic and professional fields to bring the archival riches of this country to new audiences in innovative and hopefully inspiring ways.\n\nPaul Dryburgh, Chair of Trustees, BALH"
