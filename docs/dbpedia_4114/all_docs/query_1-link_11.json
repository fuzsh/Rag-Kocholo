        "text": "The Gold Medal (Welsh: Medal Aur) of the National Eisteddfod of Wales is awarded annually in three categories for excellence in Fine Art, Architecture, or Craft and Design.[1]\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nThe National Eisteddfod of Wales is Wales' most important national cultural event, taking place annually. Its open exhibition of art and craft, Y Lle Celf (Welsh: 'The Art Space') is one of the highlights of the Welsh arts calendar.[2] Gold medals are awarded in the Visual Arts section for outstanding contributions in different media: a gold medal for fine art has been awarded since 1951;[3] a medal for Architecture has been offered since 1954 (though withheld and not awarded between 1954 and 1959);[4] and a gold medal for craft and design has been awarded since 1985.[5]\n\nOther awards are the Tony Goble Award, given to a first time exhibitor, and the Josef Herman Award, chosen by the public[6] (Josef Herman, a Polish emigree, won the Fine Art medal in 1962).[7]\n\nThe Architecture award was endowed by Thomas Alwyn Lloyd and is given in conjunction with the Design Commission for Wales and the Royal Society of Architects in Wales, who advise the Eisteddfod judges.[1]\n\nThe award is given to practitioners working in Wales, and a language rule has been in force since 1950 that any original words in art works must be in the Welsh language.[8] In 2013 there was controversy when a video entirely in English by England-born University of Wales Newport student Josephine Sowden was awarded the Fine Art medal.[9][10]\n\nIn January 2014 the Wales Millennium Centre (WMC) and Craft in the Bay, Cardiff held an exhibition showcasing the work of previous winners of the Fine Art and the Craft awards.[2]\n\nThe 2014 Open Exhibition exhibited the work of 44 artists, selected from 300 entries.[6]\n\nWinners\n\n[edit]\n\nFine Art\n\n[edit]\n\nSource: The National Eisteddfod of Wales\n\nArchitecture\n\n[edit]\n\n2024 – Claire Priest and Ben Crawley, Studio Brassica, for a stable block conversion near Raglan.[17]\n\n2023 – Nidus Architects and Rural Office, for their extension of a 17-century Welsh longhouse Pen-y-common near Hay-on-Wye [18]\n\n2022 – Sonia Cunningham, for her research project, the Bee Monastry, and a design for a school at Llanidloes.[12]\n\n2019 – Featherstone Young, London, for Tŷ Pawb, Wrexham[19]\n\n2018 – KKE Architects, Worcester, for their work on St Davids Hospice Care in Newport[19]\n\n2017 – Stride Treglown, for Ysgol Bae Baglan, Port Talbot[19]\n\n2016 – Hall & Bednarczyk, for the Visitor and Water Sports Centre, Llandegfedd[19]\n\n2015 – Loyn & Co, for Millbrook House, in Lisvane, Cardiff.
