Meet characters from London Undergroundâ€™s history, pick up a souvenir leaflet, enjoy a busker performance, and shop for transport collectibles at a special pop-up stall run by the London Transport Museum Friends. This special event will coincide with the popular annual Amersham Heritage Day to be held in Amersham town on Sunday 8 September 2024.\n\nMore details coming soon.\n\nThe 1938 Stock was the first kind of Tube train to have all of the electrical equipment underneath the floor, combining the latest technology of the era with quintessential late 1930s style.\n\nThese trains served London, on several deep-level Tube lines, for half a century. The beautifully restored electrified train is made up of four cars complete with green and red moquette seating, grab handles and distinctive Art Deco light fittings."
