        "text": "Visit our great little award-winning Museum, situated in the Buckinghamshire village where Roald Dahl lived and wrote for 36 years.\n\nThe Museum, aimed at 6 to 12 year olds, features three interactive galleries. Boy gallery looks at Roald Dahl's school days while Solo gallery houses his original Writing Hut. The Story Centre puts your imagination centre-stage with fantabulous activities to inspire the writer in you.\n\nThe Roald Dahl Museum and Story Centre has three fun and fact-packed galleries. Throughout the Museum you will find a mix of objects and archive material to look at, things to watch and to listen to, as well as interactive activities to help you learn more about the stories behind the stories.\n\nBoy gallery\n\nHere you will find out about Roald Dahl's childhood, his love of chocolate and his schoolboy pranks. Visitors can explore the archive on a touch-screen, rummage through Roald Dahl's family photos, find the mouse in the gobstopper jar and smell the giant chocolate doors.\n\nSolo gallery\n\nBeginning with his journey to Africa, the visitor is shown how Roald Dahl's real-life adventures led him to become a writer, working from a small hut in Great Missenden. Visitors will experience the unique atmosphere of Roald Dahl's original Writing Hut and marvel at his collection of quirky mementos. There are secrets and surprises in peep-holes and drawers, a Gladiator cockpit where you can find out about Roald Dahl's RAF experiences and a Sparkometer which will test your sparkiness.\n\nThe Story Centre\n\nThis is the Museum's creative hub where the displays will inspire your own writing and story-making. Listen to top tips from your favourite authors, make a stop-frame animation, sit in a replica of Roald Dahl's writing chair, create a character or a gobblefunk word. Head to George's Crafty Kitchen for drop-in crafts, colouring, and lots of creative activities.\n\nFor a peek inside the Museum take a look at our virtual tour.\n\nWhat do you get when you visit us?\n\nAs well as having a phizz-whizzingly inspirational time, every child over five who visits receives a Story Ideas Book, just like Roald Dahl's, to scribble their ideas in as they explore the Museum. Free visitor guide books are also available to help everyone get the most from their visit.\n\nExhibitions and events\n\nWe don't have anything to show you here.\n\nEducational programs\n\nWe don't have anything to show you here."
