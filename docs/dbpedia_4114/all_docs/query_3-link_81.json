        "text": "Figure 1: Antonio Reynoso. Untitled, Texcoco, 1966.\n\nThis is the story of an astonishing proposal, a 1960s technological fix that, it was said, save Mexico City from collapse, provide fresh water to its inhabitants, and all through the implementation of nuclear power. It became the subject of intense and competitive diplomacy.\n\nThe scheme, known as the Texcoco project, was pitched to the UK Atomic Energy Authority in February 1965. Dr Arnulfo Morales-Amado, of the Mexican Comision Nacional Energia Nuclear (CNEN) introduced the issues:\n\nMexico City stood in a valley surrounded by mountains which was geologically an independent basin. Approximately 160 million gallons of water per day were being pumped out of the water lying beneath the city to supply its needs and as a consequence the city had been sinking about one foot a year for thirty years. In these circumstances the cost of maintaining the sewers and other plant and equipment was considerable.\n\nThere was, however, a second basin formation some 30 kilometres from Mexico City at Texcoco which, in view of the sinking of the Mexico City basin was now higher than the latter. There was therefore a danger that if an earthquake were to result in the two basins becoming joined, Mexico City would be flooded. For this reason the Texcoco basin had been dried out which, in view of the prevailing winds, had led to dust storms blowing over Mexico City. Moreover, the development of industry from the city towards Texcoco basin had had to be stopped.[1]\n\nThe inhabitants and industry of Mexico City used 320 million gallons per day, about half of which was purified and used again for agriculture, so usage was about 160 million gallons per day. This water was extracted from under the inhabitants’ feet. In Mexico City £10 million a year was spent on work necessitated by subsidence. The sinking of wells had been prohibited, and industrial development ‘was held up by reason of water shortage…. If the water problems could be solved, industrial development near Mexico City need no longer be held up’[2]\n\nThe CNEN’s proposal was\n\nto meet these problems by the construction of a 500 MW(E) reactor which would provide power but would be primarily designed to enable water from the Texcoco basin to be desalted and piped to Mexico City. …. If successfully completed this operation would result in the sinking of the Texcoco basin as the water was drawn away and would enable water to be pumped back into the sub-strata of Mexico City. The later would therefore stop sinking, with a saving in maintenance costs, and the flood danger be obviated’[3] To put this in perspective, the total generating capacity of Mexico was 5,000MW(E), of which 2,000 MW(E) connected to the grid around the capital. [4]\n\nThis was the astonishing technocratic Mexican vision of hydrological, geological and environmental engineering through nuclear power and desalination. While presented in London by Morales-Amado, it was largely the work of Dr Nabor Carrillo Flores. Carrillo is a fascinating figure. The brief biography, sent by telegram to the leading scientist of the UK nuclear weapons programme, and passed around Whitehall, captures his character succinctly:\n\nDr Nabor Carillo\n\nIs the main driving force in the Commission. He is a man of great energy and enthusiasm. He won international fame as a soil scientist. Following his pioneering work in saving buildings, and designing foundations for new buildings in Mexico City, where the ground is sinking up to 1 ft/year, he is now consulted on similar problems around the world.\n\nHe comes from a remarkable family. He is of true Indian descent. His father is a well known composer who used a 16 tone scale many years before Schoenberg; his brother is the Mexican ambassador to Washington; his sister is a concern pianist, and he himself was rector of Mexico university for six years. He is a man of great charm, wide interests and very cultured. His outside interests are painting (he is a creditable painter himself, and was a personal friend of the late Diego Riviera), and music.\n\nThe revival (after a false start) of plans to establish atomic energy in Mexico is due to him.[5]\n\nCarillo was a modernist and a technocrat.[6] The alternative to the Texcoco project, to pipe fresh water 150 kilometers from a river supply, would also, of course, have required energy, but it did not possess the sheen of atomic modernity; it lacked, in Gabrielle Hecht’s term, “nuclearity”.[7]\n\nFigure 2: Dr Nabor Carrillo Flores by Juan O’Gorman, 1960s (Source: Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Nucleares). Figure 3: detail of painting, Carrillo is described at the ‘Autor del Proyecto Texcoco’)\n\nContext\n\nThe context was a Mexican political system that had been under the firm grip of the Institutional Revolutionary Party since its foundation, under a different name, in 1929. At its head was the dictatorial President of the Republic. Under Miguel Alemán (1946-1952), policies shifted rightwards, state-guided industrialization accelerated, financed largely through US capital.[8] Through into the 1960s, multiple initiatives for massive infrastructure span out from the political centre: new railways, new superhighways, enormous hydroelectric dams, a Metro for Mexico City, and tourist resorts (first Acapulco, later Cancun) with airports. The economy of the “Mexican miracle” grew at up to 6% per year. But prosperity was by no means evenly shared. Rural poverty was devastating, and Mexicans who chose to move to the sprawling capital city, driving its population from 3 million in 1950 to nearly 9 million in 1970, struggled to find work and adequate housing.\n\nNuclear power appealed to this large-scale, infrastructural, technocratic, state-led style of industrial modernization. In 1955-6, under President Adolfo Ruiz Cortines (1952-1958), as civil nuclear power stations opened in the United States, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, Mexico’s Comision Nacional Energia Nuclear (CNEN) was established. The commission’s activities were at an appropriate scale: encouraging education and training in nuclear physics and engineering, uranium prospecting, researching applications for radioisotopes, and so on. An institute for nuclear research was announced in 1963, near Salazar, west of Mexico City, and it housed an accelerator and planned to run a small Geneal Atomics Triga Mark III research and training reactor, with uranium fuel sourced from the United States via the International Atomic Energy Agency.[9] American nuclear feet were already on the ground.\n\nSmall-scale research reactors were one thing. Large scale nuclear power stations were another thing entirely. Both the United States and the United Kingdom had built power stations, on the back of military programmes, and foresaw an emerging and lucrative global market opening up as the world chose the modern and mighty atom for its electrical power.\n\nBetween 1957 and 1960 tantalising rumours of Mexico entering the marketplace as a purchaser of nuclear power stations circulated.[10] Then, in 1960, ‘all these phantoms were swept away’:\n\nThe Commission [CNEN] in a discussion with members of the [British] Embassy staff … said that there was absolutely no chance then of the Mexicans purchasing a nuclear power station. Their sources of cheap power were still largely unexploited, generation of electricity by hydro-electric means could be multiplied seven times, and production of oil almost as much … Mexico’s real need was for scientists trained in nuclear techniques to enable the Government to undertake an unpretentious but solidly based nuclear programme some time in the next decade.[11]\n\nThe UK responds to the Texcoco project pitch\n\nDespite this sweeping away of phantoms, atomic relations between the UK and Mexico grew. In 1959 a visit by Licenciado José Ortiz Tirado, who had moved from being once President of the Supreme Court of Mexico to be President of CNEN, to the Calder Hall power station in September 1959, had been covered approvingly by the Mexican press. Mexican scientists had attended UKAEA schools for nuclear education, and the Morales-Amado visit, at which the Texcoco project pitch had first been made, was in the context of CNEN wanting to send more staff on attachment for training on the commercially sensitive methods of isotope production at Amersham, Wantage and Harwell, just as they did to Canada, Karlsruhe and Oak Ridge. Mexican scientists at CNEN and those at universities received and read the UKAEA publication Atom. Carrillo had visited in autumn 1964, and established, it was noted in the Foreign Office, ‘good relationships’. UKAEA scientists travelled to Mexico on fact-finding missions.[12] When the nuclear centre at Salazar was being kitted out, British companies, such as Fairey Engineering and Nuclear Chemical Plant Limited, touted their wares.[13] There seems ‘little doubt’, reported the British Embassy in Mexico City, ‘that the Mexican Government is determined to build up a nuclear industry as rapidly as they can [and[ there should be very good opportunities for British firms in this country’.[14]\n\nBut the scale and vision of the Texcoco project were something else altogether. There were also time constraints, caused by the political character of big infrastructural projects in Mexico. The project would have to be completed ‘in the present Mexican President [Gustavo Diaz Ordaz]’s six year term of office’, in other words by December 1970. This short timescale meant that off-the-peg reactor designs were the only ones the UK could offer. However, if the project was financed by international assistance, probably by borrowing from the World Bank, this in turn would create delays, since it was likely that a lengthy tendering process would be imposed. [15] So there was room, opportunity even, for financial alternatives.\n\nThe UK suggest going in stages, starting with a Magnox, which could provide 300 MW(E) costing £30m and between £9-30million for the desalination plant. A larger 500MW(E) reactor would cost about £45m, and could be either a larger Magnox or the new AGR design. Magnox was the first generation of UK reactors for power stations, based on the Calder Hall model opened in 1956. They were proven but already looking relatively primitive. Advanced Gas-cooled Reactors (AGRs) were the new, expensive design touted by the UK. The announcement of Dungeness B, the first AGR, was made and trumpeted in 1965, perhaps not least with a view for possible export sales. ‘Like you we were greatly impressed by the announcement about the Dungeness B Station and its implications for elsewhere’, wrote a Ministry of Overseas Development civil servant, adding ‘I have no doubt that the Mexicans will be made aware of the news and the reasons for the decision’.[16]\n\nThe desalination plant would be provided by Weir Westgarth, an innovative Glasgow firm that had built a business around Heriot-Watt university professor Robert Silver’s invention of the multi-stage flash desalination method.[17] Weir Westgarth had built the largest desalination in operation anywhere in the world in 1964 (in the Dutch East Indies, producing one and a half million gallons of fresh water per day).[18] Weir Westgarth also pitched for a desalination scheme in Tijuana, which used thermal energy power.[19] It’s main competitor was the American firm Westinghouse.[20]\n\nThe next steps suggested by the UK was a team visit by members of the UKAEA Reactor Group plus industry representatives, and to do a feasibility study. Weir Westgarth, would also need 6 months for a feasibility study for the desalination plant. There should also be a survey of Texcoco. When the question of whether an International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) survey would be acceptable was answered in the negative in London, since it would be done by Americans, and however ‘unbiased they pretend to be their report would be unlikely to favour the UK’.[21]\n\nNuclear diplomacy\n\nOn the face of it, Mexico would seem remote from UK diplomatic interests, or as a country that might look to Britain for technical assistance. But, in the long memory of the Foreign Office it was recalled that in the 1890s, when Mexico City was expanding, the lake receding, and the city was already liable to very severe flooding, the English engineer Weetman Dickinson Pearson had built the Grand Canal ‘which … afforded relief for decades’. Pearson, later ennobled as Lord Cowdray had been the Liberal MP for Colchester (known as the ‘Member for Mexico’) and had been invited by President Porfirio Diaz to build a Mexican railway, and, while doing so, had discovered Mexican oil (the Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company was later merged into Royal Dutch-Shell) [22] Perhaps Mexican memories were also long.\n\n‘The Mexicans appear genuinely interested in close nuclear collaboration with us & I assume it wd be v. profitable to us to encourage this interest’, noted the Foreign Office, adding a warning: ‘I also assume that the Mexicans are under constant US pressure to adopt American reactor systems & desalination plant’.[23] ‘The Mexicans are, no doubt, turning to us’, he thought, because:\n\n(i) they recognize that we have some expertise to offer and\n\n(ii) they welcome the opportunity, when it presents itself, of dealing with someone other than the Americans.\n\nWhether this will turn out to be very profitable for us it is difficult to say, but if the President puts his shoulder behind the project … we could conceivably find ourselves in on the ground floor’.[24]\n\nNotes circulated between the UKAEA, the Foreign Office, the Overseas Development Ministry, and the British Embassy in Mexico City.\n\nAware that the Americans had ‘embarked on an intensive sales campaign to obtain responsibility for the survey and eventual contract’, Carrillo asked the British Embassy in confidence for ‘a UK team to go out before March 22nd [1965] for some other ostensible reason but in fact to provide realistic and convincing background information on a possible UK imported reactor and desalination plant for [the Mexican] Minister of Finance’.[25] Two UKAEA scientists, Dr Hans Kronberger and F.M. Greenless were dispatched.\n\nIn April 1965 Dr Nabor Carrillo and his CNEN team visited London, meeting with the leading politician Barbara Castle. (the Parliamentary Secretary of the Overseas Development Ministry), as well as civil servants; Castle also had a private conversation with Edmund de Rothschild.[26]\n\nDe Rothschild’s presence marked the entry of French interests into the diplomatic competition over Texcoco. The suggestion of UK-France cooperation originated from Dr Bertrand Goldschmidt of the French atomic agency[27], and was brokered, via the Paris-based Baron Guy de Rothschild, by Goldschmidt’s brother-in-law Edmund de Rothschild, who worked at N M Rothschild & Sons in London.[28] Guy de Rothschild thought that the project ‘could only be financed by an international consortium’, and proposed a meeting of ‘British and French industrial and financial interests to explore the desirability of co-operation’.[29] Edmund relayed this message.\n\nThe Ministry of Technology, the UKAEA and the Board of Trade were unanimous that the UK ‘should firmly decline this offer’, for several reasons.[30] Unlike the supersonic Concord aircraft project, which was a development package in which both countries would learn from cooperation to mutual advantage, Texcoco presented the possibility of a ‘straight off-the-peg sale’. Second, these UK bodies thought ‘cooperation was technically nonsensical’ since the choice was either a British design (AGR being favoured) or French. It was thought the Mexicans, and Carrillo specifically, preferred the more advanced British design. Finally, a lot more than the initial sale income was at stake, indeed it might be strategically critical for an industrial commercial sector that was expected to grow in the atomic age:\n\nthe chance of securing the contract for this reactor (which would bring us in about £15 million) gave us the chance of beating the Americans to the first large reactor in a developing country. This would be a major breakthrough for our nuclear industry and could well lead to further orders in this vast potential market\n\nNevertheless, privately, the Foreign Office took a different view of cooperation with the French, one based on a perhaps more realistic, long-term assessment of the nation’s strengths in an emerging international market for nuclear power: ‘if you believe – as I do, but fear that [UK]AEA do not – that we shall only be able to hold our own in the long term against US competition in these fields if we broaden our base by cooperating with Europe in them, then it is at least arguable that the time to do so is now, when our acknowledged lead over other European countries should enable us to devise a system in which we retained the lion’s share’.[31]\n\nPresident Gustavo Diaz Ordaz had confirmed that nuclear matters were the responsibility of the Mexican Ministry of Finance. The Mexican view was clearly that having an alternative to any American offer was useful for their negotiations with their northern neighbour. It mattered less whether it was British or French. Or indeed it could be both. The Foreign Office explained to Rothschild that the UK saw no advantage in cooperation, but might pursue it if the ‘Mexicans wish to “internationalise” their project’.[32] However, from the Mexican perspective there was no overriding reason to involve the French, since any non-US alternative sufficed.\n\nCarrillo initially expressed clear preference for the UK option. But the Mexican decision was certainly not Carrillo’s alone. The Ministry of Finance had responsibility and, ultimately, nothing big happened in the Mexican political system without presidential approval. Some of these worries were aired within the Foreign Office:\n\nif Presidential approval for it is forthcoming, then Carrillo would be happy enough to award the major contract to the United Kingdom. There are however many ifs. We are by no means convinced that an independent survey will support Carrillo’s solution, particularly since no one knows to what extent [the waters of] Texcoco Basin really are saline. We still do not know whether Carrillo will succeed in persuading other and more influential members of the Mexican Government of the necessity of a nuclear solution; and we fear that if a nuclear solution is adopted the US offer a reactor on gift terms will prove impossible to resist.[33]\n\nSmall nuclear research reactors had been part of US diplomacy since Eisenhower’s Atoms for Peace. Large reactors for nuclear power might too be “gifted” if long-term interests, not least commercial interests, were served.\n\nThe Mexican government engaged a team of Mexican and American experts for a hydrological survey of Texcoco, including within it the leading Harvard soil mechanician Arthur Casagrande, and his brother Leo. Carrillo was allocated US$1 million for the survey.[34] The inclusion of the US experts was concerning for London, not least because the hydrological survey might ‘prove to be the first link in the chain of any project finally agreed for a reactor and desalination plant’.[35] But it was also noted that Carrillo had completed his PhD at Harvard and knew the Casagrandes well.\n\nIn the UK, Mexican ministers, government civil engineers and officials were wined, dined and given presentations through 1965, including a lunch given by Lord Snow (C.P. Snow, a minister in Harold Wilson’s Ministry of Technology) to discuss desalination. Meanwhile, UK atomic scientists, representatives of UK nuclear power station consortia, visited Mexico.[36]\n\nNevertheless, by September it was becoming clear to London that there were reasons to be worried. The Mexico City newspaper Excelsior reported an interview with Stewart Udall, the US Secretary of the Interior, in Tokyo. Udall, said the IAEA, at the request of the Mexican government had completed studies of a joint US-Mexican nuclear and desalination project. While not identifying the location explicitly, Udall was reported ‘to have mentioned that the US Government were informed about the problem of soil subsidence in Mexico City… [and] that a project to increase Mexico City’s water supplies could be subject of co-operation between the US and Mexico’.[37] While it seems Udall was talking about the Tijuana desalination – which actually increased Europeans’ chances, since European involvement in Texcoco would offset the American deal[38] – the scheme officials were right to worried.\n\nA week of discussions in the fringes of a Desalination Symposium allowed time for an extensive conversation with the Mexican team. Present alongside the Mexicans and the Whitehall civil servants were Edmund de Rothschild, UKAEA scientists, Professor Silver, representatives of Weir Westgarth, and UK diplomats. As was reported by a British Embassy in Washington diplomat to a counterpart in the British Embassy in Mexico City, this conversation caused alarm bells to ring. It is worth quoting at length for what it reveals about different cultural expectations, the scale of the project, and the high stakes involved:\n\nOur main object has been to try and discover whether this enormous project is only a pipe-dream of Carrillo’s or if there really is a likelihood that it will come off; and if so whether there is a role for the United Kingdom. I am not entirely confident of the answer to either question. Nothing is more difficult to read than the Mexican mind when not only technical considerations but foreign and internal politics are also involved. …\n\nFrom our discussions on all this it was clear that Carrillo has until now greatly underestimated the immense complexity of a scheme of this kind, which would, if undertaken in its entirety, be the biggest in the world, and would pose problems that would tax the ingenuity of the world’s most sophisticated experts with experience in this field; this without even touching on the extraneous factors such as the need to rehouse anything up to ½ million people and perhaps eventually to move Mexico City International Airport. If we were talking about virtually any other developing country we could only conclude that the scheme is so huge and so little thought out that we could forget about it for the foreseeable future.\n\nHowever all Mexican schemes seem to start in this muddled, haphazard and indeed exasperating manner, yet time and time again we have seen the pieces fall suddenly into place, a firm decision taken by the President, top priority given and unless one is very careful a contract lost before one ever fully realized that a possibility of one existed.[39]\n\nIn contrast, British ears would have pricked up hearing Diaz Ordaz’s Message to the Nation of 1 September 1965, as the President of Mexico, significantly, chose to address nuclear matters, starting with the role of CNEN and moving to hints at grand projects:\n\nThe work of the National Commission of Nuclear Energy is based on the will to favour and promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy.\n\nWe desire that the development of our nuclear industry should rest on self-sufficiency in the supply of raw materials; that increasingly large groups of Mexicans should be trained for the direction and control of future installations; that the people should experience the benefits of this activity through agriculture, industry and medicine, and that we should be prepared from now on to use nuclear reactors to remedy the shortage of electric power and water.[40]\n\nUltimately though the project had little support in Mexico outside the CNEN, a fact that UKAEA gradually recognized. ‘the Texcoco pot will probably remain simmering for some time but without coming to the boil’.[41] For the choice of desalination plant, first in Tijuana but then for Texcoco, the second factor was immense American political lobbying, at the highest levels, and how it split the influencers at the top of the Mexican one-party political system. For example, it was the Foreign Office’s ‘information’ that\n\nvery great pressure us being put on the Mexicans – at President to President level – to ensure that all desalination business in Mexico – including the possible plant at Texcoco – should go to the US. This has reached the point at which politicians close to President Diaz Ordaz assume that the US will get its way. The technicians on the other hand look to the UK and would seek to frustrate this pressure if they can.[42]\n\nOther alternatives to a nuclear reactor/desalination plant combination were available. Piping river water from a distance has already been mentioned; later oil-fired power station for desalination and biochemical treatment of sewage effluent were also possible.[43]\n\nThe third factor was the death of Dr Nabor Carrillo in February 1967.[44] This man, who had witnessed a nuclear detonation at Bikini atoll in 1946[45], and who had subsequently promoted the application of nuclear power to save Mexico City from collapse, was, at least as far as UK diplomats and scientists heard and saw, the firmest supporter in Mexico of choosing UK over North American suppliers of reactors and desalination plant.\n\nMany years later, the remnants of Lake Texcoco were eventually memorialized as Lake Nabor Carrillo, and Mexico’s nuclear institute is also named after him. In the 2010s Lake Nabor Carrillo was first drained to start building Mexico City’s new international airport, and then, as this project was cancelled, refilled to form an ecological park.[46]\n\nNuclear power never saved Mexico City, and the Carrillo’s Texcoco Project was never realised. In the late 1960s, the UK were still pitching an Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor as Mexico considered its nuclear options elsewhere. In 1972 the Mexican government decided to accept US designs, and in 1976 construction began at Laguna Verde, on the Gulf coast, on two 654 MW(E) General Electric boiling-water reactors.[47] They are the only large nuclear power reactors in Mexico.\n\nThis has been a story of a grand hydraulic engineering vision conceived during the pinnacle years of nuclear optimism. I found it because I was wondering about what links there might be between Mexico and the UK in the areas of scientific and technological collaboration and diplomacy. To be honest I had not expected to find much. Mexico is Spanish-speaking, a central American Republic, with little reason to prioritise relations with the UK. Yet because of its post-war strengths in nuclear power and desalination, and precisely because the United Kingdom was NOT the Unted States then a window for commerce opened.\n\nThere is still much we do not know. How seriously was the UK offer considered? How important were the exchanges between Mexican and US presidents? What would the public response have been to a large nuclear reactor built on the edge of Mexico City? It would be fascinating to see the view from other archives.\n\nReferences\n\n[1] TNA FO 371/183321. ‘Note of a meeting held at the UKAEA’s London office, 11 Charles II Street, at 3.30 pm on Tuesday, 2nd February 1965’\n\n[2] TNA FO 371/183321.

Since then there have been a couple of excellent special issues of journals that have moved the study of the history of science diplomacy on significantly. So I am now sharing what I have done, and then I too can move on.\n\n(Oh, and it also cites documentary evidence that the ‘linear model’ did exist in the 1970s.)\n\n==\n\nBritain, Science and International Relations, 1970-1983\n\nPaper for “Science Diplomacy in Europe” workshop 28-29 September 2016 (to be read/summarised, with thanks, by David Aubin) (** DRAFT**)\n\nAbstract. In this paper I propose to survey some of major preoccupations and issues facing the British Foreign Office (FO, sometimes Foreign and Commonwealth Office). In particular I will be sharing research on recently opened archives, covering the 1970s to mid-1980s, during which period the UK began its (apparently, unfortunately, temporary!) membership of the European community. The paper is therefore responding to the question set by the organisers: what is science diplomacy and what is it needed for? I will outline what, from the position of Britain’s main governmental body responsible for such matters, was seen as the goals and practice of diplomacy through science and for science. Areas covered will include European relations (including bi- and tri-lateral), and relations with particularly interesting cases (including Japan and China, although less on the latter since I have published on UK-China science diplomacy elsewhere).\n\nI intend my paper to be provisional and open to be moved in other directions, hopefully through collaboration. I would be able to explore, for example, British ends of other case studies that planned to be discussed. The Foreign Office would be one site, but other governmental (for example, aid managing bodies, which have tended to be separate) or non-governmental organisations that have historically shaped international relations (such as the Royal Society), could be other sites of research. Finally, while the paper would focus on a particularly interesting decade and a half, the wider project (again possibly a collaborative or comparative project) would be to extend the account further back and forward in time.\n\nInternational Science and International Relations\n\nScience has always been international. Henry Oldenburg at the early Royal Society in London and Marin Mersenne in Paris were at the centres of international networks of exchange of scientific information. The 18th century age of exploration globalised the phenomenon of scientific encounters. From the mid-19th century international congresses have coordinated disciplines, while centres such as the Naples zoological station became sites of international pilgrimage and research. In the 20th century, as science-based industries flourished and the scale and cost of science increased, so international relationships mattered even more, especially as governments were increasingly generous patrons but also demanded a return on investment. Science has been an avant garde of international relations.\n\nThe pace picked up after the Second World War. 58 new inter-governmental and similar organisations were set up in the first decade after 1945, more than the preceding 20 years; there were over 300 international scientific organisations by 1976.[1] Other major new organisations – UNESCO, NATO, OECD – had broad remits with large scientific components.\n\nThe landscape of international science is fiendishly complex, even when viewed only from any one country. We have, for example, ties between private industries, including multinationals. Many separate government departments – but especially the departments of trade, the Foreign Office, overseas development – watch and influence inter-governmental co-operation. The Royal Society has a special and historic role as the main representative of non-governmental collaboration. The context of the Cold War encouraged a slew of programmes. The European project did likewise. UK annual subscriptions from the middle of my period (1977-1978) to organisations give a sense of the priorities: the £37m to the European Space Agency, £24m to CERN, £20m to NATO (plus a further £4.5m just for the relevant NATO secretariat), 9m through the UN, £7m to Eurocontrol (air traffic control), almost £5m to the World Health Organisation, over £1m to organisations such as the IAEA and EMBL.[2]\n\nMy proposal is that the UK Foreign and Commonwealth Office (hereafter Foreign Office[3]) is the organisation that in particular requires further historical examination to understand the development of science, science policy and science diplomacy. From the work of other historians (including work underway or proposed) we have a good sense of the factors shaping CERN, NATO’s science programmes, or the Royal Society’s international roles.[4] But it was the Foreign Office that was the lead diplomatic body for the UK government. The Foreign Office was not necessarily the organisation with everyday responsibility in the management of scientific relations[5], but, I think more importantly, it was where science issues needed to be balanced against other diplomatic factors and demands. It is where we see the value of science diplomacy tested. In this paper I will discuss UK science diplomacy in relation to the European Community, Japan, the Eastern Bloc and China, but it is also the case that any one of these histories would be best be explored collaboratively. Historiographically, science diplomacy must be understood from within from each centre, and the results integrated. My offer is to contribute the detailed archival work and analysis from the UK side to such joint, transnational collaborative projects that might be proposed at this meeting.\n\nEurope\n\nLet’s begin the exploration of this landscape with Europe, because I want to say what the newly released documents tell us about the implications for and roles of science as Britain joined the EEC on 1 January 1973.\n\nJohn Krige emphasised four points in his synthetic overview of European scientific and technological collaboration. The first is that the ‘a fundamental point of reference in understanding European scientific and technological collaboration is, of course, the United States …European scientific and technological development has been reactive, an answer to what has been happening in the United States… We have reacted, they have initiated’; it has been a game of catch up.[6] Second, ‘it is important’, Krige argues, ‘not to forget that this scientific, technical and industrial collaboration is part of the post-war political and economic reconstruction of Europe. It actually underlies the political integration of Europe into something like a unified block’.[7] Third, this process required active political will, and always demanded asking the question of what was gained in return for releasing sovereignty. Points 2 and 3, I say, are what makes the question of Britain and European scientific and technological collaboration important, especially, as Krige says, as such collaboration ‘has been a driver, a forerunner, of political and economic integration which has come afterwards’.[8] Finally, he notes that European collaboration is ‘constantly threatened by the centrifugal pull of national interest’.\n\nPrior to 1973, some of the projects Krige has in mind are as follows. First, CERN, set up in the 1950s, with British physicists ambivalent. As the powerful synchrocyclotrons and proton synchrotrons came on stream, so European physicists were able to compete with Americans. The funding, scale and indeed sheer amount of data produced by CERN required international collaboration. And it was also a way of building Europe, in Krige’s sense. CERN has been a model polity in several ways. It is well known how the world wide web started as a tool to manage CERN’s documents. CERN was also a model and inspiration for European collaboration in other fields, especially space (ESRO, ELDO and ESA) and molecular biology (EMBO). It was Edoardo Amaldi, a CERN founder, who recommended a European space organisation in 1959, as soon as the commissioning of the CERN’s first large particle accelerator demonstrated that European large-scale scientific collaboration could work[9], while the foundational meeting of EMBO took place at CERN in 1962 between Leo Szilard, CERN director Victor Weisskopf, James Watson and John Kendrew.[10]\n\nOther projects include Euratom, JET and the Franco-German Laue-Langevin Institute. Euratom was one of the pillars of the European communities. The Joint European Torus fusion project, sited at Culham, was the ‘first joint undertaking created by the European Communities’.[11] The British siting of JET illustrated the advantages of joining discussions early. The older Laue-Langevin Institute, built around a high flux neutron source, shows what happens when the UK joined discussions late. Physicists at Munich and Grenoble had both benefited from Atoms for Peace initiatives.[12] In the 1950s and 1960s, improved relations, exemplified at the top by those between Adenauer and de Gaulle, meant that both governments ‘were looking for ways of showing their good will’. Scientists, especially Heinz Maier-Leibnitz in Munich and Louis Néel in Grenoble seized the opportunity. It was never going to be easy for the UK to join a project designed to display the strength of the Paris-Bonn axis. Furthermore it was only after the minister for education and science, Margaret Thatcher, turned down a national high neutron flux reactor in 1972 that British scientists pushed to join the ILL. The Science Research Council subscribed to ILL on the same day as Britain joined the EEC – new year’s day 1973. However, despite paying one third of capital costs, the request to add the name “Bragg” to the Laue-Langevin Institute was turned down.[13]\n\nEven before the UK was allowed into Europe, a mechanism had been found to manage the negotiation of European collaboration beyond the borders of the EEC, especially of research on a smaller scale to the giant institutions of CERN or space research. In the 1960s, as part of a general trend for European governments to respond to international competition by articulating explicit science policies (reflecting a model that science was crucial for economic advantage), the Council of Ministers of the Europe of Six set up a Committee for Medium-Term Economic Policy (in 1964) followed by a sub-committee on science and technology (PREST, in 1965).[14] PREST produced two reports – known after their chairs as the Maréchal Report of October 1967 and the Aigrain Report of March 1969 – which identified areas and specific proposals for European cooperation.[15] As a result a new body – Coopération Européenne dans le domaine de la recherché scientifique et technique, or COST – was launched in November 1971, firstly, as a ‘a vehicle for carrying out “a la carte” concerted action projects outside community programmes’, and second , to provide European countries that were not members of the Community with ‘an opportunity to participate in Community programmes’.[16] COST was opposed by countries (such as Belgium) that favoured a single integrated Community research policy. COST was supported by those (including the UK before and after joining the EEC) who saw advantage in flexibility. By 1978 COST consisted of 9 EC members (including by then of course the UK) and 10 others.[17] By then, given the free choice that the COST mechanism allowed, the UK was party to 11 of 14 projects.\n\nThat gives a flavour of some, but by no means all, European science collaboration. Now, what do we learn now the archives have been opened?\n\nFirst, we can note that the commentators have viewed COST as a ‘paradoxical success’, in that despite its ‘institutional instability’ and an ‘extremely troubled existence’ it coordinated a lot of research.[18] The new documents show that the specific reasons, at both high and low levels, what the nature of this instability was. So, for example, the record of a the high-level but informal tripartite meeting between the UK, Germany and France, chaired by Alan Cottrell in November 1972, is quite explicit about the different visions for European collaboration found among the three and outside.[19] Germany wanted to COST to push forward on a programme of coordinated fundamental research projects; by choosing fundamental science ‘administrative and political complications’ would be kept to a minimum, and an exemplary record of success achieved. The alternative would be that OECD would step in to the void which was a ‘danger’, ‘scientifically and politically’. France ‘felt that co-ordination of fundamental research’ was precisely what COST should not do. The UK favoured a different set of projects again. At a low level, the documents reveal complaints and gripes as the gears of European bureaucratic coordination ground slowly. For example, one civil servant recorded the ‘rather dismal experience’ of COST project 43 (on ocean data buoys): ‘meetings heavily weighted with politics, bedevilled by squabbles between the French and Germans and largely devoid of science’.[20] Or you find revealing gossip – for example, as one civil servant confided to another:\n\nThere was another scandal over a vast Institute of Practical Philosophy which apparently would make science (and other) policy decisions in a scientific and unambiguously correct way. It now has 71 staff but has not yet got around to making a decision. However the director, von Weiszacker, plays chess with the Federal Chancellor…[21]\n\nHowever, the headline finding from reading the released archives is that the UK’s position was a sceptical one towards the idea of a single science or technology policy at a European level – or indeed to coordination of European science or technology policies in a significant way. In the late 1960s, with entry into Europe on the horizon (but following the French veto of the UK’s entry into the Common Market in 1968), the approach was to welcome scientific and technological cooperation conditional on widening Europe. For example, here is Harold Wilson’s handwritten minute on whether to accept a proposal to move forward on the Aigrain report:\n\nAs long as we are not forthcoming. Our job is to prove that real cooperation is impossible outside a united and widened community.[22]\n\nOnce the issue of widening Europe had been settled, the scepticism towards a single science or technology policy was articulated directly. The European Commission saw enlargement as an opportunity to consider objectives afresh and to propose a new coordinated policy, in a strong form as urged by the energetic european commissioner for industry, research and technology Altiero Spinelli and in a more pragmatic form after Spinelli’s remit was split by the commissioner for science and education Ralf Dahrendorf.[23] While impressed by the personal characters of both Spinelli and Dahrendorf, the UK position was that a unified science or technology policy was unwelcome. Brian Flowers, chair of the UK’s Science Research Council, and from November 1974 appointed chair of the new European Science Foundation, noted in March 1972 that he found in conversation ‘quite a number of people still think in terms of an overall science policy, and believe in the linear model: research -> technology -> industrial innovation -> profits’.[24] (Note: the ‘linear model’, as an actors’ term, certainly did exist!) A policy statement from March 1973 stated bluntly that a separate science or technology policy ‘cannot sensibly be developed’, instead policies only meant sense when analysed at sectoral level: ‘the application of technology should be part of and should serve industrial policy’.[25] Not all countries should need to cooperate on every project, and a door should always be open beyond the communities to third parties. Activities should be cost effective. Inter-governmental cooperation was often to be preferred to Community organisation of projects.\n\nThe extra ingredient here was the background of Heath’s new national science policy exemplified by the Rothschild proposals to link some national decisions to the customer-contractor principle. As the same document stated: ‘in Europe as in the UK, research and development should be undertaken only to meet the needs of particular sectors by(??) the customer-contractor principle’.[26] As one official wrote, after a sceptical review of the Spinelli proposals: ‘floreat Rothschild’.[27] (The significance of Rothschild’s customer-contractor principle – the customer states what research they want, the contractor provides it, for a named price – is that it represents market – ie neo-liberal – language in science policy in an early, distinct and ultimately influential form.)\n\nHow are we to understand this position? It seems to me that there are three positions: first, that it was a principled position, which started with Rothschild and deduced a European position. This seems unlikely, as similar sentiments can be found in the 1960s. Second, that it was simply an extension of the absence of a single science policy at home. Since science policy was essentially sectoral at home, then this was the position to take in Europe. Third, however, it is a hypothesis that can be advanced (but not tested until more archival work has been done), that this approach strengthened as preparations for entry into Europe allowed UK officials to witness the ‘meetings heavily weighted with politics, bedevilled by squabbles between the French and Germans and largely devoid of science’, noted earlier. The gossip turns out to have a substantial, accumulative impact on policy.\n\nJapan\n\nSince we are focussing on the Foreign Office, we can keep a broad eye on the whole diplomatic landscape. The case if Japan should, a priori, be interesting because by the 1980s the country is seen as a potential model for the encouragement of competitive, high-technology industries. But the diplomatic view in the 1970s was often, as we shall see, still looking backwards to the past. It is therefore an open question about how science and technology diplomacy with Japan developed.\n\nThe changing relations between Britain and Japan can be gauged by examining the responses to despatches sent from the Tokyo embassy to London in the 1970s. Three ambassadorial despatches are of particular interest: two from Sir John Pilcher (‘Japan in the 1970s: the Trade Mark and the Sword’ in 1970, and the follow up ‘Guns and Butter’ of 1972) and one from Sir Michael Wilford (‘Japan is Entering the Electronic Age’ of 1978). Pilcher had acted as a student interpreter in the Japan consular service before the Second World War.[28] After stints in Tsingdao, London (including time as head of the Japan and Pacific Department in the Foreign Office), Rome, Manila and Vienna, Pilcher was appointed ambassador to Japan in 1967. He sent a ‘first impressions’ despatch in February 1968, in which he wondered whether ‘the myriad chimney stacks that link Tokyo with Osaka’ were really “all that remains of the dreams of warriors”; in ‘the Trade Mark and Sword’, Pilcher returned to the question: ‘is the old militarism dead, quiescent or about to be revived?’[29] Following defeat, the Japanese people had blamed the military for leading the Emperor and society down the wrong path. An alternative path, a civil path to economic prosperity, had been chosen. A now prosperous nation was being asked to contribute to its own defence, which in turn meant rearmament (including even nuclear armament) and a rehabilitation of the military. Yasuhiro Nakasone was the politician leading this rearmament. Japanese sensibilities, young and old, included a strong distaste for dependence on other nations. The United States had withdrawn from Okinawa, while still committing to defence of Japan. In 1968 young rioters had demanded a rejection of the Security Treaty. Pilcher summarised the situation:\n\nThe stage is now set for the time when the Self-Defence Forces, adequately armed and rehabilitated in the public mind, could effectively undertake the task of defending Japan, within the framework of the Security Treaty with the United States. In the process of rehabilitation, some recourse has been had to the old military traditions of Japan. The sanction of the Emperor, once the tool of the military has been invoked. The old experts have become involved in plans for rearmament. In the back ground the basic virtues of loyalty and patriotism are still present; the sense of cohesion remains. The ingredients for a military revival are all there. Will they be misused?\n\nPilcher thought, on balance, the answer was no. The ‘old with their rancours’ were dying away. The middle-aged embraced the path to prosperity and ‘looked realistically at the facts’, and were represented by Nakasone. The young, ‘emancipated by prosperity from the restraints of the past’ had few of the complications that beset the middle generation. While there remained a small risk that ‘Ersatz religions of false ideologies might occupy their minds’, so long as the young remained prosperous then a return to militarism was unlikely.\n\nOn 20th and 21st December, 1971, Edward Heath met Richard Nixon in Bermuda, an attempt to initiate a new Anglo-American relationship, which, firstly, was seen in some quarters to have become less close, and, second, needed reconsideration in the light of the decision taken for the United Kingdom to enter the EEC. Other topics under discussion included relations between the west and China: Nixon’s triumphant visit to China would take place the following February and the United States did not want the waters muddied.[30] Bermuda seems to have warmed Anglo-American relations, and mutual support was evidence over issues encountered in late 1971 and early 1972, including the renegotiation of military bases in Malta, troubles in Northern Ireland and Christmas bombings in Vietnam.[31] Also discussed, it is clear, was Japan. Under the heading “Bringing Japan into the Western family”, the private secretary of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office wrote to his counterpart in the Cabinet Office: ‘In the light of the P.M.’s talks with President Nixon in Bermuda we have been looking at the present extent of Anglo-Japanese contacts with a view to recommending improvements’. Presumably a decision was taken by Western powers to embrace Japan further to counter adverse reactions to the opening of relations between the United States and China.\n\nInto this mix, in January 1972, came Pilcher’s second despatch on the subject of Japan in the 1970s. The ambassador described the pressures pointing towards Japanese rearmament. Three American moves had prompted a change of mood: Nixon’s Guam doctrine of 1969 told western allies ‘assume the primary responsibility of providing the manpower for [their own] defense’. There would be no repeat of Vietnam. Second, on 16th July 1971, Nixon had, without consulting allies, in particular Japan, announced a reversal of US-China policies. Third, on 15th August 1971, the president ended the Bretton Woods system that had structured international financial relations by declaring that dollars and gold would no longer be directly convertible. The last two announcements were labelled in Japan the two “Nixon shocks”. ‘Somewhere in the package sought by the Americans’, noted Pilcher of the consequences, “was a commitment that Japan should support, with more purchases, the ailing but politically powerful United States armament industry’.[32] Alternatively the Japanese arms industry could expand. Within the Japanese state, the ministries of finance and foreign affairs favoured the former; while MITI and the Defence Agency favoured the latter. ‘Many people in Japan’, Pilcher observed, echoing Eisenhower, ‘see a greater danger in an industrial complex manipulating military policy and extending military potential than in a recrudescence of militarism in its classical sense’. However, there was ‘no doubt that industrialists control contemporary Japan and that by comparison with them the military occupy a humble situation’.\n\nThere was no more controversial issue in Japan than the question of nuclear weapons on home soil. The possibility was ‘political dynamite’, wrote Pilcher; he continued:\n\nIt is admitted that in present circumstances, now aggravated by United States policies, Japan must look to her own defence as soon as she can in a world still afflicted by strife between armed nations and in which a nation cannot feel safe without some form of nuclear defence. But it would still be outside political possibility for any democratic Japanese government today to proceed overtly towards a breach of Japan’s three nuclear principles, i.e. No possession, No admission and No manufacture. I am nonetheless of the opinion that these principles could be breached by the end of the decade.\n\nAgain the choice, if such a path was taken, was between home development or buying in nuclear defence from abroad. On the one hand, Japan had begun to acquire ‘uranium enrichment technology and the Japanese Space programme could be the basis of a delivery system’, recorded Pilcher, while on the other, ‘a leading Japanese industrialist has suggested that his country might rent its share of the US nuclear umbrella, both to dispense with the need for the creation of a national deterrent and also to satisfy US demands for financial support without damage to the Japanese armaments industry’.\n\nOverall, Pilcher summarised the Japanese choice in the early 1970s as one between spending the accumulating national wealth on ‘guns or butter’. While at present the Japanese had chosen ‘butter’ – pollution control, housing, schools, hospitals, drainage, improved retirement pensions, shorter working hours and cheaper imported food – to ignore the gathering pressures to choose rearmament would be ‘ill-advised’.\n\nIt was in this context that science and technology diplomacy initiatives developed in the 1970s and 1980s. My first impression is that Japan became increasingly a point of comparison, especially with regard to industrial competitiveness during the period, yet we do not know what the consequences were for what this attention might have shaped or even displaced, not least with regards to Europe. A historical project on transnational science diplomacy needs to keep these broad comparisons in view.\n\nEastern Europe\n\nAn interesting area of new policy in the late 1960s and 1970s were the increasing number of International Technology Agreements signed between the UK and other countries. Starting with Romania, Hungary and Poland in 1967, these agreements had a primarily Eastern Bloc focus. By 1971 these three countries had been joined by the Soviet Union (1968), Czechoslovakia (1968), Yugoslavia (1968), Bulgaria (1969) and Argentina (1971), with further memoranda of understanding signed with Finland (1970) and Italy (1969).[33] These agreements did not cover ‘scientific exchanges of a pure research type, nor the exchange of specialists in narrow fields of interest’, which could be covered by separate “Cultural Agreements”. Nor did they offer direct technical aid. What they did do was aim to ‘create a favourable climate and “sponsorship” for collaboration’, leading to sales of products, patents, licenses under patents, and other trade opportunities. The lead organisation on the British side was the International Technological Collaboration Unit (ICTU) within the DTI, while the main participants were firms. There was always a danger of time wasted through ‘rather ritual sessions’, or misunderstandings over what each side could bring to the table. Formal encounters were therefore downplayed, and less formal study tours and fringe meetings encouraged. The Agreements were considered to be more flexible and targeted than the equivalent tools of foreign technological policy deployed by France and Italy.\n\nThe supporters of the Agreements struggled, it has to be said, to produce quantitative evidence of their “value”, insisting instead that they must be seen as initiative that would repay effort on a longer term.[34] They were more robust, however, in their rejection of charges that the Agreements ‘encourage or promote a drain of valuable technological information to the other side with no corresponding advantage to the UK’. Instead, firms were put under no pressure to release technological information and if they did so it was because the firms themselves saw commercial advantage.\n\nSo what? The first point is that here was an area of new science and technology diplomacy where the Foreign Office was not the lead department. Second, how do these agreements compare to French, German and other bilateral agreements? Were they similar or different? Competitive or coordinated? Were the agreements at all influential in economic terms, or were they merely symbolic, a means of keeping diplomatic doors ajar? Did the agreements matter for history of technology?\n\nI think these Agreements are interesting first as a policy means of organising encounters for science-based industries in the years of relative Cold War détente, and second as a model which later and ultimately perhaps more significant relationships were built, especially with China. In 1975-1976, the ICTU had canvassed industrial opinion about a possible bilateral scientific and technological agreement with China, and had received the response there was no need for one, indeed that it might ‘do positive harm’.[35]\n\nChina\n\n(Note: I have written up this section in much more detail elsewhere.[36])\n\nThe late 1970s were pivotal years for the history of modern China. The Cultural Revolution had encouraged attacks on Chinese experts and centres of research and learning, with few institutions (primarily military research ones) emerging unscathed. A period of stasis ended with the death of Mao in 1976, followed by the high-level strife of the Gang of Four, and finally the consolidation of power under Deng Xiaoping. From the West’s perspective, one visible sign of change was the new policies directed outwards from China to acquire … Science and technology were crucial in this process…\n\nTo get a sense of the dramatic changes in attitude and the consequences for the UK’s scientific relations with China, let’s start in the early 1970s.\n\nScientific contacts between the UK and People’s Republic of China, active since Cyril Hinshelwood’s visit in 1959, had been ‘brought to an abrupt end [in 1966] by the Cultural Revolution’.[37] In October 1971, the Foreign Secretary of the Royal Society, Kingsley Dunham, had written to the Academica Sinica, regarding the resumption of relations. In January 1972, Yueh Chih-chien, acting secretary of the Academica Sinica, replied saying that Dunham’s letter had been ‘carefully studied’, and agreed that both sides might ‘send some scientific workers to visit each others countries and carry out scientific exchanges’.[38] Dunham in turn proposed a visit by a Royal Society party, including the president, Alan Hodgkin, Dunham and the secretary D.C. Martin in May of that year.[39] Privately, however, the Foreign Office was less than impressed by the modest opening:\n\nThe general tone of the letter seems to show that the present regime in China are no more able to make an open-handed and generous gesture than any of their predecessors. The careful restriction upon the numbers and background of any admissible visitors is true to for and surely makes a bit of a nonsense of any real exchange.[40]\n\nOutside of these high-level institutional channels, for example, scientists had little success gaining entry to China for research. The pressure brought to bear by the (ex-?)MP Malcolm MacDonald, via the Foreign Office, in1972 to let in John MacKinnon and his wife, both naturalists, to study pandas, was unsuccessful.[41] (MacKinnon, a protégé of Jane Goodall and Niko Tinbergen, and now an expert on Chinese biodiversity finally got to China in 1987.[42])\n\nNevertheless, the Royal Society and Academica Sinica arranged exchanges of delegations in May and October 1972.[43] The reports of the visit of the Royal Society delegation led by Alan Hodgkin in May 1972 makes fascinating reading. The devastation wrought by the Cultural Revolution is diplomatically recorded, as well as overall personal impressions (lots of bicycles, ‘drab’). The overall conclusion – expressed in the Royal Society report as a specific comment on the Peking National University, but interpreted by the Foreign Office as a more general conclusion[44] – was that there was ‘nothing in what we saw… to lead us to think that exchanges … could be profitably contemplated in the near future’.\n\nChinese scientific visits to the UK, on the other hand, picked up, with visits occurring every year. In 1975, for example, three delegations concerned with machine tools, agricultural research and high-speed photography visited, while the British Council enabled 38 Chinese students to also make the trip. Technological missions included link-ups Chinese students at Hawker Siddeley, British oil engineers visits to China, and a deal over the Spey aero engine. These low-level exchanges were also to be found between China and other countries, notably Germany and France. ‘Increased scientific contacts with China, which is fast becoming an important market for nuclear and advanced technology, could be seen as an investment in the future’, noted the Foreign Office, ‘if we can make Chinese scientists and technicians familiar with British methods and equipment we could be better placed to compete for commercial contacts when the opportunities arise’.[45] Even in the nuclear field, where the ‘possibility of substantial nuclear trade’ remained ‘some years’ away, ‘if we do not take advantage now of China’s present positive attitude, we may [fall]… irretrievably behind the French’.\n\nThe arguments for encouraging scientific relations with China were threefold: encouraging trade (at the expense of competitors), the desirability of scientific international contact in and of itself, and finally strategically this placed science in an avant garde position: ‘Britain has a broad political interest in involving China more closely with the EEC and ourselves and science is a field where this can be achieved’.[46] Arguments against the first two were that there was a danger that the traffic of technological expertise would be ‘one-way’, while the restrictions, such as low quotas and refusal of access to much of China, on scientific exchanges, as well as the feeling that there were ‘few fields in which [UK] scientists have much to learn from the Chinese’, made them of much reduced value.[47] So it was perhaps the third, strategic, reason that encouraged the FO to watch for and support further openings.\n\nThe opening came in early 1978. In China, a landmark was the lengthy speech made by Fang Yi, minister in charge of the State Scientific and Technical Commission, at the National Science Conference, Beijing?, on March 1978.[48] (The conference also heard a speech by the president of the Chinese Academy of Science, 86-year old Kuo Mo-jo, titled ‘It is springtime for science’. Deng Xiaoping also probably spoke.[49]) Fang Yi placed science at heart of the four modernisations, and announced a series of dramatic expansions in resources, personnel and facilities, as well as specific policies for agricultural science, energy research, materials, electronic computers, laser and space science, high energy physics, and genetic engineering. Finally, Fang Yi announced that ‘a logical corollary to a philosophy which maximises the pursuit of scientific knowledge’ was an ‘approach of utilizing the experience of others and avoiding the duplication of their pioneering efforts’, which in turn meant greatly increasing scientific and technical cooperation.\n\nAn ad hoc meeting of Whitehall representatives gathered in March and agreed that a new attempt to secure a scientific and technological agreement would now ‘do no harm and might do some political good’.[50] Industry (for example Hawker Siddeley) supported the move.[51] Simultaneously, the Chinese embassy in Tokyo signalled that, following ‘China’s decision to modernise every aspect of her industry and agriculture’ exchanges should be explored.[52] ‘My impression’, glossed the UK’s scientific counsellor in Tokyo, was ‘that they need technical help and are prepared to go to considerable lengths to get what they want’.[53] Adding nuance, he added, after a discussion with more Chinese diplomatic staff, that the Chinese were weighing up to what extent to buy in expertise (and from whom) and to what extent ‘they “should go it alone”’.[54] The ignorance of the professional observers of science and technology in China should not be underestimated. As one informed commentator at the Department of Industry noted, for example, ‘it wasn’t a question of what, if any, research was being done at a specific university: no-one was certain of that University was still in existence’.[55]\n\nThe UK’s rivals here were primarily Japan but also France and Germany. Paris received the same signals as London, and had speedily signed an agreement on scientific and technical cooperation in February. British diplomats wheedled the document from French diplomats in Tokyo, and it was read with interest. It was judged to be ‘very unremarkable’.[56] The French had no desire to ‘let things get out of control or proliferate like their scientific relations with the Russians’, which had become burdensome. The Germans followed a similar path.[57] So the UK saw an opportunity, so long as a better agreement could be made. As a model, the UK government turned to its technological agreements made through ITSU. Professor John Ashworth, of the Central Policy Review Staff, wrote:\n\nAs you know, there is a growing fear here that we are not doing enough to stimulate trade with China and a bilateral agreement along the lines of the ones we have with East European countries might help. Such an agreement would involve science and technological matters as well as economic and trade concerns…[58]\n\nIn late April and May, diplomats received further signals that cultural, scientific and technological agreements would ‘receive favourable consideration’ by the Chinese.[59]\n\nIn fact, of the other agreements in the works, none were so advanced as the scientific one, partly it seems because Taiwanese complications did not arise or were not raised.[60] Again, therefore, science was an avant garde. A second general Whitehall meeting on 17 May 1978 agreed that it was in UK interests to negotiate a bilateral science and technology agreement. The model would be the ICTU-arranged agreements with the Eastern Bloc. Thus China was taken to be, at least in this instance, a larger Romania.\n\nThe Royal Society and the research councils were consulted, with the Royal Society stating that it ‘had no evidence that their existing contacts would be at risk if we failed to conclude an Agreement’.[61] John Ashworth now wrote to the Lord Privy Seal (Fred Peart) urging the formal, ministerial level opening of negotiations.[62] On 23 June 1978, Peart in turn asked Shirley Williams, as secretary of state for education and science, to proceed.[63] She visited China in July 1978.\n\nThe contrasting experiences of three British scientists who wanted to visit China were also used, at this critical juncture, to draw policy implications. Professor Cocking and Dr Sunderland were both botanists funded by the Royal Society. They visited the Dr Man-chang Wiu and were unimpressed by his well-publicised genetic engineering experiments with goldfish. However, they were both impressed by Chinese plant genetics, judging the wheat and maize work to be ‘undisputedly’ world leading. Cocking, who spoke no Chinese, was subsequently invited to work at the Institute of Plant Physiology in Beijing. In contrast, Dr Stephenson, a Newcastle university-based astronomer, was refused entry, despite the fact that he spoke Chinese and wished only to consult records. ‘The difference’, noted the British Embassy to the FCO, was that ‘Professor Cocking possesses knowledge which China wants; Dr Stephenson does not’.[64] The Chinese approval of Dorothy Hodgkin’s visits to China to work on insulin fitted the same pattern. It was an example of one-sided, self-interested exchange that those negotiating the proposed agreement must seek ways to avoid. But also the existence of world-leading Chinese science made the agreement desirable.\n\nOne interesting feature of the growing scientific links between the UK and China in this period is that the Royal Society and the UK government followed separate tracks that only occasionally met. The UK government approach was dominated by issues of strategy, trade and competition with rivals. (To give a – excuse the pun – concrete example of what was being pushed, officials urged the highlighting of Pilkingtons’ new Cemfil, a glass fibre for reinforcing cement.[65]) The Royal Society approach covered science, extending to ‘applied science’ but not, as the Society Foreign Secretary Michael Stoker explained to John Ashworth ‘technology, with its commercial and industrial implications’.[66] The occasion of this explanation was Stoker’s writing to Ashworth with regards to the expansion of links between the Royal Society and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He suggested a ‘meeting of interested parties’ ahead of the Chinese academicians visit in October 1978 to ‘consider and coordinate our initiatives and responses’, adding that ‘Depending on the Chinese attitude, we might even continue meetings subsequently to formulate strategies for prompting strong scientific links with China’. The point I want to draw from this is that these meetings had not happened before.\n\nClosely foreshadowing the main event, the Royal Society and the Chinese Academy of Sciences signed an Agreement on Scientific Cooperation in early November 1978. It provided for a range of scientific interchange, including short-term visits and lectures by senior scientists, exchange of junior scientists, participation in seminars and meetings, joint research projects and exchange of scientific materials and publications.[67] The Chinese began extracting the best of British science, for example soliciting a state-of-the-art bubble chamber, based on the device at CERN.[68] The Royal Society formed its China Committee, with members drawn across the research councils, academia and elsewhere, to review relations.[69]\n\nThe senior bilateral intergovernmental Science and Technology Agreement was drafted in autumn 1978 and signed at Lancaster House, London, on 15 November 1978 by David Owen and by vice-premier Wang Chen.[70] It was the first treaty signed between China and the UK since the communist victory of 1949.[71] The agreement between the Royal Society and the Chinese Academy of Sciences was considered to come under its ‘general umbrella’.[72] It was, in the judgement of British diplomats and officials, a better agreement than the French and Germans got.[73] [more from George letter on details] On a wider stage, it was also considered to be a good visible counterweight to lack of progress on defence matters.[74] Some of the sticking points in the negotiations are intriguing. For example the Chinese did not recognise the category of ‘fundamental science’:\n\nOne immutable point, which we tried several times to get round, was the Chinese insistence that fundamental science should be treated in the same way as other possible fields of cooperation, since the Chinese do not themselves recognise fundamental science as different in kind from applied science. Indeed, given their way of controlling intellectual activity in this country, their position was hardly surprising. (Earlier, and perhaps not consistently, they had hinted that they would not be prepared to include fundamental science at all.)[75]\n\nIt is a matter for further investigation to find out how the Royal Society and the Chinese Academy of Sciences negotiated this issue of ‘fundamental science’. (As an aside it is precisely because this kind of research reveals assumptions behind the nature of science in different societies that makes it particularly valuable.)\n\nImmediately, scientists and engineers, as well as science-based industrial firms, took up the opportunity of selling their wares in China. The exchange was also symbolic. In July 1979, for example, 6 Sinclair calculators were proudly given as gifts.[76] [more in CAB 164/1430 and 1431] One of the first, and most enthusiastic, missionaries was Peter Jost, self-proclaimed founder of the science of tribology – the science of surfaces in contact: of wear, friction, traction and lubrication. The British Tribology Mission to China left in May 1979.[77] Fittingly, then the science greased the wheels of diplomacy.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe goals of the Foreign Office for diplomacy were very broad and played for high stakes. Science diplomacy, it has to be said, was only one of many moves within this game, and any historical project on the subject needs to address this subordinate role. Even after the entry of the UK into the EEC in 1973, the goals were often national in terms of interest, and before entry the manoeuvres in science diplomacy may be seen as steps towards more important objectives (not least securing entry itself). In this paper I have argued that the period of the 1970s and 1980s is especially inviting for historians: there is a wealth of unstudied documents, there are key events, and the world was pivoting towards the present in ways we need to re-examine. I have also sketched some of the potential topics and questions that could be explored. In the case of the EEC one question might be the extent a single European science policy was seen as possible or desirable. Another set of questions would focus on specific projects, such as facilities, technological systems or institutes. In the case of the Eastern Bloc, there are comparative questions to be asked about bilateral technological agreements. In the case of China, UK efforts were, firstly, seen as in competition with parallel German and French moves to re-establish post-Mao relations; and, secondly, science diplomacy played its – typical, common? – role as an advance guard for later, more trade-related diplomatic moves. In all of these cases, the broader diplomatic goals, in which Europe was balanced with initiatives in relations with the United States, Japan and China, to name just three important axes, need to be kept in view.\n\nIn general, we need further, deeper research to understand UK science diplomacy as both competitor and co-operator in European science diplomacy. I repeat my sincere offer: I am very keen to contribute to collaborative, historical research to answer these, and similar, questions.\n\n[1] COI, Britain and International Scientific Co-operation.
