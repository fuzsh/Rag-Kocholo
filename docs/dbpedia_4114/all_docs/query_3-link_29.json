The National Library of Australia gratefully acknowledges the contribution of the other foundation AJCP partners, the State Library of New South Wales and The National Archives of the UK, and all other organisations which supported the work of the AJCP, the world's most extensive collaborative copying project, operating from 1948 to 1997.\n\nIntroduction\n\nScope and Contents\n\nPapers c.1884-1890 of Sir William Flower on physical anthropology.\n\nPapers of George Williamson relating to his collection of human skulls.\n\nCorrespondence 1910-1957 of Anthropology Department, mostly relating to skeletal remains.\n\nSubject files 1946-1962 of Anthropology Department.\n\nConditions Governing Access\n\nAvailable for Access.\n\nConditions Governing Use\n\nMany of the records digitised as part of the AJCP are still in copyright. Readers wishing to publish or reproduce documents should seek permission, in the first instance, from the owner of the original material.\n\nPreferred Citation\n\nAcknowledgement of use of this material should refer to the location of the original material and to the Australian Joint Copying Project.\n\nItems from this collection should include references to the location of the original material and to the AJCP nla.obj number, which serves as the online identifier for the digital copy.\n\nExample: M Series: Journal of Capt.

The original AJCP finding aids were unpublished typescripts or photocopies available from libraries that held copies of the original microfilm.\n\nDates used in this finding aid refer to the date range of the records selected for filming rather than to the date range of the Series or Files.\n\nThis Finding Aid retains the identifiers present at the time it was filmed by the Australian Joint Copying Project. The new control numbers applied by the Natural History Museum have been identified where possible.\n\nAdvisory Statement\n\nAustralian Aboriginal, Maori, Pacific and Torres Strait Islander people are advised that this Finding Aid contains material and descriptive information which may be considered culturally sensitive and may cause distress, including names and images of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people now deceased. This Finding Aid contains terms that reflect authors' views or those of the historical period, but which may not be considered appropriate today. While the information may not reflect current understanding, it is provided in an historical context.\n\nSubjects\n\nAnthropologists; Anthropology; Australia; Flower, Sir William; Great Britain; Natural History Museum, London; New Zealand; Skeletal remains; South Africa; Williamson, George\n\nBibliography"
