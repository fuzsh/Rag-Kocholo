The project will help teach children how the Chiltern’s natural resources have supported local industry and communities and impacted on the location, type and development of settlements over human history.\n\nWe can offer:\n\n• FREE guided tour for your class, to get children learning outside in their local landscape (locations limited)\n\n• FREE museum loan boxes (Covid secure) for use in your classroom\n\nIf you know a school that is interested in getting involved, please get in touch via info@wycombemuseum.org, telling us your year group, topic and the term that you are studying the topic."
