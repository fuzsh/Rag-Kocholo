        "text": "As kids, we believed The Maltings was haunted. Hence I wouldn’t go anywhere near the place after dark. In the daytime though, I’d occasionally come to listen to the radio through one of the grates in the wall. Yes…. I was a strange kid.\n\nI figured I was listening into a workshop of some kind and can clearly remember hearing Madonna’s Papa Don’t Preach for the first time. Although I couldn’t hear the lyrics clearly and ended up singing “poppadum peach”.\n\nThe Eagle.\n\nA narrow section of The River Misbourne runs along Barn Meadow’s High Street side. This is where I’d come to hunt for minnows with my fishing net. A favourite spot was the wooden footbridge leading to The Eagle, a traditional pub specialising in real ales and craft beer. Many years later, as a teenager, my college friends and I would frequent The Eagle for a few pints on the weekend.\n\nThe river widens a little further along from The Eagle. This leafy alley connects the meadow to Mill Lane, where my friends Simon and Jono lived. One summer, I built a camp here using whatever sticks and branches we found lying around.\n\nInside, I buried my pocket money and a few treasured trinkets for supposed safekeeping. Come to think of it, I wonder if there’s perhaps something still in there somewhere!\n\nOne afternoon, a family friend, the now sadly departed Ray Knight, took me trout fishing by the bridge. I think we caught something significant, but the details elude me.\n\nRight by that bridge, at the entrance to Mill Lane, stands a gorgeous townhouse by the name of Mill Meadow. In my child’s mind this was the fanciest place in Old Amersham and every time I passed it I couldn’t help but stop and stare.\n\nThe place was like a damn castle, with its own set of gates and two or three amazing cars in the drive. One summer I actually got to wash one of those cars when I went around town with a bucket and sponge offering my dubious services.\n\nAn Emotional Return to Old Amersham.\n\nI believe I can trace the roots of my lifelong sweet tooth right back to Broadway Newsagency. I came here countless times to stock up on penny sweets, fizzy drinks, Panini football stickers and the latest copy of the Beano and Dandy comic books.\n\nThe owners were a lovely Indian couple, The Patels. I even went to school with their son Yateen at St. Mary’s. In 2008 I took this somewhat hasty shot of the place, unaware that it would be the last time I laid eyes on it.\n\nDuring my most recent visit, I was surprised to see that the old newsagents has been transformed into Old Amersham’s best-loved cafe. Whether you’re in for craft coffee, a full English, sandwiches, waffles, burgers or the daily special, Bistro Twelve Twenty delivers some of the best food in town.\n\nBest of all, they haven’t forgotten the building’s history. In fact, a giant Broadway Newsagency sign dominates the back wall of the tiny interior. There are also old photos of the building and the street, which made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. The Patels are very proud, I’m sure.\n\nPeace Garden.\n\nEngland’s parks and gardens are often the envy of the world. Even, it seems, in tiny villages most people have never heard of. In Old Amersham they have a small garden on the High Street that reinvents itself according to the season. In July 2019, just a month prior to my visit, local authorities unveiled the exceptionally endearing Peace Garden.\n\nBursting with colour and character, local volunteers created a gorgeous space home to magnificent floral displays, animal sculptures, a mini waterfall and a bridge. Local businesses stepped in with donations, while the kids at my old school, St Mary’s, contributed a charming flower box based on the story of Noah’s Ark.\n\nThe garden also features a memorial statue to those locals who fell during The First World War. It really is an exceptional space, no wonder the team behind it won a Gold Award at the Britain in Bloom National Finals.\n\nSt Mary’s Parish Church.\n\nSt. Mary’s Parish Church lies just a few dozen steps from the War Memorial. A house of worship of some description has stood here since around 1140, while the current structure dates back to the 13th century.\n\nAs a kid, my classmates and I used to visit for the occasional Sunday service. We also poured in every December for Christmas Carols. One time, I vaguely remember reading something to a packed house of kids, parents and locals. Sadly, I cannot for the life of me recollect the text or indeed the nature of the service.\n\nThe church graveyard is really charming too, like something out of a Dickens novel. If you have the time (I didn’t), it could be interesting to seek out the headstone belonging to Ruth Hornby (1926-1955). Known in her day as Ruth Ellis, she was the last woman to be hanged in Britain after she murdered her lover.\n\nFour Weddings and a Funeral.\n\nThere are some stunning hotels, guesthouses and bed and breakfasts scattered around Old Amersham. If you can splash out and want something with historical significance, consider The Crown Hotel on The High Street.\n\nBuilt in the 16th century, the building has played host to a number of well-to-do families and comes with a few enduring ghost stories.\n\nIn the summer of 1993, film director Mike Newell arrived in Old Amersham with his cast and crew to shoot a number of scenes for his movie Four Weddings and a Funeral.\n\nIn the flick, The Crown is called The Jolly Boatman. The gorgeous reception area, pictured above, is where Carrie, played by Andie MacDowell, hides from the unwanted attention of sleazy George.\n\nIt was here that I asked the receptionist if I could grab a shot of the suite where Carrie and Hugh Grant’s character Charles hook up for the first time. Much to my delight, a couple had checked out of Room 101 that morning. Thus I was able to go in and take a quick look.\n\nThe room has changed almost beyond recognition. Just the basic structure of the space rings true, along with a few of the original wooden beams. Nevertheless, it was another wonderful movie location ticked off my list.\n\n“I always worry I’ll go too far. You know, in the heat of the moment”.\n\n“Well… how far do you think too far would be then?”\n\nExterior shots of The Jolly Boatman actually took place further along the road at the magnificent King’s Arms. This 35 bedroom boutique hotel dates back to the 1400s and features a popular restaurant and pub.\n\nFinally, take a look at the striking Market Hall, a grade II listed structure built by the noted politician and lawyer Sir William Drake in 1682. Drake envisioned it as a covered market and meeting hall for the local council and traders’ guilds.\n\nMarket Hall.\n\nOn that day in 2019 the hall was hosting an antique market. There were about half a dozen stall owners, with a fascinating array of old furniture, jewellery, paintings, kitchenware and general bric-a-brac.\n\nAs I explored, there were several enchanting details to pick out. Such as the Drake family arms on the south wall and a grand, stone north wall plaque detailing key historical events and enlightening trivia. For example, I never knew that Oliver Cromwell’s wife Elizabeth lived in the town for a period during the 1650s.\n\nI’m sure I’ll be back to Old Amersham one day. If only to show Sladja where I grew up and to tie up a few loose ends, such as Amersham Museum and The Martyr’s Memorial. If and when I do make it back, in between more global adventures, I’ll be sure to keep you posted.\n\nFor more on my years growing up in Buckinghamshire, have a read of my article on Chesham.\n\nWant to go further afield? I have written tonnes of articles from across England and Scotland."
