The original Roman settlement of Londinium was sited on dry sand and gravel deposits close to the River Thames, with readily available water supplies from riverside springs. As the city grew, the abundant water supplies from the major Chalk groundwater aquifer supported the rapid population growth. A ready supply of locally worked aggregate and brick clay deposits aided the infrastructure development. The construction, and rapid expansion of the world’s first major underground railway system was made possible by the presence of the excellent tunnelling medium of the London Clay, and even today, the pattern of the London Underground network closely reflects the bedrock geology of the London Clay Formation.\n\nStudy of urban geology and the interplay between geology and the environment has become increasingly important as the world’s urban populations continue to increase. BGS has carried out detailed studies of the major urban conurbations of Britain for many years, and this study of the capital city is of particular importance.\n\nA variety of geohazards can affect development and it is important that consideration be given to these prior to construction work taking place. Careful planning, linked to an understanding of the engineering characteristics of the geological strata and its three-dimensional model, has provided early warning of many potentially difficult ground conditions, and thus assisted in finding solutions to specific hazards in advance of the development taking place. Major infrastructure projects which have benefited recently from the improved geological understanding of the London region include London Underground’s Jubilee Line extension and the Channel Tunnel Rail link Project.\n\nDavid A Falvey Director Kingsley Dunham Centre Keyworth Nottingham\n\nGeology of London\n\nThis book brings together information that results from research on the ground beneath the streets of London. It describes the geological strata, how they came to be there, and how they impinge on the life of those who live and work in the city, in its maintenance and sustainable development.\n\nThe development of London is intimately tied to the ground conditions. The original settlement was originally located at a crossing point on the River Thames in an area of dry land where sand and gravel banks were surrounded by rather boggy marshland. A ready supply of gravel and brick clay helped with the early infrastructure development, and much later the extensive underground tunnel network grew because of the ease of excavating the London Clay. Water was always readily available, initially from riverside springs and later, in larger volumes, from underground Chalk.\n\nThis explanation of the strata that underlie London gives an insight into the geological history of the last 500 million years. Over the past 200 years, boreholes have explored the deeper layers and countless geologists have systematically recorded the near-surface strata in quarries and excavations. The geological history includes periods of earth movement, inundations by the sea, the development of coastal mudflats and the effects of great ice ages.\n\nExploration for oil and gas in the North Sea has benefited from an understanding of the rocks beneath London, and their geological history. Effective use of water resources, efficient ground investigation for new buildings and infrastructure, and sustainable planning and development are all founded on the use of information about the condition and structure of the ground. This book provides the background information for the maintenance of good practice in these activities, and illustrates some aspects of the ground that have in the past caused difficulties.\n\nEnvironmental concerns such as the legacy of contamination, sea level rise as a consequence of global climate change, and the recycling of water are issues that will increase in importance in this century. Basic data, fundamental for dealing with these concerns are presented in this book, and on the associated 1:50 000 scale geological maps for London.\n\nSummary of the geological strata of the London district.

Frontispiece Generalised geology of the London district.\n\nChapter 1 Introduction\n\nThis memoir is a review of the current knowledge on the geology of London written to describe the four 1:50 000 scale geological maps that cover the district. It presents a regional overview with some specific examples, and for more detailed accounts the reader is referred to the earlier memoirs. A concise account of the geology of the wider region is given in Sumbler (1996), which includes a bibliography of key recent papers on the principal lithostratigraphical units and a section on applied geological issues in the London district.\n\nThe district is dominated by the greater London conurbation, reaching the outskirts of Watford in the north-west, and the expanding towns of Brentwood and Billericay in the north-east. The land alongside the Thames in the east of the district from Woolwich to Gravesend, known as the Thames Gateway, has been designated for major development in the 21st century. It has a legacy of past industrial use and some of the largest brown-field sites in Britain.\n\nThe geology and topography of the district are shown on the Frontispiece and in (Figure 1) respectively. The topography is dominated by Chalk downland in the south, and by a ridge that forms the edge of Epping Forest around Chigwell and Loughton in the north; rural Essex in the east is gently undulating and supports mixed farmland. The River Thames and its tributaries form the main drainage network. The river, tidal as far as Teddington Lock [TQ 168 715] in the west of the district, is associated with an alluvial tract at about 10 m above OD in the west and around sea level on the marshlands in the east. River terrace gravels rising to about 30 m OD underlie the gently sloping valley sides. Interfluves in the north-west consist of dissected London Clay, and some hills (up to 150 m OD) are capped by the Bagshot Formation and Quaternary gravels. In the north-east, the ground rises to a dissected plateau of till at about 100 m; other hills of similar height are capped by Bagshot Formation and Quaternary gravels. South of the Thames the ground rises gently across the London Clay on to the Chalk that forms the dip slope of the North Downs escarpment. The dip slope is covered, in part, by Clay-with-flints and is interrupted by subsidiary hills formed by outliers of London Clay and Thanet Sand. The crest of the escarpment reaches 200 m above OD in the south-east, the highest point in the district.\n\nHistory of survey\n\nThe first geological survey of the district was carried out by W Whitaker and others, on a scale of one inch to one mile (1:63 360). The maps, covering a larger area than in this account, were published on [TQ Old Series] sheets 1, 6, 7 and 8 between 1861 and 1868. A wealth of local detail on exposures in the area was published in the first memoir of the district (Whitaker, 1872). Drift deposits were mapped later and shown on new editions of the maps, published between 1869 and 1889. Information about the superficial deposits was incorporated in a revised memoir (Whitaker, 1889). Four special 1:63 360 scale maps covering London were published in 1903, and these made use of the first mapping at the scale of six inches to one mile (1:10 560) in part of the present district by T I Pocock and J A Howe. A memoir (Woodward, 1909) was also produced, and subsequently revised by C E N Bromehead and C P Chatwin for a second edition published in 1922.\n\nThe first systematic large-scale mapping (1:10 560) of the district on the County Series maps, was completed in 1922; C E N Bromehead, H G Dines, F H Edmunds and H Dewey were the principal geological surveyors. The mapping was compiled and published on the new component one-inch (1:63 360) map sheets for the district: North London (256), Romford (257), South London (270) and Dartford (271). The memoirs for the sheets, respectively, by Bromehead (1925), Dines and Edmunds (1925), Dewey and Bromehead (1921) and Dewey et al. (1924) describe information obtained from the detailed survey and supplement the data from the earlier memoirs. Minor amendments to the 1:10 560 scale maps, as a consequence of temporary exposures, were incorporated in later editions of the one-inch maps. A partial resurvey at 1:10 560 scale was made by F G Berry, T E Lawson and B S P Moorlock in south London from 1973 to 1980, as part of an environmental geological study funded by the former Department of the Environment, which also funded similar work in south-west Essex that entailed resurvey at 1:10 000 scale and the publication of a set of thematic applied geology maps (Moorlock and Smith, 1991). In 1992, a new project, known as LOCUS (London Computerised Underground and Surface) was initiated to produce digital 1:10 000 scale maps for the district, a comprehensive borehole database and three-dimensional models of the geology of London (Ellison et al., 1993). Between 1992 and 1996 Artificial deposits were added to all the maps, the North London and South London sheets were revised, and large areas of the Romford and Dartford sheets were resurveyed, largely by A J M Barron, R A Ellison, D H Jeffery, R T Mogdridge, B S P Moorlock, A Smith, P J Strange and I T Williamson. This work led to the publication between 1993 and 1998 of new 1:50 000 scale geological maps, available also in digital format. Further details on survey dates of specific sheets can be obtained on the BGS web site: www.bgs.ac.uk.\n\nInternal BGS Reports on various aspects of the geology have contributed to this memoir: notably by C Hallsworth on heavy minerals in the Palaeogene, J M Pearse, S J Kemp and V L Hards on the mineralogy and petrography of the Lambeth Group, G E Strong on the petrography of the Thanet Sand, R Harland on the Palaeogene dinoflagellates and M A Woods on the Chalk palaeontology.\n\nGeological history\n\nIn early Palaeozoic times, most of the district lay within the tectonic province known as the Midlands Microcraton, which consists of crystalline basement rocks of Neoproterozoic age overlain by a relatively thin cover (3000 m maximum) of early Proterozoic strata. The crystalline substrate comprises island-arc volcanic rocks which were erupted about 600 Ma and associated marginal basin, sedimentary rocks comparable to the Neoproterozoic strata of Charnwood Forest. The nearest proving of these rocks to the London district is in the Withycombe Farm Borehole about 75 km to north-west.\n\nThe oldest cratonic cover rocks are clastic sedimentary rocks of Cambrian and Tremadoc age. These are overlain by Silurian, shallow-water, shelf sediments and Devonian fluvial deposits derived from newly emergent Caledonide massifs of Wales and northern England. Ordovician strata are probably absent beneath the district.\n\nThe edge of the Midlands Microcraton lay in the north-east of the district. Beyond it, Silurian strata of turbiditic facies were deposited in relatively deep water, as proved in deep boreholes in East Anglia and north-east Kent (Molyneux, 1991; Sumbler, 1996). The Palaeozoic cratonic cover rocks were deformed in Early Devonian (Emsian) times by the Acadian phase of the Caledonide orogeny, which was caused by the collision of the Armorican Microcontinent with the Caledonian Terrane (Soper et al., 1987). North-east of the Midlands Microcraton, in the area now known as the Eastern England Caledonides, this deformation was intense, as shown by Silurian strata proved in boreholes in East Anglia that are folded and show a penetrative cleavage (Bullard, 1940; Pharaoh et al., 1987; Woodcock, 1991).\n\nThe succeeding middle and late Devonian strata rest unconformably on strata of the Acadian fold-belt. They consist mainly of nonmarine clastic sedimentary rocks intercalated with marine deposits laid down during incursions from the south by the Rheic Ocean. During Carboniferous times the uplifted Devonian succession became part of a new stable high, the Anglo-Brabant Massif that stretched from the Welsh Borders to Belgium. Foreland extensional basins developed within the massif as a consequence of the northward advance of the Variscan orogenic front. These basins received clastic sediment eroded from the Massif (Besly and Kelling, 1988) which accumulated in large deltas to form coal measures and red beds of Upper Carboniferous age. The nearest coal measures to the London district are in the Oxfordshire–Berkshire area and east Kent. Illite crystallinity values for the Lower Palaeozoic strata beneath London indicate former burial beneath 4000 to 5000 m of sediment, possibly including Coal Measures, which has been subsequently removed by erosion.\n\nThe main east–west orientated Variscan orogenic front lay to the south of the district, although subparallel linear gravity anomalies in the district may be due to peripheral Variscan thrust faults in the Palaeozoic basement rocks (Figure 42) and (Figure 43) (Keary and Rabae, 1996).\n\nThroughout much of the Mesozoic, the district continued to be a stable upland, now known as the London Platform. North–south extension during Permian and Triassic times resulted in the formation of the Weald Basin to the south, which received sediment derived from the London Platform. The bounding structures of this basin had a dominant influence on all subsequent events in the district. From Early Jurassic to Early Cretaceous times, there was further extensional subsidence in the Weald Basin, on reactivated Variscan thrust structures (Chadwick, 1986), including the Addington Thrust (Figure 2). North of this structure, the London district remained as a stable area covered by shallow shelf seas, but lying quite close to land. Jurassic to Early Cretaceous strata record this shallow marine environment but also indicate periods of emergence from time to time with the deposition of nonmarine sediments.\n\nThe latest part of the Jurassic Period and the early part of the Cretaceous, sometimes referred to as ‘Late Cimmerian’, was a time of intense tectonic activity in Europe. Late Cimmerian earth movements were associated with the northward extension of a zone of ocean-floor spreading that caused the gradual opening of the north Atlantic, and led to uplift of the London district, retreat of the sea and extensive erosion of the Jurassic strata, uncovering once more the Palaeozoic basement rocks. Subsidence of the fault-bounded Weald Basin to the south continued, and sediments derived form the London Platform accumulated in terrestrial environments to form the Wealden Group. In the early Aptian, the sea once again flooded the London Platform initiating deposition of a post-rift sequence of shallow marine sediments, beginning with the Lower Greensand Group and culminating with the deposition of the Gault and Chalk during a prolonged period of high sea level.\n\nIn late Cretaceous times, this region was affected to some extent by the tectonic events that produced the Alpine mountain chain in southern Europe. An early phase of late Cretaceous to early Palaeogene inversion caused gentle folding and erosion of the Chalk. The overlying Palaeogene sediments were laid down in shallow marine and coastal environments. The main Alpine compressional event occurred in late Oligocene to mid-Miocene times, when the London Basin, a broad synclinorium, was developed. Smaller folds, notably the Greenwich Anticline (Figure 42), were caused by inversion of the long-established, deep-seated faults at the southern edge of the London Platform.\n\nFor most of the period between the late Eocene and Quaternary, about 40 million years, the district was land, and pre-existing deposits were weathered and dissected. The sea may have covered the district temporarily in Pliocene times, and remnants of coastal gravel deposits now cap the highest ground. A new drainage pattern was established in the early Quaternary. At this time, rivers flowed across the district from the south and south-west towards a major river, the precursor of the River Thames that flowed from Wales, across the Midlands and East Anglia to the North Sea.\n\nWhen great ice sheets advanced to cover much of Britain as far south as the outskirts of the London district, about 500 000 years ago, the river system was irreversibly changed and the Thames was diverted to its present-day valley. The succeeding river terrace deposits laid down in the valley are well preserved. The main periods of gravel deposition and intervening phases of downcutting took place during cold episodes when rivers were swollen with glacial meltwaters and erosion was more intense. Finally, the most recent deposits, river alluvium and tidal river sediments, have been deposited in the last 8000 years or so, during an interval of relatively low river discharge and periodic flooding.\n\nChapter 2 Concealed strata\n\nPalaeozoic\n\nCambrian and Tremadoc clastic deposits, proved in boreholes in Buckinghamshire and Hertfordshire (Molyneux, 1991), probably extend beneath the north-west of the district, where they are overstepped by Upper Devonian strata (Figure 2). Rocks of Ordovician age, such as the Caradoc strata proved in Bobbing Borehole, 19 km to the east, and Arenig strata proved by Strat-A1 Borehole, 18 km to the south-west, are probably absent in the district (Smith, 1987).\n\nNonmarine Silurian strata of PÅídolí age were proved in the Streatham Common Borehole (Table 1); (Table 2), and in the north-west turbidites of Silurian age may be present, similar to those proved in deep boreholes in East Anglia and north-east Kent (Molyneux, 1991; Sumbler, 1996). However, most of the Palaeozoic strata known in the district are nonmarine sandstone of Devonian age; the thickest proved succession is 509 m in Willesden No. 1 Borehole. Lower Devonian (Emsian) sedimentary rocks were proved in Beckton Gasworks Borehole, and other boreholes prove Middle to Upper Devonian rocks of Givetian or Frasnian age (Table 2).\n\nCarboniferous Limestone is proved in the Warlingham Borehole, south of the Addington Thrust (Figure 2) identified as a Variscan structure (Keary and Rabae, 1996).\n\nTriassic\n\nStrata of Triassic age are probably not present in the district, but thin sequences are recorded in the Weald Basin to the south, including conglomeratic limestone and red and grey mottled mudstone proved in the Warlingham Borehole that was tentatively regarded as Triassic – Jurassic in age (Worssam and Ivimey-Cook, 1971).\n\nJurassic\n\nMovement on the major growth faults that bounded the Weald Basin governed the distribution and thickness of strata of Jurassic age. They occur only in the south of the district (Table 3); (Figure 3) and consist of mudstone with some interbedded limestone and sandstone. The deposits thicken appreciably south of grid line 70; 12 m were proved in the Streatham Common Borehole compared with 1051.6 m in Warlingham Borehole, 15 km to the south (Table 3). This change in thickness is possibly due to syndepositional growth faulting. A similar pattern is illustrated by seismic reflection data to the south of the region (Whittaker, 1985). In general terms, successive Jurassic formations overlap farther onto the London Platform. Some of the younger formations may have originally extended right across it and were removed by contemporary erosion during periods of low sea level and uplift in late Jurassic or early Cretaceous times. The main variation in this pattern is due to syndepositional movement on faults bounding a small graben beneath the eastern part of the Thames estuary (Figure 3) where Oxford Clay is preserved but younger Jurassic strata have been removed by erosion (Owen, 1971).\n\nCretaceous\n\nEarth movements during the latest part of the Jurassic period and the early part of the Cretaceous resulted in the elevation of the London Platform high above sea level, and further subsidence of the Weald Basin to the south. Jurassic strata were eroded from the platform, exposing the Palaeozoic basement rocks, and accumulated in the basin to form the Wealden Group (Table 4). Mud and sand were deposited in an environment of swamp with lakes and lagoons of varying salinity and crossed by meandering river channels. The Wealden Group occurs along the southern boundary of the region, and is proved in boreholes at Addington, Hartley Bottom and Russell Hill. The succession, largely of interbedded mudstone and sandstone, is 256.6 m thick in the Warlingham Borehole (Worssam et al., 1971), considerably thinner than in the central Weald Basin, although several faults noted in the borehole core may indicate that part of the succession has been faulted out.\n\nRising sea level in Aptian times flooded the Weald Basin and the southern margins of the London Platform, so that the Lower Greensand Group overlaps the Wealden Group to rest on Jurassic strata (sheets 270, 271). The Lower Greensand occurs in the south of the district, thickening south-west into the Weald Basin. It also occurs in a graben (Owen, 1971) beneath the Thames estuary in the east of the district. At Warlingham the Lower Greensand Group is 94 m thick and includes strata correlated with all formations recognised in the thicker successions in the Weald Basin. At the base the Atherfield Clay Formation is about 7.5 m thick; it passes up into the Hythe Formation (25.5 m thick) of Aptian age, which consists of calcareous greenish grey sand, sandstone and thin sandy mudstone with chert at the top. The succeeding Sandgate Formation rests disconformably on the Hythe Formation marking a marine transgression in the nutfieldiensis Zone. The Sandgate Formation (1.3 m thick) comprises fine-grained glauconitic sand that is characteristically more argillaceous elsewhere in the Weald. The succeeding Folkestone Formation (59.7 m thick) comprises coarse-grained sand of jacobi Zone age. This is interpreted as sandwave deposits like those exposed in the Weald between Reigate and Sevenoaks. Although only small amounts of coarse-grained sand were recovered from the Warlingham Borehole, the gamma-ray logs suggest a relatively uniform sand lithology throughout.\n\nNorth of Warlingham, (for example in the Richmond, Addington, Russell Hill and Carshalton boreholes), the Lower Greensand is thinner, and the constituent formations cannot be identified with certainty. The sequences are dominated by sand that is variably glauconitic and calcareous with bioturbation in places. These lithologies resemble aspects of the Atherfield, Hythe and Sandgate formations rather than the Folkestone Formation. For example in the Richmond Borehole, 3.2 m of hard, grey, calcareous, glauconitic, shelly sandstone with granules and pebbles of chert may correlate with the Hythe Formation or possibly the Bargate Formation that occurs at the base of the Sandgate Formation in northern parts of the Weald. The Gault Formation was deposited following a marked deepening of the sea in mid-Albian times. It rests disconformably on the Lower Greensand, overstepping northwards onto Jurassic and then Palaeozoic rocks and extending across the entire London Platform, the earliest Cretaceous formation to do so. The Gault Formation is 50 to 70 m thick in most of the district, but ranges from 40 to 94 m, although there is no obvious regional trend (Figure 4). The formation consists mainly of grey mudstone, with variable amounts of silt, in which primary bedding structures are not clearly preserved because of bioturbation. Small, greyish buff concretions or nodules rich in calcium phosphate may be developed around fossils or burrows and seams of bluish black, commonly phosphatic, pebbles and reworked fossils mark non-sequences; these represent debris winnowed from the sediment during periods of erosive current action.\n\nA distinction is made in some boreholes between dark grey mudstone of the Lower Gault, which is of mid-Albian age, and paler, more calcareous mudstone of Upper Gault, of late Albian age (Figure 4). The Lower Gault (less than 10 m thick) is known in detail only in boreholes in the Thames estuary (Owen, 1971) and is absent in the north where it was removed by erosion in late Albian times. In the Thames estuary boreholes, the basal 2.5 m or so consist of glauconitic grey mudstone, gritty in places, with a pebbly and indurated basal bed, and black phosphatic nodules throughout. They are succeeded by about 6 m of medium to dark grey and fawn grey mudstone, which is burrowed and shelly in places and contains seams of phosphatic nodules. A short period of tectonic activity during the earliest part of the late Albian gave rise to slight uplift of the London Platform and movement on the faults that trend east– west across the district (Figure 3). This led to the removal of the Lower Gault from the northern part of the district (Figure 4) The succeeding Upper Gault is between 48 and 52 m thick. It consists of mid to pale grey shelly mudstone, glauconitic in the top 2.5 m, and with a bed (2.44 m thick) containing ‘small black phosphatic nodules’ in the middle of the succession (Owen, 1971).\n\nThe Upper Greensand Formation consists of glauconitic, calcareous fine-grained sandstone and siltstone that was deposited during the late Albian. It is present in the central part of the district, but elsewhere it passes laterally into the Upper Gault or is absent having been removed by erosion prior to deposition of the Chalk Group (Figure 4). The maximum thickness is 16.7 m in the Warlingham Borehole. In some borehole records the Glauconitic Marl, which marks the base of the succeeding Chalk Group, may have been mistakenly classified as Upper Greensand.\n\nChapter 3 Upper Cretaceous: Chalk Group\n\nThe main outcrop of the Chalk Group is on the scarp and dip slopes of the North Downs in the south of the district. A small outcrop around Watford, in the north-west of the district, lies on the dip slope of the Chiltern Hills. The typical thickness of Chalk Group is between about 175 and 200 m, with a general thinning of about 20 m from west to east (Figure 5). This is a relatively thin succession compared to over 400 m in the Hampshire Basin and East Anglia.\n\nThe BGS borehole at Fetcham Mill, near Leatherhead [TQ 1581 5650] provides the most useful information on the full chalk succession in the London region. (Wood in Murray, 1986; Mortimore and Pomerol, 1987). It is reasonably typical of the Chalk Group of the North Downs, although compared with other locations in the district the Lower Chalk is anomalously thin. The Fetcham Mill succession varies from that of the Chiltern Hills in several important aspects that are influenced by the depositional history of the chalk. Deeper water in the south-east led to more continuous sedimentation than in the north-west, where there were more breaks in sedimentation and development of more prominent indurated and mineralised chalk horizons, known as hardgrounds (Figure 5). This is particularly apparent in the Lewes Chalk in the north-west of the region, where the ‘Chalk Rock’ and ‘Top Rock’ occur, but south-eastwards these pass laterally into a thicker succession containing marls (calcareous mudstones), thin hardgrounds and nodular chalks.\n\nThere is an imbalance of information on the Chalk Group in the London district. The Upper Chalk is well documented at outcrop and in exposures in north Kent and south Essex, but the Middle and Lower Chalk stratigraphy is largely inferred from published information on the North Downs (see Robinson, 1986), including sections in quarries in the River Medway valley. In the majority of the London district, where the Chalk is concealed beneath Palaeogene deposits, information is available only from site investigation boreholes that penetrate the topmost 20 m or so.\n\nCorrelation of the subsurface chalk succession has been achieved using electrical resistivity logs (Murray 1986). In general terms these logs discriminate well between clay-rich intervals (marls; see below) and hard beds (nodular chalk and hardgrounds), which give high and low resistivity values respectively. However, the presence of numerous, closely spaced, flint-bearing horizons may give an irregular and unpredicatable signature that can be interpreted as either marl or hardground. Wood (in Murray, 1986), aware of this potential problem, cautioned against over interpretation of downhole logs and placing reliance on detailed correlations using them without good borehole core control such as is provided by the Fetcham Mill Borehole. Using this log as a standard, correlation of other selected resistivity logs is shown in (Figure 6).\n\nNomenclature\n\nShortly after the completion of mapping in the London district, Bristow et al. (1997) formally subdivided the Chalk Group, recognising up to ten members in the stratigraphically more complete succession in the Wessex Basin. Subsequently, Rawson et al. (2001) re-assigned these members to formational status, and divided the Chalk Group into two subgroups: the Grey Chalk Subgroup and White Chalk Subgroup. The boundary between these is defined at the base of a widespread clay-rich horizon, the Plenus Marls Member (Table 5). This represents the latest step in the progressive refinement of Chalk stratigraphy that has occurred over the last 20 years. Correlation formerly relied on traditional biozones that may include up to 80 m of strata, whereas current resolution, based on a combination of detailed biostratigraphy and lithostratigraphy, defines units of less than 5 m in much of the Chalk. Integration of the new detailed lithostratigraphy with the established biozonation (Table 5) means that former exposures from which fossils were collected can now be referenced to a lithostratigraphical framework. Many of the formations now defined correspond closely with the stratigraphical subdivisions recognised by Mortimore (1986) in the Chalk of the South Downs, and largely supersede the separate stratigraphy erected by Robinson (1986) for the Chalk of the North Downs.\n\nIn the London district, formations and their component members are mapped using a combination of topographical features, field brash and biostratigraphical data. However, because of local problems in mapping some of the subdivisions originally defined by Bristow et al. (1997), and partly because the revisions of Rawson et al. (2001) postdate work in the London district, a slightly modified succession is described herein and depicted on the published maps (sheets 256, 257, 270, 271).\n\nThe generalised Chalk Group succession, shown in (Figure 7), includes several distinctive beds recognised in exposures and boreholes that are valuable for correlation. The locations of key successions, and their stratigraphical range, is also shown on (Figure 7), and includes some that are outside the district but which are essential for correlation or as good reference exposures.\n\nLithology\n\nChalk is typically a very fine-grained white limestone. It consists predominantly of the disaggregated skeletal remains (coccoliths) of tiny planktonic algae, composed of almost pure calcium carbonate in the form of low magnesian calcite. The lower part contains up to 30 per cent clay and includes intercalated clay-rich horizons (marls) and spongiferous limestones.\n\nLayers of flint generally provide the most prominent indication of bedding, and are a conspicuous feature of the higher part of the Chalk Group where they occur at regular intervals. Flint layers are most abundant in the upper part of the Lewes Chalk where they average one every metre. Flint is composed of silica, in the form of microscopic quartz amorphous, derived from the dissolved skeletons of siliceous sponges and microfossils (radiolarians and diatoms) that inhabited the Chalk sea. Silica preferentially replaced the sediment infill of animal burrows some distance below the sea bed while the chalk was still being deposited (Clayton, 1986).\n\nSeveral types of flint are recognised. The most common is a branching, nodular horn-flint with shapes reflecting the shape of original burrow structures produced by soft-bodied organisms and hard-bodied organisms such as crustaceans (e.g. Thalassinoides-type burrows) (Clayton, 1986). These are up to 0.2 m thick and 1 m in length. Other beds contain elongated nodular flints 40 to 50 mm in diameter, some forming an interconnected branching network through a thickness of 3 to 4 m of chalk (for example the Lewes Tubular Flints in the Lewes Chalk). Laterally continuous or semi-continuous tabular flints, 10 to 100 mm thick (for example Whitaker’s 3-inch Flint in the Upper Chalk), are typical in homogeneous, well-bedded chalk in which burrows are either absent or poorly defined. Layers such as this, which have a distinctive appearance and are geographically extensive, are valuable for correlation. Thin sheets of flint a few tens of millimetres or less in thickness, commonly with a medial cavity, are discordant or subparallel to bedding. They are inferred to have formed along fracture and shear surfaces developed by compressive stress in the Late Cretaceous (Mortimer and Pomerol, 1997).\n\nClay-rich, calcareous beds, generally described as ‘marls’, are a conspicuous feature particularly of the Lower Chalk. The marls are typically medium to pale grey in colour and occur either as discrete beds or more diffuse concentrations of anastamosing thin marl wisps. Marls in the Lower Chalk are typically up to 0.6 m thick (Ditchfield and Marshall, 1989); those higher in the succession are generally 0.1 to 0.15 m thick. In exposures, the marls are darker in colour than the adjacent chalk beds and where weathered have a rather flaky texture imparted by primary lamination. At outcrop they are preferentially vegetated on account of their relatively high moisture content, and in the subcrop give sharp responses in borehole resistivity and gamma-ray profiles, making them important for the long distance correlation of chalk successions (Murray, 1986; Mortimer and Pomerol, 1987). Some marls show a distinct trace element geochemistry (Wray and Gale, 1993), which is also potentially valuable for correlation. Relatively thick beds of marl in the lower part of the Chalk were probably deposited when carbonate sedimentation was suppressed (Ditchfield and Marshall, 1989). The origin of the thinner marls in the higher part of the Chalk is unresolved, but some are interpreted as decomposed volcanic ash (Wray, 1995; Wray and Wood, 1995) while others are thought to be the result of an enhanced influx of land-derived sediment.\n\nAt some levels in the Chalk, hard nodular beds that commonly contain fossil sponges are characteristic (Figure 7). The beds have a lumpy texture and may be stained red or brown due to penecontemporaneous oxidation on the sea floor, rather than subaerial weathering. Nodular beds are thought to have formed in response to lower rates of sedimentation associated with a eustatic fall in sea level, tectonic uplift, or proximity to sea floor highs or basin margins (Hancock, 1989).\n\nHorizons of highly indurated nodular chalk, which are locally iron stained, glauconitised and phosphatised, are referred to as hardgrounds. These formed by enhanced sea-floor cementation associated with periods of nondeposition (Hancock, 1989). Hardgrounds are well developed at or close to basin margins, but in progressively deeper water they pass into nodular beds and eventually become almost imperceptible ‘omission surfaces’, recognisable only by weakly developed iron staining.\n\nMacrofossils are rather rare in the Chalk. Ammonites, used as the basis of standard zonations elsewhere in the Mesozoic, are particularly uncommon and poorly preserved, except in the lower beds. The standard biozonation of the Chalk has developed, therefore, using a combination of ammonites, brachiopods, bivalves, crinoids and echinoids. Inoceramid bivalves have proved to be highly effective in Chalk biostratigraphy, and form the basis for several newly proposed zonal schemes (Jarvis and Woodroof, 1984; Gale, 1995, 1996). Microfossil biozonations for the Chalk (Carter and Hart, 1977; Hart et al., 1989) can be indirectly related to the macrofaunal zones, and are valuable where other faunal data is absent or ambiguous.\n\nConcentrations of the trace fossil Zoophycos are observed at several horizons, and are locally useful for correlation. In unweathered exposures, they appear as dark grey lenses of marl a few millimetres thick, and represent a two-dimensional section through the spirally developed detrital feeding trace of a soft-bodied animal.\n\nLower Chalk\n\nThe Lower Chalk, 65 to 70 m thick, crops out in a tract of gently rising ground less than a kilometre wide at the foot of the North Downs escarpment where it overlies the Gault. In the Warlingham [TQ 3476 5719] and Fetcham Mill boreholes it is about 60 m thick (and overlies Upper Greensand), and in boreholes at Luddesdown over 70 m [TQ 6615 6588]. About 75 m of Lower Chalk are interpreted from the records of a borehole near Watford [TQ 1195 9577].\n\nThe lowest bed, the Glauconitic Marl, is soft grey marl rich in glauconite and phosphatic pebbles, typically less than 1 m thick. It is overlain by rhythmic alternations of marl and hard chalk that comprise the Chalk Marl (Jukes-Browne and Hill, 1903). These beds are approximately equivalent to the West Melbury Marly Chalk of Bristow et al. (1997). They were formerly exposed in the large quarry at Halling [TQ 694 645] in the Medway valley. Isotopic studies suggest that the rhythms in the Chalk Marl are due to the effect of regular climatic oscillations on patterns of sedimentation (Ditchfield and Marshall, 1989), probably induced by cyclical changes in the Earth’s orbital parameters (Leary et al., 1989; Gale, 1995).\n\nThe higher part of the Lower Chalk succession in the North Downs corresponds to the Zig Zag Chalk of Bristow et al. (1997). It consists of slightly marly, massively bedded chalk, locally known as the Grey Chalk, overlain by soft, white chalk (the ‘White Bed’ of Jukes-Browne and Hill, 1903). The Grey Chalk and ‘White Bed’ are poorly fossiliferous, but close to their junction in the North Downs a 2 m-thick unit of bioclastic chalk contains large specimens of the zonal ammonite Acanthoceras jukesbrownei. The highest beds of the Lower Chalk are alternating greenish marls and marly chalk, typically 3 m thick (Wood in Sumbler, 1996), named the Plenus Marls after the belemnite Actinocamax plenus. In the North Downs, the Plenus Marls normally overlie a burrowed erosion surface. They form the lower part of the exposed succession in Halling quarry [TQ 694 645] where they contain large specimens of the oyster Pycnodonte vesiculare. Up to eight beds, some separated by erosion surfaces have been recognised (Jefferies, 1961, 1963). Jeans et al. (1991) have suggested that they were laid down during a period of enhanced erosion at a time of falling sea level. The Plenus Marls form a widespread marker in southern England and northern France and give a sharply defined, low-value spike in resistivity logs (Figure 6) and a peak in gamma-ray logs.\n\nMiddle Chalk\n\nThe Middle Chalk is subdivided into the Holywell Chalk overlain by the New Pit Chalk. Traditionally it has been defined as the strata between the top of the Plenus Marls and the base of the Chalk Rock. As the Chalk Rock is not present in the London district, the top of the Middle Chalk is defined at the appearance of the feature-forming hard, nodular chalk at the base of the Lewes Chalk (Figure 7); (Table 5).\n\nHolywell Chalk Member\n\nThe Holywell Chalk crops out at the base of the North Downs escarpment in the south-east of the district. It is between 13 and 18 m thick at Halling, and about 14 m are proved in boreholes in the southern and eastern parts of the district, including those at Fetcham Mill and Warlingham.\n\nAs a general rule flint does not occur in the Holywell Chalk. Anastomosing marl wisps, locally concentrated into horizons several tens of millimetres thick, are common. The basal few metres are typically indurated and nodular, and give rise to a conspicuous topographical feature above the much softer Plenus Marls. They contain the bivalve Inoceramus ex gr. pictus and acmes of the straight-shelled ammonite Sciponoceras (Mortimore, 1986; Gale, 1996). In previous accounts these basal beds were known as the Melbourn Rock (Jukes-Browne and Hill, 1903; Dewey et al., 1924). The remainder of the Holywell Chalk is less indurated, nodular and has a gritty texture caused by locally abundant, broken shells of the inoceramid bivalve Mytiloides. In borehole resistivity logs, the hard basal beds form a sharp spike and the entire unit gives relatively high values (Figure 6).\n\nThe best exposures in Holywell Chalk are in the pit at Halling [TQ 694 645] and the track at Court Farm [TQ 6891 6425].\n\nNew Pit Chalk\n\nThe New Pit Chalk forms much of the North Downs scarp face. It also crops out in the upper reaches of valleys flowing north on the dip slope of the North Downs. The thickness around Luddesdown [TQ 67 66] and Stansted [TQ 61 62] is 25 to 40 m and at Shoreham [TQ 52 62] 35 to 50 m. Boreholes at Winchester House in central London [TQ 3302 8142] and at Chingford [TQ 3740 9212] prove 46 m and 41 m of New Pit Chalk, respectively.\n\nIn contrast to the Holywell Chalk, the New Pit Chalk is softer, smooth textured and more massively bedded. The basal beds contain thin-shelled Mytiloides fragments that are usually poorly preserved chalky moulds. Common fossils in the remainder of the New Pit Chalk are T. lata, the bivalves Inoceramus cuvieri and I. lamarcki, and the echinoid Conulus subrotundus. Small flints occur near the base (Glyndebourne Flints of Mortimore and Pomerol, 1986) and top of the succession, but the greater part is flint free. Marl seams and marly chalk horizons, up to 0.1 m thick, are common throughout. The most widely correlated are the two New Pit Marls (Mortimore, 1986) and the Glynde Marls (Figure 7). The New Pit Marl 2 and Glynde Marls are exposed in the quarry at Dean Farm [TQ 696 657].\n\nIn borehole geophysical logs there is a sharp drop in resistivity values at the base of the New Pit Chalk. A further decline generally occurs for some metres above this horizon (Figure 6), punctuated by frequent sharp, low value resistivity-spikes representing marl beds. Similar profiles are identified in numerous boreholes across southern England (Mortimore and Pomerol, 1987).\n\nThe lower beds of the New Pit Chalk are exposed in the large quarry at Halling [TQ 694 645] and probably form the greater part of the mostly inaccessible faces in the abandoned quarries at Whorn’s Place North Halling [TQ 7050 6610] and Wingate Wood [TQ 693 651] (Dibley, 1918). A track ascending the main escarpment above Upper Halling [TQ 6895 6448] to [TQ 6895 6460] shows sporadic exposures, but the best currently available section is in a newly opened quarry at Dean Farm [TQ 696 657] near Cuxton, just east of the district, where the top 22 m of New Pit Chalk and the contact with the overlying Lewes Chalk were exposed.\n\nUpper Chalk\n\nIn the London district, the lower part of the Upper Chalk is mapped as the Lewes Chalk. The remainder is undivided, but includes strata equivalent to the Seaford Chalk, overlain by beds equivalent to the Margate Chalk and Newhaven Chalk (Robinson, 1986; Bristow et al., 1997; (Table 5)). The maximum total thickness is in the order of 100 m.\n\nDewey et al. (1924) appear to have partly relied on a distinctive molluscan fauna, known as the Reussianum Fauna (named after the ammonite Hyphantoceras reussianum) to infer the base of the Upper Chalk. However, this fauna apparently occurs below the Bridgewick Marl 1 (Figure 7) in railway cuttings between Coulsdon and Purley, and possibly also in the basal M. cortestudinarium Zone (Davis, 1926, 1929). It is therefore concluded now that the presence of the fauna is an unreliable marker for indicating the base of the Upper Chalk.\n\nLewes Chalk\n\nThe Lewes Chalk crops out mainly in the south-east of the district, at or near the top of the North Downs escarpment, and in the upper reaches of northward-trending valleys around Luddesdown [TQ 67 66], Meopham Green [TQ 64 65], South Street [TQ 640 635], Stansted [TQ 61 62] West Kingsdown [TQ 570 625] and Shoreham [TQ 52 62]. It forms a positive feature on the sides of many of these valleys; the best example of this is in the Darent valley near Eynsford [TQ 540 655] where the higher beds of the Lewes Chalk also give rise to a narrow bench feature. Farther west, it occurs in valley floors between Pratt’s Bottom [TQ 47 62] and west of Biggin Hill [TQ 40 61], and in an inlier in the floor of Swanscombe Western Quarry [TQ 5808 7344]. It may outcrop also in the north-west around Watford and Bushey (Jukes-Browne and Hill, 1904) but has not been mapped.\n\nAt outcrop, the Lewes Chalk is generally 25 to 35 m thick, but thins to 20 m locally around Luddesdown and Meopham Green, and is 35 to 40 m in the Darent valley. Geophysical logs indicate that the thickness ranges from 27 to 40 m.\n\nThe Lewes Chalk is characteristically hard, nodular, locally iron stained and flinty. Marl seams, up to 0.1 m thick, occur throughout, but are especially conspicuous in the lower beds. Hardgrounds occur locally, and at least some of the thickness variation within the Lewes Chalk may be caused by condensed sequences or depositional breaks at these horizons. Layers of nodular flints are regularly spaced throughout the succession, becoming distinctly carious (i.e. with abundant cavities) in the higher part. At some horizons these flints almost interlock to produce laterally continuous bands. Conspicuously large nodular flints, with dimensions exceeding 0.2 m are developed locally. Thin sheets of flint subparallel or strongly discordant to bedding also occur.\n\nThe Lewes Chalk is richly fossiliferous with sponges, brachiopods, bivalves and echinoids. Inoceramid bivalves and the echinoid Micraster are especially important for biostratigraphical correlation. In the higher part of the Lewes Chalk, the occurrence of the inoceramid Cremnoceramus near the junction of the S. plana and M. cortestudinarium zones can be used to identify the base of the Coniacian Stage (Kauffman et al., 1996).\n\nSeveral of the marls and hardgrounds are useful for correlating the Lewes Chalk. The Southerham Marl 1 is 0.1 m thick with a plastic texture and is characterised by the acme occurrence of the foraminifer Labyrinthidoma (= Coskinophragma of Mortimore, 1986). It is underlain by the Southerham Flints (Mortimore, 1986) a bed characterised by a mixture of relatively large burrow-form nodular flints and smaller finger-like flints. They are exposed in the higher part of the Dean Farm Quarry [TQ 696 657].\n\nAlthough not all are exposed in the district, the Southerham, Caburn, Bridgewick and Lewes marls of Sussex (Mortimore, 1986) have been traced across the region using geophysical logs (Figure 6); the Lewes Marl is known particularly for the occurrence of the large morphotype of Micraster leskei.\n\nThe ‘Lewes Tubular Flints’ (Mortimore, 1986) are vertically elongated burrow-form flints, typically with a central rod of silica surrounded by soft chalk. When weathered or broken open, the core is easily removed and the result is a hollow tube of flint. This is a good marker bed, exposed in Dean Farm Quarry, and identified in a borehole beneath the Thames [TQ 5911 7639] between Thurrock and Swanscombe.\n\nThe apparently localised and weakly developed Swanscombe Hardground occurs about 6.5 m below the top of the Lewes Chalk, at possibly the same stratigraphical position as the thicker Cornhill Hardgrounds on the Kent coast (Robinson, 1986).\n\nIn the top 5 m of the Lewes Chalk, two thin marl horizons about 2 m apart are underlain by chalk with Zoophycos, tubular flints and orange-stained spongebearing beds. The succession is correlated with the Shoreham Marls, Beachy Head Zoophycos and Beachy Head Sponge Beds (Mortimore, 1986). It is exposed in Swanscombe Western Quarry, and identified in boreholes in the Thurrock–Swanscombe area, at Swanscombe Marshes [TQ 6040 7534]; [TQ 5997 7593] and Islington [TQ 3376 8495].\n\nThe beds containing the Shoreham Marls appear to pass laterally into the Rochester Hardground (Robinson, 1986) that has been recorded at the Rose and Crown Pit [TQ 337 594] near Croydon and Martin Earle’s Pit in the Medway valley [TQ 722 679].\n\nUpper Chalk undivided\n\nThe youngest Chalk in the region, including most of the chalk outcrops and all the chalk directly beneath the Palaeogene deposits, is mapped as Upper Chalk undivided. The most extensive outcrops are in the north-west and south-east of the region. There are also smaller outcrops in the cores of shallow anticlines at Lewisham [TQ 375 760], Chiselhurst [TQ 43 70], on the south bank of the Thames between Greenwich and Erith, and in the Grays–Purfleet area [TQ 55 78] to [TQ 61 79].\n\nThe succession in the Upper Chalk is particularly well known in the south-east of the district because of the extensive exposures in numerous large quarries. These are situated along the length of the Purfleet–Grays outcrop, in the Cray valley and along the south bank of the Thames and between Dartford and Gravesend. Many of the quarries are now abandoned but some still provide extensive sections, the best of them at Swanscombe (Blue Water Park) [TQ 5808 7344], Northfleet [TQ 6207 7394] and [TQ 6321 7410], Grays [TQ 605 795] and Purfleet [TQ 573 786]. Smaller exposures can be examined at Knockholt [TQ 4830 6300] and Farningham Road Station [TQ 5545 6920]. At Chiselhurst Caves [TQ 4322 6957], Camden Park, near Bromley [TQ 4275 7015], and Upper Ifield [TQ 6834 7124], the chalk was formerly worked in underground excavations; those at Chiselhurst are open to the public. Knowledge of the succession at depth is based on cored boreholes, principally between Stratford and Barking, and at London Docklands and the Thames Barrage.The thickness is 59 m in the Grays–Purfleet area (Figure 8), an estimated 50 m in the vicinity of Hook Green [TQ 614 705], 60 to 70 m between Orpington [TQ 45 65], Swanley [TQ 51 68], Hartley [TQ 61 68] and Cobham [TQ 67 69], and 50 m in the Fetcham Mill Borehole.\n\nFirm to soft, non-nodular chalk with common large nodular, tabular and semitabular flints is the typical lithology, but the uppermost beds locally include soft, poorly flinty chalk. Beds rich in the sheet-like shell fragments of the inoceramid bivalve Platyceramus occur at intervals throughout most of the succession. In the lower beds, conspicuous concentrations of thick shell fragments also include the inoceramid bivalve Volviceramus involutus. Thin marls occur in the lower part of the succession, but are absent at higher levels. At least one hardground occurs locally near the top of the succession (see below).\n\nThe succession as a whole has relatively low resistivity values on geophysical logs; the profiles are typically spiky, mainly caused by flints, but too variable to allow detailed correlation between boreholes. A drop in average resistivity, accompanied by a reduction in the amplitude and frequency of spikes, occurs towards the top of the succession (Figure 6). It corresponds to the appearance of softer chalk, which in the Fetcham Mill Borehole has a higher water content than the underlying beds (Gray, 1965).\n\nThe Belle Tout Marls (Mortimore, 1986) are a series of thin marl seams in brittle chalk in the bottom 8 m of the succession, equating with Robinson’s (1986) Hope Point Marls and Otty Bottom Marl. They have been seen at Swanscombe, Knockholt and in two boreholes at Swanscombe Marshes.\n\nThree distinctive flint beds have proved useful for correlation between exposures and in shallow boreholes in the south-east of the region. None has been identified in the north and west. The lowest is the Seven Sisters Flint, a key marker identified in the North and South Downs and northern France (Mortimore, 1986; Mortimore and Pomerol, 1987). In the North Downs, Robinson (1986) named this flint the Oldstairs Bay Flint, and Bailey et al. (1983) referred to it in east Kent as the East Cliff Semitabular Flint. It crops out about 12 m above the top of the Lewes Chalk at Swanscombe Western Quarry [TQ 5808 7344], occurs in the cutting near Knockholt Station [TQ 4830 6300], and was formerly exposed in the deepest levels of the Pinden landfill site [TQ 5935 6970] (Figure 8). It is a massive rusty, carious semitabular flint about 0.2 m thick and containing inoceramid shell fragments. The chalk adjacent to, and especially below, the Seven Sisters Flint contains abundant, thick-shelled fragments of Platyceramus and Volviceramus.\n\nThe Bedwell’s Columnar Flint was identified by Robinson (1986) in sections across the North Downs, although within the London district it has only locally developed ‘columnar’ morphology, and is generally difficult to recognise in sections. It is associated with the upper of two acmes of the inoceramid bivalve Cladoceramus undulatoplicatus. The lower one marks the boundary of the Coniacian and Santonian stages, and the upper is coincident with the flint horizon (Robinson, 1986). Both horizons crop out in the Grays–Purfleet quarries and at the Swanscombe Western Quarry. At Pinden, only the upper horizon is present, and one or other of them has been identified in boreholes around Islington [TQ 3376 8495], Stratford, [TQ 4129 8525], and in a quarry at Northfleet [TQ 6207 7394].\n\nThe semi-continuous Whitaker’s 3-inch Flint forms a conspicuous marker horizon, a few metres below the Palaeogene in most of the quarries in the Grays–Purfleet area. It is tabular in form, typically about 0.07 m thick, and has a slightly irregular lower surface that distinguishes it from other (thinner) flat-sided, sheet flints that occur locally in this part of the succession. At Swanscombe Western Quarry [TQ 5808 7344] it lies 22 m above the Seven Sister’s Flint, and may be the prominent flint recorded at the base of the former Ruxley Quarry [TQ 4895 7010] by Dibley (1909). It was also proved in a borehole near Aveley [TQ 5528 7932]. The thickest successions exposed above the Whitaker’s 3-inch Flint are 13 m at Gibbs Quarry [TQ 595 787], 15 m at Swanscombe Eastern Quarry [TQ 590 735] and 20 m at Pinden [TQ 5935 6970] (Figure 8). The succession between this flint and Shoreham Marl 2 is particularly variable in thickness, being 46 m around Grays and 34 m at Swanscombe.\n\nThe Barrois Sponge Bed, recognised in east Kent, and its lateral equivalent the Clandon Hardground in Surrey, occur at the top of the Seaford Chalk in the London district; the upper surface of the sponge bed/ hardground marks the base of the overlying Margate Chalk (Robinson, 1986; Bristow et al., 1997). This marker bed is probably represented by two conspicuous horizons of hard, yellow chalk formerly exposed in the pit at St Paul’s Cray (Dewey et al., 1924), and by weakly developed spongiferous chalks at Pinden and in the lower part of the old quarry at Farningham Road Station. It also forms the hardground in the floor of the mines at Chiselhurst, and two indurated chalk horizons 3.6 m apart in the workings at Camden Park (Whitaker, 1889; Jukes-Browne and Hill, 1904). The interval of strata at outcrop between the Barrois Sponge Bed/Clandon Hardground and Whitaker’s 3-inch Flint appears to thicken to the south-east of the region, ranging from 2.5 m at Chiselhurst to 21, 15 and 13 m at Pinden, Swanscombe and Gibbs Quarry [TQ 595 787].\n\nStrata above the Barrois Sponge Bed consist of relatively flint-free chalk in the Orpington area, for example at Cacketshill Wood [TQ 5143 6677] near Crockenhill and north-east of Holwood Farm [TQ 4272 6365] where about 5 m are present beneath the Thanet Sand. Elsewhere the chalk above this horizon contains sporadic flints throughout and locally large flattened flints, typically 0.3 m across, forming discontinuous beds. Conulus albogalerus is locally abundant in these beds which can be seen in a pit at Upper Ifield [TQ 6834 7124] and the cutting at Farningham Road station [TQ 5545 6920] (Figure 8), and were formerly exposed at Ruxley Quarry [TQ 4895 7010] (Dibley, 1909).\n\nIn areas where marker beds in the Upper Chalk have not been recognised, fossils diagnostic of the U. socialis and M. testudinarius Zones, which lie above the Barrois Sponge Bed, support determination of the lithostratigraphy. These zones have been documented widely at outcrop around Croydon and south of Bromley (Young, 1905; Dewey et al., 1924). The key fossils are the calyx plates belonging to the index crinoid species although, in the case of U. socialis, these are quite inconspicuous. Notable records of U. socialis are from the former pits at St Paul’s Cray and at Cacketshill Wood and a pit north-east of Holwood Farm [TQ 4272 6365] that apparently included the junction of the U. socialis and M. testudinarius zones (Dewey et al., 1924).\n\nChapter 4 Palaeogene–Paleocene\n\nAt the beginning of Palaeogene time the London district lay on the edge of a sedimentary basin that included much of the present North Sea, and extended eastwards at least as far as Poland. To the west was the proto-Atlantic Ocean, the development of which was associated with rifting and igneous activity that culminated in early Eocene time about 55 million years ago (Knox, 1994). The Palaeogene deposits were laid down during alternating transgressions and regressions driven by global sea level changes and this broad pattern was overprinted locally by tectonic influences. The general succession (Table 6) is divided into major depositional sequences (Knox, 1996) and related to the magnetic chronology and nannofossil zones.\n\nThe strategic importance of understanding the stratigraphical and palaeo-environmental history of the Palaeogene deposits of the London Basin became apparent with the discovery, in the early 1970s, of oil-bearing strata of this age beneath the North Sea. In the local context, this understanding, underpinned by information provided from key boreholes (Table 7) has also played a role in the development of better interpretations of site investigation data for the planning of major infrastructure projects in London. Some of the larger ones have been the development of the London Docklands, the building of underground services, including the London Underground, and recently the Channel Tunnel Rail Link.\n\nThanet Sand Formation\n\nThe oldest Palaeogene deposit in the London district is the Thanet Sand Formation. Its base is unconformable on the eroded surface of the Chalk Group. The unconformity is not caused by a single event but, based on evidence in the London Basin as a whole, is attributed to erosion and reworking during two or more depositional sequences (Knox, 1996).\n\nThe Thanet Sand Formation occurs at depth beneath much of London and the north-east of the region but is absent north-west of a line from Hillingdon [TQ 10 85] to Borehamwood [TQ 20 95]. The principal outcrops are in the south and east of the region, mainly in outliers around Dartford [TQ 52 73], Swanley [TQ 51 69], Southfleet [TQ 614 711] and Cobham [TQ 671 685]. Thanet Sand is also preserved locally in dissolution pipes and hollows in the Chalk peripheral to these outliers, in some cases beneath a cover of Head or Clay-with-flints. The maximum thickness is about 30 m in the vicinity of Stanford-le-Hope [TQ 68 82], decreasing to the north-west (Figure 9).\n\nThe lowest beds of Thanet Sand lie on a roughly planar dip slope formed by the top of the Chalk. This feature is particularly well developed in the vicinity of the A2 road and to the south of it, around Istead Rise [TQ 63 70] and Singlewell [TQ 66 71], and around Horton Kirby [TQ 57 68]. Pockets of Thanet Sand occur in dissolution cavities developed on this surface, but the majority of them do not form features. They are known only from augering, excavations and borehole records; in general they are too small to show on the geological maps. The outliers that constitute the main outcrop of the formation form positive, well-drained features with convex slopes. The basal contact with the chalk is, in many places, at a pronounced concave break of slope. The top of the formation is difficult to place on the basis of features, and is generally located by augering or placed on the evidence of borehole data.\n\nThe basal unit, known as the Bullhead Bed, is a conglomerate up to 0.5 m thick. It is variable in lithology, with sporadic rounded flint pebbles up to 50 mm in diameter, and almost unworn nodular flints (‘bullhead flints’) up to 150 mm across set in a dark greenish grey, clayey fine- to coarse-grained sand matrix containing pellets of glauconite up to 1 mm in diameter. The nodular flints are typically coated with dark green crystalline glauconite less than 0.5 mm thick. Small, pale yellow-grey slivers and flakes of unpatinated flint are also present in the matrix. These are resinous in appearance when freshly broken. Small fossils, including fish vertebrae, pelecypod shells, bryozoa and echinoid spines all derived from the underlying chalk are also present.\n\nThe bulk of the Thanet Sand is a coarsening-upward sequence, dominantly of fine-grained sand, but clayey and silty in the lower part as illustrated by a typical gamma-ray log signature (Figure 10). The proportion of fine-grained sand ranges from 10 per cent at the base to 60 per cent in the upper beds.\n\nThe unweathered sediments are pale to medium grey to brownish grey in colour. They weather at the surface to pale yellowish grey. Contemporary weathering and pedogenic processes locally give rise to a typical podsol profile, with purplish brown weak ferruginous cement developed within 0.8 m of the surface, in the lower part of the profile.\n\nThe sediments are intensely bioturbated so that primary sedimentary structures such as lamination are generally lacking. Bioturbation structures are identified as wisps of relatively dark grey clay and silty clay in hand specimen and in exposures. Dark grey to black manganese-rich silt has been observed in the linings of sinuous burrows up to 8 mm in diameter. Scattered oblique and near-vertical burrows also occur in the top 1 to 1.5 m. These are filled with glauconitic sand derived from the overlying Upnor Formation.\n\nFaint bedding is seen in places, in weathered exposures, and some fine lamination is recorded near the top of the formation in the Crystal Palace Borehole (at 152.2 m to 145.8 m depth). Glauconite grains and flakes of white mica are sparsely distributed throughout. Beds weakly indurated by iron oxide have been described in north Kent, and irregular to oblate masses of siliceous sandstone (colloquially known as ‘doggers’) have been recorded in the vicinity of Thurrock and Grays. Irregular nodules of pyrite less than 5 mm across occur rarely, presumably replacing small wood fragments, and Prestwich (1852) described gypsum, presumably from the dissolution of pyrite, at Blackheath.\n\nGrain size analyses of the sediments (Figure 11) reveal that the succession as a whole is remarkably uniform and well sorted; better sorted beds occur towards the top. The sand grains consist almost exclusively of quartz, and are mainly angular and subangular, with only a small proportion of subrounded grains and flint chips. Montmorillonite is generally the dominant clay mineral, thought to be, in part, a weathering product of penecontemporaneous volcanic ash falls (Knox, 1994).\n\nThin sections indicate the presence of corroded feldspar, minor randomly orientated white mica, chlorite and ilmenite. Authigenic pyrite and glauconite clasts are rare. Some over-sized voids may be caused by dissolution of framework grains. Apatite occurs as fine sand grade detrital grains in samples from central London, but is absent in Crystal Palace and Stanford le Hope boreholes, presumably due to dissolution by acidic groundwater (Hallsworth, 1993).\n\nThe heavy mineral assemblage of the Thanet Sand has been studied in samples from the BGS boreholes at Stanford-le-Hope and Crystal Palace (Morton, 1982), and Borehole 404T and Borehole CTRL A2 (Hallsworth, 1993; see (Table 7)). The lower half of the formation contains a rich and diverse suite of heavy minerals, 42 per cent of which are unstable, dominated by an epidote-garnet-hornblende assemblage. This is thought to be the primary heavy mineral suite. A more stable suite dominated by zircon, rutile and tourmaline and a moderately stable garnet dominates the upper part of the formation. These variations are thought to be due to weathering dissolution of the more unstable minerals by meteoric acidic groundwater during postdepositional subaerial exposure.\n\nRepresentative sections\n\nThere are few natural exposures. The basal few metres of the Thanet Sand can be seen in the top part of exposures in former Chalk quarries at Grays [TQ 609 792] and Swanscombe Western Quarry [TQ 606 728]. The top part of the formation is exposed in sand pits near Orsett [TQ 673 806]. Almost complete sequences through the entire formation are held by the BGS from Borehole CTRL A2 in south-east London and Jubilee Line Extension Borehole 404T (see (Table 7) for details).\n\nBiostratigraphy\n\nCalcareous nannoplankton are the most important fossils for regional correlation (Aubry, 1986; Knox et al., 1994). Foraminifera (Curry, 1965) are not useful for stratigraphical purposes, but indicate that deposition occurred in a cool sea at a depth of less then 50 m. Molluscs are not well preserved; they occur sporadically throughout the formation, and include cold water genera (see Ward, 1978). Jolley (1992) has used palynofloral assemblages for regional correlation, relating them to the sequence-stratigraphy scheme of Haq et al. (1987). He recognised that the bulk of the formation in this district was laid in the seventh (T7) of nine onlapping sequences that constitute the formation and its correlatives in the London Basin as a whole. It is possible that the younger T6 and T5 sequences may be present, particularly in the east but the evidence is inconclusive.\n\nEnvironment of deposition\n\nThe deposits are interpreted as inner shelf to coastal in origin. In general, they are well sorted, indicating considerable winnowing and reworking prior to deposition. Grain shape suggests a rather juvenile origin with only minor recycling from older sedimentary formations. The heavy mineral assemblage indicates an input from a single source area rich in an epidote-garnet-amphibole assemblage, and most likely to be the Moine and Dalradian metasediments in Scottish highlands (Hallsworth, 1993).\n\nLambeth Group\n\nThe formal term Lambeth Group has been adopted in recent years (Ellison et al., 1994) to replace the Woolwich and Reading Beds of earlier authors (see for example Whitaker, 1889; Hester, 1965). The group is divided into three formations and several informal lithological units (Table 8). The relationship between these informal units is most complex in the central part of the district, coincident with central and south-east London (Figure 12).\n\nThe Lambeth Group crops out in narrow tracts around the margins of the main mass of the Palaeogene, as outliers in the south-east of the district and as small inliers close to the margin, notably in the Lea valley [TQ 38 85]. It also occurs beneath superficial deposits principally between Camberwell [TQ 33 77] and Docklands [TQ 38 79]. No distinctive landforms are associated with the Lambeth Group, but it crops out on concavo-convex slopes or locally on the hill tops in some outliers. Minor springs occur at the top of clay-dominated units, particularly the Lower Shelly Clay.\n\nThe Lambeth Group is more than 20 m thick in the south-west, increasing to 30 m at Southwell [TQ 119 799] (Figure 13). In the south-east part of the main outcrop, and in the outliers east of Chiselhurst [TQ 46 70], the top part of the succession was removed by erosion before the deposition of the overlying Harwich Formation (see p.38). The amount of erosion is very variable (Dewey et al., 1924). Locally, for example at Plumstead Common [TQ 45 78], only the Upnor Formation is preserved, and in some of the Palaeogene outliers, for example at Kevingtown [TQ 484 675] and near Swanley [TQ 513 686], all the Lambeth Group has been removed.\n\nThe lithological variation of the Lambeth Group at outcrop is documented in considerable detail, particularly in the earlier editions of the Geological Survey memoirs (Whitaker, 1872, 1889), but also in accounts of field excursions made by the Geologists’ Association and in the publications of local societies such as the Croydon Natural History Society, and Essex Naturalist. They provide a wealth of information on sections in pits and railway cuttings that are no longer available for study. Since 1990, new information has become available in the form of complete cores of the Lambeth Group obtained during the course of site investigations in Central London. These, together with the interpretation of numerous other borehole records and the examination of contemporary open sections, have provided a regional appreciation of the variability of the group and its constituent formations, and is the basis for the informal division described below. The lithological variation in the group is illustrated by cross-sections on (Figure 14), and in graphical logs at particular localities on (Figure 15).\n\nThe best and most accessible exposure of the Lambeth Group in the London district is Charlton Sand Pit at Maryon Park [TQ 419 786] (Figure 15), now preserved as an SSSI (Daley and Balson, 1999). Other good sections, which are not permanent at the time of writing because they occur in or close to active quarries, are in the Orsett Tarmac Pit near Walton’s Hall, Orsett [TQ 673 803], Orsett Cock Pit [TQ 656 811] (Plate 1) (Ellison, 1979) and Swanscombe Eastern Quarry [TQ 605 730] (Figure 15).\n\nUpnor Formation\n\nThe formation, present everywhere at the base of the Lambeth Group, is impractical to map in detail. It is difficult to identify the top of the formation by augering and in many places it is built on or is obscured by more recent sandy wash. The thickness is well documented in boreholes (Figure 16) and exposed sections, but in some borehole logs it is not possible to determine as the Upnor Formation cannot be separated from the Thanet Sand.\n\nThe Upnor Formation rests unconformably on Thanet Sand, overlapping onto Chalk north-west of a line from Northolt [TQ 13 84] to Borehamwood [TQ 20 95]. There may be a weak seepage at the contact due to the higher silt and clay content in the Thanet Sand. In exposures the base is generally well defined, and burrows extend up to 2 m below the contact. A basal bed of rounded flint pebbles is usually present. In the east, relatively intense bioturbation has resulted in a gradational junction. In contrast with the Thanet Sand, the Upnor Formation contains slightly coarser grade sand (Plate 2) and the lower beds may be gritty and contain fragments of subangular flint (less than 1 mm across).\n\nThe formation consists of fine- to medium-grained sand with a variable proportion of glauconite, beds and stringers of well-rounded flint pebbles, and minor amounts of clay. At outcrop the sediments are pale grey-brown to orange-brown, speckled with dark green grains of fine to medium sand grade glauconite. At depth, the sediments are mainly dark grey and dark greenish grey. In the west, the entire formation is noticeably green caused by a relatively high glauconite content. In north, west and central areas of the district, the highest part and locally the entire thickness of the Upnor Formation is oxidised to a range of brown, orange, red and purple-brown colours, as a result of emergence and pedogenesis during deposition of the overlying Reading Formation. This period of pedogenesis also gave rise to the localised development of carbonate concretions, either in the form of hard irregular masses or powdery patches up to 0.5 m in diameter, and the development of a clay matrix derived by translocation from the overlying deposits.\n\nThe sands may be completely bioturbated with no primary bedding, and perpendicular and subhorizontal burrows filled with sand of contrasting colour to the bioturbated matrix. Rare fragments of carbonaceous material occur also. A few impersistent seams of grey clay and angular clasts derived from such seams have been recorded within dominantly bioturbated beds. Other parts of the succession are well bedded and with horizontal planar lamination, ripple lamination, hummocky and planar cross-bedding, and clay drapes. Stringers of well-rounded flint pebbles occur on a few bedding surfaces and there are beds of pebbly sand, mostly less than 0.3 m thick. Thin seams of grey clay, angular clay clasts and rounded balls of clay are also present. Ophiomorpha and Macaronichnus burrows are typical in these beds (Plate 3). Clay-dominated units, up to 0.3 m thick, contain relatively small amounts of sand, arranged in flaser lamination and with lenticular cross-lamination. These strata are well exposed in quarries at Orsett Cock [TQ 657 811] and Orsett Tarmac Quarry [TQ 673 805].\n\nThe flint pebbles that occur throughout the formation are generally less than 30 mm in diameter but may exceptionally reach 200 mm, with a black to dark purple cortex and pale grey interior. They are typically well rounded, elongate, spheroidal to flattened spheroidal and in many cases with a slight concavity, presumed to be a result of pressure solution. Many have crescent-shaped percussion marks.\n\nPebble-dominated units occur principally at the base and top of the formation. In borehole cores, these pebble beds are almost invariably disturbed or only partly recovered, but information on bedding and other details have been recorded from exposure. The pebble bed at the base of the formation is impersistent and up to 1 m thick. A local development of pebble beds occurs in the basal part of the formation at Orsett in south Essex where the pebbles are arranged in large bedforms, in total about 9 m thick, and dipping at 21° to the east (Plate 1). Individual beds fine upwards and many are clast supported with imbrication. These pebble beds are well exposed at Orsett Cock Quarry [TQ 657 810] (Ellison, 1979). At the top of the formation in central and south-east London, there is a persistent pebble bed up to 3 m thick (see (Figure 12); (Figure 15)). Pedogenesis and the precipitation of calcrete have altered the matrix in places.\n\nThe oyster Ostrea bellovacina is the most common mollusc as in most places aragonite-shelled molluscs are not preserved. Sharks’ teeth also occur sporadically.\n\nWoolwich Formation\n\nThe Woolwich Formation rests on the Lower Mottled Clay of the Reading Formation (Figure 12).\n\nLower Shelly Clay\n\nThis unit, characterised at outcrop by finely comminuted shell debris in a clay soil, is the most easily distinguished of the informal units of the Lambeth Group. It crops out principally in south-east London (Figure 17). In general, the formation thickens from central London towards the south-east, reaching a maximum of 6 m.\n\nThe Lower Shelly Clay rests disconformably on the Lower Mottled Clay of the Reading Formation. The base is sharp with burrows up to 10 mm in diameter extending to a depth of 1 m into the underlying strata. The top of the unit is generally a sharp or transitional with the Laminated beds or the Upper Mottled Clay.\n\nThe dominant lithology of this unit is dark grey to black clay that contains abundant shells. In east London, there is an increase of medium grade sand in the matrix. Some beds, up to 1 m thick, consist almost entirely of shells forming a weakly cemented coquina in places. One of these beds (0.5 m thick) was proved in a borehole near Stratford. The basal few centimetres of the unit is relatively sandy and commonly contains oyster shells. A bed dominated by oysters, encrusted with bryozoa and cemented in places, occurs locally about 1 to 2 m above the base of the Lower Shelly Clay (Dewey and Bromehead, 1921; Tracey, 1986). These shell-dominated beds indicate that sediment input was low, thus allowing the development of shell banks, and they may represent a maximum flooding surface. A few beds of brownish grey clay occur sporadically throughout, particularly in the higher parts of the unit. These are slightly cemented with siderite. Finely comminuted carbonaceous debris occurs in places; some of it is pyritised.\n\nLignite (usually less than 0.3 m thick) is commonly seen at the base of the Lower Shelly Clay in the south-eastern part of the outcrop (Figure 15). It consists of soft, brownish black, organic mud with small lignitic wood clasts. At Shorne [TQ 678 697], the lignite is up to 2 m thick and displays a cleat (closely spaced joints) similar to a sub-bituminous coal. It is interbedded with pale grey, leached, medium-grained sand and pale grey clay with lignitic wood fragments and small listric fractures, similar to seatearth.\n\nDewey and Bromehead (1921, p.20) recorded a ‘freshwater bed’ of limited distribution, within the middle of the ‘shell beds’. This bed is almost certainly the ‘Paludina Limestone’, a marker horizon that has been used to show that the Upper Shelly Clay probably rests directly on the Lower Shelly Clay in south-east London in the vicinity of Petts Wood and St Mary Cray [TQ 45 68] (Figure 14; Whitaker, 1872, p.116), and probably also at Shorne [TQ 678 697] where there is a particularly thick development of shell beds (see (Figure 15)).\n\nCharacteristically few species occur in this unit; they are mainly oysters (Ostrea tenera), corbiculid bivalves such as Corbicula cordata and the cerithiid gastropods Brotia melanoides and Tympanotonos funatus.\n\nLaminated beds\n\nThis unit generally rests conformably on the Lower Shelly Clay and has a similar distribution (Figure 18). It is 5 m thick south of Stratford. The base may be sharp, a rapid gradation up from the Lower Shelly Clay or, locally, interfingering with Lower Shelly Clay. In some of the eastern part of its occurrence it passes up into and locally on interfingers with the Upper Mottled Clay (Figure 14); Crystal Palace Borehole, (Figure 15). A second unit of Laminated beds occurs higher in the succession around Lewisham where it was formerly known as ‘Striped loams’ (Dewey et al., 1924) (Figure 15). The stratigraphical relationships of the laminated beds are uncertain but they probably have an erosive base, cutting down through the Upper Shelly Clay.\n\nThe Laminated beds consist of thinly interbedded fine- to medium-grained sand, silt and clay with scattered intact bivalve shells. Beds are generally less than 50 mm thick and typically finely laminated. Sedimentary features include lenticular bedding, ripple lamination, burrows and some bioturbated, structureless beds. Localised bodies of sand are generally up to 1.4 m thick, but locally up to 5 m (for example Borehole 404T, (Figure 15)). They occur particularly in south-east London around Lambeth and Bermonsey and may have originated as channel fills. More extensive bodies of sands are present between Docklands and Stratford. Typically the sand is pale olive to pale brown, medium grained, well sorted and cross-laminated, with some clay drapes and scattered bivalves. Thin beds of colour mottled clay and silt (Upper Mottled Clay) occur within the Laminated beds between Docklands and Stratford (see (Figure 14)).\n\nAt Abbey Wood [TQ 484 787], shelly medium-grained sands underlying the Harwich Formation are significant for their well-preserved fauna, which includes mammals. The strata are included in the Laminated beds, although their age and precise stratigraphical relationship are uncertain (Hooker 1991).\n\nClay beds with leaf impressions have been recorded from the ‘Striped loams’ at Loam Pit Hill, Lewisham [TQ 375 761] (Whitaker, 1866).\n\nUpper Shelly Clay\n\nThe main occurrence of the unit is in south London (Figure 19). South-east and north-east of this, the Upper Shelly Clay is proved only sporadically in boreholes and is inferred to be preserved in shallow depressions below an erosion surface at the base of the Harwich Formation. The unit is up to about 3 m thick.\n\nThe base of the unit is sharp and it rests disconformably on the Upper Mottled Clay (for example Borehole A4A, (Figure 15)), or where it rests on Laminated beds the contact may be a rapid gradation. It is likely that beds equivalent to the Upper Shelly Clay are present farther south-east than is shown on (Figure 19) but, in the absence of the intervening Upper Mottled Clay unit, they cannot be distinguished from the Lower Shelly Clay in sections or borehole cores. One exception to this is in the Crystal Palace Borehole where the base of the Upper Shelly Clay is taken at a thin lignite bed (see (Figure 15)). In some borehole records, the Upper Shelly Clay was formerly interpreted as the basal beds of the London Clay Formation.\n\nThis unit consists mainly of grey shelly clay with thinly interbedded grey-brown silt and very fine-grained sand with scattered glauconite grains, passing south-eastwards to mainly sand (Figure 19). Bioturbated beds, sand-filled burrows and clay rip-up clasts (less than 5 mm in diameter) are characteristic, and locally there is a weakly cemented shell bed (up to 0.43 m thick) containing Ostrea. Between Bermondsey and Lewisham, a more or less continuous bed of grey limestone with an earthy texture is known as the Paludina Limestone (see (Figure 14); (Figure 15). The bed is generally 0.1 to 0.3 m thick, up to a maximum of 1.89 m, and contains unbroken and comminuted gastropods Hydrobia, Planorbis and Viviparus, which indicate deposition in a freshwater lake. A thin bed of lignite occurs locally at the base of the unit at Crystal Palace (Figure 15).\n\nMost of the Upper Shelly Clay contains disarticulated bivalves of more marine-tolerant species and a generally greater diversity of fauna than in the Lower Shelly Clay.\n\nReading Formation\n\nThe Reading Formation rests on the Upnor Formation in the centre of the district and passes laterally into the Woolwich Formation in the central and south-eastern outcrops of the Lambeth Group. In the central part of the London district the formation is divided into two leaves, the Upper and Lower Mottled Clay, separated by the Woolwich Formation (Figure 12); (Figure 14). The Reading Formation as a whole is present in most of the region, but is thin or absent in the north-east. The Lower Mottled Clay persists in the entire area of the Reading Formation. The Upper Mottled Clay occurs only between Walthamstow and Merton (Figure 20) because of nondeposition or erosion prior to the deposition of the succeeding Harwich Formation.\n\nThe formation reaches a maximum of about 20 m in the south-west of the district, thinning progressively eastwards, where it passes laterally into and interfingers with the Woolwich Formation (Figure 12).\n\nThe boundary of the Lower Mottled Clay with the underlying Upnor Formation is usually diffuse and difficult to place precisely because of clay translocation and colour mottling caused by pedogenetic processes that affected the top of the Upnor Formation. The base of the Upper Mottled Clay has, in many places, a similarly vague contact with the Laminated beds, except around Stratford where the two units interfinger.\n\nThe bulk of the formation consists of unbedded, colour mottled, silty clay and clay. This characteristic lithology was formerly called the ‘Reading Beds’ or ‘plastic clay’. Colours include pale brown and pale grey-blue, dark brown, pale green, red-brown and crimson, depending on the oxidation state of the sediments. The clays contain numerous fissures, many of them listric, which give rise to a blocky texture. Thin, black, carbonaceous clays are recorded locally in the west of the district in the middle of the sequence (see (Figure 14)). Beds of colour-mottled silt and sand constitute up to 50 per cent of the unit, particularly in the east. The colour is dominantly of brown hues, red hues being less prevalent than in the clays. These beds are thinly laminated in places with small burrows and root traces, and minor brecciation caused by soft sediment deformation. Beds of well-sorted sand, mainly in the west of the region, are recorded in borehole logs but are not known in detail. Evidence from adjacent areas to the west suggests these occupy discrete channels.\n\nThe Lower Mottled Clay typically shows purple-red hues. The top part of the unit contains irregular-shaped, hard, splintery and soft, powdery carbonate nodules up to 0.5 m in diameter. East of Stratford, the principal lithology is turquoise to dark green and brown mottled, structureless slightly clayey sand with minor amounts of irregularly iron cemented and partially cemented calcareous clayey sands; the beds as a whole become increasingly sandy in an easterly direction. (Figure 12); (Figure 20).\n\nThe Upper Mottled Clay is identified principally in cores in central and east London; it consists largely of mottled clay, silty clay and silt with colours similar to those of the Lower Mottled Clay, but the purple hues are absent.\n\nMineralogy of the Lambeth Group\n\nThe non-clay minerals of the Upnor Formation are dominated by quartz with variable amounts of glauconite, some alkali feldspar, chert, minor mica, traces of collophane and calcite. The quartz grains are typically subangular and well sorted (Plate 3). At outcrop glauconite grains in some places are oxidised to yellow-brown goethite and ilmenite. The clay mineral assemblage is generally dominated by smectite with subordinate illite and mixed layer illite-smectite; kaolinite is less than 10 per cent (Figure 21).\n\nThe Upnor Formation is characterised by an abundance of stable heavy mineral grains dominated by zircon, along with rutile and tourmaline. Morton (1982) inferred that they are derived from the south, probably Armorica and/or the Ardennes–Rhenish massifs. Hallsworth (1993) found compositionally diverse pyrope garnets in the Upnor Formation, chemically different from those in the Thanet Formation. They are derived either from a source area with heterogeneous rocks or by recycling of detritial minerals from several source areas.\n\nThe clay minerals of the Lower Mottled Clay (Figure 21) are dominated by well crystallised smectite that may be derived, at least in part, from the alteration of volcanic ash. The Upper Mottled Clay and clays in the Woolwich Formation are characterised by a mixed clay assemblage, with less smectite and more illite, kaolinite and chlorite. Evidence from scanning electron microscopy shows that much of the kaolinite is very fine grained and intimately mixed with other clay minerals, indicating a detrital origin. Some of the kaolinite is arranged in delicate ‘booklets’ that would not survive agitation during erosion and deposition. Therefore, it is assumed to be authigenic in origin, produced by the weathering of smectite and illite as a consequence of pedogenesis.\n\nThe characteristic colour variability of the Woolwich and Reading formations is due to the different states of oxidation and hydration of the iron minerals that constitute only a few per cent by volume of the sediment. In unoxidised grey and black deposits, pyrite is usually the main mineral. Jarosite, a yellow alteration mineral associated with pyrite, occurs in lignitic beds. In the Reading Formation, the most common form of oxidised iron mineral belongs to the goethite species and imparts yellow-brown and brown colours, and is commonly referred to as limonite. Red colours are due to extremely small quantities of hematite, which developed when the sediment was subjected to long periods of subaerial exposure that resulted in drying and dehydration. Earthy hematite nodules less than 5 mm in diameter are also present in places.\n\nThe heavy mineral composition of the Woolwich and Reading formations is similar (Hallsworth, 1993), and is dominated by a zircon-rutile-tourmaline suite. There is a low but variable proportion of the less stable minerals epidote, apatite and spessartite garnet. The variablity of the epidote and apatite was probably caused by dissolution during local emergence and pedogenesis (Morton, 1982).\n\nThe provenance of the heavy minerals is equivocal. Morton (1982) regarded it as Scottish, similar to the Thanet Sand, suggesting that the heavy minerals were carried by currents from the north and reworked in an estuarine environment. However, the spessartite garnet suggests derivation from a different source, dominated by amphibolite facies metamorphic rocks. Armorica is one such area, although the metamorphic grade is lower than is normally associated with spessartite garnet. The Cornubian granites are another potential source, although they should yield a heavy mineral suite containing a higher proportion tourmaline than is found in the Woolwich and Reading formations. Spessartite garnet occurs also in Coal Measures (Westphalian) sandstones, but there they are associated with other garnets of different composition that do not occur in the Woolwich and Reading formations.\n\nPalaeontology of the Lambeth Group\n\nBGS and the Natural History Museum hold large collections of macrofossils from the Lambeth Group, brought together mainly before the end of the 19th century. Rundle (1970), Hooker (1974) and Tracey (1986), among others, have documented more recent collections; Collinson and Hooker (1987) have reviewed the flora. Molluscs in particular are valuable as indicators of the environment of deposition, but there is no established biozonation of the Lambeth Group as a whole. Calcareous nannofossils in the lower part of the Upnor Formation in central London (Ellison et al., 1996) have been interpreted as nannoplankton (NP) zone NP9, enabling correlation with sequences elsewhere in northwest Europe (Aubry, 1986; see (Table 6)). Another potential tool for biostratigraphical correlation is the use of marine and terrestrial palynomorphs (acritarchs, dinoflagellate cysts, pollen and spores). A mammal fauna discovered in shelly sands at Abbey Wood probably equivalent to the Upper Shelly Clay, has been used for correlation with other European sites (Hooker, 1996).\n\nEnvironment of deposition of the Lambeth Group\n\nThe regional distribution of deposits of the Lambeth Group was recognised as cyclic in nature by Stamp (1921), an idea developed further by Hester (1965) and Ellison (1983). Four depositional sequences separated by unconformities are now recognised (Knox, 1996; (Table 6)). The sediments as a whole were laid down in a coastal or possibly estuarine setting (Figure 22) in which small fluctuations in sea level led to marked changes in environment.\n\nFollowing a period of regression and weathering of the top of the Thanet Sand, the lowest beds of the Upnor Formation were laid down in transgressive littoral to sublittoral marine, tidal conditions. The abundance of glauconite, most noticeable in the west of the district, indicates periods of sediment starvation, presumably in areas remote from active currents. The Upnor Formation as a whole is interpreted as highstand deposits in which marine flooding events are marked by pulses of glauconite deposition, winnowing and low sediment input (Ellison et al., 1996).\n\nDeposition of the upper part of the Upnor Formation followed a lowering of sea level that may have led to the removal of some of the earlier deposits. Contemporary emergence is indicated by the presence of local silcretes (Kerr, 1955) and clasts of silica-cemented conglomerate in pebble beds at the top of the formation. These clasts are typical of the ‘Hertfordshire Puddingstone’ that, in association with silica cemented sandstones (sarsens), were widespread to the north and west of the district (see Potter, 1998 for a review). This period of emergence marked the beginning of deposition of the Reading Formation on an alluvial floodplain that was liable to intermittent floods and water table fluctuation. Periodic emergence led to oxidation, pedogenesis and the development of the characteristic red coloration, but the instability of this environment precluded the development of extensive colonisation by vegetation. Estuarine and fresh water palynomorphs in the sandier parts of the Lower Mottled Clay in the east are evidence of intermittent encroachment by the sea onto the alluvial floodplain. A temporary rise in sea level led to the establishment of lagoonal and estuarine conditions and the deposition of the Lower Shelly Clay and Laminated beds in the central and eastern parts of the district. Sand bodies in these units contain a brackish water palynomorph assemblage consistent with deposition in estuarine tidal channels. This sequence culminated with a return to continental conditions and deposition of the Upper Mottled Clay. A second rise in sea level and renewed flooding resulted in the deposition of brackish lagoonal and estuarine sediments (Upper Shelly Clay and ‘striped loams’). This period of deposition was terminated by uplift and erosion that removed much of the Lambeth Group sediments in the north and east of the district.\n\nHarwich Formation\n\nThis term was introduced by Ellison et al. (1994) to include all sediments between the Lambeth Group and the London Clay Formation. They were formerly differentiated by Prestwich (1854) as the ‘Basement-bed of the London Clay’, and subsequently divided by Whitaker (1866) into the Basement-bed sensu stricto, the Oldhaven Beds and the Blackheath Beds. In the London district, strata formerly mapped as Blackheath Beds are now included in the Harwich Formation.\n\nThe Harwich Formation occurs throughout the region (Figure 23), reaching a maximum thickness of 10 to 12 m around Orpington and Chiselhurst. South and east of London, where the deposits were formerly mapped as Blackheath Beds, there are numerous descriptions of former exposures recording very variable thicknesses over quite short distances; this probably indicates an irregular base. Elsewhere in the district, most of the information on the Harwich Formation is from borehole records, which indicate that the Harwich Formation is less than 4 m thick, strata formerly referred to the Basement Bed of the London Clay. In the north-east, an incomplete thickness of 6.88 m was proved in the Stock Borehole [TQ 7054 0045], and in the south-east the Stanford-le-Hope Borehole [TQ 6965 8241] proved 4 m.\n\nThe base is sharply defined, and forms an erosive contact on the Lambeth Group. Locally, in outliers at Kevingtown [TQ 485 675] and Swanley [TQ 515 686], the Harwich Formation oversteps onto the Thanet Sand Formation.\n\nGlauconitic fine-grained sand and pebble beds of rounded black flints are the principal lithologies with, in places, c"
