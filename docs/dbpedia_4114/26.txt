Amersham Museum at 49 and 51 High Street is a small local museum based in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, England. It is located on the High Street in Old Amersham.

Amersham Museum reopened in 2017. It includes a new reception area, a complete redisplay of the collection and an activity/exhibition space.

The museum is free for under 18s while adults can pay £6 per visit or an annual pass for £10.

The museum offers two for one entry for members of the Chiltern Society on presentation of their card.

They also offer guided walks as part of guests visits to the museum.

A spokesman said people can choose from a walk through the old town looking at the historic buildings and hearing about the people who lived there is a Tudor walk with a guide in costume who will share details of life and death in Amersham Tudor times.
