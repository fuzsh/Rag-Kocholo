Amersham Museum is a local museum in Amersham, England. It is intending to produce a Wiki for information concerning the history of Amersham.

In 2007, the exhibition area has been redisplayed with new display case, etc.

The museum has a collection of historic photographs that have been digitally enhanced. Some of these are available on this wiki. Users with knowledge of the photographs or locations are welcome to add their comments to the individual photographs under the associated discussion page.
