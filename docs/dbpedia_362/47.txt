The DN5 is an important and priority express road which links Bucharest with the southern country border with Bulgaria by the Giurgiu border crossing point (Giurgiu Russe Friendship Bridge). The main purpose of the project is to construct a functioning bypass that ensures the road connection.

This connection road detaches from the DN5 at km 56.197 by means of a roundabout junction and then continues to the south, intersecting with the DN5 and the DJ507 by means of another roundabout junction at km 62.404. After a route length of 5.72km, the road meets the existing roundabout at the customs via Unirii Street which is on a length of 615m extended to two lanes per direction.

The specific objectives for the connection between the DN5, the bypass and Prieteniei Bridge are:

diverting traffic outside of localities in order to reduce noise pollution as well as CO2 emission levels

significantly reducing the transit time between the two connected spots, resulting in lower transport costs as well as reduced fuel consumption

avoiding disruption of local traffic in order to streamline traffic in the area

At a maximum longitudinal slope of 1.82%, the route is designed for speeds of 70 to 100 km/h. The project also includes the construction of seven culverts and two passages. The works were scheduled to be completed in the spring of 2022, but our colleagues managed to open the traffic on this connection road as early as December 2021.
