        "text": "Vignette Romania—do I need a toll vignette for Romania?\n\nAre you planning to go on holiday to Romania by car, motorhome or caravan? Beautiful country! But on most major roads, you will need an electronic toll vignette. Otherwise, you will not be allowed to drive there. By purchasing this e-vignette (the so-called “rovinieta”), you are actually paying the tolls to the road authority in advance. You can consider it as a form of road tax, which takes effect as soon as you cross the border into Romania.\n\nUnlike in some other countries, the toll roads in Romania do not consist only of motorways. So, you might need the vignette Romania more often than you think! Make sure you have arranged for your e-vignette in advance so you don’t run into any surprises. It doesn’t matter if you are on holiday in Romania or merely passing through on your way to another country. If you want to drive your vehicle on the Romanian toll roads, an e-vignette is mandatory. Otherwise, you risk a hefty fine. So, don’t take any risks and buy your e-vignette for Romania now.\n\nPlease read below to find out which vignettes are available and how to apply for them. With our simple ordering process, you can instantly find out which e-vignette is most suitable for you, then quickly and safely purchase your vignette Romania. This means you can set off for Romania with peace of mind. Have a good trip!\n\nToll roads Romania—which roads are subject to tolls?\n\nPaying an additional toll for bridges\n\nOne of Europe’s greatest rivers, the beautiful Danube, flows right through Romania and along the border with Bulgaria and Serbia. Usually, modern bridges provide the fastest connection between the banks, some of which require you to pay a separate toll. This is currently the case for the following bridges:\n\nDN56, E79: Calafat – Vidin (Bulgaria)\n\nDN5, E70, E85: Giurgiu – Ruse (Bulgaria)\n\nA2, E81: Fetesti – Cernavoda\n\nDN2A, E60: Giurgeni – Vadul Oii\n\nYou can buy toll vignettes for these bridges at various toll booths and petrol stations along the roads leading to these bridges. Again, motorbikes are not required to pay tolls here. Be sure to take some Romanian money with you, as you can often only pay in cash at these bridges.\n\nRomania vignette—costs and fees\n\nAs mentioned, the “rovinieta” is a digital toll vignette. This means that you do not need to apply a sticker to your windscreen, and you will not receive one by post. The vignette is simply linked to the registration number of your vehicle. Once you’ve purchased your digital vignette, you will receive a confirmation by e-mail with your certificate of application. All you have to do is print it out and take it with you to Romania.\n\nBelow, you will find the costs for the e-vignette Romania. Our rates always include application, processing and registration. You can pay safely and quickly online with iDEAL, PayPal or a credit card.\n\nWeek Month Quarter Year\n\nAre you already on your way, and did you forget to buy an e-vignette? Then you can also purchase one en route at some petrol stations or border offices. We do not really recommend this, as it often takes up extra time. Moreover, you should be careful when paying in cash, as your change may be given in Romanian lei at a very poor exchange rate!\n\nFor how many days should your e-vignette be valid?\n\nThe cost of the e-vignette Romania is the same for all motor vehicles subject to tolls. However, you can choose a shorter or longer validity period. Just like in neighbouring Hungary and several other countries, it is the number of days you drive in Romania that matters, not the number of kilometres.\n\nE-vignettes can be purchased in Romania for a period of one week (seven days), one month, one quarter or one year. So, you must first consider how long and how often you want to travel to Romania. Then, you should select the appropriate vignette. For a short week’s holiday or a one-way transit, the cheap seven-day vignette will obviously suffice. If you are going on a road trip around the country, it is often cheaper to buy a toll vignette for one month. And if you travel to Romania several times a year, an e-vignette for one year would probably be more convenient. This has the added advantage that you can drive on the Romanian motorways all year round without having to worry about tolls!\n\nAre you having a hard time choosing? Our ordering process allows you to easily calculate how many days you will need and which e-vignette is the cheapest option for you. This makes your decision just a little bit easier.\n\nWhich vehicles require an e-vignette?\n\nIn Romania, this is much more straightforward than in many other countries. There is no complex distinction between different vehicles or a maximum weight. Instead, there is simply one category: motor vehicles. All motor vehicles are subject to the same rate. Could it be any clearer? Motorbikes are exempt from tolls, so they can travel through Romania for free anyway. Only heavy lorries are subject to a separate rate, but this concerns very heavy transport and does not apply to a typical holiday trip. That is why we do not offer this particular version of the e-vignette.\n\nBe careful with hire cars!\n\nAre you planning to drive a hire car in Romania? Then it is wise to pay some extra attention to the toll vignette. If you hire a vehicle in Romania, an e-vignette has probably already been arranged by the vehicle hire company. However, you should always verify this because you never know. If the vehicle is registered in another country, the vignette is often not included, so you’ll have to obtain one anyway. Always consult with the vehicle hire company in advance to avoid any issues later on.\n\nWhere to buy the e-vignette Romania?\n\nYou cannot buy the “rovinieta” for Romania just anywhere. Naturally, the toll authority in Romania sells it. However, you can also order the e-vignette conveniently and securely in advance through a reliable intermediary. We will discuss the possibilities in more detail below.\n\nVignette Romania at the ABTA\n\nAlthough the ABTA is ready to assist road users in every way, it is unfortunately not possible to buy an e-vignette for Romania from them. So, make sure you arrange it in another way, well before you leave!\n\nBuying a vignette Romania en route\n\nAlready on your way to Romania and forgot to arrange an e-vignette? Then you will have to arrange one quickly because it is illegal to drive on the major roads in Romania without a valid e-vignette. Thankfully, you can buy one along the way, including at petrol stations and border posts. However, these can sometimes get quite crowded. And, of course, you must carry a valid debit card. In fact, it is never a good idea to embark on a journey when you still have essential things to take care of along the way. If you want to travel hassle-free and waste no time, it is better to have these things arranged in advance.\n\nEasy online purchase at evignette.co.uk\n\nMany travellers buy their e-vignette for Romania at evignette.co.uk. From the comfort and convenience of your own home. If you order before 5 p.m. on weekdays, the toll vignette will arrive in your mailbox the very same day! We do charge a little more than the Romanian website, but you get a lot of peace of mind and convenience in return. Our entire ordering process is very simple and straightforward: just fill in some details, check out, and everything will be taken care of. This is very relaxing, as you already have enough on your mind while travelling.\n\nPlain and simple. As soon as we have received your application and payment, we will start processing it for you. We will need your licence plate number and some personal information to apply for the e-vignette Romania. Is your application complete and approved? Then you will be automatically registered with the Romanian toll authorities as the owner of the e-vignette and you can officially use the Romanian road network! Tip: Keep your e-vignette for some time as evidence of your purchase, just in case you ever find an unjustified traffic fine on your doorstep.\n\nToll roads Romania—inspections and fines\n\nThe Romanian authorities are constantly monitoring whether each vehicle on the roads has an e-vignette. Licence plates are scanned by strategically placed cameras along the motorways. The traffic police are also verifying licence plates around the clock. This happens as soon as you cross the border! Do you, as the driver of the vehicle, not have a valid road vignette? Then you will receive a fine, which is much higher than the price of the vignette! Because your licence plate number is registered in the system, the fine is often already waiting for you when you get home. If you do not pay it on time, you will incur substantial additional costs. Our advice: carefully calculate how long you intend to stay in Romania and choose the appropriate e-vignette (one week, one month, one quarter or one year). If you allow a little margin, you will definitely be okay."
