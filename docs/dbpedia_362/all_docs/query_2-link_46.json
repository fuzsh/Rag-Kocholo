        "text": "Last word.\n\nThe end to a fantastic ride, riding over 4,000km through ten countries in all weather. When we started in April we were heading off sometimes in 0 degrees, or colder, riding in jumpers and rain jackets – it snowed in Basel, and there was a heatwave from the Sahara towards the end having us on the road as soon as it was light enough to get the bulk of the kms done before it got too hot.\n\nThe people were fantastic, friendly and helpful everywhere. We were both so impressed with the Eastern European countries. When we arrived we had very little idea about what to expect but our experiences of Serbia, Bulgaria and Romania were just great, we couldn’t have been treated better.\n\nWe stayed in a range of accommodation options, the quirkiest had to be the Mongolian Yurt. Staying on the boat at Nantes was an unusual and not entirely successful start to the trip (we changed hotels having already paid for the next night). Some places were simple pensions, we stayed in two Retirement Villages, a gastronomic hotel where we were served a fantastic meal, maybe the best food that we’ve had anywhere. Most of all though, it was how friendly the people were, how welcome and safe we felt and how the variety added to the experience.\n\nIt was fitting to have finished the ride as we started, into strong headwinds, and pushing uphill – we were only missing the pouring rain. The best thing was being able to have had this adventure together.\n\nIt is sad to finish, but in the words of the sign that was once at the Serbian / Romanian border post at the Iron Gates Dam “Good bye. Your are leaving Serbia. Don’t cry because it’s over – smile because it happened. We wish your bike to always have tires full of air, and chain always ready to transfer your dreams to roads and paths”.\n\nThursday 11 July 2019, Day 57 Jurilovca to Tulcea. 63km (56km to Tulcea and 5km Sulina to the Black Sea) Total 4,390km\n\nDinner at Sailors Pub was equally as good as lunch, especially for Murray as he had pizza again. Good wine and good company made for an excellent dinner anyway!\n\nAs we were having a shorter day today we decided that we didn’t need too early a start and settled on a 7am departure. We needed to be in Tulcea by 1pm to make the ferry to Sulina, around 73km up the delta. After picking up breakfast, you guessed it; ham, salami and cheese and bread at the Profi Loco we were off.\n\nThe light headwind from yesterday was now a ferocious headwind and we headed back up past Sailors and very slowly out of town. The road was fine, with very little traffic through pretty agricultural land and a couple of small villages, but the going was very slow and grinding as we battled into the wind. With the number of wind farms in this region perhaps it is not surprising that they get the occasional blow.\n\nFeeling pretty worn out after only 37km we pulled into a little bar in Agighiol for cold drinks and a break, where we met a couple from Holland, cycling in the other direction. (I don’t know why they needed a rest as they must have had a massive tailwind). From Agighiol we had 10km of continuous climbing, not steeply but the headwind that had now turned into a full frontal didn’t make it any easier.\n\nGetting into Tulcea we followed Mike Well’s route – up and over the only cobblestone hill in Tulcea, classic Mike, but we did make it to the the ferry port, bought our ferry tickets and grabbed a quick but luxurious lunch – seafood platter and a bottle of wine – before boarding the Banat up the delta to Sulina.\n\nThe semi rapid ferry had us arriving in Sulina at 5.45pm and we made a quick dash the 2.5km out to the beach at the Black Sea for celebratory beers and some photos. We have an early start tomorrow to catch the ferry back to Tulcea at 7.00am and our Pensiunea Pluto are giving us a buffet breakfast at 6.\n\nWednesday 10 July 2019, Day 56 Mamaia Beach to Jurilovca 84km Total 4,357km\n\nWe had a very nice day off at Mamaia Beach, walks along the beach, lots of seafood and watching the tennis at Wimbledon on a very large screen at the White Towers beach bar.\n\nAs the temperatures are now back to normal we decided that we didn’t need such an early start, so after breakfast of scrambled eggs on toast followed by a couple of coffees – the apartment had a coffee machine and the owners had thoughtfully supplied us with a full box of pods! – we were on the road at 8am.\n\nWe left the Romanian Riviera of Mamaia Beach with its resorts and apartment buildings and once past the oil refinery, incongruously placed, we were soon on a quiet country road and back into agricultural land with more sunflowers, wheat and corn. The mornings ride was generally pushing steadily uphill and into a steady headwind – ahh. We passed through a number of small villages, stopping for cold drinks and ice creams at around 35kms. We continuing on along this very nice and quiet road and passed a couple of German cyclists (their Guten Tag greeting gave them away), heading the other way just before Mihai Viteazu. At Mihai Viteazu we joined the Dn22 (also the E87) a very busy main road without a shoulder where the cars and trucks whizzed by at speed and very close to our bodies for the next 10km into Baia. We were very pleased to get off this road and onto another quiet country road taking us the final 17km to Jurilovica.\n\nWe arrived in Juililova in time for lunch and found the Sailors Pub, a great little establishment where we shared whitebait and pizza before making our way to Pensiunea Anastasia. We seem to be the only people staying here and are enjoying the lovely sitting room, kitchen and a huge balcony all to ourselves.\n\nMonday 8 July 2019, Day 55, Adamclisi to Mamaia Beach Constanta – 84km Total 4,273km\n\nWe were up and ready to go on what is now our normal early start around 6.00am. After a quick trip up to the Trophaeum Traiasni monument, a 30 metre high monument erected by the Roman emperor Trajan (well obviously not him personally) to commemorate the Roman victory over the Dacians in AD 109 just 800m up the road, we were off. This has been included especially for our history teaching children.\n\nThe day started with a couple of climbs, not as steep as yesterday, and then levelled out into rolling hills. The road was busier than yesterday with more trucks and cars passing by us pretty closely and fast and we were already thinking that we would like to get off this road.\n\nWe had arranged to meet Arno at Cobadin, about 25 km along, for coffee and breakfast. Just as we came into town we found a restaurant which served excellent coffees and slightly strange but tasty omelets. Searching for an alternate route Google maps came up with a walking route which was the same distance to our destination but well away from the main road. At this stage we hadn’t decided which route we would take, we’d wait and see what the main road was like.\n\nBreakfast finished, we said our goodbyes to Arno. He was finishing this part of his ride in Constanta while we are heading on to Tulcea and had already booked accommodation at Mamaia Beach so this would be the last time that we would see him.\n\nThe next 18km into Murfatlar was a nightmare and just dangerous in places where there was no shoulder on the road at all. By now cars and trucks were screaming by very close to us and we were very keen to get off this road as soon as possible. We also got chased by a very determined dog along this section. He must have chased us for 500 metres getting in front of and almost under Murray’s front wheel. He seemed immune to the water bottle trick and didn’t give up until Joanne managed to land a direct squirt to his face.\n\nGetting into Murfatlar we had no hesitation in taking the walking route option. Initially it had us going towards Bucharest on the E81, another busy road but this wasn’t a problem as we were still in town and although there was a lot of traffic it was not moving too fast. Soon we turned off onto a dirt road which lead us through a rubbish tip and shanty housing – a bit dodgy but no traffic. We then joined a good asphalt road beside a canal with very little traffic for the majority of the distance and felt very pleased with ourselves. Google walking routes are often a bit dodgy and this one was no exception. At about 8km from the finish we found ourselves entering private property. We weren’t sure what it was but managed to convince the security guard that this was the way we had to go because that’s where our map was sending us! A big loop through a gravel mine took us back along the same canal along a dirt road and although the going was slow it was quiet.\n\nArriving in Mamaia Beach was a surprise. We had not expected it to be so pretty, that is once you get off the main road and down onto the beach. Our apartment Lamera is lovely with views both over the Black Sea and the lake.\n\nWe had a lovely lunch of seafood and pizza to celebrate making it to the Black Sea.\n\nSunday 7 July 2019, Day 54 Chiciu to Adamclisi 72km Total 4,189km\n\nHot and Hilly.\n\nHotel Baden turned out to be such a treat, being able to sit on the terrace last night overlooking the Danube eating pizza and fish. We had ordered breakfast to go again, the hotels don’t seem to mind this at all, and were on the ferry at 6.15am.\n\nOnce over the Danube we straight away headed into a gentle climb, followed by a steeper climb which was to be the flavour of the day. This region of Romania looks to be very wealthy with huge fields of sunflowers (think as far as you can see), wheat, corn and grapes. Slow and steady was the mantra of the day as we slowly whittled away the kilometres. The road was much quieter than expected with only the occasional truck and they were very polite not roaring past us so fast. Băneasa, a very nice little place, at the 42km mark was the first major town that we came to and we stopped here to eat our bagged breakfast, some cokes and got coffees from a bar. It was already starting to warm up as we started onward toward Ion Corvin with two steep uphill climbs, a steep down and another climb up to Ion Cronin. We stopped for cold drinks and ice creams before tackling the next climb on our way to Adamclisi where we are staying tonight.\n\nIon Corvin is the spot where you decide to either go to Constanta or stay with the official route, with the Danube, to Tulcea. Taking the turnoff to Constanta we passed a menagerie of farm animals, a flock of geese, and a raggedy herd of sheep and goats, a couple of donkeys and a few cows thrown in. The climb out of Ion Corvin was not particularly steep but it was long at about 5kms. After the summit we zig-zagged down hair pin corners and then back up again to Adamclisi to our hotel Pensiunea Trophaeum Traiani. We are eternally grateful that we read about this hotel mentioned in a random blog from an American couple as an alternative to Ion Corvin. Ion Corvin was looking like a sad second choice. Sadly the Americans had stayed at Ion Corvin, having what they described as a terrible night, only discovering this hotel’s existence when they rode past to visit the Trophaeum Traiani monument the next morning.\n\nWith a lovely room, air con, lunch and dinner, beers and wine we were happy and shared the whole experience with our friend Arno.\n\nTomorrow we go to the Black Sea.\n\nSaturday 6 July 2019, Day 53 Oltenita to Chiciu 79km Total 4,117km\n\nOur stay at Villa Europa surpassed our expectations, the owners were very friendly and we had a lovely room with a balcony, bikes were securely stored and the hotel has a very nice terrace restaurant where we had lunch and dinner. This hotel is obviously the place to be in Oltenita as groups of locals came in the evening for dinner or drinks. We were a bit more sluggish than usual leaving this morning but once downstairs we were greeted with our take away breakfasts and the offer of coffee. Overall a great stay.\n\nAgain on today’s ride there was no navigation required, just head straight down the road, the Dn 31, through a continuous string of villages. It was pleasant cycling waving hola to the locals out and about, the road was almost entirely flat, pretty smooth and we made good time only stopping a couple of times for breakfast on a bench by the road and a Pepsi and ice-cream at a neat and clean magazin mixt where the owners cleared a table in the shade for us a little later.\n\nThe landscape was much the same as recent days – crop farming, a few carts and horses, herds of sheep (always with shepherd in tow) and a string of villages that was more continuous today and perhaps a little more prosperous looking overall. We were again on the terrace above the river flat for much of the time and the occasional views over the flat land were welcome changes.\n\nThe final 8km stretch into Calarasi was horrendous on a very stressful busy main road with no shoulder. Luckily and unexpectedly we only stayed on this road for about 3km turning off toward Constanta and by-passing Calarasi and most of the traffic which took us directly to the ferry crossing at Chiciu where we had booked into the Hotel Baden.\n\nBack on the Danube at Chiciu we had a lovely lunch at the Restaurant Monica, a popular spot with road cyclists and locals from nearby Calarasi. To our surprise, Arno from Brazil turned up and we had a great chat over lunch.\n\nWe are looking forward to the first real hilly section of the Budapest to the Black Sea leg as we make our way to Adamclisi tomorrow.\n\n\\\n\nFridqay 5 July 2019, Day 52, Ruse to Oltenita Romania 91km Total 4,038km\n\nAnother 6.00am start today to get over the “Friendship Bridge” before things got too unfriendly. As usual we had the normal delays, the first one waiting needlessly at the toll station (bikes don’t pay the toll) and then queuing to get through immigration and it wasn’t until 7.30 that had made the 12kms to the start of the day’s stage and we were back in Romania and on our way.\n\nThe stay in Bulgaria and Apart Intrigue was fantastic. We have been very impressed with our two short forays into Bulgaria and enjoyed the more cosmopolitan feel to the place.\n\nWe ended up by-passing Giurgiu again. Perhaps it is a very attractive city or maybe we missed nothing, but we were on our way to Oltenita and still looking for breakfast. The route was once again very straight forward firstly on the very busy Dn5, which we were very pleased to get off, and then on the Dn41. Once on the Dn41 the route is mainly undulating with a few steeper climbs. Today would rate as one of the more hilly days that we have had for some time.\n\nAfter passing lots of Magazin Mixtis and small bars that didn’t look all that inviting we found a Profi Loco where we were able to get a very fine but now very repetitive breakfast of bread, cheese, ham and salami. Cycling on passing a number of villages, including one particularly pretty village with the streets lined with trees and rose bushes in full flower, we met a French couple who were heading to Oltenita as well. They had stopped to replace a tyre and tube, with the surprisingly good luck for them that there was a bike shop in the little village that had the right sized tyre and tube. I think that we would struggle if the same happened to us, with 28 inch tyres not being very easy to come by.\n\nWe said our goodbyes and headed on, hoping to see them either on the road or in Oltenita, as the sky was becoming increasingly black. The wind was picking up and so was our speed as we raced along searching for somewhere to take cover. Just as the first huge splodges of rain fell we turned a corner to see some grain storage sheds. We quickly rode in, sharing the space with four dogs and a farmer who had pulled in in his tractor just after us as the rain and the wild wind lashed the sheds. We hoped that the French couple had managed to get into the last village and find some cover as well.\n\nOff again, but not really sure that the storm had passed we headed for the next village, with the sky still looking threatening, 7km down the road. Oltenita was now only 15km away but we still had another couple of short climbs before reaching the very nice Villa Europa where we are staying tonight. What we saw of Oltenita was not encouraging – lots of industry and very little in the way of restaurants or even pleasant places to stop – so our little hotel with its lovely garden restaurant was a real find.\n\nBorder crossings, more hilly than in recent times and a wild and woolly storm made for a good and interesting day, passing 4,000kms.\n\n\\\n\nThursday 4 July, 2019 Zimnicea to Ruse, Bulgaria 74km Total 3,947km\n\nAnother early start, we were on the bikes just after 6am with feast of a breakfast of ham, cheese, salad, bread and bottles of water, enough for four to go, provided by the Hotel Inter. It was not going to be as hot today, 29 degrees instead of the crazy 38 yesterday, but it was still good to be riding in the cool of the morning. The route was again very straight forward – stay on the Dn5c all the way to Giurgiu. The scenery hasn’t changed much again today, more sunflowers, corn and wheat. On the quieter road there were more horse and carts today and we saw a lot more Romany gypsies. The villages seemed poorer, and we had our breakfast in a not very salubrious spot on a bench outside someone’s home because the bar was full of men having their brekky beers and wine and who looked like they had been there a while (really? At 8:30?). We did get coffees and Pepsi’s from the little shop that was doubling as a bar though.\n\nContinuing onward after breakfast, riding fairly quickly, it looked like we would be in Ruse by 11!. Just before Giurgiu we diverted to a very rough road along a canal by-passing Giurgiu to the Friendship bridge and over into Bulgaria. The Friendship bridge wasn’t very friendly, being 2.8km long, narrow and without a cycle path – the footpath was too narrow to cycle on. Luckily we managed to get across without too many semis screaming past. We will make sure that we are on the bridge early tomorrow morning to avoid too much traffic when we head back into Romania.\n\nWe ended up not getting into Ruse until midday having to queue firstly at the Friendship Bridge toll and then at the border crossing into Bulgaria. The Bulgarian border official was questioning why we weren’t continuing our ride in Bulgaria saying it was much more beautiful than Romania!\n\nAfter a delicious long lunch at the Happy Bar and Grill in the lovely old town centro of Ruse we found our way to the very impressive Apartman Intrigue. There is a reason that it scores 10 on the Booking.com site. A lazy afternoon in the heat of the day and a stroll back to Centro for dinner rounded out the day nicely.\n\nWednesday 3 July 2019, Day 50. Islaz to Zimnicea 67km Total 3,843km\n\nAnother embarrassing early arrival, 10.45am at our destination Zimnicea. We left the oasis that is Villa Giulia at 6.45am after a great breakfast. Breakfast doesn’t normally start until 7am but as we wanted to get an early start to beat the heat the owner was happy to get up early to make us breakfast at 6:00 – good coffee, cold meats, omelettes, freshly made apricot jam – couldn’t have been better. We didn’t end up leaving quiet as early as planned as there were problems with the credit card machine but the few extra minutes didn’t make much difference.\n\nOnce back through the village of Islaz we powered along past farmland with fields of sunflowers, corn, wheat and some grapes, similar to the last few days, to Turnu Magurele. Once through Turnu Magurele we turned onto the much less trafficked Dn 51a, a mildly undulating road passing through a number of small villages. Although the speed limit is 50km/hr along here many of the cars were whizzing by much faster than that, a bit worrying on such a narrow road with no shoulder.\n\nAlong this section are a stretches of ornate but unfinished houses which according to Mike Wells have been built by Gypsy families as a way to demonstrate their wealth – very strange as they are unfinished and mostly boarded up! Shortly after this stretched-out village the EV6 takes a horse shoe bending back on itself on onto Zimnicea. As we were stopped to check our maps a driver stopped and directed us, pointing to a side road that cut off about 3km from the official route. As it was now starting to heat up we were happy to take a short cut. We have found the Romanians to be very friendly and helpful even when they have little or no English.\n\nIt was along the short cut that we saw two German or maybe Scandinavian girls (cycling just in nicks and sports bras!). We have not seen any other touring cyclists for a few days, not since meeting up with Arno in Drobeta, but then just outside Zimnicea saw two more guys at a bar.\n\nZimnicea is a pretty non-descript town with one big building, our hotel – Hotel Inter, which is quite modern and nice. We will reserve judgement when we hear that they have got the air conditioning to work. The restaurant is good though – a pity that it is way too hot to use the very nice terrace.\n\nTuesday 2 July 2019, Day 49. Bechet to Islaz – 69km Total 3,776km\n\nToday was a shorter day, just 69km but predicted to be very hot. AccuWeather’s description for today was 36 degrees, blazing sunshine, hot and humid and dangerous for outdoor activities! So it was another early start and we were on the road with our packed breakfast from the hotel at 6.30am. We feel a bit like frauds as we arrive at our day’s destination before lunch but it is nice not riding in the blazing heat of the day.\n\nToday’s route had us sticking to the Dn54 which was busier than yesterday, with more ups and downs and some long straight sections. Sadly we saw an accident just outside Corabia where two horses had evidently been hit by a truck and killed.\n\nThe scenery is pretty much the same as yesterday, with more fields of corn, wheat and sunflowers. There were still horses and carts on the road, but fewer with the traffic building.\n\nWe arrived at the lovely Villa Giulia at around 11.30, which is undeniably an early end to the day, but we were able to enjoy a lovely lunch in their large gardens – initially thinking we were the only ones staying here until a big group of young people arrived to dominate the pool! A relaxed afternoon in the gardens and pool – couldn’t be better in this crazy heat.\n\nMonday 1 July 2019, Day 48 Vidin to Bechet Romania 112km Total 3,709km\n\nAfter a very pleasant stay and rest day at Hotel Anna Kristina enjoying the pool, pizza at the bar and great seafood at the Danube-side restaurant just a spit way, it was time to be back on the bikes. Today was a big day, 112km and with temperatures predicted to top 35 degree we decided that an early start was needed. As we were leaving before breakfast started the lovely people at Anna Kristina prepared breakfast boxes for us. We were on the road before sunrise and 10kms on at the bridge before the border post to Romania as the sun rose over the Danube – a beautiful start. We found a much quieter route to the border than we took coming in, not having us on the E79 at all, although at this time of day even the E79 was pretty quiet.\n\nOver the border and back in Romania we were back on the 55A but now much, much quieter without all of the trucks, it was like a different road altogether. We were to stay on the 55A for the whole day passing numerous small villages but with only a few places for us to stop for a drink or a break. The villagers here are very friendly, waving and wishing us “bon courage” – I’m sure in my best Romanian that’s what they were saying.\n\nCycling along we passed endless golden fields of sunflowers as well as corn and wheat and there are apricot and cherry trees lining the road. Perhaps one lady was not so friendly when she caught Joanne stealing cherries from the tree in front of her house (more than a bit of her father in her)!\n\nWe also passed dozens and dozens of horse or even donkey drawn carts, they seem to be the main form of transport for the locals in these parts. That, along with the sheep or goat herders or shepherds with every flock and the cutting of grass with scythes and loading of hay with pitch forks, made it feel like we had transported back in time as well as to another country.\n\nWe really did get on with the job of making the kilometres before the sun really punished us and we made it into Bechet by noon, not bad considering the distance, and enjoyed lunch at a pizza place not far from our Hotel Tata Si Fii (Father and Sons). It must have been the sons who checked us in and offered cold beers – they are very used to welcoming cyclists here.\n\nIt was by now very hot and we were thankful for the early start. A good day.\n\nSaturday 29 June 2019, Day 47. Gruia to Vidin Bulgaria. 67km Total 3597km\n\nToday was a day of fields of sunflowers and later endless trucks.\n\nWe got off to an early start from Pensiunea Gruia back up a steep climb to Gruia church, not because we had a big distance to go but so that we cycled in the cool of the morning. It was quiet at this time of day with just the older folk out getting the bread and some old codgers having a brekky beer, is 7.00am too early!\n\nThe sunflowers seem to have come into flower overnight and there are fields of them as far as the eye can see. There was very little traffic at this time of day as we came upon farmers out with their herds of goats and riding along in horse drawn carts. All too soon we were to turn back onto 56A and the onslaught of semi trailers. They were continuous but really pretty courteous and not passing too close. We managed to get some breakfast at a supermarket in Cetate and ate on a bench at a nearby children’s park, we had hoped for a restaurant but it wasn’t to be. Once we turned onto the E79 the number of trucks multiplied making us keep our heads down as we again clung to the edge of the road until we made it to the turn off to Vidin and the Bulgarian border.\n\nWe realised why there were so many truck as we saw them queueing at the border post. After cokes and coffees at a very neat and tidy cafe at a petrol station just on the turn-off to the border we skirted around what must have been kilometres of trucks waiting to have their papers cleared and cross over the border. Into Bulgaria to our surprise there was no border post and we headed along the now quiet E79 – all the trucks were stuck back at the border, and into Vidin. Vidin is a strange sort of town, with heavy signs of the Soviet days here in run-down concrete apartment blocks. We are staying over by the river which is lovely with bars and cafe/ restaurants and our hotel Anna Christina, but other parts of town are not so attractive and the centre seems low-key (Armidale on Saturday afternoon?) We are looking forward to a day off tomorrow – by the river and in very pleasant surroundings – before heading back into Romania for a bigaturday\n\nFriday, 28 June 2019. Day 46, Drobeta to Gruia 66km Total 3530km\n\nThe road out of Drobeta was horrendous, we were back on the E70 and then on the no less busy 56A for the first 16km, great roads for semi-trailers, but neither a place for cyclists to be.\n\nWe had planned an early start from our Hotel Clipa but with our breakfast supplies having spent a hot day in the panniers and then overnight in the fridge that was either turned off or didn’t work we were lured to stay later for a fresh breakfast. Possibly better than the food poisoning that would have ensued – ahh, memories of days in Basel. We were at breakfast at 7.00am where were we met Arno from Brazil who we had cycled with a few days ago. Poor Arno had come to grief with a cracked rim and had to change his plans and come to Drobeta to get a new wheel and new tires – all well though and he had a day off to recoup the spirits.\n\nThe E70 was no less busy than yesterday as we came into town and the 56A was no better as we clung to the narrow shoulder where it existed with the speeding cars and trucks screaming by. Turning off at Hinova after 16kms things improved substantially with some quiet and the ability to look around without worrying about being skittled. The road now stuck to the wide and fast flowing river until Batoji where we turned away into quiet farming country, some hills, a cold drink stop and a bit of ad hoc route changes heading toward Gruia. The heat was gathering seriously and there were no stops where we would have liked them, but the route to Gruia and our Pensiunea Gruia way down the hill at the river was smooth going.\n\nOur stop for the night is a riverside hotel in the middle of nowhere – no signs to it from the main road, a closed gate at the hotel and good luck that a man with some horses at the farm next door saw us and headed in to alert the management. No one here speaks English and things were looking a bit grim as the young woman on duty didn’t seem really in charge, but then the owner arrived (still no English at all – but a lot of rapid Romanian and plenty of expectation that we would understand) and we managed lunch (like dinner – just arriving with a smile), drinks and a relaxed afternoon. We also have the company of a group of locals who have arrived for a night of partying – with all the fresh (and not so fresh) Romanian hits that everyone is enjoying.\n\nVery good to be here – and very conscious that we didn’t really know if we had a room\n\nThursday 27 June 2019. Day 45 – Donji Milanovac to Drobeta-Turnu Severin 67km Total 3462km\n\nToday is described as the most spectacular stage of this last section of the EV6 and the day we enter Romania.\n\nOur very simple guest house Rooms Jankovic turned out to be a lovely surprise despite the shared bathroom and no air con. Our room was large – not having a space wasting ensuite, and with a balcony opening over the Danube. It was quiet enough and mozzie free to allow us to have the windows and shutters open and get a good night’s sleep (unlike our Irish neighbours who kept the windows tightly sealed in fear of mosquitoes and complained of not getting any sleep).\n\nToday is another shorter day of just 67km but the weather is predicted to go above 30 so we made an early start, after a very nice but unexpected breakfast, and headed off towards Romania. We also had the last 4 tunnels with the first one 371 metres, being the longest of the numbered twenty one tunnels. The second tunnel was not much shorter at 285 metres. These tunnels are pitch black and often with bends and we had a truck passing us during the second tunnel, extremely nerve racking as it is hard to see where the edge of the road is and it was not the time to come off the bike!\n\nThe stage lived up to its description and the view was spectacular with Danube cutting through the last part of the Iron Gates gorge and now just 150 metres across at the point called The Cauldron (reducing from 5kms wide a day ago to 150m is something and the power of this mighty river was awesome).\n\nWe continued on alongside the river looking across at the towns and villages on the Romanian side before a 4km climb passing the largest rock sculpture in Europe – a huge head of Decebalus Rex. Very impressive. It was hot by now and we enjoyed the cooling wind on the long descent back to the river, finding a lovely beach-side spot for a beer and relax before heading on to the border.\n\nThe crossing into Romania is via a road over a dam, complete with official border posts and the promise of dire consequences for photography. The cloud cover which had kept us cooler early in the day had now lifted and it was hot as we joined a very busy road, riding along a very narrow shoulder, with huge trucks whizzing by into Drobeta.\n\nOur home for the night in the quite big city (86,000) of Drobeta is the Hotel Clipa, a great place with a big room and a fabulous terrace restaurant that seems to be the place to hang out for the young and upwardly mobile here.\n\nWednesday 26 June 2019. Golubac to Donji Milanovac 56km Total 3395km\n\nAfter making breakfast of fried pancetta and eggs, orange juice and apricots enjoyed on the balcony of our lovely Apartment Bogic we were cycling out of town beside the Danube at 8.30. Today was a shorter day of just 56km firstly passing the Golubac fortress, a Mesolithic village dating from 5000BC and the four gorges collectively known as the Iron Gates. Unfortunately the fortress was not opened yet, meaning that we missed the chance to cycle through one of the castle gates and had to make do with views from the road.\n\nWe had not even got out of town when we discovered that Joanne’s lights were not working. This was an issue as today was also the day of 17 tunnels! Luckily we were prepared for this happening and had bought along spare attachable lights, Joanne’s lights have been dodgy ever since they were damaged en-flight to the Hanoi to Saigon ride in 2016-7.\n\nMost of the tunnels were not too long and you could see through to the end but a couple were long and dark and it was hard to gauge where the side of the road was. One of the cyclists that we met yesterday at Stara Palanka caught up with us just before the first tunnel and followed through with us – we didn’t think that he had any lights. Thankfully we didn’t come across one of the many trucks inside the tunnels.\n\nAfter a stop, and a very welcome coke at the Mesolithic village, the temperature was really starting to build up as we heading on to a steep 2 km climb followed by a steep descent into the outskirts of Donji Milanovic and continued into town and a very nice lunch beside a tourist market at the docks.\n\nDespite the building heat today was a good day with a couple of short climbs, one a steep one, with fantastic views of the Danube across to Romania on the far bank arriving at our guest house Rooms Jankovic in the early afternoon. Rooms Jankovic has been a lovely surprise as despite having shared bathrooms and not having air con it is a lovely family run small hotel where the host has washed our cycling clothes and provided us with beers on the terrace.\n\nTuesday 25 June 2019. Kovin to Golubac 78km total 3339km\n\nThere were definitely two stages to today’s ride separated by the ferry at Stara Palanka. The ferry only runs every 3 hours so it was important to arrive at the ferry crossing in time to avoid a long wait. We headed off from Kod Cileta hotel restaurant around 8.30. We weren’t in a hurry this morning as we had decided to avoid the very slow and bumpy unsealed dyke and take the road, only rejoining the dyke for the last 4.5km into Stara Palanka. The road was smooth, fairly flat and with not too much traffic and the occasional truck. We made good time, having just one cold drink break at the junction of where the dyke route meets the road and got to Stara Palanka just before 10.45. Once there we discovered that the timetable has changed with the ferry departing on the half hour every 3 hours so we ended up having just missed the 10.30 ferry. We spent the next two and a half hours relaxing in the shade with a couple of beers followed by lunch being entertained watching the Serbian army going about their training with heavy vehicles and semi submersibles. Not very much seemed to be getting done, but they enjoyed lunch at the restaurant too – beers and all.\n\nGetting on the ferry we met an Irish couple who had come via the dyke this morning and they reported that it was very rough, potholed with knee high grass – not pleasant. We were glad that we took the road option. They also BOTH had punctures having ridden through an area of wood thorns. There are signs warning cyclists about this – they showed us the photo!\n\nOnce over the Danube to Ram, an attractive small town, with bars and restaurants and the Ram fort right on the riverside. After a short climb out of Ram it was mostly undulating or flat for the whole of the second section but it was getting getting hot and we were racing what looked like savage thunderstorms coming across the river from Romania – that didn’t arrive after all.\n\nWe arrived in Golubac just after 4 and headed straight to our lodgings at Apartman Bogic for showers before beers by the Danube and a relaxed evening in this quiet riverside village. The river here is 5kms wide (!) and magnificent – facing the iron gates gorges that we strike tomorrow.\n\nMonday 24 June 2019. Belgrade to Kovin 58km Total 3,261km\n\nWe headed off this morning after a very relaxing 2 days off in Belgrade staying at our lovely apartment Basco Knez Mahailova. While not the actual centre of Belgrade, Knez Mahailova is the Social Centre with bars and restaurants just everywhere. While this break was planned for Murray to do reports and catch up with general emailing and correspondence it was also an opportunity just to relax for a couple of days.\n\nAfter hauling panniers and bikes down the tiny elevator it was back on the bikes, but later than anticipated due to the heavy morning rain. The route out of Belgrade was straight forward enough but after the build up of heat over the last few days Sunday evening saw a huge storm with extremely heavy rain which caused flooding in the city streets. We crossed over a long bridge over the Danube, one of the few sightings of the river again today, heavy now not with rain but traffic. The cycle path only starts about a third of the way across with a 10 inch high curb to mount in the traffic. Luckily for us there wasn’t much traffic at that point and we were able to very quickly dismount and lift the bikes onto the cycle / footpath. Once over the bridge the route turns firstly onto a gravel track and then the first of the unsealed dykes for the day. Unfortunately the rain flooded the gravel track and made the dyke impassable with mud. Only 500m down facing the completely flooded track we decided that the only way today was along the E70. Who would have thought that the E70 would have a lovely bus lane all the way to the turn off to Pancevo and we whizzed along.\n\nStopping for a coffee break at Pancevo we met another cyclist, Arno from Brazil, who was going the same way but had got 4km down the muddy dyke before turning back to join the main road. Arno rode with us for a while, but he didn’t have a Serbian sim so had no maps and was struggling with his navigation. Arno is a real character, he has done a lot of cycling and we met him again in Kovin where we had lunch together.\n\nThe last stretch into Kovin continued pleasantly along the paved country roads with minimal traffic. Today was a short day and after the morning storms developed into a lovely day with perfect cycling conditions. Kovin is a small and pleasant town with cafes, restaurants and a good feel. We are staying at the guesthouse Kod Cileta which has a restaurant and bar and has given us a great afternoon.\n\nFriday 21 June 2019. Novi Sad to Belgrade 95km Total 3205km\n\nToday started and ended on busy roads with heavy traffic so close they could have shaved our legs but there was a lot of pleasant riding through small pretty villages in between as well.\n\nWith another early start we were on our way at 6.00am but very soon onto the busy main road out of Novi Sad, then too briefly off the main road through the small and very pretty village of Sremski before rejoining the main road to climb 4km up a steady 5% grade. The climb itself was fine but the road had an intermittent and very narrow shoulder which had the passing cars, buses and trucks scarily close to us. At the top of the climb we thankfully turned off this road and were then on small sealed and sometimes quiet rough roads through a series of small villages.\n\nAfter a bumpy cobblestone section we had a picnic breakfast at a busy intersection in Beska and were thankful for the early start as this first 25km took us 2 hours to complete with the heavy traffic and the climb. It was warming up and we had short break for ice cream, Coke Zero and to buy more water at the end of the first stage at the road junction of Stari Slankemen and Novi Slankamen and then another break at a bar for more Coke Zero 15km along at Belegis.\n\nFrom Belegis we continued on generally descending through farming villages through to an urban sprawl of 3 villages where a random vehicle nearly took Murray out – it looked deliberate as the driver seemed to take no notice at all, even as we crawled passed the car door. From there it was on to Batajnica where the traffic started to build up again and we found ourselves again in heavy traffic for 10km, although it seemed a lot more than this, until the small riverside village of Zemun. What a treat Zemun was, right on the banks of the Dunav lined with restaurants and boats – a delight for lunch before heading into Belgrade.\n\nToday we saw our first flowering sunflowers. No photos unfortunately as we were concentrating on not being squished. The final short section into the Serbian capital was on bike ways through parkland and then over the river – all lovely and scenic and returning us to calm before arriving at Basco Knez Milhailova which is really the people centre of Belgrade – walking streets, lines of cafes and restaurants and full of life – a great place to be\n\nThursday June 20, 2019. Vukovar Croatia to Novi Sad Serbia 85km Total 3108kms\n\nYesterday’s early start inspired us so we skipped breakfast at the hotel, much to our host’s dismay, and were on the road just after 6am. The day gets going a bit later in Croatia and it was difficult finding somewhere open to get breakfast. So, it was on to the next village or maybe the one after but we came to an open Bosco at 7am, so it had just opened, and managed to get bread, prosciutto, cheese and a couple of peaches – lovely. I know that this sounds very much like lunch but on a cycling trip meals become interchangeable.\n\nThe first stage of today’s ride was 40km firstly through undulating farmland and then including the steep-ish ups and downs through four Coombes (and English term used by the guru Mike Wells – a village in a short valley). Our EV6 app became very confused through Ilok towards the end of the stage just before the border crossing and after a scenic detour up to the church and a fort we managed to find our way again. Both border crossings, out of Croatia and into Serbia, were smooth and pretty efficient. .\n\nSuccessfully making our way into Serbia at the border town of Backa Palanga we felt we deserved a beer break at a bar. We also more productively got some Serbian cash and a morning snack before starting down the extremely busy road for the second stage of the day.\n\nMike had said that there were two long sections of dyke that were unsurfaced but there was an alternate route to avoid these. We had had enough of unsurfaced dykes so decided to take the alternate route. That was until we had spent half an hour with cars and trucks whizzing by at speed and very impatient so that they felt just centimetres away. We both decided it was the dyke whether they were unsurfaced or not. As it turned out the dyke gods were smiling on us. Since Mike’s book was published the whole length of the dyke is now beautifully surfaced in dark grey bitumen with only the very occasional car. Sometimes you can place too much faith in Mike, but that’s another matter.\n\nThe new dyke path took at least an hour off from the time it would have taken to ride into Novi Sad so we were there in time for a late lunch of pub burgers and chips just near Apartmani Eleganza @ La Vista where we are staying tonight – a great little place. With dinner at a trendy bar just by the apartment Novi Sad has been a lovely introduction to Serbia.\n\nWednesday June 19, 2019. Mohacs to Vukovar 120km Total 3,023km\n\nCracked 3,000km !\n\nWith a big day ahead of us we planned an early start, wanting to be on the road at 6.00am, and we made it. It was lovely cycling this early, cooler and with just a few people about. We started the day riding along a friendly dyke right beside the Danube or the Duna in Hungary. We soon left the dyke and also left the Danube, only to come upon it briefly during the day, onto small roads and then the much busier Route 56, also known as E73 (read scary international road) to the border crossing with Croatia. This is the first proper border crossing that we have come across (uniformed people with weapons who want to see papers) but it was very efficient and friendly.\n\nInto Croatia the landscape hasn’t changed very much, still lots of vegetables, corn and wheat, grapes and apricots but the the cars whizzing by are much more humble. We even saw a horse drawn cart but we think this was for “joy rides” not as transport.\n\nThere was one hill just after coming into Croatia which had us briefly back into low gears and standing on the pedals. It was a bit of a shock after so long cruising along beside the river.\n\nWe made the first stop at Osijek for cool drinks and to pick up some lunch. Osijek is a big town, but had a nice feel to the area around the fort that we stopped at. 75kms in before 11:00 was a bit surreal, but needed, and we were away with lunch by 12:30 for an hour before our proper stop – some seats in a small village that did the trick.\n\nThe final 30kms into Vukovar was uneventful really – more traffic than we have been used to, a minor 1.5km hill and plenty of agricultural scenery. Making it to our very nice Villa Vadin Pansion for the night. Just us and two other cycling tourists here and just us for dinner – complete with entertaining attempts at translation. Happy to be here – and to have the mosquitoes outside (they were described by the owner here as ‘catastrophique’ and not normal, so that is encouragin\n\nTuesday 18 June 2019 Day 37 Baga to Mohacs – 34km Total – 2903km\n\nA very short day on the bikes today, just 34km with the idea for Murray to get on to the next bout of report writing. After initially heading off on a completely wrong path, really a walking path of loose gravel that had us skidding all over the path, we quickly regained the route but straight away ran into roadworks. A new bridge is being built where we were meant to cross. Taking a deviation was going to take us way out of the way so it was worth asking the construction workers if we could walk through. They were happy to let us through but that hasn’t always been the case at other roadworks sites.\n\nWe were then on a small country road for just a few kilometres before rejoining the dyke. After the heavy rain last night the dyke was wet, soft and very slow going. A kindly old farmer explained in very fast Hungarian that the adjacent road joins the EV6 route a few kilometres along and getting the gist of what he was saying we took his advice.\n\nNow we were properly on our way along a small very quiet road with an excellent bitumen tarmac and a slight tailwind behind us all the way to Mohacs ferry. Waiting at the ferry we were attacked by mozzies but now had super strength insect repellent (more agent orange than insect repellent).\n\nMohacs is a very pretty little town and today we have seen a steady steam of touring cyclists as they stopped at one of the many bars before heading on. It is a pity that we are not here around Easter when the local folk dress in sheep hides, cows horns on their heads and wooden masks daubed in animal blood. Why not!\n\nA small miscalculation of the daily kilometres will see us on a longer than intended day tomorrow but for now we are enjoying a pizza lunch in the pedestrian mall and tonight’s accommodation at the Hotel Centrum.\n\nMonday 17 June – Day 36 – Dunafoldvar to Baja – 96kms – Total 2,869kms\n\nToday was going to be a slighter shorter day than yesterday and although the day was predicted to be cooler the temperature was still reaching a high of 27 with high humidity as well, so we had planned an earlier start which turned out to be not so early 8.30. Loading the bikes up we were attacked by mozzies, apparently this is a problem during the summer here as we had the same problem, but much more intensive (they were swarming like army ants over a dead body), at lunch time. Murray dashed to the coop for insect repellent and after visiting three shops returned with insect repellent spray (the shopkeepers own partly used bottle as they were sold out !) and coils which did the trick.\n\nDunafoldvar is off the main EV6 route so we continued 28km down an alternate route along quiet country roads passing apricot orchards, corn and vegetable fields and vineyards to the ferry at Paks. The ferry only runs hourly so it was hit and miss whether we would make it and we only did with five minutes to spare – with some more intensity in the pedaling than usual.\n\nFrom Gederlak, back on the main route, we continued along small country roads until Fokto where we were again on the Danube dyke with varying degrees of surface structure from grassy track, sandy gravel with the back tyres slipping out to lovely smooth but narrow road surfaces running alongside the Danube giving us occasional glimpses of the river.\n\nLunch was looking like it wasn’ t going to happen as there is not a lot along this stretch but popping into Fajsz we found the coop and managed to get bread, cheese ham and salami and with the addition of the insect repellent we were able to enjoy lunch, keeping the mozzies at bay, in a park by the church.\n\nWe were both feeling weary with the heat for the final section into Baja but from here the track was very smooth making the going much easier. We arrived into Baja around 4.00pm and enjoyed cold beers in the Centrum before checking into Hotel Kaiser Panzio, a very smart establishment\n\nSunday 16 June – Day 36 – Budapest to Dunafoldvar – 110kms – Total 2,773kms\n\nThe past three weeks has been a break from the bikes as we headed to the UK for more business-like things. The bikes had been stored at the very impressive ‘K2’ bike shop in Budapest (big recommendation – lots of work needed like new cassette, chain, bottom bracket, break pads and the rolloff gears needing work too – all done incredibly well done and good value).\n\nFirst day back on the bikes after being in the UK and we were less organised than we should have been and has been in the past. It was 9.30 before we headed over the Chain Bridge, butgetting out of Budapest was incredibly easy and straight forward. Past the spectacular Parliament House, over the famous Chain Bridge, and onto the bike path heading South out of the city.\n\nIt wasn’t too long after leaving Budapest that we met our first hurdle. Road works over a bridge crossing with no alternate instructions (other than from a helpful local who gave great detail in Hungarian which we nodded to and headed off to follow) had us on a busy road and out of our way. Surviving the traffic we were soon onto the first of the very rough sections of road that were to dominate the day – bouncing in unflattering fashion for cyclist and bike alike – and which slowed us down so much. The roads were beautiful though, along parallel tributaries to the Danube and through forests and fields of vegetables.\n\nAfter a short stop for a diet pepsi at what was clearly a beer and seafood only open-air place, we met the second challenge of the day, following a clear EV6 sign away from the route that our app was showing. We were turning back when two German tourers, also heading for the Black Sea, showed up and said they were following the sign, thinking it was a new road. We followed suit, in a rather poor judgement, and added a good distance to the day and lots of confusion doing it – not another sign in sight, way off track and in traffic. We did make it back to the track though, at Rackeve.\n\nWe had expected to make it to Rackeve (supposed to be 54kms) before lunch despite the late start, but it was a long 54kms and we stopped at a very popular lake with hundreds of Hungarian families for lunch – including cold beers. Very nice, but made our arrival at the half way mark very late and we pushed on.\n\nThe afternoon session began well, through alternating smooth and very rough sections of paved road, before we came to another dyke. Not as friendly as previous dykes, it was not only unsurfaced, but covered in thick and rough grass. It was a bouncy journey and slowed things down a lot, even though we were motivated by the thunder and lightning all around (for hours – and it did pour down on us later) and feeling just a bit exposed with our metal bikes on the dyke. We made it through though and onto the steady road leading the bridge to Dunafoldvar.\n\nSome clever negotiation at the first patisserie we came to ledus to our digs at an apartment a few hundred metres away – and then a great seafood dinner back at the river. A long and challenging day for the first one back on the bikes – but certainly finished well!\n\n25 May 2019, Day 33 Sturovo to Budapest 85km Total 2663kms\n\nWe farewelled the lovely people at Artemis Wellness Resort, said goodbye to Slovakia and were over the bridge back into Hungary at 8.40am. The path took us around the Esztergom Basilica, massive and very impressive, and then along the Danube. We really hadn’t at this stage decided which route we would take but we needed to be in Budapest before 4.00pm to get to K2 Bike shop before they close for the weekend. We felt that we had plenty of time to make this, but this was before we hit the first flooded section of the path. The Danube water level is very high and there were three flooded sections of increasing depths, up to Joanne’s thigh height at one before our first ferry crossing. This of course slowed us down considerably and we didn’t make the first ferry crossing at Szob that we were planning to make. We were concerned, along with other cyclists who had come through the water that the other side of the river would be similarly flooded but there was no need to worry. Although the water was over the path in a couple of spots it was rideable (wet shoes rideable) all of the way. We had to make a decision now whether to follow Mike’s path which runs along a main road without a cycle path or to stay on the mostly very well made cycle way on to Vac. The path to Vac won out, adding another 11kms to the day, but avoiding quite a bit of road – just another good decision.\n\nAfter Vac the path varied from small roads to very busy roads with heavy traffic with trucks and buses, friendly dykes and very, very rough tracks. Enid showing her displeasure at one of the rougher sections again throwing her slipper, but she was cajoled back into good behaviour.\n\nLunch today was at a great little pizzeria in Szentendre. We were lucky to get a table as they turned away people coming after us. Pizza, beer and wine, perfect for athletes on a mission with a deadline, and then we were on our way. The final section of a little over 20kms was another mixture of very rough tracks and some road, and then into town. The route into this big capital city was cruisey and nice – all on cycle tracks and easy navigation – right to our bike shop where they were expecting us and looked after us well again. K2 Bikes in Budapest – a great option.\n\nSo ends the 3rd section of our ride – more than 60% of the distance and days done and the unchartered Bulgarian and Romanian sections to come – but no doubt in warmer weather.\n\n24 May 2019, Day 32 – Kamarno to Sturovo – 53km\n\nWith a very short day ahead, our shortest of the trip, we had leisurely breakfast chatting to another cycling couple from Melbourne who were heading on to the same destination as us. Karmarno has given us a very pleasant surprise. We hadn’t expected very much from the town after our previous visit here not even being able to find a restaurant, but it is actually a very pretty place. This time around we found the true centre Kamarno with a huge and very attractive central square with lots of restaurants and wine bars. We even accidentally tried to gate crash a private party at a small and very attractive wine bar, no wonder we got such strange looks from the people there as we walked in.\n\nMike’s route is along the south bank but on reading his description and not being too impressed with it, we decided on taking the north side although this was also the same route we has taken in 2017. The couple from the restaurant on a self guided tour were also taking this way but we were not to see them again today.\n\nWe easily found our way out of town following the banks of the Danube past the Kamarno fortress and walls and then sailed along with the tailwinds along a dyke. We then spent a short time along a road before veering off right alongside the river and then through a forest. There is one strange point where the path stops at a small inlet and we had to clamber down the grass embankment and up over some sort of concrete structure – not a bridge but in effect serving as one. This north bank route then had us travelling for 8kms over some very small and rough tracks. With both our bikes being mechanically challenged, Joanne’s with slipping gears and Murray’s seat strut having snapped and holding in place by less than a centimetre we gave the rough path a miss instead taking a slightly shorter route along a fairly busy road.\n\nWe ended up arriving in Sturovo very early at 11am feeling a bit silly to be only coming this far. If we hadn’t already made a hotel booking and paid for it we would have travelled on. After loitering around the pedestrian mall having ice creams, a few drinks and a pizza lunch we checked into our wellness hotel and took advantage of the wellness jacuzzi spa. Dinner, a chateau briand, was at a little restaurant just down the road as our hotel’s restaurant needed an hour to prepare their meats.\n\nTo sum up it was a strange day overall, with only a short time on the bikes followed with us hanging around wondering what to do for the rest of the day. A great day all the same though, tailwinds, warmer and with no rain – can’t ask for more.\n\n23 may 2019, Day 32 – Mosonmagyarovar to Kamarno, Slavakia – 96km Total 2,525kms\n\nThe day started with the very happy surprise that the gardener had indeed washed our bikes and there they were gleaming at us, nothing like the mud-caked state that we had arrived with. We had planned a reasonably early start as even though we expected mainly tailwinds again today, we also knew we would finish riding into the wind for the last 20 or so kms. The early start didn’t happen (breakfast does that), but we got away a little after 8:30 and that was fine. We headed out of town along a cycle path following the main road with, as hoped for, the wind at our backs and were at our first stop in Gyor for coffees. Gyor has a very nice feel to the centre, with a pedestrian mall running through the old town and a great square, with cafes and shops along. We stopped at a great cafe-restaurant (would have loved to have lunch there – but way too early). Getting out of Gyor is a bit more complicated but having the EV6 app really made the difference this time – we both remember being horribly lost in the industrial outskirts of town, not very pleasant.\n\nShortly after leaving Gyor we left the cycle paths and were now on small roads passing through very small villages. Once we were well away from any town or village, Enid (Joanne’s bike) decided to throw a slipper – no traction at all and looked like the problem with the chain slipping had turned to disaster. It was a real panic moment as we thought that we would be looking for a train back to a bike shop to repair the Rolhoff hub but it turned out to be something much more minor – the chain had fallen off. Neither of us had realised that this was even a possibility with a fully sealed chain system – just shows how rough the road was.\n\nBack on track we headed on deciding to divert from the official route which included 3km of rough track and instead took Mike’s advise and went on to Babolna for lunch at a cafe who made us hot ham and cheese sandwiches (along with beers and wine to assist the afternoon effort) – all very nice and a great break after over 70kms. We met four cyclists who were visiting the nearby horse stud before coming into the cafe for hot sandwiches as well – in fact we came across more cyclists in the afternoon than we have for a while – who knows where they have come from (they weren’t cycling the rain yesterday, that’s for sure).\n\nAfter Babolna it was along a main-ish road to Acs and then along smaller roads including a fairly muddy section (nothing compared to yesterday though) and into Kamoron on the Hungarian side. Our first sight of the Danube for the whole day was the short crossing from Hungary into Slovakia for the night. It is hard to spot the difference between the cultures of the twin towns of Kamorom and Kamarno, but the Slovakian side is certainly very pretty in the centre – old buildings, cafes and wine bars and a nice feel – even on a chilly Thursday afternoon.\n\nA great day today – plenty to see, longish, friendly conditions overall and a good place to finish.`\n\n22 May 2019 Day 31 Vienna to Mosonmagyarovar, Hungary 110kms – Total 2,429kms\n\nToday is THE day that we have been waiting for – Tailwinds all day and strong at that! Yes we are excited after struggling into constant headwinds for weeks – it was about time we were rewarded. It did rain – constantly all day – and it was pretty cold – but hey, we had tailwinds!\n\nAfter a relaxing day off in Vienna we headed on, saying goodbye to Austria and hello to Hungary. It always takes some time to get out of big cities and this was the case today, but it was all very straight forward and all on cycle paths. You have to love cycling in Europe.\n\nOnce back on the Danube we took full advantage of those tailwinds and sped along, but all too soon came to yet another Umleitung (that’s a deviation in German for those just joining us), this time one to cause us much grief. We spent at least an hour going nowhere, getting out bikes and ourselves caked in mud and feeling completely lost. It looked like one of the ‘Hochwasser’ (high water or flooding) signs that pointed where we should go instead of into the flooded track had been moved – and so into the flooded track we went!\n\nFinally back on track we were on the scenic route of the Umleitung – a big detour that is a regular event in this section of the Danube – and no surprise with the amount of rain in the last few weeks. Not an unpleasant detour, but the extra distance of the detour and being lost made the day much longer than we had planned.\n\nOur first stop was at Orth – a lovely little bakery / bar that was warm and dry for cold and soaked cyclist. Then on to a late lunch at Hainburg (we should have been there two hours earlier) at a flash restaurant that was warm and coped with our muddy and sodden presence. The session after lunch was to be our longest yet – another 52kms – but with the wind and all on sealed roads with no geographical errors (riding on the smooth sealed surface that had a ‘no bicycles’ sign was not an error). The section was without incident – nice paths, with a long section beside the road into Mosonmagyarovar, but smooth travelling.\n\nOur hotel is the Hotel Lantau Garden, part of a thermal resort that we will not see after a long day. A good place though and making our first night in Hungary a good one.\n\n20 May 2019, Day 31 – Krems to Vienna 84km – Total 2319kms\n\nWe woke to see that it had rained in the night and decided on a later start, lingering over the very nice breakfast at Gasthof Klinglhuber with the large number of other guests here also cycling who obviously were in no hurry to go out in the rain either. Thankfully we didn’t wait too long as the rain, although light, persisted for a couple of hours.\n\nShortly after leaving town the track running alongside a canal, due to some earthworks by a guy in a big digger, became a quagmire of mud and we were lucky to stay upright. It soon improved and soon we were back on firmer ground riding through woodlands until we rejoined the Danube. We had the choice to cross the river here or continue on to Tuln along a dyke and crossing at the power station. We choose the dyke and moved along quite quickly as the wind hadn’t really picked up get. After crossing to the right bank we were back in woodlands passing by more power stations and what looked a steel manufacturing works. Despite the industry along this section the ride was still very pretty. Just before Tuln we hit another detour. The local riders are very law abiding and there is no consideration of not taking the detour so we followed suit even though it added a few kilometres to the day.\n\nWith the late start we decided on an early lunch in Tuln and after a bit of a search around found an Italian restaurant that was perfect as the rain came down again.\n\nBack on the bikes after lunch the wind had now picked up and it was our familiar grind into the headwinds. We took a short detour into Klosterneuburg to see the nearly 1000 year old abbey but unfortunately closed roads beat us so we had to make do with seeing it from the track.\n\nThe afternoon was almost entirely on cycle ways including almost all the way into Vienna to our Apartment Spittelberg, in a very hip area of Vienna and just around the corner from where we stayed on our last trip.\n\n19 May 2019, Day 30 – Grein to Krems, 84km Total 2,235kms\n\nWe left our lovely little hotel Gasthof Zur Traube after a fabulous breakfast, taking the small pedestrian and bike ferry back to the south side of the Danube as our breakfast waiter at the hotel, the same man who had recommended a lovely local wine at dinner last night, advised us. This was also the route that we took back in 2017 and it is just as beautiful now, hugging the river and passing by picture perfect villages on both sides of the river. Our side had the benefit of being entirely on bike ways with next to no other traffic. We watched another couple on the other side whose course was alongside the main road and felt very smug about our decision. We continued on smuggly to the bridge at Ybbs where we stopped at a local bakery for coffees and plunder (puff pastry for non german speakers) and bread rolls for our lunch.\n\nRoadworks leading out of Ybbs took us off course but we were able to find the way back to the track without too much trouble. The wind was now picking up and it was heads down and tails up pushing into it along the dyke with the Melk Abbey looming in the distance. We had explored the Abbey pretty extensively on our last visit so decided to by-pass Melk and continue straight on to Krems.\n\nMike Wells (famous cycle touring author who we like and has actually been very helpful on many occasions), suggested the north or left bank but we ignored his advice, just this once, and took the south/ right bank. What a good decision this was as it was mostly on green ways and through apricot orchards and vineyards and so pretty. We had another smug moment as we looked across at the cyclists riding beside the main road on the other side of the river and we felt pretty pleased with ourselves especially when we found a protected (if not secluded) spot for our lunch of prosciutto and cheese rolls and a bottle of rose right on the corner of the path overlooking the river.\n\nAfter lunch we continued on through the vineyards and orchards passing by small villages with restaurants and bars advertising schnapps made from the local apricots, to our planned ferry crossing at Rossatzbach. The crossing was in a tiny little boat that battled, zig-zagging against the current, but made it. The last short stage of the day appeared to be on roads, but not the main road that we had expected, and led us into Krems through the old cobbled streets of Stein an der Donau to the modern art museum where we stopped for beers and apperols before finding our hotel, Gasthof Klinglhuber – a lovely place at the entrance to the old town of Krems. Dinner was in the old town, but not too far away, giving us the chance to look around this very pretty and historic town. A great day, despite the headwinds!\n\ner\n\n18 May 2019, Day 29 – Linz to Grein, 60km Total 2,151kms\n\nToday is short day, another mini rest day and so accordingly we planned a later start for Murray to get some school work done while Joanne had a look around the old city en-route to buying some much needed chain lube for Murray’s grinding and increasingly loud gears. Linz is actually a lovely and picturesque city and staying in the old city this time made all the difference and we have come away with much fonder impressions than last time we were here.\n\nWith just a short ride across the bridge we were back on our way through parkland and past the University with Linz’s heavy industry now prominent across the river. On this trip we stuck to the northern side of the river passing through Mauthausen, the site of a notorious concentration camp during WW2. There is a memorial here but we didn’t manage to see it.\n\nSticking to the northern bank we continued on past the hotel restaurants of Mauthausen and the fine boat harbour to find an outdoor table with benches in a protected corner right on the river for our picnic lunch (two in a row – now we’re getting into the rhythm of it). After lunch the route meandered through farmland before re-joining the now very wide Danube with it’s passing cruise boats all the way to Grein.\n\nArriving in Grein we stopped at a snackery with a terrace overlooking the river where we ran into the same large group cycle tour tour that we had seen yesterday as we approached Linz and then again on the route today – it’s nice to run into familiar people along the way. Our accommodation tonight is the very popular Gasthof Zur Traube.\n\nJust to keep the theme of the ride going, we faced headwinds, sometimes strong, all the way again today, but a lovely warm and sunny day and easy riding made for a very pleasant day.\n\n17 May 2019 ` `. , Day 28, Passau to Linz – 92km, Total 2091kms\n\nWe woke this morning to see blue sky outside and the weather forecast is for a maximum of 20! How to put a smile on a cyclist’s face, especially cyclists who have been riding in the cold and the rain for the last 3 weeks. Raincoats were quickly put to the bottom of the bag and after a lovely home cooked breakfast of scrambled eggs with smoked salmon we said our goodbyes to the lovely people at Hornsteiner pension but not before a few more quick photos of the very pretty medieval town with its imposing church of St Steven and the confluence of the Danube, the Inns and the Ibb rivers.\n\nThe cycle path initially runs alongside the main road hugging the bank and was very quick going. Soon we were onto much smaller roads and we started to see an increase in the number of other cyclists, some out for a day ride, others training and pushing the pace and other tourers like us (so many on electric bikes!). The ferry crossing at Schlogen put us on the south or right bank and on sealed, flat and quiet roads through forest right on the very edge of the river. We continued along this bank all the way to Achach an der Donau bridge, 66kms in, where we’d planned our lunch stop. We found a fantastic spot protected from the wind about 2km further along with benches overlooking a small boat harbour to enjoy our first picnic since the rain and cold set in.\n\nWith 26km to go to Linz and plenty of time we just tootled along encountering more groups of cyclists of all sorts of abilities and had to keep out of the way of the racers roaring along, crossing at the hydro station and the small town of Ottensheim – where most cyclists were taking the ferry across the river (did they know something that we didn’t?)\n\nCycling into large cities can be messy, busy and not very attractive and this was the case today.\n\nAfter Ottensheim we turned onto a cycleway beside what was now a very busy road until the last 4km where a new route took us between the rail line and the river, a much more pleasant ride, and ending the day by crossing the bridge at Urfahr into the old city of Linz and to our hotel Goettfried, with its promised very good restaurant that turned out to be fantastic.\n\nA great day, along what is the start of the most popular section of the most ridden cycle way in the world, on smooth and flat roads and cycle paths, in lovely sunshine all day, even if still into headwinds for the whole 92kms, pretty strong some of the time, but then again we’ve given up on tailwinds.\n\n16 May 2019, Day 27 Deggendorf to Passau – 60km, 1,999km\n\nAfter a rest day in Passau today’s ride retraced our steps (in warmer conditions) with a train trip back to Deggendorf where we left the trail two days ago to complete the stage back into Passau. We headed off without panniers and so became “Day Tootlers” for the day. The train trip was again straight forward, even getting the same grumpy train conductor on the Platting to Deggerforf section and her mood hadn’t improved!\n\nThe way marking was initially very good and we were soon out of the rather busy town of Deggendorf and back onto our friendly dykes. The main route runs along the north bank and this is the route that we had ridden before but we found that this section had been diverted to the south bank near the village of Seebach. So it was onto a pedestrian and bike ferry to the south bank where we meandered along very pleasant quiet small roads following the loops of the Danube to Vilshofen. This section was not well marked and we were relying on google maps as we negotiated the very small roads and tracks, some of which just ended, before finally coming to some major road works 6km out and rejoining the marked way into Vilshofen. The diversion seemed a bit longer than the 23km sign posted at the start (after a good while riding the next sign said 22kms) but it was mostly a very quiet and pretty ride.\n\nIn Vilshofen we found the same little cafe we had lunched at in 2017 but in the colder weather had us sitting in the warm indoors enjoying big bowls of pasta.\n\nThe final 23 km to Passau was back onto the main north bank route and all very straight forward again hugging the banks with just one short stop for beer and cafe, as all good tootler’s do, at the Danube Pirate cafe.\n\nWe have had a lovely stay in Passau, staying for three nights in our very comfortable and spacious apartment in Hornsteiner pension, enjoying some delicious meals at the Monastry Italian restaurant and enjoying the luxury of sight seeing in Passau.\n\n14 May 2019, Day 26 Regensburg to Deggendorf 93kms – Total 1,939kms\n\nThere was a lot of indecision about the plan for today. Our plan to stay in Deggendorf was being thwarted by there being no accommodation (I mean really none) there. The stop before at Straubing would have been fine, but made for a 96km day on Wednesday, with a weather forecast of rain all day, headwinds and a top temperature of 8 degrees. It was looking very messy until the cunning plan was hatched to cycle to Deggendorf, catch the train to Passau, have a rest day tomorrow and return by train to Deggendorf on Thursday to ride back to Passau in a little bit warmer conditions. Brilliance we are thinking, but that’s just us.\n\nToday was still going to be a big day though and we left a little late after all the pfaffing about making decisions and cooking (making really) our own breakfast in our apartment with the supermarket and bakery next door. The distance, the cold (we cycled the whole day in jumpers and raincoats) and the headwinds made it a less than pleasant prospect, but those low expectations probably made it feel better than it might have otherwise. The winds were strong and cold, but the going was largely flat and mostly on either good cycle ways or small roads and the kms clicked by accordingly.\n\nThe day followed the Danube more closely than it has for the last couple and we saw more of the river than we have for a while. After leaving Regensburg we were back in farming country – with all the lush green that still seems so striking to us – and a series of small villages with no facilities, but a lovely peaceful aura about them. We passed the imposing ‘Valhalla’ on the hill at about 15kms out, a 19th century monument copy of the Parthenon built as a tribute to the heroes of the Germanic speaking people, and duly nodded our appreciation as we headed on.\n\nOur first stop came at about 56kms as we found a warm, friendly bakery at Horndorf just past Straubing to settle into for an early lunch of baguette and coffees. Then on for just another 10kms or so to Bogen (enough to make us feel homesick) and another stop at the train stations cafe because that was the last possible stop out of the cold before Deggendorf. Refreshed we headed on, with the river winding around so that we were sometimes directly into the wind and sometimes had it at our backs – what a difference that makes!\n\nAt Deggendorf we headed straight to the station and the next challenge of negotiating the train to Passau using the ticket machines – made it and the hour or so trip with just one change was fine. Our apartment in Passau is particularly fine – heaps of room, in the centre of the historic town and nearby to old haunts from 2017. We are looking forward to our rest day tomorrow, even if in the cold, and the chance to go back and cycle the Deggendorf to Passau section, but in hopefully warmer conditions on Thursday and stay here for the night again.\n\n13 May 2019, Day 25 Ingolstadt to Regensburg – 83km – Total 1,846kms\n\nToday was our earliest start of the the trip as we were intimidated by the weather forecast of strong headwinds all day. Although 7:50am is not a particularly early start the chilly mornings with temperatures of between -2 and 0 have not encouraged us to get going too early.\n\nIngolstadt is a another of those very pretty German towns and we used the short day as a semi -rest day. It turned out to be a great decision not to go on to Weltenburg monastery yesterday as there was a good chance that we would have missed the last boat to Kelheim.\n\nWe left Ingolstadt continuing on back alongside the Danube but in no time we turned away from the river passing the first of the many oil refineries and power plants along the way. Soon we were riding through fields of wheat and canola to the small village of Vohburg where poor Agnes was drowned as a witch for an unwise marriage!\n\nThe route was mostly back on dykes alongside the Danube before our first short stop at the very nice Bad Gogging bakery for coffees and pretzels. After the one climb of the day over a ridge where the gorge becomes very narrow, we reached our second stop just over 10km later at the impressive Weltemburg Monastery where we sampled the beers from the oldest mostastic brewery in the world still operating since 1050 – not a bad drop.\n\nWe made the 12 noon boat and relived a very pleasant a trip through the gorges all with running commentary (in German) to Kelheim.\n\nAfter a lovely lunch at a Italian restaurant just off the carpark at the boat ramp we passed through the gates of Kelheim and spent the last 38km of the day on totally flat cycleways meandering alongside the river all the way to Regensburg and to our huge apartment accommodation at Arnulfsplatz. The final section was on pleasant paths and small roads, passing the giant stone statues of lions protection something on the cliff-face.\n\nAll in all a good day with some strong headwinds in the morning more than made up for by the delightful riverside cycling of the afternoon. Regensburg is a beautiful medieval city and a great place to finish a day.\n\n12 May 2019 Day 24 Donauworth to Ingolstadt – 60km – Total 1,763km\n\nOur hotel Park was posted on Booking.com as being 600m from the zentro, this could only have been vertically, however we had a lovely room and the hotel has a lovely bar and restaurant that we enjoyed, so there was really no need to go back down the very steep hill into town.\n\nToday was predicted to be cold and with fierce headwinds and it was true to the prediction. After phone calls to Liz and Lise (we couldn’t get onto Harr but we did message) and a lovely breakfast which included a glass of Prosecco because it is Mutterstag we reluctantly headed off. The first stage of 37kms was along cycle paths running alongside a main road before we quickly turned away from the Danube into rolling hills, some quiet steep, around farmland fields. We were really very cold and were not taking in the beauty of the scenery and being so cold made the going tough.\n\nThe next stage was through forests along gravel roads and included a very steep climb between Reidsteim and Neuberg which had us well and truely out of the saddle and nearly off the bikes (looking for a gear lower than 1 but not having success). This wasn’t entirely a surprise as we had read about it from our previous blog of the Danube. A big bakery at the historic cathedral and castle town of Neuberg was our first stop where we were able to warm up before tackling the next 23km to Ingolstadt travelling along small local roads and dykes, really very pleasant going, but cold and into the wind for too much of it.\n\nWe pulled into Ingolstadt not really having `a firm idea of whether we would go on the remaining planned 45km or not. Our lunch spot was the lovely Hotel Gasthof Zum Anker that although very close to full found us a table to enjoy a delicious Mother’s day lunch with the locals. The question of what we would like to drink before lunch in this lovely warm place sealed the deal and we decided that we wouldn’t go on – the risk of riding for another three hours only to find that the last ferry to Kelhiem had left was too great, so we found a hotel, had hot showers and after a short walk around the very nice and historic town of Ingolstadt, enjoyed drinks at a bar and headed for a more low key dinner at a pizzeria nearby. A potentially big and challenging day (weather related) turned into a bit of a Mutterstag treat – very nice!\n\n11 May 2019 Day 23 – Ulm to Donauworth 90km – Total 1,703kms\n\nLast night we planned on looking around the ancient (though largely re-built after the bombing of WWII) small city of Ulm. It is a beautiful place and what we could see from our lovely room said all of that – centuries old structures, a river running through the buildings and stone paths all around. We failed in the walk around as the weather and lateness got the better of us, but we did make it to the oldest restaurant in Ulm, The Krone, apparently first mentioned in 1330 and host to numerous kings, queens and other royalty and the like over the centuries – a lovely place that still featured the un-plastered wall that all those people had sat against, but now friendly and low-key with great food and atmosphere.\n\nWe woke to the sound of running water from the Gross Blau just below us – our bed for the night was a boat which added to the atmosphere of what was a great night. We headed back just around the corner to the Hotel Schmales for an early and generous breakfast before a quick sight seeing walk up to the Ulm Rathaus and maketplaz and then it was back on the track alongside the Danube.\n\nIt was a much milder day than we have had for a while although the jackets were still on even though there was no rain in sight. We have finally worked out how to use our EV6 Danube App – we had been expecting too much, but it worked well keeping us on track and this year there was no getting lost in the forest that had plagued us in 2017.\n\nThe wind was solidly behind us as we cycled through a combination of farmland, forests, small villages, along dykes and through the fenn country before our first stop at 54km at Dinningan. We both remember this small town and had coffee and beer there. We had considered making this our lunch stop fearing that there might not be much more along the way but it was a bit early and our cafe didn’t seem to serve food – so it was onward.\n\nThe small town of Hochstadt another 13km along which at first glance didn’t seem to have anything to offer in the way of lunch came up trumps with the restaurant at a small gasthaus being open and providing us with a lovely lunch.\n\nThe afternoon session was another 28km to Donauworth with the wind still pushing us and our full bellies of beer, wine and schitzel and spatzle (German noodles) along to the end. It was an uneventful finish, though the weather turned a little for the worse with drizzling rain for some of the way. Our hotel tonight, the Parkhotel, is perched way too high above the town – great for views, but not so great for those pushing bikes up very steep tracks to it. Good to be here though and to reflect on a great day of cruising the Danube countryside. Tomorrow looks longer, with headwinds and rolling hills, so tonight we enjoy today.\n\n10 May 2019 Day 22 Sigmaringen to Ulm 88km – Total 1,613kms\n\nAfter a lovely breakfast in our little Gasthof Alta Fitz that turned out to be just ideal, warm and cosy and with a nice little restaurant but most importantly with a room available, we headed down for photos of the amazing and huge church overshadowing the town. Then it was an easy find back to the route in clear and mild conditions for what we hoped was going to be a warmer and kinder day to us. Things were going well, a few “ups and downs” through woodlands but nothing spectacular that then led us through farmland along what turned into great little flat and sealed roads. The sky was dark and we could see rain not too far away before it descended not long before our first scheduled stop at Reidlingen when it really poured down. We tried to outrun the rain but didn’t stand a chance and arrived at the first bar that we came to in town cold and wet.\n\nOur plan was to make Ulm tonight and to do this it would be a 104km day however with the suddenly bleak conditions and an hour lost waiting out the pouring rain this didn’t seem possible. After a good warm up and a couple of coffees we adjusted our route which cut 17km from the total days ride by heading away from the Danau Radweg and onto other bike paths and small roads, we headed off again into the weak sunshine. The new route had more hills of course and more navigation challenge, but it was a good decision, because we hadn’t seen the last of the rain as it came down again several times as we wove our way through some very pretty agricultural landscapes and through very small villages.\n\nOur proposed lunch spot of Griesingen was a disappointment as like the previous villages there was not even a bar to be found! We cycled on just a few kilometres and came to a bakery where we managed to get a speck and kase (that’s ham and cheese for those not speaking like natives here) breadroll and a coffee and that was lunch today.\n\nUlm was just 25km further on and it was for the moment clear but we could see black clouds and more rain coming but the route was all along cycle paths and flat so pretty easy going. A quick stop at Lidl before the last 11 or so kms into Ulm, albeit all through industrial areas, soon had us at our lovely accommodation, the Apartment Ulmer Schachtel annexed to Hotel Schmales Haus over the fast running waters of Gross Blau that runs into the Danube in Ulm. A longish good day that could have done with some sun – in fact we could do with some sun!\n\n9 May 2019, Day 21 Donaueschingen to Sigmaringen 94km Total 1,525kms\n\nToday was promised to be a better day with warmer temperatures and less chance of rain, however we set out in a light drizzle back along the same path that we entered Dongaueschingen yesterday. After another quick trek up to the quell we followed the path back to Geisingen and it was just as lovely today riding through wild flower meadows as it was yesterday. We once again took the opportunity to warm up with cafes and today a pretzel at the local bakery before continuing on in what was now steady rain through farmland and hugging to the juvenile Danube. The confusing weather applied to the winds too – we had raging headwinds, fabulous tailwinds and periods of calm – all unpredictable and only explained by the winding river and the narrow gorges.\n\nMemories were starting to come back, in bits and pieces, as we came through country we had travelled in 2017. We were definitely not on the same track through to Tuttlingen though, as the memories are of forest and today was farmland, but we did get back on track. Tuttlingen was our second stop for the day – but not as successful as we couldn’t find a place to leave the bikes and so we had coffee outside in the blizzard (ok, maybe carrying on here) and didn’t stay long. After Tuttlingen it was into the gorge country (definitely gorgeous scenery, but not gorgeous weather). We were still without a plan on the day overall, so we carried on with the hope of coming to somewhere nice for lunch. That happened as we made it to Fridlingen and found a pizza and past place that was just brilliant.\n\nStill with 40kms to go after lunch to the first place with anything we could see offering accommodation, we pushed on – through beautiful gorges, lovely gravel tracks, some small roads and some short and steep ups and down right through the afternoon. The rain continued for most of it, but it was beautiful all the same. We made it to Sigmaringen at around 5:00 – and were helped in finding accommodation by an already full hotel in this surprisingly sold-out town. We were directed to the Gasthaus Alter Fitz – simple and friendly (in a completely non English speaking way) and had a great dinner there.\n\n`\n\n8 May 2019 Day 20 Schaffhausen to Donaueschingen (Donauquelle) 50kms – Total – 1,431kms\n\nToday we left Switzerland for the last time, and the lovely Rhine Valley, to climb the hill (might have felt like a mountain, but it wasn’t really) to find the Danube Valley and what they claim is the ‘source’ of the river (they say it is Donauquelle at Donaueschingen, but really it is about 30kms up the hill at Martinskarpelle). Anyway, it was a goodbye to our second country and second river system and welcome to Germany and the mighty Danube.\n\nThis famous day was not so shining in the weather department though. Cold and rainy right through a day or short kilometres with long hills. The exit from Schaffhausen was a debacle at first – couldn’t decide which of multiple routes to take, then couldn’t find the start of them, then we were in traffic in the rain and heading uphill. The choices were the short and sharp or the longer and friendlier. Whatever the choice, the hill is the hill in the end, but we decided on the longer friendlier version, hence the 50kms instead of a potential 36. The climb was good to us at first though, with steady gradient, no real downhills to rob the climber and a mixture of cycle path on the side of the road and dedicated cycle path by the forest.\n\nAt around the 15km mark we hit the real hills and they lasted for around 10kms we think (with some rolling up and down in between) – a couple of sections steep enough to have us off our bikes and there was discussion of the prospect of dying in the forest. The big hills came in two sections, the first a few kilometres from the little village of Tengen and the second starting in that village and continuing up for a good way. After the half way point it was much easier and more pleasant going – country roads and a network of cycle paths through a village that offered coffee and croissant to the freezing – all the way to Donaueschingen where we found a strange lunch and then the pretend source of the Danube and our nice little hotel for the night – Hotel Linde. Good to be out of the cold and planning the route down the Danube starting tomorrow!\n\n7 May 2019 Day 19 Bad Zurzach to Schaffhausen 50km (40 planned – 50 ridden) – 1,381kms\n\nToday began with good intentions and dodgy decisions. We made the firm plan last night to take the most direct route to Donaueschingen today – just 57kms, though a significant climb. The night was not kind to Jodie’s tummy, with the pestilence of the past returning and not a good night. We were pushing on though, with an earliesh start after visiting the chemist, but about 10kms out it was clear that the ‘direct’ route was on narrow and hugely steep roads that looked like stranding us somewhere during the day. So the decision was taken to ‘ride another day’ and we headed to Schaffausen instead. What a good decision that was – energy levels were not what they should have been, the route was hilly but not incredibly so like the alternative, and we passed by the Rheinfall that is stunning. We had seen the Rheinfall in 2016, but from the other side and it was great to see the other perspective, with all the visitors, boats and crashing waters from the front.\n\nThe day was a wild mix of lovely tracks on the river, suburban roads, cycleways along next to main roads and up and down. It was a short day, but after an intense first 10kms fighting the steepness of our first options, it was full enough and the arrival in Schaffhausen, via the great river route, was welcome. We had not made any plans on accommodation as we didn’t know how we would feel and the whole day was pretty unplanned, but it was pretty clear as we made it to a warm restaurant for lunch that we were not heading on. Great schnitzel again made it clearer still and we headed on foot through the incredible historic town to find a hotel recommended by the Tourist Office. Feeling good about the day and the option to head up the bit hill tomorrow – poor weather or not!\n\n6 May 2019 Day 18 Basel to Bad Zurzach 75km – Total 1,331kms\n\nIt was back on the road after a two day break in Basel. Basel is a city with the historic section beautifully preserved. We had planned on a one day break but the combination of Joanne getting a vicious bout of food poisoning and the unseasonably cold, wet and snowy (the snow even made the Swiss newspapers it was so unusual) conditions convinced us that a second day here was in order. The lovely ‘Mr Pickwick’ pub was the winner – draws the crowds from Switzerland as much as the rest of the world – but the food and atmosphere were great and it was good to keep going back.\n\nLeaving our very good hotel, The Passage, this morning was in milder conditions but the temperature soon dropped as we eventually, in geographic embarrassment, found our way out of town along the banks of the Rhine. We chose to take the north bank or the German side after reading in a blog that this route was flatter and on less busy roads. After a very pleasant exit from Basel we found ourselves in an industrial area but we could see that here both sides of the river were more or less the same. The EV6 route was marked well on the German side and pretty soon we were travelling through farmland on our way the Rhinefeld, a beautiful town back on the Swiss side of the Rhine where we passed what must have been hundreds of trucks parked and blocking two lanes of the main highway. We had no idea why they were there, possibly a strike or a demonstration but we are still no wiser. We continued on along the German side hugging the banks of the Rhine through lovely forested areas, farmland and a bird nature reserve before coming to the town of Bad Sackingen where we found a great little restaurant in the square with an imposing cathedral for our lunch – traditional schnitzel and frites – just right in the cold!\n\nThe afternoon session continued along quiet cycleways passing through stunning German medieval towns and canola fields. The afternoon route also included the obligatory sewage treatment plant and a nuclear power station. Soon we came to our final bridge crossing back into Switzerland to Kolbenz, a rather busy border crossing, and then the last 8km all along cycle paths into Bad Zurzach (can’t right the pronunciation, but it isn’t anything like it looks to us – a local asked us where we were going today and said he didn’t know that town until we spelled it).\n\nOverall it was a great day, cold but with no rain to speak of, mostly on quiet cycle paths with beautiful scenery and through beautiful towns\n\n3 May 2-19 Day 17 Montbelliard to Basel 95km – Trip total – 1,256kms\n\nToday was forecast to be cold and it definitely was. Again wearing all the warm clothes that we have we were off on another big day where we leave France riding into Basel just over the border. The first stages have certainly been the Route of Rivers and today was no different with us firstly tracking along the river L’Allan and then back onto the Canal Rhone au Rhin and then riding into Basel along the very pleasant Huningue Canal.\n\nSoon after we started riding it started to drizzle building to solid rain and remained wet and extremely cold all morning. With fingers and toes\n\n3 May 2-19 Day 17 Montbelliard to Basel 95km – Total 1,256\n\nToday was forecast to be cold and it definitely was. Again wearing all the warm clothes that we have we were off on another big day where we leave France riding into Basel just over the border. The first stages have certainly been the Route of Rivers and today was no different with us firstly tracking along the river L’Allan and then back onto the Canal Rhone au Rhin and then riding into Basel along the very pleasant Huningue Canal.\n\nSoon after we started riding it started to drizzle building to solid rain and remained wet and extremely cold all morning. With fingers and toes numb and shivering and needing to get out of the cold we took refuge at a little port snackerie about 25km along – not the best stop as it was more of a pagola with sides open to the wind and rain (would have been lovely on a warm sunny day) where we were able to get coffees but had to make do with tarte au pomme and tarte myrtille as nothing hot was available.\n\nSlightly more warmed up we pushed on to Mulhouse where we found a restaurant that although technically not open yet did serve us coffees and let us warm up again before pushing on the next 20km, now against the wind, into Kembs for lunch. At Kembs we found the delightful City Grill. Looking at it from the outside you wouldn’t guess how lovely it is inside.\n\nAny thoughts of lingering over a long lunch, as we only had 20km to finish the day, were dispensed as the restaurant went from almost full to just us in short time and the hosts were busy cleaning tables and packing away. The last 20km was lovely along the unsealed towpath beside the Huningue canal.\n\nGetting into Basel was much more straight forward than I remember from when we did cycled Rhine but then we approached from the other side. Having the phones with maps mounted on the bikes now makes such a difference. We arrived at the modern Urban Passage and Lifestyle hotel where the lovely gentleman on reception upgraded us to a junior suite.\n\n2 May, 2019 Day 16 Besancon to Montbelliard 95kms – Trip total – 1,161kms\n\nToday is THE day that we have been looking forward to – a forecast of tail winds has us both very excited after 15 days straight of pushing into headwinds.\n\nAfter an early and very nice breakfast at the hotel we were off into a much warmer than expected day, the jackets came off pretty quickly as we headed out along the canal once more. The morning was all alongside the canal with stunning scenery and great riding to Baume les Damnes where as the temperatures were dropping we found a lovely little biscuiterie to enjoy cafe and Madelines.\n\nStill cold it was back on the track still along the canal with just one lpinch uphill away from the water (what do you mean that the towpath stops?) for 33km into lunch at L’isle sur le Doubs. A bit of a sad lunch after almost 70kms at a little bakery that had just about finished up the day (and pas de vin!) – but it was warm and dry and good all the same. This is where we got the tailwind and we fair dinkum whizzed along.\n\nWith just 26km into Montbelier we headed out into what had now become very cold, continuing along the canal with a second short deviation up a hill for a couple of kms and then back along the canal to our accommodation for the night, the Brit Hotel, right in the heart of the old town.\n\n1 May, 2019 Day 15 Dole to Besancon 63kms – Trip total – 1,066kms\n\nToda"
