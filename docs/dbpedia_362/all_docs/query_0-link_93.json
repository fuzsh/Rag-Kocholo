        "text": "Lot 2 of the South Beltway Motorway – Bucharest, will run between km. 69 + 000 and km. 85 + 300 and will cross the following territorial administrative units, located in Ilfov County: Vidra, Jilava, 1 Decembrie, Darasti Ilfov, Magurele, Bragadiru.\n\nBucharest Ring Road, 0 + 000 km – 100 + 900, is part of the Pan-European Corridor IV, more specifically this being the connection between the Bucharest-Piteşti motorway and the Bucharest-Constanta A2 motorway but also along the IX Pan European corridor. It is imperative to make an appropriate connection between the Pan European IV Corridor and the Pan European IX Corridor.\n\nConsidering the accelerated development of the Bucharest urban zone, the Bucharest Ring Road will represent the infrastructure needed for the heavy urban traffic load and will ensure adequate access to the TEN-T network of the local roads and the road infrastructure of the Municipality of Bucharest.\n\nBucharest Ring Road Lot 2, will run between km. 69 + 000 and km. 85 + 300. The route of the highway starts near CF 902 Bucharest – Giurgiu line, the route follows the localities of Sintesti and Jilava, where intersects DJ 401A (km 72 + 100), crosses the Sabar river (km 73 + 500) and intersects DN5 (km 74+ 900) where will be a road junction.\n\nAfter the intersection with DN5, the highway route is NE oriented, bypassing the Jilava forest, crossing CF Port 1 Decembrie and passing north from Darasti, where intersects DJ101 (km 78 + 350). Further, the highway route runs almost parallel to the Sabar river (about 2km) and passes south of the towns of Magurele and Bragadiru and intersects DN6 (84 + 650) where will be a road junction.\n\nOne short term parking area at Km 78+000 and Maintenance & Operation Building at DN5 intersection will be constructed. 15 bridges and overpasses will be constructed in 16,30 km project length"
