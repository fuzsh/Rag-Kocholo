        "text": "Its not hard to understand. Thermal Expansion and contraction makes hand tight on brakes loosen up.\n\nWhen they loosen up you start throwing shots. Thats why many people will only run a brake they can torque down to keep this from happening. Many competitors have checking their muzzle break before a stage as part of their checklist for this reason. I saw it happen to shooters at each of the last 3 matches I shot.\n\nYou many not have a concern for it, but that's out of ignorance/lack of experience. Its a very real thing.\n\nInteresting and aggressive take.\n\nHaving at least a little experience with the mounting system, and having spend quite a lot of time with them at matches, I can tell you that everything mounted on the end of a barrel, regardless of the system, has the ability to loosen. I've seen it with brakes from all makers, including ours. Not a common thing from anyone, but I've also seen scopes loose, action screws, and even a barrel one time. Take accountability for your gear, it's part of the game.\n\nThe major difference that we pride ourselves one - if the brake collar comes loose, or you need to even totally remove the brake for some reason, you can replace it without POI shift. Since we are not using a jam nut for tension, but a taper, the position of the brake bore relative to the rifle bore is MUCH more consistent. Just the nature of the mechanism.\n\nThat said, maybe you don't like it or don't have faith in it. If that's the case, there are a TON of other great options from quality US manufacturers. Buy the item you believe in or want to support, and I'm sure it will also do a very fine job. The beauty of the precision rifle community at this point in time is that regardless of the part you're looking for, there are least a few options that are all great choices.\n\nInteresting and aggressive take.\n\nHaving at least a little experience with the mounting system, and having spend quite a lot of time with them at matches, I can tell you that everything mounted on the end of a barrel, regardless of the system, has the ability to loosen.

I have had a sidewinder and helfire match come loose on me during matches. I have seen it happen another half dozen or so times to other guys. You are right anything can come loose and we build processes to mitigate this, such as hand checking the brake before each stage to make sure it didn't come loose. However there are a ton of shooters who are newer or just dont care/know to check.\n\nThe other issue with your brakes is the port angle and how obnoxious they are. They are popular so enough people are running them at matches to ruin just about any squads shooting experience, especially when we have to prone out in a line or under cover. They do not really provide any more recoil reduction/muzzle flip reduction than brakes that do not throw as much concussion back to shooter and to the sides.\n\nI tried to like them but they are just painful to shoot and painful to be around. They seem to throw more shit back than even the TMB and APA Fat Bastard G3 which are notorious for their concussion.\n\nOn the flip side the mav can is awesome and really pleasant to shoot and be around. You guys hit a home run with that can.\n\nIt would be nice if you guys could redesign the brake to be less obnoxious to the shooter and whats next to them/behind them. If it was up to me, the 419 brakes would be banned from competition for this reason alone. ACE and ATS are able to make awesome brakes that tame recoil and return to stability fast while not being painful to be next to.\n\nI hear what you are saying Craig, but there is a big difference between hand tight and wrench tight.

While hand tight and wrench tight are not the same, all threads are not the same, and the functions of tightening/holding needs of different mechanisms are not the same.\n\nWe make a series of Hellfire brakes, with 2P, 3P, and Match, that perform in different ways for different preferences. We also have the Sidewinder, which is more aggressive than any of the Hellfire products. But, again, if one isn't right for you, lots of great options out there.\n\nCalling for a ban of a brake because of your preference seems a little bit off the reservation, but if that's how you feel, that's why the forums are here.\n\nHave a great weekend, and shoot straight!\n\nAlways happy to take feedback, Anonymous.

Helps tame down recoil and there are not many options for .35 and .45 bores.\n\nWe have had some discussions on here recently related to muzzle brakes and how latest research is showing they contribute to TBI/concussive injuries and can make them worse. Here is a recent thread where we talk about it. https://www.snipershide.com/shootin...-poor-form-at-the-range.7208128/post-11433667\n\nBottom line, Its an issue and will probably become a point of contention in the future in PRS. Getting ahead of it would not be a bad idea. Guys would not be designing brakes to deal with these issues if they didn't exist. How many guys end the day with a headache? If you can make a brake that performs similar without injuring/hurting people, then why wouldn't you? Watching guys curl up in a ball and hide from people shooting (like we saw this last weekend at frontline) obnoxious brakes just reinforces this. Its unnecessary.\n\nUnfortunately, brakes that perform better at reducing recoil will be more uncomfortable at the shooter.\n\nAs far as other claims, you can't get around that. If you have something behind the ports that deflects gas, that in turn will counteract the recoil reduction of the brake. You need gas pushing the rifle forward, which means gas coming back towards shooter. Deflecting the gas after that just pushes the rifle to the rear again. So, if his collar deflected the glass, it would in turn reduce the recoil reduction performance.\n\nI hear you.\n\nI was just surprised given the hype around this specific brake. Specifically, from what I heard in a podcast or two from shooters (that *wink* may be sponsored by TMB). They made it sound like the TMB could cure cancer I guess it doesn't after all.\n\nAnyways, as interesting as all of this information is, I kind of find it much like Pew Science's suppressor ratings. At the end of the day does a recoil reduction of 11% really matter? Does a dB reduction of 3 matter? Some of it becomes a bit to academic, with the numbers washing out in the real world.\n\nI hear you.\n\nI was just surprised given the hype around this specific brake.

A lot of it is perception as well as points per match performance for people.\n\nTake a look at the \"feeling\" category. A lot of the green and yellow brakes, people will swear they cut recoil down much better than other brakes. When in reality, they are just shooting better and/or staying on the gun better with a more comfortable brake. Which is great for them. Just not the reasons they think.\n\nFor many people, getting something like an ATS brake that is more comfortable for the shooter, and still relatively high in recoil reduction, will net better match scores than going with a Botnia Max that reduces more recoil, but gives them a headache halfway through the match."
