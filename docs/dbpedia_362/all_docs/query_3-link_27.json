        "text": "Surrey County Intermediate League (Western)\n\nPremier Division\n\nSaturday 8th October 2022\n\nKick Off 14.00 Actual 14.05\n\nMerrow 1 Worplesdon Phoenix 1, attendance 35\n\n42’ 0-1\n\n90’ + 5, 1-1\n\n@ Albury Sports Club\n\nSandy Lane\n\nAlbury Heath\n\nGU5 9DB\n\nNo Admission or Programme.\n\nI last saw a Merrow home game back on 29th August 2005, played at The Urnfield, when they lost 1-5 to A.F.C. Wallingford in a Combined Counties League Division 1 match, during a five year spell playing at Step 6 and where the crowd was just 13. They have since moved to Albury Sports Club and are now playing two levels lower again, at Step 8, having spent life at Step 7 (Surrey Elite Intermediate League) from 2013-2021.\n\nThey came into this game bottom of the league table (previous incumbents Wrecclesham pulled out of the league yesterday), having lost their opening four games, whilst the visitors were sitting fifth, having won 2 and lost 2 of their four matches. It was a scrappy game, with very few clear cut chances. The visitors went ahead just before halftime, when a long throw was flicked on at the near post and possibly put across the line by a defender trying to clear, although it was hard to tell who got the final touch. The equaliser came five minutes into stoppage time at the end of the game, when the ball was played back in from the right and finished from close range.\n\nPerhaps a sign of how Merrow have struggled this season, was the fact that one of their Centre Backs played in an old Tottenham Hotspur away shirt, minus a number, as there wasn’t a proper shirt to fit him, although to be fair, he didn’t perform as bad as he looked!\n\nApart from the football, there are a couple of interesting features within yards of the pitch. A WW2 plaque and a totem pole!\n\nWest Sussex League\n\nDivision 3 South\n\nSaturday 1st October 2022\n\nKick Off 15.00 On Time !\n\nAmbassadors 2 A.F.C. Fernhurst 3, attendance 10\n\n6’ 1-0\n\n14’ 2-0\n\n78’ 2-1\n\n82’ 2-2\n\n86’ 2-3\n\n@ Boxgrove Village Hall & Community Centre\n\nThe Street\n\nBoxgrove\n\nPO18 0EE\n\nNo Admission or Programme.\n\nThe attraction of this game, apart from the fact that it was 2nd versus 3rd in the league table, was that it was played at Boxgrove, rather than Sherborne Road, in Chichester, which is the normal home venue for Ambassadors, although I gather a move here may become more permanent at some stage during the season.\n\nAmbassadors started brightly, opening the scoring when sweeping in a diagonal free kick at the far post after six minutes, before doubling their lead eight minutes later, when following a poor goal kick, the ball was shot against a post, before being put into his own net by a visiting defender as he tried to clear the danger.\n\nThe game looked to be heading for a comfortable home win, but the game was turned on it’s head when the visitors pulled a goal back with twelve minutes left, before a long ball was finished off with the striker cutting inside and shooting into the far corner, to level it up at 2-2, just four minutes later. Fernhurst were certainly not settling for a point and inside the last five minutes a long clearance ended with the ball being lobbed over the home ’keeper and it bounced up and went in off the underside of the crossbar, to give the visitors all three points.\n\nCambridgeshire County League\n\nDivision 4A\n\nTuesday 20th September 2022\n\nKick Off 19.45 On Time !\n\nF.C. Kennett 4 Sawston United Reserves 2, attendance 36\n\n24’ 1-0\n\n51’ 2-0\n\n61’ 3-0\n\n66’ 4-0\n\n70’ 4-1\n\n84’ 4-2\n\n@ Kentford & Kennett Village Hall & MacLaren Playing Fields\n\nStation Road\n\nKennett\n\nCB8 7QF\n\nNo Admission or Programme.\n\nThis was a rare chance to tick off a game here under the lights, as 9th in the league table (Drawn 1, Lost 1) hosted 5th (Won 1). Kennett opened the scoring midway through the first half, with a 25 yarder that went over the ’keeper. Their job was made a little easier when the visitors had a player sin binned seven minutes before the break, but it wasn’t until six minutes into the second half that they made it 2-0, when a long through ball was finished into the bottom corner. Two goals in four minutes saw it become 4-0, before an own goal, followed by a header from a corner saw the visitors pull it back to 4-2 late on, but it was too little, too late to get anything from the game.\n\nWest Sussex League\n\nDivision 2 South\n\nSaturday 17th September 2022\n\nKick Off 15.00 Actual 15.01\n\nBeaumont Park 1 Wittering United 1, attendance 24\n\n18’ 0-1\n\n76’ 1-1\n\n@ Angmering Sports & Social Club, Pitch 2\n\nDecoy Drive\n\nAngmering\n\nBN16 4DN\n\nNo Admission or Programme.\n\nToday I decided to ’tidy up’ a venue I had already visited, but for a different pitch. Back on 13th April 2011 I saw Angmering draw 0-0 versus Lancing United in a West Sussex League Premier Division match, a game that was played on the pitch that runs parallel in front of the clubhouse, which also has a small area of cover, whilst today’s match was played on the pitch to the rear of the building (complete with training lights along one side) to the right of the car park and running the opposite way to the other pitch. I was guaranteed to get the pitch I needed, as two matches were scheduled here today. Angmering Village hosted Angmering on the main pitch, with Village taking the local bragging rights with a 5-2 win, also in Division 2 South.\n\nThis was the first game of the season for Beaumont Park, owing to the odd number of teams in this division, whilst Wittering had lost their opening match 0-4 at home to Angmering Village. There wasn’t much between the two teams today, with a point apiece a fair outcome. Wittering went ahead with a free kick that went in off the underside of the crossbar after eighteen minutes, but Beaumont Park levelled the scores with an equaliser fourteen minutes from time.\n\nSouthampton District F.A. Senior Cup\n\n1st Round\n\nFriday 16th September 2022\n\nKick Off 19.45 Actual 19.48\n\nHedge End Rangers 1 Colden Common 4, attendance 135\n\n12’ 1-0\n\n23’ 1-1\n\n39’ 1-2\n\n51’ 1-3\n\n66’ 1-4\n\n@ Deer Park School, 3G Pitch\n\noff Woodhouse Lane\n\nHedge End\n\nSO30 2HT\n\nNo Admission\n\nProgramme sold out.\n\nThis was the first competitive ‘midweek’ game played on the new 3G pitch here at Deer Park School. It is typical of many of the cages built these days, with spectator access limited to three quarters of one side of the pitch and a small seated kit stand on that same side. The club had issued a programme to commemorate the occasion, but had misjudged the numbers massively, as it had sold out a good forty minutes before kick off, which cost them dearly, as they hadn’t charged any admission price.\n\nHedge End Rangers play in the Southampton League Premier Division, sitting bottom of the table, albeit after just one match, whilst Colden Common are two levels higher, currently in third place in the Hampshire Premier League Senior Division, with 5 wins, 1 draw and 1 defeat from their opening seven matches, so tonight’s result wasn’t too much of a surprise.\n\nHedge End went ahead after twelve minutes, with a side footed finish, but an unmarked header from a corner saw their lead last just nine minutes. Colden Common went onto the break leading 1-2, when a through ball was clinically finished six minutes before halftime. It was game over early in the second half as it became 1-3, before a tap in at the far post made it 1-4 midway through the half.\n\nEssex Alliance League\n\nSenior Division\n\nWednesday 7th September 2022\n\nKick Off 19.45 Actual 20.08\n\nKit Out London 3 Rapid Chingford 1, att. 22\n\n45’ + 3, 1-0\n\n51’ 1-1\n\n62’ 2-1 (pen)\n\n68’ 3-1\n\n@ Noak Hill Sports Complex, 3G Pitch\n\nNoak Hill Road\n\nHarold Hill\n\nRomford\n\nRM3 7YA\n\nNo Admission or Programme.\n\nThis never had a chance of kicking off at the advertised kick off time, as there was a youth team training on the pitch until 8 o’clock, so it finally got underway 23 minutes late. It is a standard caged pitch, with spectator access along three quarters of one side, with viewing not helped by the fact that three of the eight floodlights were not working, which is pretty poor at this level.\n\nThe game itself was pretty average, not helped by an injury in the first five minutes to the visitors ’keeper, which resulted in a short delay whilst he was treated, before being replaced. The deadlock was broken by the hosts three minutes into stoppage time at the end of the half, when a break down the right beat the offside trap, followed by a finish across the ’keeper into the far corner.\n\nSix minutes into the second half it was 1-1, when a long ball over the top was finished coolly by the striker as he raced clear. Just after the hour mark the hosts went back in front from the penalty spot, then wrapped the game up six minutes later, again finishing one on one after being played through on goal.\n\nEastern Counties League\n\nLeague Challenge Cup\n\n1st Round\n\nTuesday 6th September 2022\n\nKick Off 19.30 Actual 19.32\n\nStanway Pegasus 3 Haverhill Borough 0, attendance 121 (official)\n\n26’ 1-0\n\n50’ 2-0 (pen)\n\n62’ 3-0\n\n@ The Stanway School, 3G Pitch\n\nWinstree Road\n\nStanway\n\nCO3 0QA\n\n£5 Admission\n\n£2 Programme, 12 pages.\n\nStanway Pegasus have made a good start to life at Step 6 of the Football Pyramid, following promotion from the Essex & Suffolk Border League (Step 7) this season. They are top of Division 1 South after their opening eight matches, which have seen them take 19 points, with just one defeat so far. Haverhill Borough are 9th Division 1 North, having won 2 and lost 2 of their first four games.\n\nStanway should have gone ahead after 25 minutes, heading wide when unmarked, but they broke the deadlock a minute later, finishing side footed after the ball wasn’t cleared. Twice in the final minute of the first half they could have increased their lead, when firstly a miss hit cross clipped the top of the crossbar, before a shot was cleared off the line.\n\nFive minutes into the second half it was 2-0, when the ’keeper was sent the wrong way from a coolly converted penalty and the scoring was rounded off just after the hour mark, finishing with an angled shot into the far corner, to give the hosts a well deserved win.\n\nWest Sussex League\n\nDivision 2 South\n\nSaturday 3rd September 2022\n\nKick Off 14.00 Actual 13.58\n\nFittleworth 2 Milland 0, attendance 32\n\n19’ 1-0\n\n45’ 2-0\n\n@ Fittleworth Sports Clubs Association\n\nSchool Lane\n\nFittleworth\n\nRH20 1JB\n\nNo Admission or Programme.\n\nToday’s match was the opening league fixture for these two clubs. According to the final league tables from last season, Fittleworth finished fifth in Division 3 South, so i’m not sure why they are playing in a higher division this season, whilst Milland had finished fifth in this division.\n\nIt was pretty even throughout. Fittleworth led 2-0 at the break, opening the scoring nineteen minutes in, with a quick break down the right after successfully defending a corner, before doubling their lead right on halftime, when a cross was headed in from just inside the box. Milland missed a sitter with fifteen minutes left, putting the ball over the crossbar when it looked easier to score. Ten minutes from time they hit the crossbar, with the ’keeper well beaten, before Fittleworth nearly made it three, heading just past the far post in stoppage time.\n\nHampshire Premier League\n\nDivision 1\n\nMonday 29th August 2022\n\nKick Off 15.00 Actual 15.09\n\nMeon Milton 6 Hedge End Town 0, attendance 38\n\n3’ 1-0\n\n33’ 2-0\n\n39’ 3-0\n\n42’ 4-0\n\n52’ 5-0\n\n88’ 6-0\n\n@ Cockleshell Community Sports Club\n\nCockleshell Gardens\n\nEastney\n\nPO4 9SA\n\nNo Admission or Programme.\n\nMeon Milton came into this having won 1 and Lost 2 of their opening three games, whilst Hedge End Town were undefeated, having picked up a win and two draws from their matches so far.\n\nThe game as a contest was all over by halftime, as Meon Milton opened up a four goal lead. It may have been different if Hedge End hadn’t sent a penalty high and wide after sixteen minutes, when it was still only 1-0. The hosts added two more in the second half, with Conor Mansfield rounding off the scoring by completing his hattrick, with goal number six in the dying minutes."
