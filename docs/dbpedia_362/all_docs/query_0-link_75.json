The weather will remain very cold in Moldova, Dobrogea and Muntenia regions in Eastern Romania, including in the capital Bucharest, for most of this week.\n\nA code orange for very cold weather entered into force in more than half of the country, on Monday, and another orange code for blizzard was announced on Monday and Tuesday in the country’s southern region, including the capital Bucharest.\n\nThe highway connecting Bucharest to the Black Sea port of Constanta and 25 national roads in southern Romania were closed on Tuesday morning due to the blizzard. The closed roads included those connecting Bucharest to Calarasi (DN3), Oltenita (DN4), and Giurgiu (DN5). Almost 60 trains were canceled on Monday and several flights on the Henri Coanda International Airport registered delays.\n\nSchools were closed on Monday in Bucharest and several counties in southern Romania. Schools will remain closed on Tuesday in Bucharest, Ilfov, Dolj, Teleorman, Giurgiu, Constanta, and Tulcea. In Olt and Braila, schools will stay closed on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\neditor@romania-insider.com\n\n(photo source: Compania Naţională de Administrare a Infrastructurii Rutiere on Facebook)"
