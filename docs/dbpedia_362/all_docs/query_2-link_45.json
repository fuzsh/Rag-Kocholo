        "text": "In order to solve and clarifying certain aspects of the clay content (particles less then 0.002 mm) sands and sandy soils, humus, respectively, the process of bioaccumulation and mineralization the organic matter of the land, in the Research and Development Centre for Plant Growing on Sand Dabuleni, have initiated research aimed at finding methods and means for accumulating and thus the increase in the content of clay in the soil, respectively humus.Therefore, to improve radical of sandy soils, we found it necessary to resort to what is called loess process. It consists in enriching the horizon the surface soil (20-25 cm) the fraction with 8-10% clay, to 1.5-5%, as currently it contains. It is primarily intended to influence various amounts loess material on physical, hydro- physical and chemical properties of soils, then the plant response to changes products in the soil, increasing the guaranteed potential fertility of these soils, which will result in production high and constant.Obtaining appropriate agricultural production on sandy soils (eutric psamosol) it is limited not only by the soil, but also other factors such as relief, drainage and even climate. Because coarse texture, water-holding capacity in the case of sandy soils it is very low in all soils, the clay content below 5% production capacity of soils it is particularly low in the absence of agropedoameliorative measures and especially irrigation. Wind erosion occurs in all perimeters sandy soils, with higher intensity is observed in Oltenia Plain (Dabuleni Field).\n\nSandy soils from Oltenia Plain occupies the largest area in the country, about 209.400 ha and are situated on terraces of the Danube, the Jiu and Olt River and west Oltenia Plain. The primary material of the origin of the sand in the south Oltenia is the Carpathians South of Olt and Jiu, the differences consisting of the amount somewhat less coarse sand by the Danube, rich in calcium carbonate thereof as compared to the sand and sandy soils from Left Jiu. The territory between Olt, Jiu, and Danube consists of two distinct areas: one field Leu-Rotunda, located in southeastern Oltenia. This field is a continuation of the surface of the plateau levatinului Piedmont. The second area is formed by terraces Olt, Jiu and Danube. This area has the absolute altitude between 110-140 m with slopes to the east and south. As such relief formations have shown sandy dunes and interdune form. Dunes had heights of 5-15 m and 100-500 m width were interdune. Area with sandy soils in southern Oltenia is crossed by a river system, represented by the Danube River to the south, Olt River to the east and west Jiu River. Plant growth and development of the sandy, is related to the presence of water, which has a decisive role. Low rainfall, high temperatures and Austru wind, warm and dry, make sands of Oltenia sometimes take the form of semi-desert. From an textural, in most cases, the percentage of coarse sand is higher and the lower sand on the dune and the interdune increase both the proportion of sand and the clay. In Oltenia Plain appear dominant cernisols represented by typical chernozems, calcic chernozems, cambic chernozems, gleyic chernozems and argic chernozems, which are added some luvisols of type reddish preluvosols and typical luvosols and some typical eutricambosols. Not missing hidrisols nor salsodisols, and in floodplains and terraces predominate protisols with distric psamosols and eutric aluviosols. Lately, as a result of pedoameliorative measures, such as shaping and leveling, were essential changes in both the forms of relief, and the main physical and chemical properties, disappearing dunes due to mobilization on higher ground sand and depositing the material in interdune. Excavated and deposited quantities of sand are varied both in terms of origin and physic and chemical properties. Production potential is medium. Requires to stem deflation, the increase in organic matter in the soil and especially in the areas set (level model), the fertilization and maintaining forest cover.\n\nThe effect of different soil tillage systems on the compaction and water content of the soil was studied in three experimental years, 2002, 2003 and 2004. The study was conducted in a long-term soil tillage field experiment set up in Keszthely (Hungary) in 1972. The bi-factorial trial was arranged in a split plot design with four replications. The size of the main plots was 435 m2 (soil tillage) and that of the sub-plots 87 m2 (different rates of N fertilizer). The effect of different rates of N fertilization was studied in three different soil tillage systems in a maize - maize - winter wheat -winter wheat rotation. The soil tillage variants were as follows: conventional tillage system (deep winter ploughing+secondary tillage) A1 shallow tillage system (shallow winter discing+secondary tillage) A3 minimum tillage system (discing just before drilling) A2 Since fertilization did not influence the factors studied the fertilizer treatments are not detailed in this paper. The soil was a Ramann's brown forest soil (Eutric Cambisol) containing 41% sand, 32% silt and 27% clay. The available phosphorus content of this sandy loam soil was low (AL-P2O5: 60-80 mg · kg -1), the potassium content medium (AL-K2O: 140-160 mg · kg-1) and the humus content fairly low (1.6-1.7%), with a pHKCl value of 7.3. The long-term annual mean precipitation averages 650 mm on the study site, but the distribution is often unfavourable. In two experimental years (2002 and 2003) the weather was considerably drier than the long-term average. The penetrometric resistance and water content of the soil were measured using a 3T SYSTEM penetrometer. This device can register soil compaction parallel with water content data in each 1 cm layer up to a depth of 90 cm. In the present study the soil was tested at depths of 0-50 cm. It can be concluded from the results that the different soil tillage systems had a significant effect on the physical conditions and on water content of the soil, but these effects differed in the three experimental years due to the different weather conditions and the cumulative effect of drought. In the crop year 2004, when the amount of precipitation was close to the long-term average, the conventional tillage system resulted in the highest yield of maize as well as the lowest values of penetration resistance.\n\nThe model experiment of sandy soils of the Borská nížina lowland showed the contemporary level of anthropic influences of soils in studied ecosystems. The soils and their profiles were selected from following ecosystems: forest soil, livestock yard soil and arable soil (area under crops). The obtained results showed, that the most significant changes in soil physical properties (bulk density, total porosity) appeared in soil profile of livestock yard soil in comparison with forest soil. Due to accumulation of organic matter in livestock yard soil the bulk density (BD) was significantly decreased, in forest soil was observed only natural compaction of soil. In arable soil, compaction of subsoil was clearly determined. The same results appeared in the values of total porosity. Total porosity was the highest in livestock yard soil in Adr1 horizon which was caused by high content of organic matter. Decreasing of soil acidity in arable soils in comparison with forest soils appeared as the result of calcareous fertilization. There was recorded a significant decrease of humus content as a result of intensive mineralization caused by cultivation, overdeeping of the humus horizon with narrow C:N ratios and higher content of plant nutrients, namely, phosphorus and potassium. In livestock yard soil, there was high contents of alkali salts, water-soluble salts, which came from cattle. Because, the evaluated soils have sandy texture, there is the danger of eluviation of salts to underground water what can contaminate the environment.\n\nThe determination of the intensity of anthropic influence is necessary for the evaluation of human impacts on soil properties. The model experiment of sandy soils of the Borská nížina lowland showed the contemporary level of anthropic influences of soils in studied ecosystems. The soils and their profiles were selected from following ecosystems: forest soil, livestock yard soil (high density of cattle) and arable soil (area under crops). Due to accumulation of organic matter in livestock yard soil the bulk density (BD) was significantly decreased, in forest soil was observed only natural compaction of soil. In arable soil, compaction of subsoil was clearly determined, what is documented by higher value of BD in Ao2 (second) horizon than in Ao1 (first) horizon. The same results appeared in the values of total porosity. Total porosity was the highest in livestock yard soil in Ao horizon which was caused by high content of organic matter. The results of chemical analyses showed that human impact was positive and negative, too. Decreasing of soil acidity in arable soils in comparison with forest soils appeared as the result of calcareous fertilization. There was recorded a significant decrease of humus content as a result of intensive mineralization caused by cultivation, overdeeping of the humus horizon with narrow C:N ratios and higher content of plant nutrients, namely, phosphorus and potassium. In livestock yard soil, there was high contents of alkali salts, water-soluble salts, which came from cattle."
