        "text": "1. Tourist Info Center\n\nWelcome to Giurgiu! In Giurgiu I noticed a contradiction. Although it has a tourist info center very well set up in terms of the information provided, the objectives themselves are not highlighted. Start your visit in Giurgiu at the Tourist Information and Promotion Center located in Mihai Viteazul Park. A nice lady opened the door for me a few minutes before the displayed opening time. In the center I found a lot of maps and information, including from many other areas of the country. I also noticed a nice corner with popular costumes.\n\nFrom the Tourist Information Center we head to the South, on the main thoroughfare of the city, passing Mihai Viteazul Park, where the equestrian statue of the one who was the liberator of the city in 1595 can be found.\n\n3. The Clock Tower\n\nAddress: Mircea cel Batran street / Unirii Square\n\nWe keep walking until the Clock Tower It dates back to the 18th century, when the land was occupied by the Turks, who were also the builders of the objective – a 22-meter high gazebo, with the role of an observation tower. The clock was added after the liberation of the territories from the Ottomans. It is a historical monument and is the symbol of the city of Giurgiu, being part of the coat of arms of the county. Several streets start radially from the tower, which attests that the tower was a kind of km 0 of the city. At least this symbol should look flawless.\n\n5. “Nicolae Bălănescu” Athenaeum\n\nAddress: Episcopiei street 21\n\nWe took the direction 45 degrees to the left, next to Giurgiului Episcopate to admire a beautiful building – Nicolae Bălănescu Athenaeum. It looks like a Greek temple. The Roman eagle is placed on the facade. It was built in 1940 through the philanthropic gesture of the lawyer Balanescu on the site of his former house, which he demolished to build the Athenaeum.\n\nWe follow the same street, which takes a half-right turn, and then Parcului street, to pass by the Apollo Statue and the Bust of Aristide Poulopoulos, where to my credit I found QR codes that allowed you to find out information.\n\n6. “Teohari Antonescu” County Museum\n\nAddress: 3 Constantin Dobrogeanu Gherea street\n\nVisiting schedule: from Tuesday to Sunday between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m\n\nThe County Museum is named after the archeology professor Teohari Antonescu, born in Giurgiu. It has history, ethnography and archeology departments. The entrance to the museum is flanked by cannons.\n\n7. Alei Park\n\nAddress: 36 Mircea cel Batran Street\n\nOpposite the museum is Parkul Alei or Grădina Alei, an old park established in 1831, quite small, in the middle of which is the Alley of Heroes where there are 23 bronze busts of heroes from the War of Independence and the Monument of Heroes and on an alley the Gazebo for the marching band. On a plinth at the exit from the corner is raised the Bust of Mihai Eminescu.\n\n8. Bizetz Bridge\n\nThe Bizetz Bridge reminds me of the old Grant Bridge in Bucharest. It is the work of engineers Anghel Saligny and Ion-Ionescu Bizetz. The bridge crosses the Sfantu Gheorghe Canal. It was put into use in 1905 as a road and railway bridge, the only curved bridge in Europe at that time. During the tests, as proof of reliability, the engineers stayed in a boat under the bridge. Today it can only be crossed by foot.\n\n9. Giurgiu Port Captaincy (Palace of the River Station)\n\nFrom the Bizetz Bridge, we cross 2 km through a really unkempt area next to the Naval Shipyard and the Zonal Headquarters to the Giurgiu Port, where the building of the Port Authority or the Palace of the River Station can also be found.\n\nThe blocks from the neighboring city of Ruse can be seen across the Danube. Several ships, which are restaurants, are moored at the quay on the Danube. The captaincy looks better from afar, but when we get closer, the signs of old age of the building stand out. We admire the Danube before returning to the city.\n\nWe return to the canal on the same route, this time crossing the Speranței Bridge, parallel to the Bizetz Bridge. On the left side, an indicator directs our gaze towards\n\n10. Giurgiu Fortress\n\nAddress: Digului street\n\nGiurgiului Citadel or the Citadel of Mircea the Elder is a ruin, but several walls or fragments of thick walls have remained standing after centuries, even if invaded by weeds. And again, surprisingly by contrast, if the walls lie in ruins and without an access road arranged for them, instead we have a plate with a QR code, on the road, next to the bridge."
