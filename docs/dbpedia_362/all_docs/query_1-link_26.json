        "text": "Physical Mapping of Dn5\n\nThe 23 F2 families derived from F1 monotelosomic 7DL plants included 18 nonsegregating, susceptible families and five families that segregated for resistance. The five families that segregated for resistance obviously resulted from recombination between 7DL and 7D of 92RL28 and represent one of two recombinant classes expected. Initially, 54 testcross F1 were screened, making it possible to derive a rough estimate of the distance between the centromere and Dn5 (19 cM). Thus, Dn5 appeared to be linked to the centromere. 7 found that Dn5 was not linked to the centromere (distance = 59.3 cM) while their data showed strong deviant segregation of Dn5, which probably influenced the estimate. The nine ditelosomic 7DS families were all susceptible to RWA.\n\nThe authenticity of the telosomes was confirmed using known chromosome 7D markers. Gwm437 primers amplified a fragment of 112 bp in CS and a fragment of 105 bp in PI 294994, while gwm150 primers amplified a fragment of 117 bp in both CS and PI 294994. Both markers map to chromosome arm 7DL and were only amplified in 7DL monotelosomic plants. Microsatellite gwm111 primers amplified polymorphic fragments of 215 and 209 bp in PI 294994 and CS, respectively. The Xgwm111 locus could only be detected in 7DS ditelosomic plants, which is in agreement with 14 and 26, who mapped the locus on 7DS. Gwm44 specific primers amplified fragments of 180 and 185 bp in PI 294994 and CS, respectively, and only produced amplicons in plants having 7DS. Results for Xgwm150 and Xgwm44 are shown in Fig. 1 and 2, respectively.\n\nWhen the endopeptidase bands produced by the TF2 progeny of each 7DL monotelosomic family were determined, it was found that the Ep-D1a allele which occurs in CS was present in 16 of the TF2 families, but absent in the remaining six families which possessed the Ep-D1e allele that occurs in PI 294994 (18). The variation in Ep-D1 alleles among the 7DL TF2 progeny may be explained by the fact that this locus was not selected for during backcrossing to produce the near isogenic line 92RL28. This may have resulted in co-transfer of Ep-D1e and Dn5 in a proportion of plants. The ditelosomic 7DS families did not produce any Ep-D1 products. The data therefore confirmed that Dn5 is located on chromosome arm 7DL as was proposed by 7 In view of this result, the Palmiet-Dn5 source used by 14 should be treated as Palmiet-Dn (unknown). Mistaken identity of the latter gene could also explain at least some of the inconsistencies surrounding earlier studies with Dn5, particularly tests of allelism with the other group 7 Dn loci.\n\nMapping of an Unidentified Russian Wheat Aphid Resistance Gene\n\nTwo hundred and four excised embryos derived from the cross: PI 294994/CS//maize, developed into plantlets, of which 94 survived the transfer to soil and subsequent colchicine treatment. Root tip chromosome counts were done to confirm that all were haploid. The 12 microsatellite markers and the Ep-D1 locus produced polymorphic bands that could be scored unambiguously. The reported location (Materials and Methods) of each microsatellite marker could be confirmed using the aneuploid stocks. A single dominant RWA resistance gene segregated in the DH population. There had been no genetic evidence of the presence of more than one RWA resistance gene in the PI 294994 plants used at the time, and it was assumed that the source contained only Dn5 However, results obtained by 8, 3, 24, and 14 suggested that PI 294994 is a heterogeneous source of Dn-genes. The Dn-gene that segregates in the DH population is therefore unconfirmed, and will be referred to as Dn The mapped loci, segregation ratios observed and probabilities that they conform to a 1:1 ratio are shown in Fig. 3. The computer software organized the markers in two linkage groups, since the recombination frequency between Xbarc157 and Xgwm428 exceeded 40%. All distances were calculated with a LOD score higher than 3.0 except between Xbarc157 and Xgwm428 where a LOD score was not determined. The marker order of the first linkage group generally corresponded with the 7D map given by the ‘Komugi’ database (http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/wheat/komugi/top/top.jsp; accessed February 2005; verified 4 Oct. 2005) except for markers Xgwm428 and Xwmc157 that were reversed. When comparing the marker order of the second linkage group to the Komugi map it was found that markers Xgwm37 and Xbarc 76 were also switched around. The genetic distances between markers did not always correspond well with those of the Komugi map, and these differences may relate to the sizes of the mapping populations used, variation in parental genetic background, and segregation distortion. The centromere is located between markers Xgwm111 and Xbarc26 (14).\n\nAccording to the linkage map (Fig. 3), Dn is located on the short arm of chromosome 7D and is loosely linked to microsatellite markers Xgwm111 (43 cM) and Xgwm44 (31 cM). 14 obtained a similar result in a genetic mapping experiment with a PI 294994 derived RWA resistance gene in Palmiet-Dn5 However, the physical map data obtained in the present study, using the source material, clearly showed that Dn5 is located on 7DL. Thus, Dn is either a gene other than Dn5 or the linkage map data are inaccurate. Inconsistent results have been obtained in various earlier studies of the six Dn genes assigned to chromosome 7D. At least some of the Dn genes may be allelic (24; 14, 2002) although symbols were originally assigned on the basis of data that suggested distinct loci. Similarly, different studies assigned Dn2 and Dn5 to opposite chromosome arms. Segregation studies differed regarding the number of loci involved in PI 137739 and PI 294994. Since most of the conclusions were based on segregation ratios, it is possible that preferential survival of specific gene combinations may have resulted in erroneous conclusions. 18 and 7 reported non-Mendelian segregation of Dn5 and in the present study evidence of segregation distortion was also found. The unpredictable nature of these variations may have consequences for genetic studies. From Fig. 3 it would appear that two areas could have had distorted segregation, that is, Dn as well as an area around Xbarc26 Furthermore, the two regions had effects with opposite direction that may have magnified the total distortion. For Dn, the PI 294994 region had preferential transmission; for Xbarc26, the PI 294994 region showed impaired transmission.\n\nA more detailed analysis of the results obtained with a subset of markers in areas with apparent normal transmission (Xgwm44 and Xgdm67) and the two areas with affected transmission (Dn and Xbarc26) was therefore done. Simpler symbols were assigned to the four loci and the appropriate map data summarized in Table 1 Gametes 3 and 4 should have occurred in approximately equal numbers; however, there were four times as many Rc gametes (Dn from PI 294994; Xbarc26–7D from CS) as there were rC (dn from CS; Xbarc26–7D from PI 294994) gametes. Considering all the recombinant gametes there were 20 Rc gametes but only three rC The parental gametes, RC and rc, appeared to segregate normally and amounted to 35 and 34, respectively. The recombinant classes deviated significantly from 1:1 segregation (χ2 = 12.6, P = 0.0004) and suggested that interaction of the R and c chromosome regions resulted in differential viability of gametes. This effect may have affected calculations to determine the linear order of the four genes. The two genes in the middle could have been A and C, A and G, or C and G. To decide which, it is necessary to consider the gamete pairs that could have been produced by triple crossovers, that is, 5 and 6, 9 and 10, or 15 and 16. Normally, triple crossover products are expected to be very rare and should be those gametes occurring at the lowest frequency. However, for the three candidate triple crossover classes, very similar numbers of gametes were found, respectively, 3, 3, and 1, raising doubts as to which is the correct group to use. Furthermore, the two groups containing three members each included the preferentially transmitted Rc gene combination, which may have resulted in inflated numbers. If the three pairs of gametes are considered as possible triple recombinants, three possible gene orders can be deduced as is shown in Table 1 On the basis of the physical map data, the sequence based on recombinants 5 and 6 is clearly wrong. Assuming that 15 and 16 are the triple recombinants, the gene order is RACG (Dn–Xgwm44–Xbarc26–Xgdm67) with Dn on 7DS as suggested by the Mapmaker results of Fig. 3 However, if 9 and 10 are taken as the triple recombinant group, the gene order becomes RCGA (Dn–Xbarc26–Xgdm67–Xgwm44), which would suggest that Dn occurs on 7DL and is probably Dn5 This possibility can of course be investigated through telosomic analysis of DHs carrying Dn It would therefore appear that the DH population developed in this study is not suited for mapping of the genes in question.\n\nIf Dn is in fact located on 7DS, then there may be three or more Dn genes or clusters on 7D, namely Dn5 on 7DL, a proximal 7DS cluster (which could include Dn1, Dn2, Dn6, and Dnx) and a 7DS distal locus, Dn8 Conversely, if Dn is Dn5 on 7DL, then it is possible that some or all of the closely linked/allelic loci (14, 2002) in reality also occur on 7DL.\n\nNo. Genotype of DH/gamete No. of gametes Gene order based on specific pair of gametes 1 RACG 26 2 racg 24 3 Racg 12 4 rACG 3 5 RAcg 3 R(Dn)-G(Xgdm67, 7DL)- A(Xgwm44, 7DS)- C(Xbarc 26, 7DL) 6 raCG 0 R(Dn)-G(Xgdm67, 7DL)- A(Xgwm44, 7DS)- C(Xbarc 26, 7DL) 7 RACg 5 8 racG 8 9 RacG 3 R(Dn)-C(Xbarc26, 7DL)-G(Xgdm67, 7DL)-A(Xgwm44, 7DS) 10 rACg 0 R(Dn)-C(Xbarc26, 7DL)-G(Xgdm67, 7DL)-A(Xgwm44, 7DS) 11 RAcG 2 12 raCg 0 13 RaCG 3 14 rAcg 4 15 RaCg 1 R(Dn)-A(Xgwm44, 7DS)-C(Xbarc26, 7DL)-G(Xgdm67, 7DL) 16 rAcG 0 R(Dn)-A(Xgwm44, 7DS)-C(Xbarc26, 7DL)-G(Xgdm67, 7DL) Total 94\n\nApart from gametocidal effects and chance, another possible explanation for nonconformance of the DH data set to Mendelian segregation may simply be that specific genotypic combinations had a lower chance of being successful when pollinated with maize, raised in tissue culture and subsequently treated with colchicine. However, the fact that numerous earlier studies involving diverse crosses (and research groups) suggested irregular and inconsistent segregation of Dn5 and other centromere-linked chromosome 7D Dn genes, would suggest that the area surrounding the 7D centromere may be problematic in terms of genetic analysis. It is therefore also possible that polymorphism for microchromosomal rearrangements could cause irregular transmission of meiotic products in certain crosses. Whatever the cause, the present DH mapping data were clearly skewed and conclusions drawn regarding the affected genes will need to be confirmed using physical mapping."
