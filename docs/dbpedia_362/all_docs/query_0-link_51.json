        "text": "#Constanta The most ambitious urban reconversion project will be developed in the port city, through a partnership between Oil Terminal and IULIUS. The investment exceeds 800 million Euros. As the first stage of the association, IULIUS assumed to fulfil all environmental obligations regarding the land and its greening. \"ConstanÈ›a is our new destination, a city with major growth potential and valuable human capital. Our objective is a firm one, that of offering the local community an open and useful project for all, with urban gardens and relaxation, entertainment and cultural functions, but also a hub of development opportunities, directly impacting new jobs. We strongly believe in the potential of ConstanÈ›a and have the necessary expertise and resources to realize a project that will support the port city to capitalize on all its assets and become one of the economically strong regional centres. We will do this together with the local community, understanding in depth the needs and expectations of the inhabitants, as we did in the case of the other urban regeneration projects from IaÈ™i, TimiÈ™oara and Cluj-Napoca\", said Iulian DascÄƒlu, President of IULIUS. #RomaniaPropertyClub #Investments #RomaniaRealEstate\n\nThe journey around the world to our 54 joint ventures and long-term partnerships continues. Over to #America! Let's visit #Mexico! Mexico is a federal republic in #CentralAmerica framed by the #Pacific Ocean, the Gulf of Mexico and the #Caribbean Sea. The capital of the country is Mexico City. Neighboring countries are the #US to the north and #Guatemala and #Belize to the southeast. Mexico is the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world and has about 129 million inhabitants. The country is highly #biodiverse, encompasses diverse climatic conditions, and is home to a variety of animals and plants. It has a long history dating back to the #Aztec Empire, of which World Heritage sites such as ChichÃ©n ItzÃ¡ can still be admired. The country is nevertheless also #industrial and many people are employed in the automotive industry or its supplier industries. Mexico's #road #network is approximately 377,000 kilometers long. In terms of traffic safety, it ranks in the middle of the world. #forgivingmobilityasmartandsecurefuture #tÃ¶nnjesinternationalgroup #rainrfid\n\nðŸš¢ Major Investment to Boost Port Capacity in El Salvador ðŸš¢ Exciting developments are on the horizon for the Port of Acajutla and La UniÃ³n in El Salvador! ðŸš¢âš“ The first $50 million of a substantial $1.615 billion investment will be disbursed by the end of 2024, marking the beginning of a transformative phase for the country's main maritime hubs. This investment will address urgent needs, such as rehabilitating existing piers and acquiring new cargo handling equipment. The plan, detailed by CEPA President Federico Anliker, outlines two major phases: Phase 1: Construction of a new container pier and terminal at Acajutla. New storage and operational facilities. $75 million allocated to La UniÃ³n for dredging and equipment upgrades. Phase 2: Further expansion with a second pier at Acajutla. Advanced technology and infrastructure improvements. With this investment, the Port of Acajutla is set to triple its capacity, targeting to handle between 1.6 and 1.8 million containers annually, up from the current 500,000. These advancements are expected to position El Salvador as a key player in the region's maritime logistics, ready to welcome mega-ships with improved infrastructure and operational efficiency.

We want to express our sincerest gratitude to the Association of Peruvians in Australia for their recent visit and our productive meeting. It was a pleasure to share our business plan with you and explore the exciting commercial opportunities between Peru and Australia. We are excited about the potential for collaboration in several key areas: 1. Chancay to Shanghai Port: A new route that will reduce shipping times from 25 days to just 10 days, facilitating #trade and improving logistical efficiency. 2. Airport Infrastructure Improvement: The modernization of Lima Airport Partners and Northern Airports will open up new possibilities for both tourism and cargo transport. 3. Peru Mining: Peru has vast mineral reserves and a competitive exportable offer that represents solid investment opportunities and a robust portfolio of Public-Private Partnership projects. We appreciate your commitment and are confident that, by working together, we can build a prosperous future for both countries. We look forward to continuing our close collaboration and achieving great success!

Let me provide you with more details about this ambitious project: Turbo-Cupica Train: The Colombian government is advancing in the construction of the Turbo-Cupica train, which aims to connect the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. This double-track train would cover 198.6 kilometers, with 11.12 kilometers of tunnels and 132.3 kilometers of viaducts. It is expected to be able to support the passage of 16 trains dailyÂ¹Â². Specialized Ports: The project includes the development of two ports specialized in the operation of maritime containers. One would be located in the Cupica Bay, while the other would be in the Gulf of UrabÃ¡ (Puerto Antioquia). The latter is already well advanced in execution and could be ready to start operations in 2025Â¹. Economic and Environmental Benefits: In addition to improving connectivity and efficiency in cargo and passenger transport, this dry corridor aims to boost the growth of the ChocÃ³ department. It also stands out for its focus on sustainable infrastructure, respecting strategic ecosystems and biological diversityÂ¹. Although the execution costs are significant, with an investment exceeding 25 trillion pesos for the railways and other additional expenses, this project is presented as a strategic alternative for international trade and regional developmentÂ¹. A significant step towards a new interoceanic route! Read the link in Spanish: https://lnkd.in/eR8BVZnb\n\n#Uzbekistan is actively promoting tourism and foreign investment. Last year, Samarkand's airport underwent a complete reconstruction, and there are now plans to establish direct flights to Europe (currently, passengers need to make a stopover in places like Istanbul). The economic expansion project of this country has also led to the construction of a modern district in the eastern part of Samarkand, where several luxury hotels, business centers, conference halls, and a shopping center (in the video) have been built, all designed to emulate the architectural style of the country's historic buildings. This district primarily hosts tourists, business travelers, and visiting delegations. The hotels in the background are among the few skyscrapers in the city: in Samarkand, it's possible to construct buildings with a maximum of 9-10 floors only in the newer part of the city, as the city is under the protection of #UNESCO. It has been very interesting to observe Uzbekistan's development. In fact, Uzbekistan is the second-largest economy in the region, with a continuously growing GDP since 1996 (over 79 billion dollars in 2022, an increase of approximately 10 billion from 2021). Now, the economic and commercial interests of many countries that closed their doors to #Russia after the invasion of Ukraine are shifting towards Central Asia. And Uzbekistan is on the front row for doing business. #ICTWeek #Uzbekistan #business"
