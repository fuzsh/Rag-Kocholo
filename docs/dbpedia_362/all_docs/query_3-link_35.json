        "text": "Well, that was most satisfactory.\n\nJubilee parkrun has been on my vague ‘to do’ list for ages, in honesty, largely because of the alphabet challenge, but also new place to visit, good vibes, in reach of Sheffield, the usual tick list of gloriousness. I picked this week because who wants to go to Norway for their extra parkrun day anyway, bet they don’t get complementary rhubarb at the end, or even rude vegetables I would imagine. Did you know that ‘Rhubarb is technically a vegetable, but is legally considered a fruit. In 1947 a New York court declared rhubarb a fruit because it’s most often cooked as one in the United States’, well it is according to Huffpost, which is good enough for me. Also, today was the occasion of their 100th event, and therefore officially party time. Or would be according to their most recent Facebook post.\n\nBalloons a boon for sure. I do like a pop up parkrun party. I’d get to complete my alphabet, which is officially a thing what’s not to like.\n\nApart from the stupid o’clock start that is. Having said that, as a chronic insomniac, I’m usually just lying awake wishing I wasn’t, awake that is, so having a purpose to get up for in the small hours is also a boon. I was awake from about 4.00 and there were the most amazingly noisy birds at that time. A couple of owls, though some calls I couldn’t recognise at all, giving way to a rousing dawn chorus. It looked like it was going to be a bright sunshiny day too, hurrah. I headed off up the M1 feeling uncharacteristically cheery. The sun was burning off a deep mist, and it was gorgeous out. Or it was for the first bit, as we got further north it gave way to a less than cheery mizzle and fog, but that’s ok too, because rain is good. I hadn’t checked much in advance beyond a postcode to head to. I read that there was free parking in the town centre too, walking distance from the park, but was hoping I’d get near to the park as I worry about adding on extra walking to a parkrun distance. In fact, as I approached the postcode, I saw signs for free parking in one direction and to the Jubilee Park in the other, so figured it really wasn’t far at all, so parked up. There seemed to be ample parking, though I was a bit confused by the prevalence of royal mail red postal vans, which made me wonder if I’d encroached on their parking. But fear not dear reader, I hadn’t it was fine, it was free, and it was but a very short walk to the park gates, even by my somewhat feeble walking endurance standards.\n\nHere it is, the entrance to the park, oooh, exciting!\n\n.\n\n.\n\nSee that sign? More of that later.\n\nBut I’m ahead of myself. I’ve been now, but you might not have been, so let’s check out the course blah de blah on the official Jubilee parkrun website, and the map too, which is pretty hilarious.\n\n.\n\nThe course is at Jubilee Park, Spennymoor. The course is run on a mixture of tarmac paths and grass.\n\nStart at the bottom of the park next to the Villiers Street entrance. Travelling in a clockwise direction, complete 3 full laps plus 1 part lap to finish at the top of the park next to the bowls green. The course is an undulating mixture of grass and paths. Trail shoes may be advisable in the winter. Unfortunately dogs are not allowed at this event.\n\n.\n\nOK, that sounds straightforward…. however, it looks like this:-\n\n.\n\n.\n\nwhich is basically headache inducing. Not even sure if they’ve printed the map the right way up to be fair. Hurrah for marshals, they will be much needed here. A rare benefit of being a walker at parkrun is I don’t have to worry about being a pathfinder on an unfamiliar course, this looks complicated.\n\nIn I went, and it was a revelation. This is a pretty bijou park it’s fair to say, a true pocket park, but it was beautifully landscaped. Colourful packed displays of planting in formal beds set off traditional features like a rather fine bandstand. Then there were contemporary additions like a play area, a formal arch for the Jubilee of 2000, though in fact this is Victoria Park not one for Elizabeth II as I’d assumed. There is a skate boarding area, a Victoria train station, all the things! Also, this sign, which amused me…\n\n.\n\n.\n\nIt was the reference to no person whilst in the park shall – ‘play unauthorised golf’. Is this a known public disorder offence in these parts. I was very confused. Confused that is, until I stumbled on the in situ crazy golf course. This is genius, and probably merits a trip all on its own. It’s a carefully landscaped area, designed around the ‘accomplishments’ of the Victorian age. I say ‘accomplishments’ but presented as it was, a moment in history for every hole, was genuinely educational, let’s just go with it wasn’t an especially woke time. Kudos to whoever designed this feature though, edutainment at its best, much like parkrun itself!\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThis made a bit more sense of the golfing directive. Other directives were also made very clear:\n\n.\n\nFair enough, a lot of work had gone into the planting schemes just look:\n\nBut although you could not ‘tread, mosey, hop, trample, step, plod, tiptoe, trot, meander, creep, prance, amble, jog, trudge, march, stomp, toddle, jump, stumble, trod, sprint or walk on the plants, parkrun takes a different view. With the possible exception of trampling (it’s definitely frowned on to mow down other park users or fellow parkrunners as you participate so to go on to trample them altogether would definitely lead to tuts and passive aggressive sighing from fellow parkrunners at the very least) – you can complete a parkrun however you like. Which is lucky for me as I’m definitely a plodder at present.\n\nDespite being a plodder, the park itself invited a bit of pre parkrun exploration. I was super impressed to find cones and signs already in situ, volunteers were also very focused on balloon tying and bunting display. Jazzing it all up joyfully you might say. I helped hugely by holding one end of a strip of bunting to assist in its disentanglement, and then securing it in situ with a bow under the direction of others. Every little helps, hopefully 🙂\n\n.\n\n.\n\nEven more excitingly, some had broken out the bubbles. I know! Epic.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAll looking very promising, but wait, there was more! There was a large set of buildings adjacent to the finish funnel and immaculately manicured bowling green. In it were loos, hurrah. Also clean and ample in number, with one of those automated soap, water hand driers. That in itself is perhaps unremarkable, we are used to such fripperies and indulgences in this decadent age. What was eye catching though was the laser light show as the machine operated. No really, it was quite astonishing, whether this lumiere display was in honour of the 100th parkrun or a regular occurrence I have no idea, you’ll have to go back and check it out for yourself. Prepare yourself to be truly amazed, the wonder of discovery at a new to you parkrun continues to be delivered. Here is a teaser, doesn’t really do it justice, I failed to capture the glitter ball for example, but you should get the gist. What brave new world is this indeed!\n\n.\n\n.\n\nPlease don’t tell me I need to get out more, such slights degrade you, not me. Just sayin’\n\nAblutions completed, I followed the direction of the balloon and sign carrier to locate the start area, which wasn’t too hard to find on account of it being right near the gates you have previously entered.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe pictures aren’t really capturing the ambience of the park. I admit, my heart sank a bit when I realised it was essentially a four lapper but honestly, the park is so full of little corners of interest, and zig zagging paths there is something to see at every point on the park. Add in balloons and cheering marshals and it’s just as well you get to go round more than once or you’d miss so much of the good stuff. Spring flowers in wildlife areas, formal beds, stone staircases and iron arches, it has it all. Add to this the fact the the event team are on a role with the celebrations and you have it made. They celebrated their flake run (number 99) last week, today is their 100th event (obvs) and then next week they will no doubt have the bunting out all over again for the coronation celebrations, with a name like Jubilee parkun how could they not?\n\nDespite the rarity of the letter ‘J’ in parkrun land, this wasn’t a massive parkrun by any means. Small and perfectly formed. A call went up to welcome first timers, and a group of us duly assembled. Tourists had come from all over, I think from Dorset was the furthest but I lost concentration so might have hallucinated that. Also, I was distracted by the hugely exciting combo of milestone parkrunners. There was an adult on his 100th parkrun, accompanied by a junior on his FIRST EVER parkrun and another junior with a sign on proclaiming his 7th parkrun. This innovation is splendid! Numbers are pretty arbitrary so we should basically celebrate them all, hurrah! Loving the signage, genius. Our official welcomer explained that the purpose of the first timers’ briefing is to make the course sound as complicated as possible. It is really hard to describe to be fair, but when you come to complete it, it does make sense, the magic combo of marshals pointing and cunning cone placement mean it would be really difficult to get lost. This part of the briefing was reassuring. We were also forewarned though that although the park appears pretty flat, there is a bit of a gradient which, in conjunction with the multi-lap routing means you basically run up the same hill 8 times. It’s true, it is deceptive in that respect, good to be warned. Anyway, all very helpful and very jolly, with a backdrop of other volunteers perfecting the event decor. Those numbered balloons won’t hang themselves!\n\n.\n\n.\n\nWe were all jumping up and down with excitement at the prospect of our Jubilee Jog or Jeff around. I was mostly jumping on the inside.\n\nNext stop was photo posing, well it was an especially photo worthy occasion. Jolly balloons, jaunty volunteers, a jam packed parkrun awaited us. Here though first are the high vis heroes!\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAren’t they lovely? Of course they are.\n\nIt wasn’t even raining, positively clearing up, despite a bit of a nip in the air earlier. I tried to get the volunteers jump on three for a photo, but it wasn’t really their thing. However, judging by the roar of laughter that went up from alongside in the start funnel behind me I have a strong suspicion the run director may have had a shot at getting airborne, I’d like to have seen that, maybe next time.\n\nRun Director’s briefing followed. It was really good. It covered a bit of the history of how the parkrun started up, which of course I have now almost entirely forgotten. I do know that but for the pandemic they’d have had a lot more parkruns under their name, I have a feeling it’s start was delayed by the whole lockdown thing. There were the usual thanks. The park is exceptionally well maintained, it looked like someone was doing a litter pick and restoring some flowers to beds where they had been rudely ripped up by some ne’er do well the night before even as we gathered. Welcomes to tourists, milestone shout outs. I don’t think anything was missed. Oh – the no dogs thing for this particular parkrun – it is a park rule, and also adults were instructed to keep up with their accompanying juniors. And cake at the end, by the finish. A great incentive to get around. All good. Then the call went out ‘timers ready?’ ‘Yep’ then we were awf!\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAnd off went all the parkrunners, one marshal scampered balloon laden to her marshal point, and I tucked in towards the back. You start up a gradient, but a chalked sign reminds you to keep going, and then a bubble monitor at the top of the slope guided you onto a grass section to the right, down hill, past daffodils and more bubbles, a veritable bubble path on the way round should you wish it, and then a bit of a cone directed zig and marshal directed zag and back up the hill the other side. It makes perfect sense in the doing, but none whatsoever in the describing of. You’ll just have to jog along and tackle it yourself.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nYou soar by a children’s play area, formal planting, the mini golf course, and up to the point where there is a marshal you pass by three times and then on the fourth occasion turn sharply into the finish tunnel. It is important to be able to count to three and remember what your count is as it is a tad disorientating with everyone else also parkrunning around in all directions, harder than you think to count to three sometimes. Fun though. I liked that you passed marshals more than once, though after the first lap some had repositioned themselves to support the finish funnel high japery. Cones remained in situ though, and it was fine to navigate around once everyone was in motion, pretty much always someone to follow.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThere was a good vibe to the parkrun. Passing parkrunners called encouragement, and the volunteers appeared to be genuinely having a ball. Music was playing near the finish area, and at one point I could hear ‘Come On Eileen‘ blaring out from the sound system whilst Team Bubble were giving a stirring rendition of ‘I’m forever blowing bubbles‘ I do appreciate a bit of gusto at a parkrun and Jubilee was jam-packed with jollity and enthusiasm along those lines! I tried to take photos on the way round, a smorgasbord follows, including some taken by others on the day too. I’ve borrowed from the Jubilee parkrun facebook page, I’m sure they won’t mind too much.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nMaybe the pictures are in fact beginning to put you in the picture. I’m hoping so.\n\nAs I was lapped I suddenly spotted some familiar merchandise – a buff linked to the With Me Now podcast – About parkrun passion by passionate parkrunners. It’s a weekly podcast about all things parkrun, and has just had its 250th pod, which is no mean feat. It’s worth a listen if you like to keep up with parkrun related news and hear about other parkruns. More importantly, it has a community of listeners who got to know one another especially during the lockdown period when the With Me Now team astonishingly, managed to do pretty much daily live streams just to keep people connected. That could be a bit of parkrunpedia (history of particular parkrun courses); parkrun pictionary; parkrun pets; parkrun people; allsorts really. It’s led to really strong friendships and much sharing of parkrun tourism adventuring now we are free to go out and about. Give it a listen, but in the meantime, shout outs to these fellow podders, even though I hadn’t met them before, I feel we belong to the same tribe! ‘Dolly or Bev!’ I don’t often see With Me Now merchandise in the wild!\n\n.\n\n.\n\nOh, and I also thought the floral planting display looked a bit like the With Me Now logo, so that seemed especially apt too.\n\nWhere was I, oh yes, making my way around the course. It did feel like more uphill than down, which I know can’t be true but well, just saying. I did most of the first three laps in limbo land between the parkwalker ahead and the tailwalker behind, but for the final one I dropped back a little to join the tailwalker. It was nice to chat to a key member of the team who takes pride in welcoming walkers every week. Accompanying us was someone who used to live in Spennymoor but moved away and was back visiting, so I was in safe hands. The final loop went quickly. We passed the gathered parkrunners who had already finished and were having a nice social parkrun party. Marshals stood down as we passed, and cones were collected and balloons gathered in. The last of the bubbles distributed, and the final parkrunners flew home down the finish funnel.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nEventually, I joined them, hurrah!\n\n.\n\nIt’s weird that just as parkruns always surprise me by starting, they equally catch me out at the finish. It all feels a bit abrupt. You’ve made friends with lovely people and lost your heart a bit to a new lovely place and then it’s all over, no sooner seemingly than it has begun! Oh well, timed in, scanned, and all done…\n\nexcept it wasn’t! This was the parkrun that keeps on giving. More surprises.\n\nThe biggest surprise was finding there was still cake and flakes and sweets aplenty for us final finishers. Also more 100 decorations AND (and I really like this idea) a visitors book too! Beautifully made, that I was encouraged to sign, and duly did. Others had too. I like this innovation, I’ve not really come across it, and it’s hard to implement I think, but was done well here. But dear reader, there’s more! Rhubarb! Lots of rhubarb! An abundance harvested from one of the core team’s allotments. I was encouraged to help myself and did so with enthusiasm. I don’t know if there is always such rich pickings, but it wouldn’t surprise me if there were.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThere isn’t a cafe on site unfortunately, though I was encouraged to join them at another cafe, which I couldn’t because I needed to get back, and really was feeling it a bit, it is the driving as much as the walking unfortunately, and I was flagging. However, for future reference fellow tourists, on the first Saturday of the month, there is a more deliberate get together at the cafe linked to a nearby Methodist Church, so for any massive parkfaffers out there, that’s probably the Saturday to choose.\n\nHaving said that, I think I chose pretty well, I was a jammy parkrunner to jog up to Jubilee parkrun for jovial celebrations today!\n\nThank you all for the lovely welcome and jolly Jubilee park. Hope our parkrun paths cross again soon. Hope you have a good one next week- how could you not! I shall be marking the coronation celebrations by eating my body weight in rhubarb crumble, it’s going to be grand. #loverhubarb They really should make more of this availability of rhubarb as Jubilee parkrun’s USP, or maybe it is just a merry Jubilee Jape on their part, to keep the element of surprise? I hope I haven’t spoilt it.\n\nThanks for staying with me, hope you’ve had jolly japes wherever you went even if you didn’t get to have a full on personalised bubble bathing experience on the way round. I’m sure wherever you were was jolly nice in its own way.\n\nUsual reminder you can browse through all my parkrun related posts here. Or not. It’s up to you. You’ll need to scroll down for older entries though.\n\nMay you too stumble on a parkrun with surprise offering at the finish, I’m delighted with my rhubarb, but whatever floats your boat. Every parkrun will give you the warm glow of a shared experience and memories to treasure, even if it cannot guarantee to deliver on a fruit fix every time. Still not a bad return for our free, weekly, timed fix.\n\nSame time next week then, at a parkrun near you? Good oh. 🙂\n\nIt is arbitrary I know, but three hundred. That’s loads of parkrunning around, even if latterly it’s been more of a solitary shuffle than an athletic sprint. Surely worth celebrating. I know it’s not an official milestone, no t-shirts, congratulatory telegrams or even cake, but even if not going down the lines of celebrating as such, marking with something memorable at least would surely be in order. No idea how many parkruns I have left in me, so good to lay down a marker at this point. I wondered initially about going with a theme like The 300 Spartans, but that’s probably been done before and maybe a bit low key for such a mighty achievement. Also, the whole ‘tonight we dine in hell‘ thing for the more recent version is somewhat off message for parkrun methinks. It’s supposed to be fun for all remember. Also, the spartan theme is somewhat male centric, I’m tired of that. I’ve been trying to get parkrun to look at the changing the listings for each individual parkruns’ top 500 fasted finishers to a top 500 percentage age grading instead. Or better yet ditch it altogether. I think it’s problematic just listing those parkrunners with the 500 fastest finish times for loads of reasons. Firstly, it goes against the whole ethos of it not being a race, secondly, fastest finish times miss the subtleties of differentiations by age and gender. This matters, because the longer a parkrun has been around for, and the more participants attend, the more women are erased from that listing. Because the average male can run faster than the average female, inevitably female participants are squeezed out. It might be unconscious gender bias, but it’s a neat little example of everyday sexism. For example, if you go to the listings for Bushy parkrun fastest 500 today, there are just 13 females listed in that tally of 500. Yet, the age graded record is apparently ‘Age graded record: Jane DAVIES – 100.23% 21:30 – Event 645 (24 Sep 2016)’ She doesn’t even get onto the fastest 500 list at all. That seems wrong. In addition, in a time when parkrun are aiming to be more inclusive for walkers and celebrating therefore slower average finish times, it’s a total distortion or at least misrepresentation of parkrun’s proclaimed values. I really don’t get it. And yes, I have raised it, every year for the past three years. It’s been acknowledged as anomaly, but yet it remains. It grates especially on international women’s day. I’m feeling especially hurrumphy about it at the moment. Nope, I can do better that having 300 spartan soldiers to mark the occasion of my 300th parkrun. No harm in having a little peek at the film posters again though, for old times sake. Yep, posters look very much like the gender composition of the 300 fastest finishers at Bushy parkrun, but with fewer visible milestone tees and rather more shield bearing and helmet sporting. I can do better than this. Though invincible flying wedges do sound sort of fun to hang about with if I’m completely transparent about my feelings on this front. Even more so if they were invisible, which is how I first read the poster. Oh well.\n\n.\n\nI looked around at other celebratory rituals, and thought maybe something on the lines of the forthcoming Coronation Procession might be more appropriate, but closer scrutiny seems to suggest it’s the King what does the processing, and although he has a lovely carriage and a crown and everything, I thought maybe I’d rather other people did the processing past and I got to watch it all. I did like the dressing up ideas though, and the making a weekend of it. Obvs there’d need to be a parkrun involved. I had hoped to make it to Somerdale parkrun for their curly wurly, that would have been something extra memorable. However, that was just a drive to far, so reset. There must be something I could do…\n\nI know! How about a spontaneous demonstration of adoration in the form of a procession of 48 thousand runners streaming by waving and so on. That would be grand. The backdrop of London would do, make it the Sunday, so time for people to travel down and get organised, and I’d stay with a friend and we could do a London parkrun the day before. Lovely, ’twas a plan! And as for dressing up, well, parkrunday was the twenty second, so that’s 22 which is two two, which is tu tu, presto, parkrun tu tu day, it’s a thing! Yay, loads of people would don tutus, it was but a short leap of the imagination to presume they would all be doing so for me, the parkrun world over. This is how to do it! Check out the event report for Neckarufer parkrun if you don’t believe me! Viele tutus indeed!\n\n.\n\nSaturday tu tu parkrun, Sunday 48 thousand 599 people processing past, perfect way to make the weekend a memorable one, hurrah! But which parkrun to choose.\n\nWe were originally going to cavort round Catford parkrun, my parkrun buddy and London host being in search of seas for her seven Cs and an R parkrun Pirate Challenge (try saying it out loud). However, we had to set sail elsewhere as, turns out, this was cancelled due to Eid celebrations in Mountsfield park. Not to worry, plenty others to choose from. From Cats to Dogs. We considered Barking parkrun, but I’m a slow walker at the moment, and there were no parkwalkers on the volunteer roster for any week, so that raised a doubt about whether or not they would be welcoming to non runners. Our gaze went to Super Sutcliffe parkrun instead. Oh look, three tailwalkers and two parkwalkers, that looked more promising. A Sunny Sutcliffe Saunter for me it would be! Armed with tutus away we would go.\n\nIt was a short drive, lengthened only by having to stop to see if we were going the right way, we were. It turned out to be a fine choice of venue. Loaaaaads of parking, always a good start, and adjacent to an enormous leisure centre which meant there were actual loos. Bonus, their was a unisex queue for the four cubicles available for use, so this kept everything flowing so to speak, and there wasn’t that frustration of having a gazillion women queueing for their designated loos whilst men whizzed on through so to speak. Talking of keeping everything flowing, how about this for dedication to a cause:\n\n.\n\nI know tu tu impressive!\n\nStill, I’m jumping ahead, let’s take a moment to look at the official Sutcliffe parkrun website blah de blah:\n\nThe course is in Sutcliffe Park Nature Reserve, London\n\nThree laps on a mixture of tarmac and gravel round the perimeter of the Nature Reserve. The start and finish are close to the entrance to the Sports Centre and the main car park.\n\nooooo kaaaaay, fairly minimalist description, though I’m liking the reference to a Nature Reserve. The route looks like this:\n\n.\n\nA fairly bijoux park perhaps, but you can be small yet perfectly formed.\n\nWe arrived, we spotted the funnel and the cheery volunteers assembling. We paused for our obligatory tutu shot. Spotted the bucket slalom course and signage various. There was a very fine tree that was a bit of a focal point, not dissimilar to the Bushy parkrun tree, which apparently is not the tree on the parkrun logo as such, but may as well be. Trees are fabulous are they not? Handy too. Rhetorical question by the way, yes they are!\n\n.\n\nThe tree had a handy course map tied up to it. In a nod to nerds, they had embraced the technological innovation of the what3words app, and included this on their map. Guess what? Nope you won’t be able to guess, it’s too hard and also too brilliant, the what three words for this course appear to be three.identical.laps!!!!! I know what are the chances. Properly amazing!\n\nOnly not really though obvs. But for your edification and merriment, the actual location of ‘three.identical.laps’ is in fact\n\ndrum role\n\nnot in existence, the nearest approximation being tree.identical.labs, but I’ll take that. It is a three metre square that is so remote it is in the middle of unchartered territory in Western Australia, amusingly nearish (relatively speaking) to a place called jigalong, which I now wish to go visit. If you are into your Nelson numbers this might be a good destination to seek out. The registered population of this remote aboriginal community is apparently 333, approximately, or it was for the census in 2016. I suppose if you went you’d ruin the maths of it anyway, but quirky observation nevertheless. Little things as they say, I know, well it pleases me, and I’m celebrating.\n\n.\n\nAnyway, we didn’t need to jigalong to Western Australia because we had already joggedalong to Sutcliffe park. And very fine it was looking too. I never tire of the new places parkrun takes me too, corners of the country I might never have otherwise had cause to visit. This was all tu tu exciting!\n\nWe indulged in a little pre parkrun pootling. Examining the tree – which seemed also to serve as a place to leave bags, and availing ourselves of the facilities. After a little while a shout went up for the first timers’ welcome, which was also to take place below the sheltering branches of the lovely tree. But, in a dramatic twist, no sooner had the clarion call for assembly gone up, and a high vis hero started to move towards the tree, a shout went up and another volunteer, with the hugest hound ever, sprang into view. For ’twas she who was to deliver the briefing, working most efficiently to ‘just in time’ principles. Soon an attentive and enthusiastic crowd of first timers surrounded her, including, impressively, some first time everers. A few claimed to have come for the London Marathon. I didn’t want to let on that I knew this was just a cover story for those who were to process past me the following day, but was happy to feign ignorance so they could maintain the illusion of it all being a huge surprise. I would need to stay up late tonight practising my waving, but I’m sure I’d nail it.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nA fine welcome it was too. The course was described in loving terms. Three times round the tree, turns out, those cones around it aren’t just to mark out the space, but also part of the course. A turn around point, that you go round three times, pretty much like Somerdale pavilion parkrun Curly Wurly after all! Hurrah! Oh and it’s a nature reserve so there may be ducks and things and there is absolutely definitively an avenue with cherry blossom that has come out especially for us. Wow, this I was not expecting. Hurrah.\n\nFirst timers’ welcome done and dusted, a bit more ambling, and then we were called together by the Run Director. The numbers were greater than usual apparently, partly by Lucy 300 cheerers or ‘London Marathon Participants’ wink wink; and partly because of displaced people from nearby Catford. Plenty of regulars too though, and a cheery atmosphere despite a slightly overcast day.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nand then we were all at the start and set awf! I did my now usual of watching the runners depart before slotting in at the back. What a merry band of parkrunners they were too. A vision of loveliness, their collective athleticism matched only by their collective positivity and goodcheer!\n\n.\n\n.\n\nDisappointingly few had got the memo about mandatory tu tu wearing, but maybe they were all too focused on preparations for the morrow. Fair enough. You have to respect the right of everyone to participate in parkrun in their own way, them’s the rules.\n\nThis is a three lapper course, and a very pretty one at that. It’s quite a teeny park really, and if you look inwards there seems to be rich habitat for wildlife and if you look outwards you can see tower blocks that surround the green space. Because it’s pretty compact, you can see the other parkrunners ahead of you at first if you are slower, and later on behind you as they come up to lap you, and then ahead of you again once they’ve passed. I got lapped more than once by some, so plenty of opportunity for ‘hellos’ and mutually supportive acknowledgements.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThe first lap I did solo, pausing to acknowledge marshals as I passed. Hurrah for the high vis heroes, who were universally chilled and cheery as well as often cheering which is always a parkrun win. Aren’t they all gawgeous! And just like quality street chocolates, each one is someone’s favourite, personally, I can’t put a barcode to choose between them. The loveliest marshal is always the one you have seen or interacted with most recently.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAt some point I fell into step with the parkwalkers, briefly. One said ‘I have to ask this, why the tu tu?’ I explained about it being a 22 day so a 22 parkrun. The other parkwalker asked ‘well, does that mean you’d wear a tu tu on the 22nd if it was a work day as well. Dear reader, I had never previously considered this possibility, but it makes perfect sense! Genius even. ‘I’m going to say yes to that’ I replied, enigmatically, because honestly I think I should. Though could be tricky if I was filming a period drama say, but I daresay there would be a work around, either by channeling my inner tu tu, or by recognising work is so thin and far between anway, it’s not too likely to be an issue. Good shout though. They pulled ahead as I slowed. I’m so over this walking thing. I start reasonably perky, but as I progress, I get slower and slower. I feel a need to point out that although I like taking photos en route, it is also partly a masking/ coping strategy as I have to keep stopping. I’m heart broken by my physical limitation it’s not fair, and although in some ways it makes life easier having a hidden disability, in other ways it makes it harder because I feel so judged and misunderstood at times. Some people who try to be encouraging suggesting you ‘just try a little run’ it’s well meant but jars. I know my limitations, and in honesty walking the distance at an even pace and without a walking aid is challenge enough for me for now.\n\nAs you get further round the course, we came upon the cherry blossom avenue. Oh wow, this is properly amazing. We picked absolutely the best weekend to do this course for blossom appreciation purposes. It arched over the runners and was properly gorgeous. I tried to take some pics, but not sure they quite do the sight justice.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAfter dancing down the avenue, you emerge and you swerve round toward the finish area, which is also the start area, only the opposite direction and then you do a u-turn around the tree, a sort of looping the loop bit. Like I said, very much like I imagine the Curly Wurly of Somerdale Pavilion parkrun to be, only with possibly better visibility for this weekend at least. Then there is a brief contraflow as you head back out again. Like this:\n\n.\n\n.\n\nDid you spot what I did there, I know, sneaky. parkrun pranking you, but you were too smart for me I bet…\n\nI was lapped by some I knew and some I knew friends of friends of. ‘Dolly or Bev’ SURPRISE, I was late with my ‘arbitrary’ which was ironic, as this was after all my very much arbitrary parkrun number, I should have been more on it. Oh well, good to have parkrun friends with me now… I’ll nail it one day.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nI was slowing for the third lap, and ended up with one of the tailwalkers keeping me company. I learned a bit more about the space. Turns out, this used to be football pitches, but just kept flooding massively, so the powers that be gave up trying to hold back the tide and rather embraced it. Now there is a lake and a fenced platform that seems to be quite a distance from it is actually perfectly placed for when it rains as the water level really does come up that high. This means the green space provides excellent habitat, and presumably is protected by dint of the water levels, from being built on, hurrah. Green spaces are at such a premium in urban environments, and this one is a corker.\n\nRound we went. I learned that just at the start of the cherry blossom avenue is a marshal spot where often a tambourine is flourished with aplomb. Today the aplomb was clapping themed, but none the worse for that. About half way round the final lap, my parkrun companions came back to join me for some of the route. We admired the sights together. The tail walker collected cones in our wake. All good.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAs we just came round in sight of the final corner lined with tree stumps towards the finish a volunteer was already removing cones ahead of us. This did make my heart sink somewhat, not gonna lie. They were cheery enough calling out ‘I just got impatient and I’m on course close down so thought I’d start’. I get that, I really do, but I hadn’t finished so… I totally understand it’s not meant to make you feel unwelcome as a walker, but it did make me cringe, . It’s like a fairy dying every time you say ‘I don’t believe in fairies’ except that fairies aren’t real so they can’t die. However, I am very real, an every time I see a course being closed down ahead of me or finish funnel packed away before I’ve been through my parkrun heart breaks a little. Since becoming a parkwalker rather than parkrunner I’ve had a quiet weep on the way back from rather too many parkruns. I hate being the one people got frustrated waiting for but it’s confusing too, are walkers welcome or not. Overall, this was a very welcoming and lovely parkrun, but it made me feel incredibly awkward that a volunteer had felt I took took too long. It feeds my insecurity, I feel I take too long too, but I can’t help it, and I need my parkruns too, maybe more than many of the parkrunners who are able to run in other contexts. It is a battle with myself to go to parkruns these days, I am never confident of whether a particular parkrun will welcome me or not. Never mind, I would have 48,599 people running past me tmrw, I’d focus on that, and up until this point I’d felt ok about being slow. I think people who are fast literally cannot comprehend how long it takes to walk if you have a disability or health issue or are just really unfit. Even when I ran some people would routinely comment on social media that anyone can walk 5k in such and such a time which wasn’t too far off my run time. Well maybe a young fit male could, but that’s only a small cohort of parkrunners. Reference early comments about having a fastest 500 finish times, it all feeds into the same narrative of slower participants not being as important as speedier ones. I don’t think parkrun means to do this, but there is work to be done for it to be truly inclusive in my opinion. Oh well. It is still a lovely parkrun, and I did walk it, and I was made welcome, just a blip…\n\n.\n\n.\n\nSoon the finish funnel appeared, and aren’t they lovely. And yes, I would have finished more quickly had I not paused to take photos but see above, I paused to take photos because I can’t walk continuously. It was lovely to see the whole funnel up, ready and waiting. I crossed the line and entered the funnel was processed and timed in, and scanned and surrendered my token, with the tailwalkers just behind as is the parkrun way. Then the volunteers set about results processing and finishing off the close down, and there were purposeful huddles and important looking cone wrangling going on. Hurrah for high vis heroes. We said our thank yous and goodbyes and left the team to their parkrun purposefulness. It is always remarkable to see how events come together, work their magic and then disappear into the non parkrun universe until parkrunday comes around once again.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThere is a cafe on site, we availed ourselves of this for coffee. The food options are limited, and non existent for vegans, but super friendly, and the coffee I thought was good. Nice to have a brief parkfaff. Hurrah!\n\n.\n\n.\n\nand then, once again, time to depart. Bye bye Sutcliffe parkrun, thank you for the warm welcome to your gorgeous park. Thanks especially to whosoever it was who stuck all those individual pink blossoms to the each and every tree down the central avenue to create an extra special ambience. Your efforts were – indeed still are – very much appreciated. Totes loving your work!\n\n.\n\n.\n\nSo you see, tu tu to ta dah indeed, just like I promised! Three hundred parkruns done, tick.\n\nJust in case you were there, and you missed them, photos from today can be found on this google drive link, but only for a week more, then I’ll delete it because my cloud will burst otherwise, but if you want to keep any, you can download yourself. Go wild! But expect to find it pretty empty by the middle of May, you have been warned 🙂 https://photos.app.goo.gl/EeGghfFjorjkEM7FA\n\nOh you want to know how it went with the procession the next day? Pretty good to be fair. I reckon that I got the waving bit totally nailed, and although I didn’t actually count everyone who passed, it was on the news with 48,599 people along the route – more if you count the marshals and escorts, so I’ll take that. I feel we maintained more enthusiasm and channeled more joy than the actual royals who frankly are looking somewhat stiff and lacking animation, no such half hearted measures on our part. We set out our pitch outside the house I was being hosted in, and then just stayed there all morning whilst people jigalonged by, hurrah!\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThanks to all who came on by. Awesome to see you all, each and every one!\n\n.\n\nAnd this woman was extra sensational, Go Hassan Go! Feeling the fear and doing it anyway, totally smashed it. I like to think my rattle spinning and enthusiasm helped a lot! Amazing females indeed. Thanks for coming by, appreciated. 😉\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThanks to the 227 fellow parkrunners and 27 high vis heroes who joined me for my 300th parkrun. I reckon we all jigalonged our tree identical labs very expertly. Thanks too to the 48 thousand 599 passers by who took the trouble to run by me on the Sunday, honestly, you made it pretty special. Yay for the running community who made it so. You are all stars to me.\n\nThat’s all for now, but as always, you can browse through all my parkrun related posts here. Or not. It’s up to you. You’ll need to scroll down for older entries though. And don’t forget to check out the pics if you joined the field at Sutcliffe parkrun on tu tu day, you never know, this could be your dream parkrun photo, best of all time. To be fair, that’s pretty unlikely, but you never do quite know. Good luck! Time is ticking though, those pics won’t be there for long… Do what you must.\n\nOh, but this is cool!! A timely reminder to get yourself on a volunteer roster near you in time for next parkrunday. Go awn, go awn, you know you want to! I mean not necessarily trentham gardens, lovely as that is, you could opt in to your nearest and dearest.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nI don’t care if it’s a cliché, this was a banger of a parkrun!\n\nThere was always a slight worry in my mind that the launch of this event might for me be an anti climax. No reflection on my confidence in the team at Buxton, more a worry that a near lifetime of waiting for this moment would have a hard job living up to my hopes if not expectations. Was the launch of Pavilion Gardens parkrun at Buxton to be like the grand finale for the firework display that fails to ignite? Would I rock(et) up, only to plod round a proverbial damp squib of an event, questioning my life choices, indeed the whole trajectory of my cultural interests from childhood, or would I experience a cracker of an event. Dear reader, I need not have worried, for I can truthfully report that there was no misfiring here, rather, this was more like the firework display that set off everything at once. You know, like the Big Bay Boom 2012 in case you are wondering. It was glorious, although over before you knew it. Except not really, because rumour has it, it’ll be happening all over again next Saturday, and the Saturday after that, forever and ever. Free, weekly timed, parkrun free, for everyone, forever. Barring global meltdown which obvs. is a terrifying reality, but on balance unlikely to prevent Pavilion Gardens parkrun from happening next week. Check before heading off though. If you see nothing but burnt landscapes and smokey orange skies, and hear nothing but radioactive ash softly falling from the sky then probably best to stay local, and if you are stuck on the roof due to flooding, that could be a challenge too, unless you are on the banks of the River Wye which goes through the Pavilion Gardens, so maybe you could take a dinghy down and offer to help with the course set up just in case the regular volunteers might not have been able to make it down. It would be the right thing to do. Anyway, that’s the future, let’s focus on this firecracker of a day. There’s plenty of opportunity to dwell on the end of the world and other fundamental existential crises another time. Let’s think about Buxton instead. The Pavilion Gardens are properly lovely, even without a parkrun, but obvs way way better now that they have that too!\n\n.\n\n.\n\nProperly lovely, but also really hard to capture in a photo. Still, it’s the thought that counts, and anyways, it’s much better if you just go and check it all out for yourself.\n\nI had been waiting for this day for over fifty years. No really I had. I mean, granted, for eons this was at a subconscious level. I probably didn’t quite understand how influential that particular moment in time was as it happened, but it’s funny how sometimes we are able to pinpoint a moment where our lives were set off on a particular trajectory, and all that unfollowed subsequently was a consequence of this. That’s the thing about hindsight though, you can’t always tell until later on, when you suddenly see a pattern as you trace backwards from a particular destination. Just ask Shrek, that’s why giving one day away that he couldn’t even remember turned out to be a terrible idea, the day he was born offered up, he actually ceased to exist. Only, spoiler alert, he didn’t because there was some get out cause or other. Are you following? The point I’m trying to make, is that for me Buxton has always had a particular resonance, it’s just I didn’t know that it’s true power and influence would only become fully apparent as the parkrun planets aligned to deliver a new and shiny Pavilion Gardens parkrun in Buxton this weekend, and now, finally, and perhaps belatedly, my life experiences suddenly seem to make sense. Hurrah!\n\nChildhood experiences can enter your DNA. In my case – and I do concede this might be considered to be somewhat niche – I really, really remember going to see ‘Dougal and the Blue Cat‘ when I was really tiny. About seven or so, when the film came out. My dad took me, taking me to see a film wasn’t something I remember him ever doing before or since, but I do remember this trip, and this film, because it properly blue blew my impressionable mind. So much so, that I even had the vinyl record which I played endlessly on a loop for months afterwards. I have no idea what happened to the original record, perhaps it was too much of a torment for others in the house, because at some point it disappeared. For me though, the story and the drama was amazing. One key character in it, was the villainous Blue Cat, who at the pinnacle of seizing power and exercising tyranny over the magic roundabout populace sung a terrifying number about becoming ‘King Buxton The First!’ If you want to know how people end up joining cults, you should watch this film. The irresistible draw of a strong leader is as horrifying as it is compelling. We should thank the world that ultimately the Blue Cat sees the errors of this ways and eventually appeals to those around him ‘I was a victim of a false doctrine, I am now changed. May I be your friend? Your true friend?’ All’s well that ends well eh?\n\n.\n\n.\n\nBuxton sounded to me like the most extraordinary of names. What brave new world was this? Any place so named must be equally extraordinary, a place of wonder indeed. From that moment on, I was surely destined to one day find the actual Buxton and experience it for myself. Of course way back in the day I had no idea what lay ahead half a century in the future but I do now know that the lure of the new Pavilion Gardens parkrun for me is /was very much based to no small degree on the Buxton location. A place of wonder and mystery. Not least, because the first time I went to visit it, heading out on a lovely sunny day from Sheffield, I arrived to find it blanketed in deep mist, it was like trying to enter Brigadoon, a place with literally as well as metaphorically hidden wonders, its very own micro-climate and no doubt it’s own cultural peculiarities, all the best places have them. As of this weekend though, The Pavilion Gardens in particular and Buxton in general now have their very own splendid parkrun, its wondrous work is done, it has reached the pinnacle of all that is possible in parkrun terms (well it will, as soon as a junior parkrun is started up as well, but I have patience, I will wait it out).\n\nIt wasn’t just me though, waiting for Buxton to deliver its parkrun. This event seems to have been many years in the gestation. I’ve heard whispers of it starting up ever since I relocated to Sheffield, rumours floating by on the breezes as you take part at Bakewell/ Monsal Trail parkrun, stories of a mythical parkrun location waiting in the wings somewhere in the region. If I remember correctly, which granted is highly unlikely, it was first mooted some time before the lockdown. And even got quite far in the planning. A local running club was in the habit of holding a 5k event in the Pavilion Gardens on a monthly basis anyway, so there was already the enthusiasm and support for a weekly event. It was pretty much on the horizon and then BOOM, lock down. No parkruns anywhere. Only notparkruns which are all well and good, but hardly the same thing. Kudos to those that kept them up though. However, all was not lost, it seems that there is a Venn diagram where characteristics of the Pavilion Gardens parkrun start up team and the tammar Wallaby overlap because – you’ve guessed it, both have the ability to diapause! I know, handy. That is, at the risk of stating the obvious, to extend gestation periods by putting everything on pause until it’s safe to launch new life into the world. Clever eh? So post lockdown, in May this year, things started hotting up, an appeal went out, and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\n.\n\nFast forward to this weekend, and takeover event at Monsal Trail done, trail event done (in torrential rain apparently, but we’ll close over that) and finally inaugural day dawned, and what a cracker of an event it turned out to be.\n\nCan I just say, bit defensively, I hadn’t intended to go to the inaugural, although it’s not a rule as such, it’s considered better etiquette to wait for events to settle in a bit before rocking up to avoid overwhelming them, unless it is actually your local. I’d spotted the takeover at Monsal Trail and assumed they’d start the following week, not taking into account the trial event, so thought I’d be rocking up at week 2. Oh well, seems it was the worst kept secret ever anyway, and as it’s my nendy – or was (nearest event not yet done/ not done yet) and feels local because I did so much of my London Marathon training on the Monsal Trail which is out in that direction from Sheffield. I wondered if I should do a blog post about this first event because of that breach of protocol and then I thought: a) who am I trying to kid, since you dear reader are pretty much my only dedicated follower, with respect, my attendance is hardly going to create a tidal wave of parkrun inaugural chasers who now feel emboldened by my behaviour to go storming round new first events in my wake. If only I had that degree of influence I’d use it to promote world peace and get them to make an apricot coloured thermal parkrun mug. Why isn’t that a thing yet? Makes no sense at all. And b) well I did go, so bit hypocritical to pretend otherwise, and it would seem a shame not to capture impressions of the first event. So sorry, not sorry. Well a bit sorry, but not so sorry that once I’d realised it would be the inaugural I changed all my plans. I’ll try not to do it again.\n\nWhere was I, oh yes, fantasising about one day attending a parkrun at Buxton, hopefully in the presence of a multitude of fancy dress blue cats – or better yet REAL ones. As it was, although there were many fun guys out and about, it was inexplicably a bit thin on the cobalt cat front.\n\nI pulled up the info on the website the day before, just to check details. The official blah de blah for Pavilion Gardens parkrun describes the course thus:\n\nCourse Description\n\nThree laps on permanent paths round the Pavilion Gardens, starting and finishing on Broad Walk.\n\nUnfortunately dogs are not allowed at this event.\n\nFacilities\n\nToilets at the car park, swimming pool and by the boating lake. Park amenities include children’s play areas, an outdoor gym, a swimming pool, indoor gym, cafe and many other seasonal attractions.\n\nLocation of start\n\nThe event starts on Broad Walk. The Pavilion Gardens lie adjacent to the A53 St John’s Road. The nearest postcode to the start is on Burlington Road – SK17 9AL\n\nParking is free on Burlington Road, Hartington Road and surrounding streets. The Pavilion Gardens has a pay and display car park off Burlington Road (SK17 9AR) and there is further paid parking by the Old Hall Hotel.\n\nPost Run Coffee\n\nEvery week we grab a post parkrun coffee at Pavilion Gardens Café – please come and join us!\n\nfair enough.\n\nAnd it looks like this:\n\n.\n\n.\n\nJust look at all those exciting things! A miniature railway is always a win, an actual river running through and an actual opera house with a dome and everything, that’s pretty special. I like to think of myself as somewhat of a sponsor of the arts. I recently loaned a Pyrex bowl to the Sheffield Theatres for use in their production of On the Beach, one of two linked plays that together make up The Contingency Plan. They were very good, but not gonna lie, without my last minute contribution they’d probably have had to pull the whole show. As it was, my Pyrex did great. Pyrex is on a bit of a roll at the moment, getting mentions in reviews all over the place,, well Keswick anyway. Never underestimate the importance of your bakeware, it could yet become more famous than you are. Just saying.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nI’m enjoying having closer links to the Sheffield Theatres now I am a theatrical landlady. I’ve bought a hat and feather boa especially so I can look the part when answering the door to my ever changing cycle of lodgers. On the whole it’s been great hosting people, I’ve only had one bad experience with an arrival who revealed themselves to be an absolutely freak of nature by declaring they don’t drink tea – or indeed any hot drinks! Not even Yorkshire Tea! I know! I was reeling. How I managed to keep my composure whilst inwardly processing the enormity of this disclosure I have no idea, but we did somehow muddle through our time together. It’s so important to be accepting and non judgemental in the capacity of host, and being exposed to different ways of doing and being is probably a good thing. It’s all about inclusion and community at the end of the day, just like parkrun. Inclusion and acceptance makes the world a better place, and anyway, if they won’t drink tea, all the more for me! Everyone’s a winner! Mrs Doyle would have had an actual melt down though. Fact.\n\nAnyway, stop distracting me by asking me about my claims to fame, many and manifest though they may be, where was I? Oh, yes, parkrun weekend. It really was a cracker! An absolute blast. There were a few historical parkrun things coinciding this Guy Fawkes Saturday. There was the registering of the 8 millionth parkrun barcode. Oh my, how amazing it would be to get that number, I do hope it’s someone who actually completes a parkrun:\n\n.\n\nThen there was the massive influx of parkrunners to Gunpowder parkrun because if it was ever on your hit list, what better day to take part in it than on the one time November 5th falls on a Saturday. This won’t happen again until 2033 I think, assuming my google search was correct, so next time that comes around I’ll be nearly 70, I wonder if I’ll still be alive then and if I am if I’ll be doing parkrun and if I am doing that if Gunpowder will still be a thing. I guess if I can wait 50 years to do a parkrun at Buxton I can wait 11 to get to Gunpowder on Guy Fawkes day. Anyway, Gunpowder parkrun had not only triple their usual number of parkrunners, but three lots of run report one, two, three – as a poem, to mark the occasion. Yes, all excellent, but best thing about it was this fancy dress offering! I wonder what bright spark came up with the idea, nailed it though.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nas if this wasn’t enough, there was the Walk with Joe thingy kicking off too. Maidenhead parkrun having a whopping 77 volunteers and 965 parkrunners, wowsers! That’s insane! Check out the stage and sound system though, that’s one way to get yourself heard during the run briefing!\n\n.\n\n.\n\nand it’s lovely that there were all these things happening in the parkrun world. However, maybe they were just trying a bit too hard. The real magic happens at the birth of a new parkrun, and it was Pavilion Gardens parkrun that stole the heart of all of us that were there, no regrets about missing Joe at Maidenhead parkrun, or joining the firework display at Gunpowder parkrun – maybe a slight stab of jealousy at not getting the 8,000,000 number on my barcode, but then if I had, I’ve have missed out on all my previous parkrun adventures to date, and that seems way too high a price to pay. Nope, Buxton Bound, and Garden Pavilion parkrun it would be, huzzah! Whatever that actually means, it sounds suitably theatrical and as an excitement generating exclamation seems most apt for the day.\n\nSo here are my PG tips – with thanks to Team Burrelli for making this awesome connection! Genius at work there. 🙂 I am shameless in borrowing from him, it’s not plagiarism when acknowledged, rather it’s a compliment… Bravo Burrelli!\n\n.\n\nWell it might be more stream of consciousness rambling, than concise tips, but hey ho, you get the gist.\n\nBuxton is pretty local to me really, though I’ve rarely been. It’s not too far from Sheffield which is a boon as my health is compromising what I can do at the minute, long drives are really painful, and I’m really not great at the minute. parkrun tonic was very much needed. It wasn’t too early a start, and I’m pleased to report, that after the biblical rain of last weekend, this Saturday was damp yes, but not to an apocalyptic extent, so that was good. The drive over was actually lovely, gorgeous autumn colours of bronze and gold, and the light caught the brown bracken and it looked spectacular. The grey and cloudy sky set off some of the rock formation of the edges as I drove through, and it was all generally splendid. a good start.\n\nThe Pavilion Gardens parkrun website postcode satnav took me straight to the edge of the park. You drive through a pretty residential area of gorgeous stone buildings, and I saw some parkrunners (presumably) jogging in the direction I was travelling, it was great to behold. All that anticipatory excitement as people started to descend on the venue. The road alongside the gardens was fairly full of parked vehicles of the early arrivals. Parking there is free and there is no reason not to park there, but for me it made more sense to go the pay and display carpark. There was loads of parking, and whilst there is a charge, it’s free for blue badge holders and quite possibly reformed blue cats too, and I don’t begrudge paying for facilities I use at a parkrun location. You are right next to well maintained loos, the main entrance of the park, and straight off get a view of the amazing domed Buxton Opera House or whatever it’s called. Few things I noticed, wow they like their signs! I have never seen so many different signs explaining confusingly how to pay for parking and insisting that you absolutely must. The modern multi-storey car park and associated leisure centre is juxtaposed beside the lovely Victorian garden railings and building. It’s just a bit weird, not bad as such, but striking. There is good signage for the park, but that sign could do with a bit of a wipe. The car park was full with confused looking new arrivals, seeking loos or heading off for a quick warm up lap of the gardens. There were already some directional arrows up, and there was no doubt you are in the right place. Hurrah! Red Ted found a sign that would dictate our speed around the course for today, so that was fine. I do think you are winning at life if you find your colour scheme matches that of the instructional signage at your chosen event.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nSo once I’d finished inputting all the signs into my i-spy book of car park accessories, I headed off into the Pavilion Gardens. Dear Reader, they are a delight. Mature planting, little bridges over the river, fountains, a miniature railway, little water falls up and over bits and down under bits. Sort of like a miniaturised Huddersfield parkrun in places in that respect. And ducks, and you must now by now that I do luvva duck!\n\n.\n\n.\n\nGorgeous mature trees, and there, in the distance, and on the horizon the vision of loveliness which is the sight of a gathering of parkrunners and the associated high vis heores resplendent in their new shiny high viz. The parkrun flag was a flying and all was well in the parkrun world. By the way, my camera has pretty much gone down the quiet quitting route. It goes through the motions, but it’s pictures are basically terrible, so I’ve freely borrowed from the Pavilion Gardens parkrun photo pool on flickr and done a bit of googling for other images too. Thanks to all that have let me use their pics, I tried to ask permission where I could, apologies if I’ve missed anyone. Happy to remove pics on request if required. You can easily spot which are my photos as they are the ones with the dodgy composition and lighting, just remember dear reader, it is the thought that counts. The Pavilion Gardens parkrun Facebook page is just going live as I type, so maybe some more pics will turn up there too. Go check it out, give it a like and see what lands. That’s what I’m going to do 🙂\n\n.\n\n.\n\nIt gets me every time. That assembling of a parkrun community, coming together to propagate fun times. There was a good natured buzz. I saw some familiar faces in the throng. The famous ‘We Love park run’ Cassells couple who have amazing paired customised t-shirts that, together with their prolific touristing (372 different events and counting, and more if you count discontinued events which you really should) has made them parkrun legends. There were Barnsley Harriers present, I like them, they are officially lovely – met some at The Trunce years ago, and noticed how they looked out for one another. Familiar face from Glossop parkrun also way back in the olden days before Covid and Zoom were actual things; and did I espy Buxton runners aplenty, with familiar faces from fell races past, all of which I was final finisher in, but with style.\n\nI always have a wave of paranoia before entering a pre-event fold, but it was all good humoured enough. There were some extra awesome bits about this start line though.\n\nThe way the Gardens are designed there are actual houses right on the start line. Not near the start, but literally people breakfasting in their front rooms were serenaded by the merry chatter of excited parkrunners gathered together. I hope they like parkrun. To my extreme delight, there is an actual guest house just metres from the start line, I don’t imagine there is a parkrun anywhere in the world where you could stay any closer. The location was nearer the start than the finish line. If you are a tourist check out Roseleigh Guest House, Buxton overlooking the lake and set within the Pavilion Gardens. That would be properly awesome! The view from the dining room looks across where parkrunners set off. So that sight would either ruin the view or make it, depending on your parkrun passions.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nOf course, if you are a proper parkrun passionista, you can do better than an over night stay. There was/is a flat for sale that’s even closer to the start line if that’s possible to believe, in the adjacent property. What’s more – and this is parkrun gold – the estate agency marketing the property is Wright Marshall. I know, what could possibly be more apt! Hang on, let me go look at right move details. So, it’s a snip at £400,000 and from there you can see the whole parkrun route pretty much, it’s a shame parkrun marshals can’t collect any financial contributions, or they could have a whip round for the event director to live there with selected members of the core team, tied accommodation like the residents of Number Ten only with more integrity. Wouldn’t that be splendid? Rhetorical question, yes it would! It’s already 4 bedrooms, and the rooms look huge so you could always cosy up. Squidging up would be perfect, room for all at a parkrun, inclusion is everything remember.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nnice, isn’t it. And here are the properties significantly improved by the addition of perky parkrnners:\n\n.\n\n.\n\nand frankly, who wouldn’t want to cosy up with these latest members of the parkrun family. Don’t they look lovely and cuddlesome (get permission first) and welcoming, all get set and ready to go on the morning of their inaugural, the calm before the storm. I’m not sure what was in the Waitrose bag. If it was me doing the RD stint on an occasion such as this I’d probably bring a paper bag to breathe into, but a plastic bag with some emergency snacks is still a good shout. Check out the attaché case with parkrun essentials, and gaze in delight at the new powder blue high vis for the park walkers, now a staple part of all parkruns. Hurrah!\n\n.\n\n.\n\nLovely pic! Oh, and wait, incoming photos alert, turns out Frank Golden Sports Photos was covering the event, there could be a LOT of photos to capture the occasion, that’s great obvs, but how to choose? Have a gander here, and ooh and aah and marvel at the spectacle unfolding before you. Relive it if you were there, and feel like you were there if you weren’t. Everyone’s a winner, all eventualities well and truly catered for!\n\n.\n\nRight, where was I? Oh, are you still here? Thanks for sticking with me, I appreciate I’m not really concise dear reader, but then again, reading is not compulsory. You can always just scroll down to look at the pictures, that’s probably what I’d do to be fair. Yet, I like the idea of recording here my experiences of the day, it sort of helps to cement the memories, and who knows, maybe one day I’ll look back on it all once again and wish I’d done a crowdfunder for that lovely flat. Still, life is too short for regrets, let’s not dwell on that, let’s crack on instead. We are all fired up at arriving at the start and seeing those houses right on the start line.\n\nThere was quite a buzz from the assembled gathering. As I approached, I saw some of the marshals leave their huddle and go marching off to their spots. I wonder how they were feeling. Personally I sometimes get confused between terror and excitement. There shouldn’t be anything to worry about at a parkrun, but there must have been that collective willing it all to go well. Loads of us were snapping photos to try to capture it all. Some with more success than others it has to be said. Yep, I’m not proud of my offerings, but they are the best I’ve got. Lucky I used my resource gathering skills to find some better ones. Have a browse, see if you can spot anyone you know.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAfter deployment of the marshals, there was a shout out for the first timers’ welcome. Strictly speaking this was everyone, though some possibly had done the trial event and/or previous 5k runs in the gardens. A semi circle gathered around the inaugural welcome. It was thorough, going over the course as well as parkrun protocols. Pleasingly, there were 19 brand new parkrunners. Yep, that’s right, people doing their first ever, ever, ever parkrun. What a one to choose. I hope it will be but the first of many. The gathering for this was respectful and quiet. The natural bank created a bit of an amphitheatre, and strategic use of the loudhailer helped get people’s attention, so that was good.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThen there was a bit more faffing and chatting and warming up, and catching up and a growing sense of anticipation. The RD then started to address the gathering. Depressingly, there was not a respectful silence for this. At first, I think some people genuinely didn’t realise they had started their welcome, but even after a bit of shushing from others a few just continued noisily chatting away with complete disregard for the host team, other parkrunners and the significance of it being an inaugural event. I found that hugely disappointing. I tried to tell myself maybe that discourteous few had other issues going on and it wasn’t necessarily just that they were all total bell ends. That’s possible I suppose. Also, and this is important, you can’t always change a situation, but you can choose how to react to it. This is why I nearly spat out my tea (and we’ve already established how sacred a mug of tea can be) when this email popped into my inbox the other week…\n\n.\n\n.\n\nHilarious! Laugh? I thought my knickers would never dry! I was sort of hoping this was someone quiet quitting their job, but it seems algorithms suggest alternatives, even so, a packer could override a technical glitch if it pleased them. Anyway, properly funny. I don’t even have a cat, and since I’m vegetarian wouldn’t even turn to the cat food in an emergency either. Expensive though isn’t it, cat food? Makes me feel better about the amount I spend on bird and squirrel stuff. Oooh, shall we have some gratuitous squirrel pics? It’s been a while. Hang on:\n\n.\n\n.\n\nDespite the best efforts of those who noisily talked over the entire run briefing, the RD did a great job thanking those involved in getting the parkrun set up, clapping volunteers and going through the basics too. No dogs for example at this parkrun. It’s a three lapper, tarmac, but with autumn leaves making it slippery in places. It was a great way to start things off.\n\nThen the event ambassador gave a wave and stepped up to add her thanks to today’s RD especially who seems to have been a tour de force in making it so. There was lots of appreciative clapping and all was good in the world. Hurrah!\n\n.\n\n.\n\nand then, finally, the moment we’d all been waiting for. Go!\n\n.\n\n.\n\nBe thankful dear reader for a proper photographer being on hand to capture these moments in time. Great shots aren’t they? Rhetorical question, yes they are! I’m always in awe of the courage of photographers who get these centre front photos, they must be pretty nippy on their feet too, to avoid being trampled into the tarmac. Has to be quite an adrenalin rush being in the path of such a force of parkrun power.\n\nI hope you enjoyed these start photos, because my shots en route are erm, well, how can I put it? Sub optimum? They say it’s the thought that counts though, and as a parkwalker these days, I did try to take some mid parkrun shots, though my camera just isn’t coping, I might have to abandon attempting this in future. For now though, albeit mu camera seems to be in its death throes, I will reveal a few of the least terrible taken today, a last gasp of usefulness before inevitable retirement perhaps.\n\nOff everyone went. Some with a bit more of a bounce than others! I tucked in pretty near the back. I felt quite perky to begin with, aiming to stay ahead of the tail, maybe buddy up with the parkwalkers. Didn’t happen. As is always the way, early optimism gave way to pretty high pain levels. It feels unfair. I can potter around pretty well at the moment, and it makes me wonder if I’m imagining my disability, or if it’s more to do with general unfitness and loss of condition from being so very ill last year. However, once again a few hundred metres into parkrun and my leg has turned to lead, except lead that experiences pain and pins and needles and just like it’s not my own. With one leg doing that and my other foot refusing to weight bare it’s a grim experience. I could feel myself getting slower and slower. It was hard not to feel miserable about it. I guess it is what it is, and just as it’s best to just laugh if you get cat food instead of bin liners in your grocery shop I tried to see the silver lining of my slow pace and needing to keep stopping as an opportunity to interact with the volunteers a bit more and take some pictures.\n\nVolunteers are properly lovely though aren’t they? This is a three lap course so you get to enjoy them three times, AND you get to pass the finish twice too. That means as a slower participant there is lots of support and lots of interest. Faster runners come and lap you, but then you get the sense of still being amongst a field of participants instead of just crawling in on your own for the whole of the event. I love that you pass the finish so see faster runners sprinting in. The three laps give you a chance to appreciate the gardens too. It was looking gorgeous. Apparently last week was torrential rain, but astonishingly it stayed dry today. The leaves were slippery but covered the paths with autumn bronze and gold. You get to see the Victorian buildings inside and outside the park. Other users were sat on benches taking it all in, or walking dogs, it all seemed pretty good natured. I’m coming round to multi lap courses as they are highly social, and as a walker I think less lonely than my previously favoured single lap routes. I am the slowest participant by a country mile though, and that’s hard. I wonder if this is it for me now, I hope not. I can cope with never being fast – I never was before, but I’d love to just blend in at a parkrun, not carry the worry of being a burden to an event, and sometimes just to do it in my own way and own time. It’s hard not to feel pressure to speed up at the back, not at this event from the tail, but I’ve had a string of poor experiences that has weakened my resolve. Still, this week was fine and dandy, thank you for asking. I offer up my en route photographic efforts by way of evidence of parkrun camaraderie and cheer. The fact they are terrible should simply encourage you to go check it all out for yourself, it’s the only way to fully appreciate it!\n\n.\n\n.\n\nfortunately, I wasn’t the only one taking photos!\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAfter the first lap or so, one of the tail walkers came to keep me company which was appreciated. We chatted running stories and compared injuries, and I got a bit more background to the event. Oh, and I found out that one of the other tail walkers knows my next door neighbour so that was exciting. Small world and all that. As we finished the second lap, there were a lot of people milling around the finish, and I really appreciated someone shouting out to people to keep the course clear for those of us still limping round. It’s a little thing, but it makes a huge difference, and people were happy to shifty, thanks to those that did. Great finish funnel location. If you’d rather live at the finish line than the start, check out Derby House Buxton. As elegant and contemporary as Garden Pavilion parkrun itself!\n\n.\n\n.\n\nDerby House used to be a residential care home. There is still another care home along the Broad Walk, you pass it three times so the residents can in theory see you from the windows as you pass. I wonder/hope in time that residents might be encouraged to come along and enjoy watching the runners, maybe even get involved as volunteers. That’s how my mum got adopted by Bushy parkrun after all.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nI still feel quite emotional and choked up about that how that all unfolded. It made such a difference to my mum and me for her to be properly part of the parkrun family, even more so at such an iconic destination. Sigh. I’d love for others to experience that too. If only for the enrichment of seeing it unfold outside. There is a parkrun somewhere where the person who is behind the Walking at parkrun Facebook page proactively built a relationship with the care home on the course route for his home parkrun. The residents apparently get involved every week as marshals and supporters alongside carers. I’d love to visit that parkrun one day. Note to self, I need to find out where it is.\n\nMeanwhile, I was walking round with the tailwalker, walking and talking which is how it should be.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nWell, it’s how it should be if you are walking it. If you are fleeter of foot, you may be flying round, and if you are really lucky, there will be a volunteer photographer on hand to capture your running prowess in perpetuity. Immortalised with flying feet. There were an astonishing amount of airborne participants today, superb photos, here are just some. Gaze on in wonder. These days I’d only get flying feet if dangling my legs whilst perched on a slightly too high bench, but it doesn’t mean I can’t appreciate the light footedness of others! Mind you, I can’t help thinking so many were suspended in the air, one strong gust of wind and they’d have all ended up in the lake but mercifully that did not come to pass. Just as well, not sure it would have been covered in the standard risk assessments for a new parkrun. Or maybe it was? They seemed to have got most of the details spot on.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nWith the walking and talking, the final lap went quickly, even though I wondered if we had it pretty much to ourselves. I was grateful to find as I neared the finish funnel that it was still up and attended in all it’s glory, so I mustered a sort of sprint finish. I say sprint finish, but wait, no, I mean a shuffle finish! But finish I did. A tantalising 2 seconds off my final parkrun bingo number. Oh well. I’m beginning to think that challenge will forever elude me. Token scanned, and bucketed, and that was that.\n\nThe volunteer team busied themselves with course close down, and uploading of results.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThere didn’t seem to be any actual participants still around, I presume they’d scattered to the nearest café. I had planned on joining the post parkrun faffing but I wasn’t sure where the café was and felt suddenly awkward if I’m honest, and I was in quite a lot of pain too to be honest so decided maybe best to get off, but took a bit of meander through the gardens as I departed. There is much to see and appreciate. Well worth allowing a bit of extra time for.\n\nAs I left, I paused at the commemorative pebbles sunk into cement as a tribute to the NHS and other key workers during the pandemic. It was a curious sort of memorial, and quite touching in a way. I don’t know why Dr Who Tom Baker era featured, but why not. Then I checked out the amazing wooden tree carving and tried to find the goose with a wonky wing. Like I said, plenty to do even without a post parkrun breakfast stop.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nand that was pretty much that. Oh, but in case you are interested in the details, and why wouldn’t you be? The auto generated summary run report from the parkrun wiki journo report tells us that at Pavilion Gardens parkrun, Event number 1 on 5th November 2022:\n\n278 people ran, jogged and walked the course, of whom 275 were first timers and 0 recorded new Personal Bests. Representatives of 56 different clubs took part.\n\nThe event was made possible by 31 extraordinarily photogenic volunteers:\n\nKaren WEIR • Beverley ALI • Robert WHITE • Paul MARKALL • Jane POULTER • Frank GOLDEN • Peter BAILEY • Sheila BRADLEY • Rachel DOWLE • Chris HALLWORTH • Mark WHELAN • Elizabeth NOCTON • Jocelyn GRANGER • Stefan LEDIN • Kate LEDIN • Katie ROLFE • Joanne CUDAHY • Tim ROLFE • Jessica MURRAY • Justin HOLMES • Rebecca DAY • Gill THOMPSON • Diane BARKER • Nichola SARGEANT • Rob MCNEIL • Zoe HEMMINGWAY • Colin BALDWIN • Kristian WHITE • Beth WHITE • Jenny BIRCHETT • Ian DALTON\n\nToday’s full results and a complete event history can be found on the Pavilion Gardens parkrun Results Page.\n\nThe female record is held by Sophie WOOD who recorded a time of 17:56 on 5th November 2022 (event number 1).\n\nThe male record is held by Caleb WINFIELD who recorded a time of 16:36 on 5th November 2022 (event number 1).\n\nThe Age Grade course record is held by Pat GOODALL who recorded 83.97% (25:16) on 5th November 2022 (event number 1).\n\nPavilion Gardens parkrun started on 5th November 2022. Since then 276 participants have completed 278 parkruns covering a total distance of 1,390 km, including 0 new Personal Bests. A total of 31 individuals have volunteered 31 times. Good to know.\n\nThey could have added, that the runniest runners were: Robert Andrew Jones (499); Lynn Newman (489); John Cassells (443); Joanna Cassells (440); Kate Adkins (418) and Paul Amro Robison (391). You’ve got to admit, that is a great deal of parkrunning around!\n\nand the average age was 45 for both men and women, which is cool, though makes me feel old as well as slow.\n\nI love how for this very first event you get a total distance of 1,390 km, that’s a loooooooooooooooooooong way. Almost 864 miles in old money. When you consider the first ever parkrun was the Bushy Park Time Trial and that had just the thirteen parkrun pioneers and now we have hundreds here at Buxton. It’s astonishing.\n\nThere was one Cath(erine) Saunders wheeling round, three actual dragons providing the fire and great guys marshalling and time keeping and doing all the things to ensure a sparkling event was enjoyed by all.\n\nThe guys did grand!\n\nBefore I go though, can we have a special shout out to those who made the extra effort to have some November 5th themed active wear. Your efforts were noted and appreciated. Yay you! You all know who you are.\n\nAnd of course I particularly love those people who see the photographer and become joy manifest. This is type one fun, fun in the moment, none of this ‘I’ll only enjoy it when it’s over’ nonsense, oh no sorreee, parkrun fun at it’s best. #loveparkrun So many happy smiley people! This lot were certainly giving Pavilion Gardens parkrun the literal as well as figurative thumbs up. Smiles all round, and one or two caught with slightly panicked mid-scream expressions, but we get the idea, and it’s fabulous!\n\n.\n\n.\n\nOh, and for those of you who like to triangulate your event information, there is a run report for this first event on the newly launched facebook page right here. Spoiler alert, they had a grand time too! 🙂 I think we can all agree, the event did good. Happy parkrunner, a grand day out. So grand in fact, let’s do it all again next week!\n\nSo there we go. Brilliance at Buxton. Go experience it for yourself. It won’t disappoint. ‘Til next time, bye bye Buxton. You did grand. Here’s to positive parkrun communities that generate their own magic. I’m sure King Buxton would have come good a lot earlier if he’d had access to a parkrun to make him feel included… Thank you all at brilliant Buxton, for creating a magical experience. You are bright sparks and superstars indeed. Yay you. 🙂\n\nSorry I snuck into your inaugural event. Oops.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nThere we have it. Remember, remember this fifth of November, when parkrunners assembled a lot. I see no reason why this firework season should ever be forgot. For on this day, down Buxton way, Pavilion Gardens parkrun sparkled into life. It was their intent, to create an event, of marshals and runners and joy. And you know what, they did just that! Isn’t it grand. #loveparkrun Congratulations to the whole team! You only bloomin’ did it! Huzzah indeed!\n\nIncidentally, you can extend your parkrun contemplations for longer by reading all my parkrun related posts here. Or not. It’s up to you. You’ll need to scroll down for older entries though. Also, you might just like to lean back in a comfy chair, close your eyes, and dreamily recall your happiest parkrun moments. Bet there are loads.\n\nThanks for staying the distance. Same time next week? Hoping so. 🙂\n\nDigested read: went to Perry Hall parkrun for the WMN listeners’ meet up. It was epic with all the things.\n\nUndigested read: – continue at your own risk, time vampire follows\n\nFinally! All good things as the saying goes….\n\nThis With Me Now Pow Wow (meet up) was a long time coming. It’s actually third time listeners to the unofficial parkrun podcast have got together to meet in real life. The first time they all met up is frankly of no consequence to me becausethe pod wasn’t then on my radar, but I’m sure it was a jolly event and attendees did the best they could in the circumstances to have fun times despite me and my BFF/ EWFM (pictured above) not yet being part of the ‘not a cult’ that is the With Me Now (WMN) audience. The podcast catapulted into my consciousness following Bushy parkrun’s grand 15 birthday celebrations way back in the olden days pre pandemic of 2019, when they gave my mum, Queen Elisabeth their ‘Spirit of parkrun’ award as their honorary marshal of some years. For ’tis she who came to support the parkrunners from her care home over the road, making her basically parkrun royalty that puts even PSH in the shade. I say this with some confidence, since she has an actual part of the course named after her ‘Elisabeth’s Corner’ whereas poor Paul – as far as I’m aware – has yet to receive that accolade. I mean granted he has a wikipedia entry, and a CBE and an FRSA after his name, and people do like to take selfies with him which is a start, but he is, alas, yet to have a part of a royal park named after him. Oh well, still time I guess.\n\nMeantime, how many celebrities can you espy in this little slide show I wonder? One parkrun, so many heroes!\n\nAnyways, the point is, that Danny, of WMN came to cover the 15 birthday celebrations at Bushy parkrun for his podcast, and as part of that interviewed the legend that is my mum (obvs) and so that got me into listening. My bad for not really discovering it previously.\n\nThen, as lockdown hit WMN became so very much more. It not only continued with the weekly pod despite there being no actual parkrun, the community grew. There were daily live feeds covering Pictionary , countdown, parkrunpedia, all sorts really. I’ll spare you the blah de blah, but in essence it became very much more than ‘just’ a pod, although granted it was always way superior to Free Weekly Timed, the official parkrun podcast. It became a supportive community of people not just across the UK but parkrun globally, keeping us together in a fun way. I live on my own, worked from home, and became very poorly during this time, so it is no exaggeration to say this connectivity became a lifeline during dark times. It’s hard to admit to being isolated and lonely, but I guess many of us were, and significantly, it was people in the WMN community who proactively reached out to me and rallied round one another, stopping people from feeling so invisible they slipped away entirely. To be able to become part of an inclusive, accepting, non-judgemental and positive community, that has the courage to be open about mental health and to address not just loneliness but full on existential angst is actually pretty goddarned amazing! Also, who doesn’t like a midweek ‘boop’ (sharing close up of pets’ noses) day, or childishly rude pictionary? Spoiler alert, NOBODY AT ALL! Plus, I learned sooooooooo much about loads of different parkruns that I’d need to be immortal to get round them all now, not to mention the history of uk post boxes, all of which turns out to be way more memorable than my Chemisty O’ level say AND makes me want to visit the postal museum in London now. I need to see a Penfold – this is but one example of how many of us were changed by the experience of lockdown. I am also way more knowledgeable than first appearances would suggest about sewer gas destructor street lamps (there’s one practically at the end of my road) and how to craft novelty items out of recycled parkrun high vis. My life was and indeed still is, weirdly the richer for it. Turns out it’s true! Every cloud really does have a silver lining!\n\nAs lockdown stretched on, the WMN community grew and strengthened, there were even spin off virtual events – I give you dear reader Noms Quarantine Quiz, a bi-lingual parkrun quiz spectacular that contiues still – and with this, there was great enthusiasm for having an actual in real life meet up at the first possible opportunity. That opportunity came last year, but, I couldn’t go. I was poorly and busy not dying and dreaming about a day when I’d be mobile again. My EWFM and other WMNers tried to include me by sending live links and hellos, and that was appreciated, but not gonna lie, it really wasn’t the same. I might have cried. A lot. It’s NOT FAIR.\n\nMonths went by, and finally Listener Meet up Take Three – WMN the second sequel – came around. All the hurrahs! I could go! Even more yays. And that’s what happened last weekend. And you know what, breaking the trend of disappointing sequels, the WMN gatherings just get better and better! FACT!\n\nBut wait, there’s more! In a perfect aligning of the planets, the rendezvous of choice was to be PERRY HALL parkrun. Largely due to the outstanding campaign by Emma, the event ED, RD and now a parkrun ambassado,r to keep PERRY HALL parkrun in all our minds throughout lockdown. This was exciting for many reasons. However, I was particularly taken by this as Emma was one of the many who had previously taken and posted a selfie with my mum at Bushy parkrun and this meant I’d finally get to meet her myself! RD and ED and Ambassador Emma that is, not my mum. Met her before. Known her all my life in fact. I’m not bragging, just stating the facts, I know her inside and out you might say…\n\nUpshot. There would be a gathering of the WMN community. What’s more, this time I’d get to go. It would be at PERRY HALL parkrun, oh, and as if that wasn’t an embarrassment of riches enough, the parkrun was to be a Ted Rogers! I know. #321. If you know, you know! Roger that!\n\nBut you know what, turns out every silver lining also has a cloud. Bluff called. Wait, what? I have to meet all these people I’ve never met before in actual real life? What if they hate me? What am I saying ‘what if?’ of course they’ll hate me! They are bound to hate me. I can’t remember how to socialise, or talk and absolutely not how to run. I can’t physically do that any more, even walking is a stretch. In fact, I’m not sure I could ever do any of those things in the first place now I come to think about it. There are cobwebs over my front door it’s been so long since I went out, and I definitely can’t remember how to put on a bra. Do people get dressed to go outside these days, or is that not a thing any more?\n\nHuge anticipatory angst ensued. Desperate to be part of something, but the fear of not fitting in, dark thoughts flooding my mind with IMPOSTER SYNDROME. They’d be sure to find me out. Particularly what with those flashing lights overhead proclaiming ‘IMPOSTER’ accompanying me at every step… It’s not something you can hide very easily. I tried to reframe this as ‘anticipatory excitement’ rather than actual ‘raw terror’ but paranoia stalked me in the build up if I’m honest. Fortunately, my aforementioned ladies’ companion, BFF and EWFM would be along to provide moral support. I pity those attending without one of those. What’s more, she brought along extra wonkies. Look:\n\nYou do know about wonkies right? What’s that? You aren’t sure? Sigh, erm, long story short, they are made out of recycled parkrun high vis, and popular extra marshals at junior parkruns, some 5k parkruns and emotional support animals for some. A few have even gone off on their own tours, circling the parkrun universe and checking in with their original creator from time to time on the Wonky Bear Facebook page – the Furthest Travelled Wonky made it almost 8,000 MILES to the world’s most remote parkrun, Cape Pembroke Lighthouse parkrun on the Falkland Islands. I know!\n\nThe original wonkies were bears, but mini wonkies and other wonkies have cascaded outwards with new creators taking the idea and going forth into the parkrun world with their own interpretations of the original HP brief. Thanks Hannah for starting it all 🙂 Thanks EWFM for continuing the supply line. Did I say ‘long story short’? Sorry, I lied. Long story long, but it’s a good one though isn’t it? Rhetorical question YES IT IS!\n\nAngst or no angst, the day dawned. Or more accurately parkrun eve. As many WMNers were coming from far afield (prize going to the one who joined us from Singapore, yes really. Normally that would be extraordinary, but in fact it’s only 6795 miles, so not as far as the wonky, respectable effort all the same. Good try pink kitten, the important thing is you made it. Hurrah!\n\nThe gathering began the night before at the Premier Inn in Perry Barr, or Holiday Inn for those who were late out of the starting gates. I have no idea how many stayed, but over a hundred I’d guess, the people on check in couldn’t work out what we were all doing there, not normally being booked out in this way. Inexplicably, they didn’t notice that we all had the same athletic physique that would define us as national and international sportspeople, I guess this just shows once again how inclusive parkrun can be, all shapes, sizes and ages welcome here.\n\nI got there first, my EWFM arriving soon after, and we did a bit of mad titivating pre the pre parkrun faff. I say mad titivating largely because the phrase delights me, and also because my EWFM says Mad Titivator sounds like a rather impressive drag act, which it totally does. Perhaps disappointingly, on this occasion the Mad Titivations involved simply scraping a comb through my hair, having a precautionary pee and checking for visible sweat stains before joining the assembling throng. Between us we’d booked out the entire evening of tables at the Harvester so people gathered and ebbed and flowed as tables became available. It was weird, but lovely to see people. Some I had met before, either at other parkruns, or The Malmo/ Amager Strand Bridge Trip (will write that up at some point I daresay). Many names I recognised or people I felt I’d met only actually hadn’t. It was peculiar at times, but nice peculiar. Someone had had the GENIUS idea of bringing labels so we could identify one another. It may sound cringey to the uninitiated, but honestly it was a godsend in recognising each other. Even if people have varying degrees of talent in decoding the astoundingly creative hieroglyphics, painstakingly drawn by someone with extraordinary talent, panache and creativity. I mean, this is very obviously a seal and not a badly drawn fish, but there’s no accounting for what goes on inside other people’s heads is there? We just have to make allowances for different ways of seeing the world, it makes it a richer place.\n\nIt is a seal though. Just so you know.\n\nSomehow, I ended up with the giddy responsibility of writing out the labels for those naive and trusting enough to allow me this level of free expression. It turned out to be a real boon, because it quickly became apparent name labels are waaaaaaaaaaaay more interesting if you include a bit about the wearers USP or claim to fame or random factoid. This was a great ice breaker, and genuinely moving at times as I asked people for this information and got the most amazing stories. Everyone has a story, and many will even share if you ask them, it’s Fab.U.Lous!\n\nSo it was I met: the world’s best hugger; the parkrunner who got engaged at the London Marathon (mile 16 in case that’s important to you); the parkrunner who is doing a trek across the Sahara Desert to raise funds for Breast Cancer UK; the man of mystery; the loser of found things and finder of lost things; not one but two parkrunners completing their Cowell (100 different parkrun locations) at Perry Hall; the parkrunner who was completing a Hoffman (100 different parkrun locations and no other parkruns – that’s exceptionally rare); the Welsh Munchkin; people who had been to Bushy parkrun and taken a selfie with my mum; a Homewood parkrunner who in lockdown accidentally raised £1.6 million after Chris Evans promoted a fund raiser aiming to raise a few grand in order to make scrubs for NHS workers. Suddenly, he was basically running a charity with oversight of design, manufacturing and logistics, this led to a bespoke rainbow fabric and many, many rainbow scrubs being distributed and worn nationwide – you might even have seen some when you got your jab; baton carrier; tailwalker extraordinaire; #teamDolly cat lover; parkrunner with unicorn(s); a regular at carnage corner (Cardiff parkrun apparently, just so you know); it’s my birthday parkrunner – oh just everything you could imagine and lots more besides. It was honestly maaaaaaaaaaagical. Some even made it onto their running shirts for the following day. It’s been said before, but I’ll say it again, the way parkrun brings together such an eclectic mix into a giddy cocktail of feelgood loveliness is little short of miraculous!\n\nI can’t mention the listener meet up/ pow wow without mentioning that our Friday night wasn’t entirely wow. In fact it was bittersweet, because the Ridiculously Attractive WMN presenter Danny, with his entourage didn’t make it. His car got broken into at a service station en route. All his critical blogging and vlogging stuff – drone, laptop, gimble, 500 shirt, extra special dolly buff – as well as clothes, quite possibly even barcodes were stolen. Devasting news and not the start to the grand weekend we’d all been anticipating.\n\nSad faces all round, as it was impossible to have any sort of real actual fun in thier absence of course, however we put a brave face on things as much as we could in the circumstances.\n\nThe upshot is that although there was much pre parkrun parkfaffery, friendships rekindled, anecdotes shared, laughs a-plenty and a great deal of hugging, there was a tinge of inner guttedness at the injustice of it all. Also, I wanted to be on the test panel for the world’s best hugger contest, but that didn’t quite happen, though some splendid hugs were available on request. I stayed up way past my bedtime and may even have got somewhat tipsy, although this was due to lack of practise in relation to alcohol consumption rather than obvious excess. I’m a lightweight these days, in terms of alcohol tolerance if not actual BMI. I eventually managed to tear myself away from the throng and stagger back to the hotel, bumping into a tall person on the way and spotting a wallet in the carpark. This turned out to belong to a fellow WMNer, and the tall person had a track record in losing and finding things, so all went well. There was a minor hiccup when I couldn’t get back into my room as the keycard didn’t work, but a fellow parkrunning guest took pity on me (there was a flight of stairs, which is sub optimum when you are using sticks) and swept it away, disappeared to scatter fairy dust or something on it, and it came back functional. Sometimes it’s really nice when someone rescues you. And so to bed.\n\nBlinking in the dark. One more sleep before parkrun day! It was very hard to sleep. Partly because of being super excited, partly because of being terrified about over sleeping and missing the whole thing, and partly because the room was approximately a gazillion degrees hot. Even poking various limbs out from under the covers, and having the window open as much as possible provided little respite. Oh well. I guess this is the future as the planet burns, not even funny, just true.\n\nMORNING!!!! It was the ACTUAL DAY, we were going to be at Perry Hall parkrun. FINALLY! So excited. Not too impressed at sleep deprivation, and we still had to negotiate about what time to arrive at the park which was just up the road, but even so, need to be there in lots of time to park and notch up pre-parkrun quality faffing. A busy day! It was jam packed, and a day full of insights. The insights started early, I discovered my EWFM and BFF who I thought I knew really well, can effortlessly, yes effortlessly, put on a sports bar and do up the back even when it is one of those ones with two different strappy bits. You know the ones with one that does up in the middle of your back and one that does up mid way between your shoulder blades. They do give good support, but I’ve never fathomed how you can get into them without a team of personal dressers on hand to assist. Only turns out she has specially evolved wrists that bend and stretch and twist so she can do this with no more effort than lifting a feather. Honestly, I’ve know her best part of 4 decades, shared a house with her for much of that and I had absolutely no idea. It just shows dear reader, don’t take those you think you know around you for granted, they can still reveal new talents of which you were previously unaware. She has basically got a super power. The weirdest thing being that she had no idea this ability is exceptional. Frankly you could build an act for Cirque de Soleil around that one super power. A.Maz.Ing. Perry parkrun was going to have to be pretty spectacular to top that. Spoiler alert. It was!\n\nSo we headed off in a mini convoy to the park. Not gonna lie, it"
