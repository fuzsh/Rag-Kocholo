I received several emails telling me the delivery would take some time.\n\nAnd yes, you're correct, side bars labelled as 4's. i have two bundles of top bars the look tobe the same width.\n\nWell , this is folk law as it came from my Grandfather in the 1960's so i will probably be shot down in flames....\n\nHe ran hives in both 14x12s and brood and a half format , his belief was that DN4 should be used in the brood box of brood and a half because if DN5 were used then they restrict the queen crossing from Brood to the half brood\n\nHe told me that the original intention of the DN5 was an Australian method to restrict the queen to the brood box without QE and not as we are now told to reduce brace comb\n\nok I said it was foik law, but i have seen a reference somewhere to the same view in a book i read for BBKA module...cant remember the title though.. just in case i am flamed ..dial 999\n\nAs ITMA says the only difference is the top bars of the 5`s are a bit wider than the 4`s, i would check them to make sure what you have actually got, when i buy mine in 50`s the top bars are not wrapped or labeled just in a bundle, as are the bottom bars, its the side bars that are wrapped in cellophane and labeled as SN4 or DN4 depending on what you wanted ie Shallow or Deep frames, so maybe thats the problem.\n\nSpot on.\n\nCheck the top bar width with that of the lug, it will be wider than the lug. The side bars are 'job lot' 4 or 5 makes no diff. My only criticism is the bottom bars which are not stepped to match the width of the bottom of the side bar.\n\nHe told me that the original intention of the DN5 was an Australian method to restrict the queen to the brood box without QE and not as we are now told to reduce brace comb\n\nFlame you?\n\nNever, but I will call on the Aussies or whoever.\n\nOn standard hoffman sides the wide bars leave a nice 8mm gap between -- as opposed to the 12mm gap between the narrower bars.\n\nThat isn't small enough to act as a QX.\n\nBut 8mm is exactly in-line with the beespace found between brood combs.\n\nAnd 12mm isn't.\n\nOn 14x12 the wide bar is standard, presumably for strength rather than in place of a qx!\n\n... My only criticism is the bottom bars which are not stepped to match the width of the bottom of the side bar.\n\nActually, its T's sidebars that are waisted too deeply, so there is another beespace-plus gap there.\n\nThe 'stepped' bottom bars are as used on Manley frames and give the same overall width as the wide top bar ... and yes that does mean that Manley bottoms don't smoothly blend into T's sidebars.\n\nThis is something Bob Smith bangs on about, given half a chance.\n\nSome manufacturers DO make 'proper' sidebars. But T's various Sales offer a much cheaper product. Its just a shame that they do too much material removal - it would actually be easier for them to make the better product...\n\nHowever, its very rare for me to see brace comb in the 'wasted' area. So I don't think that dimension matters overmuch.\n\nWhereas brace comb is quite common on the top bars, the narrower ones especially...\n\nSpot on.\n\nCheck the top bar width with that of the lug, it will be wider than the lug.

A superior bottom bar, that is stepped at each end (the main bar is wider) making it flush with the side bar instead of two bars being narrower than the frames (as they are with those from T's) is available from another supplier. They are not Manleys, they are supplied with DN5's\n\nI find the bees enjoy drawing a bit of a mess along both the narrow top bars and along the bottom bars, but more so the bottom.\n\n...

They are not Manleys, they are supplied with DN5's\n\nWho, (go on give us a clue) ordinarily supplies the Manley-type bottom bar with their DN5s? Or 14x12s?\n\nAnd does the sidebar bottom width match with the width of their sidebar? (As noted above, T's sidebar becomes narrower than the wide Manley bottoms.)\n\nNo question, that would be the best solution, if the cost penalty isn't excessive.\n\nI bought all SN4 frames in the T****** sale a couple of years ago. Now I wish I had bought Manley frames. So I am trying to think of a way to up grade the top bars by buying sides and bottom bars. What is your advise please? I am confused about the 'one piece' bottom bars, ( it doesn't take a lot to confuse me). Can I buy these with Manley sidebars? Surely this would make a very sturdy box like frame. Do you think this one peice bottom bar a good idea? Also does one have to buy brood comb foundation to go with Manley frames?\n\nI bought all SN4 frames in the T****** sale a couple of years ago.

What is your advise please?\n\nThere are no parts in common between SN4 and Manley. (SN5 shares the same wider top bar.)\n\nSorry.\n\nI am confused about the 'one piece' bottom bars, ( it doesn't take a lot to confuse me). Can I buy these with Manley sidebars? Surely this would make a very sturdy box like frame. Do you think this one peice bottom bar a good idea? Also does one have to buy brood comb foundation to go with Manley frames?\n\nOne-piece bottom bars are intended for the folks who wire their own foundation - often because they make their own foundation.\n\nNational Manleys take standard National shallow foundation.\n\nBut Manleys are often chosen by those wanting to get some cut comb - for which you would use thin and UNwired foundation.\n\nThey are pretty sturdy as standard!\n\nBit puzzled by the reference to \"brood comb foundation\".\n\nManleys are shallows, optimised for use as crop supers.\n\nI'm guessing you mean \"worker\" rather than \"drone\" cell-size pattern foundation.\n\nIts simplest to stick to worker everywhere -- but that is a whole different can of worms!\n\nThanks everyone for their replies.\n\nI ordered bs Manley super frames, and dn5 brood frames.\n\nThe top bars supplied are both the same at 26.5mm wide and 17mm deep.\n\nSimplest answer is take them along next time I see my man and ask him to show me how both sets fit together. Seems like same top bar, but with different side and bottom bars.\n\nBrace comb etc, I'll deal with as I have to.\n\nThank you itma, I do have sn5, just checked the receipts. So I hope I can buy some Manley side bars and bottom bars?\n\nI was told that using Manley frames would mean extra honey per inch of super frame. Is this true? Or is it just to make uncapping easier?\n\nA teacher at my CBKA said to use brood foundation to achieve more honey and less wax. Although, I think I will stick with my worker foundation, as you suggest."
