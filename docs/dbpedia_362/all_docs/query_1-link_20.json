        "text": "•Guide prices given are indications within 10% upwards or downwards of where the reserve price may be set at the time of going to print. Please note they are not an indication of the anticipated sale price or a valuation.\n\n•The reserve price is the minimum price at which the property can be sold.\n\n•Both the guide price and reserve price may be subject to change up to and including the day of the auction.\n\n•For unsold properties after an auction an Available price may be listed. This is the price that the seller(s) are looking for post auction, subject to contract and no higher offers, and has no relation to the guide prices listed prior to the auction sale.\n\nPlease note that all prices listed, whether prior to or post auction, are subject to contract.\n\nThe Auctioneers and sellers accept no responsibility for any loss, cost or damage that a buyer may incur as a result of relying on any guide price. It is the buyer's responsibility to decide how much they should bid for any lot. Please check with us for regular updates as guide prices are subject to change prior to the auction.\n\nThe guide price does not include the buyer's fee charged by the auctioneer or VAT which may apply to the sale or other amounts the seller may charge. The seller's Special Conditions of Sale will state whether there are other seller's charges and whether the seller has elected to charge VAT on the sale price."
