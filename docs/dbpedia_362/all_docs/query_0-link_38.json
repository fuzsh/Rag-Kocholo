Today, the tradition of music in the park is still preserved.\n\nHere is one of the first romantic gardens in Romania. As time passed, only part of the initial structure of alleys and vegetation was maintained.\n\nThe statues of Alei Park are also works of art and historical monuments. Most importantly, from the point of view of art, it is the bust of Mihai Eminescu. Another important monument is dedicated to the French army, as a tribute to the commander of the allied troops of the Balkan Peninsula during the First World War, Marshal Foch. The monument was installed in 1920 when the name of Marshal Foch was also assigned to the park.\n\nStatue of Apollo Belvedere, Giurgiu\n\nThe statue of Apollo Belvedere is one of the historical monuments recognized in Giurgiu County.

In 2013, they were rebuilt and re-upgraded.\n\nInside the ensemble was built a cross in memory of the hero Captain Daia Marin, who was born in 1919 in the village of Malu, Giurgiu County, and died in Blăjel commune, during the battles that the Romanian army wore in 1944, in the area Sibiu.\n\n\"La Nicu Nebunu' Bar, Gostinu\n\nAddress: DJ507, Gostinu\n\nMocănașul Island\n\nNear the town of Giurgiu lies the island of Mocanu, which is a protected natural area.\n\nMocanu Island is also known as Mokan Island, Ostrovul Mocanu or Mokan Island.\n\nThe Mocanu Island, crossed by the Giurgiu-Ruse Bridge, has a total length of about 5 km and a maximum width of 1.2 km.\n\nOn Mocanu Island tourists can observe several species of birds, including mackerel, wild duck and eretes, which have their habitat in a vegetation characteristic of the dams.
