        "text": "If you’re planning on visiting Romania and Bulgaria, a road trip between their respective capitals – Bucharest and Sofia – has much to offer. Whichever route you choose, you’ll embark on a journey rich in history, culture, and natural beauty. In this article, we’ll guide you along three of the major routes. We’ve included the cities and towns you’ll pass through, the various roads, and some of the attractions worth a visit.\n\nA Relationship Forged in Time\n\nThe shared history, cultural similarities, and tradition of cooperation have all shaped the relationship between Romania and Bulgaria. As neighbouring Balkan states, they enjoy a common heritage which has sustained diplomatic relations. This has resulted in numerous collaborative efforts in various fields. They work together to develop infrastructure, boost the economy, and protect national interests. Their common border lends itself to tourism, cultural exchanges and more.\n\nBefore you set off for Sofia, remember you are required to have a vignette to use the motorways in Bulgaria. As soon as you cross the Bulgarian border, a valid vignette needs to be activated for your vehicle. The Bulgarian police is known for its strict controls around border crossings. We know off people driving during the night who got caught for not having a valid vignette. Do not take the risk and ensure you’ve bought it while still driving in Romania.\n\nRomania: Of Vampires and Vineyards\n\nThis captivating Eastern European country attracts visitors from across the world. From Transylvania, complete with spooky castles, to UNESCO-recognised monasteries, the historical treasures seem infinite. For nature enthusiasts, the Danube Delta is a haven for wildlife, while the Carpathian Mountains draw hikers. Its cities are a melting pot, with many boasting a contrasting blend of tradition and innovation. The arts scene and nightlife are incredible. Romanians are, by nature, hospitable. As eager to share a story, as they are to recommend a local delicacy. Interested in learning about other road trip options? Read about the highway to the Black Sea.\n\nBucharest: Eastern Europe’s Little Paris\n\nThe capital, Bucharest, captures the old and new themes typical of Romania. Known as “Little Paris'', it is elegant in its architecture and romantic in its appeal. You can hardly miss the Palace of the Parliament which is one of the largest buildings in the world. For something more serene, Herastrau Park lets escape the surrounding hustle. The adjacent Arch of Triumph is a reminder of the noble past of this proud nation. If you enjoy cities and you enjoy history, you really can’t go wrong in Bucharest.\n\nBulgaria: Compact in size, huge in history\n\nBulgaria lies nestled in the towering Balkan Mountains. It weaves history, scenery, and hospitality, resulting in a country that entices many visitors. Ancient Roman ruins, stunning cathedrals, and quaintly preserved villages dot the landscape. Bulgaria is a historical treasure chest. Those seeking diverse outdoor attractions won’t be disappointed. From the popular beaches on the Black Sea to the rolling mountains, nature lovers are well-catered for. Speaking of catering, it seems every town has mouth-watering delicacies to sample. To really enjoy the countryside, you might consider driving with a motorhome in Bulgaria. Travelling with a motorhome give the freedom to stop on more scenic places in the country. Bucharest, Sofia, the Black Sea Highway, North Macedonia and Serbia: all is within reach when you have a motorhome.\n\nSofia: A seamless blend of old and new.\n\nReflecting diversity in a microcosm, Sofia encapsulates the best of the past and the present. A historical surprise awaits around every corner. The spectacular architecture houses a wealth of cultural treasures. Do not miss the Alexander Nevsky Cathedral, or St. Sofia Church in historic Serdica. Museums boast of both the country and the city’s past. Along the streets, sidewalk cafes tempt one with a mix of aromas, while select boutiques and busy markets vie for your trade."
