This postcode has been in use since 1985-10-01.\n\nStreetScan combines information about Latin Gardens, Doncaster, DN5 8TE and displays a report on the quality of life in this place and its surroundings.\n\nNearby postcodes are: DN5 8RL, DN5 8XD, DN5 8UY, DN5 8XB, DN5 8RJ, DN5 8RH, DN5 8XE.\n\nIn the UK, the overall gender distribution is approximately 49% male and 51% female. However, the area surrounding DN5 8TE has a female population much higher than UK average, with 58.9% of the population being female. Several factors can contribute to this. Women generally live longer than men, resulting in a higher proportion of women in neighborhoods with significant elderly populations. Typically, as people grow older, they tend to relocate from city center addresses to suburban areas, smaller towns, and rural locations. Consequently, these areas often have a higher number of females. A higher female population can also be found in areas with industries that employ more women, such as healthcare, education, and retail.\n\nAcross the UK, the average 48.4% rated their health as Very Good, 33.6% as Good, 12.7% as Fair, 4% as Bad, and 1.2% as Very Bad.\n\nPopulation age significantly impacts residents' health. Additionally, socioeconomic status plays a crucial role: higher income levels and lower poverty rates are linked to better health outcomes. Affluent areas benefit from higher living standards, access to private healthcare, and healthier lifestyle choices.\n\nThis area has a lower percentage of residents reporting their health as Good or Very Good (67.7%) compared to the average (82%).
