Baker, business partner of Senator John P. Jones, the founder of Santa Monica. Arcadia and her husband divided their time between their Los Angeles residence in the ornate Baker Block and their home on Ocean Avenue, known as Ocean Cottage.\n\nBaker owned rancho San Vicente, bought from the Sepulveda Family for $55,000. The Rancho included all of Santa Monica and its borders were Pico, Sepulveda, Topanga, and the Pacific Ocean. Two years later Baker sold a portion of the rancho to Senator Jones for $162,500.\n\nBy 1879, Arcadia, wealthy in her own right, bought out her husband's land and business holdings, and with Baker's death in 1894, expanded her business partnership with Senator Jones to establish the Santa Monica Land and Water Company, which subdivided and developed 50,000 acres in West Los Angeles.\n\nIn the 1890s, she and Senator Jones were responsible for the donation of the land we now enjoy as Palisades Park.\n\nShe was reported to never have spoken English but conducted all conversations in her perfect Castilian Spanish, with an interpreter always present.\n\nArcadia lived to the venerable age of 85, dying in 1912, the same year as Senator Jones. She left an estate valued between $8 million and $15 million, but no will and no children led to a famous court battle over her estate – the largest ever probated in California.\n\nArcadia Bandini made donations of land, all over the Los Angeles – region to be used for parks, schools, orphanages, and other projects that were of public benefit. As there was no facility for veterans of the Civil War west of the Mississippi, she donated the land for the National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers and Sailors (now the Veteran's Administration).\n\n[ ]\n\n[https://www.santamonica.gov/blog/celebrating-women-s-history-arcadia-bandini-stearns-de-baker]\n\n[ ]\n\n[https://smmirror.com/2010/11/arcadia-bandini-santa-monica-shaper-hometown-hero/]\n\nwealthy Californio landowner and socialite of Los Angeles.\n\nArcadia de Stearns Baker was known as the \"godmother of Santa Monica\" and a \"great benefactress\" for her contributions to and vision for the formation and development of the city\n\nAs she created the original map for the city plan and layout, her aesthetic vision was crucial in structuring Santa Monica. She donated a great deal of her land – for example, to the city of Santa Monica for Palisades Park; to the government to form a National Home for Disabled Veterans (now the Veterans' Administration); to the government to create the first experimental forestry station in the United States; and to schools, churches, and clubs (like the Bay City Women's Club)\n\nIn 1879, de Stearns Baker bought out her husband Colonel Baker's land and business holdings and officially became the business partner of John Percival Jones. In 1897, de Stearns Baker and Jones founded the Santa Monica Land and Water Company, which \"subdivided and developed about 50,000 acres in West Los Angeles.\n\nHer father Juan, born in Peru, was considered the \"first citizen of San Diego,\" and the Bandini family home, Casa de Bandini, was the center of San Diego society. The social gatherings and dances in the Bandini home and gardens were so renowned that Juan Bandini achieved legend status and was labeled by historian Winifred Davidson as the \"Prince of Hosts.\"\n\nher father Juan Bandini, a former revolutionary himself, supported the Anglo American invaders during the 1846 Bear Flag Revolt. His extensive business dealings with Anglo American men like Abel Stearns led him to believe that the future of California would be American, not Mexican. Bandini and her sisters Ysidora and Josefa were said to have made a United States flag out of fabric from their own clothes and put it up at Juan Bandini's San Diego ranch in 1847\n\n[ ]\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcadia_Bandini_de_Stearns_Baker]\n\nDEDICATED TO ARCADIA BANDINI DE BAKER, 1827-1912.
