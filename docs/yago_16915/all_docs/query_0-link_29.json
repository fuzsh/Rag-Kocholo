        "text": "Don Abel Stearns House (El Palacio) was located in Los Angeles, California, US. His home was at the southeast corner of Main and Arcadia streets. Here he built a substantial, wide spreading adobe surrounding a large courtyard. The house was a one-story adobe, and covered the entire ground occupied by the block, with an extensive \"patio\" or inner court in the center. When the outer gates were closed, this was a citadel capable of withstanding a siege.[1]\n\nThe residence was on the site of what became the Baker Block; and it was for many years, both before and after the change of government, a prominent social center for Southern California. Abel Stearns was married to Arcadia Bandini de Stearns Baker, and it was at this home that the famously beautiful daughters of Don Juan Bandini (Arcadia, Josefa, and Ysidora) entertained their wide circle of acquaintances from San Diego and Santa Barbara at grand balls and other social functions characteristic of life in Spanish countries. Here Commodore Jones in 1842, and Captain Fremont in 1846 and 1847, and other distinguished historical figures at various periods were hospitably entertained.[2]"
