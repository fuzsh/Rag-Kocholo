There he developed an agency to protect the forests of the San Gabriel Mountains, where ranchers typically set fires to clear land for livestock grazing, but then, as a result, subsequent rainfalls led to flooding in the valleys. On his own property, he developed land management techniques for raising livestock alongside cultivated forests. Aided by his friend naturalist John Muir, Kinney established the San Gabriel Timberland Reserve in December 1892, forerunner to the Angeles National Forest. In 1883, Kinney and Helen Hunt Jackson co-wrote a report for the U.S. Department of the Interior on the condition of California Mission Indians. This report and others led to the Mission Indian Act of 1891, which created a commission to seek to establish or confirm reservations in Southern California. In 1887, Kinney established the nation's first forestry station in Rustic Canyon' on 6 acres (24,000 m2) of land donated by Santa Monica co-founder' John P. Jones (also a U.S. Senator from Nevada), and Arcadia Bandini de Stearns Baker. One of the station's projects was a study of the newly introduced eucalyptus trees. Real estate development Santa Monica Kinneloa did not suit Kinney's first wife Margaret Kinney in the summer months, and in 1886 they built a summer home in Santa Monica. Kinney formed the Santa Monica Improvement Company in 1887 and built a lawn tennis club. In 1887 Kinney purchased 247 acres (1.00 km2) of land on the bluffs north of Santa Monica Canyon to be developed as Santa Monica Heights, but economic conditions forced Kinney to abandon the project. Collis P. Huntington of Southern Pacific Railroad bought the property in 1891 and renamed it \"Huntington Palisades.\" Kinney shifted his attention to the coastal area south of Santa Monica. Ocean Park In 1891, Kinney and his partner, Francis Ryan, bought a controlling interest in Pacific Ocean Casino and a tract of land 1.5 miles (2.4 km) long and 1,000 feet (300 m) wide along the Santa Monica beach. Kinney and Ryan built a pier, golf course, horse-racing track, boardwalk and other resort amenities. Kinney convinced the Santa Fe Railroad to extend its Inglewood line north to his resort. Ryan died in 1898, and his widow's new husband, Thomas Dudley, sold their half interest to a group of men (Fraser, Gage and Merritt Jones) not to Kinney's liking. With a flip of a coin, which Kinney won, he took the marshy southern half to build his Venice of America Venice of America Main article: Venice Canal Historic District The Venice recreation area opened on July 4, 1905. Venice came to be known as the Coney Island of the Pacific. By mid-January 1906, an area was built along the edge of the Grand Lagoon patterned after the amusement thoroughfares of the great 19th and 20th century expositions. It featured foreign exhibits, amusements, and freak shows. Trolley service was available from Downtown Los Angeles and nearby Santa Monica. Visitors were dazzled by the system of canals complete with gondolas and gondoliers brought in from Venice, Italy. There were ornate Venetian-style businesses and a full-sized amusement pier. Around the entire park, a miniature steam railroad ran on a 2 1‚ÅÑ2-mile (4.0 km) track. Kinney and some of the nearby residents were aghast at some of the low-class shows that Venice began to offer, but it was considered the best collection of amusement devices on the Pacific Coast, and made a handsome profit. Eventually, Kinney gained control of city politics and had the name changed from \"Ocean Park\" to \"Venice\" in 1911. Kinney was also allowed to build a 60-foot (18 m) breakwater to protect his facilities from storm tides. Kinney Heights Around 1900 Kinney developed a suburban tract at what was then the western edge of the city of Los Angeles. Named Kinney Heights, the development attracted mostly upper-middle-class families who built large Craftsman homes, many of which still stand. The area is now part of the West Adams Terrace Historic Preservation Overlay Zone (HPOZ).\n\nSources\n\n1860 United States Federal Census Name Abbott Kinney Age 8 Birth Year abt 1852 Gender Male Race White Birth Place New Jersey Home in 1860 New Brunswick, Middlesex, New Jersey Post Office New Brunswick Dwelling Number 690 Family Number 710 Attended School Yes Household Members Name Age F S Kinney Mary Kinney Nathaniel Kinney Francis Kinney Constance Kinney Earnest Kinney Abbott Kinney James Kinney Charles Maker Ann Maker Catharine Lynch Margaret Mellen Teresa Obrien [1]\n\n1900 United States Federal Census Name Abbot Kinney Age 47 Birth Date Nov 1850 Birthplace New Jersey Home in 1900 Santa Monica, Los Angeles, California Ward of City 3 Street Ocean Avenue House Number 432 Sheet Number 13 Number of Dwelling in Order of Visitation 343 Family Number 357 Race White Gender Male Relation to Head of House Head Marital Status Married Spouse's Name Margaret Kinney Marriage Year 1885 Years Married 15 Father's Birthplace New York Mother's Birthplace Maine Occupation Farmer Months Not Employed 0 Can Read Yes Can Write Yes Can Speak English Yes House Owned or Rented O Home Free or Mortgaged F Farm or House H Household Members Name Age Abbot Kinney Margaret Kinney Thornton Kinney Kent Kinney Sherwood Kinney Innes Kinney Carleton Kinney Helen Mcgowan Agnes Strouse [2]\n\n1910 United States Federal Census Name Abbot Kinney Age in 1910 59 Birth Year abt 1851 Birthplace New Jersey Home in 1910 Ballona, Los Angeles, California Street Park Avenue House Number 16 Race White Gender Male Relation to Head of House Head Marital Status Married Spouse's Name Margaret T Kinney Father's Birthplace New York Mother's Birthplace Maine Native Tongue English Occupation Real Estate Industry Agent Employer, Employee or Other Own Account Home Owned or Rented Own Home Free or Mortgaged Free Farm or House House Able to read Yes Able to Write Yes Years Married 26 Household Members Name Age Abbot Kinney 59 Margaret T Kinney 45 Thornton Kinney 23 Sherwood Kinney 18 Innes Kinney 17 Carlton Kinney 16 Ah Fong 40 [3]\n\n1920 United States Federal Census Name Abbot Kinney Age 63 Birth Year abt 1857 Birthplace New Jersey Home in 1920 Venice, Los Angeles, California Street Grand Canal House Number 1 Residence Date 1920 Race White Gender Male Relation to Head of House Head Marital Status Married Spouse's Name Winifred H Kinney Father's Birthplace New York Mother's Birthplace Maine Able to Speak English Yes Occupation Dealer Industry Real Estate Employment Field Own Account Home Owned or Rented Own Home Free or Mortgaged Free Able to read Yes Able to Write Yes Household Members Name Age Abbot Kinney Winifred H Kinney Carlton Kinney Helen H Kinney Clan Kinney May B Kinney Lottie E Cosson [4]\n\nCalifornia, Biographical Index Cards, 1781-1990 Name Abbot Kinney Birth Date 16 Nov 1850 Birth Location Brookside, N J Father's Name Franklin Sherwood Kinney Mother's Name Mary Coopwell Spouse's Name Margaret Thornton Marriage Date 18 Nov 1885 Marriage Location San Francisco Death Date 4 Nov 1920 [5]\n\nCalifornia, Death Index, 1905-1939 Name Abbot Kinney Birth Year abt 1851 Death Date 4 Nov 1920 Age at Death 69 Death Place Los Angeles, California, USA [6]\n\nCalifornia, Voter Registers, 1866-1898 Name Abbott Kinney Residence Year 1884 Residence Place Los Angeles, California Age 33 Birth Year abt 1851 [7]\n\nCalifornia, Voter Registers, 1866-1898 Name Abbot Kinney Residence Year 1890 Residence Place Los Angeles, California Age 40 Birth Year abt 1850 [8]\n\nCalifornia, Voter Registers, 1866-1898 Name Abbott Kinney Residence Year 1896 Residence Place Los Angeles, California Age 46 Birth Year abt 1850 [9]\n\nNew York, Passenger Lists, 1820-1957 Name Abbot Kinney Arrival Date 23 Oct 1874 Birth Date abt 1846 Age 28 Gender Male Ethnicity/ Nationality German Place of Origin Germany Port of Departure Liverpool, England Destination United States of America Port of Arrival New York, New York Ship Name Cuba Search Ship Database Cuba Abbot Kinney - Oct 1874 - New York, New York Liverpool, England Liverpool, England - Male - Cuba [10]\n\nNorth America, Family Histories, 1500-2000 Name Abbot Kinney Gender Male Spouse Margaret Thornton [11]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbot_Kinney"
