        "text": "The Journal of San Diego History\n\nSAN DIEGO HISTORICAL SOCIETY QUARTERLY\n\nWinter 1969, Volume 15, Number 1\n\nRita Larkin, Editor\n\nby Patricia Baker\n\nPatricia Baker is a senior at the San Diego College for Women. She is a history major, and during a class in California history last year, she became interested in the old families in Californian history. She did research last summer on the topic, and plans to do further research in the field\n\nin graduate school.\n\nBorn: Los Angeles, California\n\nHome: La Puente, California\n\nActivities: President, Young Republicans of USD\n\nPresident, International Relations Club\n\nMember, Delta Epsilon Sigma\n\nDelegate, Model United Nations\n\nIn Florence on Sunday, April 26, 1478, a \"young Florentine\n\ncoxcomb\" murdered Guilliano Medici, the brother of Florence’s ruler, Lorenzo\n\nMedici. Several months later this assassin was executed. The culprit? Bernardo\n\nBandini.\n\nFour centuries later, in December of 1818, José Bandini, a\n\nnative of Andulacia, Spain, a lieutenant of the Spanish vessel, \"Nymphia,\" at\n\nthe Battle of Trafalgar, transported troops on his ship, \"Reina de Los Angeles,\"\n\nto Monterey to defend the city against the attack of the pirate, Bouchard.\n\nOn November 29, 1831, just thirteen years later, José’s son,\n\nJuan, who had been born in San Marcos de Arica, Peru, on October 4, 1800, issued\n\na pronunciamiento, denouncing his allegiance to Victoria, the Mexican\n\ngovernor of California,\n\nIn his pronunciamiento, Bandini stated: \"Let\n\nthe rights of the citizens be born anew; let liberty spring up from the ashes of\n\noppression, and perish the depotism that has suffocated our security.\"\n\nThat night Bandini and fourteen other\n\nSan Diegans arrested Captain Argüello, Lieutenant Valle and Portilla and seized\n\nthe presidio. Bandini said of that night: \"I presented my apology to Captain\n\nArgüello playing cards with Lt. Valle, then a pair of pistols and marched them\n\noff to prison where they found their commandant, Portilla, had preceded them.\"\n\nGovernor Victoria marched south to quell this uprising.\n\nVictoria’s little army and the Bandini – led rebels met near the Cahuenga Pass\n\non December 6, 1831. Victoria was wounded. Following this battle, Victoria\n\nresigned his post as governor and retired to the mission at San Gabriel to\n\nrecover. On January 17, 1832, he sailed to Mexico. California was rid of an\n\nuncongenial governor.\n\nWherever the Bandinis’ appeared, revolution followed. Juan\n\nseems to have inherited the qualities of his fifteenth century counterpart,\n\nBernardo Bandini. At every meeting, revolt, or conspiracy Juan Bandini was one\n\nof the leaders. Almost any reason was sufficient for Juan to incite revolt.\n\nVictoria’s refusal to call the disputación had sparked the\n\nrevolt of 1831. A deeper reason was Victoria’s refusal to secularize the\n\nMissions. Bandini pressured the next governor, José Figueroa, until he had\n\nissued a decree on August 9, 1834 that the Franciscans would be deprived of the\n\nmanagement of the land and the Indians. Figueroa had initially opposed this\n\nsecularization, for he held that \"the Indians were incapable of managing their\n\naffairs in any orderly way\" and that they \"had no sense of the value of property,\n\nand no wish to possess it for any reason except for gambling.\"\n\nBecause of his part in the secularization movement, Juan\n\nBandini won the title: Destroyer of the California missions.\n\nIn 1836 Bandini was back in the revolution-making business –\n\nthis time in opposition to Governor Juan Bautista Alvarado. José Antonio\n\nCarrillo returned from his post as territorial congressman in Mexico with the\n\nnews that his brother, Carlos, had been appointed governor to replace Governor\n\nAlvarado, and that the capital had been changed from Monterey to Los Angeles.\n\nCarlos had \"a large and a magnificent presence,\" but he lacked force and\n\nresolution in political matters and was \"wax in the hands of his brother,\" José\n\nAntonio.\n\nGovernor Alvarado refused to step down as governor, taut\n\nCarlos took the oath of office as governor at Los Angeles on December 6, 1836.\n\nIn February Alvarado had still refused to resign. Therefore, Bandini and José\n\nAntonio Pico took a group of San Diegans to Los Angeles. In Los Angeles, because\n\nthere were only a few members of the band, Bandini had them dress differently so\n\nas to make them appear as different persons when they went to stand guard.\n\nThe Bandini-Pico band was defeated at San Buenaventura by\n\nthe Alvarado forces and Carlos Carrillo was forced to resign. This defeat ended\n\nthe opposition everywhere except in San Diego. When reports of San Diego’s\n\ncontinued opposition filtered into Santa Barbara. Alvarado sent a group of\n\ntwenty-six men, led by Castro, to San Diego, The band reached the Bandini home\n\nat midnight on Christmas. Despite the gala celebration, the soldiers surrounded\n\nthe home and arrested the two Carrillos and two of the Picos, but Bandini and\n\nJosé Antonio Estudillo escaped. This finally quelled the opposition in San Diego.\n\nDuring the Mexican-American war and during the United States’ \"Conquest\" of California,\n\nJuan Bandini supported the Americans. His three daughters are even credited\n\nwith making the first American flag that was raised in the Old Town Plaza on\n\nJuly 29, 1846 -the day John Charles Fremont arrived in town. Juan supported the\n\nAmericans because he sought relief from the boredom that followed the cessation\n\nof revolution and the resumption of his duties as a rancher.\n\nThe American control of California, however, did not restore\n\nBandini to his old position as revolutionary. He was faced, instead, with the\n\njota of maintaining his vast tracts of land which stretched from Tijuana to the\n\nSan Bernardino mountains. Seeking relief from boredom, Juan turned his boundless\n\nenergy to numerous wild business schemes. In 1850 Juan invested $15,000 to\n\nbuild the Gila House, an inn and general store, to accommodate the gold seekers\n\ntraveling from Mexico to Sacramento. In December Juan borrowed $10,000 from a\n\nFrench gambler at four percent monthly interest. When Bandini could not meet the\n\npayments, the Frenchman gave him an extension, but required the mortgage on both\n\nBandini’ s home and store. In 1851 Bandini was surprised to discover that \"all\n\nof a sudden trade left entirely.\"\n\nIn order to pay his debts, Juan hurried down to Rancho\n\nGuadalupe, near Tijuana, to market the goods from the Rancho. But to Bandini’s\n\namazement the Rancho had gone to seed and he hired a new supervisor and workers.\n\nWhile Bandini was at the Rancho his son-in-law, Charles\n\nJohnson, \"took the occasion to describe the entire family crisis to Abel Stearns\n\n-Don Juan’ s costly business schemes, the gambling proclivities of the don’ s\n\nyoung sons, and the expenditures of Dona Refugia Bandini in preparing\n\none elegant fiesta after another even while feeling ‘awfully\n\ndowncast’ about money matters. Johnson estimated that a loan of $2,000 and\n\nproper management could save the Bandini estate and even make it profit ‘hansomely’.\"\n\nStearns took over the mortgage and saved Bandini from bankruptcy.\n\nHowever, when Juan ignored the repeated pleas of his son-in-law for\n\nsanity and realism in his business endeavors, the Bandini sons-in-law withdrew\n\nall financial help. They remained friendly towards Juan, but they carried\n\non family matters without his advice. This caused Juan to complain of having lost\n\nrespect. He no longer found himself the revolutionary of former days; instead,\n\nhe was merely the father of numerous children who had to bail him out of his\n\nfinancial troubles, which were caused not only by his business failures, but\n\nalso because he was a pace-setter in the social circles. He was one of the early\n\nCalifornia socialites and his wife often threw elegant fiestas which cost Juan\n\nas much as $1,000.\n\nThe slender and darkly handsome man had introduced the waltz\n\ninto California in 1820. At every dance he was the master of ceremonies. The\n\nCalifornians called him \"Tecolero,\" for it was his duty to lead a woman, usually\n\nthe belle of the ball, onto the dance floor and the performance was always\n\nbeautifully executed.\n\nThe children, whom Juan charged with having lost respect for\n\nhim, were produced through his November 20, 1822, marriage to Marie de los\n\nDolores Estudillo, the daughter of one of San Diego’s founders, Captain José\n\nMaríá Estudillo.\n\nThe first son of Juan and Dolores, Alejandro Félix Rafael, died\n\nat the age of fourteen on May 10, 1839. José Maríá, their second son, married\n\nMaríaTeresa Arguello, one of the twenty-two children of Santiago Argüello.\n\nJuan’s three daughters – Josefa, Arcadia, and Isidora – were\n\nconsidered three of the most beautiful girls in California, In 1846, Josefa\n\nmarried Pedro C. Carrillo, the son of Carlos Antonio Carrillo, Pedro studied law\n\nin Boston, where he had been taken by Captain William G. Dana, the husband of\n\nPedro’s sister, María Josefa Petra del Carmen.\n\nPedro and Josefa were given the Peninsula de San Diego\n\nRancho, which included Coronado and North Island, on May 12,1846, by Pio Pico,\n\nthe Mexican governor, as his personal wedding present. The Carrillos had five\n\nchildren, but the marriage does not seem to have been an especially happy one.\n\nIn February 1854 Cave Couts, Josefa’s brother-in-law, wrote Abel Stearns that\n\nhe had to pick up Josefa from the steamer as Pedro was \"neglecting her most\n\ngrossly,\" and that they were considering suing f or divorce.\n\nJuan José, the son of Pedro and Josefa, was educated at Holy\n\nCross in Worcester, Massachusetts. Juan, who had married Francisca Roldan on\n\nOctober 7, 1868, moved his family to Santa Monica. There he worked as a\n\nbookkeeper, railroad worker, a waterworks superintendent, a livery stable\n\nowner, judge, and the city’s first mayor.\n\nJuan José’s son, Leo, was a famous television star, who\n\nplayed Pancho in the Cisco kid series. Leo’s brother, Jack, became a world famous\n\nengineer – the builder of Idlewild Airport.\n\nJuan Bandini met Abel Stearns in 1829. Stearns had been\n\nexiled from California by Governor Victoria, taut due to a storm off the coast\n\nof Catalina Island, Stearns had been forced to land at San Diego for repairs on\n\nhis ship. Stearns, the son of Levi and Elizabeth Stearns, and a native of\n\nLunenburg, Massachusetts, immediately joined\n\nthe anti-Victoria revolt that Bandini had been planning. As a result of their\n\ncollaboration, Juan and Abel became good friends and steadfast political allies.\n\nIn May, 1841, Abel married Juan’s sixteen-year old daughter, Arcadia.\n\nAbel Stearns was always a good friend, a kind husband, but he\n\nhad a hot temper and violent prejudices. Because of his ugliness, he was known as\n\n\"Cara de Caballo,\" horse face. He was a shrewd business-man and soon\n\nbecame one of the wealthiest men in California, In fact, the commerical life of\n\nsouthern California revolved around Stearns. His warehouse, \"La Casa de San\n\nPedro,\" was one of the four principal ports of trade in nineteenth century\n\nWestern America.\n\nAlthough Juan had arranged the marriage between Abel and\n\nArcadia, the marriage was a happy one. Arcadia was fond and proud of Abel.\n\nArcadia and Abel’s home, built in 1859 in Los Angeles, was called \"El Palacio,\"\n\nand soon became the political and social center of Los Angeles. Abel died in San\n\nFrancisco in the Grand Hotel on August 23, 1871.\n\nAfter Abel’s death, Arcadia married Robert S. Baker, a native\n\nof Rhode Island, the founder of Bakersfield, and a sheep rancher. When Arcadia\n\ndied on September 15, 1912, she was one of the richest women in America.\n\nIf Arcadia’s life lacked romance, the life of her younger\n\nsister, Isidora, made up for it. In 1846 the whole town buzzed with excitement\n\nover the entry of the American army into San Diego. Isidora,Juan’s youngest\n\ndaughter, described by Lt. John McHenry Hollings worth as \"the most perfect\n\ncoquette I ever saw,\" leaned so far over the balcony to watch the procession of\n\nthe American Black Dragoons, sent to protect the California missions,\n\nthat she fell from the balcony into the arms of Colonel Cave Johnson Couts.\n\nCouts, \"straight as an arrow, willowy and active, a perfect\n\nhorse-man, with the natural instincts of a gentleman… .the soul of honor….\n\njovial and genial, fond of jokes, music and dancing, was born near Springfield,\n\nTennessee, on November 11, 1821.\n\nHe was educated under the supervision of his maternal uncle,\n\nCave Johnson, who served as post-master general under President Polk and later\n\nas president of the State Bank of Tennessee. Cave graduated from West Point in\n\n1843 and gained fame for his bravery in the Mexican-American war.\n\nAfter this spectacular saving of Isidora’s life, Cave\n\nreturned frequently to the Bandini home, and the \"romance blossomed under the\n\nlanguage of the eyes, since they did not speak the same language at that time.\"\n\nCave served as a judge in San Diego for two years after his marriage. Then in\n\n1853, the couple moved to Guajome Rancho, which had been given to them as\n\na wedding present by Abel Stearns, Isidora’s brother-in-law.\n\nThe family that grew up on this estate was a happy one. From\n\nthe letters that Cave wrote to Stearns it is apparent that he had the same\n\nproblems that any father has: their first child, Abel Stearns, died and Cave had\n\nto send Isidora away from the ranch because \"every plaything of Abilito that she\n\ncome across, she has a cry and had cried so much that her lips were swollen and\n\nvery sore.\" Nancy swallowed poison.\n\nCave died on June 10, 1874. Isidora died in Los Angeles on\n\nMay 23, 1897, in the apartment of her sister, Arcadia Baker. After Isidora’s\n\ndeath, Guajome passed to Cave J. Couts, Jr., who had attended college in\n\nTennessee and had become a surveyor for the Southern\n\nPacific railroad. Cave junior \"maintained the air of Spanish hospitality as much\n\nas possible in the changing conditions of the Twentieth Century, and has\n\nrightly been called the ‘last of the Dons’ in San Diego county.\" He maintained\n\nthe ranch until his death on July 15, 1943.\n\nMaría Antonia, the second child of Cave and Isidora, married\n\nChalmers Scott on November 18, 1874. Chalmers Scott was a famous lawyer and\n\nengineer. Maríá and Chalmers had eleven children. The blond Arcadia was reared\n\nby Arcadia Baker, her great-aunt. Arcadia, therefore, led the life of a \"fashionable\n\nand sought-after belle\" and studied piano in Paris under Paul de Reszke. In\n\n1912 Arcadia Scott married John Jerome Brennan of Pennsylvania, whom she had met\n\nduring a brief visit to the East Coast. They \"knew at first sight that they\n\nbelonged together.\" John Brennon became one of San Diego’ s famous judges. The\n\ncouple had two children Martita Antonia, who married Alfredo Bandini Johnson,\n\na descendant of Juan by his second marriage to Refugio Argüello, and John\n\nJerome.\n\nJuan’s youngest child, Juan Bautista, counted as\n\na useless ranch worker by his brothers-in-law, Abel Stearns and Charles Johnson,\n\nbecame managing editor of the Los Angeles Herald. His daughter, Arcadia,\n\nmarried John T.Gaffey on June 1, 1887. John Gaffey was \"a brillant and entertaining\n\nIrishman with scholarly tastes and a leading San Pedro real estate owner. His\n\nother daughter, Mary Dolores, married on June 22, 1887, W. Russell Ward, an\n\nEnglishman of the famous family of English book publishers. Dolores became a\n\nfavorite in Queen Victoria’s court.\n\nIn 1835 Juan Bandini married Refugio Argüello. Refugio was considerably\n\nyounger than Juan and she \"resented the five children of his first\n\nfamily and was extremely jealous of his first deceased wife.\" Juan and Refugio\n\nhad five children: Alfredo, Juan de la Cruz, Dolores, Arturo, and Margarita.\n\nDolores married Charles Robinson Johnson, a cattle\n\nauctioneer and before his marriage a famous playboy. Arturo Bandini was quite a\n\nscholar; he lived in a \"simple Los Angeles home filed with books and manuscripts\n\n– the quiet life of a scholar and collector.\" Arturo was the author of several\n\nbooks, including Navidad, a description of Christmas in Old California,\n\nHis wife, Helen Elliott Bandini, too, was a scholar; she wrote a History of\n\nCalifornia."
