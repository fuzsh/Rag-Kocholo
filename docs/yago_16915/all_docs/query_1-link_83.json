Crest, a cock starling\n\nproper. A coat of arms similar to this formerly belonged to the occupants\n\nof the old Sterns homestead in Watertown; and there is now a similar one\n\nbelonging to a branch of the Manning family in Cambridge (descendants of\n\nIsaac Stearns), from which the accompanying illustrations are taken. It\n\nis the same as that borne by families of the name of Sterne in the counties\n\nof Bucks, Cambridge, Hertford, and Norfolk, England; the same also as that\n\nborne by Richard Sterne, Archbishop of York, who was descended from the\n\nSternes of Nottinghamshire.\n\nIt is probable that all the families of the name of Stearns in the United\n\nStates are descended from three early immigrants; as, in every instance, where\n\nthe lineage of a family has been traced back, it has been to one of the follow-\n\ning, viz., Isaac Stearns or Charles Stearns who settled in Watertown; or\n\nNathaniel Stearns who settled in Dedham.\n\np.451\n\nIsaac Stearns, in his Will calls Charles \"my kinsman,\" probably his nephew.\n\nWhat affinity there was between Nathaniel Stearns and the other two, has not\n\nbeen ascertained; but there is reason to suppose that he was related to them.\n\nOn May 17, 1662, Thomas Clark sold a lot of land in Boston, bounded south east\n\nby land of Daniel Sternes (Suffolk Deeds, IV., p. 268). This is the only re-\n\ncord or notice of this Daniel Sternes, that I have met with. There are families\n\nof the name of Starn or Stern in the middle and southern states who\n\nare of German origin.\n\nThe orthography of the name, Stearns, now, with very few exceptions, adopted\n\nby the descendants of Isaac Stearns, Charles Stearns and Nathaniel Stearns\n\nis undoubtedly a variation, or a corruption of the name, Sterne, which has\n\nbeen effected in this country. It probably commenced in the pronunciation,\n\nand afterwards extended to the writing, of the name.\n\nSterne is a well-known name in the counties of Nottingham, Berks, Norfolk,\n\nHertford, Suffolk and Cambridge in England; but the name, Stearns, has not\n\noccurred to me in any English work.\n\nIn Winthrop's Journal, and in the early\n\ntown and county records, the name is written Sterne. In the Will of the first\n\nIsaac Stearns, dated 1671, the name has the correct orthography, with the ex-\n\nception or addition of a superfluous terminal \"s\", sometimes used in England.\n\nA very few now write their names Sterns and Starns.\n\nIsaac Stearns came to America in 1630 in the same ship, as there is reason to\n\nbelieve, with Governor John Winthrop and Sir Richard Saltonstall and settled\n\nin Watertown near Mount Auburn* (see below)\n\nHe was admitted freeman May 18, 1631 which is the earliest date of any such\n\nadmission, and he was Selectman several years. In 1647, he and Mr. Biscoe,\n\nwere appointed by the Selectmen \"to consider how the bridge over the river\n\nshall be built, and to agre with the workmen for doing it, according to their\n\nbest discretion.\" This is, says Dr. Francis in his history, \"the first mention\n\nof a bridge over the Charles River, at Watertown.\"\n\nIsaac Stearns died June 19, 1671 leaving a widow, Mary*,(see insert below) who died April 2, 1677.\n\nThe births of only three of his children are recorded in the town records, and\n\nit is probable that he came from the Parish of Nayland in Suffolk, England.\n\nHis pedigree has not been ascertained, nor is it certainly known what town he\n\ncame from; but it is very probable that he came from the Parish of Nayland\n\nin Suffolk, England. Mr. Somerby obtained the following extract from the Parish Register of Nayland, England:\n\n\"Baptized Jan 6, 1626, Mary, dau. of Isaac Sternes\n\nBaptized Oct 5, 1628, Anna, dau. of Isaac Sterns.\"\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTwo Tombstones at the old Watertown Mass.

Bellow' fort were in a state of great anxiety as to the result,\n\nfearing that Kilburn and his family had been killed. The anxiety of Uncle Peter was\n\nso great that he determined to ascertain their fate if possible, and for that purpose\n\nhe left the fort late in the evening and alone, to pass through what was then an un-\n\nbroken wilderness, and filled, as might be supposed, with Indians. He crept through,\n\nusing all the caution of a hunter and at length arrived safely at Kilburn's house; and\n\nhaving carefully reconnoitered and ascertained that it was still held by Kilburn, he\n\nasked and obtained admittance and was the lst to congratulate him upon his successful\n\ndefence.\n\n\"He was distinguished for wit as well as for courage and could furnish very\n\ngood company to any body disposed to a merry time. I have heard that he was famous\n\nfor the point and readiness of his repartees which he could even put into very\n\ngood rhyme at short notice; and among these witticisms was his own epitaph which is\n\ndescribed to me as exceedingly funny and smart, but I have not been able to\n\nrecover it\" The Doctor adds to this account. \"He was left many highly\n\nrespectable descendants.\n\np.285 The children of Peter and Mary (Chase) Bellows:\n\n1.

Edward Stearns of Billerica & Bedford, was born May 9, 1726; died June 11, 1793, son of John Stearns of Billerica and his wife, Esther Johnson, dau of Capt. Edward Johnson of Woburn, Mass.\n\nCapt. Edward Stearns m. 1755, Lucy Wyman, dau of Thomas & Rachel (Stearns)\n\nWyman. She died Nov 28, 1802 and he died in Bedford, Mass. June 11, 1793.\n\nHe was in the fight at Concord, 1775, and upon the death of Capt. Wilson*,\n\nhis brother-in-law (who m. a daughter of Samuel Stearns), and who was shot\n\nby the British in their retreat, the command of the Bedford militia devolved\n\non him. The command was confirmed but he declined to continue in it.\n\nInsert:\"In this action the regulars have lost in all, sixty-five killed, one hundred and eighty wounded, and twenty-eight made prisoners. Of the provincials, fifty have been killed, thirty-four wounded, and four are missing. The following officers and gentlemen are of the number: ?Justice Isaac Gardner, of Brookline; Capt. Isaac Davis, of Acton; Captain Jonathan Wilson, of Bedford; Lieut. John Brown, and Sergt. Elisha Mills, of Needham; and Deacon Josiah Haynes, of Sudbury, killed; Capt. Eleazer Kingsbury, of Needham; Captain Samuel Williams, of Cambridge; Captains Charles Mills, Nathaniel Barrett, and George Minot, of Concord; Capt. Oliver Barnes, and Deacon Aaron Chamberlain, of Chelmsford, wounded.\n\n\"Captains John Ford and Oliver Barrow, and Deacon Davis, all of Chelmsford, distinguished themselves in the course of the day. It can be fully proved that Captain Ford killed five regulars. James Howard, a private in the Acton company, and a regular, coming out of a house, caught sight of each other, and discharged their pieces at the same instant; both shots taking effect, the last dropped down dead, and the first expired a few hours after. A big boy joined in the chase of the retreating troops and was very expert in firing at them; at length a ball from the enemy grazed his head, and produced a flesh wound; he soon recovered the shock, bound up his head with a handkerchief, and renewed his pursuit.\n\n\"?Gordon's American Revolution, vol. i., p. 326\n\nhttp://www.historycarper.com/resources/battles/lexington.htm\n\nChildren of Capt.
