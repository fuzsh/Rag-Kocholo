        "text": "THE DISMAL SCIENCE DEPT./\n\nTHE DOWNTOWN BEAT\n\nRIDE A PAINTED PONY, LET THE SPINNING WHEEL SPIN\n\nThe pobladores, I’ve read, awoke at dawn’s first light singing the Alabado: the first riser, singing out to the sky, would wake the others who joined in. The whole pueblo was up and singing by the end, praising God for the day just beginning. Then, a shot of aguardiente for the short walk from their casa to their allotments across the river. These were happy farmers; and at least one of their fields was put into wheat or barley. Patient Reader, close your eyes and hear the Alabado, courtesy of the monks of St. Anthony’s Seminary.\n\nIn 1825 an earthquake shifted the course of the LA River south, away from the cradle of the bluffs. It was a gift from San Gabriel of the Temblors to the Queen of Angels. LA was safer from flooding and had all this fat wet arable bottomland with southern exposure a sombrero’s toss away from the farmers’ corredores. With the river gone south, the Zanja Madre was re-engineered. The exposed wetlands were ditched and dredged and channeled, and by the 1830s the citizen-farmers filled this bottomland with vineyards, fruit orchards, the staple grains, and corn and bean and squash fields. The zanja had a big wheel upstream, relentlessly hauling the water up to the high point of the bluff. From there, it flowed downhill along the line of bluffs to the Plaza.\n\nThe first commercial grist mill in the Pueblo de Los Angeles was set up on North Spring Street sometime in the 1830s; it was traditionally known as “Stearns’ Mill.” Its power came from the flowing water of the Zanja Madre, and its name came from the power and wealth of Don Abel Stearns. Long tradition holds the mill was one of his ventures. He had arrived from Boston in 1831, with excellent credit connections in Monterey, to start a career as a mercantile tycoon, land baron, and Anglo-Mexican powerbroker. Eventually in 1839 he became a naturalized Mexican citizen, no longer just a resident foreign concessionaire. Which meant he could own land and businesses, and be eligible for land grants if they came up (they did). AND, he could marry 14-year-old Arcadia Bandini, the most vivacious and brilliant of the hijas del pais, who had huge…tracts of land. They became the richest folks in town; their adobe casa was dubbed “El Palacio;” it had a hundred-foot ballroom! The “de Stearnses” were social doyennes the city long remembered.\n\nBut Abel Stearns was not a miller, or a hydro-engineer. On the other hand, there WAS a local who knew all of this, so today historians believe the millwright was the famous…\n\nDon Jose must actually have been the one who built and ran the mill, and probably owned half of it. He was California’s most famous millwright, well-married, resident in LA for a few years already, Mexican by naturalization, well connected and trusted. In the 1830s, Chapman is growing Mission grapes right down in the river bed there already. Almost certainly, he dressed his vines while figuring in his head how the Zanja, if they put it up there on those bluffs, could be harnessed for irrigation and power. It could have been only he, who could have engineered the mill run from the Zanja, and set up the machinery. “Chapman’s Mill” — as we might call it — was an entrepreneurial idea he probably nursed for years. But it remained “a project” while there was no capital in Los Angeles, only cow-hides. Capital and international credit only arrived in LA with Horse-Face (as the Californios dubbed Stearns, Cara de Caballo.)\n\nRecords are scanty, but it seems likely that Stearns must have been the backer of the mill, and Chapman probably the owner; it was a year before Stearns would even have the legal right, yet, to undertake a civic venture. I haven’t yet found any record that Stearns and Chapman were associated in business, but they were both successful Angelenos transplanted from Boston and married into important Californio families. It seems likely in fact, that a friendship with Chapman must have eased Stearns’s introductions to, and success with, the Californians from his first arrival in 1831. Dona Guadelupe was charming and popular and social; she would have been quick to host a newly-arrived fellow Bostonian.\n\nIn 1835 under Gov. Pio Pico, Los Angeles emerged as the provincial capital, and officially La Ciudad de Los Angeles, the City of the Angels. It was a power shift away from Monterey; political activities and commercial prospects were enhanced in LA. Pico was intent on breaking the economic power of the Missions and secularizing their assets. It was the new civic regime, I hazard, that gave Stearns and Chapman the approvals to re-jigger the zanja and set up the mill in town. We know it was finished and operating in 1838. By then, San Gabriel Mission was already in serious decline anyway, and a new mill in town must have been a huge capital improvement. It seems like a tiny step, but it firmly and, forever, sealed LA’s role as the economic and industrial and distributional center of Southern California.\n\nTo ease shipping of goods, including flour from the mill, Stearns invested capital in building a road to the port at San Pedro. This is today the Alameda Corridor — and Alameda Street just happens to run right next to the mill. Stearns established stores — shops — LA’s first — one in town and one at the port, with a horse-drawn wagon haulage service in between to meet the Boston ships. (No more sluggish ox-drawn caretas.) Don Abel thus established LA’s future policy of exploiting San Pedro as the only deep-water port it had access to.\n\nChapman died in 1848, soon after the U.S. conquest. I conjecture here that Stearns, surviving partner, or possibly acting on behalf of Guadelupe, arranged, In 1850, the sale of the mill on the Zanja to Americans who named it “Eagle Mills.” During the half-century the mill ground flour under the Eagle emblem, Los Angeles blossomed as America’s most productive, most industrially advanced, farm town, with among other crops, a massive wheat industry. The mill was sold again in 1883 to Jacob Loew, who re-launched the complex as “Capitol Milling.” This is when most of the complex was built, surrounding, absorbing, and superseding the structures built in the 1830s, 1840s, 1850s and 1860s.\n\nDuring this time, the railroads moved into the old river bed to get access to LA’s produce at the source. This was a cash cow for the lucky mill owners, but it became a grim example of the Machine In The Garden, a cautionary tale about extracting so much “value” from productive land, that we destroy it. More on the railroads, in the next and last part; but here’s what that gentle bend of bluffs and wet bottomland looked like by the dawn of the 20th Century:\n\nThe Loew family ran and grew the business for 110 years, only finally closing it in 1998 when the Southern Pacific closed the adjacent railyards that were, partly, built to serve it. It sat derelict while the Cornfield site was developed into the park and the re-development of the area began.\n\nThe derelict mill-site was bought by the Riboli family, the good people of San Antonio Winery, founded in 1917. They are the last vintner left in the once-vineyard-laced, then once-railroad-laced, bottomland where Jose Chapman founded the wine industry, and set up LA’s first mill.\n\nIt’s amazing and heartening that a family food business is investing in a sensitive and imaginative downtown historical redevelopment in downtown LA. This series on milling came about because I was so delighted by the way the architects, Workshop Design Collective out of So. Pasadena, handled the renovations of this complex and I wanted to know more about the old building.\n\nThe main feature is supposed to be a great food hall, with mixed office and retail and dining. Unfortunately, of course, the building was to have opened in the spring this year, but that was just when Covid-19 was rearing its coughing head. For now, the building sits in suspended animation, beautiful and empty and waiting, like all of us, for its next phase of life.\n\nNEXT PART: “The Los Angeles Farming and Milling Co.”\n\nOLD STOCK: I visited here back in December; I had a great time, but I thought the pics were too gloomy to share. Well, today we’re having the same gloom, and if I went today it would look just like this; so enjoy this post AS IF it were today. [“It’s Today!” — Mame Dennis.]\n\nDown on what was once the sloping bank of the LA river, just above, and north, of where it used to flow past the LA Plaza; and right off the shoulder, as it were, of Chinatown; lies a length of land along the railroad tracks that was used by the Santa Fe Railroad for a half century or more, to store old rolling stock.\n\nHere’s the State Parks’ history; and another from the DWP — both fascinating, fascinating.\n\nhttps://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=25964\n\nhttps://waterandpower.org/museum/Early_City_Views%20(1800s)_Page_1.html\n\nEarly, the site had been used by the pobladores to grow maize, which consistently still sprouted there; or else, alternate legend went, the early 20th c. Mexican population in nearby Aliso Gardens would guerrilla-farm maize, on plots scratched between the tracks. The two legends don’t conflict; nor does the legend that the left-over kernels from box cars used to haul corn sprouted (though much less likely to me; wheat, not corn, would sprout there.) But whatever, this long agro-industrial lot was called alternately, one of the two epithets in the title above.\n\nThen the railroad was going to sell it for a 66-shed shipping warehouse complex. The citizens of Chinatown, and other nearby struggling neighborhoods like Chavez Ravine and Frogtown, fought and fought and (this a damn RAILROAD, remember, even in the 21st century they are thieves) fought and fought and fought for YEARS, and finally three years ago they won, and as of about a year ago, this is the emerald they have won for all Angelenos, Los Angeles State Historic Park. Ole.\n\nArchaeologically, this site is very important, for they discovered the original Zanja Madre, the “Mother Ditch” of Los Angeles, the original 1781 waterworks channel laid out by the pobladores to channel water from tanks upstream, near Elysian Park, along the wide but dry bed of the river, and into (and out of) a cistern the center of the Plaza.\n\nBecause of the upstream advantage, there was a huge water wheel somewhere here for power-pumping. And the site was chosen by Don Abel Stearns to build the first flour mill in California, 1828 (?) right there on Spring Street with its wheels in the zanja channel, somehow contrived. (Don Abel; Yankee; not Jewish.) It continued as “Capitol Mills,” got generally absorbed into Chinatown for 80 years, and is now being renovated for condos. Thank the Angels they didn’t tear it down.\n\nThrilling to me, is that they have given downtown a glimpse of a re-wilded stream course, very chic, with granite benches down in the stream bed (instead of river boulders) and plenty of native plants, including tules, above.\n\nMost exciting of all, is that they gave over a long stretch of (well-irrigated) ground to planters holding an orchard of Valencia oranges, only a mile upstream from William Wolfskill’s Orchard, where the strain was developed in the 1860s, out of old Mission stock and fancy, smuggled strains brought by the Chinese. That there is a Valencia grove here, thriving for the community, within the very same river bottom and microrhyzal network from which the fruit first sprung, makes my heart sing.\n\nThey have graced the outside of each planter with a pithy reminiscence from the old-time locals who lived here, and who fought for this place, and who came to Los Angeles and made it better. Bless them, Angels.\n\nMusic was central to life in early Los Angeles. Musician-farmers were actively recruited – “a beneficial profession” – by Gov. Felipe de Neve to be among the pobladores of LA. Music was played and sung by all classes of people daily at home. Richard Henry Dana wrote that he’d never heard people with such beautiful voices as in Alta California. And in church, the Mission Indian choirs became famous among amazed European visitors for their perfect pitch and Roman Latin in the masses and motets. Traditional Mexican tunes were at the center of all civic ceremonies and events; a wedding or a fandango could go on for a week.\n\nThe Avila Adobe curators have done a fine job of displaying the musicophilia of early Los Angeles.The guitar and castanets were caballero arts that connected a striving frontier Don and Dona with the graces of Hispanic traditional culture. Violins, concertinas, flutes and fiddles came on Boston ships and with Boston sailors to San Pedro, and brought in French and German and Italian and English classical dance music, galops and intermezzi, airs and reels. Of pianos, there were only one or two in the whole province, until the wealthy ranching period after the Gold Rush put them in many salas, where they would be eagerly shown off to visitors hoping to find someone who could play them.\n\nCOME FOLLOW THE BAND — HOW CMDR. STOCKTON MOVED IN\n\nIn January, 1847, the house served as headquarters for Naval Commander Robert F. Stockton, when he retook the enemy capital, “The Angels,” after a bloody march up from San Diego. Like most Angelenos, Encarnacion Avila had fled with her family as the Norte Americanos marched in to occupy Alta California’s capital to the martial swing of a Marine Band.\n\nThe legend goes that Dona Avila left the shuttered house in the care of a servant boy, warning him strictly not to let anyone in. As the lively marches, polkas and airs drifted down Vines Street from the Plaza, the spellbound boy, who had never heard a brass band or Yankee music before, couldn’t help himself. He crept out and drifted up to the Plaza to watch the Mexican colors torn down and the Stars and Stripes run up. Just then, Stockton’s quartermaster stalked down Vines Street, hunting for provender; he saw the open door, and peeked into the sumptuous sala. By ancient common law — the law of the unlocked door — he entered and commandeered the adobe on the spot for Stockton’s personal bivouac.\n\nAs downtown Los Angeles boomed and degenerated into “Los Diablos” in the 1860s, 70’s, and 80’s, the Avila-Sepulveda-Rimpau family reluctantly abandoned downtown (like all the old Californio families). They thus became unwitting absentee landlords of an urban slum, renting out the adobe as a cheap flop-house and more or less forgetting it existed. The City finally condemned the property in 1928. (For more on “absentee landlordism in California”I refer Patient Reader to Henry George’s “Progress and Poverty.”)\n\nCHRISTINE STERLING MOVES IN — “MOTHER OF OLVERA STREET”\n\n“Today I stood in the silent rooms, saw the crumbling walls, the boarded-up windows, the dirt and neglect. I remember taking from the public library a book on the “History of Los Angeles.” It was a picture of this old house labeled “American headquarters in 1847.” I walked out into the patio. The fine old pepper trees were now just barren stumps. A pile of rotting garbage replaced the flowers which once blossomed there. But in spite of it all, the spirit of those men and women who lived and loved here in this old home still lingered about the place.“\n\n— Christine Sterling’s diary, 1928\n\nPatient Reader might remember the story of how Christine Sterling, an educated and artistic San Francisco widow/divorcee, came upon the Avila Adobe with a sign declaring it “Condemned by Order of the City.” Remember how all her romantic swirling dreams of Old California, what Carey McWilliams dubbed “the Spanish Fantasy Past,” became crystalized in that moment, in her fight to save the Avila Adobe, and preserve Olvera Street. “I closed my eyes,” she wrote later, “and thought of the Plaza as a Spanish-American social and commercial center, a spot of beauty as a gesture of appreciation to México and Spain for our historical past.” Desperate to save the adobe from demolition, she posted her own hand-written sign beside the red-tag.\n\n“Let the people of Los Angeles show honor and respect to the history of their city by making sacred and inviolate the last of the old landmarks and that spot where the city of Los Angeles was born.”\n\nRecall how she convinced the Rimpau heirs to give her a long-term lease on very generous terms. Ponder how her vision became diluted and adulterated by racism and commercialism and ego. Then recall how Ms. Sterling, essentially by the same “Open Door” policy that served Stockton, subtly just moved in to the Avila Adobe when her own times got hard, and lived in its cool shady recesses until her death in 1962. She was certainly the longest-dwelling tenant the building ever knew. Since she kept it more or less open as a living museum during her residence, I don’t think anybody really minded. But it was her “cultural appropriation” that justified the actual appropriation. The acceptance of Anglo Los Angeles that it has always been the historic center of Mexican culture in America, began when Christine Sterling felt the spirits of Old California stomping around the Avila Adobe, as they always have."
