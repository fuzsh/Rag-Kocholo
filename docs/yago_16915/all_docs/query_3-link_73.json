        "text": "Must we accept or stand up? You decide. Nefarious: Merchant of Souls is a hard-hitting documentary that exposes the disturbing trends of modern-day slavery. From the first scene, Nefarious gives an in-depth look at the human trafficking industry, showing where slaves are sold (often in developed, affluent countries), where they work, and where they are confined. With footage shot in over nineteen different countries, Nefarious exposes the nightmare of slavery as experienced by hundreds of thousands daily, through the eyes of both the enslaved and their traffickers. Nefarious features expert analysis from international humanitarian leaders, and captures the gripping and triumphant testimonies of survivors in order to galvanize hope and vision.

In this post I'm talking about Americans with ancestry from numerous, distinct Asian countries. I could just as easily make a post about Indigenous people or Latinx folks. We need to talk about the very recent US massacre of countless Vietnamese, Cambodian, and Korean people in our illegal foreign wars. We need to talk about the brutality and genocide during the 400 year white occupation of South Asia and the US racial exclusion acts of the 20th century. We need to talk about the folks forced to build US railroads and much of Canada's infrastructure, and their descendants. We need to talk about the bloody US occupation and decades long meddling in Afghanistan, as well as the US interventions that created and funded the Taliban. We minimize the US government putting Americans of Japanese descent in concentration camps and stealing their property. Many of these victims are still alive today! Anyone remember Sulu from Star Trek? The actor's real life story of his family being imprisoned for their skin color is heartbreaking. We often disregard the everyday racial violence and hatred against Asian American people because it doesn't fit into the Black vs white narrative. It needs to stop and we need to keep speaking out. Please take a moment to listen to the attached piece where a friend was interviewed. #stopasianhate #asianamericans\n\n🚀 Embark on an Incredible Journey into the Heart of Darkness: \"Inside 'Ndrangheta – Revealing the World's Most Powerful Mafia\" 🌍 📖 Discover the Secrets: Dive deep into this enigmatic world at (https://lnkd.in/eh-BBUyY) 🕵️♂️ Have you ever wondered what drives the most powerful mafia in the world?
