He is wearing a dark jacket, dark vest, dark bowtie, and lightly-colored shirt. He has short dark hair parted at left.\"Bandini was born in Lima, Peru, in 1800 and died in Los Angeles in 1859. He came to California in about 1819 with his father, who was a captain of a Spanish ship. Juan was well educated and a man of good ability. He was a member of the assembly and sub-comisario of revenues from 1828 to 1831, was in several revolutions against Mexican governors and in 1837 took a force from his San Diego ranch and captured Los Angeles, seizing the garrison and guns without serious opposition. After the Mexican War began, he took sides with the Americans and rendered valuable service throughout.
