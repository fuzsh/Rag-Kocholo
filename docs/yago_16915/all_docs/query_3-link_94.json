Separated from the north by a gully which today is occupied by the Santa Monica Freeway, Ocean…",

        "text": "Wadsworth and Hollister purchase the north end of the Central Beach tract and develop it for residential use. Apparently leasing of the land continued on this portion, as they announce that “after the expiration of leases of the parties now occupying the cottages along the front of their tract, the cottages would be torn down and sightly buildings erected in their place.”\n\nDudley sells his half interest in the Ocean Park Improvement Company to Fraser, Gage and Merritt Jones.\n\nIt was announced that no more lots would be leased and that leasers would be given until May 1st, to purchase their lots or vacate. Hereafter lots would only be sold with building restrictions which would put an end to the building of cheap “beach cottages.” Many of the lease holders purchased their lots and removed the old buildings to put up modern cottages. To many, however, the prices charged for lots and the building restrictions seemed prohibitive and the cottages were removed to cheaper property. During 1902-03, it was a common sight to find a cottage on wheels moving back from the ocean front to the hills.\n\n“There are seven hundred cottages at Ocean Park. They are all tasteful and many of them are pretentious. Ocean Park is not a place with a stiff, ceremonious air. There is a hospitable individuality, a generous atmosphere, in their architecture that shows as much as anything else that the good people of Ocean Park are not divided into social cliques or factions.” June 12th, the Los Angeles Saturday Post.\n\nWith the completion of the Los Angeles Pacific’s electric trolley line in October hundreds began visiting the resort.\n\nSanta Fe Railway abandons its line from Inglewood into Santa Monica, on the grounds that it is operating the line at a loss. To assure electric trolley service to Ocean Park from downtown Los Angeles, Kinney forms a partnership with William Spencer Hook, the owner of the rival Los Angeles Traction Company. Although construction of the new line is started, Hook sold out to railroad interests who didn’t want competition.\n\nWilliam Martin, owner of the Martin block, on the corner of Ashland and Main, gives the use of a part of a lot for a fire house and the Board of city trustees provided the lumber for a small building, and bought a fire bell.\n\nThe Washington school house is built on the corner of Ashland and 4th.\n\nThe Ocean Park Villa Tract (4th-Indiana-Lincoln-Westminster) opposite the Country Club is sold in half acre lots which are quickly subdivided and a new residence district grows up. In September, Ocean Park Villa Tract No. 2, 60 acres (Abbot Kinney-Westminster-Lincoln-?) is sold.\n\nE. J. Vawter sells 60 lots on the hill in the vicinity of Hill and 4th.\n\nThe southern part of Santa Monica, commonly known as “Ocean Park,” which was already an important business center as well as a popular summer resort, with the completion of the bath house and the Decatur Hotel, the building of the Masonic block and many other business blocks on Pier Avenue, Marine street and the ocean front began to put on a metropolitan aspect; while the creation of Venice-the “Dream City” of Kinney’s fancy, made the new town of Ocean Park (Venice) the center of attraction for the entire state.\n\nIn February and March, winter storms demolish the entire Abbot Kinney Pier. Venice of America’s grand opening is rescheduled for the July 4th weekend. With only a few hotels open, many tourists stayed at Kinney’s Tent City alongside the Grand Canal.\n\nOcean Park dedicates its enormous indoor heated salt- water plunge also on the July 4th weekend. Looking more like a movie set, the Ocean Park Bath House was one of the most talked about buildings of its day-and a great draw for the beach area. The lavish indoor plunge (heated for those who didn’t take to cooler ocean swimming) was built by A.R. Fraser.\n\nThe bath house is shown here just before completion in 1905.\n\nGateway to the Ocean Park Pier, ca 1905. This promenade of casinos, cafes, and game parlors, eventually became Pier Avenue\n\nThe White Star pier is completed at the foot of Hollister. A good band is installed and a number of “amusements” provided, but there are now so many rival attractions that it was not a paying investment during its first season and is sold in 1906.\n\n2553 3rd Street built.\n\n2617 3rd Street built for John Blanchard."
