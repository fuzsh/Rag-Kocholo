        "text": "50,000 â 15,000 BC People of northeast Asia follow herds of caribou bison & mammoth and migrate across the present day Bering Strait. They move south along ice-fee corridors into the North American continent to what is now California.\n\n12,500 Santa Barbara Islands Are Settled. The Santa Barbara Channel Islands are settled; archaeologists track fire-reddened earth from more than one hundred fire sites from this period.\n\n10,000 Native Americans occupy the basin of Southern California.\n\n7,000 The La Brea Woman is estimated to have lived now. The âLa Brea Womanâsâ skeleton is found in 1914 along with a broken grinding stone and the remains of a domesticated dog, both typical burial objects of the Chumash tribe.\n\n3,000 (also known as Indian writing, picture writing and rock art) in Southern California. Tule Lakeâs âPetroglyph Pointâ is one of most extensive areas noted for them, with over 5,000 individual carvings. Archaeologists estimate that dozens of generations of artists paddled out in canoes, sharp sticks or stones in hand, to leave their mark in the soft volcanic tuff of the region.\n\n200 - 500 Continental drought provokes wide-ranging migration to Southern California.\n\n458 Chinese records note the explorations of monk Hwui Shan who sails the Pacific and possibly reaches the coast of California. He sails north to Japan and the Kamchatka Peninsula, east to the Aleutians (present-day Alaska) and south along the Pacific coast, a region called âFu-Sangâ in Hwui Shanâs narrative of the voyage. The journey is recorded in official documents of the Sung dynasty for the year 499 upon his return to China. Hwui Shan and his party of four other monks reach Fu-Sang around the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD.\n\n1492 August 3 - Christopher Columbus sets sail to find a westward route to the east. On October 12 he becomes the 1st European to set foot in what is now the Dominican Republic.\n\n1510 âCaliforniaâ is first used in the Spanish novel Las Sergas de Esplandian (The Adventures of Esplandian) by Garcia Ordonez Montalvo. Its description of this mythical land is a harbinger of how the Spanish see Native Americans. âKnow that to the right hand of the Indies was an island called California, very near to the region of the Terrestrial Paradise, which was populated by black women, without there being any men among them, that almost like the Amazons was their style of living. These were of vigorous bodies and The Warrior Queen Calafia, strong and ardent hearts and of great strength; the island itself the strongest in steep rocks and great boulders that is found in the world; their arms were all of gold, and also the harnesses of the wild beasts on which, after having tamed them, they rode; that in all the island there was no other metal whatsoever. They dwelt in caves very well hewn; they had many ships in which they went out to other parts to make their forays, and the men they seized they took with them, giving them their deaths, as you will further hear. And some times when they had peace with their adversaries, they intermixed with all security one with another, and there were carnal unions from which many of them came out pregnant, and if they gave birth to a female, they kept her, and if they gave girth to a male, then he was killed.â\n\n1531 La Virgen de Guadalupe Hidalgo makes âmiraculousâ appearances to Juan Diego on the hill of Tepeyac near Mexico City and also imprints her image on his apron as proof of her existence. She is also known as La Virgen Morena in Mexico and an important figure in Mexican American Catholicism and a lightning rod in Southwest politics and art. Her image is everywhereâlook for her!\n\n1542 Juan Cabrillo claims Southern California territory for the Spanish kingdom, beginning over three and half centuries of occupation. The Portuguese-born sailor goes on to âdiscoverâ the Catalina Islands, the sites of San Pedro and Santa Monica, and the Santa Barbara Channel Islands.\n\n1579 Sir Francis Drake claims what is now San Francisco Bay for England.\n\n1620 British colonists establish the Massachusetts Bay Colony.\n\n1769 The Sacred Expedition is launched. The Spanish claim Alta California (present day California) in the âSacred Expedition,â when explorer Gaspar de PortolÃ reaches San Diego. With him are two Franciscan padres, Junipero Serra and Juan Crespi, who record the expedition and found the first mission. The Sacred Expedition is a religious & military project of missionization and colonization on behalf of Spain. Spanish citizenship is earned by Native Americans upon the acceptance of Christianity. Demographers estimate that between 300,000 & 1,000,000 Indians inhabit what is now California on the eve of colonization in the 18th century.\n\n1771 Mission San Gabriel is founded.\n\n1771 Construction begins on what later becomes known as the Gage Mansion in Bell Gardens, the oldest surviving home in Los Angeles County. Francisco Salvador Lugo begins building the adobe walls in 1771 and his son Antonio Maria Lugo receives the land (along with 29,514 acres) in 1780 from King Carlos V of Spain. Francisco and Antonio build the hacienda together. The home is now in the middle of a trailer park and housed within another building for protection.\n\n1779 Teodoro de Croix, Commandant of the Interior Provinces of New Spain, issues instructions on how to recruit original settlers for the founding of the new pueblo. De Croix seeks married men and families who will earn 10 pesos each month and a parcel of land after ten years of settlement.\n\n1781 November 19 - El Pueblo de Nuestra SeÃ±ora la Reina de los Angeles Sobre el Rio de la PorciÃºncula, now the city of Los Angeles, is founded by California governor Felipe de Neve on behalf of King Carlos III of Spain.\n\n1790 The Naturalization Act of 1790 provides the first rules for granting citizenship to the United States; the law limits naturalization to aliens who are \"free white persons.\"\n\n1804 Mission San Gabriel uses Native American labor to plant Californiaâs first orange grove composed of 6 acres and 400 trees.\n\n1810 The population of Los Angeles rises to 354.\n\n1810 â 1821 September 16, 1810 - Catholic priest Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla (\"the father of Mexican independence\") launches the initial rebellion of the Mexican War of Independence, an armed conflict between the Mexican people and Spanish colonial authorities. The populist army nearly captures Mexico City but is defeated at CalderÃ³n. Peasant leaders like JosÃ© MarÃ­a Morelos y PavÃ³n, Mariano Matamoros and Vicente Guerrero lead armies of native and racially mixed revolutionaries against the Spanish and the Royalists. Ultimately, after a decade of loss it is the Royalists--made up of Mexicans of Spanish descent and other conservatives who bring independence. In 1820, liberals take power in Spain and the new government promises reforms to appease the Mexican revolutionaries. In response, Mexican conservatives call for independence as a means of maintaining their privileged position in Mexican society. In early 1821 both sides of the War agree to the Plan of Iguala that establishes Mexico as an independent constitutional monarchy and maintains the Catholic Church as the central religion. There are an estimated 400,000 â 500,000 deaths as a result. The end of this war places California under Mexican rule, otherwise known as the âCaliforniaâ period. Mural by Salvador Almaraz LÃ³pez in 2005.\n\n1824 Mexico issues the Colonization Act of 1824 and provides the legal framework for the subsequent granting of ranchos, which increases after 1833.\n\n1833 The Mexican government begins the secularization of the California missions. Of the missionsâ eight million acres originally designated to converted Native Americans, approximately 500 land grants are created for influential families. Many former Mission Indians migrate to serve as farm labor throughout Southern California; in 1833 there are approximately 170 farms and 112 vineyards.\n\n1837 â 1842 Native Americans plant over 100,000 grape vines for Jean Louis Vignes (for whom Vignes Street is named).\n\n1839 Arcadia Bandini marries Abel Stearns. Born in 1825 in San Diego, Arcadia and her two sisters are considered the most beautiful women of California. The first US flag flown over the plaza in Old Town San Diego on July 29, 1846 is made by Arcadia. At 14 she marries 43-year-old Abel Stearns, one of the wealthiest men in Los Angeles. Stearns dies in 1871 and in 1874 Arcadia marries Colonel Robert Baker, owner of Rancho San Vicente y Santa Monica & they settle in Santa Monica. When Arcadia dies in 1912 she leaves an estate of seven to eight million.\n\n1841 The Workman Rowland Party is the first wagon train traveling across the continent to arrive in California.\n\n1846 June 14 -The California Republic (also called the Bear Flag Republic) is the result of a revolt by Americans in the town of Sonoma against the authorities of the Mexican province of California; the Republic lasts less than a month. The revolt is instigated by John Fremont and then led by William Ide.\n\n1846 -1848 On May 13,1846; the United States recognizes a state of war with Mexico. After the annexation of Texas in 1845, the United States and Mexico fail to resolve a boundary dispute. President Polk declares it is necessary to deploy forces in Mexico to meet a threatened invasion. The Mexican American war results in California becoming part of the United States, along with more than half of former Mexican land. The treaty formally ending the war, the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, becomes an issue of contention in the future as existing Californian rights are not honored. There are an estimated 20,000 deaths as a result of this war. 25. 1847 Lieutenant-Colonel John C. Fremont and General AndrÃ©s Pico sign the Treaty of Cahuenga on the kitchen table of TomÃ¡s Feliz's six-room adobe house at Campo de Cahuenga (now North Hollywood). It allows the Californios who fought under the Mexican Flag to return home after giving up their artillery, and provides that all prisoners from both sides be immediately freed.\n\n1848 Gold is discovered at Sutterâs Mill, California one week before the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo is signed, although news of the discovery does not reach the rest of the world for weeks. The discovery spurs a worldwide migration to California in 1849 and the term â49erâ is born.\n\n1850 Los Angeles County is formed and initially comprises 4,340 square miles. The United States Census for Los Angeles measures its population at 3,530.\n\n1851 In March Francisco âChicoâ Lugo and his brother Francisco âMenitoâ Lugo are charged with the murders of Irishman Patrick McSwiggen and a Creek Indian named Sam in the Cajon Pass. The Lugo teenagers are sons of the wealthiest family in Southern California whose rancho includes much of San Bernardino County, which is then part of Los Angeles County. The Lugo case is the first known use of a jailhouse informant in a criminal case in Los Angeles; the sole witness against the Lugos is Ysidro Higuera, a prisoner in jail when he incriminates the Lugos. His statement is suspicious since the jailer George W. Robinson is an enemy of the Lugo family. The murders in the Cajon Pass occur when the Lugos pursue a band of Ute Indians from Utah who had stolen several hundred of their horses. The Anglo American theory of the murders is that the Lugo boys killed McSwiggen and Sam for misdirecting them in their pursuit of the Utes. Californios believe the twenty members of the pursuit party who say the Lugos could not have committed the murders since they are in full sight the entire time. In April a band of outlaws led by John âRedâ Irving arrives in Los Angeles and camps in the Arroyo Seco. When Irving hears of the Lugo case, he approaches Antonio Maria Lugo and offers to break his grandsons out of jail for a price (rumored to be $10,000). Lugo rejects the proposition and infuriates Irving. Lugoâs lawyer, J. Lancaster Brent, makes a motion for bail in the District Court and when Irving hears of the motion he and his men surround the jail and demand $10,000 or threaten to kill the brothers. Brent organizes a group of Californios to guard them and unexpected help arrives when a group of United States soldiers arrive in the city on a routine march from San Diego. Brent asks the soldiers for assistance and the prisoners arrive safely. The Lugo case is ultimately dismissed by Judge Antonio Olvera of the Court of Sessions in October 1852.\n\n1853 September 24 - The preserved heads of âbanditsâ Joaquin Murrieta and Manual Garcia are sold at auction today for $36 to satisfy a judgment. Joaquin Murrieta is a legendary figure from the early days of the Gold Rush. When he attempts mining, he faces racism and discrimination. He turns to crime and is portrayed as a Mexican patriot who resists American conquest. Murrieta leads a band called The Five Joaquins and together they are allegedly responsible for the majority of cattle rustling, robberies and murders committed in the Mother Lode area of the Sierra Nevadas between 1850 and 1853. In 1853 California Governor John Bigler signs a legislative act creating the \"California State Rangers,\" whose mission is to arrest the Five Joaquins. In July, these rangers encounter a group of Mexican males near Panoche Pass in San Benito County and a confrontation occurs; two of the Mexicans are killedâone claims to be Murrieta and the other Garcia. The Rangers take Garcia's hand and Murrieta's head as evidence of their death and display them in a jar, preserved in brandy. The jar travels throughout California, where spectators can see the remains for $1.00. Seventeen people, including a priest, sign affidavits identifying the remains as Murrieta but a young woman claiming to be Murrieta's sister does not recognize the head and argues does not have her brother's characteristic scar. To complicate matters, numerous sightings of Murrieta are reported after his death. The jar and its contents are destroyed in the 1906 earthquake and fire in San Francisco.\n\n1854 Californiaâs Supreme Court decides People Vs. Hall and prohibits Chinese people from testifying in court on the basis that they are nonwhiteâfollowing an existing California statute.\n\n1856 African American midwife Biddie Mason earns her freedom in California courts, after testing the stateâs status as a âFreeâ state. She settles in Los Angeles and eventually co-founds Los Angelesâ African American Methodist Church. Mason is immortalized in a public art monument at 333 S. Spring Street.\n\n1860 A House Divided. Although California is admitted as a free state in 1850, during the Civil War Los Angeles is a city divided. Asa Ellis (at right), a horticulturist, has two sons who fight for the Confederacy, and a third son who fights on behalf of the Union.\n\n1860 California's famous mail courier service, the Pony Express, begins. It follows a route that starts in Missouri and ends in Sacramento, California. The trips, lasting more than ten days depending on weather conditions, are the first of a kind connecting California's communication system with the Midwest. Riders change mounts at postal stations, which are 15 miles apart. The fastest delivery is a trip in six days, delivering the news of President Abraham Lincoln's assassination.\n\n1864 The Central Pacific Railroad Company recruits thousands of Chinese laborers from the Kwangtung Province in order to build the transcontinental railroad.\n\n1870 California passes a law against the importation of Chinese, Japanese, and Mongolian women for prostitution. This law is followed up by the Page Law in 1875, which extends it to a national level, further stereotyping Asian immigrant women as prostitutes and human chattel.\n\n1871 October 24 - One of Los Angelesâ most violent racial conflicts erupts when two rival tongs, Nin Yung Company and Hong Chow Company disagree over possession of a young woman, Ya Hit. An Anglo police officer, Robert Thompson, intervenes in the conflict and is accidentally shot. Soon after, an Anglo saloonkeeper begins firing randomly at Chinese homes on Calle de los Negros (now Los Angeles Street). As news spreads, a vigilante mob pours into the area, attacks Chinese residents, and burns and loots Chinese property. One of the mob leaders is city councilman, George Fall. Los Angeles tax collector, Marshal Francis Baker is also present and tells participants to, âShoot any Chinese who try to escape.â At the end of the night, 17 Chinese are lynched, and two more subsequently die from complications. Over 500 Angelenos participate in the attack. But the few who are convicted have their convictions overturned on a legal technicality.\n\n1873 Charles Nordhoff publishes California: for Health, Pleasure, and Residence. A Book for Travellers and Settlers extolling Southern Californiaâs ability to cure âConsumptionââthe term then for tuberculosis. Little do his readers know, Nordhoff is paid by the Southern Pacific Railroad to serve as an objective advocate. Hundreds come to the region in search of a cure to the point that Los Angeles builds the first crematorium West of the Rocky Mountains in 1888 at Angelus Rosedale Cemetery in order to attend to the dead.\n\n1877 The nativist Workingmenâs Party is established in California and targets Chinese workers.\n\n1884 Helen Hunt Jackson, a writer and activist for Native Americans in California, writes her famous fictional novel Ramona. Intending it to be the \"Uncle Tom's Cabin of California,\" Ramonaâs most enduring impact is the creation of several regional myths that stimulate tourism in Southern California and obfuscates Jacksonâs original goals of reform. The novel is loosely based on the real life account of Ramona Lubo, whose husband is shot by a white man but Lubo (the only witness to the crime) cannot testify against him due to Californiaâs law. The discovery of Lubo occurs in the early twentieth-century and further exploits Luboâs life as tourists flock to see her, the grave of her husband, and take photographs of âthe realâ Ramona.\n\n1887 The Southern Pacific Rail Road brings over 100,000 people to Southern California, initiating the first of the regionâs many real estate booms. The Southern Pacific Railroad becomes embattled in a price war with the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe with fares dropping from $125 to as low as a $1 from the Midwest to Southern California.\n\n1889 January 4 - Assemblyman E.E. Edwards introduces a bill to separate part of Los Angeles County and create the County of Orange. It is named after its most promising new crop, the orange.\n\n1893 The Bradbury Building is constructed at Third Street and Broadway in Los Angeles. Commissioned by Lewis Bradbury, the building is eventually designed by draftsman George Wyman, who is influenced by the utopian novel Looking Backward (1887) by Edward Bellamy. The novel describes that in the year 2000 the typical office building will be a \"vast hall full of light, received not alone from the windows on all sides, but from the dome, the point of which was a hundred feet above ... The walls and ceiling were frescoed in mellow tints, calculated to soften without absorbing the light which flooded the interior.\" The Bradbury Building is the oldest commercial building in downtown Los Angeles and is featured in many television shows and films.\n\n1898 The United States declares war on Spain. It wins the War and annexes Guam, the Philippines, and Puerto Rico in 1899. The Spanish American War results in approximately 65,000 casualties.\n\n1905 June 19 - Los Angeles Crocker Street residents protest the smell coming from the Saratoga Chip Company at 1144 Crocker Street. Residents complain of the horrible stench of lard and declare it must be hazardous to one's health to reside too close to such a foul odor.\n\n1907 There are over 92 boarding houses in Los Angelesâ âJapan Town,â demonstrating the roots of contemporary Little Tokyo and the bachelor societies that make up the Japanese immigrant community.\n\n1910 February 24 - City Attorney Hewitt rules that Los Angeles city officials can no longer accept free rides on streetcars, except for \"official business.\"\n\n1910 Angel Island opens, and for 30 years serves as a point of entry to the United States for many immigrants. Like Ellis Island in New York, it processes the entry of people from different parts of the world. Unlike Ellis Island, it also serves as a prison for hundreds of Chinese immigrants. The immigration compound at Angel Island is built to enforce an exclusionary law passed in 1882.\n\n1910 - 1911 The Mexican Revolution against autocrat Porfirio Diaz begins and is led by Francisco Madero. The liberal government established under Madero attempts to implement a program of reforms, a notable component is the breaking up of large estates and the parceling out of sections to the landless peasants. In 1913 Madero is assassinated in a counterrevolution on behalf of the landowners, led by General Victoriano Huerta. An estimated 250,000 people die as a result of this war and it signals a period of mass migration northward into the United States of over a million people in order to escape the war torn country.\n\n1913 The California Alien Land Law is passed and prohibits \"aliens ineligible to citizenship\" (applying to all Asian immigrants) from owning land or property, but permits three-year leases.\n\n1916 July 11 - State Fish and Game Commission patrolmen fine those dynamiting fresh and salt-water sources in the hopes of gaining fish. Although not a felony, those caught are fined a minimum of $200.\n\n1920 The 19th Amendment to the Constitution, granting women the right to vote, is signed into law.\n\nThe Cable Act, also known as the âMarried Womenâs Citizenship Act,â is passed, stipulating that any American female citizen who marries an alien ineligible for citizenship (Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, or other men racially ineligible to naturalize) will lose her own citizenship.\n\n1923 July 13 - The Hollywood sign is dedicated on Mount Lee in Griffith Park. Designed by Thomas Fisk Goff, each letter stands at approximately 30 feet wide by 50 feet high and the entire sign costs $21,000. It originally reads âHOLLYWOODLAND,â but by the late 1940s, high maintenance costs cause the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce and the City of Los Angeles Parks Department to eliminate âLANDâ transforming it into the movie industry icon.\n\n1923 The US Supreme Court rules that Japanese & Asian Indians are not eligible for citizenship.\n\n1923 Long known for penning The Jungle (1906), socialist author Upton Sinclair is arrested for reading The Bill of Rights at Liberty Hill at 5th and Harbor in San Pedro during a International Workers of the World strike.\n\n1923 Earle C. Anthony purchases two neon signs from French firm Claude Neon for his Packard car dealership in Los Angeles and introduces neon to the United States.\n\n1924 The National Origins Quota Act barring any âalien ineligible to citizenshipâ calls for a set of permanent regulations that take effect in 1929. The total number of immigrants from outside the Western Hemisphere is restricted to approximately 150,000 annually. The Quota Act of 1924 restricts the number of people to settle in the United States. It limits immigration from Europe in any one year to two percent of the number of each nationality resident in the United States according to the Census of 1890.\n\n1927 May 18 - Grauman's Chinese Theatre opens in Hollywood with Cecil B. DeMille's The King of Kings. A riot breaks out as onlookers try to see the stars entering the theater for the premiere.\n\n1928 Construction on Los Angelesâ City Hall begins. The concrete for the 28-story structure is formed from sand from each of California's 58 counties and water from its 21 missions. A flexible compression zone separates each floor of the 454-foot building. City Hall is the tallest building in LAâs skyline until 1959 when the city lifts its ban on buildings taller than City Hall.\n\n1929 The League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) is formed in Corpus Christi with the merger of three Texas organizations: La Orden de Hijos de America, the Knights of America, and the League of Latin American Citizens. Drawing its support largely from the urban middle class, it seeks to bring Mexican Americans into the main current of American society and combat discrimination in education, jobs, wages, and political representation. Strongly rooted in local communities, it promotes the learning of English, improvements in schools, and political power through voting.\n\n1929 The Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) is formed in California to fight for the civil rights primarily of Japanese Americans but also for the benefit of Chinese Americans and other peoples of color. With limited resources and virtually no experience in state or federal politics, the JACL takes it upon itself to set the course for civil rights for persons of Asian ancestry in the West Coast region of the United States, as well as at the federal level by combating congressional legislation aimed at excluding the rights of Japanese Americans and other Asian Americans. In California alone there are over one hundred statutes that limit the rights of anyone of Japanese ancestry.\n\n1929 The US stock market crashes on Black Tuesday, causing worldwide depression. The Great Depression devastates the nation with high levels of unemployment and economic instabilities. President Franklin D. Rooseveltâs, New Deal seeks national economic recovery. One of the largest agencies under the new presidential order (No. 7034) is the Works Progress Administration (WPA). Between 1935 and 1943, the agency employs thousands of American citizens in an effort to alleviate the economic downturn. The WPA undertakes approximately 12,300 projects and shapes landscapes throughout the nation.\n\n1930 - 1931 Charlotta Amanda Bass institutes the âDonât Shop Where You Cannot Workâ boycott of key Los Angeles businesses, using her newspaper The California Eagle as a way to spread information on racism.\n\n1931 Amendment to the Cable Act declares that no American-born woman who loses her citizenship by marrying an alien ineligible to citizenship can be denied the right of naturalization at a later date.\n\n1931 The Mei Wah (Chinese in America) Club, the oldest Chinese American women's club in Los Angeles is initially created by ten teenage girls who want a basketball team. Mei Wah expands to become a charitable organization, providing financial assistance to the refugees of war-torn China in the 1930s.\n\n1933 Los Angelesâ original Chinatown is demolished to make way for Union Station. New Chinatown opens in1938.\n\n1933 Rose Pesotta leads the International Ladies Garment Workers union of Los Angelesâ garment workers. Two thousand dressmakers meet and rally at the Embassy Auditorium at 851 S. Grand Avenue in downtown.\n\n1934 Upton Sinclair fails in the gubernatorial race as the Democrat after a massive media campaign initiated by the film and newspaper industries. Sinclair's platform End Poverty in California (EPIC) galvanizes the support of the Democratic Party, and Sinclair gains its nomination. Conservatives in California see it as an attempted communist takeover of the state and use political propaganda portraying Sinclair as a communist. Sinclair is defeated by Frank F. Merriam in the election and abandons politics to return to writing, eventually earning a Pulitzer Prize. However, the race of 1934 is known as the first race to use modern multimedia campaign techniques like motion pictures and news agencies. Sinclairâs home in Monrovia is an historic landmark.\n\n1935 Congress passes the Social Security Act and provides for a federal program of benefits to retired workers beginning at the age of 65 and a program of unemployed compensation administered by the state and federal aid to the state for various projects such as maternity and infant care services and assistance to crippled children and the blind.\n\n1938 Harry Raymond, an investigator working with reformer Clifford Clinton (of Cliftonâs Cafeteria on Broadway) investigates corruption in City Hall and the Los Angeles Police Department and is subsequently targeted with a car bomb; he survives the explosion and two Los Angeles Police Department officers are convicted.\n\n1940 County population reaches 2,785,643.\n\n1941 Los Angelesâ first freeway, the Arroyo Seco opens. It runs from downtown to Pasadena.
