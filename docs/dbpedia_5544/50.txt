Lynn Sweet of the Chicago Sun-Times passes along the contents of an invitation from Mark Kirk to his swearing in, which is to occur November 29:

Why is Illinois taking so long, and leaving Rod Blagojevich’s puppet, Roland Burris, D, in the seat for two more weeks? Paperwork. Despite a court case and much to-do about having a separate ballot line for the last few weeks of Obama’s term, Illinois will not certify the results until November 23. To be sure, this is consistent with the court order under which the election was held, but it’s also a sign that their elections process is considerably more backward than that of West Virginia, whose new senator was already sworn in.
