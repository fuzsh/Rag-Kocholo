        "text": "The 2010 United States Senate elections in Illinois took place on November 2, 2010. There were two ballot items for the same seat: a general election, to fill the Class 3 seat beginning with the 112th United States Congress beginning on January 3, 2011, and a special election, to fill that seat for the final weeks of the 111th Congress. Roland Burris, who was appointed to fill the vacancy created by fellow Democrat Barack Obama's election to the presidency, did not run in either election.[1]\n\nThe elections took place alongside 33 other elections to the United States Senate in other states, as well as elections to the United States House of Representatives and various state and local elections in Illinois and other states. The registered party primaries for the full term took place on February 2, 2010, the earliest state primary elections: Republicans nominated U.S. Representative Mark Kirk, Democrats nominated State Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias, and the Green Party nominated journalist LeAlan Jones. The Constitution Party and Libertarian Party submitted signatures to be on the ballot but were challenged; the result of the ensuing hearings was the Constitution Party's candidate being denied placement on the ballot but the Libertarian Party's candidate Michael Labno given ballot access.[2]\n\nOn August 2, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois ruled that the candidates appearing on the ballot for the replacement election would be the ones of the regular election,[1][3] and that the special election would appear after the general election on the ballot.[3] Kirk won both elections and was sworn in on November 29, 2010, resigning his House seat the same day. As of 2024, this was the last time that Republicans won an Illinois U.S. Senate election.\n\nElection information\n\n[edit]\n\nThe primaries and general elections of both the special election and regularly scheduled election coincided with those for House and those for state offices.\n\nBackground\n\n[edit]\n\nVacancy\n\n[edit]\n\nBarack Obama, the former United States Senator holding this seat, was elected President of the United States on November 4, 2008, and subsequently resigned from the Senate on November 16, 2008.[4] Illinois law provides for the Governor of Illinois to appoint replacements for Senate vacancies.[5]\n\nBurris's appointment\n\n[edit]\n\nOn December 9, 2008, the FBI arrested Governor Rod Blagojevich (D) on various corruption charges, most notably allegations that he attempted to sell the appointment to the vacant U.S. Senate seat. On December 31, 2008, Blagojevich nevertheless appointed former Illinois Attorney General Roland Burris to fill the vacancy.[6] After initially seeking to exclude Burris, Senate Democrats relented,[7] and Burris was seated on January 15, 2009.[8]\n\nBurris later declined to run for election.[9]\n\nTurnout\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: 2010 Illinois elections § Turnout\n\nFor the state-run primary elections (Democratic, Republican, and Green), turnout was 21.74%, with 1,652,202 votes cast.[10][11]\n\nFor the general election, the special election saw turnout of 47.24%, with 3,545,984 votes cast and the regularly-scheduled election saw turnout of 49.35% with 3,704,473 votes cast.[10][12]\n\nDemocratic primary\n\n[edit]\n\nAlexi Giannoulias, Illinois Treasurer[13]\n\nDavid H.

The Giannoulias campaign also announced that President Obama was scheduled to attend an August 5 fundraiser for his candidate in Chicago.[40]\n\nKirk and Giannoulias disagreed mostly on fiscal and foreign policy. Kirk voted against Obama's Stimulus package and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. As a Congressman, Kirk originally voted for cap and trade but during the primary campaign announced that if elected a Senator he would vote against it.[41] Giannoulias strongly supported the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act[42] and Obama's stimulus.[43] Kirk opposed the building of the Park 51 Islamic center near Ground Zero of New York City, while Giannoulias stated that \"Americans must stand up for freedom of religion even when it's difficult.\"[44]\n\nLibertarian nominee Michael Labno was added to the ballot by the Illinois State Board of Elections after gaining ballot access by means of citizen petition.[32] Labno, an electrical project construction manager[45] and recruiter for Private Security Union Local 21[46] ran on a platform of downsizing or cutting some Federal agencies and reducing taxes and government regulations. He also supported allowing citizens to opt out of Social Security.[45] Labno is pro-life and supports 2nd Amendment rights. In August 2010, Democratic candidate Alexi Giannoulias declared Labno a legitimate challenge from the right for Mark Kirk. Labno responded on his Facebook fan page, saying \"This is very true Alexi, and you should be afraid too.\"[47] Labno attended the September 18, 2010 Right Nation rally in Hoffman Estates, Illinois headlined by conservative media figure Glenn Beck. While greeting attendees Labno noted that Republican candidate Kirk did not attend.[48] On August 27 the Illinois Board of Elections approved the Libertarian Party's petition to include its candidates on the ballot.[32]\n\nPredictions\n\n[edit]\n\nSource Ranking As of Cook Political Report[49] Tossup October 26, 2010 Rothenberg[50] Tilt R (flip) October 22, 2010 RealClearPolitics[51] Tossup October
