        "text": "Illinois' State Board of Elections is expected to certify the results of the special Senate election on Nov. 23, the Secretary of State's office said Wednesday.\n\nOnce certified, Gov. Pat Quinn and Secretary of State Jesse White will officially sign off that Mark Kirk is the winner.\n\nThat notice is then immediately sent to the Secretary of the U.S. Senate. That body will determine when Kirl will be sworn in, but it will likely be on or before Monday, Nov. 29, when Congress goes back in session.\n\nVice President Joe Biden will do the swearing in.\n\nThe Republican Senator-elect defeated his Democratic challenger, Illinois Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias, in both the regular and the special Senate elections.\n\nThe special election was needed to replace Sen. Roland Burris, who was appointed by then-Gov. Rod Blagojevich to fill the remainder of President Barack Obama's term."
