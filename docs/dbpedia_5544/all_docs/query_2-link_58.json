        "text": "David Daley\n\nWednesday, August 28 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nEqual parts Dark Money and Democracy in Chains, Antidemocratic (Mariner) is a riveting yet disturbing history of the fifty-year Republican plot to hijack voting rights in America, its profound implications for the 2024 presidential election, and the crucial role that Chief Justice John Roberts has played in determining how we vote. In 1981, a young lawyer, fresh out of Harvard law school, joined the Reagan administration’s Department of Justice, taking up a cause that had been fomenting in Republican circles for over a decade by that point. From his perch inside the Reagan DOJ, this lawyer would attempt to bring down one of the defining pieces of 20th century legislation — the Voting Rights Act. His name was John Roberts. Over thirty years later in 2013, these efforts by John Roberts and the conservative legal establishment culminated when Roberts, now Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, wrote Shelby County vs. Holder, one of the most consequential decisions of modern jurisprudence. A dramatic move that gutted the Voting Rights Act, Roberts’s decision — dangerously premised on the flawed notion that racism was a thing of the past — emboldened right-wing, antidemocratic voting laws around the country immediately. No modern court decision has done more to hand elections to Republicans than Shelby. Now lauded investigative reporter David Daley reveals the urgent story of this plot to end the Voting Rights Act and encourage minority rule in their party’s favor. From the bowels of Reagan’s DOJ to the walls of the conservative Federalist Society to the moneyed Republican resources bankrolling restrictive voting laws today, Daley reveals a hidden history as sweeping as it is troubling. Through careful research and exhaustive reporting, he connects Shelby to a well-funded, highly-coordinated right-wing effort to erode the power of minority voters and Democrats at the ballot box — an effort that has grown stronger with each election cycle. In the process Roberts and his conservative allies have enabled fringe conservative theories about our elections with the potential to shape the 2024 election and topple the foundations of our democracy. Timely and alarming, Daley offers a powerful message that, while Shelby was the misguided end of the Voting Rights Act, it was also the beginning of something far darker.\n\nBuy the Book\n\nBrendan Shay Basham in Conversation With Theodore C. Van Alst Jr.\n\nThursday, August 29 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nSuffering the unbearable loss of his little brother, Kai, Damien heads as far south as his old truck and his legs will allow, landing in a fishing village beyond the reach of his past where he hopes to finally forget. But the village carries grief of its own. Mourning the death of a young woman from the community’s most powerful family, they do not trust this stranger new to their town. The object of gossip and suspicion, Damien is ignored by all except the dead woman’s mother, Ana María, who offers him a room and a job. Grateful for her kindness, Damien soon begins to fall under Ana María’s charismatic spell. But how long can he resist the rumors linking her and her daughter’s death? Or deny his strange kinship with one of Ana María’s surviving daughters, Marta, who knows too well the grief that follows the loss of a sibling — and who is driven by a fierce need for revenge? Swiftly, Damien finds himself caught in a power struggle between the brujas, a whirlwind battle that threatens to sweep the whole village out to sea. Resonant with the Diné creation story and the unshakable weight of the Long Walk — the forced removal of the Navajo from their land — Swim Home to the Vanished (Harper Perennial) is a mesmerizingly original tale that brilliantly, poignantly explores our capacity for grief and resilience and its lasting effects on the soul. Brendan Shay Basham’s haunting debut novel is inspired, in part, by Diné history and thought. Basham will be joined in conversation by Theodore C. Van Alst Jr., the Tilikum Professor and Chair of Indigenous Nations Studies at Portland State University and author of Pour One for the Devil.\n\nBuy the Book\n\nHonor Levy in Conversation With Kevin Maloney\n\nTuesday, September 3 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nWalking the wire between imagination and confession, My First Book (Penguin Press) marks the arrival of an electric new talent. Honor Levy’s uniquely riveting voice emerges from the chaos of coming of age in Generation Z. Never far from a digital interface, her characters grapple with formative political, existential, and romantic experiences in a web-drenched society on the brink of collapse. Inventive, ambitious, and frequently surreal, the stories of My First Book are a mirrorball onto the world as it is. Levy illuminates what it is to be at once adorable, special, heavily medicated, consistently panicked, and completely sincere. One protagonist accompanies a girl with too many teeth through an abortion, while another discovers the infinite nature of love, a third reminisces about other sunsets that were “pinker, like way pinker,” and another encounters God in a downtown arcade. To find and keep faith is the order of the day — but how? Levy will be joined in conversation by Kevin Maloney, author of The Red-Headed Pilgrim, Cult of Loretta, and the forthcoming story collection Horse Girl Fever.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nAiden Thomas in Conversation With Prerna Pickett\n\nTuesday, September 3 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s Books at Cedar Hills Crossing\n\nAiden Thomas returns to the beloved world of The Sunbearer Trials in Celestial Monsters (Feiwel & Friends), a heart-stopping duology finale, in which three young semidioses travel through a dark monster-infested world, facing down chaotic Obsidian gods, in a quest to save their friends and return the sun to the sky. Teo never thought he could be a Hero. Now, he doesn't have a choice. The sun is gone, the Obsidian gods have been released from their prison, and chaos and destruction are wreaking havoc on Reino del Sol. All because Teo refused to sacrifice a fellow semidiós during the Sunbearer Trials. With the world plunged into perpetual night, Teo, his crush Aurelio, and his best friend Niya must journey to the dark wilderness of Los Restos, battling vicious monsters while dealing with guilt, trauma, and a (very distracting) burgeoning romance between Teo and Aurelio. Determined to rescue the captured semidioses and retrieve the Sol Stone, the trio races against the clock to return Sol and their protective light so order can be restored. Now the future of the whole world is in their hands. Thomas will be joined in conversation by Prerna Pickett, author of If You Only Knew and My Big, Fat Desi Wedding.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nScott Nadelson & Matt Young\n\nWednesday, September 4 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nScott Nadelson’s Trust Me (Forest Avenue Press) tells the story of a turbulent year in the life of Lewis Nelson and his daughter Skye, who spend their time together at the edge of a fragile wilderness in Western Oregon. As a last-ditch effort to save his marriage, Lewis — an East Coast suburban Jew who has run from his roots — buys a cabin on a wild and scenic river in the Cascade foothills; after the marriage falls apart, he moves to the woods and makes the long commute every morning to Salem, the state capital, where he works a tedious government job. Skye stays with him on weekends, leaving behind her middle-school friends, her cellular service, her cat, and her mom in exchange for ancient trees and clear water and moss-covered rocks. In 52 vignettes — one for each week of the year — that alternate between Lewis’s perspective and Skye’s, the novel traces their days foraging for mushrooms and searching for newts, arguing over jigsaw puzzles and confronting menacing neighbors, hosting skeptical visitors and taking city jaunts, finding pleasure in small moments of wonder and coping with devastating loss. By turns comic and heartbreaking, Trust Me is a study of the uneasy bond between a hapless father and his precocious daughter, of their love for a complex and changing landscape, of the necessity and precariousness of the relationships and places we cherish most.\n\nMatt Young’s End of Active Service (Bloomsbury) is a raw and rampaging debut novel from the author of the \"inventive, unsparing, irreverent and consistently entertaining\" (NYTBR) memoir Eat the Apple — examining the last phase of war for US veterans: returning home. What was it like? It's the only thing anyone wants to know about war — and the last thing Corporal Dean Pusey wants to talk about, at least not with one of these fat and happy civilians crowding the bar. Dean is two months free from the Marine Corps, and life back in his Indiana hometown is anything but peaceful. That's when the woman next to him offers to buy him a drink. Max is nice — gorgeous, funny, easy to talk to. Dean doesn't dare tell her about the sheep he took care of on his first deployment, only to watch it get torn to shreds by a pack of wild dogs; or the naked, shivering Iraqi teenager his platoon detained after an IED blast. He needs to leave all that behind and become a new person — the kind who sticks around when Max gets pregnant. He's white-knuckling it, trying to keep calm, and it's not easy. Harder still when his friend and comrade Ruiz starts showing up all over the place like he's been invited — like he didn't die a year ago. He has Max now, he has his baby daughter, River. He doesn't have time for ghosts. With his signature black humor, hard-eyed honesty, and stylistic ingenuity, Young delivers a novel that turns the typical war story on its head — beginning not with enlistment but with retirement, and locating the life-or-death stakes not in battle, but in the domestic theaters of fatherhood, family, forgiveness, and love.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition (Nadelson)\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition (Young)\n\nDaniel J. Levitin\n\nFriday, September 6 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nMusic is one of humanity’s oldest medicines. From the Far East to the Ottoman Empire, Europe to Africa and the pre-colonial Americas, many cultures have developed their own rich traditions for using sound and rhythm to ease suffering, promote healing, and calm the mind. In his latest work, neuroscientist and This Is Your Brain on Music author Daniel J. Levitin explores the curative powers of music, showing us how and why it is one of the most potent therapies today. He brings together, for the first time, the results of numerous studies on music and the brain, demonstrating how music can contribute to the treatment of a host of ailments, from neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s, to cognitive injury, depression, and pain. Levitin is not your typical scientist — he is also an award-winning musician and composer, and through lively interviews with some of today’s most celebrated musicians, from Sting to Kent Nagano and Mari Kodama, he shares their observations as to why music might be an effective therapy, in addition to plumbing scientific case studies, music theory, and music history. The result is a work of dazzling ideas, cutting-edge research, and jubilant celebration. I Heard There Was a Secret Chord (W. W. Norton) highlights the critical role music has played in human biology, illuminating the neuroscience of music and its profound benefits for those both young and old.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nJoyce Maynard in Conversation With Laura Stanfill\n\nSunday, September 8 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nFrom bestselling author Joyce Maynard comes the eagerly anticipated follow-up to her beloved novel Count the Ways — a complex story of three generations of a family and its remarkable, resilient, indomitable matriarch, Eleanor. Following the death of her former husband, Cam, 54-year-old Eleanor has moved back to the New Hampshire farm where they raised three children to care for their brain-injured son, Toby, now an adult. Toby's older brother, Al, is married and living in Seattle with his wife; their sister, Ursula, lives in Vermont with her husband and two children. Although all appears stable, old resentments, anger, and bitterness simmer just beneath the surface. How the Light Gets In (William Morrow) follows Eleanor and her family through fifteen years (2010 to 2024) as their story plays out against a uniquely American backdrop and the events that transform their world (climate change, the January 6th insurrection, school violence) and shape their lives (later-life love, parental alienation, steadfast friendship). With her trademark sensitivity and insight, Maynard paints an indelible portrait of characters both familiar and new making their way over rough, messy, and treacherous terrain to find their way to what is, for each, a place to call \"home.\" Maynard will be joined in conversation by Laura Stanfill, publisher of Forest Avenue Press and author of Singing Lessons for the Stylish Canary.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nChris La Tray in Conversation With Sierra Crane Murdoch\n\nMonday, September 9 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nGrowing up in Montana, Chris La Tray always identified as Indian. While the representation of Indigenous people was mostly limited to racist depictions in toys and television shows, and despite the fact that his father fiercely denied any connection, he found Indians alluring, often recalling his grandmother’s consistent mention of their Chippewa heritage. When La Tray attended his grandfather’s funeral as a young man, he finally found himself surrounded by relatives who obviously were Indigenous. “Who were they?” he wondered, and “Why was I never allowed to know them?” Embarking on a deeply personal and revealing journey into his family’s past, he discovers a larger story of the complicated history of Indigenous communities — and the devastating effects of colonialism that continue to ripple through surviving generations. Combining diligent research and compelling conversations with Indigenous authors, activists, elders, and historians, La Tray follows a trail deep into the heart of his community — and himself. And as he comes to embrace his full identity, he eventually seeks enrollment with the Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians, joining their 158-year-long struggle for federal recognition. Both personal and historical, Becoming Little Shell (Milkweed) is a testament to the power of storytelling, to family and legacy, and to finding home. Infused with candor, heart, wisdom, and an abiding love for a place and a people, La Tray’s remarkable journey — and the journey of his tribe — is both revelatory and redemptive. La Tray will be joined in conversation by Sierra Crane Murdoch, author of Yellow Bird: Oil, Murder, and a Woman's Search for Justice in Indian Country.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nColleen Houck\n\nTuesday, September 10 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s Books at Cedar Hills Crossing\n\nFrom Colleen Houck, Tiger’s Tale (Blackstone) reimagines the epic fantasy that delighted readers with romance, danger, and magic, leaving them breathless and yearning for more. The Tiger’s Curse takes many forms....Anastasia and Verusha Stepanov are the tsar’s only children, heirs to the prosperous and sprawling Kievian Empire. Headstrong and fierce, the twins have long scorned their father’s opulent palace and the diplomatic obligations that come with it, preferring to train with the Royal Guard and dream of a soldier’s life beyond the palace walls. But with their father lost in the recent war and their once indomitable mother succumbing to illness, the young women know that one of them must soon ascend the throne, make a politically advantageous marriage, and begin producing heirs. Yet the succession is far from clear, as both would prefer the path of the second born: head the Royal Guard, travel the far reaches of the empire, and seek out a destiny of her own making. As their beloved mother’s condition worsens, the sisters grow more desperate, seeking any healer who might give her more time. But when a stranger arrives offering another option, the sisters refuse his proposal and banish the strange man. As he departs, the stranger unleashes a devastating curse that sends Veru and Stacia fleeing their home on an adventure beyond anything they ever imagined.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nCharlotte Shane in Conversation With Lydia Kiesling\n\nWednesday, September 11 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nIn her early twenties, Charlotte Shane quit her women's studies graduate program to devote herself to sex work because it was a way to devote herself to men. Her lifelong curiosity about male lust, love, selfishness, and social capital dovetailed with her own insatiable desire for intimacy to sustain a long career in escorting, with unexpectedly poignant results. Shane uses her personal and professional history to examine how men and women struggle in their attempts at romantic and sexual bonding, no matter how true their intentions. As she takes stock of her relationships — with clients, with her father, with friends, with married men, and later, with her own husband — she tells a candid and haunting tale of love, marriage, and (in)fidelity, as seen through the eyes of the perpetual \"other woman.\" Braiding the personal and the universal, Shane's memoir, An Honest Woman (Simon & Schuster), is a merciless and moving love letter to straight men and an indictment of habitual dishonesty, a condemnation of every social constraint acting on heterosexual unions, and a hopeful affirmation of the possibility for true connection between men and women. Shane will be joined in conversation by Lydia Kiesling, author of Mobility and The Golden State.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nPilar Adón\n\nFriday, September 13 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nSummer ends, the season changes, and Coro, an artist frightened off by what her own paintings may represent, gets in her car and drives for hours in the middle of the night until she chances upon Betania, an isolated house existing in a world of its own. It's an unfamiliar place inhabited exclusively by women who, strangely, all seem to know her. Like adherents of an ancient cult, the women of Betania all dress the same, carry out strange rites and celebrations, and live alongside goats and innumerable dogs against a landscape dominated by an immense, imposing mountain that seems to block out the sunlight. Theirs is a hierarchical, closed, and restless universe where — as the other women tell her and despite her attempts to escape the area — Coro may finally discover what it means to be part of something. A \"Hotel California\" of the human heart, Pilar Adón's Of Beasts and Fowls (Open Letter) — winner of the Spanish National Fiction Prize — is a novel about the things that we do without knowing why, but that have an explanation that perhaps we will someday come to understand.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nSasha Abramsky\n\nSunday, September 15 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nDonald Trump’s November 2016 electoral victory was the beginning of four years of demagogy, presidential name-calling, and — ten months into a pandemic — an incitement to violence that led a mob of thousands to descend on the Capitol in Washington, DC. Fueled by suspicion, conspiracy, and bigotry, a faction of Americans had decided to seize control. But the biggest effect of this right-wing wave may not have been on our national politics, but on the local governments of communities around the country. In Chaos Comes Calling (Bold Type Books), Sasha Abramsky investigates the empowerment of the far right over the past few years, stoked by the Trump presidency and the Covid-19 pandemic. He tells the parallel stories of two communities, Shasta County, California and Sequim, Washington, where toxic alliances of QAnoners, anti-vaxxers, Christian nationalists, militia supporters, and other denizens of the far right have worked to take control of the levers of power. The trajectories of both communities expose the stark divisions and extremism that have come to define our political landscape over the past decade, and offer revealing glimpses of what the future may hold. While Sequim ultimately recalibrated in 2021, returning to rationality, Shasta County has descended further into a climate of intolerance and toxic divisiveness. Chaos Comes Calling vividly captures both the regressive forces gaining momentum all over the country and the tireless efforts of citizens determined to organize against them.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nAmie Kaufman in Conversation With Aiden Thomas\n\nWednesday, September 18 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s Books at Cedar Hills Crossing\n\nMagic and sacrifice will collide as lovers and gods, enemies and allies vie for the fate of the world in Amie Kaufman’s The Heart of the World (Alfred A. Knopf Books for Young Readers), the heart-pounding sequel to The Isles of the Gods, which Stephanie Garber called \"deliciously diabolical and full of heart.\" When Selly and Leander began their treacherous voyage to the Isles of the Gods, the captain's daughter and the playboy prince were strangers. But amid talk of war and a deadly attack on their ship, the unthinkable happened. They fell in love. Leander's ritual at the island temple was meant to prevent a war between the gods. Instead, it nearly cost him his life, and drew the goddess Barrica back from exile. Now, as her Messenger, Leander is imbued with her deadly magic, and only Selly's presence can stop it from consuming him. But Barrica wasn't the only immortal roused from sleep. The God of Risk, Macean, was awakened by an enemy all thought dead, and across the sea he's calling for war. The fight to save their world will take Selly and Leander from the gilded ballroom of the royal palace to the hallowed halls of an ancient library. Battle lines will be drawn, and bonds will break. With the wrath of gods and the machinations of power-hungry rulers straining their loyalties, can their love withstand the trials that await them? Kaufman will be joined in conversation by Aiden Thomas, author of Celestial Monsters and The Sunbearer Trials.

Yet mothers made the world… Clove has gone to extremes to keep her past a secret. Thanks to her lies, she’s landed the life of her dreams, complete with a safe husband and two adoring children who will never know the terror that was routine in her own childhood. If her buried anxiety threatens to breach the surface, Clove (if that is really her name) focuses on finding the right supplement, the right gratitude meditation. But when she receives a letter from a women’s prison in California, her past comes screeching into the present, entangling her in a dangerous game with memory and the people she thought she had outrun. As we race between her precarious present-day life in Portland, Oregon and her childhood in a Waikiki high-rise with her mother and father, Clove is forced to finally unravel the defining day of her life. How did she survive that day, and what will it take to end the cycle of violence? Will the truth undo her, or could it ultimately save her? Madwoman (Little, Brown) is the new novel from Chelsea Bieker, author of Heartbroke and Godshot. Bieker will be joined in conversation by Kimberly King Parsons, author of We Were the Universe.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nEdward Burns\n\nTuesday, September 24 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s Books at Cedar Hills Crossing\n\nAn Irish-American family comes to life through the eyes of a 12-year-old boy in the debut novel by actor-filmmaker Edward Burns (The Brothers McMullen). A Kid from Marlboro Road (Seven Stories) opens at a wake where \"Kneeney,\" as his mother calls him, takes in the death of his beloved grandfather, Pop, a larger-than-life figure to him. The overflowing crowd includes sandhogs in their muddy work boots, old Irish biddies in black dresses, and cops in uniform, along with the family in mourning. There’s an open casket, the first time he’s seen a dead person. He watches it all, writing his observations for school projects, not yet realizing how this world defines and explains who he is and will be. His older brother Tommy has no patience for rules and domesticities; his father is emotionally elsewhere. Kneeney knows he’s the best thing his mother's got, though her sadness envelops them both. Stories cascade between the prior generation’s colorful origins in the Bronx and Hell's Kitchen, and the softer world of Gibson, the town on Long Island where the family lives now. There are scenes in the Rockaways, at Belmont Race Track, and in Montauk. Out of individual struggles a collective warmth emerges, a certain kind of American story, raucous and joyous.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nDanielle Walker in Conversation With Michelle Tam\n\nWednesday, September 25 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nIn this practical, time-saving guide to meal prepping and menu planning, Danielle Walker — beloved author of the Against All Grain series — removes all the guess work from your daily effort to get food on the table. Make It Easy (Ten Speed Press) presents fifteen weeks of menus, along with prep-ahead and make-ahead tips, shopping lists organized by grocery store departments, and proven methods for getting it all done quickly and effortlessly. Because we all prep in different ways depending on the size of our families and the busyness of our lives, Danielle has identified six \"prepper personas\" and developed recipes for each type. Recipes such as Greek Lemon Chicken with Artichokes or Teriyaki Meatballs can be made in large quantities and frozen for later, while Fried Pineapple and Pork Rice or Meatballs Marsala with Mashed Roots use store-bought ingredients for no-fuss, quick meals. And Steak and Eggs Breakfast Tacos or Veggie and Shrimp Bowls are designed so components can be made ahead and then repurposed for other meals the same week. Meal plans can be followed in any order and nearly every recipe is photographed. And with additional recipes for breakfasts, snacks, sides, and back-pocket dinners (dishes using pantry ingredients you already have!), this deliciously healthy cookbook provides everything you need to meal plan right. Walker will be joined in conversation by Michelle Tam, author of Nom Nom Paleo.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nCasey Michel in Conversation With Dr. Dawn Nowacki\n\nFriday, September 27 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nFor years, one group of Americans has worked as foot-soldiers for the most authoritarian regimes around the planet. In the process, they’ve not only entrenched dictatorships and spread kleptocratic networks, but the’'ve secretly guided U.S. policy without the rest of America even being aware. And now, some of them have begun turning their sights on American democracy itself. These Americans are known as foreign lobbyists, and many of them spent years ushering dictatorships directly into the halls of Washington, all while laundering the reputations of the most heinous, repressive regimes in the process. These foreign lobbyists include figures like Ivy Lee, the inventor of the public relations industry — a man who whitewashed Mussolini, opened doors to the Soviets, and advised the Nazis on how to sway American audiences. They include people like Paul Manafort, who invented lobbying as we know it — and who then took his talents to autocrats from Ukraine to the Philippines, and then back to the White House. And they now include an increasing number of Americans elsewhere: in law firms and consultancies, among PR specialists and former lawmakers, and even within think tanks and universities. In Foreign Agents (St. Martin’s), Casey Michel shines a light on these foreign lobbyists as some of them — after decades of installing dictators and corrupting American policy — embark on their next mission: to end America's democratic experiment, once and for all. Michel will be joined in conversation by Linfield University professor Dr. Dawn Nowacki.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nWilliam Cope Moyers\n\nFriday, September 27 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s Books at Cedar Hills Crossing\n\nWilliam Cope Moyers was a model of sober success. As his inspiring story of overcoming addiction was on its way to becoming a New York Times bestseller, everyone thought he had finally achieved the redemption promised by recovery — including him. But the perfect story that helped Moyers become a famous face of the recovery movement was already unraveling, revealing a yet-to-be-healed chasm between his public persona and conflicted inner life. A follow-up to his 2006 memoir Broken: My Story of Addiction and Redemption, Broken Open (Hazelden) is Moyers's story of the ups and downs of life beyond the bright moments of early sobriety and what happened when a new addiction invaded what once seemed like a safe and steady recovery. Moyers didn't know something was missing until it happened. He'd been in recovery for alcohol and drugs for years. He was a recovery activist and a spokesperson for the gold standard of treatment and recovery organizations. He was a model leader and follower of Twelve Step programs. But, still, he slipped. And his slip lasted a few years. Privately, he was addicted to painkillers while publicly saying he was in recovery from alcohol and drug use. So, was he still in recovery? How could this happen to someone who did everything \"right\"? How did it go so wrong? With brutal honesty and introspection, Moyers shares what happened after sobriety — after he'd published his candid and shocking memoir, Broken, in 2006. While he no longer frequented or passed out on the floor of crack houses, his life of sobriety wasn't perfect. But his recovery was strong, or so he thought. Unfortunately, the opioid epidemic was stronger. It broke him. Broken Open could be one long story of self-justification. Instead, Moyers takes a courageous look at the years he struggled and suffered to reclaim his recovery. He concludes by sharing the new perspectives these experiences provided. Recovery isn't black and white. Our recovery stories aren't things we have to live up to; they're journeys we get to live into. All-or-nothing approaches don't address the complications that make us human. As we continue our life journeys we learn and change and grow — and the things and people that help us sometimes change too.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nIan Brennan in Conversation With Larry Crane\n\nSunday, September 29 @ 3pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nMissing Music: Voices from Where the Dirt Roads End (PM Press) details Grammy-winning music producer and author Ian Brennan’s ongoing quest to provide musical platforms for underrepresented nations and populations around the world. In a compact and quick-read format, Missing Music collects the latest narratives from Brennan’s field-recording treks. This edition features a greater emphasis on storytelling and an even greater abundance of photos from his wife, Italian-Rwandan photographer/filmmaker Marilena Umuhoza Delli. Together, they meet the elderly shamans of the world’s most musical language, Taa, a tongue that sadly is dying, with fewer than 2,500 speakers left. The duo traveled the most remote roads of Botswana to find the formerly nomadic people now relegated to small desert towns. In Azerbaijan, Brennan and Delli ascended to the mountainous Iranian border to record centenarians in scattered villages of the Talysh minority, where the world’s oldest man reportedly reached the age of 168. The result is the only record ever released to feature the voices of singers over 100 years of age. Among other tales, Brennan also updates the saga of the Sheltered Workshop Singers following COVID, including the tragic deterioration of his sister, Jane. Arising from the more than 40 records that Brennan has produced over the past decade from underrepresented nations such as Comoros, Djibouti, São Tomé, Romania, South Sudan, Suriname, and Cambodia, Missing Music serves as the newest suite in the multiverse symphony of the world’s most ignored corners — the places where countries expire and the “forgotten” live. Brennan will be joined in conversation by Larry Crane, editor and founder of Tape Op Magazine and owner of Portland’s Jackpot! Recording Studio.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nEmily Witt in Conversation With Lydia Kiesling\n\nTuesday, October 1 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nFrom the New Yorker staff writer and author of Future Sex (“introspective and breathtakingly honest” — New York Times Book Review), comes a memoir about drugs, techno, and New York City. In the summer of 2016, a divisive presidential election was underway, and a new breed of right-wing rage was on the rise. Emily Witt, who would soon publish her first book on sex in the digital age, had recently quit antidepressants for a more expansive world of psychedelic experimentation. From her apartment in Brooklyn, she began to catch glimpses of the clandestine nightlife scene thrumming around her. In Health and Safety (Pantheon), Witt charts her immersion into New York City’s dance music underground. Witt would come to lead a double life. By day she worked as a journalist, covering gun violence, climate catastrophes, and the rallies of right-wing militias. And by night she pushed the limits of consciousness in hollowed-out office spaces and warehouses to music that sounded like the future. But no counterculture, no matter how utopian, could stave off the squalor of American politics and the cataclysm of 2020. Affectionate yet never sentimental, Health and Safety is a lament for a broken relationship, for a changed nightlife scene, and for New York City just before the fall. Sparing no one — least of all herself — Witt offers her life as a lens onto an era of American delirium and dissolution. Witt will be joined in conversation by Lydia Kiesling, author of Mobility and The Golden State.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nChuck Palahniuk\n\nTuesday, October 8 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nFrom Chuck Palahniuk, the bestselling author of Fight Club, comes a dark, satirical parable about a string of mysterious high school disappearances, the seedy underbellies of billionaires, and the tough choices we make in the face of an uncertain future. In Shock Induction (Simon & Schuster), the best and brightest students at a seemingly reputable high school are disappearing. Every day it seems another overachiever is lost to an apparent suicide. But something far more sinister is lurking beneath the surface. These kids have been under surveillance since birth, monitored and measured by an online service called “Greener Pastures.” It’s here, in Greener Pastures, that billionaires observe and recruit the next generation of talent. The highest test scores, the best grades, and the most niche extracurriculars just might land these teenagers an enticing offer at auction. A couple billion dollars in exchange for the remainder of your life and intellectual labor sounds like a pretty fair deal — doesn’t it? In a high school only Palahniuk could imagine, students must choose between the risk of following their dreams or the security of money and a lifetime of servitude to the world’s wealthiest and most elite — but how much of a choice do they truly have?\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nThom Hartmann\n\nTuesday, October 15 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nThe widening wealth gap is all too familiar to many Millennials and Gen Zers, especially when home ownership and the lack of debt seem like faraway fantasies. And it’s no surprise when they only hold about 4.6% of the country’s wealth while Boomers held 22% at around the same age. So what happened to the promise of the American Dream? In his new, final entry of his celebrated Hidden History Series, The Hidden History of the American Dream: The Demise of the Middle Class — And How to Rescue Our Future (Berrett-Koehler), Thom Hartmann uncovers the rise of the American middle class through the progressive policies of FDR, through to its downfall with the increasing privatization and economic deregulations of the Reagan era. He also explores potential solutions including wealth and inheritance taxes to lessen economic inequality, supporting unions through increasing labor rights, and renationalizing public spaces and transportation. The American Dream often remains just a dream for many, but Hartmann’s new book highlights what needs to be done to take it back and help make it a reality for us all.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nJohn Larison\n\nThursday, October 17 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nA young boy and his older sisters find themselves suddenly and utterly alone, orphaned in an abandoned fishing village. Their food supplies dwindling, they set out across a breathtaking yet treacherous wilderness in search of the last of their people. Down the coast, raiders deliver the children's mother, along with the rest of their human cargo, to the last port city of a waning empire. Determined to reunite with her family, she plots her escape — while her fellow captives plan open revolt. At the center of power in this crumbling city, a young scholar inherits his father's business and position of privilege, along with the burden of his debts. As the empire's elite prepare to flee to a new utopia across the sea, he must decide where his allegiance lies. With a rapidly changing climate shifting the sands beneath their feet, these three paths converge in a struggle for the future of humanity — who will inherit what remains and who gets to tell its story. At once a sweeping survival story, an epic of the distance future, and a post-apocalyptic vision of hope and optimism, The Ancients (Viking) weaves a multilayered narrative about human resilience, hope, and stewardship of our world for future generations — from John Larison, author of Whiskey When We’re Dry.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nSteve Wasserman in Conversation With Marc Cooper\n\nSunday, October 20 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nBorn on the West Coast, the son of Bronx-born parents, Steve Wasserman is a generalist and public intellectual but is perhaps less well known as a cultural essayist and social critic of the first rank. In thirty splendid essays, originally published in such diverse publications as The New Republic and The Nation, The American Conservative and The Progressive, The Village Voice and The Economist, Wasserman delivers a riveting account of the awakening of an empathetic sensibility and a lively mind. Taken together, they reveal the depth and breadth of his enthusiasms and range over politics, literature, and the tumults of a world in upheaval. Tell Me Something, Tell Me Anything, Even If It's a Lie: A Memoir in Essays (Heyday Books) includes the remarkable tale of a bookstore owner who wouldn't let him buy the books he wanted, his brave against-the-grain take on the Black Panthers, and his shrewd assessment of the fast-changing world of publishing. Here is, as Joyce Carol Oates notes, \"arguably the very best concise history of Cuba and the legendary Fidel Castro; beautifully composed eulogies for two close friends, Susan Sontag and Christopher Hitchens; sharply perceptive commentary on Daniel Ellsberg; a thrillingly candid interview with W. G. Sebald.\" Wasserman will be joined in conversation by journalist Marc Cooper, author of Pinochet and Me: A Chilean Anti-Memoir.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nSally & Brian Dutra\n\nSaturday, October 26 @ 3pm (PT) / Powell’s Books at Cedar Hills Crossing\n\nA new early chapter book series starring a lovable vampire who's just trying to fit in: Frankie D and his family have just moved from Transylvania, looking for a fresh start. Where Frankie is from, the school day began at midnight and ended at dawn. Now in America, Frankie and his family must adjust their sleep schedule, train to be out in the sun, and strictly adhere to a vegan, zero-blood diet. Not only that, Frankie has to navigate school as the \"new kid\" and keep his vampire identity secret from other humans. A tall order for a deathly pale, fanged fourth-grader with a three-legged wolf as a pet! Sally and Brian Dutra's Frankie D, Vegan Vampire (Kids Can Press) offers a whole new take on what it means to be an outsider. With so many playful twists on vampire tropes, a compelling plot (with a cliffhanger ending!), and loads of deadpan humor, their new chapter book is sure to have enormous appeal for early readers.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nMelissa Ludtke in Conversation With Elizabeth Mehren\n\nSunday, October 27 @ 3pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nWhile sportswriters rushed into Major League Baseball locker rooms to talk with players, MLB Commissioner Bowie Kuhn barred the lone woman from entering along with them. That reporter, 26-year-old Sports Illustrated reporter Melissa Ludtke, charged Kuhn with gender discrimination, and after the lawyers argued Ludtke v. Kuhn in federal court, she won. Her 1978 groundbreaking case affirmed her equal rights, and the judge’s order opened the doors for several generations of women to be hired in sports media. Locker Room Talk (Rutgers) is Ludtke’s gripping account of being at the core of this globally covered case that churned up ugly prejudices about the place of women in sports. Kuhn claimed that allowing women into locker rooms would violate his players’ “sexual privacy.” Late-night television comedy sketches mocked her, as newspaper cartoonists portrayed her as a sexy, buxom looker who wanted to ogle the naked athletes’ bodies. She weaves these public perspectives throughout her vivid depiction of the court drama overseen by Judge Constance Baker Motley, the first Black woman to serve on the federal bench. She recounts how her lawyer, F.A.O. “Fritz” Schwarz, employed an ingenious legal strategy that persuaded Judge Motley to invoke the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause in giving Ludtke access identical to that of her male counterparts. Locker Room Talk is both an inspiring story of one woman’s determination to do a job dominated by men and an illuminating portrait of a defining moment for women’s rights. Ludtke will be joined in conversation by Elizabeth Mehren, author of I Lived to Tell the World.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition\n\nNora Lange in Conversation With Kimberly King Parsons\n\nWednesday, October 30 @ 7pm (PT) / Powell’s City of Books\n\nJoanne and Bernadette Fareown are raised on their family farm in rural Illinois, keenly affected by their parents’ volatile relationship and mounting financial debt, haunted by the cursed history of the women in their family. Largely left to their own devices, the sisters educate themselves on Greek mythology, feminism, and Virginia Woolf, realizing they must find unique ways to cope in these antagonistic conditions, questioning the American Dream as the rest of the country abandons their community in crisis. As Jo and Bernie’s imaginative solutions for escape come up short against their parents’ realities, the family leaves their farm for Chicago, where Joanne — free-spirited, reckless, and unable to tame her inner violence — rebels in increasingly desperate ways. After her worst breakdown yet, Jo goes into exile in Deadhorse, Alaska, and it is up to Bernadette to use all she’s learned from her sister to revive a sense of hope against the backdrop of a failing world. With her debut novel, Us Fools (Two Dollar Radio), Nora Lange has crafted a rambunctious, ambitious, and heart-rending portrait of two idiosyncratic sisters, determined to persevere despite the worst that capitalism and their circumstances have to throw at them. Lange will be joined in conversation by Kimberly King Parsons, author of We Were the Universe.\n\nPreorder a Signed Edition"
