        "text": "Racial and Ethnic Differences in the Association Between Mean Glucose and Hemoglobin A1c\n\nBackground: Studies have reported significantly higher hemoglobin A1c (A1C) in African American patients than in White patients with the same mean glucose, but less is known about other racial/ethnic groups. We evaluated racial/ethnic differences in the association between mean glucose, based on continuous glucose monitor (CGM) data, and A1C. Methods: Retrospective study among 1788 patients with diabetes from Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) who used CGM devices during 2016 to 2021. In this study population, there were 5264 A1C results; mean glucose was calculated from 124,388,901 CGM readings captured during the 90 days before each A1C result. Hierarchical mixed models were specified to estimate racial/ethnic differences in the association between mean glucose and A1C. Results: Mean A1C was 0.33 (95% confidence interval: 0.23-0.44; P < 0.0001) percentage points higher among African American patients relative to White patients for a given mean glucose. A1C results for Asians, Latinos, and multiethnic patients were not significantly different from those of White patients. The slope of the association between mean glucose and A1C did not differ significantly across racial/ethnic groups. Variance for the association between mean glucose and A1C was substantially greater within groups than between racial/ethnic groups (65% vs. 9%, respectively). Conclusions: For African American patients, A1C results may overestimate glycemia and could lead to premature diabetes diagnoses, overtreatment, or invalid assessments of health disparities. However, most of the variability in the mean glucose-A1C association was within racial/ethnic groups. Treatment decisions driven by guideline-based A1C targets should be individualized and supported by direct measurement of glycemia.\n\nAuthors: Karter, Andrew J;Parker, Melissa M;Moffet, Howard H;Gilliam, Lisa K\n\nDiabetes Technol Ther. 2023 Aug 02.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nStructural Racism and Adolescent Mental Health Disparities in Northern California\n\nUnderstanding how structural racism is associated with adolescent mental health is critical to advance health equity. To assess associations between neighborhood privilege, measured by the Index of Concentration at the Extremes (ICE) and adolescent depressive symptoms, suicidality, and related racial and ethnic disparities. This was a retrospective cohort study using electronic health records of adolescents aged 12 to 16 years who attended well-teen visits between 2017 and 2021. Kaiser Permanente Northern California is an integrated health care delivery system serving 4.6 million members. The cohort included 34 252 individuals born singleton at an affiliated facility from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2009, and who had completed at least 1 mental health screener during a well-teen visit by November 23, 2021. American Community Survey 2016 to 2021 5-year estimates were used to calculate ICE scores for adolescents’ residential census tract at ages 10 to 11. Three ICE measures were used as proxies of structural racism: racial privilege (ICE-race and ethnicity; hereinafter ICE-race), economic privilege (ICE-income), and combined economic and racial privilege (ICE-income plus race and ethnicity; herinafter ICE-income plus race). ICE scores were categorized into quintiles based on California statewide distributions. Depressive symptoms and suicidality were assessed through self-report screeners during well-teen visits. Depressive symptoms were considered to be present if patients had a score on the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 of 3 or higher (the tool uses a Likert scale to determine the frequency [0 = not at all; 3 = nearly every day] that they had depressed mood and lack of pleasure in usual activities in the past 2 weeks; responses were summed and dichotomized). Analyses included 34 252 adolescents (12-16 years of age; mean [SD] age, 13.7 [0.8] years; 17 557 [51.3%] male, 7284 [21.3%] Asian or Pacific Islander, 2587 [7.6%] Black], 9061 [26.5%] Hispanic, 75 [0.2%] American Indian or Indigenous, 12 176 [35.5%] White, and 3069 [9%] other or unknown). Risks of depressive symptoms and suicidality generally increased with each level of declining neighborhood privilege. Adjusted risk ratios comparing adolescents from neighborhoods with the least to most racial and economic privilege were 1.37 (95% CI, 1.20-1.55) for depressive symptoms and 1.59 (95% CI, 1.23-2.05) for suicidality. Racial disparities between Black and White youth and Hispanic and White youth decreased after adjusting for each ICE measure, and became nonsignificant in models adjusting for ICE-race and ICE-income plus race. In this cohort study, lower neighborhood privilege was associated with greater risks of adolescent depressive symptoms and suicidality. Furthermore, adjusting for neighborhood privilege reduced mental health disparities affecting Black and Hispanic adolescents. These findings suggest that efforts to promote equity in adolescent mental health should extend beyond the clinical setting and consider the inequitable neighborhood contexts that are shaped by structural racism.\n\nAuthors: Acker, Julia;Aghaee, Sara;Mujahid, Mahasin;Deardorff, Julianna;Kubo, Ai\n\nJAMA Netw Open. 2023 Aug 01;6(8):e2329825.

To examine whether there were differences in overall and telehealth addiction treatment utilization after telehealth policy changes during the COVID-19 pandemic by age, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. This cohort study examined electronic health record and claims data from Kaiser Permanente Northern California for adults (age ≥18 years) with drug use problems before the COVID-19 pandemic (from March 1, 2019, to December 31, 2019) and during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 1, 2020, to December 31, 2020; hereafter referred to as COVID-19 onset). Analyses were conducted between March 2021 and March 2023. The expansion of telehealth services during COVID-19 onset. Generalized estimating equation models were fit to compare addiction treatment utilization during COVID-19 onset with that before the COVID-19 pandemic. Utilization measures included the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set of treatment initiation and engagement (including inpatient, outpatient, and telehealth encounters or receipt of medication for opioid use disorder [OUD]), 12-week retention (days in treatment), and OUD pharmacotherapy retention. Telehealth treatment initiation and engagement were also examined. Differences in changes in utilization by age group, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES) were examined. Among the 19 648 participants in the pre-COVID-19 cohort (58.5% male; mean [SD] age, 41.0 [17.5] years), 1.6% were American Indian or Alaska Native; 7.5%, Asian or Pacific Islander; 14.3%, Black; 20.8%, Latino or Hispanic; 53.4%, White; and 2.5%, unknown race. Among the 16 959 participants in the COVID-19 onset cohort (56.5% male; mean [SD] age, 38.9 [16.3] years), 1.6% were American Indian or Alaska Native; 7.4%, Asian or Pacific Islander; 14.6%, Black; 22.2%, Latino or Hispanic; 51.0%, White; and 3.2%, unknown race. Odds of overall treatment initiation increased from before the COVID-19 pandemic to COVID-19 onset for all age, race, ethnicity, and SES subgroups except for patients aged 50 years or older; patients aged 18 to 34 years had the greatest increases (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.31; 95% CI, 1.22-1.40). Odds of telehealth treatment initiation increased for all patient subgroups without variation by race, ethnicity, or SES, although increases were greater for patients aged 18 to 34 years (aOR, 7.17; 95% CI, 6.24-8.24). Odds of overall treatment engagement increased (aOR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.03-1.24) without variation by patient subgroups. Retention increased by 1.4 days (95% CI, 0.6-2.2 days), and OUD pharmacotherapy retention did not change (adjusted mean difference, -5.2 days; 95% CI, -12.7 to 2.4 days). In this cohort study of insured adults with drug use problems, there were increases in overall and telehealth addiction treatment utilization after telehealth policies changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. There was no evidence that disparities were exacerbated, and younger adults may have particularly benefited from the transition to telehealth.\n\nAuthors: Palzes, Vanessa A;Chi, Felicia W;Metz, Verena E;Sterling, Stacy;Asyyed, Asma;Ridout, Kathryn K;Campbell, Cynthia I\n\nJAMA Health Forum. 2023 May 05;4(5):e231018.

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI), National Institutes of Health, and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health (OASH), Department of Health and Human Services held a virtual SoS in transfusion medicine (TM) symposium. In advance of the symposium, six multidisciplinary working groups (WG) convened to define research priorities in the areas of: blood donors and the supply, optimizing transfusion outcomes for recipients, emerging infections, mechanistic aspects of components and transfusion, new computational methods in transfusion science, and impact of health disparities on donors and recipients. The overall objective was to identify key basic, translational, and clinical research questions that will help to increase and diversify the volunteer donor pool, ensure safe and effective transfusion strategies for recipients, and identify which blood products from which donors best meet the clinical needs of specific recipient populations. On August 29-30, 2022, over 400 researchers, clinicians, industry experts, government officials, community members, and patient advocates discussed the research priorities presented by each WG. Dialogue focused on the five highest priority research areas identified by each WG and included the rationale, proposed methodological approaches, feasibility, and barriers for success. This report summarizes the key ideas and research priorities identified during the NHLBI/OASH SoS in TM symposium. The report highlights major gaps in our current knowledge and provides a road map for TM research.\n\nAuthors: Custer, Brian;Glynn, Simone A;Roubinian, Nareg H;et al.\n\nTransfusion. 2023 May;63(5):1074-1091.

In the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, 4488 Black or White adults aged 18 to 30 years without obesity at baseline (1985-1986) were followed over 30 years. Sex-specific Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate Black-White differences in incident obesity. Models were adjusted for baseline and time-updated indicators. During follow-up, 1777 participants developed obesity. Black women were 1.87 (95% CI: 1.63-2.13) times more likely and Black men were 1.53 (95% CI: 1.32-1.77) times more likely to develop obesity than their White counterparts after adjusting for age, field center, and baseline BMI. Baseline exposures explained 43% of this difference in women and 52% in men. Time-updated exposures explained more of the racial difference in women but less for men, compared with baseline exposures. Adjusting for these exposures accounted for a substantial but incomplete proportion of racial disparities in incident obesity. Remaining differences may be explained by incomplete capture of the most salient aspects of these exposures or potential variation in the impact of these exposures on obesity by race.\n\nAuthors: Song, Christopher;Gordon-Larsen, Penny;Kershaw, Kiarri N;et al.\n\nObesity (Silver Spring). 2023 May;31(5):1402-1414.

To measure disparities in hospital length of stay (LOS) among patients at high risk of adverse outcomes who present with sepsis and/or ARF and do not immediately require life support and to quantify associations with patient- and hospital-level factors. This matched retrospective cohort study used electronic health record data from 27 acute care teaching and community hospitals across the Philadelphia metropolitan and northern California areas between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2018. Matching analyses were performed between June 1 and July 31, 2022. The study included 102 362 adult patients who met clinical criteria for sepsis (n = 84 685) or ARF (n = 42 008) with a high risk of death at the time of presentation to the emergency department but without an immediate requirement for invasive life support. Racial or ethnic minority self-identification. Hospital LOS, defined as the time from hospital admission to the time of discharge or inpatient death. Matches were stratified by racial and ethnic minority patient identity, comparing Asian and Pacific Islander patients, Black patients, Hispanic patients, and multiracial patients with White patients in stratified analyses. Among 102 362 patients, the median (IQR) age was 76 (65-85) years; 51.5% were male. A total of 10.2% of patients self-identified as Asian American or Pacific Islander, 13.7% as Black, 9.7% as Hispanic, 60.7% as White, and 5.7% as multiracial. After matching racial and ethnic minority patients to White patients on clinical presentation characteristics, hospital capacity strain, initial intensive care unit admission, and the occurrence of inpatient death, Black patients experienced longer LOS relative to White patients in fully adjusted matches (sepsis: 1.26 [95% CI, 0.68-1.84] days; ARF: 0.97 [95% CI, 0.05-1.89] days). Length of stay was shorter among Asian American and Pacific Islander patients with ARF (-0.61 [95% CI, -0.88 to -0.34] days) and Hispanic patients with sepsis (-0.22 [95% CI, -0.39 to -0.05] days) or ARF (-0.47 [-0.73 to -0.20] days). In this cohort study, Black patients with severe illness who presented with sepsis and/or ARF experienced longer LOS than White patients. Hispanic patients with sepsis and Asian American and Pacific Islander and Hispanic patients with ARF both experienced shorter LOS. Because matched differences were independent of commonly implicated clinical presentation-related factors associated with disparities, identification of additional mechanisms that underlie these disparities is warranted.\n\nAuthors: Chesley, Christopher F;Chowdhury, Marzana;Small, Dylan S;Schaubel, Douglas;Liu, Vincent X;Lane-Fall, Meghan B;Halpern, Scott D;Anesi, George L\n\nJAMA Netw Open. 2023 May 01;6(5):e239739.

Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-associated mortality among women, with persistent survival disparities seen across race and ethnicity, and by socioeconomic status, even after accounting for histology, stage, treatment differences, and other clinical factors. Neighborhood and environmental context can play an important role in ovarian cancer survival, and, to the extent that minority racial and ethnic groups, and populations of lower socioeconomic status are more likely to be segregated into neighborhoods with lower quality social, built, and physical environment neighborhoods, contextual factors may be a critical component to ovarian cancer survival disparities. However, research on the impact of different domains of structural, environmental, and neighborhood context in ovarian cancer survival, and in disparities in ovarian cancer survival is limited. This review focuses on the following contextual domains: structural and institutional factors, healthcare access and geographic medical accessibility, environmental exposures within the physical environment, social environment, built environment, and rurality and the research to date and offers recommendations for future research studies in disparities in ovarian cancer survival. Recommendations for future research studies to address disparities in ovarian cancer survival are proposed.\n\nAuthors: Gomez, Scarlett L;Peters, Edward S;Lawson, Andrew;et al.\n\nAm J Obstet Gynecol. 2023 Apr 26.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nPerceived Discrimination, Nativity, and Cognitive Performance in a Multi-ethnic Study of Older Adults: Findings from the Kaiser Healthy Aging and Diverse Life Experiences (KHANDLE) Study\n\nDespite growing research on the association between discrimination and disparities in cognitive aging, an evidence gap remains on how the association varies by racial/ethnic group. This study evaluates the associations of experiences of discrimination with cognitive function and whether these associations varied by race/ethnicity and nativity. Using the Kaiser Healthy Aging and Diverse Life Experiences (KHANDLE) cohort (N = 1 712) with approximately equal groups of Black, White, Latino, and Asian community-dwelling older adults aged 65 years and older, we evaluated the associations between self-reported experiences of everyday and major lifetime discrimination with overall cognitive performance and domain-specific cognition (verbal episodic memory, semantic memory, and executive functioning) across race/ethnicity and nativity. Linear regression models examined the cross-sectional association between self-reported experiences of everyday and major lifetime discrimination with z-standardized coefficients for cognition. We tested for effect modification by race and nativity. All models controlled for age, sex, and education. Among KHANDLE participants (mean age: 76 years; SD: 6.8), everyday discrimination was not associated with cognitive scores. Major lifetime discrimination was associated with better average cognitive scores among Black participants but not among other racial/ethnic groups. Major lifetime discrimination was associated with better average cognitive scores among U.S.-born but not among non-U.S.-born individuals. Our findings do not imply that discrimination improves cognition, but rather suggest that future research should include more detailed measures on discrimination and unfair treatment that could help disentangle the extent to which relationships are causal or reflect some other underlying factor.\n\nAuthors: Meza, Erika; Peterson, Rachel; Gilsanz, Paola; George, Kristen M; Miles, Sunita J; Eng, Chloe W; Mungas, Dan M; Mayeda, Elizabeth Rose; Glymour, M Maria; Whitmer, Rachel A\n\nJ Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci. 2022 02 03;77(2):e65-e73.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nMeasuring cognitive health in ethnically diverse older adults\n\nUnderstanding racial/ethnic disparities in late-life cognitive health is a public health imperative. We used baseline data from the Kaiser Healthy Aging and Diverse Life Experiences (KHANDLE) study to examine how age, education, gender, and clinical diagnosis, a proxy for brain health, are associated with cross-sectional measures of cognition in diverse racial/ethnic groups. Comprehensive measures of cognition were obtained using the Spanish and English Neuropsychological Assessment Scales and the National Institutes of Health Toolbox Cognitive Health Battery in a sample of 1,695 KHANDLE participants (Asians 24%, Blacks 26%, Latinos 20%, Whites 29%). A 25% random subsample was clinically evaluated and diagnosed with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or dementia. Cognitive test scores were regressed on core demographic variables and diagnosis in the combined sample and in multiple group analyses stratified by racial/ethnic group. Race/ethnicity and education were variably associated with test scores with strongest associations with tests of vocabulary and semantic memory. Older age was associated with poorer performance on all measures, and gender differences varied across cognitive tests. Clinical diagnosis of MCI or dementia was associated with average decrements in test scores that ranged from -0.41 to -0.84 SD, with largest differences on tests of executive function and episodic memory. With few exceptions, associations of demographic variables and clinical diagnosis did not differ across racial/ethnic groups. The robust associations of cognitive test results with clinical diagnosis independent of core demographic variables and race/ethnicity support the validity of cognitive tests as indicators for brain health in diverse older adults.\n\nAuthors: Hernandez Saucedo, Hector; Whitmer, Rachel A; Glymour, Maria; DeCarli, Charles; Mayeda, Elizabeth-Rose; Gilsanz, Paola; Miles, Sunita Q; Bhulani, Nihal; Farias, Sarah Tomaszewski; Olichney, John; Mungas, Dan\n\nJ Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci. 2022 02 03;77(2):261-271.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nContributions of COVID-19 Pandemic-Related Stressors to Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Mental Health During Pregnancy\n\nThis study aimed to identify racial and ethnic disparities in prenatal mental health and identify COVID-19 pandemic-related health/healthcare and economic contributors to these disparities, using an established framework for disparity investigation. This cross-sectional study includes 10,930 pregnant people at Kaiser Permanente Northern California who completed an online survey between June 22, 2020 and April 28, 2021 on COVID-19 pandemic-related health/healthcare and economic stressors, depression, and anxiety. Self-reported race and ethnicity were extracted from electronic health records. Weighted analyses were used to evaluate the association between racial and ethnic category and prenatal depression and anxiety; the prevalence of each stressor by race and ethnicity; and the relationship between each stressor and prenatal depression and anxiety in each racial and ethnic category. The sample was 22% Asian, 3% Black, 20% Hispanic, 5% Other/Multiracial/Unknown, and 49% White. Compared to White people, Black and Hispanic people had a higher prevalence of prenatal depression (aPR: 1.85, 95% CI: 1.45, 2.35 and aPR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.37, respectively) and anxiety (aPR: 1.71, 95% CI: 1.34, 2.18 and aPR: 1.10, 95% CI: 0.94, 1.29, respectively). Compared to White people, Black and Hispanic people had a higher prevalence of moderate/severe distress due to changes in prenatal care (24 vs. 34 and 31%), and food insecurity (9 vs. 31 and 24%). Among Black and Hispanic people, distress due to changes in prenatal care was associated with a greater prevalence of prenatal depression (aPR: 2.27, 95% CI: 1.41, 3.64 and aPR: 2.76, 95% CI: 2.12, 3.58, respectively) and prenatal anxiety (aPR: 3.00, 95% CI: 1.85, 4.84 and aPR: 2.82, 95% CI: 2.15, 3.71, respectively). Additionally, among Hispanic people, high-risk employment and food insecurity were associated with a greater prevalence of prenatal depression and anxiety. This study identified racial and ethnic disparities in mental health for pregnant Black and Hispanic people. Distress due to prenatal care changes contributed to the observed disparities in prenatal depression and anxiety for Black and Hispanic people and food insecurity additionally contributed to the observed disparities for Hispanic people. Addressing distress due to changes to prenatal care and food insecurity specifically in Black and Hispanic people may help reduce the high burden of poor mental health and reduce observed disparities in these communities.\n\nAuthors: Avalos, Lyndsay A; Nance, Nerissa; Zhu, Yeyi; Croen, Lisa A; Young-Wolff, Kelly C; Zerbo, Ousseny; Hedderson, Monique M; Ferrara, Assiamira; Ames, Jennifer L; Badon, Sylvia E\n\nFront Psychiatry. 2022;13:837659.

This study used pooled data from 25 prospective cohort studies. Region of residence (Northeast, Midwest, South, West) was based on residential zip codes. Age- and sex-specific BMI z scores were the outcome. The final sample included 14,313 children with 85,428 BMI measurements, 49% female and 51% non-Hispanic White. Males had a lower average BMI z score compared with females in the Midwest (β = -0.12, 95% CI: -0.19 to -0.05) and West (β = -0.12, 95% CI: -0.20 to -0.04). Compared with non-Hispanic White children, BMI z score was generally higher among children who were Hispanic and Black but not across all regions. Compared with the Northeast, average BMI z score was significantly higher in the Midwest (β = 0.09, 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.14) and lower in the South (β = -0.12, 95% CI: -0.16 to -0.08) and West (β = -0.14, 95% CI: -0.19 to -0.09) after adjustment for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and birth weight.

The aim was to compare risks of inadequate or excessive micronutrient intake in diverse females with singleton pregnancies by strata of maternal age, race/ethnicity, education, and prepregnancy BMI. Fifteen observational cohorts in the US Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) Consortium assessed participant dietary intake with 24-h dietary recalls (n = 1910) or food-frequency questionnaires (n = 7891) from 1999-2019. We compared the distributions of usual intake of 19 micronutrients from food alone (15 cohorts; n = 9801) and food plus dietary supplements (10 cohorts with supplement data; n = 7082) to estimate the proportion with usual daily intakes below their age-specific daily Estimated Average Requirement (EAR), above their Adequate Intake (AI), and above their Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL), overall and within sociodemographic and anthropometric subgroups. Risk of inadequate intake from food alone ranged from 0% to 87%, depending on the micronutrient and assessment methodology. When dietary supplements were included, some women were below the EAR for vitamin D (20-38%), vitamin E (17-22%), and magnesium (39-41%); some women were above the AI for vitamin K (63-75%), choline (7%), and potassium (37-53%); and some were above the UL for folic acid (32-51%), iron (39-40%), and zinc (19-20%). Highest risks for inadequate intakes were observed among participants with age 14-18 y (6 nutrients), non-White race or Hispanic ethnicity (10 nutrients), less than a high school education (9 nutrients), or obesity (9 nutrients). Improved diet quality is needed for most pregnant females. Even with dietary supplement use, >20% of participants were at risk of inadequate intake of ≥1 micronutrients, especially in some population subgroups. Pregnancy may be a window of opportunity to address disparities in micronutrient intake that could contribute to intergenerational health inequalities.\n\nAuthors: Sauder, Katherine A; Avalos, Lyndsay A; Zhu, Yeyi; Breton, Carrie V; Program Collaborators for Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO),; et al.\n\nJ Nutr. 2021 11 02;151(11):3555-3569.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nDisparities in Use of Video Telemedicine Among Patients With Limited English Proficiency During the COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nAuthors: Hsueh, Loretta; Huang, Jie; Millman, Andrea K; Gopalan, Anjali; Parikh, Rahul K; Teran, Silvia; Reed, Mary E\n\nJAMA Netw Open. 2021 11 01;4(11):e2133129.

Mobile apps to address these problems were increasingly popular even before the pandemic, and may help reach people who otherwise have limited treatment access. In this review, we describe pandemic-related substance use and mental health problems, the growing evidence for mobile app efficacy, how health systems can integrate apps into patient care, and future research directions. If equity in access and effective implementation can be addressed, mobile apps are likely to play an important role in mental health and substance use disorder treatment.\n\nAuthors: Satre, Derek D; Meacham, Meredith C; Asarnow, Lauren D; Fisher, Weston S; Fortuna, Lisa R; Iturralde, Esti\n\nAm J Health Promot. 2021 11;35(8):1178-1183.

In a cohort of 17-year-old adolescents with ADHD at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, we assessed medication adherence (medication possession ratio ≥70%) and any medication use and associations with adverse outcomes at 18 and 19 years of age. We conducted bivariate tests of association and multivariable logistic regression models. Adherence declined from 17 to 19 years of age (36.7%-19.1%, p < .001). Non-white race/ethnicity, lower estimated income, and male sex were associated with nonadherence. Model results show nonadherent females experienced several adverse outcomes: Adherence at 18 years of age (referent: nonadherence) was associated with lower odds of pregnancy (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: .13, 95% confidence interval [CI]: .03-.54). Any use (referent: nonuse) at 18 years of age was associated with lower odds of sexually transmitted infections among females (AOR: .39, 95% CI: .19-.83), pregnancies (AOR: .26, 95% CI: .13-.50), emergency department visits (AOR: .69, 95% CI: .55-.85), and greater odds of injuries (AOR: 1.16, 95% CI: 1.02-1.32). Adherence at 19 years of age was associated with lower odds of pregnancy (AOR: .13, 95% CI: .02-.95). Any use at 19 years of age was associated with lower odds of injury in females (AOR: .77, 95% CI: .60-.99) pregnancy (AOR: .35, 95% CI: .16-.78), and, in both sexes, substance use (AOR: .71, 95% CI: .55-.92). Late adolescence is associated with decline in ADHD medication use and adherence. ADHD medication adherence and any ADHD medication use is associated with fewer adverse health outcomes, particularly in females.\n\nAuthors: Rao, Kavitha; Carpenter, Diane M; Campbell, Cynthia I\n\nJ Adolesc Health. 2021 11;69(5):806-814.

Successful delivery of services at all points in the process has been negatively affected by the pandemic. There is a void in empirical high-quality evidence to support a specific strategy for administering cancer screening during a pandemic and its resolution phase, but several pragmatic considerations can help guide prioritization efforts. Targeting guideline-eligible people who have never been screened, or those who are significantly out of date with screening, has the potential to maximize benefits now and into the future. Disruptions to care due to the pandemic could represent an unparalleled opportunity to reassess early detection programs towards an explicit, thoughtful, and just prioritization of populations historically experiencing cancer disparities. By focusing screening services on populations that have the most to gain, and by careful and deliberate planning for the period following the pandemic, we can positively affect cancer outcomes for all.\n\nAuthors: Croswell, Jennifer M; Corley, Douglas A; Lafata, Jennifer Elston; Haas, Jennifer S; Inadomi, John M; Kamineni, Aruna; Ritzwoller, Debra P; Vachani, Anil; Zheng, Yingye; National Cancer Institute Population-based Research to Optimize the Screening Process (PROSPR) II Consortium,\n\nPrev Med. 2021 10;151:106595.

Although emerging artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) algorithms could reduce uncertainty surrounding these life and death decisions, certain criteria must be met to ensure their bedside value. Although ICU severity of illness scores have existed for decades, these tools have not been shown to predict well or to improve outcomes for individual patients. Novel AI/ML tools offer the promise of personalized ICU care but remain untested in clinical trials. Ensuring that these predictive models account for heterogeneity in patient characteristics and treatments, are not only specific to a clinical action but also consider the longitudinal course of critical illness, and address patient-centered outcomes related to equity, transparency, and shared decision-making will increase the likelihood that these tools improve outcomes. Improved clarity around standards and contributions from institutions and critical care departments will be essential. Improved ICU prognostication, enabled by advanced ML/AI methods, offer a promising approach to inform difficult and urgent decisions under uncertainty. However, critical knowledge gaps around performance, equity, safety, and effectiveness must be filled and prospective, randomized testing of predictive interventions are still needed.\n\nAuthors: Weissman, Gary E; Liu, Vincent X\n\nCurr Opin Crit Care. 2021 10 01;27(5):500-505.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nCharacterization of HIV Preexposure Prophylaxis Use Behaviors and HIV Incidence Among US Adults in an Integrated Health Care System\n\nLong-term follow-up is needed to evaluate gaps in HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) care delivery and to identify individuals at risk for falling out of care. To characterize the PrEP continuum of care, including prescription, initiation, discontinuation, and reinitiation, and evaluate incident HIV infections. This retrospective cohort study used data from the electronic health records (EHR) at Kaiser Permanente Northern California to identify individuals aged 18 years and older who received PrEP care between July 2012 and March 2019. Individuals were followed up from date of linkage (defined as a PrEP referral or PrEP-coded encounter) until March 2019, HIV diagnosis, discontinuation of health plan membership, or death. Data were analyzed from December 2019 to January 2021. Sociodemographic factors included age, sex, race and ethnicity, and neighborhood deprivation index, and clinical characteristics were extracted from the EHR. The primary outcomes were attrition at each step of the PrEP continuum of care and incident HIV infections. Among 13 906 individuals linked to PrEP care, the median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 33 (27-43) years, 6771 individuals (48.7%) were White, and 13 227 (95.1%) were men. Total follow-up was 26 210 person-years (median [IQR], 1.6 [0.7-2.8] years). Of individuals linked to PrEP care, 88.1% (95% CI, 86.1%-89.9%) were prescribed PrEP and of these, 98.2% (95% CI, 97.2%-98.8%) initiated PrEP. After PrEP initiation, 52.2% (95% CI, 48.9%-55.7%) discontinued PrEP at least once during the study period, and 60.2% (95% CI, 52.2%-68.3%) of these individuals subsequently reinitiated. Compared with individuals aged 18 to 25 years, older individuals were more likely to receive a PrEP prescription (eg, age >45 years: hazard ratio [HR], 1.21 [95% CI, 1.14-1.29]) and initiate PrEP (eg, age >45 years: HR, 1.09 [95% CI, 1.02-1.16]) and less likely to discontinue (eg, age >45 years: HR, 0.46 [95% CI, 0.42-0.52]). Compared with White patients, African American and Latinx individuals were less likely to receive a PrEP prescription (African American: HR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.69-0.81]; Latinx: HR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.84-0.93]) and initiate PrEP (African American: HR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.80-0.95]; Latinx: HR, 0.90 [95% CI, 0.86-0.95]) and more likely to discontinue (African American: HR, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.17-1.57]; Latinx: 1.33 [95% CI, 1.22-1.46]). Similarly, women, individuals with lower neighborhood-level socioeconomic status (SES), and persons with a substance use disorder (SUD) were less likely to be prescribed (women: HR, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.50-0.62]; lowest SES: HR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.68-0.76]; SUD: HR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.82-0.94]) and initiate PrEP (women: HR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.64-0.80]; lower SES: HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.87-.0.99]; SUD: HR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.81-0.95]) and more likely to discontinue (women: HR, 1.99 [95% CI, 1.67-2.38]); lower SES: HR, 1.40 [95% CI, 1.26-1.57]; SUD: HR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.09-1.39]). HIV incidence was highest among individuals who discontinued PrEP and did not reinitiate PrEP (1.28 [95% CI, 0.93-1.76] infections per 100 person-years). These findings suggest that gaps in the PrEP care continuum were concentrated in populations disproportionately impacted by HIV, including African American individuals, Latinx individuals, young adults (aged 18-25 years), and individuals with SUD. Comprehensive strategies to improve PrEP continuum outcomes are needed to maximize PrEP impact and equity.\n\nAuthors: Hojilla, J Carlo; Hurley, Leo B; Marcus, Julia L; Silverberg, Michael J; Skarbinski, Jacek; Satre, Derek D; Volk, Jonathan E\n\nJAMA Netw Open. 2021 08 02;4(8):e2122692.

We evaluated sex-related differences in cardiovascular events and death in adults with CKD. Prospective cohort study. 1,778 women and 2,161 men enrolled in the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC). Sex (women vs men). Atherosclerotic composite outcome (myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral artery disease), incident heart failure, cardiovascular death, and all-cause death. Cox proportional hazards regression. During a median follow-up period of 9.6 years, we observed 698 atherosclerotic events (women, 264; men, 434), 762 heart failure events (women, 331; men, 431), 435 cardiovascular deaths (women, 163; men, 274), and 1,158 deaths from any cause (women, 449; men, 709). In analyses adjusted for sociodemographic, clinical, and metabolic parameters, women had a lower risk of atherosclerotic events (HR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.57-0.88]), heart failure (HR, 0.76 [95% CI, 0.62-0.93]), cardiovascular death (HR, 0.55 [95% CI, 0.42-0.72]), and death from any cause (HR, 0.58 [95% CI, 0.49-0.69]) compared with men. These associations remained statistically significant after adjusting for cardiac and inflammation biomarkers. Assessment of sex hormones, which may play a role in cardiovascular risk, was not included. In a large, diverse cohort of adults with CKD, compared with men, women had lower risks of cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and mortality from any cause. These differences were not explained by measured cardiovascular risk factors.\n\nAuthors: Toth-Manikowski, Stephanie M; Go, Alan S; Chronic Renal Insufficiency Cohort (CRIC) Study Investigators,; et al.\n\nAm J Kidney Dis. 2021 08;78(2):200-209.e1.

Members of minority racial and ethnic groups have experienced disproportionate COVID-19-associated morbidity and mortality (1); however, COVID-19 vaccination coverage is lower in these groups (2). CDC used data from CDC’s Vaccine Safety Datalink (VSD)* to assess disparities in vaccination coverage among persons aged ≥16 years by race and ethnicity during December 14, 2020-May 15, 2021. Measures of coverage included receipt of ≥1 COVID-19 vaccine dose (i.e., receipt of the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines or 1 dose of the Janssen COVID-19 vaccine [Johnson & Johnson]) and full vaccination (receipt of 2 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines or 1 dose of Janssen COVID-19 vaccine). Among 9.6 million persons aged ≥16 years enrolled in VSD during December 14, 2020-May 15, 2021, ≥1-dose coverage was 48.3%, and 38.3% were fully vaccinated. As of May 15, 2021, coverage with ≥1 dose was lower among non-Hispanic Black (Black) and Hispanic persons (40.7% and 41.1%, respectively) than it was among non-Hispanic White (White) persons (54.6%). Coverage was highest among non-Hispanic Asian (Asian) persons (57.4%). Coverage with ≥1 dose was higher among persons with certain medical conditions that place them at higher risk for severe COVID-19 (high-risk conditions) (63.8%) than it was among persons without such conditions (41.5%) and was higher among persons who had not had COVID-19 (48.8%) than it was among those who had (42.4%). Persons aged 18-24 years had the lowest ≥1-dose coverage (28.7%) among all age groups. Continued monitoring of vaccination coverage and efforts to improve equity in coverage are critical, especially among populations disproportionately affected by COVID-19.\n\nAuthors: Pingali, Cassandra; Klein, Nicola P; Fireman, Bruce; Zerbo, Ousseny; Patel, Suchita A; et al.\n\nMMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2021 Jul 16;70(28):985-990.

Obstetric patients and women’s health clinician experts from a large healthcare system participated in this qualitative study. We conducted focus groups with 30 pregnant or postpartum women of Asian, Black, Latina, and White race/ethnicity with positive depression screens. Nine clinician experts in perinatal depression (obstetric, mental health, and primary care providers) were interviewed. A semi-structured format elicited treatment barriers, cultural factors, and helpful strategies. Discussion transcripts were coded using a general inductive approach with themes mapped to the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behavior (COM-B) theoretical framework. Treatment barriers included social stigma, difficulties recognizing one’s own depression, low understanding of treatment options, and lack of time for treatment. Distinct factors emerged for non-White women including culturally specific messages discouraging treatment, low social support, trauma history, and difficulty taking time off from work for treatment. Clinician factors included knowledge and skill handling perinatal depression, cultural competencies, and language barriers. Participants recommended better integration of mental health treatment with obstetric care, greater treatment convenience (e.g., telemedicine), and programmatic attention to cultural factors and social determinants of health. Women from diverse backgrounds with perinatal depression encounter individual-level, social, and clinician-related barriers to treatment engagement, necessitating care strategies that reduce stigma, offer convenience, and attend to cultural and economic factors. Our findings suggest the importance of intervention and policy approaches effecting change at multiple levels to increase perinatal depression treatment engagement.\n\nAuthors: Iturralde, Esti; Hsiao, Crystal A; Nkemere, Linda; Kubo, Ai; Sterling, Stacy A; Flanagan, Tracy; Avalos, Lyndsay A\n\nBMC Pregnancy Childbirth. 2021 Jul 16;21(1):512.

Most recommend ranking patients on the basis of their expected in-hospital mortality using the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, but it is unknown how SOFA or other acuity scores perform among patients of different races. Objectives: To test the prognostic accuracy of the SOFA score and version 2 of the Laboratory-based Acute Physiology Score (LAPS2) among Black and white patients. Methods: We included Black and white patients admitted for sepsis or acute respiratory failure at 27 hospitals. We calculated the discrimination and calibration for in-hospital mortality of SOFA, LAPS2, and modified versions of each, including categorical SOFA groups recommended in a popular CSC and a SOFA score without creatinine to reduce the influence of race. Measurements and Main Results: Of 113,158 patients, 27,644 (24.4%) identified as Black. The LAPS2 demonstrated higher discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76-0.77) than the SOFA score (AUC, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.68-0.69). The LAPS2 was also better calibrated than the SOFA score, but both underestimated in-hospital mortality for white patients and overestimated in-hospital mortality for Black patients. Thus, in a simulation using observed mortality, 81.6% of Black patients were included in lower-priority CSC categories, and 9.4% of all Black patients were erroneously excluded from receiving the highest prioritization. The SOFA score without creatinine reduced racial miscalibration. Conclusions: Using SOFA in CSCs may lead to racial disparities in resource allocation. More equitable mortality prediction scores are needed.\n\nAuthors: Ashana, Deepshikha Charan; Anesi, George L; Liu, Vincent X; Escobar, Gabriel J; Chesley, Christopher; Eneanya, Nwamaka D; Weissman, Gary E; Miller, William Dwight; Harhay, Michael O; Halpern, Scott D\n\nAm J Respir Crit Care Med. 2021 07 15;204(2):178-186.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nOperationalizing Social Environments in Cognitive Aging and Dementia Research: A Scoping Review\n\nSocial environments are a contributing determinant of health and disparities. This scoping review details how social environments have been operationalized in observational studies of cognitive aging and dementia. A systematic search in PubMed and Web of Science identified studies of social environment exposures and late-life cognition/dementia outcomes. Data were extracted on (1) study design; (2) population; (3) social environment(s); (4) cognitive outcome(s); (5) analytic approach; and (6) theorized causal pathways. Studies were organized using a 3-tiered social ecological model at interpersonal, community, or policy levels. Of 7802 non-duplicated articles, 123 studies met inclusion criteria. Eighty-four studies were longitudinal (range 1-28 years) and 16 examined time-varying social environments. When sorted into social ecological levels, 91 studies examined the interpersonal level; 37 examined the community/neighborhood level; 3 examined policy level social environments; and 7 studies examined more than one level. Most studies of social environments and cognitive aging and dementia examined interpersonal factors measured at a single point in time. Few assessed time-varying social environmental factors or considered multiple social ecological levels. Future studies can help clarify opportunities for intervention by delineating if, when, and how social environments shape late-life cognitive aging and dementia outcomes.\n\nAuthors: Peterson, Rachel L; George, Kristen M; Tran, Duyen; Malladi, Pallavi; Gilsanz, Paola; Kind, Amy J H; Whitmer, Rachel A; Besser, Lilah M; Meyer, Oanh L\n\nInt J Environ Res Public Health. 2021 07 04;18(13).

To inform health system strategies to address SDoH, we conducted a multi-stakeholder qualitative study to capture the multi-level influences on health for those living in socio-economically deprived contexts. Varied qualitative inquiry methods – in-depth interviews, participant-led neighborhood tours, and clinic visit observations – involving a total of 23 participants (10 patients with chronic illnesses in San Francisco neighborhoods with high chronic disease rates, 10 community leaders serving the same neighborhoods, and 3 providers from San Francisco’s public health care delivery system). Qualitative analyses were guided by the Chronic Care Model (CCM). Several key themes emerged from this study. First, we enumerated a large array, neighborhood resources such as food pantries, parks/green spaces, and financial assistance services that interact with patients’ self-management. Health service providers leveraged these resources to address patients’ social needs but suggested a clear need for expanding this work. Second, analyses uncovered multiple essential mechanisms by which community-based organizations (CBOs) provided and navigated among many neighborhood health resources, including social support and culturally aligned knowledge. Finally, many examples of how structural issues such as institutional racism, transportation, and housing inequities are intertwined with health and social service delivery were elucidated. The results contribute new evidence toward the community domain of the CCM. Health care systems must intentionally partner with CBOs to address SDoH and improve community resources for chronic care management, and directly address structural issues to make progress.\n\nAuthors: Nguyen, Kim Hanh; Fields, Jessica D; Cemballi, Anupama G; Desai, Riya; Gopalan, Anjali; Cruz, Tessa; Shah, Aekta; Akom, Antwi; Brown, William; Sarkar, Urmimala; Lyles, Courtney Rees\n\nJ Am Board Fam Med. 2021 Jul-Aug;34(4):698-708.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nRacial, ethnic, and gender disparities in hospitalizations among persons with HIV in the United States and Canada, 2005-2015\n\nTo examine recent trends and differences in all-cause and cause-specific hospitalization rates by race, ethnicity, and gender among persons with HIV (PWH) in the United States and Canada. HIV clinical cohort consortium. We followed PWH at least 18 years old in care 2005-2015 in six clinical cohorts. We used modified Clinical Classifications Software to categorize hospital discharge diagnoses. Incidence rate ratios (IRR) were estimated using Poisson regression with robust variances to compare racial and ethnic groups, stratified by gender, adjusted for cohort, calendar year, injection drug use history, and annually updated age, CD4+, and HIV viral load. Among 27 085 patients (122 566 person-years), 80% were cisgender men, 1% transgender, 43% White, 33% Black, 17% Hispanic of any race, and 1% Indigenous. Unadjusted all-cause hospitalization rates were higher for Black [IRR 1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32-1.61] and Indigenous (1.99, 1.44-2.74) versus White cisgender men, and for Indigenous versus White cisgender women (2.55, 1.68-3.89). Unadjusted AIDS-related hospitalization rates were also higher for Black, Hispanic, and Indigenous versus White cisgender men (all P < 0.05). Transgender patients had 1.50 times (1.05-2.14) and cisgender women 1.37 times (1.26-1.48) the unadjusted hospitalization rate of cisgender men. In adjusted analyses, among both cisgender men and women, Black patients had higher rates of cardiovascular and renal/genitourinary hospitalizations compared to Whites (all P < 0.05). Black, Hispanic, Indigenous, women, and transgender PWH in the United States and Canada experienced substantially higher hospitalization rates than White patients and cisgender men, respectively.

The objective of this study was to examine to what extent the association between race/ethnicity and risk of TNBC is mediated by potentially modifiable factors. A total of 128,623 Black and White women aged 50-79 years from the Women’s Health Initiative were followed for a mean of 15.8 years. 643 incident TNBC cases (92 Black women and 551 White women) were confirmed by medical record review. Mediation analyses were conducted using an approach under a counterfactual framework. Black women had approximately twofold higher risk of TNBC compared with white women (HR = 1.93, 95% CI 1.52-2.45). We observed that 48% of the racial disparity was mediated by metabolic dysfunction defined by having 3 or more cardiometabolic risk factors including elevated waist circumference, having history of diabetes, high cholesterol and hypertension. The racial disparity was not significantly mediated by other factors studied, including socioeconomic, lifestyle or reproductive factors. Our study observed that approximately half of the racial disparity between postmenopausal Black and White women in TNBC incidence was driven by metabolic dysfunction.\n\nAuthors: Luo, Juhua; Kroenke, Candyce H; Wactawski-Wende, Jean; et al.\n\nBreast Cancer Res Treat. 2021 Jul;188(1):283-293.

Compared with White persons, adjusted testing rates among non-White persons were marginally higher, but infection rates were significantly higher; adjusted odds ratios [aORs] for African American persons, Hispanic persons, Asian persons, and persons of other/unknown race were 2.01 (95% CI, 1.75 to 2.31), 3.93 (CI, 3.59 to 4.30), 2.19 (CI, 1.98 to 2.42), and 1.57 (CI, 1.38 to 1.78), respectively. Geographic analyses showed that infections clustered in areas with higher proportions of non-White persons. Compared with White persons, adjusted hospitalization rates for African American persons, Hispanic persons, Asian persons, and persons of other/unknown race were 1.47 (CI, 1.03 to 2.09), 1.42 (CI, 1.11 to 1.82), 1.47 (CI, 1.13 to 1.92), and 1.03 (CI, 0.72 to 1.46), respectively. Adjusted analyses showed no racial differences in inpatient mortality or total mortality during the study period. For testing, comorbid conditions made the greatest relative contribution to model explanatory power (77.9%); race only accounted for 8.1%. Likelihood of infection was largely due to race (80.3%). For other outcomes, age was most important; race only contributed 4.5% for hospitalization, 12.8% for admission illness severity, 2.3% for in-hospital death, and 0.4% for any death. The study involved an insured population in a highly integrated health system. Race was the most important predictor of SARS-CoV-2 infection. After infection, race was associated with increased hospitalization risk but not mortality.

However, the relationship among American Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN) individuals is poorly understood, particularly among those who reside in urban areas. We evaluated whether AET initiation and adherence were lower among AIAN individuals than those of other races/ethnicities who were enrolled in the Kaiser Permanente of Northern California (KPNC) health system. We identified 23,680 patients from the period 1997 to 2014 who were eligible for AET (first primary, stage I-III, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer) and used KPNC pharmacy records to identify AET prescriptions and refill dates. We assessed AET initiation (≥1 filled prescription within 1 year of diagnosis) and AET adherence (proportion of days covered ≥80%) every year up to 5 years after AET initiation. At the end of the 5-year follow-up period, 83% of patients were AET initiators, and 58% were AET adherent. Compared with other races/ethnicities, AIAN women had the second-lowest rate of AET initiation (non-Hispanic Black [NHB], 78.0%; AIAN, 78.6%; Hispanic, 83.0%; non-Hispanic White [NHW], 82.5%; Asian/Pacific Islander [API], 84.7%), the lowest rate of AET adherence after 1 year and 5 years of follow-up (70.3% and 50.8%, respectively), and the greatest annual decline in AET adherence during the 4- to 5-year period of follow-up (a 13.8% decrease in AET adherence [from 64.6% to 50.8%]) after initiation of AET. In adjusted multivariable models, AIAN, Hispanic, and NHB women were less likely than NHW women to be AET adherent. At the end of the 5-year period, total underutilization (combining initiation and adherence) in AET-eligible patients was greatest among AIAN (70.6%) patients, followed by NHB (69.6%), Hispanic (63.2%), NHW (58.7%), and API (52.3%) patients, underscoring the AET treatment gap. Our results suggest that AET initiation and adherence are particularly low for insured AIAN women.\n\nAuthors: Emerson, Marc A; Achacoso, Ninah S; Benefield, Halei C; Troester, Melissa A; Habel, Laurel A\n\nCancer. 2021 06 01;127(11):1847-1856.

This statement highlights the importance of recognizing APOs when CVD risk is evaluated in women, although their value in reclassifying risk may not be established. A history of APOs is a prompt for more vigorous primordial prevention of CVD risk factors and primary prevention of CVD. Adopting a heart-healthy diet and increasing physical activity among women with APOs, starting in the postpartum setting and continuing across the life span, are important lifestyle interventions to decrease CVD risk. Lactation and breastfeeding may lower a woman’s later cardiometabolic risk. Black and Asian women experience a higher proportion APOs, with more severe clinical presentation and worse outcomes, than White women. More studies on APOs and CVD in non-White women are needed to better understand and address these health disparities. Future studies of aspirin, statins, and metformin may better inform our recommendations for pharmacotherapy in primary CVD prevention among women who have had an APO. Several opportunities exist for health care systems to improve transitions of care for women with APOs and to implement strategies to reduce their long-term CVD risk. One proposed strategy includes incorporation of the concept of a fourth trimester into clinical recommendations and health care policy.\n\nAuthors: Parikh, Nisha I; Gonzalez, Juan M; Anderson, Cheryl A M; Judd, Suzanne E; Rexrode, Kathryn M; Hlatky, Mark A; Gunderson, Erica P; Stuart, Jennifer J; Vaidya, Dhananjay; American Heart Association Council on Epidemiology and Prevention; Council on Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular Biology; Council on Cardiovascular and Stroke Nursing; and the Stroke Council,\n\nCirculation. 2021 05 04;143(18):e902-e916.

These findings have not been consistently replicated in preschool-aged children. We examined sex-based differences in a large sample of 2-5-year-old children with ASD symptoms in a multi-site community-based study. Based on a comprehensive evaluation, children were classified as having ASD (n = 1480, 81.55 % male) or subthreshold ASD characteristics (n = 593, 70.15 % male). Outcomes were behavior problems, developmental abilities, performance on ASD screening and diagnostic tests, and parent-reported developmental conditions diagnosed before study enrollment. We found no statistically significant sex differences in behavioral functioning, developmental functioning, performance on an ASD screening test, and developmental conditions diagnosed before study enrollment among children with ASD or subthreshold ASD characteristics. Males in both study groups had more parent reported restricted interests and repetitive behaviors than females, but these differences were small in magnitude and not clinically meaningful. Preschool males and females who showed risk for ASD were more similar than different in the outcomes assessed in our study. Future research could examine sex-based differences in ASD phenotypes as children age.\n\nAuthors: Wiggins, Lisa D; Croen, Lisa; Schieve, Laura; et al.\n\nRes Dev Disabil. 2021 May;112:103897.

Participants were 140 physician trainees (‘providers’). Providers viewed videos and vignettes of virtual patients differing in immigrant status (born in Mexico or U.S.; other characteristics held constant). Analyses were completed at the group and individual levels. Providers were less likely to refer foreign-born (vs. U.S.-born) patients to endocrinology. Individual-level results showed an almost even split between treatment ratings for foreign-born vs. U.S.-born patients for three decisions (take no action, add oral hypoglycemic agent, add/switch to insulin), explaining why group-level differences for these ratings did not emerge (i.e., they were cancelled out). Physician trainees are less likely to refer foreign-born patients to endocrinology. Half of individual-level decisions were influenced by patient immigrant status, but group-level analyses mask these differences. Systematic treatment differences based on non-relevant factors could lead to adverse outcomes for immigrants.\n\nAuthors: Hsueh L; Hirsh AT; Zapolski T; de Groot M; Mather KJ; Stewart JC\n\nJ Behav Med. 2021 Apr 16.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nImproving adherence to guideline-directed medical therapies and outcomes in the developing world: A call to end global inequities in heart failure\n\nAuthors: Chioncel, Ovidiu; Ambrosy, Andrew P\n\nInt J Cardiol. 2021 04 15;329:74-76.

Less is known about whether CVRF identified before midlife impact late-life cognition in diverse populations. Linear regression models examined hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and overweight/obesity at ages 30 to 59 with late-life executive function, semantic memory, verbal episodic memory, and global cognition in a cohort of Asians, blacks, Latinos, and whites (n=1127; mean age=75.8, range=65 to 98). Models adjusted for age at CVRF, age at cognitive assessment, sex, race/ethnicity, participant education, and parental education. Overall, 34% had 1 CVRF at ages 30 to 59; 19% had 2+. Blacks (26%) and Latinos (23%) were more likely to have 2+ CVRF than Asians (14%) or whites (13%). Having 2+ CVRF was associated with lower global cognition [β=-0.33; 95% confidence interval (CI)=-0.45, -0.21], executive function (β=-0.26; 95% CI=-0.39, -0.13), verbal episodic memory (β=-0.34; 95% CI=-0.48, -0.20), and semantic memory (β=-0.20; 95% CI=-0.33, -0.07). Interaction by age (P=0.06) indicated overweight/obesity was negatively associated with executive function at ages 30 to 39 but not at ages 40 to 59. Race/ethnic-specific effects showed disparities in CVRF prevalence impact population disparities in late-life cognition. Being overweight/obese in early adulthood and having 2+ CVRF in early adulthood/midlife are modifiable targets to redress racial/ethnic disparities in cognitive impairment and dementia.\n\nAuthors: Peterson, Rachel L; George, Kristen M; Gilsanz, Paola; Ackley, Sarah; Mayeda, Elizabeth R; Glymour, M M; Mungas, Dan M; DeCarli, Charles; Whitmer, Rachel A\n\nAlzheimer Dis Assoc Disord. 2021 Apr-Jun 01;35(2):99-105.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nAge-Related Development of Cardiac Remodeling and Dysfunction in Young Black and White Adults: the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults Study\n\nLittle is known about the timing of preclinical heart failure (HF) development, particularly among blacks. The primary aims of this study were to delineate age-related left ventricular (LV) structure and function evolution in a biracial cohort and to test the hypothesis that young-adult LV parameters within normative ranges would be associated with incident stage B-defining LV abnormalities over 25 years, independent of cumulative risk factor burden. Data from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study were analyzed. Participants (n = 2,833) had a mean baseline age of 30.1 years; 45% were black, and 56% were women. Generalized estimating equation logistic regression was used to estimate age-related probabilities of stage B LV abnormalities (remodeling, hypertrophy, or dysfunction) and logistic regression to examine risk factor-adjusted associations between baseline LV parameters and incident abnormalities. Cox regression was used to assess whether baseline LV parameters associated with incident stage B LV abnormalities were also associated with incident clinical (stage C/D) HF events over >25 years’ follow-up. Probabilities of stage B LV abnormalities at ages 25 and 60 years were 10.5% (95% CI, 9.4%-11.8%) and 45.0% (95% CI, 42.0%-48.1%), with significant race-sex disparities (e.g., at age 60, black men 52.7% [95% CI, 44.9%-60.3%], black women 59.4% [95% CI, 53.6%-65.0%], white men 39.1% [95% CI, 33.4%-45.0%], and white women 39.1% [95% CI, 33.9%-44.6%]). Over 25 years, baseline LV end-systolic dimension indexed to height was associated with incident systolic dysfunction (adjusted odds ratio per 1 SD higher, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.87-3.52), eccentric hypertrophy (1.34; 95% CI, 1.02-1.75), concentric hypertrophy (0.69; 95% CI, 0.51-0.91), and concentric remodeling (0.68; 95% CI, 0.58-0.79); baseline LV mass indexed to height2.7 was associated with incident eccentric hypertrophy (1.70; 95% CI, 1.25-2.32]), concentric hypertrophy (1.63; 95% CI, 1.19-2.24), and diastolic dysfunction (1.24; 95% CI, 1.01-1.52). Among the entire cohort with baseline echocardiographic data available (n = 4,097; 72 HF events), LV end-systolic dimension indexed to height and LV mass indexed to height2.7 were significantly associated with incident clinical HF (adjusted hazard ratios per 1 SD higher, 1.56 [95% CI, 1.26-1.93] and 1.42 [95% CI, 1.14-1.75], respectively). Stage B LV abnormalities and related racial disparities were present in young adulthood, increased with age, and were associated with baseline variation in indexed LV end-systolic dimension and mass. Baseline indexed LV end-systolic dimension and mass were also associated with incident clinical HF. Efforts to prevent the LV abnormalities underlying clinical HF should start from a young age.\n\nAuthors: Perak, Amanda M; Khan, Sadiya S; Colangelo, Laura A; Gidding, Samuel S; Armstrong, Anderson C; Lewis, Cora E; Reis, Jared P; Schreiner, Pamela J; Sidney, Stephen; Lima, Joao A C; Lloyd-Jones, Donald M\n\nJ Am Soc Echocardiogr. 2021 04;34(4):388-400.

We investigated whether the association between educational attainment and cognition differed between White, Black, Asian, and Latino participants in the Kaiser Healthy Aging and Diverse Life Experiences study (n=1348). Covariate-adjusted multivariable linear regression models examined domains of verbal episodic memory, semantic memory, and executive functioning. We observed significant effect heterogeneity by race/ethnicity only for verbal episodic memory (P=0.0198), for which any schooling between high school and college was beneficial for White, Asian, and Black participants, but not Latino participants. We found no evidence of heterogeneity for semantic memory or executive function. With the exception of Latino performance on verbal episodic memory, more education consistently predicted better cognitive scores to a similar extent across racial/ethnic groups, despite likely heterogenous educational and social experiences.\n\nAuthors: Eng, Chloe W; Glymour, Medellena Maria; Gilsanz, Paola; Mungas, Dan M; Mayeda, Elizabeth R; Meyer, Oanh L; Whitmer, Rachel A\n\nAlzheimer Dis Assoc Disord. 2021 Apr-Jun 01;35(2):106-113.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nDisparities in Preventable Mortality from Colorectal Cancer: are they the result of structural racism?\n\nAuthors: Doubeni, Chyke A; Selby, Kevin; Levin, Theodore R\n\nGastroenterology. 2021 03;160(4):1022-1025.

Using multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, we assessed associations of race/ethnicity with ER/PR-specific breast cancer mortality in 10,366 California women diagnosed with breast cancer from 1993 to 2009. We evaluated joint associations of race/ethnicity, health care, sociodemographic, and lifestyle factors with mortality. Among women with ER/PR+ breast cancer, breast cancer-specific mortality was similar among Hispanic and Asian American women, but higher among African American women [HR, 1.31; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.05-1.63] compared with non-Hispanic White (NHW) women. Breast cancer-specific mortality was modified by surgery type, hospital type, education, neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES), smoking history, and alcohol consumption. Among African American women, breast cancer-specific mortality was higher among those treated at nonaccredited hospitals (HR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.21-2.04) and those from lower SES neighborhoods (HR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.16-1.88) compared with NHW women without these characteristics. Breast cancer-specific mortality was higher among African American women with at least some college education (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.11-1.82) compared with NHW women with similar education. For ER-/PR- disease, breast cancer-specific mortality did not differ by race/ethnicity and associations of race/ethnicity with breast cancer-specific mortality varied only by neighborhood SES among African American women. Racial/ethnic survival disparities are more striking for ER/PR+ than ER-/PR- breast cancer. Social determinants and lifestyle factors may explain some of the survival disparities for ER/PR+ breast cancer. Addressing these factors may help reduce the higher mortality of African American women with ER/PR+ breast cancer.\n\nAuthors: John, Esther M; Kwan, Marilyn L; Wu, Anna H; et al.\n\nCancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev. 2021 02;30(2):351-363.

However, PUD remains a common cause of hospitalization in the United States. We aimed to evaluate contemporary national trends in the incidence, treatment patterns, and outcomes for PUD-related hospitalizations and compare care delivery by hospital rurality. Data from the National Inpatient Sample were used to estimate weighted annual rates of PUD-related hospitalizations. Temporal trends were evaluated by joinpoint regression and expressed as annual percent change with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We determined the proportion of hospitalizations requiring endoscopic and surgical interventions, stratified by clinical presentation and rurality. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess independent predictors of in-hospital mortality and postoperative morbidity. There was a 25.8% reduction (P < 0.001) in PUD-related hospitalizations from 2005 to 2014, although the rate of decline decreased from -7.2% per year (95% CI: 13.2% to -0.7%) before 2008 to -2.1% per year (95% CI: 3.0% to -1.1%) after 2008. In-hospital mortality was 2.4% (95% CI: 2.4%-2.5%). Upper endoscopy (84.3% vs 78.4%, P < 0.001) and endoscopic hemostasis (26.1% vs 16.8%, P < 0.001) were more likely to be performed in urban hospitals, whereas surgery was performed less frequently (9.7% vs 10.5%, P < 0.001). In multivariable logistic regression, patients managed in urban hospitals were at higher risk for postoperative morbidity (odds ratio 1.16 [95% CI: 1.04-1.29]), but not death (odds ratio 1.11 [95% CI: 1.00-1.23]).

Little is known about COVID-19 in the general population of pregnant women. To describe the prevalence of COVID-19, symptoms, consequent healthcare use, and possible sources of COVID-19 exposure among a population-based sample of pregnant women residing in Northern California. We analyzed data from 19,458 members of Kaiser Permanente Northern California who were pregnant between January 2020 and April 2021 and responded to an online survey about COVID-19 testing, diagnosis, symptoms, and their experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. Medical diagnosis of COVID-19 during pregnancy was defined separately by self-report and by documentation in electronic health records (EHR). We examined relationships of COVID-19 with sociodemographic factors, underlying comorbidities, and survey measures of COVID-19-like symptoms, consequent healthcare utilization, and possible COVID-19 exposures. Among 19,458 respondents, the crude prevalence of COVID-19 was 2.5% (n = 494) according to self-report and 1.4% (n = 276) according to EHR. After adjustment, the prevalence of self-reported COVID-19 was higher among women aged <25 years compared with women aged ≥35 years (prevalence ratio [PR], 1.75, 95% CI: 1.23, 2.49) and among Hispanic women compared with White women (PR, 1.91, 95% CI: 1.53, 2.37). Prevalence of self-reported COVID-19 was higher among women affected by personal or partner job loss during the pandemic (PR, 1.23, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.47) and among women living in areas of high vs. low neighborhood deprivation (PR, 1.74, 95% CI: 1.33, 2.27). We did not observe differences in self-reported COVID-19 between women with and without underlying comorbidities. Results were similar for EHR-documented COVID-19. Loss of smell or taste was a unique and common symptom reported among women with COVID-19 (42.3% in self-reported; 54.0% in EHR-documented). Among women with symptomatic COVID-19, approximately 2% were hospitalized, 71% had a telehealth visit, and 75% quarantined at home. Over a third of women with COVID-19 reported no known exposure to someone with COVID-19. Observed COVID-19 prevalence differences by sociodemographic and socioeconomic factors underscore social and health inequities among reproductive-aged women.

Our study sought to quantify variance in early-onset CRC survival accounted for by individual/community-level characteristics among a population-based cohort of US women. Geographic hot spots-counties with high early-onset CRC mortality rates among women-were derived using 3 geospatial autocorrelation approaches with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention national mortality data. We identified women (age: 15-49 years) diagnosed with CRC from 1999 to 2016 in the National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. Patterns of community health behaviors by hot spot classification were assessed by Spearman correlation (ρ). Generalized R values were used to evaluate variance in survival attributed to individual/community-level features. Approximately 1 in every 16 contiguous US counties identified as hot spots (191 of 3,108), and 52.9% of hot spot counties (n = 101) were located in the South. Among 28,790 women with early-onset CRC, 13.7% of cases (n = 3,954) resided in hot spot counties. Physical inactivity and fertility were community health behaviors that modestly correlated with hot spot residence among women with early-onset CRC (ρ = 0.21 and ρ = -0.23, respectively; P < 0.01). Together, individual/community-level features accounted for distinct variance patterns in early-onset CRC survival among women (hot spot counties: 33.8%; non-hot spot counties: 34.1%). Individual/community-level features accounted for approximately one-third of variation in early-onset CRC survival among women and differed between hot spot vs non-hot spot counties. Understanding the impact of community health behaviors-particularly in regions with high early-onset CRC mortality rates-is critical for tailoring strategies to reduce early-onset CRC disparities.\n\nAuthors: Holowatyj AN; Langston ME; Han Y; Viskochil R; Perea J; Cao Y; Rogers CR; Lieu CH; Moore JX\n\nClin Transl Gastroenterol. 2020 Dec;11(12):e00266.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nImpact of nulliparity, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and gestational diabetes on vasomotor symptoms in midlife women\n\nTo determine whether women with a history of nulliparity, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), or gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have a higher odds of reporting vasomotor symptoms (VMS) at midlife. A longitudinal analysis was performed with 2,249 women with pregnancy history data in the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation. Women were classified as nulliparous, no HDP/GDM, or a history of HDP/GDM. VMS (hot flashes, night sweats) were assessed separately at baseline and at each follow-up visit. VMS was recorded as any versus none; 0 , 1-5 , 6+ days in past 2 weeks. Pregnancy history was examined in relation to each VMS (hot flashes, night sweats) using generalized estimating equations adjusting for age (time-varying), site, race/ethnicity, education, financial strain, smoking, and body mass index. Models excluded women with hysterectomy/bilateral oophorectomy and observations with hormone therapy use. Women in the HDP/GDM group (n = 208, 9%) were more likely to be Black, financially strained, and overweight. Compared to women with no HDP/GDM, women with HDP/GDM had greater odds of reporting any hot flashes (OR:1.27; 95% CI:1.05-1.53). Nulliparous women had lower odds of any hot flashes (OR:0.64; 95% CI:0.51-0.80) and night sweats (OR:0.73; 95% CI:0.58-0.93) in age-adjusted models. Similar patterns were observed for frequency of hot flashes and night sweats; associations were attenuated to nonsignificance after adjusting for covariates. History of HDP/GDM may be associated with more VMS and nulliparity with fewer VMS, but not independently of sociodemographic factors. Our findings underscore the importance of social and economic disparities in both reproductive outcomes and VMS.

To inform health policy, it is useful to investigate how enrollment through ACA Exchanges, deductible levels, and demographic factors are associated with health care utilization and HIV clinical outcomes among individuals newly enrolled in insurance coverage following implementation of the ACA. Among PWH newly enrolled in an integrated health care system (Kaiser Permanente Northern California) in 2014 (N = 880), we examined use of health care and modeled associations between enrollment mechanisms (enrolled in a Qualified Health Plan through the California Exchange vs. other sources), deductibles (none, $1-$999 and > = $1000), receipt of benefits from the California AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP), demographic factors, and three-year patterns of health service utilization (primary care, psychiatry, substance treatment, emergency, inpatient) and HIV outcomes (CD4 counts; viral suppression at HIV RNA < 75 copies/mL). Health care use was greatest immediately after enrollment and decreased over 3 years. Those with high deductibles were less likely to use primary care (OR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.49-0.84, p < 0.01) or psychiatry OR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.37, 0.94, p = 0.03) than those with no deductible. Enrollment via the Exchange was associated with fewer psychiatry visits (rate ratio [RR] = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.18-0.86; p = 0.02), but ADAP was associated with more psychiatry visits (RR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.24-4.71; p = 0.01). Those with high deductibles were less likely to have viral suppression (OR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.42-1.00; p = 0.05), but ADAP enrollment was associated with viral suppression (OR = 2.20, 95% CI = 1.32-3.66, p < 0.01). Black (OR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.21-0.58, p < 0.01) and Hispanic (OR = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.29-0.85, p = 0.01) PWH were less likely to be virally suppressed. In this sample of PWH newly enrolled in an integrated health care system in California, findings suggest that enrollment via the Exchange and higher deductibles were negatively associated with some aspects of service utilization, high deductibles were associated with worse HIV outcomes, but support from ADAP appeared to help patients achieve viral suppression. Race/ethnic disparities remain important to address even among those with access to insurance coverage.\n\nAuthors: Satre, Derek D; Parthasarathy, Sujaya; Silverberg, Michael J; Horberg, Michael; Young-Wolff, Kelly C; Williams, Emily C; Volberding, Paul; Campbell, Cynthia I\n\nBMC Health Serv Res. 2020 Nov 11;20(1):1030.

Systemic racism and racial/ethnic injustice produce racial/ethnic disparities in health care and health. Substantial racial/ethnic disparities in stroke care and health exist and result predominantly from unequal treatment. This special report aims to summarize selected interventions to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in stroke prevention and treatment. It reviews the social determinants of health and the determinants of racial/ethnic disparities in care. It provides a focused summary of selected interventions aimed at reducing stroke risk factors, increasing awareness of stroke symptoms, and improving access to care for stroke because these interventions hold the promise of reducing racial/ethnic disparities in stroke death rates. It also discusses knowledge gaps and future directions.\n\nAuthors: Levine, Deborah A; Duncan, Pamela W; Nguyen-Huynh, Mai N; Ogedegbe, Olugbenga G\n\nStroke. 2020 11;51(11):3425-3432.

Men diagnosed with localized, Gleason ≤7 prostate cancer who were not treated within 1 year of diagnosis from 1997-2007 were identified. Cumulative incidence rates of the following events were calculated; treatment initiation, metastasis, death due to prostate cancer and all-cause mortality, accounting for competing risks. The Cox model of all-cause mortality and Fine-Gray sub distribution model to account for competing risks were used to test for racial/ethnic differences in outcomes adjusted for clinical factors. There were 3925 men in the study, 749 Hispanic, 2415 non-Hispanic white, 559 non-Hispanic African American, and 202 non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander (API). Median follow-up was 9.3 years. At 19 years, overall cumulative incidence of treatment, metastasis, death due to prostate cancer, and all-cause mortality was 25.0%, 14.7%, 11.7%, and 67.8%, respectively. In adjusted models compared to non-Hispanic whites, African Americans had higher rates of treatment (HR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.15-1.68); they had an increased risk of metastasis beyond 10 years after diagnosis (HR = 4.70, 95% CI = 2.30-9.61); API and Hispanic had lower rates of all-cause mortality (HR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.52-0.84, and HR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.62-0.85, respectively), and API had lower rates of prostate cancer mortality in the first 10 years after diagnosis (HR = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.09-0.90) and elevated risks beyond 10 years (HR = 5.41, 95% CI = 1.39-21.11). Significant risks of metastasis and prostate cancer mortality exist in untreated men beyond 10 years after diagnosis, but are not equally distributed among racial/ethnic groups.\n\nAuthors: Slezak, Jeff M; Van Den Eeden, Stephen K; Cannavale, Kimberly L; Chien, Gary W; Jacobsen, Steven J; Chao, Chun R\n\nCancer Med. 2020 11;9(22):8530-8539.

Physical performance was evaluated using a decile score derived from grip strength, timed 4 m walk, and timed repeat chair stand in 1,855 African American, Caucasian, Chinese, Hispanic, and Japanese women, mean age = 61.8 (SD = 2.7) in the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation. Mediators included education, financial strain, comorbidities, pain, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, and perceived stress. Structural equation models provided estimates of the total difference in physical performance between Caucasians and each race/ethnic groups and differences due to direct effects of race/ethnicity and indirect effects through mediators. The mean decile score for Caucasian women was 16.9 (SD = 5.6), 1.8, 2.6, and 2.1 points higher than the model-estimated scores in African Americans, Hispanics and Chinese, respectively, and 1.3 points lower than the Japanese. Differences between Caucasians and the Chinese and Japanese were direct effects of race/ethnicity whereas in African Americans and Hispanics 75% or more of that disparity was through mediators, particularly education, financial strain, BMI, physical activity, and pain. Addressing issues of poverty, racial inequality, pain, and obesity could reduce some racial/ethnic disparity in functional limitations as women age.\n\nAuthors: Sternfeld B; Colvin A; Stewart A; Appelhans BM; Cauley JA; Dugan SA; El Khoudary SR; Greendale GA; Strotmeyer E; Karvonen-Gutierrez C\n\nJ Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci. 2020 10 16;75(9):1961-1971.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nAddressing Disparities in Lung Cancer Screening Eligibility and Healthcare Access. An Official American Thoracic Society Statement\n\nBackground: There are well-documented disparities in lung cancer outcomes across populations. Lung cancer screening (LCS) has the potential to reduce lung cancer mortality, but for this benefit to be realized by all high-risk groups, there must be careful attention to ensuring equitable access to this lifesaving preventive health measure.Objectives: To outline current knowledge on disparities in eligibility criteria for, access to, and implementation of LCS, and to develop an official American Thoracic Society statement to propose strategies to optimize current screening guidelines and resource allocation for equitable LCS implementation and dissemination.Methods: A multidisciplinary panel with expertise in LCS, implementation science, primary care, pulmonology, health behavior, smoking cessation, epidemiology, and disparities research was convened. Participants reviewed available literature on historical disparities in cancer screening and emerging evidence of disparities in LCS.Results: Existing LCS guidelines do not consider racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and sex-based differences in smoking behaviors or lung cancer risk. Multiple barriers, including access to screening and cost, further contribute to the inequities in implementation and dissemination of LCS.Conclusions: This statement identifies the impact of LCS eligibility criteria on vulnerable populations who are at increased risk of lung cancer but do not meet eligibility criteria for screening, as well as multiple barriers that contribute to disparities in LCS implementation. Strategies to improve the selection and dissemination of LCS in vulnerable groups are described.\n\nAuthors: Rivera, M Patricia; Sakoda, Lori C; Aldrich, Melinda C; et al.\n\nAm J Respir Crit Care Med. 2020 10 01;202(7):e95-e112.\n\nPubMed abstract\n\nBody mass index versus bioelectrical impedance analysis for classifying physical function impairment in a racially diverse cohort of midlife women: the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN)\n\nBody composition strongly influences physical function in older adults. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) differentiates fat mass from skeletal muscle mass, and may be more useful than body mass index (BMI) for classifying women on their likelihood of physical function impairment. This study tested whether BIA-derived estimates of percentage body fat (%BF) and height-normalized skeletal muscle mass (skeletal muscle mass index; SMI) enhance classification of physical function impairment relative to BMI. Black, White, Chinese, and Japanese midlife women (N = 1482) in the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN) completed performance-based measures of physical function. BMI (kg/m2) was calculated. %BF and SMI were derived through BIA. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, conducted in the overall sample and stratified by racial group, evaluated optimal cutpoints of BMI, %BF, and SMI for classifying women on moderate-severe physical function impairment. In the overall sample, a BMI cutpoint of ≥ 30.1 kg/m2 correctly classified 71.1% of women on physical function impairment, and optimal cutpoints for %BF (≥ 43.4%) and SMI (≥ 8.1 kg/m2) correctly classified 69% and 62% of women, respectively. SMI did not meaningfully enhanced classification relative to BMI (change in area under the ROC curve = 0.002; net reclassification improvement = 0.021; integrated discrimination improvement = - 0.003). Optimal cutpoints for BMI, %BF, and SMI varied substantially across race. Among Black women, a %BF cutpoint of 43.9% performed somewhat better than BMI (change in area under the ROC curve = 0.017; sensitivity = 0.69, specificity = 0.64). Some race-specific BMI and %BF cutpoints have moderate utility for identifying impaired physical function among midlife women.\n\nAuthors: Appelhans BM; Lange-Maia BS; Pettee Gabriel K; Karvonen-Gutierrez C; Karavolos K; Dugan SA; Greendale GA; Avery EF; Sternfeld B; Janssen I; Kravitz HM\n\nAging Clin Exp Res. 2020 Sep;32(9):1739-1747.
