        "text": "1818, A stagecoach ran between Cleveland and Painesville.\n\n1834-42, The first rail line, Cleveland & Newburgh, operated along Euclid Avenue, from Public Square to Wade Park.\n\n1841, Omnibus service -- a horse-drawn carriage for large groups of riders – started operation between Downtown hotels and railroad stations.\n\n1859, First street railway operated between Downtown and East 55th Street. A horse-drawn streetcar pulled a coach on rails secured in the streets for smoother ride.\n\n1860s and 1870s, Three suburban steam lines provided uncoordinated transportation.\n\n1884-1901, The transportation system was electrified and consolidated. The first commercial electric railway in the USA ran in Cleveland. As trolleys gained popularity in the late 1800s, Cleveland had 425 miles of streetcar lines.\n\n1903, Marcus Hanna consolidated smaller lines as the Cleveland Electric Railway Co.\n\n1904, Cleveland Railway began operation of a Murray chain-driven “Opera” bus.\n\nOct. 1, 1908, First mass-produced “Model T” car was sold.\n\n1925, Cleveland’s bus era began when the Motor Coach Division of Cleveland Railway began to operate a Downtown loop. Ridership losses, caused by the popularity of the automobile, forced the transit company to seek a more economical vehicle mode. This resulted in a gradual conversion from streetcar to bus operation.\n\n1930-1940, Ridership during the Depression rose to 299 million.\n\n1941-1945, During World War II, ridership rose to 446 million in 1946.\n\nNov. 15, 1958, Triskett Bus Garage dedicated.\n\n1913-20, Cleveland’s rapid transit system started when brothers O.P. and M.J. Van Sweringen developed the City of Shaker Heights. They connected the suburb and their Terminal Tower project with a private right-of-way light-rail, now called the Green Line and the Blue Line.\n\nDec. 17, 1913, First-light-rail train begins operation.\n\nJuly 20, 1930, Shaker Rapid cars began using the Cleveland Union Terminal (CUT), after the Terminal Tower opened.\n\nFeb. 4, 1952, The Cleveland Transit System (CTS) broke ground for a heavy rail system behind the Windermere Carbarn, now known as the Louis Stokes Station at Windermere.\n\nMarch 15, 1955, Service began between Tower City and Windermere. More than 8 million people rode the Red Line that year. The cars were known as \"Bluebirds\", because of their blue paint scheme.\n\nAug. 14, 1955, The Red Line was extended from the Cleveland Union Terminal to West 117th Street and Madison Avenue.\n\nMarch 1957, Cuyahoga County Engineer Albert Porter recommended against building a Downtown subway system.\n\nNov. 15, 1958, Red Line rail service extended 1.8 miles from the West 117th Street Station to the Triskett Station and the West 143rd/Lorain Station.

These events helped lead to the creation of a regional system.\n\n1974, In its last full year of operation, CTS operated with a net loss of $6.9 million, which was paid with reserve funds. This was the first year that the State provided funding for capital projects. The fleet of 706 buses and 116 Rapid cars operated 21.9 million vehicle miles annually. CTS completed the West Side rail shop in Brook Park.\n\nNov. 1, 1974, Leonard Ronis became General Manager of CTS.\n\nBackground, Cleveland was the last major city in the nation to operate a transit system largely based on farebox revenues. Because of this, service improvements and maintenance of facilities and equipment suffered. To continue effective service, officials sought to create a regional tax base and apply for federal funds.\n\n1970, The Ohio General Assembly passed legislation permitting communities to set up regional transit authorities.\n\n1972-1974, Five Greater Cleveland counties participated in a $750,000 mass transit study. The study proposed $1 billion in transit improvements, and was a prerequisite for receiving federal mass transit funds.\n\nJune 12, 1974, The Ohio Senate passed SB 544, which provided for regional transit authorities to be created with a dedicated tax base.\n\nNov. 26, 1974, President Ford signed the National Mass Transportation Act, with $11.8 billion in transit improvements over six years.

The 71 percent plurality was the largest ever in this nation for a transit issue.\n\nSept. 5, 1975, The Cleveland and Shaker services merged when RTA assumed control of all Cleveland Transit System (CTS) bus routes, and both the CTS and Shaker Rapid transit lines. Leonard Ronis was named the first General Manager. Offices were at 1404 E. Ninth St.\n\nOct. 5, 1975, Full operations began when buses from suburban lines in Maple Heights, North Olmsted, Brecksville, Garfield Heights and Euclid joined RTA through service agreements.\n\nOct. 5, 1975, Ridership surged 19 percent in the first month, with 378,000 average weekday riders.
