        "text": "Disclaimer/Explanation for Disciplinary Documentation:\n\nAccusations are posted online via License Lookup once they are filed and served on the respondent. An accusation is a formal legal document that notifies a licensee of the agency's charges and allegations of violations against the licensee and that requests a disciplinary order. The licensee is entitled to contest the charges in a formal hearing before an administrative law judge. An accusation is usually resolved by an agency decision following such a hearing or by an agency decision pursuant to a settlement agreement. Often there is a considerable period of time between the date of filing an accusation and the resolution of the accusation. An accusation is resolved through a final disciplinary decision. It is important to remember that the accusation contains only allegations of violations; it does not contain findings or determinations of violations. To determine if a licensee has an Accusation pending against him or her, please check the licensee's record on License Lookup.\n\nFinal disciplinary decisions are posted on the web site once they become final and effective. A final disciplinary decision is a formal legal document that results from the agency's adoption of a proposed decision prepared by an administrative law judge, a settlement agreement, or a default decision. A final disciplinary decision contains findings, determinations, and an order. If there are findings of violations, the order may include revocation or suspension of the license, a stayed revocation or suspension of the license with a probationary period and terms and conditions or probation, or a public reproval. In the alternative, the decision may find that no violations or violations of a de minimum nature occurred and order the dismissal of the accusation. When the final disciplinary decision is posted on the web site, the accusation is included with the final disciplinary decision and removed from the web site as a separate posted document. Only those decisions which have become final since 2006 and that meet the Board's Disclosure Policy for posting on the website will be linked below.\n\nFor further information regarding these matters, please contact the Enforcement Unit of the Board for Professional Engineers, Land Surveyors, and Geologists at the below address. Please include the subject's name and license number and the case number in your correspondence.\n\nBoard for Professional Engineers, Land Surveyors, and Geologists\n\nEnforcement Unit\n\n2535 Capitol Oaks Drive, Suite 300\n\nSacramento, CA 95833\n\nBPELSG.Enforcement.Information@dca.ca.gov\n\nA | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z\n\nAbeid, John\n\nGEO 9688\n\nFinal Decision in Case No. 1253-A Effective April 7, 2022\n\nAhn, John\n\nC 50615\n\nFinal Decision in Case No. 919-A Effective April 29, 2011\n\nAlturas, Chris Phillips\n\nC 28903\n\nFinal Decision in Case No. 1151-A Effective November 9, 2021\n\nAvila, Jose J.\n\nC 66706\n\nFinal Decision in Case No. 911-A Effective September 10, 2010\n\nBartholow, Paul Verner\n\nC 40512\n\nFinal Decision in Case No. 858-A Effective September 10, 2010\n\nBarto, Ron\n\nGEO 3356, EG 966, & HG 923\n\nFinal Decision in Case No. CG 2008-27 Effective October 27, 2017\n\nBasuglia, Charles John\n\nL 5396\n\nFinal Decision in Case No. 812-A Effective May 15, 2009\n\nBeizai, Vahid Vic\n\nC 43801\n\nFinal Decision in Case No. 1179-A Effective January 18, 2019\n\nBenenati, Pasquale\n\nPS 81 & CO 145\n\nFinal Decision in Case No. 934-A Effective September 10, 2010\n\nBennett, Scott Stanmore\n\nC 50733 & M 21162\n\nFinal Decision in Case No. 862-A Effective June 10, 2010\n\nBeron, Wallace Mark\n\nC 27697\n\nFinal Decision in Case No. 931-A Effective December 30, 2011\n\nBlake, Jonathan Koesters\n\nL 4368\n\nFinal Decision in Case No. 979-A Effective October 14, 2011\n\nBoonjindasup, A.
