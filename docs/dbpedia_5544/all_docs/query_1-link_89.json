        "text": "On November 29, 2021, my younger brother, Tyler, lost his battle with addiction. I tried for years to get him the help he so desperately needed but if you don’t have a ton of money or a really great insurance plan, there really isn’t much help out there.\n\nFrom 2018 to the beginning of 2020 we’re a few really great years. He was living his best life, sober and full of love. We lost our dad suddenly at the end of 2019 and things went downhill pretty fast after that.\n\nWhen you love someone with an addiction, you live every day mourning the loss of someone who is still physically with you. You spend every day wishing you could save them from their demons.\n\nIf love alone could save them, my little brother would still be here – because man was he loved.\n\nMy brother was my best friend. He trusted me with his deepest, darkest secrets. He loved my kids like they were his own & they in return loved him so fiercely. He was so creative and much like our dad, could fix anything and everything that was broken.\n\nMy brother had his demons but he was still a person. He was still a son, a brother, an uncle and a friend. He still had people who loved him and so desperately wanted to save him. His addiction didn’t make him any less of a person or any less deserving of love and care.\n\nFly high sweet boy. Forever 29..\n\nGrowing up, no one made being a kid more fun than my older brother Joey. He had the best laugh, warmest smile and the most clever way of offending you so badly that all you could really do was laugh your head off. Sometimes I would just look at him and start laughing that my legs would feel like jello. Joey’s drug addiction unforunately won, and all were left with is the memories.\n\nWe miss you so much Joey <3\n\nYou are so much more than this disease. Today I honor your courageous battle and miss you more than words can say. I pray to God to end this epidemic and call on His holy order of angels to help in this fight so no one walks this difficult path. Its different without you but you left so many beautiful memories and a beloved little boy whom I adore. I thank God for you!\n\nWe were supposed to be ride or die, but I never meant it literally. So many rehabs, psych hospitals, jail sentences, churches, therapies … I know you tried but your addiction took you down. Watching our sons and now grandchildren, grow up without you is painful. I always thought that eventually you would get clean. You had so much love to give. I’ll always cherish the good times, and I’m thankful that a part of you lives as your family tree grows. I will always love you.\n\nWe lost my beloved brother Jay this past January 2024 after his adult-life long battle he succumbed to the deadly disease of addiction. My heart is broken for this loss and for the too many others. I am grateful for the resources for recovery for those who are able and will continue to work to end the stigma of addiction so that other families can freely welcome the help for your loved ones suffering from this affliction – Its a Disorder Not a Decision.\n\nOn the morning of July 2, 2024, I went into his room to tell him to get ready because the night before he finally decided he wanted to go to rehab to get better, he never made it there because I found him and he was gone. I will never forget that vision . His father, his younger brother and me miss him so much and love him forevermore. He was very smart, a sweet person and caring. He will never be forgotten. We love you Anthony\n\nOn my birthday January 21, 2016 is a day I’ll never forget. I got the call that my little brother Derek had died as a result of an overdose of Fentanyl. He bought heroin but got Fentanyl instead. I didn’t even know he was using drugs. It was a complete shock to my system. My husband was in the depths of an addiction himself. I was totally lost. I couldn’t believe how this had become our lives. I miss & think of Derek every single day. I pray my ex-husband finds his way. I wish Derek would’ve reached out to me, to anyone. I’d do anything to turn back that clock & still have him here with us. All the things he’s missed along the way. His son who doesn’t have his father. I have kids & I’ve educated them probably more than they wanted me to. I refuse to watch them go this. I’m truly fortunate that they are grown now & haven’t turned to this as a means of a way to deal with issues that come up in life. Society has normalized substances to the point that most people use something these days. If you are reading this & are struggling with substance abuse, please reach out to someone. We would rather you ask for help than to be reading your loved one’s tribute to you as you are reading mine.\n\nIt isn’t fair how life went. I loved you more than you were able to accept. I hope you felt my love and it gave you something positive, on any level. I realize how dark and lonely things were for you. The friends you lost. The pain you harbored. I also know the happiness, the fun, the loving soul, my Brandon who I was blessed to see the true beauty of before those dark vices took over. Ill always love you and you’ll never be forgotten, at least not by me. Thank you for opening my heart to genuine trust, care, consistency, and love. I’ll never forget and I’ll always be grateful. OXOX\n\nWe miss you and love you Sniffers– many memories we hold dear forever but will always wish we could hold you. Your two children are doing great in the care of your parents as they are amazing people, friends and family — We love you and miss you beyond words and we know you are watching over P & M — and also many others — Your a guardian angel and will always be an angel in our hearts — until we see you again sweet Sniffers love you !!!"
