        "text": "On November 15, 2021, Joshua Matthew Houchins, 36, of Raleigh, NC, was sentenced to ten years in prison on charges of Wire Fraud, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1343, and Possession of a Firearm by a Felon, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 922(g). The defendant was also ordered to serve three years of supervised release and to pay restitution to victims in the total amount of $1,771,382.25. According to court documents and arguments made in court today, Joshua Matthew Houchins, 36, owner of various Raleigh real estate development companies, carried out a Ponzi scheme upon numerous local real estate investors. Houchins also possessed a rifle and several rounds of ammunition after having been convicted of a felony. According to the superseding indictment, between 2014 and 2018, Houchins owned and operated Rossshire Development LLC, Greenstone Ventures LLC, and Modern South Development LLC, and used these entities to carry out a fraud upon his real estate development investors. Specifically, Houchins solicited investment monies by telling victims that their money would be “put to work” on a specific property, and further represented that the investments would be secured by deeds of trust filed with the county register of deeds. In fact, Houchins did not put all of the investor funds to work on the property on which the investor was solicited to invest, and instead, regularly used investor funds on other properties, or on personal expenses. Likewise, the investor promissory notes were not secured by a deed of trust as promised. In some instances, Houchins did not even own the property that was the subject of the investment, and, as such, could not truthfully grant a deed of trust to the investor. The indictment alleges that after Houchins diverted investor money away from the property on which the funds were supposed to be spent, Houchins failed to develop and sell the properties, as he represented he would. Houchins then defaulted on the notes by failing to pay investors their promised returns. The investors were unable to foreclose upon the investment properties because Houchins had not secured the promissory notes with a deed of trust filed, thereby resulting in losses to the investors. Houchins specifically pled guilty to Count Nine, which alleged one instance of the above-described fraud on January 6, 2017. As a part of the plea, Houchins agreed to make restitution to all victims for losses arising from the scheme and related schemes. G. Norman Acker, III, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina made the announcement. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the North Carolina Secretary of State investigated the case. The Wake County Sheriff’s Office, Apex Police Department, and Sanford Police Department also provided assistance. Assistant U.S. Attorney William M. Gilmore served as the prosecutor. See this press release.\n\nOn July 29, 2021, the North Carolina Department of the Secretary of State, Securities Division entered into a Final Consent Order (\"Order\") with Tannin Capital, LLC. The Order states that Tannin Capital was ineligible for an exemption from state registration as an investment adviser from October 2019 through on or about April 2020. Pursuant to the Order, Tannin Capital agreed to immediately cease and desist from violating any provision of the North Carolina Investment Advisers Act and any related administrative rules, to pay a civil penalty and reimbursement of the costs of investigation. The North Carolina Department of the Secretary of State thanks the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Atlanta Regional Office for their assistance in this matter.

The Order states that Carlson violated North Carolina law during the last two years by transacting business in North Carolina as an investment adviser representative without a valid registration pursuant to the North Carolina Investment Advisers Act. Pursuant to the Order, Carlson agreed to immediately cease and desist from violating any provisions of the North Carolina Investment Advisers Act and any related administrative rules, to pay a civil penalty, and cost of investigation.

According to court documents, Anthony Wayne March, 49 years old, operated the non-profit 501(c)(3) entity Asset Trader, located in Rolesville, NC, between 2012 to 2015. March represented that Asset Trader offered educational services to professionals and taxpayers in the area of exit planning. Asset Trader’s stated educational mission allowed it to obtain classification as a 28 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3) tax-exempt non-profit organization. Asset Trader used its §501(c)(3) tax-exempt status to solicit tax-deductible donations in exchange for charitable gift annuities (“CGAs”) and to recruit referral sources to obtain assets from potential donors. Through Asset Trader, March and his co-conspirators engaged in and executed what is commonly known as a “Ponzi” scheme to defraud investors by inducing them to invest with Asset Trader. During the course of the scheme, March solicited at least 22 victims to invest over $8,100,000 in charitable gift annuities and other products offered by Asset Trader. March and Asset Trader sold these securities to victims as retirement or exit planning vehicles classified as donations to March’s § 501(c)(3) tax-exempt non-profit organization. March did not utilize any of the victim’s money for charitable purposes; rather, he spent the money on \"Ponzi\" payments, his own lavish lifestyle, and expenses of the scheme. G. Norman Acker, III, Acting U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina, made the announcement after sentencing by Chief U.S. District Judge Richard E. Myers II. The Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division (IRS-CI), and the North Carolina Secretary of State, Securities Division conducted the investigation in this matter. The Office of the U.S. Bankruptcy Administrator for the Eastern District of North Carolina provided substantial assistance.

The case showed that defendant Charles Gilbert Murphy was subject to collection efforts by the United States Government arising from a prior federal conviction for Wire Fraud in June of 1999 in this same district. To avoid his payment obligations Murphy used his family members to open bank accounts for him in the name of various companies he controlled, referred to in the Indictment as the “Murphy Entities.” Murphy used the Murphy Entities to obtain money from individuals and entities under false and fraudulent pretenses. Murphy defrauded dozens of victims in this case. Many of the victims lost down payments they paid to Murphy, trusting that he would deliver on his promises. Unfortunately, others lost their life savings. At sentencing the Government sought and obtained an order of restitution on behalf of these victims, totaling $909,763.28. The investigation of this case was conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation, and the North Carolina Department of the Secretary of State, Securities Division. Assistant United States Attorney William M. Gilmore represents the United States.

The charges were announced in federal court (see press release) today during an initial appearance. According to the first section of the superseding indictment, Houchins operated a number of real estate development companies in Raleigh between 2014 and 2018, including Rossshire Development LLC, Greenstone Ventures LLC, and Modern South Development LLC. The indictment charges that Houchins used these entities to carry out a fraud upon his real estate development investors. According to the second part of the superseding indictment, the grand jury began to investigate Houchins in 2018 concerning the aforementioned offenses. Following the issuance of subpoenas to his attorney and to his various real estate companies, Houchins only produced a small number of documents to the grand jury. Instead, the indictment alleges that Houchins admitted in a February 2020 letter that he had “destroyed all of the evidence.” The superseding indictment also alleges that Houchins, who had recently separated from his wife, began to send her harassing messages. The indictment alleges that Houchins’ wife obtained a Domestic Violence Protection Order (DVPO) barring Houchins from contacting, threatening or harassing his wife. While Houchins was already prohibited from possessing a firearm due to his status as a convicted felon, the DVPO further prohibited Houchins from possessing a firearm. The superseding indictment then alleges that in March of 2020, Houchins communicated to friends of his wife that she had “run to the police” and that Houchins has “no mercy on a lying rat.” Around one month later, the superseding indictment alleges that Houchins sent threatening communications to friends and family of his wife, including photographs of Houchins wearing a mask and tactical vest. The superseding indictment then charges that, following his internet searches for “killing your wife over love,” Houchins was arrested. At the time of his arrest, Houchins was in possession of a Ruger AR-15, 4 magazines, a double canister magazine containing 100 rounds of ammunition, two boxes of .223-caliber ammunition, and a tactical vest. Houchins is charged with nine counts of Wire Fraud, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1343, each of which carry a punishment of up to 20 years in prison. Houchins is charged with three counts of Conducting Monetary Transactions in Criminally Derived Property, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1957, each of which carry a punishment of up to 10 years in prison. Count 13 of the Superseding Indictment charges Obstruction of Justice, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1512(c)(1), which carries a maximum punishment of up to 20 years in prison. Lastly, Houchins is charged with Felon in Possession of a Firearm, and Possession of Firearm by Person Subject with a DVPO, in violation of Title 18, United States Code, Sections 922(g)(1) and (g)(8). Both of these offenses carry a maximum punishment of up to 10 years in prison. Robert J. Higdon, Jr., U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina made the announcement. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the North Carolina Secretary of State are investigating the case. The Wake County Sheriff’s Office, Apex Police Department, and Sanford Police Department, also provided assistance. Assistant U.S. Attorney William M. Gilmore is prosecuting the case. An indictment is merely an accusation. The defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty. For additional information, please see the entry at May 26, 2020, below.\n\nOn August 13, 2020, Mark Colin Ramsey, 50, of Graham, N.C., was sentenced to 65 months in prison for operating a $1.1 million investment scheme. U.S. District Judge Martin Reidinger also ordered Ramsey to serve three years of supervised release and to pay restitution in the amount of $1,098,333.92. North Carolina Secretary of State Elaine F. Marshall joins U.S. Attorney Andrew Murray in making this announcement. According to filed court documents and statements made in court, from April 2008 to September 2013, Ramsey defrauded more than 20 victims out of nearly $1.1 million through a fraudulent investment scheme. Court records show that Ramsey operated various purported investment companies, including Hypertrend, Cascade Investments, GH Gardner, Layton-McCall, Pandrox, and Good Living. Ramsey induced victim-investors by falsely representing that their money would be used to make legitimate investments. He also promised his victims that they would receive a guaranteed return on their investments, and that their principal investments would not be at risk. During the relevant time period, Ramsey used multiple purported investment corporations, as well as numerous fraudulent documents, including false Form-1099s, fake investment agreements, and fabricated stock certificates, to convince potential victims his investments were legitimate and profitable. To further induce victims, court records reflect that Ramsey showed potential investors documents purportedly backing up his claim that he had made one million dollars from a ten thousand dollar investment. According to court records, Ramsey failed to disclose to his victims, some of whom were at or near retirement age, that he was not registered to sell securities in the State of North Carolina, or that the investment opportunities he presented were not registered as required by statute. Rather than invest the victims’ money as promised, Ramsey spent the investors’ money on Ponzi-style payments to other investors and to fund his personal lifestyle. On August 26, 2019, Ramsey pleaded guilty to securities fraud. In making today’s announcement, U.S Attorney Murray thanked the Securities Division of the North Carolina Department of the Secretary of State for their investigation of this case. (Press Release.)\n\nOn August 3, 2020, Anthony Wayne March, of Wake Forest, NC, pleaded guilty to wire fraud for his role in an $8.1 million Ponzi scheme (see press release). According to court documents, March, 49 years old, operated the non-profit 501(c)(3) entity Asset Trader, located in Rolesville, NC, between 2012 to 2015. March represented that Asset Trader offered educational services to professionals and taxpayers in the area of exit planning. Asset Trader’s stated educational mission allowed it to obtain classification as a 28 U.S.C. § 501(c)(3) tax-exempt non-profit organization.

Assistant United States Attorney Ethan Ontjes, Special Assistant United States Attorney Brian Behr, and Special Assistant United States Attorney Kevin Harrington represent the United States. On April 5, 2021 (see entry), March was sentenced to 135 months for wire fraud (see press release). For additional information, see the entry at November 21, 2019 below.\n\nOn June 11, 2020, Joseph Maurice Deberry, a/k/a Joseph Maurice Dewberry, 56, of Charlotte, appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge David S. Cayer on June 11, 2020, and pleaded guilty to wire fraud, for orchestrating an investment scheme that defrauded victims of hundreds of thousands of dollars, announced Andrew Murray, U.S. Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina. According to admissions Deberry made in plea documents and the June 11th plea hearing, from 2016 through June 2019, Deberry fraudulently obtained hundreds of thousands of dollars from more than a dozen investors. As part of the scheme, Deberry induced victims to invest in entities with which he was affiliated, such as Pinnacle Investment Properties, LLC and Place Capital Group LLC, among others. Deberry typically represented to investors that their money would be used to further projects related to the construction of student housing at certain colleges in the Carolinas and other ventures. As Deberry admitted in court and in related filings, rather than use the victims’ money as he had represented, Deberry used a significant portion of their funds to pay for personal expenses like rent, entertainment and travel. Further, Deberry actively concealed from his victims the fact that he was under a Cease and Desist Order from the North Carolina Secretary of State's Securities Division prohibiting him from offering for sale, soliciting offers to purchase, or selling any securities in North Carolina (see entry at March 6, 2012 below). Deberry concealed this information from victims by, among other things, telling them that his name was Maurice Dewberry. Deberry pleaded guilty to wire fraud. The charge carries a maximum prison sentence of 20 years and a $250,000 fine. A sentencing date for Deberry has not been set. For more information, see this press release.\n\nOn May 26, 2020, a federal grand jury indictment was unsealed revealing that an indictment had been returned against Joshua Matthew Houchins, 36, of Sanford, NC, charging him with nine counts of wire fraud and three counts of money laundering (see press release). According to the indictment, Houchins operated a number of real estate development companies in Raleigh between 2014 and 2018, including Rossshire Development LLC, Greenstone Ventures LLC, and Modern South Development LLC. The indictment charges that Houchins used these entities to carry out a fraud upon his real estate development investors.

The defendant is presumed innocent until proven guilty.\n\nOn April 16, 2020, the North Carolina Department of the Secretary of State, Securities Division entered into a Final Consent Order (\"Order\") with Ferry Capital Management, LLC (\"FCM\") and Paul Edward Ferry. The Order found that Respondents transacted business in North Carolina as an investment adviser and an investment adviser representative without being registered, in violation of the North Carolina Investment Advisers Act (\"Act\"). Pursuant to the Order, FCM and Ferry agreed to immediately cease and desist from violating any provisions of the Act and any related administrative rules; keep FCM's Form ADV updated; hire a third-party compliance auditor; attend the Securities Division's Investment Adviser Best Practices Workshop; and pay both a civil penalty and the cost of investigation.

In addition to prison time, Kramer was ordered to serve three years of supervised release and to pay restitution in the amount of $90,000 and a special assessment of $100.00. A forfeiture money judgment in the amount of $102,000 was also imposed. Kramer pleaded guilty on October 8, 2019. Her case was jointly investigated by the US Postal Inspection Service’s White Collar Crimes Task Force and the North Carolina Department of the Secretary of State Securities Division. According to documents filed with the Court, Kramer met elderly World War II veteran J.V.M. while in line at the K&W Cafeteria at Friendly Center shopping center in Greensboro. After speaking in line with J.V.M., Kramer dined with him. She then began to socialize with the elderly widower regularly eating with him and meeting him on social occasions, J.V.M. owned a residence on Forest Hill Drive in Greensboro, free of any liens or mortgages. He had lived in the house since the 1950s and raised his family there. However, in 2015 J.V.M. began to reach the bottom of his retirement savings. He approached at least one bank and attempted to arrange a reverse mortgage. He then approached his friend Kramer who had told him that she was a wealthy real estate investor. Kramer represented that she could provide J.V.M. with a reverse mortgage and would provide him a life estate that would allow him to live in the Forest Hill Drive property for the rest of his life. J.V.M. agreed and gave Kramer a deed to the property. However, Kramer included the Forest Hill Drive property as part of a group of properties used to induce a loan from B2R Finance. J.V.M. was unaware that B2R Finance gained a first security interest in the Forest Hill Drive property. At the closing of the loan from B2R Finance, Kramer directed that $146,000 of the proceeds be wired to J.V.M.’s bank account representing the money to be from the purported reverse mortgage. Kramer provided J.V.M. with a life estate in the Forest Hill Drive property, but the life estate was subordinate to the first deed of trust. Kramer then induced J.V.M. to part with half of the proceeds of the purported “reverse mortgage.” She induced him to loan $75,000.00 to a corporation she controlled and gave J.V.M. a promissory note due in one year. These funds were converted to Kramer’s use and never repaid to the victim. Instead, Kramer moved to Colorado and broke off all contact with J.V.M. She made no payments to B2R Finance on the loan, and B2R foreclosed. J.V.M. continued to live in the Forest Hill Drive property secure in his belief that he had a life estate in the property. However, the life estate was extinguished when B2R Finance foreclosed, and J.V.M. was evicted. From Colorado, Kramer moved to Wyoming in an attempt to avoid victims of her frauds who were seeking repayment. She ultimately took a job working on an isolated hunting ranch 15 miles outside Wheatland, Wyoming. She lived in housing owned by the ranch and drove a vehicle registered under a corporate name. Despite these attempts to avoid justice, Postal Inspectors from Greensboro, North Carolina, and Laramie, Wyoming, located Kramer, and arrested her at the ranch. The victim died in 2019. At sentencing, his daughter testified that the eviction had a devastating impact on her father. Kramer was taken into custody at the conclusion of the sentencing hearing.

Murtagh, Jr. and Joseph M. Murtagh, Jr. d/b/a The Source. The Order states that The Source and Murtagh violated North Carolina law during at least some of the years they transacted business in North Carolina as an investment adviser and an investment adviser representative without registering pursuant to the North Carolina Investment Advisers Act. Pursuant to the Order, The Source and Murtagh agreed to immediately cease and desist from violating any provisions of the North Carolina Investment Advisers Act or Securities Act and any related administrative rules, to pay a registration fee, to pay a civil penalty, and to pay a sum to the Investor Protection and Education Trust Fund.

He was arrested by the FBI today in Raleigh. The Indictment alleges that Murphy was subject to collection efforts by the United States Government arising from a prior federal conviction for Wire Fraud in June of 1999 in this same district. As such, the Indictment alleges that Murphy caused family members to open bank accounts for him in the name of various companies he controlled, referred to in the Indictment as the “Murphy Entities.” These entities were Toxic Solutions LLC (“Toxic Solutions”), Biological Marine Remediation LLC (“Bio-Remediation”), Bio Marine Remediation LLC (“Bio-Marine”), Bio Separation Systems, LLC (“Bio-Separation”), On-Site Solutions LLC (“On-Site Solutions”), and On-Site Technologies LLC (“On-Site Technologies”). An Indictment is an allegation of a crime. The defendant is presumed under the law to be innocent until proven guilty.

For more information, please see the press release.\n\nOn October 16, 2019, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission announced the filing of a civil enforcement action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada, charging David Gilbert Saffron of Las Vegas, Nevada and Circle Society, Corp., a Nevada corporation, with fraudulent solicitation, misappropriation, and registration violations relating to an $11 million binary options scheme Saffron operated through Circle Society. The complaint was filed on September 30, 2019. The complaint charges that from at least December 2017 to the present, the defendants fraudulently solicited and accepted at least $11 million worth of bitcoin and U.S. dollars from individuals in the United States to trade off-exchange binary options on foreign currencies (“forex”) and cryptocurrency pairs, among other things. According to the complaint, the defendants fraudulently solicited funds from at least fourteen members of the public to participate in a pool operated by Circle Society, an entity Saffron created and used to perpetrate his fraud, by making false claims of Saffron’s trading expertise and guaranteeing rates of return up to 300%.

He was also ordered to serve two years under court supervision after he is released from prison and to pay $2,020,078.26 as restitution to the victims of his fraud (press release). Between 2006 and 2010, McDougal induced over 25 investors to invest more than $2.5 million, by promising that their money would be invested in securities. McDougal created Charlotte-based US Financial Alliance Consultants, LLC (\"Financial Alliance\") in 2005, a company that was never registered as a dealer of securities in North Carolina or elsewhere. McDougal was also not registered to sell securities in North Carolina or in any other state. Victims, many of whom were elderly and invested most, if not all, of their life-savings, were induced to invest with Financial Alliance by McDougal falsely “guaranteeing” fixed rates of return between 6% and 15% annually. Only $580,000 of the victims’ money was invested and McDougal used approximately $450,000 to pay some victims supposed “payouts” from profits made on investments. However, these payments were not based on profits, but came from funds contributed by new investors. McDougal also used approximately $1.19 million of the investors’ funds to support his own lifestyle, including purchasing dinners, jewelry and electronics, and to pay for hotel stays, furniture and other expenses. For additional information, see the entry at July 24, 2014 below.\n\nOn June 12, 2015, David Christopher Mayhew, of Raleigh, NC, was convicted on Conspiracy, Wire Fraud, Mail Fraud, and Money Laundering charges in US District court (press release).

The Enterprise engaged in an extensive pattern of racketeering activities, consisting of investment fraud, mortgage fraud, bank fraud, money laundering, and distribution of illegal drugs. Ninety (90) defendants were charged and have either pleaded guilty or have been convicted following a trial. One remaining defendant is international fugitives. \"Operation Wax House\" is being handled jointly by the Charlotte Division of the FBI, the Criminal Division of the IRS and the Securities Division of the North Carolina Secretary of State. In addition to the four entries below, see the entries at September 3, 2015, February 18, 2015, January 27, 2015, September 23, 2014, October 23, 2013 and July 10, 2013, respectively.\n\nOn May 29, 2015, Toby Hunter, of Fort Mill, SC, was sentenced to 108 months in prison, three years of supervised release, and was ordered to pay $8,095,903.80 in restitution to victims for his role in this scheme (press release). Hunter and his conspirators defrauded more than 50 investors out of millions through a scheme involving obtaining mortgage loans under false pretenses. They converted the money to their own personal use including private jets, high profile offices, entertaining themselves and others, and supporting their luxurious lifestyles. In December 2013, Hunter pleaded guilty to one count of racketeering conspiracy. According to filed court documents and statements made during Hunter’s sentencing hearing, Hunter served the racketeering enterprise as the Chief Investment Officer for Prestige Capital Advisors, one of the entities used to defraud investor-victims. Hunter was a registered commodity trading advisor with the National Futures Association (NFA), and had passed the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) Series 6 and Series 63 exams. Hunter registered Prestige Capital Advisor with the NFA, and used his education, licenses, and supposed experience to help lure investor victims to the scheme, including a victim defrauded of $4 million.\n\nOn May 26, 2015, a US District Court sentenced four defendants for their involvement in mortgage and investment fraud schemes codenamed “Operation Wax House” (press release). These were three of the conspiracy’s leaders. James Tyson, Jr., of Charlotte, NC, was sentenced to 30 years in prison, Carrie Tyson, of Winterville, NC, to 18 years in prison, Victoria Hunt, of Rockville, MD, to 8 years in prison, and Vonetta Tyson Barnes, of Mililani, HI, to 30 days in prison. Each defendant was also sentenced to serve a term of three years supervised release. Tyson, Jr., his mother, Carrie Tyson, and Victoria Hunt are three of the leaders of the Racketeering Influenced Corrupt Organization (RICO) (the “Enterprise”) which operated in Mecklenburg and Union Counties from approximately 2005 until the defendants were arrested in 2012. A fourth leader, Ramin Amini, remains a fugitive. The Enterprise was responsible for a mortgage fraud and an investment fraud scheme that collectively defrauded victims of more than $75 million.\n\nOn June 26, 2014, a federal jury convicted Steven Jones, of Waxhaw, NC, in connection with his involvement in the $75 million racketeering conspiracy codenamed “Operation Wax House” (press release). According to trial evidence, Jones was a promoter in the enterprise’s investment fraud operations, bringing in multiple investors, including an attorney, who Jones and his co-conspirators defrauded out of $3.7 million. Trial evidence established that throughout a seven year period the enterprise created a series of sham corporations to convince individuals to invest money. When investors would become aware of the problems with one corporation the enterprise would start a new corporation with new officers on paper to continue to defraud still further investors, court records show. Trial evidence also showed that Jones and others defrauded victims not of just money they had, but also caused the victims to take out expensive loans and to invest those loan proceeds based on false promises. According to evidence presented at trial, Jones and his co-conspirators used the investors’ money for personal expenditures, including private jets, high profile offices, entertaining themselves and others, and supporting their luxurious lifestyles. In total, the enterprise’s investment fraud operations took approximately $48 million from investors.\n\nOn April 24, 2013, a federal superseding indictment unsealed in U.S. District Court charged nine additional defendants in Charlotte and elsewhere with racketeering, investment fraud, mortgage fraud, bank bribery and money laundering (press release). This latest round of criminal charges resulting from Operation Wax House, a mortgage fraud investigation which began in the Western District of North Carolina in 2007, brings the total number of defendants charged to date to 92, of which 66 have pleaded guilty. According to allegations contained in the unsealed indictment, the Enterprise, which operated from about 2005 through 2012, engaged in an extensive pattern of racketeering activities, consisting of investment fraud, mortgage fraud, bank fraud, money laundering and distribution of illegal drugs. Members of the Enterprise also bribed bank officials. In the investment fraud portion of the racketeering activities, the co-conspirators targeted professional athletes and doctors as well as their personal and professional acquaintances and convinced them to invest in a series of sham corporations controlled by the Enterprise. For example, members of the Enterprise told potential investors that one of the sham corporations, PEI, was a commodities trading company that would broker deals for the supposed export-import of various commodities like rice-trading and gold and diamond mining in Africa. In truth and fact, instead of investing the victims’ money as promised, the Enterprise used the funds obtained through PEI to support its members’ lifestyles and to make Ponzi-style payments to other victims. The co-conspirators stole over $27 million from more than 50 investor victims, including monies that the investor victims were induced to obtain as loans from financial institutions. Defendants added in this superseding indictment are:\n\nWilliam Brown, of Matthews, NC;\n\nBenjamin Clarke, of Smyrna, GA;\n\nFrank DeSimone, of Charlotte, NC;\n\nLorie Dooley, of Washington, DC:\n\nJames E. Fink, of Waxhaw, NC:\n\nRalph Johnson, of Charlotte, NC;\n\nDenetria Myles, of Charlotte, NC;\n\nMatthew Newland, of Coralville, IA;\n\nNazeere Saddig, formerly of Charlotte, NC.\n\nOn May 26, 2015, Michael Anthony Jenkins of Raleigh, NC, pleaded guilty on May 26, 2015, to three counts of felony securities fraud and one count of felony obtaining property by false pretenses. Jenkins admitted to running a classic Ponzi scheme through a company called Harbor Light Asset Management, by which he paid off earlier investors with money he received from later investors. He also converted investors’ fund to his own personal use. Jenkins told investors he would use their funds to trade commodities futures or “E-mini futures” through Harbor Light Asset Management. Through false promises of investing in commodities futures, and false monthly updates, Jenkins defrauded victims out of an estimated $1.79 million from January 2011 to 2012. He was never registered with the NC Securities Division to sell securities, or with the National Futures Association to act as a commodities trader. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina entered an Order for a permanent injunction against Harbor Light Asset Management, LLC (HLAM) and Michael Anthony Jenkins. The Order requires HLAM and Jenkins jointly to pay restitution totaling $1,301,406.60 and a civil monetary penalty of $3,904,219.80.
