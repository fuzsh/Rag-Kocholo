        "text": "Career Highlights\n\n• UCLA Athletic Hall of Famer (Class of 2003)\n\n• ASA/USA Softball Hall of Famer (Class of 2013)\n\n• 3-time Olympic Gold Medalist (2004, 2000, 1996)\n\n• 5-time NCAA Champion Assistant Coach (2019, 2010, 2004, 2003, 1999)\n\n• 2-time NCAA Champion Player (1992, 1990)\n\n• 3-time NFCA National Coaching Staff of the Year (2019, 2010, 2004)\n\n• 8-time NFCA Regional Coaching Staff of the Year\n\n• First softball player to win the Honda Broderick Cup (1993)\n\n• 3-time Honda Sport Award winner\n\n• 4-time NFCA First Team All-American\n\n• 3-time Pac-12 Player of the Year\n\nOne of the most recognizable names in the sport of softball, Lisa Fernandez begins her 27th season on the Bruin coaching staff in 2025. Fernandez was promoted to the Mark Kalmansohn UCLA Associate Head Softball Coach on August 10, 2022. Fernandez works closely with the Bruins’ hitters and infielders as well as manages the team’s recruiting efforts.\n\nThis is Fernandez's second stint as a full-time assistant coach for UCLA (1997-99, 2007-present), also serving as a volunteer assistant from 2000-04. In 26 previous seasons with Fernandez on staff, the Bruins have posted a 1,212-259-2 (.822) record and have claimed five NCAA Championships in 1999, 2003, 2004, 2010 and 2019. UCLA has also won seven regular-season Pac-10/12 Conference titles with Fernandez as an assistant: 1999, 2002, 2009, 2019, 2021, 2023 and 2024. With Fernandez on staff, the program has been honored as the NFCA National Coaching Staff of the Year three times in 2004, 2010 and 2019 and NFCA Regional CSOY eight times in 2000, '10, '14, '15, '16, '19, '21 and '24. Arguably the greatest pitcher in softball history, Fernandez has coached nine Bruin hurlers to 21 NFCA All-American awards.\n\nFernandez's primary coaching responsibility from 2019-23 was in the Bruins’ bullpen. UCLA finished top 10 nationally and top two in the Pac-12 in earned run average in all five seasons after Fernandez took over the role. Under her tutelage, Rachel Garcia won two Honda Broderick Cups, three Honda Sport Awards, one NFCA National Player of the Year, one NFCA Pitcher of the Year, two Pac-12 Player of the Years, one Pac-12 Pitcher of the year and two of her three NFCA First Team All-American honors. Megan Faraimo won three NFCA All-American awards (two First Team) and was honored as the program's first back-to-back Pac-12 Pitcher of the Year in 2022 and 2023 with the help of Fernandez.\n\nUCLA’s 2023 pitching staff was headlined by Faraimo and left-handed transfer pitcher Brooke Yanez who led the Bruins to a 52-7 record with a team earned run average of 1.69, good for second in the Pac-12 and eighth in the country. Faraimo pieced together her second 20-win campaign in as many seasons with a record of 29-3 and 1.42 ERA. She led the Pac-12 with 232 strikeouts in 172.0 innings pitched. Faraimo finished her career in Westwood ranked third in program history in both wins (101) and strikeouts (1,000). Faraimo pitched two no-hitters in her final season, including her first versus a ranked opponent in then-No. 3 Florida, to bring her career total to seven no-hitters. Both Yanez and Faraimo were named NFCA West All-Region and All-Pac-12.\n\nIn 2022, UCLA's pitching staff was once again the story of the team, leading the conference in every statistical category (1.73 ERA, 292 strikeouts and 21 shutouts). Faraimo and Holly Azevedo dazzled with a combined 45-8 record to become the Bruins' first pitching duo to each record 20-plus wins in a season in 20 years. Faraimo went on to secure Pac-12 Pitcher of the Year honors while Azevedo was named to the All-Pac-12 First Team. The Bruins' tossed five no-hitters, ranking second nationally, for the program's most since 2002. Three of those no-no's were perfect games, all coming within eight days of each other in March.\n\nIn June 2019, Garcia put on a performance for the ages in the circle to bring home the Bruins' 12th NCAA title. Garcia started and was the winning pitcher in all five games at the Women's College World Series. Garcia tossed a complete game in four of those contests, including a 10-inning shutout with 16 strikeouts versus Washington which she walked off with a three-run homer to give herself the win. In total, Garcia threw 36 of the Bruins' 38 innings in Oklahoma City.\n\nIn November 2013, Fernandez was inducted into the ASA/USA Softball National Hall of Fame, joining Sharron Backus, Gina Vecchione, Sheila Cornell, Dot Richardson and Sue Enquist. A decade prior, she was inducted into the UCLA Athletic Hall of Fame in 2003.\n\nFernandez is a three-time Olympic Gold Medalist, having helped Team USA to victories in the 1996, 2000 and 2004 Olympic Games. In 1996, Fernandez shined in the United States' 3-1 gold-medal victory over China, recording the final three outs to earn a save. She went 1-1 with a 0.33 ERA in softball's inaugural appearance in the Olympics in Atlanta.\n\nIn the 2000 Sydney Games, Fernandez pitched the U.S. to victory in both the semifinal win over Australia and the gold-medal game against Japan. She established an Olympic single-game strikeout record with 25 in a round-robin game against Australia and posted a 0.47 earned run average and 52 strikeouts. In 2004, Fernandez was Team USA's top hitter and pitcher, posting a .545 batting average (12-for-22), which set a new record for an Olympic tournament. For the third-consecutive Games, she was also in the circle for the final out of the gold-medal contest, a 5-1 victory over Australia. Fernandez was selected as an alternate to the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.\n\nIn 1999, Fernandez was named the ASA/USA Softball Female Athlete of the Year. As a pitcher and third baseman, she helped the USA Softball Women's National Team to gold medals at both the Pan American Games and the Canada Cup. She also helped the California Commotion win the ASA Women's Major Fast Pitch championship for the fourth consecutive time.\n\nFernandez played at UCLA from 1990-93 and completed her psychology degree in 1995. A three-time winner of the sport's Honda Award, Fernandez became the first softball player to win the prestigious Honda Broderick Cup in 1993, given to the most outstanding collegiate female athlete in all sports. A four-time, First Team All-American, Fernandez led the Bruins to two national championships (1990 and 1992) and two runner-up finishes (1991 and 1993). She was also All-Region and All-Pac-10 First Team each season and Pac-10 Player of the Year her final three years.\n\nWith a minuscule 0.22 earned run average, Fernandez went 93-7 with 784 strikeouts. Her ERA ranks second in NCAA history and her 74 shutouts are tops at UCLA and tied for ninth in the NCAA annals. In her junior and senior seasons, Fernandez had the lowest ERA in the nation (0.14 in 1992, 0.25 in 1993), sporting a perfect 29-0 mark in '92. She tossed 11 career no-hitters, including a pair in the 1993 Women's College World Series, along with two perfect games. She ranks second in UCLA history in ERA, seventh in wins and eighth strikeouts.\n\nFernandez was just as powerful at the plate, batting .382 with 15 home runs and 128 runs batted in. She hit .401 in her junior season, but eclipsed that mark by more than 100 points in her senior campaign, batting an NCAA-best .510 with 11 homers and 45 RBI. Fernandez ranks in the UCLA Top 10 in numerous offensive categories, including sixth in hits.\n\nFernandez and Mike Lujan, who were married in August 2002, have two sons, Antonio (19) and Cruz (12), and reside in Long Beach."
