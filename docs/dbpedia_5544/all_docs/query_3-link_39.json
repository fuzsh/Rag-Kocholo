        "text": "This will be Jeremy Morinâ€™s 2nd season working with the Gamblers under Gamblers Head Coach & General Manager Mike Leone. From 2010-2015, Morin appeared in 82 NHL games with the Chicago Blackhawks and Columbus Blue Jackets, collecting 10 goals and 12 assists. The Auburn, New York native also appeared in 333 American Hockey League games, scoring 113 goals.\n\nMorin is a product of the U.S. National Program (2007-2009). Internationally, Morin won gold for the United States at the 2009 U18 World Championships and 2010 World Junior Championships and bronze at the 2008 U18 World Championships and 2015 World Championships.\n\nThe Green Bay Gamblers have hired Green Bay native Chris Nell to serve as the teamâ€™s Goalie Coordinator and Assistant Coach. Nell will work with the Gambler goaltenders, including 2023 Chicago Blackhawks 2nd round pick Adam Gajan.\n\nAfter a successful playing career, Nell began his coaching career last year, splitting time between Marian University and local Notre Dame Academy.\n\nAfter a stellar playing career at Notre Dame Academy, Nell played two years in the USHL for the Chicago Steel (2012-14), before moving onto Bowling Green State University (2014-17). Nell signed with the New York Rangers in the spring of 2017, appearing in a handful of games for the Rangers American Hockey League affiliate, Hartford Wolf Pack, over the next three seasons. Nell spent most of his professional career in the ECHL, appearing in 110 games from 2017-2022.\n\nAdrienne joined the Green Bay Gamblers ahead of the 2023-2024 season as the Head Athletic Trainer. She joined the Gamblers after spending the 2022-2023 season with the Madison Capitols (USHL) team serving as their Athletic Training Student. She graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point (UWSP) with a BS in Pre-Athletic Training (2021) and an MS in Athletic Training (2023).\n\nDuring her time as an MS-Athletic Training Student, she assisted with event coverage to a variety of levels including youth-adult sports, high school sports, and collegiate-level sports including UWSP Menâ€™s Ice Hockey. A native of Appleton, WI, Adrienne is a licensed Athletic Trainer in Wisconsin and provides her services through Aurora BayCare Medical Center.\n\nHead Coach Mike Leone returns for his 2nd season behind the Gamblers bench. In his first year, Leone led the Gamblers resurgence, as the team accomplished the following: Nine (9) more regular season wins than the previous year (2021-22), 20 more regular season points than the previous year (2021-22), Most points (71) since the 2016-2017 season, Most wins (32) since the 2016-2017 season, and First playoff home game since 2018.\n\nLeone brings previous experience coaching at the junior, collegiate and professional levels as he was an assistant at NTDP U17 (2019-2022), Bowling Green State University (2018-19) as well as with the ECHLâ€™s Quad City Mallards (2017-18). Additionally, Leone served as an assistant coach at the IIHF Under-18 Menâ€™s World Championship.\n\nThe Dearborn, Michigan native skated three seasons at Western Michigan University before embarking on a four-year professional career that took him through the ECHLâ€™s Kalamazoo Wings and Toledo Walleye, in addition to one season with Villard-de-Lans in France.\n\nThe Green Bay Gamblers have named Mason Baptista as the teamâ€™s new assistant coach. Baptistaâ€™s focus will be skill development and special teams.\n\nPrior to being hired by the Gamblers, Baptista was an assistant coach in the ECHL with the Greenville Swamp Rabbits, an affiliate of the NHLâ€™s Los Angeles Kings. The North York, Ontario Canada native joined the Swamp Rabbits ahead of the 2022-23 season after a stint as the Video and Skills Coach for the Chinese Womenâ€™s National Team which competed at the 2022 Winter Olympic Games in Beijing, China.\n\nAs a player, Baptista played six seasons professionally in the ECHL and Southern Professional Hockey League (SPHL). Throughout his ECHL career, Baptista appeared in 297 career games and posted 187 points (79g, 108a) between five different teams.\n\nCollegiately, Baptista starred at local St. Norbert College, winning a pair of NCAA Division III national championships in 2012 and 2014 with the Green Knights. In his four years with the Green Knights, Baptista collected 104 points (29 goals & 75 assists) in 117 games. Baptista was a teammate of Gamblers Associate Head Coach Pat McCadden at St. Norbert.\n\nThe Green Bay Gamblers have promoted Pat McCadden to Associate Head Coach. McCadden was hired as an assistant coach on Mike Leoneâ€™s staff prior to the 2022-23 season.\n\nPrior to his time with the Gamblers, McCadden spent five seasons with Lawrence University where he served as the associate head hockey coach.\n\nMcCadden played three seasons in the professional ranks between the SPHL and the ECHL. He finished his professional career with the Atlanta Gladiators of the ECHL. During his collegiate years he spent two seasons for the St. Norbert Green Knights where he was part of the 2014 National Championship team. Before St. Norbert, he spent two years playing for the Michigan Tech Huskies.\n\nMcCadden played three years of junior hockey. He won the Robertson Cup in 2008 with the St. Louis Bandits and then made the move with former Gamblerâ€™s coach Jon Cooper to Green Bay in 2008. Under Cooper, he served as team captain when the Gamblers won the Clark Cup in 2010."
