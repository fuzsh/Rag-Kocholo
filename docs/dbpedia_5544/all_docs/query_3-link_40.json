        "text": "Dear Neighbor,\n\nIt is an honor to serve the people of House District 29, which includes a portion of Hamilton County.\n\nI hope this site serves as a valuable resource for information on our district, and issues I am working on while assisting you in navigating state government.\n\nI always appreciate your input, so please do not hesitate to contact to me with any questions or concerns you may have. I look forward to hearing from you as we work together on important issues impacting Indiana and our community. Thank you for the opportunity to serve you and your family.\n\nSincerely,\n\nChuck Goodrich\n\nState Representative\n\nHouse District 29\n\nIndiana House of Representatives: 2018 - Present\n\nHouse District 29: Portion of Hamilton County\n\nCommittees:\n\nWays and Means (Chair of K-12 Subcommittee)\n\nEducation\n\nEmployment, Labor and Pensions\n\nTelephone:\n\n(317) 232-9651 Direct Line\n\n(800) 382-9841 Toll Free\n\nAddress:\n\n200 W.

Chuck Goodrich of Noblesville was first elected to serve the constituents of House District 29 in 2018. During his first year in office, Goodrich authored a bill that created the senior-youth mentor pilot program, which aims to provide struggling students with a role model at school. This legislation passed the House and Senate with bipartisan support.\n\nHe also co-sponsored a new law that aimed to meet the changing needs of Indianaâ€™s employers by reallocating existing state funds to proven workforce programs so Hoosiers can increase their certifications, earn stackable credentials and secure higher-paying jobs in high-demand fields.\n\nOutside of the legislature, Goodrich serves as the president and CEO of Gaylor Electric, Inc. The electrical design-build contractor employs more than 1,300 men and women throughout 11 offices in five states across the county, including seven Indiana locations. During his tenure, Gaylor Electric created more than 700 jobs.\n\nHe also helped open the Gaylor Electric Crossing School of Business and Entrepreneurship Satellite Campus, an alternative, state-accredited high school for at-risk students at the Gaylor Noblesville hub. He actively works with the Hamilton County Workforce Innovation Network and is a member of the Indiana Department of Workforce Development's Region 5 Workforce Development Board.\n\nGoodrich lives in Noblesville with his wife of 25 years, Tricia, and their four children. The family is active in the community and as members of the White River Christian Church. He enjoys spending quality time with his wife and kids, playing golf, and rooting for the Indianapolis Colts and Purdue Boilermakers."
