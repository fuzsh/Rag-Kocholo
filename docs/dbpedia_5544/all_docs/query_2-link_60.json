        "text": "Document: Read the indictment\n\nPhoto gallery: Criminal indictment in Colonies case\n\nA nearly three-year corruption probe into San Bernardino County’s landmark $102 million settlement with Rancho Cucamonga developer Colonies Partners LP culminated Tuesday with an indictment against a developer, a former county supervisor and two others linked to the settlement.\n\nColonies co-managing partner Jeff Burum, former Assistant Assessor Jim Erwin, and Mark Kirk, the former chief of staff for county Supervisor Gary Ovitt, surrendered to authorities at 7 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nThey were arrested outside the District Attorney’s Office in San Bernardino and booked into Central Detention Center in San Bernardino.\n\nBurum was being held in lieu of $10 million bail, and Erwin and Kirk were each being held in lieu of $2 million bail, District Attorney Michael A. Ramos said during a news conference at the District Attorney’s Office.\n\nKirk, who works for the county administrative officer in intergovernmental relations, was placed on unpaid leave upon his arrest Tuesday.\n\nFormer county Supervisor Paul Biane, who was arrested about 5 p.m. Tuesday after stepping off a plane in Ontario, was booked into West Valley Detention Center in Rancho Cucamonga, where he was being held in lieu of $2 million bail.\n\nHe did not surrender to authorities, as he had agreed to Monday night, and a warrant was issued for his arrest Tuesday morning, said Susan Mickey, spokeswoman for the District Attorney’s Office. A wanted flier including Biane’s photograph and a list of his alleged offenses was posted inside the San Bernardino courthouse.\n\nBiane, reached by telephone Tuesday afternoon, said authorities had been notified of his whereabouts: Willcox, Ariz., a farming community east of Tucson and about 40 miles west of the New Mexico border.\n\nHe said he had driven there Monday to consult on a farming project.\n\n“I’m not a fugitive, and the D.A. knows where I’m at,” said Biane, calling from Las Vegas while in between flights from Arizona to L.A./Ontario International Airport.\n\nHe said he immediately arranged for a flight back to California once he learned a warrant had been issued for his arrest.\n\nHe said his failure to appear was caused by a misunderstanding.\n\n“We were given a heads-up it (indictment) would be late this week or next week,” Biane said.\n\nBut Mickey said Biane and the other defendants were told several weeks ago not to leave the area.\n\nThe indictment\n\nIn a 29-count indictment, Biane, Burum, Kirk and Erwin were charged with conspiracy to commit a crime, bribery, conflict of interest, tax fraud, tax evasion, perjury and forgery, among other charges.\n\nRamos said Burum concocted a scheme to corrupt public officials through extortion, threats, inducement, and bribery to secure the\n\n$102 million settlement, in Colonies Partners’ favor, on Nov. 28, 2006. The settlement ended nearly five years of heated legal battle over flood-control easements at the developer’s Colonies Crossroads residential and commercial development in Upland.\n\nProsecutors allege Burum offered Biane, Kirk, Erwin and former Board of Supervisors Chairman Bill Postmus each $100,000 bribes in exchange for voting for a settlement in the developer’s favor or influencing it.\n\nColonies cut three $100,000 checks and two $50,000 checks to five political action committees prosecutors believe were secretly controlled by the supervisors who voted for the settlement or members of their staff in order to conceal the bribes, prosecutors allege.\n\nProsecutors cite 43 overt acts in the indictment to back their allegations.\n\n“I will tell you, this is a historical day because this is one of the biggest – the biggest – corruption case the District Attorney’s Office of San Bernardino County has prosecuted, as a team with the (state) Attorney General’s Office,” Ramos said.\n\nIndictment alleges gifts, threats\n\nThe allegations of overt acts include, among other things, that Burum provided meals and entertainment to Postmus during a trade mission in China in 2005, and upon return from the trip, promised to take care of Postmus for the rest of his political and business career if he would support a settlement of the Colonies lawsuit.\n\nWhen Postmus returned from the trip, he went to then-County Administrative Officer Mark Uffer and said, “We’ve got to settle this Colonies thing,” according to the indictment.\n\nBurum sued the county in March 2002, alleging the county was illegally channeling floodwater onto his Upland property and refused to pay for flood-control improvements. A nearly 5-year legal battle ensued before the landmark settlement on Nov. 28, 2006.\n\nIn 2006, voters approved Measure P, a ballot measure introduced by Biane that would raise the annual salaries for county supervisors from $99,000 to $152,000. Burum, according to the indictment, conducted a campaign against the measure as a means to obtains influence over Biane in order to obtain a settlement.\n\nIn January 2006, Erwin, who was allegedly acting as an agent for Burum, created political mailers in opposition to Measure P that asserted Biane had excessive indebtedness and was unable to pay his bills. In the same time period, while Postmus was running for county assessor but still serving on the Board of Supervisors, Erwin created political mailers depicting Postmus’ addiction to drugs, which were a means to get Postmus to convince Biane to vote in favor of the settlement, according to the indictment.\n\nPostmus has admitted to a long battle with methamphetamine addiction, and has been previously charged with possession of the drug and being under its influence during a court appearance.\n\nProsecutors also say that lengthy telephone calls occurred between Kirk and Burum in the days before and after Kirk established the political action committee Alliance for Ethical Government in March 2007. A $100,000 check from Colonies was deposited into the committee’s account in May 2007, according to the indictment.\n\nDefendants maintain innocence\n\nBurum has steadfastly denied the allegations.\n\n“Jeff Burum has been smeared by innuendos for two years,” said Burum’s attorney, John Vandevelde, in a statement Tuesday. “Today’s indictment means Jeff will finally have his day in court, where the truth will show there was never a bribe of anyone or illegal conduct of any kind.\n\n“The county abused the property rights that Jeff, his partners and all citizens are guaranteed. This criminal case is one more effort to force Jeff to submit to the power of the government; but Jeff will fight these charges and he will win.”\n\nBiane has also maintained his innocence since the allegations first surfaced last February, when he and the other defendants were identified in a criminal complaint against Erwin and Postmus as unindicted and uncharged co-conspirators.\n\n“The basic concept that I was bribed in any way, shape or form to reach my decision with the Colonies isn’t true,” Biane said.\n\nHe said he plans to fight the charges to the very end.\n\nErwin’s attorney, Rajan Maline, described the newest set of charges against his client as “re-packaged,” saying it was based essentially on the same set of evidence.\n\n“There’s nothing new in this,” Maline said by telephone. “There’s two additional counts. There’s nothing different, absolutely nothing.”\n\nThe disturbing part, Maline said, was that Erwin had been re-arrested and forced to post bail for the third time on basically the same set of charges.\n\nThe first time Erwin was arrested, his bail was set at $220,000 and then $380,000 the second time. Now, his bail was set at $2 million. Erwin has not missed any court appearances, and a Superior Court judge recently had released him on his own recognizance and had the bonds exonerated, Maline said.\n\nKirk’s attorney, Paul Grech, said he expects Kirk’s bail – now set at $2 million – will be lowered at a bail hearing today. He said Kirk should be released without bail.\n\n“I expect when we go to a bail hearing, a judge will reduce the bail,” Grech said. “He’s charged with eight low-grade felonies. He has no prior record … Bail is to secure the presence of the accused at trial. It’s not supposed to be a punishment.”\n\nGrech said he didn’t know anything about the phone calls allegedly placed between Burum and Kirk.\n\n“I don’t know anything about them,” Grech said. “From the indictment, it doesn’t indicate the prosecution knows anything about the phone calls either.”\n\nPostmus’ plea bargain\n\nOn March 28, Postmus, who is also the former county assessor, pleaded guilty to 14 felony counts, including conspiracy to commit a crime, conflict of interest and accepting a bribe in connection with the Colonies case. He, along with Biane and Supervisor Gary Ovitt, voted in favor of the settlement. Supervisors Josie Gonzales and Dennis Hansberger dissented.\n\nUnder a plea bargain with prosecutors, Postmus has agreed to turn state’s evidence in exchange for reduced charges.\n\n“He (Postmus) corroborated what we already knew,” Ramos said.\n\nA special criminal Grand Jury was convened after Postmus’ conviction, and subpoenas went out to 45 witnesses who testified in the weeks thereafter. Burum, Kirk, Erwin and Biane all received letters, called Johnson Letters, from prosecutors saying they were the targets of the Grand Jury inquiry and could present any exculpatory evidence they felt would be beneficial to their defense.\n\n“We decided to go down this Grand Jury path prior to Bill Postmus ever pleading guilty, and we would have been here today even without Bill Postmus,” Ramos said. “However, with his cooperation, it has only strengthened our case as we move forward into a court of law.”\n\nPostmus corroborated evidence supplied to prosecutors by former Assistant Assessor Adam Aleman, who pleaded no contest on June 30, 2009, to four felonies. Under a plea bargain with prosecutors, Aleman’s testimony ignited what would become the county’s biggest corruption scandal. He’s cooperating with authorities in exchange for reduced charges.\n\nAleman was convicted of destroying a county-owned laptop computer believed to have contained incriminating evidence against Postmus, and having minutes from executive meetings at the Assessor’s Office falsified for the Grand Jury.\n\nIf convicted, Burum, 48, faces a maximum sentence of 6 years, 8 months in prison. Biane, 47, faces 8 years in prison. Kirk, 36, is facing a maximum sentence of 8 years, 8 months in prison and Erwin, 48, faces up to 14 years, 8 months in prison.\n\nAn arraignment for Burum, Kirk and Erwin is scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Thursday in San Bernardino Superior Court, according to sheriff’s booking records.\n\nBiane’s arraignment date was pending Tuesday.\n\nCounty reacts\n\nSupervisor Gary Ovitt would not answer any questions about Kirk on Tuesday, and has maintained that his vote approving the Colonies settlement was based on his careful weighing of the evidence presented by attorneys and in the courts.\n\nHe released a prepared statement in support of his former chief of staff.\n\n“I am saddened about what has occurred today involving Mark Kirk,” he said in the statement. “I have known Mark for eight years, I’ve worked with him during that period of time. He is a person of great intelligence and integrity. Although I don’t know the specifics of the charges, and can’t comment on the particulars, I know Mark to be a consummate professional, loving father and family man, and all-around good person of high morals and character.”\n\nBoard of Supervisors Chairwoman Josie Gonzales also issued a prepared statement, saying “I am determined to continue moving forward in a positive manner. The actions of a few cannot define who we are as a whole. Employees here at the county and the general public deserve the highest and best level of leadership we can provide. We must be steadfast in our convictions to lead reform.”\n\nAt Tuesday’s news conference, Ramos said the investigation is still ongoing, and it’s unclear where it will head.\n\n“These individuals have violated the trust of the citizens of this county, and we are going to put an end to corruption in San Bernardino County,” Ramos said.\n\nHe said he will be seeking a court order for restitution for the $102 million he said was robbed from county taxpayers.\n\nSenior Assistant Attorney General Gary Schons called Tuesday’s developments a “signal event” in the corruption investigation.\n\n“There is a lot more work ahead,” Schons said. “We won’t rest until we follow all the evidence to where it leads.”\n\nStaff writers James Rufus Koren, Liset Marquez, Sandra Emerson and Wendy Leung contributed to this report.\n\nCOLONIES THROUGH THE YEARS\n\n1930s\n\nSan Bernardino County acquires easements on San Antonio Water Co. property in Upland, allowing the county to use a portion of the land for flood control.\n\n1997\n\nThe Colonies developers, then called the San Antonio Lakes Partners, purchase more than 400 acres of the San Antonio Water Co. property for $16 million with plans to build a major commercial-residential development.\n\n1999\n\nThe Colonies developers, along with the county, city of Upland, San Bernardino Associated Governments and Caltrans, agree to work together on a regional flood-control project to accommodate runoff from the mountains and the impending 210 Freeway extension.\n\n2002\n\nThe Colonies sues San Bernardino County after the county rejects the Colonies’ request for $25 million to pay for flood-control facilities on its property.\n\nThe 20th Street storm drain is completed, redirecting runoff to the Colonies property, where new flood-control facilities have not yet been built.\n\n2003\n\nSuperior Court Judge Peter H. Norell rules against the county in the Colonies lawsuit. The county appeals the decision.\n\nThe county attempts to halt construction on the Colonies project, but a judge allows work on the flood-control basin to continue, finding that a lack of appropriate facilities is a threat to public safety.\n\nCaltrans pays the Colonies nearly $18 million for taking 38 acres of land for development of the 210 Freeway extension.\n\n2004\n\nColonies files a new complaint against the county, seeking construction costs, reimbursement for land and other damages.\n\nThe county sues Upland, Caltrans and San Bernardino Associated Governments, arguing they are also responsible for the cost of the basin.\n\n2005\n\nAn appellate court panel reverses Norell’s ruling on the Colonies’ first lawsuit, finding that the county’s easements remain valid. The case is sent back to trial court to determine the extent of the easements.\n\nIn a confidential memo to the Board of Supervisors, the county’s attorneys protest a $77 million tentative settlement with Colonies, arguing the settlement is unwarranted and may compromise the county’s ability to seek restitution from Upland, Caltrans and SanBAG. The tentative settlement, which included cash and land in Rancho Cucamonga, was negotiated by Supervisors Bill Postmus and Paul Biane without lawyers present. Supervisors table the agreement and call for an investigation into who leaked the memo.\n\n2006\n\nJuly 31: Superior Court Judge Christopher Warner rules that while the county’s easements may be valid, they do not cover recent flood-control improvements. Both sides go back and forth over settlement talks, with the Colonies threatening to ask a jury for as much as $301 million if no settlement is reached.\n\nNov. 7: Postmus is elected county assessor, though he will not take office until January 2007.\n\nNov. 28: The Board of Supervisors approves a $102 million settlement with Colonies. Supervisors Postmus, Biane, and Gary Ovitt vote to approve a $102 million settlement with Colonies, with Supervisors Josie Gonzales and Dennis Hansberger dissenting.\n\n2007\n\nJanuary: Postmus assumes office as county assessor. He hires Jim Erwin, former president of the county’s Safety Employees Benefit Association, as assistant assessor.\n\nNov. 6: Erwin quits his job in the Assessor’s Office and is awarded six months’ severance pay.\n\n2008\n\nApril 10: District Attorney’s Office investigators raid Postmus’ office, confiscating computers of top Assessor’s Office staffers. Investigators say they are looking in to hiring practices and whether political operations have been run out of the Assessor’s Office.\n\nApril 17: Postmus places Assistant Assessor Adam Aleman on administrative leave.\n\nJune 19: San Bernardino City Councilman Neil Derry wins a seat on the county Board of Supervisors, unseating incumbent Dennis Hansberger by winning a majority vote in the primary election.\n\nJune 30: Aleman is arrested on six felony charges of preparing false evidence, destruction of public records, and vandalism related to information sought by the county’s Grand Jury. Hours after Aleman is taken into custody, the Grand Jury issues its annual report, finding that Postmus used the Assessor’s Office to bolster his political career by setting up a political operation at taxpayer expense, spending $1 million to hire friends and political allies to help further his political career.\n\nJuly 30: Aleman pleads not guilty to six felony counts involving the destruction of evidence, altering of documents sought by the grand jury and vandalism.\n\nAug. 28: Derry hires Jim Erwin to be his chief of staff.\n\nNov. 4: The Board of Supervisors censures Postmus for his reported methamphetamine abuse and mismanagement of the Assessor’s Office.\n\n2009\n\nJan. 15: Postmus is arrested when investigators find methamphetamine in his house while serving search warrants related to their investigation into malfeasance in the Assessor’s Office.\n\nJan. 27: Supervisors hire former federal prosecutor John C. Hueston to investigate the Assessor’s Office and determine whether there is cause to remove Postmus from office.\n\nFeb. 6: Postmus announces he will resign effective Feb. 13. In his resignation letter, he hopes that his successor in the Assessor’s Office will be someone with a background in government finance and property appraisal rather than a career politician: “As we have learned, political considerations should not be a priority for any county assessor.”\n\nMarch 19: Erwin is charged with perjury for failing to disclose gifts received from Colonies Partners LP, including a ritzy trip to New York and Washington, D.C., a Rolex watch and services of a prostitute, in return for his services as a consultant for Colonies during settlement negotiations.\n\nMarch 23: Erwin resigns from his post as Derry’s chief of staff.\n\nMay 12: The county sues Postmus, five members of his executive support staff and a political consultant, accusing them of fraud, breach of fiduciary duty improper expenditure of public funds, unjust enrichment and civil conspiracy.\n\nMay 27: Rancho Cucamonga City Councilman Rex Gutierrez is arrested on suspicion misappropriation of public funds and grand theft. Prosecutors contend he was hired by Postmus as intergovernmental affairs officer in the Assessor’s Officer as a political favor to Colonies co-managing partner Jeff Burum in return for his support for Burum’s projects in Rancho Cucamonga.\n\nJune 30: Aleman pleads no contest to felony charges of destruction of public property, filing a false claim to a public officer and vandalism, agreeing to cooperate with investigators in return for reduced charges later.\n\nJuly 24: The District Attorney’s Office announces it is investigating alleged corruption related to the Colonies’ landmark 2006 settlement with the county.\n\n2010\n\nFeb. 10: Postmus and Erwin are arrested and charged with conspiracy to illegally obtain $102 million in the November 2006 Colonies settlement. Five unnamed, uncharged co-conspirators are also alluded to in the criminal complaint. They are identified as Colonies co-managing partners Burum and Dan Richards, former county Supervisor Paul Biane, Supervisor Gary Ovitt’s chief of staff Mark Kirk and public relations consultant Patrick O’Reilly.\n\nJune 30: A hung jury results in a mistrial in the case against Gutierrez. Prosecutors later refile their case, adding a conspiracy charge.\n\nOct. 27: A jury convicts Gutierrez of grand theft, fraud and conspiracy. He is later sentenced to two years, eight months in prison.\n\n2011\n\nMarch 28: Postmus pleads guilty to conspiracy and bribery as part of a plea bargain with prosecutors. He agrees to testify against other defendants in the Colonies and Assessor’s Office criminal cases in exchange for reduced charges and a possible lighter sentence.\n\nApril 26: Supervisor Derry is charged with perjury related to campaign contributions allegedly laundered through a Postmus-controlled political action committee.\n\nMay 10: New charges are filed in the ongoing probe of corruption related to the county’s $102 million settlement in 2006 with Colonies. A 29-count indictment from the Grand Jury was filed against Burum, Biane, Erwin and Kirk. The charges include conspiracy, bribery, conflict of interest, misappropriation of public funds, forgery and perjury.\n\nSources: Staff reports, court documents"
