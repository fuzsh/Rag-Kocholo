        "text": "Months ago, Joe Walsh wasn't even sure he'd vote for Mark Kirk. He didn't think the 10th District Congressman vying to win the Republican Senate primary was conservative enough for his tastes.\n\nAnd, while Walsh, a tea party member who defeated three-term 8th District Democratic Congresswoman Melissa Bean, and Kirk, a self-described moderate, may in some ways have been an unlikely pair to speak at the Crystal Lake City Hall on Saturday, you'd never know it.\n\nThe pair traded compliments and chuckles and shared in enthusiastic applause as they spent the afternoon hosting a town-hall meeting Kirk's second since being elected to the Senate and Walsh's first since declaring victory over Bean last week.\n\nThe focus was on one area the candidates agree on: reining in government spending and jump-starting the state and national economy.\n\nKirk last week gave a similar presentation in Arlington Heights with his 10th District successor, Republican Robert Dold.\n\nEarmark reform. Extending tax cuts instituted by President George W. Bush. Enacting a presidential line item veto. Small business tax breaks.\n\n“Let me say ditto to every one of Mark's reforms,” Walsh said.\n\nKirk, a five-term Congressman, introduced the crowd many of them GOP supporters who were invited through political robocalls to his “new colleague, the victor.”\n\n“Republicans won five out of our top four targeted races in Illinois,” Kirk said.\n\nWalsh said Kirk's election to President Barack Obama's old Senate seat “is a major upgrade from (outgoing Democratic Sen.) Roland Burris. This is a major upgrade nationwide. When it comes to the emergency facing us fiscally, facing our kids and our grandkids, to have someone like Kirk leading this effort in our state, we are blessed and we are fortunate.”\n\nWalsh, who returned Saturday morning from a week of Congressional orientation in Washington, D.C., spoke of his “wonderful week” with his “huge freshman class.”\n\nWhile Walsh will be sworn in come January, with the rest of that class, Kirk will be sworn into the Senate on Nov. 29 to fill the time left in Obama's Senate term with Burris' exit.\n\nBecause Illinois absentee votes are counted later than in several states across the country, a handful of other senators elected to serve in the current lame-duck session have already been sworn in.\n\nSecretary of State Jesse White's spokesman Dave Druker said he's heard from people across the country, including tea party members, who have called to ask why Kirk hasn't been sworn in yet. He said the conversations have been mostly cordial.\n\nDruker said absentee votes, which under Illinois election law were received through Nov. 16, were finalized by county election boards on Friday. The secretary of state will certify a winner by Tuesday, and a form signed by Gov. Pat Quinn and White will be shipped to the secretary of the Senate.\n\nBecause lawmakers will break for Thanksgiving, the next available day for the swearing in is Nov. 29.\n\nThough they'll be placing votes in Washington, both Kirk and Walsh pledged to be available at home from their constituents.\n\n“I'm gonna get in front of every single constituent I can over the course of the next two years, Walsh said. “It's so important. That's especially in the House that we know and understand how the people think. There's no way you can do that unless you're home all the time talking and speaking with your voters.”\n\nKirk, who noted he was once called the “king of town halls,” said “I really hope Congressman Walsh bests my record.”\n\n$PHOTOCREDIT_ON$\n\nState government writer Mike Riopell contributed to this report.$PHOTOCREDIT_OFF$"
