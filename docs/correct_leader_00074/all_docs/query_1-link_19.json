He served for a number of years Prime Minister and Foreign Minister of Finland. His appointment is a significant development and illustrates Finland's interest in the Cyprus problem, particularly in view of our country's European Union accession course and also of Finland's long-time participation in the UN peacekeeping force (UNFICYP).\n\nWe welcome Finland's interest as we also welcome every initiative in the direction of promoting a just and viable solution to the Cyprus problem.\"\n\n[02] STAGNATING CYPRUS PROBLEM IS A \"TOP-TEN WORLD OUTRAGE\" SAYS SENIOR US OFFICIAL\n\nA top US official, Anthony Lake, National Security Adviser to President Bill Clinton, has said that the fact that the Cyprus problem has remained unresolved for more than twenty years makes it one of the \"top ten outrages\" in the world.\n\nHe made the comments following a speech at Washington's Georgetown University, on October 8, when asked about a US initiative towards a solution of the Cyprus problem.\n\nHe expressed regret that the Clinton administration had not been able to do anything over the last four years and stressed that Cyprus would still be one of the President's top priorities if he is reelected.\n\n\"But I can tell you that the President is committed to making progress on this issue. If he is reelected I have no doubt that he will be pursuing this vigorously\", Lake said.\n\n[03] CHANGE IN STATE DEPARTMENT'S SPECIAL CYPRUS COORDINATOR\n\nMoving American diplomat James Williams from his role as US State Department's Co-ordinator for Cyprus to another post is part of normal procedures of \"rotation of duties\" and does not signify change in US policy, said State Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns. He stressed that Washington plans to keep up its efforts to resolve the Cyprus problem. Burns said: \"I can tell you that Ambassador Jim Williams is going to move onto other duties in the State Department after what we all believe is a very distinguished service as Special Cyprus co-ordinator,\" he said.\n\n\"This change in no way signifies any lessening of the Administration's resolve to be helpful to the parties on Cyprus, to Greece and Turkey and the Cypriot government itself\".\n\nHe added US President Bill Clinton's special emissary on Cyprus Richard Beattie will continue his role.\n\nWilliam's duties will be temporarily taken up by Carey Cavanaugh, Director of the Office of Southern European Affairs at the US State Department, Cyprus government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said. (Thursday, 10.10.96)\n\n[04] EARTH TREMORS CALMING DOWN IN CYPRUS\n\nFollowing Wednesday's (9.10.96) earthquake which shook Cyprus at 6.4 on the Richter scale, causing cracks in a few hundred buildings but leaving no casualties, the island's Seismological Station at Mathiatis, outside Nicosia, recorded 40 minor aftershocks only five of which were of 3.2-4.5 magnitude on the Richter scale on Thursday.\n\nAn official announcement said the aftershock activity appears to develop smoothly and this has been confirmed by Greek Professor of Seismology V. Papazachos, of Salonica's Aristoteleion University, an expert in seismology.\n\n[05] REFUGEE PROBLEM PUT BEFORE UN HIGH COMMISSION FOR REFUGEES IN GENEVA\n\nCyprus Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva Sotos Zakheos, speaking before the Executive Committee of the UN High Commission for Refugees, examined the widespread violations of human rights of the displaced persons worldwide. He made special reference to the 200,000 Greek Cypriot refugees, who constitute one third of the island's population and have not been allowed to return to their homes for 23 years, since the 1974 Turkish invasion and occupation of one third of Cypriot territory.\n\nZakheos noted that voluntary return of the refugees should be encouraged under conditions of safety, and added that to reach a permanent solution of the world's refugee problem, it is necessary to examine what causes the fleeing of populations. He mentioned as an example the invasion of a sovereign state by another, as was the case of Cyprus and urged the world community to isolate countries which do not respect the internationally accepted legal order.\n\nFrom the Republic of Cyprus Press and Information Office (PIO) Server at http://www.pio.gov.cy/\n\nCyprus Press and Information Office: News Updates in English Directory - Previous Article - Next Article"
