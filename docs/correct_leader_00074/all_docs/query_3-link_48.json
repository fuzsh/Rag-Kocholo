        "text": "Acting President Mauno Koivisto held a New Year's Speech in which he noted that the Madrid Follow-Up Conference on the CSFE required that all parties show political will and readiness to compromise for the Final Act formulated by the neutral countries to lead to an acceptable result. In speaking on the practice of foreign policy, President Koivisto emphasized the need for consideration in international issues, because that ensures best the possibilities for working for peace and just development. This in turn requires from the Finnish people that they are internally unanimous.\n\nThe presidential candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Mauno Koivisto, said that the most important task of the future President will be to maintain good relations with our neighbours, the Soviet Union and the Nordic countries, because that ensures our credibility also in international contexts. According to Mr Koivisto, the FCMA Treaty is a well-working entity in its present form and its extension will have to be considered in the near future. One central task for the future governments will be to increase our development aid despite the slow rate of the Finnish economy.\n\nNegotiations on the use of the Finnish development aid in Tanzania, Zambia, Kenya, Egypt, Sri Lanka and Vietnam in 1982—84 were concluded. Over 850 million marks will be used for the projects to be undertaken in these countries during that time. In 1982, the development aid consisted of 720 million marks, or 0.32 per cent of the GNP. The goal of 0.7 per cent of the GNP would presuppose an annual increase of 170—200 million marks.\n\nThe Election of the Electorial College to elect the President of the Republic took place. The voting rate was 86.6 per cent. Prime Minister Mauno Koivisto received the most votes, 43.3 per cent, which meant 144 electors. The National Coalition Party candidate Harri Holkeri had 18.7 per cent and 58 electors and the Centre Party candidate, Speaker Johannes Virolainen 16.8 per cent and 53 electors. The presidential candidate of the Finnish People's Democratic League, Kalevi Kivistö, had 32 electors with his 11.0 per cent of the votes. The candidate of the Swedish People's Party of Finland (SPPF), Jan-Magnus Jansson had 3.8 per cent of the votes and 11 electors, the Liberal Party candidate. Mrs Helvi Sipilä and the Rural Party's (RP) Veikko Vennamo both got one elector with their 1.8 and 2.3 per cent of the votes, respectively. The candidates of the Christian League of Finland and the Constitutional Conservative Party had no electors.\n\nIn his Inauguration Speech to the Parliament, President Mauno Koivisto emphasized his task in taking care of our relations with other countries. According to him, it is essential to follow the line established by Presidents J. K. Paasikivi and Urho Kekkonen. The most important task is to consolidate the good neighbourly relations with the Soviet Union based on the FCMA Treaty, to continue Nordic cooperation on the traditional basis, and to ensure that the relations we have with other countries remain good. President Koivisto assured that he will do all for keeping up the international prestige of the Finnish policy of neutrality.\n\nIn a telegram sent by President Brezhnev to congratulate Mr Koivisto on being elected President, President Brezhnev expressed his confidence in further development of the good Fenno-Soviet relations during Mauno Koivisto's Presidency and underlined the significance of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance in the maintenance the Fenno-Soviet relations.\n\nDr Mauno Koivisto was elected President of the Republic of Finland for the next six years. He received 167 votes, an absolute majority, in the first round. Mr Harri Holkeri, an Executive in the Bank of Finland, had 58 votes, Speaker Johannes Virolainen 53, Minister Kalevi Kivistö and Mr Jan-Magnus Jansson, Editor-in- Chief, both had 11 and Mrs Helvi Sipilä, Attorney at Law, had one vote.\n\nIn the Closing Ceremony of the 1981 Parliament, President Mauno Koivisto stated that the foreign political status of Finland has remained good in spite of increasing international tensions. He thanked President Kekkonen for his life's work in developing the country's foreign policy line and noted that it is essential that it be followed also in the future.\n\nIn his address at the opening ceremony of the B3th Defence Course, The Commanding General of the Finnish Defence Forces, Gen. Lauri Sutela said that although the FMCA Treaty prevents the use of Finnish territory in an attack by its mere existence, it also contains a clear defence obligation, for which our country bears the responsibility alone. According to Gen. Sutela, it is understandable that people feel concerned about nuclear weapons but it is misleading to compare the equipment acquisition of our Defence Forces with the actions of the nuclear states, as people opposing acquisitions have done.\n\nThe Chairman of the Finnish CSCE delegation Mr Richard Muller stated that the draft for a Final Act formulated by the non-aligned and neutral countries has support despite the increasing tensions in the international situation and the conflicts in the CSCE follow-up caused by the situation in Poland.\n\nIn his speech at the Opening Ceremonies of the 1982 Parliament, President Mauno Koivisto discussed the increasing inter-dependence of countries also in the field of security policy. He therefore hoped for development in disarmament talks and said that the continuation of the CSCE process must be ensured to guarantee the vital interests of Europe.\n\nIn his address at the Urgent Special Session on Golan, Mr Ilkka Pastinen the Permanent Finnish Representative in the UN said that the Finnish Government considered the decision of the Israeli government to incorporate the Golan Hills into Israel to be not only illegal but a serious new hindrance to the struggle for peace in the Middle East.\n\nThe UN general Assembly passed a resolution calling upon the Member States to sever all ties with Israel because of its decision to incorporate the Golan Hills into Israel. Finland, like all the Nordic States, voted against the resolution.\n\nThe Percentage Movement Action Group presented an initiative to the Parliament demanding that the Government endorse a schedule of increasing the development aid gradually to 0.7 per cent of the GNP by 1985.\n\nA scientific-technological cooperation programme for 1982-1983 between GKAE, the State Commission on the use of atomic energy of the Soviet Union and the Finnish Ministry of Trade and Industry was signed by I. G. Morozov, Deputy Chairman of GKAE, and Minister of Trade and Industry Pirkko Työläjärvi. The programme consists of cooperation in research and exchange of experts and information.\n\nThe Ministers of Industry and Energy of the five Nordic Countries convened in Helsinki. They discussed exploitation of the gas reserves in Northern Norway and the possibilities of the other Nordic countries to exploit the gas if a gas pipe is built from the north to Central Europe.\n\nA meeting between Finnish and Swedish ministers was held in Stockholm to discuss the situation of the Finns in Sweden. The Finnish participants were Minister of Education Pär Stenbäck, Minister of Labour Jouko Kajanoja and Minister of Social Welfare and Health Katri-Helena Eskelinen. They wanted to know if Sweden is prepared to treat the Finns in Sweden as a Nordic minority and to recognize its special status as compared with the other emigrant groups. They also emphasized the significance of Finnish education to the Finns in Sweden and discussed labour markets in Finland and Sweden and the emigration inherent in them.\n\nThe Finnish Peace Union, the Finnish UNICEF, the Red Cross and the Church's Foreign Aid made a proposal on a Bill to the parliamentary groups of all the parties; according to it donations to development aid and humanitarian work should be made deductable in taxation.\n\nThe Follow-Up Meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe convened in Madrid, with no consensus on a commonly acceptable Final Act. The reason for this was that the US and the NATO countries refused to negotiate on new proposals on lessening the existing tensions as long as there was a declared state of war in Poland. On March 2 the delegations decided to adjourn the meeting until November 9 and to have negotiations on the contentious issues in the meanwhile.\n\nThe 30th session of the Nordic Council was held in Helsinki. Fifty six ministers participated in the session, among others all the Nordic Prime Ministers. Mrs Elsi Hetemäki-Olander, a member of Finnish Parliament acted as Chairman. Economic cooperation was regarded as the most important issue in the discussions. Nordic cooperation in radio and television broadcasting will be studied by the four remaining countries after Denmark refused the cooperation. The agreement on co-Nordic labour market was revised. Efforts will be made arrive at uniform legislation on narcotics. On the last day the secretariat of the Council discussed a proposal for a seminar on a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Nordic area to be arranged outside the Nordic Council activity.\n\nPresident Koivisto paid an unofficial work visit to the Soviet Union. His party included Minister for Foreign Affairs Pär Stenbäck and Mr Ahti Karjalainen, governor of the Bank of Finland. In a speech held in Moscow, President Koivisto underlined the continuity of the Paasikivi-Kekkonen line on the basis of the FCMA Treaty and the fact that the Treaty is in the interests of both Finland and the Soviet Union. It also stabilizes the overall situation in the Nordic area and has a wider, international significance. President Brezhnev both considered the discussions a good basis for developing cooperation between the two countries and expressed his confidence that Finnish foreign political line will change as a result of the change in the person of the President.\n\nPresident Mauno Koivisto gave an interview to the Swedish Radio and Television. He said that it is early to define in detail the implementation of the plan for a Nordic nuclear-weapon free zone. According to him, Finnish foreign policy active enough; the application of the activity depends on the global situation and on the development of the Great Power relations.\n\nThe Centre Party held its annual FCMA seminar. Chairman Paavo Väyrynen said that the Treaty is correct in its present form and there is no need for changes. According to Mr Väyrynen, the Treaty will be extended in good time before it expires, at a time agreed on by both parties to the Treaty.\n\nThe Physicians for Social Responsibility commission presented a petition against nuclear war signed by physicians to President Mauno Koivisto, Prime Minister Kalevi Sorsa and Speaker Johannes Virolainen.\n\nPrime Minister Kalevi Sorsa participated in Stockholm in a panel discussion of the Swedish Arbetarrörelsens Fredsiorum (the peace forum of the labour movement). He said that if states gave a pledge that they will refrain from first strike with nuclear weapons, there would be no problems with regard to the limitation of use. He stated that it should be possible to agree on refraining from the first use of nuclear weapons and from the threat of their use on non-nuclear states without complicated negotiations. These kinds of agreements might open new possibilities for negotiations in the field of the ordinary arms control, he emphasized.\n\nThe Finnish People's Democratic League stated that they oppose the appropriation for acquisition of equipment from the Soviet Union included in the additional budget. It is indispensable that the Fenno-Soviet trade be balanced, but first there has to be an overall study made to find out if it is possible to increase the import of natural gas by extending the gas pipe to the Helsinki area, argued the FPDL.\n\nAt the Special Session on the Palestinian Question, Mr Ilkka Pastinen, the Finnish UN Ambassador, presented the appeal of the Finnish government to all the parties to the Middle East conflict to avoid force and violations of the Lebanese borders.\n\nPrime Minister Kalevi Sorsa gave an interview to the Swedish news agency TT on the Nordic nuclear-weapon-free zone. According to Mr Sorsa, there is broad and fundamental concordance about the need of such a zone. The starting point for drawing the borders of the zone would be the political borders of the Nordic countries. If the zone were to be extended outside these borders, it would necessitate negotiations with all the parties concerned. At this stage, however, it is too early to go into details. Negotiations between the Nordic countries on the foreign minister level would be the most appropriate according to the Prime Minister.\n\nIn his address at the 75th anniversary of the unicameral Parliament, President Koivisto discussed the speculations about changes in the foreign political line of the country since the Presidential Elections, which have come up in foreign press. President Koivisto said that there will not be any changes in the basis of the Finnish foreign policy line during his Presidency. Its basic goals are to keep the Nordic area a stable, nuclear-weapon-free zone and to cooperate with our neighbours both in the East and in the West.\n\nMeetings of the Representatives and the Disarmament Council of the Socialist International were held in Helsinki. There were about one hundred participants from 34 different countries, including the British Labour Party Chairman Mr Michael Foot, Mrs Gro Harlem Brunt- land from Norway, the SDP Chairman from the Federal Republic of Germany, Mr Willy Brandt, who chaired the meeting, the Finnish SDP Chairman, Mr Kalevi Sorsa, who is the chairman of the SI Disarmament Committee, and representatives of the Social Democratic Parties of South America. The final statement called upon the Great Powers to organize a high-level meeting on disarmament. Statements were also issued on the situations in Lebanon, the Falkland/Malvinas Islands and Turkey.\n\nThe Political Commission of the Finnish Communist Party demanded activity from the Finnish Government in the Special Session on Disarmament in order to speed up disarmament. At the same time it condemned the aggression by Israel on Southern Lebanon.\n\nThe Government of Finland issued a communiqué calling for immediate withdrawal of the Israeli troops from Lebanese territory. At the same time it gave its full support the Resolution passed by the UN Security Council of the same purport.\n\nThe Finnish delegation to the UN Second Special Session on disarmament was led by Prime Minister Kalevi Sorsa. In his address on behalf of Finland on June 10 he suggested that the overall study on the nuclear-weapon-free zones which was finished in 1975 be updated. He suggested an international agreement on the prevention of a nuclear war based on the agreement signed between the Soviet Union and the United States in 1973. This speech has been published in the Yearbook of Finnish Foreign Policy 1982.\n\nThe 59th Party Congress the Centre Party was held in Rovaniemi. Delegations from the Swedish and Norwegian Centre Parties and the Agrarian Parties of Poland, German Democratic Republic and Bulgaria attended the Congress as guests. In its foreign political stand the Centre Party gives its support to the Paasikivi-Kekkonen line in foreign policy, which has guaranteed stable international position for Finland and permanent good relations both with the Soviet union and with the Nordic countries. According to the Centre Party, the present and future foreign policy must work for disarmament and detente and in particular for the improvement of the position of the Third World countries.\n\nThe SOP Party Commission condemned Israel's attack on Lebanon. The Middle East conflict cannot be solved by military actions, only by guaranteeing national rights to the Palestinians including the right to establish their own state and by safeguarding permanent borders for all the states in the region.\n\nAll the Parliamentary groups suggested a comprehensive seminar on the establishment of the Nordic nuclear-weapon-free zone in a proposal directed to the Finnish Committee for Promoting Security in Europe.\n\nParliament passed the second additional budget of the year for 1,600 million. Some 450 million marks were allotted in the budget for acquisition of defence equipment from the Soviet Union.\n\nUnder-Secretary of State Keijo Korhonen wrote an article in Helsingin Sanomat in which he gave his view on disarmament systems and their results. The significance of disarmament talks has not decreased despite the stalemate situation because they will be sustained in the long run by the common wish of the Great Powers to avoid a large-scale nuclear war. The treaties signed so far have proved effective and have helped to check armament in the areas they cover. Negotiations are hampered by the creation of new weapons by the development in arms technology. Disarmament talks can be exploited in Great Power politics by striving to make the other side reduce armament. According to Mr Korhonen, the demands of the Peace Movements and disarmaments talks are in conflict: the peace movement demands instant and great changes in armament. These are difficult to realize in practice because there are wide and complicated connections behind armament and disarmament. This turns the talks into slow bargaining processes which show no instant results. This again causes constant criticism within the Peace Movement.\n\nProfessor Raimo Väyrynen discussed in the daily Suomen Sosialidemokraatti the relation between disarmament diplomacy and peace movements on the basis of Under-Secretary of State Keijo Korhonen's article of June 25. According to Professor Väyrynen it is important to keep up the disarmament negotiation machinery even if it does not bring results. He criticized the view presented by Mr Korhonen according to which the disarmament talks are a technical bargaining process which demands expertise and on which peace movement activity can have no effect.\n\nFinland was nominated to represent the Nordic countries in the IMF work group on development aid which looks into problems relating to the amount, quality and use of development aids.\n\nForeign Minister Par Stenbäck told in a press conference that Ministry for Foreign Affairs had the Cabinet's unanimous stand on the necessity of withdrawing Israeli troops from Lebanon of Protecting the civil inhabitants the Israeli Ambassador in Helsinki July 7. The message was kept on a unanimous decision of highest foreign policy leadership, which was criticized in press, others in the leaders in Suomenmaa Ithe main organ of the Centre and Helsingin Sanomat (independent daily) on the 13th and 15th August, respectively It was that the official foreign political stands must be made known to public at the time they are presented.\n\nThe Executive of the Central Organization of Trade Unions gave two statements concerning the Finnish development aid and Israel's attack in Lebanon. The development aid should be directed to countries or objects in which the money would serve development in social equality. The Israeli attack on Lebanon was condemned and it was demanded that the troops be withdrawn and the rights of the Palestinian people be recognized.\n\nThe League Board of the FPDL gave a statement condemning Israel's attack on Lebanon and demanding that the military actions be discontinued at once. It also demanded that the Finnish Government use sanctions against Israel.\n\nA statement issued by the Executive of the National Coalition Party considers the Israeli attack on Lebanon as a serious violation of the territorial sovereignty of Lebanon.\n\nAt the Urgent Special Session on the Palestinian Question. Finland voted differently from the other Nordic countries, for the resolution suggested by the non-aligned countries. The resolution censures Israel strongly for her attack on Lebanon and for her disregard for the UN Security Council Resolutions.\n\nAccording to the Finnish explanation of the vote, the resolution has to be seen as an attempt by the UN to find a just and lasting solution to the Middle East question.\n\nPresident Koivisto gave an interview to the Norwegian daily Dagbladet. According to him, there was no change in foreign policy in connection of the change of President, for the foreign policy attitudes have remained the same, President Koivisto wished that the Cabinet would take a more active part in the management of foreign policy than before. This would not, however, lessen the President's responsibility for foreign policy. The Nordic situation has remained stable because of regional cooperation. These countries should make effort to ameliorate the international situation, which would best be affected under the auspices of the UN. Keeping the Nordic region free from nuclear weapons is felt to be important in all the countries in the region. The exchange of views taking place on foreign minister level is a minor but Positive achievement, President Koivisto stated.\n\nMr Jorma Hentilä, Secretary General of the FPDL, said in Jyväskylä that there had been changes in Finnish foreign policy lately. According to him, the contents used to come first in the early 1970s, whereas the form and procedures have been emphasized in the previous years. Finnish foreign policy has emphasized national interests instead of acting for international cooperation and peace. Finland should fight more actively against tendency as the tensions increase between the Great Powers. Hentilä took a positive view of Finland's vote for the resolution on Lebanon in the UN.\n\nThe Cabinet presented its proposal for the 1983 budget to the Parliament. The appropriation in the Foreign Ministry main class was 1.279 million marks or 1.8 per cent of the whole budget. The development aid was put at 919 million marks, which corresponds to 0.37 per cent of the Gross National Product. The proposal included no new recipient countries. An office of disarmament and security is to be established in the Political Division of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The Ministry of Defence main class took up 5.0 per cent of the total, 3.947 million marks. Of that sum, 1.100 million was allotted to arms purchases. The increase in the defence appropriation was 19 per cent as Compared to the previous year, which is greater than in any other main class.\n\nMr Kalevi Kivistö repeated his demand that Finland recognize the PLO as the sole legal representative of the Palestinians.\n\nMr Jorma Hentilä is of the Opinion that Finland already is the object of a possible nuclear attack and said that the view given by the Third Parliamentary Defence Committee of a nuclear-weapon threat is thus deficient. According to Mr Hentilä, the Committee did not discuss sufficiently the Possibility of Our country being the object of a nuclear attack. The significance of foreign policy increases and that of defence decreases as the threat of nuclear attack becomes more probable.\n\nA statement issued by the work commission of the Executive of the Christian League condemned the mass murders in West Beirut and considered Israel responsible for the maintenance of law and order in the city.\n\nSpeaker Johannes Virolainen informed from Rome, where he was participating in the IPU Meeting, said he was willing to invite the PLO Leader Yasser Arafat to Finland.\n\nPresident Koivisto gave an interview to the daily Suomenmaa (the main organ of the Centre Party). According to the President, the implementation of the Nordic nuclear- weapon-free zone depends on the mutual understanding between the Soviet Union and the United States and on their Positive view on the matter. The Cabinet decision to vote for the UN General Assembly resolution condemning Israel in August was a deliberated decision which cannot be claimed to be a deviation from the foreign policy line. There was no secretiveness in the presentation of the stand on Lebanon to Israel, which became public in July. As regards procedure, it was purely normal diplomacy.\n\n— The SDP Parliamentary group stated in their stand that the PLO could open an office in Finland. They also condemned the mass murder of civilians in Beirut, for which Israel bears the responsibility, according to SOP.\n\n— The FPDL Parliamentary group presented a statement to Foreign Minister Pär Stenbäck in which they demanded prompt recognition of the PLO. The recognition of the Organization has been rejected on purely formal grounds, according to the FPDL Parliamentary group. - The SPPF parliamentary group saw no cause for recognizing the PLO. The recognition would mean deviation from the principle according to which Finland only recognizes independent states. — The parliamentary group of the Christian League rejected the idea of Inviting the PLO Leader Yasser Arafat to Finland as a guest of the Parliament, as being in conflict with Finland's official foreign policy.\n\nPrime Minister Kalevi Sorsa told that he had informed Speaker Virolainen in Rome about an eventual invitation to Mr Arafat, after having discussed the matter with President Koivisto. Foreign Minister Pär Stenbäck was of the opinion that the Prime Minister had superseded the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in discussions on the invitation. According to Mr Stenbäck, the President had got an impression of the meeting of the Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee which does not coincide with the view of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on the matter. According to the Foreign Minister, there was no decision made on an invitation to Mr Arafat, even though the matter was discussed.\n\nThe Finnish Executive of the UN Disarmament Week 1982 issued a statement objecting a rise in the defence appropriation. The commission presented a memorandum to the Parliament expressing their concern because the Finnish security policy overemphasizes the development of military defence. This trend became evident in the appropriation for arms acquisition included in the proposal for the additional budget of 1982 and the 19 per cent rise in the defence appropriation included in the 1983 budget.\n\nForeign Minister Pär Stenbäck gave the Finnish address at the UN General Assembly. He considered it important that the prestige and functioning of the UN be enhanced, because the collective security system represented by the organization is vital to small countries like Finland. The constant tensions in Great Power relations, accelerating armament and regional crises all over the world are the reason for the difficulties in reaching solutions by negotiations for example in the CSCE process, the Geneva disarmament talks and SALT negotiations. This makes it the responsibility of all the Member States to work more actively for changing the situation.\n\nSpeaker Johannes Virolainen demanded that the Cabinet take a public Stand on the inviting of Mr Yasser Arafat to Finland. According to him the Cabinet must reach unanimity on the procedures before the decision on the actual invitation is made. In Prime Minister Kalevi Sorsa's view he had given the President the correct picture of the meeting of the Cabinet Foreign Affairs Committee in where the invitation to Mr Arafat was discussed.\n\nThe FCP Central Committee condemned the mass murders of Palestinians in West Beirut and demanded that Israel withdraw from Lebanon and from all the areas occupied in 1967. The FCP demands that a prestigious invitation to Finland sent to the PLO Leader Yasser Arafat.\n\nIt was said in the leader in Suomen Kuvalehti no 41 that moral stands have become the practice in foreign policy and that the protest policy practiced will undermine the credibility of Finland's policy of neutrality. That would also mean forsaking the life work of President Kekkonen, in which emphasis was on foreign political realism, and consideration of Great Power interests in the practice of Finland's foreign policy. Foreign Minister Pär Stenbäck said in Ulkopolitiikka 4/82 that moralizing in foreign policy has not increased significantly, although superficial discussions on persons and superficial phenomena of foreign policy, have been in evidence.\n\nThe external value of the Finnish mark was devaluated again by six per cent after Sweden had devaluated the Swedish crown by 16 per cent on October 8. Also the reduction in sales tax on industrial machine and equipment investments was raised to 80 per cent as of the beginning of 1983; it was made permanent like the reduction in sales tax on industrial construction investments. In connection with the devaluation, a price stop until December 13 was introduced and the time for depreciation of productional investments was extended. The sales tax was raised by two percent as of June 1st, 1983.\n\n— The FPDL Ministers were against the devaluation and the support given to industry. Prime Minister Kalevi Sorsa regarded the devaluation as Cabinet issue.\n\nNäköpiiri no 14 published an article by Mr Kalevi Suomela, Deputy Chairman of the Peace Union of Finland, in which he gave his views on the security political status of our country: the Finnish Army has prepared itself for a war fought with conventional arms, which is of no consequence because a war between the Great Powers would be a nuclear war. The Finnish Army could well be abolished. This would not be in conflict with the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Aid because development in arms technology has lead to a situation in which the Finnish Armed Forces has no strategic weight. Finland is not threatened as much by territorial violations or possible transit of an enemy as by economic, political and social threats to which we should be able to find an answer, said Mr Suomela.\n\nThe Finnish People's Democratic League proposed that the Government find out the possibilities of organizing a meeting of non-nuclear states with the object of finding ways of promoting the control and limitation of nuclear weapons in general and the control of European nuclear weapons.\n\nThe controversy about procedures in excluding Israel from the General Assembly was solved on the basis of a Finnish proposal after a vote. The postponement of the Iranian proposal for rejection was prepared in cooperation with the other Nordic UN delegations.\n\nPresident Koivisto gave a statement on the decease of Mr Leonid Brezhnev, the Soviet President and Party Leader. He said that Mr Brezhnev worked for peace and peaceful cooperation and that the basis for the cooperation between the Soviet Union and Finland was appreciation of Finland's Position and mutual trust between the two countries. The personal relationship between President Brezhnev and President Kekkonen helped to build this trust, Mr Koivisto emphasized in his statement.\n\nCondolence telegrams on the death of President Leonid Brezhnev were sent by the Finnish Communist Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Centre Party, the Finnish People's Democratic League and the Finland-Soviet Union Society.\n\nForeign Minister Par Stenback gave a speech at the Paasikivi Society of Eastern Uusimaa. According to him the stalemate in multilateral disarmament talks is due to a lack of positive political conditions. Still, the technical preparations and disarmament research are worth while in the long run. Recent proposals for a Nordic nuclear-weapon- free zone can be seen to have furthered the cause and there is reason to assume that the zone will be seen in a more positive light as soon as international relations ameliorate.\n\nMr Jorma Hentilä- Secretary General of the FPDL, gave a lecture on the nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Nordic area. According to him, the zone should be implemented by stages so that Finland and Sweden would proclaim themselves nuclear- weapon-free and endeavour to get international recognition for the zone. After this, the zone should be extended by stages. The states participating in the zone should get negative security guarantees from the United States and the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Arab Peoples' Friendship Society of Finland organized a seminar in the Parliament on the occasion of the UN Palestine Day. The participants included representatives of the PLO.\n\nMinister of Defence Juhani Saukkonen gave an address at the Savonlinna Paasikivi-Society. According to him, the most essential obligations in the FCMA Treaty have not lost any of their significance. Neglection of the capacity to defend the country might lead to a military exploitation of our territory and even to a possible nuclear strike even if Finland were not the primary object of the attack.\n\nAccording to Foreign Minister Stenbäck, The Palestinian Liberation Organization cannot establish a political office in Helsinki, only an information office; the establishment of an office is a juridical question involving international law, not a political one. This is the Finnish stand presented to Mr Fuad Bitar, a representative of the PLO, who came to Helsinki to investigate the matter.\n\nSpeaker Johannes Virolainen spoke in a meeting organized by the Tampere Paasikivi Society. He emphasized that Parliament has a significant role in foreign policy and saw that the Constitution admits of possibilities for the Parliament to have its say in the formulation of foreign policy.\n\nThe Finnish investigation commission on Kampuchea published its report on what had happened in Kampuchea during the 1970s from the point of view of international law and Great Power politics. The Commission was assisted by five separate investigation groups at the Universities of Helsinki Tampere and Turku and at Åbo Akademie.\n\nFinland and Sweden signed an agreement on maritime rescue operations on the Gulf of Bothnia, the North Sea, the Aland Waters and in the northern parts of the Baltic.\n\nPresident Mauno Koivisto and the Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Tikhonov opened officially the first phase of Kostamuksha mining combine and town. The Finnish party consisted of representatives of the Government and the Fenno-Soviet Economic Commission. President Koivisto regarded the Kostamuksha combine as economically significant in the Fenno-Soviet trade and said that it is an important employment factor in eastern Finland. Construction will form a part of the bilateral trade also in the future. Imports to Finland should be diversified within the present framework of the cooperation.\n\nThe protocol on goods exchange between Finland and the Soviet Union for 1983 was signed in Helsinki. According to it, the total trade exchange will be 38 000 million marks, which means keeping the trade on the 1982 level. The import of energy constitutes 80 per cent of the total imports. The import of machines and equipment is to increase by 45 per cent to some 1000 million marks. Other imports include chemicals and raw materials. The greatest group in Finnish exports is metal industry products some 7500 million marks, which is nearly half of the total exports. The share of the forest industry is some one fifth of the total exports. The agreement includes for the first time a separate quota for project exports, which constitute is per cent of the total. Imports from the Soviet Union will be increased to balance the trade and 300 million roubles will be transferred to a special account. The agreement was signed by Mr Esko Rekola, the Finnish Minister for Foreign Trade, and Mr Nikolai Patolichev, the Soviet Minister for Foreign Trade.\n\nThe Fenno-Soviet Economic Commision convened in Helsinki. According to a protocol signed at the meeting, a working group will be nominated to investigate possibilities of increasing the use of natural gas in Finland. Preparations for the next five-year period of 1986— 1990 will begin in 1983. A decision was made to make precisions and to extend the long-view programme to the year 2000. The Protocol was signed by Mr Ahti Karjalainen the Finnish Chairman of the Economic Joint Commission, end Mr AN. Manzhulo, the Soviet Vice-Chairman Trade agreement worth 1800 million marks were signed in connection with the meeting. On the basis of the agreements gas, coal, fertilizers and machines will be imported to Finland.\n\nPrime Minister Kalevi Sorsa gave a speech at the closing ceremonies of the 86th Defence Course. According to him, Finland cannot greatly affect the international armament development either by her example or by her defence policy. Finland has international obligations which demand that she has sufficient capacity to defend herself. The estimations made by the Third Parliamentary Defence Committee of the situation in foreign and domestic policy are still valid. Mr Sorsa suggested that a fourth Parliamentary Defence Committee be nominated to discuss security arrangements in the present situation of scarce resources. The only possibility for Finland to have any effect in slowing down the arms race is an active disarmament policy pursued in the UN, CSCE and bilateral diplomacy.\n\nThe annual meeting of the Fenno-Soviet Chamber of Commerce was held in Helsinki. In his speech, Mr Esko Rekola, Minister for Foreign Trade, expressed his wish that more precise schedules for payments were agreed on in deals made within the five-year framework, so that problems in the balancing programme could be avoided. Mr. Patolichev the Soviet Minister for Foreign Trade, estimated that the number of construction objects far from Finland will increase in the future.\n\nForeign Minister Pär Stenbäck gave a report on the 37th UN General Assembly. The Assembly had discussed actions for regaining the UN prestige in its attempts to maintain peace and security in the world. No progress was made in the discussions on disarmament because of Great Power confrontations. According to Mr Stenbäck, Finnish actions in the strife over Israel's membership on October 26 did not affect in any way the relations between Finland and the Arab states.\n\nMr Max .Jakobson suggested in an interview with the daily Hufvudstadsbladet that a co-Nordic declaration would be the best way of affecting the Nordic nuclear-weapon-free zone. The declaration should include a statement of the fact that there are no nuclear weapons in the Nordic area, an assurance that no Nordic country will acquire or allow any other country to bring nuclear weapons into the area, a statement on the Great Powers' announcement in the UN that they will not use nuclear weapons against a country which does not posses them and an assurance that the Nordic countries will do their utmost to prevent the situation from changing. The daily Helsingin Sanomat discussed the proposition in its leader on December 12; it was hailed as a new point of view in an issue formerly held as being dependent on the Great Powers.\n\n— An independent declaration of the Nordic countries as a nuclear- weapon-free zone had already been suggested by Osmo Apunen in Ulkopolitiikka 4/78 and by Allan Rosas in Ulkopolitiikka 2/82 (as a draft for a declaration).\n\nPresident Koivisto gave an interview to the Soviet Television. According to him, the relations between Finland and the Soviet Union have developed into many-sided and active cooperation on the basis of the FCMA Treaty in the fields of politics, economy, culture and sciences. Finland's Independence Day and the Anniversary of the Revolution are closely linked because the October Revolution made Finland's independence possible as the Bolsheviks recognized it.\n\nForeign minister Pär Stenbäck said in an interview with Ydin, an organ for the Peace Movement, that the Finnish foreign policy line is to act in a consistent way and to remain outside Great Power conflicts. This affects the stands taken also on human rights issues, which reflect Great Power conflicts and thus our country has had to take a restrained line on the questions. Although Finland supports implementing the NIEO, the Finnish people are not mentally ready for its implementation.\n\nThe Finnish-Soviet Friendship Society held a meeting to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Soviet State. Mr V.M. Sobolev, Soviet Ambassador in Finland, attended the celebrations and emphasized the good relations between Finland and the Soviet Union. Mr Martti Miettunen, Chairmen of the Finland-Soviet Union Society, said that mutual trust increases and cooperation becomes firmer with better and closer knowledge of each other's situation."
