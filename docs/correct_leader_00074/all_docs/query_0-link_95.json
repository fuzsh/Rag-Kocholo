In recent years, his research work revolves around the theme of the ‘Crises in Capitalist Development’, which is manifested in the politico-economic concepts as well as the socio-ecological and technological phenomena that have emerged from his writings and publications. Notably,\n\nThe political-economic:\n\nauthoritarian neoliberalism\n\nauthoritarian populism\n\ncrisis of liberal democracy and rise of authoritarianism\n\nhuman rights against populism\n\ndisinformation, illiberalism, and historical denialism\n\nthe resurgence of nationalisms\n\nthe reproduction of neoliberalism\n\nthe contradictions between neoliberalization, democratization and autocratization\n\nsports politics and sports capitalism\n\nthe privatization of financing for development\n\nsecuritization against democratization and the war on terrorism\n\nglobal flashpoints, social conflicts, and conditions for peace\n\nelite capture of infrastructure projects associated with neoliberal policies\n\nthe political reorganization of the global justice movement\n\nplanetizing the local-global movement as a dynamic and democratic learning organization\n\nmodern monetary theory and alternative development economics\n\ntax reform and the mode of production question for domestic resource mobilization\n\nthe oligarchy and rentier capitalism\n\nThe socio-ecological:\n\ncapital accumulation and the dispossession of the commons\n\nnatural resource governance and reclaiming the commons in human-nature relations\n\nthe dialectical task of history, decolonization, and the pluriverse\n\npopular education and just sustainability\n\nThe technological:\n\nsocial innovation system and a wisdom society\n\ntechnology, market dependence, and proletarianization\n\nworkers' intellect versus Big Tech oligarchs in the regulation of AI - artificial intelligence\n\nalgorithmic management, digitalization, surveillance capitalism, and labour rights\n\nBonn has an active interest in development economics, geopolitics, political philosophy, and science, technology and innovation policy. He is an alumnus of the\n\nCambridge Advanced Programme on Rethinking Development Economics\n\nCritical Development Studies Network\n\nSouth-South Institute\n\nGlobelics Academy\n\nInstitute for Studies on Economics and Employment\n\nMarxian Economics at Keio University\n\nEuropean Association for Evolutionary Political Economy\n\nGerman Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nA reviewer for a number of reputable academic journals and other publishers such as:\n\nJournal of Contemporary Asia\n\nGeoforum\n\nGlobalizations\n\nSustainable Development\n\nInternational Migration\n\nThe Global South\n\nHousing Studies\n\nCapital & Class\n\nAustrian Journal of South-East Asian Studies\n\nActa Oeconomica\n\nJournal of Management for Global Sustainability\n\nPhilippine Political Science Journal\n\nJournal of Current Southeast Asian Affairs\n\nAsian Studies: Journal of Critical Perspectives on Asia\n\nAsia in Focus\n\nFrontiers in Communication\n\nCODESRIA Publications\n\nSpringer Nature / Palgrave Books\n\nPluto Press\n\nhe is the former Editor-in-Chief of The Interdisciplinary Journal of International Studies, and presently an Editorial Committee Member of Asia in Focus.\n\nMoreover, for some years now, Bonn has been a regular participant and member of D-Econ (Diversifying and Decolonising Economics); IIPPE (International Initiative for the Promotion of Political Economy); Global University for Sustainability (South South Forum); WEA (World Economics Association); AHE (Association for Heterodox Economics); EuroSEAS (European Association for Southeast Asian Studies); NYCAS (New York Conference on Asian Studies – Association for Asian Studies); and AEPF (Asia-Europe People’s Forum).\n\nThe Relevance and Benefits of Ongoing Research\n\nBonn’s current research endeavour investigates the political economy of recent foreign policy shift from the old state-to-state aid relations to the new economic diplomacy focused on private sector development. Studying this emergent phenomenon on the private turn in Nordic countries’ development cooperation with different types of regime in Asia is important in terms of: [i] present knowledge of North-South development relations; [ii] feasible development strategies for both developed and developing countries; and [iii] the implications for developmental prospects and democratization processes of what used to be known as aid recipient ‘Third World’ countries.\n\nIn pursuit of Sustainable Development Goals, there are two elephants in the room of foreign policy: the strategic role assigned to the private sector and the ubiquity of politics. This study provides research-based knowledge about the practical mechanisms of Private Sector Development (PSD) and the political aspect necessary for the attainment of the target on Policy Coherence for Sustainable Development (PCSD). It addresses the question: How do donor governments and their supported enterprises strategize for their development investments (formerly known as aid) in partner countries with different political regime contexts? Its aim is to capture the realpolitik of Nordic government-business strategizing adapted to the challenging markets of particular Asian regimes. As such, it will also have critical relevance to all stakeholders concerned with ethics in development cooperation and the principle of policy coherence for sustainability.\n\nSubmitted Grant Applications Under Review (Prospective collaborators are welcome.)\n\nThe Politics of Development Cooperation thru the Private Sector: Assessing Policy Coherence for Sustainability in Finnish Government-Business Strategies Across Asian Regimes\n\nInvolvement in Funded Research Projects\n\n[Past research projects involvement, see the Estonian Research Information System, Dimensions, and Aalborg University’s VBN Research Portal.]\n\nIslamic Public Value: Theory, Theology, and Practice of Indigenous Cooperative Governance Institutions, 2022-2025; Grantee: UCL-IIPP University College London - Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose; Funded by the John Templeton Foundation; PI: Wolfgang Drechsler; Co-PI: Rainer Kattel; Role: Lead Researcher for the Cluster on Governance in the Southeast Asian region, specifically the case of Muslim Mindanao\n\nAlgorithmic Management and Workers Rights, 2023-2024; Coordinator: Foundation for European Progressive Studies; Funder: European Parliament; Local Partners in Finland: Kalevi Sorsa Foundation and Demos Helsinki; Role: Expert and Researcher\n\nLegGov - Legitimacy in Global Governance Program, 2016-2022, Departments of Political Science at Lund and Stockholm University and the School of Global Studies at the University of Gothenburg; Funded by Riksbdeanken Jubileumsfond; PI: Jan Aart Scholte and Jonas Tallberg; Role: Research consultant for country case study on the Philippines for the project “Elite attitudes toward global governance”\n\nIS-LE - Islamic Legacy: Narratives East, West, South, North of the Mediterranean (1350-1750), 2019-2023, COST Action CA18129, European Cooperation in Science and Technology; Role: Management Committee Substitute\n\nCrisis, State Transformation and Social Change: Contrasting Political-Economic Development Strategies in Malaysia and the Philippines since 1997, 01.08.2008-31.07.2011; PhD Scholarship in Global Development Studies, 2007-562/05-0221; Role: Principal Investigator as PhD Fellow\n\nPublic Administration and Development in Small States, Project SF0140094s08 - Ministry of Education and Research of Estonia, 01.01.2008-31.12.2013; Ragnar Nurkse School of Innovation and Governance, Tallinn University of Technology; PI: Rainer Kattel; Role: Co-PI\n\nInnovation Policy and Uneven Development, 01.01.2009-31.12.2011, Project ETF8097 - Estonian Science Foundation; Tallinn University of Technology; PI: Erik Reinert; Role: Co-PI (Senior Personnel)\n\nConverting National Wealth to Productive Capacity: Successes and Failures from the Laboratory of History - Cases of Sovereign Wealth Funds (Norway's 1905 Savings Fund, Spain and De-Industrialization, US Land Grant Movement, Abu Dhabi, Alaska, Alberta, New Mexico, Singapore, Texas, and Venezuela), 01.08.2008-30.09.2008; Sponsored by the Leif Høegh Foundation (Norway) for the 100th Anniversary of the Harvard Business School; PIs: Erik Reinert & Carlota Perez; Role: Researcher and Technical Note Writer\n\nDocumenting the Flow of Ideas in the History of Economic Thought, 01.02.2007-31.07.2007, The Other Canon Foundation (Norway); Role: Research assistance to the PI Erik Reinert\n\nRagnar Nurkse and Development Policy, 01.01.2006-31.12.2009, Project ETF6703 - Estonian Science Foundation; Tallinn University of Technology; PI: Rainer Kattel; Role: Co-PI (Senior Personnel)\n\nTEACHING\n\nIn terms of teaching, Bonn won the JYU Good Teacher Award 2024 (Hyvä opettaja -palkinto 2024) for being \"an open-minded, enthusiastic, and diligent teacher ...
