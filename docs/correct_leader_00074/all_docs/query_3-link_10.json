        "text": "In these changing geopolitical landscapes, the European Union finds itself lacking the capacity to defend Ukraine or influence the cessation of hostilities in the Middle East. Obviously, EU must continue the supporting Ukraine, but it also has the opportunity to solve problems in its own immediate neighborhood, notably the Western Balkans.\n\nThe onset of the Russian invasion of Ukraine has further complicated the dynamics within the Western Balkans. Russia has demonstrated not only its ability to halt the region’s progress towards EU integration but also its capacity to instigate unrest, cause instability, and intimidate Europe by suggesting the possibility of opening a ”second front” in the Balkans.\n\nAlthough lacking the power to incite a widespread war in the region, Russia has shown it can provoke disturbances i.e. in Northern Kosovo, which is evidenced by the terrorist attack in Banjska, Kosovo, thereby signalling to the EU and its Western allies its active and destructive presence in the Western Balkans.\n\nThis malign influence is predominantly funnelled through the regime of President Aleksandar Vučić in Serbia. Vučić’s administration, alongside Lukashenko’s in Belarus, stands out in Europe for its refusal to align Serbian foreign and security policy with that of the EU. Amidst the war in Ukraine, Serbian officials have been rewarded by Putin for adhering to a so-called military and foreign policy neutrality, which, in reality, solely benefits Moscow’s regime.\n\nSerbia remains the only country, besides Belarus, not to impose sanctions on Russia. Instead it has chosen to deepen its cooperation with Russia since the onset of aggression against Ukraine. Thus, Russia impedes Serbia’s EU integration and reform processes. Russia has also extended its influence to Northern Kosovo, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and even North Macedonia.\n\nDoes this necessitate Serbia’s isolation? No. Should efforts towards strengthening democracy and rule of law in the Western Balkans be abandoned? Certainly not. Any neglect by Western partners, whether partial or total, merely solidifies Russia’s influence network and further undermines peace in the region.\n\nTHE NORDIC COUNTRIES COULD HELP IN RESOLVING WESTERN BALKANS CHALLENGES\n\nFirstly, the political instability of the six small Western Balkan states should be addressed by the European Union. The EU must assert that the Western Balkans fall within its sphere of influence and interest. It needs to demonstrate the functionality of its political mechanisms and its capacity to successfully integrate the Western Balkans. Such actions would significantly bolster the EU’s self-confidence and credibility, as becoming a global power necessitates proving its efficacy as a regional force first.\n\nSecondly, the time has come for EU member states to shoulder part of the burden of Western Balkans European integration, showing additional solidarity with the EU’s consolidation efforts. It’s widely acknowledged that the existing model of EU enlargement has depleted its capacities and trust, necessitating a rejuvenating approach, particularly with the aid of EU member states themselves. Here, the Baltic model of EU integration, associated with Finland, merits consideration.\n\nDuring the 1990s, as the three Baltic states embarked on their journey towards EU membership, three Nordic EU member states—Denmark, Sweden, and Finland—partnered with Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. These Nordic countries provided the Baltic’s with training for public officials, assistance in law harmonization, institution building, and the establishment of necessary decision-making and implementation procedures. They also facilitated communication with EU institutions. This approach is heralded as the most successful instance of EU integration since 2004, if not in its entire history.\n\nThe neutrality of the Nordic countries is one of the reasons to apply the Baltic model in the Western Balkans. The role of the largest member states or neighboring countries, would be problematic for the Western Balkans as they have political interests in the region. It could undermine the citizens trust in the EU and the integration process.\n\nTherefore, the six EU member states – Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Estonia would be excellent partners. They are stable democracies with no particular political interests in the Western Balkans. In addition, they are strongly committed to the EU."
