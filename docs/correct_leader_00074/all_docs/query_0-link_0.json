        "text": "Just Ecological Transition\n\nHow should our societies be developed in order to make them environmentally sustainable? How can the ecological transition be implemented fairly?\n\nIn terms of just ecological transition, Kalevi Sorsa Foundation works as a link between research, politics, the labor movement and non-governmental organizations. The goal is to create a dialogue between different actors in the field and to bring new openings and international ideas to the Finnish discussion.\n\nDemocracy Support\n\nKalevi Sorsa Foundation’s democracy support focuses on promoting multicultural and functioning democracy in the Western Balkans. Our project aims at strengthening the voice of young people by training politically active youth in North Macedonia, Albania, and Bosnia-Herzegovina. We also facilitate cooperation between political think tanks in the Western Balkans across national and ethnic borders. The project is funded by the Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs.\n\nOur project promotes democracy and stability in the Western Balkans by strengthening civil society. The project has two elements: political academies for future leaders in Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina and North Macedonia, and a series of seminars for political think tanks in the target countries, which will strengthen the capacity of think tanks, increase interaction between them and improve social dialogue in the target countries.\n\nPolitical academies are training programmes funded in collaboration with the Swedish Olof Palme International Center and the German Friedrich Ebert Stiftung. The focus of the trainings is on strengthening the capacity of civil society, especially young people who are active in politics or CSOs. The training covers, among other things, multiculturalism and ethnicity, democracy, freedom of expression, and equality of women and minorities. At the same time, Finnish good practices are highlighted in the trainings. Local partner organisations – North Macedonian Progres Institute for Social Democracy, Bosnia-Herzegovinan Forum of Left Initiative and Albanian Qemal Stafa Foundation – are responsible for the practical implementation of the political academies.\n\nIn addition, the project strengthens cooperation and networking between political think tanks in the Western Balkans. By supporting the interaction between think tanks, we can promote the transfer of best practices from one country to another, for example in the fight against corruption, the inclusion of minorities, and EU integration. This component of the project is implemented in cooperation with the Progres Institute in North Macedonia.\n\nThe project is coordinated by Jelena Simić."
