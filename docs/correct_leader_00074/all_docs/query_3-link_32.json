The Finnish, German and finally he was a green beret colonel whose chopper got shot down in Vietnam.\n\nSnauhi said:\n\nRisto Ryti dint sarciface him self for peace he just started the second war and lost it..\n\nI don't think Ryti was the only one to blame for the Continuation War. The people wanted revenge for the losses of the Winter War. And he did sacrifice himself in a way. Ryti is a complex character and only now in the latter years he has achieved some form of vindication.\n\nDuring the Soviet offensive in 1944 in order to gain German antitank-weapons, he said to Hitler that Finland would never try to make separate peace if he's the president. Ryti then resigned soon after this statement and and Mannerheim became president and immediately started the peace negotiations. Then Ryti was sentenced to 10 years in hard labor. I do know that Ryti was no saint but he was certainly a great patriot.\n\nHegario said:\n\nSnauhi said:\n\nRisto Ryti dint sarciface him self for peace he just started the second war and lost it..\n\nI don't think Ryti was the only one to blame for the Continuation War.

V-style and \"elämä on laiffii\". 8)\n\n\"I don't think Ryti was the only one to blame for the Continuation War. The people wanted revenge for the losses of the Winter War.\"\n\nThere was no way to avoid continuation war. Russians were going to invade Europe in summer -41. In summer -40 Molotov had even requested permission to \"solve finnish solution\" from Germany but Hitler refused. That and a lot of other plans have been proved afterwards by russians themselves after Soviet Union collapsed.\n\nRyti cheated germans quite well and got a lot of german weapons and supplies like panzerfausts, panzerschrecks, StuG IIIs, 75mm PaK40s, BF109Gs wich were really needed in summer -44 battles. What would have happened in Tali-Ihantala without german AT-weapons? How could have russians been once again stopped without them? With great assistance of new weapons in june-july -44 russians lost 750 tanks on isthmus and 200 in eastern Karelia. Please, \"Great hand\" to Ryti!\n\nOne of the most famous pictures from Tali-Ihantala.\n\nBy the way StuG IIIs are still unpaid but would germans \"unsere waffenbrudern\" like to get paid but a little late? :lol:\n\nI must say that Simo Häyhä is the greatest Finn. I quote \"A member of the 34th Infantry Regiment and a farmer by trade, Simo Häyhä became a most feared sniper during the 1939-40 (30 November 1939 14 March 1940) Winter invasion of Finland by the Soviet Union. Using nothing more than an iron sighted Mosin-Nagant Model 28, Simo is credited with killing 505 Russians during a three month period - a feat still unmatched today by any sniper in any conflict. (Editor's note: Some sources say as many as 542 kills in this period.) The impact of Simo and men like him forced the Soviets to pay dearly for their transgressions. While Finland lost the Winter war, it cost the Soviets 1,000,000 men killed out of the 1,500,000 man invading force*. The Finns lost a total of 25,000 men in that conflict. A testament to their bravery and determination in the face of amazing odds.\n\nHe passed away on April 1st 2002 at the age of 96\n\n*Information gleaned from Rifles of the White Death. Doug Bowser.
