Russia’s aggression has set major challenges on multiple fronts, being one the most severe existential and security crisis Europe and its neighbourhood have faced in decades.\n\nEven when the war is over, the destinies of the EU, which Finland is an integral part of, and Ukraine will continue to be tied to each other. Against this background, as part of our public discussion, we wanted to foster together the development of a progressive vision on the recovery and transformation of Ukraine in a way that advances a broader concept of peace, security & democracy (in Europe and beyond).\n\nA vision, which addresses the question on how to set the basis for substantive democracy and sustainable peace in Ukraine – and by extension build more resilient Europe and Finland. Among the questions we addressed:\n\nWhat does “build back better” entail in the case of Ukraine?\n\nHow to implement the recovery process in a way that strengthens its civil society and improves democratic resilience?\n\nWhat is the strategic and national interest of Finland in supporting Ukraine’s post-war recovery?\n\nWhat are the risks if the recovery is not implemented in a progressive and sustainable way?\n\nThe discussion was moderated by Andriy Korniychuk, Policy Analyst on International Relations, FEPS.\n\nNetwork\n\nKalevi Sorsa Foundation\n\nRelated events\n\nFEPS HQ, Brussels\n\n‘Europe and the war in Ukraine’ book launch\n\nRelated publications\n\nEurope and the war in Ukraine\n\nFrom Russian aggression to a new Eastern policy\n\nFind all related publications\n\nPublications\n\nThe European Political Community\n\nInformality as a key to success\n\nProgressive Yearbook 2024\n\nLooking back to look ahead\n\n(Re)Building the future\n\nProgressive Ukraine series\n\nForging Europe’s leadership\n\nGlobal trends, Russian aggression and the risk of a regressive world\n\nFind all related events\n\nEvents\n\nFind all related news\n\nNews\n\nNotice of vacancy – Policy analyst on international relations\n\nThis vacancy is now closed.\n\nFEPS President on Euronews talk-show ‘Brussels, my love?’\n\nNATO extension, Portuguese elections, far-right and gender equality were the topics of the debate\n\nCall for tender – Research and analysis for the project “Progressive paths to rebuild Ukraine”\n\nThis call for tender closed on 26/09/2023\n\nGrzegorz Pietruczuk is FEPS Progressive Person of the Year\n\nFEPS Progressive Person of the Year 2023\n\nFind all related in the media\n\nIn the media\n\nFEPS President on Euronews talk-show ‘Brussels, my love?’\n\nby Euronews 16/03/2024\n\nFEPS President Maria João Rodrigues discusses NATO expansions and elections in Russia and Portugal on Euronews talk-show ‘Brussels, my love?‘\n\nWhat are Hungary’s conditions for lifting its Ukraine Facility veto?\n\nby Euractiv 12/01/2024\n\nIn this episode, Evi Kiorri asks Andriy Korniychuk, policy analyst and expert on Ukraine matters at the Foundation for European Progressive Studies: what are Viktor Orbán's conditions, and why is Hungary considering changing its position?\n\nUkrainian economy and society: whither the (postwar) country?\n\nby Commons 16/06/2023\n\nIn Commons' article, Yuliya Yurchenko, co-author of FEPS’ book 'Europe and the war in Ukraine', outlines the consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine for the Ukrainian population and the plans needed for Ukraine's recovery.\n\nRebuilding Ukraine will require radical economic change\n\nby openDemocracy 16/06/2023\n\nIn OpenDemocracy's article, Yuliya Yurchenko, co-author of FEPS’ book 'Europe and the war in Ukraine', outlines the consequences of the Russian invasion of Ukraine for the Ukrainian population and the plans needed for Ukraine's recovery."
