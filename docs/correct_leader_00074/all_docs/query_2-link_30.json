She later became chair of the Finnish National Organization for Sexual Equality. Halonen was a member of the Helsinki City Council from 1977 to 1996. In 1979 she was elected to parliament as a candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP). In parliament Halonen broadened her experience in domestic and international politics by holding a number of cabinet posts. Before her appointment as foreign affairs minister in 1995, she served as minister of social affairs and health (1987–90), minister for Nordic cooperation (1989–91), and minister of justice (1990–91).\n\nIn 2000 Halonen was nominated as the SDP candidate for president.
