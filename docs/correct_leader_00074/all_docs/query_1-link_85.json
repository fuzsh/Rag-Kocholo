        "text": "Associations of Former Members of Parliament\n\nShort overview\n\nby Kai Priks\n\n(adviser to the Social and Economic Information Department of the Chancellery of the Riigikogu)\n\nand Kaarel Haav\n\n5 April 1999 / No 284\n\nThe short overview includes data on ex-parliamentarians’ social activities in Germany, France, Belgium, Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. A representative of the European Parliament has also filled in the questionnaire sent out to him.\n\nThe brief questionnaire, sent to the parliaments of the above countries, was compiled in Estonia on the basis of a request of former members of the Riigikogu. In the near future, meetings with both the Swedish and the Danish former parliamentarians shall take place in Estonia.\n\nConclusions\n\nFormer members of the European Parliament\n\nAssociation of European Former Members of Parliament\n\nFinland\n\nSweden\n\nDenmark\n\nBelgium\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nJapan\n\nPoland\n\nCzech Republic and Hungary\n\nConclusions\n\nOn the basis of gathered information it can be concluded that informal or officially registered associations of former parliamentarians are a widespread practice in the world. Beside national associations, the deputies of Germany, France, Belgium, Italy and Turkey have created the umbrella association of former parliamentarians of Europe. There is also an association of the Nordic countries. The forms of official gatherings of the mentioned associations are annual meetings or a course of lectures or the trips in their own country (Germany, Finland, Belgium) and to other countries (France, Germany, Finland, Sweden, Belgium). Former members of parliament are granted with free access to the parliament building, to the library, in organisational matters they are provided with services of parliament officials. The activities of associations are usually financed from member fees. But, for instance, the Bundestag, the Upper and the Lower House of Belgium and the Riksdag give regular subsidies to the so-called veteran clubs. The Danish Parliament gives partial support to single events of their former members. The Association of the Japanese House of Councilors and the German Association publish their own information bulletin.\n\nSubsequently we shall give a more detailed description of the above associations.\n\nFormer members of the European Parliament have not established a formal association. In this place it should be noted that they may be members of the Parliamentary Association (Parliamentary Association: Avenue de l´Europe 67000, Strasbourg). The named association is based on private initiative and it has no direct connection with the European Parliament as an institution. Former members of the EP are granted with free access to the buildings of the EP and they may use the library and garage and have a light meal in the restaurant. However, a proposal has been made that former members of parliament would have an opportunity to use office rooms. Former members of parliament do not get any financial subsidies besides the so-called transition compensation or the compensation due to the expiry of the term of office, related with the years of service.\n\nAssociation of European Former Members of Parliament\n\nPreliminary work for the creation of an all-European umbrella organisation of former parliamentarians started at the meeting of German and French representatives in Bonn, in 1981. Soon the deputies of Belgium and Italy also joined those meetings. At first the former representatives of other countries took also part in the meetings of national associations. In 1986 the first co-operation agreement was concluded. In 1993 the representatives of Belgium, Italy, France, Germany and Turkey established Association europeenne d´anciens parlementaires des pays membres du Conseil de l´Europe. Its first president was prof. Vedovato, former president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, he was succeeded by M. Augarde in 1996. The Board of the Association includes two members, for instance, from Germany. At general meetings Germany has three seats. The administrative centre is in Brussels, at the Belgian Senate.\n\nIn Germany the Association of Former Members of the Bundestag ( and Landtags ) and the European Parliament was established on May 3, 1977. The Association has its own statutes (see the Appendix), their own newspaper Nachrichte is published twice a year. As of the beginning of 1999 there are 600 members in the Association.\n\nThe bodies of the association are the general meeting and the board. General meetings take place at least once a year. Usually 60-120 members participate in them. The board is elected for two years. The board consists of a president, two vice-presidents, a secretary and a treasurer. Up to four assessors may be included in the board. The board also elects a business manager as an honorary post.\n\nThe annual member fee is DM 150. The Bundestag gives subsidies to the association in the amount of approximately 140,000 German marks in a year. The Association has its own office and a business manager. The yearly turnover amounts to 240,000 marks.\n\nThe weekly Das Parlament is sent to all the members by the Bundestag.\n\nOne of the greatest annual regular events is visiting one of the federal countries. Visits to sister organisations in other countries are also organised. In the first half-year of 1998 there have been visits to Copenhagen, Paris, Vienna, Virginia, Arnheim and Brussels.\n\nThe Association also organises many other topical meetings.\n\nIn France former senators may join \"The Senate’s Circle of Friends\", representing an official statutory association (see Appendix, \"The Statutes of the Senate’s Circle of Friends\", adopted at the extraordinary sitting of the General Meeting on Nov. 15, 1972 and amended at the sittings of the General Meeting on Nov. 19, 1979, on Nov. 21, 1980 and on May 20, 1996).\n\nThe Senate’s Circle of Friends holds two meetings in a year, involving dinner. In addition, every year they organise two trips, one of which is a week in Europe and the other, a two-week trip – to far-off countries.\n\nOwing to member fees, the Senate’s Circle of Friends can function, but it does not receive any support from the Senate. However, the association may convey its post through the Senate free of charge.\n\nFormer senators are entitled to a pension and they are members of the social insurance fund of the Senate as before. They have free access to the Luxembourg palace, to the Senate’s restaurant and library. Transport facilities, particularly in air and railway transport, apply also to former senators.\n\nIn Belgium the Association Pro Lege has been established, including the former parliamentarians of the Upper as well as the Lower House. Twice a year there is the so-called meditation day. Every year the General Meeting takes place. Trips within Belgium and to foreign countries are organised.\n\nThe association receives annual financial endowment from the Upper and Lower House (up to 200,000 Belgian francs each). In addition, the annual payment in the amount of 1250 Belgian francs has been established for the members of the association.\n\nIn Finland the Association of Former Members of Parliament was established in 1990. The Association was convened by the Speaker Kalevi Sorsa. The foundation meeting was held in the Parliament Hall.\n\nThe Association has been registered in the register of Finnish Associations. Its English name is Finnish Association of Former Members of Parliament (mailing address: 00102 Eduskunta, Finland ).\n\nThe Association is trying to apply the experience of the former MPs for promoting parliamentary democracy. They also try to develop solidarity between the former MPs of their own country as well as of other countries.\n\nFor attaining the named goals, the Association 1) organises meetings and discussions for the former MPs, 2) disseminates information and experience related to the parliamentary work, 3) informs its members about topical issues, 5) deals with the problems of former MPs.\n\nThe Association is independent and its activities are not connected with the Parliament, however, the Parliament officials do help the Association in dealing with all the administrative issues.\n\nThe Association is financed by its members (the yearly payment is 50 Finnish marks). The costs of information, travel expenses of the administration and the expenditures related to foreign visitors are covered by member fees. The Association has never applied for, neither received any government subsidies, not even from the Eduskunta.\n\nHowever, the Eduskunta contributes to the activities of the Association, reimbursing the travel expenses of the participators in the annual General Meeting within the boundaries of Finland. The meetings have been held in different places of Finland. Participators of the General Meeting can get compensation in the amount of the actual cost value, according to the regulation concerning the travels of officials. The Eduskunta compensates for the travel expenses of the members of the Association and their spouses to the General Meeting of the North Association of Former Members of Parliament.\n\nThe representatives of the North Association visit regularly the annual General Meetings. The Eduskunta takes care of them during their stay in Helsinki.\n\nThe General Meeting is usually held in spring. Some city governments invite the Association to visit them, provide them with dinner and with a room of a city council for holding the meeting. The meeting is followed by a report of an expert in some field or a visit to a local institution (for instance, to a university). Then the Mayor gives a reception, which brings the event to an end.\n\nThe rest of activities of the Association is carried out in the Hall of the Eduskunta in autumn, when the Prime Minister makes a report about the political situation. Almost all the former living members of the parliament have joined the Association and they are respected by the Eduskunta.\n\nIn Denmark there is also the Association of Former Members of Parliament, analogous to Finland, having the same goals and forms of work. Denmark is a country, where informal social activity is of great importance, but less attention is paid to formalising and institutionalising of this activity. Therefore the Danish Association has not officially been registered, but it does not prevent the state from supporting its undertakings. The state of Denmark gives an active, but not a 100 per cent support to the third sector. The state gives subsidies to many events of the Former Members of Parliament, but every time a new application is needed and the compensation is only a partial one (for instance, in the amount of one-third of all expenses). As a general rule, the members themselves must finance their events, they must also find other sponsors.\n\nThe Danish Association has also taken interest in Estonia, planning to visit Estonia in the near future and to meet with former Members of Parliament of Estonia (according to the information by Mrs. Silvi Teesalu, Head of Danish Cultural Institute ).\n\nIn Sweden, the former members of parliament, whose authorities have terminated, may join the so-called Club of Veterans (Riksdagens veteranförening ). According to the statutes, the goal of the Club is to call the ex-parliamentarians together, to exchange experience accumulated in parliamentary work. The most important event of this year will be a trip to Estonia at the beginning of May. Visits to the Swedish Embassy, to the Riigikogu, meetings with present and former members of the Riigikogu are included in the plan.\n\nThe Speaker of the Parliament also contributes to the activities of the Swedish Club of Veterans, for instance, gives a dinner on the occasion of the annual meeting of the Club. The Riksdag grants subsidies to the Club ( SEK 180,000 in a year ).\n\nIn Japan there are two associations of former members of parliament: the Association of the House of Representatives and the Association of the House of Councilors. The Association of the House of Representatives is informal, but the Association of the Former Members of Parliament of the House of Councilors has been officially registered, they have their statutes and a written annual plan of activities. The Association publishes its information bulletin four times a year.\n\nThe main spheres of activity of the Association of the House of Councilors are the following :\n\nresearch and analysis of parliamentary systems,\n\norganisation of lectures, conferences and training,\n\ncollection of publications concerning parliamentary activities and the publication of books in the same field.\n\nBoth Houses have given to the Associations of Former Members of Parliament their own office premises in the House of Parliament. Some services of the Committees’ Research Service are also available to them, they may use the MPs’ Reading Hall in the National Diet Library and the services of the Research and Legislation Bureau of the National Diet Library.\n\nThe activities of the Associations are financed only from member fees. The Associations have got no subsidies either from the Parliament or the Government.\n\nIn Poland the Association of Former Members of Parliament was originally a democratic opposition, formed in connection with the elections of 1989. This parliamentary group consisted of anti-communist forces, later split into several parties. After some splittings a new association was established in 1996, named Parliamentary Club of Citizens. The Club has its own statutes and meetings are held twice or three times a year. In organisational matters an official, serving the members of parliament, assists the named Club. For carrying out its activities and for organising its meetings, the Club has not received any financial subsidies from the Polish Seim or any other institutions.\n\nIn the Czech Republic and in Hungary there is no officially registered Association of Former Members of Parliament and there are no informal activities of the kind. However, former members of the parliament of Hungary are entitled to an allowance related to the termination of the term of office in 6 months after the expiry of authorities.\n\nThe following appendixes are available at the Department of Economic and Social Information of the Riigikogu Chancellery :\n\n1.
