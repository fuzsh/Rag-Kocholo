        "text": "The social democrat Kalevi Sorsa, who has died aged 73, was the longest-serving prime minister in Finnish history. He led four governments, 1972-75, 1977-79, 1982-83 and 1983-87, and was foreign minister in three cabinets. He was also instrumental in reshaping the dormant Socialist International, of which he was vice-president from 1980 to 1996, into a meaningful meeting place for western socialist parties and their leaders - including Harold Wilson and James Callaghan, Germany's Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt, Austria's Bruno Kreisky and Sweden's Olof Palme.\n\nSorsa was very much a Scandinavian social democrat, an idealistic man who saw politics as a noble calling that could help make the world a better place. He had been an active member of the Finnish Social Democratic party since his youth, but came to the forefront of politics relatively late in life.\n\nBorn in the village of Keuruu, near Tampere, in southern Finland, Sorsa and his family went wherever his father's roadbuilding work took them. In the 1950s, he worked as a journalist on two socialist newspapers, for the Finnish news agency, and as a non-fiction editor for the publishing house Tammi. He moved to Paris to work for Unesco, from 1959 to 1965, and took a journalism degree (1957) and an MA in literature (1963) from Tampere University.\n\nOn returning to Finland, he worked in the education ministry, becoming deputy director from 1967 until 1969, when Rafael Paasio, the then leader of the ruling Social Democrats, made him his surprise choice for the post of secretary-general, effectively the organisation's number two. An outsider, untarnished by party infighting, he quickly showed his talent for achieving consensus. In 1972, Paasio became prime minister, and made Sorsa foreign minister; he succeeded Paasio as premier later the same year, and as party leader in 1975.\n\nSorsa's rapid rise was due more to ability and luck than planning and ambition. Finland had a multiparty system, and his capacity for securing agreement, even over the political divide of left and right, was very useful - this was the way to survive in Finnish politics in the 1970s. And President Urho Kekkonen, who led the country from 1956 to 1982, did not regard him as competition.\n\nKekkonen's main concern was relations with the Soviet Union; he needed national unity to back him up, and Sorsa did not challenge his supremacy in this field. At the same time, Sorsa kept the unruly leftwing of the Social Democrats in order, and split the Communist party by inviting them to join his centre-left coalition. When the communists deviated from the straight and narrow, he unceremoniously removed them from his cabinet, despite the president's mild objections.\n\nIn internal politics, he had a free hand, using it to turn Finland into a welfare state, with good social benefits, such as long maternity leave and free university education. His economic policies were not enormously successful, but his emphasis on education helped lay the foundations for future prosperity.\n\nIn 1975, Sorsa declared that the future of Finland lay in socialism. Captains of industry ran scared, until they realised that he did not mean the Soviet kind, but the Swedish model - a welfare state firmly based in democracy. After this, a large part of Finnish industry came to see him as the guarantor of industrial peace.\n\nWith increasing power, however, came inevitable fights with the media. In the 1980s, Sorsa coined the term \"infocracy\", meaning the media's misuse of its power. Later, he accused parts of the the press and television of forgetting information and concentrating on entertainment.\n\nSorsa was not a charismatic leader. This, and his troubled relations with the media, ensured he never took the presidency. In 1982, following Kekkonen's departure, he did not even enter the race, which went to fellow social democrat Mauno Koivisto; when Koivisto retired in 1994, Sorsa lost to the diplomat Martti Ahtisaari, a non-political candidate supported by Sorsa's own party who went on to help achieve peace in Kosovo in 1999.\n\nA humble, kind man from humble origins, Sorsa loved poetry and culture. He was an idealist, who thought that socialism was too good and humane an ideal to be left to communists. On principle, he did not accept any honours from the state.\n\nAfter his last term as foreign minister (1987-89), he served as parliamentary speaker for two years, then joined the board of the Bank of Finland, from which he retired in 1997. The second volume of his uncompleted memoirs was published last year.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Irene, whom he married in 1953; they had no children."
