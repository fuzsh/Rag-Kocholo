        "text": "So, today is The UK’s Big Day. Unless there's an unprecedented polling failure, we’ll wake up tomorrow with a hefty Labour majority government. After a 14 year Tory trainwreck, that does count for something. Governing won’t be easy. Domestically, Labour inherit decimated public services and an anaemic economy marked by low productivity growth and underinvestment. Meanwhile the international system is increasingly unstable, and the worsening environmental crisis is impacting the domestic economy more severely each year. Labour’s positioning of itself as the party of security and stability might seem an easy win given the chaos and misconduct of their predecessors, but it's also risky. Over the next five years, external conditions will continue to deteriorate. Not linearly, not immediately and not in every sense, but they will. And that severely limits the operating space open to national administrations everywhere, including the UK. If Labour's flagship missions and its ‘securonomics’ programme can't sufficiently insulate the country from this, they’ll be in trouble. Consider the polling around Biden’s presidency, despite his deploying far more economic firepower than Starmer and Reeves could even hope to muster. How might they succeed despite these challenges? Beyond the obvious open questions around funding, the key will be connecting structural transformation of the national economy with tangible local improvements in people's daily lives, while remaining responsive to future uncertainties. The manifesto emphasises things like devolution, (improving) Local Growth Plans, community-owned energy, and growing the cooperative sector. This small scale stuff is great and much needed, but the hard bit is integrating this with large, slow moving scheme around national industrial policy, long-term RDI and so on. The former without the latter won't touch the sides, and the latter without the former risks losing popular buy-in by not being felt quickly enough on the ground and in the everyday. At Demos Helsinki we’ve previously discussed “the big how” of industrial and innovation policy. Let’s see if Labour can figure it out through a world in crisis…\n\nFor anyone interested in the new frontiers of labour organising and workers rights in the digital age, our colleagues at FEPS Europe are hosting what I'm sure will be an excellent discussion of \"The rise of algorithmic management, from platform economy to traditional sectors\". Moderated by the always incisive Gerard Rinse Oosterwijk and featuring some of leading academics on the topic (who I'm also privileged to be collaborating with on my own forthcoming work on the topic), this will be a great opportunity to dive deeper into one of the biggest challenges for labour in the modern era."
