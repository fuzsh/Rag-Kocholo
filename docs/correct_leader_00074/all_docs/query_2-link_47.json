        "text": "Common historical narratives of Finnish European policy emphasise the sudden and dramatic change of 1991–1995, when Finland, as a reaction to the collapse of the Soviet Union, rejected its previously cautious approach and wholeheartedly embraced the goal of joining a unified Europe. This article, however, shows that, already in the mid-1980s, the Finnish political and economic elites questioned the country's position in the Cold War order and took bold steps in order to forge closer relations with Western Europe. A key event was the struggle for membership in Eureka, a novel European project designed to enhance cooperation in high technology.\n\n2 The article is mainly based on archive sources from the Finnish Ministry for Foreign Affairs. The decision to join Eureka was prepared by a small circle of officials of the ministry and barely discussed within other institutions and government bodies. However, I also consulted a number of other Finnish archives (the Archive of the Ministry of Education and Culture, Helsinki; the Archive of the Ministry of Trade and Industry, Helsinki; Central Archives of Finnish Business Records, Mikkeli; The National Archives, Helsinki – the archive of the Finnish Business and Policy Forum, EVA, and the private papers of President Mauno Koivisto; Labour Archives in Finland, Helsinki – the private papers of former Prime Minister Kalevi Sorsa), and conducted several interviews with public officials involved in the process.\n\n6 For a general account on Finnish European policy, see Aunesluoma, Juhana, Vapaakaupan tiellä.

Even in the EFTA, in which they participated after 1961, around one year after its establishment, the Finns were sheltered by a specific construction called FINEFTA. Finland also declined the offer of the Marshall aid in 1947 and did not officially join the OEEC (OECD) until 1969. Membership in the Council of Europe was considered particularly sensitive and delayed until 1989.\n\n77 Hanhimäki, Jussi M., Scandinavia and the United States: An Insecure Friendship (New York: Twayne Publishers, 1997), 161Google Scholar–3. A dramatic example was the presidential elections of 1982 where the Kremlin failed to secure the victory of its preferred candidate, Ahti Karjalainen. I am thankful to Kimmo Rentola for this point."
