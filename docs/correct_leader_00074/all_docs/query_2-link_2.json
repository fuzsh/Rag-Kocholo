        "text": "President Mauno Koivisto said in his New Year's Speech that there has been no change for the better in the international political situation, and that nuclear armament continues on its course. Nor had the Madrid CSCE follow-up obtained the desired results in drafting the final document. On the other hand, the President believed that the great powers wilt endeavour to turn the trend into a more positive direction in the Geneva talks. Although the Nordic area has been the object of lively great power and military political interest, the situation here has remained stable. According to President Koivisto, the non-nuclear states of the areas have greatly contributed to this favourable state of affairs, and Finland for her part will continue making efforts towards the implementation of the Nordic nuclear-weapon-tree zone (NWFZ) in order to keep the situation stable. On the basis of her own clearly defined international status Finland will endeavour to promote peaceful solutions in wider international contexts. This is why Finland made great effort to contribute to the favourable conclusion of the Madrid CSCE follow-up conference.\n\nln an interview with the periodical Maailma ja me (1/83) Prime Minister Kalevi Sorsa emphasizes the importance of prolonging the Fenno-Soviet FCMA Treaty without amendments, because the development of the neighbourly relations between our countries has succeeded on the basis of the Treaty, despite increased international tensions. Discussions on the prolongation could start in the near future. Prime Minister Sorsa expressed his hope that the Soviet Union and the United States make rapid progress in the Geneva talks so that a new armament spiral in Europe could be prevented.\n\nForeign Minister Pär Stenbäck gave a talk at the Hämeenlinna Paasikivi Society on the impact of great power relations on the activity of the UN. According to him, the General Assembly reflects directly the state of the great power relations and any confrontations are increasingly reflected in the issues discussed in the UN. It would be indispensable to attain some kind of harmony in these relations for disarmament, regional conflicts and global questions to be solved. Minister Stenbäck is of the opinion that the status of the UN should be strengthened so that it could be used as a forum tor active cooperation more than before.\n\nIn an interview with Helsingin Sanomat Gen. Bernard W. Rogers, Commander-in-Chief of the NATO Forces in Europe, expressed his doubts about the preparedness of the Finns to defend their country. He said that the Finns might let Soviet troops violate their territorial integrity both on land and in the air, if these troops attacked NATO objects in Norway. Sen. Rogers considered the implementation of a Nordic nuclear-weapon-free zone impossible as long as disarmament cannot be agreed on.\n\nGen. Lauri Sutela, Commander of the Finnish Defence Forces, gave a statement on Gen. Rogers' view of the willingness of the Finns to defend their country. Gen. Sutela said that the statement reflects Gen. Rogers' private opinions and that it contains certain elements of Finlandization claims. According to Can. Sutela Finland will defend herself against any aggressor, but speculations about the aggressor being the Soviet Union are based on dated analyses of the situation, and are false. Foreign Minister Pär Stenbäck expressed his astonishment that Gen. Rogers sees it relevant to offer speculations which are obviously based on erroneous information about the Finnish neutrality and defence policies.\n\nNorwegian Minister of Defence Anders Sjaastad said that Norway is convinced that Finland is capable of repelling any aggression and repudiated Can. Rogers' doubts about Finnish neutrality.\n\nAn agreement on opening four new official border crossing points between Finland and Norway was approved by exchange of notes. According to the agreement, people living in the border regions can be granted permission to cross the border also elsewhere.\n\nMinister of Defence Juhani Saukkonen gave his view of the appointment of a fourth parliamentary defence committee suggested by Prime Minister Sorsa. Minister Saukkonen said that if a committee is deemed necessary, it could make a suggestion for defence spending in 1987—91. The committee should focus their efforts on issues which have not been extensively discussed and to cover a longer period than five years. The function of our Defence Forces is to prevent all military actions directed at Finland. If our own capability is insufficient, the FCMA Treaty offers different ways of strengthening our capability. In view of this makes speculations about our security political position and behaviour is redundant.\n\nDr Esko Antola wrote in the daily Kansan Uutiset that the trip made by Foreign Minister Pär Stenbäck to South America, especially his visit to Brazil, brought to light a new direction in our development cooperation policy which stresses trade and ‘normal relations' more than before. Antola said that the views Foreign Minister Stenbäck expressed on the parallel activities of Finland and Brazil for peace and disarmament do not hold water and referred to Brazilian activity with regard to e.g. nuclear arms policy, her relations with South Africa. When answering to the foreign affairs committee of the Parliament Foreign Minister Par Stenbäck considered his speeches in Brazil and Peru still justified and regarded Brazil as an important state, especially economically for Finland.\n\nDr Jan-Magnus Jansson, editor-in-chief of the daily Hufvudstadsbladet, discussed the president's strong position in Finland in a seminar organized by the Institute of Comparative Analysis of Political Systems (director: Maurice Duverg e r). The seminar's theme was ‘semi-presidential' regimes, and the regimes of France, Finland and Portugal were compared in this respect. According to Dr Jansson, the president of Finland does not have exceptionally great powers, although they have special significance in foreign policy leadership, in appointing the Cabinet and dissolving Parliament. It is only after the Second World War that the leadership of foreign policy has become a central part of the president's function.\n\nAt a lunch meeting with political journalists President Koivisto discussed the talk about Finlandization, which occasionally crops up in political debates abroad. In such connections Finland's position is used for purposes which have nothing to do with our country. Such talk reveals lack of knowledge about Finland and our policy of friendly relations with our neighbouring countries. For this reason it is to no avail to try to correct everyone; our neighbours have trust in the Finnish line.\n\nPrime Minister Kalevi Sorsa visited Paris, to attend a meeting of European Social Democrat prime ministers and the Disarmament Council of the Socialist International. In his address at the prime minister meeting he emphasized the central role of the SDPs in many European countries and the ensuing responsibility and these parties' endeavours to stimulate the world economy. At the SI Disarmament Council he said that the Geneva talks should obtain results before summer to prevent a new armament spiral. He also participated in a seminar organized by Professor Duverger. He gave a talk on the status of the prime minister in Finland and the power- political relations between the prime minister, president and parliament against the background of the 1919 constitution and the regime which has developed during independence. According to the constitution, the status of the prime minister is not very strong but it has grown stronger with the development of parliamentarianism and with social changes. Mr Sorsa met President François Mitterrand and Prime Minister Pierre Mauroy, with whom he discussed Fenno-French questions and relations in the European Community.\n\nFinland gave its response to the Swedish Government on the Swedish proposal of a nuclear-weapon- free corridor between the military alliances in Central Europe. In its response the Finnish Government expresses its hope that the initiative will lead to concrete and verifiable results although the implementation of the proposal lies in the first place with the countries either located in the area or otherwise responsible for the security of the area. The response underlines the importance of the Geneva talks for the goals of the Swedish proposal.\n\nIn a survey, 84 0/0 of Finns estimated that the CMA Treaty has a positive influence on Finland's international status (a year earlier the figure was 81 per cent). A positive attitude towards the FCMA treaty has grown among the supporters of all the four major parties. 93 % of those who answered considered the Finnish foreign policy as well managed.\n\nForeign Minister Pär Stenbäck was handed a petition opposing the establishment of a PLO office in Helsinki. The petition was signed by some 71000 person. The delegation expressed their concern about the possibility of inviting PLO Leader Yasser Arafat to Finland. This could lead to the establishment of a PLO office and to a \"recognition of certain degree” of the PLO. One of the signers of the petition was Minister of Culture Arvo Salo.\n\nPrime Minister Kalevi Sorsa attended the European Management Forum in Davos Switzerland. The participants were political and economic authorities from seven Western countries. Prime Minister Sorsa repeated the initiative for a strategy of a balanced economic growth put forward by Finland in OECD in November 1982. According to it, a closer cooperation in monetary and currency policy is essential. Economic aid given to the developing countries would also benefit the donators. According to Mr Sorsa, this activity should be coordinated by augmenting the resources of the IMF and World Bank.\n\nForeign Minister Pär Stenbäck gave a report on the Finnish development cooperation on the occasion of the beginning of the new three-year period of the Commission on economic relations with the developing countries (TALKE). According to him, the view presented by the Under Secretary of State Wilhelm Breitenstein that the interests of the Finnish export industry are involved in the development aid is not correct. The forms of development aid are determined by the needs of the cooperation partner and not by Finland's trade political interests, Minister Stenbäck said.\n\nThe Paasikivi Society organized a discussion on \"Nuclear War and Finland”. Mr Pertti Joenniemi, a special researcher at the Tampere Peace Research Institute spoke on \"Nuclear War in the Finnish Defence Doctrine”, and Mr Kauko Sipponen, Governor of the Province of Central Finland and Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee for Civil Defence, on \"Nuclear War and the Civil Defence”. According to Joenniemi, General Lauri Sutela, Commanding General of the National Defence Forces, had expressed new and different opinions on how to avoid a possible nuclear attack. Sutela said that a well-equipped army will prevent a military exploitation of our country and a possibility of Finland becoming the target of nuclear weapons. According to Joenniemi this approach would reduce the application of other alternatives, which is possible now in the approach taken by the Parliamentary Defence Committee (Paasikivi-Seuran monistesarja <Paasikivi Society mimeographs> n:o 35).\n\nParliament passed a new statute on aliens to improve the legal rights of foreigners in Finland. Its major amendment was the possibility given to foreigners to appeal against legal decisions and rules. It also makes it easier to renew a work permit.\n\nIn an interview with the periodical Maailma ja Me (the world and we) the Centre Party Chairman Paavo Väyrynen said that the FCMA Treaty will remain the basic document of the Fenno-Soviet relations and that it will be prolonged for a long time in the near future. Mr. Väyrynen said that the trust between Finland and the Soviet Union has not been affected by the changes in the highest leadership of both countries.\n\nMr Aarne Saarinen, former chairman of Finnish Communist Party (SKP), gave a talk on the primary objects of the Finnish defence policy. He said that, as a NATO member, Norway has bound herself to U.S. military policy and submitted herself to being a stepping stone in a possible NATO attack on the Soviet Union. This has not been sufficiently taken into account in the current Finnish defence policy, as it should, because such an attack could not take place without violating Finnish territorial integrity. Finland should officially propose a border peace agreement, and, if Norway still refuses, Finland should take action towards fortifying the defence of Northern Lapland.\n\nForeign Minister Pär Stenbäck commented Mr Saarinen's demand that Finland should propose a border peace agreement to Norway, saying that the previous proposal is still in force and there is no need for a new one. The issue has occasionally bean discussed with Norwegian officials, and Finland is prepared to discuss it, if Norwegians are willing, the Foreign Minister said.\n\nForeign Minister Stenbäck said that there is political consensus on raising the amount of the Finnish cooperation aid to 0.7 per cent of GNP by 1988. According to Minister Stenbäck, this will be tested in budget discussions. The percentage should be raised to 0.42 in the 1984 budget.\n\nThe 31st Session of the Nordic Council was held in Oslo. The chairman of the Finnish delegation, Mrs Elsi Hetemäki-Olander said in her address at the general session that on no grounds can security policy questions be discussed by the Council. On the other hand, a separate Nordic parliamentary seminar could be convened to discuss security policy and a Nordic nuclear- weapon-free zone (NWFZ). All the Nordic left-wing parties submitted for consideration by the session an appeal to that effect. Prime Minister Kalevi Sorsa suggested that the Council find out if it is possible to grant immigrants a inter-Nordic franchise in State elections independently of citizenship. The economic programme passed by the session proposes that the Nordic countries enter into cooperation with OECD, GATT and in the International Monetary Fund. The session passed a motion on referring to the Nordic Council of Ministers the task of drafting the programme for the development of inter-Nordic economy and employment. As regards the Nordic communication satellite Tele-X, the financing of the project was debated, although in principle, Finland, Sweden and Norway support the undertaking.\n\nAarne Saarinen reiterated his statement that Norway could be used as a starting point in an attack on the Soviet Union and that Finland would thus end up as Norway's enemy, whatever Prime Minister Wiltoch says.\n\nAccording to the Evening paper Iltalehti, Professor Raimo Väyrynen had said in a Pugwash meeting that the Paris Peace Treaty, the FCMA Treaty and the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons do not in theory or juridically prohibit the introduction into Finland of nuclear weapons owned by another state, if the Finnish Government endorses it. He had also said that this could be used in persuading Norway to accept the idea of a Nordic nuclear-weapon- free zone. According to the article Professor Väyrynen did not consider this possibility desirable, nor did he think this to be in the interests of the Soviet Union in a situation of an international crisis.\n\nThe Chairmen of the Finnish People's Democratic League, Kalevi Kivistö, suggested that the Finnish party leaders send a joint invitation to PLO leader Yasser Arafat to visit Finland. This would be the most prestigious group possible since no state organ is prepared to invite him. The PLO leader could visit Finland in the connection of his visit to the other Nordic countries.\n\nAccording to Under-Secretary of State Klaus Törnudd, the Paris Treaty, the FCMA Treaty and the Non-proliferation Treaty prohibit Finland from manufacturing or acquiring nuclear weapons. The treaties do not contain a clause prohibiting the stationing of other countries' nuclear weapons. Thus the statement made by Professor Väyrynen contains nothing new.\n\nForeign Minister Pär Stenbäck stated that the Finnish stand with regard to the introduction of nuclear weapons onto Finnish territory is clear and unchanged. In the Peace Treaty our country has contracted not to manufacture or acquire nuclear weapons, and on the basis of our policy of neutrality we refuse to accept such weapons on behalf of other states. According to the Foreign Minister, this kind of threatening pictures directed towards other countries, depicted by the Press, are to be discarded.\n\nJorma Hentilä, Secretary General of the Finnish People's Democratic League, commented on Mr Saarinen's demand for the fortification of the Finnish-Norwegian border saying that from the West, Finland is threatened by a nuclear attack, not by a conventional one. Such a threat cannot be encountered by conventional defence arrangements in border areas. We must reduce the threat of a nuclear war and detach Finland from great power nuclear strategies, which entails that the primary goal should be to increase political activity instead of resorting to military solutions, Mr Hentilä said.\n\nPresident Koivisto addressed Parliament on the closing of the 1982 session. He said that Finland will pursue her foreign policy and good neighbourly relations without resorting to such threatening pictures as have been painted in the Press. Political scientists' estimates and analyses of exceptional phenomena in international politics and of different countries' behaviour in various political situations have no great relevance in the search for different models. At their worst, they have the value of fortune tellers' predictions; research can, however, be used as an indicator in estimating future development. The President said that the initiatives made by Finland towards North European security are still in force.\n\nForeign Minister Pär Stenbäck said that the ideas presented by President Koivisto on replacing a border peace agreement by parallel political declarations does not mean that Finland had transferred the initiative to Norway. Finland will not make an official initiative on the matter. The issue had been discussed un-officially during President Koivisto's visit to Norway.\n\nThe N+N-States proposed in the Madrid follow-up meeting that the preparatory meeting for the Stockholm conference be held in Helsinki in October, to draw up the agenda and other rules of procedure to be followed at the disarmament conference.\n\nIn the parliamentary elections there were 3.9 million registered voters. The voting rate was 75.7 %. The seats were distributed as follows: non-socialist parties 114 seats (57.8 %), socialist parties 84 seats (40.7 %) and others 2 (1.5 °k. Seats won by individual parties were as follows: SDP 57 (26.7%) , the National Coalition Party (NCP) 44 (22.1 %), the Centre Party (CP) 38 (17.6%), the Finnish People's Democratic League (FPDL) 27 (14.0%) , the Rural Party (RP) 17 (9.7 %), the Swedish People's Party of Finland (SPP) 11 (4.9 %), the Christian League of Finland (CLF) 3 (3.0%), an independent coalition \"the Greens” 2 (1.5 %) and the Constitutional Party (CCP) 1 (0.4 %). The Rural Party was the big winner: from 7 to 17. The SDP also won new seats. \"The Greens” are newcomers in Parliamentary circles. The greatest loser was the FPDL.\n\nThe Soviet Ambassador to Finland, V.M. Sobolev, gave an interview to the Finnish daily Suomenmaa on the occasion of the 35th anniversary of the FCMA Treaty. He said that the Treaty has guaranteed the favourable and stable long-term development of Fenno-Soviet relations. As regards international affairs, the Treaty has contributed to the stable and peaceful situation prevailing the North of Europe independently of the international fluctuations. It has served as an example of the way in which two countries with different social systems can enter into flexible cooperation.\n\nPresident Koivisto gave an interview to the Finnish Broadcasting Corporations programme \"Näin naapurissa” (Life in the Neighbouring Country), in which he discussed the significance of the FCMA Treaty now and during the past 35 years. According to the President, the Treaty as a whole is successful and significant despite the fact that parts of it have been discussed on various occasions lately. At present, the only pertinent question to ask is when and for how long it will be prolonged. The FCMA Treaty requires that Finland has a defence capacity, which, however, is smaller than the one we would have to achieve without the Treaty. Finnish security can be guaranteed by other means than increasing military preparedness, President Koivisto said.\n\nAccording to a survey of Soviet and East European studies in Finland, such studies are few, which causes dependency on studies made in the West, which do not always fulfil the Finnish requirements of impartiality and objectivity. Consequently, Finnish research in this field should be supported. This could best be done within the existing academic institutions.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs appropriated 12.2 million FIM to bilateral development cooperation. The recipient countries of this donation are Burma, Sri Lanka and two different projects in Zambia.\n\nThe Parliamentary Civil Defence Committee submitted its report to Minister of Interior Matti Ahde. According to the report, the aim should be to be able to protect the whole population both from the dangers of conventional war and from radioactive fall-out. The latter presupposes sheltering also during a war between other states, which could cause a fall-out in our country. According to the Committee, a significant part of the population has no structural shelter, particularly in areas of sparse habitation. The plan presented two cases, in which people would have to stay in a shelter for two or three days. The committee did not discuss cases of long-time catastrophes. The implementation of the proposed plan would raise the costs of population protection from 200 to 300 million marks.\n\nPresident Koivisto, together with five other political leaders from neutral and non-aligned countries, appealed 10 all the CSCE countries for a successful conclusion of the Madrid follow-up meeting. This is indispensable in securing of the positive role of the CSCE for Europe also in the future. The draft for the final document proposed by the neutral and non-aligned (N+N) countries is a concrete proposal, which could be used in endeavouring to conclude this stage of the CSCE.\n\nPaavo Väyrynen, Chairman of the Centre Party, participated in a disarmament meeting organized by the Norwegian Venstre in Oslo. The meeting dealt with the situation in Europe. He concentrated in his speech on the deadlock in the disarmament talks, and he considered even a temporary solution better than a total failure. All possible means of advancing the negotiations should be considered even using a third party as a mediator.\n\nForeign Minister Pär Stenbäck considered the discussion on the exact date of the signing of the prolongation of the FCMA Treaty as premature, even though Finland supports prolonging the Treaty without amendments.\n\nPresident Mauno Koivisto, accompanied by Foreign Minister Par Stenbäck among others, paid an official visit to Denmark. President Koivisto met Queen Margareta, Prime Minister Poul Schluter and Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen. In his discussions with them President Koivisto explained the CSCE appeal made by him on April 18. According to him, the neutral and non-aligned countries have made all effort possible for speeding up the CSCE. Further development is up to the great powers and the alliances. The discussions also dealt with disarmament questions and the Denmark's role in the Nordic cooperation.\n\nThe Soviet Ambassador Vladimir Sobolev gave a talk at a Finland-Soviet Union Society in Mikkeli. He said that the regular communication between the leaders of the countries promote new views of the development of Fenno-Soviet cooperation. According to the Ambassador, the FCMA Treaty has preserved its relevance and has guaranteed good Fenno-Soviet relations regardless of fluctuations in the international situation.\n\nMinister of Defence Saukkonen emphasized the importance of implementing the proposals made by the Third Parliamentary Defence Committee. He spoke at the 20th anniversary celebrations of Maanpuolustajat ry (Defenders' Association) in Helsinki. According to Minister Saukkonen, Foreign policy is essential when implementing security policy objects, but a country situated between two military alliances cannot neglect its defence.\n\nIn the spring meeting of the Newspaper Union in Helsinki the editor-in-chief of the Swedish Aftonbladet and a foreign editor of the New York Times claimed that Finnish journalists were not critical enough in their reporting during the last years of President Kekkonen's era. The President's retirement and the news about the state of his health came as a surprise to Finns although the indications had been there for some time.\n\nA study made by the Tampere Peace Research Institute on the attitudes in the Finnish media towards the events in the 2nd Special Session on Disarmament of the UN General Assembly reveals that the reporting has been quite uniform in the media. The study covered eight dailies and part of the Finnish Broadcasting Corporation's radio and television news. Attitudes towards disarmament were positive and the reporting concentrated mainly on the activity of Finland and the two great powers. The attitude towards the peace movement was also positive although it was argued that the responsibility for decisions lies with the international disarmament community.\n\nThe Cabinet's Foreign Affairs Committee received a report from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs on submarine incidents in Swedish territorial waters and on the security political situation in the Nordic area. In its statement the Cabinet considered it important that the Nordic security political situation remain stable and outside great power tensions despite increased military interest in the area. According to the statement, vessels carrying nuclear warheads will be denied access to Finnish ports, and new regulations to be applied in case of violations of Finnish territorial waters are being prepared by the Ministry of Defence.\n\nA political statement published by the FPDL league council takes a positive view of the opening of a PLO information office in Helsinki but a negative view of Finland's confused manner of behaving in international organizations, e.g. by voting blank in the UN in the motion for a ban on first- use of nuclear arms. The Finnish development cooperation takes more into account the needs of exporting companies than those of the developing countries. The SKDL Council appeals to the Finnish Government to condemn the US intervention in Central America.\n\nIn connection with the peace happening \"The Spring of Peace and Hope” people formed a chain from the Finlandia House to the embassies of different CSCE countries. The embassies were handed a message opposing the stationing of new nuclear and cruise missiles in Europe and making an appeal for a Nordic nuclear-weapon-tree zone. According to the organizers some 30,000 people participated, but the estimate made by the police was as low as 15,000.\n\nPresident Koivisto gave a statement on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of President Kekkonen's plan for a Nordic nuclear- weapon-free zone. According to President Koivisto, the security political situation in the Nordic area is stable because of its nuclear-weapon-free status. However, this requires permanent confirmation and recognition from the nuclear powers; the basic idea of the proposal has become more and more urgent lately. President Koivisto thought it positive that there has been discussion of the NWFZ also in the other Nordic countries in recent years. (Nuclear Weapons and Northern Europe, p. 82).\n\nTass published President Koivisto's interview before his official visit to the Soviet Union. The President thought the visit significant because of the prolonging of the FCMA Treaty, which shows that no fluctuations in the international situation can affect the Fenno-Soviet cooperation. According to him, economic cooperation, like the one between Finland and the Soviet Union, is the best form of good neighbourly relations.\n\nPresident and Mrs Mauno Koivisto paid an official visit to the Soviet Union. The document prolonging the Fenno-Soviet FCMA Treaty until 2003 was signed by Foreign Minister Paavo Väyrynen and Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko on the first day of the visit. The President was also accompanied by Prime Minister Kalevi Sorsa and Minister of Foreign Trade Jermu Laine, who is the Vice Chairman of the Economic Cooperation Commission, Chairmen of the four biggest parties, representatives of the Finnish business and high officials. Foreign Ministers Jermu Lame and Nikolai Patolichev signed a Fenno-Soviet protocol on agriculture and food stuffs for 1984—90. According to statement published after the visit the FCMA Treaty will guarantee the continuity of Fenno-Soviet political and economic relations and will for its part contribute to the stable security political situation in the North of Europe. Both countries express their concern on increasing international tensions and the increasing possibility of a nuclear conflict.\n\nFinland presented orally to the Japanese State Department her disapproval of the statement made by Prime Minister Jasuhiro Nakasone on Finland's status. Prime Minister Nakasone had demanded in a campaign speech that Japan increase her defence spending, for otherwise Japan could find herself in the same situation as Finland, which, according to Nakasone, is at the mercy of the Soviet Union.\n\nThe Finnish Government appealed to the South African Government on behalf of three members of the African National Congress who had been condemned to death.\n\nA seminar on Finnish development aid was held in Espoo. The theme was \"What Kind of Development with Finnish Aid?”. It was attended by representatives of political parties, researchers and the media, non-governmental organizations and administration. In his address at the opening of the seminar, Foreign Minister Väyrynen said that line followed by Finland, i.e. to concentrate development aid on few projects is a good one. According to him, Finland should pay more attention to the follow-up and to consider increasing the share of agriculture. We should also make sure that the development aid given to a country promotes economic, social and political equality.\n\nRepresentatives of 132 countries participated in an international peace conference in Prague. Finland was represented by members of the Peace Committee of Finland and the Committee of the Hundred, representatives of the Central Organization of Finnish Trade Unions (SAK), the Workers' Athletic Union, and Speaker Erkki Pystynen and Minister Vappu Taipale. The official Finnish address was given by Pirkko Työläjärvi, the First Deputy Speaker of Parliament. She discussed the possibilities of the Conference of Security and Cooperation in Europe to recreate an atmosphere of confidence in Europe. Matti Kekkonen was elected one of the Vice Chairmen of the World Peace Council.\n\nThe Nordic Council of Ministers discussed the Nordsat project in Reykjavik. The Finnish representative was Gunnarsjf3rkstrand, Minister at the Ministry of Education.\n\nThe Nordic countries made a joint proposal in the UN for the strengthening of the status of the UN. In a report addressed to the Secretary General they recommend that the Security Council procedures be developed, the Secretary General be given more support, the Peacekeeping Forces be fortified and an emergency force be established. The report is based on the resolution passed by the Council of the Nordic Foreign Ministers in August.\n\nAccording to an agreement signed, the Fenno-Soviet trade is to be balanced by oil purchases to the value of over 200 million FIM so that by the end of the year the balance of the clearing account is within the credit limit of 300 million agreed on. 20.—23.9. The preparations for the Fenno-Soviet protocol of goods exchange were begun by a working group of the Joint Commission in Helsinki. The preparations for the frame agreement of the five-year period of 1986—90 are being under negotiated. Both negotiations aim at an increase in Finnish imports from the Soviet Union in order to maintain the present level of the trade. The Soviet delegation was headed by Minister Manzhub.\n\nThe periodical Ydin published a letter sent to the Student Union of the University of Turku by Ambassador Keijo Korhonen, a former chairman of the Board of the Student Union. In his letter Ambassador Korhonen expressed his negative view of a statement published by the present Board on the predicament of conscientious objectors who want to do non-combatant military service. According to the Ambassador conscientious objectors and their defenders are not fit to take the responsibility for the future of our country. The publication of the letter gave rise to a two-month long debate in the press. Helsingin Sanomat, for instance, received 225 letters to the editor on the issue, 75 of them were published.\n\nA frame agreement on fishing was signed between Finland and the EC in Brussels. According to the agreement, the parties can fish inside one another's fishing zones.\n\nLt-Gen. Jaakko Valtanen, Chief of the General Headquarters, was appointed new Commanding General of the Defence Forces. He resumed his new duties on October12 when his predecessor, Gen. Lauri Sutela retired. Lt-Gen. Valtanen said that the minimum level suggested by the Third Parliamentary Defence Committee has almost been attained. This cannot, however, be considered as build-up. The state of the Defence Force is excellent, according to the General, for, in spite of the political confrontations existing in different walks of life, all quarters have a realistic view of Finnish defence needs.\n\nYdin published a résumé of the reactions to Ambassador Korhonen’s letter of July 6. Its purpose was to give an overall picture of the attitude toward conscientious objectors’ military service on the basis of what had been written by columnists and in the published letters to the editor. The extremes were an absolute condemnation and a whole-hearted acceptance and endorsement. The most common view was to support non-combatant service in the case of \"real conviction” but to consider armed service as the primary alternative. According to Ydin, attitudes towards conscientious objectors are somewhat more favourable than in the late 1960s.\n\nAccording to Foreign Minister Väyrynen, Finnish development cooperation in 1983 was behind schedule made out. According to it, Finland was to raise her development aid to 0.7 % of the GNP by 1988. Minister Väyrynen said that two annual rises should be included in the budget in order to keep up with the schedule. He also said that follow-up and preparations should be made more efficient to eliminate such problems as have come up in the implementation of plans.\n\nThe four biggest parties and some civic organizations called loran increased political and humanitarian aid to the Namibian freedom organization Swapo on the Namibian freedom fight day, September 3.\n\nAccording to a statement published by the FCP political commission, the boycott against the Soviet Union is in conflict with Finland's basic foreign political line based on pacts, and demanded that the Council of State take action towards cancellation of the boycott.\n\nThe Finnish address at the UN Palestinian Session in Geneva was given by Finland's Permanent Representative, Mr Keijo Korhonen. He said that a solution in the Middle East question should be based on the UN Security Council resolutions on the matter. It is important to cooperate with the Palestinians when endeavouring to secure peace in the area.

The \"openness” the Nordic region leaves more room for new moves by the great powers than Central Europe.\n\nA statement published by the FPDL League Board drew attention to the growth of peace movements, which is an indication of people's negative attitude towards disarmament. Finland should not pursue an artificial balancing between the great power interests but to renounce nuclear weapons and nuclear disarmament.

Kari Möttölä, Director of the FIIA, said that the beginning of Koivisto's term of office has been characterized by a tension between expectations of continuity and expectations of change. Otherwise Koivisto has been on the same lines as Kekkonen was before the beginning of the era of detente.\n\nThe FCP political commission condemned the US attack into Grenada and demanded that foreign troops be withdrawn immediately.\n\nSome 200,000 people participated in the UN Disarmament Week peace marches. 65,000 People marched in Helsinki.

Mr Kalela said that the stands with regard to nuclear weapons which President Koivisto presented in New York and Los Angeles are a logical continuation of the nuclear weapon policy pursued by Finland since the early 1960s when President Kekkonen presented his idea of a Nordic NWFZ. According to Mr Kalela, President Koivisto touched upon the controversial doctrine of first use but did not take a stand in the doctrinal dispute existing within NATO, for instance.\n\nMr Kalela expounded his statement about President Koivisto‘s speeches. Mr Kalela said that the President had taken a stand for the banning of \"the use of nuclear weapons in all their forms”. This naturally also includes the first-use of nuclear weapons.\n\nForeign Minister Paavo Väyrynen gave his reply to a question put by Tuure Junnila, M.P. on Finland's voting for the Grenada Resolution. According to Mr Junnila this vote was not in accordance with the voting line Finland usually follows in the UN, having abstained in corresponding votes previously.

In the letter, which was not meant for publication, the President also said that the media should give their support to the foreign policy leadership.
