        "text": "The Channel-2 programme \"Ajankohtainen kakkonen” (a bi- weekly review of current affairs) dealt with Finnish foreign policy and interviewed Foreign Minister Paavo Väyrynen and Under-Secretary of State Keijo Korhonen. The Finnish foreign policy lines were criticized in the programme for being selfish, for seeking for national good by keeping aloof from the search for solutions to world and especially third world problems in the name of Finland's neutrality and small size. The programme gave rise to a lively discussion; it was criticized for its choice of means and its way of presenting the problem, but it was considered positive that it endeavoured to create discussion on the foreign policy lines.\n\nA disarmament forum of the world's youth arranged by the committee of the Finnish Youth Organizations (SNT) convened in Helsinki. There were participants from over 90 countries. In this greeting to the forum President Kekkonen expressed his concern about the accelerating arms race, the increased tension between the great powers and the increase in regional crises. On behalf of the Finnish Government the forum was addressed by Foreign Minister Paavo Väyrynen, The final act of the convention demanded a political solution to the Afghanistan crisis and guarantees of national security. As regards a total solution to the Middle East situation, the Palestinians are to have right to found a state of their own. The accelerating arms race also worried the participants and they demanded that SALT- 2 be implemented. It was considered important that the youth work for peace regardless of differences in political, ideological and religious points of view.\n\nThe chairmen of the Finnish Committee for Promoting Security in Europe handed a memorandum to Foreign Minister Paavo Väyrynen at the beginning of the second stage of the Madrid follow-up conference. According to it, changes in the strategic situation in Europe also affect the situation in Northern Europe. It was hoped that the follow-up conference reach an understanding about convening a conference on military detente and disarmament in Europe.\n\nAt the annual negotiations on the programmes for different development co-operation countries it was decided to grant 29 million marks in development aid to Sambia. This will be increased gradually in the future.\n\nThe 25th anniversary of the session of the Porkkala Lease-area back to Finland was celebrated in Kirkkonummi; Foreign Minister Paavo Väyrynen and the Soviet Ambassador to Finland V. M. Sobolev attended the celebrations. The significance of the cessation for promoting security in the Nordic region and in the world was stressed in the speeches held. The celebration was arranged by the Porkkala section of the Finland-Soviet Union Society and the surrounding communes.\n\nA document on cooperation in 1981—85 between the State Youth Council and the Soviet Commission on Youth Organizations was signed. Also Finnish and Soviet youth organizations signed a cooperation programme for the same period. This was the first of its kind and was signed by 38 Finnish nationwide organizations.\n\nThe US Ambassador to Finland, Mr James E. Goodby emphasized in an address to the Hämeenlinna Paasikivi Society that the US gives its support to a stable Nordic region. He considered the US foreign policy as consistent and stable which is emphatically seen in the relations with the Nordic countries.\n\nThe Finnish government, in a letter to the Palestinian Liberation Organization, considered it possible to establish \"a PLO political office” in Helsinki. According to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, this may consist of an information office like the one in Stockholm.\n\nAccording to Minister of Foreign Trade Esko Rekola Finnish industry must make provisions for adopting itself to the new situation created by an increasing import pressure from the developing countries. According to him, this is not a passing phase to be overcome by temporary protection measures but a long-term problem of adaptation. This view was put forth in a speech delivered at a conference on productivity in Helsinki.\n\nPresident Kekkonen stated in interview to \"Izvestia” that the way the term Finlandization has been used lately reveals the ignorance of its users of Finland's real status. The term has been used to give a distorted picture of the relations between Finland and the USSR, and there has been tendency to use it as a weapon in contexts that have nothing to do with Finland. The Final Act of the Helsinki CSCE will not lose its significance despite fluctuations in the international atmosphere. The Madrid CSCE follow-up conference should be able to come up with concrete measures for the implementation of the Helsinki Final Act. He further stated that it would be important to resume the talks on disarmament in Europe.\n\nIn an interview to the Finnish periodical \"Seura”, Ahti Karialainen, acting governor of the Bank of Finland, stated that the so-called Popular Front does not have exclusive rights on the presidential issue. He stressed that the presidential election was to a great extent a question of foreign policy lines. As regards the recent discussion on foreign policy, Mr Karialainen said that Finland alone can look after her own interests, Foreign political \"neorealism” and \"social biology”, are terms that mean nothing to the public, he said and added that discussion has risen recently to quite a theoretical level.\n\nThe Norwegian daily \"Aftenposten” published an interview with Prime Minister Mauno Koivisto. According to him, Norway has striven to adapt her foreign political solutions within the bounds of her possibilities in order to avoid friction between the Nordic countries. Finns follow the Norwegian discussion on the Nordic nuclear-weapons-free zone with interest and see it as useful, but there is no need for Finns to take part in it.\n\nLieutenant-General Aimo Pajunen gave an interview to \"Me”, the magazine of the progressive cooperative movement. The interview created a minor sensation by what was said about Norway. According to Pajunen, the advance storage of US arms in Norway in an international atmosphere which is already strained is not suitable action from the part of a small nation. In situations like the present one, small nations should strive to remain outside superpower conflicts, according to him.\n\nThe Third Parliamentary Defence Committee submitted its report to Minister of Defence Lasse Äikäs. The report suggests that some 17.5 billion marks be spent on military defence in 1982—86. The share of defence spending in the whole budget would then be 1.5 percent and of state spending over 5 percent. The real growth of the defence spending would be 3.8 percent.During the five-year period in question, priority is to be given to the development of the ground forces and the aim should be to create fast deployment force of 250,000 men. The report notes that the international security-political situation has become more tense and that the strategic-political significance of Northern Europe has grown, although the internal situation in that area has not changed.\n\nThe primary instrument of Finnish security policy is foreign policy consisting of an active and peace- orientated policy of neutrality on the basis of the FCMA-Treaty, relations based on trust with all the neighbouring and other countries and a resolve to remain outside superpower conflicts.\n\nAs regards the FCMA-Treaty, the Committee followed fairly closely the lines introduced by he two former committees. According to the report, the Treaty strengthens Finland's security and stipulates that Finland has the primary responsibility to defend their territorial integrity. Within the framework of the FCMA-Treaty we can reinforce our defence after a military aggression has taken place or when the threat of an aggression has been mutually confirmed.\n\nThe chairman of the 3rd Defence Committee, Jan-Magnus Jansson, expounded the work of the Committee in Paasikivi Society. According to Mr Jansson, the final conclusions in the report as regards the FCMA Treaty do not essentially diverge from the lines taken by the two former Committees.\n\nA Nordic agreement on social security and a cooperation agreement on Nordic development cooperation were signed.\n\nThe Finnish Communist Party considered it positive that the Third Parliamentary Defence Committee did not diverge in its interpretation from the lines taken by the former committees but did not accept the interpretations which narrow down the field of application of the military articles in a way which is detrimental for the security of our country. The FCP further considered that there are no grounds for increasing the armament spending either on security-political or national economic grounds.\n\nAn unofficial activity for drafting the final act. The neutral and non-aligned countries offered to act as coordinators in the handling of different issues. Finland and Sweden together will coordinate the security policy section.\n\nThe Finnish representative in the Disarmament Committee in Geneva stressed the significance of safety guarantees for the non-nuclear states and zones. An attempt is being made to reach an agreement that would bind the nuclear weapon states.\n\nForeign Minister Paavo Väyrynen spoke at a seminar on the problems of the least developed countries and on the UN Special conference on the same issue. Väyrynen said that Finns must find the political will to increase the development aid to 0.32 percent of the GNP in 1982 as promised and to 0.7 percent of the GNP by 1988.\n\nPresident Kekkonen granted interview to the Finnish news agency STT on the present state of the CSCE and interpretation of the FCMA-Treaty. The CSCE follow-up, according to the President, demands of the participants an especially great desire for cooperation to safeguard the continuance of the detente process. The FCMA-Treaty has not lost any of its functional capacity despite the fact that it was concluded over 30 years ago. According to President Kekkonen, it helps Finland to secure her position to a great extent regardless of international tensions. The Treaty aims at keeping peace by creating of Finland and its environs a region that remains outside strategic calculations and international conflicts.\n\nThe Disarmament Council of the Socialist International convened in Helsinki with Kalevi Sorsa as Chairman. The Council prepared a memorandum of issues related with disarmament for the SI party leader conference of the 29th of April.\n\nThe 33rd anniversary of the Treaty of Friendship, Co-operation and mutual Aid:\n\n— President Urho Kekkonen sent a telegram to the Soviet Party Leader and President Leonid Brezhnev on the occasion of the 33rd anniversary. He stressed the permanent meaning of the Treaty for the relations between our countries and noted its significance in promoting material and spiritual interaction.\n\n— President Leonid Brezhnev's telegram to President Kekkonen noted President Kekkonen's contribution to the management of the Fenno-Soviet relations and expressed confidence that the relations will continue good also in the future.\n\nIn addressing a FCMA-seminar arranged by the Centre Party, Ahti Karjalainen, acting governor of the Bank of Finland, expressed his satisfaction of the development of the Fenno-Soviet trade, for with a regression in the Western export the significance of the export to the Soviet Union has grown.\n\nThe 33rd anniversary of the FCMA-Treaty was celebrated in Helsinki; the Soviet delegation was led by Vice-Minister of Interior B. Shumilin. He considered the long-term economic, commercial, and scientific-technical programme until 1995 as a significant proof of the functional usefulness of the FCMA-Treaty. Minister of Education Par Stenbäck noted in his speech that attitudes towards the Treaty in Finland are established and positive.\n\nThe Social Democrat daily, \"Suomen Sosiaalidemokraatti” reviewed Osmo Apunen's book \"Paasikiven'Kekkosen linja” (the Paasikivi-Kekkonen Line) published in the USSR with an introduction by Yuri Komissarov. According to Komissarov, Apunen examines the Paasikivi-Kekkonen line in a wide inter- national context taking both internal and external factors into account. On the other hand, the Russian introduction notes, the Soviet Union does not agree with all Apunen's interpretations of the Finnish policy of neutrality. According to Komissarov, the most important part of the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Aid consists of the military-political articles, in which Finland contracts not to take part in an attack against the Soviet Union and, under some conditions, also to repel such an attack in cooperation with the Soviet Union. Finnish conservatives tend to interpret the Treaty so that Finland strives to keep completely neutral under all circumstances. This, according to Komissarov, is against the general spirit of the Treaty.\n\nAccording to an opinion poll commissioned by \"Ilta-Sanomat”, a Finnish daily, 75 percent of Finns estimated Finnish foreign policy to have been conducted well or very well. Some 40 percent of those inter- viewed considered Finland's prestige to have grown in the world during recent years.\n\nThe Press commented on Minister Väyrynen's negative attitude towards discussion on the presidential elections and stated that it is important that the matter be discussed, so that opinions on the issue become public.\n\n\"Ydin”, a magazine published by the Finnish Peace Movement, dealt in its 2/1981 issue with the discussion on the FCMA-Treaty raised by the 3rd Parliamentary Defence Committee. The article noted that Keijo Korhonen's view would have meant lessening of the overall significance for security of the Treaty so that political negotiations in solving crisis would have been given less importance and the measures meant in the treaty would be resorted to only after an aggression has taken place, which would have restricted Finland's choice.\n\nGeneral Lauri Sutela, Commander-in-Chief of the Defence Forces, gave a speech at the 20th anniversary of the Society for the Defence Academy in Helsinki. According to him, Finland's territorial integrity is no longer absolute during a time of war, which is due to the development in arms technology and the deterioration of the global situation. On the other hand, the security political position of the Nordic region remains stable to the benefit of all concerned, which in turn counterbalances the global situation.\n\nThe Finnish CSCE delegation expressed concern about the work method accepted, because it may lead to a summary final act like the one accepted in the Belgrade conference. According to the Finnish delegation, the conference should aim at accepting new follow-up measures on the basis of the Helsinki Final Act.\n\nThe party Congress of the National Coalition Party was held in Helsinki. Representatives from other European Conservative parties, e.g. from Sweden, Norway, Austria and England, took part in the meeting. In the programme of principles accepted by the congress, the NCP gives its support to the active and peace-oriented policy of neutrality of the Paasikivi-Kekkonen line. The FCMA-Treaty is a fundamental document in Finland's foreign policy and stabilizes Finland's international status. The NCP supports extension of the treaty before the end of the decade, According to the Coalition Party, Nordic cooperation is another important field of foreign political cooperation. Finnish foreign policy should support endeavours to get the disarmament talks started again and to get the Madrid CSCE follow- up conference to a favourable conclusion.\n\nThe Finnish Communist Party held its 19th conference of representatives in Helsinki. The conference was attended by a delegation from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, led by G.V. Romanov, member of the CPSU political commission and secretary of the Leningrad regional committee, and by representatives from the Communist parties of 23 other, both Socialist and Capitalist countries. According to the opinions expressed at the conference, the most difficult international problems are the possibility of a nuclear war, detente and the promotion of disarmament as well as the prevention of a technological and ecological catastrophe. As regards the presidential elections, the most important thing is to ensure the continuance of Urho Kekkonen's work in the form of a peace-orientated foreign policy on the basis of the FCMATreaty. It was noted that the Communists, Social Democrats and the Centre do not have a common, self- evident candidate, but the parties could agree on common principles to be applied in the election of the president. The Communist Party rejected those interpretations of the FCMA-Treaty that dissociate Finland from the cooperation stipulated in the Treaty.\n\nThe Finnish Social Democratic Party held its 32th party congress in Pori. Guests from 20 countries' Social Democratic parties took part in the congress, among them Olof Palme from the Swedish SDP and the vice-chairman of the SDP of the German Federal Republic, Hans-Jürgen Wischnewski.\n\nAccording to the foreign political document published, the party strives at working for detente and disarmament against the present accelerating armament as well as for bettering living conditions in the underdeveloped countries. The Finnish foreign policy rests on the good relations with the Soviet Union based on the FCMA-Treaty and with the Nordic countries. The Finland's development aid must be raised to 0.7 per-cent of the GNP before 1987. According to the defence political programme approved, foreign policy is the main instrument of defence policy. The development of the defence forces should be in proportion to the satisfaction of other needs and the real value of the defence spending should be kept on the present level. The domestic acquisitions of the defence forces should not lead to arms export. Also five statements on international politics were issued.\n\nThe Central Organization of the Finnish Trade Unions (SAK) condemns President Reagan's decision to begin producing and storing neutron bombs. It will increase tension in Europe and lower for its part the threshold of nuclear war in the whole world.\n\nThe Finnish government published a statement on the US decision on the production of neutron weapons. According to it, the decision may accelerate the arms race between the great powers and puts the efforts for disarmament in a questionable light. The Finnish government appeals to all the parties concerned to break the vicious circle of the arms race.\n\nThe Iraqi State Construction Organization made a 600 million mark deal with the Finnish Perasto work-conglomerate on the construction of multi-use houses and public buildings.\n\nA UN conference on the problems of the least developed countries was held in Paris. Wilhelm Breitenstein, leader of the Finnish delegation, stressed the meaning to the under-developed countries of concrete aid given by all the countries in the world. As regards Finland, he reaffirmed that Finland will raise her development aid to 0.7 percent of the GNP during the latter half of the decade and will aim at directing at least 30 percent of it to the least developed countries.\n\nKalevi Sorsa refuted the claims that Mauno Koivisto's relations with the East were not good and stated that these relations were in good shape and no distinction could be made between different persons in this respect. Mr Sorsa recalled that he had suggested over a year ago that initiatives be taken by Finland in the extension of the FCMA-Treaty, but that Foreign Minister Paavo Väyrynen had rejected the suggestion. Mr Väyrynen had put forward his own opinion that the Treaty will be extended when the issue becomes actual.\n\nThe annual UNESCO Prize of Education was shared this year by Helena Kekkonen, a Finnish lic.tech., who is the secretary general of the co-operation organization of the Free Cultural Work, and the International Scout Movement.\n\nThe Administrative Board of the Centre Party issued a statement according to which it is not proper at this stage to have a public discussion on the person of President Kekkonen's successor. On the other hand, the principles on the basis of which the successor will be elected should be discussed. In the Centre Party view, most emphasis in the presidential election should be put on the management of foreign policy, and the person elected should be the best in this respect.\n\nOn the occasion of the UN Disarmament Week: — The League Board of the Finnish People's Democratic League gave a statement in which it considered positive the participation of ever wider circles of citizens in the activities related to the week. The statement also stressed the importance of teaching peace work and internationalism and demanded that these subjects be introduced into the curriculum of different educational institutions.-The parliamentary group of the Centre Party published a statement according to which the recent discussion on the Nordic nuclear-weapon-free zone had advanced the issue and the realization of the issue should not be delayed by tying it up with other European disarmament questions, although it does have connections with the general situation in Europe.\n\nPresident Kekkonen announced that he will resign the presidential duties permanently because of ill health. The Cabinet appointed Prime Minister Mauno Koivisto to take care of the presidential duties and decided that the election of the council of electors is to take place on January 17—18 1982 and the new president will be elected on the 26th of January.In statements given on the President's resignation, representatives of the Government and of various parties emphasized his achievements in strengthening the foreign political status of Finland and in building national unity.\n\nThe Madrid Conference convened after the adjournment. No clearly positive results could be reached on the basis of the summer- autumn negotiations yielded. The final act was supposed to be ready by Christmas.\n\nPrime Minister Mauno Koivisto gave an interview to \"Westdeutcher Rundfunk” (FRG). He said that according to the FCMA-Treaty Finland will defend her own territory if she is attacked. The eventual need for help in such a situation will be agreed on in negotiations between the contracting parties. The realization of a nuclear-free zone in the Nordic region depends on how the Nordic countries come to terms on the basis of each country’s own point of departure. He stressed, however, the significance of the nuclear states’ attitude towards the realization of the issue.\n\nThe Finnish co-operative Metex signed a 300 million mark deal with the Soviet V/O Machinoimport. The deal covers deliveries of pumping station buildings on the gas pipeline from Siberia to Western Europe.\n\nJohannes Virolainen, a contender for the Centre Party presidential nomination, held a speech on his foreign policy lines. According to him, Finland's present international status is good despite the increasing tension in the world. This is President Kekkonen's most important achievement and is based on Paasikivi's activity during his presidency and on a creative implementation of the FCMA-Treaty. The Treaty has enabled us to create relations based on trust with the East without forgetting our Nordic neighbours. In Virolainen's opinion, political integration is not a suitable solution for Finland under any circumstances, but activity for flexible foreign trade policy should neither be forgotten.\n\nFinland and Malaysia signed a treaty on economic and technical cooperation in Kuala Lumpur.\n\nPresident Urho Kekkonen sent a personal telegram to President Leonid Brezhnev and thanked for his greeting and assured that the good relations between the two countries will continue. He also congratulated on the anniversary of the October Revolution. Also acting President Mauno Koivisto sent a congratulating telegram to President Brezhnev on the occasion of the anniversary.\n\nThe Nordic ministers responsible for regional policy convened in Helsinki. The Finnish representative was the acting Prime Minister, Minister of the Interior Eino Uusitalo. It was decided to develop co-operation in regional policy on the basis of the existing activity programme and to pay special attention to those regions that are at a disadvantage: the North Cap Area, the Faroe Islands and Iceland.\n\nAccording to Under-Secretary of State Keijo Korhonen, Finland will not interfere in the submarine conflict between Sweden and the Soviet Union. He, however, considered the incident deplorable.\n\nThe Party Council of the Social Democratic Party nominated Prime Minister Mauno Koivisto for the presidency.\n\nAhti Karjalainen stated in a speech on foreign policy that in facing the new challenges of international politics Finland needs an experienced head of state and denied the claims according to which the most important decisions in Finnish foreign and security policies have already been made. According to Mr Karjalainen, future problems will be more global than before and the new president must be able to adapt Finland's traditional active line of policy to this framework.\n\nOn accepting the SDP candidacy, Prime Minister Mauno Koivisto noted that Finland's international status is more stable than ever before in our history. The FCMA-Treaty has made enabled many-sided cooperation with the Soviet Union and will provide a basis for strengthening good neighbourliness in the future. At the same time we have close ties with the Nordic countries and the relations with other countries are in good shape. Mr. Koivisto considered armament and the great number of arms as well as the decreased possibilities of continuous economic growth as the immediate global problems. According to him, the application of the active and peace-orientated policy of the Paasikivi-Kekkonen line is difficult in the present world.\n\nPravda presented Dr Kekkonen's presidency and noted that the responsibility for continuing his foreign policy lines will rest on those who have supported him, which applies to the Centre Party in particular when they choose their candidate on the 22nd of November.\n\nThe Finnish Government made a decision to participate in the first phase of the Nordsat project, which consists of a two-year planning. The decision to take part in the actual project will be made only after this.\n\nA visa exemption agreement with Andorra.\n\nThe Centre Party held its party congress in Kuopio. D.Sc. Johannes Virolainen was nominated as the party's presidential candidate after election. The election was preceded by a lively discussion in which Dr Virolainen's foreign political ability and experience were questioned on the basis of a letter written by President Kekkonen two years earlier. The party leaders and the party committee had earlier given their support to Ahti Karjalainen by appealing to his foreign political experience. After his nomination Mr. Virolainen stressed the importance of foreign policy in the presidential duties and stated that the relations between Finland and the Soviet Union require continuous work and mutual trust also in the future to secure the achievements already gained.\n\nThe Finnish Communist Party published a proclamation on foreign policy according to which there is tendency in Finland to change our country's status internationally in the name of the so-called policy of neutrality. The FCP states that the FCMA-Treaty does not only have bearing on Fenno-Soviet relations but it is the basis for Finland's whole foreign policy and its active development. Finnish foreign policy must be consistent and active peace policy.\n\nThe Christian League candidate, Mr. Westerholm said that the solution to the Middle East problem can be found on the basis of UN resolutions 242 and 338. According to him, these do not presuppose that Israel withdraw from the regions occupied in 1967. Mr Westerholm emphasized that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel.\n\nProfessor Jan Magnus Jansson, presidential candidate of the Swedish People's Party, stated in Oulu that Finland can hardly gain any results in the Madrid CSCE follow-up conference by new initiatives in addition to those it has already presented if the great power relations remain tense or grow more tense. Finland must concentrate on the fundamentals of her foreign policy, that is, on good bilateral relations above all with her neighbours the Soviet Union and Sweden. At the same time we must keep contact with the Soviet Union and other countries and seek common viewpoints that make new initiatives for detente possible.\n\nKalevi Kivistö, chairman of the Finnish People's Democratic League, in an interview granted to the periodical \"Me”, criticized officials in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs for pursuing a passive, withdrawing policy of neutrality instead of an active foreign policy. According to him, the articles of the FCMA-Treaty can be stressed in different ways depending on what value the Treaty is given as the basic document of Finnish foreign policy. According to Mr. Kivistö, the Centre Party considers it to regulate only relations between Finland and the Soviet Union, whereas the Left sees that the Treaty forms a framework for the whole Finnish policy of neutrality.\n\nThe document on the exchange of goods between Finland and the Soviet Union for 1982 was signed. The signers were Ministers of Foreign Trade Nikolai Patolichev from the Soviet Union and Esko Rekola from Finland. The Fenno-Soviet trade will be 31 billion marks according to the agreement, Import of raw oil, machinery and equipment from the Soviet Union will increase and products of the metal industries will constitute about half of the Finnish export.\n\nThe Parliament sanctioned in the 1982 budget the amount of 720 million marks for development aid, which is the intermediary goal of 0.32 percent of the GNP. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs drafted a principle decision for the Government; according to it development aid would reach the goal of 0.7 percent of the GNP in 1988. Foreign Minister Paavo Väyrynen referred in a speech to the carrier situation and the salary level of those working at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. These, according to him, do not correspond to the level of other branches of administration, which is why the Ministry does not have at its disposal the best possible personnel, who seek themselves to other fields. This is not favourable for our foreign policy.\n\nThe political committee of the Finnish Communist Party published a statement on the Polish situation. According to it, the political solution to the problem is a solely Polish concern and all outside intervention is to be condemned. The FCP understands the actions taken by the military leadership and stated that the state of war ensures possibilities for solving the problems.\n\nThe neutral and non-aligned CSCE countries submitted a draft for a final act to the consideration of the Madrid CSCE follow-up conference. The draft made by the Finnish delegation was a comprehensive document and contained also the problematic human rights questions and measures for promoting trust.\n\nActing President Mauno Koivisto said in an event arranged by the Labour Movement Peace Forum in Stockholm that Finns are largely unanimous about the advantages of the foreign policy realized by President Kekkonen. According to Mr. Koivisto a great majority of citizens support its continuance also in the future and other states rely on that. Mr. Koivisto expressed his concern about the Polish situation, but stated that it is mainly Poland's internal affair.\n\nForeign Minister Paavo Väyrynen stated after the 36th session of the UN General Assembly that it had been characterized by controversies and opposing views on the East- West relations. Positive, according to him, was the beginning of the talks on Euromissiles in Geneva and the preparations made for the second disarmament session of the UN General Assembly in June/July.\n\nThe Christian League presidential candidate Raino Westerholm thinks that the Israel decision to add the Golan Hills to its territory must be seen in the light of the country's safety, although it was not wise because of the one-sidedness of the decision. He also saw that The UN Security Council acted against its own former resolution in condemning the Israeli decision.\n\nThe delegation of the Central Organization of Finnish Trade Unions published a statement on the election of the Council of Presidential Electors. The COFTU gives its support to the Paasikivi-Kekkonen line and appreciates President Kekkonen's work in its creation. The elections involve a question of continuing and developing the active and peace-orientated policy of neutrality on the basis of the FCMA-Treaty.\n\nSpeaker Johannes Virolainen visited Stockholm on a campaign tour. He spoke about the language and school issues concerning the Finns in Sweden and about living conditions in Finland and Sweden. Mr. Virolainen met the Swedish Prime Minister Thorbjörn Fälldin and representatives of the Swedish Centre Party.\n\nThe Swedish-speaking editorial staff of the Finnish Broadcasting Corporation had invited all eight presidential candidates to an electoral debate. The candidates refuted the claim that foreign political discussion were the prerogative of a small inside clique and constrained repetition of the same things. They claimed that the basic facts of foreign policy must be stressed. The candidates also agreed that Finland must show restrain in commenting on such events as the Polish situation or the submarine incident in the Swedish coastal waters, because they do not have bearing on the Finns."
