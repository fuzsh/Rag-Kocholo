The cabinet's Prime Minister was Kalevi Sorsa. The cabinet was in office from 4 September 1972 to 13 June 1975.[1]\n\nPresident Urho Kekkonen dissolved the government and the Parliament on 13 June 1975 and called a new parliamentary election during the same year.\n\nThe Sorsa Cabinet started its term during a time of economic growth for Finland. This allowed the government to make social reforms to pension and public health. The Sorsa government made plans for investments to industry, including those relating to the Loviisa Nuclear Power Plant. Due to the financial issues caused by the 1973 Middle East Oil Crisis, these plans were delayed. The government also had to control foreign capital exchange.[citation needed]\n\nMinisters\n\n[edit]\n\nPortfolio Minister Took office Left office Party Prime Minister4 September 197213 June 1975SDP Deputy Prime Minister4 September 197213 June 1975Centre Minister of Foreign Affairs4 September 197213 June 1975Centre Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs\n\nJussi Linnamo\n\n4 September 19725 May 1973SDP\n\nJermu Laine\n\n5 May 197313 June 1975SDP Minister of Justice4 September 197213 June 1975SDP Minister of the Interior\n\nHeikki Tuominen\n\n4 September 197213 June 1975Independent Minister of Defence4 September 197230 September 1974RKP1 October 19743 June 1975RKP Minister of Finance4 September 197213 June 1975Centre Deputy Minister of Finance\n\nEsko Niskanen\n\n4 September 197230 September 1974SDP\n\nHeikki Tuominen\n\n30 September 197413 June 1975Independent Minister of Justice4 September 197231 May 1974SDP\n\nVarma Kallio\n\n1 June 19749 September 1974SDP9 September 197413 June 1975SDP Minister of Agriculture and Forestry14 September 197231 July 1973Centre\n\nHeimo Linna\n\n1 August 197313 June 1975Centre Minister of Trade and Industry4 September 197231 December 1972RKP1 January 197330 September 1974RKP\n\nKristian Gestrin\n\n1 October 197413 June 1975RKP Minister of Social Affairs\n\nSeija Karkinen\n\n4 September 197213 June 1975SDP Minister of Transport and Communications4 September 197213 June 1975Liberals Minister of Labour\n\nValde Nevalainen\n\n4 September 197213 June 1975SDP Deputy Minister of Social Affairs4 September 197220 January 1975Centre\n\nReino Karpola\n\n7 February 197513 June 1975Centre Deputy Minister of Trade and Industry and Foreign Trade\n\nJussi Linnamo\n\n4 September 19725 May 1973SDP\n\nJermu Laine\n\n5 May 197313 June 1975SDP Deputy Minister of Education\n\nMarjatta Väänänen\n\n4 September 197213 June 1975Centre Deputy Minister of Finance\n\nEsko Niskanen\n\n4 September 197213 June 1975SDP\n\nPreceded by Cabinet of Finland\n\n4 September 1972 – 13 June 1975 Succeeded by"
