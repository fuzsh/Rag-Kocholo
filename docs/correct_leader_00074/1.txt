Kalevi Sorsa was Finlandâ€™s longest serving prime minister.

Allegation

Finnish former diplomat Alpo Rusi alleged that Kalevi Sorsa is on a secret list of 18 high-profile Finns with links to the Stasi, East Germany's intellgence agency.

West German intelligence handed the file to its Finnish counterpart in 1990, but the Finnish Supreme Court ruled that the list must not be made public.[1]
