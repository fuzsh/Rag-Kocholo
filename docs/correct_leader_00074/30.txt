On Saturday, Vanhanen surpasses former President Mauno Koivisto (Centre) for time served in office as premier, with 1,762 days. At 52, Vanhanen becomes the fourth-longest serving prime minister in Finnish history.

The longest incumbency by far was that of the Social Democratic Party's Kalevi Sorsa (3,652 days), followed by his SDP colleague Paavo Lipponen (2,927 days) and Urho Kekkonen, who later became president (1,826 days). Kekkonen, who represented the Agrarian Party (now Centre Party), also served as Foreign Minister during part of his time as premier.

Koivisto served two terms as prime minister, between 1968-1970 and 1979 to 1982, when he took over as president following Kekkonen's illness.

Vanhanen, a former journalist and Defence Minister, took over the office in June 2003 after his Centre Party colleague Anneli Jäätteenmäki resigned amid a scandal over leaked documents.
