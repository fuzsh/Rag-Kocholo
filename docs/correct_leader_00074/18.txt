The escalating situation in the Middle East has led to an unprecedented flow of refugees and migrants to Europe. The EU as a whole and member states individually were caught unprepared, even though the emergency situation was not entirely unpredictable. Europe urgently needs to find comprehensive solutions to the refugee crisis, both on the European and national levels as it pertains to frontier and aid policies as well as integrating migrants into local societies. The seminar organized jointly by the Foundation for European Progressive Studies (FEPS) and Kalevi Sorsa Foundation focuses on the following questions: How have different countries dealt with the situation? What should the European policy solutions be?
