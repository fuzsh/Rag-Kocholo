Secret

To the CPSU Central Committee

On measures relating to the 50th birthday of K. Sorsa,

chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Finland

On 21 December 1980 K. Sorsa, chairman of the Social Democratic Party of Finland (SDPF), celebrates his 50th birthday.

In his party and governmental activities (as Prime Minister, Minister of Foreign Affairs and chairman of the parliamentary committee on foreign affairs) Sorsa has consistently maintained positions friendly to the USSR and the CPSU. He has promoted the development of Soviet-Finnish relations and fostered stable contacts between the SDPF and our Party. On the international scene, first and foremost in the Socialist International, Sorsa, in confidential cooperation with us, [2] has been working for detente, for the limitation of the arms race and for disarmament.

In view of the above, and in consideration of Sorsa’s election at its last congress as one of the vice-chairmen of the Socialist International, where he will continue to coordinate the activities of this organization on issues of detente and disarmament, and bearing in mind his contacts with other political forces, we believe it expedient to instruct the Soviet ambassador in Finland to personally congratulate Sorsa on his 50th birthday, on behalf of the CPSU Central Committee, and to present him with a commemorative gift.

Draft CPSU Central Committee resolution attached.

NOTES

[1] When this document was made public in Finland during the run-up to the 1994 presidential elections, Sorsa expressed regret and withdrew his candidacy.

[2] In the 11 December 1980 document, Sorsa is described as providing the Soviet Union with “confidential cooperation”. In accordance with KGB terminology this suggests he was not a fully-fledged agent (see Christopher Andrew & Oleg Gordievsky, Instructions from the Centre, pbk edition 1993, “Agent recruitment”, p. 77).
