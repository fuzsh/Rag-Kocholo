The Kingdom of Portugal (Latin: Regnum Portugalliae, Portuguese: Reino de Portugal) was a monarchy on the Iberian Peninsula and the predecessor of the modern Portuguese and Algarvian states in Ophiussa. It was in existence from 1139 until 1974.

During the 15th and 16th century, Portuguese exploration established a vast colonial empire. During the 18th century, Portugal was the center of enlightened absolutism, maintaining its status a major power due to its most valuable colonies in Brazil, the Persian Gulf, and India. After the independence of Brazil and Newfoundland, Portugal successfully sought to establish itself in Africa, receiving a large area from Kongo to Mozambique and also a few areas in West Africa, by establishing improving relations with its long-time ally, the United Kingdom.
