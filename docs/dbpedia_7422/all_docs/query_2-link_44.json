        "text": "João V (r. 1706-1750) became king when Kangxi was at the height of his power. At that time China had been pacified and subjected to Manchu domination, its frontiers established, its external threats neutralized. When the Portuguese king died, Qianlong, grandson of Kangxi, was about to embark on a political campaign to extend the Qing dynasty's already vast power still further and turn it into one of the largest ever territorial empires.Interests associated with the presence of a Portuguese and Luso-Asian community in Macao, and the work of the Catholic mission in Asia under the Padroado do Oriente, inevitably led to the implementation of diplomatic initiatives, originating in Beijing and Lisbon, by the Qing emperors and Portuguese monarchy.In 1721 Kangxi sent António de Magalhães, a Jesuit missionary, as his emissary to the Portuguese king. Aware of the importance of a good relationship with the Beijing court, and of the prestige that such a tie could earn him in the European courts, King João V returned Kangxi's gesture in 1725 by sending Alexandre Metelo, as his ambassador, to Emperor Yongzheng.\n\nDuring the eighteenth century, Euro-Asian maritime trade peaked, following an unprecedented surge in European demand for exotic goods. Cotton textiles, porcelain, tea and coffee experienced an increasing penetration in European households. The popularization of tea also triggered a profound change in European material culture. The hot beverage was associated with the spread of less durable materials, like porcelain, and new objects that contributed to the emergence of new patterns of sociability and domesticity. The big East India companies dominated part of this trade, which also interested the mercantile communities of Lisbon. Through licenses granted by King João V (1706-1750), from 1710 onwards, ships regularly set sail from Lisbon to Macau, Coromandel and Bengal, without needing to call at Goa. This trade was carried out by merchants organized in trading partnerships or chartered companies, but it also involved the participation of foreign investors. In this integration in transnational business networks, Lisbon and its mercantile agents responded to the growing European demand of Asian commodities.\n\nThe cultural and scientific-technological exchange was perhaps one of the richest and most intense of the Sino-European and Sino-Portuguese relationships. It was also a time of growing mutual understanding and fascination, which was especially evident during a considerable period of the reign of Emperor Kangxi (1662-1722). However, when King João V ascended the Portuguese throne, in December 1706, the winds of change were already blowing. The so-called ‘Chinese Rites controversy’ led to the polarization of opinions. In 1724, Emperor Yongzheng (1723-1735), Kangxi's successor, eventually proscribed Christianity, while Rome condemned the Chinese rites again in 1715 and reiterated their position in 1742. The influence of China on Europe in the first half of the 18th century was very significant, with respect to both its material and intellectual culture. In Qing China, despite the difficult circumstances, missionaries - who from 1724 were legally restricted to Beijing and their scientific-technological and artistic activities, carried out under the auspices of the Emperor, namely Qianlong (1736-1795) - were still highly relevant in the fields of astrology, cartography, watchmaking, painting and architecture, but also the Christian religion itself.\n\nIn the first half of the 18th century, Macao experienced a period of profound change, which forced its institutions (the Senate and the Santa Casa da Misericórdia) as much as the Chinese and Luso-Asian elite to develop strategies that were essential for the survival of the city. Among other things, these new times brought with them an increase of bureaucratic, political, military and even judicial pressure and control by the Qing dynasty. The changing times also required that Macao redefine its relationship with the centralizing Portuguese Crown and the governors, its representatives in the city. Macao also had to readjust its commercial geography and economic diplomacy to new European competitors in Chinese markets and East Asia in general. In these new times, the city expanded spatially, and took on a more hybrid architectural appearance, while maintaining the predominantly Chinese urban profile that it had had since the early days of the Portuguese settlement back in 1555/1557."
