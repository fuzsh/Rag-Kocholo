        "text": "When Did People Start Living in Portugal?\n\nIt is unclear exactly how long people have been living in the land that is considered Portugal today, but it is widely believed that the area was inhabited by precursors to the human race about 400,000 years ago. They were called Homo heidelbergensis, but the first civilized people to live in Portugal that left behind a writing system was the Roman Empire. The Romans invaded the Iberian peninsula in the 3rd century BC, and the invasion lasted for several years. This includes Portugal, which was also controlled by the Romans during this time. The Romans would have control of the region for several centuries, until the fall of the Roman Empire.\n\nWhat Happened To Portugal Following the Fall of the Roman Empire?\n\nThe Roman Empire was eventually brought down by invading Germanic tribes during the 5th and 6th centuries. They had control of the area for a few centuries as well. The Kingdom of the Seubi and the Visigoths controlled Portugal, dividing it between them with the former controlling the north and the latter controlling the south. In the 8th century, Portugal would be conquered by the Umayyad Caliphate, which led to an era of stability in Portugal for several centuries. They would have control of the country for the better part of 400 years. Then, as the Middle Ages progressed, Portugal gained greater and greater influence in the affairs of the continent, positioning itself as a power.\n\nWhat Happened To Portugal During the Renaissance?\n\nDuring the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal solidified itself as a major European power. This was the time when Europe was busy exploring and colonizing the rest of the world, in which Portugal would play a major power. Portugal had one of the biggest empires on the planet, and it even colonized Brazil. Brazil is the largest country in South America today, and at one time, it was part of the Brazilian Empire. Unfortunately, the status of Portugal as a world power would not last forever, and by the 16th century, Portugal was already in decline, just as the British, French, and Spanish were getting warmed up. Portugal simply did not have the resources to continue its expansion, and it suffered at the hands of its more formidable foes.\n\nWhat Is Portugal Like as a Modern Country?"
