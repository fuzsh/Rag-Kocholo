        "text": "British royalty has not always been kind to Portugal over the 636 years that England (and later the United Kingdom) and Portugal have enjoyed what still is the longest unbroken treaty in the world — the Treaty of Windsor of 1386.\n\nBy Chris Graeme\n\nThe Portuguese have never quite forgotten that in 1898 the UK made an agreement with the Kaiser’s Germany over Portugal’s colonies of Mozambique, Angola, and Timor, which given the nearly bankrupt state of their colonial masters, were likely to be coming onto the world market.\n\nThe two signatories (Portugal was not even consulted) agreed they would keep other potential interested parties out of the equation and carve up the Portuguese empire for themselves.\n\nThere were also disputes over Southern Africa, which resulted in the 1890 British Ultimatum that forced the retreat of Portuguese military forces from areas which had been claimed by Portugal on the basis of historical discovery and exploration, but which the UK claimed on the basis of effective occupation.\n\nI can still remember having my ear chewed off by the great and learned Portuguese historian José Hermano Saraiva at a lunch in Estremoz some 15 years ago in which I was berated for all the terrible things the English had done to Portugal, which was abused and used most sorely in the name of whichever monarch happened to be sitting on the throne at the time. It was not a pleasant experience I can assure you, and I pointed out that I was not the British ambassador to Portugal!\n\nPortugal had attempted to claim a large area of land between its colonies of Mozambique and Angola, including most of present-day Zimbabwe and Zambia and a large part of Malawi, which had been included in Portugal’s “Rose-coloured Map”.\n\nAfter military threats from the British, the Portuguese were forced into an embarrassing stand down, and although official relations were repaired, the 1890 ultimatum is said to be one of the main causes for the republican revolution which ended the monarchy 20 years later on 5 October, 1910.\n\nBut there were happier times too; the marriage of Philippa of Lancaster, the daughter of John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, who wedded King João I of Portugal in 1387, was a happy marriage by all accounts and would go on to produce the ‘illustrious generation” which included Henry the Navigator who sponsored voyages of exploration to West Africa.\n\nThere are the amusing stories, made much of in the Regency cartoons of the time, of the stay the regal toddler princess Maria da Gloria – Queen Maria II – made in England in 1828, and who impressed King George IV with her self-assured queenly manner even at that tender age.\n\nLater on in her reign, the Queen of Portugal’s correspondence with her cousin Queen Victoria gives an interesting insight into the private life of the two powerful women, both married to princes of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha/Kohary (Albert and Ferdinand) who exchanged in French about the struggles of juggling motherhood with the responsibility and pleasure of power.\n\nAnd who could forget and not feel somewhat sorry for the trials and tears of the swarthy and devout Portuguese princess Catherine of Braganza, who was married to womanising King Charles II, and forced to endure the humiliations of seeing his many mistresses bear healthy sons and daughters, while she remained childless. Still, we owe her the introduction of tea drinking and the popularisation of the traditional Sunday roast dinner, if the culinary Two Fat Ladies are anything to go by.\n\nKing Edward VII made a royal visit to Portugal in 1903; the Lisbon city park Eduardo VII is named after him. In 1904 the King of Portugal, Carlos I and Queen Amelia paid a reciprocal but ceremonial visit to England where the royal couple met ‘Bertie and Alex’ (King Edward and Queen Alexandra) at Windsor Castle."
