        "text": "Afonso V (born Jan. 15, 1432, Sintra, Port.—died Aug. 28, 1481, Sintra) was the 10th king of Portugal (1438–81), known as the African from his campaigns in Morocco.\n\nThe son of King Edward (Duarte) and Queen Leonor, daughter of King Ferdinand I of Aragon, Afonso succeeded to the throne at the age of six. In 1440 his mother was deprived of the regency by his uncle Pedro, Duke de Coimbra, whose daughter Isabella Afonso married. The regent was in turn challenged by a half brother, the Duke de Bragança, and was forced to fight, dying at Alfarrobeira (May 1449). Afonso remained considerably under the influence of others, and he distributed his favours rashly. In North Africa he conquered Alcácer Ceguer in 1458, failed to take Tangier in 1463, took Arzila in 1471, and finally took Tangier.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz"
