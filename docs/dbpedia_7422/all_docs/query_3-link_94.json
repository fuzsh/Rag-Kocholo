        "text": "Kingdom of Kongo: History\n\nThe kingdom of Kongo existed from 1390 to 1665 and was originally a loose collection of self-governing bodies, but early in its history, centralization was achieved. The area in the Kingdom of Kongo grew; the nation spanned from modern-day Angola to the Democratic Republic of the Congo south of the Congo river. The Kingdom of Kongo was established after a political marriage. This was a union of the Mpemba Kasi and their rival, the Mbata people, and led to Lukeni Lua Nimi, the first King of Kongo.\n\nKongo or kikongo is the language used within the Kingdom of Kongo. Its use has spread across the globe, accompanying trafficked Africans during the slave trade. The language is spoken today in the DRC, Angola, Gabon, and the Republic of Congo.\n\nThe Kingdom of Kongo power was centralized through establishing the capital city, Mbanza Kongo. The population density was centered on the capital city, Mbanza Kongo, with a much smaller population located within small villages and towns. The bulk of the population was close at hand to the mani Kongo, and this solidified their authority over the rest of the kingdom.\n\nManikongo:\n\nThe term for the sovereign ruler or King of the Kingdom of Kongo.\n\nPortuguese explorers reached the Kingdom of Kongo in 1483 and established trade relations with the natives. Soon thereafter, the king - the manikongo, Nzinga a Nkuwu, and his son Mvemba a Nzinga, were baptized into the Christian faith at the direction of the Portuguese. João I now ruled the kingdom with his son Alfonso I and had a profitable relationship with Portugal in the export of materials and the slave trade.In 1509 Alfonso I took the throne after defeating his half-brother and establishing his claim. Alfonso, I strengthened the kingdom's ties with Portugal and entered into agreements that supplied Portuguese traders with goods, passage, and slaves. He solidified the role of the Catholic Church in the kingdom as the leading religion; his son Henrique Kinu a Mvemba was consecrated as a Bishop in 1520.\n\nIn 1526 Alfonso I started monitoring the slave trade with the Europeans to ensure no people were enslaved and sold illegally. He had heard rumors of illegal trades and soon learned that Portuguese traders were selling and exporting illegally enslaved people.\n\nAlfonso I died in 1542, resulting in a messy line of succession and civil war between rivals for the role of manikongo. The destabilization of the kingdom led to outside enemies seizing power in 1568, and Álvaro I Nimi a Lukeni (the manikongo) had to request assistance from the Portuguese to regain control. The Portuguese assisted the manikongo with the promise of an area to establish a colony that they named Luanda.\n\nThe Portuguese colony of Luanda was established and is now known as Angola; the relationship between Angola and the Kingdom of Kongo was contentious. The conflict culminated in the Battle of Mbwila, which occurred on October 29, 1665. The manikongo, António I Nvita a Nkanga, was killed by the Portuguese, marking the end of the unified Kingdom of Kongo.\n\nThe Kingdom of Kongo ceased to exist as a unified nation and was plagued by civil war throughout the remaining 16th century and following into the 17th century. In 1913-1914 Álvaro Buta led the revolt against the manikongo. The Kingdom of Kongo was fully absorbed as Portuguese territory.\n\nKingdom of Kongo: Sculptures\n\nMaterials used in sculptures in the Kingdom of Kongo included ivory, wood, and other decorative elements. Ivory was a prized material and local chiefs or the reigning monarch closely controlled the distribution of ivory. Art was a reflection of the cultural and religious beliefs of the artist.\n\nThese sculptures were forms of a nkisi; a nkisi is a container for sacred medicine. Different sacred medicines were explicitly used for their related condition or issue; these sacred medicines are encased within the artworks and became both art and religious talismans.\n\nAfter the introduction of Catholicism to the mainstream society of the Kingdom of Kongo, art began to take inspiration from Christian iconography.\n\nIconography is sacred art designed to depict religious interpretation; in Catholicism, the central icon is the Virgin Mary in her blue robe.\n\nPower Figure\n\nA power figure is a collaborative effort between a ritual expert and an artist. These held great religious, cultural, and social significance. The ritual expert, or nganga, would begin work when the artist completed their design. These designs involved metalwork, nails, ceramic and other materials related to specific mystic properties. They are also in the form of people relaying their intent to intervene in human issues; these human-shaped power statues are nkisi nkondi.\n\nThe sacred medicine is usually located in the work's head or stomach. The sacred substances will be covered with a piece of reflective material, and the reflective piece represents the nkisi's ability to see into the spirit world. The most prominent feature of a nkisi nkindi is the numerous nails or pieces of metal, glass, or ceramic driven into the figure.\n\nThe role of the power figure was pivotal in daily life as they were consulted in the same way as a chief in disputes. Each nail or piece represented a conflict resolved with an oath; if this oath was broken, the sacred substances, nkisi nkondi, would activate. Then the figure would carry out its mission according to the oath made\n\nReligious Art\n\nArt took on a new motivation when the Kingdom of Kongo became tied to the Catholic Church. While Christian Iconography was the central inspiration, the local artistic style became a part of the country's religious art. Figures would have African traits in appearance and resemble the Power Figures' human features.\n\nThe success of the Christian conversion in the Kingdom of Kongo relied upon the inclusion of traditional art and beliefs."
