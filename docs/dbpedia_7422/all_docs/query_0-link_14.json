However, if you do\n\ndata TABLE_1; FIELD_1=&efiledt2; run;\n\nNow you have one row, and the variable FIELD_1 contains the desired date.\n\nAlso, INTNX works on unformatted date values only. These must be valid SAS date values, which are integers. If you have a formatted date somehow, then you have to properly unformat it, which is extra work. And so the advice is to not format your dates for use in INTNX (although certainly formatted dates have other uses).\n\n--\n\nPaige Miller\n\nno, that does not work. there are two issues, putting the date in and getting it out. i know part, putting it in using symput function puts it in character format which will not go into a date formatted field...(filed_1 date format=MMDDYY8. informat=MMDDYY8.). so using that i can get the right date in there but in the wrong format. so i too need to get it out in that format and i am going to use that global variable like 10 times throughout the code and it needs to be a global variable too.\n\nproc sql; create table TABLE_1( FIELD_1 date format=MMDDYY8. informat=MMDDYY8.); quit; data _null_; format efiledt2 mmddyy8.; efiledt2 = intnx('month',today(),-1,'E'); run; data TABLE_1; set TABLE_1; FIELD_1=\"&efiledt2\"d; run;\n\nthat is good to know but that doesnt really help me get what i need. what i need is a global variable that i can put into a field in format mm/dd/yy. even if i can put it in there in many ways, i need it out in mm/dd/yy format. i had a few errors in the code, here is what i am trying to do...\n\nproc sql; create table TABLE_1 ( FIELD_1 date format=MMDDYY8. informat=MMDDYY8.); quit; data _null_; format efiledt2 mmddyy8.; efiledt2 = intnx('month',today(),-1,'E'); run; data TABLE_1; set TABLE_1; FIELD_1=&efiledt2; run;\n\n@me55 wrote:\n\nthat is good to know but that doesnt really help me get what i need. what i need is a global variable that i can put into a field in format mm/dd/yy. even if i can put it in there in many ways, i need it out in mm/dd/yy format. i had a few errors in the code, here is what i am trying to do...\n\nproc sql; create table TABLE_1 ( FIELD_1 date format=MMDDYY8. informat=MMDDYY8.); quit; data _null_; format efiledt2 mmddyy8.; efiledt2 = intnx('month',today(),-1,'E'); run; data TABLE_1; set TABLE_1; FIELD_1=&efiledt2; run;\n\nWell, if you need it in a particular format, you format the variable FIELD_1 with a FORMAT statement, rather than format the macro variable.\n\nAs stated above, you do not need formatted macro variables (unless you are going to use them in a title or label, not the case here).\n\n--\n\nPaige Miller\n\nWell you have other SAS errors in your code, such as create a data set TABLE_1 from PROC SQL which has 0 rows.\n\nThen when you do\n\ndata TABLE_1; set TABLE_1; FIELD_1=&efiledt2; run;\n\nyou still have zero rows.
