Respondents were queried about food product safety issues, including which foods were considered safe, under which types of controls a food product was considered safe, the necessity for more frequent and stricter controls, factors that determined the safety of a food product, where the safest food products could be purchased, who told the truth about the safety of food products, reasons for using or not using label information, the type of information read and used, whether the respondent followed food use and storage instructions, and the types of information that should be on food product labels. Other topics covered in this survey included health care and cancer. Respondents reported on their general state of health, and whether they had recently visited a doctor or had been treated in a hospital. They provided information on their level of satisfaction with the health care system in their country, their opinions on health care options and treatments, how spending for health care should be financed, and their reactions to several examples about the use of health care resources. Questions on cancer focused on respondents' understanding of possible symptoms, their opinions on the prevention of cancer, and the importance of national screening programs for breast cancer. Women and men were asked separate sets of questions about breast cancer and prostate cancer. This survey also asked respondents about \"child sex tourism,\" including awareness of and willingness to discuss sex tourism involving children, and opinions regarding how common this problem is, where it takes place, the kind of people who take part in it, the reasons why people would take part, and the moral and legal acceptability of child sex tourism. Demographic and other background information provided includes respondent's age, sex, marital status, occupation, left-right political self-placement and vote intention, as well as household income, the number of people residing in the home, and region of residence.\n\nCitation View help for Citation\n\nMelich, Anna.
