The area included the towns of Porto, Coimbra, Viseu, Guimaraes and Braga. It was here that Portugal's national identity was forged.\n\nAfonso Henriques established Portuguese independence from neighboring Galicia and Leon in Spain and extended his territory south to include Lisbon after conflict with the Moors. For this he is known to the Portuguese as The Conqueror (O Conquistador), The Great (O Grande) or The Founder (O Fundador).\n\nOverseas Expansion\n\nIt was under the kings of the succeeding House of Avis in particular during the reigns of João II (1455-1495) and Manuel I (1469-1521) that Portugal began its rapid expansion of exploration, trade and conquest in Africa, Brazil and later in India and the Far East. Explorers and adventurers such as Bartolomeu Dias, Vasco da Gama, Pedro Álvares Cabral and Afonso Alberquerque enabled the presence of Europeans in places they had never previously set foot.\n\nWealth generated by the spice trade transformed this small nation on the fringes of Europe into one of its richest for a brief time. Portugal's nautical prowess found expression not just at sea but also on land through Manueline architecture and the construction of such vast buildings as the Mosteiro dos Jerónimos in Belém, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nRule by Spain\n\nHard-won Portuguese independence from Spain hegemony came to a crashing halt in 1595 when Henry the Chaste, a clergyman, died without an heir. The throne was assumed by King Philip II of Spain who became King Philip I of Portugal seeing off the brief challenge of António I, who \"ruled\" for a matter of days. The restoration of João IV brought to an end of 60 years of Spanish rule. The so-called Iberian Union came to a formal end after the protracted Portuguese Restoration War (1640-1668) and the signing of the Treaty of Lisbon.\n\nRise & Fall\n\nThe power and wealth of the Portuguese monarch reached its zenith during the reign of João V. João ruled Portugal from 1706-1750 and was known as the Portuguese Sun King for his resemblance to King Louis XIV of France in wealth and his love of ostentatious Baroque ceremony. Newly-discovered gold and diamonds flooded into the country from Brazil. João spent and built lavishly including his take on Versailles, the Mosteiro Palácio Nacional de Mafra in Mafra just outside the capital.\n\nDiminishing gold from Brazil, the 1755 Lisbon Earthquake, invasion by French armies under Napoleon and the subsequent and devastating Peninsular War (1807-1814) were later to severely weaken the Portuguese monarchy as an institution. Indeed, João VI (then Prince Regent) and the increasingly mentally-ill Queen Maria I were forced to flee to Brazil under the protection of a British fleet in 1807 to escape the French.\n\nJoão returned in 1821 to a country in chaos. Less than a century later the monarchy in Portugal was gone. Dom Carlos I was assassinated by Republican activists in Terreiro do Paço near Praça do Comércio in Lisbon in 1908. He was the first Portuguese king to die a violent death since Sebastian at the Battle of Alcácer Quibir in Morocco in 1578.\n\nCarlos' eldest son was also killed in the attack and his younger son Manuel II became the last king before he was forced into exile. He left from the port of Ericeira for England in 1910 and was to die in London in somewhat mysterious circumstances, while seemingly in the best of health.\n\nRelated\n\nPortuguese History\n\nAge of Discoveries\n\n1755 Earthquake"
