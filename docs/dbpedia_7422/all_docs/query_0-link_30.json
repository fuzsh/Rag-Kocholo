        "text": "^The Morningstar Medalist RatingTM is the summary expression of Morningstar’s forward-looking analysis of investment strategies as offered via specific vehicles using a rating scale of Gold, Silver, Bronze, Neutral, and Negative. The Medalist Ratings indicate which investments Morningstar believes are likely to outperform a relevant index or peer group average on a risk-adjusted basis over time. Investment products are evaluated on three key pillars (People, Parent, and Process) which, when coupled with a fee assessment, forms the basis for Morningstar’s conviction in those products’ investment merits and determines the Medalist Rating they’re assigned. Pillar ratings take the form of Low, Below Average, Average, Above Average, and High. Pillars may be evaluated via an analyst’s qualitative assessment (either directly to a vehicle the analyst covers or indirectly when the pillar ratings of a covered vehicle are mapped to a related uncovered vehicle) or using algorithmic techniques. Vehicles are sorted by their expected performance into rating groups defined by their Morningstar Category and their active or passive status. When analysts directly cover a vehicle, they assign the three pillar ratings based on their qualitative assessment, subject to the oversight of the Analyst Rating Committee, and monitor and reevaluate them at least every 14 months. When the vehicles are covered either indirectly by analysts or by algorithm, the ratings are assigned monthly. For more detailed information about these ratings, including their methodology, please go to global.morningstar.com/managerdisclosures/.\n\nThe Morningstar Medalist Ratings are not statements of fact, nor are they credit or risk ratings. The Morningstar Medalist Rating (i) should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating an investment product, (ii) involves unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what was expected, (iii) are not guaranteed to be based on complete or accurate assumptions or models when determined algorithmically, (iv) involve the risk that the return target will not be met due to such things as unforeseen changes in management, technology, economic development, interest rate development, operating and/or material costs, competitive pressure, supervisory law, exchange rate, tax rates, exchange rate changes, and/or changes in political and social conditions, and (v) should not be considered an offer or solicitation to buy or sell the investment product. A change in the fundamental factors underlying the Morningstar Medalist Rating can mean that the rating is subsequently no longer accurate.\n\nThe Data Coverage % data point is a summary metric describing the level of data completeness used to generate the overall rating. If the pillar is assigned directly or indirectly by analysts, the pillar has complete data availability, as no model was used to estimate the pillar score. If the pillar is assigned directly by algorithm, Morningstar counts the number of data points feeding both the positive and negative models and counts whether the vehicle has strategy-specific data available. A simple percentage is calculated per pillar. The overall data coverage % is then scaled by pillar weights.\n\nThe Analyst-Driven % data point displays the weighted percentage of a vehicle’s pillar ratings assigned directly or indirectly by analysts. For example, if the People and Parent ratings are assigned directly or indirectly by analysts but the Process rating is assigned algorithmically, the Analyst-Driven % for an actively managed vehicle would disclose that 55% of the pillar weight was assigned by analysts and the Analyst-Driven % for a passively managed vehicle would disclose that 20% of the pillar weight was assigned by analysts."
