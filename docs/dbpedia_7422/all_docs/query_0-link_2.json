Portugal's discovery of a sea route to India, campaign of imperial conquest over Muslim rulers, and domination of the spice trade would forever disrupt the Mediterranean and build the first global economy. Author Crowley relies on letters and eyewitness testimony to tell the story of tiny Portugal's rapid rise to power. Conquerors reveals the Império Português in all of its splendor and ferocity. Figures such as King Manuel \"the Fortunate,\" João II \"the Perfect Prince,\" marauding governor Afonso de Albuquerque, and explorer Vasco da Gama juggled their private ambitions and the public aims of the empire in pursuit of a global fortune. Also central to the story was Portugal's drive to eradicate Islamic culture and establish a Christian empire in the Indian Ocean. Portuguese explorers pushed deep into the African continent and ruthlessly besieged Indian port cities. The discovery of a route to India around the horn of Africa was not only a brilliant breakthrough in navigation but heralded a complete upset of the world order. For the next century, no European empire was more ambitious, no rulers more rapacious. In the process they created the first long-range maritime empire and set in motion the forces of globalization that now shape our world.",
