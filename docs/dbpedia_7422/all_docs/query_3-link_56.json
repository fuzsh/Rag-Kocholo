        "text": "Pedro d’Alcântara of Bragança (1798-1834), second male heir to King João VI and the Spanish Princess Carlota Joaquina de Bourbon, was the great character in one of the most decisive periods in Luso-Brazilian history. In a period of tension and transformation in both Portugal and Brazil, his actions played a decisive part in the armed conflict between absolutists and liberals, triggering the end of the Ancien Régime on both sides of the Atlantic.\n\nThe premature death of his older brother, António Pio, left him as heir to the throne of Portugal. Years later he would go to war against his brother Miguel over the rights of succession of his first daughter to the throne. As king, he also managed to maintain a coherent political attitude even when facing contradictions, responsibilities and private affections.\n\nHis passionate life story both begins and ends in the Royal Palace of Queluz, in the chambers where the mirrors, decoration and paintings – allusive to the adventures of the resourceful noble Don Quixote de La Mancha – witnessed his birth and where, almost thirty-six years later, he lived out his final moments, surrounded by family and battlefield companions.\n\nFew leaders in the history of the 19th century had such a short, intense and glorious reign as his own. Prince, Emperor, King and soldier, he abstained from his own ideals and personal interests – as any romantic, liberating hero –, displaying utter commitment in his acting in defence of those causes he deemed just and necessary. The leader of two constitutional monarchies, on the old and the new continent, he abdicated his rights to two Crowns in favour of a liberty that he “signed into effect with a feather and defended with the sword”.\n\nRoom of King Pedro IV of Portugal (Emperor Pedro I of Brazil), Royal Palace of Queluz, Ferdinand Le Feubure (Munich, 1815- Munich, 1898), 1850, From the collection of: National Palace of Queluz\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nThe renowned Don Quixote Room in the mid-19th century.\n\nAround 50 pieces, selected for their quality and iconographic uniqueness, evoke the multiple facets of a monarch divided between two worlds in order to establish narratives based on the Palace of Queluz collections.\n\n14 works loaned from the many of the most prestigious museological institutions complement this virtual and chronological tour through the life and times of King Pedro IV of Portugal, the first Emperor of Brazil.\n\nThis art exhibition provides new readings of the collections, establishes new dialogues between the pieces on display as well as bringing to light works either unknown or difficult to provide public access to. Furthermore, the Don Quixote Room, where King Pedro was born and died, is recalled through an 1850 watercolour (Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum) and an historical photograph (Lisbon Municipal Archive), both rare iconographic documents pre-dating the fire of 4th October 1934, which damaged sections of the Palace.\n\nPalace of Queluz: in front of the chamber of HIH the Duke of Bragança, Manoel Luiz da Costa, 1844, From the collection of: National Palace of Queluz\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nOne of the façades in the Don Quixote Room in 1844.\n\nSouthern Façade of the Don Quixote Room, Jean-Baptiste Robillion (Novy, 1710-Queluz, 1782), From the collection of: National Palace of Queluz\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nThe current façade.\n\n\"Royal Palace of Queluz\n\nDon Quixote Room\n\n12th October 1798\n\nBorn at 6.30am\"\n\nStudies for a portrait of the Royal Family, Domingos António de Sequeira (Lisbon, 1768-Rome, 1837), c. 1798-1799, From the collection of: National Palace of Queluz\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nStudy of Prince Pedro, as a baby, for a probably collective portrait of the Royal Family (c.1798-1799).\n\n\"INFANCY IN THE PALACE OF QUELUZ\n\n1798-1807\"\n\n“Our Lady Princess, having completed her pregnancy did happily give birth on the 12th of this month at 6.30 in the morning to a healthy prince.”\n\nGazeta de Lisboa, 16th October 1798.\n\n“(...) the scenes that first came into the hazy and lost gaze of Pedro as a newborn were... excerpts from the Don Quixote story.”\n\nOctávio Tarquínio de Sousa, “A Vida de D.

Under the protection of João VI, the artists defined the bases of a formal system of teaching and artistic practice for the kingdom's capital. Important figures such as the architect Grandjean de Montigny, the sculptor Auguste-Marie Taunay, the engraver Charles-Simon Pradier and the painters Jean-Baptiste Debret and Nicolas-Antoine Taunay contributed actively to the cultural renovation of Brazil and to the foundation of its first academy of art, headed by Joachim Le Breton. Among the functions undertaken by the members of the Mission were the production of scenarios and decorations for Court festivities and events, the construction of public buildings, the definition of official images through royal portraits and other works of political affirmation.\n\nThe death of Le Breton in 1819 and the 1820 nomination of the Portuguese painter Henrique José da Silva as the new director of the Royal Academy, triggered the return to France of some of the leading members of this artistic mission. Such was the case for Nicolas Taunay (1821) and Debret (1831).\n\nOur Lady of Conception, Jean-Baptiste Debret (Paris, 1768-Paris, 1848), 1818, From the collection of: National Palace of Queluz\n\n,\n\nPedro, Royal Prince of the United Kingdom of Portugal and Brazil and the Algarves, Jean Philippe Goulu (Genebra, 1786 - Buenos Aires, 1853), 1817, From the collection of: National Palace of Queluz\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nInfanta Maria Isabel of Bragança, Nicolas-Antoine Taunay (1755, Paris-1830, Paris), 1816, From the collection of: National Palace of Queluz\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nInfanta Maria Isabel, sister of Prince Pedro and the future Queen of Spain in an 1816 portrait by N.

In a melancholic letter, written on 27th August 1851, she describes the emotional experience:\n\n“Following the death of my father, I never again returned to this palace. (...) I recalled everything. Each object had been engrained in my memory, even while having, on that occasion, but three years of age! There was such great emotion when I went into the room!... The bed (...) is still the same and still in the same place, with the same bedcovers, the same mattresses, the same pillows… everything had been so well preserved...”\"\n\nInterior view of Don Quixote Room, 1900/1934, From the collection of: National Palace of Queluz\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nView from the Room at the beginning of the 20th century.

The bed with the canopy is the same as the 1850 watercolour on which Princess Maria Amélia wrote in French: \"Chambre où mourut mon père, dans le Palais de Queluz\" [Room where my father died in the Palace of Queluz].\n\n“The extraordinary heir, who gave his life to his nation, who lives on in the memory of his century and who shall be admired down through all time, enveloped in the weight of all his glorious feats, idolised for his virtues, expired unperturbed in the midst of his illnesses, which were the agonies of the entire nation.\n\nOn the forever unfortunate day of 24th September 1834 died the august Duke of Bragança, Lord Pedro de Alcântara, King of Portugal, Emperor of Brasil, restorer of freedom to his nation and the usurped throne to his august Daughter in whose name he served as regent of the kingdom.\n\n(...) what Monarch ever had such funeral pomp that expressed so much pain? (...) Soldiers, officers and citizens of all social standings shed tears and gazed on that coffin with the religious respect inspired by a ruined temple that had once been the mansion of a god.\n\n(...) Never had Portugal seen a day of such lament. Only a single consolation remained to the nation, (...) the hope that his heir (...) shall set an example of such fair pity!”\n\nGaceta de Madrid (official gazette of the Spanish government),\n\n9th October 1834.\n\n“Currently, Pedro is honoured by all as a great prince, as the founder of liberty in Portugal, as a courageous captain and, above all, as an adventurous leader who by his energy, his talents and his perseverance was able to bring about the finest, most poetic, most chivalrous feats of modern times (…).\n\nThrough to his last moments, Pedro never let down the greatest of his soul that stood up to such brilliant test in the most difficult vicissitudes of his life. Thus, he made his daughter, Queen Maria, promise to free from the prisons all the political exiles. This is his stipulation, certainly a good policy at least in terms of its generous and Christian soul. Finally, to end his career on earth with the style of noble modesty, Pedro, the former Emperor of Brazil, the former King of Portugal, the regent of a kingdom, sought only to receive in the wake of his death the honours due to a general (…).”\n\nLe Figaro, Paris, 9th October 1834.\n\n“The death of the former Emperor of Brazil is not a factor of indifference to the two factions of the (...) Portuguese Monarchy. (...) Pedro de Alcântara (...) opened the field to important successes and influenced (...) the destinies of the Empire of Brazil and the Kingdom of Portugal.\n\n(...) existing in them the core of great qualities (…), Providence made of him a powerful instrument of liberation whether in Brazil or in Portugal.\n\n(...) The former Emperor expired at the point most favourable to his own glory; the point that measures between the vivid remembrance of what he did to bring about Portuguese freedom and fears over the future that shall perhaps emerge with its coming about.”\n\nAurora Fluminense, Rio de Janeiro,\n\n3rd November 1834.\n\n“Anxiety, privations, disappointments, vicissitudes and exhausting exertions, has completely broken down a robust constitution, before any one was aware of it. In the moment of his success, he was taken suddenly ill, and he felt that his hour was come.\n\n(...) In contemplating the character of this man, who played such a high and conspicuous part in the drama of human life, everyone must acknowledge that it was no common one; energy, activity, sagacity, and a wish to improve the constitution of the people he governed, were all his own; caprice, ignorance, passion, sensuality, and occasional cruelty, were the results of his unfortunate education.\n\n(...)
