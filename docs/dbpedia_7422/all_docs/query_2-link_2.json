        "text": "John V (born Oct. 22, 1689, Lisbon—died July 31, 1750, Lisbon) was the king of Portugal from 1706 to 1750, whose relatively peaceful reign saw an increase in the wealth and power of the crown and a generous patronage of learning, culture, and the church.\n\nJohn inherited Portugal’s involvement in the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–14) from his father, Peter II (1683–1706), but peace was finally made with France (1713) and Spain (1715). For the remainder of John’s long reign, except for a brief campaign against the Turks, the country remained at peace. The great wealth derived from the gold and diamonds of Brazil, Portugal’s colony, freed him from financial dependence on the Cortes, the national assembly, and increased the already substantial power of the crown.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nKings and Emperors (Part III) Quiz\n\nAlthough John attempted to restore the navy and stimulated industry and building, his administration was not noted for its vigour. His great wealth enabled him to emulate the magnificence of other European courts. In addition, he endowed libraries, encouraged scholarship, patronized the arts, and founded a Royal Academy of History (1720), as well as museums of natural history and architecture. He spent lavish sums on the church and sought to enhance the ecclesiastical status of his court, though his efforts involved him in a lengthy dispute with the papacy."
