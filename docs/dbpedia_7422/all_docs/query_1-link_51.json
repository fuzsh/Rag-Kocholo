        "text": "The Portuguese were among the very first European explorers to the Americas, and some Americans claim descent from the parties of the first conquistadors. Subsequent waves of immigration included people from the Azores, the Madeiras, the Cape Verde Islands, continental Portugal and China.\n\nWe have listed catalogs and archives outside the Library of Congress that have local histories, censuses, and land records. Look for various genealogy periodicals and publications, lists, useful websites and online databases, as well as services subscribed to by the Library."
