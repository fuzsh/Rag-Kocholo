        "text": "Construction of the National Palace of Sintra began between the 10th and 11th centuries, even before the founding of the Kingdom of Portugal. Many monarchs have passed through the palace over the course of four dynasties. Another notable royal palace in the municipality is the National Palace of Queluz, which, after the earthquake of 1755, became the official residence of the Court until it left for Brazil during the French invasions. In Sintra, yet another palace inhabited by kings and queens was the National Palace of Pena. This was the favourite intimate refuge of the Royal Family, who enjoyed the cool weather and the quiet of the Sintra hills, away from the court.\n\nSo how many kings passed through these three palaces in Sintra in the end? The answer is simple: all of them! There are records that prove the passage of all monarchs through Sintra, even those of the Philippine dynasty, but some left their mark more than others. Here are some examples:\n\nKing Afonso Henriques: soon after the conquest of Lisbon in 1147 and the surrender of the Moors in Sintra, the first king of Portugal had a religious structure built that we know today as the Church of São Pedro de Canaferrim. It was also around this time – specifically in 1154 – that King Afonso Henriques granted Sintra a town charter. It was the first municipality to receive such a charter from the king.\n\nKing Dinis: as already mentioned, the construction of the Palace of Sintra began even before the foundation of Portugal, but the truth is that the first document attesting to the existence of a palace in Chão da Oliva, as the place was called, dates from 1281. It is a contract between King Dinis and the free Muslims of Colares, in which the king offered to reduce their tax burden in return for them taking care of the palace's upkeep.\n\nQueen Isabel of Aragon: the palace, the town of Sintra and its territory were granted to the wife of King Dinis in 1287. While the property remained in the hands of the crown, the queen became the beneficiary, taking receipt of all income and tax revenues. Thus began the tradition of giving control of Sintra to the kingdom's queens. It was also Isabel who implemented the cult of the Divine Holy Spirit in Sintra. Even today, we find several churches, chapels and festivals dedicated to the Holy Spirit throughout the municipality.\n\nKing João I: it was in the Palace of Sintra – a building to which he devoted his greatest attention, ordering one of the largest interventions ever in the palace – that in 1413 the king received the spies sent to the court of Sicily on a supposed diplomatic mission, but whose real purpose was to obtain strategic data on the port of Ceuta. Don't forget that the conquest of this city symbolically marked the beginning of the Portuguese Discoveries.\n\nKing Duarte: from the 15th century onwards, Portuguese monarchs began to use the Palace of Sintra with greater frequency. One of the great lovers of this town was King Duarte, who wrote the following: \"We come to this town of Sintra many times to have some summers. And so we believe that the kings who come after us will do too, because we find the land of very good airs and waters, and of counties in which there is a great abundance of provisions from the sea and land, and because our very noble and loyal city of Lisbon is so close, and because we have in Sintra a lot of amusement and recreation in the mountains and hunting. And because we have there noble palaces of very wide views.\"\n\nKing Afonso V: the son of King Duarte was born (1432) and died (1481) in the National Palace of Sintra.\n\nKing João II: the son of King Afonso V was acclaimed king of Portugal in the Palace of Sintra.\n\nKing Manuel I: This king was responsible for some of the most striking changes to the Palace, namely the implementation of Hispano-Moorish tile coverings and the creation of the Room of the Coat of Arms. At the end of his reign, the Palace of Sintra was one of the grandest palaces of the kings of Portugal. And it was precisely in Sintra, in 1501, that King Manuel learnt of one of the great achievements that marked his reign: the discovery of Brazil.\n\nKing Philip I (II of Spain): during his stay in Sintra, after visiting the Convent of the Capuchos for the first time in 1581, Philip sent a letter to his daughters that illustrates well what he felt when he arrived at this refuge of the Franciscan friars, 'hidden' in the Sintra hills. \"Of all my kingdoms, there are two places that I greatly esteem, Escorial for being so rich, and the Convent of Santa Cruz [known today as the Convent of the Capuchos] for being so poor,\" wrote the monarch."
