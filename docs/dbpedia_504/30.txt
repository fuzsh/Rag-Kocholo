He usually performed Irish folk songs and ballads on the radio, and was dubbed by Milton Cross as "our own little John McCormack" Some of the radio programs he performed on were Coast to Coast on a Bus; Irene Wicker, the Singing Lady; and The Fred Allen Show. On the latter show he became acquainted with The DeMarco Sisters, with whom he was notably trapped for four days during the North American blizzard of 1947. He also had the opportunity to perform with such legendary entertainers as Humphrey Bogart, Bing Crosby, and Frank Sinatra on Allen's program. By the age of 12 he was performing challenging tenor songs with full orchestras on NBC radio, such as 'Ah, Sweet Mystery of Life' from Victor Herbert's Naughty Marietta.

In 1979, he released the album "Robert White Sings Baeethoven" with cellist Yo-Yo Ma, violinist Ani Kavafian, and Sanders on piano.

That same year he performed a recital of songs that all used text by James Joyce at the Juilliard School. In 1994 he was a feature soloist in a concert honoring philanthropist and opera singer Alice Tully, who was a close friend of White's, at Lincoln Center along with the New York Philharmonic Orchestra, soprano Jessye Norman, conductor James Levine, and other music luminaries.

As DonÂt Sit Under the Apple Tree (With Anyone Else but Me) proved, Mr. White is alsoÂgood to knowÂa first-rate whistler."
