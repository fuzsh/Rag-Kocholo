        "text": "Robert White Blocks (born January 17, 1943) was a Robloxian actor, singer and songwriter. He is widely known for his major contributions to the music of the 20th century. He is also named in the Significant Robloxians of Music. Not only an actor, however, he had numerous of major roles in many different films and series. He was also one of the best actors. He had also done a major contribution with Edwin Green on the show called Edwin Comedy. He had also won a major award from the Bloxy Awards in 1990.\n\nHe had made a variety of classic disco and pop music during his peak, and during his early years, he had started off by releasing Rock n Roll music in the 1960s. He had made music in a variety of genres. He had explored most of the genres, even Loubu or Ro-Indi genres which is a reason he had been listened to people even outside of Robloxia, around the world. He had started his career in 1963 and ended up being one of the best singers in Robloxia during the 1970s.\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly Life[]\n\nRobert White Blocks was born on January 17, 1943 in Brookhaven Side Town, Bloxburg Valley in Robloxia. His father was working in a printing company where he would go to Brookhaven everyday for work. The town was not much far. In 1950, Blocks and his family moved to Havenford, another nearby town. They all decided to settle there. His father brought a large piece of land and used it for farming. During his adolescence, Blocks had developed a huge interest in singing and making his own songs. He had been heavily inspired by the singer, Luther Carson who was at his peak during those decades. He had also been inspired by Charles White, Luke Smith. His parents did be happy about that a lot. Robert went to different competitions for singing. He also was quite interested in drama. Every month, he would buy a film.\n\nCareer[]\n\nIn 1963, he had finally set off to set his career at the age of 20. He had started by his first song ‘Satisfied (1963)’. However the song did not go well. He proceeded by working on a song for a large amount of time and tried his best. He released the song ‘Light Figures’ (1963) the song had gone quite popular. He got proud. He made a similar song and tried making it better with the help of a few others, ‘Stunned by the thing’ (1964). The song got popular immediately. In 1965, he contributed with Edwin Green to make Edwin Comedy and he also got hired to act in it. Robert was a major character in the show. In 1974, his friend who also acted in the show, Timothy Sr, got murdered and it was a very tragic event. The show had stopped for an year. So as Robert’s career. During the 1970s, Robert had left Rock and Roll and started to majorly do energetic disco songs. His song ‘Boogie and Move’ (1975) had eventually became his most popular song in his career. In the 1980s, he still made disco songs however after the clash in 1979, disco had declined. Robert tried his best to keep disco up. He was one of the Robloxians who tried to save disco. In 1990, he had won an award from the Bloxy awards. In 2008, he retired as he neared his 70s. He mostly started managing his farm next to his house. He had made his last song ‘The end has come?’ (2008). Oddly, the song was a humorous song.\n\nAfter Retirement[]\n\nAfter retiring he focused more on managing his farm. He had won a few awards after retiring and his legacy still continues. He has a bloxtube channel named by his name that posts things based on his events and songs."
