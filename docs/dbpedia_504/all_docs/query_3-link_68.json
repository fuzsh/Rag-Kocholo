        "text": "Robert Joseph White, affectionately known as “Bob,” “Bobby,” or “Rob,” passed away on June 15, 2024, in Albany, Oregon, at the age of 61. Born on February 16, 1963, in Berkeley, California, Robert lived a meaningful and fulfilling life.\n\nRobert grew up in Pleasant Hill, California, in an Irish-Catholic family. He attended Ygnacio Valley High School, where he was the “star” of the basketball team, and graduated in 1981. Robert worked at and later owned his father’s business, Bay Trade Bindery, for many years in Oakland, California. He met the love of his life, Mary, on a blind date in October 1989 and they eloped to Molokai, Hawaii in January of 1990. They raised their daughters in Antioch, California before the family relocated to Flagstaff, Arizona in 2004. There, Robert became a CDL truck driver and continued to find success and enjoyment in that career upon moving to Woodburn, Oregon in 2016. Being a devoted husband, “girl dad,” and “grumpa” meant the world to him and seeing his daughters follow their dreams brought a smile to his face.\n\nIn his free time, Robert enjoyed the simple pleasures of life. He loved spending time with his family, taking short trips to the ocean, lakes, and mountains, and tending to his pristine and peaceful backyard. He was often found enjoying a cold beer outside and sharing his sense of humor with those around him.\n\nRobert is survived by his loving wife, Mary; his daughters Megan, Jaclyn (Nobuya), and Snow (Camiel); and his grandson, Mason. He is also survived by his older siblings Kathy, Carolyn, and Bill along with their spouses and his nieces and nephews. Robert was preceded in death by his parents, Robert White and Mary Keane.\n\nA Celebration of Life will be held on August 10th in Lincoln, California, where family and close friends will gather to remember and honor Robert. His ashes will be scattered in California and Oregon.\n\nRobert's never-ending love and his unique humor will be deeply missed. He left an unforgettable mark and positive impression on those who knew him, and his memory will be cherished forever. May he rest in peace.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family requests that donations be made in Robert’s name to Willamette Vital Health. An online donation form can be found at this link: https://form-renderer-app.donorperfect.io/give/willamette-vital-health/wvh-donations ."
