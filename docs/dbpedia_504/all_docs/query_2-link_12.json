        "text": "Robert White, Alamo defender, was born in 1806. He was a resident of Gonzales and served in the siege of Bexar in the rank of lieutenant. Following the battle, White was promoted to captain and commanded one of the Bexar garrison's infantry companies, the Bexar Guards. It is possible that White left Bexar before the siege of the Alamo for his home in Gonzales and then returned with the relief force from the town. White died in the battle of the Alamo on March 6, 1836."
