        "text": "Mr. Robert J. White, of Waltham, died Monday, December 11, 2023 in Newton-Wellesley Hospital. He was 87.\n\nBob was born in Waltham on October 15, 1936, a son of the late William and Ruth (Bennett) White and grew up in Cambridge. He was a graduate of Cambridge High and Latin and continued his studies at Northeastern University attending classes at night. During the Korean War he served with the United States Army and was stationed in Germany.\n\nHe met the love of his life, Sheila Dubie, when the two were co-workers at the Sanborn Company which later became part of Hewlett-Packard in Waltham. They married on October 2, 1965 in Saint Mary’s Church and the pair made Waltham their lifelong home.\n\nBob was always hardworking and never backed down from a challenge; he survived multiple rounds of cancer without complaint and worked until his death. He was a communications manager and a buyer of medical components during his time at Hewlett-Packard. Following his retirement from HP he went to work part time for the City of Waltham at the city garage doing inventory management.\n\nHe was a familiar face at the Waltham Senior Center where he maintained a close circle of friends. He always looked forward to getting together at the center to play Texas Hold ’em among other activities. For more than 20 years Bob delivered meals to countless Waltham seniors through the Meals on Wheels program and was also a proud member of the French-American Victory Club and the PFC John M. Sullivan, USMC VFW Post No. 10334, both in Waltham. He was a former Post commander and always enjoyed the camaraderie that the Post provided. In addition Bob loved playing cribbage and being one of the resident chefs that prepared their monthly Sunday breakfasts.\n\nBob is reunited in Heaven with his wife, Sheila A. (Dubie) White, and his brothers and sister, the late Richard and William White and Ruth C. “Babe” Tamoosh.\n\nHe leaves his sons, Robert J. White, Jr. of Waltham, and Richard J. White (Tina) of Hillsboro, Oregon; his grandchildren, Colin and Devyn White, and Michael Howell; his companion, Beverly McAndrews; and many nieces, nephews, and their families.\n\nFamily and friends will honor and remember Bob’s life by gathering for calling hours in The Joyce Funeral Home, 245 Main Street (Rte. 20), Waltham, on Friday, December 15th from 4 to 7 p.m. and again at 9 a.m. on Saturday morning before leaving in procession to Our Lady Comforter of the Afflicted Church, 880 Trapelo Road, Waltham where his Funeral Mass will be celebrated at 10 a.m. Burial will follow in Mount Feake Cemetery, Waltham.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorial donations may be made to the Waltham Council on Aging, 488 Main Street, Waltham, Massachusetts 02452."
