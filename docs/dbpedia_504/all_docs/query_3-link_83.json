        "text": "When reflecting on the life of Robert White, words such as hardworking, fun-loving, and dedicated come to mind, however, what will be his shining legacy was the love and devotion he showed his family each and every day. He could find the positive side in every situation, and he faced whatever came his way with strength and courage, which is to be admired. Robert was blessed to share much of his life with his true love. With Patricia he witnessed his family tree blossom to include the grandchildren and great-grandchildren who were the light of his life. He was steadfast and unwavering in his commitments, and he was there for whatever his children needed in ways both great and small. The memories Robert leaves behind will never be forgotten.\n\nDuring the first half of the 1940s the eyes of the nation were focused overseas as countless young servicemen and women were deeply entrenched in the perils of WWII. Rationing on common goods such as coffee, sugar, paper, and tin were in place, and victory gardens were planted to lessen the demand on the nation’s food supply. Amidst this eventful time was the year 1944 that was filled with great joy for William Lawrence and Mary June White as they were pleased to announce the birth of their healthy baby boy on September 24th. Born and raised in Detroit, Michigan, Robert Lawrence was one of nine children in his family, and he was joined in his family by his siblings, Barbara, Carolyn, Donna, Kenneth, William, Mary-Kathleen, Marjorie, and Michael.\n\nFor the most part Robert was a young boy of his generation. While a grade school student Robert decided that he wanted to be a priest, however, by the time he was a teen he decided that he wanted to settle down and have a family of his own. He deeply appreciated his own family and loved spending time at their summer cottage where he enjoyed driving a boat on the lake with siblings in tow! Robert attended school locally and played basketball. He went on to graduate from Holy Redeemer in 1962.\n\nAs a young man Robert was ready to embark on the next exciting phase that life had in store. He had numerous jobs, but the bulk of his career was spent with AAA of Michigan until he retired after 42 years of service. Robert was always smiling and ready to lend a hand.\n\nWhile he was busy establishing a career, Robert was in for exciting changes when he met the young girl of his dreams. Her name was Patricia and they met at AAA. Sparks flew right from the start and the couple soon found themselves deeply in love. With a desire to establish a life together they were married. The newlyweds spent their honeymoon at Walt Disney World despite the hurricane that was going on all around them. Together Robert and Patricia welcomed seven children including Colleen, Kathleen, Lisa, Tracy, Robert, Thomas, and Emily into their hearts and home. Pets were an important part of the White family such as their dogs, Shag, Tammy, and Precious and their fish tank filled with fish. While he was young Robert even had a pet opossum. Robert loved being a father, and he was there for his children whenever he was needed, even as they grew older and had families of their own.\n\nThroughout his life Robert was a man of many interests. He looked forward to annual summer vacations at Valley Plaza Resort in Midland, Michigan. Robert loved making candles, playing basketball with family, and playing card games like Uno, Euchre, and Poker. Robert enjoyed watching wheel of fortune and jeopardy with his wife, Patricia, since they always played against each other. Robert could also be found swimming laps in the pool, but not in the hot tub! When it came to sports Robert was loyal to all his hometown teams as he was an enthusiastic fan of the Tigers, Lions, and Red Wings. As his family and friends can attest, Robert was a grill master who was known to barbecue even in the dead of winter.\n\nWith unending kindness toward those around him, Robert White was a blessing to all who were within his reach. He was content in whatever came his way, and he fully embraced both the peaks and the valleys along his life’s journey. Robert was positive with a warm and approachable demeanor that drew others near with ease. He will be deeply missed and forever remembered.\n\nRobert Lawrence White died on January 12th. Robert’s family includes his wife, Patricia; 7 children, Colleen (Bryen) Gatica, Kathleen (Timothy) Sullivan, Lisa (James) Grondy, Tracy (Marcus) Samland, Robert (Bridget) White, Thomas White, and Emily White; 12 grandchildren; 1 great-grandchild; and 8 siblings. Family will receive friends Thursday, 2-9 p.m. with a rosary at 7 p.m. at Neely-Turowski Life Story Funeral Home, 45100 Warren Road (West of Sheldon). A mass of Christian burial will be held Friday in state ,10 a.m. with mass 10:30 at St. Mary Catholic Church in Wayne.
