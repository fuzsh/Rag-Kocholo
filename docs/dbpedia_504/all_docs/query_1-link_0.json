        "text": "American tenor and voice teacher (born 1936)\n\nRobert White (born October 27, 1936[1]) is an American tenor and voice teacher who has had an active performance career for eight decades.\n\nHe began performing Irish songs on the radio in 1942 at the age of six on programs such as Coast to Coast on a Bus and The Fred Allen Show; earning the nickname the \"little John McCormack\". In the late 1950s, he embarked on a career as a concert tenor, and achieved success as an exponent of early music by such composers as Handel, Bach, and Monteverdi during the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s. He has performed in concerts with several major orchestras, including the New York Philharmonic under Leonard Bernstein and the Philadelphia Orchestra under Eugene Ormandy, and has performed at the White House for Presidents John F. Kennedy and Jimmy Carter.\n\nIn the mid 1970s White returned to his roots as a performer of Irish songs, and achieved fame internationally as an 'Irish tenor,' drawing comparison to John McCormack; he even performed on programs for BBC television in honor of the late tenor. He continues to perform in concerts with a diverse repertoire ranging from Irish ballads to opera to contemporary art songs and works from the classical tenor canon. Several composers have written works specifically for him, including Mark Adamo, William Bolcom, John Corigliano, Lukas Foss, Stephen Hough, Libby Larsen, Lowell Liebermann, Gian Carlo Menotti, Tobias Picker, Ned Rorem, and David Del Tredici. He has made several recordings for RCA Victor Records, mainly of Irish songs and ballads, and has also recorded a diverse repertoire for Virgin Classics, EMI, and Hyperion.

In 1977, he performed Irish ballads on BBC program The James Galway Hour with the renowned flautist.[4] In a 1978 review in The New York Times historian Joseph Horowitz stated:\n\nThe Spirit of John McCormack was invoked more than a little at a wonderful recital by Robert White at the Metropolitan Museum. Mr. White, a singer whose work is well known and appreciated here, offered the sort of mixed bag of popular and concert repertoire that was a McCormack trademark.[40]\n\nIn 1979, White released the album Robert White Sings Beethoven with cellist Yo-Yo Ma, violinist Ani Kavafian, and Sanders on piano. The album features 16 settings of Irish, Scottish, Welsh, and English folksongs that Beethoven made at the request of George Thomson.[41] Later that year, he appeared as Alcibiade in the United States premiere of Agostino Steffani's La liberta contenta presented by the CMS at Alice Tully Hall.[42] He also was the featured performer in a 1979 BBC Television broadcast celebrating the 95th birthday of McCormack.

White was quoted as saying \"Just as I was going for a big high note, I felt myself swallow this bug. It went straight down, past the gag reflex. But I did let out the best high note of my career.\"[57] That same year, he performed a recital of songs that all used text by James Joyce at the Juilliard School.[58] In 1994, he was a feature soloist in a concert honoring philanthropist and opera singer Alice Tully, who was a close friend of White's, at Lincoln Center, along with the New York Philharmonic, soprano Jessye Norman, conductor James Levine, and other music luminaries.[59]\n\nIn 1996, White performed in recital at the Festival dei Due Mondi, and was invited by Mayor Rudy Giuliani to perform two arias by Handel for a ceremony presenting Kitty Carlisle the Handel Medal by the City of New York.[60][61] In 1997, he gave a concert of Renaissance music at the Metropolitan Museum of Art which featured works by composers John Dowland, Roland de Lassus, William Corkine, and John Bartlet.[62] In 1998, he was a featured soloist in a concert honoring composer John Corigliano's 60th birthday at the 92nd Street Y, and performed a concert of works by Poulenc at the Music Festival of the Hamptons.[63][64] In 1999, he performed in a memorial concert for his long time accompanist Samuel Sanders with whom he had performed since his days as an undergraduate student at Hunter College, and performed a concert of folksongs for Bargemusic.[65][66]\n\nIn 2000, White performed a concert of Irish songs and ballads with the Westchester Chamber Orchestra, and another concert of works by Beethoven for Bargemusic.[67][68] In 2001, he gave a recital at the Metropolitan Museum of Art featuring the world premieres of 19 art songs, including works by Mark Adamo, Milton Babbitt, William Bolcom, John Corigliano, Lukas Foss, Stephen Hough, Libby Larsen, Lowell Liebermann, Gian Carlo Menotti, Ben Moore, John Musto, Tobias Picker, Ned Rorem, William Jay Smith, David Del Tredici, and Brian Zeger; all of which were composed specifically for him.[69][70] In 2002, he appeared in concert with pianist Wu Han and violist Paul Neubauer with Bargemusic.[71] In 2004, he sang 'Danny Boy' for the closing of La Caravelle restaurant at the request of the owner.[72] In 2006, he gave a recital at the Morgan Library & Museum entitled Music in the Time of J.

In his review.

As Don’t Sit Under the Apple Tree (With Anyone Else but Me) proved, Mr. White is also—good to know—a first-rate whistler.\"[75]\n\nOther work as an educator and in media\n\n[edit]\n\nWhite taught music history on the faculties of Hunter College and the Manhattan School of Music during the 1970s.[1][4] He joined the faculty of the Juilliard School in 1991 where he still currently teaches.[76] In the 2000s. he worked as an interviewer of classical musicians for the radio station WQXR-FM.[77] In 2001, he sat on a panel for an event honoring comedian Fred Allen at the Museum of Television and Radio.[78] In 2002, he taught a masterclass with Barbara Cook at the Lincoln Center Festival entitled \"Fyodor Chaliapin and the Silent Screen\", which explored the way folk song has influenced art song.[79]"
