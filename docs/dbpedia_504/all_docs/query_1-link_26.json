        "text": "Robert White Johnson is a producer/writer whose songs and production have sold/ downloaded over 25 million records worldwide.\n\nA 35-year veteran of the Nashville music community, he has worked with and written for a variety of major recording artists including Celine Dion, penning her first worldwide hit, Where Does My Heart Beat Now, The Beach Boys, Lynyrd Skynyrd, . 38 Special and Van Zant. In addition Robert has co-written or produced 15 number 1 Contemporary Christian Music hits over the years and has also won a Dove Award, been nominated for 5 others and has been nominated for 2 Grammys.\n\nHis songs have also been included various major films and TV shows including, The Tonight Show, Late Night With David Letterman, Oprah, The Today Show, Saturday Night Live as well as many others.\n\nEarlier in his career as lead singer and main co-writer, he and his rock band RPM was first signed to EMI Records in Los Angeles, then to Warner Bros. Records in Burbank. He has also sung background vocals for various other CD projects including artists such as Faith Hill and Michael Bolton and has sung lead vocal on over 200 radio and TV commercials over the years.\n\nRobert has three daughters and resides in Hendersonville with his wife Mary and continues to work with various artists at his studio. In 1995 he formed his own music publishing/production company, RadioQuest. In 2008, independent record label radio1records was formed under RWJ's music group.\n\nProduction and Licensing\n\nHaving been a recording artist signed to major record deals, a successful songwriter, as well as a lead & background vocalist over the years, it's given me a unique perspective as a producer. I love what I do, and thoroughly enjoy working with artists/vocalists in helping them become the very best at what they do!\n\nWhether it's a full album/CD, or project of some kind, I can guide it from beginning to end. From helping write/co-write the material if need be, to booking all related tracking sessions, producing vocals, mixing and/or mastering, I've walked it many times, and I literally love the process.\n\nNashville, IMO, is also the greatest city on earth creatively speaking.\n\nThe amount of musical talent here is unequaled.\n\nOver the years I've been beyond fortunate to work with some of the most amazing musicians, and talent this business has to offer. I also consider most, if not all, the people I work with dear friends. We've grown up in this music city together, and so there's a lot of rich history that comes into play. I can't imagine working anywhere else on the planet, (and I have...) NY, LA, London, Atlanta, Orlando. Nothing compares to the creativity and vibe that emanates from here.\n\nRobert :-)\n\nI also like dreaming out loud so don't hesitate to call or write should you have a project you'd like to discuss! (contact info is below...)\n\nFor inquiries related to music production, and/or to obtain a mechanical or sync license, or . . .\n\nTo inquire about production or licensing of any Radioquest/Robert White Johnson songs please use contact formon this website."
