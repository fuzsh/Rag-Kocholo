        "text": "Robert Ralph White\n\nOctober 5, 1933 ~ July 24, 2021\n\nOur loving husband, father, and grandfather, Robert Ralph White, age 87, of North Ogden, passed away peacefully at home, surrounded by his family, on July 24, 2021. He was born on October 5, 1933, to Hilda E. Stevens and Charles A. White of Porterville, Utah. The family moved to Clearfield, Utah where he later attended Davis High School and then Weber State College. He was proud to serve in the U.S. Air Force as an air traffic controller during the Korean War from 1951 to 1955, where he was stationed at Hill Air Force Base and also in England. Shortly after, he felt impressed to serve a mission for his church and was assigned to Mexico City, Mexico where he served faithfully for two and a half years.\n\nWhile at Weber State College, he met his sweetheart, Carolyn Ruth Read, and they were soon married in the Salt Lake Temple on June 15, 1962. Together they had five children: Denise (Kyle) Johnson, Ken (Marci) White, Michelle (Lance) Staker, Wendy (Paul) Finley, and Amy (Jeff) Knowlton.\n\nDad worked as an engineer of electronics for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints early in his career and then became a business owner later in life. He was an inventor at heart and a \"jack-of-all-trades.\" He was a great storyteller to his children before bedtime and also authored several short stories during his later years. He found music very inspiring and always loved listening to his family play the piano and sing together. He enjoyed watching western movies, playing and inventing games, and making us all laugh.\n\nHe loved all sports, especially basketball and softball. He was selected to play basketball for Hill Air Force Base, where his team won the U.S. Northwest Conference Championship. He loved attending his children’s and grandchildren’s extra-curricular activities as well and was their biggest fan.\n\nDad was always thinking of others, which aided him in his role as a kind and caring husband, father, and grandfather, as well as various church callings from Bishop to Primary Teacher. He had a strong testimony of his Savior, Jesus Christ and was a dedicated member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He and mom served in the Ogden LDS Temple and also served an Ogden Inner-City Mission for the Church.\n\nBob's legacy lives on through his wife, 5 children, 17 grandchildren, 5 great-grandchildren, brother (Lee White), and sister, (Joan Carr). He was preceded in death by his parents and two brothers, (Don and Max).\n\nFuneral services will be held on Saturday, July 31, 2021 at 11 a.m. at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints Pleasant View 2nd Ward, 250 West Elberta Drive. Friends may visit with family on Friday from 6 to 8 p.m. and Saturday from 9:30 to 10:30 a.m. at the church. Interment, Ben Lomond Cemetery, 526 East 2850 North, North Ogden, Utah. Services entrusted to Lindquist's Ogden Mortuary."
