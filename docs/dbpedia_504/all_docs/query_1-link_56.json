        "text": "White, ROBERT, English composer, b. about 1530; d. November, 1574; was educated by his father, and graduated Mus. D., at Cambridge University, December 13, 1560. In March, 1561, he succeeded Dr. Tye as organist and master of the choristers at Ely cathedral, continuing in that office till 1566. He accepted a similar post at Chester cathedral in 1566, and took part in the Whitsuntide pageants during the years 1567-69. Such was his repute as a choir trainer that in 1570 he was appointed organist and master of the choristers of Westminster Abbey. Though an avowed Catholic he retained his post at Westminster Abbey from 1570 till his death. It is worth recording that during the same period, under Elizabeth, the musical services of the Chapel Royal, Westminster Abbey, and St. Paul’s Cathedral were directed by three Catholics, namely Farrant, White, and Westcott. White made his will on November 5, 1574, and in it he describes his father Robert White as still living. He left each of the choristers four pence. The high estimation in which he was held by his contemporaries may be judged by the distich which a pupil (in 1581) inscribed in the MS. score of White’s “Lamentations”:\n\n“Non ita moesta sonat plangentis verba prophetae Quam sonat authoris musica moesta mei.”"
