        "text": "Even Robert White knew that all good journeys must eventually come to an end. Robert Barrett White, Jr., age 69, of Cicero, passed away on Saturday, April 20, 2024.\n\nRobert was born in South Pittsburgh, TN, on November 30, 1954, to the late Robert and Marguerite (Robinson) White.\n\nRobert attended South Pittsburgh High School and after graduating attended the University of Tennessee where he graduated with a bachelor’s degree in engineering. Robert worked as a Senior Analyst for Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO). Robert enjoyed his job and made many friends within the workforce that became more like family. Robert loved to entertain and have a good time with his friends. If Robert was around, he always made sure others were having a good time. He enjoyed fast cars, boating, going to the beach, and recently picked up Golf. At a young age, he had a love for boats and restored three different live-on boats in California. He was a big UT Football fan and enjoyed both NASCAR & NHRA. In his spare time, he liked to work in his yard and do projects around the house. Robert lived every day to the fullest and will be missed by many.\n\nRobert is survived by his Son, Robert Barrett (Laurie) White, III of Birmingham, AL; Granddaughters, Maggie & Emerson White of Birmingham, AL; the Love of his life, Madison Moses of Cicero, IN; and best friend, Hernan (Tempie) Rodriguez of Cicero, IN.\n\nRobert was preceded in death by his parents, Robert & Marguerite White, and Brother, Jack White.\n\nRobert's wish was to be cremated and the family has entrusted his care to Hartley Funeral Homes.\n\nOnline condolences may be made at www.hartleyfuneralhomes.com."
