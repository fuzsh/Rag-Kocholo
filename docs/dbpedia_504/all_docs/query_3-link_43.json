        "text": "Robert White is a comedian, music teacher, and YouTuber who was the runner-up of Series 12 of Britain's Got Talent. He has Asperger's Syndrome and Dyslexia and is a quarter Welsh.\n\nIn his audition he initially made a joke about being dyslexic, mis-reading 'Rihanna' as 'RyanAir'. He then performed a song about computers, during which he made jokes about each of the Judges' online profiles. David remarked 'everything you said was hilarious', with Amanda adding 'you have funny bones, and your audition was fabulous'.\n\nIn the Semi-Finals, Robert joked that he was slightly nervous as when he was setting his keyboard up he had noticed that David were wearing the same tie as his ex boyfriend, before stating David were the name of his ex boyfriend, before seeming to correct himself and saying ‘not my ex boyfriend, my next boyfriend.’ He then sang an original sang on his keyboard about coming the judges, and the obsessions of Celebrity’s. Upon completing his song he left his keyboard and removed several shirts. Alesha commented that Robert had ‘taken his moment’ and improved since the auditions, before adding that he was her favourite act of the night. Simon remarked that he loved the element of belief that Robert were going to go ‘too far’ yet he never. He won the Public Vote and advanced directly onto the Final.\n\nIn the Final, Robert commented that he believed his real boyfriend would be there to support him, yet he couldn’t make it as he dumped him by Group email in 2010, before stating this way he could pretend he had a boyfriend. He then performed an original song about coming out as gay to his mother and accidentally meeting his father on a Grindr date, and Simon's age before concluding his song with the fact that the only BGT judge he wanted were David. He then went towards the judges desk and played a trumpet with a heart upon its end. David remarked that Robert were ‘such a funny man' before adding that he would be a fantastic winner for the show. Simon added that he loved Robert as an act due to the fact that he was ‘right on the edge'. White ultimately placed second to Lost Voice Guy.\n\nAfter BGT[]\n\nHe later launched his Primer 'Tank Top Tour' in 2018. He also released a new song for commemoration of World Autism Awareness Day."
