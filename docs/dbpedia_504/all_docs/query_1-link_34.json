        "text": "In this post, I thought that I would highlight an American operatic tenor who is still singing and teaching. I am going to post several pieces that Mr. White has done, and if the pieces are not in English, I will give a translation. For the pieces sung in English, Mr. White’s diction is so impeccable that you will understand the words as he sings them. Above all else, White eschews mannerisms. His style is straightforward, even if what he is singing is sentimental. He lets the music express itself through him. The aria from Le Roi d’Ys is especially gorgeous. Listen for the placement of the air and the tone. White has studied with many famous voice teachers, and he has learned that placement of the air and the tone makes all the difference.\n\nSince these jealous retainers will not be softened\n\nah, let me tell you of my suffering\n\nand my emotion!\n\nIn vain, my beloved,\n\ndo they think they can put me off:\n\nclose by your shut door\n\nI am determined to stay!\n\nThe stars may fade,\n\nnights replace days,\n\nwithout blaming you and without complaining\n\nI shall stay here forever!\n\nI know what a sweet soul you are,\n\nand the hour will soon come\n\nwhen the hand which now pushes me away\n\nwill reach out towards mine!\n\nDo not take too long\n\nto allow yourself to melt;\n\nIf Rozenn does not appear soon,\n\nAlas, I shall die!\n\nRobert White\n\nThe material concerning Mr. White’s background has been taken from his website https://robertwhitetenor.com\n\nMr. White is the son of the tenor Joseph White (known as The Silver Masked Tenor on early NBC radio). Mr White too was a child star on radio.\n\nHis classical career began in earnest in 1959 when he was tenor soloist at Carnegie Hall with Leonard Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic. He then joined Noah Greenberg’s New York Pro Musica as soloist, touring the US and Europe in highly acclaimed performances of Medieval and Renaissance music.\n\nOpera performances include works of Handel, Mozart, Smetana and Bizet with the Wexford Opera, the Monte Carlo Opera, and the Arizona Opera, among others. He premiered Paul Hindemith’s opera “The Long Chrismas Dinner” under the composer’s direction.\n\nMr. White has sung for five U.S. Presidents, Britain’s Queen Mother and Prince Charles, Monaco’s Royal Family, and Pope John Paul II. He has recorded extensively for RCA, EMI, Virgin, Sony, Arabesque and Hyperion with colleagues Yo-Yo Ma, Samuel Sanders, Placido Domingo, William Bolcom, Joan Morris, Graham Johnson, and Stephen Hough in music ranging from Beethoven to Richard Rodgers and Edouard Lalo.\n\nMr. White studied voice first in Rome, then with Sergius Kagen and Beverley Peck Johnson at the Juilliard School where he received his Masters Degree in Voice in 1968. He studied on full scholarship with the legendary Nadia Boulanger at Fontainebleau, France.\n\nAt the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, Mr. White sang ‘Songs of the 21st Century’ in a program of modern works written especially for him by some of America’s most celebrated composers, including Gian Carlo Menotti, William Bolcom, John Corigliano, Ned Rorem, Lowell Liebermann, Richard Hundley, Libby Larsen, Sheldon Harnick and Thomas Z. Shepard, Ben Moore, and Milton Babbitt.\n\nTo this day, White maintains a highly successful singing and teaching career. He taught voice at the Manhattan School of Music from 1986 to 1990, and has been a member of the Juilliard Voice Faculty since 1991. He is also on the CUNY Doctoral Voice Faculty."
