Some of his high school friends nicknamed him White Rat' and still called him 'Rat' for many years after graduation. Bobby enjoyed working on the reunion committees to make certain the classmates stayed in touch. Stock car racing was a passion of his from the early dirt track days up through the modern Nascar circuit. The one thing he loved most of all was spending time with his family.\n\nBobby was active with the Jaycees for several years and was a past president of Sardis Swim and Racquet Club. His career was in sales for Compugraphic and later with Autologic where he sold printing equipment to the major newspapers in the eastern states. His friends teased that he could sell ice to an Eskimo because of his skilled salesmanship. After retiring in 1993, he launched a pay-phone business with one of his friends and enjoyed much success. After cell phones came prevalent, he sold that business and retired.\n\nThe family will have a private celebration of life on Roberts birthday."
