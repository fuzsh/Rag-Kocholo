        "text": "It is rather unlikely that he had or used a middle name of Hungerford. Middle names were extremely rare until the seventeenth century.\n\nIn Robert White [of Yaxley]'s will he names the children of his son John for specific bequests. In fact Robert's son John died two years after his father. Robert's grandchildren's names were Robert, Richard, John, Margaret and Johanna. The eldest (surviving) son Robert White was 14 years old when his father John died in 1470 (Inquisition post mortem 9 Edw.4). He was summoned by writs dated 5 Jun 1483 to 'furnish himself' to receive Knighthood at the intended coronation of Edward 5th on 22 June. The ceremony [of coronation] did not take place, but W A Shaw (The Knights of England 1905) includes Robert White as entitled to be called Sir Robert White KB created June 1483 [backdated from coronation of King Richard III? He did try to maintain what continuity he could].\n\nRobert - \"He was age 14 at the time of his father's death. His wardship was granted in 1469 to Thomas St. Leger, esquie of the body, and Nicholas Gainsford, Esq. He was granted license to enter his father's lands 24 Feb. 1481. In 1483 King Edward V charged him to \"prepare & furnishe\" himself to receive knighthood at the King's coronation, an event that never took place. Gainsford, daughter of his guardian, Nicholas Gainsford, Esquire (d. 1498) of Carshalton, Surrey, admitted Lincoln's Inn, 1452/3 King's servitor and Usher of the Chamber, 1461-1476, usher to Elizabeth Wydeville, queen consort for King Edward IV, 1476-1498, sheriff of Surrey and Sussex, Knight of the Shire (M.P.) for Odiham Castle, 1461-1486 and his wife, Margaret Sydney of Surrey.\" (Source: New England Historical and Genealogical Register Vol. 154)\n\n\"Genesis of the White Family\" is FRAUDULENT. It should NEVER be cited as a source.\n\n\"14 years old in [the ninth regnal year of Edward IV]\", i.e. 1469-70, ergo born circa 1455.\n\nHe was a Knight of the Bath"
