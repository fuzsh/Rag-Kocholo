        "text": "Robert White, 63, died peacefully Monday afternoon, his wife Linda by his side, lying in front of his windows overlooking Casco Bay.\n\nBorn June 2, 1944 in Surbiton, Surrey, England, he attended the Surbiton Grammar School. He worked for Dunlop who gave him a scholarship to Birmingham University where he trained as a cost and works accountant. Afterwards he was relocated to Zambia. He came to the U.S. as a member of a trade delegation and then entered the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania from which he graduated with an MBA.\n\nWhile at Wharton, he met and courted Linda Disston Clifford while \"studying\" at the library where she worked. They married in 1971, and in 1975 son Stephen appeared on the scene.\n\nRobert began his career with Denby USA, a pottery merchandiser, and worked out of Cincinnati, Ohio. He was later appointed to its Board and relocated back to London. Subsequently he and Linda purchased a unit of Denby and ran it for ten years as Medallion and Claridge House. They sold the business and moved to Division Point on Chebeague Island twenty-four years ago.\n\nRobert was very active in Chebeague affairs over the years. He was instrumental in the construction of both the Library and the Recreation Center, was a member of the Tennis Club, and served on the Board of the Golf Club.\n\nIn 2003, he and Linda moved to Bargemon, France, and renovated a 13th century chateau with sweeping views. When diagnosed with cancer in 2006, he decided to move back to New England for medical treatment in Boston and the care and love from the Chebeague community.\n\nDonations in his memory may be made to the Island Council (memo: \"Cynnie's Group\") to help establish and support hospice care on Chebeague.\n\nAfter the 2001 Polar Plunge\n\nJuly 7, 2007\n\nDecorating Golf Club Trees for Christmas\n\nClick here for more images of the wonderful celebration of Robert White's Life"
