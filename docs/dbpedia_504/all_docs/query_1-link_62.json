        "text": "Mar. 28, 2024 - Pastor Brian Hamer\n\nJerusalem, my happy home, when shall I come to thee?\n\nWhen shall my sorrows have an end? Thy joys, when shall I see?\n\n– Sixteenth-century Hymn\n\nJerusalem has been the city of deep wailing and great rejoicing for thousands of years. The Lamentations of Jeremiah are a case in point, and the angst of the prophet’s lament has not been lost on composers for the church. Sixteenth-century Europe, for instance, was blessed with settings by the finest composers of the day, including Alfonso Ferrabosco (the elder), Thomas Tallis, Antoine Brumel, Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, and Robert White. Since this is an anniversary year for White (c. 1538—1574), please join me in a lament over the old Jerusalem with his setting of Lamentations 1:8-13 for five voices.\n\nWhite was a Roman Catholic composer in England, often mentioned in the same breath with John Sheppard, Christopher Tye (whose daughter he married), Thomas Tallis, Robert Parsons, and Gyles Farnaby. He served three major posts as church musician: Ely Cathedral (please see the image above), Chester Cathedral, and Westminster Abbey. Choral works by White that are fitting for Lutheran worship include several settings of the Mass, Latin motets (including two settings of Lamentations, one for five voices and one for six voices), and about half a dozen English anthems. David Mateer and Irwin Spector describe his two sets of Lamentations as “particularly fine” and “a high point of Elizabethan choral music” (Grove Music Online).\n\n​\n\nThe context for singing the Lamentations is Matins for the Triduum, that is, the three-day liturgy that encompasses Maundy Thursday evening through the dawn of Easter Sunday. Deeply penitential in nature, you can see as you survey the biblical verses below the video link how the strength of the law permeates Jeremiah’s message. Writing in Hebrew strophes (similar to hymn stanzas), the prophet looks ahead to Babylonian captivity and the desolation of Jerusalem. She had sinned grievously and become filthy (v. 8), was bound for a dramatic fall (v. 9), was susceptible to the enemy from Babylon (v. 10), and would soon trade earthly treasures for food (v. 11). These verses recall the Good Friday reproaches (improperia), wherein the voice of Christ, spoken by the pastor, calls God’s people to repentance:\n\n​Pastor:\n\nThus says the Lord:\n\n\"What have I done to you, O my people,\n\nAnd wherein have I offended you?\n\nAnswer me.\n\nFor I have raised you up out of the prison house of sin and death,\n\n\"And you have delivered up your Redeemer to be scourged.\n\nFor I have redeemed you from the house of bondage,\n\nAnd you have nailed your Savior to the cross.\n\nO my people!\"\n\nCongregation:\n\nHoly Lord God,\n\nHoly and mighty God,\n\nHoly and most merciful Redeemer;\n\nGod eternal, leave us not to bitter death.\n\nO Lord, have mercy!\n\nAt verse 12, however, the text shifts to the voice of Christ, “All who you pass by [O vos omnes] look and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow.” These words foreshadow the voice of Christ from the cross, as He suffered outside old Jerusalem and inaugurated the era of the new Jerusalem. The final verse of this setting continues the lament from the cross, so that these verses naturally lead the hearer from the service of foot-washing on Maundy Thursday to the veneration of the cross on Good Friday and into a period of waiting in quiet faith at the Easter Vigil, anticipating the news of Jesus’ resurrection.\n\nAs with most motets of this period, the biblical verses are set to imitative music, with each voice equal in importance and the music changing as the text changes. So far this is conventional for the high Renaissance. But there is a unique feature to White’s setting Lamentations that give it an enduring quality beyond some motets of this era. The verses below are acrostic, that is, each verse starts with a sequential letter of the Hebrew alphabet (Heth, Teth, Iod, etc.). These literary markers are probably not intended to be set to music, but some Renaissance composers included them. Peter Phillips summarizes the effect:\n\nThe musical changes yet again for the corporate cry (perhaps drawn from the Liturgy of the Triduum?), “Jerusalem, Jerusalem, turn to the Lord, your God.”\n\n​\n\nI hesitate to offer a track of nearly twenty-minutes of music in Latin, but you might find yourself immersed in the music and the message as you follow along with the text and let White be your musical and expressive guide. After listening to this work, you might agree with one scholar who placed it “among the most remarkable works bequeathed to us by an English composer of the 16th century” (The Musical Times 67:1004, p. 894).\n\nHETH\n\nJerusalem sinned grievously;\n\ntherefore she became filthy;\n\nall who honored her despise her,\n\nfor they have seen her nakedness;\n\nshe herself groans\n\nand turns her face away.\n\nTETH\n\n9 Her uncleanness was in her skirts;\n\nshe took no thought of her future;\n\ntherefore her fall is terrible;\n\nshe has no comforter.\n\n“O Lord, behold my affliction,\n\nfor the enemy has triumphed!”\n\nIOD\n\n10 The enemy has stretched out his hands\n\nover all her precious things;\n\nfor she has seen the nations\n\nenter her sanctuary,\n\nthose whom you forbade\n\nto enter your congregation.\n\nJerusalem, Jerusalem, turn to the Lord, your God.\n\nCAPH\n\n11 All her people groan\n\nas they search for bread;\n\nthey trade their treasures for food\n\nto revive their strength.\n\n“Look, O Lord, and see,\n\nfor I am despised.”\n\nLAMED\n\n12 “Is it nothing to you, all you who pass by?\n\nLook and see\n\nif there is any sorrow like my sorrow,\n\nwhich was brought upon me,\n\nwhich the Lord inflicted\n\non the day of his fierce anger.\n\n​\n\nMEM\n\n13 “From on high he sent fire;\n\ninto my bones he made it descend;\n\nhe spread a net for my feet;\n\nhe turned me back;\n\nhe has left me stunned,\n\nfaint all the day long.\n\nJerusalem, Jerusalem, turn to the Lord, your God.\n\n​Upon hearing White’s Lament for five voices, one scholar said, “Sad as the mourning Prophet’s words fall on the ear, more sad to me the music’s tones appear” (The Musical Times 67:1004, p. 894). That is to say, the Lamentations demonstrate White’s ability “to manipulate large musical structures while at the same time exploiting the expressive potential of the text” (Grove Music Online). And this expressive potential is rightly used in the service of the law to bring sinners in the new Jerusalem to repentance, similar to Jesus’ own lament over His beloved city in Matthew 23:\n\n​But the Lord has not abandoned Jerusalem! The joy of Easter Sunday awaits, with the full consolation of the gospel for those who have been crushed by the full strength of the law. The new Jerusalem of all believers—Jewish and Gentile, living and departed—has dropped down from heaven in Christ, who rejoices over her this Eastertide with celestial joy, as depicted in John’s vision in Revelation 21:"
