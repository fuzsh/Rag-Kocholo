Eve feared her past was coming back to haunt her. Grace was nervous about asking John to take a blood test. An inconsolable Theresa committed suicide by jumping in the icy cold river. Friends and family feverishly raced to save her. Theresa ended up in hell, where she came face-to-face with Julian and made a life-altering pact. Kay and Miguel's bond grew as he struggled to understand what was going on with \"Charity.\" The real Charity thawed out and came to a few realizations before Zombie Charity put her back into a deep freeze. Ivy and Rebecca continued to threaten and torment each other. After being pulled from the river, Theresa awakened to the terrifying realization of what she'd done. Pilar comforted her daughter and encouraged her to do what was right. Julian appeared to Theresa and tried to persuade her to go through with the plan.\nMusic:  \nCartoon Bank Heist - Doug Maxwell, Media Right Productions   • Cartoon Bank Heist – Doug Maxwell, Me...   \nSoar by Scott Buckley https://soundcloud.com/scottbuckleyCr.

Kay desperately tried to save Miguel from certain death as he began to make love to Zombie Charity. Kay started a fire outside his bedroom window to create a distraction, but the fire grew out of control and the Lopez-Fitzgerald house was quickly engulfed in flames. Kay feared for Miguel, who was trapped inside with Zombie Charity. Ivy pressured Eve to change the DNA results. The test results arrived and Eve prepared to read them. She was interrupted when Sam and Grace received a call that Pilar's house was on fire. As everyone rushed to Pilar's, Ivy tried to convince Eve to lie.

Luis went on a date with Beth but was plagued by memories of Sheridan. Brian risked his life to save Sheridan from a kitchen fire. Faith's spirit asked Timmy for help in saving Charity. Tabitha warned Timmy of the dire consequences for Charity if he used the spell book to get rid of Zombie Charity. Meanwhile, unaware of the consequences, Kay chanted a spell from the book to destroy the zombie.
