        "text": "Yeah the show needs more vets at the top. Lindsey and Galen are fine and so is Emily but the use of Mueller, Bellani, and Wystrach needs to be lessended IMO.\n\nI know some don't like Theresa but she is someone that needs to be on everyday. She really does have the biggest fanbase on the show other then Shuis and Mac and Galen have had time off so Lindsey has had to be on all these shows to carry the show. I just wish the ET crap was eliminated because Jaresa is so much better to watch.\n\nPassions doesn't have enough good actors to spread the wealth. I agree that the vets need to be featured but the Theresa character needs to be featured alot. Again, I can see those that don't like her saying she shouldn't be but she has a huge fanbase, just like Shuis needs to be featured alot as well. As long as they are written properly, it isn't a problem but right now it sucks because the stories suck for the most part.\n\nShows like Days can balance it out because they have a strong history and cast but Passions doesn't have that luxury. The few good actors and character they have need to be featured alot. Maybe not everyday but still they need to be there on most days. Theresa, Luis, Sheridan, Fancy, Paloma, Julian, Eve, Tabitha, Endora, Kay, Sam, Ivy, Whitney, Simone, Jared, Pilar, Gwen, Rebecca, and Ethan (who isn't horrible acting-wise) are all the characters that need to be featured prominently and have good enough actors behind them to tolerate them being on all the time Those are the characters that should be prominently featured with Theresa, Julian, Eve, Luis, and Sheridan being the leaders as they have the biggest fanbases.\n\nWell Cheap, more people love her then hate her and there are also more people that tolerate her then hate her. Like I said, she does have the biggest fanbase next to Evian and Shuis fans and I am not even counting those fans that like her as a part of the ET coupling.\n\nI usually don't advocate any one one person or persons dominating a show but in Passions case it is necessary. When most of the show is made up of average to below average actors and half of the manjor characters are recasts, it is necessary to fill the screen with familiar faces and with the characters that are the most popular. Passions has lost enough fans as it is so people like Theresa, Luis, Sheridan, Fancy, Paloma, Julian, Eve, Tabitha, Endora, Kay, Sam, Ivy, Whitney, Simone, Jared, Pilar, Gwen, Rebecca, and Ethan need to featured alot with Theresa, Sheridan, Luis, Julian, Eve, and even Fancy leading the charge. This is coming from someone who doesn't even currently like Shuis but recgonizes there importance to the show. The character of Fancy has grown immensely in popularity so I feel her increasing screentime is justified.\n\nI am not saying Theresa needs to be on 30 times out of 30 episodes every month but she is fine being the one at the top of the heap followed by Shuis and other characters I mentioned. I do think Lindsey Hartley should get a break sometime in the next few weeks but, like I said, in many ways the show thrives off her. Sorry to those that don't like her but she is now at the center of the show as Mrs. Crane and she drives story. If written properly with better story, it would be much better but it's Passions. Yo ucan't expect too much. Yes I am pro-Theresa but even if I despised her with a passion I would recognize this. Anyone that watches the show and knows the fans of the show as a whole would recgonize this."
