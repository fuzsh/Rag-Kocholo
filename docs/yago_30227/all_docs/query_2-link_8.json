        "text": "Until recently, Charity was the ever-sheltered only child of single mother Faith Standish. A visit to a carnival last summer changed all of that. Charity met Miguel Lopez Fitzgerald, and through him, learned of a woman named Grace Bennett who could be her aunt. It turned out Grace WAS her aunt, but before she could introduce Grace to her mother Faith in person, there was a horrible fire at their small home in Castleton (set by Tabitha), and Faith is believed to have perished. Charity ended up in Harmony, and for many months, couldn't remember who she was, or the strong ties that bound her to Miguel.\n\nNow that Charity has her memory back, she has a new problem. Lately, she's been having horrible visions. They come in two varieties: deathly predictions (usually of Miguel, usually run through with a ski pole), and psychic smut (of Eve and Julian, as a result of a close-by bird statue). Lately, she has begun having a new series of visions -- visions where Miguel professes his love to her cousin Kay, who she is beginning to realise has been in love with Miguel since long before she entered the picture. A recent near-miss tragedy during the avalanche was the first time she and Miguel professed their love out loud to each other.\n\nThe newest problem in Charity's sphere is her cousin, Kay. Thanks to Kay's scheme at the prom, Charity became halved -- one half good, one half bad. Evil Charity almost succeeded in killing Kay and Miguel, but luckily the two escaped...barely. Evil Charity finally met her doom in the mineshaft, but unluckily for Charity, she didn't have a lot of time to enjoy her freedom, and her love with Miguel. Thanks to Kay selling her soul to Hecuba, Charity spent some time burning in the fires of Hell. They finally managed to save her, only now Kay has a new hurdle to overcome...Charity and Miguel have announced their plans to marry!\n\nCharity and Miguel are unofficially engaged, with plans to make it permanent once they both reach 18. After a trip to Warlock Island, Charity has retained the uncanny ability to talk to trees, and often gets advice from the tree in the Bennett's front yard."
