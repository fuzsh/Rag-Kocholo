        "text": "Luis is the second oldest son of Pilar and Martin. Luis was very involved in school activities and wanted to be a lawyer. However these dreams never became a reality after his father disappeared when he was young. Antonio took care of Luis until he graduated high school and then Antonio also left. In order to support his mother and other siblings, Luis started working right after school to provide for them and play the father role. For fear he would treat his girlfriend, Beth Wallace, the same way, he ended that relationship as well. He later on became a cop in Harmony. Luis met Sheridan after becoming a cop after she crashed into his police car twice. Luis was also a youth director at the community center and this is where Sheridan did her community service. They went on a few dates together, but nothing serious ever became of them. Sheridan then began to date his best friend, Hank Bennett, and Luis went back to Beth. However his interest in Sheridan was still too strong and things ended again with Beth. Luis and Sheridan still had feelings for each other and eventually he was assigned to be Sheridan's bodyguard by the FBI. Sadly, Sheridan was shot soon after they finally admitted their feeling to each other. Luis always felt that Sheridan was his soul mate and was devastated, but then he found out she was really alive and in the hospital. The each told each other that they were still in love.\n\nTheresa and Ethan's engagement was announced and Luis passed along his blessings. He and Sheridan finally made love and starting making plans for their future and engagement. The next obstacle stopped the plans, as Sheridan was presumed dead. Hank tried his best to help Luis as he was even more devastated and his life started going down hill. He was always on the lookout for Sheridan. Hank set Luis and Beth back up again because he knew how well their relationship was going before. Luis also found out that his brother Antonio was still alive but not ready to come back to Harmony. As time passed, Luis and Beth continued on with their relationship and got engaged, although he never gave up on the search for Sheridan.\n\nSheridan showed back up in town, but unfortunately for Luis, she had gotten engaged to Antonio. Luis and Sheridan continued a secret relationship behind Antonio (who they found out had a life-threatening illness) and Beth. Luis finally had enough and told Sheridan that she either had to choose to be with just him or that he would move on with his life. She ended up choosing to stay with Antonio, so he asked Beth to marry him. The wedding happened and Sheridan and Antonio were now wed, however Beth and Luis were not. Both of the couples stayed at the same hotel that night and Luis and Sheridan met in the hallway. She was supposed to have gone to the courthouse to elope the night before the wedding, but Antonio did not receive his medication and had to be taken to the hospital. Luis said that instead of seeing Antonio on these experimental drugs he would rather see him dead.\n\nLuis was never able to get over Sheridan. Even when he found out she was pregnant, he was happy at first but then assumed that Antonio may be the father. Beth also became pregnant around the same time. They decided that they were going to raise both of the children without Antonio or Beth in the picture. Luis never found out for sure who the father of Sheridan�s child was, but grew to believe it was his. Then another fateful event happened to Sheridan, she was kidnapped. Together, Antonio and Luis found her but not her child and they finally had to accept that the child had died.\n\nSheridan decided that she was going to remain with Antonio, which Luis would not accept. He continued to try to win her over and eventually Antonio died. Now Luis and Sheridan could be together but arguments about who Marty's mother really was started driving them apart. Luis did not believe that it was really Sheridan's child, but the DNA tests proved that it was. Sheridan was upset with Luis for not believing her and at the same time, Beth took Marty and left town. During his search for Beth, his family found out that he had died.\n\nLater on, Luis was found to be alive in Hawaii at Otto Krause's house. He was on the road to recovery and finally asked Sheridan to marry him. He then found out that Sheridan had already married the man that saved his life, Chris Boothe and that she was going to remain faithful to her marriage vows to him and raise his child and her new baby that she was pregnant with, together. Luis decided to go look for Marty in Rome, but started to form an interest in Sheridan�s niece, Fancy Crane."
