        "text": "HAPPINESS seems comically out of reach for the women on ABC’s monster hit, “Desperate Housewives,” but of all the discontented characters on the show, Gabrielle Solis, played by the sexy Eva Longoria, seems to have found the most creative way to dry her tears.\n\nMarried to a virile dolt of a man, Gabrielle has filled her unhappy hours with the erotic attentions of her dopey teenaged gardener. She’s television’s new Mrs. Robinson. Gabrielle and John do it on the expensive carved table at her place; they do it in his bedroom when mom’s out on errand. Yes, it’s cheap, but nobility has gotten Gabrielle and her desperate sisters nowhere – and they’re sick of it.\n\n“Desperate Housewives” owes part of its success to the ensemble acting of its talented cast, most of whom had previously starred in successful prime-time series over the last two decades. Among such solid television professionals as Marcia Cross, Teri Hatcher, Felicity Huffman and naughty Nicollette Sheridan, Longoria is the breakout star. She’s had the perfect training for Gabrielle’s adulterous afternoons. A veteran of soap operas – she’s done everything from “The Young and the Restless” to “Beverly Hills 90210” – Longoria excels at those soap trademarks: the bedroom eyes, the meaningful glance, the pregnant pause. She knows how to look at a single-stem red rose as if it’s the frigging Hope Diamond.\n\nBut nothing she did on daytime has prepared her for “Housewives.” “Gabrielle has no moral boundaries. She can go every which way,” Longoria says. “This show is ten times smarter than any soap I’ve ever seen.”\n\nHer boy toy, played by Jesse Metcalfe, got his start on soaps, too. He played the improbably named Miguel Lopez-Fitzgerald on NBC’s “Passions.” Metcalfe and Longoria may have their seductive maneuvers down, but viewers will get to see them squirm this week when Mrs. Solis faces a nine-year-old blackmailer who has seen her libido in action.\n\nMeanwhile, Gabrielle’s suburban soul sisters have their own troubles. Susan (Teri Hatcher) just can’t seem to make a good impression on Mike (James Denton), the other available single man on Wisteria Lane. This week, she locks herself out of the house – wearing only a towel – while in the middle of an argument with her ex-husband. As the ex drives off, her towel gets caught in the car door, just as Mike walks by.\n\n—\n\nDESPERATE HOUSEWIVES\n\nSunday, 9 p.m., ABC"
