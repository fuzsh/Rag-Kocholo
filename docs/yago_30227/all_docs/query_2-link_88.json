        "text": "Holy crap- i hanv't undated this in a LONG LONG time- GD it-- i though that this show moved slow, but a lot of crap has happened, so just i dont know- you can get some hostory here too- the newer stuff is all at the bottom:)\n\nOK, so, this is my little trubute to Passions-- theres more-- i made up a drinking game, and there's a few things on passions in the TOP 10 Page ~~ also, soon i'll get some quotes from it, and it'll rock even more- it's already FAR superior to lori's crappy Dawsons Creek page:) but for now..... Passions is my(emily) favorite show, it just rules! It's about all these people who live in Harmony, Massachusetts, and it rules-- they have witches, cops, rich people, hot people, poor people, dumb people, little people, sex, drugs, affairs, boats sinking, bitches-- so bacically it's your average soap, but this one just rules and it's not far-fetched ya hoe(lori)- Passions rules!! It's way better than Dawsons Creek, which quite frankly I think is getting to be quite the bore! *yawn* Also on Passions, there's Hot Luis, well, just Luis, but he's hot! like a 15 on a 10 scale, and his girlfriend Sheridan(the hotel has a 't' so shut-it!) who is also hot, but i dont swing that way!! You know how cool show's go though- so read up about it, cause it's really a great show!\n\nok, so look at that cast- could you ask for more?? P.S-- You all are gonna have to thank Lori for this not looking like dump, because I'm a shit-head, and she told me how to make it pretty. So anyways... How awesome do they look? I love this show! Ok, so here's the deal with passions- it started like June of 1999, and I've been watching it forever- and trust me, as slow as the storylines may seem, they have actually gotten really far! It's on NBC(channel 4 here) at 2:00(eastern standard time) It's is set in a small town called Harmony located in Massachusetts(i already said that) and the town is kinda like me and Lori, we look all sweet and innocent and all nice to people who don't know us, but man- we are like the spawn of satan! Kinda like Harmony- it's this cute little town, and everyone who goes there likes it, but the people who live there are all sluts and liars, and they all have these secrets - IT RULES! Ivy is my favorite because she is the bigges bitch ever, and it rules- she's always got some comment or funny scarstic remark- kinda like me- so she rules! Then there's Sheridan- who is everyone's heroine, so she's definatley up there as one of the best, but the deal with her is that she's so nice and sweet that you have to love her. Even though since she was buried alive, she's becoming quite the little devil-so yea- she rules too! There are also lots and lots of love triangles, most of which have been settled,so i guess that there aren't lots and lots of them, but all well, but there's cool stuff like that. Basically, right now, theres lots of crap goin down on the show, and since this isn't a Passions Web Page, it's mine and lori's web page with a little place for passions, you can find out someplace else. But Luis and Sheridan rule, and Sam needs to hook up with Ivy! I'm tellin ya what- Passions rocks, so you'd better start watching it if you don't already, cause it's the new Days Of Our Lives! On the real though-- I'm foreseeing years and years of Passions to follow! The basic families involved in the show are:\n\nTHE CRANES- *aka: the assholes who rule the joint* they live in a huge house, and basically rule all of Harmony, and control everyone there, and I want to be in that family! They are such a hot family too, look at them over there!--> well, minus Gwen, and that's the Cranes! They're mad rich, and terribly disfunctional- there were 2, Catherine, and Alistar, they had 2 kids, Sheridan and Julian, Catherine died, and everyone grew up!- Now Julian is married to Ivy, and they popped out lots of kids and Sheridan is doing Luis, but they aren't married(yet)\n\nBasically the main players are:\n\n-- Ivy(Kim Johnson Ulrich)*aka: super-bitch* She's the distressed wife of Julian and masssive the bitch of the town, homewrecker and all! She's my fave! I want to be her!\n\n-- Julian(Ben Marsters)*aka: big old perv* He's the horny husband of Ivy(duh) and a 40 year old pervert, he's funny, but mean\n\n-- Ethan(Travis Schuldt) *aka: dumb-ass* He's really Sam Bennets son, but he's still a Crane to me. He's engaged to Theresa, but very nieve(i dont even know how to spell it)\n\n-- Alistar *aka: big giant hands* He's the mysterious father, and ruler of Crane Empires, the big cheese, and the jerk who wants to whack everyone! You never see his face just his hands, hence, big giant hands:)\n\nFINALLY\n\n-- Sheridan(McKenzie Westmore)*aka: hot-lips (apparently)* She's hot, nice, sweet, been around the world, survived hit-men, dated drug dealers, survived being buried alive, and everyone's heroine! and why not? Who could ask for more? If I cared, I'd want to be like her, and not Ivy\n\n***** ok, so this isn't even a family anymore-- it's basically just julian and alistar now, cause Sheridan is dead(not really, but i'll get into it later) and Julian divorced Ivy, cause she is a liar and passed Ethan off as his kid, and he clearly was not! So now Ivy's in a wheelchair rolling around in the Crane mansion even though she doen't belong there-- oh...in the wheelchair b/c she was struck by lightening trying to help Sammy out...And so he married Theresa(julian did...not sam...long story) annuled that marraige, and then married Rebecca(who's quite trampy, but cool) and then now it's him, rebecca and Gwen, but now someone shot him and he's dead-- in a bucket of fish(i know- grose rihgt?)\n\nTHE LOPEZ-FITZGERALDS *aka: the poor folk who always look like a million dollars*-- Here, there were also 2, Martin and Pilar, terribly in love, until Martin suddenly dissapeared! DUN DUN DUN! They had a whole bundle of kids, but only 3 are on the show.\n\nBasically the players are:\n\n-- Pilar(Eva Tamargo Lemus)*aka: theresitas momma* She's the emotionally and psyscally drained wife of Martin who squoze out some kids and makes them pay for stuff.\n\n-- Theresa(Lindsay Korman)*aka: never-stops-crying* She's the kid that pilar squoze out, and is now engaged to Ethan, she never stops crying.\n\n-- Luis(Galen Gering)*aka: my soon-to-be husband(jk)* He's hot! Thats about all, no, just kidding, he's a cop who fell hopelessly in love with Sheridan, and kept being dumb about it, but they hooked up and it's all good!\n\n-- Miguel(Jesse Metcalf)*aka: love sick* He's Charity's man, and she has got him whipped, he might as well not be in the lopez-fitzgerald clan because he's always with his chickie:)\n\n********* okay, so now, Pilar is still all chillin, and Luis is heartbroken b/c Sheridan is dead(again, i'll get into it later) but really she was found lost at sea by 'Brian' aka: ANTONIO LOPEZ-FITZGERALD!!!!! I KNOW!!!! so now he's in love w/ sheridan, but she's got the amnesia(of course!) so now he's back in the picture, but not for real yet cause he's only talked to the fam on the phone, and Luis was all like \"you bastard- leave us alone!\"\n\nTHE BENNETS *aka: the most disgustinly loving family ever* These people, I'm telling you what- it's like 7th Heaven in this house! It's pretty bad! There is Grace, who is currently mad at Sam, her hubby, and they have 3 kids, Noah(but he isnt on the show), Jessica, and Kay, and the niece Charity whose momma died.\n\nand they are:\n\n--Grace~~(Dana Sparks) ok, no nicknames anymore, she could kill all these people with her thumbs, but doesnt even know it! I hate it! She was in a fire, and got amnesia(of course her memory never came back) and Sam saved her and they fell hopelessly in love, sap sap! She doesn't deserve him though! He's too good to her! Then she popped out some kids and live happlily (sorta, it's all going to hell *literally* now\n\n--Sam~~(James Hyde) No nickname either, they are kinda dumb anyways, He's hot, and a cop too, Cheif of the Harmony PD, he had an affair with Ivy and is the father of Ethan, Grace found out, and she's not happy, but he's still hot!\n\n--Kay~~(Deanna Wright) She's pretty trampy and it rules! She is always trying to seduce Miguel, but it never works, and she currently has no soul, but shes doin alright\n\n--Jessica~~(Jade Harlow) She's a little annoying, but rocks anyways! She's always trying to ruin Kay's plan to seduce Miguel away from Charity. That's pretty much her story-line\n\n--Charity~~(Molly Stanton) oh jeez! this chick and her damn premonitions- they never stop! It's so dumb- her mom was Faith (graces twin sister who died in the fire) and now she lives with them\n\n******** whoooo-- not too loving anymore- ok, Noah is still gone, but Ivy, who claimed to be over Sam, lied and hired this guy David Hastings to pretend to be Graces wife from the first 20 years that she can't remeber (because she, too, has the amnesia, hell i didn't know that amnesia was this common) but he's lieing, so when they told Kay, Jessica and Charity all this, Kay went back into psycho bitch mode(which rules) and froze Charity in ice and made a zombie of her, and has the zombie being a massive bitch to Miguel so they are gonna break up now, and now Ivy said that David's son is his son w/ Grace, which is a big fat lie!-- so the shit hit the fan!\n\nTHE RUSSELS *aka: very messed up* OK, so this fam is worse than the Cranes, the sisters are gonna kill each other, the mom is a hoochie, the dad a lunatic, the one daughter is dating her half-brother, and the other one is totaly obliviuos to it all!\n\nConsists of:\n\n--T.C.~~(Rodney Van Johnson)He's the frustrated tennis player who lost his game due to an accident(caused by julian*why he hates him*) so he has way too high of hopes for his daughter, but it really good at saying that he knows whats going on when he really knows nothing.\n\n--Eve~~(Tracey Ross)She's the fluze-turned-prude mother who had an affair with Julian and got knocked up, but couldn't tell her hubby T.C because he hates Julian and he would kill him, but the kid died(suposedly)! So now she has cleaned up and become a doctor and tired to put her past behind her. Please!\n\n--Whitney~~(Brook Kerr) the tennis player who is dating her half-brother(chad harris) and doesnt know it becuase her mom never told anyone about her baby that didnt really die, she only though he did.\n\n--Simone~~(Chrystee Pharris) she is totally oblivious to this all going on, and is head over heels for chad, but never really talks to him, and doesnt realize that Whitney wants him in the worst way!\n\n*******they are still pretty crazY!\n\nTABTHA(juliet mills), TIMMY(josh ryan evans), and HECUBA(robin strasser) *aka: the witch, the other witch and the doll* ok, so they are the funniest things- timmy only talks in the third person, which cracks me up, and Tabitha is a witch who brough Timmy to life, because he was a doll before. Don't I know- it doesnt get any better than that! That is QUALITY! So Tabitha is also the one that killed Faith(charitys mom) and set the fire that nearly killed Grace(that caused the amnesia) These two crack me up! they are the funniest cuple on Passions. Okay, there story-lines are the dumbest things ever, but you just have to love these two. So then there's Hecuba, who Tabitha had trapped in a cave and basically screwed her over for like 300 years, she just came out of the cave, and now has Kay's soul, and has Charity trapped in hell. She got trapped in a bottle by Timmy and Tabitha, so now she's all trying to ruin lives of Harmony from inside the bottle, but then the demons in the basement(yes, demons in the basement) ate her or something, so she isn't on the show anymore, but she did mean stuff- like broke Sheridan and Luis' noodle(if you don't watch you really wouldnt get it)- and that's unacceptable to me!\n\n******okay, so timmy wished to be a real boy, so the little angel girl made him one-- yes, like Pinicchio--- so he's not a living doll anymore-- and by the by-- he's macking it to ALL the ladies:)\n\nAND THEN THERE IS POOR LITTLE CHAD HARRIS(donn swaby)*aka: boy from the streets* -- ok, so poor Chad, he was given up for adoption, and his parents left him alone, in cali, and he lost his job, and all he knew about where he was from was found on a piece of paper that said 'harmony' on it, so naturally, on that one fact, off he went:) ~ he shows up, and nobody gives him a chance, except Simone, who ends up falling for him, only he falls for her sister Whitney, but then we soon realize that Chad is probably Whiteney and Simones half-brother from the affair that Eve(their mother) had with Julian. Im telling you what, this poor kid better take a vacation\n\nOk, so these are my boys- Miguel is the one on the far left, then Luis, Chad, Sam, and Ethan. I told you that Luis was hot, actually they all are! Hey, no complaints here!! You can't even say that they aren't hot! Plus, Luis and Sam are cops, so they are in those little cute butt uniforms all the time! The guys on this show really do rule though- they all are totally whipped- Luis by Sheridan, Chad by Whitney, Sam by Grace(and Ivy) and Ethan by Theresa!- It's wonderful- I need a whipped guy:)\n\nThis is Sheridan and Luis! Don't even try to tell me that they aren't hot! She is this suductress- c'mon look at her for a second now- she's hot!~THEN~ ya gotta look at him- please- he's georgeous! Whooo- I'd marry him for looks alone- who cares if he's mean(not like i would know anyway) but just look at the body please!-- Heres a quick prelude to the show- So Sheridan used to date a big drug dealing man, and she found out that he was just a dirt-bag and left him, and Luis hates all Cranes becasue they killed his father\n\nHOW THEY MET: Ok, so these two, they used to hate each other, because Luis hates all the Cranes(except her now) becuase he's sure that they killed his father, so one day Sheridan is all driving along, and she's speeding(the way i drive) and Luis tries to pull her over, but she wont pull over, so she does all this crap, and cuts her off, and she smashes right-the-hell into his cop-truck! He gets pissed, she has to do community service with him(i wont get into it, but it was cute too) and thats how they met.\n\nHOW THEY FELL IN LOVE: Ok, so Luis' mom is Pilar, who took care of Sheridan when she was young, so on Pilars b-day Sheridan comes to bring her a present, and Luis (who is blindfolded at the time) mistakes her to his mother, and he soon realizes that she isn't his mother, and he tries to guess who it is by feeling her face and all that, and his last line is \"well whoever it is, i'd better stop cause i think i'm fallin in love\", then she yells at him, and later at the party, they try to show each other up by dancing the Tango with each other(its a good one) and then thats when they fell in love.\n\nWHY THAT SCREWED UP: that screwed up for many reasons, but when everyone thought that they were finally gonna hook up, Sheridans brother and father(who dont want Luis to see what happened to his father) break them up by having a man pose as Luis and say that he is only using her, she overhears the man, thinks he's Luis and leaves for Paris.\n\nPARIS: Basically, Sheridan hooks back up with her dirt-bag man and see's two guys kill him, they come after her, and to make a long story short, Luis shows up, saves her ass, and she still wont do him!\n\nTHE BODYGUARD: after Luis saves her, they make him her permanent bodyguard, but she still hates him, so he saves her life like 100 times and they still fight a lot, and then they start to get close agian, and c'mon sould ya blame them for wanting a piece from each other? Look at them!\n\nTHE CUTENESS: Ok, so a long time later, they decide to forget what she heard \"him\" say, and they hook up, but every time they try to do each other, they get interruped, first b/c Sam comes over, then b/c Luis' brother is trapped in a mine, then becasue Luis has to leave, so they dont get to have sex, but then Sheridan gets shot! dun dun dun\n\nTHE DEATH: ok, she's not dead, it was all a plan to fool people becuase the people she saw murder he ex-man are after her! So this guy Hank(who used to want her) pretends to shoot her, and the only people in on the plan are Hank and the special agent FBI man, but the hit-men find out, and have them bury sheridan and hold hank and the FBI man captive! Then some other crap goes down, and luis finds out that the hit-men who killed sheridan got hank and the FBI man on a boat, he chases them, kills em, they go save Sheridan and they say i love you, they make out, and then have some good sex.\n\nTHE GOOD SEX: ok, so these two rock! It's like porn-o-matic on passions! my sister tells me to turn off the smut, but i love it! I decided to change their song from the Jane French - Imagine one, to Ludacris- Whats Your Fantasy? -- im telling you! So now, everytime that they fight even a little, Luis does something cute, and then off to the bedroom these two go!\n\nTHE ENGAGEMENT: oh Jesus! This was so cute-- Luis is hot, man! I was a little dissapointed with this, because she knew he was gonna ask her, and i thought that it would be cuter if he just surprised her- but alas, Passions doesn't do it right, but i still love it! So now they are engaged, but it's gonna get messed up, cause Julian and Alistar(the brother and dad) are big jerks, and are gonna screw over the cuteness-- oh yea, they still have mad sex all the time- they were sorta missing the first few minutes of the party due to the sex factor- YES!!!\n\nTHE ENGAGEMENT PARTY: oy- lemme tell ya something- these two are so hot! - Alistar and Julian tried screwing them over, like I said, but they were all on to the plan, it was a plot to trap the luis imposter with Sheridan, and then real-luis walked in, and kicked some ass- it was great, and then Alistar was all kissing Sheridans booty, cause he still wants them to break up, and she damn fell for it!, but thats not the point, Shuis is hot:)\n\n*****okay, they got married, but didn't cause Ivy came crashing into the church and exposed Terrorsita as a liar, and Ethan called off the wedding, Luis and Sheridan felt that they shouldn't get married, so they didn't, but they are hot, so they went on their honeymoon anyways(yea they did) but then Alistar was all pissed off, and had Julian kill them, so Julian hires these peeps to blow up the boat that Shuis was on, and then sheridan was all screaming, the boat blew up, luis lived, and thought that she was dead b/c they pulled some body out of the water, and identified it as Sherdian(something fishy went on) and then later, Brain(who is really Antonio, luis' long lost brother) pulls Sheridan out of the water, she has amnesia, so they call her diana, but Sheridan has these little memories of Luis and them having crazy good sex so she goes back to Harmony to bring a boat up there w/ Antonio, and they are all walking around, but Luis still hasn't seen her so hopefully soon- they say in Feburary-- i hope so:)\n\nTHEY DID SAY IN FEBURARY DAMNIT!!!!!!!!! yea....okay, it's May and they are still not even close to seeing each other, this whole situation went down the crapper, oh damn...it hurts my feelings, so i'm not even gonna discuss it, but just know, it sucks up a storm\n\noh, aren't they cute? ---> that's too cute, i love being pissed off and having hot guys wrap around your side and try to suck up, oh, Luis is hot! Do any of you watch 'Ed'? Doesn't Sheridan look like Carole Vessy in some of these pictures? I think that she does, but not all the time-- more in the one on the bottom of this though. I have a friend Amanda who looks just like her-- i'll have to put her picture in the pictures of friends, and you all can see for yourselves, but for now i'm outta here- enjoy:)\n\noh man! it's uncanny the resmeblance- Carol Vessy-o-rama- Sheridan and her could be twins-let me tell you, and they both make that pissed off face, that funny one, kinda a sneer. This is Sheridan by the way, not carol vessy- She doesn't look like this anymore though- it's an old picture of her, now her hair is short and less blonde, but it dont matter- she always looks good, that's why they put her with Galen Gering, they are both too hot for their own good- they look hot all the time- there's hell in the closet, oh-yep- still hot:) sure wish i could always look hot!-- and that down there...is my absolute favorite picture of her, cause she's all like- 'yes i'm hot...yes i'm holding some odd centerpiece with balloons...yes my shirt says 'naughty'...kiss me darling!' -- cracks me up- i want that damn shirt!\n\nQUOTES FROM PASSIONS"
