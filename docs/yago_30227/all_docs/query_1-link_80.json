Throw in a centuries-old witch, an orangutan nurse, one never-seen patriarch and a large, diverse cast and you have a cult hit that's lived down its scandalous debut, which rankled viewers---many of them upset about the show replacing the beloved 'Another World'---with a tacky Princess Di subplot."
