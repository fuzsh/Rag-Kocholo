        "text": "Rome’s Capitol Theatre will screen a six-movie series, The Great American Novel, in the 1928 auditorium beginning September 24. Presented in conjunction with Jervis Public Library and the Keaton & Lloyd Bookshop, the series will focus on critically-acclaimed American movies based on classic American novels.\n\nOrson Welles’ adapted, directed, and narrates this screen adaptation of Booth Tarkington’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of a wealthy Indiana family in the turn-of-the-Century whose lives are sent into turmoil by changing times. Welles’ movie version is often considered one of the most faithful and affectionate silver screen incarnations of a work of literature ever made. The stars include Joseph Cotton, Tim Holt, Anne Baxter, Dolor6oand Agnes Moorehead. Nominated for four Oscars, in recent years the movie’s reputation has increased in some quarters to the extent that it is considered on a par with Welles’ famed Citizen Kane. “…amazing and memorable.” –Pauline Kael, The New Yorker.\n\nPlease note: although the movies are rated for general audiences, parents and guardians should use their discretion, recognizing that all the movies have moments of intensity that could prove disturbing for young children.\n\nRuntime: 129 Minutes\n\nRating: PG\n\nLanguage: English\n\nFormat: Digital Print"
