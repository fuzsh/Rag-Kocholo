        "text": "Orson Welles\n\nOrson Welles was an American actor, director, writer, and producer who is considered one of the most influential figures in the history of cinema. He was born on May 6, 1915, in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and died on October 10, 1985, in Los Angeles, California.\n\nWelles began his career in theater during the 1930s, gaining recognition for his innovative productions. In 1938, at the age of 23, he gained widespread fame for his radio adaptation of H.G. Wells' novel \"The War of the Worlds,\" which caused panic among listeners who believed the broadcast was an actual news report.\n\nWelles made his directorial debut in 1941 with \"Citizen Kane,\" a film that is widely regarded as one of the greatest movies ever made. It tells the story of a newspaper magnate inspired by real-life figures such as William Randolph Hearst. Welles co-wrote, directed, and starred in the film, which earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor and a nomination for Best Original Screenplay.\n\nDespite the critical success of \"Citizen Kane,\" Welles faced numerous challenges throughout his career. He often struggled with studio interference and limited budgets, which impacted the distribution and reception of his subsequent films. Some of his other notable works include \"The Magnificent Ambersons\" (1942), \"Touch of Evil\" (1958), and \"Chimes at Midnight\" (1965).\n\nWelles was known for his distinctive filmmaking style, characterized by deep focus cinematography, innovative use of lighting, and unconventional narrative structures. He often portrayed complex and morally ambiguous characters, challenging traditional storytelling conventions.\n\nIn addition to his film career, Welles also had a successful career in theater and performed in numerous stage productions. He co-founded the Mercury Theatre, which produced acclaimed adaptations of Shakespearean plays such as \"Macbeth\" and \"Julius Caesar.\" Welles continued to work in both film and theater throughout his life, although he faced financial difficulties and struggled to secure funding for his projects.\n\nâ€‹\n\nOrson Welles' contributions to cinema and his innovative approach to storytelling have had a lasting impact on filmmakers and artists. His work continues to be studied and celebrated for its technical achievements and artistic vision. Despite the challenges he faced, Welles left behind a significant body of work that cemented his status as a legendary figure in the history of cinema.\n\nQuotes:\n\n\"I started at the top and worked down.\"\n\n\"I'm not bitter about Hollywood's treatment of me, but over its treatment of D.W. Griffith, Josef von Sternberg, Erich von Stroheim, Buster Keaton and a hundred others.\"\n\n\"I hate television. I hate it as much as peanuts. But I can't stop eating peanuts.\"\n\n\"If there hadn't been women we'd still be squatting in a cave eating raw meat, because we made civilization in order to impress our girlfriends. And they tolerated it and let us go ahead and play with our toys.\"\n\n[on Citizen Kane (1941) being colorized] \"Keep Ted Turner and his goddamned Crayolas away from my movie.\"\n\n\"For thirty years, people have been asking me how I reconcile X with Y! The truthful answer is that I don't. Everything about me is a contradiction and so is everything about everybody else. We are made out of oppositions; we live between two poles. There is a philistine and an aesthete in all of us, and a murderer and a saint. You don't reconcile the poles. You just recognize them.\"\n\n\"My doctor told me to stop having intimate dinners for four. Unless there are three other people.\"\n\n\"I do not suppose I shall be remembered for anything. But I don't think about my work in those terms. It is just as vulgar to work for the sake of posterity as to work for the sake of money.\"\n\n\"Race hate isn't human nature; race hate is the abandonment of human nature.\"\n\n\"Living in the lap of luxury isn't bad, except you never know when luxury is going to stand up.\"\n\n- Orson Welles\n\nTrivia:"
