        "text": "Orson Welles used to say “they’ll love me when I’m dead” — well at least that’s what his protege Peter Bogdanovich said. I suppose in some sense that perspective was well-warranted. Although Welles received a lot of acclaim during his life, particularly for writing, directing, and starring in Citizen Kane, he never got the respect many contemporary critics suppose he deserved. Welles’ career was plagued by studio censorship, personal vendettas, and a desire for perfectionism. But still, Welles endured making more than a dozen movies, as well as more than a dozen unfinished movies. We’re going to rank the Best Orson Welles movies – of course including Orson Welles first film Citizen Kane. By the end, you’ll know more than just Orson Welles first film – you’ll know how a vagabond kid became one of cinema’s most respected leading-figures.\n\nOrson Welles Movie List\n\nOrson Welles filmography explained\n\nBefore we rank the best Orson Welles movies, let’s consider the documentary They’ll Love Me When I’m Dead — which was released posthumously at the same time as Orson Welles' last movie The Other Side of the Wind.\n\nThey’ll Love Me When I’m Dead • Trailer\n\nAs we review the best Orson Welles movies, consider this documentary and how it may explain Welles’ perspective on movie-making.\n\nWe ranked the best Orson Welles movies based on three criteria: acting, story, and direction. Each of the films on this list was directed by Welles — and many star him in the leading role. Welles was a director who frequently failed to finish his movies; as such there are a lot of “Orson Welles unfinished movies” and here's a list of what he left behind.\n\nIt’s All True (1941-1942)\n\nAn Evening With Orson Welles (1950)\n\nThe Tragedy of Lurs (1955)\n\nMoby Dick — Rehearsed (1955)\n\nDon Quixote (1957-1972)\n\nOrson Welles in Dublin (1960)\n\nThe Heroine (1967)\n\nThe Deep (1967-1970)\n\nVienna (1968)\n\nOne Man Band (1968-1971)\n\nOrson Welles Magic Show (1976-1985)\n\nFilming The Trial (1981)\n\nThe Dreamers (1982)\n\nKing Lear (1985)\n\nA lot of the footage of Welles’ unfinished works has either been destroyed or lost to time. The world will never know if one of these unfinished films would have been another cinematic masterpiece.\n\nBut thankfully, more than a few great works in Orson Welles filmography have survived the test of time. Without further ado, here’s our list of the best Orson Welles movies of all-time.\n\nOrson Welles Directed Movies\n\n13. The Lady From Shanghai (1947)\n\nThe Lady From Shanghai • Funhouse Scene\n\nThe Lady From Shanghai is most well-known for its elaborate “funhouse mirrors” scene at the end. But is that iconic scene all that’s good about it? Well, yes and no. If you’ve ever wanted to see Orson Welles give his best shot at an Irish accent, then The Lady From Shanghai is your chance.\n\nWelles co-starred in the film with his second wife Rita Hayworth and both gave excellent performances — but if you’re looking for Welles at the top of his directorial game, you won’t find it consistently in The Lady From Shanghai.\n\n85%\n\nACTING\n\n70%\n\nSTORY\n\n70%\n\nDIRECTION\n\n75%\n\nOVERALL SCORE\n\nWelles and Hayworth\n\nMirrors Sequence\n\nInfluential\n\nUneven Story\n\nAtonal\n\nN/A\n\nBest Orson Welles Films\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Lady From Shanghai finds Welles working at his best and worst — mixing distance and intimacy to uneven effect.\n\nOrson Welles First Feature Film in Color\n\n12. The Immortal Story (1968)\n\nThe Immortal Story • Opening Clip\n\nOrson Welles’ The Immortal Story is a strange feature film — the original cut was only 48 minutes long and it was produced for French television. It wasn’t until 2016 that the film was refined and expanded with the Criterion edit.\n\nThe middle part of Welles’ career was dogged by production hurdles and lack of financing, which was certainly evident by The Immortal Story — which was supposed to be the first part of a double feature based on Karen Blixen stories — but the second part never came to fruition.\n\n80%\n\nACTING\n\n75%\n\nSTORY\n\n85%\n\nDIRECTION\n\n80%\n\nOVERALL SCORE\n\nJeanne Moreau\n\nFabulistic Narrative\n\nCamera Angles\n\nOdd Pacing\n\nPoor Structure\n\nN/A\n\nBest Orson Welles Films\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Immortal Story is a hodge podge commentary of Welles’ favorite subjects — truth, deception, legacy, love and sex.\n\nOrson Welles Movie List\n\n11. Chimes at Midnight (1965)\n\nOrson Welles on His Favorite Film Chimes at Midnight\n\n“Shakespeare said everything. Brain to belly; every mood and minute of a man’s season. His language is starlight and fireflies and the sun and moon. He wrote it with tears and blood and beer, and his words march like heartbeats,” Orson Welles said in the foreword to Everybody’s Shakespeare.\n\nMuch has been said about Welles love of Shakespeare — and there’s no denying that the two men share considerable similarities. With Chimes at Midnight, Welles built a story based on the classic Shakespeare character Sir John Falstaff, and succeeded due to some sharp writing, great performances, and an unforgettable soundtrack.\n\n80%\n\nACTING\n\n80%\n\nSTORY\n\n80%\n\nDIRECTION\n\n80%\n\nOVERALL SCORE\n\nWelles’ Performance\n\nImpactful Ending\n\nIconic Music\n\nPoor Pacing\n\nMiddle Act\n\nN/A\n\nBest Orson Welles Movies Ranked\n\nConclusion\n\nWelles said that Chimes at Midnight was his favorite film — and it even made our list of the best Shakespeare film adaptations.\n\nBest Orson Welles Shakespeare Adaptations\n\n10. Othello (1952)\n\nOthello • Trailer\n\nOver the course of his career on Broadway and in Hollywood, Welles played the leading man in just about every Shakespeare play. But as a director, Welles only made two feature-length “direct” Shakespeare adaptations: Othello and Macbeth.\n\nOthello had an arduous shoot that lasted more than three years. The Producers ran out of money, which forced Welles to fund the project through to its completion. Although the film isn’t regarded as one of Welles’ best, it’s considered a treatise on how to use chiaroscuro lighting.\n\n85%\n\nACTING\n\n75%\n\nSTORY\n\n85%\n\nDIRECTION\n\n82%\n\nOVERALL SCORE\n\nChiaroscuro\n\nStrong Cast\n\nClassic Story\n\nFraming\n\nSome Editing\n\nN/A\n\nOrson Welles Best Films\n\nConclusion\n\nWelles’ cinematic adaptation of Othello is a visual treat due to the use of eye-popping black and white cinematography.\n\nBest Orson Welles Movies Ever Made\n\n9. Macbeth (1948)\n\nMacbeth • Trailer\n\nMacbeth has been privy to some excellent cinematic adaptations over the years; in 1957 with Akira Kurosawa’s Throne of Blood, in 1971 with Roman Polanski’s Macbeth, and in 2015 with Justin Kurzel’s Macbeth. But many cinema historians still consider Welles’ adaptation the best of them all.\n\nI suppose it’s not surprising that there have been so many adaptations of Macbeth, considering it’s widely regarded as Shakespeare’s best work.\n\n80%\n\nACTING\n\n90%\n\nSTORY\n\n95%\n\nDIRECTION\n\n88%\n\nOVERALL SCORE\n\nAtmospheric\n\nVisually Rich\n\nGreat Story\n\nSome Acting\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\nBest Orson Welles Movies Ranked\n\nConclusion\n\nWelles was forced to make Macbeth on a tight budget, but the end result surpassed expectations.\n\nFull List Orson Welles Movies\n\n8. F for Fake (1973)\n\nF for Fake • How to Structure a Video Essay\n\nIs it possible to be original? How do we determine whether something is good or bad? Why do we attribute value by “expert” opinion? These are the questions at the heart of F for Fake — a 90 minute essay film that explores forgers of the most clinical kind.\n\nF for Fake simultaneously finds Welles at his most unrestrained and self-indulgent. I’d argue that Welles was nearly more infatuated with star Oja Kodar than he was with the film itself.\n\nN/A\n\nACTING\n\n90%\n\nSTORY\n\n85%\n\nDIRECTION\n\n88%\n\nOVERALL SCORE\n\nLandmark Style\n\nInsane Story\n\nReflective and Profound\n\nLacks Focus\n\nSome Over-Editing\n\nN/A\n\nBest Orson Welles Films\n\nConclusion\n\nF for Fake takes an unflinching look at the battle between self-satisfaction and critical acclaim.\n\nOrson Welles Directed Movies\n\n7. The Stranger (1946)\n\nThe Stranger • Trailer\n\nRKO aimed big for directors during Pre-Production of The Stranger. The Studio’s first choice was John Huston, but he was unavailable due to other commitments. The studio’s second choice was Huston’s good friend Orson Welles, who agreed to direct the project.\n\nThe Stranger turned into an Orson Welles production after Huston bowed out. Welles directed, starred, and co-penned the script. In the end, Welles’ lust for control proved to irritate RKO and resulted in the Studio backing out of a contract agreement with him. Nonetheless, The Stranger went on to become a box-office success.\n\n95%\n\nACTING\n\n90%\n\nSTORY\n\n90%\n\nDIRECTION\n\n92%\n\nOVERALL SCORE\n\nBold Story\n\nDoc. Footage\n\nWelles and Robinson\n\nMiddle Act\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\nBest Orson Welles Movies of All-Time\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Stranger is one of many films in the public domain — and is available on nearly every streaming service.\n\nOrson Welles Movie List\n\n6. The Magnificent Ambersons (1942)\n\nThe Magnificence of the Ambersons\n\nOrson Welles adaptation of Booth Tarkington’s novel The Magnificent Ambersons is a brilliant film. I’d venture to say that if the film’s production hadn’t been so mired in controversy, it would probably be considered a classic.\n\nOver the course of shooting The Magnificent Ambersons, Welles fell out of favor with RKO. When the film went to Post-Production, he struggled to retain control of the editing process. Tragically, Welles' cut of the movie was destroyed and it’s widely believed that all additional footage beyond the released version is lost to history. Still, the RKO cut is very good, even if it does shy away from a more sinister ending.\n\n95%\n\nACTING\n\n95%\n\nSTORY\n\n95%\n\nDIRECTION\n\n95%\n\nOVERALL SCORE\n\nEnsemble Cast\n\nSet Design\n\nExcellent Story\n\n\"Safe” Ending\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\nBest Orson Welles Films\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Magnificent Ambersons may not have been the film Welles wanted, but it’s still a great film of the Hollywood Golden Age.\n\nBest Orson Welles Movies Ranked\n\n5. Mr. Arkadin (Confidential Report)\n\nMr. Arkadin • Clip\n\nOrson Welles had a penchant for appearing larger than life. This created a shadow that he could never escape. With Mr. Arkadin (1955), Welles found himself engulfed in this shadow more than ever.\n\nThere are more than four cuts of Mr. Arkadin because a ton of footage was lost/destroyed at various points in Post-Production. Just recently, the film was restored by Criterion with editing supervision done by Welles’ friend Peter Bogdanovich.\n\n95%\n\nACTING\n\n100%\n\nSTORY\n\n90%\n\nDIRECTION\n\n95%\n\nOVERALL SCORE\n\nBrilliant Story\n\nMysterious Setting\n\nStory Arc\n\nSome of the Lighting\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\nOrson Welles Best Films\n\nConclusion\n\nIn a thematic sense, Mr. Arkadin serves as the middle act between Welles’ Citizen Kane and The Other Side of the Wind.\n\nBest Orson Welles Movies of All-Time\n\n4. Touch of Evil (1958)\n\nTouch of Evil • Opening Shot\n\nTouch of Evil may be most famous for its opening tracking shot, but there’s so much more to it that makes it one of the best movies of the 1950s. Welles, Janet Leigh, and Charlton Heston all give excellent performances — and the script is tight and taut throughout.\n\nSadly, Touch of Evil was buried by Universal upon distribution in 1958. It was released as a B-movie for Hedy Lamar’s The Female Animal, and never found much traction in the U.S. despite its all-star cast.\n\n100%\n\nACTING\n\n95%\n\nSTORY\n\n100%\n\nDIRECTION\n\n98%\n\nOVERALL SCORE\n\nImpactful Story\n\nMasterclass Acting\n\nSteady Direction\n\nShort Drag in Middle\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\nFull List Orson Welles Movies\n\nConclusion\n\nToday, Touch of Evil is considered one of Orson Welles best movies, and a classic example of film noir.\n\nOrson Welles Directed Movies\n\n3. The Trial (1962)\n\nThe Trial Allegory • Clip\n\nFranz Kanfka was a writer who had a style so distinctive that his imposters and replicators — as well as the works they made — became known as “Kafkaesque.” At first glance, Welles may not seem like a Kafkaesque director, but upon further investigation, the similarities are definitely there.\n\nWelles adapted Kafka’s iconic novel The Trial into a film in 1962, and although it didn’t receive widespread acclaim upon release, it has become more well-regarded in the decades since.\n\n100%\n\nACTING\n\n95%\n\nSTORY\n\n100%\n\nDIRECTION\n\n98%\n\nOVERALL SCORE\n\nPerkins\n\nProd. Design\n\nAbsurdist Story\n\nDrags a Little\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\nBest Orson Welles Films\n\nConclusion\n\nYou may be shocked to find how prescient the themes of The Trial are, not only in Welles cinematic adaptation, but in Kafka’s 1925 novel as well.\n\nBest Orson Welles Movies Ranked\n\n2. The Other Side of the Wind (2018)\n\nThe Other Side of the Wind • Trailer\n\nBilled in its own credits as a film more than 40 years in the making, The Other Side of the Wind is one of the most fascinating movies of all-time. The Other Side of the Wind follows fictional auteur director Jake Hannaford on the last day of his life.\n\nYears prior to the events of the film, Hannaford had been ousted from Hollywood. But now, he’s returned to make one final film. Sound familiar? That’s because it’s the story of Orson Welles — but alas, Welles insisted that The Other Side of the Wind wasn’t auto-biographical.\n\nI have a sneaking suspicion that The Other Side of the Wind will continue to grow in esteem. One day, critics may consider The Other Side of the Wind even more impactful than Citizen Kane.\n\n100%\n\nACTING\n\n100%\n\nSTORY\n\n100%\n\nDIRECTION\n\n100%\n\nOVERALL SCORE\n\nAudaciously Bold\n\nNarratively Diametric\n\nJohn Huston\n\nHeavy Cuts\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\nOrson Welles Last Movie\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Other Side of the Wind is Welles’ most intimate picture and it closes the book on one of cinema’s most daring figures.\n\nOrson Welles First Feature Film\n\n1. Citizen Kane (1941)\n\nCitizen Kane • Crash Course History\n\nIs Citizen Kane the greatest movie ever made? Don’t take my word for it; here’s what some of the best have said about it.\n\n“I think many people can agree, it’s one of the great American experiences in cinema.” — Steven Spielberg\n\n“It’s the only lesson I’ve ever had in filmmaking… Citizen Kane is flat-out the most important and greatest American film ever made as far as I’m concerned.” — William Friedkin\n\n“People don't always ask about the greatest film. They ask, 'What's your favorite movie?' Again, I always answer with Citizen Kane.\" — Roger Ebert\n\nOrson Welles made Citizen Kane at the age of 26 and although he didn’t know it then, the film would go on to top every poll of the greatest movies ever made. Kane proved to be a blessing and a curse for Welles — although the film was a critical success, it cast a giant shadow that he could never escape. For better or worse, no matter what he did, nothing would ever beat Citizen Kane — even if it were better than Citizen Kane.\n\n100%\n\nACTING\n\n100%\n\nSTORY\n\n100%\n\nDIRECTION\n\n100%\n\nOVERALL SCORE\n\nLandmark Direction\n\nCaptivating Performances\n\nUnforgettable Ending\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\nBest Orson Welles Films\n\nConclusion\n\nIs Citizen Kane deserving of all of the acclaim it receives? Personally, I feel that it is — and I know there are many others who feel the same way.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nBest Stanley Kubrick Movies\n\nOrson Welles may have been one of the first auteur directors, but he isn’t the most famous. That distinction squarely belongs to Stanley Kubrick. Few filmmakers have had as great of an impression on the cinema landscape as Kubrick.
