        "text": "One of the great legends of cinema is the original, still unfound, cut of Orson Wells’ “The Magnificent Ambersons.” Filmmaker William Friedkin once called it the “holy grail of cinema.”\n\nThe story goes that during editing, RKO, with the help of Robert Wise, re-edited the film from 131 minutes to 88 Minutes and added a “happy ending”.\n\nWelles' notes for how he wished the film to be cut have survived, the supposed extra footage that was left on the cutting room floor has, supposedly, been destroyed. Some don’t believe that it was.\n\nThe story goes that Welles received a print of ‘Ambersons’ for him to edit in Brazil while shooting the ill-fated “It’s All True”. According to RKO memos, two groupings of ‘Ambersons’ footage (14 reels and another 10), were shipped to Brazil so Welles could finish editing on the film.\n\nThe trouble started after a test audience, filled with teenagers, hated the film. In panic, RKO took over editing and cut the movie down to 88 minutes.\n\nMore than two years after Welles left Brazil, RKO instructed Cinedia Studios in Rio de Janiero, which Welles used as a base in 1942, to junk the reels of The Magnificent Ambersons and Journey Into Fear left behind. Cinedia owner Adhemar Gonzaga, a cineaste and film collector, notified RKO he had followed their orders\n\nFilmmaker Joshua Grossberg and his team searched through the vast landscapes of Brazil, for almost two months, to find a copy of the lost cut of Welles’ film.\n\nHere’s where it gets interesting, in the ‘90s, Grossberg met Michel do Esprito Santo, an archivist and film collector, who claimed to have seen a Welles cut of ‘Ambersons’ at Cinedia. The Brazillian archivist searched for it later, but it was gone — possibly trashed or sold to a private collector.\n\nThus began Grossberg’s obsessive search for the lost cut. He went through archives, interviewed collectors and was led to various different areas. There were hints and clues that Welles’ original cut did, in fact, exist.\n\nWellesnet is now reporting that Grossberg has returned to Brazil. In fact, he’s also making a documentary about his expedition for the BBC. If a copy of the 131-minute cut of “The Magnificent Ambersons,” somehow, still exists, the print would likely be in Brazil.\n\nFilmmaker Brian Rose told The Guardian that “The few who saw Welles’ original version believed it was the greatest film they had ever seen.”\n\nThe 88-minute cut of ‘Magnificent Ambersons’ is a wonderful film, but every time I watch it there’s that nagging feeling of what could have been. The film does feel like an incomplete vision.\n\nThe truncated version of the film was included in Sight and Sound's 1972 list of the top 10 greatest films ever made, and again in the 1982 list. It placed 81st in the 2012 poll. It did not make the top 100 in last year’s revamped edition."
