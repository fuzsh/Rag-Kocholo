        "text": "As one of the most widely acclaimed and influential directors of the postwar era, Stanley Kubrick enjoyed a reputation and a standing unique among the filmmakers of his day. He had a brilliant career with relatively few films. An outsider, he worked beyond the confines of Hollywood, which he disliked, maintaining complete control of his projects and making movies according to his own ideas and time constraints. To him, filmmaking was a form of art and unlike Hollywood, not a business.\n\nCitizen Kane is presumably the best that American Cinema has ever offered, impeccable from beginning to the end. Frequently rivaling Its a Wonderful Life for number one, Citizen Kane is in a group of its own and unmatched in artistry on a number of fronts. The innovative development and the specialized headways used during production, can be minimally viewed as inconceivable and amazing, for a 1941 film. Citizen Kane has stood the test of time for well over six decades, serving as a benchmark and wellspring of motivation to storytellers of all walks of life. Citizen Kane is a sad tragedy about the fictions character Charles Foster Kane, a business head honcho and a daily paper investor. Through this movie, Orson Welles deified Charles Foster Kane as well as showed his determination, as an author, chief, on-screen character and above all as an auteur. The scenes displayed as flashbacks, not simply show his flexibility as an on-screen character (dealing with the subtleties and the nuances anticipated that would depict the diverse stages and parts of Kane's life), additionally his narrating brightness. Kane's muttering of \"rosebud\" at the moment of his demise and him openly destroying his political adversary, Jim Getys, speak to the two extremes of human life, the low and the high, individually. The scenes in the middle of Welles and Joseph Cotton are a flat out treat to watch. Feelings of sensitivity and disdain towards his childhood friend,\n\nThe author of the article “Longing for the Lines That Had Us at Hello” Michael Cieply states that now aday movies are lacking a great line that carries deep meaning, and that they focus mainly on the visuals and less on the actual dialogue. I agree with Cieply that we don’t see those great meaningful lines in the movies these day. However, I want to add to his opinion that it's not just the visuals that's taking the most attention, it also the fact that movies became only for entertainment, meaning that they’re not really for educational purposes whatsoever, and let's face it do we actually sit and watch documentary movies on our for fun?\n\nOrson Wells´ film “Citizen Kane,” has long been regarded as one of, if not the greatest film of all time. It has been beloved by critics for decades and will be at or near the top of any list of great movies. Part of this appeal lays in the fact that, “Citizen Kane,” challenges many of the preexisting narrative and technological aspects of filmmaking in the 1930s. “Citizen Kane,” defied or adjusted these traditional conventions in order to suit its own narrative and because of that it is still one of the most groundbreaking and influential films of all time.\n\nIn 1939, Kansan teenager Dorothy Gale (portrayed by Judy Garland) decides to run away from home to protect her little dog, Toto, from her heinous neighbor, Almira Gulch. Before getting very far, Dorothy sees the error in her ways and attempts to return home before being swept into a strange world of colorful characters by a tornado. Realizing that there is only one way to return home, she sets off with a group of her newfound friends on the adventure of a lifetime. Considered to be the most popular films of all time, the incredible tale of Dorothy must be historic for many reasons. One of the most distinct reasons for the popularity of this film is the director Victor Fleming’s use of film.\n\nThe great film critic Roger Ebert once said “We live in a box of space and time. Movies are windows in its walls. They allow us to enter other minds, not simply in the sense of identifying with the characters…but by seeing the world as another person sees it.” Films have been important to society as they are a medium in which the audience can see other perspectives, and things vastly different to their own lives. Films allow the audience to connect with characters, to understand their motivations, their situations, their struggles and most importantly their perspective.\n\nHis directing philosophy was that his way was the best way. Welles’ work was solely self-reliant and dependent on his representation of guise. This style/philosophy contributed to the way modern artists presently direct their films and movies. He began his most notable movie, Citizen Kane, with multiple test shots and killed his own character by using a very low angle, as if the viewer was right there, dead, with his character. Welles loved to introduce his films by starting with mysterious, bleak worlds. His main goal was to show future directors that deeply focused camera shots, shadows, askew angles, multiple action points, sound techniques borrowed from radio, and deeply focused shots worked in the favor of the production.\n\nIn 1941 it eventually became Citizen Kane, Welles’s first feature film and also his most famous and honored role (“Orson” 8). The film was well received, by almost all critics, and not only did it gain nine Academy Award nominations, but it is also hailed as one of the greatest films ever made. His second film for RKO, The Magnificent Ambersons, also received several nominations, including Best Picture (“Orson” 9).\n\nFleming’s innovative techniques make this film one of the most popular and genius films of its time. His original writing style sparks the inner child of the viewers and lets their mind wander into the magical land of Oz. The Wizard of Oz stands as an example of one of the most remarkable films ever produced. Fleming’s distinctive storyline and characters can be used to inspire upcoming films in Hollywood. It is without question as to why this cinematic masterpiece is one of American Film Institute’s top one hundred films of all\n\nIn a modern world in which intercommunication is at the tip of a finger, ideas can be shared, understood, and implemented in the blink of an eye. The world’s current accessibility has allowed societal opinion to change rapidly, with external influences on culturally sensitive topics. Without this communication, we would not be nearly so intellectually connected and advanced a global community as we are now, though we still have a long way to go. One of the greatest ways to have documented that societal journey has been through media. Since the first film was created in 1888, people have narrated, entertained, and shared ideas with one another through their art: film. Film has been used to tell stories to the"
