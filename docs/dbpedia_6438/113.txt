Synopsis

Orson Welles' follow-up to "Citizen Kane" is this Best Picture nominee, an epic tale of the gradual decline of an old-monied Indianapolis family in the face of turn-of-the-century industrialization. The Ambersons' magnificent lives are apparent as the film opens, as is their sense of propriety. Welles, who directed, produced and adapted the screenplay from Booth Tarkington's novel, also provides the narration. Remade as a 2002 made-for-cable film.
