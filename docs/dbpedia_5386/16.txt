Lin Zexu , or Lin Tse-hsü, (born Aug. 30, 1785, Houguan, Fujian province, China—died Nov. 22, 1850, Chaozhu, Guangdong province), Leading Chinese scholar and official of the Qing dynasty, accepted as a national hero for his stance against the British before the Anglo-Chinese Opium War (1839–42). Lin passed the highest examination in the Chinese examination system and entered the Hanlin Academy and government. Having suggested to the emperor ways to suppress the opium trade, Lin found himself appointed imperial commissioner and dispatched to Guangzhou (Canton) to deal with the problem directly. He was so successful that, in retaliation for his destruction of their opium stocks, the British ravaged large parts of southern China, and Lin was quickly dismissed. He served loyally at his post of exile and was soon called back to important service. He died on his way to help suppress what became known as the Taiping Rebellion.
