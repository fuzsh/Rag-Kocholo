In Cantonese-speaking regions such as Hong Kong and Macau it is spelled as Lam or Lum.\n\nIt is listed 147th on the Hundred Family Surnames. Within mainland China, it is currently the 18th most common surname.\n\nIn Japan, the character 林 is also used but goes by the pronunciation Hayashi, which is the 19th most common surname in Japan.\n\nName origin\n\n[edit]\n\nKing Zhou of Shang (reigned 1154 to 1122 BC), the last king of the Shang dynasty, had three uncles advising him and his administration. The king's uncles were Prince Bi Gan, Prince Jizi, and Prince Weizi. Together the three princes were known as \"The Three Kind-Hearted Men of Shang\" in the kingdom.[1] Prince Bi Gan was the son of King Wen Ding; he was the brother of King Zhou's father and, thus, was King Zhou's uncle, and served as the prime minister of the Kingdom of Shang.\n\nKing Zhou was a cruel king, but his three uncles could not persuade him to change his ways. Failing in their duty to advise the king, Prince Weizi resigned. Prince Jizi faked insanity and was relieved of his post. Only Prince Bi Gan stayed on to continue advising the king to change his ways. \"Servants who are afraid of being killed and refrain from telling the truth are not righteous\" he said. This put him in danger of incurring the king's wrath. Prince Bi Gan stayed at the palace for three days and nights to try to persuade the blood-thirsty and immoral king to mend his ways.[2]\n\nThe stubborn king would not relent and had Prince Bi Gan arrested for treason. Upon hearing this, his pregnant wife escaped into the forest and went into labor there. With no one to help her, she gave birth to a boy in the rocky cave in the forest, in a place called Chang Lin (長林).\n\nBefore long, King Zhou of Shang was overthrown by Ji Fa, the Count of the West (Western Shang). Ji Fa established a new dynasty named the Zhou dynasty and became the King Wu of Zhou. King Wu knew about the courageous prime minister Prince Bi Gan and sought his wife and child. When he found them, he honoured them in respect of Prince Bi Gan. The mother and child were restored to the Shang royal family. King Wu of Zhou conferred the surname Lin (meaning forest) and the Dukedom of Bo'ling on Prince Bi Gan's son, Lin (Lim/Lam) Jian (林坚), ennobled as the Duke of Bo'ling.[citation needed]\n\nOther origins\n\n[edit]\n\nfrom Lin Kai (林開), son of the King Ping of Zhou[3]\n\nfrom Lin Fang (林放), an official in Lu, also a student of Confucius, during the Spring and Autumn period[3]\n\nadopted by South China's aboriginal tribes\n\nadopted by the Qiu Lin (丘林) ethnic Xianbei, family as the surname during the Northern Wei dynasty[3]\n\nfrom the personal name of Lin Fu (林父), the given name of an official in the state of Wei during the Spring and Autumn period, whose original surname was Sun.[which?][3]\n\nfrom name of a fief granted to an official in the State of Ju during the Spring and Autumn period[3]\n\nDistribution\n\n[edit]\n\nWithin China, 林 is the 2nd most common surname in Hokkien,[4] 4th most common in the city of Haikou, and 10th most common in the city of Guangzhou.[5]\n\nIn 2019 it was the 18th most common surname in Mainland China.[6]\n\nDifferent versions of the name\n\n[edit]\n\nAmong the Malaysian Chinese it is not commonly spelled Lin but rather Lim or Lam. The Hakka, Hokkien, Teochew and Hainan communities romanize it as \"Lim\" whereas the Cantonese-speaking community uses \"Lam\".\n\nThe Korean surname Im (임 in South Korean spelling; 림 in North Korean spelling; commonly romanized as Lim or Rim) is the Korean pronunciation of the same Chinese character (林). A much less common Korean surname Im is derived from another character (任; spelled 임 Im in both North and South Korean) the character used to write the surname Ren. In Korean, the former is called Supul Rim (수풀 림) and the latter Matgil Im (맡길 임) when they need to be distinguished.\n\nA common Japanese surname, Hayashi, is written with the same character 林 and also means forest. A much rarer Japanese surname, Rin, is also written with same character.\n\nThe Vietnamese surname, \"Lâm\", was formerly written using the same character.\n\nIn Singapore, although \"Lim\" and \"Lam\" are generally more common variants, the extremely rare spelling \"Lyn\" can be found in select families of Chinese, Japanese, or other East Asian ancestry (also transcribed using the 林 character) and bears no known relation to the English or Scottish surname of the same spelling, or alternate spelling \"Ling\".\n\nA rare Chinese surname which is also transcribed Lin is 藺 / 蔺 (pinyin Lìn), for example the Warring States period statesman Lin Xiangru .\n\nIndonesians of Chinese ancestry bearing this surname sometimes spell it as \"Liem\", pronounced from Fuqing dialect.\n\nProminent Thai Chinese royalist families with this surname are bestowed by member of the royal family some indigenised derivative such as \"Limthongkul\" \"Sirilim\" \"Limpisthira.\"\n\nThe character \"霖\" (Lín, \"heavy rain showers\") is also a popular personal name among ethnic Chinese people.\n\nNotable people surnamed Lin\n\n[edit]\n\nThis is an East Asian name, meaning the surname is stated \"before\" the given name, though East Asian persons living in Western countries will often put their surname after their given name.\n\nLin\n\n[edit]\n\nMandarin and Wu Chinese:\n\nLin Biao (林彪),
