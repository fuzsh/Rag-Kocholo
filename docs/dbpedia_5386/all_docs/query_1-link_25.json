        "text": "Lin's formal education started at the age of nine, at a local academy, as it was more effective than learning from his father. Five years later, he took the same tests as his father and passed with flying colors, earning the degree of xiucai, gaining a lot of respect for his age. At twenty, he went a step further than his father, passing the juren exams, becoming a local government scholar-official, but could not complete his full education because he could not afford the journey to the capital. Instead, he gained lots of experience working in the government, ultimately granting him success seven years later at the capital, becoming the rank jinshi, the highest place he could climb to as a scholar. He joined the HanLin Academy, gained much more experience working in the capital, and finally accepted his first job as a overseer of the civil service exam in the province of Yunnan. After his work as an authoritative figure, Lin went on to have an audience with the emperor, becoming a surveillance commissioner, a financial commissioner, and finally overseeing the governing of whole provinces."
