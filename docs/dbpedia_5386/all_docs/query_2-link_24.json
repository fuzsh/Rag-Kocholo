        "text": "Lin Biao (December 5, 1907 – September 13, 1971) was a Marshal of the People's Republic of China who was pivotal in the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War, especially in Northeast China. Lin was the general who commanded the decisive Liaoshen and Pingjin Campaigns, in which he co-led the Manchurian Field Army to victory and led the People's Liberation Army into Beijing. He crossed the Yangtze River in 1949, decisively defeated the Kuomintang and took control of the coastal provinces in Southeast China. He ranked third among the Ten Marshals. Zhu De and Peng Dehuai were considered senior to Lin, and Lin ranked directly ahead of He Long and Liu Bocheng. Lin abstained from taking an active role in politics after the civil war ceased in 1949. He led a section of the government's civil bureaucracy as one of the co-serving Vice Premiers of the People's Republic of China from 1954 onwards, becoming First Vice Premier from 1964. Lin became more active in politics when named one of the co-serving Vice Chairmen of the Communist Party of China in 1958. He held the three responsibilities of Vice Premier, Vice Chairman and Minister of National Defense from 1959 onwards. Lin became instrumental in creating the foundations for Mao Zedong's cult of personality in the early 1960s, and was rewarded for his service in the Cultural Revolution by being named Mao's designated successor as the sole Vice Chairman of the Communist Party of China, from 1966 until his death. Lin died on September 13, 1971, when a Hawker Siddeley Trident he was aboard crashed in Öndörkhaan in Mongolia. The exact events of this \"Lin Biao incident\" have been a source of speculation ever since. The Chinese government's official explanation is that Lin and his family attempted to flee following a botched coup against Mao. Others have argued that they fled out of fear they would be purged, as Lin's relationship with other Communist Party leaders had soured in the final few years of his life. Following Lin's death, he was officially condemned as a traitor by the Communist Party. Since the late 1970s Lin, and Mao's wife Jiang Qing (with her Gang of Four) have been labeled the two major \"counter-revolutionary forces\" of the Cultural Revolution, receiving official blame from the Chinese government.\n\nLin Shaye, an incandescent figure in the Hollywood scene, has carved out an exceptional career spanning over five decades. Born in 1943 in Detroit, Michigan, she was raised within a family deeply entwined with the entertainment industry; her father owned a theater and her brother became the CEO of MGM. This exposure to the world of movies and performances significantly influenced her formative years and helped shape her passion for acting. Shaye's journey into professional acting began in earnest when she moved to New York City after graduating from the University of Michigan. There, she honed her talent through studying under Uta Hagen and Stella Adler, two of the most respected acting teachers in America. It wasn't long before her undeniable talent caught the attention of movie producers, leading to her film debut in Hester Street in 1975. Since then, Shaye has graced the screen in over 100 films, including popular hits like A Nightmare on Elm Street, Insidious, and Kingpin. Despite often being cast in smaller, supporting roles, Shaye's talent for bringing characters to life often steals the show. Her memorable performance as Elise Rainier in the Insidious series won her widespread recognition and admiration, earning her the title of \"godmother of horror.\" In addition to her significant contributions to the horror genre, Shaye's versatility has seen her star in comedies, dramas, and even children's movies."
