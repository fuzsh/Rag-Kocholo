        "text": "The bronze statue of Confucius has dominated the landscape in Manhattan's Chinatown since 1984, casting a learned and paternal look toward Mott Street, the World Trade Center and the world beyond.\n\nYesterday, Confucius got some company: a statue of a Qing Dynasty official from Fujian Province, whose appearance in Chinatown may have less to do with his role in 19th-century history than with politics in the late 20th century. The new statue is of Lin Zexu, who helped to ignite the Opium War by banning the drug, to the chagrin of British officials.\n\nThose who brought the Lin statue to Chatham Square say they did so to deliver a strong anti-drug message. But the statue carries a strong political message as well: it underscores the ascending power in Chinatown of immigrants from mainland China, particularly the Fujianese. They are quickly gaining political strength, at the expense of the pro-Taiwan Cantonese who settled earlier in Chinatown.\n\n''Confucius is for all Chinese,'' said Zheng Dezhang, 36, who immigrated to New York City from Fujian Province in 1989. ''But Lin Zexu is from Fujian, and that is very meaningful for those of us from Fujian, because there are more of us now in New York.''\n\nJames Lee, English secretary for the Consolidated Chinese Benevolent Association, whose organization played a major role in building the Confucius statue more than 10 years ago, suspects politics may have been a factor: Lin, after all, fought against the British. And Hong Kong is a British colony that was recently returned to a triumphant China.\n\n''There are many heroes in Chinese history,'' Mr. Lee said. ''Why did they have to pick Lin Zexu?''\n\nThe reason, maintains Steven Wong, chairman of the Lin Zexu Foundation of U.S.A., is inscribed in English and Chinese at the statue's hexagonal red-bean-colored base: ''Say No to Drugs.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
