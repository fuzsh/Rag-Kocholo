Yet, as opium smoking became popular, opium turned out to be a drug that did great harm to human beings.\n\nSince the middle and late 18th century, western capitalist countries led by Britain intensified the policy of trade expansion and unexpectedly used opium as a steppingstone to enter China's market. Armed opium smuggling and dumping brought China into a world of black stream and poisonous fog. It became a huge tumor of the Qing Dynasty and tremendously endangered the Chinese nation.\n\nIn 1839, Chinese people represented by Lin Zexu launched the first large-scale anti-opium campaign in human history. Over 1,150,000 kg of opium was destroyed publicly on the beach of Humen, Guangdong. The world was shocked.

In order to reverse the trade deficit, the British colonists turned to profiteering, and armed smuggling led to the dumping of a large amount of opium in China.\n\nHeadquarters of British East India Company in London, Unknown, From the collection of: The Opium War Museum\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nHeadquarters of British East India Company in London\n\nBanner of British East India Company, Unknown, From the collection of: The Opium War Museum\n\nShow lessRead more\n\nBanner of British East India Company\n\nSince the fifteenth century in Europe, there was prevailing “mercantilism” to encourage foreign plunder and trade.

Humen beach witnessed the burning of opium stocks on that day. It is a brave song for Chinese people to resist foreign aggression, and the most splendid chapter in the history of drug prohibition.\n\nHowever, we still have a heavy heart, with lots of questions churning in our brains: When western countries developed their overseas trade, why did they only sell lots of opium to China? Why was opium flooded only in the Qing Dynasty while it spread over the world? Why did the opium which could be used as a medicinal material become a narcotic causing huge social harm? Why was it so hard to prohibit opium in the Qing Dynasty even with strict anti-opium regulations? As an anti-opium hero, why was Lin Zexu still demoted and exiled by the government?\n\nCredits: Story\n\n总策划—张建雄 馆长\n\nCredits: All media\n\nThe story featured may in some cases have been created by an independent third party and may not always represent the views of the institutions, listed below, who have supplied the content."
