        "text": "May 6, 2012 © Ulrich Theobald\n\nWei Yuan é­æº (1794-1857), original name Yuanda é é, courtesy name Wei Moshen é­é»æ·±, was a late Qing period æ¸ (1644-1911) philosopher and writer. He hailed from Shaoyang éµé½, Hunan, and studied in a very traditional way the philosophy of the Ming period æ (1368-1644) Neo-Confucian philosopher Wang Shouren çå®ä» (Wang Yangming çé½æ), as well as historiography. With the age of 14 sui he passed the local state examination as the best and was allowed to enter the Yuelu Academy å²³éºæ¸é¢, where he studied the Confucian Classics under the guidance of Liu Fenglu åé¢ç¦ (1776-1829), a representative of the Changzhou School å¸¸å·å­¸æ´¾.\n\nIn 1826, Wei Yuan participated in the metropolitan examination and became an official under the governors He Changling è³é·é½¡ (1785-1848), Tao Shu é¶æ¾ (1779-1839), Lin Zexu æåå¾ (1785-1850) and Yuqian/Yoikiyan è£è¬ (1793-1841). During the First Opium War he participated in the fights in Zhejiang. In 1845 he passed the jinshi examination and subsequently was appointed to several posts in local governments.\n\nWei Yuan is a famous historian and often mentioned together with his colleague Gong Zizhen é¾èªç (1792-1841). He was, under the impression of the Opium War, very interested in the world beyond China, especially Europe, that had until then only scarcely attracted the attention of Chinese scholars. He participated in the translation of Hugh Murray's (1779-1846) Encyclopaedia of Geography, Comprising a Complete Description of the Earth [...] that was published by Lin Zexu as Sizhouzhi åæ´²å¿ \"The Four Continents\". Wei Yuan also compiled an own geographic treatise, the Haiguo tuzhi æµ·ååå¿. Wei Yuan stressed that it was important to learn from the West and to adopt the newest developments in military technology (modern firearms, steamboats). He is so a forerunner of the self-strengthening movement of the second half of the 19th century.\n\nAs a philosopher, Wei Yuan was interested in Liu Fenglu's studies of the new-text classics, especially the Gongyang Commentary å ¬ç¾å³ to the Chunqiu æ¥ç§ \"Spring and Autumn Annals\". He analyzed Han period æ¼¢ (206 BCE-220 CE) writings and came to the conclusion that the interpretation of \"small words with a great meaning\" (wei yan da yi å¾®è¨å¤§ç¾©) was correct, and better than other commentaries to the Chunqiu, especially the Guliang Commentary æ¦æ¢å³. Wei Yuan wrote an analysis (Dongzi Chunqiu fawei è£å­æ¥ç§ç¼å¾®) of the Chunqiu fanlu æ¥ç§ç¹é², a cosmological interpretation of the Chunqiu by the Han period philosopher Dong Zhongshu è£ä»²è (179-104 BCE).\n\nThe interpretations of the Confucian Classics by the Han period new-text school were in Wei Yuan's eyes an ideal method to learn more about a more effective government. The Zhouyi å¨æ \"Book of Changes\" would help to dispel doubts, the chapter Hongfan æ´ªç¯ \"The Great Plan\" in the Shangshu å°æ¸ \"Book of Documents\" would predict changes, the Chunqiu would help deciding politics, and the Classics of rites and music would help educating scholars, officials and the people at large. The offices described in the Zhouli å¨ç¦® \"Rites of the Zhou\" would make sure a peaceful administration, and the chapter Yugong ç¦¹è²¢ \"The Tribute of Yu\" in the Shangshu would contribute to better river conservancy measures. The changes described in the Chunqiu and the associated Gongyang Commentary showed, as Wei Yuan argued, that change is a permanent matter of history, and the contemporary government therefore had also to adapt to circumstances.\n\nHe therefore suggested changing the traditional way of delivering tribute grain along the Grand Canal, to change the salt distribution politics and to reduce taxes. He also stressed that the government had to see to it that merchants were not oppressed but were supported by the state to help the nation prospering. Wei Yuan can thus be seen as a forerunner of the reformers of the late 19th century that also based their arguments for reform on traditional writings.\n\nWei Yuan compiled many books, including his geography Haiguo tuzhi, the military history Shengwuji èæ­¦è¨, as well as numerous commentaries on various Confucian writings. He also participated in the compilation of He Changlin's Huangchao jingshi wenbian çæç¶ä¸æç·¨, a collection including memorials on statecraft.\n\nSource:"
