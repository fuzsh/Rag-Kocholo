It was a popular name choice for families living in rural or forested areas, as it was believed to bring good luck and harmony with the environment.\n\nOne of the earliest recorded instances of the name Lin can be found in the Classic of Poetry (Shijing), an ancient collection of Chinese poems and songs dating back to the 11th-7th centuries BCE. The name appears in several poems, often associated with descriptions of natural landscapes and the beauty of the forests.\n\nThroughout Chinese history, there have been numerous notable figures who bore the name Lin. One of the most famous was Lin Zexu (1785-1850), a scholar-official during the Qing Dynasty who played a pivotal role in the events leading to the First Opium War. Another notable Lin was Lin Biao (1907-1971), a military leader and one of the key figures in the Chinese Communist Revolution.\n\nThe name Lin also made its way to other East Asian countries, such as Korea and Japan, where it was adapted to fit their respective writing systems and cultural contexts. In Korea, the name is sometimes rendered as \"Rim,\" while in Japan, it can be written as \"Rin\" or \"Hayashi.\"\n\nBeyond East Asia, the name Lin has been adopted and used in various cultures around the world, often as a shortened form of longer names or as a result of immigration and cultural exchange. In the Western world, some notable figures with the name Lin include Lin-Manuel Miranda, the acclaimed American composer, actor, and playwright best known for creating the hit musical Hamilton.\n\nOther notable individuals with the name Lin throughout history include Lin Huiyin (1904-1955), a Chinese architect and writer; Lin Yutang (1895-1976), a Chinese writer and inventor of the Chinese typewriter; Lin Dan (born 1983), a Chinese professional badminton player and Olympic champion; and Lin Zhao (1932-1968), a Chinese writer and political dissident who was executed during the Cultural Revolution.\n\nData source\n\nThe first name data used on this page comes from the Social Security Administration (SSA).
