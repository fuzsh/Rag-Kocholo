        "text": "The site of Lin Zexu Opium-destroying Pool is located at the gate of Taiping Town, Dongguang County, Guangdong Province. There are Humen People's Anti-British Monument in the Opium War (1840) and Opium War Museum.\n\nThe site of Lin Zexu Opium-destroying Pool is leaning on Niubei Mountain in the north, with the Pearl River in the south. In its west, there stands the pass of the Taiping Town.\n\nIn the late 1930s, the smuggling of opium to China from Britain and America was rampant, posing a big threat to the Qing Regime. With the support of the great mass, Lin Zexu, Imperial Commissioner of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), was determined to ban the entry of opium. He even forced British and American dealers to hand over more than 20,000 boxes of opium, weighing over 118.5 million kilograms altogether, and burnt them in public from June 3 to 25, 1839 in Humen. Two quadrate pools, with each side measuring 45 meters, were used to destroy the opium. The pools are made up of flagstones on its bottom, having rails around. There are a culvert near them and a drain behind. When burning the opium, people first filled the pools with water and then put salt into them to turn the water into thick brine. Opium was put into the thick brine then to be dissolved, and at last quicklime was put in it to get the opium disintegrated completely. The destroyed opium was drained to the river.\n\nThe Site of Humen Batteries is located on the Chuanbiyang, the estuary of the Pearl River, Guangdong Province. As there are two mountains named Mount Big Tiger and Mount Small Tiger around the Pearl River, the place got a name Humen, meaning Tiger's Gate. There exist Shaojiao Battery, Weiyuan Battery, Lin Zexu Monument, tombs for these who fell in battle named Tombs of the Valiant and Tombs of the Devoted available for people to memorialize."
