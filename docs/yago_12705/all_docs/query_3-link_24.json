        "text": "Luciana Grasso talks to Paul Salfen about her role in horror film THE LAST MATINEE. Grasso, who is from Argentina, talks about the theater culture of her country, and crossing from theater to film.\n\nSYNOPSIS: The audience attending the last showing of a horror film in a small downtown cinema are terrorized by a murderer who begins to pick them off, one by one. The only person to notice that something strange is going on is the projectionist’s daughter.\n\nAbout Luciana Grasso:\n\nStarting her acting career at the age of 16, Luciana has a number of on-screen credits including: Elige by Nicolás Goldar Parodi, Otros Pecados by Daniel Barone, Número Primo by Evangelina Montes, Chico Conoce a Chica by Sebastián Mega Díaz, El Secreto de Julia by Ernesto Aguilar, Las Noches Son de Los Mounstruos by Sebastián Perillo, Terror 5 by Federico & Sebastián Rotstein, and Mucama de Vampiros for UN3 & SPACE. Her on-stage acting credits include: Mientras, a show of Danza Butoh by Rhea Volij, Como Si Pasara Un Tren by Lorena Romanin, Yo No Duermo La Siesta by Paula Marull, Las Niñas No Deberían Jugar al Fútbol by Marta Buchaca, and Jettatore by Rubens Correa. During quarantine, Luciana filmed several at-home Microteatro projects including “CUARTO B DE BUENA” and “Rutini.” She is now in the midst of rehearsals for a children’s show, Ana and Wiwi, as well as Luz Testigo, a play by Javier Daulte. Luciana is set to begin production later this summer on several Argentinian-directed films. In addition, she is currently working on the script for her first film, which she will also direct."
