        "text": "Golde Flami, a film star in 1940-50s Argentina, died July 20 in Buenos Aires. She was 89.\n\nBorn Golda Flon in a small village of Ukraine, Flami came to Argentina with her parents, a dressmaker and a shoemaker, at the age of 5.\n\nShe made her start in a Yiddish theater in the Jewish community of Villa Crespo, a central district of the capital. Her professional debuts came at the age of 14 on stage and 10 years later in film, with a part in “En el viejo Buenos Aires.”\n\nHer performance in “Los dos rivales” (The Two Rivals), a 1942 drama directed by Luis Bayon Herrera, launched her career that included dozens of TV series, more than 100 theater productions like “The Witches of Salem” and nearly 40 movies including “Deshonra” (Dishonor), “Se llamaba Carlos Gardel” (The Name Was Carlos Gardel), “La Mary” and “Los gauchos judios” (The Jewish Gauchos).\n\nHer career extended into the 1980s, with performances in Hector Olivera’s thriller “Two to Tango,” Anibal Di Salvo’s “Atrapadas” (Condemned to Hell) and Fernando Ayala’s “Pasajeros de una pesadilla” (Nightmare’s Passengers)."
