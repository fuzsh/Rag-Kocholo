        "text": "Joyce Yarrow’s novel Stolen Lives, the second installment in the Zahara series, deftly combines historical intrigue with supernatural elements to create a compelling narrative. The protagonist, Alienor, is not only a journalist but also a psychic, gifted with the ability to witness past events through the eyes of her female ancestors. This unique ability embroils her in a dangerous quest to uncover the fate of family members lost under Spain’s Francoist regime and to reunite mothers with children forcibly taken at birth. As the story unfolds, Alienor’s connection to her ancestors deepens, leading her to the discovery of distant relatives and putting her in the crosshairs of unknown adversaries. Her psychic journey also uncovers a trove of stolen gold coins, bringing peril to those she holds dear. This raises a poignant question: Are some stories too perilous to pursue?\n\nStolen Lives is a masterful blend of suspense and drama, characterized by its fast pace and the seamless integration of multiple timelines and hidden secrets. Yarrow’s narrative prowess is evident in her creation of robust, stubborn characters who are willing to challenge limits to seek justice. While the use of foreign terms occasionally challenges the reader, it ultimately enriches the authenticity and depth of the setting. The novel culminates in a satisfying resolution, providing relief after a series of intense, disheartening events.\n\nFor readers drawn to historically rich thrillers that boast engaging dialogue and resilient characters, the Zahara series promises to be a rewarding experience. The author’s notable work captivates and educates, leaving a lasting impression with its intricate storytelling and vivid characterizations.\n\nJoyce Yarrow’s Stolen Lives is a testament to the power of historical narratives woven with supernatural flair. Through its intricate plot and dynamic characters, the novel not only entertains but also invites readers to ponder the ethical implications of delving into painful pasts. This balance of thrill and thought makes the Zahara series a valuable addition to the shelves of those who appreciate thrillers enriched with history and heart."
