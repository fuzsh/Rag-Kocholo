Phoebus-Film.\n\t\n\t<b>Manuel Granada</b> (6 November 1896 - 30 January 1974) aka Manuel Granado and Paul Ellis,  was an Argentine actor who appeared in American, Spanish, Argentine and Mexican films. He made his film debut in the Metro-Goldwyn film The Bandolero in 1924 under the name Manuel Granada, but would soon become better known as <b>Paul Ellis</b> in films such as Three Hours (1927) and The Bridge of San Luis Rey (1929). Ellis would have a long career but mostly as supporting actor. In the early 1930s he was in Spanish language versions of Hollywood productions, while during the 1930s he also played Latin-American evildoers in such films as the exploitation film Marihuana (Dwain Esper, 1936) and the Spanish spoken American film Papa Soltero/ Bachelor Father by Richard Harlan. This typecasting continued in his - often uncredited - small parts in Hollywood films during the war years. After the war, Ellis moved to Argentine, where he played in various films between 1946 and 1970. Here he had major parts e.g. in Sacachispas (1950), a film evolving in the soccer world, and El seductor (Luis Bayón Herrera, 1950), but most parts were small. At times he used his original name instead of Paul Ellis. All in all, Ellis acted in over 110 films. At the end of his career, he also acted in 16 episodes of the long running Spanish TV series Crónicas de un pueblo (1971–1974).",
