        "text": "pa-o-lah\n\npa-o-lah is a self-portrait poetic documentary about Paola Méndez Colón. In the film, Paola describes what it’s like to grow up so far away from family and her cultural roots. Navigating through the climax of her decade-old cultural identity crisis, she is faced with the urge to move out of the United States but not knowing where to go. As Paola prepares to graduate from college she is tempted with exploring Spain or coming back to her Puerto Rican roots. Seeking a place to thrive in. A place to call home. A place where she can go by Paola.\n\nDirector: Paola Méndez Colón\n\nKey Cast: Paola Méndez Colón, Maribel Colón Vélez, Delia Vélez Pacheco\n\nMis Rizos\n\nIn this short poetic documentary, I challenge how curly hair is perceived in the Dominican community and how I was raised to think about it by my own Dominican mother. As young girls, we’re often told that we should tame our hair so that it’s easier to manage and as we grow older we realize, this is what our mothers learned from their mothers and that this issue spans over many generations, something my generation is trying to break.\n\nDirector: Anne Fernandez\n\nWriter: Anne Fernandez\n\nKey Cast: Laurie Fernandez\n\nMarvelous Butterfly Garden [Maravilloso Mariposario]\n\nMaravilloso Huerto de Los Niños is a children’s community garden in Barrio Almirante Sur, Vega Baja, Puerto Rico. The project was developed after Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico in September of 2017. The children of this community are learning what it means to be as self sufficient as possible and trying to figure out what we can do to survive and thrive in a post-Maria Puerto Rico. The children’s food and butterfly garden aims to revitalize our land, grow our own food, engage in small conservation efforts and be more resilient to future challenges.\n\nDirector: Lin Yvette Benitez\n\nKey Cast: Jonuel Rodriguez, Amanda Sofia Quintero\n\nJust If this\n\nIn the dance and party environment in the house of the Báez family. Marcos answers the questions to his father Felipe, but Marcos goes into a trance of memories about his relationship with Rosa, the girl with whom he has a relationship that ended before that party of the new year. When the conversation with his parents ends, Marcos says goodbye, Felipe and Carmen dance to the rhythm of a bachata ending the night.\n\nDirector: Esteven Garcia\n\nWriter: Esteven Garcia, David Skup\n\nKey Cast: Daneurys Guzmán, Lucely Pepín, Mónica Volonteri, Rafael Taveras\n\nBad Bugs\n\n10-year-old Bryn made a claymation movie about the importance of using “natural solutions for your bug problems” – something she’s passionate about. The idea came after one of her “grub hunting” sessions (she loves gathering grubs for the birds and lizards). She loves gardening almost as much as animation, so it was a perfect fit. The animation was awarded the “Grand Recognition Award” at the “Ivie Awards” in San Diego California. The video is currently being shared by many in the gardening community, who are encouraging Bryn to enter the film into festivals (because it’s both educational and hilarious). Thank you for your consideration.\n\nDirector: Bryn Wright\n\nWriter: Bryn Wright\n\nKey Cast: Bryn Wright\n\nBehind the Mask, Survivors\n\nThis documentary is based on real life. The story of a journalist in the pandemic named Paulina Aly. She has a non-profit foundation called “Sobreviviras, survivor” and serves the minorities on the streets of Miami, homeless, families with low income. She collects money from the social media community to do these activities. The pandemic affects too much because as long as the TV was “staying at home”, the government took to the streets hundreds of people for not being able to pay the rent. Everything becomes difficult. Going out to give them food and clean clothes every week, with a double mask for protection, Paulina Aly is a cancer survivor. Life changes for Paulina in March 2020 is in full production with a famous guitarist when President Donald Trump declares a STATE OF EMERGENCY in the United States. The depression is increased every day by the loss of friends at the hands of the covid-19 virus. She is strong but collapses. The ending is positive as the work of Paulina is well known in Miami and other countries for its altruism.\n\nDirector: Paulina Aly, Atiat Cari Aly, Ramadan Aly\n\nWriter: Paulina Aly\n\nKey Cast: Paulina Aly\n\nDetox\n\nAfter her only true love left, Clara, the protagonist of this honest arthouse project, lived the most devastating experience of her life. Even though she tried to find her own ways of dealing with loneliness, nothing felt the same as it used to be when her girlfriend was around. Through powerful imagery and strong metaphors of love and life, Clara navigates the different stages of a detoxification process. What is she detoxing from? Can she detox people out of her live? What if the most distressing aspect of dealing with emptiness is facing that time might not heal everything and, after all, we might not completely recover from the loss of our only true love.\n\nDirector: Katherine Cattani\n\nWriter: Katherine Cattani\n\nKey Cast: Delfina Alden\n\n#DanzaRestless\n\nIt is a collaboration composed of 4 audiovisual pieces that are articulated as postcards or impressions of the confinement. Four glances from four different choreographers who, separated by time and geographical borders, direct the movements of a single performer. The dancer, from the intimacy of his confinement, makes a time-space tour of his apartment, reinterpreting places and objects to transform them into the forced scene of this pandemic. A challenge for the interpreter, a Chilean dancer living in Tribeca New York, the center of the pandemic and the anti-racial outbreak, who alone had to juggle the technical and logistical tasks to record and rehearse the various choreographies that make up these works, sometimes all in the same day, turning his department into a creative experimentation laboratory where the body and its different dimensions take on an unusual thickness. With Symphony No.9 in D Minor, Op. 125, by Ludwig Van Beethoven as a tribute to the 250th anniversary of the German composer’s birth.\n\nDirector: Eduardo Zúñiga , Edgar Zendejas , Esdras Hernández , Sebastián Arias\n\nWriter: Eduardo Zúñiga , Edgar Zendejas , Esdras Hernández , Sebastián Arias\n\nKey Cast: Mauricio Vera, Julia Bengtsson\n\nEnd Violence Against Women\n\nThis short film has been made to raise a voice to protect women’s rights and to discourage violence against women. It is a bitter truth that even today, in different parts of the world, many people do not like or prefer that girls/women should get an education, do jobs, join different professional fields in the job market, or participate in any outside activity. Cultures, laws, systems, structures of different societies, and many other different factors also play a huge role due to which we see incidents of violation of human rights, domestic violence incidents, not encouraging women to get higher education, or do jobs, etc. Violation of women’s rights and violence against women can happen in different forms/ways. Basically, this short film touches on two main issues: 1- Violence Against Women, 2- Women’s Rights.\n\nDirector: M Riz\n\nWriter: M Riz\n\nKey Cast: Maryam, Maeesha, Dr. Z, M Riz\n\nFather Daughter\n\nIt’s another typical day for eighteen-year-old Maria while she is at school. She doodles in English, dozes off in Spanish, and picks a fight…again. It’s the same old same old. Someone gives her a hard time for being Cuban, so she gives them a hard time. This time around though, Sister Margaret, the all girl’s Catholic school principal and old school nun, really isn’t having it. She calls Maria’s parents, Celia and Eduardo, and has them pick her up. But when it comes to finding peace and controlling herself, will Maria side more with her mother’s solution, or her father’s? Celia decides that she will cure her daughter’s wild ways by taking her to church. Her father, Eduardo, a former Cuban boxer turned repairman, is determined to show her how to fight the right way and show her how boxing can be a way of making peace and finding one’s faith. Will Maria find peace and faith in boxing, or will she return to her fighting ways?\n\nDirector: Sophia Costanzo\n\nWriter: Sophia Costanzo\n\nKey Cast: Carola Di Franco , Shira Alon , Bud John Phineas\n\nGreat\n\nSoul Gemz Entertainment artist Yung Musa lifts his voice for this Anti Bullying Video/PSA Campaign .and the anti -bullying anthem, “Great”. According to Yung Musa, it was conceived as a message to kids. “I wanted to tell kids that they can achieve anything they set out to do. As the chorus of the song explains. I got goals, I got visions, watch me go watch me get it.”\n\nThe video was shot on location at a fitting location, Medgar Evers High School in Brooklyn New York.\n\nDirector: Al Wright\n\nWriter: Al Wright\n\nKey Cast: Yung Musa\n\nHey Joe\n\nHey Joe provides a glimpse into the life of a Mexican-American teenager whose daily routine is interrupted by law enforcement. My short film is loosely based on my father’s experience with police harassment and racial bias in the late 1960s. The film explores the idea that systemic racism continues to be a significant issue in our country, impacting people of color in real and painful ways. The titular character, Joe, is a fieldworker, friend, and warm person, who unfortunately struggles with the fact that he cannot change an immutable characteristic (skin color). It is this physical characteristic that makes him a target of discrimination.\n\nDirector: Miranda Montenegro\n\nWriter: Miranda Montenegro\n\nKey Cast: Christian Rodríguez, Gil Rebollar, Matt Dessert, Tim Cochran\n\nHope Unleashed\n\nSister Pauline Quinn started the first prison dog program at the Washington Corrections Center for Women in 1981 as a way to help others heal as she did by helping abandoned dogs. In this film, she re-visits two prisons, the original Women’s prison, as well as The Men’s Colony in San Luis Obispo, Calif. Inmates, some who identify as murderers, find redemption and healing by training service dogs for veterans and first responders suffering from Post-Traumatic-Stress Disorder (PTSD). Hoping for future careers, both women and men felons train and work as dog groomers and assistance-dog trainers. In-depth interviews with inmates, wardens, veterans, those in need of a service dog, as well as Sister Pauline, describe in moving detail how these programs have changed their lives for the better. Filmed at the Washington Corrections Center for Women, and the Men’s Colony in San Luis Obispo, Calif.\n\nDirector: Tula Asselanis\n\nWriter: Tula Asselanis\n\nKey Cast: Sister Pauline Quinn\n\nI Knew Her As Mandy\n\nBased on a true story.

Cerda\n\nWriter: Christopher A. Cerda, Lisa S. Cerda\n\nPushed Out\n\nOakland in the 80s and 90s was not a great place as crime and violence ravaged the city. But as the years pass the city becomes more and more modernized and safe due to gentrification.

However, it is still not too late for people to take action, but it requires that everyone must cooperate, including world leaders.

Sort of like the things he ask these guys. Noah to build the Ark on dry land miles and miles from any type of rivers or seas. And like Moses when he led Gods people out of Egypt and then he came face to face with the Red Sea. This one I really love Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego in the burning furnace. All these things was uncomfortable for these guys but in the end they was rewarded. And just because they believed in something greater than their little moment of being uncomfortableness. Now here my story. “Women’s Basketball Association Hall Of Fame” is now under renovation and hoped to be finished by February 2021. Here you will be able to learn the true story of where the WNBA came from. And finally learn about the pioneer efforts of the WBA, their players, coaches and the vision that GOD gave me in bringing women’s professional basketball here to the United States. This museum The Black Archives Of Mid-America at 1722 E 17th Terrace Kansas City Missouri 64108 will be open to all during its regular business hours. We look forward in seeing you there one day in the near future.\n\nDirector: Lightning N Mitchell\n\nWriter: Sandra K Mitchell\n\nKey Cast: Lightning N Mitchell\n\nThe Dark Side of The American Dream\n\nThis is a documentary presenting the struggles of Monse Soria and growing up as a DACA student in the United States.

I felt the need to create a piece that openly appreciates the feast as I’ve never seen anything publicized about its legacy or how much its means to those who participate. Especially with last year being the first year they had to cancel due to COVID since World War II, I feel as though it was extra special that I create this documentary.\n\nDirector: Erica Star Domena\n\nWriter: Erica Star Domena\n\nKey Cast: Mateo V., Norman López, Annika Hernández, Marc, Ashley, Anthony Amore, David Crane, Jason Wallin, Lauren Lefkowitz, Miles Hardamon, Layla\n\nTwo Girls and their Misogynist School District\n\nYouth examine systemic misogyny in their school district and how they believe students have been discriminated, silenced, and harassed by site administrators and district officials.
