That the jerk locked the cat in the closet because he was &apos;dying&apos;- ewww - I dunno, that brief scene made me sick (oh, and the girl who killed Stone was creepy as fck).\r<br>\r<br>Oh yeah, and we started watching the first 1/2 hr of the dreadful Pulse 2 and sure enough, there&apos;s some lunatic EATING his cat.....we both gave up on that flick pretty fast - not because of that, but because it was so effing LAME:)\r<br>\r<br>What&apos;s with the cat hate????!!!!!!\r<br>\r<br>:)",

        "text": "I'm going to have to agree with you there. I'm far from being a stranger to violent and gory films, but the extraneous scenes involving cats within these movies did seem a bit over-the-top and obviously came from someone with a degree of negativity toward them.\n\nAnimal cruelty and death is a fairly common element in action and horror movies and is usually meant to instill strong emotions in viewers, akin to shock value. This filmmaker's treatment of it, however, was decidedly in bad taste, stemming from blatant hate, and only served to hurt an already struggling film.\n\nI'd expect some sort of flame from these comments, if anyone gave a damn about Pulse to begin with.\n\nreply share\n\nYou know, that was the one shot in the whole god-awful movie that affected me--the poor suffering, emaciated cat. (I admit it, I own a cat myself.) Just a cheap, hateful trick to get a reaction from the audience, and I guess in my case it worked, hah hah. Apparently the point was to show that once the \"techno-ghosts\" eat your soul (or whatever) and take away your will to live, it strips you of any and all humanity that would have cared enough to take two minutes out of your life and feed your cat.\n\nI didn't care about the deaths of all these characters the movie never even bothered to develop, but the cat stuck with me. I at least would have put it out of its misery or rushed it right to a vet--Kristen Bell's character's reaction seemed to be, \"Oh s---! A starving cat!... Oh well, whatever.\"\n\n-- Jettatore from Bolgia 9\n\nreply share\n\nrabksaj 16 years ago\n\ni hate cats they are filthy creatures like dogs and rats.\n\nreply share"
