        "text": "As I’m writing this address, my heart is filled with both pride and joy. An extraordinary journey which started on June 2012 is now officially coming to an end this April. Ironically, I’m also feeling a little anxious and sad at the moment, for I am about to leave a place that has been a home to me for Four years. And it is both a privilege and honor to be a part of the Perpetualite community.\n\nFour Years. Four incredibly amazing years. Trials, errors, hardwork, patience, perseverance, success – All happened and learned throughout that span of time. When I entered the halls of our university, I was still a high school kid dreaming to someday influence the lives of our people. A dream that now still burns with much light and promise to it. But the road to that dream was never a walk in the park. During my stint in college, I have learned that in order to get to the summit, you would face adversities, adversities that would sometimes make you want to go down and quit. But despite such, I learned that aside from knowledge, values are also gold. That for every problem, God has a solution. That for every challenge that we face, you should step up your game and beat the odds. And with all my heart I can proudly say that I became better leader and a better person.\n\nBeing a leader is what I constantly tell myself everyday. And it became a driving force for me from start to finish. I always aspired to be the best of myself and to always be a leader for myself first. As a person, I always believed that a leader should first be the best of himself before he leads others. That change should first be made by yourself before advocating it to others.\n\n“Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.” This line from President John F. Kennedy’s inaugural address has been a constant reminder of why I am pursuing this dream. And now I’m here. A step closer to my goals. And I could never be much prouder of this moment. Now it’s time for me to urge everyone to join me as I travel new paths ahead. Paths that would lead me to the fulfillment of my dreams and for the better of my fellowmen. I know that someday, when the day comes that my goals are finally done, we can finally be living the best days of our lives.\n\nThe whole time I spent within the corners of our Alma Mater, I have known persons that I would forever treasure. And in this regard I would like to recognize the persons behind me during this odyssey:\n\nTo the Faculty and Staff of the College of Arts and Sciences, for their continuous support on all of our undertakings and for providing us knowledge that would not be taken away from us.\n\nSpecial thanks is given to my mother from the university, Mommy Alma Jallorina, for being a very supportive friend and professor to us. Thank you!\n\nLikewise, thanks is given to Dr. Jan Yango, for everything he have taught us. Words cannot express how grateful we are to have you as our professor and adviser.\n\nAccordingly, Special thanks is also given to Atty. Melchizedek Guan, the ever kind and generous professor and father to PolSci Class 2016. You really are the best professor we ever had, and we would always be your ever energetic class. Thank you future ninong!\n\nTo Dean PJ Bermudo, for being the best dean ever. Thank you for everything you have done and given to us sir. I can never repay the goodness you have shown me and my society. We love you Dean!\n\nTo Dr. Nonet Cuy, one of the strictest professor I had. Thank you Ma’am for teaching us the value of hardwork and focus. We would forever be grateful to you.\n\nTo Atty. Arman Dimaguila, the future mayor of the city of Biñan, for his continuous support to our endeavors. I have learned so much from you sir, I hope to follow your footsteps for the years ahead.\n\nTo the City Vice Mayor’s Office of Biñan, for being supportive on all of our endeavors, including our thesis and internship. Thank you Ate Irene, Ate Evonne, Tita Winnie, Kuya Ayie and everyone part of this office.\n\nTo my psych friends and batch mates, for constantly complimenting me. Your compliments mean much to me and it kept me motivated through the years.\n\nTo my blockmates (I4AC), for being the best classmates ever. I have never been in a class as bright as ours, and I am privileged to be a friend to you. Thank you very much!\n\nTo my PolSci Society, for helping me learn many things. Just remember that you are all my brothers and sisters.\n\nTo my patotie family, for being with me through good and bad. We have each others’ backs and I know that it would still be the same for decades to come. (Jeff, Mazee, Riana)\n\nTo Paola, my dear friend whom I share my victories with. You have been such a good friend to me. Thank you for being there for me when I need someone to talk to about things I would never share to others, and for being my inspiration during my struggles. Thank you!\n\nTo Rav, my brother from another mother, for being my best buddy in college. You don’t know how thankful I am to have you as my best friend. We shared each other’s secrets and I know we would always be buddies throughout our lifetime.\n\nTo Lovely, my first ever college bestfriend. You know how much I love you and I appreciate all the things you have done for me. I am forever grateful to have you.\n\nTo Bea, my bestfriend from another dimension. Words can’t describe how thankful I am to have you. You’ve been there trough everything that happened to me, and you know every detail of my feelings. You are one of the best persons I know. Thank you bestfriend!\n\nTo my PolSci batch 2016, for eveything. We shared our triumphs and defeats and that made the bond stronger than ever. I know that someday, when time has come for me to fulfill my dream, you would be in my back and support me all the way.\n\nAside from the aforementioned persons, I would also like to thank my FAMILY, especially my mom and my Tita Luz, for being there for me everytime. I can never repay you but someday, I’ll give you the life we dreamed. I love you all!\n\nTo the City Government of Biñan for their programs and projects for the benefit of the youth of the city. This success would not have been possible without your assistance.\n\nLastly, to the ALMIGHTY GOD, for being the guiding light through everything. Thank you Lord and I would fulfill my promise to you!\n\nAnd as we part our ways with our Alma Mater, may the wisdom our institution have shared with us help us take the right path to success. Thank you everyone.\n\nThis is 12-0449-886 signing off.\n\nVenich Jammin Ramzel A. Pedron\n\nBachelor of Arts in Political Science\n\nMagna Cum Laude\n\nOn behalf of the great state of Illinois, crossroads of a nation, land of Lincoln, let me express my deep gratitude for the privilege of addressing this convention. Tonight is a particular honor for me because, let’s face it, my presence on this stage is pretty unlikely. My father was a foreign student, born and raised in a small village in Kenya. He grew up herding goats, went to school in a tin-roof shack. His father, my grandfather, was a cook, a domestic servant.\n\nBut my grandfather had larger dreams for his son. Through hard work and perseverance my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place: America, which stood as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many who had come before. While studying here, my father met my mother. She was born in a town on the other side of the world, in Kansas. Her father worked on oil rigs and farms through most of the Depression. The day after Pearl Harbor he signed up for duty, joined Patton’s army and marched across Europe. Back home, my grandmother raised their baby and went to work on a bomber assembly line. After the war, they studied on the GI Bill, bought a house through FHA, and moved west in search of opportunity.\n\nAnd they, too, had big dreams for their daughter, a common dream, born of two continents. My parents shared not only an improbable love; they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation. They would give me an African name, Barack, or “blessed,” believing that in a tolerant America your name is no barrier to success. They imagined me going to the best schools in the land, even though they weren’t rich, because in a generous America you don’t have to be rich to achieve your potential. They are both passed away now. Yet, I know that, on this night, they look down on me with pride.\n\nI stand here today, grateful for the diversity of my heritage, aware that my parents’ dreams live on in my precious daughters. I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that, in no other country on earth, is my story even possible. Tonight, we gather to affirm the greatness of our nation, not because of the height of our skyscrapers, or the power of our military, or the size of our economy. Our pride is based on a very simple premise, summed up in a declaration made over two hundred years ago, “We hold these truths to he self-evident, that all men are created equal. That they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights. That among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.”\n\nThat is the true genius of America, a faith in the simple dreams of its people, the insistence on small miracles. That we can tuck in our children at night and know they are fed and clothed and safe from harm. That we can say what we think, write what we think, without hearing a sudden knock on the door. That we can have an idea and start our own business without paying a bribe or hiring somebody’s son. That we can participate in the political process without fear of retribution, and that our votes will he counted ? or at least, most of the time.\n\nThis year, in this election, we are called to reaffirm our values and commitments, to hold them against a hard reality and see how we are measuring up, to the legacy of our forbearers, and the promise of future generations. And fellow Americans ? Democrats, Republicans, Independents ? I say to you tonight: we have more work to do. More to do for the workers I met in Galesburg, Illinois, who are losing their union jobs at the Maytag plant that’s moving to Mexico, and now are having to compete with their own children for jobs that pay seven bucks an hour. More to do for the father I met who was losing his job and choking back tears, wondering how he would pay $4,500 a month for the drugs his son needs without the health benefits he counted on. More to do for the young woman in East St. Louis, and thousands more like her, who has the grades, has the drive, has the will, but doesn’t have the money to go to college.\n\nDon’t get me wrong. The people I meet in small towns and big cities, in diners and office parks, they don’t expect government to solve all their problems. They know they have to work hard to get ahead and they want to. Go into the collar counties around Chicago, and people will tell you they don’t want their tax money wasted by a welfare agency or the Pentagon. Go into any inner city neighborhood, and folks will tell you that government alone can’t teach kids to learn. They know that parents have to parent, that children can’t achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white. No, people don’t expect government to solve all their problems. But they sense, deep in their bones, that with just a change in priorities, we can make sure that every child in America has a decent shot at life, and that the doors of opportunity remain open to all. They know we can do better. And they want that choice.\n\nIn this election, we offer that choice. Our party has chosen a man to lead us who embodies the best this country has to offer. That man is John Kerry. John Kerry understands the ideals of community, faith, and sacrifice, because they’ve defined his life. From his heroic service in Vietnam to his years as prosecutor and lieutenant governor, through two decades in the United States Senate, he has devoted himself to this country. Again and again, we’ve seen him make tough choices when easier ones were available. His values and his record affirm what is best in us.\n\nJohn Kerry believes in an America where hard work is rewarded. So instead of offering tax breaks to companies shipping jobs overseas, he’ll offer them to companies creating jobs here at home. John Kerry believes in an America where all Americans can afford the same health coverage our politicians in Washington have for themselves. John Kerry believes in energy independence, so we aren’t held hostage to the profits of oil companies or the sabotage of foreign oil fields. John Kerry believes in the constitutional freedoms that have made our country the envy of the world, and he will never sacrifice our basic liberties nor use faith as a wedge to divide us. And John Kerry believes that in a dangerous world, war must be an option, but it should never he the first option.\n\nA while back, I met a young man named Shamus at the VFW Hall in East Moline, Illinois. He was a good-looking kid, six-two or six-three, clear-eyed, with an easy smile. He told me he’d joined the Marines and was heading to Iraq the following week. As I listened to him explain why he’d enlisted, his absolute faith in our country and its leaders, his devotion to duty and service, I thought this young man was all any of us might hope for in a child. But then I asked myself: Are we serving Shamus as well as he was serving us? I thought of more than 900 service men and women, sons and daughters, husbands and wives, friends and neighbors, who will not be returning to their hometowns. I thought of families I had met who were struggling to get by without a loved one’s full income, or whose loved ones had returned with a limb missing or with nerves shattered, but who still lacked long-term health benefits because they were reservists. When we send our young men and women into harm’s way, we have a solemn obligation not to fudge the numbers or shade the truth about why they’re going, to care for their families while they’re gone, to tend to the soldiers upon their return, and to never ever go to war without enough troops to win the war, secure the peace, and earn the respect of the world.\n\nNow let me be clear. We have real enemies in the world. These enemies must be found. They must be pursued and they must be defeated. John Kerry knows this. And just as Lieutenant Kerry did not hesitate to risk his life to protect the men who served with him in Vietnam, President Kerry will not hesitate one moment to use our military might to keep America safe and secure. John Kerry believes in America. And he knows it’s not enough for just some of us to prosper. For alongside our famous individualism, there’s another ingredient in the American saga.\n\nA belief that we are connected as one people. If there’s a child on the south side of Chicago who can’t read, that matters to me, even if it’s not my child. If there’s a senior citizen somewhere who can’t pay for her prescription and has to choose between medicine and the rent, that makes my life poorer, even if it’s not my grandmother. If there’s an Arab American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process, that threatens my civil liberties. It’s that fundamental belief ? I am my brother’s keeper, I am my sister’s keeper ? that makes this country work. It’s what allows us to pursue our individual dreams, yet still come together as a single American family. “E pluribus unum.” Out of many, one.\n\nYet even as we speak, there are those who are preparing to divide us, the spin masters and negative ad peddlers who embrace the politics of anything goes. Well, I say to them tonight, there’s not a liberal America and a conservative America there’s the United States of America. There’s not a black America and white America and Latino America and Asian America; there’s the United States of America. The pundits like to slice-and-dice our country into Red States and Blue States; Red States for Republicans, Blue States for Democrats. But I’ve got news for them, too. We worship an awesome God in the Blue States, and we don’t like federal agents poking around our libraries in the Red States. We coach Little League in the Blue States and have gay friends in the Red States. There are patriots who opposed the war in Iraq and patriots who supported it. We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.\n\nIn the end, that’s what this election is about. Do we participate in a politics of cynicism or a politics of hope? John Kerry calls on us to hope. John Edwards calls on us to hope. I’m not talking about blind optimism here ? the almost willful ignorance that thinks unemployment will go away if we just don’t talk about it, or the health care crisis will solve itself if we just ignore it. No, I’m talking about something more substantial. It’s the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs; the hope of immigrants setting out for distant shores; the hope of a young naval lieutenant bravely patrolling the Mekong Delta; the hope of a millworker’s son who dares to defy the odds; the hope of a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that America has a place for him, too. The audacity of hope!\n\nIn the end, that is God’s greatest gift to us, the bedrock of this nation; the belief in things not seen; the belief that there are better days ahead. I believe we can give our middle class relief and provide working families with a road to opportunity. I believe we can provide jobs to the jobless, homes to the homeless, and reclaim young people in cities across America from violence and despair. I believe that as we stand on the crossroads of history, we can make the right choices, and meet the challenges that face us. America!\n\nTonight, if you feel the same energy I do, the same urgency I do, the same passion I do, the same hopefulness I do ? if we do what we must do, then I have no doubt that all across the country, from Florida to Oregon, from Washington to Maine, the people will rise up in November, and John Kerry will be sworn in as president, and John Edwards will be sworn in as vice president, and this country will reclaim its promise, and out of this long political darkness a brighter day will come. Thank you and God bless you.\n\nHello, Chicago.\n\nIf there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible, who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time, who still questions the power of our democracy, tonight is your answer.\n\nIt’s the answer told by lines that stretched around schools and churches in numbers this nation has never seen, by people who waited three hours and four hours, many for the first time in their lives, because they believed that this time must be different, that their voices could be that difference.\n\nIt’s the answer spoken by young and old, rich and poor, Democrat and Republican, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, disabled and not disabled. Americans who sent a message to the world that we have never been just a collection of individuals or a collection of red states and blue states.\n\nWe are, and always will be, the United States of America.\n\nIt’s the answer that led those who’ve been told for so long by so many to be cynical and fearful and doubtful about what we can achieve to put their hands on the arc of history and bend it once more toward the hope of a better day.\n\nIt’s been a long time coming, but tonight, because of what we did on this date in this election at this defining moment change has come to America.\n\nA little bit earlier this evening, I received an extraordinarily gracious call from Sen. McCain.\n\nSen. McCain fought long and hard in this campaign. And he’s fought even longer and harder for the country that he loves. He has endured sacrifices for America that most of us cannot begin to imagine. We are better off for the service rendered by this brave and selfless leader.\n\nI congratulate him; I congratulate Gov. Palin for all that they’ve achieved. And I look forward to working with them to renew this nation’s promise in the months ahead.\n\nI want to thank my partner in this journey, a man who campaigned from his heart, and spoke for the men and women he grew up with on the streets of Scranton and rode with on the train home to Delaware, the vice president-elect of the United States, Joe Biden.\n\nAnd I would not be standing here tonight without the unyielding support of my best friend for the last 16 years the rock of our family, the love of my life, the nation’s next first lady Michelle Obama.\n\nSasha and Malia I love you both more than you can imagine. And you have earned the new puppy that’s coming with us to the new White House.\n\nAnd while she’s no longer with us, I know my grandmother’s watching, along with the family that made me who I am. I miss them tonight. I know that my debt to them is beyond measure.\n\nTo my sister Maya, my sister Alma, all my other brothers and sisters, thank you so much for all the support that you’ve given me. I am grateful to them.\n\nAnd to my campaign manager, David Plouffe, the unsung hero of this campaign, who built the best — the best political campaign, I think, in the history of the United States of America.\n\nTo my chief strategist David Axelrod who’s been a partner with me every step of the way.\n\nTo the best campaign team ever assembled in the history of politics you made this happen, and I am forever grateful for what you’ve sacrificed to get it done.\n\nBut above all, I will never forget who this victory truly belongs to. It belongs to you. It belongs to you.\n\nI was never the likeliest candidate for this office. We didn’t start with much money or many endorsements. Our campaign was not hatched in the halls of Washington. It began in the backyards of Des Moines and the living rooms of Concord and the front porches of Charleston. It was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give $5 and $10 and $20 to the cause.\n\nIt grew strength from the young people who rejected the myth of their generation’s apathy who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep.\n\nIt drew strength from the not-so-young people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on doors of perfect strangers, and from the millions of Americans who volunteered and organized and proved that more than two centuries later a government of the people, by the people, and for the people has not perished from the Earth.\n\nThis is your victory.\n\nAnd I know you didn’t do this just to win an election. And I know you didn’t do it for me.\n\nYou did it because you understand the enormity of the task that lies ahead. For even as we celebrate tonight, we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime — two wars, a planet in peril, the worst financial crisis in a century.\n\nEven as we stand here tonight, we know there are brave Americans waking up in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan to risk their lives for us.\n\nThere are mothers and fathers who will lie awake after the children fall asleep and wonder how they’ll make the mortgage or pay their doctors’ bills or save enough for their child’s college education.\n\nThere’s new energy to harness, new jobs to be created, new schools to build, and threats to meet, alliances to repair.\n\nThe road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep. We may not get there in one year or even in one term. But, America, I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there.\n\nI promise you, we as a people will get there.\n\nThere will be setbacks and false starts. There are many who won’t agree with every decision or policy I make as president. And we know the government can’t solve every problem.\n\nBut I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face. I will listen to you, especially when we disagree. And, above all, I will ask you to join in the work of remaking this nation, the only way it’s been done in America for 221 years — block by block, brick by brick, calloused hand by calloused hand.\n\nWhat began 21 months ago in the depths of winter cannot end on this autumn night.\n\nThis victory alone is not the change we seek. It is only the chance for us to make that change. And that cannot happen if we go back to the way things were.\n\nIt can’t happen without you, without a new spirit of service, a new spirit of sacrifice.\n\nSo let us summon a new spirit of patriotism, of responsibility, where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves but each other.\n\nLet us remember that, if this financial crisis taught us anything, it’s that we cannot have a thriving Wall Street while Main Street suffers.\n\nIn this country, we rise or fall as one nation, as one people. Let’s resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long.\n\nLet’s remember that it was a man from this state who first carried the banner of the Republican Party to the White House, a party founded on the values of self-reliance and individual liberty and national unity.\n\nThose are values that we all share. And while the Democratic Party has won a great victory tonight, we do so with a measure of humility and determination to heal the divides that have held back our progress.\n\nAs Lincoln said to a nation far more divided than ours, we are not enemies but friends. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection.\n\nAnd to those Americans whose support I have yet to earn, I may not have won your vote tonight, but I hear your voices. I need your help. And I will be your president, too.\n\nAnd to all those watching tonight from beyond our shores, from parliaments and palaces, to those who are huddled around radios in the forgotten corners of the world, our stories are singular, but our destiny is shared, and a new dawn of American leadership is at hand.\n\nTo those — to those who would tear the world down: We will defeat you. To those who seek peace and security: We support you. And to all those who have wondered if America’s beacon still burns as bright: Tonight we proved once more that the true strength of our nation comes not from the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth, but from the enduring power of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity and unyielding hope.\n\nThat’s the true genius of America: that America can change. Our union can be perfected. What we’ve already achieved gives us hope for what we can and must achieve tomorrow.\n\nThis election had many firsts and many stories that will be told for generations. But one that’s on my mind tonight’s about a woman who cast her ballot in Atlanta. She’s a lot like the millions of others who stood in line to make their voice heard in this election except for one thing: Ann Nixon Cooper is 106 years old.\n\nShe was born just a generation past slavery; a time when there were no cars on the road or planes in the sky; when someone like her couldn’t vote for two reasons — because she was a woman and because of the color of her skin.\n\nAnd tonight, I think about all that she’s seen throughout her century in America — the heartache and the hope; the struggle and the progress; the times we were told that we can’t, and the people who pressed on with that American creed: Yes we can.\n\nAt a time when women’s voices were silenced and their hopes dismissed, she lived to see them stand up and speak out and reach for the ballot. Yes we can.\n\nWhen there was despair in the dust bowl and depression across the land, she saw a nation conquer fear itself with a New Deal, new jobs, a new sense of common purpose. Yes we can.\n\nWhen the bombs fell on our harbor and tyranny threatened the world, she was there to witness a generation rise to greatness and a democracy was saved. Yes we can.\n\nShe was there for the buses in Montgomery, the hoses in Birmingham, a bridge in Selma, and a preacher from Atlanta who told a people that “We Shall Overcome.” Yes we can.\n\nA man touched down on the moon, a wall came down in Berlin, a world was connected by our own science and imagination.\n\nAnd this year, in this election, she touched her finger to a screen, and cast her vote, because after 106 years in America, through the best of times and the darkest of hours, she knows how America can change.\n\nYes we can.\n\nAmerica, we have come so far. We have seen so much. But there is so much more to do. So tonight, let us ask ourselves — if our children should live to see the next century; if my daughters should be so lucky to live as long as Ann Nixon Cooper, what change will they see? What progress will we have made?\n\nThis is our chance to answer that call. This is our moment.\n\nThis is our time, to put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids; to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace; to reclaim the American dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth, that, out of many, we are one; that while we breathe, we hope. And where we are met with cynicism and doubts and those who tell us that we can’t, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people: Yes, we can.\n\nThank you. God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America.\n\nThe 2016 Philippine General Election is my very first opportunity to select the leaders of the country – the persons that would represent the values, principles, and aspirations of their constituents. When I was a young kid, I was exposed to the various levels of the community, from those who can afford to buy anything they want to those who are economically disadvantaged. As a kid, I always wanted to help everyone, especially those whose lives are dependent on what others would provide them. I dreamed and hoped to someday be their voice, to be someone whose life would be dedicated to their betterment, to be someone who will uplift their quality of life, and to be someone who will represent their values and everything they are aspiring for. But suddenly, those hopes faded. My faith in the people I want to serve suddenly fluttered.\n\nAs a first time voter, I opened my eyes to everything that is happening, and all I see is a vicious campaign of hatred and manipulation. From Television to Social Media, propaganda of candidates trying to win the election surfaced. And such propaganda diluted the minds of the people, the very people I have hoped to lead.\n\nOur country have been in constant danger throughout the years, from calamities, terrorism, agrarian unrest, criminality, traffic, corruption, and poverty. Though they tried, the government repeatedly fail in solving several problems that caused dismay to the Filipino people. And I understand why the people is looking for someone who can address the issues hindering the growth of our nation. But while I understand the need for change, I am distressed by the way others reacted to such change. They were willing to do everything to have the man they believed that could bring change, be elected to the office which they think he deserves. They were willing to cross the line, spread rumors, tell lies, and make malicious imputations against those who goes against them. The Irony that such acts were made by people who wants change astonishes me. How can we advocate for change if we ourselves won’t? How can we believe that someone could make a difference if we cannot make difference for ourselves? CHANGE MUST COME FROM WITHIN.\n\nI admit, I commit mistakes. And sometimes, during the course of this campaign, I resorted to sharing informations that could degrade or discredit other candidates, and I admit I was wrong. I am not a perfect person. Most of the times, I commit wrongful acts that most of the people do. Occasionally, I disregard rules for personal convenience, and to that I can say that I am wrong. But I am willing to change. This election has taught me that change in oneself can only be achieved through your own efforts. You should not let other people impose upon you a law that you yourself can follow. I always believed that before you lead others, you should learn to lead yourself, and this I believed even more today.\n\nMy fellowmen, in a few days, we would be voting for the persons that would be leading the country in the succeeding years. I would not be endorsing anyone to you, for you have your own criteria of choosing your candidates. At the end of the day, you are your own man and not a puppet. Don’t ever let anyone suppress the rights bestowed upon you by our law for the sake of seeking peace, for peace without freedom is a free bird without wings.\n\nAnd friends, I want you to remember this always – “Ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country.” Be somebody that serves the country, and not someone the country serves. And someday, we would all recapture the lost hope.\n\n(List courtesy of Bar exam coach online)\n\n1. ABAD, Leslie Glenne C\n\n2. ABAD, Rachel Ann Katrina P\n\n3. ABEL, Jhoanna Marie M\n\n4.
