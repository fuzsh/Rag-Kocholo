        "text": "A rather awful timing but later i won't have any free time and... that's only a prologue [Vuelta] and it will properly start in Alfaguara.\n\nI want to clearly stress this out. This stage is not part of the Tour i'm doing. It's only an introduction to Gent.\n\nBecause Gent is one of not so common instances of an interesting Belgian city (i consider it the most interesting one, just ahead of Brugge and maybe also Leuven) and there's quite a lot to write about it. Sadly, there's also a lot to write about the stage Gent is part of. Because of that i decided to split the post into the main part which should be released tomorrow and an extra, which you read right now. To describe Gent i've used an unused prologue idea back, when this Tour started in the city.\n\nhttps://www.la-flamme-rouge.eu/maps/viewtrack/201076\n\nTour de France 2 – Extra. Gent ITT, 10,8km, ITT.\n\nCobbles (Kasseien):\n\nKantienberg – 600m, *\n\nSteenakker – 700m, *\n\nBagattenstraat – 400m, *\n\nGent is the capital and the biggest city of Oost-Vlaanderen or Flandre-Orientale in French. Oost-Vlaanderen doesn't need any further introduction as the majority of Belgian one-day races extensively covers the region. You have flat, mostly wet region of Waasland with some occasional cobbles (Etbos, Terneuzen in Netherlands, Brugge) and Flemmish Ardennes, where most of RVV-type races resolve.\n\nSaint Amandus was a VII c. bishop of Maastricht and Tournai. He was given a mission to christianize Franders by French king Chlothar II. He decided his HQ to be in what is now Gent, where he found two abbeys – Sint-Pietersabdij and Sint-Baafsabdij. Soon both abbeys were the most powerful in Flanders and Saint Amandus became the patron of Flanders. Gent itself soon was the capital of Duchy of Flanders (seat in Gravensteen).\n\nSaint Amandus.\n\nIn the middle ages the main income was from taxes on cereals (Korenmarkt). Traders, who used Leie (Lys in French) to transport their goods were forced to sell 1/4 of their goods in Gent. The city was also known for it's textile industry and craftmen guilds. The problems came with the 100 years War, when Gent chosed England which resulted in repeated attacks from France. Soon also Antwerp gained in importance after Sasse Vart Canal was built, which sort of choked Gent. This period lasted up to XVIII/XIX c. when Gent was one of the first cities in continental Europe to have a proper textile factory. It hosted EXPO 1913. Thankfully it wasn't affected by both World Wars so it's quite well preserved.\n\nVooruit.\n\nGent is not a stranger to cycling as it annually hosts Gent-Wevelgem and at times also Omloop Het Nieuwsblad. The most notable cycling persona born in Gent is definitely Bradley Wiggins. There's also Iljo Keisse, Gijs Van Hoecke and Tiesj Benoot. Other personalia includes one of the founders of the Dutch school in painting – Jan van Eyck and... Charles V, who ruled like half of the entire world. Last time Gent was featured in the Tour in 2007 as a finish to stage 2 won in a very weird bunch sprint (batterd by a crash) by Gert Steegmans, who i think was supposed to lead out Boonen, who finished just behind him.\n\nTiesj Benoot was just awesome during the 2018 Strade Bianche, which he won ahead of Bardet and Van Aert.\n\nThis prologue/ITT feaures 3 cobbled sectors – Kantienberg, Steenakker and Bagattenstraat. Both Kantienberg and Bagattenstraat are slightly uphill (max 5-6%). None of these sectors are difficult. Overall, there are 1,7km of cobbles, which is roughly 16% of the stage. Other potential difficulty could be tram lines, as some parts of this stage goes alongside them. Even if there's not that many turns i would still consider it mostly a technical time trial.\n\nKantienberg.\n\nSteenakker.\n\nBagattenstraat.\n\nI tried to pack as many monuments as possible. I think the only major one i'm missing is the gorgeous XII c. Gravensteen castle on the other side of Leie. It was originally the seat of Counts of Flanders. It was commisioned by Philip van de Elzas mainly to secure himself from Gent's craftsmen and imprison the more vocal ones. Since XIV c. it was gradually decaying. In XIX c. it was scheduled to be destroyed and probably replaced with some of those ugly modern Dutch homes (they had a beautiful marinistic style but decided for some ugly English knock-off). Thankfully it was (partly) restored and now it houses a museum of middle ages torture devices.\n\nGravensteen.\n\nI'm also missing on the Drongen Abbey, just west of Gent. It was one of the two abbeys that founded Gent. The modern abbey is from XVII c. as the old one was destroyed by Calvinists. XVII c. for Benelux was very hard as the region suffered from the Thirty Years War but also from local skirmishes as it was a battleground between Luterans, Calvinists and Catholics.\n\nThe start is on Vrijdagmarkt – one of Gent's historic makrets. In the middle of the markt is a statue of Jacob van Artevelde, who in 1340 proclaimed the English king as the king of France (it was during the first years of 100 Years War). He was killed on the square 5 years later. Vrijdagmarkt operates every Friday since 1199. it was also used as a festive place, where monarchs were greeted. It was also place of choice for public executions.\n\nVrijdagmarkt.\n\nThe oldest and most prominent building on this square is XV c. Tokeren – a former guildhouse. Near the market stands XI c. Sint-Jacobskerk – one of the oldest Romanesque churches in Belgium.\n\nTokeren.\n\nSint-Jacobskerk.\n\nFrom Vrijdagmarkt the stage goes via Kammerstraat, Belfortstraat and Limburgstraat, which includes very lavish XVI c. city hall, belfry and Sint-Baafskathedraal. Gent's XIV c. belfry is the highest in Belgium. Thoruhgout its history it was also used as a watchtower. Adjacent to the belfry is the city's cloth hall.\n\nStadhuis Gent.\n\nGent's belfry.\n\nXIV c. Sint-Baafskathedraal is primarly known as the place, where Holy Roman Emperor Charles V was baptised and for its art, which includes a painting by Rubens and an altar by Van Eyck brothers. This altar is considered to be a prime example of Dutch Reinassance. Just behind the cathedral is Geeraard de Duivelsteen – a XIII c. gothic castle/fort named after a local knight Geeraard Vilain (also known as Geerard the Devil).\n\nSint-Baafskathedraal.\n\nGeeraard de Duivelsteen.\n\nThe race continues alongside Muinkschelde canal and King Albert's Park to then enter the first cobbled sector of the day – Kantienberg. It leads to Sint-Pietersabdij (Saint Peter's Abbey). With the Drongen Abbey in VIII c. it was the founder of Gent. The abbey was founded by Saint Amand, main Christian missionary of Flanders.\n\nSint-Pietersabdij.\n\nFrom the abbey the race then reaches Citadel Park. It was created in place of a former citadel, which stood there for a short time during the Napoleonic wars. It's on a hill called Blandijnberg. Only one gate and the Leopold barracks survived. An indoor velodrome Kuipke is located in the park. It's normally the place, where Gent – Wevelgem starts.\n\nKuipke.\n\nNext roughly 4km are in more industrialized part of the city, so i can reach the 2nd cobbled sector – Steenakker. After that i'm returning to the center via Zwijnaardsesteenweg, Krijgslaan and Kortrijksesteenweg not really caring about the tram lines. The last part of the stage is mainly on Kortrijksepoortstraat with a small detour to include cobbled and uphill Bagattenstraat. At the end of Bagattenstraat is Vooruit – a sizeable cultural center built for EXPO 1913 which was hosted in Gent.\n\nAs the stage crosses Muinkschelde on Walpoortstraat it enters Koutermarkt – the 3rd historic market after Korenmarkt and Vrijdagmarkt. It specialises in flowers. The flower market is held there every Sunday since 1772. The finish of the stage is on Korenmarkt – the main historic market square in Gent. Korenmarkt is definitely the most beautiful and representative of them. In the middle ages it was a cereal trade center. Sadly, it's strangled with tram lines. I hope the city won't have too much problems if i kill their public transport for one day.\n\nKorenmarkt.\n\nThe most prominent building on this square is XII-XIII c. Sint-Niklaaskerk in very lavish gothic. Another prominent monument is also a lavish neo-gothic XIX c. post office (Oud Postkantoor), which now seems to be a shopping center.\n\nSint-Niklaaskerk.\n\nI hope i presented Gent well enough and also hope that the usage of trams won't be a big problem for the city. In my Tour stage i made sure to not cross any trams, especially as it'll be a week day stage. I also hope there's no big mistakes left.\n\nGent is quite far away from the action which means hellingen won't have as big of an impact as they could have. I guess if you want any (not big, but at least some) GC fight then Oudenaarde just after a cobbled climb (Koppenberg or Eikenberg?) should be the only viable option. I still think the Waterloo area could also be a viable alternative. Also, ASO sucks. Yay, what a revelation... Doing an Eddy Merckx commemoration by narrowly (intentionaly?) missing countless of cobbled sectors.\n\nThere are some similarities with Libertine's stage to Waregem but i went with my own Oudenaarde circuit. I decided to keep Koppenberg in because it's not only the best hellingen but also possibly the only one that kinda matters as i think the rest will be breezed off.\n\nPrevious stage: link\n\nhttps://www.la-flamme-rouge.eu/maps/viewtrack/232659\n\nTour de France 2 – stage 7.

Kasteelstraat (Nazareth) – 700m, **\n\nOverall: 12,7km\n\nMy objective was to pack this by far longest stage of the race with as many historic cobbled sections as i could. I decided to not care, how 95% of Belgian classics use them but do it myself. Sadly, i couldn't include Bosberg, Geraardsbergen and Varentstraat. I decided to watch RVV Cyclo, so i can have a closer look of these sectors. After watching the clips i think Koppenberg is by far the best one with Taaienberg and Eikenberg battling for 2nd. Paterberg is steep, but very short and Oude Kwaremont is long, but rather easy. I also decided to not do a RVV clone but something closer to E3 or Omloop.\n\nBecause of the stage's length and sheer amount of content i won't be as scrupulous as with other stages. I decided to separate Gent into another post, which you should see above this one. The first 70km are in French north, which was heavilly battered through both World Wars and is home to many, many military cemeteries. However, the main focus of this stage are the cobbled hills south of Oudenaarde.\n\nSadly, the length of this stage forced me to have a quite sizeable transfer from Épernay. Saint-Quentin is the farthest i can go. Originally i had (Libertine's favourite) Laon and the stage went to Lille using some obscure cobbles west of Lille but recently a \"mini PR\" did next to nothing (RIP Porte, Uran) so i decided to do something different that just show a couple of interesting cobbled sectors but having a much easier the stage as a result.\n\nThe original stage from Laon to Lille.\n\nSaint-Quentin is a former Roman (Augusta Viromanduorum) and Carolingian capital of Vermandois – a not so big county which now is part of Thiérache (Aisne dep.), which is the easternmost region of Picarde. Historically it was closely tied with Flanders.\n\nOise valley near Guise, Thiérache.\n\nThe town is known for its XII-XIII c. basilica dedicated to Saint-Quentin, from which the town takes the name. There's a legend that Saint Quentin (who evangelized the region in III c.) died in the city. Because of its strategic position at the very frontier of Paris it thrived as a commerce center but also was often sacked by wars (100 Years War, various skirmishes with Burgundy etc.). Because of that it had once quite extensive lines of defensive walls. The town was heavily damaged during the WW1, mainly because it was part of the Hindenburg Line (right in between Reims and Arras).\n\nBasilique Saint-Quentin.\n\nMain sights are the aformentioned basilica, XVI c. town hall and belfry with its 37 bells in a very Flanders-like flamboyant gothic, remains of a Roman road (Rue de la Chaussée Romaine) and a number of WW1 memorials and military cemeteries – one French and one German. Because of the damage WW1 did to the city most of the historical center was rebuilt in Art Deco style. Saint-Quentin is also a birthplace of many individualities like one of the biggest personalities of the French Revolution François-Noël Babeuf, Dominican monk Simon of Saint-Quentin who in 1245 accompanied Ascelin of Lombardia in a mission sent from Pope Innocent IV to the Mongols or Francis Moreau – a track and road cyclist who won gold in team pursuit in Atlanta 1996 and pursuit world championship in 1991.\n\nTown hall of Saint-Quentin.\n\nNearby towns and villages of Morcourt, Remaucourt, Fresnoy-le-Grand and Bohain were part of the aformentioned Hindenburg Line. With the last town (a medieval lordship and a textile center) a legend is associated that supposedly a local lord gave Joan of Arc to the English. In nearby Fonsomme are the roots of Somme. Between Bohain and Busigny the race leaves Aisne for Nord.\n\nIn Le Cateau-Cambrésis the race enters the region of Avesnois. The town was founded in XI c. It's mainly known for the treaty of 1559, which ended the Italian Wars of 1494-1559 between France, Italy and later the Habsbourgs. While France lost a lot of lands (mainly in Piemont) it managed to reclaim a bunch of cities over Somme of which Saint-Quentin was the biggest of them. In 26.08.1914 it was in the middle of a local battle won by Germany. It was also bombarded in 1940 during the WW2. Main sights include XVII c. Église Saint-Martin du Cateau, a museum dedicated to XX c. painter Henri Matisse, XVII c. town hall with a belfry and XIX c. Lefebvre-Scalabrino brewery.\n\nTown hall and belfry of Le Cateau-Cambrésis.\n\nThe northern France and Belgium had a heavy emphasis on the town halls (i guess influenced by the proximity to the Holy-Roman Empire), mainly in late Gothic and Reinassance. Some of them are lavish and flamboyant enough to enter the UNESCO WHS.\n\nXIII c. Chateau de Potelle near Le Quesnoy.\n\nLe Quesnoy – a former Vauban citadele.\n\nIn Le Cateau-Cambrésis the stage enters Chaussée Brunehaut. It links Mons with Saint-Quentin in a very straight line. It's a 64km long straight of variable width and even a small cobbled feature on the Belgian side (on that later). Because i'm joining it only from Le Cateau-Cambrésis (i didn't wanted to use D1004, former N44) the straight is only 35km long. An extension of it, which starts in an important Gallo-Roman town of Bavay leads to Fontaine between Charleroi and La Louvière. It's a roughly 40km long straight. Possibly it went roughly alongside Meuse to Namur and Liège.\n\nAvesnois.\n\nThis Chaussée Brunehaut thing is an old road of unknown or uncertain origin. There's a number of them but i think the one i'm taking is the longest one. They can be even as old as the Neolithic but i guess they might be some local, lesser known Gallo-Roman roads as all of them seems to lead to Bavay – once a large Gallo-Roman center of Bagacum. At that time it was an important crossroad between Galia, Germania and Boulogne-sur-Mer – a gateway to Britania.\n\nBagacum.\n\nThere's still a lot to cover so i think i'll cut only to the cobbles. The first sector starts right after crossing the border. It's 1,8km long and quite rough in some places. It ends in the village of Sars-la-Bruyère. From there the race continues on 6,6km long Rue de Dour to Athis, where another cobbled sector awaits – 1,1km long Rue du Paradis. It's one of the hardest sectors of the day, really resembling those of Paris-Roubaix.\n\nCobbled part of Chaussée Brunehaut.\n\nRue du Paradis.\n\nFrom Athis there are 4,5km on N552 to Dour, where another cobbled sector awaits – a slightly uphill 800m of Rue de Belle Vue to a field housing (since 1988) an annual Dour music festival, which takes place in late July (a Tour de France passage should be a nice advertisement of it). After that riders will return to N552 via Chemin de Thulin (home to another cobbled sector, but it's a dead end unless a short but rough dirt on Rue du Plat-Pied will be corrected) and Rue Benoît. From there the peloton will have some time to respite as the race goes west of Mons to Belœil.\n\nRue de Belle Vue.\n\nThe last cobbled sector of this part of the stage is west of Belœil on 1km long, very slightly uphill Rue Fénèque, between Quevaucamps and Wadelincourt. It's followed by a very narrow Rue Gaston Destrebecq and Rue des Briqueteries before joining back the wider roads in Wadelincourt, from where the stage goes straight into Frasnes-lez-Anvaing via Leuze-en-Hainaut. Next 25km are on an uninterrupted flat.\n\nRue Fénèque.\n\nBelœil is well known for one of those rustic Belgian castles, which often look like taken straight from a horror movie. This castle is from XIII c. built by the Ligne family – one of oldest Belgian noble families. It's surrounded by a large baroque park of XVII c. I'm mentioning it because at night it looks really well.\n\nChâteau de Belœil.\n\nChâteau de Belœil at night.\n\nFrasnes-lez-Anvaing is home to Château d'Anvaing. The origins of this castle are a bit uncertain. It was first mentioned in XII c. It was renowated in 1561 and 1800. In 28.05.1940 the Belgian army surrended to the Wermacht in the castle.\n\nChâteau d'Anvaing.\n\nFrom Frasnes-lez-Anvaing the race continues northwards towards a region called Pays des Collines, which roughly translates to \"land of the hills\". Sorry in advance, but my knowledge of this region is not good, so i guess some of the names are wrong. The first hill is Côte de la Croisette or that's what my map is telling, as Libertine has it as Côte de Bourliquet. It's just 2,4km at 4,2%, but there are 400m at 10% (max 13%) in the middle. The climb is entirely on tarmac. The descent on Rue Aulnoit is not the widest nor nicest descent in the world (max 10%).\n\nThe descent leads to a small village of Saint-Sauveur. It's a typical to the region village with a central square and a large church – this one Église de Saint-Michel. The next climb starts just outside the village and it's either Mont Saint-Laurent or Beau Site (i decided for the 1st name as the 2nd one i find ugly).\n\nProfile of Mont-Saint-Laurent.\n\nAs you can see above, it's all about the middle 400m at 13,5% (max 16%) or 11,5% according to LS. Interestingly these hardest parts are entirely on cobbles. That makes it possibly the southernmost hellingen of the general Oudenaarde area. Because of its remoteness and because it's in Wallonne it's quite rarely used by the countless of local Flemmish one-day races. I decided to descend the quite wide, straight but very steep Croix du Pile side and then reach Ronse (or Renaix) via Rue Chapelle Planchon.\n\nCobbles on Mont Saint-Laurent.\n\nIn 1963 and 1988 Ronse was hosting the WC. For some reason it apparently didn't use any cobbles. The main difficulty on the laps in both editions was Kruisberg. You can see LS mentioning both WC here. The 1988 finish was very dramatic. In the last 1km it was Claude Criquielion vs Maurizio Fondriest with a very late arrival of Steve Bauer. When sprinting, Criquielion was forced by both to go the wrong way along the barriers and ran into them when being boxed in by Steve Bauer. Fondriest, who went the other way won the sprint with Bauer taking 2nd before being disqualified.\n\nRonse.\n\nOf course Ronse means Kruisberg. While other races use Oudestraat (Oude Kruisberg) i decided for a tougher version via Groeneweg, which is a bit steeper and has a much rougher surface. Considering it's 90km from the finish line it should be only treated as a prelude before the hardest part of the stage, but it would be interesting to see this version in RVV and other Belgian classics. Sadly, i'm worried i'm a year too late. Of course the race then continues up to the top of Hotondberg.\n\nGroeneweg (at least before 2017).\n\nAfter the descent to the village of Mont de l'Enclus the peloton will climb Kluisberg – once a very popular climb but recently not so often used. Up to the 60s it was cobbled, but since then it became less and less used. The fact, that it's on the Wallonne side also doesn't help i guess. Nowadays it's occasionally featured in Dwars door Vlaanderen and Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne. I've included it to not have a long-ish flat before Oude Kwaremont and because is just one letter off of Kruisberg.\n\nProfile of Kluisberg.\n\nThe hardest part of the stage is kicked-off with Oude Kwaremont – a long, irregular, but imo not that hard hellingen. Of course it doesn't need any further introduction. Maybe there will be some souvenir at the top as it's one of the originals of the flemmish classics. I decided to spice things up a little by including Ronde van Vlaanderenstraat, which lengthens the climb a lil bit. If you have a road with that name in such a stage it wouldn't be nice to just omit it.\n\nProfile of Oude Kwaremont.\n\nOude Kwaremont.\n\nI decided to omit Watermolenstraat (or just Rampe, between Oude Kwaremont and Paterberg) because the descent from Kwaremont may be a bit too much for the Tour, but i hope someday RVV or any other Belgian classic will include it between Kwaremont and Paterberg as it does deserve much more than just obscurity (or maybe it is featured but under a different name?). Like Oude Kwaremont, i don't think Paterberg needs any further introduction. However, it's worth noting it's the first hellinge with a narrow and quite technical descent.\n\nProfile of Paterberg.\n\nWatermolenstraat/Rampe between Oude Kwaremont and Paterberg.\n\nSoon after Paterberg is Koppenberg (cobbled hill in Flemmish) and it's by far my favourite of hellingen. Apparently for RVV it has the status similar to Arenberg in PR but i consider it the only really worth something climb on this stage and omiting it would be very hard for me. It's quite long, very steep (similar figures to Paterberg) and the cobbles seems to be a bit rougher than those of Paterberg. Sadly, it's located 57km from the finish line, so i doubt it will have the impact it should have. The descent is narrow, quite steep and technical.\n\nProfile of Koppenberg.\n\nKoppenberg.\n\nRather than climb Eikenberg i decided to do a detour and include Stationsberg with Taaienberg and only then descend down via narrow Hasselstraat back to Etikhove. I quite like Stationsberg. In the latest iteration of RVV it's normally descended after reaching the top of Steenbekdries. This time i'm ascending the side they're used to descend. The cobbles look a bit rough in some places so maybe it's a borderline 2/3-star section. It's also a decent-ish climb with 0,9km at 7,2% (max 10%). Afaik it's climbed in E3 Harelbeke. From the top the peloton will still climb on 2-3% for roughly 1km. The descent is on Holandstraat and quite narrow Mellinkstraat. It ends right at the foot of Taaienberg.\n\nStationsberg.\n\nTaaienberg is nothing special, only 530m at 6,6% but the max gradient is 16% and it somehow always manages to deliver a fine ride. I guess it can be considered a potential sleeper. I decided to be a lil bit cheeky and placed a \"Souvenir Tom Boonen\" on top of it.\n\nProfile of Taaienberg.\n\nTaaienberg.\n\nFor some reason Eikenberg is my 2nd most favourite cobbled climb of the day, just edging out Stationsberg and Koppenberg. I don't know why. It's quite long and overally quite steep, but not as much to call it a \"muur\". Of course the gravel/tarmac roadside will be barricaded off from the riders. The top is still 40km from the finish line, so there's plenty of time to catch some breath. This time a nice and wide descent leads to Oudenaarde.\n\nProfile of Eikenberg.\n\nEikenberg.\n\nOudenaarde is a XI c. town – former fortress commisioned by the count of Flanders Baldwin IV as part of a defensive system against France. It was built after he took the land from the Holy Roman Empire. He also founded a Benedictine monastery, now in ruins since the French Revolution. Throughout the history it was one of the biggest and richest cties of Flanders.\n\nOudenaarde's town hall.\n\nModern Oudenaarde is mainly known for it's XVI c. town hall – part of UNESCO WHS list, but there's also XIII c. Lieve Vrouw van Pamele Kerk. Oudenaarde is also home to a museum dedicated to the Tour of Flanders which now seems to be courated by Freddy Maertens, one of the best sprinters ever who somehow managed to get top 10 in possibly the most mountain-heavy edition of the Tour at the time. He also won a Vuelta and was close to winning a Giro (crashed out).\n\nRuins of a XI c. Benedictine monastery, Oudenaarde.\n\nWhile the next 30km after Kwaremont are quite tough with Paterberg, Koppenberg, Stationsberg, Taaienberg and Eikenberg in quick succession i decided to shift the focus of this stage to some less known cobbled sectors north of Oudenaarde. This part of the stage starts with Lange Aststraat, located on the northernmost hills of the Oudenaarde area, roughly 10km from Eikenberg. It's the last hellingen of the race connecting N60 highway (since at least 3 years the road goes underneath the highway) to the hilltop village of Huise. Lange Aststraat is 0,5km at roughly 7%. The entire climb is on relatively easy cobbles. It's often part of Omloop Het Nieuwsblad & Nokere Koerse classics but sometimes it also features in other ones. The top is 29km from the finish.\n\nLange Aststraat.\n\nHuise is not particulary an interesting village – typical flemmish village with red brick houses, a large square with a church and cemetery in the middle. However, there are a number of cobbled roads near the village. Some of them are uphill. There is Huisepontweg used in Nokere Koerse, 200m uphill Lededorp in nearby village of Lede, 370m uphill Driesstraat leading from Lede to Huise and some minor ones on Korte Aststraat and Wannegem-Ledestraat.\n\nSint-Petrus-en-Urbanuskerk, Huise.\n\nAfter a short descent from Huise starts the last tough part of the stage – a combination of Molendamstraat and Oost Beertegemstraat (both part of Ouwegem). Molendamstraat is just only 350m but it's very painful. It's possibly the hardest sector that looks straight out of Paris-Roubaix. Sadly, it's too short to really inflict any significant damage. It's followed by Oost Beertegemstraat, which seems to be slightly easier than Molendamstraat, but considering the standards of flemmish cobbles it's still very rough. Both sections are separated by 480m long Beertegemstraat. This sector ends 26km from the finish line. It's soon followed by an intermediate sprint in the center of Ouwegem.\n\nMolendamstraat and Oost Beertegemstraat.\n\nLast 25km to Gent are quite straightfoward. They include only one, 700m long cobbled section in an interestingly named village of Nazareth (not the only peculiar name around Gent... Lochristi) on Kasteelstraat. Nazareth was probably named after the biblical city. It's a relatively typical flemmish village, but this time with a XVIII c. manor house on the outskirts. Kasteelstraat runs in front of it. It's flat, mostly straight and overall rather easy. It ends 16,5km from the finish.\n\nKasteelstraat, Nazareth.\n\nI tried to have the easiest possible run-in to the finish as Belgian roads tends to be technical and full of minor inconveniences. The run-in does include some smaller roads, but the last roughly 7km are wide. This run-in includes the villages of Sint-Martens-Latem and Sint-Denijs-Westrem. The finish line is not the same as Omloop's. I decided for a 740m straight of Charles de Kerchovelaan on the northern side of Citadel Park. The finish is slightly uphill (2-4%). While the GC should be shaped it still features plenty of narrow and quite technical roads including these cobbled climbs it could be very crash prone.\n\nI guess this stage may be closer to E3, Omloop or a much harder Kuurne-Brussels-Kuurne than RVV so it's still possible it will end in a somewhat reduced bunch sprint. If sprinters wants to win this stage this time they'll need to work his socks off. I also assume some Quick-Step pundits will try to win either from a breakaway or from a 50k ride. I guess someone of Quintana/Landa type will be put under heavy pressure, but i expect most of GC guys to not lose too much or any time. If Contador managed to do really well in Eneco 2012 and the \"mini Paris-Roubaix\" of 2018 TdF did nothing (RIP Uran, Porte), then i don't think it will be too hard for them to resist the hellingen.\n\nAfter Belgian cobbles it's time to go back to France, hopefully while pushing against the wind. This stage also has an unintentional theme of French military loses, as some of the places like Saint-Omer or Crécy-en-Ponthieu were home to major battles that France lost to either England or Flanders.\n\nPrevious stage: link\n\nhttps://www.la-flamme-rouge.eu/maps/viewtrack/196439\n\nTour de France stage 3. Kortrijk (Courtrai) – Abbeville, 195km, flat.\n\nClimbs:\n\nMont Noir – 1,9km, 4,3%, cat. 4, 147m\n\nMont des Cats – 2,3km, 4,1%, cat. 4, 152m\n\nCôte de Saint-Josse-au-Bois – 1,6km, 4,7%, cat. 4, 102m\n\nCôte d'Estruval – 1,3km, 4,4%, cat. 4, 68m\n\nCobbles:\n\nCassel – 1,5km, *\n\nMy take on echelon stages without using (very) narrow roads. Basically, every road in the stage is either 2-lane or almost 2-lane. To do an echelon stage it's good to check out, how much and from where the wind most often blows. Northwestern France is easy to predict thanks to the existence of La Manche Channel and the Atlantic Ocean, which means it mostly blows from west. However, the area also tends to be stormy. AFAIK the direction of storms there is normally SW or S, which would mean serious headwind. Normally i don't recommend using roads near the coast as the coastline is often heavily covered in either foliege or resort buildings, hence i try to keep some distance (up to ~50km) from the coast. More inland roads are often quite exposed.\n\nThe main chunk of the stage takes place in hilly plains collectively called Pays d'Artois. They're located between Flanders, Hainault and Picarde. It's mostly a rural, very open region (especially on plenty of naked hills). There's a number of small towns and villages but it's probably one of the least populated regions in France (not including the coast, which is heavily populated). There are planty of hills on this stage, but i decided to categorise only two of them – Côte de Saint-Josse-au-Bois and Côte d'Estruval, but there's a number of uncategorised rises, wich are borderline cat. 4. Even with those hills it still should be mainly a bunch sprint.\n\nArras – the capital of Pays d'Artois.\n\nI guess the most logical place for start should be Kortrjik (Courtrai in French). It's the easternmost major city of West-Vlaanderen. Kortrjik started as a Roman colony of Cortoriacum. In the middle ages it had a quite developed wool and flax industry. Because of it's location near the border of France and Holy Roman Empire it often suffered from wars and uprisings. In 1820 the Treaty of Kortrjik was signed, which laid out the current borders between France and Belgium. The city was heavily bombed during the WW2. Nowadays it's still an important textile and flax center.\n\nSint-Maartenskerk.\n\nMain sights include XIV c. town hall and belfry, XIV c. Broel Towers (Broeltorens) – only remaining part of a feudal castle, XIV c. Sint-Maartenskerk and XII/XIII c. Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekerk – where the Golden Spurs from the battle of 1302 are stored. Kortrijk's natives are Leif Hoste and Stijn Devolder.\n\nBroel Towers.\n\nIn 1302 a major battle between Flanders and France took place near the city. It's known as Battle of the Golden Spurs because a lot of golden spurs were left on the battlefield. It was a culmination point of Brugge's uprising against France, which at the time was controling the region. It was a major Flemmish win and the day this battle took place – 11 July, is the \"Flemish Community Day\". This win was mainly a moral one, as soon the Flemish did another uprising against their own count Louis I during which the French invaded and once again won the control over Flanders.\n\nOnze-Lieve-Vrouwekerk.\n\nKortrjik is a sizeable agglomeration, so it's quite hard to place the km 0, especially as on the outskirts of Kortrjik is a quite sizeable town of Wevelgem. Of course this relatively unsignificant town is home to Gent-Wevelgem. The town was heavily affected by both World Wars. In nearby Moorsele and Menen are German war cemeteries from WW1. Native to nearby village of Rekkem was Paul Deman – the 1st winner of RVV and also the winner of 1914 Bordeaux–Paris, 1920 Paris–Roubaix and 1920 Paris–Tours.\n\nPaul Deman at the 1913 TdF.\n\nAfter Wevelgem is Wervik, which is part of the the municipality of Comines-Warneton (Komen-Waasten), which consists of a bunch of villages (Comines and Warneton are the biggest). Interestingly, this commune is an exclave of Hainault (which also means Wallonne). Opposite of Comines, on the other side of Leie (Lys) is a bigger French town of also Comines. The political geography of the region is quite messy.\n\nWarneton.\n\nThe race will re-enter France just north of Armentières – part of Lille's agglomeration. The area was quite heavily battered during the first days of WW1 and Armentières was not different as a major battle took place here in 1914. The first road stage of TdF 1994 finished in the city and it was marked by a hard hit by Wilfried Nelissen and Laurent Jalabert, who decided sprints were too dangerous (no wonder with Abdoujaparov next to you) and did a Sky-esque transformation to become a GT rider.\n\nArmentières.\n\nArmentières is part of French Flanders, which is the northern outskirts of the departament of Nord. The names and history of the region is tied between France and Netherlands, hence the names in the region are often of Flemmish origin. Sadly, it seems once spoken in the area West Flemmish dialect is on the verge of extinction. The next town however has a purely French name. As the race goes alongside French-Belgian border it enters the town of Bailleul – a medieval castellany completly ruined during WW1. Nowadays it's surrounded by many war cemeteries, like basically most of northern France.\n\nBailleul.\n\nJust north of Bailleul is a small hilly range of Monts de Flandre, mainly known from the Gent-Wevelgem race. Obviously Kemmelberg (Mont Kemmel) is the most known. Other quite famous hills are Mont des Cats (Katsberg), Mont Noir (Zwarteberg) and Mont Cassel (Kasselberg). I'm tackling all of them from the \"wrong\" side. Mont Noir is home to an early XX c. villa of local nobility Marguerite Yourcenar and Mont des Cats is home to a XVII c. abbey of the Order of Saint Anthony and later Cistercians. The abbey specialises in cheese production.\n\nMont des Cats.\n\nMont des Cats abbey.\n\nBetween Mont des Cats and Mont Cassel are two very French sounding towns of Godewaersvelde and Steenvoorde. Steenvoorde was one of the first towns to suffer from Iconoclasts. This XVI c. outbreak was known as Beeldenstorm. Many catholic churches were looted or destroyed by mainly Calvinists as part of the Reformation. Sadly, most of modern Benelux suffered because of the Reformation and Thirty Years War, when the region was constantly changing hands between France, Spain and Holy Roman Empire. Overlooking both Godewaersvelde and Steenvoorde is Cassel.\n\nXVI c. Noordmeulen near Steenvoorde.\n\nThanks to its hilltop location Cassel (Kassel) was an important stronghold dating back to antiquity. It was the capital of what is now French Flanders, but after the invasion of Germanic tribes it lost its status to Tournai. During the middle ages Cassel was home to at least two battles – 1071's war of succession in Flanders and a Flemmish rebel of 1328. During XVI-XVII c the town rapidly changed hands between France, Netherlands and Spain. Yet another battle took place in 1677 as part of the 1672-1678 Franco-Dutch War. After said war the border moved away from Cassel so it wasn't battered untill both World Wars. During the first days of WW1 Cassel was the HQ of Marshal Ferdinand Foch. The town suffered in 1940 during a 3-day battle between the German and British armies.\n\nCassel.\n\nThe town is home to a XVII c. legend of giants Reuze-Papa and Reuze-Maman, which now have a dedicated carnival each Easter. Because of constant battles in and near the city not much has left and the majority of the town was rebuilt after WW in its historic Flemmish architecture and i need to admit it looks quite stylish.\n\nCassel's main square and some cobbles.\n\nOf course Cassel also means the southernmost flemmish hellingen. I'm not tackling the most popular side – Route de Dunkerque but the normally descended side of Rue du Maréchal Foch. Worth noting is a not cobbled murito on Rue d'Aire going under Porte d'Aire. Last 350m of this murito are at roughly 13%. The day's intermediate sprint is on top of Cassel, where the cobbles ends. The descent on D993 (Avenue Achille Samyn) is entirely on tarmac. Next 60km goes alongside the stage 4 from 2014.\n\nJust before Arques the race enters the departament of Pas-de-Calais – a heavily industrialized region (same with Nord) because of the mining craze of XIX/XX c. Since the 60's and 70's these mines are either tourned into museums or are liquidated. Because of mainly WW1 it has a big amount of war cemeteries, mainly in the eastern part of the department. Plenty of TdF commemorative stages took place in the area. However, with this stage i'm not focusing on WW1.\n\nAn example of a mine in Pas-de-Calais. Some of them are even part of the UNESCO WHS.\n\nFrom Cassel the race heads towards Saint-Omer. Just before it is Arques – place of a major battle between France and Flanders. Once again France lost. Only year later, near Zierikzee the French army finally won against the Flemmish. Since XIX c. Arques is also home to the biggest crystal manufacturer in the world.\n\nTown hall of Arques.\n\nSaint-Omer was founded as an VII c. abbey by Audomar, now known as Saint Omer, as the focal point of French Flanders christianization. This abbey, now known as the Saint Bertin Abbey, is partly in ruins. It was the first town in French Flanders to receive city rights (1127). In the early middle ages it was a textile center, but it soon was overshadowed by both Gent and Brugge. During the WW1 British air forces (future RAF) established their HQ in the city. In the WW2, near the city Nazis established a V-2 launch site. The main sights include the aformentioned abbey and XIV c. Cathédrale de Notre-Dame (with a painting by Rubens).\n\nCathédrale de Notre-Dame, Saint-Omer.\n\nSaint-Omer lies on the edge of Marais Audomarois – a large wetland in Pas-de-Calais that separates French Flanders from Artois. This wetland is protected by Caps et Marais d'Opale natural park, which is also an UNESCO Biosphere reserve. The race goes south of the wetlands via Wisques and Wizernes to Lumbres. Wizernes is home to La Coupole bunker system, where the previously mentioned V-2 launch site was located.\n\nMarais Audomarois.\n\nIn Lumbres the race enters Pays d'Artois – mostly open, rural and rolling stretch of land between French Flanders and Picarde. That's also, when the stage changes it's direction from southwest to straight south. Many roads are potentially open to echelons as the La Manche coast is roughly 20-30km to the west. The first stretch of openness starts before the village of Bourthes. These open roads are interrupted by local villages, but there aren't too many of them.\n\nXIII c. Château d'Hucqueliers – former seat of the counts of Boulogne-sur-Mer.\n\nAn open stretch of road between Bourthes and Hucqueliers.\n\nAs the race progresses across the open plateaus of Artois it also crosses a couple of small valleys of which some will be the base of the two remaining cat. 4 climbs – Côte de Saint-Josse-au-Bois and Côte d'Estruval. First such valley is Vallée de la Canche, where the stage goes between the towns of Montreuil and Hesdin.\n\nOpen stretch of road near Brimeux.\n\nMontreuil is particulary interesting as it's one of the oldest examples of a French Vauban-esque citadel, dating back to XVI c. – over a century before Vauban. Built into this citadel was also a XIII c. royal castle by French king Philip II Augustus. It was used as a fortress, securing the Atlantic coast from England and Artois from Flanders. Nowadays only two towers remain. The town was heavily damaged during a siege of 1537 by Charles V and the king of England Henry VIII. Because of the citadel the British have chosen it as their HQ for most of WW1.\n\nCitadel of Montreuil.\n\nWalls of the citadel of Montreuil.\n\nNext valley is Vallée de l'Authie on the border of the departments of Somme and Pas-de-Calais. The race goes nearby the Valloires Abbey – a XII c. Cisterian monastery. The abbey suffered during the 100 Years War, especially during a major battle of 1346 in nearby Crécy-en-Ponthieu. Already in XVII c. the abbey was abandoned and soon a new one was built upon the remains of the old one. This monastery is home to vast Jardins de Valloires garden created in the 1980's.\n\nValloires Abbey with the garden.\n\nOpen stretch of road near the village of Saint-Rémy-au-Bois.\n\nAfter crossing the Anthie valley the race enters the Somme department and the historical region of Picarde. The first town of this region is aformentioned Crécy-en-Ponthieu.\n\nOpen stretch of road on top of Côte d'Estruval.\n\nThere were 3 major English wins during the 100 Years War – Poitiers in 1356, Agincourt in 1415 and Crécy-en-Ponthieu in 1346. The battle was technologicaly importantas as it was one of the earliest documented uses of a cannon in a battle (ribauldequin). It also continued to show the importance of infantry against cavalry (a major trend at the time). The main effect of this battle was Calais falling to the English for the next two centuries. Crécy-en-Ponthieu was also a major British airfield during the battle of France in WW2.\n\nJean Froissart's depiction of battle of Crécy.\n\nOpen stretch of road near Crécy-en-Ponthieu.\n\nNext roughly 10-15km are almost entirely in open air with the only interruption in the villages of Domvast and Agenvillers. This section ends just before Millencourt-en-Ponthieu roughly 10km before the finish line.\n\nOpen stretches of road near Domvast and Agenvillers.\n\nThe finish is in Abbeville, which only recently was featured in Tour de France. For a relatively sizeable city (2nd in the dep. after Amiens) that's very little. Abbeville is located in the very middle of Picarde. It was aleady inhabited during Paleothic, as its name has been adopted to name a category of certain hand axes. The modern city was founded in VII c. by monks from various local monasteries (Saint-Valery-sur-Somme etc.). It soon tranformed into an important fortress and a sea port on Somme. During the 100 Years War the region heavily suffered, constantly changing hands between France, England and also Burgundy. In 1514 the king of France Louis XII married Mary Tudor of England in Abbeville. In late XVIII c. one of the first major factories in France by Van Robais was founded in the city. A quite interestng story occured during the WW2 involving the city as it was where in 1939 England and France decided to not send any troops to Poland... 5 years later the town was liberated by Polish 1st Armoured Division.\n\nAbbeville.\n\nMain sights are the XV c. church of Saint-Vulfran in lavish gothic, early XIII c. belfry – one of the oldest in France, XVIII c. Château de Bagatelle with it's large french garden – seat of Charles X, future French king, XI c. Église Saint-Sépulcre and various Paleolithic excavation sites around the city.\n\nBelfry of Abbeville.\n\nChâteau de Bagatelle.\n\nThe outcome of the stage will heavily depend on the wind and its direction. It can be either just a typical bunch sprint or the last 80km will be very interesting. Next stage will start on the other side of Somme. It'll have a hilly finalle featuring some hills near the Seine river, but they won't be the usuall Rouen hills.\n\nThe only stage in this tour to feature the Atlantic coast. It also bypasses the popular Rouen hills for slightly less popular Pays d'Auge (or Côte Fleurie). It's also possibly the only stage in Tour's history that features the start and finish in double towns – both quite well known Atlantic summer resorts. While this time not the main feature, the wind could potentially create echelons, but the majority of the stage will probably be in headwind and there's not as many open roads as on the last stage.\n\nLast stage: link\n\nhttps://www.la-flamme-rouge.eu/maps/viewtrack/200366\n\nTour de France 2 – stage 9. Eu-Le Tréport – Deauville-Trouville-sur-Mer, 189km, hilly.\n\nClimbs:\n\nCôte de Saint-Nicolas-d'Aliermont – 2,3km, 4,8%, cat. 4, 144m\n\nCôte de Sainte-Foy – 2,6km, 4,4%, cat. 4, 151m\n\nCôte de Trouville-la-Haule – 2,2km, 5%, cat. 4, 123m\n\nCôte de la Croix-Rouge (Honfleur) – 1,2km, 7,8% (max 13%), cat. 4, 99m\n\nCôte du Bout du Haut – 1,4km, 6,6% (max 16%), cat. 4, 127m\n\nCobbles:\n\nRue du Puits – 300m, *\n\nThe stage theoretically starts in Le Tréport, under the famous cliffs but the km 0 is just outside the nearby city of Eu. I decided to do the same the Tour did last year with Laissac-Severac L'Eglise and combine both towns into one. The finish line is also theoretically in the town of Deauville, which is historically a suburb of Trouville-sur-Mer.\n\nLe Tréport is a seaside resort on the Atlantic coast (La Manche Channel), famous for its 100m high, very picturesque white cliffs. Sadly, i don't think there's enough space under the cliffs to have a start but there's some on top of them so it might be a fine enough place for the start.\n\nThe cliffs of Le Tréport.\n\nFrom the times before Le Tréport was a summer resort (XIX c.) are the XIV c. Église Saint-Jacques and the XVI c. town hall. Le Tréport was used by Tour de France in 1951 and 1958 both as a finish and start. In 1958 as Eu-Le Tréport-Mers-les-Bains.\n\nÉglise Saint-Jacques, Le Tréport.\n\nEu is sort of the historic side of this commune. In the middle ages it was a border county created in 996 by the duke of Normandy Richard I. Until 1472 it was independent from the French crown. The castle, formerly seat of local counts, was transformed in XIX c. into a royal residence by Louis Philippe I. Queen of England Victoria visited Louis Philippe in the castle twice, which was the 1st time since 1520, when an English monarch met a French king. In 1843 an agreement was signed in the castle between both parties, which was the origin of future Entente. Now the castle is home to a museum dedicated to Louis Philippe I. Other sights include XII c. Collégiale Notre-Dame et Saint-Laurent and XVI-XVII c. Chapelle du collège des Jésuites.\n\nChâteau d'Eu.\n\nHidden in the nearby forest (Bois l'Abbé) are the remains of a Gallo-Roman town of Briga, abandoned during the III c. It was a Roman military camp on the Atlantic coast founded on the site of a former Celtic pagan shrine, where later stood an important Roman basilica. Other excavated structures include a forum, theater and two thermes. The site was rediscovered in late XVIII c. and excavations are performed on the site to this day.\n\nArchaelogical site of Briga near Eu.\n\nEu & Le Tréport are located on the mouth of Bresle, which is the historic border of Normandie and Picarde. This region is called Pays de Talou. The stage goes from there to Pays d'Auge via Pays de Caux and Boucles de la Seine, where the stage crosses Seine near its mouth. Unlike the 2015 stage to Le Havre, this stage goes more inland (20-40km from the coast) only having very limited amount of coastal rides (mainly in the last 20km). The first roughly 120km are in the department of Seine-Maritime and the last 25km are in Calvados with the middle 40km in Eure.\n\nSoon after Eu the race passes near the village of Saint-Martin-le-Gaillard, which is home to an interesting XIX c. story. In 1836 a local priest with his niece and servant were murdered. Four people were accused and then executed on a local hill. A tree was planted for each of them but one of them had not grown, which created a superstition that one of them was innocent. To this day this grim \"monument\" lives on the hill with some sort of a dummy hung on one of the trees (a very... interesting joke).\n\nSaint-Martin-le-Gaillard.\n\nAfter Saint-Martin-le-Gaillard the race passes through what's now just a small village of Envermeu. It was once a quite prominent Roman fortress and even the capital of Pays de Talou during the Merovingian era. Sadly, besides the archaelogical sites around the town there's nothing, that survived from this period.\n\nEnvermeu.\n\nIn Envermeu the first cat. 4 hill of the day starts. It's 2,3km at 4,8% Côte de Saint-Nicolas-d'Aliermont. It's soon followed by 2,6km at 4,4% Côte de Sainte-Foy, which at 151m is also the highest point of the stage. On top of the first climb is the town of Saint-Nicolas-d'Aliermont – once a realtively large centre of watchmaking, which soon developed a certain style known as the Saint-Nicolas clock. In XX c. the local industry switched from watches towards micro-mechanics and computers.\n\nSaint-Nicolas clock.\n\nPays de Bray.\n\nA short, quite dynamic descent ends in Saint-Aubin-le-Cauf in the Béthune valley. The village is very close to the well known La Manche harbor of Dieppe. In Saint-Aubin-le-Cauf the race enters Pays de Caux mainly known for Côte d'Albâtre. However, unlike the 2015 stage 6 i'm not hugging the Atlantic coast. The region is known for a local Cauchois dialect created back, when it was part of the Norman duchy of Normandy. The region is obviously very windy, but it's also quite well protected by tree lines.\n\nPays de Caux.\n\nCliffs of Étretat, Côte d'Albâtre.\n\nOn the other side of Béthune is Arques-la-Bataille. As the name suggests, there was a large battle fought near the village. It was in 1589 against Spain (more exact Spanish Netherlands) during the French Wars of Religion. Interestingly, it was a cannon installed on the Arques' XI c. feudal castle that decided the fate of the battle in favour of the Anglo-French coalition after the Spanish army were stuck in local swamps. The castle is in ruins since at least XVIII c.\n\nChâteau d'Arques-la-Bataille.\n\nOf course because this region of France is a 100-150m high plateau crisscrossed by various Atlantique river valleys there are a number of hills. The last \"big\" hill is 2,6km at 4,4% Côte de Sainte-Foy. Other notable hill is an intermediate sprint in Saint-Laurent-en-Caux. This climb starts in the Saâne valley. It's 3,3km at 2,5% but with the first 1km at roughly 5%. From Saint-Laurent-en-Caux the race goes via Doudenville to Yvelot. Here the roads are a little bit more open so look out for an Atlantic headwind and (starting from Doudenville) sidewind. Worth mentioning is a little village of Ouville-l'Abbaye near Doudenville with its very characteristic to Normandy XVII-XVIII c. half-timbered houses.\n\nXVIII c. Château de Galleville built by Marshal of France Claude-Louis-Hector de Villars, Doudeville.\n\nYvetot is one of the biggest towns of Pays de Caux (12000 pop.). It's relatively new dating back to XVI c. The owners of Yvetot decided to call themselves kings but that ended, when the French king Henry IV took interest in the case. It was mainly a trading and commercial center on the run-in to Le Havre. The town was entirely razed by Germans in 1940 and rebuilt after the war in neo-classical style. The main church of Yvelot (it's very ugly btw) – Église Saint-Pierre – is home to the largest stained glass window in Europe (over 1km^2).\n\nÉglise Saint-Pierre, Yvetot.\n\nFrom Yvetot i'll use i guess the only chance to cross Seine west of Rouen. Other bridges are either part of a highway or in Rouen. This bridge is Pont de Brotonne (part of D490, constructed in 1977). It's named after Forêt de Brotonne – a forest of the Saint-Wandrille abbey. I'll reach it via weirdly named Mont-de-l'If and Fréville to end just outside of Abbaye Saint-Wandrille. Worth noting is a nearby town of Barentin, which is home to replicas of various famous statues and a very high viaduct of the Rouen – Le Havre train line. The area, which is the northern bank of Seine, is quite hilly. These hills are the reason, why Rouen is quite popular within the traceur community.\n\nPont de Brotonne.\n\nReplica of the Statue of Liberty, Barentin.\n\nThe Saint-Wandrille (or Fontenelle) abbey was founded in VII c. by Saint Wandrille on a land given to him by Archbishop of Rouen Saint Ouen. During the middle ages it was one of the biggest and most powerful abbey in western France. Because of it's strategic position near the mouth of Seine the abbey was destroyed everal times during the 100 Years War and French Wars of Religion. The abbey was finally closed down during the French Revolution but in late XIX c. it was resotred (partly thanks to Victor Hugo) and it's operating to this day. The abbey was home to at least 30 saints and XIX c. Dom Joseph Pothier, who reconstituted the Gregorian chant (a type of medieval music partly popularised by a more mainstream version of the sound by Era).\n\nAbbaye Saint-Wandrille.\n\nThe Saint-Wandrille abbey belongs to the town of Caudebec-en-Caux on the other side of the Brotonne bridge. As the name suggests (of old Danish kaldr bekkr – cold stream?) it was founded by Normans. It was burned down by Germans during their retreat of 1944. The town is home to a XV-XVI c. Église Notre-Dame with beautiful stained glass windows. Other sights include a XII-XIII c. Maison des Templiers, XV-XVI c. Château d'Ételan of chamberlain of King Louis XII Louis Picart and a museum of Vicor Hugo.\n\nÉglise Notre-Dame, Caudebec-en-Caux.\n\nMaison des Templiers, Caudebec-en-Caux.\n\nWhen the race crosses Seine it enters \"the real\" Normandy. Yes, Seine-Marittime is part of Haute-Normande but geographically i find Seine as the border of Normandy. Like the name suggests, it was for a quite long time in posession of Vikings (Normans), who founded a duchy in 911. The capital of the duchy was Rouen. The most known person to came from Normandy was William the Conqueror. This county was incorporated to the French crown in 1204.\n\nNormandy.\n\nThe terrain is very similar to Nord-Pas-de-Calais with vast plateaus on top of coastal cliffs, crisscrossed by valleys and. That forced the architecture to be very similar to its northern counterpart with tree lines as wind brakers, hedges (bocage). The architecture also seems to have a Flemmish flavour with either XIX c. red brick style or half-timbered style. The same architectural style does stretch to Bretagne. Pont-Audemer is probably the best example of Normandian architecture. The region specialises in Camembert cheese.\n\nAn example of a field cut by Bocage.\n\nThe general area on the mouth of Seine is known as Boucles de la Seine. It should not be confused by a historic French classic of the same name held between 1945 and 1973 in and near Paris. That race is mainly known for blowing up Bobet who won it in 1947 and \"always 2nd\" Poulidor who of course was 2nd in 1960.\n\nBoucles de la Seine.\n\nAfter this introduction to Normandy the race finally continues alongside the other side of Seine on D65 and then enters a historic, former Roman road to Pont-Audemer. In the meantime the race leaves Seine-Marittime for Eure. Not for long though as soon the race enters Calvados.\n\nPont-Audemer is an old town from at least XI c. over the river Risle and two of its tributaries – Tourville and Véronne. Because of the sheer amount of water and canals the city is known as Norman Venice. The town was supposed to be bombed, but a fog rescued it. Thanks to that the nown now boasts a large number of falf-timbered housing of XVI-XVIII c. Also worth noting are XII-XIII c. Église Saint-Ouen and nearby old riverbed of Seine – Le Marais-Vernier, which is home to what looks like a reconstruction of a medieval Norman village.\n\nÉglise Saint-Ouen, Pont-Audemer.\n\nHalf-timbered architecture of Pont-Audemer.\n\nPont-Audemer a finish in the Tour once. It was stage 4 from Fougères won by Gerrit Solleveld from a 7-man breakaway that beat the peloton by 46s. What's interesting about that breakaway is it included Hennie Kuiper and Luco Herrera. Yes, a (then) former GC/classics speciallist of such caliber and one of the best (if not the best) climbers of his era in a random breakaway on a random flat stage. Another interesting fact is that the main street – Rue de la République is cobbled and it could house a very tricky sprint finish Cassel style. The road is wide and the cobbles are very easy but if you want a sprint on glass (if wet) then you have it.\n\nRue de la République, Pont-Audemer.\n\nLe Marais-Vernier.\n\nFrom Pont-Audemer the race stays close to the Risle heading towards Berville-sur-Mer (home to the longest barn in Normandy at 77m) and Honfleur passing through a number of villages like Toutainville or Conteville in the typical Norman half-timbered architecture. It's a nice ride as the area has fine views over Risle or Seine. While i'm heading straight to Honfleur, there are plenty of hills (Pays d'Auge) and you can really play with them. Potential finishes could be Honfleur, Pont-Audemer or even Beuzeville.\n\nMaison Hameau Pottier, Conteville.\n\nBetween Berville-sur-Mer and Honfleur is the XI c. Grestain Abbey. It was closely related with William the Conqueror as it was founded by his stepfather Herluin de Conteville. The abbey stopped operating during the French Revolution and was left in ruins. It was restored in 1960's.\n\nAbbaye Notre-Dame de Grestain.\n\nHonfleur is a realtively big French harbor at the very end of Seine estuary. From Honfleur starts the Côte Fleurie (Flowery Coast). It's a stretch of coast between Côte de Nacre and Côte d'Albâtre. Honfleur was founded in X c. In the Duchy of Normandy it was a main harbor of Rouen. During the 100 Years War it was transformed to be a fortress, but it didn't prevent it to be occupied by the English on a number of ocasions. After the war Honfleur benefited from the boom of marinism and maritime trade. It was also a harbor of choice for a number of early French explorers like Binot Paulmier, 2nd after Portugal to reach Brasil or Jean Denis who was 3rd after English and Portuguese to land in Newfoundland. In XIX c. town was troubled by the British continental blockade of the Napoleonic era. Later that century it lost its position to Le Havre.\n\nFalaises des Vaches Noires, Côte Fleurie.\n\nHonfleur's harbor.\n\nMain sights are a hilltop XVII c. Chapelle Notre-Dame-de-Grâce built on top of a previous XI c. chapel, wooden XVI c. Église Sainte-Catherine, XVI c. Église Saint-Étienne, two half-timbered XVII c. salt barns and a number of half-timbered and marinistic XVI-XVIII c. houses. Honfleur is also a minor summer resort with Plage du Butin.\n\nÉglise Sainte-Catherine, Honfleurs.\n\nRue de la Bavole, Honfleur.\n\nHonfleur lies adjacent to a protected area of the Seine estuary with a number of shallow gravel banks occupied by a swarm of birds. This stretch of Côte Fleurie is known as Côte de Grâce. As far as i know the town never hosted a Tour de France stage.\n\nPlage du Butin and Estuaire de la Seine.\n\nThe hardest climb of the day – Côte de la Croix-Rouge starts in Honfleur. It's quite an interesting climb as it's partly on cobbles (Rue du Puits). The cobbles aren't hard though. This climb is on quite narrow roads so positioning should be important. It's quite regular but the last 600m are slightly harder, at roughly 10% with max 13%. The top is 18km from the finish line. It should be a very good puncheur climb, but i think the best attempts for a stage win should be reserved for the last climb.\n\nRue du Puits, Honfleur.\n\nFrom the top the race continues on a quite narrow Route de la Croix-Rouge before joining wider roads in the village of Équemauville. The descent (on D62) starts after a 3,4km long plateau and leads back to the coast. It's mostly wide and straight. The next climb starts after a roughly 4km flat.\n\nThe last climb of the day is Côte du Bout du Haut (on Rue Thomas Jean Montsaint). Most of it is quite easy, but there are 450m in the middle, that are at roughly 12% with even a small section of 16%. That short ramp should be a fine place for an attempt at winning the stage and preventing a bunch sprint. I guess the likes of Gilbert, Terpstra, Vanmarcke or even Van Avermaet and Benoot will try to do something and prevent Sagan from winning the stage. I'm not really expecting any GC battle though unless Kwiatkowski is the next Thomas.\n\nRue Thomas Jean Montsaint, Villerville.\n\nAt the top the race goes for the next 500m on Chemin du Bout du Haut before entering wider D62. The descent to Trouville-sur-Mer starts after a 3,2km plateau. The descent on D74 is quite steep (up to 9%) but it's wide and mostly straight with only two 90deg turns in the middle.\n\nLikr the start to this stage, the finish is sponsored by two towns – Deauville and Trouville-sur-Mer. Because of the road layout the finish is in Deauville but i decided to split the sponsorship between those two coastal tourist resorts (Trouville-sur-Mer can handle the podium presentations).\n\nSince XIX c. both former fishing villages (fishing culture here is strong to this day) were known as \"Parisian riviera\" thanks to a large number of Parisian nobilites visiting the place in the summer. That was just before the Mediterranean coast was adapted to hold large scale summer resorts. The region was very popular within painters like Huet, Isabey, Corot or Monet who were transforming local seaside landscapes into paint. Other annual visitors were Marcel Proust, Alexandre Dumas and Gustave Flaubert. Beach horse riding was the most popular activity. The region is quite popular within French nobilities, actors (Gérard Depardieu) and politicians to this day. Deauville is also home to a film festival founded in 1975 and hosted a G8 summit in 2011.\n\nPlage de Trouville.\n\nBeach at Trouville by Monet, 1870.\n\nTrouville was hosting a Tour stage twice in 1948 (ancient times) as a finish to stage 1 from Paris (237km) won in a sprint by Bartali and start of stage 2 to Dinard won by Vincenzo Rossello from a breakaway that included Louison Bobet. That was one of the cases of how Bobet managed to get 20min on Bartali before the latter killed everything and everyone in the Alps. Deauville was used once by the Tour as a finish to 1979's stage 7 won by Leo Van Vliet from a breakaway.\n\nPlage de Deauville.\n\nThe run-in to the finish is quite complicated as the last 1,2km includes 500m with 4 roundabouts, but the last 700m are straight. The roads are wide, even with the aformentioned roundabouts. The finish line is on Avenue de la République near Hippodrome de Deauville la Touques, at the end of a 700m straight. Deauville and Trouville are the main horse breeding region in France and are home to a numbr of equestrian races. Said hippodrome could be potentialy used for the podium presentations.\n\nHippodrome de Deauville la Touques.\n\nI guess Côte du Bout du Haut should be ridden agressively as otherwise it's for the more durable sprinters like Sagan or Degenkolb. I doubt anything will happen on Côte de la Croix-Rouge, but it should quite significantly wear down pure sprinters. As i mentioned, some of Belgian or Danish dudes, who are great on those short but steep hills but are not renown for being (relative to proper sprinters) very quick will most probably try something on the last climb. I hope the last 20km will be interesting to watch and the proximity to the Atlantic coast, weekend and luxurious resorts will gather a bonkers-sized mob of fans. Next stage also won't be a sprinter galore as it'll be sort of Flèche Wallonne in Normandy for the likes of Bala v1.0, Bala v2.0 or the Colombian Pantani.\n\nSorry, there are just too many layers this stage (one of the longest in this race) has behind the racing, while the racing itself has also quite a lot of content to expand on. Also, i've just noticed... there's an error – Côte de Hamars is cat. 3.\n\nLast stage: link\n\nhttps://www.la-flamme-rouge.eu/maps/viewtrack/200450\n\nTour de France 2 – stage 10. Lisieux – Coutances, 189km, hilly.\n\nClimbs:\n\nCôte du Bourg de Saint-Marc – 2,4km, 5,8%, cat. 4, 189m\n\nCôte de Saint-Clair – 5,2km, 4,9% (max 16%), cat. 3, 296m\n\nCôte de Hamars – 3,3km, 5,6% (max 12%), cat. 3, 234m\n\nCôte de Caumont-l'Éventé – 1,3km, 6,8%, cat. 4, 242m\n\nMur de Coutances – 850m, 7,2% (max 16-20%), cat. 4, 93m\n\nNo D-day and no \"Omaha\" in this one. The allied forces in Normandy fought what were basically secondary German forces. Only after the front stalled the German army managed to bring some depth with 7th Army and a number of SS divisions that previously stationed east of Caen.\n\nAfter gaining enough ground in Normandy the front stalled for roughly a month. The allied side was mainy consolidating their positions and building their resources while the German side was sort of doing the same but with some small, unsucessful pinches. Said stability of the front was mainly a result of the natural defensive capabilities the region had via bocages – property borders consisting of hedges and deep ravines with narrow roads inside them. Said bockages were like natural trenches and they were quite hard to cross by anyone.\n\nThe front day before Operation Cobra.\n\nDuring July the US side was clearing the Cotentin peninsula while the British/Canadian side was bleeding out while trying to take control over Caen – at the time a heavily fortified city. For most of July the changes to the front were small, but very important as the allied forces managed to took control of two strategically important cities – Caen and Saint-Lô. The first one was the basis for British/Canadian Operation \"Tractable\" while the latter for American Operation \"Cobra\". Both operations resulted in destroying most of German armies on the west front and an opening to France.\n\nThe front day before Operation Tractable.\n\nThe stage goes counter-chronologicaly to the actions on the Normandy front. The first major operation of August was \"Cobra\" and any other military moves were done after the sucess of a previous one. Operation \"Cobra\" was held mainly in the Saint-Lô area expanding towards Coutances and Villedieu-les-Poêles. Before that the German (and partly American) positions were wrecked by American bomb raids. However the American front wasn't facing that strong of an oposition as the Brits were doing most of the heavy lifting. The target of British/Canadian Operation \"Tractable\" was to move the front towards more open fields of Falaise where they would finally engage in a full blown tank battle.\n\nA very deep bocage near Le Carillon, north of Saint-Lô.\n\nThat was a very simplified introduction to the story behind this stage. Now to the stage itself. It's kinda similar to AGR before the finish was moved away from Cauberg. On the profile it doesn't look like that but the last 20km are very hilly, quite narrow and twisty. Outside of the WW2 content the stage also features a fair bit of Suisse Normande – the rockiest region of Normandy. The entire stage is in the Basse-Normandie administrative region and includes every department of the region – Calvados interrupted by Orne finishing in Manche.\n\nThe stage starts in Lisieux – the biggest town that's nearest to last stage's finish of Deauville-Trouville. Lisieux is the historic capital of Pays d'Auge since the Gauls (Lexovii). In the middle ages Lisieux was one of two (out of seven) main bishoprics (with Coutances) of Normandy. Pierre Cauchon, who judged Joan d'Arc, was later the bishop of Lisieux. The king of England Henry II married Eleanor of Aquitaine in Lisieux's cathedral in 1152. Because of native to the town Saint Thérèse, Lisieux is now the 2nd most popular French pilgrimage site. While it was just east of the WW2 fights it was heavily bombed ,which resulted in a death of 800 people and a destruction of roughly 2/3 of the city.\n\nXX c. Basilique Sainte-Thérèse overshadowing Lisieux.\n\nMain sights are the Basilique Sainte-Thérèse of 1920's, nearby XVI-XVII c. Château de Saint-Germain-de-Livet – former home of lords of Livet, XII c. Cathédrale Saint-Pierre – one of the oldest Gothic structures in Normandy and the city's hospital garden – archaelogical site of the Gallic town. Lisieux was hosting the Tour stages a couple of times. Last time as an uphill finish (in front of the basilica) of 2011 stage 6 won by Boasson Hagen.\n\nCathédrale Saint-Pierre, Lisieux.\n\nChâteau de Saint-Germain-de-Livet.\n\nThe first 25km take place in the Vie valley – one of the main valleys of Pays d'Auge known for Livarot, Vimoutiers and local cheese like Livarot or Camembert. The entire valley was heavily shelled by bomb raids and artilery fire during the Operation \"Tractable\". One such raid injured (fractured skull) Erwin Rommel between Sainte-Foy-de-Montgommery and Vimoutiers by two Spitfires. I think it was on the main valley road (D579) on which the stage goes on. Interestingly, Sainte-Foy-de-Montgommery was a medieval well of a local Montgommery famil, but i don't think they had anything to do with Bernard Montgomery. Livarot was once hosting a Tour stage as a start to 2015's stage 7 to Fougères won by Cavendish.\n\nLivarot.\n\nVimoutiers is the biggest settlement in the valley. It was a deathplace of a Bretagne duke Alain III, when in 1040 he was probably poisoned while fightning a local rebellion. In XVIII c. possibly in the town Jacques and Marie Harel created the recipe for Camembert cheese. The village of Camembert is hidden in the hills halfway between Vimoutiers and Mont-Ormel. Vimoutiers is also home to one of only 7 still remaining Tiger tanks, which was left in a roadside ditch, probably because it ran out of fuel after buzzing away from the Falaise pocket.\n\nCamembert.\n\nTiger tank in Vimoutiers.\n\nMont-Ormel was the climax of Operation \"Tractable\", which itself was a prolongation of Operation \"Totalize\". Both operations took place between 7.08 and 21.08 after the British side of the front was eased up as a result of Operation \"Lüttich\" – an unsuccessfull, tank-based counterattack near Mortain to close the Avranches gap that resulted from Operation \"Cobra\". The closure of the Falaise Pocket was done right at Mont-Ormel between 18.08 and 22.08.\n\nFalaise pocket.\n\nThe original objective of Operation \"Totalize\" was to open up the front towards open fields south of Falaise to give tanks and bombers some breathing space. However, with rather slow progress of Canadian 2nd Corps (failure to quickly capture Falaise) and very quick movement of American forces south of Normandy (result of the Avranches gap) it soon was about encircling the 5th and 7th Army. While the encirclement was only partly successfull it did managed to entirely drive off the German forces from France to the Siegfried line on Rhin. The Falaise battle is considered to be the last battle of Normandy.\n\nThe biggest battles were fought by Canadians of the 2nd Corps and Poles of the 1st Armoured Division between 19-21.08 near Chambois and overlooking it Mont-Ormel right in the middle of the gap between Falaise – Argentan and later Trun – Chambois. Probably there would be less people dead if not Omar Bradley's decision to move out the American 3rd Army away from Argentan. The main hit was took by parts of the Polish division, which managed to sneak to the top of Mont-Ormel right in the middle of the evacuation gap, being constantly barraged by more and more panicking German forces for next two days. The gap was finally closed on 21.08 by the American 90th Infantry Division and parts of the Polish 1st Armoured Division. The general casualties of the battle were heavy – circa 60000 Germans (10000 dead) and more than 10000 Canadians and Poles.\n\nA commemorative monument on top of Mont-Ormel with M4 Sherman tank at the front.\n\nFrom the north side Mont-Ormel is not categorised. However, the descent to Chambois could be a cat. 4. Chambois is a small town on the Falaise-Argentan plain. Interestingly, it managed to survive the battle of Falaise realtively well hence XII c. Église Saint-Martin and a typical XII c. Normanesque square castle with a large dungeon are well preserved.\n\nChambois' castle with a Falaise pocket memorial.\n\nFrom Chambois the race goes right across the Falaise – Argentan corridor via Trun and Saint-Lambert-sur-Dive – a village right in the middle of the heavy fights of the parts of 4th Canadian Armoured Division over the control of Chambois. The main fights were on what's now D710 leading from the village to Coudehard (just west of Mont-Ormel) and over a small bridge over the Dives river just west of the village. Said road is also known as the Corridor of Death, mainly as a result of the combined shelling from the 4th Canadian Armoured Division and Polish artillery from the top of Mont-Ormel. The village is now home to a monument commemorating the 4th Canadian Armoured Division. After the battle the commander of the division – Major David Currie was the only Canadian to be awarded with Victoria Cross – the highest award of the British honours system.\n\nBelvédère des Canadiens, Saint-Lambert-sur-Dive.\n\nJust to change the mood a little bit, here's a Neolithic menhir in Fontaine-les-Bassets between Trun and Falaise.\n\nJust after Trun the race comes back to Calvados just ouside of Falaise. Falaise was founded in IX c. It's home to a X c. castle – later seat of the viscounts of Hiémois. William the Conqueror was born in the castle. There's a legend that William's father was interested in his mother Herleva after she accidentally torn her dress up while washing animal skins in a local river (Ante?). In 1174 a treaty was assigned in the city, where king of Scotland William the Lion was forced to recognize himself as the vassal to king of England Henry Plantagenet after he was imprisoned. The city was heavily destroyed on 07.07 by an Allied bombing. The city was freed on 16.08 after heavy fights between the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division and 12th Armoured Division SS.\n\nFalaise.\n\nMain sights are the aformentioned castle, XI c. Église Saint-Gervais-Saint-Protais, XI c. Église Saint-Laurent, XI-XII c. Église Notre-Dame de Guibray and a museum and memorial dedicated to the battle of Falaise. Nobilities linked with Falaise include Willian the Conqueror, French poet Nicolas Vauquelin Des Yveteaux and painter André Lemaître. AFAIK the town never hosted a Tour de France stage.\n\nChâteau de Falaise.\n\nÉglise Saint-Gervais-Saint-Protais, Falaise.\n\nFrom Falaise i'm running away from the WW2 battlegrounds towards Suisse Normande via D511. Said Suisse Normandie starts when reaching Pont-d'Ouilly. On this stage it will mainly consist of weaving in and out of deep and twisty Orne valley. The general area is also known as Collines de Normandie. After crossing the Orne for the first time the first categorised climb of the day starts – cat. 4 Côte du Bourg de Saint-Marc. It's 2,4km at fairly regular 5,8%.\n\nVallée de l'Orne near Clécy.\n\nAfter a short time on a plateau the race descends back to the Orne valley via D562 Laval – Caen road. Said descent leads to Clécy right in the middle of Suisse Normandie. Because of the sheer drops on the sides of Orne, especially nearby Roche d'Oëtre (it reaches heights of 100m), the area is popular with paragliding and rock climbing.\n\nRoche d'Oëtre.\n\nClécy, while being just a small village, seems to be very popular among fellow pundits. More popular then nearby Flers, Vire or even smaller Condé-sur-Noireau. Because of its location it's very popular with painters like André Hardy, Georges Moteley or Paul-Émile Pissarro.\n\nClécy.\n\nOn the other side of Orne the first cat. 3 of the day awaits. What i've called Côte de Saint-Clair is the highest and hardest climb of the day and one of the hardest in the area. Reaching almost 300m this climb is 5,2km at 4,9%. However, there are middle 800m at 11%, reaching max gradients of roughly 16%. The road is also quite narrow. Because from the top there are still 110km left it will be mainly for the breakaway. However, because of narrowness and twistiness the peloton should be careful and not look at each other (Clásica San Sebastian).\n\nCôte de Saint-Clair.\n\nSadly, the climb is mostly covered with dense foliege, but the choppers should provide a nice view over local outcrops like Rochers des Parcs or Rochers de la Houle (both protected Natura 2000 sites and popular rock climbing spots). At the top of the climb is a small XIII c. Chapelle Saint-Clair. A long and wide descent will lead back to the Orne valley for the last time, this time in Thury-Harcourt.\n\nRochers des Parcs with a train viaduct over Orne below.\n\nRochers de la Houle.\n\nThury-Harcourt is the northenrmost village of the Suisse Normandie. In the village i'm crossing Orne three times in span of 1km. It includes literally cutting deep through Boucle du Hom (a river bend on Orne).\n\nBoucle du Hom, Thury-Harcourt.\n\nD212 cutting across Boucle du Hom.\n\nThury-Harcourt is home to originally a XVII c palace, which was entirely destroyed during a number of allied bombardments and what was left was burned down by fleeing German troops. The battles for Thury-Harcourt were quite fierce as it was turned by Germans into a stronghold on their defense line over Orne.\n\nSaid battle was part of British Operation \"Bluecoat\" (30.07 – 07.08) done right after the successes of \"Cobra\" on their western flank. The operation's objective was to prevent the German reinforcements from Caen and Pas-de-Calais to join with the groups that fought agaist the Americans further west. The main objectives were Vire and nearby Mont Pinçon – one of the highest peaks of the Suisse Normandie (362m). While local battles were fierce and the first days showed no progress because of bocages, lack of roads and very dense minefields, overally there wasn't that much of an opposition because the main defender of this front – 2nd Armoured Division was withdrawn to Mortain for Operation \"Lüttich\".\n\nChâteau d'Harcourt.\n\nIt were Operation \"Lüttich\" and Operation \"Bluecoat\" that caused a large movement of the German army from the suburbs of Caen and the general area of Pas-de-Calais towards the middle of Normandy, which then left them vulnerable in the Falaise area.\n\nMap of Operation \"Bluecoat\".\n\nAfter crossing the Orne is time for the last cat. 3 climb (cat. 4 on the profile) – Côte de Hamars, which starts after a short flat in the Ruisseau valley. It's 3,3km at 5,6% with first 1,8km at 7% (max roughly 12%). The road is quite narrow and very open, so while it provide quality views it can also be windy. The top is 90km from the finish. From the top the race goes on quite narrowish and open plateau roads over the Ruisseau valley to Aunay-sur-Odon (Les Monts d'Aunay). Interestingly, i found this area much more fitting to the name of Suisse Normandie than the Orne valley as it does look like hilly Suisse lowlands between Jura and the Alps.\n\nViews from the top of Côte de Hamars.\n\nOn the other side of the Ruisseau valley is Mont Pinçon. During the WW2 it was a German radio station, which was then a focal point of Operation \"Bluecoat\". The fights for the summit took 43rd British Infantry Division 3 attempts, fightning off against 276 and 326 German Infantry Divisions over 3 days between 05.08 – 08.08.\n\nRadio station of Mont Pinçon.\n\nA commemoration table of British Royal Hussars (cavalry regiment) on top of Mont Pinçon.\n\nNot far from Mont Pinçon is a small river La Souleuvre (tributary of Vire). A small, somehow unprotected bridge over the river helped the British 11th Armoured Division to exploit a gap in between German groups, which resulted in breaking the front. Said bridge is known as Pont du Taureau (named after an emblem of said division – a black bull). It's on D56 halfway between Campeaux and Le Bény-Bocage.\n\nPont du Taureau, Le Bény-Bocage.\n\nAunay-sur-Odon is a town at the very edge of Suisse Normandie. Of course that doesn't mean there won't be any climbing left. Actually, there's hardly any flat left. The town's strategic location brought its doom during the WW2, being destroyed by two bombing raids. The town was also one of the last to be liberated (05.08) during the Operation \"Bluecoat\" only after being deserted by Germans moving towards Mortain.\n\nAunay-sur-Odon.\n\nFrom Aunay-sur-Odon the race moves south of Villers-Bocage towards Cahagnes and Caumont-l'Éventé, basically alongside the front of Operation \"Bluecoat\". The main starting point of this operation was the hilltop town of Caumont-l'Éventé (the Caumont gap). The climb to the town is cat. 4, 1,3km at quite steep 6,8%. This exact climb to the town was the only passable track for the tanks during the Operation \"Bluecoat\". The town is home to medieval salt mines (now a museum).\n\nCaumont-l'Éventé.\n\nThe Caumont Gap was created during an Operation \"Perch\" (main objective – liberating Caen) preceeding \"Bluecoat\" after the main division covering the German side – 352nd Infantry Division was retired to Saint-Lô in 10.07 and the replacement – 2nd Armoured Division was stuck behind. That created a 3-day, mostly undefended gap. Capturing Caumont-l'Éventé was tied with nearby battle of Tilly-sur-Seulles to keep nearby Panzer-Lehr Division in place. From Caumont-l'Éventé the race goes straight to Saint-Lô, this time alongside the front day before Operation \"Cobra\". In the meanwhile the race leaves Calvados for the department of Manche.\n\nWhile Operation \"Cobra\" is one of the most important of operations on the western front it wasn't anything fancy or subtle. It seems the American style of play was to bomb everything in front of within their positions and then collect whatever's left of the opposition. Thankfully for them, the opposition against their position was on the verge of collapsing. The main division on this side of the front – \"Panzer Lehr\" was in constant battles practically since the D-day and was lacking supplies.\n\nOperation Cobra near Saint-Lô.\n\nThe entire Operation \"Cobra\" wouldn't be possible without capturing Saint-Lô between 15-19.07. The operation started in 24.07 a week after capturing Saint-Lô with two days of heavy bombardment of an area between Marigny and Saint-Gilles, just west of Saint-Lô. There were major comminucation problems that resulted in a death of 136 American soldiers by their bomb raids. However, during said raids the \"Panzer Lehr\" division was basically razed off from existence. The entire German defence was broken within next two days.\n\nThe operation soon ended in an encirclement of a number of German divisions around Coutances. Said groups tried to run away from impending doom via the Soulles river. However, the troops were stuck because of lack of supplies, lack of roads and a quite deep valley of Soulles. They were basically a standing targed for bombers. The last 20km will take place in the Soulles valley weaving in an out of it on sometimes narrow-ish roads.\n\nSaint-Lô.\n\nSaint-Lô is an important road junction right in the middle of Normandy. Because of that it was already an important Gallic town. At that time it was known as Briovère. In the middle ages it was a goldsmith center and was minting royal coins. It developed to the point of being the 3rd largest city of Duchy of Normandy after Rouen and Caen. After WW2 the town was nown as \"Capital of the Ruins\". In 1948 it was decorated with the Legion of Honour. The only buildings that at least partly survived WW2 are XIII c. Église Notre-Dame, XIII c. Église Sainte-Croix built on top of a possible V c. chappel and some remains of medieval city walls with a XVI c. citadel.\n\nÉglise Notre-Dame.\n\nCity walls of Saint-Lô.\n\nSaint-Lô only once hosted a Tour stage. It was a start to 2016's stage 2 to Cherbourg won in an uphill sprint by Peter Sagan. Saint-Lô is a pretty good place for a finish (Rue du Maréchal Juin or Avenue de Paris?). On the other side of the La Piérie river are some tasty hills. You may have a lot of fun with local roads. Especially check out the combination of Rue Belle Croix – Rue Porte au Four – Rue Saint-Georges (~1,2km at ~7%), Rue de la Roquette or Rue des Acres. I don't use any of these hills as i'm heading southwest, but i do have an intermediate sprint on Avenue de Paris.\n\nFrom Saint-Lô the race goes sort of alongside Operation \"Cobra\" towards Coutances. Because of the length of this post (and you know the basics) from now on i won't be focusing on WW2. At first the race goes alongside the Joigne valley through Canisy, Quibou and Dangy. From there i could go straight towards Cerisy-la-Salle but i've decided to first go towards Notre-Dame-de-Cenilly cutting across the Soulles valley and then go back to Cerisy-la-Salle via D29. I've done this so i can include a nice, punchy climb.\n\nXVII c. Château de Cerisy-la-Salle.\n\nThe aformentioned climb is to Montpinchon on top of an adjacent to Cerisy-la-Salle hill, separated by a very deep ravine. The climb is 1,9km at 4,2% (includes 400m of descending), just outside of categorisation. It's the first minor hill of 5 inside the last 20km. While twisty, the road to Montpinchon is wide and nice. From there the road descends down and after crossing river Soulles is followed by an 800m at roughly 6,5% hill to La Forgé Bisson and then a small plateau to Ouville, 10km from the finish.\n\nProfile of the last 20km before Coutances.\n\nFrom Ouville the race descends down on a this time smaller roads towards Belval (another hilltop village) crossing the Soulles for the n-th time. It's followed by another hill (on D99), this time to the village of Courcy. It's 600m at 7% with the middle 100m at roughly 14%. A quite narrow but straight and not too steep descent leads to the Soulles before once again climbing towards La Galaisière, just outside of Coutances. The climb to La Galaisière is 1,3km at 4,2%, but it includes the last 350m at roughly 7-8% with a passage through a narrow tunnel under rail tracks. After a short time on a plateau the race will go down to Coutances on a nice and wide road.\n\nRoad near Courcy.\n\nIt's a pretty tight squeeze just outside of Coutances.\n\nI'e decided to do the last 20km technically demanding. It would be a crash generator but i assume the time gaps in GC should be large, so probably some of the favourites will prefer to not push too hard, but then they may be cought behind if there's a crash or a split on some of the narrow roads. These last 20km should be very hectic as the last wall towards the center of Coutances is also narrow, so positioning will be the key for a stage win and maybe to gain a couple of seconds in GC. I think you can tell this stage was created with a much less mountainous 1st week in mind but i decided to keep it like that as i thought it's interesting enough even with the first mountain block behind.\n\nLike Lisieux at the start, Coutances is a medieval bishopry. Before that it was known as Constantia and was the capital of a Gallic tribe Unelli. Coutances was also a strategic crossroad in Normandy. Because of said location it was besieged and destroyed a number of times throughout the history like by Vikings in 866 or Huguenots in 1562. The town was bombed down as a prep for Operation \"Cobra\", which was one of its main objectives. The town was taken without fierce fights, as the German army was fleeing from a possible encirclement. The main fights took place just east of the town in the Soulles valley.\n\nCoutances.\n\nThis hilltop town is overshadowed by the XIII c. cathedral based off of a previous romanesque church, that was damaged by a fire. Historically Coutances was one of the main Normandic bishopries. It's architecture is a blend of French flamboyant gothic and Norman ascetic romanesque style seen mainly in Sicily and south Italy. There are a number of saints (former bishops) tied with the city of which the most known seems to be VI c. bishop of Coutances Saint Laud (Saint-Lô), who gave name to the city of Saint-Lô.\n\nCathédrale Notre-Dame de Coutances.\n\nOther sights include the remains of a XIII c. aqueduct, which originally was bringing water to the city over the Bruisard valley and a XI c. bishop's park over the Prépont river. Interestingly, it doen't look like the city ever hosted a Tour stage, but was featured plenty of times. Last time during the 2016 Saint-Lô – Cherbourg stage.\n\nRemains of aqueduct of Coutances.\n\nThe finish in Coutances is very Giro-esque. It starts when peloton will cross the Soulle on D7 for the last time and then join D971. The climb to the finish starts after 700m on Rue Geoffroy de Montbray, 600m from the finish. The overall percentage is not too horryfying – only 8%, but when the peloton enters the old town the gradient kicks up a notch. The road is narrow, there's no sidewalk and there's a cobbled irrigation stream right in the middle of the road. It's a very similar ascent to that of Briançon inside the citadele (but the cobbles). Judging by the slanted doors and windows there may be some tiny sections with 15-20%.\n\nMurito in Coutances.\n\nAs you can see, there's not much space for the cars so it should be only for neautral motos with spare wheels and... there's also no space for fans. Positioning is really the key here unless you want to end up in the cobbled canalization. There's a potential alternative with parallel and even more narrower Rue du Puits Notre Dame (it does have a sidewalk for the fans though). The climb lets off after reaching Place Saint-Pierre, where Église Saint-Pierre stands. From here there's still 230m left. The finish line is on Place du Parvis Notre-Dame in front of Cathédrale Notre-Dame – the highest point of Coutances.\n\nFinish in Coutances.\n\nI hope the last 20km and the finish will provide you lots of entertainment with riders dying left and right and the rest of the stage will provide a lot of WW2 stories by mr. Kirby to not lull you to sleep. Originally it was tied with a flat stage in Anjou that started in Avranches and included Mortain to finish off the WW2 themed voyage, but now it's followed by a rest day, during which the race will move to Rousillon.\n\nI thought it'll be a quick breeze with some Vauban-style citadels, but i've ended up chasing the hilltop origins of local towns and refuge/concentration camps of the Spanish Civil War and WW2.\n\nPrevious stage: link\n\nhttps://www.la-flamme-rouge.eu/maps/viewtrack/203965\n\nTour de France stage 12.

Roussillon is also the historic gateway to Spain. Historically it belonged to Aragon and was incorporated into France as a result of the Treaty of Pyrenees (1659). Said treaty ended the French-Spanish side of the Thirty Years War and shaped the modern border. Because of its strategic location it's home to plenty of citadels and other military structures.\n\nCôte Vermeille.\n\nOriginally i though of starting the stage right on Côte Vermeille (probably Banyuls-sur-Mer) but i finally decided for Salses-le-Château just north of Perpignan (Perpinyà) – capital of Roussillon, and then feature as many seaside resorts of Côte Vermeille as i can. The first 80km to Ille-sur-Têt are here to bypass Perpignan, which i decided to not visit because i feel it's a bit too big for a non-weekend stage (ekhm... Gent). Because the road system of Roussillon sucks i had a really hard time doing it and not ending on a narrow dead end. Because of its strong ties with Catalonia i decided to include both French and Catalonian names for the municipalities.\n\nLe Castillet / Castellet, one of the remaining gates of Perpignan's city walls.\n\nThe stage starts in Salses-le-Château (or just Salses). It's a small town (3500 pop.) between Perpignan and Narbonne, near the A9 highway. It started as a medieval Catalan fortress right on the French-Catalan border. After the fortress was destroyed by French in 1496 the Arangonese king Ferdinand II commisioned a much biger fortress. Apparently it costed roughly 20% of Spanish budged at the time. The money put into this project changed nothing as it was captured by French during the Thirty Years War. After the borders moved further south the fort lost it's strategic location.\n\nFortress of Salses.\n\nFrom Salses i'm taking a very large and flat detour around Perpignan, alongside the Côte Vermeille via a number of seaside resorts. Because Roussillon is the historic gateway to Spain it saw a quite extensive road network in the Roman Empire. In nearby Saint-Hippolyte (Sant Hipòlit de la Salanca) a Roman roadside milestone managed to survive to this day. That's really nice to see. I really like such random things to be preserved. Nearby Saint-Laurent-de-la-Salanque (Sant Llorenç de la Salanca) is the birthplace of Éloi Pino, a XIX c. French navy officer who founded the eponymous capital of Djibouti.\n\nA Roman milestone of Saint-Hippolyte.\n\nSaint-Laurent-de-la-Salanque.\n\nFrom Saint-Laurent-de-la-Salanque the race goes via straight and wide open D81 to Canet-en-Roussillon (or Canet Plagé). I need to mention Pyrenees can generate some wind. The D81 road is very open and close to the seaside. There may be an isolated case of echelons and if a team is not careful enough they may lose some valuable energy before the mountains (via crashes or just straight up high tempo). I expect the first flat 100km to be very slow (unless there's a favourable wind) as it'll be probably hot & sunny so the stage should be won by a breakaway.\n\nD81 between Saint-Laurent-de-la-Salanque and Canet-en-Roussillon.\n\nCanet-en-Roussillon (Canet de Rosselló) or Canet Plagé is a major seaside resort. It was a finish to stage 14 of 1968 Tour de France from Seu d'Urgel via Col d'Ares. It was won by the Dutch quarter-Merckx Jan Janssen, who later won the whole Tour. The 1968 Tour was possibly the least mountainous Tour since at least the 50's. The design resembled more that of Moser vs Saronni Giri of the 70's-80's.\n\nJan Janssen.\n\nRecently the Tour doesn't show too much interest in Pyrénées-Orientales besides Perpignan once every 10 years. I think the department struggles with lack of money though but Libertine probably has more info on that. In the 60's to early 80's Pyrénées-Orientales was one of Tour's staples and a finish at Font-Romeu or Bolquère was a given. Even lesser towns like Port-Barcarès, Thuir or Bourg-Madame managed at the time to have a Tour feature.\n\nChâteau de Canet-en-Roussillon.\n\nCanet started as a Roman harbor to Ruscino – modern Perpignan. In the middle ages it was a lordship and later even a county with a feudal castle (stands to this day) and quite extensive city walls (almost entirely dismantled in XIX c.) thanks to its frontier position near France. Since XIX c. the town developed as a seaside resort. Main sights are the XI c. feudal castle with the remains of Chapelle Saint-Martin-du-Château, XIV c. Église Saint-Jacques and a number of XIX-XX c. seaside palaces.\n\nPromenade de la Côté Vermeille, Canet-en-Roussillon.\n\nNext 3,5km to Saint-Cyprien Plagé are on another wide and open stretch of D81 on an isthmus between Étang de Canet-Saint-Nazaire and the Mediterranean Sea. It can also be potentialy subject to minor echelons.\n\nSaint-Cyprien Plagé (Sant Cebrià de Rosselló) is a summer resort developed in the 60's. It's part of the city of Saint-Cyprien. It's not a particulary interesting town, but it was home to a borderline refuge/concentration camps. I know there are a number of those in Rousillon, like the one in Rivesaltes or Argelès-sur-Mer (next in line). They were established during the Spanish Civil War to house Spanish refugees. During the WW2 they were used by Nazis as full on concentration camps.\n\nSaint-Cyprien Plagé.\n\nXI c. Église Saint-Étienne de Vilarasa, Saint-Cyprien.\n\nFrom Saint-Cyprien Plagé the race goes through another coastal voyage on D81 to Argelès Plagé, seaside part of Argelès-sur-Mer. The oldest part of the city is Taxo d'Avall, which was home to a local medieval lordship of XI-XII c. – home to a XI c. Église Saint-Martin-et-Sainte-Croix and a XI c. tower – once part of a feudal castle. While Argelès-sur-Mer is a relatively new town dating back to XVIII c. there's a number of older structures in near proximity like XII c. Château de Pujols, XIV c. Église Notre-Dame del Prat, X c. Église Saint-Ferréol de la Pava and X c. Chapelle Saint-Jérôme d'Argelès. Argelès-sur-Mer was a finish to stage 11 of TdF 1973 won by Barry Hoban.\n\nBeach in Argelès-sur-Mer.\n\nÉglise Saint-Ferréol de la Pava, Argelès-sur-Mer.\n\nFrom Argelès-sur-Mer the race goes to Elne via D914, alongside Massif des Albères (Serra de l'Albera) – the modern French-Spanish border and the easternmost part of the Pyrenees. Albères is home to plenty of obscure medieval towers and rural chapels like Château d'Ultrera or Tour de Massane while the towns of Côte Vermeille were former Vauban forts created after the border moved.\n\nMassif des Albères with Tour Madeloc in the background.\n\nThe region could be potentialy used for stage design if you don't care about the safety restrictions. There are the three sides of Tour Madeloc of which the Paulilles side is on dirt. There's borderline cat. 1 Col de la Brousse/Coll de la Brossa with a very bonkers false-descent to Maureillas-las-Illas, just west of Perthus. Perthus itself could be a potential HTF near Fort de Bellegarde – one of the Vauban citadelles of the region. Also in Perthus is a narrow circuit around the village of L'Albère that could spice up a potential finish.\n\nProfile of Col de la Brousse.\n\nElne (Elna) is the former Roman capital of Roussillon. At that time it was known as Illiberis. It lied on the main road to Iberia (Spain). During his lengthy Roman campaign Hannibal was camping here with his army. In early middle ages it was one of the 7 cities to create Septimania (centered around Nîmes and Narbonne). After the Moors invasion of 719 the capital was moved to Perpignan. The town suffered heavily during French-Arangonese War of 1285 caused by Pope Martin IV. Its cathedral was burned down as local peope were massacred by the French army.\n\nCathédrale Sainte-Eulalie-et-Sainte-Julie, Elne.\n\nMain sights are XII c. former Cathédrale Sainte-Eulalie-et-Sainte-Julie with a XII c. cloister, rebiult after the previously mentioned war, rural X c. Église Sainte-Eugénie de Tresmals and remains of the city walls with three gates – Balagué, Collioure and Perpignan. Elne was home to a XIX-XX c. French sculptor Aristide Maillol and painter Etienne Terrus. Sadly, because of its historic nature the roads in Elne are narrow. Elne itself is located on a set of small hills he"
