Although I did not yet know it at the time, the rigorous research that Juan Heinink and Robert Dickson put into their filmography of Hollywood’s Spanish-language film production made it possible for me to pursue the project that became this book. Although Cita is now out of print and hard to find (as is a companion volume, Los que fueron a Hollywood), Juan and Bob have continued to work on updating and making its information available through other sources, including the American Film Institute’s Catalog of Motion Pictures and the online offerings of Spain’s Instituto Cervantes. Bob Dickson is also an extraordinarily generous scholar and friend who assisted me in countless ways as I worked on this project. The research for this book took me across and outside of the country and would not have been possible without substantial institutional support. At La Salle University, I thank the Office of the Provost for summer research funding. I also thank the Department of History and Information Technology. In 2008, I was fortunate to be selected as a member of a National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) Summer Seminar held at the Library of Congress. At Colgate University, the Office of the Dean helped fund research travel. In 2006, I was invited to participate in a week-long conference celebrating seventy-five years of sound cinema in Mexico. I thank José Romay, Iván Trujillo, and Magdalena Acosta. At Syracuse University, I was able to devote time to research and writing with fellowships from the Graduate School, Dean’s Office, and Department of History. I received travel support from the Roscoe Martin Fund, administered by the Maxwell School. Also at Syracuse, the Moynihan Institute of Global Affairs, the Program on Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Goekjian Summer Research Grant program funded my archival research in Mexico, Los Angeles, Madison, and New York. I am especially grateful for the opportunity I had to hone my findings at the Goekjian Scholar seminars during 2003 and 2004. I performed the initial phases of research in Madrid with funding from the Program for Cultural Cooperation between Spain’s Ministry of Education, Culture, and Sports and U.S. Universities.\n\nix\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nx\n\nI greatly enjoyed the time I was able to spend in the archives. At each, I found knowledgeable and interested archivists and staff. All deserve my thanks. In Spain, the staff of the Hemeroteca Municipal in Madrid and of the Filmoteca Española made the time I spent there as productive as possible. At the Filmoteca, Javier Herrera Navarro, Margarita Lobo, and Trinidad del Rio were especially helpful. In Mexico, I likewise benefited from the professionalism of the staff of the Filmoteca de la UNAM and the Cineteca Nacional. In Los Angeles, I was able to make use of the exceptional holdings at the Margaret Herrick Library at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, at the Arts Library of the University of California at Los Angeles, and at the Cinema-TV Library and Warner Brothers Archive at the University of Southern California. I was able to see many of the extant Hollywood Spanish-language films at UCLA’s Film and Television Archive and at the Academy’s Pickford Center for Motion Picture Study in Los Angeles. Special thanks to Barbara Hall, Jenny Romero, Ned Comstock, Mark Quigley, and Lauren Buisson for going out of their way to be helpful. I also thank the staffs of the Billy Rose Theatre Collection at the New York Public Library, the Motion Picture, Broadcasting, and Recorded Sound Division of the Library of Congress, and the Wisconsin Center for Film and Theater Research, as well as the librarians at Syracuse University’s E. S. Bird Library, Case Library at Colgate University, and Connelly Library at La Salle University. Numerous mentors and colleagues contributed to the development of this book. Elisabeth Lasch-Quinn was unfailingly kind yet always rigorous. I owe special thanks to Karin Rosemblatt, who pushed me to reach further and think harder at every stage. I had especially looked forward to sending a copy of this book to Robert Sklar of New York University, who gave generously of his time during the research and writing of this project. I was deeply saddened to learn of his unexpected death shortly after I completed the manuscript. At Syracuse, Andrew Cohen, Gail Bulman, and Michael Ebner gave invaluable assistance. I would also like to thank Margaret Hermann and David Richardson, who ran the Goekjian seminars. I am also grateful that Bob Sklar put me in touch with Nick Deocampo, a scholar who shared his innovative work on the history of Spanish influences on the cinema of the Philippines. In Mexico, I was pleased to finally meet Francisco Peredo Castro in person and to discuss our shared interests in transnational cinema. My work also benefited from discussions with colleagues at the NEH Summer Seminar under the direction of Carl Guarneri and John Gillis. Like all scholars, I relied on the work of many others for both insights and information. All errors of fact or interpretation that remain are my own.

The powerful hold that Hollywood exercised on what was arguably the twentieth century’s most significant culture industry provoked admiration, fear, and envy in other countries. Yet only rarely do we think of the ways in which Hollywood has had to make accommodation to the vast international audiences from which it now derives the majority of its profits.1 This book is about a key moment in the history of the world cinema when the addition of synchronized sound, and with it spoken dialogue, provoked a crisis. Dialogue meant language and language specificity meant an end to the easy international circulation of silent films.2 When Hollywood studios, and film industries the world over, first began to produce sound films, no obvious solution to the problem of how to translate spoken dialogue for speakers of other languages existed. First and foremost, this need to make “talkies” comprehensible meant reconceptualizing film markets as language markets in ways that challenged national or regional groupings.3 The case of Spanish-speaking audiences, after English the largest language market for films during the period of the transition to sound, demonstrates the ways in which this transformed Hollywood, created new competitors, and fundamentally changed world film culture. This study asks: What strategies did Hollywood studios employ to deal with cultural and linguistic difference following the transition to sound? What kinds of opportunities did these strategies create for outsiders to gain access and training in Hollywood and for audience preferences to shape the new language market? More broadly, how does this history help us to understand the relationship between cultural identities and globalized media industries? It is necessary to start with the question of strategy because Hollywood led the way in converting the international film industry to sound. The conversion to sound was based on technological innovations but was adopted by the industry 1\n\n2\n\nTHE RISE OF SPANISH-LANGUAGE FILMMAKING\n\nFIGURE 1 Argentine actress Berta Singerman with her daughter Myriam during the filming of Nada más que una mujer (Fox Films, 1934).

Domestically, Warner Brothers had first gambled on sound in 1926 as a way to get ahead of its competitors. Its successes led other studios to follow in a race to rewire theaters and reequip production studios, a conversion process mostly completed by 1929. This competition soon spilled into Europe as American companies battled with German firms, the most technologically\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nadvanced film industry in the world outside of the United States, over the patents for sound reproduction equipment and the rights to wire movie theaters throughout the world. Once this trade war came to a negotiated end in 1930, the real question became whether international audiences would respond favorably to Hollywood films made in English. For the most part, film historians have judged the transition to sound a thorough success for Hollywood and rejected the notion that the addition of synchronized sound represented a significant rupture either economically or stylistically.4 The language question, after all, plagued European film producers as much or more than it did the Americans. The “Film Europe” movement that in the 1920s had attempted to foment a common market for pan-European films foundered once sound made the linguistic diversity of Europe an obstacle for coproduction.5 Recent scholarship has demonstrated that such linguistic crises pushed some European producers to develop distinctive uses of sound recording that allowed them to take advantage of niche markets that Hollywood production could not satisfy.6 While this is worth exploring, focus on competition between the United States and Europe has distracted attention from the generative effects of sound in other areas of the world. Language may have divided Europe, but for the Spanish-speaking world the transition to sound held out the possibility of a film market unified by language. Standard histories of the American cinema mostly fail to recognize the extent to which language barriers could not be, and have not been, resolved simply by the use of technologies of translation. Most accounts accept the claim that the standardization of dubbing and subtitling by about 1932 effectively allowed Hollywood to resume exporting its films throughout the world as it had during the silent period.7 This claim rests upon the fact that most studios abandoned the production of multiple language versions (films made from scripts originally acted by an English-speaking cast and replaced in the version by foreign-language-speaking casts), which had represented the most striking attempt to overcome the problem of translation. It also points to the larger history of Hollywood’s continued dominance of the international film industry. Here I argue that the persistence of the direct production of Spanish-language films by American film studios through 1939 suggests not only that audiences continued to have strong preferences for films spoken in the local language that dubbing and titling failed to satisfy, but also that for very large language communities, this preference created opportunities to redefine film markets. Indeed, if we look closely at Hollywood’s attempts to maintain its position in Spanish-speaking countries during the 1930s, we find that studios were deeply alarmed by the rise of successful sound film industries in Mexico, Spain, and Argentina. It was this development that led Hollywood not only to continue direct production in Spanish but also to actively seek distribution and coproduction deals with these competitors.\n\n4\n\nTHE RISE OF SPANISH-LANGUAGE FILMMAKING\n\nSpoken language in film was more than just a mechanical problem to be solved. Actors who spoke identified themselves in ways that their counterparts in silent films never had. Their voices and the words they used were intimately linked to their bodies through the artificial, yet convincing, illusion of synchronization between sound and image tracks. This troubled critics of the time who feared that movies would become little more than filmed stage plays. Yet as Rick Altman has noted, over the course of the 1930s “it became increasingly clear all over the world that language, far from being anathema to the cinema experience, lay at its very heart.”8 Most audiences were interested in hearing the new voices emanate from the formerly silent images. What they heard were qualities of voice such as pitch or timber, but also accent and argot. Suddenly an actor’s nationality or ethnicity might be revealed not only visually by physiognomy, but aurally by speech. The addition of this new sensory information proved powerful. While costuming and makeup provided a range of plasticity to an actor’s image, the voice was less malleable. Now the ability to perform a role in an unfamiliar accent is widely recognized as an important and valuable trait for a film actor. This should suggest to us the dilemma that speech posed during the transition to sound. No longer could audiences imagine their favorite film stars speaking to them in the language of their own thoughts. The new linguistic specificity of sound films brought questions of culture to the fore. Hollywood sound films, spoken in English, became more markedly American than silent films had been. In 1930, the New York Times worried that the talkie would “break up the unity of mankind established by the movie. . . . [T]he universal brotherhood of the sign language is menaced by the advent of the sound film—the story of Babel Tower all over again.”9 For an industry that prided itself—as it continues to do—on the “universality” of its products, this posed a problem. As Ruth Vasey has shown, the introduction of sound pushed studios yet further in the direction of big-budget films that emphasized spectacle and action, fantasy and escapism.10 These characteristics helped to relieve the difficulties of cross-cultural communication that a reliance on international markets made inescapable. They failed, however, to eliminate audience appreciation for films that spoke more directly to local experience. Of course, “Spanish” itself was not so easy to pin down. The Spanish-version films of the early 1930s suffered from reviews that ridiculed film dialogues that mixed the argot of Argentina and Cuba, casts that featured Spaniards portraying Mexicans, or, worse yet, scripts that sounded like the language of no country at all. Far from a merely functional tool of communication, Spanish could also divide rather than unify its speakers. This would hinder Hollywood’s efforts to make and market films to Spanish-speaking audiences whether in the form of versions or dubbed or titled English-language originals—but it also sometimes complicated attempts by Spanish-speaking nations to circulate their films outside of national borders. Nor has this obstacle to broad appeal disappeared.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n5\n\nIn recent years, with the massive growth of television programming aimed at Spanish speakers, the development of “neutral Spanish” has emerged as a contentious issue for contemporary broadcasting and marketing aimed at Spanish speakers. In this context, “neutral” means “nationality-neutral” in terms of accent and regional idiom.11 The long history of conflicts over language usage among and within nations—and diasporic communities—where Spanish is a majority language informed the debates that emerged over the use of spoken Spanish in early sound films. Indeed, much like the notion of national community, the idea of a Spanish-language media market had to be imagined but, like national identities, remains subject to ongoing reformulations and debate. For the purpose of discussing a media market, it is more appropriate to describe Spanish-speakers as a cultural-linguistic grouping.12 Even so, the concept of a Hispanophone community or cultural tradition is tenuous. “Spanish” became a global language through the establishment of the Spanish empire, which lasted into the twentieth century, and also through the centralizing tendencies of the Spanish state that sought to impose Castilian as the standard language of both Spain and its overseas possessions. Local differences persisted nevertheless, and through processes of nation formation, regional accents, and idioms—along with other languages identified with indigenous or immigrant groups—became linked to national identities.13 While intellectuals and politicians from throughout the Spanish-speaking world had engaged in vigorous debates over the status of language usage in education, publishing, and the arts since the breakup of the Spanish empire, the advent of technologies that could faithfully reproduce the spoken word brought a new urgency to these discussions. The diffusion of sound films from the late 1920s on led to struggles over appropriate language usage for film dialogue in terms of accents and local idioms, the nationality of actors, narrative strategies, use of music, and film genres. These issues merged with what seemed to be the most pressing question of all: whether, and on what terms, Spanish speakers might use a shared definition of culture and a common language to wrest control of a transnational Spanish-language film market from the hands of the U.S. film industry. During the 1930s, as the worldwide economic recession undermined liberal internationalism, increased and often extreme nationalism exacerbated conflicts within and between Spain and the Spanish-speaking nations of Latin America. At the same time, despite the problems of language usage that plagued Hollywood Spanish-version films, their mixed nationality casts and crews and the resulting linguistic hybridity foreshadowed the important influence that U.S. Latinos would have on the development of an interand transnational media market for Spanish-speakers.14 Indeed, Hollywood’s Spanish-language film production of the 1930s owed much to the Latino communities of the United States. Some actors and writers made the transition from\n\nTHE RISE OF SPANISH-LANGUAGE FILMMAKING\n\n6\n\nlocal Spanish-language theater to work in film, and Latino audiences became an important part of the market for these movies. During the years of the Great Depression, the increasing availability of Spanish-language films, first made in Hollywood and later from other Spanish-speaking countries, kept theaters afloat when stage productions became too expensive to mount. These theaters ultimately became the basis for Spanish-language film circuits in the United States.15 The development of an international Spanish-speaking film market presupposed a belief that a common language was a reality that unified people from throughout the Americas, Spain, and, to a lesser extent, diasporic communities elsewhere. Whether other characteristics unified this group was less clear. During the 1930s, correspondence from within Hollywood shows that writers most often referred to people by nationality, as in Mexican, Cuban, Spanish (even in the case of individuals with U.S. citizenship). They frequently used the term “Spanish-speaking” to refer to the worldwide market for films in that language. At times, the word “Spanish” was used as an adjective to describe the market, a film, or—more ambiguously—a Spanish-speaking person who was not necessarily a Spaniard. “Hispanic” was occasionally used in the Englishlanguage press of the time period to refer to people from Spanish-speaking countries. The Spanish-language press also tended to prefer national or regionspecific references but frequently used “el pueblo hispano,” “paı´ses hispanos,” and “la raza hispana” to refer to Spanish-speaking people, countries, and race. On occasion, one can find references to “Latin” people or culture in Englishlanguage sources and “latino” in Spanish-language sources—in relation to either Latin America or to those countries and cultures with languages derived from Latin. These terms have persisted through the present day, although the question of appropriate usage has only grown more vexed. Within the United States, the distinction between “Hispanic” and “Latino” as ethnic labels remains a contentious issue that emerged in the wake of the civil rights movement and subsequent social activism. After government agencies, and the Census Bureau in particular, began adopting the term “Hispanic” in the 1970s for official use, many people and groups so described rejected the imposition of this label. Instead, some chose to use “Latino” in both adjectival and noun forms.16 In this book, I refer to people of Latin American descent in the United States as Latinos, and I use national terms of identification (Mexican, Cuban, Spanish, etc.) where appropriate. I use the word “Hispanic” when making a general reference to people from the broad grouping of countries and diasporic communities in which Spanish is a predominant language. Similarly, I sometimes refer to Anglo-America to distinguish the English-dominant population of the United States from the Spanish-speaking world. While discussions of which words are best suited to describe such heterogeneous groups frequently turn on arguments about the existence of shared\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n7\n\ncultural characteristics and the political implications of the terms, the influence of market concerns on the formation of group identities is one of the central points of this book. As Arlene Dávila has shown in her study of Latinos as a market segment for the advertising industry in the United States, the commodification of ethnic identities has political significance due to the centrality of consumerism and symbolic representations in contemporary society. She further argues that linking Latino identity to the Spanish language and to purportedly fixed cultural traits such as allegiance to family in marketing and advertising has strengthened a sense of pan-ethnicity among Latinos yet has carried the concomitant cost of reinforcing perceptions of Latinos as an immigrant group not fully integrated into American society.17 One might make a somewhat similar point about language differentiation in the mass media. If language difference has created opportunities for the fantastic growth of Spanish-language television throughout the Americas, it has grown along with commodified representations of “Latinidad.”18 In this book, I demonstrate that the transition to sound was a major precedent for these more recent developments. The creation of a Spanish-language film market came about due to Hollywood initiative as it sought to preempt any competition for sound films spoken in Spanish. This, in turn, provoked a response from Spanish-speaking countries and communities to insist that they were not only the arbiters of “appropriate” language usage, stories, settings, or casts for films in Spanish, but that they had superior claims to produce such films. An emphasis on pan-Hispanicism in the Spanish-speaking world was typically presented as resistance to cultural and economic domination by the United States, but this cultural anti-imperialism also implied accepting and, indeed, reinforcing the concept of a cultural-linguistic Spanish-speaking media market. The ability to insist on Hispanic particularity carried with it the cost of increasing the importance of the market as terrain for expressing social identities—an area in which the United States and Hollywood had distinct advantages.19 Timing also mattered to the development of Spanish-language filmmaking. By late 1929, when Variety’s famous headline blared, “Wall Street Lays an Egg,” most of the major American film studios had taken on large amounts of debt to finance the costs of the domestic conversion to sound.20 In 1930, the studios were still in the black thanks to profits from audience enthusiasm for the talkies. By the middle of the decade, however, most studios were in receivership as ticket revenues fell both at home and abroad and political turmoil in Europe began to close off some markets entirely. The hard times pressed Hollywood studios to streamline their production practices yet further and standardize the ways in which they prepared films for export. The larger context of worldwide economic depression also shaped how other nations responded to Hollywood and the rising tide of American cultural exports. In Spain and Latin America, the crisis years of the early 1930s gave rise to national-populist governments that\n\n8\n\nTHE RISE OF SPANISH-LANGUAGE FILMMAKING\n\nwere often willing to put in place protectionist measures, promote domestic industry, and play up national culture. While American film studios began the decade by making Spanish-version films with little concern for their cultural reception, both the economic pressures of the mid-1930s and producers’ increasing awareness of the need to compete with growing sound film industries in Mexico, Spain, and Argentina led to a turn toward coproduction and distribution deals and a final spate of Hollywood-based Spanish-language filmmaking.21 During the early 1930s, the seemingly large Spanish-speaking market had lacked depth. Rates of wiring cinemas for sound film projection varied widely between Spain and Latin America and, within Latin America, between major cities and less populous cities and towns. The sound film market in the Spanishspeaking world slowly expanded throughout the 1930s and increasingly favored Latin America over Spain (definitively so with the start of the Spanish Civil War in mid-1936). Furthermore, in rural areas of both Spain and Latin America, high rates of illiteracy made subtitling—the least expensive mode of film translation—an unacceptable option for many moviegoers. By this time, just as Hollywood studios, squeezed by the Depression, had begun to eliminate foreignlanguage-version productions, producers of sound films in Spain, Mexico, and Argentina found broad popular acceptance for movies that often played up national folklore and drew on popular theater traditions. The growth of these industries owed much to the years of Hollywood’s Spanish versions. Actors, writers, and directors who had worked on these films gained technical experience with sound film production and forged connections with each other that would later serve as transnational networks between Spanish-speaking film industries. Audiences for the Spanish versions made some of their favorites into stars who would later have greater box office draw when they worked in national cinemas elsewhere. Audience preferences also suggested what would later become popular genres. At the heart of this study are over 170 films that Hollywood studios made directly in Spanish between 1929 and 1939, the film professionals who worked on them, and the audiences who watched them.22 Film historians have long portrayed the multiple language versions (MLVs) of the early sound period as an eccentric experiment that flopped both at the box office and with critics. More recently, a few scholars have noted that MLVs persisted well past the 1930s, particularly in European film industries, and have argued that measuring their success or impact only by the standard of Hollywood’s bottom line obscures their true significance. Furthermore, so little archival work has been done on these films that generalizations about their quality, aesthetic interest, audience reception, or financial returns have rested on surprisingly little evidence.23 The heterogeneity of Hollywood’s Spanish-language production has also complicated an understanding of these films. While many qualify as MLVs and\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n9\n\nFIGURE 2 José Crespo and María Alba dancing in a scene from Olimpia (1930), the\n\nSpanish version of MGM’s His Glorious Night (1929). Courtesy of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nwere versions of (usually) English-language originals, some were so heavily adapted in their Spanish version that they might better be termed remakes, while others were entirely original productions. Finally, the difficulty of adjudicating these films to the history of Hollywood, or to the history of various national cinemas, has further hindered their study. Even where scholars have recognized as unprecedented the brief period when actors, writers, and directors from Spain, Latin America, and Spanishspeaking communities in the United States congregated in Hollywood to work on the new sound films in Spanish, few have systematically investigated the longer-term connections between this experience and subsequent developments, either for Hollywood itself or for film industries elsewhere.24 Yet the first years of commercial sound cinema during which only Hollywood studios were making films in the Spanish language demonstrated deep audience demand for films spoken in Spanish, created a network of Spanish-speaking film stars and professionals, generated creative activity (both within and outside of Hollywood) to build on successes and learn from failures, and sparked concerted efforts in the public and private sectors of Spanish-speaking countries to vie for control over this language-defined market. The history of these films’\n\n10\n\nTHE RISE OF SPANISH-LANGUAGE FILMMAKING\n\nproduction, circulation, and reception shows how language, as a key source of cultural identity, became a means of creating new space for audiovisual production that was deeply imbricated with the economic and symbolic power of Hollywood, but not entirely subsumed by it. One of the major issues that this study addresses is how Hollywood Spanish productions were received. Audience and critical reception, along with success at the box office, are issues with intrinsic interest, and they also bear on a more general appraisal of the significance of foreign-version production to the history of film. Evidence from the time period is frustratingly hard to come by. For many of the films, it is simply not available. Film criticism as we now understand it was incipient during the time period, and most of what passed for film reviews were no more than plot summaries. Other published writing on films often came directly from studio press releases. Information on a film’s box office is even harder to find as the very few financial ledgers from the time period that are held in public archives do not include a single Spanish-version film. The conclusions I am able to come to about the overall financial success of some Spanish productions (in chapters 2 and 5) are tentative given that they are based on an interpretation of disparate pieces of evidence drawn from a wide array of often partial and incommensurate sources. Nevertheless, they are a significant corrective to interpretations of Hollywood’s Spanish-language films that have relied primarily on published criticisms in the Spanish-language press as well as on the response of film executives who were dismayed both by negative publicity and by what were often initially disappointing box office receipts. One of the central contentions of this book is that while poor critical reception was significant in its own right as a cultural backlash and also because of its effect on film industry practice in regards to Spanish-speaking markets, such evidence has skewed our understanding of the real appeal that the early Spanish-language films had for popular audiences whose tastes and preferences were often ignored or derided by journalists and intellectuals. From 1929 through the 1930s, actors, writers, musicians, and directors from Argentina, Mexico, Spain, Cuba, and elsewhere worked on films made by U.S. film studios exclusively for Spanish-speaking audiences throughout the world. Not all of these films succeeded, but many did. A few became blockbusters. Paramount, with films starring tango singer Carlos Gardel, and Fox Films, with musicals featuring the Mexican tenor José Mojica, produced box office hits— allowing Gardel and Mojica to gain substantial control over their contracts and projects. While Gardel and Mojica commanded higher salaries, they were closely followed in popularity by singer and actress Imperio Argentina, who starred in some of the biggest movies of the decade in the Spanish-speaking world. Beyond the genre of musicals, major figures from the Spanish-speaking stage worked in Hollywood during these years. Spanish playwrights José López Rubio, Enrique Jardiel Poncela, Gregorio Martı´nez Sierra, and Edgar Neville wrote screenplays,\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n11\n\nand some adapted their own plays for the screen. Internationally known stage actors Ernesto Vilches and Catalina Bárcena starred in a series of films. Hollywood also tapped Spanish-speakers who had begun working in Hollywood in silent films for sound pictures, most notably, veteran star Antonio Moreno and newcomer Gilbert Roland (born Luis Alonso). Two of Spain’s most important directors from the silent period, Florián Rey and Benito Perojo, got Hollywood contracts and some of their first experience with sound production. Significant actors and directors of the early Mexican and Argentine sound cinema—such as René Cardona, Ramón Pereda, José Bohr, Arcady Boytler, Carlos Borcosque, and Manuel Romero—also got their start in Hollywood productions. Not only did the films of these years launch a Spanish-speaking star system, they encouraged both industry insiders and audiences to believe in the viability of a Spanish-language film market. These unintended consequences grew out of Hollywood’s attempt to forestall competition from film producers in Spanishspeaking countries. More intensely than at any other moment, the introduction of sound into the cinema seemed to present an opportunity for the reassertion of national and regional identities in the face of Hollywood’s domination of not just the film\n\nFIGURE 3 Ramón Novarro directing during the filming of Sevilla de mis amores, the\n\nSpanish version of MGM’s Call of the Flesh (1930). Courtesy of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\n12\n\nTHE RISE OF SPANISH-LANGUAGE FILMMAKING\n\ntrade, but cinematic expression itself. The rise of important film industries following the introduction of sound in Mexico, Spain, and Argentina in the 1930s demonstrates that the addition of spoken dialogue to films formed a protective barrier for the production of locally made movies. Cultural ties mattered as much as linguistic ties. Yet the constant exchange of people and cultural products throughout the world complicated attempts to create fixed notions of culture. In this sense, Hollywood’s Spanish-version films provided an excellent foil for other industries that could differentiate themselves by appealing to specifically national cultural norms; however, the need to compete with Hollywood for the whole of the Spanish-speaking market partially compromised this advantage. Quite often, national critics charged some of the most commercially successful films made in these industries in the 1930s with not usefully advancing a national project. Intellectuals routinely denounced, first, Hollywood’s Spanish-version films and, later, national films that seemed excessively influenced by Hollywood; but these critiques failed to stop audiences from voting with their feet. Popular preferences for films in the Spanish language, whether Hollywood versions or low-budget national films, ultimately exercised more influence over film production than did critical diatribes and provided the impetus for sustained local production. The transition to sound sparked a vibrant period of experimentation and often intense, if localized, competition. Direct production of films in the Spanish language may have started in Hollywood, but it did not end there. The creation of a market for Spanish-language audiovisual products succeeded and prompted a reorganization of production across national boundaries. This period became a transnational moment of opportunity for a group of nations, peoples, and cultures broadly defined as “Hispanic” to participate in cultural production—albeit often on terms defined by Hollywood’s dominance. Too often film historians have understood other cinemas as significant, but subordinate in importance to Hollywood—the only film industry that has had global audiences and global influence for a sustained period of time. This emphasis, while not unwarranted given the historical and contemporary reality of Hollywood’s power, has distorted understanding of the ways in which other cinemas have successfully exploited local and regional markets precisely by employing popular but non-universal appeal. Ultimately, market-based appeals to specific cultural and ethnic identities played a role in processes of modernization by linking social identities to the consumption of mass media products. When viewed from the perspective of language, we can see how this history of the transition to sound shapes part of the prehistory of the globalization of media and forms of popular culture that characterize the contemporary world. Much like the contradiction that lies at the heart of the term “globalization,” synchronized sound both accelerated homogenization in the commercial cinema and fostered a new heterogeneity of sites of production and modes of address.25\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n13\n\nIn the chapters that follow, I trace the beginnings of Spanish-language filmmaking, first in Hollywood and then outward toward the Spanish-speaking world where these films were watched, debated, imitated, and vilified. I also follow the webs of connection between film workers who circulated between Hollywood and various national industries. I look closely at the personal, economic, and symbolic relationships that linked films across their production and reception histories. Throughout, I develop the theme of what language meant vis-à-vis Spanish-speaking cultures and in relation to modern identities that became increasingly mediated through audiovisual forms of entertainment. To reconstruct key developments, I have drawn upon substantial collections of film studio correspondence, business and production files, extensive reviews of contemporary film magazines and newspapers, and viewings of extant Spanishlanguage productions from the time period. While Hollywood, that ambiguously defined place that exists as much in our imagination as on a map, is an organizing presence at the center of this study, in the historical narrative that follows, the soundtrack is slightly out of synch. Although presented here in English, the principal actors in this narrative mostly spoke Spanish. This slippage between the tight synchronization of sound and image, which in the narrative style of classical Hollywood cinema serves to distract attention from the material construction of the film, here creates a space for the history of film workers and audiences who heard something different.26 Chapter 1 briefly outlines Hollywood’s relationships to international markets, particularly in the Spanish-speaking world, during the period just prior to the conversion to sound. It next explores initial reactions in these markets to Hollywood’s earliest sound films. Since many of these were in English with little, and frequently poor quality, translation, the sharply negative responses of critics and audiences led Hollywood to begin making short films in Spanish, even as a few independent studios jumped in to make the first Spanish features. Covering roughly 1928–1929, this chapter demonstrates the improvisation of these early responses to the problem of language and, by looking closely at a few maverick producers, suggests how this transitional period created opportunities for innovation. In chapter 2, we see how Hollywood studios turned to largescale foreign-language production to forestall competition. During 1930 and 1931, studios produced foreign versions en masse. While Hollywood did little to take into account cultural difference beyond the substitution of the casts, many of these films did well at the box office with popular audiences pleased to hear their language without the distraction of dubbing or titles. This chapter surveys the large body of Spanish-language versions made during these years and introduces the significant theme of the split between popular and elite responses to them among their target audiences. The following two chapters deal with the explosion of nationalist and sometimes pan-Hispanic resistance on the part of cultural elites to the Hollywood\n\n14\n\nTHE RISE OF SPANISH-LANGUAGE FILMMAKING\n\nSpanish versions, and their insistence that they must fight cinema with cinema. Chapter 3 studies the “war of the accents,” or the polemic that raged between Spaniards and Latin Americans over appropriate usage of the Spanish language in Hollywood sound films with multinational casts. It looks first at the deliberations of a committee formed by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to mediate this dispute and then turns to a detailed history of Warner Brothers’ first Spanish-language feature, El hombre malo (The Bad Man, 1930). While casting a Spaniard to play the lead character of Mexican bandit Pancho López seemed to be the misstep that sparked a controversy in the Mexican press over this film, a more broadly negative response to the film by critics throughout Latin America and Spain shows the depth of resentment that Hollywood stereotypes of Hispanic cultures provoked. Chapter 4 continues this theme by looking at the most significant political response to Hollywood’s foray into Spanish-language production, the 1931 Spanish American Film Congress. This multinational meeting hosted by Spain sought to forge treaty agreements between Spanish-speaking nations that would create a protected film market and industry, but the weakness of local film industries doomed this ambitious project to failure. Still, the rhetoric of pan-Hispanic solidarity became a useful tool for the promotion of some of the earliest sound films in Spanish made outside of Hollywood, even as these were made by professionals who had worked on Hollywood versions. Chapter 5 examines how Hollywood studios responded to the severe economic crisis of 1931–1932 in terms of its international markets. Most studios eliminated or cut back on version films and worked to improve and standardize dubbing and titling methods for translation. These moves seemed to make sense given the often sharp critical backlash against version films and the apparently poor performance of version films at the box office. This chapter features a case study of the Foreign Department at Warner Brothers as the studio worked feverishly to find solutions that would allow it to continue to export films internationally but keep the costs associated with translation to a minimum. For the Spanish-speaking market, many of the linguistic controversies associated with versions also played into critical reception of dubbed films, while subtitling ran into the problem of widespread illiteracy among potential audiences. This chapter suggests that the turn to dubbing and titling was a choice conditioned by circumstances that did not reflect the full potential of Spanish-language filmmaking. In chapter 6, a study of Fox Films’ Spanish Department from 1932 to 1935 confirms that Hollywood could and did make money on its Spanish-language films, but also shows how the difficulties of trying to please both elite and popular Spanish and Latin American audiences continued to hinder this studio’s efforts. The studio veered between hiring some of the most noted writers and performers ever to work on Spanish versions in order to acquire greater cultural capital and trying to make popular fare that would appeal to the widest possible\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n15\n\naudiences. This chapter also highlights the ambivalence of the relatively powerful writers and performers who worked on these films toward the Hollywood studio system and its role in dictating mass culture. Chapter 7 suggests the resolution of some of these conflicting interests. Sound filmmaking exploded in Mexico, Spain, and Argentina, but it tended to draw on popular forms such as the musical and melodrama that exaggerated national characteristics. Hollywood studios, in turn, began to buy distribution and coproduction rights to these films as a way of participating in the profits without having to take responsibility for their cultural authenticity. Studios preferred working with known quantities, whether in terms of genre or the people involved in the productions, many of whom had first gained experience working on Hollywood’s Spanish versions. While these developments frequently displeased national critics, they allowed films to attract wide audiences in the Spanish-speaking world. The concluding chapter reflects on the longer-term implications of the changes provoked by sound in the 1930s. The onset of World War II, and with it the direct intervention of the U.S. government into the film industry, significantly favored Mexico and crippled Argentina, while Spain remained devastated by the outcomes of the Civil War. The boom years of the Mexican Golden Age cinema revealed the full extent of the popular market for films in the Spanish language. Although made in Mexico, the films circulated throughout Latin America, Spain, and Spanish-speaking communities in the United States. The casts were often multinational and the favored genres drew on precedents already in place by the late 1930s. Although an excessive reliance on outworn formulas and on government subsidies ultimately contributed to the decline of the Mexican industry by the late 1950s, a Spanish-language audiovisual market remained viable. In terms of cinema, the clearest expression of this was the rise of the New Latin American cinema of the 1960s. These films represented a significant pan–Latin American conversation about the possibilities of film art as a means of social critique in nations that increasingly identified with the concerns of the Third World. These films drew worldwide attention for their aesthetic and political interest and helped shape the intellectual culture of the Latin American left, but were not widely popular among Spanish-speaking audiences in the way the Spanish, Mexican, and Argentine hits of the 1930s and 1940s had been.27 Rather, one must look to the rise of popular television genres, such as the telenovela that began by the late 1950s, to see the continued appeal of Spanish-language entertainment among mass audiences. Likewise, in other areas of the world such as India, Hong Kong, and Egypt, the chance to market films and later television to large audiences as defined by language had transformative effects on the growth of new entertainment industries. The precursor to these developments was the introduction of synchronized sound to the commercial cinema. It is to that moment that we will now turn.\n\n1 bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb\n\nFirst Responses to the Challenge of Sound, 1929–1930\n\nHollywood had well established control over international film markets by the 1920s. If some European industries, though recovering from the effects of World War I and hampered by small domestic markets, could still hope to compete, neither Spain nor any Latin American country could do so. To create and maintain its advantage, the American film industry used the power of an integrated system of production, distribution, and exhibition; the advantage of a large home market; the support of the U.S. government in trade treaty negotiations; and sophisticated strategies for accommodating and assuaging critiques of its films.1 Foreign resentment of Hollywood’s domination of local screens—with often more than 90 percent of screen time—persisted nonetheless. When sound came in, and with it an increased awareness of cultural difference brought about by the greater reliance on dialogue, the terms of the relationship between Hollywood and its foreign markets stood to be renegotiated. It was a moment of improvisation and of opportunity. The Hollywood studio system was not only powerful, but also flexible, and thus could be expected to successfully improvise responses to the challenge of sound and foreign marketing. Already by the interwar years the American film industry made 20 to 40 percent of its profits from international markets and would increasingly depend on this income.2 Still, the problem of spoken language in film was profound. How would Spanish-speaking audiences respond to sound films in English? How could Hollywood supply a demand for films in Spanish? Who would make such films? From the perspective of Hollywood studios, these questions were a relatively minor matter and only a part of the larger challenge posed by the conversion to sound. This, too, would have its consequences. The small-scale and somewhat haphazard response of the industry to the question of how to sell films to Spanish-speaking audiences created opportunities for newcomers to influence how this production would develop. 16\n\nFIRST RESPONSES TO THE CHALLENGE OF SOUND, 1929–1930\n\n17\n\nPrior to sound, the countries in which Spanish was the majority language had never merited much attention as an important source of talent or potential competition. This changed once film studios realized that they needed material in the local language. Since Hollywood’s profitability rested in large measure on employing economies of scale, the new requirements of sound film favored language-specific production for markets lucrative enough, such as the major European countries, or numerous enough, such as Spanish-speaking countries. The need to produce films in Spanish was further propelled by the often fierce critical backlash against early sound films that were shown in English and seemed to smack of linguistic imperialism. These responses would lead some countries to make credible threats of passing legislation that would ban films with English-language dialogue or songs. Even so, any duplication of production meant a loss of profit for Hollywood studios. Thus early efforts to make films in Spanish tended to take place around the edges of the industry or in small-scale experiments. Much of the early sound film production in Spanish would be made either at major studio B units or at independent studios that produced films but contracted with the majors for distribution deals. The language barrier and lack of cultural knowledge on the part of English-speaking industry insiders, coupled with the low profile typical of early Spanish-language productions, meant that newcomers could take chances, gain exposure, and shape the new field.\n\nCity of Dreams In 1931, German-Chilean actor José Bohr starred in a film titled Hollywood, ciudad de ensueño (Hollywood, City of Dreams, Fenix Film) that was based on a script treatment he wrote. The film’s story is autobiographical and both it and Bohr’s career trajectory suggest to us major tendencies in the history of Spanishlanguage filmmaking, both during the first few years in Hollywood and later outside of the United States. In Hollywood, ciudad de ensueño Bohr plays the lead role—as himself. The fictional José Bohr wins a talent contest sponsored by a local cigarette company and travels to Hollywood “from the remotest corner of South America” to become an actor and, if possible, to meet the famous film star Alice Drexel, played by the less-than-famous actress Nancy Drexel. Bohr invents pretexts to see Drexel and takes a job as a waiter on one of her film sets before finally getting a chance to convince the director of his talent. After a successful screen test, Bohr costars with Drexel. One day during a break from filming a Western on location, Drexel wanders over to the sound recording set up and puts on the earphones. Suddenly she is able to overhear a conversation between Bohr and another woman through the boom mike hanging from the tree under which they are standing. Romantic complications ensue, and once Drexel is convinced that Bohr is seeing another, she returns to her old flame.\n\n18\n\nTHE RISE OF SPANISH-LANGUAGE FILMMAKING\n\nDepressed and unable to hide his feelings while filming scenes with her, Bohr loses his job and decides to leave Hollywood. Although Drexel finally realizes he loved only her all along, she arrives at the docks too late—just in time to see Bohr’s ship leaving for South America. Bohr sits sadly below, in steerage class, singing a tango titled “Hollywood, City of Dreams.”3 Bohr’s self-referential film narrates part of the story of the first few years of Spanish-language filmmaking in Hollywood. In his film, a combination of luck, talent, and persistence nets him a chance to break into an industry that suddenly needs Spanish-speakers with star potential. Likewise, in real life, the possibilities seemed limitless for a man like Bohr. The multitalented, selfconfident, and entrepreneurial José Bohr frequently found that he was his own best commodity. Bohr, whose family emigrated to Latin America when he was a child, had worked briefly in silent films in Chile before becoming known as a composer and singer of tangos for the radio in Argentina. He began to tour the Americas, including New York, where he opened his own nightclub and performed in an Argentine musical act as a gaucho. In 1926, he made a few short films with Lee De Forest, the inventor of a sound system that served as a model for other inventors. The fame of his stage act and his contacts in the recording industry led Universal and Paramount to feature him in some short musical revue films in 1929. Intended to test the market and fill at least some of the audience demand for films in Spanish, these early shorts also served to test the appeal of their stars. Bohr proved to have plenty of appeal, but the first contract for a featurelength film in Spanish came not from a major studio, but from an independent, Sono Art Films. He played the lead in the second-ever Spanish-language feature and the earliest dual-version film in Spanish and English: the 1929 Sombras de gloria (Blaze o’ Glory).4 Bohr’s first sound feature helped cement his popularity throughout the Spanish-speaking world, and he soon starred in another feature for Sono Art, Así es la vida (What a Man, 1930).5 Though independently produced, Paramount and Universal distributed these two films. Also in 1930, Bohr had a featured role as a Mexican bandit in an English-language Western, The Rogue of the Rio Grande, with Myrna Loy. Unlike many of the performers who appeared in the early musical shorts and first independent features made in Spanish, Bohr never made the leap to the Spanish versions of the major studios during 1930 and 1931. This was most likely due to his successful singing tours during this time period. Bohr’s Hollywood, City of Dreams would be his last movie made at the edges of Hollywood, but far from his last film. By the mid-1930s he was directing films in Mexico before moving on to work in the Chilean industry, where he became director general of Chile Films. By the 1950s, he made the transition to television. Bohr’s experiences in Hollywood suggest important features of the early years of sound when the possibilities of targeting film markets defined by\n\nFIGURE 4 Advertisement for a showing in Mexico City of José Bohr’s first featurelength film, Sombras de gloria, the Spanish version of Sono-Art’s Blaze o’ Glory (1929). Author’s collection.\n\n20\n\nTHE RISE OF SPANISH-LANGUAGE FILMMAKING\n\nlanguage led film studios to improvise and aspiring film professionals to find— or create—opportunity. Often they would have to do so on the sets of lowbudget, low-profile films and on short-term contracts. Like Bohr, many would have their hopes of Hollywood stardom dashed but would take away with them important experience, contacts, and name recognition that would later serve them well in their careers and help develop Spanish-language filmmaking outside of Hollywood.\n\nSounds American The fictional José Bohr may have left Hollywood in steerage class as a failed immigrant, but the real Bohr left to embark on a triumphal singing tour that featured the hit songs from Hollywood, ciudad de ensueño and his earlier two films. The tour took him throughout Central America and the Caribbean, where he was consistently greeted by ecstatic crowds. He used the opportunity to promote his vision of a Spanish-language cinema made in Latin America, by Latin Americans. When he presented the film in Managua, Nicaragua, he repeated this message: “It’s time that we end movies in other languages with subtitles. We need movies in our Spanish language to invade the screens of our countries.” Bohr reported that the crowd responded with loud cries of “Viva el Che Bohr” and “Viva Sandino”—a reference to the revolutionary leader Augusto Sandino, then leading resistance against the U.S. military presence in Nicaragua.6 Such responses suggest the potency of the language issue during the early years of sound films. They also help to explain why it was that ultimately the first ever commercial sound films in the Spanish language would be made in Hollywood. Sound films in English often provoked nationalist backlash and threats of consumer boycotts or restrictive legislation that alarmed American film studios, especially as they faced a deteriorating economic situation. The U.S. film industry had converted to sound in response to competition between the major and minor studios that comprised Hollywood. At the time— about 1927—these studios did not know whether talking pictures would catch on or how best to exploit the possibilities of synchronized sound. By 1929, sound films had ceased to be novelties in the United States, although abroad the conversion process was just getting started. The initial confusion and dismay frequently expressed by film studio executives over selling sound films to nonEnglish-speaking audiences indicated more than a momentary crisis of confidence. Film studios had no plan for the problem of translating sound film dialogue or song lyrics, and most of their early efforts to do so were a process of trial and error. Furthermore, in Hollywood’s foreign markets, the transition to sound took place just as a prolonged period of worldwide recession was beginning. The flush economic conditions of the late 1920s had permitted film studios to gamble by investing heavily in sound and buying up theater chains.\n\nFIRST RESPONSES TO THE CHALLENGE OF SOUND, 1929–1930\n\n21\n\nStudios achieved greater degrees of vertical integration of production and exhibition and also expanded horizontally into industries such as radio and recorded music.7 The conversion to sound initially paid off in enormous profits, but by 1931 the motion picture industry suffered from a combination of falling rates of attendance, lower ticket prices, higher production costs (due to making all dialogue films), and theater closings. Massive layoffs, wage-cutting, and costcutting throughout the motion picture industry helped staunch the losses but could not offset them.8 Internationally, the American film industry faced falling revenues as governments began taking national currencies off the gold standard and instituting conversion controls. The slower pace of sound conversion abroad exacerbated these problems. While domestically most theaters had wired for sound by the start of the Depression, in Europe sound spread more slowly from urban to rural areas. In Latin America, even theaters in major capitals did not show their first sound films until 1929. International distributors of American films continued to require a supply of both sound and silent films beyond the point when producing silent films for the domestic market remained profitable. Yet the most complicated situation Hollywood faced in its international markets was the need to address problems of cultural reception for sound films in English. In the major cities of Europe and Latin America, the first sound shorts and features that included sound segments drew attention for their novelty but also provoked sharp criticisms both for their use of English and for the poor translation provided. A few cases were extreme, such as when Parisian filmgoers at a Montmartre theater protested on three consecutive nights during showings of a Fox musical revue in English with French subtitles. On the third night, rioters did their best to demolish the 1,500-seat theater, making clear that they were enraged at having been duped into seeing a sound film in English.9 While such audience reactions were far from typical, anti-Americanism in response to the first showings of sound films often characterized critical reception in Europe and Latin America.10 The first sound film to be shown in Mexico City, Al Jolson’s second feature, The Singing Fool, played in 1929. While this and other early sound films were popular with Mexican audiences, they set off an avalanche of editorials, articles, and letters to the editor. Critics advertised the dangers that sound films made in the United States represented for Mexico. Federico Gamboa, an eminent novelist (whose book Santa would serve as the basis for the first ever commercial sound film in Mexico), urged his compatriots to “oppose, by all available means, letting [the Yankees] poison us . . . with this pernicious immigration of celluloid men and women.” The anti-talkie fury in the press was such that when Jolson’s The Jazz Singer was premiered in Mexico about two months after The Singing Fool, it was shown as a silent.11 The new medium of sound film drew attention to linguistic difference and reinvigorated underlying concerns about the growing predominance of American culture in the world.\n\n22\n\nTHE RISE OF SPANISH-LANGUAGE FILMMAKING\n\nSilent film had relied on the active participation of spectators to interpret actors’ pantomime performances, to read visual cues, and to construct a narrative that relied on very few brief lines of text in intertitles. This interaction bound the spectator to the screen in a way that some contemporaries believed the excessive specificity and realism of films with dialogue, sound effects, and music would undermine.12 Charles Chaplin declared in 1929 that sound destroyed “the great beauty of silence.” The performer most famously associated with the new talkies, Al Jolson, replied to this remark: “What he’s really got is a gentleman complex. He’s afraid he talks too nice to fit in with the characterization he has built up on the screen.” Jolson meant, of course, that Chaplin’s “Tramp” character would not work with Chaplin’s refined English accent.13 Both men’s remarks pointed to the salient differences between silent and sound films as well as to aesthetic concerns about film as art and class tensions. The new voices emanating from the screen heightened listeners’ sensitivities to the imagined identities of film stars. In Spain, one journalist wrote of how he believed audiences there experienced the novelty of sound. “We can no longer imagine, for example, that our heroines possess the lovely voice that we would want them to have. . . . [Instead,] when a lovely figure appears on the silver screen she belts out a ‘very well thank you’ with a voice that stuns us with its resemblance to that of a street tough.”14 If silence had lent itself to ambiguity and imaginative possibilities, sound often meant direct, vernacular realism. For non-American audiences, this produced a double shock since the stars had begun to speak not only with surprising voices, but also in a foreign language or unfamiliar accent. Popular audiences would often prove far more tolerant of the new sound films from Hollywood than film critics or intellectuals, but cultural elites had greater power to influence government policies. The introduction of sound into the cinema crystallized long-simmering discussions about the cultural threat posed by Hollywood. In Mexico, Carlos Noriega Hope, publisher of a major newspaper, led a campaign against the use of spoken English in sound films. One writer warned that “within a year there will be no more silent films in Mexico, and [the] talkies are in English. If American propaganda had reached amazing proportions through the film medium before, now it will culminate in taking away the only thing that halfway remained to us: our language. In five years, we won’t just be chewing gum, but we’ll be mangling our Spanish as well.”15 Fears about sound films were often linked to fears of a general onslaught of an American way of life. They were grounded in larger critiques of the United States as a neocolonial power in the hemisphere, and both Latin American and European intellectuals often made arguments about what would come to be called cultural imperialism. Such articles demanded legislation against the importation of English-language films. In 1929, some American studios began to adapt their films by suppressing dialogue and leaving only music on the sound track. Nevertheless, restrictive\n\nFIRST RESPONSES TO THE CHALLENGE OF SOUND, 1929–1930\n\n23\n\nlegislation passed in Italy and Spain—and threats of similar legislation in Cuba, Mexico, Argentina, and Brazil—that banned films in foreign languages, including “dubbed” films that left songs in the original English, also pressed the U.S. industry.16 This situation accelerated the pressure to improvise better solutions for translating films and to try direct production in foreign languages. The economic pressures of the Great Depression and the political turmoil in Europe made conceiving of and maintaining a Spanish-language market a priority. Adapting films into Spanish, whether through translation or direct production, was necessary to overcome audience resistance to sound films in English and feasible because the size of the Spanish-speaking market still allowed studios to take advantage of economies of scale.\n\nNew Markets In the 1910s and 1920s, the American film industry, as the world’s leader in exports, had already dealt with problems posed by cultural acceptance of its products and regularly made minor adaptations to suit foreign sensibilities.17 Studios had developed distribution networks with foreign offices, and industry trade papers published articles about the European, South American, or other regional markets. For the most part, all foreign markets received films that had also played domestically. The translation and substitution of intertitles was a minor matter in terms of cost and significance. The addition of spoken, language-specific dialogue to film changed this. After a short phase when the sheer novelty of sound films attracted spectators even if they did not understand the words, film producers realized that their films had to be made linguistically comprehensible to continue to attract audiences. Both in the United States and abroad, those involved in marketing films began to conceive of film markets as coterminous with large linguistic communities. At first, in the United States, this division seemed merely mechanical. In the film industry, making the original negative of a film required a large investment, but it could then be reproduced for a fraction of the cost. Adapting films into different languages, whether through titling, dubbing, or direct foreign-language production, increased costs substantially. The greater numbers of negatives and master prints alone was costly; a Variety article from early 1930 estimated that the raw film stock industry grew by 300 percent because of the multiple copies required for the export of sound films.18 Cutting down the number of additional, distinct copies of films for export required studios to limit the number of languages into which films would be adapted. In 1930, after surveying market conditions in Europe, George Canty, a representative of the Department of Commerce’s Motion Picture Division, recommended English, Spanish, German, and French as the principal languages for sound film\n\nTHE RISE OF SPANISH-LANGUAGE FILMMAKING\n\n24\n\nproduction. These would cover much of Europe. Canty suggested that smaller countries that did not speak any of these languages fell into two different categories: those too small to merit direct productions in their own language, but unlikely to accept films in one of the “major” languages (such as Sweden or Italy), and small countries that might accept sound films in a second language (such as Portugal, which could show Spanish-language films).19 This division only considered Europe, but the linguistic needs of other parts of the world confirmed the four principal languages. A Variety article from early 1930 “market-rated” languages for sound films: “English, first and far away the bulk of the market; German, second; Spanish, because of South American [sic], third; French, fourth, taking in Canada and Egypt in addition to the French colonies. Italian, Norse country and other dialects and dialogs don’t matter— much.”20 This rank order roughly corresponded to the percentages that these countries, or combinations of countries, had represented as sources of foreign profits during the 1920s. This grouping makes two divergent trends apparent. It prioritized the European countries, but it also signaled the fundamental difficulty that would face European film producers—the lack of a common regional language. Nevertheless, the concept of language markets meant new opportunities for those countries that could produce films in one of the major languages. German and French represented relatively few problems of cultural diversity within the language market. The extent of the German-language market was mostly contained in central Europe, and the French market, while more complicated, still derived most of its profitability from France itself. English and Spanish were significantly different cases because they consisted of many diverse nations and colonies. Germany, France, and Great Britain all had film industries of some significance and with the introduction of sound could hope to use their domestic and ancillary markets in order to compete with the United States. In the newly conceived Spanish-language market, no single country was in a position to take the lead in film production. Spain, Argentina, and Mexico had small film industries and the silent films they produced had mostly circulated only domestically. Nevertheless, these three countries were important markets for films from the United States. Latin America imported more linear feet of film per year than any other region. While in the mid-1920s the Spanish-speaking countries represented just over 16 percent of all foreign profits for the American film industry, in 1927 and 1928 Latin America alone (including Portuguesespeaking Brazil) accounted for a little over 30 percent of foreign profits—the increase due to the effects of restrictive legislation on films in Europe.21 During the early sound period, observers typically estimated the Spanishspeaking market as over 100 million people, although this figure was based on population, rather than on the actual number of people who had access to\n\nFIRST RESPONSES TO THE CHALLENGE OF SOUND, 1929–1930\n\n25\n\ncinemas and the means to buy a ticket. Its size was matched by its diversity. The most ample definition included the Spanish-speaking countries of North, South, and Central America, the Caribbean, Spain, diasporic communities in the United States, the Philippines, and even the Sephardic Jews of the Middle East.22 Of course, this market did not come ready-made but was developed in response to the new requirements of selling sound films. By any measure, however, the film industry recognized that Spanish speakers constituted a market large and lucrative enough to merit special attention. By late 1929, Hollywood studios had begun to search for the best solution to the problem of adapting sound films for the large language markets. For Spanish, French, and German, most studios debated between dubbing and making versions of their films with native-speaker casts. Most tried dubbing first, but the initially poor technical results and audience rejection pushed most of the major studios to a policy of making at least some version films and adapting the rest of their films with a combination of titling and dubbing.23 The threat of European competition also made finding solutions to the language issue urgent. In October of 1929 Variety predicted that films made in France would soon outperform American sound films. “[Now] that the novelty of American dialog is wearing off . . . as soon as native-made talkers, in the native tongue, are marketed, it will sweep everything before it.”24 By March of 1930, Variety ran a fullpage headline declaring “U.S. May Lose Europe.” The article, which threatened that the situation would worsen, stated that the lack of films in local languages was undermining the “supremacy of American pictures.” Not only were American studios failing to supply European markets, but German and French producers were “making a bold play to benefit from the condition, rushing through French, Spanish, Italian and German dialog material. It is pretty certain to click, regardless of its poor quality as compared to American standards.”25 Throughout 1930, the trade press continued to chronicle the efforts of European competitors to make films in not just their own languages, but other European languages as well. For most of the American film studios, the question became not whether to make multilingual versions, but whether to produce them in the United States or abroad.26\n\nShort-Term Solutions In 1930, a new film journal in Spain by the name of Mudo y sonoro (Silent and sound) summed up the problem succinctly. “[The] Spanish audience, like the Spanish American, will accept sound film with just two conditions: either they are given talkies in their language, or in their absence, films that are easy to understand, with a minimum of dialogue and a maximum of musical numbers. . . . [O]nly with these two formulas will [the major film producers] manage to satisfy us and avoid losing the extensive Spanish-speaking market.”27\n\nTHE RISE OF SPANISH-LANGUAGE FILMMAKING\n\n26\n\nBy 1929, studios had already come to this conclusion. Developments would push the major studios into producing foreign-language features by about mid-1930, but their initial response during 1929 was to start by making a series of shorts and films such as musical revues that cobbled together a series of variety acts. Sound film conventions were not yet well established even in the predominant English-language cinema. The uncertainty over audience preferences, whether in terms of genres, stars, or—in the case of non-English speakers—language and modes of translation, made relying on entertainment with a proven track record, such as stage acts, an appealing and less risky choice. After all, the novelty of synchronized sound came not only from dialogue, but also from songs and music. These factors help to account for the musical revue films of 1929–1930, such as The Broadway Melody or Paramount on Parade. Not only could the revues play for domestic audiences, they could also easily be reformatted for export. The sequences in which an English-speaking master of ceremonies introduced the acts could be substituted with sequences of a master of ceremonies speaking in the local language if the market merited it—otherwise, the relatively small amount of dialogue could be subtitled or simply eliminated. Furthermore, since the revue films did not depend on narrative development, it was also possible to adapt them by adding some musical acts or sketches performed in the target language.28 For Spanish-speaking export markets, a number of studios and independent producers also made stand-alone shorts consisting of musical acts or sketches. These one- or two-reel films accompanied the first partial or full sound features (usually English-language films). Many of the shorts featured performers already working in stage shows in the United States or Spanish-speaking film actors with vocal skills. José Bohr, for instance, appeared in a musical short for Paramount titled simply Canciones típicas (Popular songs). Studios also used these films as an inexpensive and quick way to try out new talent. Initially, the market’s diversity defied Hollywood’s reliance on the star system to promote its products. In a strategy later repeated by others, one producer decided to “test the various Spanish speaking countries” with a musical revue film that would star a Spaniard, an Argentine, a Cuban, and a Mexican.29 Numerous actors who would later appear in studio version films first worked on short films intended to accompany the earliest sound features as they began to be exported. In late 1929, Variety reported that major studios were worried about “the inroads the independents [were] making on their pictures in foreign tongues here, especially in Spanish.”30 Independents had greater flexibility and could respond more quickly to new opportunities, and this allowed them to rush into Spanish-language production before most studios. The first few films, the individuals who made them, and the strategies they employed demonstrate the new opportunities that marketing films to Spanish-speakers represented, although these opportunities were tempered initially by the disadvantages of working around the edges of Hollywood.\n\nFIRST RESPONSES TO THE CHALLENGE OF SOUND, 1929–1930\n\n27\n\nIn the popular culture of the period, Hollywood’s A-list films occupied much of the limelight, but such films were often just the tip of the iceberg. Their glamour helped deflect attention from the mechanisms of rational production that governed the U.S. film industry. In Bohr’s film Hollywood, ciudad de ensueño, he and Drexel are shown making a Western for the “International Studios” company. In real life, the actress Nancy Drexel’s career from 1926 to 1932 consisted almost solely of roles in low-budget Westerns made by big studio B units or by independents. Every studio turned out dozens of quicker and cheaper films that helped it supply its distributors. Although the studios had achieved vertical integration with their distribution and exhibition branches and had rationalized their mode of production into an efficient, in-house undertaking characterized by sharp divisions of labor and specialization, the industry was not entirely closed. Independent companies made an important number of low-budget films, often pitched at niche markets. Both these companies and the B film units of the majors and minors served as training grounds for new workers, and as less risky venues for innovation. Because films in Spanish were intended for only a part of the world film market, almost all were made with low budgets, by independent companies or by the B units of the bigger studios. Hollywood’s A films had to appeal to markets throughout the world to justify their large budgets, whereas B films could be used in selected markets or even just distributed domestically.31 During the 1930s, low-budget B films made up nearly 75 percent of all American film production that had to supply a voracious market accustomed to double features and frequent film turnover. B film production allowed the majors and minors to amortize fully the costs of maintaining installations such as stages and sets and of keeping workers on contract. B films meant significantly smaller budgets than A films, lesser or unknown stars, shorter shooting schedules, and slightly shorter running times. Because the big studios could not entirely supply a vast and varied exhibition market, independent producers also made B films and developed new talent, techniques, and film genres, some of which the established companies would later pick up. The seeming unimportance of the individual B film allowed both makers and spectators to escape some of the constraints of the studio system. Independents often made films for specialized audiences, such as those at small or rural theaters with low ticket prices, or ethnic audiences. The ethnic films of the 1930s—including those made by and for African Americans, Yiddish- and Chinese-language films, and some of the Spanish-language films made by U.S. Latinos—demonstrate how B film production created space for specialized filmmaking practice.32\n\nFirst Features The dynamic relationship between studio and independent B film production helps explain Hollywood Spanish-language filmmaking in the 1930s. In 1929, independents rushed into Spanish-language filmmaking. Although they were\n\n28\n\nTHE RISE OF SPANISH-LANGUAGE FILMMAKING\n\nquickly overtaken by the Hollywood studios in 1930, some of those who had produced, directed, and acted in the early independent efforts used their experience to gain employment on the Hollywood Spanish versions. Similarly, later in the decade, when most studios had ceased Spanish-language production, independents again began to produce such films using actors from the version films and taking advantage of their contacts with studios to make distribution deals. At the outset of Spanish-language production, both risk and uncertainty were high—a situation that favored ambitious innovators. Some actors moved between working for Hollywood studios and for independent productions, and the most entrepreneurial among them also produced their own projects. In 1929, none of the Spanish-speaking countries had adequate sound production facilities, and thus these constitute the earliest Spanish-language films to reach commercial screens. In many important ways, those who made these early films in Spanish entered an “empty field” of cultural production, specifically within the American film industry.33 The industry had some existing structures for recruiting foreign workers, but not for choosing appealing and capable Spanish-speaking actors, much less for developing and marketing appropriate projects. Audience preference for comprehensible sound films was high, as was intra-industry competition for foreign markets, where studios had less direct control over distribution and exhibition than they did domestically. Although the studios quickly rushed into foreign-language production, independent companies had some room to develop Spanish-language films. Given the general lack of knowledge about the incipient language market, they experimented with different strategies for appealing to audiences. Independent companies in the United States produced the first true Spanish-language features (of five reels or more). They represent a variety of strategies. The films include Sombras habaneras (Havana shadows, 1929), Sombras de gloria (Blaze o’ Glory, 1929), Sombra vengadora (Shadow of vengeance, 1929), Charros, gauchos y manolas (1930), La rosa de fuego (Rose of fire, 1930), Así es la vida (What a Man, 1930), and Alma de gaucho (Soul of a gaucho, 1930). Two, Sombras de gloria and Así es la vida, were versions of English-language films produced at roughly the same time as the Spanish versions, while the rest were original productions intended specifically for Spanish-speaking audiences. These relied on stories set in Spanish-speaking countries. All six used multinational casts: a feature overtly emphasized in Sombras de gloria by listing the nationalities of the cast next to their names in the credit sequence. The actors hailed from ten different nations.34 One, Charros, gauchos y manolas, had scenes set in Mexico, Argentina, and Spain, with actors from each of these countries in the appropriate roles. As its title suggests by referring to Mexican cowboys (charros) and Argentine horsemen (gauchos) and to “typically” Spanish women (manolas), this film overtly sought to appeal to the major markets for Spanish-language films and relied\n\nFIGURE 5 December 1929 advertisement for what is billed as “the first film spoken in Spanish ever to be shown in the world.” While short films in Spanish had been released prior to this, Sombras habaneras (Havana shadows) was the first feature. Collection of Robert Dickson.\n\nTHE RISE OF SPANISH-LANGUAGE FILMMAKING\n\n30\n\nheavily on the folkloric customs and music of the three countries. Alma de gaucho, set in Argentina, was made in Spanish, but its producers also made a version dubbed into Italian to which they added a written prefatory title that dedicated it to “Italians in Italy and outside.”35 Like so many Argentines, the film’s writer, composer, and star, Benjamín Ingénito Paralupi (who also worked under the names Manuel Granado and Paul Ellis), had Italian roots. Such strategies demonstrate the uncertainty of the extent and makeup of the market for films made in Spanish. With the exceptions of Sombras de gloria and Así es la vida, none of these early Spanish features seem to have succeeded at the box office. All drew criticism: reviewers described most as amateurish, unconvincing, and even painful to watch. According to film magazines of the time, they suffered from poor production values, particularly their sound, and uneven acting. In an anticipation of a complaint that would dog Spanish-language films made in the United States throughout the 1930s, one critic took Sombras habaneras to task for its awkward dialogue. “I seemed to be listening to a group of Yankee tourists who had barely learned Spanish in twenty lessons. . . . [T]he worst was that despite being the work of hispanos a dialogue full of Americanisms was used which will sound like a foreign language to our people.” The only redeeming quality of Charros, gauchos y manolas was some of its music, according to one writer. Of these films, Sombras de gloria stood out, particularly for the performance of its star, José Bohr.36 This film’s reviewer did not rate it a total success, but rather a first “serious attempt” that produced somewhat mediocre results. He put his review squarely in the context of the “new and unexplored route of talking pictures, in our language.” He recognized the difficulties that producers faced and noted that one could praise the films simply for the sake of the effort and money put into them. He insisted, however, that any thinking audience should demand films in Spanish equal in quality to those made in English.37 The comments of this perceptive reviewer aptly describe the risks of making films intended for a newly defined language market that still consisted of discriminating filmgoers who had long experience with Hollywood and international cinema. Although these early independent films did not succeed at the box office or convince observers of the industry that Spanish-language films could successfully be made in the United States, they merit attention for another reason: their personnel. The cast and crew of these feature films, along with the early experimental shorts, included quite a few of the actors who would play leading roles in numerous Spanish-language versions made by Hollywood. Several of the key figures behind the production of these films helped to shape Spanish-language filmmaking, despite the poor reception of their first sound film efforts. Brief biographical sketches of René Cardona, producer and star of Sombras habaneras, and of Arcady Boytler, star of Sombra vengadora, suggest some of the links between the transition to sound period and later developments. Like José Bohr, Cardona\n\nFIRST RESPONSES TO THE CHALLENGE OF SOUND, 1929–1930\n\n31\n\nand Boytler parlayed formative experiences on these first features made in the United States into significant and influential careers in the Mexican film industry, although, like Bohr, neither was originally from Mexico. As we shall see in later chapters, their careers were also typical of those of numerous others who would use the knowledge and connections gained from the relatively brief period when Hollywood made movies in Spanish to help build substantial sound film industries elsewhere in the Spanish-speaking world.\n\nCosmopolitan Careers By the time of his death, René Cardona (b. 1905, Havana; d. 1988, Mexico City) had directed over 140 films, acted in and produced many others, and begun a Mexican filmmaking dynasty as his son and grandson of the same name also became prolific directors. Yet he got his start in the United States, where he would write, produce, and star in the first-ever commercially exhibited, featurelength film in the Spanish language. Cardona’s family had left Cuba during the 1920s for political reasons. Cardona found work in the U.S. film industry as a secondary actor and technical assistant for a few silent films. He appeared in a very early (1926) Spanish-language short film made by the Fox-Case Corporation before rushing to produce Sombras habaneras in 1929 at the independent Tec-Art Studio in Hollywood. It featured, in addition to Cardona in the lead, two actors who would appear in numerous Hollywood Spanish-language films: Juan Torena and Paul Ellis. Both Ellis and Torena had some experience playing bit parts in silent films in the late 1920s. However, Ellis had a leading role in an unusual silent film, Una nueva y gloriosa nación (The Charge of the Gauchos, 1927). An Argentine producer had hoped to interest a major American studio in the project (a historical drama about Argentine independence) but ultimately produced it independently.38 Ellis costarred in this film with Jacqueline Logan, who had been featured in numerous silent films of the 1920s. It is possible that Ellis may have convinced Logan to star in Cardona’s Sombras habaneras. Presumably, they hoped Logan’s fame would aid the picture, but the fact that her voice had to be dubbed into Spanish did not help the film’s reception. Cardona at first fell back on acting after his experience with Sombras habaneras and landed roles in three Hollywood Spanish-language films made by major studios. He alternated work in film with work in the theatrical touring company of Ernesto Vilches, a well-known theater star who participated in several Hollywood Spanish-version films. Cardona traveled to Mexico with this company and apparently became convinced that this was where the future of Spanish-language filmmaking lay. In his third film in Hollywood, the 1931 Carne de cabaret (Ten Cents a Dance), Cardona costarred with Ramón Pereda (a Spaniard whose family emigrated to Mexico during his childhood), Lupita Tovar, and Carmen Guerrero. Both women would later go on to make early\n\n32\n\nTHE RISE OF SPANISH-LANGUAGE FILMMAKING\n\nsound films in Mexico, and Guerrero became a major star there. Pereda, on the other hand, continued to star in Spanish-language films throughout the 1930s even as he developed a career in the Mexican sound cinema. He had married one of Cardona’s fellow actresses in Vilches’s theatrical troupe, Adriana Lamar, who would star in the first film of many that Pereda would produce, write, and direct in Mexico.39 Cardona at first worked principally as an actor in the Mexican cinema through 1937, when he began direct his own films, with much greater success than he had with his first effort. He played a key role in pioneering the early Mexican sound cinema, in part because he could draw upon both connections and fame acquired through experience in Hollywood. Arcady Boytler Rososky (b. 1893, Moscow; d. 1965, Mexico City) took an even longer route to Mexico than did Cardona, but had no doubt that Mexico could replace Hollywood as a center for Spanish-language filmmaking. This peripatetic Russian who had fled his homeland after the 1917 Revolution had worked in the theater and silent cinema in Europe and South America before arriving in the United States in 1928. In his early comic films, made in Europe, he riffed on the internationally popular Charlie Chaplin movies.40 In Argentina, he worked as a theater director for three years. He also made a silent feature in Chile and put together a vaudeville act that he took to Peru before emigrating to the United States. Although Boytler tried to get work with Paramount and other studios in their new Spanish-language initiatives, he could not. He ultimately found work with a newly formed independent company, Empire Productions, that planned to make films for the Spanish-language market. This company, formed by businessmen from the United States and Mexico with experience in the film industry, made a series of twelve films in 1929, which were distributed in the United States, Mexico, and Argentina, before moving their operations to Mexico in 1930. They employed actors from Peru, Mexico, Argentina, Cuba, Chile, and Spain. Boytler directed and acted in several of them, including Sombra vengadora, which the company billed as the first-ever Spanish-language dramatic film.41 Spaniard Fortunio Bonanova also appeared in the Empire shorts with Boytler. Bonanova later became a staple in both Spanish-language productions of the 1930s and English-language films and television, through the early 1960s. He invariably played small parts as a “foreign” (usually Latin) character— most notably in Citizen Kane as the unhappy opera instructor of Mrs. Kane.42 Bonanova also produced and starred in the final feature-length Spanish-language film made in Hollywood in the 1930s, La inmaculada (The immaculate, 1939). Unlike Bonanova, Boytler soon moved on to Mexico, perhaps following his compatriot Sergei Eisenstein, who had left Hollywood without completing a planned studio film and would film material for ¡Que viva Mexico! in 1931 and 1932. Boytler has a small cameo in one of Eisenstein’s sequences. He then stayed on in Mexico and became a key figure in its early sound cinema.43 Boytler made just seven features in Mexico before devoting himself fully to running\n\nFIRST RESPONSES TO THE CHALLENGE OF SOUND, 1929–1930\n\n33\n\nmovie theaters in Mexico City. However, his career stands out for having made one of the classics of the early Mexican sound cinema, the 1933 La mujer del puerto (The Woman of the Port), and for promoting the careers of several future stars. Boytler demonstrated his prescience in understanding Mexico’s potential as a competitor for the vast Spanish-speaking film market. Boytler insisted that the success of Mexican films depended on their ability to appeal to audiences outside of Mexico. Shortly before beginning production on L"
