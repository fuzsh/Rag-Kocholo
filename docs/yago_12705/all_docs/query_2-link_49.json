        "text": "Golden Gate Bridge (Image from Microsoft clip art)\n\nThe Golden Gate bridge turned 75 years old last week and the city of San Francisco celebrated this event in a big way with a Historic Watercraft Parade, dance, music and local bands performing at Marina Green and Crissy Field, and a host of other activities culminating in a spectacular display of fireworks.\n\nI remember when I first saw the Golden Gate bridge decades ago and how disappointed I was then to see that the bridge wasn't really golden at all but a strange orangey color. In fact, it is painted in the International Orange hue. I didn't understand why they called it Golden Gate then but after many years, I learned to appreciate the bridge as it is.\n\nSuspension Bridge, Bohol\n\nWhile I'm on the topic of bridges, I found this photo of a suspension bridge over the Loboc River from our trip to Bohol a few years back. It was scary to try to cross this narrow hanging bridge. It swayed quite a bit when I tried to walk a few feet across and I couldn't seem to keep my balance. But surefooted locals had no qualms forging the bridge in no time.\n\nDrawbridge over the Amstel River, Amsterdam\n\nMethinks there's a little bit of affinity between a hanging bridge and a drawbridge. When the drawbridge is raised, it's hanging for a time till it's lowered back to position. It's always fascinating to watch a drawbridge being raised to allow watercraft to pass through. This happens quite a bit in Amsterdam with its myriad waterways.\n\nPuente de la Mujer, Buenos Aires\n\nThe Puente de la Mujer or Woman's Bridge is a footbridge in the Puerto Madero district in Buenos Aires. It is designed by the famous Spanish architect, Santiago Calatrava, who has made similar, aesthetically captivating bridges around the world. The Puente de la Mujer is like a harp and as such, plays beautiful music to our senses.\n\nPonte Vecchio, Firenze\n\nThe Ponte Vecchio or Old Bridge has been here since the Roman Empire. It was destroyed by flood in 1333 and rebuilt in 1345. It can be crowded on the bridge most times but I enjoy window shopping here where beautiful, expensive jewelry call my name. Someday, I whisper back!\n\nSpeaking of old bridges, I must mention the Ponte dei Sospiri or Bridge of Sighs in Venice. It connects the Doge's Palace and the prison where, according to legend, convicts or enemies of state were led to their sad fate. Hence, sighs! There's also another legend that's more upbeat and romantic. It says that lovers will live happily ever after if they kiss inside a gondola gliding under the bridge at sunset. No less?\n\nView from Charles Bridge, Prague\n\nTwo bridges worth mentioning are Charles Bridge in Prague and Pont Saint Bénezet in Avignon, France. Charles Bridge has the best views of Hradcany Castle and lots of statues of saints to protect you along the way. The Pont Saint Bénezet spans less than half the Rhone river after it was repeatedly destroyed by floods since its construction between 1171 and 1185. It's quite a sight to behold.\n\nAnd one more bridge I love is Monet's Japanese bridge in his garden in Giverny. Someday I hope to replicate it in my own waterlogged garden. What a dream!\n\n* * *\n\nImages by Charie except as otherwise indicated\n\nLabels\n\nPre-colonial period Pag-unlad ng Panggagamot sa Pilipinas (The Progress of Medicine in the Philippines) is a group of four large-scale paintings depicting healing practices in the Philippines from pre-colonial times to the modern period. Carlos Botong Francisco was commissioned in 1953 by Dr. Agerico Sison who was then the director of Philippine General Hospital (PGH) together with Dr. Eduardo Quisumbing of the National Museum, Dr. Florentino Herrera, Jr. and Dr. Constantino Manahan. These oil on canvas paintings measure 2.92 meters in height and 2.76 meters in width (9.71 ft x 8.92 ft) and were displayed at the main entrance hall of PGH for over five decades. Owing to its location, the artworks were in a state of \"severe deterioration\" at the beginning of the 21st century from exposure to heat, humidity, dirt, dust, smoke, insect stains, grime, termites and an oxidized synthetic resin used in an earlier restoration. These canvases were restored three times, the last was\n\nIn 1968, Antonio Villegas (then Mayor of Manila), commissioned Carlos \"Botong\" Francisco to paint the history of Manila for Manila City Hall. The series of large scale paintings was called Kasaysayan ng Maynila (History of Manila). The paintings deteriorated over time and no attempt was made to preserve these historical canvases until 2013 when Mayor Amado Lim sent them to the National Museum for extensive restoration. Four years later, in 2017, Mayor Joseph Ejercito Estrada and the Manila City Council signed an agreement with the National Museum to leave the paintings at the museum so they may reach a larger audience in exchange for museum grade reproductions to replace the originals. Kasaysayan ng Maynila was later renamed Filipino Struggles in History and is now on display at the Senate Hall of the National Museum . Carlos \"Botong\" Francisco died in March 1969, a few months after completing the paintings. He is one of the first Filipino modernists and\n\nLizares Mansion The province of Iloilo on the island of Panay has a rich trove of heritage houses, left over from the sugar industry boom in the 19th century. Iloilo also had the largest port in the Philippines at that time which facilitated the export of sugar to foreign shores and deposited money in the hands of the sugar barons. The barons dropped their earnings into the acquisition of properties in Negros and the construction of beautiful homes in Iloilo, many of which are located in the vicinity of the Jaro Cathedral. The Lizares Mansion was built in 1937 by Don Emiliano Lizares for his wife, Concepcion Gamboa and five children. The family fled to safety when World War II broke out and the house was occupied by the Japanese military. The family returned to the house after the war but left once again after the demise of Don Emiliano. It was sold to the Dominican order in the 1960s and was converted in 1978 to a private school, Angelicum School. The mansion now houses the"
