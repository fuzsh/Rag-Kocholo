        "text": "Up until now each style of Commedia has had happy endings. Not Opera Regia. In fact, in most cases the Opera Regia style of Commedia ends in a massacre, the stage littered with dead bodies, severed limbs and lots and lots of blood. I know right? Awesome! In terms of Characters, Opera Regia is very similar to the Pastorale, with The Cyclops, and Nymphs being the exceptions. Unlike the Pastorale, Opera Regia is not set in lush forests or rolling green hills with fluffy balls of sheep loafing around. No, the stories of Opera Regia take place within the cold hard walls of a huge and shadowy castle. In a Kingdom with a strange air of unease, we find characters such as Pantalone, Dottore and the Capitano on the royal council. Zanni scurry around the dank chambers on errands for their masters, while the members of the royal family plot against one another. Here we meet a similar King and Queen as in the Pastorale but with a few specific differences. A lust for power, suspicion, paranoia and at times a perverse taste for torture are character traits of these monarchs. The lovers are also present, this time not as Shepherd’s who are hard of hearing or possessing a limp, but rather strong, healthy and proud prince and princess.\n\nNow there is one character we are yet to meet, one who is solely present within the world of Opera Regia. The King and Queen had another child after their first born…\n\nImage: Patrick as Biffidus\n\nUsually Called Biffidus, this character not only does not possess the same good looks as their older sibling, but is horribly grotesque. Usually physical ailments include a limp, Hunchback, lisp, and generally just very ugly. In Commedia, the outside of a character is indicative of their nature. The good looking characters are pure and good themselves, while the Ugly and grotesque…\n\nImage: Biffidus being possessed by dark thoughts\n\nOften neglected by their parents, feared and ignored by their peers and people alike, the ‘Monster’ character develops a deep hatred for those around him. Especially towards their sibling, who has it all, good looks, the girl, birthright to the throne…things which give birth to a passionate and deadly jealously within Biffidus, often setting in motion the inevitable massacre.\n\nImage: A royal family portrait with the King, Queen, Flavio and Biffidus\n\nImage: Biffidus cast down by his parent from the family photo\n\nIn the world of Opera Regia, even fundamentally good characters like the lovers can be manipulated and driven to perform horrendous acts of violence and cruelty. It is here that another element to the lover’s portrayal was taught us by Antonio: The Madness. The worst thing for either Flavio or Isabella is when their love is with another. It is worse than their love being dead, the very thought of them sharing their love with another can drive the abandoned lover to madness. Even if it is not certain, nor proof provided, the imagination of the lovers gets the best of them and they spiral downwards into a world of darkness and despair. They revert to a childlike and crazed existence, drawing upon the popular cultural idea of madness being associated with the world upside down. Walking on hands, Crying when happy, fish flying, birds swimming and an ox whipping a man who pulls the tiller…. But even if mad, the Master is still a Master and so the servants must do whatever they ask. This often leads to hilarious and strange results. We spent part of one day on an exercise where a Zanni was to babysit a mad lover in their bedroom. He had to do what the lover asked and not do it at the same time…it was very funny, but also quite sad and moving.\n\nThe Madness is also a pretext to turn the lovers, Kings and queens from beautiful to comic. This is as they cannot be funny in their normal condition of perfection, as perfection in Commedia is not comic. But when mad, they’re no longer perfect and the possibility to be comic arises. Historically actors in a company would play the same character their entire lives. So a good way for an actor to find more variety in the character of the lover was to play around with the affectation of madness. Now madness does also exist in the comic, however there it exists as a mistake. As I mentioned before about the lovers being very imaginative, they may ‘think’ their lover is betrothed to someone else as a servant has given the wrong information leading to comic situations. In the Tragedy it is not a mistake, but rather something terrible bringing with it the will for the destruction of all. Thus we have our inevitable Opera Regia Massacre. The only case for them to revert to their normal state is if their lover comes back to them, and even then the characters may still have a few lasting effects of the madness.\n\nImage: Flavio exacting revenge on his evil mother\n\nBut now for the real fun part: the special effects. I think that it is the special effects that make Opera Regia so different and so appealing, at least to me in particular. Fake blood is used when a character is cut, killed or attacked. In the beginning of this Epoch the actors would use animal blood, but now we use tomato.\n\n“…In this way we are vegetarian”, Antonio said to us with a smile. “So if you are a character who is being stabbed, you prepare a bag of crushed tomatoes and sauce and manipulate it to explode or be pierced upon the point of contact. But blood is just the beginning!!!” *starts laughing manically*\n\nYou can have decapitated body parts, eye gouging, teeth pulling, and any other grotesque form of bodily harm you can think of. Of course everything is fake, just for the kids at home…don’t try it ;) Really, you are only limited by your imagination. I was told by a friend that a previous group in the stage poured bucket’s of blood on one another, ripped fetus’ out of pregnant characters, and much more. Antonio shared with us once the tale of one particular Opera Regia where the king discovered his wife the queen had lover. He invited her to a banquet soon after, with a massive table full of delicious dishes with one shinning silver platter in the middle. He removed the lid to expose the severed head of her lover. The queen begins screaming hysterically, as the king proceeds to cut open the head and eat some brain. He then stuffs some into the queens mouth, pushing her over the edge into madness. Antonio told us that the actors had prepared a fake head and crushed grapes for the brain…so very cool :D\n\nApart from the kings and queens, lovers and now Biffidus, new unmasked characters now emerge into the action. They are used for one purpose only: to be killed. The reasoning behind this is that none of the masked characters can die. This does not mean they are immortal, but rather that historically a masked character belongs to the comic and the comic characters do not die. Antonio added to this by saying, “…as they never die, they never kill”. This is why all the killing is done by the unmasked characters, and in particular members of the royal family. But if the Royal family are the only unmasked characters, that’s only about 5 people max that can die, and that simply is not enough. Thus, the introduction of new and in a sense, ‘sacrificial’ characters is necessary. Possessing no particular gesture or important role in the intrigue, these characters fill the roles of servants, guards, soldiers, peasants and other any minor supporting role.\n\nImage: Myself as a peasant who has journey through the sewers to seek an audience with the queen.\n\nThese poor doomed souls are often executed in a myriad of different ways, all depending on the creativity of the cast. Here I was playing an unmasked peasant character. His house had just burnt down, and with it the lives of his wife and child. Parched and close to death he sought an audience with the queen, with the sole request for water. The Queen however saw him much the same as a cat would a mouse.\n\nImage: The Queen Torturing a subject who has begged her for water\n\nFirst she played with him, holding water just out of his arms length, sprinkling it on the floor before him. Finally she gave it to him and as he was about to drink from it she broke his neck. Antonio taught us a simple technique to create a suitable noise for this special effect. Take one empty plastic bottle, remove the lid and scrunch it in time with the neck twist. Works like a charm J. Her Highness also tortured some of the masked characters, like Arrlechinno and Tonya. At one point she was particularly enraged and called for the royal ‘stress ball’, which of course was a cute little kitten. She proceeded to break its neck and felt instantly much better.\n\nImage: The Queen about to break the kittens little neck & Punishing Arrlechinno by crushing his toes\n\nBut the Queen was not the only sinister monarch in this play. The King also had a sick and twisted mind which he entertained by ‘troubling’ his female servants.\n\nImage: the perverse King playing with Tonya a female servant\n\nLater in the play, as Biffidus began to weave his web of revenge, the bodies started to drop one by one. Towards the end (and please be warned the following events are not at all pleasant) the massacre was set in motion. The Queen, lusting after her own son, desired to rid herself of his pesky little fiancé Isabella. But first she planned to kill her husband the king with a poison. However, rather than kill him, the poison (made by the Zanni servants) transformed the king into a crazed, drooling sexual deviant. Not missing an opportunity such as this, The Queen set him on Isabella, whom he proceeded to have against her will. To create the effect for this we had The King order two Zanni to hold two large flats, which you see in the photo above, in front of the place where the he was on top of Isabella. The two actors, hidden from the audience then made all the horrible noises one might imagine from such a situation while they covered Isabella with fake blood in the appropriate places. When the flats were removed the effect on the audience was achieved.\n\nImage: Isabella after the King was done\n\nThe queen visited Isabella in the aftermath with the false pretense of helping her, only to pull out one of her eyes. We used a quail egg with a white dot drawn it for a pupil. Although we did not boil it, which Antonio suggested was the usual and more effective choice. That would have then left it open to be eaten by the eye gouger, squished in the palm of their hand or underfoot. However when the queen squished the egg, the yolk went everywhere which also was quite unnerving.\n\nImage: The Queen holding the eye she just took from Isabella\n\nFlavio returned later to see his bride-to-be dancing dangerously on the top of a tall tower. Isabella had gone mad. He called out to her but she was too far gone and jumped to her death. This in turn set Flavio over the edge and he continued to kill his mother by smashing her head against the wall, murder The King’s guards and rip the heart of his father out and eat it. We prepared small plastic bags of tomato sauce mixed in with actual diced and almost puréed tomatoes for each character who died.\n\nImage: myself as a guard fallen victim to Flavio’s revenge\n\nImage: Flavio eating the heart of his father.\n\nAfter he ate part of the heart, Flavio threw it at a wall, and left though the audience humming a nursery rhyme. We had prepared a skinned capsicum filled with fake blood so it would explode upon impact…also very cool J although some of it may have sprayed the people in the front row. Good thing it was tomato and not Pigs blood like in the old days ;)\n\nOpera Regia, is really spectacular. I find there is something enthralling about seeing exaggerated blood, body parts and brutality on stage. Of course the audience is aware at all times it is an illusion and find themselves cringing but smiling at the same time. Or at other points laughing when someone goes offstage to die and a bucket of blood is thrown back onstage to signify the deed is done. It’s all a lot of fun really :D\n\nI plan to use this style a lot back in Australia with the guys, so I’m sure you’ll get the chance to see some if you wish. Well, sadly next blog may be the last as it is the final part of the course. Titled ‘The comic Individual’, I believe it is about the evolution of Commedia into modern comic characters…but we shall see!\n\nCiao,\n\nNick\n\nI started today much the same as I usually do. Woke up, got out of bed, dragged a comb across my head - no, sorry…that’s a Beatles song. But while we are on the topic of insects, I have not seen many large spiders here in Italy. Maybe that’s why there are so many mosquitoes…hmmm. So anyway, after I got to the theatre, I checked my email very quickly and then started to warm up. While I was in downward dog (yoga position), I noticed 3 new masks on a nearby bench. Masks with Horns. At this point, I skipped the child position, went straight to saluting the sun so I could acquaint myself with these new faces. As I was admiring them, Antonio walked by and asked me to try one on. The one I picked is different to all the other Commedia masks I’ve worn thus far, as it had a chin. There was a large gaping smile for the actor to speak out of, but otherwise it was almost a full face mask.\n\nI took it off and sat down with the rest of my friends in front of Antonio. He placed a bench in front of us, sat on it next to a suspiciously large black bag and began to introduce us to the Pastorale. I really like it when we have these moments. Antonio will gesture for us to take a seat and then regale tales of Commedia history or an anecdote relating to the work. As we usually sit on the floor and he on a chair, I can’t help but feel overcome with nostalgia as I think back to my primary school days. Days where we would sit cross legged in front of the librarian Mrs. Bannano as she read to us from a story book. I remember being fascinated by her feet. So many cracks. I used to pretend the cracks were like those mazes you find in coloring-in books and try to find the exit.\n\nBut as fascinating as her feet were, they were no competition for what Antonio was sharing with us now. I must mention before I go any further, this is the topic I have been dying to learn about ever since I knew of its existence. Commedia, Mythology, guys with horns… what more do you need? But I will let you decide for yourselves by sharing with you what Antonio shared with me J\n\nThe Pastorale is a genre of Commedia that draws upon popular mythology to mix in with the normal intrigues. Set outside of the normal location of the city, the action takes place in area’s connected to nature, such as a forest, the country, the sea and etc. When this style entered into the lexicon of Commedia it was immediately very successful. Drawing upon the rich wealth of characters and intrigues from Greek mythology, the Pastorale inspired many poets of the time. Interestingly the beginning of the theatre was more or less around the same time as the birth of the Pastorale.\n\nAntonio told us that we would be studying the Pastorale, which is set in a pastoral land, as opposed to the sea or a desert landscape. A world of shepherds and sheep, the Pastorale enchants audiences with a mix of characters from the city and the inhabitants of the beautiful poetic landscape in which it is set. The Shepherds are not exactly new characters, but rather adapted ones. For example Flavio is usually a shepherd boy, using all the gestures of the usual lovers but with something not working. For instance, he may have a slight limp. The lovers can have crowns in this style, as their parents are often the Kings and Queens of the land, but more on that later.\n\nPhoto: Olivier as the shepherd boy Flavio\n\nThe Shepherd loves his flock of sheep. However, the sheep are not exactly sheep.\n\nMeet The Satiri. Also known as Satyrs, these are horned creatures that have two main functions in the drama. Firstly, they can be an active symbol of nature. In this way, a Satiri may represent an element such as rain or wind, or even an earthquake in a scene. In this case The Satiri are invisible to all of the normal city characters. An example of this could be that Isabella is writing a letter to her love the Sheppard boy Leandro in the other kingdom. A nearby Satyr will pass wind (fart), and the letter will float across the border into the hands of her love. They can also be inanimate objects such as a tree, rock or mound of earth. The Satiri also have the ability to create love or hate, although it is not in their intention.\n\nThese horned beings are creatures of the forest, slaves to their primitive desires of eating, sleeping and…reproducing. So naturally when a human enters into their domain, a creature they have not seen before, they find them fascinating. They will often try to mimic what they see the humans do, but never quite getting it right. This usually leads to rather comic situations.\n\nThe second role of The Satyr is a character in the story. They can be one of The Shepherd’s sheep or a goat as mentioned earlier. As more human-like characters The Satiri can represent masculinity, be savage, violent, but always operating solely on instinct. When they see any female character they can be overcome with a sexual desire and try to kidnap them. The Satyr can be a terrible rival for Flavio in the pursuit of Isabella’s love. A Classic story line following this intrigue is that the shepherd boy Flavio falls in love with a Nymph of the forest. But a Satyr has his eyes on her as well, and so ensures a battle for her hand.\n\nPhoto: Satiri about to capture Isabella\n\nPhoto: myself as a sexually deranged Gran Coruntello (name of the mask with massive horns)\n\nPhoto: Boss Satyr forcing Isabella to marry him\n\nThis brings me to another new character, the Nymph. Representing femininity, elements such as water, a soothing breeze, beautiful plants and trees, the Nymphs are really the other side of the coin to The Satiri.\n\nPhoto: Nymphs who have spotted Flavio\n\nContent to simply frolic in the woods, pick flowers and sing songs, the Nymphs are very happy creatures. Satiri will try to capture the Nymphs if they see them. Actually now that I think about it, a good example of this is ‘Banana’s in Pajamas’, where the teddy bears are the nymphs and of course the Satiri are the Bananas J …wow, second time I have reminisced about a much smaller me…they were simpler times. My most difficult daily tasks were tying my shoes and deciding which color Power Ranger I wanted to be…sigh.\n\nPhoto: Satiri attempting to capture some Nymphs\n\nAnyway, as Characters in the intrigue, Nymphs will often be very attracted to Flavio. If Flavio enters the woods on a hunting trip, they will fight amongst themselves to be closest to him.\n\nAnother type of female character that also come across Flavio when he enters the woods to hunt or for any other purpose are the Amazons. A group of powerful and militaristic women, the Amazons are unaware of the existence of men. Very physically adept and skilled in the art of war, the Amazons spend their time training and living in seclusion from the world of man. So when Flavio enters their domain, at first they are suspicious, but after watching his skill with the bow, or his general good looks, they fall for him like the Nymphs.\n\nPhoto: Amazon’s mid war cry\n\nThe parents of the lovers can be one of the Vecchio such as Pantalone or Dottore, but it is more common for a new character to take this role. The ‘Kings’ or ‘Queens’ in this Pastorale land are thus introduced. Not necessarily Royal in the sense of having huge castles or crowns, but rather in responsibility. They are the head of their clan or people, and often a Shepherd themselves. Physically they are like the Lovers but aged. More upright and without their head in the clouds like their children, The King and Queen usually are not married but rather govern separate kingdoms. This provides good opportunities for intrigue when the son of the Kingdom of Goats falls in love with the daughter of the Kingdom of Sheep. In fact one of our canovaccio was centered around this very storyline with quite hilarious results.\n\nImages: Flag of warring the Goat & Sheep kingdoms\n\nI briefly mentioned some of the classic Commedia characters of Dottore and Magnifico earlier, so let us examine their role in the Pastorale. Instead of playing the parents, they will take up the mantle of a minister to either the King or Queen. Here they provide advice on the affairs of the kingdom and other matters.\n\nPhotos: Dottore, Jettatore and Giangurgolo as Ministers to the King\n\nOf course Pantalone is the minister of finance, Capitano the minister of warfare and Dottore politics or economics. The Zanni’s role remains the same - the servants. In whatever style they enter there is always need for servants and so they fill it.\n\nAlso in the Pastoral is where we are introduced to the character of The Mamu.\n\nPhoto: Veronica as a Mamu\n\nThe Mamu is a friend of Isabella and Flavio, of the same age and often completely infatuated with one of them. So much so that he or she cannot communicate properly when she observes their love for each other and comes across as a bit of an idiot. However the Mamu is very intelligent, a sort of unmasked young Dottore who actually does know what he is talking about. Serving also a loyal servant to a king or queen, The Mamu follows the lovers like a puppy dog on their adventures, sometimes rescuing them if they are in trouble. We made one particular canovaccio where a female Cyclops took a shine to a male Mamu and took him off into the woods for much ‘SNOO-SNOO’. Entirely loveable, this underdog character has such good intentions that it is almost sad to see him fall in love with Isabella when she is already in love with Flavio.\n\nPhoto: Mamu thinking about her love, Flavio\n\nA final character of the Pastoral that is new to us is the Cyclops!!!\n\nPhoto: Patrick as the Cyclope (female Cyclops)\n\nSporting one massive eye and an equally massive club, The Cyclops is a slow thinking giant, though not necessarily gentle as he enters into the intrigue of the play. Possessing tremendous strength, The Cyclops can enter into the intrigue by rescuing Isabella from a band of perverse Satiri or fill other roles as needed. In one of our Pastorale the Cyclops entered comically as the priest marrying the lovers… From memory his dialogue as he stood before them was “do you? (to Isabella) do you? (to Flavio) GOOD!” as he then he smashed his club on their joined hands.\n\nNext time I will write about the bloody Opera Reggia.\n\nCiao,\n\nNick\n\np.s Here’s a photo of a rare still moment in Commedia J\n\nToday we learnt how to seriously offend the locals. As I mentioned before, all the stereotypes of Italians talking with their hands, being very loud and boisterous, belong to the culture of the South. Since Commedia is a reflection of society, it too possesses these mannerisms and characteristics, only on a much larger scale. So for a good hour today, we stood in a circle and Antonio walked us through all of the common gestualisticts one by one. Later I will explain why it’s a common sight for a superstitious Southerner to touch his testicles when a black cat walks by. Southern Commedia is fantastic. In my experience so far, it has quite a different feel to its Northern counterpart. This is mainly due to geographic and cultural reasons.\n\nHistorically, the Southern Commedia had a similar beginning to the North. During the time of Lent, theatre activities stopped and actors would use their time off to rehearse and devise new plays. However many actors also used this time to travel & swap companies, often in couples. This is due to the binary system I mentioned in an earlier blog, whereby actors playing characters like a first and second Zanni, or a Dottore and Pantalone, stuck together for their entire careers. Antonio mentioned that this time was like a market for the actors. Around the 1600’s during this off-period, some Commedia actors travelled down South to Napoli. However, the locals did not appreciate these Northern Zanni. The Zanni are based on people from the Mountains in Bergamo and the Southerners found their accent to be ugly. So the solution was to adapt this Zanni in Southern style and Pulcinella was born.\n\n[Photo: myself as Pulcinella]\n\nPulcinella is like a Northern second Zanni, but much more relaxed. Like the original servants at the beginning of Commedia, he wears white clothes. Unlike the ‘ino’ characters such as Truffeldino and Arlecchino, instead of having a snub, pushed in nose, he has one of the longest noses in Commedia. Antonio shared with us a sort of Commedia legend about Pulcinella being born from a turkey’s egg. Physically, it works - the mask is very bird-like.\n\nIn terms of movement, Pulcinella shares all the repertoire of the Northern second Zanni. But he has a walk that is very particular to him, where he manipulates every part of his body to avoid physical pain. However, it’s not that he is physically in pain, but rather a state of mind. He is perfectly healthy and able, but as soon as the prospect of having to do work arises, he ‘suddenly’ is in a lot of pain… Antonio in teaching us his walk provided the mental image of having a large hemorrhoid. That or blisters on your feet. Combine both for full effect. Pulcinella is much more content to do nothing, and relax in the sun than the Northern Servants. In the North the Zanni will attempt to solve the problems in the play, which causes more problems. Alternatively in the South Pulcinella will avoid the problems and this causes more problems. So different method, same result.\n\n[Photo: Pulcinella avoiding work]\n\nBut we must not mistake Pulcinella’s behaviour for laziness. Rather, it is philosophic. For example, if he has to dig a hole, he will think ‘Why? Why me? Why dig a hole? What are holes anyway?’ Yes, as Antonio shared with us while smiling, “To waste his time for Pulcinella is a sport.” It’s not that he is lazy, he’s just not interested. What he is interested in is food. He is by far the hungriest of all the Zanni, even more than his Northern cousins. Also, Pulcinella is the character that the puppet Punch from ‘Punch and Judy’ is based on J\n\nI will keep comparing the North to the South throughout this Blog. At least for me, I find comparisons between things can also make for very clear definitions. So without further ado, Northern Commedia is very efficient, seeking results. Whereas the South is very relaxed, seeking pleasure.\n\nPulcinella is also a very important character for Commedia’s continual evolution. Historically, the last experience of Commedia was in the 18th century. But in the South, Pulcinella continued to develop and evolve up until today. In Antonio’s words ‘He is the flame!’ Apart from Pulcinella, We have been introduced to the Southern Characters of: Zezza, Coviello, Giangurgolo, Tartaglia, Fosca, and the Jettatore.\n\nZezza is the female equivalent for Pulcinella, and often his wife or lover. She shares the same repertoire of movement as Pulcinella, but like the other female characters in Commedia, is more moral and intelligent. When she and Pulcinella are in a scene together their relationship is like that of a 1st and 2nd Zanni. Obviously as a female she is the brains of the operation taking the place of 1st Zanni.\n\n[Photo: Tia as Zezza\n\nCoviello is a very funny Character, a sort of mix between Brighella and an Inforinatio (or Pedrolino). He is the typical 1st Zanni to Pulcinella’s second Zanni. An unconscious parody of royalty or upper class, Coviello spends his time communicating with a lisp and swindling others with card games and other gambling scams. A fun fact, he sticks his bum out more than any other Zanni J\n\nThere is also Colafronio, the vecchio Pulcinella. He is the same as Pulcinella, but with more age added to his physicality. Think Magnifico without the money. Colafronio has no shame, or any tact for that matter. So when he meets a stranger he will have no problem asking for money or an item of their clothing. He might even be nonplussed when they decline. A good example is Marie from ‘Everybody Loves Raymond’. Also like Magnifico, he is old when it suits him. So if asked to help out with something, he will complain of a sudden back problem or fain deafness. Giangurgolo is a more relaxed version of the Capitano. He too shares his bravado with anyone who will listen, but is much more content to do it sitting down, or laying on the floor. But unlike the Capitano, he is not forcibly a Captain or sergeant in the army. Here is where we see a real defining feature of Southern Commedia. The characters roles are not so concrete. Antonio told us that each character can change their position or role, just like in a chess game: you can change the function and role of the pieces, but the game is still the same. So in this way, Colafronio can be a 1st Zanni and Giangurgolo or even Pulcinella can be a father of one of the lovers.\n\n[Photo: Jorn & Oliver as Giangurgolo]\n\nTartaglia is a character I had wanted to learn about for a very long time. Tartaglia is a notary, like a mixture of Dottore and Pantalone. Also a Vecchio, but he is often nearsighted and always suffering from an unfortunate but hilarious speech impediment. The name Tartaglia actually means speech impediment. He can also be hard of hearing if the actor desires. I have had a lot of fun with him so far. Antonio provided a fun explanation of some of the Vecchi: Dottore represents the jovialness of old age, Pantalone the old man with one foot in the grave and Tartaglia… both feet in the grave.\n\n[Photo: Alessio as Tartaglia]\n\nThe last two, Fosca and Jettatore, are quite different to the rest. In a sense they are symbols, just as much, if not more than they are characters. Before I go any further it is important to mention that another aspect of Southern Commedia which defines it and sets it apart from its Northern Counterpart is this: Superstition. Not around Commedia itself, but the Characters. Antonio told us one day that, “Commedia is not superstitious as a system, but the characters yes. Alot” This certainly rings true in the South, especially their interactions with the next two characters.\n\nThe first is Fosca. The personification of Death, or commonly known as the grim reaper. But why Fosca? Does it mean death in Italian? No. Fosca is the name of a female character that dies in a famous book. Commedia uses the name Fosca as opposed to al morte, as many Italian actors are superstitious and don’t want to write the word death. Mysterious and dark, Fosca is usually played by a woman for the single reason that in the Latin language ‘Death’ is a feminine word. When death appears in human form he or she is very beautiful, has high stature, and is very serious in the sense that he or she ignores the human culture totally. Antonio encouraged us to imagine death as a person working in a ministry knowing only his or her own job. This means that death does not have a sense of humor and is unable to understand Jokes, or double meanings. This character exists solely for Pulcinella and thus can only be seen by him. Fosca has no real part in the intrigue of the play, but rather its symbology.\n\n[Photo: Fosca and Flavio wearing an endogenous mask]\n\n[Photo: Two Fosca claiming Buffetto]\n\nThe second embodiment of Southern superstition is the Jettatore. The Jettaore is a person with a presence that provokes bad luck. Commonly known as a ‘jinx’, he is not exactly a character of the comedy, but is a character of society. This is due to Southerners being in general quite superstitious. The Jinx is not a bad person, in fact he is pretty innocent. It is simply because he is ugly and serious that all the other characters associate him with bad luck. He himself does not know that he is a jinx. An individual with very strong principals, he uses high language and a certain biblical way of speaking. Instead of saying, “it looks like it might rain”, he would say “it will rain.” Then ‘PSHHHHHHH!’ - a torrent of rain will soak Pulcinella.\n\n[Photo: Jettatore Patrick]\n\nApart from these new characters, most of the Northern characters are still present in this style, such as the Northern servants and the lovers. Well, you have been very good to read this far. It has been a long blog this time so I shall end it here. But before I do, why did the title have cats and Coffee included? Cats for the superstitious element. If one crosses the path of the southern Zanni, they will either wait until several people cross before them (to absorb the bad luck), perform a purification ceremony in that area or touch their testicles to ward off the bad juju. Now Coffee. Before I explain this element, I would like to mention that I am not a coffee drinker (I prefer green tea) but the coffee here is dangerously close to changing this opinion of mine. It is good J Back to commedia…Coffee, as all the Southern characters, Pulcinella in particular, are in constant love story with it. Sometimes it can be the sole motivation for Pulcinella to actually do anything\n\nNext time Satyrs, Cyclops and sheep in the poetical Pastoral!!!\n\nCiao,\n\nNick\n\nCiao, come stai? Today was pretty massive J Having just spent an amazing weekend in London with my lady friend, I arrived home around 2am from Bologna. Despite my adventure I wasn’t very tired, but rather ecstatic. I had about 7 and half hours until I would start the Advanced course of Commedia dell’Arte! Also, I had moved into Jerry’s old room and he had a bigger desk, so it was generally a time of much celebration. As I walked down the corridor to get into bed, I heard the sounds of ‘The Dark Knight’ in my old room. Meet Jorn: a very creative Arts student from Utrecht Holland, a scorpion, my new housemate and fellow red head.\n\n[Photo: Jorn and myself]\n\nI smiled, shrugged off my plane clothes and fell asleep. The next morning, Jorn and I discussed over breakfast how neither of us really knew how to get to the new theatre. The advance course is held at Antonio’s private theatre just outside of the center of Reggio Emilia. We knew the general location, so map in hand we began our quest. To get there we have to walk under a bridge, through a park, by a community center, through a high school, the mines of Moria, a petrol station and then…Via Vigarani. This is a street that I will soon traverse at least 4 times a day. However, before we had even reached the high school, we were terribly lost so we called our perpetual saviour, Dina Buccino. When she appeared in our line of sight…well, I can only describe the feeling as akin to that when Gandalf arrived with the riders of Rohan to save the souls within Helms deep. After she killed the remaining Orakei she led us to Via Vigarani.\n\n[Photo: Via Vagirini]\n\nThe teatro is at the end of the street. As we walked down, I couldn’t help but be charmed by the homely houses on either side. Some quaint cottages, others were tall apartments but with beautiful gardens and lots of green shrubs and ferns. Amongst these ferns under parked cars, emerged the small creatures that patrolled this street each day. One could often see them searching for smaller creatures to devour, a sunny place to stretch out in or a wall to rub themselves on. Yes, we had officially entered cat country. As we neared the end of the street, I head the thunderous noise of metal and steam as a train rattled past. Gandalf… I mean, Dina explained to us that there was a train track quite close to the teatro. In no time at all we were in front of a 2-something meter high iron gate. Beyond it lay a courtyard, half cement and half gravel for Dina’s car. The cement side was parallel with the teatro, and on it sat a raised wooden pew, a few chairs, a bench and a table with a leather top. Upon closer inspection I saw that the leather table had been made by Antonio, as it bore the same FAVA logo found on the inside of his masks and Battocio.\n\n[Photo: Antonio’s Teatro]\n\nWe entered the door, to a small room that I immediately recognized as an office of sorts. There were a few book cases each full of small treasures the like of books, masks and props. A fridge sat in one corner, next to a coffee machine and small table. On the other side of the room was a desk with a computer, pens and calendar. I imagine that it must have been where Dina sat when she called me for the first time about the course J… I then walked through into the next room. Here the smile that had grown from the moment I woke up, stretched off my face like Clayman from ‘The Neverhood’. Immediately to my left was one of Antonio’s mask-making stations. It was littered with half made masks, strange tools and fantastic matrixes. I remember in the first course Antonio spent a session explaining to us about mask making. He mentioned that he himself had to invent many of the tools to create his masks.\n\n[Photo: Gateway to Commedia]\n\n[Photo: Where’s Jorn]\n\nThe next thing that caught my eye were some of the masks near his workshop. There were incredible! So many I had never seen before. Some so big they completely covered your head, reminding me of the ones the Ancient Greeks used, made with a gramophone or sorts to project sound. Others boasted thick tufts of hair, some horns. I even saw one with a few gnarled but real teeth protruding from its top lip. It was official, I had discovered Kubla Kahn. After I dragged myself away from these wonders (which was hard, may I add) and I looked upon the rest of the teatro: White walls, and a wooden floor. Antonio would later explain that he preferred playing on a wooden floor as opposed to cement and rubber. At the end of the teatro I saw a black curtain, with 6 slits for characters to exit and enter the space. Above this curtain were two windows. It was at this point I realized there was yet another room to explore in this theatrical playground. Excitedly I walked to the end of the theatre and passed through one of the black slits in the curtain.\n\nHere I was surprised to see a few rooms. I had entered a very small room with a cupboard, a mirror and a chair with a random assortment of props. I passed through a door to see two bathrooms. I looked to my right and saw a corrugated iron spiral staircase. At this point the smile on my face grew to almost touch the walls either side of me. I raced up the staircase to find myself in another wooden floored room. It is a small room, but really the perfect size to rehearse Commedia in. Antonio always says, that the space used and covered by the characters is small, but the action and intention is spectacular. The room itself was rather bare. Within it were two wooden benches, a flat for characters to enter or exit behind and a wooden chair. It were the windows that interested me. I walked over to one, opened the glass door and looked out to see a raised view of the teatro. It really is a beautiful space. I was overcome by a giddy sensation when the thought that I would get to play here for the next two months appeared in my mind. I was still happily musing over this thought when Antonio walked in, and the time came to start our first day J\n\nAfter I almost slid down the spiral staircase, grabbed my pen and pad, and sat by Antonio with the rest of my friends as he told us what we would be covering in the course. We were to start with Northern Commedia for two weeks. For some of us it would be a sort of revision, I thought to myself. Then we would spend two weeks on Southern Commedia, followed by a public show of the North and South. I could not wait to learn about Pulcinella, especially after seeing Antonio perform in his Pulcinellazza.\n\n(Photo: Pulcinella)\n\nNext was a week of the Pastoral. When I heard what we were to cover in this week, I almost could not contain my excitement. My dad is an ancient history teacher, so I have grown up with the tales of Greek myths and legends like they were my nursery Rhymes. I love all mythology but the Greek mythology holds a special place in my heart. The pastorale is especially poetic. Set in a land of green fields, sheep, satyrs, Cyclops and nymphs. It is a poetical land of beauty and natural wonder. He briefly mentioned that there are different types of Pastorale depending on their location, such as in the kingdom, the forest or at sea. So the potential to even have character’s who are Gods like Poseidon, becomes possible.\n\nAfter the Pastorale we would spend a week on Opera Regia. Another thing I had been looking forward to ever since I saw some of the incredible photos on Antonio’s website: people pulling out hearts of tomato and biting them, blood exploding everywhere, decapitation…truly awesome. Opera Regia literally means theatrical work with kings and queens. The ‘special effects’ the actors invent to show these grotesque attacks Animal blood was often used. Of course that was a few centuries ago. “Today”, as Antonio told us “we use tomatoes, in that sense we are vegetarians”. He also said that after this segment in the course each year they have to repaint the walls…\n\nOnce we finish being bloody, next up is the Gabrielliana: the same proposal to do a big show with a lot of characters, but individually. You still put the audience in a condition to follow the story like a normal show or company would. Antonio commented that here the rules change almost to the opposite of the northern and southern commedia. Normally you are not allowed to touch the mask when playing, but With the Gabrielliana, you must touch the mask.\n\nLastly, we cover the ‘comic individual’. Perhaps this is the segment which most intrigues me. Here we invent our own character. Modern, comic and ambiguous. By the end of this phase we will have something that, as Antonio put it, is not commedia but a modern continuity born of it. Well, now I must go prepare dinner, for Shelob hungers. When next we meet, I will have finished the Northern Commedia in the Advanced Course J\n\nCiao,\n\nNick\n\nI have just had my final canovacci for the International Course in Commedia dell’ Arte. Each day is so jam-packed with Commedia and other Italian adventures that by the time I get home I fall straight asleep. The days have continued following the same structure of the first week of the course. I have prepared and performed 10 different canovaccio, visited Florence, learned an incredible amount more about Commedia’s history and conventions and been introduced to some characters I have never properly met.\n\nThe canovacci are one of the best elements of the course. Canovaccio literally means ‘public performance’ in Italian. As I mentioned last week, when it is my group’s turn for a canovaccio we all sit quietly in front of Antonio and listen to his explanation of the scenario. He hands us all a copy of a canovaccio that he has written himself, talks us through what happens and things we need to include. For example, we need to have certain characters, number of actors, and follow each plot point on the sheet provided.\n\nYet, as Antonio has told us, the way we get to those plot points is entirely up to us. For example if the plot dictates that Flavio, one of the lovers, sends a Zanni with a letter to his love, we must include this in our performance. However, the journey of the note is completely up to us. We may decide that in the process of getting to the other lover Isabella, the letter is dropped. It is picked up by Pantalone who uses it to polish his coins, finds its way to Dottore who then rolls it into a ball to assist in a demonstration of how the meteoroid caused the end of the dinosaurs. Dottore then takes his lecture back home to share with his daughter Isabella. During the lecture, as her father has asked her to help with the demonstration, she grabs the meteoroid and discovers it is a note from Flavio.\n\nOnce Antonio has finished his explanation, we divide ourselves into small groups, find a space to rehearse and spend the next 3 hours creating our canovaccio. It is here that I have encountered one of the core ingredients of commedia: the different languages. Commedia is a form of theatre where all the characters have different origins. Specifically each one hails from a different place in Italy. Il Dottore comes from Bologna, a city boasting the oldest and some of the most prestigious universities in the world, the Zanni from Bergamo, Pantalone is venetian, modeled off stereotypes of money hungry Jewish capitalists and Capitano as the Foreigner is usually from Spain. Consequently, they all speak a different dialect of Italian and in Capitano’s case, an entirely different language. In this way when commedia troupes travelled they could always appeal to each audience.\n\nNow unsurprisingly as the course has international appeal, the students are from all around the world. So each week for canovaccio I am grouped with friends who speak German, French, Spanish, Turkish or Italian. Not to mention the specific Italian dialects like Neapolitan or Roman. Thus, like it or not, each canovaccio has that special commedia ingredient of linguistic diversity. Consequently my Italian has improved exponentially. For each of the canovaccio I have played a different character and woven some Italian words into my dialogue so the audience, if non-English speaking, can follow.\n\nI try to play a different character in each canovaccio, despite how nerve-racking it can be. So far I have played, Dottore, Flavio, a second Zanni, Capitano and a character new to myself, Pedrolino. Pedrolino belongs to the Inforinato group in commedia, also known as the 1st Zanni. Other characters belonging to this group are Brighella and Servetta. The first Zanni, as the name suggests are still servants but are the ones with more status, due to their slightly larger brain capacity, but it is very slight. They have the same repertoire of movement as the second Zanni, with a few additional gestures that set them apart visually.\n\nInterestingly, the more I learn about commedia, the more logical it is. Sounds almost amusing due to the often chaotic appearance of commedia, but if you are to look closer, it is always organized chaos. Also, for example all the characters were born from the Zanni. Commedia in its origin only had Zanni, living in a world full of mayhem and mischief. As it developed new characters were introduced, such as Magnifico and Capitano. These characters share the anatomic structure of their predecessors, the Zanni. So while the characters status and roles may differ, apart from some particular gestures, most shall the same repertoire of movement.\n\nAlso, commedia is always done in pairs, and in this way it almost follows a binary code, with the lovers, the Vecci, the 1st and second Zanni. Here is an example of the Vecci binary couple, Magnifico and Dotore.\n\n(photo: Joren & Myself)\n\nIt is starting to rain, as I sit near the church and its holy WiFi, so I shall have to leave soon. But I’d like to just repeat the word, rain. It almost sounds as nice as it feels right now. It has been stinking hot in Reggio so when I felt the first small drop of rain, I swear I could hear a choir singing. Turns out there was a choir practicing behind me in the church. Coincidence? Most likely, but I like to think otherwise.\n\nA few days before the final canovaccio, all the students from both groups were told to sit in the theatre. It was here where we would find out what character Antonio cast us for our final performance, as well as naming the groups were in and the scenario. You could feel the excitement in the air. I personally thought I would levitate off my seat at any moment. For the last few days, the only thing people could seem to talk about was who they thought they would be cast as, and the people they hoped to work with. Antonio entered the theatre with a stack of sheets, handed them to the closest student to pass on, and sat down. When the paper finally found itself in my hands, I saw that I was cast as the Infarinato Pedrolino. Only two others were cast as Pedrolino besides myself.\n\n(photo: Joren, Alessio & Myself)\n\nAs I mentioned earlier about the binary couples, this 1st Zanni always finds himself with La Signora. He attends to her every need, and in a beautiful way the two need each other to survive in this world of Commedia. While signora is a type of master (often married to one of the Vecci), she lusts after a younger model such as the Capitano and if she is very lucky Flavio. But to organize these risqué meetings she calls upon the help of her faithful personal assistant, hairdresser, make-up artist and chair Pedrolino. It was my job as Pedrolino to oversee the successful midnight visit of the Capitano, but of course in commedia, the chaotic spectacle takes over and everything hurtles towards the inventive and colorful finish line. We were given 3 days to work in our groups on this canovaccio and for the final performance the theatre was packed with the local town’s people.\n\nIn total there were four canovaccio groups that performed. Ours was the ‘Grande finale!’ as Antonio would say. I remember looking up into the audience and not being able to see any vacant seats. Our performance itself went rather wellJ Afterwards the audience left the theatre, and we took their places in the stalls for our diploma ceremony. The mood in the room was electric. We were all buzzing after the show, and eagerly waiting our diplomas. The sheet of paper not only held our award, but also the two commedia characters, Antonio thinks we are best suited to.\n\nWhen my name was read I walked up, received my diploma envelope from Marchi, shook Antonio’s hand and practically floated back to my seat. Opening the envelope, I learnt that my two characters were the 1st Zanni and The Innamorata. An ecstatic ritual of hugging occurred, then it was off to a restaurant Antonio had booked for our final dinner, or as we thespians would say, the ‘after party’. When I arrived I saw that the entire restaurant had been booked for us. Now I say restaurant, but that’s not an entirely correct description. The venue was actually an old church, with a grass courtyard in the middle, a banquet table, and a large white hammock. Here the wine was passed around and a multitude of delicious dishes were served. Soon, it was the guitar that was being passed, as people played favorites from their countries and the rest all sang along.\n\nBefore we knew it, the time had come for us to say our final farewells. Many of us had early flights back to our respective home countries, or off to chase another adventure. It is always a strange thing to share such an intense and personal experience with another, and then know that you may never see them again. To think that they may continue to exist only in your memories or through a few sentences on Facebook. Still, I am terribly grateful to have had such a strong and friendly ensemble to experience the course with. I remain hopeful for further encounters, but if not, all the memories I do have would make you smile with a lemon in your mouth. Well, It’s time to leave for the airport myself. I’m off to visit a very special Lady in London, but when I get back, for a change of pace I will share what I have come to dub as the ‘Florence Files’. Prepare yourselves!\n\nCiao,\n\nNick\n\nCiao, come stai? La settimana scorsa mi sembrava come l’anno scorso!\n\nI have just had my first week of training and we have covered quite a great deal. In terms of characters we have covered the basics: learning the Zanni or servants, the Vecchi or old men, and the first and second lovers. There are about 35 students in total, and we have been divided into two groups, A and B.\n\nOur daily structure is as follows:\n\nFrom 9:30 to 11:00 we have Gestus with Antonio, and his helpers José & Martina. In this morning class, Antonio will gather us on the stage floor, stand on his raised platform and do one of two things: either he will tell us to sit and share with us historical tales of Commedia’s origins, evolution and Character, or he will provide an example of character, gestus or convention of Commedia and spend the next hour and a half instructing us to do the same.\n\nIf he begins with the practical element, Antonio will often call upon his two assistants to help with the demonstrations and instruction. I find this particularly helpful, as we do not only have a female portrayal of each character, but also another male example through José. Like the maestro, both assistants are exceptionally talented and seem to just click into the natural rhythms and nuances of Commedia and its characters.\n\nThe work is done either individually, in pairs or larger groups. We then have a 10-15 minute break, during which myself and others either desperately drink our water, gobble down a snack, stand over the air-conditioning grills in the floor around the theatre’s inner perimeter, or try to copy down everything we’ve learnt in small booklets and scraps of paper. Often I multitask and do all four at once. When the Break is over the group is split in two for the remainder of the days classes. Each day group A and B alternate the order of the split classes. For example on Monday group A will work with José on Gesto and then have Acro-yoga with Marcella, While Group B will start with Acro-Yoga and then move to Gesto.\n\nJosé is an ex-student of Antonio’s from about four years ago. He completed both the international and advanced course, loved it and as he excelled at the work, was asked by Antonio to come back and assist him in future workshops. The session with José is always fantastic, but utterly exhausting. We move to a separate room in the theatre, complete a brief set of stretches, then spend an hour working through what we have covered in the morning session with Antonio in detail. Here we are able to ask specific questions and ask for direct assistance from José during the entire session. Often any question or inquires I have from the morning session can be answered here by José.\n\nTowards the end of the session, José encourages a few of us to improvise in front of the group small scenes dealing with the focus of the class. After this, not surprisingly I’m left literally dripping with perspiration, but thankfully most of the group is as well. We have about 5 minutes to dry off and rehydrate then it’s back into the theatre at 12:30 to 1:30 for our hour of Acro-Yoga with Marcella.\n\nMarcella is the one of the best Yoga teachers I have ever had. Also she must have been a contortionalist, or a rubber band in a previous life, ‘cause she can bend in ways that makes me think of the exorcist. We started off the first session working though the ‘Salute the Sun’ routine. Now I have done this before, but Marcella pushes us all so much it’s like a completely different routine. Afterwards I felt fantastic, and as the days go by I can feel myself getting stronger, more flexible and more energetic. Ma (‘But’ in Italian), perhaps the best feature of Marcella’s class, she relates each exercise directly to the commedia work we do with Antonio and José. For example, a Zanni’s anatomic or base posture is; bottom out, chest out, arms and knees bent. The way Marcella leads us through the routine helps us sit in this base position so much more comfortably and extend it further. It is no longer a chore or an exhausting effort to sit in the characters of Commedia. I find it to be a more comfortable and natural experience, allowing myself as an actor to not be inhibited by physical concerns and restraints, but rather focus on the Lazzo, the story, and the audience.\n\nAfter the session with Marcella, I walk on my hands to the park for our lunch break. The park is beautiful, massive, covered with grass, water fountains and benches. Surrounded by cobblestone streets, it is divided by a path that leads to the other side, two small snack bars and the children’s play equipment. The children’s area is surrounded by a small train track, and every day at a certain time the tiny train comes out of its tunnel and kids can ride it around. One of the best things about the park, is that it is literally right in front of the teatro. This also comes in handy as when it’s time for our canovacci(public performance), our rehearsal space is often a spot in the park.\n\nAfter lunch, often spent trolling the streets for gelato and calzone pizza, the sessions begin once more. However, depending on what group you are the afternoon is significantly different. If in group A you head in half an hour early at 2:30, for a 30 minute explanation by Antonio of your canovacci. He then sends you out into the park to rehearse for 3 hours and come back to perform in the teatro, in mask in front of the other group and instructors. If in Group B you receive an extra half an hour break and return to the teatro at 3 for a 3 hour class of improvisation with Antonio.\n\nThe only time we are able to film or take photos during the Commedia day, is during the canovacci. Alora (‘so’ in Italian), thanks to my Dad, who bought me a HTC incredible S phone with an 8 megapixel camera, I have managed to film all but 2 canovacci so far. I have found it has been really helpful to watch your performance to pick up on the moments where you need to improve and also moments of triumph. Soon I will post 1 or 2 of the canovacci so you can see what we get up to ;)\n\nAfter the canovacci, the day is done, and we wander to a piazza for a beer and some food. I recently have discovered a thing called ‘appritovo’ a wondrous place where one can pay for a drink, and have unlimited access thereafter to a smorgasbord of food. Amazing! So for 4 euros I am able to have a beer and a full meal :D I love Italy.\n\nUntil next we meet,\n\nNick\n\nIt is so very hot, as I sit here in my boxers typing this on Pittagora rd. In fact, were it not for the week I have just had, I’m sure I could think of nothing else, but placing bets on which bead of sweat will hit the keyboard first. Thankfully, and rather incredibly, I have just spent a full week learning about Commedia dell’Arte from maestro Antonio Fava. (Hopefully I will be able to share some of my experience so far with you before my keyboard short-circuits)\n\nAlready exhausted from my flights, I have just arrived in Bologna from Rome. I hail a taxi, put my bags in the boot and proceed to open the driver’s door to get in. This causes the Taxi driver and his nearby colleges to laugh and say some words in Italian. I don’t yet speak much of the native language but I’m pretty sure he said ‘oh, he wants to drive, eh?’ that or ‘red head’s…’ Either way, I’m officially in Europe.\n\nI arrive in Reggio Emilia by train from Bologna. The time is 1:20am. 7 hours and 40 minutes from now I will start my first day of Commedia training. But we are getting ahead of ourselves…\n\nI get off the train, and begin to stalk the quiet streets of Reggio, trying to find the office where my apartment keys are waiting. I stop at a local café by the station which is open late, and I ask for directions from two old Italian women. When they decide they are of no help they call upon three young girls, also enjoying an extremely late coffee, to see if they know the street. Apparently it doesn’t exist, or at least is quite unknown to these locals.\n\nSo, filled with ‘confidence’ I walk down the street which I think one of the old ladies vaguely pointed towards, with backpack and suitcase trailing behind me. Yet as I don’t yet speak much Italian, she might have said, “I don’t know where the street is your looking for, but whatever you do, don’t go down there. That’s the street we don’t speak of”. As farfetched as this sounds, at close to two in the morning, with all my possessions including my money and passport, in a town where I have no idea where I am, this is where the imagination chooses to sit. Almost too aware of the horrible crunching my bag makes from rolling over fallen dry leaves, I choose to travel along the road, until my path crosses two young women. I believe they are Turkish. I ask for directions and after a failed attempt at verbal communication, they graciously decide to take me to the street personally. However, it seems they too, do not know of the street’s existence. But, they did posses my saving grace; an Italian phone. One uses her phone to call Dina Buccino, and then both stay with me at a bus stop until Dina comes to pick me up.\n\nDina is very friendly, particularly seeing it is two-something in the morning and she still has another tardy soul to seek after me. We arrive at my apartment and ascend to the tenth floor at the very top of the complex. She leads me down a hall, opens the door to my new room, hands me the keys and bids me goodnight…or good morning, I’m really not sure at this point. I find the bathroom and have the shower that everyone craves after a long flight, change into some fresh clothes and crawl into bed. I awake a few hours later to hear the sounds of life from my new roommates. Maybe the clunking noises I hear are revenge for my noisy entrance and 3am shower? Thinking of the shower, I look over to my towel and notice it is completely dry. This confirms what my body is telling me; it is hot here. When I open my door I meet Jerry, my roommate and fellow commedia peer. More on him later, but all you need to know for the time being on the subject is that I have lucked out.\n\nAfter breakfast, Jerry and I walk towards the Teatro for our first day of the International course in Commedia del’ Arte. Reggio by day is even more beautiful than when lit by moonlight. Cobblestone streets, laughing children zipping by on bikes, narrow alleyways full of café’s and pizza stores. I can’t help smiling as my eyes greedily take in the town I will be living in for the next quarter year. We pass many boutique clothes and gelato stores as we make our way through a bibliotech, and ancient buildings each as unique as a blade of grass under a microscope.\n\nEventually we arrive at our destination: the teatro. It is a large cream orange building right in front of a massive park. The entrance is around the side, where I walk through a stylish room with a front of house, large paintings adorning the walls and I meet my new best friend, a water cooler. We pass by one of the sides of the front of house, through the thick black curtain into the space where I will spend the next month learning about one of the most ancient forms of drama by an authentic maestro.\n\nNick"
