        "text": "“Ciao, what are you up to?” Flavia says while looking at me and checking if I have any white hair, if my dress is this season’s or a couple of years old, and whether I have gained weight or not. “Nothing much, and you? How are you all?” I reply, while checking basically the same things. “So and so, we keep going,” she answers. An Italian will never say “I am fine” or “Things are fantastic.” An Italian is afraid of jealousy and that the person in front may look at her/him evil-ly, with an evil eye, a malocchio.\n\nMalocchio is a superstition we find especially in the Mediterranean and Near Eastern countries, since ancient times. It is a form of curse transmitted by one’s eyes, believed by many cultures to cause injury or bad luck to the person at whom it is directed. As a curse, the evil eye is most commonly attributed to envy, and is usually cast by staring at or excessively praising.\n\nIn Islamic culture, Muhammad stated “the influence of an evil eye is a fact,” while in Judaism the evil eye is mentioned several times in classical texts including the Old Testament. In Spain it is called mal de ojo, in Persia “salty eye,” in the Jewish culture ayin ha’ra. In Italy, it is malocchio. I believe it derives from a close-knit society, whose members know everything about one another; from comparisons, jealousy and envy; from believing in the strength of negative energy. A person’s fortunes, job, gifted children can all become good reasons to unchain envy and desire by others: malocchio could be defined as the negative side of seduction.\n\nIn Naples, the idea of malocchio or bad luck-bringing, jettatura, was strengthened in the 18th century when Andrea De Jorio, an archaeologist who was believe to be a jinx, arrived at the court of Ferdinand the Second. The king worried about him and died the day after his arrival.\n\nEven though they are often considered connected, jettatura and malocchio are actually two very different concepts. The first, which we find in Pirandello’s short story La Patente, is more of a natural characteristic of a person who brings bad luck without meaning it. Malocchio, on the contrary, implicates a will to cause bad luck.\n\nThere are many instruments and methods considered amulets against malocchio: horns, horse shoes, garlic, hot chili peppers, or throwing salt behind one’s back. In Sicily, houses were purified with salt put in sachets inside closets or in little mounds along their perimeter, or at least at its corners. There are also prayers and rhymes like “Aglio (garlic), fravaglie (small fish, symbol of Christ), fatture ca nun quaglie (the magic will not happen), corna (horns), bicorna (double horns), cape ‘e alice (sardines heads) e cape d’aglio (garlic heads).”\n\nAccording to ancient traditions, malocchio causes persistent headaches, nausea and loss of strength. When someone believes to be suffering from unexplainable strikes of bad luck and has the above mentioned symptoms, he or she will try to have a “diagnosis.” Usually an old lady who, as per tradition, would have received this wisdom by the fire on Christmas night, takes a dish with water and drops three drops of oil. If the oil almost fragments and mixes with water, the person is a victim of malocchio; if instead the oil widens over the dish, there is no curse. In the first case, a ritual accompanied by prayers is carried out to free the victim: it usually includes the use of milk or herbs like rue, which apparently has amazing properties. The ritual ends with a prayer and the marking of the “victim” with a cross traced seven times with an oiled finger.\n\nThe use of herbs against malocchio could be found also in Ancient Rome where basil was used while in Cyprus, even today, olive leaves are burnt. In Sardinia, malocchio is fought with the use of a peculiar piece of jewelry called so kokku or sabegia, depending on the area. It is made with a stone – usually obsidian, but coral and onyx are also common – set between two silver decorations. The stone is supposed to absorb what in Sardinia is called s’ogu malu or mazzinas, malocchio, and to protect the person wearing it. When the decorations fall off, it means the stone is saturated with bad energy and it must be changed with a new and pure one. This jewel was usually gifted by mothers, godmothers and grandmothers to brides or pregnant women, and it was worn near the heart or, in case of pregnancy, near the belly to protect the unborn child.\n\nMalocchio is so much part of Italian culture that a comedy film was made in 1983 with Lino Banfi and Johnny Dorelli. Entitled Occhio, Malocchio, Prezzemolo e Finocchio (eye, evil eye, parsley and fennel), it makes fun of superstitions. But malocchio is not only a superstition, but a big business. According to statistics, the commerce surrounding superstitions and evil magic is worth billions. In Italy, Codacons tells us, there are over 160.000 people who operate in this field and 13 million Italians (one out of four) asks for their help. This is a quest for help that makes no difference among age, class or sex. Forty percent are between the ages of 35 and 55, ten percent are teenagers. There is even an Italian website where there is a price list for all magic spells: here we learn that sending a malocchio costs $1200, while removing it costs $900. In reality, costs are always much higher and it is common knowledge that some people have been fooled into paying hundreds of thousands of euros to so called witches and wizards.\n\nIt is healthier to shield oneself from negative energies imagining to be like a mirror that sends them back to the maker, and religion is always there to help: an old Sicilian saying reminds us to pray when we think to be looked at with the evil eye, supra ri tia, ca supra ri mia ci sta Gesu’, Giuseppe e Maria (on you, because on me I have Jesus, Joseph and Mary), followed by the sign of the Cross. Some also add the symbol of horns, made with pointed index and pinky fingers. But the best method of all is just to laugh and walk away!"
