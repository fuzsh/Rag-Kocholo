        "text": "Susana Campos Ovalle was born on August 31, 1934 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. From a young age he showed a talent for acting. She had her first opportunity, by some accounts in Tres millones... y el amor directed by Luis Bayon Herrera in 1946. Other researchers state that her career began in 1947 when she was selected along with other girls, including Analia Gade , in a contest to accompany Maria Duval in “La serpiente de cascabel” Rattlesnake, directed by Carlos Schlieper and others place the young Actress in a previous film, “Mi novia es un fantasma” directed by Mugica Francisco.\n\nShe received other roles and travelled to Spain, where he shot several films. The actress used to appear in these films with dyed blonde, which director José Luis Borau did not like, who admired her clean and serene beauty as much as for her talent. He chose her to star in “Crimen de doble” (1964) and managed to convince her to change her hair to its natural color, something he was proud of. Other memorable performances were in “Del brazo y por la calle” (1966), “Los muchachos de antes no usaban gomina” (1969), “El día que me quieras” (1969), with Hugo del Carril, “Los chicos crecen” (1974) and “Los viernes de la eternidad” (1980). Susana appeared in only one Euro-western under the pseudonym Evelin Therens, “Django Does Not Forgive” (1966) in the role of Helen Patterson.\n\nShe also appeared on stage in such plays as “Death of a Salesman” by Arthur Miller and “Guilty by Narciso Ibáñez Menta. Her stage and film career ran simultaneously until her death.\n\nHer last film was “Cómo pasan las horas” in 2004 directed by Inés de Oliveira Cézar.\n\nShe was stricken by a brain tumor in 1999 which she had removed but it returned and she died on October 16, 2004 in her hometown of Buenos Aires, Argentina at the age of 70.\n\nToday we remember Susana Campos on what would have been her 80th birthday.\n\nOn seeing Akira Kurosawa's \"Yojimbo,\" Sergio Leone thought it would make a great western. \"Yojimbo\" was inspired by Dashiell Hammett's novel \"Red Harvest\" and also by Hollywood westerns like \"Shane.\" As Leone said, \"It would be wonderful to take it back to where it originally came from.\" So in 1964 the western was reinvented in Italy as a low budget film originally called \"Il Magnifico Straniero\" (The Magnificent Stranger). The title was changed to \"A Fistful of Dollars.\"\n\nThough not the first Italian western, Leone's approach was truly unique. It became a huge success in Italy and made a movie star of Clint Eastwood. Thus the \"spaghetti western\" was born. The prototype for the cynical, ultra-cool action hero (or antihero) had now been established. Also integral to the film was maestro Ennio Morricone's score using the pseudonym Dan Savio while Leone billed himself as Bob Robertson in homage to his father’s alias Roberto Roberti. Gian Volonte was billed as John Wells, Marianna Kock was Marianne Kock, Benito Stefanelli was Benny Reeves. It was hoped the film would be accepted as an American film.\n\nThe first screening of the film was in Florence, Italy on August 27, 1964. It was a stifling hot day and releasing a film in August in Italy in those days was the kiss of death. The cinema was ancient with fixtures and fittings dating to 1908 and was located in an alleyway. The producers, discouraged by comments in the Italian film industry had not invested a single lira in publicity. The film was listed only in the local daily newspapers.\n\nAs expected the film did little box office on Friday and Saturday and Leone had returned home to Rome very discouraged. When he called the manager late Monday he was told the receipts had doubled Sundays. By Tuesday and Wednesday people were being turned away. By word of mouth the film became a hit and was later released throughout Italy and became not only the biggest film of the year it was highest grossing western ever released in Italy.\n\nToday we look back and celebrate not only the launching of a new type of western but a new style of filmmaking and the creation of the antihero. 50 years later we are still feeling the effects this film created and the way films are made today.\n\nBlair Underwood was born on August 25, 1964 in Tacoma, Washington. the son of Marilyn Ann Scales, an interior decorator, and Frank Eugene Underwood, Sr., a United States Army colonel.
