        "text": "Depression is rage spread thin. --- George Santayana\n\nIn the films, actresses like Garbo made melancholy and depression seem so attractive. Even glamorous.\n\nWell, baby, that's in the movies.\n\nIt's uncomfortable to discuss, but to try to silence it and confine it only seems to give it strength. For me, anyway.\n\nTo voice it, though, seems to lift the handle on its dark cage and releases it out into the light so you can see it, so you can face it.\n\nIf you ever suffer from bouts of—yes, say it—depression, you may sometimes feel the same way. Many of these feelings are continuous for some. But even those occasional times are potent enough to knock me to my knees.\n\nFor me, some of it is like...\n\nEveryone hates me. Everyone is out to get me.\n\nEvery bad thing that happens is my fault. Somehow---even though it has nothing to do with me or is a million miles across the globe—it’s still my fault.\n\nI cry.\n\nEvery nasty word spoken on the social networks, in groups, all over the world, is directed at me. A perpetual condemning finger is pointed in my face.\n\nI cry a little more.\n\nMy writing sucks. I might receive a million fabulous comments on my book and I smile. But let even one mockery, one snarky comment appear and I plunge into fits of giant insecurity about my talent.\n\nI cry even more.\n\nThe world plays favorites and I'm the oddball left out of life's game of Red Rover, Red Rover. Nobody likes me. Nobody wants me on their team. I'm nobody's favorite.\n\nTune up for more tears.\n\nI don't fit in anywhere. Being a square peg in a round hole, for some, is just wonderful individuality. For me, it's glaring, humiliating case of not being cool. I simply don't belong.\n\nBawl fest.\n\nEveryone's talking about me behind my back.\n\nMajor waterworks.\n\nEvery other writer's work is better than mine. If I can't be like them, write what they write, I'm a failure. It's no matter that I have my own individual talent. I'm not happy with that. No, I want to be the other authors.\n\nCry me a river.\n\nI want to be alone, very alone, yet the alone-ness is unbearable because it leaves only me in room with that the entity called depression.\n\nI crave support and a kind word but, like a vampire to a cross, I cringe and hiss when it's offered. Hell, I even bite the friendly hand sometimes.\n\nAs an author, I can't get recognized fast enough. Not only am I angry at myself for this, I'm angry at those who are recognized already.\n\nI sometimes alienate those who want to help. Not even they’re able to be the comforting rocks they usually are. I'm too angry to want a Rock of Gibraltar. I want to flounder and lick my wounds. I want to feel sorry for myself, it seems the only sensible thing at the moment. See? Just another side effect—the sincere feeling that I deserve to flounder and sink.\n\nIt reminds me of swimming lessons years ago. Upon my sinking in the huge, Olympic size pool, the instructor jumped in to save me. Panicking, I clawed at his head to push myself above water and nearly drowned him. I needed to be rescued but I resisted it.\n\nThis unsettled state causes resentment toward things where no resentment should be.\n\nAnd here is the thing. I'm making light of the effects of depression...maybe trying to make some humor. Because, believe me, its reach is much deeper, much harder to explain, much, much harder to grasp. And much stronger.\n\nI look in the mirror and imagine myself a prima donna. Me, me, me. To most, I'm willing to bet, it appears that I have a severe case of narcissism. Yet, deep in my heart, I know the selfishness is merely a stubborn clinging—a realization that I really, really do not want to sink. And I'm screaming, shouting, hating, crying, loving, fearing, clawing so someone will notice that I am adrift. I'd probably, as usual, deny the helping hand. Because, you know, as Garbo would say, I want to be left alone.\n\nMaybe I do need to be left alone. But I don't want to be left alone. Not completely. Not always.\n\nAnd, yes, solitude is a beautiful thing and often a necessary thing. Yes, sometimes that dark cage is a sanctuary. A safe refuge. A beautiful, healing place. I cherish this escape, this private mental hideout from bouts of depression.\n\nI just leave the latch open.\n\nDo not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for. -- Epicurus\n\nI'd like to say I was just a tiny tyke, not old enough to know better, when The Great Purse Affair happened.\n\nBut that would be a lie.\n\nIt was a lean Christmas for my family. Financially, that is. 1960-something. At the time, Daddy worked two jobs. By day, he was a postal carrier (pre-government postal service) bringing in a whopping $2.15 an hour. Nights, he pushed a broom as a janitor at Jackson Intermediate School.\n\nIn my kid mind, Daddy's long hours meant nothing to me. It was just what fathers were supposed to do. I mean, what did I know of employment, supporting a family—feeding them, clothing them, the roofs over their heads and all that stuff? In that clueless brain of mine, it was all just…there. And that was the good thing about families who loved us. It was just there, always, and we never worried because parents did all the things they were supposed to do to make sure of that.\n\nEven though I had no allowance like some children, even though my only spending money came from scouting for empty coke bottles and cashing in the deposits for pennies and nickels, I still had no concept of all that income-to-debt ratio crap. Like I said, my parents kept me fed, kept clothes on my back, and life was as is should have been.\n\nOne year my coat was a fabulous red leather number that had been an item getting ready to be disposed of from the school's Lost and Found. The jacket was magnificent, and it didn't dawn on me to be embarrassed of its origin. Nobody else knew where it came from. It was pretty. It looked cool on me. No worries.\n\nBut, like with everything else in my young-and-oblivious-to-financial-things life, I still had no clue as to how difficult it must have been for my parents to supply even the simplest basics of their children's needs.\n\nNever did it occur to me to wonder what must have been going through their minds. That maybe it bothered them to not be able to afford expensive gifts like our friends were going to get. Or that, while our pals would wake up to a living room full of goodies, we would wake up to one gift each.\n\nIf only I had been able to see into their parental minds. If only.\n\nThis particular Christmas morning, my sister, brother and I woke up to find one gift for each under the tree.\n\nI can't even remember what my little brother received from 'Santa', I only remember what my sister and I received.\n\nPurses.\n\nAnd, you know, those pretty handbags were very nice. Looking back, I realize they hadn't been cheap.\n\nEven though only one gift each, the purses still had been a sacrifice for my parents.\n\nThrough the years, I've agonized over that Christmas morning and the way it went down.\n\nMore times than I can count, I’ve tortured myself over the fact that I saw the happiness, the pride in my parent's eyes when we spotted our purses under the tree. I saw the expectant smiles on their faces.\n\nI saw all this.\n\nI saw it and yet...\n\nMy sister's purse was bigger than mine. Much bigger.\n\nShe was older than me, she had already started high school. Girls her age carried big bags. The large purse was the style. It was suitable for her.\n\nI, who was still in middle school, was given a much smaller purse. More suitable for a girl my age. A lovely purse it was. Brown leather.\n\nBut it was smaller than my sister's. It was a kid-sized purse, and hers was so sophisticated, elegant. Her purse was more mature.\n\nNow here is where I'm ashamed to tell more. But, to say it out loud, I find some sort of reconciling for my heart. Accountability, maybe.\n\nWhat did I do when I saw my purse? I cried. Damn. Like a spoiled, immature brat, I cried.\n\nHow many times I’ve prayed for a time machine to take me back to that moment between my mother's happy smile and my ugly tears! To please, please, please let me do it again! To do it right.\n\nYes, I actually pitched a pure-d hissy fit. If I remember correctly, I even said I hated my purse. I was so overcome with jealousy. I wanted a purse just like my sister's.I ruined that beautiful moment—the pride that came with my parent's sacrifice—by being jealous.\n\nI threw such a tantrum that my mother promised to take me to the store after Christmas to exchange my kiddie bag for a more mature, giant bag like my sister's.\n\nAnd she did.\n\nI returned to school with that huge purse and I was happy that I had won, right?\n\nNo.\n\nHow stupid I looked, dragging that monster bag around the halls of San Jacinto Intermediate School! Of course, I didn't realize that at the time. Only later, years later, imagining the silly little girl with the enormous purse. Oh, hell, it was probably one hundred times too big for the miniscule amount of junk I toted.\n\nThe funny thing?\n\nMy mother didn’t really remember the incident at all. In my overwhelming guilt, I reminded her of it years later. Even when I reminded her, she laughed. And, for years, she thought of it with humor. I do, too. Sort of. But another part of me aches horribly every time I recall the shock, followed by disappointment, on her face when I turned on the waterworks that Christmas.\n\nSo why am I telling this now? Is there a point to this?\n\nI guess. I don’t know. Maybe that, since that holiday so, so long ago, I’ve lost so many family members. I’ve lost my parents, I’ve lost my own child, I’ve lost the sister who got the big-girl purse, and my younger brother.\n\nAnd I see how very unimportant the gifting part of life really is.\n\nThe Great Purse Affair has tormented me all these years. That longing to re-do moments in time, to have known what I know now—having been a parent myself—about love and sacrifice and appreciation. I would love to say that the purse meltdown was the only time I ever pitched a jealous fit or was childishly unhappy over anything I didn’t like. It wasn’t, though.\n\nI can't undo the horrible reaction to the purse or the tantrums over disappointments in my life when I was too young to understand the sacrifices behind them. And maybe I don't really want to. As long as I feel that moment and feel the big wrongness of that long-ago reaction, I'll mentally tag myself to always be grateful for those who love me.\n\nShe broke your throne, and she cut your hair, and from your lips she drew the Hallelujah.... --- Hallelujah, Leonard Cohen\n\nThe lyrics of Leonard Cohen's song, Hallelujah are raw, pure, and nearly double me over with emotion. A lament of pain, disappointment, and things not so pretty in relationships.\n\nMuch of the lyrics, such as, I've heard there was a secret chord, that David played, and it pleased the Lord...and...You saw her bathing on the roof, her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you...and especially, the baffled king composing Hallelujah speak of King David---themes of seduction, temptation, betrayal, lust and...cheating.\n\nInfidelity.\n\nIt strikes a chord in me regarding struggles to meld myself into the romanctic genres, to the traditional guidelines of romance writing.When once I hinted that the hero in my novel had cheated, I was quickly advised, readers don't like cheaters.\n\nReaders don't like...\n\nSo this began my grappling with writing in the real world. Gone were the days of yore, when I first began to write. When my characters could do anything they pleased because nobody could see them except me. They were protected by that wonderful privacy shield of writing-just-for-me.Now, it's beyond the phase of staying in the guidelines and into issues of what readers do and don't like.It is confusing. It is intimidating.\n\nReaders DO, overwhelmingly, like flawed characters. The demand is for flawed characters. These flaws include bitter dispositions, substance abuse, issues of past abuse, selling themselves for sex, using other characters to get what they want, physical handicaps. Sometimes even just being plain creeps for no good reason. Real life issues.But...The one flaw, one of the most common imperfections in the real world of relationships---cheating---is, I am told, often taboo to write. The never-never-land of writing, the forbidden zone. It's a major real life thing, but, in fiction, it is a touchy subject.Once, during a discussion on a forum, a heated debate erupted over the subject, with the majority rising up in arms over cheating main characters. The debate became vicious, names were called, cuss words flew like crazy. It was a hot, hot, hot button. The voice was clear, the people had spoken: NO CHEATING in romance fiction.Which brings me back to Kind David. An icon in religion, a renowned man of valor and passion in history, a powerful king, a poet, a lover, a husband, a father, a...cheater.\n\nKing David Spies on Bathsheba\n\nWait. It gets worse. Not only did David lust for a married woman, but his passion drove him to commit the hugest crime of all---he ordered the murder of Bathsheba's husband. Talk about drama. But it was real. It was no make-believe fictional novel, it was real life.Cheating. On a big scale.And yet? David is beloved in history. His poetry, The Psalms, are revered. History adores the man. David was even called a man after God's own heart.As powerful as he was, this king of Israel, he was flawed. In my mind, he's very likely one of the most perfect examples of flawed human nature I can think of.And what about fictional characters who cheat?What about ol' Scarlett O'Hara?\n\nGone with the Wind\n\nPoor Scarlett. She never got her chance to cheat, but she sure wanted to. I say poor Scarlett because, when she and Ashley were spotted in an embrace, Ms. O'Hara was forced to wear that deliciously devilish red dress as a sign of the harlot. And, yet, Mr. Wilkes---who was just as guilty as she was---got a loving salute of For He's A Jolly Good Fellow. Double standard, but that's another story.\n\nWhat about Fatal Attraction?\n\nFatal Attraction\n\nOkay, so that was a case of cheating gone very wrong. But the hero, who blatantly cheated on his lovely, always-smiling wife still managed to be the hero in the end. He fell from his heroic throne for a minute, but regained his noble status before all was said and done. He'd cheated, but he was forgiven. One of my very, very favorite films, How to Make An American Quilt, deals with another aspect of cheating. A young fiance having a last-minute fling, therefore cheating on her fiance, with a steamy Latino.\n\nHow to Make an American Quilt\n\nAnd one of the most loved infidelity films/novels of all, The Bridges of Madison County. We, the audience, loved the heroine. We loved her lover. We rooted for them. But here's the thing. There was no abuse in her marriage, no reason to justify her cheating, it just happened. But we loved her. We loved him. Because we did love them, we didn't call it taboo, we didn't demand justification. We just accepted it and, in our minds, we cheated right along with them.\n\nBridges of Madison County\n\nAnd don't forget lovable cheatster, Don Draper, from the television series, Mad Men. Oh, my. Mr. Draper has had more extra-marital affairs and rolls in the hay than the modern calculator can compute. And get this. He's not even remorseful. Oh, wait, he might have been apologetic for a minute when he got caught. And yet? The audience loves the man. Somehow, he wriggles out from under his girlfriends' beds the unscathed, beloved hero we just can't stay mad at.\n\nMad Men\n\nOddly, Don Draper is one of my favorite fictional characters. The writers produced a realistic, extremely unapologetic image of a human complete with every flaw imaginable. Everybody knows a Don Draper. Every office has one. Why pretend the Drapers of the world do not exist, and why pretend they can't actually be just...people?\n\nIs it the fact these films/novels are mainstream that lets them slide under the Cheating Hero/Heroine Radar? Is it just romance fiction where infidelity is not accepted as a true human error and embraced as a flaw?\n\nI'm not arguing. I'm just confused. I'm not condoning cheating. I'm just frustrated at tiptoeing through the land mines of do's and don'ts in fiction, at the codes used to make the decisions as to which human failures and flaws are forgivable by the reader.\n\nAs for David, the King? Even after committing adultery, he was forgiven by God. Oh, the powerful Israelite suffered hugely for his mistake. But he was forgiven.\n\nAlthough he's no fictional character, he still remains one of the most potent examples of a human to commit such crimes against humanity---which included murder---and still somehow, because we were endeared to him, he emerged from the rubble as the hero.\n\nTo me, flaws aren't limited to guidelines dictated by a genre. They are as real as the flaws we do create for fiction and romance.\n\nSo my question? Can a hero or heroine commit the act of adultery and still manage to redeem themselves?\n\nI believe they can. It is a challenge, I'll admit, to bring them around full circle. And, if an author can convincingly meet that challenge---to deliver this situation with the delicacy necessary to handle the highly charged emotional explosive it is---then I see it as a human flaw that has its place in romantic fiction.\n\nHave you read books that contain cheating characters? What did you think of them? Were you able to forgive them?\n\nHeroes may not be braver than anyone else. They're just braver five minutes longer. ----Ronald Reagan\n\nDuring a discussion about alpha males, a dear writer friend chided me and said I was a ‘true beta lover’.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause I love a man who has that trace of something that lets him cry, lets him be in touch with—and, damn, does this ever sound cliché?—his sensitive side. I was going to say his feminine side, but who says crying was strictly a girl thing?\n\nBusted. She’s right. I accept my crown graciously and wear it with pride.\n\nBut, wait.\n\nThe truth of the matter is, I decided to research alpha and beta males.\n\nAfter studying, I admit my idea of what constitutes an alpha male was pretty much off target. For some reason, I believed alphas had to be perfect in every way—strength, confidence, looks, charm, the whole checklist of qualities to make him…well, a hero. Turns out, like I said, I was wrong. The distinction between alphas and betas is really nothing more than a matter of leadership, a take-charge, protector persona as opposed to a more secondary male role.\n\nThe role of beta male was, however, more clearly defined. And it was as follows: An unremarkable, careful man who avoids risk and confrontation. Beta males lack the physical presence, charisma and confidence of the Alpha male.\n\nAha! Turns out, according to that description, I may have to relinquish my Queen of the Beta Lovers crown because that is not the personification of the male characters I love.\n\nHere’s the question, then, if the above is truly a portrait of a beta male: Who the hell is the character I love? So he cries, sure. But he does not avoid risk or confrontation, he certainly doesn't lack physical presence, and most assuredly does have charisma and confidence.\n\nSo. Is he an alpha or not? I don’t know. You tell me.\n\nMany writers and readers feel that an alpha male indeed can be vulnerable, can cry. In fact, they love them more when they do exhibit these tendencies.\n\nBut others argue that it emasculates them to some degree, strips them of the alpha status. Many see this in the case of real-life relationships as well. Let a man cry at something, and he's out the door on his bum faster than you can say Jack Be Nimble.\n\nDoes crying, being easily affected by emotion, make a man less masculine? I don’t think so. If anything, I think it makes him more masculine, simply for the fact that he's strong enough, confident enough to not feel the need to hide behind a macho persona.\n\nJose Saramago said this: I never appreciated 'positive heroes' in literature. They are almost always clichés, copies of copies, until the model is exhausted. I prefer perplexity, doubt, uncertainty, not just because it provides a more 'productive' literary raw material, but because that is the way we humans really are.\n\nInteresting!\n\nAn example who comes to my mind is King David. Powerful King of Jerusalem, fearless leader of legions in his army. Wise. Yet one of the most romantic, poetic souls in history. The Psalms contain some of the most agonizing, tearful, poignant prose ever written. Yet his constant inner angst personified the beauty of his character without negating his power.\n\nI think I shall not categorize my heroes into alpha, beta, or any other Greek alphabet. They just are who they are. How about if I just call them the heroes of the story?\n\nBut for those who might feel there should be that distinction—alpha as opposed to beta—does a hero lose critical points for being sensitive and possibly vulnerable? As long as these softer sides of his persona do not thwart his ability to take control, can he still be an alpha male?\n\n“No name-calling truly bites deep unless, in some dark part of us, we believe it. If we are confident enough then it is just noise.” ― Laurell K. Hamilton\n\nMy first book (contract long expired) was published in 2011.\n\nLike all new authors, I was in the clouds. The entire experience, from finishing the novel to the offering of a contract, to the first glimpse of the cover to the event—its release.\n\nAnd then reviews.\n\nMost authors may have much more confidence that I do. Feedback may not affect them. Bad reviews may glide off them like water on a duck's back, and good feedback may just be taken in stride.\n\nNot me.\n\nOh, I got many wonderful reviews. Some cited good, strong positives about my writing as well as informative and appreciated constructive criticism of the book’s weaker points. Most importantly, many took my book seriously. My chest swelled with pride.\n\nBut here's the kicker.\n\nThe weeds—those unavoidable yet necessary weeds called negative feedback—cropped up in my lovely garden of praise.\n\nIn retrospect (you know how you remember the harsh stuff more than anything else?), I think the worst hit to my pride was for a reviewer to call the plot silly.\n\nOuch.\n\nTo compound the fracture of the embarrassment, the reviewer's tone was—and how I hate this word—snarky. It made fun of the plot! To have my book mocked in such a demeaning fashion was hurtful, especially as I was a new author.\n\nWelcome to the world of thick skin development! Double ouch.\n\nIn my smashed ego-vision, I saw the reviewer as a sort of Skut Farkas (A Christmas Story), making fun of my silly story and taunting me to run home and tell my mommy.\n\nOh, hey, I'm not pitying myself. I'll be the first to admit the plot probably was kind of silly. I learned the hard way—which I have to admit might be the best way—that plotting was not my strong suit in writing. I did have many strengths, but, alas, plot creation might not have been among them.\n\nEven this realization didn’'t discourage me. I'd learn to put the iron to my writing weaknesses. To acknowledge those issues and work on them could and still can only improve my skills.\n\nWhat did bother me is that I took that particular weed and held it close to my heart, clung to it and, for some reason, set it as the standard for my self-confidence.\n\nAfter that review, I even found myself warning potential readers, Hey, the plot is pretty silly, just warning you. Or, Hope you enjoy my silly little book. Yes! I even warned that my book was silly!\n\nTragically, I constantly referred to my book as silly. And I meant it. I really believed—because someone poked fun at my book—that it was a piece of garbage.\n\nShame on me.\n\nRecently, after the first year had passed, after I'd resigned myself to having a silly book to my name, after apologizing constantly for the book itself—I took a long look at the story.\n\nAnd you know what?\n\nI cried first, just from reliving the memories of writing it, the pride in being accepted by the publisher, the thrill of it all. And, finally, I cried because I'd be damned if I didn't see my baby through new eyes, and actually found myself admitting it wasn't such a bad book after all. It had its good points as well as its bad, and I was sorry that I'd spent so much negative time on being embarrassed by it.\n\nIt was a first book. Some write perfect first books. I did not. Yes, the silly plot hadn't miraculously changed in a year's time. It was still there.\n\nBut I finally allowed myself the pride I should have had all along. I realized that the silly thing was to have judged and condemned my own work based on one comment in one review. I'm not saying I should not have taken the feedback seriously. I should. And still I do.\n\nBut I shouldn't have lost my pride in my work—which put the shadows of doubt on any future works and in my ability—based on one little neutron of negativity.\n\nI'll always embrace humility in my work, but I'll write to the best of my ability and I'll try to embrace my pride as well. A happy medium of both, I hope.\n\nSo, my precious little book. I owe you an apology for letting myself ever be ashamed of you. You weren't such a bad little book after all.\n\n“Don't classify me, read me. I'm a writer, not a genre.” -- Carlos Fuentes\n\nI've got a past. What I call fondly the good ol' days. I cling to memories of my beginnings as a writer.\n\nEverybody starts out differently. I'd been writing, in one form or another, since childhood. First, stories sketched like comic strip tales. Later, in high school, a friend and I wrote fantasy stories, ala Georgette Heyer, Christopher Lee fanfic, Dark Shadows with Barnabus Collins. Later still, another friend and I traded Rudolph Valentino stories. We were hopeless Valentino fans and we blissfully lost ourselves in writing scenarios in which we, of course, were his lovers.\n\nThen one night I dreamed about Russell Crowe! So Valentino got tossed to the side of the road in favor of swarthy Maximus in my new Gladiator fantasy.\n\nThen...then...I had a relentless drive to actually...write. A real story, as in submitting it. It was going to be shocking, it was going to be a best seller. I was going to be famous.\n\nSo I took off on a new journey with a new destination. FAME.\n\nFunny thing, though, as illustrious and famed as I planned to be, I still wrote for fun. It was fun.\n\nWhat more could there be to this writing gig, after all? One simply wrote a story, thumbed through a list of agents, then simply plunked the manuscript into the mail.\n\nI'd like this to be published, please.\n\nThe lucky agent, all a-flutter at the most magnificent manuscript they'd ever received, would hasten to find me a publishing house and there it would be. In like Flynn. I would soon be famous.\n\nPlease.\n\nAre you going to make me humiliate myself by telling you the outcome to that dream?\n\nHere's the thing, though. It was so much fun. I was so new, so green. So full of hope. I was doing something I loved, and, joy of joys, it was going to make me rich and make me famous. God, how I loved it.\n\nMy first serious stab at writing was a Mafia story. It was, at first glance, what is known in the publishing world as a 'hetero' romance or a male/female romance, a story between a man and a woman.\n\nI introduced a gay couple as supporting characters. The genre bible said, this still falls into male/female romance. Whew. So I still had that genre thing on track, that gave me a good insight into where I could publish. Which publishers accepted what, and all that jazz.\n\nOh, but one thing.\n\nIt is still male/female romance unless the gay couple have on-screen sex.\n\nUh-oh.\n\nOkay, they do have sex on the page.\n\nSo, does that mean...?\n\nOh, that's different.\n\nYou've now ventured over into mainstream. It can no longer be a hetero romance if there is an other-than-heterosexual sex scene or scenes in the story.\n\nVery well, so I'll start looking for a publisher who...\n\nNow I could take the gay characters out of the story, the rules suggest.\n\nNah, I really like these guys, couldn't I just...?\n\nNot in this story, and still call it a hetero romance. Now, you could perhaps put them in their own story? Then that would be classified as male/male romance. Another genre.\n\nBut they belong in the story.\n\nThen no sex from them, and everything will fine. Unless, of course, you go mainstream.\n\nSo, that story was shelved for a while. I did try to extract the gay characters and give them their own vehicle. But you know how characters are. The boys had none of that. So, hell. Nobody gets a story. Right?\n\nMainstream, remember?\n\nNow this is too much of a headache. I'll just come back to them later.\n\nOn to another story. My first published story (under my C. Zampa pen name), CANDY G. Piece of cake. Two men in a two-man romance. Male/male romance. That was easy! Gender-ising, that is.\n\nBut there I am again. My current story is just the opposite. A story of two gay men with a woman in the cast, a woman who has a huge point of view in the story. She's the soon-to-be ex-wife of one of the characters.\n\nThis time, it's the woman's presence raising the flags.\n\nShe is allowed, but no on-screen sex scenes for her.\n\nYes, very well. I can manage that. The sex between her and her husband isn't crucial to the story anyway. Or is it? I must decide if it's important, based on genre guidelines, not by on how important the sexual changes are in the relationship.\n\nSo it is still a male/male romance.\n\nAt this point, I'm confused.\n\nThe bottom line? Life is not compartmentalized by genres. Real-life drama is a big mix of everything. Straight people and gay people interact in real life.\n\nBut, to keep in perfect genre-fication, we have to pretend that one of the genders does not really have sex. Well, I take that back. They can have it, just don't tell about it. It'll just be their little secret.\n\nSilly as it is, I have friends who write male/male fiction who act like they'll get cooties if they look at pictures of straight couples kissing. And, vice versa, author who do the same if male/male pictures are posted. Genre, baby, genre. (In truth, it's bias and prejudice, but that's another, much bigger issue). Never the twain shall meet in certain genres.\n\nFor me, personally, sex is sex. If it fits a character, any character, in the book, it belongs. If it is crucial to the story, if it's not just thrown in as sex for sex's sake. It doesn't turn me off, doesn't offend me. Others might not feel the same, though, and they are completely right in their own feelings. That's the beautiful part of human nature. We are all different, and it should be okay that way.\n\nI'm not complaining about these guidelines. They are there for specific reasons, and I understand them completely. I adhere to them.\n\nBut...But...\n\nI do miss the early days when I just wrote my heart away, beautiful, no-genre writing, everybody all in the same story, gay, straight, sex, no sex. Everybody had their place in my book. It was so simple, so pure. And fun.\n\nI don't resent the way it actually is, these genre guidelines. I just miss the absence of inhibition from those good old days. When I just wrote without having to fit a genre, but I wrote to the heart of the story, whatever that heart might be.\n\n“My favorite genre is Beautifully Written Books of Any Genre.
