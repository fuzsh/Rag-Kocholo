        "text": "Darien Shockra & The Bermuda Triangle follows three friends living in Bermuda who are unaware of their destiny to become the protectors of the universe till their 21st birthday when their unique abilities emerge. What was the inspiration for the setup of your story?\n\nOne of the main inspirations for writing this story was living through a near-death experience when my appendix burst in 2011. I left it for 4 days before going to the hospital, which was a silly thing to do. Once I recovered and was well enough to leave the hospital, I was inspired to write a book, which I wanted to do for a long time.\n\nI decided that while I was not working and in further recovery I would start to write a book that consisted of a cross between fiction and personal experiences that I wanted to share in a relatable way. My mother passed away from cancer when I was 21 years old, so I felt this was an age where I had to grow as a person in many aspects of my life. It was a time where I transitioned as a person to find my own unique abilities which emerged as I learned more about myself and my capabilities.\n\nMy near-death health ordeal occurred just after the final release of the last Harry Potter film. At the time, I was a senior support worker for mental health and special needs clients. One of those clients with Downs Syndrome was a huge Harry Potter fan, and I would take him to the cinema to watch all of the Harry Potter series. In turn, I appreciated J.K. Rowling’s creation, and the three friends were inspired by her concept.\n\nAfter writing several chapters, and life “getting in the way,” I parked the book idea intending to return to it at some point. Then in 2020, I wanted to revisit the book and continue with the journey. I remembered that the reason I became a huge fan of fiction/fantasy/urban fantasy was due to my dear high school friend, Stefan, who introduced me to Dragonlance: The Chronicles, by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman. I was hooked! I knew that Stefan also wrote, both of us mostly writing lyrics for songs and poetry, amongst others, but I felt that if we collaborated this story could go in a direction that was much greater than doing it alone. I am so glad that Stefan accepted because we have rekindled our age-long relationship and have been able to do what we love while sharing it with the world.\n\nWhen Darien, Ecio, and Serenity wake up on their 21st birthday, they find out they are not who they thought they were, and they are destined to save the universe. What were the driving ideals behind the characters’ development throughout the story?\n\nI think there is something amazing about being surprised when you receive a gift that is unexpected and special and that brings you a sense of purpose. I know that I would never be able to “save the universe,” however, writing to create characters that may do just that offers Stefan and me a sense of hope.\n\nIn fantasy novels, it’s easy to get carried away with the magical powers characters have. How did you balance the use of supernatural powers?\n\nAlthough we have briefly touched on the supernatural powers of each character, we wanted to start off slowly by having our readers ease into\n\nCan you tell us more about what’s in store for the three friends and the direction of the second book?\n\nWe can definitely let you know that we are building momentum so that part 2 maintains a compelling storyline with the introduction of some new characters that add to the journey.\n\nIt will not be easy for Darien, Ecio, and Serenity. In our story, we look to bake in life experiences that people can relate to or learn from. This will hold true for the three friends and the other supporting characters.\n\nWithout giving too much away, the three friends still need to understand and learn about their newfound powers, along with understanding themselves. They also need to learn how to work together as one collective. Each character is a unique individual with their own strengths and weaknesses, which will become apparent in part 2.\n\nAuthor Links: GoodReads | X (Twitter) | Facebook | Website | Amazon\n\nInfinity Tales follows a seemingly ordinary cat who, after a series of mysterious events, ends up on a journey to help alleviate sadness in humans. What was the inspiration for the setup of your story?\n\nWhat inspired Leo in The Dark series and inspired me to write his stand-alone story was my real-life cat Tiggie. Tiggie came into my life during an uncertain time and helped me through it by just being there. He also had a rough life. He was more to me than just a pet, he was my best friend. When I had to make the difficult decision to ease his pain and let him cross the rainbow bridge, it hit me hard. The best way I could honor him was to write parts of his personality into Leo. Not only did I want to honor Tiggie, but I also wanted to honor all felines as I’ve been around cats my whole life. It was difficult to write, but I’m glad I didn’t give up.\n\nIn fantasy novels it’s easy to get carried away with the magical powers characters have. How did you balance the use of supernatural powers?\n\nAlthough Leo becomes supernatural that helps drive the story-line, my focus remained on the fact that he’s a cat and thinks differently than humans, even if he has some human qualities. Even though he may not be a normal cat, he still stays true to his self, taking the time to learn and understand the world around him along with his purpose.\n\nWhat were some ideas that were important for you to personify in your characters?\n\nThe most important personification of Leo was to think like a cat. To write the story through a feline’s perspective. Cats are often misunderstood for their independent personalities and odd behaviors. My hope is readers are able to view cats through a different lens and be able to understand them a little better as they all have unique personalities just like us humans.\n\nWhat is the next book that you are working on, and when will it be available?\n\nI’m working on editing the last book in The Dark series as well as a memoir of my journey as an author. I’m hoping they will be both available by the end of 2024 if not then early 2025.\n\nAuthor Links: GoodReads | Twitter | Facebook | Instagram | Pinterest | Website | Amazon\n\nIn A Sinister Love, by Spencer Hixon, we are introduced to Scribble, a demoness abruptly reassigned from her mundane clerical duties to a role she never anticipated: a Sinister on Earth. Tasked with tempting her assigned human, Paul, into sinning, Scribble struggles not from a lack of cunning, but because she tends to talk more than she tempts. Deciding that a physical presence might improve her odds, she assumes a succubus body with the help of her enigmatic new boss. As Scribble navigates her new form, she not only charms Paul into offering her a job but also grows unexpectedly close to him, leading to unforeseen emotional complications. Is her discomfort due to the new body, or could she be falling for a human?\n\nHixon’s portrayal of Scribble as an avid reader adds an unexpected layer of relatability to the demoness, making her journey from timidity to bravery quite compelling. Similarly, Paul is a thoughtfully crafted character whose struggles with mental health add depth and relevance to the narrative. The character of Rotworm is vividly realized—his sleazy demeanor is palpable, yet he delivers surprises that leave readers eager for more. While the novel excels in character development and a gripping plot, I feel that some areas seemed a bit underexplored and could benefit from further elaboration. Despite these minor gaps, this book remains a highly engaging read, especially for those who appreciate a blend of supernatural elements with human emotional dilemmas. Hixon’s work is a commendable addition to the genre, promising a level of intrigue that will keep readers looking forward to the next installment.\n\nSpencer Hixon’s A Sinister Love masterfully blends the supernatural with the profoundly human, crafting a narrative that is both entertaining and emotionally resonant. Through the eyes of Scribble, a demoness finding her footing among humans, readers are treated to a story that challenges the traditional boundaries of genre fiction. This book is sure to delight those who enjoy tales of personal growth, supernatural intrigue, and the complexities of love, making it a worthy addition to any reader’s collection.\n\nPages: 344 | ASIN : B0D1F6FS5K\n\nIn Joseph’s Coat, evil enters the home of a young couple when they adopt an orphan following the loss of their own baby. What was the inspiration for the setup of your story?\n\nI had written the MC years ago, but I knew something was missing, untold. I finally, after about nine years, realized the MC’s story needed to begin with his childhood. And his situation just created itself, if that makes sense. LOL.\n\nI felt this story was very well written. What’s your experience as a writer?\n\nThank you! I’m honored for you to say that. I’ve written since I was small. Sketching comic strip-style stories as a way to tell these stories. Then, during high school, I started to actually write them instead of sketching them. And have not been able to stop. I’ve had three novels/novellas that were published for which the contracts expired. Joseph’s Coat is my first novel since 2015.\n\nWhat were some of the emotional and moral guidelines you followed when developing your characters?\n\nI love this question. I’m not sure I ever had guidelines for emotions or morals. It all seemed to dictate itself. I did want to create a couple, though, who were deeply in love enough to withstand the pain of loss, and grief, and yet allow them high emotion that I hoped was real and relatable and, most of all, very human. As for morals, each character dictated their own if that makes sense. And, now that you mention it, maybe subconsciously incorporate a strong line between good and evil where, of course, the goodness of humanity would triumph.\n\nCan you give readers a glimpse inside book 2? When can fans expect to see it released?\n\nOh, this has been a trial! I had planned to skip in years for the child in the story to be much older; however, I felt I was missing too much of his history that ought to be told. SO…Book Two will be the growth of the newly adopted child in his new environment and a new antagonist to be introduced, this time one who will be a highly trusted friend who will be a huge threat to the family. And I’m working on it now, hoping to finish by the end of this year.\n\n​Author Links: GoodReads | Twitter | Facebook | Blog | Amazon"
