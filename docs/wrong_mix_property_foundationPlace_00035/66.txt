Zelenskyy spoke to the soldiers, thanked them for defending Ukraine and presented them with state awards.

In particular, Captain Illia Verhun, a gunner who was awarded the title of Hero of Ukraine received the Gold Star Order.

For reference: Since 24 February 2022, Verhun has been involved in countering Russia's armed aggression. He directly led anti-tank units during the liberation of the city of Trostianets in Sumy Oblast and participated in deterring Russian forces on the Izium front. Units under Verhun's leadership and with his personal participation destroyed a large number of Russian vehicles.

There was also a moment of silence to honour the fallen.
