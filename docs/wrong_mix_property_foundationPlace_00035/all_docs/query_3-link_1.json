Syrskyi emphasized that they are desperately fighting against the superior forces of the invaders and are a true example of courage and patriotism.\n\nThe Commander-in-Chief presented awards to the personnel of the 47th Separate Mechanized Brigade. He emphasized that the Magura warriors skillfully repel enemy attacks, effectively use firepower against enemy equipment and personnel, and steadfastly hold their lines and positions.\n\nRead also: Zelensky awards soldiers in Donetsk region and listens to reports on operational situation\n\nThe Commander-in-Chief also thanked the personnel of the 59th Separate Motorized Infantry Brigade, who, according to him, are \"strong in spirit, motivated and skillful warriors, reliably holding the defense and resolutely beating the aggressor.\"\n\n\"I thank all Ukrainian defenders who are now fighting for our freedom and independence.
