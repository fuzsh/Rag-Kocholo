This requirement will be waived, however, for applicants who either completed an in-residence bachelor’s, master’s, or doctoral degree program in the United Kingdom, United States, or Canada (excluding Quebec) or have at least three years of professional work experience using English as their primary language. If you fall into one of these categories, please include this information on your resume.\n\nAs part of a global university with locations and students from around the world, the School of Computer Science welcomes the diverse perspectives that international students bring to our programs.\n\nThe Graduate Certificate in Machine Learning & Data Science Foundations provides a unique opportunity for individuals nearly everywhere to earn a certificate at the intersection of AI, machine learning, and computational data science from one of the top ranked computer science schools in the country.\n\nTo help ensure you are fully prepared for the admissions process and, if admitted, for success as a student, this section provides detailed information about requirements for international applicants.\n\nWe look forward to reviewing your application.\n\nThe Graduate Certificate in Machine Learning & Data Science Foundations considers for admission international applicants who reside within, or outside of, the domestic United States. International applicants who reside within or outside of the domestic United States are advised of the following information and additional requirements for international applicants to the program.\n\nStudent Visas\n\nSince this program is fully online, enrollment in this program will not qualify students for any type of visa to enter or remain in the United States for any purpose.\n\nTime and Attendance Requirement\n\nClasses for the program will be taught on the U.S. Eastern Time zone schedule, and students must be available to attend all live classes, regardless of location.\n\nU.S. Sanctions; U.S. Sanctioned Countries\n\nIndividuals who are the target of U.S. sanctions or who are ordinarily resident in a U.S. sanctioned country or who live or expect to live in a U.S. sanctioned country while participating in the program are not eligible for admission to this program due to legal restrictions/prohibitions and should not apply. U.S sanctioned countries are currently Belarus, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Syria and the following regions of Ukraine: Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk. In addition, all or a portion of this program may not be available to individuals who are ordinarily resident of certain countries due to legal restrictions.\n\nApplications received from these individuals will not be accepted. As well, if an individual is admitted to the program and subsequently the individual becomes the target of U.S. sanctions, ordinarily resident of a U.S. sanctioned country or lives in a U.S. sanctioned country while participating in the program (or otherwise becomes ordinarily resident of country in which the program is not available due to legal restrictions), the individual’s continued enrollment in the program may be terminated and/or restricted (due to U.S. legal restrictions/prohibitions) and the individual may not be able to complete the program.\n\nLicensure in Various Jurisdictions\n\nFrom time to time Carnegie Mellon reviews the licensing requirements of various jurisdictions in order to assess whether Carnegie Mellon may be precluded from making the program available to applicants that are residents of one or more of these jurisdictions prior to Carnegie Mellon obtaining the relevant license(s). Affected applicants from these jurisdictions, if any, will be notified prior to enrollment if Carnegie Mellon determines that it is unable to make the program available to them for this reason.\n\nValue Added Tax (VAT) and Other Taxes\n\nThe tuition, required fees and other amounts quoted for this program do not include charges for applicable Taxes (hereinafter defined). The student is responsible for payment of all applicable Taxes (if any) relating to the tuition, required fees and other amounts required to be paid to Carnegie Mellon for the program, including any Taxes payable as a result of the student’s payment of such Taxes.\n\nFurther, the student must timely make all payments due to Carnegie Mellon without deduction for Taxes, unless the deduction is required by law. If the student is required under applicable law to withhold Taxes from any payment due to Carnegie Mellon, the student is responsible for timely (i) paying to Carnegie Mellon such additional amounts as are necessary so that Carnegie Mellon receives the full amount that it would have received absent such withholding, and (ii) providing to Carnegie Mellon all documentation, if any, necessary to permit the student and/or Carnegie Mellon to claim the application of available tax treaty benefits (for Carnegie Mellon review and completion, if warranted and acceptable).\n\nTaxes mean any taxes, governmental charges, duties, or similar additions or deductions of any kind, including all use, income, goods and services, value added, excise and withholding taxes assessed by or payable in the student’s country of residence and/or country of payment (but does not include any U.S. federal, state or local taxes)."
