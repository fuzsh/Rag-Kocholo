        "text": "The U.S. Government has imposed a variety of significant financial and export/import sanctions on Russia, Belarus, and parts of Ukraine. Some of these sanctions may impact certain University personnel and activities. Members of the research and educational community having or planning activities involving Russia, Belarus, or Ukraine should contact the Export Controls Office (ECO) as early as possible, and definitely before attempting to send any tangible goods, software, technologies, or funds to recipients located in these countries. The ECO will assess the applicable restrictions, summarized below, and explore potential options for requesting U.S. Government authorization.\n\nExport and Re-Export Restrictions for Russia & Belarus\n\nThe U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry (BIS) and Security has amended the Export Administration Regulations to generally prohibit the direct and indirect export of a variety of luxury goods, microelectronics, telecommunications items, sensors, navigation equipment, avionics, marine equipment, aircraft components, and related technology and software to Russia and Belarus.\n\nAnyone planning to ship or carry tangible goods, software, or technology to Russia or Belarus must first consult with the ECO. Not all items are covered by these evolving restrictions, but determining which items are subject to which specific requirements requires a case-by-case technical regulatory analysis conducted by the ECO.\n\nDue in part to these export restrictions, FedEx, UPS, and DHL have suspended all shipping services to Russia until further notice. Passenger air travel into and out of Russia also has grown extraordinarily difficult and expensive, both because certain countries are choosing to suspend flights and because U.S. export controls are impacting the movement and maintenance of commercial aircraft.\n\nFinancial and Banking Restrictions\n\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) has also imposed targeted transactional sanctions against various banking groups, corporations, government organizations, and individuals in Russia and Belarus. Moreover, the White House prohibited new investments in the Russian economy from the U.S. or by a U.S. person, as well as the “exportation, reexportation, sale, or supply, directly or indirectly,” from the U.S., or by a U.S. person, wherever located, of U.S. dollar-denominated banknotes to Russia, among other transactions.\n\nUniversity students, staff, and faculty are likely to find that many transactions—payments relating to tuition, external sales, IP licenses, sponsored projects, purchases, credit/debit card use, etc.—involving accounts located in Russia or Belarus are becoming extraordinarily difficult or even impossible to complete. Any University employee planning to send or receive money to or from Russia or Belarus must consult first with the ECO.\n\nExport/Import Restrictions for Certain Regions in Ukraine\n\nExecutive Order 14065 imposes a general prohibition on exports and imports to and from the “so-called Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) or Luhansk People’s Republic (LNR) regions of Ukraine” (as was already the case for the Crimea region). This default prohibition applies to all “goods, services, or technology,” regardless of whether money is changing hands., OFAC has issued several general licenses that allow certain humanitarian aid and related activity to continue, but these licenses do not permit most educational and research activities. Accordingly, all travel, shipments, and collaborations involving the Crimea, Donetsk, or Luhansk region must have prior ECO approval.\n\nDue in part to these restrictions, FedEx, UPS, and DHL have suspended all shipping services to and from Ukraine until further notice.\n\nAlthough the U.S. Government has not added specific universities in the restricted regions to a federal restricted parties list, the ECO has provisionally identified the following academic institutions as falling within the scope of the export/import restrictions:\n\nUniversities in Crimea Region\n\nNameAddress\n\nUniversities in Donetsk Region\n\nNameAddressDonbas Agrarian Professional College of Luhansk National Agrarian UniversitySvobodi St., 23, Slavyansk, Donetsk Region, 84122Donbas National Academy of Civil Engineering and ArchitectureVulytsya Heroyiv Nebesnoyi Sotni, 14, Kramatorsk, Donetsk Region, 84333Donbas State Engineering AcademyVulutsua Akademichna, 72, Kramatorsk, Donetsk Region, 84300Donetsk National Medical UniversityIllicha Ave., 16, Donetsk, Donetsk Region, 83000Donetsk National Technical UniversityShybankova Sq., 2, Pokrovsk, Donetsk Region, 85300Mariupol Electromechanical Technical SchoolZelinsky St., 11, Mariupol, Donetsk Region, 87525Mariupol State UniversityBudivel’nykiv Ave., Mariupol, Donetsk Region, 87500\n\nUniversities in Luhansk Region"
