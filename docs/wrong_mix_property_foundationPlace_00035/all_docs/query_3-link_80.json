        "text": "The history of the club dates back to 1936 when a team of Donbas Pitmen was formed and named after the pioneer of Stakhanovite movement, coal miner Aleksei Stakhanov. The backbone of the team was formed on the basis of Dynamo Gorlovka and Dynamo Stalino players.\n\nStakhanovets made its debut on May 12, 1936 in Gorlovka against Dynamo Odessa in the Ukrainian demonstration team league. The Pitmen had the following line-up: goalkeeper - Sergey Razdorozhnyuk, defenders - Mikhail Boychenko, Georgiy Konstantinovskiy, midfielders - Pavel Evtekhov, Konstantin Paschenko, Bespalov, strikers - Adam Korotynskiy, Mikhail Paschenko, Nikolay Naumov, Fedor Manov, Boris Terentyev. The first goal was scored by Mikhail Paschenko, with the final score being 2-3 for the away team.\n\nStakhanovets played its first official game in the USSR championships on May 24, 1936 in a Group B away game in Kazan, where it lost to the local Dynamo team 4-1 (the Pitmen' first goal was scored by Fedor Manov).\n\nIn 1938, Stakhanovets gained the right to represent the Donbas region in the strongest group. The team, strengthened by the best local players, finished 11th and 12th for three years. At the end of the 1940 season, a distinguished title of Master of Sports was awarded to the following players of the team: Nikolay Kuznetsov, Nikolay Kononenko, Georgiy Mazanov, Georgiyi Bikezin, Grigoriy Balaba and Anton Yakovlev.\n\nIn June 1941, the Great Patriotic War started. Many of the Stakhanovets' players went to the front or worked at defence plants. Ivan Ustinov, Ivan Putyatov, Ivan Gorobets, Mikhail Vasin and some others were killed in action.\n\nThe city of Stalino was liberated on September 8, 1943. Two months later, it hosted the first match in its post-war period.\n\nIn 1945, Stakhanovets was included in the second group of the USSR championship. The team had to be virtually rebuilt from scratch. The squad with experienced Nikolay Kuznetsov, Georgiy Bikezin and Petr Yurchenko was joined by Oleg Zhukov, Valentin Liventsev, Evgeniy Shpinev, Nikolay Anisimov, Konstantin Skripchenko, Vasiliy Bryushyn, and Alexander Andrenko.\n\nShakhtar spent 1946 and 1947 in the second group of the championship. The consequences of the war were still affecting not only the team squad, but also the training process.\n\nIn July 1946, Stakhanovets sports club was transformed into Shakhtar club, uniting coal enterprises sports teams of all the country's basins. The strongest Donbas club was named Shakhtar (Stalino).\n\nIn 1947, the team was headed by an experienced Moscow coach Alexey Kostylev. Under his leadership, Shakhtar became runners-up among the 13 participants in the Ukrainian area. The Pitmen's consistent results allowed them to claim a place among the best teams in the country, where the Donetsk team was eventually included in 1949.\n\nBut their first season after the return was notably unsuccessful. Shakhtar suffered 21 defeats in 34 games. The results led to replacing the coach with Viktor Novikov taking charge of the team. The core of the team included Alexander Alpatov, Dmitriy Ivanov, Yuriy Petrov, Viktor Fomin, Nikolay Samarin Viktor Kolesnikov, Leonid Savinov, Evgeniy Pestov and others. Shakhtar's game improved and was transformed into advancing to the 11th place with 33 points.\n\n1951 saw the team getting the 3rd spot. For the first time in history, the Pitmen made it to the victory podium. That success is greatly attributed to Alexander Ponomarev - a great Soviet striker and Donbas native.\n\nThe team also did well in the USSR Cup, reaching the semi-finals. Having signed up several new players, Shakhtar went on its first tour abroad to Bulgaria and Romania in October - November of that year.\n\nAll Shakhtar's matches of the 1952 USSR championship were held in Moscow, which greatly affected the results. After the recent triumph this season turned out unsuccessful, and the team started the following season in class B with a new coach - Alexander Ponomarev, who had finished his playing career. Fundamentally refreshed, this squad took two years to return to the top. This period enabled the team performance to become more fluid and consistent.\n\nIn the latter half of the 1950s, Shakhtar consistently ranked among the top ten teams of Soviet football. Striving for more led to a change of its coach, but the team's best result during this time was 7th place in the USSR championships 1955 and 1956 and reaching the semi-finals of the USSR Cup 1959/60.\n\nIn 1960, Oleg Oshenkov became the new coach of Shakhtar. The experienced professional bet on the local talent and mustered footballers. The leaders of Oshenkov's team were Gennadiy Snegirev, Nikolay Golovko, Vladimir Salkov, Oleg Kolosov, Anatoliy Rodin, Valentin Sapronov, Yuriy Ananchenko, Boris Strelkov, Vyacheslav Alyabyev, and Vitaliy Savelyev.\n\nIn 1961, Shakhtar won its first USSR Cup. In the finals the Pitmen beat the USSR champions of the previous season - Torpedo (Moscow) - 3-1 with a goal by Anatoliy Rodin and a brace by Yuriy Ananchenko.\n\n1962 was equally successful. The team headed by Oleg Oshenkov once again won the USSR Cup. In the cup decider, the Pitmen defeated Znamya Truda from Orekhovo-Zuevо. The following year, Shakhtar reached the Cup final for the third time in a row, but this time they lost to Spartak (Moscow) 1-2.\n\nIt was during that period that Shakhtar gained the Cup team reputation. The Donetsk squad also confirmed their strength in the USSR championship. In 1964, its outstanding and confident performance culminated in the fifth place in the standings.\n\nIn 1966, Shakhtar went undefeated for ten rounds, with the goalkeeper Yuriy Korotkikh keeping a clean sheet for 913 minutes. His record is among the top three clean-sheet streaks of domestic goalkeepers in the USSR history, and was marked at the European level as well.\n\nThe team performance level significantly improved with signing up Valeriy Lobanovskiy and Oleg Bazilevich. Lobanovskiy became the Pitmen' top scorer in 1967.\n\nThe era of Oshenkov was drawing to an end. In the middle of the 1968 season, Lobanovskiy and Bazilevich finished their respective careers and left Shakhtar, and in October 1969 Oshenkov was replaced by Yuriy Voynov as the head coach.\n\nIn the late 1960s, the only trophies that Shakhtar managed to acquire were the gold medals of its second team in 1967 and 1969 (and silver in 1968). The second team was coached by Yuriy Zakharov.\n\nIn 1971, the Pitmen left the Higher League. During that time the team went through several coaches including Yuriy Voynov, Artem Falyan, Nikolay Morozov and Oleg Bazilevich.\n\nIt was Bazilevich who significantly changed the squad and managed to bring Shakhtar back to the ranks of the strongest Soviet teams. The key players of the time were local trainees, as well as players from various places: Yuriy Degterev, Alexander Vasin, Viktor Zvyagintsev, Anatoliy Konkov, Vladimir Safonov, Mikhail Sokolovskiy, Valeriy Yaremchenko, Yuriy Dudinskiy, Yuri Gubich, Valeriy Gorbunov, Vitaliy Starukhin and others.\n\nIn 1974, the Pitmen were headed by a recent coach of their second team Yuriy Zakharov, who was replaced by Vladimir Salkov in August.\n\nOn November 9, in the final match of the 1975 season, Shakhtar beat the then current Cup Winners Ararat (Yerevan) 3-0 and claimed the 2nd spot.\n\nThat decade became one of the most successful in Shakhtar's Soviet history. In 1976, the team made its debut in European club competitions. In the UEFA Cup round of 64, the Pitmen defeated German Dynamo, in the round of 32 - Hungary's Honvéd SE, and in the Last 16, the team was defeated by the future competition winners Juventus, Italy.\n\nThe leading roles in Shakhtar belonged to Nikolay Fedorenko, Vladimir Rogovskiy, Viktor Kondratov, Mikhail Sokolovskiy and other players. In 1977, the team finished fifth in the championship, and Yuriy Degterev was named the Goalkeeper of the Year.\n\nThe following years were marked by major successes. Shakhtar retained the top spot for two consecutive seasons. In 1978, the Pitmen took 3rd place in the championship and reached the USSR Cup final. In 1979, head coach Viktor Nosov led the team to becoming the league runners-up with Vitaliy Starukhin being the top scorer with 26 goals, and voted Footballer of the Year.\n\nDuring the squad's refreshment period, Shakhtar had dropped in the championship standings. Nevertheless, the team won the USSR Cup twice during that time. In the Cup final 1980, the Pitmen beat Dynamo (Tbilisi) (with goals scored by Starukhin and Pyanykh), and in 1983 - Metallist (Kharkov) (the winning goal was scored by Sergey Yaschenko).\n\nA prominent result of the decade was Shakhtar's successful performance in the Cup Winners' Cup 1983/84, where the team reached the quarterfinals. The same year, the Pitmen also won the USSR Super Cup. The following season, the Donetsk squad reiterated its Cup team status, reaching the competition final.\n\nRinat Akhmetov became the president of Shakhtar on October 11, 1996. His name is closely associated with the further growth and prosperity of the club. Having set the goal of creating a European class team in Donetsk, the new president has done everything possible to achieve it year after year.\n\nThe orange-and-black team performance in Europe in the late 1990s was rather unsuccessful. But in the year 2000, coach Viktor Prokopenko led the team to a group stage of the Champions League for the first time in history, after the Pitmen beat SK Slavia Prague on aggregate. Grouped with Italy's Lazio, England's Arsenal and Czech Sparta, the Donetsk team finished third.\n\nIn 1999, a modern Children and Youth School of FC Shakhtar was created and it became one of the best sports training facilities in Europe. It was named Kirsha and had been erected on the site of the old training base. The Shakhtar Central Stadium was also upgraded in accordance with UEFA requirements.\n\nIn 2002, the Pitmen headed by Italian coach Nevio Scala won the Ukrainian Premier League title for the first time. The team was subsequently coached by Valeriy Yaremchenko, Germany's Bernd Schuster, and starting May 2004 - Romania's Mircea Lucescu.\n\nShakhtar won the domestic Cup in 1997, 2001, and 2002. The victory in the final match of the tournament marked the Pitmen's first major achievement with Mircea Lucescu at the helm.\n\nIn 2005, the Donetsk club once again won the domestic league title. That same summer, the team beat Dynamo Kyiv 4-3 in the penalty shoot-out for the orange-and-black team's first ever Ukrainian Super Cup.\n\nIn the 2006/07 season, the Pitmen became the runners-up in the domestic league and lost the Cup final game. But in 2008, Shakhtar claimed the domestic treble: the Premier League, the Cup and the Super Cup. And in a match against FC Kharkiv, Fernandinho scored Shakhtar's 1,000th Ukrainian Premier League goal.\n\nIn the 2008/09 season, Shakhtar did not make it to the Champions League knockout stage and continued in the UEFA Cup. The Donetsk team played against Dynamo Kyiv in the semifinals of the tournament. An away draw (1-1) and a home win (2-1) paved the way to the Cup final, with Werder Bremen as opponents. The Pitmen claimed a 2-1 win with goals scored by Luiz Adriano and Jadson in extra time.\n\nThe opening of Donbass Arena took place on August 29, 2009. The cost of the project is about US $ 400 million. This modern arena with the seating capacity of 52,898, falls into the Elite category of football stadiums.\n\nThe first official game at the Donbass Arena was held on September 27, 2009. The opening football match at the stadium was a Premier League game between Shakhtar and Kyiv's Obolon, which ended in a major 4-0 victory for the Pitmen. The first goal at the Donetsk Arena was scored by Jadson.\n\nIn the 2009/10 season, Shakhtar once again claimed the Ukrainian league title, its fourth in six years. The Donetsk team started their next football season with a 7-1 Super Cup of Ukraine victory over Tavriya.\n\nIn the 2010/11 season, the Orange-and-Black reached the Champions League knockout stage for the first time in history, and lost to Barcelona in the quarterfinals.\n\nThe Pitmen celebrated their Premier League triumph two games away from the season end, also defeating Dynamo Kyiv 2-0 in the Ukrainian Cup final. Thus, Shakhtar claimed its third golden double in history.\n\nIn the 2011/12 season, Shakhtar finished fourth in the Champions League group stage, once again becoming the domestic league winnners and beating Metalurh Donetsk in the Cup final.\n\nThe 2012/13 season was a record one for Shakhtar. The team became the Super Cup winners and won all the matches in the first half of the season (enjoying the longest winning streak of 24 games and longest scoring streak of 34 games).\n\nThe Donetsk team secured its championship title four rounds before the end of the season, beating their closest opponents by a wide margin. Furthermore, the team won their ninth Ukrainian Cup, matching the domestic record. Shakhtar also reached the Champions League round of 16.\n\nIn the 2013/14 season, the Pitmen finished third in their Champions League group, failing to make it past the Europa League round of 32. However, one round before the end of the season, Shakhtar won the Premier League title for the fifth consecutive time, their ninth in history.\n\nDue to the military conflict in the Donbas, the team relocated to Kyiv for the 2014/15 season, hosting most of its nominal home games at the Arena Lviv.\n\nDespite the lack of a home field and their fans, the Pitmen reached the Champions League round of 16.
