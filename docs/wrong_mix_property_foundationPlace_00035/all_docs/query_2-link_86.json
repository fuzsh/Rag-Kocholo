        "text": "Summary\n\nOn October 10, Victoria Amelina, a prize winning author, sent out a series of urgent tweets. “I’m in Kyiv and alive,” she started off, explaining that she was filming Russian strikes on Kyiv as best as she could. She tweeted out a list of the buildings damaged or destroyed during the attack, including the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv, the Khanenko Museum, Kyiv Picture Gallery, National Philharmonic of Ukraine, Maksymovych Scientific Library, and Kyiv City Teacher’s House. Her anguish at these losses and her understanding of why they had been targeted was crystal clear: “I know they want us, Ukrainian writers, to disappear . . . they target Ukrainian culture.”\n\nCulture—past, present, and future—is on the front lines of the brutal war on Ukraine and cultural erasure is a central tactic of Russia’s campaign of aggression and violence in Ukraine, which has gone on for over eight years. Russian President Vladimir Putin’s repeated false claims that a distinct Ukrainian history, language, and culture do not exist, serve as one of his central justifications for waging war on and occupying Ukraine. He seeks not only to control Ukrainian territory, but to erase Ukrainian culture and identity, and to impose Russian language, as well as a manipulated, chauvinistic, militaristic version of Russia’s culture, history, and worldview, on Ukrainian people.\n\nOleksandra Yakubenko, currently working on PEN America’s efforts to support Ukrainian artists at risk and an expert on Ukrainian culture, thinks that Putin’s efforts to destroy Ukrainian culture have had the opposite effect. She explained how her Ukrainian identity was “reawakened” in 2014 in the aftermath of the Maidan Revolution that ousted President Viktor Yanukovych—what Ukrainians call the Revolution of Dignity—and following Russia’s occupation of Crimea and parts of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Since then, she noticed “cultural life just bloomed and bloomed.” She ascribed this strengthening, in part, to the vitality of Ukraine’s cultural sector and their participation in and support for democracy and human rights, and later the war effort. She now believes that “our culture and our physical survival are intertwined—they go hand in hand.”\n\nIn an interview from July 2022, the Ukrainian novelist, poet, and essayist Yuri Andrukhovych shared similar views on Ukrainian culture and writing as a bulwark against Russian aggression: “It’s quite ironic that each attempt Russia has made to destroy Ukrainian culture has had the opposite effect . . . There is now a widespread tendency among Ukrainians to speak entirely in Ukrainian . . . New poems, novels, stories, essays, etc. will be written in Ukrainian, and of course they will be read and discussed. It is the best way to overcome the Russian aggressors and to survive in that humanitarian catastrophe they have brought upon us.”\n\nRussia has carried out extensive, coordinated actions to marginalize, undermine, and ultimately eliminate the tangible and intangible manifestations of Ukrainian culture since its illegal occupation of Crimea, and parts of Luhansk and Donetsk. Russia’s actions, which included damaging important cultural buildings and undermining the teaching of and in Ukrainian in those territories, now serve as a blueprint for their cultural erasure efforts in areas they have invaded and occupied since the full-scale war against Ukraine began on February 24, 2022. They have been supplemented by physical destruction of cultural infrastructure on a massive scale.\n\nThis is not the first time that the Russian government has sought to destroy Ukrainian culture. Ukrainian thinkers, writers, linguists, artists, and scholars over the last three centuries have faced Imperial Russian and Soviet efforts to deny, assimilate, and eliminate their culture and language. Olesya Khromeychuk, a historian and director of the Ukrainian Institute in London, detailed efforts by various Russian tsars to eliminate Ukrainian culture, including banning Ukrainian-language publications, prohibiting cultural societies, and exiling or imprisoning public intellectuals. She explained that “writers, poets, and artists became the figures who shaped national identity.”\n\nDeliberate attacks on culture, including efforts to erase culture, by state and non-state actors, are not new. The bombing of Guernica, a Basque town in northern Spain, by the German air force in support of General Franco during the Spanish Civil War; the systematic destruction of Polish libraries and archives by the Nazis during World War II; attacks on cultural heritage sites, including Palmyra in Syria, by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) are among the better-known efforts to destroy and erase culture during wars. In 2016, the International Criminal Court (ICC) handed down its first conviction of a war crime “consisting in intentionally directing attacks against religious and historic buildings in Timbuktu, Mali.”\n\nThe occupation and war have wrought an incalculable toll on Ukraine’s cultural voices, creators, and workers. They are amongst the thousands killed and injured by Russian attacks, or detained and threatened by Russian forces. Many have fled their homes and communities to reach safety; they have lost loved ones, homes, and precious possessions. They have been cut off from their creative communities and colleagues, and they have seen their studios, galleries, and exhibition spaces destroyed, damaged, and closed. The need to focus on survival has frequently taken precedence over creative work and even when Ukrainian culture is not being deliberately targeted, the war has deeply disrupted creative production.\n\nRussian bombardments and other attacks have destroyed and damaged hundreds of places where Ukrainians enjoy and experience culture, sites small and large, local and national, from community cultural houses to fine art museums. Some of these attacks were deliberate, targeted attacks, such as on Mariupol’s Academic Regional Drama Theater, which was sheltering hundreds of civilians, including children, when Russian aircraft dropped two bombs on it in March 2022. In the Kyiv region, in the first days of the Russian assault, a Russian missile struck the Ivankiv Historical and Local History Museum, setting it on fire, the only building in the village to be struck during that time.\n\nRussian forces have also repeatedly and indiscriminately attacked densely populated areas using explosive weapons and cluster bombs, which have been banned by an international treaty. These attacks have caused widespread death and injury, as well as massive destruction and damage to civilian infrastructure, including cultural heritage sites, book printing houses, libraries, and places of spiritual interest. The damage and destruction cannot be seen as simply incidental, collateral damage resulting from Russian military operations targeting Ukrainian military targets. Rather, the magnitude of the destruction suggests a deliberate campaign to destroy civilian infrastructure, rendering some cities barely habitable, and an attempt to destroy civilian morale.\n\nBoth the targeted and indiscriminate attacks carried out by the Russian military against civilian infrastructure in Ukraine are violations of International humanitarian law (IHL) and, per the findings of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine, actions by Russian forces amount to war crimes. The conduct of Russia’s military and occupation forces also violates international human rights law, including Ukrainians’ right to culture.\n\nUkrainian writers, poets, artists, and cultural defenders demonstrate remarkable resilience and resistance in the face of this brutal conflict and attack against their Ukrainian culture. Many draw strength from their connections to Ukrainian culture and are actively seeking new ways to produce and promote culture. Writers are writing wartime diaries. There are literary readings in bookstores against the backdrop of air-raid sirens, and concerts in metro stations doubling as bomb shelters. “Good Evening (Where Are You From?),” also known by its popular name, “Good evening, we are from Ukraine,” is a song by the electronic duo ProBass and Hardi. It was released just before the start of the war, and it now plays in bomb shelters; the phrase is printed on T-shirts and trends on Twitter, and is often used by officials, including Vitaliy Kim, the governor of the southern region of Mykolaiv, when they address the Ukrainian people, signifying and strengthening Ukrainian resilience. Many believe that the survival of Ukraine as a country and people is inextricably linked with the survival of its culture, and they carry that burden with them. Tamara Shevchuk, a painter, graphic designer, and art teacher, works in a village in the Kyiv region that was occupied by the Russians for 24 days. She said: “War does not spare anyone, and the cultural front is just as important as the military one.”\n\nA War of Cultural Erasure\n\nPresident Putin, senior Russian officials, government think tanks, and pro-government public intellectuals have repeatedly denied that Ukraine exists as a nation or that Ukrainians have an identity and culture distinct from that of Russia and Russians. This claim has been used to justify the war and occupation and negate Ukraine’s claim to sovereign nationhood. This rhetoric dates back to Russian Imperial and Soviet times. During Soviet rule Ukrainians were subjected to a deliberate attempt to destroy them as a nation that included efforts to suppress their language.\n\nMarjana Varchuk, the director of communications at The Khanenko Museum in Kyiv, which was partially damaged in an airstrike on October 10, 2022, agreed. She said: “Destroying our culture is the purpose of everything the Russians are doing. Culture and language strengthen our nation, they remind us of our history. That’s why the Russians are shelling our monuments, our museums, and our history. That’s what they’re fighting with. They want to destroy everything and substitute our history. In fact, the main problem is our common post-Soviet period heritage, when the Ukrainian language was banned for 70 years. At least 400 years before that, the Ukrainian language, literature, theater, everything associated with our history, was banned and destroyed by the Russians who substituted the truth with a lie.”\n\nIn the current context, Russian denialism re-emerged prominently 14 years ago, in relation to potential NATO membership for Ukraine, which the Russian government has always vehemently opposed. During a 2008 NATO Summit, Putin said, “Ukraine is not even a state! What is Ukraine? Part of its territory is Eastern Europe, and part, and a significant one, was donated by us.”\n\nAfter Russia’s occupation of Crimea in 2014, Putin justified the action by claiming Crimea is “an inseparable part of Russia” that reflects Russia and the region’s “shared history and pride.” At the same time, the Russian Institute for Strategic Studies (RISS), a think tank under the Russian presidential administration, published a collection of essays titled Ukraine is Russia, which was “dedicated to the concept of unity of the Russian world” and describes “Ukrainian-ness” as “a peculiar South Russian” regional concept.\n\nIn a July 2021 essay published on the Kremlin website, Putin claimed that there is no historic basis for the “idea of Ukrainian people as a nation separate from the Russians,” that Russians and Ukrainians are “one people,” and that no Ukrainian nation existed prior to Soviet Russia’s creation of it. In Putin’s view, everything and everyone identified as Ukrainian is effectively fiction, which must be eliminated, and Ukraine must be returned to the so-called “Russian World.”\n\nTo further delegitimize Ukrainian national identity and culture and justify the invasion, Russia resorted to the demonization of Ukrainian culture by evoking Nazism. Putin and the pro-Putin ideological elite have described Ukrainian political leadership and Ukrainian people as “Nazis,” with Russia originally describing its military goal to “denazify the country.” In this grotesquely contorted framing, Ukrainian culture develops and nourishes “Nazism” by a so-called “systemic glorification of Nazism” through rituals, literature, history, culture, and media.\n\nRussia has made clear that the elimination of culture is an explicit target of its campaign in Ukraine and has used this specious charge of “Nazism” as justification: “Denazification of the mass of the population consists in re-education, which is achieved by ideological repression (suppression) of Nazi attitudes and strict censorship: not only in the political sphere, but also necessarily in the sphere of culture and education.” This will include “the withdrawal of Ukrainian educational materials, the establishment of pro-Russian memorials, commemorative signs, monuments, and imposition of a Russian information space. Ukrainians should be punished for understanding that they exist as a separate people and for participating in Ukrainian cultural life, including by death, imprisonment, or sentences in labor camps.”\n\nRussia’s leadership has further sought to justify its actions in Ukraine with false claims of widespread and pervasive attacks and discrimination against Ukraine’s Russian speakers, a population that Russia regards as ethnically Russian (of note, Putin’s claim that Ukrainian Russian speakers possess an ethnic identity distinct from their neighbors contradicts his assertion that all Ukrainians are ethnically indistinguishable from Russians). Putin has falsely alleged that the Ukrainian government sought to “root out the Russian language and culture” and that “people who identify as Russians and want to preserve their identity, language, and culture are getting the signal that they are not wanted in Ukraine.”\n\nYesypenko’s arrest after participating in a Shevchenko memorial event links to a long history of resistance associated with the national poet. In the 1960s, Ukrainians peacefully demonstrated against the Soviet regime by gathering at monuments to Shevchenko on March 9 and 10 to commemorate his life. They would read poems, sing Ukrainian songs, and lay flowers. These gatherings required courage as they could, and frequently did, lead to persecution.\n\nIn this spirit, residents of Crimea gathered near monuments to Shevchenko to mark the 200th anniversary of his life on March 9, 2014, and to protest the Russian occupation. Small protests have continued annually, although the Russian authorities prohibited the gatherings and prosecuted participants, including for flying the Ukrainian flag or singing the national anthem. Occupying authorities eventually started organizing their own “official” events near the monuments in order to elevate Russian culture and preempt the Crimean cultural gatherings. They displayed Russian flags, gave speeches, and described Shevchenko as “a Russian writer” and “a unifying image of the three Slavic peoples.”\n\nRussian authorities have also attempted to suppress the use of Crimean Tatar and Ukrainian languages in schools. Officials have pressured children and their parents not to request Crimean Tatar- or Ukrainian-language instruction, and instruction in these languages, especially Ukrainian, has decreased. In 2017, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) expressed concerns about “restrictions faced by Crimean Tatars and ethnic Ukrainians in exercising their economic, social, and cultural rights, particularly the rights to work, to express their own identity and culture, and to education in the Ukrainian language.”\n\nRussian authorities have banned access to independent media and Ukrainian- and Crimean Tatar-language broadcasts, replacing the content with Russian programming and a pro-Russian Crimean Tatar-language station. The Crimean Human Rights Group has reported numerous efforts to block popular Ukrainian online media. In April 2021, they reported that 22 Ukrainian websites were completely unavailable in Crimea. They have also documented various efforts to jam Ukrainian FM radio station signals, again limiting access to Ukrainian media in Crimea.\n\nRussian occupation authorities are also undertaking large-scale construction at the ancient archaeological complex of Tauric Chersonese located near Sevastopol, a landmark which Putin ordered to be put under direct Russian control in 2015. The site is a city founded by Greeks in the fifth century B.C., which stood until the 15th century, and contains ruins and artifacts from the Greek, Roman, and Byzantine periods. It is included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. Russian authorities have conducted illegal excavations, added buildings and infrastructure directly on top of some ruins, and developed entertainment venues at the site to attract visitors, in an effort to create “one of the largest [Russian] federal cultural centers,” according to one of the officials involved in the development. Putin has referenced the site as part of messaging aimed to falsely suggest deep historical ties between Russian and Crimea, describing the site as a “”Russian Mecca” from which a unitary Russian national state, and, in fact, the Russian nation emerged.”\n\nSpecific Efforts to Eradicate Crimean Tatar Culture\n\nRussian efforts to eradicate culture in Crimea have included systematically eliminating the identity, language, and culture of the Crimean Tatar community. The Crimean Tatars are indigenous Muslims who have suffered a long history of repression, violence, and persecution, including mass deportation from Crimea by the USSR after World War II. Alim Aliyev is a Ukrainian-Crimean Tatar human rights defender, journalist, deputy general director of the Ukrainian Institute, and board member of PEN Ukraine. He provided a stark description of Russian efforts to destroy Ukrainian and Tatar culture: “Attempts are being made to turn the people of Crimea into speechless citizens of Russia by changing their identity. Languages have been banned and cultural heritage destroyed.”\n\nShortly after the occupation began, the authorities also banned the large public gatherings traditionally held by Crimean Tatars every year to remember and mark the anniversary of the Sürgün, or Stalin’s mass deportation of the Crimean Tatar people in May 1944.\n\nRussian occupying forces have systematically attacked Crimea’s cultural heritage, taking over 4,095 sites of national and local importance and including them in Russia’s cultural heritage protection system. In some cases, this has resulted in significant harm to protected cultural sites. The occupying authorities have also unlawfully transferred artworks and artifacts from Crimea for exhibitions in numerous cities in Russia, and undertaken unauthorized archaeological excavations or mounted construction initiatives on archaeological and cultural heritage sites, including some dating to medieval and ancient times. These activities may infringe on the article 9 of Second Protocol to the 1954 Hague Convention, which prohibits such activity except where it is necessary to “safeguard, record or preserve cultural property.”\n\nAmong the architectural monuments on which Russian authorities have undertaken concerning construction work is the famous 16th-century Khan’s Palace, or Hansaray, a significant emblem of Crimean Tatar culture. Experts have criticized the construction as threatening the monument’s conservation. What Russian officials claim is “restoration” work to preserve the palace, instead, has involved the removal of original oak ceiling beams and handmade roofing tiles, and damage to wall frescoes. Experts claim the contractors hired to do the work do not have restoration experience, and there is no evidence that necessary expert assessments were conducted. In a media interview, Crimean Tatar rights lawyer Emil Kurbedinov described the construction as “an unjustified attack on the historical heritage of the Crimean Tatars, a site of cultural heritage.” In February 2022, Russian authorities jailed Crimean Tatar civic activist and architect Edem Dudakov, who had been following the construction work closely, after he posted messages on Facebook criticizing the construction work.\n\nRepression of Artists, Writers, and Cultural Workers as a Tactic of Cultural Erasure\n\nSince the unlawful occupation in 2014, writers, artists, and other cultural figures, especially those who criticize the occupation or separatist forces, have been illegally detained, imprisoned, and tortured in an effort to silence them and to stop them from writing and producing creative works.\n\nIn July 2014, occupation forces in Donetsk detained Serhiy Zakharov, who has been dubbed “the Banksy of Donetsk” for his irreverent street art, after he created and displayed public art mocking and criticizing the local authorities. “DPR” militants detained him and held him captive in his studio for over a month. He was repeatedly beaten and subject to mock executions. He wrote and illustrated a graphic novel describing his experience and that of other captives. Donetsk occupiers also illegally detained poet, writer, scientist, and public activist Ihor Kozlovsky for nearly two years from 2016 to 2017.\n\nThe Ukrainian author and journalist Stanislav Aseyev, who reported on local developments for international news outlets under a pen name, Vasin, was detained in Donetsk in 2017 and illegally held for nearly two and a half years. He wrote a book, The Torture Camp on Paradise Street, about his detention and abuse, in which he described the prison as “akin to a concentration camp where torture, humiliation, rape of both women and men, as well as forced hard physical labor are the rules of the day.”\n\nSince 2014, many writers, artists, and cultural workers have been forced to leave Russian-occupied territories or areas of active conflict for their own safety, escaping military conflict or repression or both, relocating to other locations in Ukraine and abroad. Many have continued their creative work in very difficult circumstances, but others have struggled to do so.\n\nIya Kiva, a poet, fled Donetsk in 2014 after the Russian invasion. She described being displaced in Ukraine and finding meaning as a writer during the war: “Left without a home, without property, without any prospects for the future, I realized that only one thing cannot be taken away from me by force: language and the ability to write . . . The most difficult thing for me was to convince myself that words, voice, poetry, [and] literature are still important. That they have not lost their meaning, but rather changed their meaning . . . The war speaks for itself so loudly and convincingly that all words next to it seem like incomprehensible noise . . . However, this is actually the task of literature in war, to restore weight to words—words of peace and love, so that all our testimonies outweigh the language of war.”\n\nFrom 2010 to 2014 the Izolyatsia Foundation: Platform for Cultural Initiatives operated on the site of a former insulating materials factory. During the first years of the foundation, more than 20 art projects were created. Well-known Ukrainian and foreign artists including Cai Guo-Qiang, Daniel Buren, Borys Mykhailov, and Lozano-Hemmer worked there, alongside promising young Ukrainian artists like Zhanna Kadyrova, Apl315, Roman Minin, Ivan Svitlychny, Gamlet Zinkivsky, and others.\n\nOn June 9, 2014, armed representatives of the “DPR” invaded the Foundation and converted it into a training facility for “DPR” fighters; a depot for automobiles, military technology, and weapons; a prison; and a secret torture facility. Former prisoners have remarked that the Izolyatsia buildings were not equipped to serve as a prison, and that its conditions more closely resembled those of a concentration camp. Prisoners were forced to work for the wardens, who regularly used physical violence, and were deprived of food, water, and medical care.\n\nLibraries and Archives\n\nThe Ukrainian government has documented damage and destruction to at least 49 libraries and archives. In an August media interview, Oksana Boyarynova, a member of the Ukrainian Library Association Board, reported that 2,475 libraries, out of about 15,000 across the country, are currently closed due to damage, funding, or staff being forced to leave their jobs and homes due to the war. She said that 21 libraries have lost their entire collections.\n\nThe city of Chernihiv was subject to an intense siege by Russian forces from February 24 until their withdrawal from northern Ukraine in early April. Russian attacks decimated the striking Gothic Revival Youth Library, also known as the Tarnovsky Building, causing extensive damage to its roof and walls. The building formerly housed the Museum of Ukrainian Antiquities: Founded in 1902 by Vasyl Tarnovsky, it was one of the first and one of the most well-known museums in Ukraine. The collection had been transferred to the city historical museum and the building subsequently functioned as a library for children and youth, including at the time of the attack. The Ukraine Institute describes the damage as “an irreparable loss of the cultural and historical heritage of Ukraine.”\n\nAlso in the Chernihiv region, Ukraine’s Ministry of Justice, citing the head of the State Archival Service of Ukraine, reported that Russian attacks destroyed the Security Service archives, which included the former Soviet secret police (NKVD) documents related to Soviet repression against Ukrainians. Approximately 13,000 files were destroyed, representing a devastating loss to historians and to the victims whose stories the documents held.\n\nRussian forces attacked Bucha, a small city outside of Kyiv, committing grave human rights abuses, including mass killings of civilians. They also destroyed the archives of the Ukrainian politician and Soviet-era dissident, politician, and publicist, Vyacheslav Chornovil. As a defender of Ukrainian cultural rights and free expression, Chornovil publicized the Soviet repression of Ukrainian intellectuals in 1966; headed the Ukrainian Helsinki monitoring group; edited the Ukrainian Herald, an illegal underground newspaper; and was head of the Ukrainian national-democratic liberation movement in the late ’80s and ’90s. Chornovil was sentenced to Soviet prison three times before emerging as a prominent political leader after Ukraine’s independence. The National Union of Journalists reported that significant parts of Chornovil’s archive were lost, as well as books from the Chornovil Foundation and 60 copies of the complete works of Chornovil. Nearly all of the archives of Mykola Plahotniuk, a fellow dissident, located in the same house, were also destroyed.\n\nThe 19th-century Korolenko Kharkiv State Scientific Library, the largest library in Ukraine in size, and the second largest in terms of holdings, suffered significant damage on March 13, 2022. The Ministry of Culture and Information Policy and the Korolenko Kharkiv State Scientific Library described the library as housing seven million copies of documents in different languages and serving as a digital education hub in Kharkiv. Russian attacks on the facility caused damage to two on-site book depositories, the main library building, stained glass windows, as well as a grand piano once played by Russian composer Sergei Rachmaninoff. The book collections in the library were not damaged by the attacks, but were exposed to the elements when the windows were blown out.\n\nLooting of Museums in Occupied Territories\n\nThroughout the history of Russian rule over Ukraine, the Russian imperial as well as Soviet governments conducted systematic policies of appropriating precious Ukrainian cultural artifacts for museum collections in Russia. Unique and invaluable treasures, including articles of Scythian gold, masterpieces of ancient Greek art from southern Ukraine, icons and artifacts from the times of medieval Kyivan Rus’, all the way to showpieces of Ukrainian modernist and avant-garde art, were seized and transported en masse to imperial holdings in Saint Petersburg and Moscow.\n\nIn keeping with this imperial-colonial tradition, Russian and separatist forces have appropriated and looted museums in the territories they illegally occupy. In the southern city of Melitopol in April, Russian soldiers oversaw the removal of at least 198 rare gold artifacts as well as silver coins and other precious objects from the Melitopol Museum of Local History. The gold objects date back to the fourth century B.C. and the Scythian empire. Soldiers also kidnapped museum workers. The Russian-appointed de facto museum head made it clear the authorities do not regard the treasures as part of Ukrainian cultural legacy, but that they “are of great cultural value for the entire former Soviet Union.”\n\nIn late April, Ukrainian officials reported that Russian forces stole and moved more than 2,000 unique exhibit items from museums across southern Ukraine, as well as works by the 19th-century Mariupol native Arkhip Kuindzhi and the painter Ivan Aivazovsky who lived in Crimea for much of his life, as well as a unique handwritten Torah scroll, and the Gospel of 1811 made by the Venetian printing house for the Greeks of Mariupol.\n\nBetween October 31 and November 3, 2022, the Oleksiy Shovkunenko Kherson Art Museum was looted by armed men dressed in civilian clothing, according to museum administrators. Russian occupying forces and Russian collaborators carried out “everything they saw, everything they could reach.” The museum’s collection includes more than 10,000 pieces of art.\n\nThe Albin Havdzynskyi Picture Gallery, located in the temporarily occupied city of Nova Kakhovka in the Kherson region, was robbed by occupying Russian forces after the “evacuation of the population” was announced due to a possible counter-offensive by the Ukrainian army. The city’s mayor, Volodymyr Kovalenko, reported: “They are taking all the exhibits they can. A truck approached the gallery, and Russians started loading them. Locals saw this, but the occupiers did not let them come close. Over 1,000 artworks were exhibited in the gallery; of these, 297 paintings were gifted to Nova Kakhovka by Albin Havdzynskyi, Honored Artist of Ukraine.”\n\nIn November 2022, Russian forces were forced to retreat from Kherson. Media reports confirmed by the Ukrainian military’s National Resistance Center, indicated that Russian soldiers had looted 15,000 objects from the Oleksiy Shovunenko Art Museum, Kherson Regional Museum, and other cultural venues. Media reports suggest that the Kherson Art Museum’s collection was taken to the Simferopol Museum of Local Lore in occupied Crimea.\n\nImpacts on Publishing\n\nKharhiv largely served as the center of Ukraine’s publishing industry. The industry has been battered by damage to buildings, loss of staff (due to deaths related to the conflict and displacement), closures of printing houses, bookstores and other retail sales outlets, and supply chain disruptions. There are over 250 publishers in Ukraine, located across the country, with a large part of the industry concentrated in Kharkiv, home to the three largest book printers. A few months into the war, the Ukrainian Book Institute, a state institution affiliated with the Ministry of Culture and Information Policy, surveyed 258 publishers and found that 74 percent (191 publishers) were operational, while 11 percent remained unable to operate as of July 2022. Vivat Publishing, also a large publisher, planned to proceed with all books scheduled for publication in 2022 and had also increased online-only content.\n\nIn March 2022, the director of one of the largest printing houses in Ukraine, Unisoft, reported that their building in Kharkiv was partially damaged by shelling. Vivat Publishing reported having to find new printers near Kyiv and in western Ukraine, after the building housing their printer in Kharkiv was damaged by shelling. According to the director of the Ukrainian Association of Publishers and Book Distributors and staff from a local publishing house, book printing completely stopped in Kharkiv from March to May.\n\nBook stocks have also been under threat, with millions of copies of books marooned in warehouses and publishers unable to access them due to the fighting. Vivat Publishing had books stranded in a warehouse in Kharkiv that they could not safely move because of the constant shelling in the early months of the war. They have subsequently made efforts to relocate books in small batches to safer areas. Vivat also moved its warehouse to Lviv, and restarted distribution in May, primarily through digital books. On May 20, 2022 the publishing house reopened its bookstore in the center of Kharkiv. One of Ukraine’s leading poets and authors Serhiy Zhadan read new poems at the opening. Despite the ongoing difficulties for the industry, Ukraine’s largest literary festival, the Lviv BookForum, went ahead on October 6, 2022. Vivat opened its first bookstore in Kyiv in October 2022.\n\nAccording to Andriy Kurkov, one Ukraine’s most renowned authors and the president of PEN Ukraine from 2018 to 2022, many writers have paused their fiction writing since the invasion in February 2022, opting for nonfiction essays, diaries, and journalism. He stated that poetry had become more patriotic and declarative.\n\nIn his Arthur Miller Freedom to Write Lecture delivered at PEN America’s World Voices Festival in New York earlier this year, Kurkov described his own experience: “I could not have imagined a situation in which I would decide not to write a novel. But it has happened. Reality is now scarier, more dramatic than any fictional prose. In this context, novels lose their meaning. Now it is necessary to write only the truth, only non-fiction. All those who can write are witnessing one of the worst crimes of the 21st century. The task of witnesses is to record and preserve the evidence of the crime.”\n\nIn an interview conducted in July 2022, Volodymyr Rafeyenko, a writer, poet, and translator twice displaced inside Ukraine, first from Donetsk and then from Kyiv region, described his experience as a Ukrainian Russophone: “I positioned myself as a Ukrainian writer who also functions in the Russian cultural-linguistic sphere. It never entered my mind to write in Ukrainian. After [Russia’s invasion in] 2014, I learned Ukrainian and wrote a novel in Ukrainian, to show Russians and anyone else that even for a Russophone Ukrainian, learning Ukrainian is not a problem . . . After February 24 . . . I’m simply unable to write in Russian any longer . . . The trauma from what Russians have done to my country, to my life, is so deep that it may not ever heal . . . Right now, being human means, above all, being with my own people.”\n\nIya Kiva, a poet, also began to write more consistently in Ukrainian: “It was both a choice and a desire to be involved in the space of dialogue specifically with the Ukrainian-speaking culture of Ukraine, to the circle of meanings and ideas with which the Ukrainian language works and which articulates a certain image of the world.”\n\nZinkivskyi described how he grappled with his art during the early stages of the conflict in 2022: “When the war broke out, I did not understand why I should do this. But when I started drawing, I quickly understood why it was necessary. The [Ukrainian] military from Kharkiv who know me look at my paintings on Instagram. And when they meet other soldiers from Western Ukraine, they say that they are from Kharkiv and [they] show [them] my artwork. They look at my artwork, sitting in the trench, using Starlink! They thank me because it inspires them.”\n\nZinkivskyi has worked with a sculptor from Lviv, Serhiy Shaulis, to make a series of sculptures in the form of broken skulls. Shaulis uses military detritus for his art and relies on the support of Ukrainian soldiers to provide him with materials. As Zinkivskyi explains, “I bring the military to him all the time. Soldiers collect shell casings, he melts them down and casts the skulls. All the battalions I help ask me what I need. I ask for brass cartridge cases to cast sculptures and we go to his workroom—it is very interesting for the guys. I always invite them to visit my house and the workroom of Serhiy Shaulis. This is the opportunity for them to touch the art.”\n\nTamara Shevchuk, a painter and graphic designer from the Kyiv region, also found her work influenced by the war and created a new series of paintings and illustrations featuring traditional Ukrainian dress, patterns, and symbols. Before the February invasions, she worked as an art therapist with Ukrainian children and soldiers who had left the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, helping them process the trauma they sustained from war into a creative outlet.\n\nPreserving Ukraine’s Heritage and Supporting Those Who Create and Protect Culture\n\nFaced with the Russian onslaught, Ukrainian culture in all its forms requires urgent as well as sustained recovery and resilience support. Much of the support to date—domestically and internationally—has focused on what is known as cultural heritage, which covers physical buildings, objects, and artifacts, and provides, to some extent, support for cultural heritage workers. This is essential, but guaranteeing the survival and flourishing of a culture under threat also means ensuring the creators of culture can do their crucial work to sustain, expand, and carry a vibrant culture forward into the future.\n\nThe Ukrainian government has undertaken a number of steps to strengthen state cultural institutions since 2014. It established the Ukrainian Cultural Foundation, to provide state grants for arts and culture, and the Ukrainian Book Institute to promote Ukrainian literature. It reorganized the Ukrainian State Film Agency and launched the Ukrainian Institute, under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that is tasked with promoting Ukrainian culture abroad. Since the February 2022 invasion, the Ukrainian government has been collecting evidence on attacks on cultural heritage sites. It has also focused on protection of physical cultural heritage and cultural buildings and sites, and has allocated some emergency donations “to meet the needs of culture, arts, creative industries, protection and preservation of cultural heritage [and] cultural values.” In its April-July monitoring reports on the war, the OSCE acknowledged “considerable Ukrainian efforts to protect and preserve cultural heritage,” consistent with the international humanitarian law requirement that the defending state safeguard cultural property.\n\nWorkers at museums and cultural sites across Ukraine have also worked to protect their holdings since the February invasion, for example by relocating movable objects to basements and safer areas. They have reinforced buildings, boarded up windows, and protected artifacts that cannot be easily moved with scaffolding, sandbags, and fire-retardant coverings.\n\nPEN Ukraine provides much-needed financial support to Ukrainian writers, both PEN Members and non-Members. Since February 24, 2022, the organization has supported more than 80 requests through the PEN Ukraine Emergency Fund with the support of the PEN International community and their authors. In addition, PEN Ukraine has provided 120 scholarships for Ukrainian writers, translators, and critics to continue their creative work. The scholarships have been supported by the International Foundation Renaissance and the New Democracy Fund.\n\nThe non-profit Museum Crisis Center emerged quickly after Russia’s February 2022 invasion to support local museums and staff, primarily in eastern Ukraine, near the front lines. The organization aims to provide support to grassroots initiatives and art projects that may not receive immediate attention from the Ukrainian government and international donors.\n\nThe Heritage Response Fund Initiative (HERI) is a small coalition of NGOs and one cultural reserve which also launched in early March. It undertakes a number of activities to support museums, libraries, and archives, including—according to its June 2022 report—assisting cultural institutions and employees; protection of museum collections; and collecting data on damage to cultural heritage. They also maintain a telephone hotline for museum workers and cultural institutions in need of assistance.\n\nAnother grassroots initiative launched shortly after the February invasion, The Center to Rescue Ukraine’s Cultural Heritage, was started by several cultural workers based in Lviv. It has worked with partners in Poland and other countries to support museums across Ukraine with packaging, security materials, and finances.\n\nUkrainian cultural workers have made clear that support for Ukrainian cultural heritage must include the workforce. In a media interview, Sofia Dyak, director of the Center for Urban History in Lviv, said: “The nature of preservation focuses on material structures, but there are no structures without people. People who have lived and worked in them, the people who watch over them today.” Another museum director highlighted the disproportionate impact of the war on culture on women: “Remember that the cultural field in Ukraine is basically a female profession. Every museum had a team [with] many women,” noting that many had to flee to safety with their families.\n\nAmong initiatives that support the cultural workers and creators are:\n\nUkrainian Emergency Art Fund created to deal with the consequences of the Russian invasion and threats the war poses to the Ukrainian art community. It was started by the Museum of Contemporary Art (MOCA) NGO in partnership with Zaborona, The Naked Room, and Mystetskyi Arsenal. With help from their international supporters such as Prince Claus Fund, they provide support for cultural actors from different sectors (independent artists, curators, arts managers, researchers, writers, etc) and cultural NGOs in Ukraine.\n\nThe Ukrainian Cultural Foundation is a state-funded organization, which, like many other cultural initiatives, experienced severe budget cuts after the February 24 invasion. Despite this, it was still able to allocate funding to support scholarships which support cultural restoration projects.\n\nInternational Support Initiatives\n\nPEN America’s Artists at Risk Connection (ARC), with support from the Helen Frankenthaler and Andy Warhol Foundations, has launched a $2.2 million fund that is providing emergency and resilience assistance to visual artists from Ukraine and the regions that are affected by the ongoing war. ARC has also compiled global resources for artists, writers, and cultural practitioners from Ukraine, including emergency funds and residency opportunities supported by a number of foundations, funds, NGOS, museums, and others in Europe.\n\nIn September, the European Commission launched a €5 million program to support “[Ukrainian] artists outside their country, cultural organizations in Ukraine, and preparation for the postwar recovery of the Ukrainian cultural and creative sector in the medium term.”\n\nThere are numerous international initiatives that are supporting Ukrainian museums and other cultural institutions and their employees with funding, in-kind donations of materials for emergency protection and preservation, support with cataloging, and the like. For example, important funding support comes from the Prince Claus Fund’s Cultural Emergency Response program, which supports artists and cultural practitioners working in coordination with the Smithsonian Cultural Rescue Initiative. The International Alliance for the Protection of Heritage in Conflict Areas (ALIPH) is public-private partnership of heritage professionals, national authorities, NGOs, and civil society groups all over Europe, which has provided funding for protective materials, upgrading of storage facilities, and a heritage site monitoring system. The International Council of Museums (ICOM) in Poland has provided grants to museum personnel who sought refuge in the country and supported connections with Polish museums to help identify job opportunities, and has also coordinated with museums in Germany and other locations to get protective materials and other supplies to museums in Ukraine.\n\nThe World Monuments Fund’s Ukraine Heritage Response Fund currently supports heritage professionals and provides supplies. Future physical conservation projects will stabilize and rehabilitate important cultural sites across Ukraine, according to its website. Museums in Poland and elsewhere in Europe have also directly contributed supplies, tools, and funds. The Network of European Museums Organizations (NEMO) has gathered information on a number of different local and international initiatives on its website.\n\nDigital preservation of historical and cultural treasures is also underway. The Saving Ukrainian Cultural Heritage Online (SUCHO) initiative launched on March 1 and, according to its website, has “web-archived more than 5,000 websites and 50TB of data of Ukrainian cultural institutions, to prevent these websites from going offline . . . from national archives to local museums.” An initiative called Backup Ukraine creates detailed 3D models of cultural sites that will live permanently in a digital archive to be used in reconstruction of sites as necessary.\n\nThere have been efforts to ensure that refugees, especially children, have access to Ukrainian-language books and textbooks, in order to support their continued use of Ukrainian in reading even as they enter school systems and learn the languages of the countries where they currently reside. For example, the Ukrainian government sponsors a program called “Books without Borders” with information about where to find Ukrainian-language books in different countries. They are also printing children’s books for those who have fled abroad.\n\nExisting International Legal Standards\n\nInternational Human Rights Law\n\nThe Right to Culture\n\nThe International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), ratified by both Ukraine and Russia, protects the right of everyone to take part in cultural life, without discrimination. States are prohibited from interfering with the exercise of cultural practices and, with access to cultural goods and services, must facilitate the development and preservation of culture.\n\nThe Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights (CESCR) states that culture is a “living process, historical, dynamic and evolving, with a past, a present and a future.” Culture exists in multitudes of forms through which individuals, groups of individuals, and communities express their humanity and the meaning they give to their existence, and build their worldview. The committee also specifies that “respect for cultural rights is essential for the maintenance of human dignity and positive social interaction between individuals and communities in a diverse and multicultural world.”\n\nThe UN Special Rapporteur in the field of cultural rights, in a 2016 report on the intentional destruction of cultural heritage, has specified that cultural rights can be understood as: “human creativity and its development; the free choice, expression and development of identities; the right to participate, or not to participate, in the cultural life of one’s choice; the right to interact and exchange ideas, including across borders; and the rights to enjoy and have access to the arts, to knowledge . . . and to an individual’s own cultural heritage, and that of others.”\n\nNotably, the CESCR recognizes a close link between culture and education, stating that “the right of everyone to take part in cultural life is also intrinsically linked to the right to education,” through which communities pass on values, customs, language, and other cultural references, and which helps to foster mutual understanding and respect for cultural values. Russia’s co-opting of the education system in territories which it occupies to advance Russian and Soviet culture and traditions and Russian language is one aspect of its violations of the right to culture of Ukrainians.\n\nThe UN Special Rapporteur on cultural rights has also noted that cultural rights are firmly embedded in the universal human rights framework, and cannot be invoked to excuse human rights violations, discrimination, or violence. The Russian government has abused the concept of the right to culture and weaponized it to justify its military campaign, occupation, and human rights violations, claiming that its actions are intended to protect Russian language speakers whose rights are being violated by Ukrainian authorities. In a May 2022 statement, the current UN Special Rapporteur on cultural rights Alexandra Xanthaki made clear that “the questioning and denial of the Ukrainian identity and history as a justification for war, is a violation of the Ukrainians’ right to self-determination and their cultural rights,” adding that the multi-layered violations of cultural rights in Ukraine will have devastating effects in the postwar era.\n\nThe Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols\n\nThe 1949 Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols form the core of international humanitarian law and regulate the conduct of armed conflict and seek to limit its effects. Article 27 of the Fourth Geneva Convention states that civilians “are entitled, in all circumstances, to respect for their persons, their honor, their family rights, their religious convictions and practices, and their manners and customs.” While the term culture is not specifically referred to, the obligation to respect manners and customs can be considered as an obligation to protect culture and cultural heritage.\n\nArticle 53 of Additional Protocol One prohibits any attacks of hostility directed against “the historic monuments, works of art, or places of worship which constitute the cultural or spiritual heritage of peoples.” States should also not use such objects for military purposes.\n\nThe Additional Protocols to the Geneva Convention prohibit targeting of civilian objects and require states to make every effort to minimize harm to civilians and civilian objects. This includes avoiding indiscriminate attacks which do not distinguish between legitimate military targets and civilian infrastructure, or that would cause disproportionate harm to the civilian population. Other locations of culture, which do not fall under the narrower definition of the 1954 Hague Convention of cultural property, such as local history and culture museums, most libraries, local community and cultural centers, concert venues, sports arenas and the like, are protected as civilian objects. Like all civilian property, cultural property can only be a target if it becomes a military objective.\n\nSerious violations of international humanitarian law committed with criminal intent—that is, deliberately or recklessly—are war crimes. There is not one single document in international law that codifies all war crimes. Lists of war crimes can be found in both international humanitarian law and international criminal law treaties, as well as in international customary law. War crimes, listed in the “grave breaches” provisions of the Geneva Conventions and as customary law in the International Criminal Court (ICC) statute and other sources, include a wide array of offenses: deliberate, indiscriminate, and disproportionate attacks harming civilians; hostage taking; using human shields; and imposing collective punishment, among others.\n\nThe ICC has jurisdiction over crimes against or affecting cultural heritage. In its 2021 policy guidance on cultural heritage, the Office of the Prosecutor recognizes both the tangible and intangible expressions of culture and that “crimes against or affecting cultural heritage have an impact on our shared sense of humanity and the daily lives of local populations.”\n\nConclusion\n\nCultural heritage is “a message from the past and . . . a pathway to the future.”\n\nUkrainians are making herculean efforts to protect their cultural heritage amidst a war that is threatening and taking their lives, reducing their homes to rubble, and depriving them of the most basic necessities. Thousands have lived under occupation and lost loved ones to the conflict. Yet, ordinary citizens have transported priceless pieces of art to safety or filled hundreds of sandbags to place around museums and monuments. Volunteers from places far removed from a brutal war have found innovative ways to amplify and support their efforts.\n\nBut Ukrainians are not only desperately trying to protect their cultural heritage from obliteration. Writers, poets, artists, musicians, dancers, and other cultural producers continue to make music, literature, and art. Some focus on the war, others find joy in the soaring sounds of traditional instruments and in rediscovering and reimagining new aspects of their culture. They are supported by curators, librarians, publishers, teachers, architects, and students. In small towns, staff from cultural centers that housed precious artifacts documenting local history and life walk through burned-out buildings and shattered walls, salvaging what they can, making new arrangements to continue their work, and planning how they will rebuild when the war is over.\n\nTheir commitment is commensurate with the scale and magnitude of Russia’s attack on Ukrainian culture: Russia has mounted a multi-faceted attack on Ukraine’s culture and cultural infrastructure, from targeted attacks on the buildings that symbolize both culture and resistance to the suppression of the Ukrainian language in schools; attacks on writers; executions of artists; and the bombing of local cultural centers at the heart of villages and towns all over Ukraine. While Russia’s short-term goal may be to demoralize Ukrainians and undermine their resistance, the end game is the obliteration of Ukrainian culture. The pervasive and widespread nature of this attack implicitly recognizes the critical role that culture is playing in helping to fortify Ukrainians’ resolve to protect their identity, history, and language from Russian aggression. Their determination has inspired a global outpouring of empathy, humanitarian aid, and technical assistance, and this painful and epic endeavor to ensure that their culture survives is a profound and ultimately hopeful investment in Ukraine’s future.\n\nThese attacks infringe on all aspects of the right to access and enjoy all forms of cultural heritage, rights that are guaranteed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other binding international treaties. Of particular importance in the conflict in Ukraine, cultural rights are “an expression of and a prerequisite for human dignity.” These rights allow people, as individuals and as part of a group, to develop and express their humanity and find meaning in their existence through their “beliefs, convictions, languages, knowledge and the arts, institutions and ways of life.” As Serhiy Shaulis explained: “Culture forms people, it unites Ukrainians. It is a cultural code that . . . is inside every Ukrainian and it is (still) there.”"
