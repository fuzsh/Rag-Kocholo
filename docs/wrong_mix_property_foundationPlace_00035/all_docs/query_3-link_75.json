We need it yesterday,” said Oleksandr Korniienko.\n\n“The war continues. Every day, the best sons and daughters of Ukraine risk their lives and give them for statehood, independence and sovereignty – for children, for the people, for the country,” said the First Vice Speaker, stressing that it is important to continue support and assistance in all its forms – military packages, sanctions, donations and fees."
