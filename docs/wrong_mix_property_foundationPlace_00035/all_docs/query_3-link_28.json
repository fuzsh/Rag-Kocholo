        "text": "header3 Key Developments in 2023\n\nOccupation authorities continued to conscript local men into the Russian armed forces and mobilize them to fight in the Kremlin’s full-scale war against Ukraine. The towns of Bakhmut and Avdiivka, both just outside the previously occupied portions of the Donetsk Region, were among the centers of destructive fighting during the year. The United Nations reported in September that 4,287 civilians had been killed and 6,324 injured in the Donetsk and Luhansk Regions since the full-scale invasion began in February 2022. Experts noted that the true number was likely higher, citing the difficulty of collecting and corroborating evidence.\n\nIn September, Russian authorities staged illegal regional elections in occupied areas of Ukraine, including Donetsk and Luhansk. Ukrainian officials, foreign governments, and international organizations condemned the exercises, which featured voter intimidation by the Russian military and a slate of exclusively Russian or pro-Russian candidates who supported the occupation.\n\nPressure on local residents to accept Russian citizenship and surrender their Ukrainian passports increased. A decree signed by Russian president Vladimir Putin in April threatened those who refused Russian citizenship with deportation if they are found to pose a national security risk.\n\nIn July, Russia enacted a law—which under the occupation was enforceable in eastern Donbas—prohibiting “medical interventions aimed at changing the sex of a person.” In November, Russia’s Supreme Court declared the “international LGBT public movement” to be an “extremist organization” and banned its activities in Russia, a measure that was similarly enforceable in the occupied Donbas."
