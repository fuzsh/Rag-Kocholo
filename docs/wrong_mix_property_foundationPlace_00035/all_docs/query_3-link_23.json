        "text": "\"Person of the Year\" according to Time, Profil, Financial Times and prestigious orders - what awards in 2022 went to the leader of the Ukrainian people Zelenskyy\n\nToday, the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, is considered one of the most heroic personalities in the history of free Ukraine and the democratic world. Despite the threat of reprisals from the russian invaders, the Ukrainian leader remains in his post in Kyiv, where the invaders are constantly directing their missiles. Against the background of his courage and complete dedication to Ukrainian freedom, the president was awarded various orders and honored with honorary titles. We will tell you more about them below.\n\nOrder of Vytautas the Great\n\nIn the summer of July 28, 2022, during his visit to Kyiv, Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda publicly awarded his Ukrainian colleague and the entire people of Ukraine with the highest award of his country - the Order of Vytautas the Great.\n\nWhat is this award?\n\nThe Order is a state award of the Republic of Lithuania. It was founded in 1930 to reward Lithuanian and foreign citizens for special services to the Lithuanian state. Actually, the highest state award of the Republic of Lithuania is the Order of Vytautas the Great with a golden chain.\n\nZelenskyy was awarded the order for his services in the defense of freedom and democratic values in Europe together with the Ukrainian people, as well as for his personal contribution to the development of Lithuanian-Ukrainian interstate relations.\n\nPhoto: president.gov.ua\n\nCommander of the Grand Cross of the Order of Viestura\n\nA few days after russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Chapter of the Order of Latvia made a unanimous decision to award Zelenskyy with the Order of Viestura of the first degree.\n\n\"The Order of Viestura - the highest award of the Latvian state - was presented to the President of Ukraine in honor of the personal courage and leadership of Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the defense of pan-European values\", - said the chancellor of the Order's Chapter, Sarmite Elerte.\n\nPhoto: president.lv\n\nRonald Reagan Medal of Freedom\n\nThe USA also admired Zelensky's courage and desire for freedom. In this connection, on March 7, 2022, the President of Ukraine was awarded the Ronald Reagan Medal of Freedom.\n\nThe medal was handed over to the ambassador of Ukraine to the USA. The head of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation, Frederick Ryan, noted that the high award recognizes the leadership of the head of the Ukrainian state and the indomitable spirit of millions of Ukrainians who defend their right to choose their own future and inspire the entire civilized world to fight for the values of freedom and democracy.\n\nIt is worth noting that this medal is given mainly to US citizens, but in addition to Zelenskyy, the award was also given to such politicians as Angela Merkel (former Chancellor of Germany), Stephen Hawking (scientist), Nelson Mandela (ex-president of South Africa), as well as the current US President Joe Biden.\n\nPhoto: wikipedia\n\nIn addition, in November 2022, the US National Constitution Center awarded Zelenskyy the Philadelphia Medal of Freedom. It is awarded to individuals in recognition of their leadership in the pursuit of freedom. It is interesting that in 2005, the former president of Ukraine, Viktor Yushchenko, received the same medal.\n\nPerson of the Year by Time, Profil and Financial Times\n\n2022 was a fruitful year for the Ukrainian president when it comes to awards and prizes. Only, according to the versions of the two most prestigious publications, Zelenskyy became the Person of the Year.\n\nTime magazine called President Zelenskyy \"Person of the Year 2022\" and \"the spirit of Ukraine\".\n\n\"Zelensky's success as a wartime leader was based on the fact that courage is contagious. It was spread by the political leadership of Ukraine in the first days of the invasion, when everyone understood that the president was staying. If this seems natural for a leader in a crisis, think about the historical precedent\", - reads an excerpt from the magazine's article about Zelenskyy.\n\nPhoto: Time\n\nNote that the publication has been awarding this honorary title since 1927, last year the award went to billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nThe Financial Times also recognized the Ukrainian leader as \"Person of the Year\".\n\n\"Zelenskyy, like Churchill during the Second World War, launched a broad and active campaign to attract financial and military support to his country, turning the suffering of Ukrainians into a moral lever of pressure on Europe and the United States\", - FT writes about Zelenskyy.\n\n\"Person of the Year\" according to the version of the Austrian publication Profil.\n\n\"Vladimir Zelenskyy has absolutely no problem referring to Western values in his struggle with Putin, and everyone understands what he means. This is a struggle for freedom and democratic self-determination. The President of Ukraine leaves no doubt that this is the only model that is worthy of risking one's life\", - writes Profil about the Ukrainian leader.\n\nMeanwhile, the prestigious American publication Politico named the Ukrainian head of state the most influential person in Europe in 2022.\n\n\"Just look at how European leaders rush to Kyiv to take pictures with the solemn 44-year-old in his now iconic olive-green T-shirt. Standing next to him, politicians want to be seen. Zelenskyy has convinced the rest of Europe that its future lies in connected with Ukraine - few people believed in this before the invasion of Russia in February\", - Politico said.\n\nIt should be noted that despite the leadership and courage of the Ukrainian president, all world awards went to him, including thanks to the Ukrainian people and the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which showed the whole world what the true spirit of freedom and the desire for democracy looks like.\n\nGlory to Ukraine! Glory to the Armed Forces!"
