        "text": "Peace Issue What is Open Source?\n\nOpen Source refers to the practice of making the design plans of technology (the 'source code' for software) publicly accessible so that anyone can use, modify, and distribute them freely. This article will discuss what open source is and how it can play a role in creating a better world.â Q. What is Open Source? â A. Open Source involves publicly sharing the design blueprints of technology, enabling free use, modification, and distribution by anyone. It's similar to how people share and adapt recipes. This \"technology recipe,\" known as Open Source or âfree softwareâ, is upgraded through the collaboration of technologists worldwide, thereby accelerating technological advancement. â Open Source Software Open Source software means the method of creating computer programs, i.e., the source code, is open for everyone to see, use, or modify. Many internet browsers and operating systems are developed as Open Source, allowing anyone to use them for free and modify them as needed. â Open Source Hardware Open Source hardware involves sharing the design blueprints of machines or electronic devices. Blueprints for various machines, electronic devices, and even rockets are shared, allowing anyone to view and modify them as necessary.During the COVID-19 pandemic, the design blueprints for critical medical equipment like ventilators were shared as Open Source, proving to be incredibly useful worldwide.Thus, Open Source serves as a public good that shares technological advancements with society at large and reduces the technological divide. The essence of Open Source is in collaboration and sharing knowledge, fostering more innovation and cooperation.For those interested in learning more about the digital divide,check out the following article!âââWhat is Digital Divide?â Richard Stallman: The Father of the Open Source Software Movement â (Richard Stallman, Photo Credit: Getty Image)Have you heard of Richard Stallman? Stallman was the first to argue that computer code should be open source. He believed that computer code should be a public good, like air or water, and that it should lead to widespread benefits and development across the globe.Working at MIT in the early 1980s, he realized the importance of freedom and sharing in software and started the GNU Project in 1983. GNU stands for \"GNU's Not Unix,\" a project aimed at creating a free software system that is compatible with Unix.Stallman made a significant statement that remains at the core of open source philosophy today, regarding the \"freedom of software.\" Open Source is for \"freedom of expression,\" not about being free of charge! \"Free software is a matter of liberty, not price.To understand the concept, you should think of 'free' as in 'free speech,' not as in 'free beer.'\"This statement emphasizes that the freedom of software is not a matter of cost but a matter of liberty. He highlighted that \"free\" refers not to being cost-free (\"free beer\") but to \"freedom of expression\" (\"free speech\").Richard Stallman's thoughts have laid the foundation for the Free Software Movement, profoundly impacting today's technological innovations and software development culture.â The Journey of Open Source for a Better World â The Free Software Movement. Technology as Humanity's Collective Asset Richard Stallman's philosophy was further concretized through the \"Free Software Movement.\" This movement posits that everyone should have the freedom to use, study, modify, and distribute software.The belief that technology should become a collective asset of humanity led to the formation of communities by developers worldwide, transcending national borders, and fostering global cooperation towards creating a better world.Furthermore, the positive force of this movement has contributed to the democratization of global education and knowledge. Open Source software plays a crucial role in providing technology to developing countries and marginalized regions, reducing the digital divide, and promoting equality in educational and economic opportunities. Transparency and Trust: The Power of Open Source Transparency and trust are crucial to Stallman's Open Source philosophy. When the source code of software is made available to everyone, ordinary users like us can understand how the software operates and easily identify any issues.For instance, the Open Source web browser \"Firefox\" became safer and more reliable through the review and improvement by developers worldwide. If any bugs or security issues are identified in such software, the global developer community quickly detects and resolves these issues, thereby increasing public trust.As demonstrated by the example of Firefox, software that embraces the Open Source philosophy benefits both users and developers, contributing significantly to increased trust and efficiency, especially in the public sector.Thus, Stallman's Open Source philosophy transcends mere technology, promoting the free flow of information and cooperative knowledge sharing, thereby enhancing societal transparency and trust.â Q. What are some examples of Open Source? â(Image Credit : Ushahidi HP)A. There are numerous examples of Open Source functioning as a public good and making the world a better place. Notably, the 'Ushahidi' platform and the 'Open Source Ventilator' project stand out. 1. Ushahidi: The Power of Open Source Technology in Crisis Situations A prime example of Open Source is the Ushahidi platform. Developed after the violence in Kenya in 2008, it's a technology that enables rapid response in crisis situations.â How It Works:The Ushahidi platform collects data from text messages or social media posts from users and displays it on a map. This provides real-time information about crisis situations, allowing for the delivery of emergency relief and support to the areas in need.â The Power of a Good CommunityThe success of Ushahidi showcases the power of a positive Open Source community. Developers worldwide, armed with goodwill, have voluntarily improved the code and added new features, allowing the platform to continually evolve and adapt to various situations.Since its inception in Kenya, Ushahidi has been used worldwide in various disaster and crisis situations, including the 2010 Haiti earthquake and the 2011 Japan tsunami, as well as in various political conflicts, proving to be a significant aid. 2. 'Open Source Ventilator': An Open Source Hardware Movement for Responding to COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic saw a heartwarming Open Source hardware movement. During a global shortage of medical equipment, engineers and scientists widely shared methods online for creating simple medical devices.â How It WorksThe 'Open Source Ventilator' project provided a way to create ventilators from simple materials. Makers, engineers, and medical professionals worldwide participated in the project, sharing knowledge, experience, and new ideas. Ventilators were manufactured around the world based on these designs.â The Power of a Good CommunityThis movement was instrumental in saving many lives worldwide by manufacturing equipment at low cost during the urgent pandemic situation.These examples illustrate how Open Source can contribute to world peace and social stability as a public good. Open Source platforms, combining information sharing and cooperation, significantly enhance communication and responsiveness in emergency situations, leading to inspiring outcomes.â Q. What is the relationship between Open Source and AI? â AI as a Public Good and Its Social Impact Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming every aspect of our lives. In this era of rapid change, Richard Stallman's Open Source philosophy could significantly impact the future of AI technology and world peace.The potential of AI technology as a public good is immense. AI is not merely a sector within technology but has the power to bring about widespread changes across society. For instance, using AI to address climate change issues or to improve diagnoses in the medical field could enhance the quality of life for all humanity.As demonstrated by the positive outcomes of Open Source projects mentioned earlier, integrating Open Source philosophy with AI development can provide solutions to various global issues, including healthcare, education, and environmental problems. This could facilitate collaboration beyond national borders, leveraging AI as a powerful tool for societal transformation and improvement.â The Challenges Ahead of Us âIn the age of the AI technology revolution, a significant challenge that remains for us is applying Richard Stallman's innovative Open Source philosophy to modern AI development.Stallman believed that an individual's creativity yields the greatest value when shared with society as a whole.However, many AI technologies are currently being developed in closed environments. Global tech companies are increasingly developing AI in a proprietary manner, aimed at corporate profits. This approach not only limits innovation but also contributes solely to the interests of specific corporations or governments, overlooking the social and ethical impacts AI might have, which is problematic.Ultimately, the future of AI development is deeply intertwined with the principles of Open Source philosophy. The values of cooperation, sharing, and transparency, as proposed by Richard Stallman, should serve as crucial guidelines for directing AI towards contributing to world peace and the welfare of humanity.It is essential that we collectively maintain interest and vigilance to ensure that AI technology acts as a force for good, improving the lives of everyone.âTo embrace the future,we must expand the scope of vocations that can herald the coming of peace.Even though we may never meet our descendants, we must make sure that all their activities will harmonize in peaceful societies and nations.â-Dr. Hak Ja Han MoonFounder of Sunhak Peace Prize-ReferenceWhat is Digital Divide?Written by: Yeon Je Choi\n\nPeace Issue What is Femicide?\n\nFemicide refers to the killing of women simply because they are women. This article aims to explore the meaning and causes of femicide and discuss strategies to overcome it.â Q: What is Femicide? â A: Femicide is the act of killing women for the mere fact that they are women. It represents the most extreme form of gender-based violence and is typically perpetrated by men. The term was first used in 1976 by South African feminist activist and scholar Diana Russell. Since then, it has been widely used in human rights movements to describe the killing and murder of women. â Femicide or Feminicide Femicide is sometimes used interchangeably with the term Feminicide. Feminicide is a more specific term, referring to the killing of women as a form of social control or political violence.Thus, Feminicide encompasses not only male perpetrators but also state and judicial structures that normalize misogyny.

Harmful social norms also contribute to the occurrence of femicide. â Femicide in Africa Femicide rates in Africa are relatively high compared to the population. In South Africa, it's reported that a woman is killed every four hours, which is five times the global average.The high incidence of femicide in Africa is attributed to a combination of factors, including strong patriarchal culture, domestic violence, poverty, and social instability. â Femicide in Latin America In Latin America, approximately 4,050 women were victims of femicide in 2022, with Honduras having the highest rate (6.0 per 100,000 women).In this region, strong patriarchal culture, poverty, social instability, and drug-related gang violence are identified as the main causes of femicide. â Honor Killings in the Middle East In the Middle East, practices like 'honor killings' are closely associated with femicide.Honor killings occur for reasons such as a woman's sexual behavior, refusing forced marriage, being a victim of sexual violence, divorce, or infidelity. The perpetrators are often close relatives like fathers, husbands, or brothers.In Iran, honor killings have some legal acceptance, allowing perpetrators to evade legal punishment. Article 630 of the Iranian Penal Code grants husbands the right to kill their wives and the man involved if he witnesses them in a sexual relationship, highlighting the urgent need for legal reform.If you're curious about gender-based violence in Iran,check out the following article!âââReason for her Death: Improper Hijabâ Q: What is the Current State of Femicide? â A: Femicide is a global human rights issue occurring worldwide. The results of the 2023 report by UN Women, titled 'Gender-related killings of women and girls,' are shocking. In 2022, approximately 48,800 women and girls globally were killed by a family member or an intimate partner.2022 Global Femicide StatisticsSource: UN WomenThe key points of the report are as follows:<5 Key Points of the Report of'Gender-related killings of women and girlsâ> 1. Women and Girls are Most Likely to be Killed by Someone Close to Them Shockingly, many women and girls are killed by those closest to them, including intimate partners, fathers, mothers, uncles, and brothers. In 2022, about 48,800 women and girls globally met this tragic fate, meaning over 133 women or girls are killed daily by a family member.Intimate partners are still the most likely perpetrators of femicide, accounting for an average of 55% of family and partner-related killings. 2. Femicide is a Universal Problem Femicide is not confined to any one region. It's most prevalent in Africa (around 20,000 cases), followed by Asia (18,400 cases), the Americas (7,900 cases), Europe (2,300 cases), and Oceania (200 cases).When adjusting for total population size, in 2022, the rates were 2.8 per 100,000 in Africa, 1.5 in the Americas, 1.1 in Oceania, 0.8 in Asia, and 0.6 in Europe. 3. The Actual Scale of Femicide is Likely Much Larger The figures presented in the report, while alarmingly high, are just the tip of the iceberg, with many more cases going unrecorded.About 4 out of 10 intentional killings of women and girls are not sufficiently documented to be identified as murder due to national differences in criminal justice records and investigation practices. 4. Certain Groups of Women and Girls Face Greater Risks Femicide poses a greater risk to certain groups of women and girls. Particularly, women in the public eye, such as politicians, women's rights activists, and journalists, face higher risks. 5. Femicide is Preventable and Must Be Prevented To prevent femicide, harmful social norms must change, and entire communities and societies must develop a zero-tolerance approach to violence.Survivor-centered support and protection, early intervention and risk assessment, and gender-responsive policing and judicial services play a crucial role in addressing this issue.Gender-related killings of women and girls (femicide/feminicide): Global estimates of female intimate partner/family-related homicides in 2022Source: UN WomenIf you're interested in more statistics related to gender discrimination,check out the following article!âââA Femicide Factsheet: Global Stats & Calls to Action ââ Q: How Can We Reduce Femicide? â A: Femicide is a severe global issue that undermines gender equality and peace. Combating and eradicating femicide requires a complex and multifaceted approach. 1. Strengthen Legal and Policy Responses! To reduce femicide, robust legal and policy responses are necessary. Joint research reports by UN Women and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime suggest risk assessment and protective measures, establishing femicide watch centers, and treating femicide as a specific crime. 2. Educate and Raise Awareness! Educational initiatives and campaigns are needed to raise awareness about violence against women and gender discrimination. Including content on gender equality and human rights in school curriculums, and conducting awareness campaigns through mass media and social media can help reduce this crime. 3. Encourage Community Engagement! Since femicide often occurs in patriarchal societies, community-based programs are needed to promote community participation and prevent violence against women. Collaborating with community leaders to enhance awareness of gender equality and women's rights and activities to reduce violence against women within communities are essential. 4. Strengthen International Cooperation! As femicide is a cross-border issue, international cooperation is crucial. This involves collaboration among international organizations, governments, non-governmental organizations, and civil society groups.If you're interested in how to create a gender-equal world,check out the following article!âââCreating a Gender Equal Worldâ For a Society Where Women's Safety and Peace are Guaranteed âTrue foundations for world peace are established only when women, who make up half of the world, are happy. Femicide is a fundamental threat to this peace and the most extreme form of discrimination and violence women face in our society.The shocking reality that more than 133 women and girls are killed daily highlights that femicide is not just an isolated incident but a serious obstacle to global efforts for gender equality and human rights.We all must strive to eradicate violence against women, and this requires the collective efforts of policymakers, civil society, and individuals in each country.How about showing interest in an online campaign related to femicide today and hitting the âlikeâ button?âEquality for women is progress for all.â-Ban Ki-moon,Sunhak Peace Prize Foundersâ Award Laureates-Learn More:What is Gender-based Violence?Reason for her Death: Improper HijabCreating a Gender Equal WorldReferencesUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crime & United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women.

In this article, we will explore the problems associated with filter bubbles and seek ways for a better democracy.â Q: What is a Filter Bubble? â A: A Filter Bubble occurs when the internet tailors the information it provides to us based on our interests and behavior patterns. Imagine going to a special restaurant. This restaurant offers a menu based on the food we've ordered in the past. For instance, if we frequently ordered pizza, the menu might only show various types of pizza, hiding other food options. In such a scenario, we might not even be aware that other foods exist, increasing the likelihood of us continuing to eat only pizza.Internet portals and social media function similarly to this restaurant. These platforms identify our interests and search habits to provide customized content. While such algorithms might initially seem convenient, they can actually confine us to a narrow perspective, posing significant problems.The term \"Filter Bubble\" was coined by Eli Pariser, an internet activist and author. In his 2011 book, \"The Filter Bubble: What the Internet Is Hiding from You,\" Pariser introduced this term and argued that personalized search results and news feeds narrow users' perspectives and limit exposure to diverse information.Pariser's insights initiated an important discussion about how the internet and social media influence our consumption of information and communication, continuing to be a crucial concept today.â Q: What types of Filter Bubbles exist? â A: The filters that screen the information reaching us can be divided into social filters, search engine filters, and content recommendation filters. â¾ Social Filter Bubbles This phenomenon occurs when individuals consume information solely within their social networks. As a result, we may only be exposed to information from people who hold similar opinions and perspectives to our own. â¾ Search Engine Filter Bubbles Search engine filter bubbles provide customized search results based on a user's past search history and click behavior. â¾ Content Recommendation Filter Bubbles Content recommendation filter bubbles on social media platforms and video streaming services recommend content tailored to an individual's tastes and interests. This limits users from exploring a wider variety of content.â Q: What are the problems with Filter Bubbles? â A: The most significant issue with Filter Bubbles is their 'closed-off nature'. When the information we encounter is limited, our opportunities to be exposed to diverse perspectives and opinions decrease. Filter Bubbles can lead to several negative outcomes: â¾ Isolation in Personalized Information Algorithms provide us with tailored information, making us only exposed to the news and advertisements we prefer. For example, on social media, if we hold certain political views, we might only see news and posts that align with those views, which can diminish our ability to understand different perspectives. â¾ Manipulation of Consumer Choices Algorithms analyze our online behavior to show us customized advertisements. For instance, if we search for a specific product, related ads will continue to appear, encouraging us to make a purchase. This can manipulate our choices and limit our awareness of other options. â¾ Biased Decision-Making Personalized information can introduce bias into our decision-making. For example, someone interested in the stock market may only come across positive news about certain stocks, potentially leading to misguided investment decisions. â¾ Creation of 'Echo Chambers' Filter Bubbles can strengthen echo chambers, where information circulates only among people with the same opinions. Echo chambers can amplify extreme opinions, which is dangerous.â A Case Study of Filter Bubbles: The 2016 US Presidential Election âDuring the 2016 US presidential election, social media users encountered vastly different news and information based on their political leanings, complicating the understanding of opposing views and increasing social division. â¾ Social Media and Customized News Feeds Many voters used social media platforms like Facebook as their primary news source. These platforms delivered personalized content based on users' past interactions. As a result, users were mainly exposed to information that aligned with their viewpoints, reducing their chances of encountering opposing opinions or different political perspectives. â¾ Spread of Fake News Users were more likely to react to and share fake news that reflected their preferences or beliefs. Negative fake news about specific candidates spread rapidly on Facebook. According to a study by Stanford University, fake news supporting Trump was shared around 30 million times during the election period, nearly four times the number of shares for fake news supporting Hillary Clinton. â¾ Candidates' Social Media Strategies The presidential candidates leveraged filter bubbles to implement targeted campaign strategies. They delivered customized messages to specific voter groups through social media ads and content, further intensifying the phenomenon where voters are only exposed to messages that reflect their viewpoints. â¾ Formation of Divided Social Echo Chambers Filter bubbles strengthened the phenomenon of information circulating only among individuals with similar opinions. This further amplified extreme opinions about certain candidates or political issues.Ultimately, the 2016 US presidential election remains a clear example of the negative impact filter bubbles can have on democracy and public discourse.â Q: Is there a way to overcome Filter Bubbles? â(Photo Credit : Facebook/Yuval Noah Harari)\"In a world deluged by irrelevant information, clarity is power. In theory, everybody can join the discussion about the future of humanity, but it is becoming harder to engage in meaningful dialogue. We are in an era of a personal information bubble, where what we see and hear is tailored to our existing beliefs.\"- Historian, Yuval Noah Harari-To overcome Filter Bubbles, we must approach the issue with Yuval Noah Harari's perspective: \"In a world deluged by irrelevant information, clarity is power.\" Efforts must come from individuals, big tech companies, and governments. â¾ On an Individual Level: It's crucial to consciously manage our information consumption habits.Exploring news from diverse sources and perspectives, and listening to opinions different from our own are essential steps. Additionally, adjusting the settings on social media and search engines to expose ourselves to a variety of information is important. â¾ Big Tech Companies: They need to increase the transparency of their algorithms and make greater efforts to provide users with balanced information. Overcoming algorithms that reflect users' existing beliefs and improving them to respect diversity is necessary. â¾ Governments and Regulatory Bodies: They should focus on the issue of Filter Bubbles and implement appropriate policies. For example, they have a role in strengthening digital literacy education and enacting laws to promote the diversity and transparency of information.When these efforts are combined, we can overcome the difficulty of \"participating in discussions about the future of humanity\" mentioned by Yuval Noah Harari and move towards \"meaningful conversation and social participation.\"For a peaceful coexistence among diverse ethnicities, religions, and nationalities, understanding and accepting different perspectives is essential!Overcoming Filter Bubbles is not just about choosing different information. It's a crucial first step towards creating a more peaceful and unified world by understanding and accepting different perspectives.âTo embrace the future,we must expand the scope of vocations that can herald the coming of peace.Even though we may never meet our descendants, we must make sure that all their activities will harmonize in peaceful societies and nations.â-Dr. Hak Ja Han MoonFounder of Sunhak Peace Prize-ReferenceWhat is Digital Divide?Written by: Yeon Je Choi, Director\n\nPeace Issue What are Food Loss and Waste?\n\nFood loss and waste refer to the decrease in food quantity during the food supply process. This article examines the global situation, issues, and solutions for 'Food Loss and Waste,' a crucial topic in addressing poverty and hunger.â Q: What are Food Loss and Waste? â (Photo Credit : Global Initiative on Food Loss and Waste)A: Food Loss and Waste refer to the decrease in food quantity during the food supply process. It's like having building materials disappear before a house is constructed. The food produced on farms is diminished by about one-third before reaching peopleâs tables. â What is Food Loss? 'Food Loss' occurs from harvest up to the distribution stage, akin to building materials vanishing before a house is built. This issue is more prevalent in developing countries, with causes including inefficient harvesting methods, lack of storage facilities, and transportation issues. â What is Food Waste? 'Food Waste' is similar to leaving materials unused after building a house. It occurs post-distribution, that is, at the retail and consumer stages. This is more common in developed countries, where overconsumption, improper storage, and confusion over expiration dates often lead to good food being discarded.â Q: What is the Scale of Food Loss and Waste? â A: According to the 'Global Food Losses and Waste' report published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in 2011, nearly one-third of the food produced for consumption, approximately 1.3 billion tons per year, is wasted or lost. Recent reports indicate some improvement. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Food Waste Index Report 2021 states that now only about 8-10% of food produced worldwide is wasted.However, food loss and waste still pose significant environmental, social, and economic problems, especially concerning greenhouse gas emissions. â Variations by Region: Food loss and waste vary by region in terms of quantity and causes. In developing countries, significant losses occur post-harvest and during storage, while in developed countries, the problem is more about consumers purchasing food and not consuming it. â Differences by Food Type: The amount of waste also varies depending on the type of food. Fresh fruits and vegetables, and meat products are more prone to damage during storage and transportation. Additionally, consumers often purchase these items but end up discarding them without use.Download the ReportâââGlobal Food Loss and Food Wasteâ Q: What is the Impact of Food Loss and Waste? â A: Food Loss and Waste create problems far beyond just discarding food. The food we carelessly waste accumulates, significantly affecting our environment, economy, and society. Can you believe that the food we waste hinders the achievement of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)? â SDG 2: Zero Hunger Over 800 million people worldwide suffer from hunger. Shockingly, one-third of the food we produce, enough to feed approximately 1.3 billion people, is wasted or lost. To solve the famine problem, we need to reduce food loss and waste.To learn more about Zero Hunger,check out the following article!âââZero hunger! For a worldwithout hungry people â SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production Food Loss and Waste represent a waste of resources. The water, energy, and labor used in agriculture ultimately go into producing food that is not consumed. It's crucial to manage resources efficiently and produce food sustainably. â SDG 13: Climate Action Did you know that Food Loss and Waste also significantly impact climate change? Discarded food emits greenhouse gases as it decomposes, and the food production process itself leaves a carbon footprint. Thus, reducing carbon emissions in agriculture and promoting sustainable agriculture is necessary.To better understand the global poverty situation,check out the following article!âââGlobal Poverty Worseningâ Q: How Can We Reduce Food Loss and Waste? â A: To address the issue of Food Loss and Waste, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and other international bodies propose various strategies and recommendations: 1. Efficient Food Supply Chain Management â Improving production and harvesting techniques: FAO suggests reducing early-stage losses through better harvesting technologies and methods, like mechanized harvesting or improved timing. Yet be sensitive, keeping in mind that in some cases it is proper to leave some grain standing for birds (e.g. cranes) that depend on leftover rice or barley to survive.â Enhancing storage and transportation infrastructure: Especially crucial in developing countries. Needs include refrigeration facilities, effective packaging, and improved transportation methods. 2. Consumer Awareness and Behavioral Change â Education and awareness: It's vital to educate people on proper food storage and cooking methods and raise awareness to avoid unnecessary food purchases.â Improving date labeling: Many consumers confuse âdate producedâ, 'best before' and 'expiration' dates, leading to unnecessary food waste. Clearer labeling can help reduce this. 3. Policy and Legal Framework â Developing policies and regulations: Governments should develop and implement policies and regulations to reduce food loss and waste, such as incentives for reducing food waste or taxes on food waste.â Globally-minded subsidies: Rather than paying farmers not to produce so as to bolster prices, the same funds would be much better used to send the surplus produce to countries in dire need. 4. Solutions Through Technology and Innovation â Encouraging technological innovation: Utilizing IoT, big data, blockchain, etc., can improve efficiency by providing information throughout the food's journey from origin to consumer.â Sustainable packaging solutions: Developing and applying eco-friendly packaging that preserves food longer can reduce environmental impact and maintain freshness. 5. Promoting Food Recycling and Reuse â Food donation programs: Expanding and encouraging programs to donate unsold food can reduce food waste and contribute to solving hunger issues.â Food recycling initiatives: Developing and promoting methods to recycle food waste into animal feed, energy production, or composting is necessary.Additionally, there's the 'Food Loss and Waste Protocol' (FLW Protocol), a global standard for action to reduce food loss and waste. It provides guidance on how to measure and manage food loss and waste and use the best methods.Download the Food Loss and Waste Protocol(FLW Protocol)This protocol includes measuring and monitoring food loss and waste, sharing best practices, and fostering cooperation among various stakeholders.â For a Better Future âAs we've seen, reducing food loss and waste is a critical challenge for a better future. The key to solving this issue lies with us, not with anyone else.Shall we start with the meals we eat every day? Each of our small actions can lead to significant changes.For instance, only buying as much as we need, being careful not to waste food, sharing food when possible, and properly storing it can make a big difference.These small practices, when combined, can significantly contribute to protecting the planet and creating a sustainable future, where we all can live healthier and happier lives.âWhenever food is thrown out it is as if it were stolen from the table of the poor.â â Pope Francis âLearn more: Zero hunger!

With global warming, wet-bulb temperatures exceeding human survival limits are being recorded around the world, making it urgent to respond to this crisis.â Q. What are Wet-Bulb Temperatures? â A. Wet-Bulb Temperatures can be described as the 'temperature of humid air' and can be considered an element of weather. Wet-Bulb Temperatures are vital indicators that significantly impact our health and the overall environment of the Earth. When the wet-bulb temperature reaches 35Â°C, or 95Â°F, it signifies a critical threshold for human life. Therefore, understanding wet-bulb temperatures is crucial in the context of global warming.â Q. Why are Wet-Bulb Temperatures Important? â â Impact on Human Health High wet-bulb temperatures make it difficult for our bodies to cool down through sweating, leading to serious health issues like heatstroke.Humans have an amazing ability to sweat. As temperatures rise, sweat evaporates from our pores, cooling the skin and preventing the body from overheating. This is our natural cooling mechanism.However, this ability to sweat has theoretical limits. If the air is too humid, sweat does not evaporate efficiently, hindering our body's ability to cool down. This situation is precisely what happens in high wet-bulb temperature conditions.When the wet-bulb temperature reaches 35Â°C, our natural cooling system hits its limit. At this temperature, even the healthiest individuals with an unlimited water supply can only survive for a few hours before succumbing to the heat. â Impact on Ecosystems and Environment Wet-bulb temperatures significantly affect ecosystems and the environment. High wet-bulb temperatures can alter habitats for flora and fauna and negatively impact crop growth. Additionally, hot weather increases energy demands, placing a greater burden on the environment.Who suffers the most from high wet-bulb temperatures?Stay tuned for the next article!âââWho are Climate Refugees?â Q. How are Wet-Bulb Temperatures Measured? â â Method of Measuring Wet-Bulb Temperatures The method of measuring wet-bulb temperatures is quite intriguing. Scientists use a special instrument called a 'wet-bulb thermometer' for this purpose.This device consists of two thermometers. One is the 'dry-bulb thermometer', which measures the temperature of the air as it is. The other, the 'wet-bulb thermometer', has its bulb wrapped in a cloth soaked in water.As air passes over this moist cloth, water evaporates, absorbing heat from the surroundings, causing the temperature of the wet-bulb thermometer to drop. The temperature recorded at this moment is the 'wet-bulb temperature'.Source: ClimateCheck(ìµêµ¬ì¨ëê³ ì´ë¯¸ì§ ë£ê¸°)Interested in calculating wet-bulb temperatures?Click here!âââWet-Bulb Calculator â Interpreting Wet-Bulb Temperatures Using a wet-bulb thermometer, we can accurately determine how hot and humid the air is. This is especially important in hot regions like Delhi, India, where not just the temperature but also the wet-bulb temperature has a significant impact on the ecosystem.Let's look at recent wet-bulb temperatures in Delhi:â¢ June 29, 2022, Wet-Bulb Temperature: 33.7Â°C (Source: Hindustan Times)â¢ July 16, 2022, Wet-Bulb Temperature: 36.2Â°C (Source: Hindustan Times)The critical threshold for human survival in wet-bulb temperatures is 35Â°C. From the above data, we can gauge how intensely hot and humid the summer was in Delhi in 2022. That summer, over 160 people died in Delhi due to high wet-bulb temperatures.In November 2022, the World Bank announced that some regions in India could become uninhabitable for humans in the future.The high wet-bulb temperatures in Delhi during the summer of 2022, exceeding the human survival limit of 35Â°C, resulted in over 160 deaths.Photo Credit: Getty Images PlusSuch high-temperature environments also impact ecosystems. Due to high wet-bulb temperatures, it's projected that India's agriculture and livestock industries will soon suffer significant setbacks, water resources will become more challenging to secure, and soil degradation will lead to reduced agricultural output.Check out this article to learn more abouta Global WarmingâââThe Glaciers are Sending Us a Warningâ Q. What is the Relationship Between Climate Change and Wet-Bulb Temperatures? â â Impact of Global Warming Global warming is causing a rise in average temperatures worldwide, leading to an increase in wet-bulb temperatures.According to a 2020 study by Columbia University, the Earth is already experiencing combinations of heat and humidity that are threatening to life.India is particularly affected. The Columbia University research team analyzed global weather data collected from 1979 to 2017 and found that the 'Eastern Coastal' and 'Northwestern' regions of India showed hotspots with the highest 99.9 percentile of wet-bulb temperatures (at least 31Â°C).It's not just India. Looking at the map below, you can see regions in Pakistan and Northwestern India, the Red Sea coast, the Gulf of California, and the southern coast of the Gulf of Mexico marked in red (at least 33Â°C) and yellow (at least 31Â°C).Extreme wet-bulb temperatures are being observed worldwide. Areas marked in yellow and red on the map have recorded minimum daily wet-bulb temperatures of at least 31Â°C.source: Science Advances â Future Climate Prediction Scenarios In 2021, the UK's Met Office, a meteorological and climate research institution, released future prediction scenarios based on global temperature rises. According to these scenarios, if global warming continues at its current rate, there will be a sharp increase in the sector of population experiencing life-threatening extreme heat stress.The Met Office states that if the Earth's temperature rises by 2Â°C, the number of people globally affected by extreme heat stress will increase from the current 68 million to about 1 billion.If the Earth's temperature increases by 4.0Â°C, it is predicted that about 50% of the world's population will live in areas affected by extreme heat stress.Dr. Andy Hartley, the Met Office's head of climate impacts, warns, \"People living in areas with wet-bulb temperatures above 32.0Â°C are in extreme danger. Vulnerable groups and those with outdoor occupations face greater health risks. While this is currently observed in some regions of India, our analysis indicates that a 4.0Â°C rise could affect people on most continents with severe heat risks.\"The map shows areas where wet-bulb temperatures exceeding 32.0Â°C will occur for more than 10 days annually, assuming a 4.0Â°C rise in Earth's temperature compared to pre-industrial levels.Source : Met OfficeProfessor Matthew Huber from Purdue University, a climate scientist, also warns, \"By the end of this century, extreme situations with wet-bulb temperatures reaching 35Â°C could become more common.\"â Our Action is Needed! âThe research findings and warnings from scientists regarding the rise in wet-bulb temperatures highlight the severity of climate change's impact on humanity.If the Earth's temperature and humidity continue to rise unchecked, our beloved blue planet will become increasingly inhospitable for life.To tackle global warming and the issue of rising wet-bulb temperatures, it's essential to develop customized strategies at local and national levels. However, that alone is not enough. It's time for all of us to take action.Just as individual raindrops join to form rivers, the small actions of our 8 billion-strong global population can combine to create massive change. Why not start today by actively recycling, choosing sustainable products, and turning off unnecessary electricity? Using public transport, cycling, and walking are also great ways to make a difference.Creating a better tomorrow through small actions - this is what we can and must do right now.

This article explores the global status, challenges, and improvement strategies for Maternal Health, a critical topic in achieving gender equality.â Q: What is Maternal Health? â A: Maternal Health encompasses the range of health-related issues women face during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postnatal period. It includes not just physical health but also mental and social well-being. Healthy pregnancies and childbirths have a significant impact on families and society at large, making Maternal Health a vital issue for creating peaceful communities.It is also crucial for achieving gender equality. Improved access to maternal health services enhances the quality of life for women and facilitates their economic independence. However, many countries still fall short in providing adequate health care for women.Curious about the global status of gender equality?Check out the following article!âââTime to reach gender equality: 132 yearsâ Childbirth Turning Fatal! âIn May 2020, amid the global COVID-19 pandemic, reproductive health services in Yemen, Africa, faced funding depletion.Mariam, a Yemeni war widow and mother of four daughters, was receiving prenatal care at the Bani Shamakh medical center supported by the United Nations Population Fund. However, due to the funding crisis and the departure of her doctor, Mariam died from excessive bleeding during childbirth.There's another woman, Zainab, from Yemen. She gave birth to her daughter during the pandemic. Planned to deliver at a hospital, she had to give birth at home after her obstetrician left. Zainab also succumbed to excessive bleeding during childbirth.It's not just women in war zones. Globally, approximately 290,000 mothers die each year.â Global Maternal Health Status âLet's look at the global status of maternal health. According to a United Nations report tracking maternal deaths from 2000 to 2020, approximately 287,000 maternal deaths occurred worldwide in 2020. This is a shockingly high number. â Stagnation or Increase in Maternal Mortality Rates Between 2016 and 2020, only 31 countries saw a decrease in maternal mortality rates. Progress stalled in 133 countries, and 17 saw an increase. â Africa Faces the Gravest Situation Maternal deaths are concentrated in the poorest and most conflict-ridden regions globally. In 2020, about 70% of all maternal deaths occurred in Sub-Saharan Africa. The risk of dying during pregnancy or childbirth in Sub-Saharan Africa is 130 times higher than in Europe or North America.Particularly, in the nine countries with the highest Fragile States Index in 2020, the maternal mortality rate was 551 per 100,000 live births, twice the global average of 223. â Higher Mortality Rates Among Black Mothers in Developed Countries There's also a racial disparity in developed countries. For instance, in the United States, Black women are nearly three times more likely to die during childbirth than non-Hispanic white women.In Brooklyn, USA, in 2020, a 26-year-old Black woman died during childbirth. She suffered a heart attack during an emergency cesarean section.Even in 2017, Shalon Irving, a Black public health professional and Johns Hopkins University graduate, died from hypertension complications after giving birth. Despite her expertise in the health field, she did not receive adequate care for her childbirth complications.These cases highlight that maternal health issues extend beyond medical problems, closely tied to social and economic factors.â Q. What are the Factors Threatening Maternal Health? âA. There are several factors that jeopardize maternal health: â² Lack of adequate medical facilities and professionals â² Challenges in obtaining proper nutrition during pregnancy â² Lack of awareness about pregnancy-related complications According to a UN report, many women are not receiving essential maternal services. One-third of pregnant women worldwide fail to receive even four of the eight recommended antenatal check-ups, and 270 million women lack access to modern family planning.Teen mothers are also at high risk. Annually, an estimated 5.6 million abortions occur among adolescent girls, with nearly 4 million being unsafe.Pandemics like COVID-19, increasing poverty, and humanitarian crises add strain to health systems. Particularly in conflict zones and some African countries, issues such as decreased funding for maternal and neonatal health and lack of necessary medical facilities are severe.Download the ReportâââTrends in maternal mortality 2000 to 2020* This report, prepared by the WHO on behalf of the UN Maternal Mortality Estimation Inter-Agency Group, comprising WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, the World Bank Group, and the UN Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs, uses national data to estimate levels and trends of maternal mortality from 2000 to 2020.â Q. How Can Maternal Health Be Improved? â A. The UN's Sustainable Development Goals aim to reduce global maternal mortality to fewer than 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030. Although the global maternal mortality rate decreased from 227 in 2015 to 223 in 2020, there is still a long way to go to achieve this goal. But we must make progress, step by step! âª Strengthening Universal Health Coverage All women must have access to necessary medical services during pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding. To this end, the UN Population Fund set the following targets in 2021:<Goals to End Maternal and Newborn Deaths>(1) Increase the proportion of pregnant women receiving at least four antenatal care visits to 90%.(2) Expand the availability of skilled healthcare professionals during childbirth to meet 90% of the need.(3) Increase the proportion of mothers and babies receiving postnatal care within two days of birth to 80%.(4) Raise the national capacity for emergency obstetric and newborn care services to 80%.(Source: Maternal Mortality Trends Report from 2000 to 2020Joint study by WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, World Bank Group,and UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division) âª Education and Awareness It's crucial that everyone understands the importance of maternal health and that women, in particular, are educated to manage their health. Recent data shows that only about 60% of women aged 15-49 make their own decisions regarding sexual relations, contraceptive use, and reproductive health care. To improve maternal health, women need to be empowered to take control of their healthy lives.Furthermore, education for men is also important. To tackle harmful gender norms, biases, and inequalities prevalent in communities, men's participation is essential.Curious about a world of gender equality?Check out the following article!âââCreating a Gender Equal Worldâ For a Better Tomorrow âIn our journey toward a better tomorrow, maternal health is an issue that goes beyond the health of an individual. It forms the foundation of gender equality and societal advancement. Therefore, creating an environment where all women can enjoy healthy and happy lives is a responsibility for all of us.As Catherine Russell, the Executive Director of UNICEF, said, the miracle of childbirth should never turn into a tragedy for the mother.âFor millions of families, the miracle of childbirth is marred by the tragedy of maternal deaths,â said UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell. âNo mother should have to fear for her life while bringing a baby into the world, especially when the knowledge and tools to treat common complications exist. Equity in healthcare gives every mother, no matter who they are or where they are, a fair chance at a safe delivery and a healthy future with their family.â-Catherine Russell, Executive Director of UNICEF- Learn more : Time to reach gender equality: 132 years Creating a Gender Equal World Reference : World Health Organization, United Nations Children's Fund, United Nations Population Fund, World Bank Group, & United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs/Population Division.

In this article, we discuss the risks and global spread of zoonotic diseases.â Q. What is Zoonotic Diseases? â A: Zoonotic diseases refer to illnesses that can be transmitted from animals to humans. The term originates from the Greek words 'Anthropos' (human), 'Zoo' (animal), and 'Nosis' (disease), meaning diseases that both humans and animals can contract. However, it is commonly used in the context of diseases transmitted from animals to humans.In a 1952 World Health Organization (WHO) expert meeting, zoonotic diseases were defined as \"diseases or infections that are naturally transmitted between vertebrate animals and humans.\" Just like humans being able to eat fruits that were once only eaten by forest animals, these diseases have 'jumped' from animals to humans.The history of zoonotic diseases is as old as human history itself. The 'Black Death,' 'Spanish Flu,' and 'Measles' that claimed numerous human lives since the beginning are examples of zoonotic diseases, as are AIDS, MERS, and COVID-19, which emerged in the 1980s and are still not fully conquered, all originating from animals.While some zoonotic diseases like rabies can be prevented through vaccination, others like Ebola and the COVID-19 virus are harder to prevent.Virus-caused zoonotic diseases, in particular, are challenging due to their high outbreak frequency, rapid progression, and active mutations. <Important Facts About Zoonotic Diseases> âª Zoonotic diseases encompass all diseases or infections that can naturally be transmitted from vertebrate animals to humans.âª There are over 200 known types of zoonotic diseases.âª Zoonotic diseases account for a significant portion of new and existing diseases in humans.âª Some zoonotic diseases, like rabies, can be 100% prevented through vaccination and other methods.<Source: World Health Organization (WHO)>â Q: What are the Main Causes of the Spread of Zoonotic Diseases? â A: Climate change is a significant factor in the spread of zoonotic diseases. Recent studies show that climate change, causing temperature rises and changes in precipitation patterns in some areas, has led many wild animals to migrate to new habitats, similar to how we seek cooler places during summer vacations. We now live in the âAnthropocene Epochâ in Earthâs 4.6 billion-year history, when the dominant influence on Earth is mankind. Human-induced environmental destruction has triggered significant changes in the Earth's systems, and the increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is altering our planet's ecosystems.If you're curious about how humans have altered Earth's systems,check out the following article!âââWhat is Anthropocene?Living Planet Report 2022As a result, diseases once confined to tropical regions are now spreading to cooler areas, impacting the spread of diseases like malaria.(Image Source: CFR)Global warming is also affecting the spread of disease vectors like mosquitoes and ticks. It's akin to seeing more mosquitoes as summer lengthens. These vectors are sensitive to weather changes, especially becoming more active as temperature and humidity increase.As the Earth's temperature and humidity rise, diseases transmitted by ticks, such as Lyme disease, are significantly increasing in North America.â Trend of Zoonotic Disease Outbreaks âOver the past 100 years, there has been a continuous increase in zoonotic diseases. According to reports by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), it is estimated that about 1 billion cases of zoonotic diseases occur globally each year, leading to millions of deaths.Notably, COVID-19, which emerged in 2019, has caused the death of 15 million people (as of the end of 2021).The future outlook is even more grim.In 2022, a research team from the Department of Biology and the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University in the United States published shocking research results in the journal 'Nature.' They predicted that by 2070, about 15,000 new cross-species viral infections would emerge.As the world becomes interconnected as a single living area, viruses freely cross borders, making global cooperation imperative for infectious disease response.â Q: What are the Major Zoonotic Diseases? â A: There are about 250 known zoonotic diseases, with over 100 significantly impacting human health. Some prominent zoonotic diseases include Anthrax, Brucellosis, Enterohemorrhagic E. coli infection, Rabies (hydrophobia), Japanese Encephalitis, and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (v-CJD).While most can be prevented through vaccination and hygienic practices, newly emerging diseases are difficult to prevent, as seen in the COVID-19 pandemic, causing substantial global damage.Newly emerged zoonotic diseases include highly pathogenic avian influenza (AI), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Nipah virus infection, and Hendra virus infection.Approximately 60% of newly reported infectious diseases worldwide are zoonotic. In the last 30 years, over 30 new human pathogens have been discovered, 75% of which originated from animals, indicating a significant increase in zoonotic diseases.â Response to Zoonotic Diseases âThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a tremendous impact on global health, society, and the economy, resulting in over 15 million deaths and completely altering the daily lives of people worldwide.This crisis has highlighted the importance of international cooperation and a strong public health system.UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres, responsible for global peace, emphasized the need for transboundary cooperation: âThe world must prepare for the next pandemic and act according to the lessons learned from COVID-19.âAs he stated, prevention and control of zoonotic diseases are now essential not only for health but also for world peace and stability.To achieve this, cooperation between veterinary and human health sectors and comprehensive strategies are necessary. On an individual level, practicing eco-friendly living is also vital.What about starting with not consuming wildlife indiscriminately, practicing sustainable consumption, raising awareness about climate change, and participating in environmental protection activities?If you're curious about sustainable consumption and production,check out the following article!âââSustainable consumption and production to save the planetFind the answer in nature through Nature-based SolutionsâWe coexist on one planet, and human health is inseparably linked to the health of the planet.â-AntÃ³nio Guterres, UN Secretary-General-Learn More: What is Anthropocene?

In this article, we will explore the meaning, current state, and challenges of Universal Health Coverage. --- (Photo Credit : The New York Times) Tragic Photos Related to COVID-19 in Africa The COVID-19 virus has spread worldwide, but its severity varied significantly from country to country. South Korea has a robust national health insurance system that provides extensive medical services to all citizens, which became a crucial asset in protecting the population from the virus's onslaught. In contrast, the healthcare systems in developing countries, including Africa and South America, were utterly unprepared to halt the spread of the virus and treat patients. Millions died, and communities and economies suffered irreversible damage. This stark contrast powerfully illustrates how deadly the absence of Universal Health Coverage can be. â Q. What is Universal Health Coverage (UHC)? â A. Universal Health Coverage (UHC) means ensuring that everyone can access the essential quality medical services they need, without discrimination. Imagine our society as a large ship. Universal Health Coverage is like providing every passenger on this ship with life jackets and emergency medical kits. Just as anyone who falls ill or gets injured during the voyage should be able to receive the necessary medical services, regardless of their deck, UHC guarantees that everyone can access medical services when needed. UHC goes beyond just access to healthcare; it encompasses disease prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and health promotion. It is a comprehensive concept that is one of the main global health goals emphasized by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations (UN), aiming to ensure the health of all and prevent financial ruin. When everyone is healthy, the whole society can thrive more stably and prosperously! Thus, Universal Health Coverage plays a vital role in maintaining the health and safety of the entire society. â Q: What does Universal Health Coverage guarantee? â (Photo Credit : ARHRC) A: The World Health Organization (WHO) aligns Universal Health Coverage (UHC) with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically targeting Goal 3: \"Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages.\" To achieve this, WHO proposes specific objectives including: â Provision of essential quality health services: âª Preventive services: Immunizations, maternal health check-ups, disease prevention campaigns, etc. âª Treatment services: Emergency care, surgeries, cancer treatments, etc. âª Rehabilitation services: Physical therapy, occupational rehabilitation, etc. âª Health promotion: Nutritional counseling, exercise programs, mental health services, etc. â Reduction of financial hardship in accessing health care: âª Healthcare cost burden: Household expenditure on health, protection against costly healthcare. âª Insurance benefits: Coverage of health insurance, support for premiums, public health assistance, etc. â Ensuring healthcare services for everyone: âª Protection for vulnerable groups: Ensuring medical accessibility for low-income families, people with disabilities, rural residents, and other socially vulnerable groups. âª Regional balance: Balancing the quality and accessibility of healthcare services between urban and rural areas, as well as among different regions. â Providing high-quality healthcare services: âª Improving patient satisfaction: Surveys on patients' experiences and satisfaction. âª Enhancing service efficiency and effectiveness: Rates of disease treatment, effectiveness of preventive services, medical error rates, etc. This framework is part of the broader goal to reduce global health inequalities and promote a healthier life and well-being for all.

However, recent years have seen a halt in progress (refer to Figure 3b). As of 2021, nearly half of the world's population, approximately 4.5 billion people, are unable to access essential health services. In 2019, around 2 billion people faced financial hardship due to out-of-pocket medical expenses, with 340 million of these individuals falling into extreme poverty. The countries shaded in darker colors on the map below are those that have seen significant increases in their health service scores. The improvement varies from country to country, with some not improving at all and others increasing by as much as 39 points. Most countries (85 in total) have seen improvements of about 20-29 points compared to the year 2000. However, since the launch of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals in 2015, the global index has only increased by 3 points, with few countries experiencing significant improvements (refer to Figure 3b). This indicates a clear need for further action. The graph below shows a cluster of points in the bottom right corner, representing countries that made progress in UHC between 2000 and 2015. Yet, the top left corner, representing the change in health coverage between 2016 and 2021, is almost empty of points, signifying little to no progress in UHC advancement during this period. This graph clearly demonstrates the urgent need for increased efforts and support for global Universal Health Coverage. Download the report âââ Tracking universal health coverage 2023 global monitoring report â Lessons Learned from the COVID-19 Pandemic â The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global health and social crisis, highlighting the critical need for Universal Health Coverage (UHC) more than ever. Furthermore, the pandemic has underscored the importance of international cooperation in addressing global health crises. This is because viruses know no borders. Even high-income countries cannot be safe if any part of the world is vulnerable to an outbreak. If universal health services were established for everyone around the globe, humanity could respond more effectively to new pandemics. Just as life jackets must be provided to everyone on board a ship without discrimination, when essential health services are equitably provided to every global citizen, we all can enjoy a safer and happier life. \"Universal health coverage is a political choice. It takes vision, courage, and long-term thinking. But the payoff is a safer, fairer, and healthier world for everyone.\" Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General Learn more : Every human being has the right to be curedReference : World Health Organization; World Bank. 2023. \"Tracking Universal Health Coverage: 2023 Global Monitoring Report.\" World Health Organization and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development / The World Bank.

In this article, we explore the concept of Gender Neutrality, a crucial topic for achieving gender equality, and look into its practical applications. â Q: What is Gender Neutrality? â (Photo credits : The Guardian) A: Gender Neutrality means not categorizing or assuming people's genders. It encompasses a perception beyond social, cultural, and physical differences. Traditionally, our society has been divided into two genders: 'male' and 'female', the so-called âbinaryâ distinction. However, a gender-neutral perspective recognizes the right of everyone to freely express themselves beyond this binary division. For example, if all the scientists pictured in elementary school science textbooks are male, female students might think being a scientist is irrelevant and inaccessible to them. Gender Neutrality aims to correct such ingrained gender biases in society. The concept of Gender Neutrality has been around for years. Philosopher Michel Foucault first used the term in an academic context in his 1976 book \"The History of Sexuality,\" which brought wider attention to the concept. Over time, this concept has gained increasing interest. It emphasizes the need for a gender-transcending approach in various fields. â Examples of Gender Neutrality â There are various ways to practice Gender Neutrality. Let's look at specific examples in three areas: language, products, and policies. â Use Gender-Neutral Language! Practicing Gender Neutrality in language means not classifying people by gender. For instance, using gender-neutral pronouns like 'they' instead of 'he' or 'she.' Also, it's important to use gender-neutral terms in job titles. For example, use 'firefighter' instead of 'fireman' or 'firewomanâ. Such changes in language help people move away from gender stereotypes and embrace and respect diversity. This is especially important in educational environments like schools. â Create Gender-Neutral Products! Gender-neutral products are designed not for a specific gender but for everyone to use. For example, some clothing brands offer gender-neutral apparel, not specifically for men or women. These clothes focus on individual taste and comfort, eliminating gender distinctions in size and design. Admittedly, in some areas, it may take some getting used to. All in all, it amounts to broadening our minds. A similar change is seen in toys. Instead of 'boys' toys' or 'girls' toys,' companies are increasingly making toys that all children can enjoy. This change helps children freely explore their interests without being constrained by gender. (Photo credits : Mattel) â Implement Gender-Neutral Policies! Gender-neutral policies aim to respect everyone's gender identity and prevent discrimination. For instance, many schools and workplaces in Europe and America have introduced gender-neutral bathrooms. These facilities are available for all genders, replacing traditional 'male' or 'female' bathrooms. Another example is the introduction of gender-unspecified IDs. These IDs use 'X' or other gender-neutral markers instead of 'Male (M)' or 'Female (F)', acknowledging various gender identities. Gender-neutral education policies are also a significant change. Sweden, for instance, actively implements gender-neutral education policies. They avoid gender-divided classes or activities, encourage students to freely explore their interests, and include educational content that challenges gender stereotypes. â Q: Why is Gender Neutrality Important? â A: Gender Neutrality is crucial because it provides equal opportunities for everyone. When expectations and roles based on gender are eliminated, everyone can live their life freely according to their abilities and interests. âª Reduction of Gender Stereotypes and Prejudices: Gender Neutrality helps reduce discrimination and violence based on gender, creating an environment where everyone can freely express and explore themselves. âª Expanded Consumer Choices: Gender-neutral marketing offers consumers a wider range of choices. Toys not divided by gender allow all children to choose based on their preferences. âª Economic Benefits: A gender-neutral approach fosters an atmosphere that moves away from gender-based roles and expectations, leading to more innovation and productivity. Increasing the number of women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields can lead to more diverse innovations!

This report highlights issues such as women's poverty, lack of leadership opportunities, and limited participation in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM), showcasing a male-dominated world structure. For instance, the percentage of women familiar with programming languages is only half that of men, and women inventors listed in international patent applications are only a fifth of their male counterparts. To address this imbalance, the adoption and implementation of gender-neutral policies are necessary. If you're curious about a gender-equal world, check out our next article! âââ Creating a Gender Equal World Report Download âââ Progress on the sustainable development goals: The gender snapshot 2023 * This report is the latest in an annual series produced jointly by UN Women and UN DESA. It provides a comprehensive analysis of gender equality progress across all 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). â Now, We Need Gender-Neutral AI! â (Photo Credit : Koalition Interactive, Koalition Interactive has introduced the first gender-neutral AI tool.) Recently, a gender-neutral approach has become crucial in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). For example, early voice recognition technology was developed mainly for male voices, leading to difficulties in recognizing female voices. This was because most developers were men. A more diverse development team, including various genders, can create fairer and more inclusive AI. The importance of gender equality is also emphasized in the scientific community. Historically, most medical research focused mainly on men, primarily because most researchers were male. However, recent trends are promoting participation from diverse genders, including women. Especially in heart disease research, there's an increasing number of studies highlighting the differences between men and women. These studies are crucial in developing treatments suitable for everyone. Gender-neutral language and policies play a vital role in facilitating these changes. If both men and women participate equally in all professions, our society will naturally become more equal. â For a Better Future â These changes go beyond just language or policy adjustments. They contribute to a deeper understanding and respect for gender in our society. George Orwell's masterpiece, '1984', delves deeply into how language can limit thought and how it affects an individual's perception of the world. Individuals living in a gender-biased language and system are inevitably shaped to have a biased reality perception and worldview. Correcting this towards gender neutrality can lead us to a more equal society. Change always starts with a single step. How about starting to use gender-neutral language in schools and communities and pondering how to actively realize diversity and inclusivity? âAchieving gender equality requires the engagement of women and men, girls and boys.

This article explores the history of conflict in this area, known as 'the world's largest prison,' and examines potential solutions.â Q: What is the Gaza Strip? â(Photo credits : Ai-monitor) A: The Gaza Strip is an isolated area enclosed by the Mediterranean Sea and Israel, spanning about 365 square kilometers (141 square miles), and is one of the most densely populated regions in the world, with over 2 million inhabitants. The Gaza Strip has a complex political and historical background. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, it has been a focal point of conflict between Palestine and Israel.Currently, it's part of the Palestinian Authority, with the Islamist armed faction Hamas exercising actual control.The economy of the Gaza Strip faces significant challenges due to blockades by Israel and Egypt. The region struggles with high unemployment, poverty, and limited infrastructure and resources.Despite having a population exceeding 2 million, the absence of an airport and extremely restricted access to borders and territorial waters have led to the Gaza Strip being referred to as 'the world's largest prison.'In October 2023, renewed clashes between Israel and Hamas in the area posed a threat to world peace. This ongoing conflict perpetuates continuous tension and insecurity for the residents of the region.The yellow area on the left represents the Gaza Strip, a Palestinian self-governing region.Source: Getty Images Koreaâ The Gaza Strip Conflict: History and Current Situation âThe conflict in the Gaza Strip has a long history that has developed over centuries, originating from ethnic and political discord between Israel and Palestine, continuing from the mid-20th century to the present.History of the Gaza Strip Conflict â 13th Century BC: Migration of Jews and Philistines Jews, having escaped from Egypt, migrated to Canaan (now the Palestinian region), considered the promised land. Simultaneously, the sea people, the Philistines (ancestors of Palestinians), also migrated to the southern coast, sparking territorial disputes between the two peoples. â AD 135: Jewish Diaspora The Jews were expelled from Canaan by the Roman Empire and were forcibly dispersed to places like the Iberian Peninsula. â 1947-1949: Establishment of Israel and the Start of Conflict The conflict intensified with the establishment of Israel in 1947, following a UN resolution. During this period, Gaza was under the Arab government of Palestine. â 1950-1960s: Israeli Occupation and Escalation of Conflict Following the Third Middle East War, Israel began to rule the Gaza Strip from 1967, deepening the conflict between Palestine and Israel. â 1960-1980s: Six-Day War and Continued Occupation In the Six-Day War of 1967, Israel not only occupied the Gaza Strip but also the West Bank and the Golan Heights, complicating the conflict in Gaza. In the early 1980s, Israel began building Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip. â 1990s: Oslo Peace Process and Hope In 1993, the Oslo Peace Accords between Israel and Palestine led to the lifting of some military controls in the Gaza Strip, raising hopes and expectations for peace. â 2000s-Present: Ongoing Conflict and War However, from the 2000s to 2024, the Gaza Strip has continued to experience ongoing conflict and war. The conflict between Israel and Hamas has escalated, with residents suffering from infrastructure destruction and loss of life.â Q: What are the Causes of the Gaza Strip Conflict? â(Photo credits : BBC) A: The Gaza Strip conflict stems from a complex web of causes, primarily driven by nationalism, land ownership disputes, and economic interests. Various stakeholders vying for control of the region continue to clash with opposing groups, perpetuating the ongoing conflict. â Ethnic Conflict: The ethnic discord between Israel and Palestine is central to the Gaza Strip conflict. Israel is based on Jewish nationalism, while Palestine shares Arab ethnicity and Islamic faith. â Land Ownership: The issue of land ownership is at the heart of the Gaza Strip conflict. This area has been a battleground for land disputes between Israel and Palestine for a long time. 1. Border Area Disputes: The boundary issues between Israel and Palestine are a major element of the conflict, especially in the Gaza Strip's border areas, where disputes over agricultural land and fishing rights are frequent. 2. Land Abandonment and Development Disputes: Within the Gaza Strip, individual disputes arise over ownership and rights to use housing and agricultural land. 3. Jewish Settlement Disputes: In the 1980s, Israel began building Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip, complicating the issues of land ownership and usage rights. â Economic Interests: The Gaza Strip's economy is extremely fragile. Economic activities mostly depend on international aid and smuggling due to barriers and sea routes controlled by Israel.According to IMF data, as of 2020, the unemployment rate was 45%, the poverty rate was 53%, and 65.9% of households were in a food crisis.ââ Q: What is the Two-State Solution? âA: The 'Two-State Solution' proposes the creation of two states for Jews and Arabs and has been suggested as a resolution for almost a century.â In 1947, the UN adopted a plan to divide Palestine into two states for Arabs and Jews, with the religiously significant Jerusalem under international administration. However, this plan was rejected by Palestinian and Arab leaders, and Israel declared independence.â The Oslo Accords of the 1990s reignited discussions about the Two-State Solution but ultimately failed. The accords led to the establishment of the Palestinian Authority, which has limited self-governance in some occupied areas, but significant differences in opinions persist between the two sides.â In October 2023, the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas brought the Two-State Solution back into international focus. However, as of 2024, Israeli occupation continues, and the expansion of Israeli settlements and the rights to an independent Palestinian state remain indefinitely postponed.In this context, the Two-State Solution still faces challenges. It requires major concessions from both sides: Israel would have to give up current land, and Palestine would have to forfeit most of the territory lost since 1948. With neither side willing to compromise, the parallel lines between them have not converged.â For Peace in the Gaza Strip â(Photo Credits : Reuters)Resolving the Gaza Strip conflict is a lengthy journey towards peace in the Middle East. In this process, cooperation among the international community, Israel, Palestine, and other regional stakeholders is essential. Several key elements are needed for this: â Resumption of Political Dialogue Reinitiating political dialogue between Palestine and Israel is crucial. Both sides must seek peaceful solutions through dialogue. â Strengthening Multilateral Negotiations It's important to reinforce multilateral negotiations based on the 'Two-State Solution.' Active participation from not only Israel and Palestine but also the UN, the USA, and other international stakeholders is necessary. â Infrastructure Reconstruction and Humanitarian Aid The infrastructure in the Gaza Strip has been severely damaged due to ongoing conflicts. The international community should contribute to improving the quality of life for residents through infrastructure reconstruction and humanitarian aid. â Increasing Education and Cultural Exchange Enhancing education and cultural exchanges between Palestine and Israel is vital. It's important to instill a culture of understanding and respect in the younger generation. This can lay the groundwork for long-term peace as part of the 'Two-State Solution.'âUrgent efforts to improve the situation in Gaza must move forward swiftly, but let us not lose sight of the broader goal: resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, ending the occupation and realizing a two-State solution on the basis of UN resolutions, international law and bilateral agreementsâ, she said, speaking from Jerusalemâ- Lynn Hastings, Deputy Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process -Learn more : What is a forcibly displaced population?

The only escape route from the Gaza Strip is through Rafah, Egypt. Currently, in Rafah, most refugees from the Gaza Strip are living in makeshift structures, tents, or are homeless. This dire site, often called a âcauldron of despair,â has seen a massive influx of the majority of the Gaza Strip's population, forming refugee camps. Rafah, Egypt, presents to us the current state of the global forcibly displaced population issue. â Q. What is a forcibly displaced population? â A. The forcibly displaced population encompasses individuals who have been compelled to leave their home country due to natural disasters, human rights violations, wars, internal conflicts, and social instability, among other reasons. These are people who had to migrate due to external forces. Agencies like the International Organization for Migration (IOM), a UN body, categorize the forcibly displaced population into the following types: âª Refugees Refugees are individuals who have received international recognition and have migrated to another country based on international cooperation. They require international protection and assistance and migrate due to facing severe human rights abuses or violence in their home country based on race, religion, nationality, political opinions, etc. âª Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) IDPs have moved to safer areas within their own country and often do not receive international protection or assistance. âª Newly Displaced Persons These are individuals who have had to urgently migrate due to sudden wars, internal conflicts, or natural disasters, often relocating within their own country. âª Non-Returnable Migrants Non-returnable migrants are those who cannot return to their country of origin. Often, it's legally impossible or their safety cannot be guaranteed, necessitating long-term protection and solutions.

What is the current state of the forcibly displaced population? â A. According to the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and its âGlobal Trends 2022â report, by the end of 2022, approximately 108.4 million people worldwide were forcibly displaced from their homes. Refugees account for about 35.3 million, Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) for about 62.5 million, Asylum seekers who have applied for asylum number around 5.4 million, and People in need of international protection are about 5.2 million. From the graph below, it's evident that the population of forcibly displaced individuals has significantly increased since around 2010. While children constitute 30% of the global population (grey), they represent 40% of those forcibly displaced (color). The report highlights that Turkey hosts the largest number of refugees globally, with about 3.6 million, followed by Iran with 3.4 million, Colombia with 2.5 million, Germany with 2.1 million, and Pakistan with 1.7 million.

The reasons for forced displacement can vary by country, region, and situation, often resulting from a combination of multiple factors. The main causes include: âª War and Internal Conflicts War and internal conflicts are among the most significant causes of forced displacement. Conflicts like the Israel-Hamas war, the Syrian civil war, the Russia-Ukraine war, the internal conflict in Yemen, and the unstable situation in Afghanistan have forced many people to flee. Most of these individuals have sought refuge in neighboring countries to escape bombings. âª Human Rights Violations and Political Oppression In many countries, political reasons lead to oppression or human rights violations. In such circumstances, many people migrate to seek freedom and safety elsewhere. For example, in North Korea, human rights violations and political oppression have driven many to flee to South Korea or other countries. âª Natural Disasters and Climate Change Natural disasters like floods, earthquakes, and storms force many to evacuate to safer areas for survival. Additionally, climate change has led to droughts, food shortages, and resource depletion worldwide, prompting people to leave their homes. âª Economic Difficulties and Poverty In some countries, the lack of job opportunities or economic hardship makes it difficult for many to sustain a living. Seeking better opportunities, they migrate to other places. Especially in developing countries, poverty drives many to choose migration. âª Cultural Conflicts and Racial Discrimination When cultural, religious, or racial conflicts and discrimination occur, some people migrate to find safer or more accepting environments. These varied causes interact in complex ways, contributing to the increasing global population of forcibly displaced individuals. â Q. How can we solve the issue of the forcibly displaced population? â A. To address the issue of the forcibly displaced population, we all need to foster a global citizenship with an open heart and collaborate across borders. âª Cultivating an Open Global Citizenship Forced displacement is an unavoidable phenomenon. We must create a social atmosphere that warmly welcomes and includes new neighbors who are forcibly displaced individuals. As Kant emphasized in his \"Perpetual Peace,\" all humans have the right to be hospitably received anywhere. This means forcibly displaced individuals should be protected to live safely in new environments, ensuring their dignity and equal rights are respected. âª Strengthening International Cooperation The issue of forced displacement cannot be resolved by a single country alone; it is a transnational issue. Therefore, countries must join hands to protect the rights of migrants and work together for their social and economic integration. International organizations like the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) are already supporting migrants and refugees. They lead in developing policies for smooth movement and resettlement of these individuals. Addressing the forcibly displaced population problem requires comprehensive efforts, including policy reforms, fostering inclusive societies, and enhancing international partnerships to ensure the protection and integration of displaced individuals into new communities. â For a Better World â Looking back through history, humanity has always been on a quest for a better environment. We are all 'Homo Migrans', humans on the move in search of a better life. The refugees from the Gaza Strip, along with all forcibly displaced individuals worldwide, can be seen as participants in humanity's collective journey towards a better life as 'Homo Migrans'. Migration sometimes causes chaos and disorder and challenges the existing order, but wise humanity has always ultimately sought peace, regardless of the circumstances. We should warmly embrace these individuals with the spirit of hospitality Kant spoke of, as we strive for a better world peace. In this shared journey, each step towards understanding, support, and cooperation not only aids those in immediate need but also contributes to the fabric of a more compassionate and equitable global community. Let us continue to open our hearts and borders, in the spirit of global citizenship, to build a more inclusive and peaceful world for all. âForced migrants are not merely statistics or numbers. They are human beings with rights and dignity equal to our own. We must listen to their stories and empathize with their suffering.â - AntÃ³nio Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations - Learn more : One Hundred Million Refugees Around the Globe Syrian refugees dream of a safe home Who are Climate Refugees? As the world gets smaller, we need to become global citizens who solve global challenges together Written by: Yeon Je Choi\n\nPeace Issue What is Carbon Tax?\n\nCarbon Tax is a tax imposed on the carbon content of fossil fuels, such as oil and coal, as a means to combat climate change. In this article, weâll take a closer look at the meaning of carbon tax, how it works, and how itâs being implemented around the world. â Q. What is Carbon Tax? â A. Carbon Tax is a tax imposed on businesses based on the carbon emissions produced during the manufacturing goods and services. It establishes a baseline for emissions and charges for exceeding that limit. Here is the definition of a carbon tax according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD): A carbon tax is âan instrument of environmental cost internalisation. It is an excise tax on the producers of raw fossil fuels based on the relative carbon content of those fuels.â â Effects of a Carbon Tax Businesses face higher taxes for increased carbon emissions, and they will be incentivized to reduce emissions and use energy more efficiently by developing alternative energy sources and other carbon-reducing technologies. Governments benefit by collecting revenue from carbon taxes, which can then be invested in clean energy development and climate adaption. On the way to carbon neutrality to curb climate change, more countries are looking for ways to reduce their carbon emissions, and carbon tax can play a very important role in this process.

The Glaciers are Sending Us a Warning â Carbon Tax vs. Emission Trading System â If you are confused about the difference between Carbon Tax and the Emission Trading System, you are not alone. Most countries that have introduced a Carbon Tax have also adapted the Emission Trading System (ETS). Letâs find out how they are different. While a carbon tax sets a price on each unit of emissions without a limit to the amount that can be emitted, the Emission Trading System (ETS) defines a maximum level of pollution (a âcapâ), therefore often called the cap-and-trade program. An ETS allocates a certain amount of credits to large greenhouse gas emitters and allows them to buy and sell any excess or surplus credits. Carbon TaxEmission Trading System - Levied directly on companies emitting greenhouse gases or producing fuels with emissions. - Higher taxes on goods and services with more emissions. - Sets a cap on total emissions, requiring permits for businesses to emit greenhouse gases. - Price of a license fluctuates based on market dynamics.If you want to learn more about carbon policies, Check out this article! âââ Levying a Tax even on Carbon! â Carbon Pricing Initiatives Worldwide â Carbon tax was first introduced in Finland in 1990, followed by Sweden and Norway in 1991, Denmark in 1992, and Germany in 1999. According to the German Federal Ministry for Environment, Germany has experienced a substantial decline in carbon emissions following the implementation of the carbon tax. In 1990, Germanyâs carbon emissions totaled about 1,261 million tons, which decreased to 726 million tons in 2021, marking a reduction of about 42%. This successful reduction can be attributed to a multifaceted approach, which includes the development of renewable energy sources, enhancements in energy efficiency, and the implementation of environmental protection and climate response policies. Other strategies, including the Emission Trading System, credit mechanisms, and internal carbon pricing, also contribute to the broader framework of carbon pricing policies. As of June 2022, 68 carbon pricing instruments operate in 46 countries, comprising 36 carbon tax regimes and 32 Emission Trading Systems, according to the World Bank. The increasing severity of climate change has prompted governments and businesses worldwide to intensify their endeavors in curbing carbon emissions. The global shift towards carbon neutrality and the regulation of carbon emissions reflects a collective response to the escalating challenges posed by climate change.

Source: World Bank â European Union The EUâs Emission Trading System covers 11,000 plants across member states, including the UK, Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein. â China China has become the worldâs largest carbon market in 2021, three times the size of the European Unionâs. China is on its way to soon covering more emissions that the rest of the worldâs carbon market put together. Its goal is to reach carbon neutrality by 2060. â United States The U.S. is one of the biggest carbon emitting countries in the world. While lacking a national carbon tax, several U.S. states, including California, Oregon, Washington, Hawaii, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts, have implemented carbon pricing schemes. â India India contributes to about 7% of the worldâs carbon emissions and is the third largest emitter after China and the United States. India does not levy tax on carbon emissions directly, but it taxes imported and domestically produced thermal coal since 2010. â Africa African countries, including South Africa, Uganda, Nigeria, and Rwanda, are adopting carbon taxes. South Africa was one of the first emerging economies to introduce carbon tax in 2019, and other countries have joined in the efforts to reduce environmental pollution. â The Efficiency of Carbon Tax: A Crucial Climate Change Tool â Many economists advocate for a carbon tax as the most efficient and cost-effective method to combat climate change. By making high emitters pay more taxes, it encourages the transition to cleaner alternatives. The generated revenue supports environmental protection and sustainable energy development. Currently, out of the nine threshold boundaries that must be preserved for sustainable human development, six of them are said to be at critical levels. Itâs no secret that our reckless emissions are the main culprit behind global environmental degradation.

Reducing carbon emissions is crucial for preserving the planet and making our planet a safer place to live in for the future generations. Governments, businesses, and individuals can collectively make a difference by implementing policies, adopting sustainable practices, and reducing carbon footprints. âWe are the first generation to feel the impact of climate change and the last generation that can do something about it.â -Anote Tong Sunahk Peace Prize Laureate- Related Articles: What are Planetary Boundaries?
