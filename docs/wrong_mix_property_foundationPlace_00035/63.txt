âAirport Donetskâ wins prestigious Russian documentary film prize

An unflinching portrait of one of the epic battles in the war between Russia and Ukraine has been named the Best Non-Fiction Short TV Film in Russiaâs prestigious ArtDocFestÂ film festival, and brought new recognition to Current Timeâs intrepid journalistic team.

âAirport Donetsk,â conceived by Shahida Tulaganova and directed by Andrey Erastov, traces the contours of the 200-day fight for the airport in the eastern Ukrainian city of Donetsk. Raw footage and deeply personal interviews portray the last days of the battle as the airport falls to the separatists. The film features the testimony of commanders and fighters on both sides, and is told in their words.

In awarding the prize, ArtDocFest Director Vitaliy Manskii said âAirport Donetskâ was one of the most emotionally strong films of this year. The filmâs Executive Editor, Kenan Aliyev, described it as âa raw portrait of war…that will challenge audiences on both sides of the battlefield.â Vice News correspondent Simon Ostrovsky called it âa microcosm of the war that anyone wanting to understand the tragedy of Ukraine should watch.â
