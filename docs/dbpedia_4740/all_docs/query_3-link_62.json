        "text": "Direct access to the talented minds pouring out from the University of Texas at Austin has been a driving force behind the growth of the Austin tech ecosystem. The school had over 51,000 students this past year after recording its highest on-time graduation rate ever at 66 percent last year.\n\nWhile many students get scooped up by local companies soon after graduating, others jump headfirst into launching businesses of their own. That’s especially true for those who have just earned degrees from UT’s prestigious McCombs School of Business.\n\nTo give you a taste of the university’s impact on the city, here are 35 founders you should know who rocked the “Horns Up” before entering the tech industry as head honchos of their own ventures.\n\nCam Houser launched 3 Day Startup in 2008 while attending McCombs School of Business. The nonprofit provides entrepreneurial education to university students in a shortened accelerator format. Since its launch, 3 Day Startup has graduated nearly 13,000 students from 30 countries across 179 schools. Over 130 companies have launched through the program, collectively raising more than $157 million in investments.\n\nAfter graduating from Wake Forest University with a degree in economics, Thomas Allen attended UT for his MBA, which he earned in 2007. In 2012, Allen launched AgileLaw, a legal tech company that develops software solutions for attorneys.\n\nThree UT alumni joined forces in the launch of Apptronik, a three-year-old startup that’s creating human-centered robotics, electric actuators, automation control systems and robotic educational tools.

Samuel is also formerly the VP of marketing at HomeAway.\n\nFollowing graduation with an MBA in environmental management and entrepreneurship in 2000, Amy George founded two companies.
