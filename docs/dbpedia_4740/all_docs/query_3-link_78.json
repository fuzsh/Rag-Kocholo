        "text": "Subscription-based software companies have changed the way today’s businesses operate, and their contributions continue to be an integral part of the future.\n\nSoftware as a Service (SaaS) companies provides significant value to customers by hosting applications on their servers over the internet. This model is also called the cloud or cloud-based service.\n\nUnlike traditional software, customers don’t need to create the infrastructure; they simply pay a fee to access the service often on a monthly or annual subscription for each user.\n\nIn a nutshell: SaaS companies provide instant access to apps in exchange for a subscription. All you need is your web browser or smartphone to enjoy the benefits without any startup costs.\n\nIn 2008, only 12% of businesses used cloud-based apps. Today, it’s entirely the opposite. According to a report from BetterCloud, 73% of organizations said nearly all of their apps would be SaaS in 2020.\n\nIn 2019, Gartner updated its online cloud forecast predicting SaaS revenues will total $266.4 billion in 2020. The global analyst firm expects that revenues will rise by 16% in 2021.\n\nIn this massive article, we’ve rounded up the top SaaS companies that have changed the way work. But before we get to the list, let’s learn more about SaaS and why it matters for businesses.\n\nWhy Businesses Use SaaS\n\nBuying and using the latest SaaS products can be overwhelming. There are indeed thousands of them out there.\n\nIt’s hard to imagine running a business today without the luxury of modern SaaS software. Gone are the days of solely using Microsoft Office for your office activities. Today, vast office suites are now available through SaaS subscriptions.\n\nWhy did the shift to the cloud happen?\n\nBusiness leaders focus on essential business applications software’s financial and operational impacts. They need to be agile, manage risk, and effect change quickly.\n\nBefore SaaS solutions, businesses of all sizes faced a few common problems: startup costs, maintenance, and inflexibility. Information Technology (IT) departments long held their tech stack close to the vest and have been perceived as adversarial to change. For a new application rollout, IT would often act as judge, jury, and executioner for new apps used in the office.\n\nThere had to be a better way. With SaaS, companies can adopt new software solutions at a much lower cost in a shorter amount of time.\n\nRelated: Business Listing Management: The Ultimate Guide for SMBs\n\nAn Example of SaaS Success\n\nLook no further than your email for a perfect example of how and why businesses use the cloud.\n\nAt a technical level, email requires many resources. It needs specialized servers to send and receive email messages, manage user credentials, filter spam, and on top of all that, apply software updates. Oh, and we didn’t even mention the IT staff doing it all.\n\nThe gradual reliance upon cloud-based services began in information technology (IT) leadership roles. Maintaining a secure, scalable, and reliable email system required extensive efforts for IT administrators.\n\nCIOs were initially reluctant to go all-in with the cloud. Over time, they moved their servers offsite using specialized hosting from Microsoft, Amazon, and Rackspace.\n\nEstablished leaders like Google and Microsoft offered ready-to-use email infrastructure (Gmail and Outlook, respectively) that required minimal resources to establish and maintain.\n\nToday, business leaders don’t even think twice about running their companies from the cloud—SaaS is how work gets done.\n\nTop 75 SaaS Companies of the Decade\n\nIt takes a wealth of research to know what tools your business needs. Out of thousands of SaaS apps, we’ve compiled an extensive list of 75 powerful SaaS solutions to grow your business,\n\nThis breakdown includes a company overview, CEO, and why it’s notable.\n\nCategories of SaaS Apps\n\nBusiness Communications\n\nMarketing\n\nSales\n\nWorkflow Automation\n\nAnalytics & Measurement\n\nFinance & Accounting\n\nHuman Resources\n\nProject Management\n\nWebsite Content\n\nBusiness Communications\n\n1) Cisco\n\nHeadquarters: San Jose, California\n\nType: Public Company\n\nCEO: Chuck Robbins\n\nTelecommunications juggernaut Cisco is an industry leader in networking, security, collaboration and more.
