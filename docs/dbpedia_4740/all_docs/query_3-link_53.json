Facebook\n\nFounded: 2004\n\nValuation: $914 Billion (source)\n\nCustomer: Ivy League University Students.\n\nProblem: You couldn't find and connect with your friends online.\n\nQuote: \"You could find music; you could find news; you could find information, but you couldn’t find and connect with the people that you cared about, which as people is actually the most important thing. So that seemed like a pretty big hole that needed to get filled.\" — Mark Zuckerberg on Freaknomics podcast, 2018 (source).\n\n3. Airbnb\n\nFounded: August 2008\n\nValuation: $100 Billion (source)\n\nCustomer: Conference attendees visiting San Francisco.\n\nProblem: Being broke and needing to pay higher rent.\n\nQuote: \"A letter came in the mail, it's from our landlord who politely states that our rent is 25% higher than it was the month before. I ran to my online banking and I was like, oh my god can I make rent next month. We started to think about how we could design our way out of this. ... There's a design conference that's coming to San Francisco. On the conference website in big red letters, it said 'HOTELS SOLD OUT' and I'm thinking 'Awh man what a bummer. Designers who want to come last minute won't have a place to stay.' In that instant, I look up around the living room thinking 'Wait, we have so much extra space here and I have airbeds in the closet.\" — Airbnb Co-Founder Joe Gebbia, August 2017 (source).\n\n4. Instagram\n\nFounded: 2009\n\nValuation: Acquired by Facebook for $1 Billion in April 2012.\n\nCustomer: Amateur photographers already on social media (source)\n\nProblem: Mobile photos looked crappy, they were time-consuming to upload and difficult to share with friends.\n\nQuote: \"You assume that you know exactly what you're going to tackle and the hard part is finding [and] scaling that solution. It turns out that the hard part is actually finding the problem to solve. Solutions actually come pretty easily for the majority of problems. So what we did was we listed out these five problems and the top three that we circled were (1) that mobile photos don't look so great ... (2) uploads on mobile phones take a really long time ... and the third problem was that we really wanted to allow you to share out to multiple services at once.\" — Instagram Co-Founder Kevin Systrom, Stanford lecture, May 2011 (source).\n\n6. Hubspot\n\nFounded: 2006\n\nValuation: $24.56 Billion (source)\n\nCustomer: \"Marketing Mary; a marketing manager who worked in a company of between 10 and 1000 employees.\" (source)\n\nProblem: SMBs don't have the internal expertise to build their own marketing-tech stack.\n\nQuote: \"Their problem was not a dearth of tools. The issues SMBs had was like, 'I'm a 20-person consulting company, I don't know how to take wordpress and hook it up to Google Analytics and all this. I just can't do that.\" — Hubspot Co-Founder Dharmesh Shah, SaaStr Annual Conference, July 2017 (source).\n\n7. Klarna\n\nFounded: 2005\n\nValuation: $45.6 Billion (source)\n\nCustomer: Swedish eCommerce companies that Co-Founder Sebastian Siemiatkowski had worked within a previous job.\n\nProblem: eCommerce companies struggled to secure their online payments.\n\nQuote: \"There was really a void to fill. This was before e-commerce had really taken off and a lot of people still viewed [online shopping] as very insecure - so if only that could be solved e-commerce was set to take off. Klarna took care of billing for the e-commerce companies and also made sure that private customers were given the opportunity to pay by invoice. In a nutshell: safer and more effective internet shopping.\" — Klarna Co-Founder Niklas Adalberth, Business Insider Nordic interview, May 2016 (source).\n\n8. Instacart\n\nFounded: 2012\n\nValuation: $39 Billion (source)\n\nCustomer: Working professionals in San Francisco without a car (source).\n\nProblem: Grocery shopping is a time-consuming and inefficient use of time every week.\n\nQuote: \"One thing that has been with me for as long as I can remember is the pain of grocery shopping. I have dreaded going to the grocery store. Once you get there, you have to circle through the aisles to find the items that you're looking for, then you have to wait in line to check out and then lug your groceries back to your apartment only to realize that you've forgotten something at the store. This was 2012 and we were buying everything online, but the one that all of us had to do every single week in the most inefficient means possible was [grocery shopping].\" — Instacart Co-Founder at Y Combinator Startup School, June 2014 (source).\n\n9. Telegram\n\nFounded: 2013\n\nValuation: $40 Billion (source)\n\nCustomer: Security conscious smartphone users (tbh, pretty broad from the start).\n\nProblem: Online messaging is dominated by companies with commercial and political ties that place sensitive end-user messages in potentially compromising and insecure situations.\n\nQuote: \"In 2012 my brother and I built an encrypted messaging app for our personal use – we wanted to be able to securely pass on information to each other, in an environment where WhatsApp and other tools were easily monitored by the authorities. After Edward Snowden’s revelations in 2013, we understood the problem was not unique to our situation and existed in other countries. So we released the encrypted messaging app for the general public.\" — Telegram Co-Founder Pavel Durov, Dazed Interview, April 2015 (source).\n\n10. Databricks\n\nFounded: 2013\n\nValuation: $28 Billion (source)\n\nCustomer: Data engineers and data analysts at large companies.\n\nProblem: Big data processing engines like MapReduce were too inefficient for the rapidly growing data lakes of the late 2000s.\n\nQuote: \"I first began Spark in 2009 to tackle the machine learning use case, because machine learning researchers in our lab at UC Berkeley were trying to use MapReduce for their algorithms and finding it very inefficient. After starting with this use case, we quickly realized that Spark could be useful beyond machine learning, and focused on designing a general computing engine with great libraries for building complete data pipelines. Databricks offers a cloud service that makes it easy to deploy Spark applications and work on data collaboratively in a team.\" — Apache Spark creator and Databricks Co-Founder Matei Zaharia, May 2015 (source). (Matei created open-source platform Apache Spark as well as its commercialization vehicle Databricks.)\n\n11. Canva\n\nFounded: January 2012\n\nValuation: $15 Billion (source)\n\nCustomer: Non-designer professionals like business owners and marketers (source)\n\nProblem: Digital design tools like photoshop were extremely complex and difficult to learn.\n\nQuote: \"The idea for Canva came about when I was at university. I was teaching design programs like Photoshop and InDesign. They were just so complicated and difficult; it would take a whole semester for people just to learn the basics. A lot of people cared about design and need to create great content but didn't have the tools.\" — Canva Co-Founder Melanie Perkins, May 2016 (source).\n\n12. Plaid\n\nFounded: May 2013\n\nValuation: $13.4 Billion (source)\n\nCustomer: Technical executives at companies building fintech solutions\n\nProblem: Companies had to build unique integrations for every single banking provider that they needed to integrate with.\n\nQuote: \"When Perret and William Hockey started the company, the original focus was on building tools for consumers to manage and track their personal finances. But they soon realized that this was extremely difficult to pull off because of the archaic processes of connecting to bank accounts. So this sparked an inspiration: Why not build a system to make this easier?\" — Forbes profile on Plaid acquisition attempt, January 2020 (source).\n\n16. Uber\n\nFounded: 2009\n\nValuation: $103.5 Billion (source)\n\nCustomer: Cold called black cab drivers to offer an hourly rate for supply-side, gave free rides at local tech events in San Francisco for the demand side.\n\nProblem: The unreliability of hailing a taxi.\n\nQuote: \"I was just stranded on the curb in San Francisco so often that I just got sick of it. I tried TaxiMagic—it was ok—Cabulous wasn't very good. So I was like, alright, we just gotta make our own.\" — Uber Co-Founder Garrett Camp, Google Zeitgeist interview, September 2016 (source).\n\n17. Brex\n\nFounded: 2017\n\nValuation: $7.4 Billion (source)\n\nCustomer: International early-stage startup founders in the US.\n\nProblem: Startups were unable to get a corporate credit card without taking a personal liability guarantee.\n\nQuote: \"We investigated [getting a corporate credit card] and figured out that we couldn’t get one. We went there and [the banks are] like, “Well you don’t have any financial history. We won’t give you [a credit card] unless you [can] personally guarantee.” But because we had just moved to the U.S. we couldn’t personally guarantee the card. We went to talk to a few of our batchmates and none of the international ones could get a card. A lot of the other ones chose not to get a card because they didn’t want to personally guarantee the card. There were all these people just using debit cards and like walking around with debit cards of $120,000 in the bank or just using their personal cards and all these things. We thought, “Okay, that has to be inefficient. There has to be a better way to do this.” Then that’s kind of how Brex came to be.\" — Brex Co-Founder Henrique Dubugras, June 2018 (source).\n\n18. Reddit\n\nFounded: 2005\n\nValuation: $6 Billion (source)\n\nCustomer: lol they had no initial target customer 🤷‍♂️\n\nProblem: There was no way to discover and discuss the best content of the day online.\n\nQuote: \"Del.icio.us was a social bookmarking website and there was a page called Popular, where you could see things that day that were being bookmarked and were popular. The thing is, when you bookmark something, it's because you can't finish it in one sitting. So Del.icio.us Popular was essentially this really cool index of the most boring content on the internet on any given day. We also loved Slashdot, which had this incredible community. You go there for news every day but really the magic lived in the comments section. So the idea was can we take the mechanics of Del.icio.us — user submitted content — and combine it with good content and good community. That was the genesis of Reddit.\" — Reddit Co-Founder Alexis Ohanian, NPR's How I Built This with Guy Raz, August 2017 (source).\n\n19. Square\n\nFounded: 2009\n\nValuation: $104.74 Billion (source)\n\nCustomer: Small merchants selling in person.\n\nProblem: Small merchants had no way of accepting credit card payments.\n\nQuote: \"Dorsey’s former boss and good friend (and eventual co-founder) Jim McKelvey lost a sale for his hand-blown glass because he had no way of accepting credit cards. The problem was one many people had—the barriers to setting yourself up through conventional processes to accept credit card payments were too high for many people. So Dorsey set about seeing if he could create a better system. The result was the Square reader.\" — FastCompany profile, May 2011 (source).\n\n20. Spotify\n\nFounded: 2006\n\nValuation: $72 Billion (source)\n\nCustomer: Music fans in the UK.\n\nProblem: Torrenting sites made music cheaply accessible at scale but they were slow, restricted to desktop devices and riddled with potential viruses.\n\nQuote: \"I realized that you can never legislate away from piracy. Laws can definitely help, but it doesn’t take away the problem. The only way to solve the problem was to create a service that was better than piracy and at the same time compensates the music industry – that gave us Spotify.\" — Spotify Co-Founder Daniel Ek, The Telegraph interview, February 2010 (source).\n\n21. Airtable\n\nFounded: 2013\n\nValuation: $5.77 Billion (source)\n\nCustomer: Non-technical individuals or small teams working on CRMs, ERP and Project Management.\n\nProblem: Using a spreadsheet as a makeshift database is very common but creates a bloated, messy, and frustrating experience for non-technical knowledge workers.\n\nQuote: \"90% of spreadsheets are not used for their intended purpose of numerical analysis but really they're used as a makeshift database. Things get really messy in this context, where you have long nodes fields, bloated rows, you can't attached files, you can't link different tables together of contacts and companies, that kind of thing. It's this really hack-ish makeshift solution that's filling in the gap today but is creating a lot of pain for many people.\" — Howie Liu, DataDrivenNYC Keynote, April 2015 (source).\n\n22. Discord\n\nFounded: 2015\n\nValuation: $7 Billion (source)\n\nCustomer: Online gamers playing social/multiplayer games.\n\nProblem: Tools for communicating with friends while gaming were slow, unreliable and complex.\n\nQuote: \"Discord was started to solve a big problem: how to communicate with friends around the world while playing games online.

It began when I applied for my first mortgage in late 2012. We reached out to the broker, but the broker didn’t respond to multiple calls and emails. We loved the place so much that we tried to contact the owner directly, but without a broker, the owner was skeptical of our legitimacy as buyers. Like most sellers, he asked that we provide a mortgage pre-approval, so I went online and searched all the big comparison websites. Once I gave them my data, I didn’t get the pre-approval I was searching for. In the end, the homeowner got fed up and sold the place to the next-highest bidder.\" — \"Why I Started Better Mortgage\" by Co-Founder Vishal Garg, August 2016 (source).\n\n28.

It was a good problem, of course, but we suddenly had a little bit of money for the first time and had to figure out how to make the most of it. Two of the company's founders started asking me about how they should invest. Even though I was only 25, I'd been interested in investing for a long time. So I tried to show them what I’d learned; I gave them a few books to read and made this spreadsheet for them that was designed to help them manage their own money. Everyone said the same thing: this is too boring, it takes too much time, it’s not what I’m good at, and it’s definitely not what I’m interested in. What they wanted was to have me do it for them.

I kept going to these tradeshows and thinking like, there really should be a better way to do this... If you ask a small shop owner what their favorite part of the job is, they'll say finding new products. Then if you ask them how many of the products that you carry are new it will be somewhere between 20-30%. That was where I started to dig into why and the answer always was because it's scary to bring on new products. If it doesn't sell, you're stuck. I realized they're going to trade shows to solve inventory risks, to get over that fear so that they can touch and feel the products and really feel good that this is something that's gonna do well in my store.\" — Faire Co-Founder Max Rhodes, edited quote from the Y Combinator Podcast.

One of the reasons I was excited about working at a place like Facebook was because it had this treasure-trove of data, really sophisticated analytics infrastructure, and all these fancy data scientists. What I found in practice, though, is that analytics is a big pain in the ass. If you have very simple questions about your product, those questions require literally months of time and me needing to loop-in three different people and engineer a set of implementations, a data analyst to make sense of the data once it’s been eventually collected in a single place. And if it takes three months to go from question to answer, guess what? You’re not going to use data to answer questions. So, the realization that we had with that experience was, if it’s this difficult to make good use of data at a place like Facebook, then what hope does the rest of the world have to use data effectively and to achieve this glorious data-informed future that everybody heads up?\" — Heap Co-Founder Matin Movassate, April 2021 (source).\n\n41.

It took a lot of time and resources to add intelligence to data, to make it usable for machine learning. There were no standardized tools or infrastructure, there was no AWS, or Stripe, or Twilio to solve this problem.

Some issues are irrelevant, some are worthy of batched alerts that should be reviewed in bulk at the end of a shift, some require immediate notification, and some require immediate attention and action by a SWAT team of engineers and the attention of the CEO.

In the next five years, merchants are going to start moving away from paying 2.5% plus 30 cents per transaction when fast secure alternatives become available. They're going to (at first) offer them at checkout alongside traditional credit card options, and then eventually start incentivizing consumers to make the switch. If Amazon has a 5% margin on a $100 text book they aren't going to give $2.00 of their $5 to Visa/MC forever. The same thing is going to happen in mobile.

The technology was incidental, an extension for the new company’s “real” product: a pivot table for big data built on Amazon Redshift. Redshift happened to be the fastest-growing product in Amazon’s history, and customers were looking to move data into Redshift from sources like Salesforce and Zendesk. So the Fivetran team built a few connectors to the pivot table’s Redshift backend. Then they got back to work. Word about the connectors spread, and an early customer contacted the Fivetran team and offered to pay for a Salesforce-Redshift data connector. Would they build it? “We already had a lot of customers saying, ‘Redshift’s working well for me, and my BI tool’s working well for me, but man, there are just no good data pipelines out there, and you guys say you have this data pipeline under the hood — I want to hear about that.’”\" — George Fraser, April 2019 (source).\n\n55.

Our problem is that we have this business process that we didn’t automate because it needed a signature, so if all you do is give me a signature, you didn’t really help my business. You just managed a little piece of it. So, we realized at that point we had to manage the entire document lifecycle.

Hotjar\n\nFounded: 2015\n\nValuation: Unknown (acquired in September 2021)\n\nCustomer: Product and UX teams.\n\nProblem: It's difficult to know what users are doing on your website.\n\nQuote: \"My domain expertise in this area (I worked with and consulted startups and global brands for 10+ years) was a huge advantage, as it gave me a very clear vision of what Hotjar would do, how it would be different, and the value it would generate to specific personas (I am the typical Hotjar user!).\" — Hotjar Co-Founder David Darmanin (source).\n\n65. Sendbird\n\nFounded: 2013\n\nValuation: $1 Billion (source)\n\nCustomer: Their entrepreneur friends.\n\nProblem: Consumer messaging apps like Telegram, Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger were all the rage but there was a lack of messaging apps for companies to communicate with consumers.\n\nQuote: \"So, when we first started out our journey in 2013, we started out as a B2C company trying to build a community for moms to plan play dates, buy and sell used baby products, and whatnot. We wanted to add a chat, and we looked around, tried a couple of different open source solutions, they didn’t really work out the way we wanted. So we ended up building everything from the ground up ourselves. Well the truth is, we were running out of money. On the sideline, we had a lot of friends in the industry who were trying to build a chat themselves. We were one of the first ones who build a chat among all our friend groups. So they started asking questions like, “Can we use your technology?” We were like, “Of course not. It’s our stuff.” And they’re like, “We’ll pay you.”\" — John Kim, December 2018 (source).\n\n66. LinkedIn\n\nFounded: 2002\n\nValuation: Acquired by Microsoft for $26.2 Billion (source)\n\nCustomer: Working professionals.\n\nProblem: There was no space online for 'real name' professional identities.\n\nQuote: \"The mistake around SocialNet was targeting a dating business versus doing the new category, which was working networks and professional networks. And I said, look the way the world was going to change, is everyone is going to have a real name identity on the World Wide Web, where that real name identity is going to be in different categories; there's going to be a social identity, there's going to be a professional identity. Social at that time what that big ramp of Friendster, this was well before Facebook and even before MySpace, and I said look, maybe Friendster was going to be the social identity, [LinkedIn] would be the professional identity. And so obviously the first application will be job hunting, talent finding, but eventually it will go to everything from sales and business partnerships to starting companies to finding information and staying expert to learning skills — all of this would be built on this platform but this is the first application in a set of applications.\" — LinkedIn Co-Founder Reid Hoffman, How I Built This podcast, January 2018 (source).\n\n67. Twitter\n\nFounded: 2004\n\nValuation: $35.5 Billion (source)\n\nCustomer: They never really got customers with their first product...\n\nProblem: Podcasting in 2004/5 was like the web pre-blogging; distribution without democratization of production.\n\nNote: \"What we're seeing is really the 1.0 of podcasting, which is similar to the 1.0 of the web; an awesome new distribution vehicle but the paradigm is still very similar to radio... Everything on print that moved to the web potentially had a greater audience, was more immediately accessible, was cheaper, but then things like blogs came around and introduced was a form of publishing that didn't exist in print that took advantage of the intrinsic qualities of the web. For podcasting, we haven't seen that yet. With podcasting there's that same potential, where it's going to evolve to a much more common everyday use that's not seen as producing a radio program.\" — Odeo (which became Twitter) Co-Founder Evan Williams, Stanford Lecture, October 2005 (source)\n\n68. Substack\n\nFounded: 2017\n\nValuation: $650 Million (source)\n\nCustomer: Existing newsletter creators and writers.\n\nProblem: Newsletters are the last channel that creators maintain full control of, but they're difficult to monetize outside of advertising/sponsorship.\n\nQuote: \"We had this golden age of blogging, where everyone had blogs, you had this profusion of weird, awesome, wonderful stuff. Big problems; there weren't really great ways to make money from it, but more importantly, now we've just transitioned to mobile, and now you don't go and surf the web. You go on your phone, you've got an array of icons that you go to, and if the content that someone is trying to get to you isn't in one of those icons, you're kinda screwed. If you're an individual content creator, it doesn't really make sense to make an app, that's kinda crazy. If you're trying to compete on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube - you're competing in this playing field by someone else's rules whose interest is not your interest. \" — Chris Best, TWIST Podcast, Jan 2020 (source).\n\n69. Snapchat\n\nFounded: September 2011\n\nValuation: $50 Billion (source)\n\nCustomer: University students.\n\nProblem: Stanford student Reggie Brown didn't want his nudes getting leaked.\n\nQuote: \"Reggie focused on the usefulness of this new idea. A way to send disappearing pictures. He wouldn’t have to worry about sending a hookup a picture of his junk! And girls would be way more likely to send him racy photos if they disappeared. The two friends excitedly discussed all of the celebrities whose nude photos had been leaked to the press. Their app would solve this problem.\" — Techcrunch article 'How Reggie Brown invented Snapchat', February 2018 (source).\n\n71. Warby Parker\n\nFounded: 2010\n\nValuation: $3 Billion (source)\n\nCustomer: Medium and low-budget glasses buyers.\n\nProblem: Glasses are too expensive.\n\nQuote: \"Every idea starts with a problem. Ours was simple: glasses are too expensive. We were students when one of us lost his glasses on a backpacking trip. The cost of replacing them was so high that he spent the first semester of grad school without them, squinting and complaining. (We don’t recommend this.) The rest of us had similar experiences, and we were amazed at how hard it was to find a pair of great frames that didn’t leave our wallets bare. Where were the options? It turns out there was a simple explanation. The eyewear industry is dominated by a single company that has been able to keep prices artificially high while reaping huge profits from consumers who have no other options.\" — Warby Parker Website, 2014 (source).\n\n72. Houzz\n\nFounded: June 2008\n\nValuation: $4 Billion (source)\n\nCustomer: New and renovating homeowners.\n\nProblem: An inability to matching a chosen home style to purchasable products.\n\nQuote: \"The idea for Houzz emerged sometime during the three years when Tatarko and Cohen were struggling to get their four-bedroom ranch house in Palo Alto renovated. Several months went by as they scanned through magazines and books looking for pictures that could match their vision. Once they found a design, they then had to search for the right products and professionals to turn their dream house into a reality. Each and every effort made reaped no results - Google was barely three years old. Facebook did not exist. While it was disappointing and frustrating, they were quick to spot the underlying opportunity.\" — Business Insider Profile, October 2017 (source).\n\n73. Nextdoor\n\nFounded: 2008\n\nValuation: $2.1 Billion (source)\n\nCustomer: US neighborhood groups.\n\nProblem: Neighbors no longer knew or trusted each other.\n\nQuote: \"When I was an undergrad at Stanford, I saw how the Internet could render geography irrelevant. The Internet made it so I was able to connect with people like me, no matter where they lived. It was very simple and you could create your own community. When I got older and got married and bought my house and began to have children, and I started to realize the Internet is so effective in making place irrelevant that in some ways we’ve forgotten the importance of place. When you have a home that is your biggest financial asset and you have kids, those things are not virtual. You have to take kids to school, you have to take them to restaurants, you go to the grocery store. All these things have a reliance on where you live. That’s when this almost lucky coincidence happened where Nextdoor emerged as an idea.\" — Nextdoor Co-Founder Nirav Tolia, Interview with Startups.com May 2021 (source).\n\n74. Superhuman\n\nFounded: 2015\n\nValuation: $260 million (source)\n\nCustomer: \"For those whose email is work and work is email. Our average user spends three hours a day doing email.\"\n\nProblem: Clearing your Gmail inbox can be difficult.\n\nQuote: \"I could see Gmail getting worse every single year, becoming more cluttered, using more memory, consuming more CPU, slowing down your machine and still not working properly offline. So it was time for a change and we imagined an email experience that is blazingly fast where the search is instantaneous, where every interaction is a hundred milliseconds or less, an experience where you never have to touch the mouse, where you could do everything from the keyboard and fly through your inbox. And the experience of course that just worked offline so you could be productive anywhere and an experience that had the best Gmail plugins built-in natively and was yet somehow subtle, minimal and visually gorgeous. And so with that, we built Superhuman.\" — Superhuman Co-Founder Rahul Vohra, July 2020 (source).\n\n75. Udemy\n\nFounded: 2009\n\nValuation: $3.25 Billion (source)\n\nCustomer: Couldn't find this information...\n\nProblem: People around the world lack access to quality education.\n\nQuote: \"I grew up in a small village in the southeast part of Turkey and I was very interested in chess and mathematics from very early ages but there was not really much I could do about it. Learning was not something accessible to you. For me, all of this changed when my parents bought a computer and internet access. All of a sudden I was able to find a lot of math resources. I started teaching myself mathematics on the internet. I have figured out that learning yourself through the internet was actually a good way of learning anything.\" — Eren Bali, November 2018 (source).\n\n77. Basecamp\n\nFounded: 1999\n\nValuation: $100 Billion (source)\n\nCustomer: Design Firms\n\nProblem: As a company grows it's difficult to stay organized.\n\nQuote: \"We focused on a very specific bundle of integrated tools — a message board to post updates, work, and get feedback. To-do lists to keep track of all the work that had to get done. And milestones to keep track of big picture deadlines. This was all the first version of Basecamp did. It’s all we needed and nothing we didn’t. We started using it internally with our clients and they all kept asking “What is this thing? Can we use it to run our own projects?” Once you hear that enough, a lightbulb turns on and you say “Maybe we’ve got something here”. This idea, this thing we made for ourselves, perhaps it’s a product. If we need it, surely hundreds of thousands of businesses just like ours need it too.\" — Basecamp Founder and CEO Jason Fried, October 2015 (source).\n\n78. Roblox\n\nFounded: 2004\n\nValuation: $45.3 Billion (source)\n\nCustomer: Couldn't find this info... sorry!\n\nProblem: An exception to the \"Initial Problem\" rule, Roblox was created based on a technological opportunity identified in a previous startup that Baszucki had founded and sold (not uncommon for gaming).\n\nQuote: \"Seeing how kids lit up when they were creating things using our physics software [in our previous startup called Knowledge Revolution] made me think of what would be the ultimate platform for our imagination. Also I like construction toys and I saw the direction 3-D rendering was going. It became clear to me that there was an opportunity to create an immersive, 3-D, multi-player platform in the cloud where people could imagine, create and share their experiences together.\" — Roblox Co-Founder David Baszucki, June 2016 (source).\n\n79. Peloton\n\nFounded: 2014\n\nValuation: $24.6 Billion (source)\n\nCustomer: Busy parents who want to stay fit and healthy.\n\nProblem: It's difficult for parents to find time to go to the gym.\n\nQuote: \"My wife and I love fitness but like most ageing couples with kids it gets harder to get to the gym. As soon as we had kids our lives got busier and I said, I think I can build a technology platform that will allow you to consume these wonderful fitness classes from the convenience of your home and we could hire the best instructors and it could on your time, your schedule and overtime, at a better value.\" — Peloton Founder John Foley, August 2018 (Source).\n\n80. Quora\n\nFounded: 2009\n\nValuation: $2 Billion (source)\n\nCustomer: People using search engines to answer questions.\n\nProblem: There was nowhere on the internet for really good questions and answers.\n\nQuote: \"When you look at Google, its job is to find you the perfect web page. There are a lot of cases when you want to know something and a list of websites isn’t ideal. For example, If you’re looking for an overview, Wikipedia usually has a good, edited aggregation of content. So one way of solving these cases is to pull all of this information out of people’s heads and get it into a useful format that can be shared.\" — Quora Co-founder Adam D’angelo, Date Unknown (source).\n\n84. Slack\n\nFounded: 2009\n\nValuation: $5.1 Billion (source)\n\nCustomer: They didn’t intentionally set out to create a SaaS product for the workplace. They built a tool for themselves (gaming devs). They only later realized their tool’s commercial potential.\n\nProblem: There was good solution for centralizing internal company communication via messaging.\n\nInternal message during the foundation of Slack: \"We have developed some unique messaging technology with applications outside of the gaming world and a smaller core team will be working to develop new products.\"\n\nQuote: “We begged and cajoled our friends at other companies to try it out and give us feedback. We had maybe six to ten companies to start with that we found this way.” — Slack Co-Founder Stewart Butterfield, date unknown (source).\n\n85. GitHub\n\nFounded: 2008\n\nValuation: $7.5 Billion (source)\n\nCustomer: Software developers.\n\nProblem: It's difficult for software developers to read and understand one another's code when not documented.\n\nQuote: \"Wanstrath resolved that he would not let himself be tied down to unfulfilling projects in his professional life. The chance to work on really great things and interact with smart people on the same level pushed him to make his career into something wholly gratifying. He even dumped his World of Warcraft account to eliminate any chance of distractions. He and GitHub co-founder Tom Preston-Werner came together in 2007 to solve the online collaboration problem as a side project. They had both been developers working on the Ruby on Rails web development community. Their goal at first was to improve Git, a version control system, that allowed for online collaboration, but lacked easy of use.\" — From 'Former UC student establishes a celebrated website in GitHub that simplifies coding collaboration for millions of users,' April 2014 (Source).\n\n86. Google\n\nFounded: 1998\n\nValuation: $1.7 trillion (source)\n\nCustomer: Academics\n\nProblem: There wasn't a good way to determine the importance of web pages.\n\nQuote: \"Initially known as BackRub, Google began as a research project of Larry Page, who enrolled in Stanford’s computer science graduate program in 1995. There, he met fellow CS student Sergey Brin. The two stayed in touch as Page began looking into the behavior of linking on the World Wide Web. Page conceived a system that would crawl the internet to determine which pages were linking to other pages, positing that it could lead to the creation of a new kind of search engine. Together with Brin’s math expertise, the duo created the PageRank algorithm, named after Larry, to rank the search results based on linking behavior.

BlaBlaCar\n\nFounded: 2006\n\nValuation: $2 Billion (source)\n\nCustomer: Travellers who want to share transport.\n\nProblem: There was no way to easily organize carpooling.\n\nQuote: \"If we look at the way we use our cars today, there’s a lot of room for optimization. In France, owning and operating a car costs about 5,500 euros a year, which accounts for gas, tolls, depreciation of the vehicle, repairs, insurance, and other things. But 96 percent of the time our cars just sit there, doing nothing, and when they are driven, three times out of four the driver is the only occupant.\" — BlaBlaCar Co-Founder Frédéric Mazzella, July 2016 (source).\n\n94.

We designed the business model ourselves. Our focus was on helping small and medium-size companies make money. We never copied a model from the U.S., like a lot of Chinese Internet entrepreneurs did. We focused on product quality. It has to be \"click and get it.\" If I can't get it, then it's rubbish\" — Alibaba Co-Founder Jack Ma (source)\n\n96. Unbabel\n\nFounded: August 2013\n\nValuation: Undisclosed\n\nCustomer: B2C companies.\n\nProblem: Machine translation was not accurate enough for business use cases.\n\nQuote: \"Vasco, who has a PhD in language technologies from Carnegie Mellon, was passionate about translation. But it was a conversation with a friend that triggered the idea for the company he now leads – Unbabel. 'My friend had an AirBnb for rent,' Vasco explains. 'He was contacted in English – fine.
