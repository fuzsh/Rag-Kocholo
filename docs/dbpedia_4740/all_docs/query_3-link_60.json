The SaaS industry’s beating heart will probably always be New York, and it will also be the home of SaaStock East Coast on June 4-6.\n\nHowever, we believe in giving the entire coastline a chance to flourish. And for that reason, we are expanding the search for the top SaaS companies to a much larger geography. Bringing them together, we will help them and learn from them in equal measure.\n\nAs we looked into where the strongest SaaS companies are, some obvious and some not so obvious pockets surfaced. Boston, Atlanta, and Toronto were no surprises. However, Charlotte NC, Reston, VA and Fredericton, NB were unexpected discoveries. As we built our list, there were some big names we couldn’t omit. However, we made sure we put some previously hidden treasures in there as well.\n\nWe start the list by featuring some of our favorite SaaS companies from New York, which we had missed in our New York-based list last year. All in all, we looked into 15 different states, spanning both the US and Canada to bring you 47 companies that really excite us and we cannot wait to meet them in June.
