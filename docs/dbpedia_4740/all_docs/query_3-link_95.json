        "text": "When did you realise you had product-market fit?\n\nWe made sure to work with customers from an early stage—as a VC-backed company, we needed our products to be commercially applicable and to fit into users’ workflows. We were lucky in that our first partners—companies such as Ageas in the UK, and Covéa in France—were open to the possibilities our solutions provided, and were happy to collaborate with us to work on how best we could apply AI to improve their processes for them, and their customers.\n\nOne real light bulb moment was when we deployed our AI Estimating product live for the first time, so it was helping real customers in the UK accelerate their claims at the first notice of loss (i.e. on the initial phone call). Seeing our tech being used live, ‘in the wild’, really brought home that we had created something that would help people across the world.\n\nWhat has been your approach to growth so far?\n\nWe’ve always made sure to build our solutions alongside a client, rather than in a research silo, and this has meant that we’ve had commercial fit from early on in the lifespan of the company. This approach hasn’t changed—indeed, it’s even more important to keep consistent as we begin to expand into new areas.\n\nToday, we’re working with a major Japanese insurer to apply our AI to understanding property damage, with the goal of helping people recover faster in 2021 from typhoons. Similarly, we’re working now with LKQ, one of the world’s leading car parts recycling companies, to use our technology to understand how to reclaim parts from salvaged cars more quickly and accurately.\n\nHow do you think the artificial intelligence industry has changed since you first started out?\n\nOne difference is that there is greater global awareness that AI is at a point where it can actually have an impact on people’s lives. Still, there’s the threat of an ‘AI winter’—when investment dries up, because progress is too slow—and companies like ours must ensure that our work has a clear commercial application and returns. We are excited to see more and more AI company founders focusing on solving problems in the real world, actual pain points, rather than building cool theoretical tech, as used to be a few years ago.\n\nWhy do you think Tractable has been so successful—what did you do differently that allowed you to succeed where others failed?\n\nWe’ve always had a laser focus on commercial success, making sure to target the biggest possible companies in our target markets and, once we signed those partnerships, to do everything we could to make them a success.\n\nAn important factor also has been international development—our solutions are used by over 20 of the world’s top insurers, in 12 countries. That gave our business resilience—when things weren’t going quickly in country X, we could still achieve growth in country Y, which meant we could overcome any speed bumps that might have derailed companies with a focus on a single market. That’s been particularly useful during the current COVID crisis—as when Europe was heavily affected by the pandemic, East Asia was relatively unaffected, and we were able to concentrate on growth there.\n\nWhat have been some of the biggest opportunities and challenges of COVID-19 for the company?\n\nWe moved to a WFH pattern of work before it was mandated by the UK Government, although we plan to return in September as soon as people are fully vaccinated. Before that decision, I wouldn’t have believed it was possible to continue developing a complex AI solution remotely, but how the team has risen to the challenge has been remarkable, and I’m extremely proud of what we’ve been able to achieve.\n\nOne benefit of our solution is that it facilitates remote assessment of auto damage. We obviously didn’t design it with COVID in mind, but because they reduce the number of touchpoints along the claims journey, insurers have been increasingly interested in applying them at the present time.\n\nWhen did you realise you had product-market fit?\n\nI always knew we had product relevance, but the proof point came in May 2017, when we launched our app. We were out of beta by October and receiving glowing reviews. Our small business account was launched in March 2018. We’ve now opened 2.4m accounts and are at the top of Which?’s rankings for bank customer service—one of only two banks that is a Which? recommended provider. We’ve also won the Best British Bank accolade at the British Bank Awards four years on the trot.\n\nWhat has been your approach to growth? And how has this changed with every new round of funding secured?\n\nStarling has been focused on its path to profitability from day one. We became monthly profitable in October 2020, and have recorded a profit every month since then. Of course, in the very early days, fundraising is needed to keep the lights on. But as you mature as a company and become less of a risk to investors, you can secure greater sums and begin to scale up and deliver on your business plan.\n\nSo more recent rounds of funding have allowed us to evolve the product, hire new colleagues and build our brand. But the focus on steady and responsible growth hasn’t gone away. Our most recent funding round is supporting a targeted expansion of Starling’s lending in the UK, as well as to launch Starling in Europe and for anticipated M&A.\n\nHow do you think the fintech industry has changed since you first started out?\n\nThere’s more focus from regulators and investors on profitability and responsible governance. The sector has moved on from growth at any cost, and we’ve seen the emergence of a handful of companies that have achieved success at scale. Fintech was very much about failing fast and growing quickly a decade ago, and while that might still be true for some startups, there’s a focus on the culture and mission of financial services brands, now more than ever.\n\nThat goes for consumers too. They want to know the bank they’re choosing is both responsible and ethical. It’s one reason we’ve recently begun making our bank cards from recycled materials and campaigning for better representation of women when it comes to money in the media.\n\nWhat do you see as emerging trends in the sector?\n\nThe big shift has been toward products and services that are relevant and useful, and away from those that are not driven by need. That’s what’s really going to differentiate companies now. Furthermore, the companies that produce the very best technology can not only use this to service their customers, but offer that technology to other companies across the globe, by white-labelling their offering. No doubt automation will continue to bring with it cost-savings and new technological opportunities, but for Starling, we still believe a human at the heart of the service is key.\n\nWhy do you think Starling has been so successful—what did you do differently that allowed you to succeed where others failed?\n\nWe’re known for our execution ability; this is what really makes us stand out. We embraced technology and delivered a truly smart bank, but with humans at the core—in our call centres, interacting by email, webchat, phone or app. It’s been about serving customers in the ways they prefer. We’ve married this with a culture of transparency and plain-speaking. You won’t hear jargon from our colleagues, be it during an in-app conversation or a digital billboard ad.\n\nWhat have been some of the biggest opportunities and challenges of COVID-19 for Starling?\n\nWe’ve supported tens of thousands of small businesses through government-backed lending schemes. That was both an opportunity and a challenge—to ensure those businesses were supported before, during, and after accessing funds. It’s been interesting to note that some companies which accessed capital actually found business busier than ever during the crisis, and so instead used funds to invest and grow, rather than simply survive.\n\nWith the pandemic boosting uptake of digital banking, it puts us in the drivers’ seat to take a greater share of the market. This will, as ever, be fueled by building more products that are relevant and useful to the changing needs of businesses and consumers.\n\nWhen did you realise you had product-market fit?\n\nIf you look at the SME lending market today, a pattern emerges. For loans of several hundred thousand dollars or less, big banks and platforms such as: Ant Financial, Kabbage, Funding Circle, Lending Club, etc. offer several debt options, including general-purpose business loans, asset finance, and invoice finance, typically based on automated credit models which allow lenders to process loans quickly and efficiently. When it comes to loans of $70m or more, banks can justify allocating significant amounts of time and resources to underwriting because the potential returns are greater.\n\nBut loans that fall outside these parameters are either too large to be subject to the automated credit process (from a risk perspective) or too small to be underwritten in the way that big banks do with large loans (because the potential returns don’t make it commercially viable). As a result, this segment of the market has been overlooked and underserved for decades.\n\nWhat was your approach to securing initial investment? And what do you look for in an investor?\n\nRishi and Joel had a very successful exit from their first business, so that helped attract investors for their second. We look for investors who share our long-term vision, believe in the mission, can help us get there, and are willing to back our founders and management team. Rishi and Joel believe you should run your business like you’ll be running it forever, so building a sustainable, profitable business for the long-term has always been very important to them.\n\nDo you think there are enough resources to support high-growth companies these days?\n\nThe UK is one of the best places to start a business, but we languish in comparison when it comes to supporting scaleups. This was a key highlight in Ron Kalifa’s Fintech Review, published earlier this year, which said there needed to be greater emphasis on making the UK a great place to scale a tech business. If we support scaleups, we can close the productivity gap, the housing gap, generate more GDP for the economy, and ensure that the country’s fastest growing, and most successful businesses are being supported.\n\nWhat do you see as emerging trends in the fintech sector?\n\nI think we’ll see a lot more focus on building sustainable, profitable business models. I believe the fintechs that develop solutions that help improve the effectiveness and efficiency of existing institutions—i.e. making incumbent banks their customers, rather than their competitors.\n\nWhy has OakNorth been so successful—what did you do differently that allowed you to succeed where others failed?\n\nI think it comes down to a number of things:\n\nA clear mission and vision on how to achieve it\n\nStrong product-market fit\n\nA unique understanding of our customers and their pain points\n\nIncredibly high talent density within our team\n\nLoyal customers and committed investors\n\nA forward-thinking and innovation-friendly regulator\n\nWe have only just started. The first five years of OakNorth’s journey have seen it secure one of the first new UK banking licences in 150 years, lend over £5.5b to the Missing Middle in the UK since inception, achieve performance metrics which rank it in the top 1% of banks in the developed world, and bring the benefits of the ON Credit Intelligence Suite to other commercial banks. If this is ‘Season One’ of the OakNorth story, the title would be ‘Build’. Season Two has now started."
