We just signed this project with the government and we are commencing works in September this year.\"\n\nRodrigues also said that the company was seeking other investment avenues in the energy and mining sectors. He added that there were more expansion plans in the Africa lined up for later this year.\n\nThe company, which reported a 22 per cent increase in first-quarter net income, had said in March that it planned to enter new markets in Africa, including Zambia, Ghana, Uganda and Kenya. The firm said that it was seeking a total of US$5bn of contracts in Africa.\n\nMota-Engil corporate affairs consultant Wynegood Malunga said that the company believed that Africa, which has been a hub to fast-growing economies in the world, will be its priority for future investments."
