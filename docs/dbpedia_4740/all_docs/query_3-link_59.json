A good number started from dorm rooms and their bedrooms with just a laptop – so stop dreaming and start achieving!\n\nWhen I started my first internet business, I was still at school and was only 15 years old. I would work from anywhere possible to realise my dream of becoming a young millionaire. I would work from school, my bedroom, internet cafes, and even at friends’ houses.\n\nIn 2024, we are not limited by location or investment; we are only limited by our dreams, ambitions, and time.\n\nWhere 14 Famous Companies Got Started\n\n1) Where Facebook Was Started\n\nWho founded Facebook: Mark Zuckerberg\n\nPlace where Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook: In his Harvard Dorm Room\n\nIn 2004, Mark Zuckerberg and his college roommates founded Facebook while studying at Harvard University.

Despite their success, Larry and Sergey remain humble and committed to their original mission of making the world a better place through technology.\n\nInitially, Larry Page and Sergey Brin named their search engine “BackRub,” but later on, they decided to change its name. After brainstorming, they came up with the name “Google,” which was a play on the word “googol.” Googol is a mathematical term that represents the number one followed by 100 zeros.
