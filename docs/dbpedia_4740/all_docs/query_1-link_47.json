        "text": "Mota-Engil ATIV is the new brand of the Mota-Engil Group that leverages the recognised knowledge and experience of Manvia and Vibeiras, promoting synergies and complementarity in the portfolio of services.\n\nWith a more comprehensive action and greater added value, our asset management and maintenance services integrate solutions that optimise the operational performance and cost optimisation of our customers’ assets, at the different stages of their life cycle, as well as their energy, water and carbon efficiency.\n\nOur company values its customers and employees. They are our raison d’être, where everything begins and ends.\n\nTherefore, we seek to ensure that our strategy always meets the interests of our customers, and to this end, we use innovation, efficiency and sustainability as the foundations of our business.\n\nProfessional asset management, based on high standards of training for our team and the use of latest technologies, are vital factors for the success of our company.\n\nWe live in a world of constant change and those who do not understand this will not evolve. Today’s corporate interests are entirely different to those of the past. Thus, we want our activity to promote operational, energy, water and carbon sustainability for our customers, by delivering constantly updated solutions that are decisive to achieve these goals.\n\nWe will strive for Mota-Engil ATIV to become more than just the sum of its two predecessors, Manvia and Vibeiras.\n\nVibeiras, founded in 1989, specialises in the design, management, construction and maintenance of outdoor spaces. With recognised creation of value in the landscape industry: parks and gardens, infrastructures, forestry and sports grounds.\n\nManvia, with over 23 years of activity, is a benchmark company in maintenance management and provision of specialised technical services, particularly in buildings, industry and water infrastructures.\n\nWorking together under a single brand, we have a more diversified, specialised and qualified team. We offer even more and better solutions for the management and maintenance of our customers’ physical assets, at the different stages of their life cycle. With a renewed capacity to promote the optimisation of costs and the operational performance of assets, as well as their energy, water and carbon efficiency. Together we are stronger."
