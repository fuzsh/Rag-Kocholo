        "text": "Picture this. Gartner forecasts worldwide end-user spending for public cloud usage to ramp up to nearly $600 billion in 2023 — from $491 billion in 2022. Out of that spend, SaaS will make up a chunky $200 billion. For comparison, Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) will make up $150 billion and $139 billion, respectively.\n\nElsewhere, a 2023 Productivity survey found that the average company uses about 315 SaaS applications. This is an increase from 254 SaaS tools in 2021. So, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is a very popular way to consume technology — by end users and businesses alike.\n\nNow let’s rewind a little. How does a SaaS application work? And what does a SaaS company do? We’ll also cover:\n\nWhat Is A SaaS Company?\n\nA Software-as-a-Service provider develops, hosts, and maintains a software product and makes it available to others over the Internet. Generally, SaaS users don’t purchase the service outright. Instead, they pay a monthly or annual fee known as a subscription.\n\nThis minimizes the need for the user to build software programs from scratch, and then have to develop, host, upgrade, and update them with their own IT talent and infrastructure.\n\nAs a SaaS company customer, you don’t need to install or download the application. Instead, you can access it through a web or mobile browser.\n\nAs the SaaS provider, the company then manages and updates that software based on customers’ needs, security risks, and technology advancements.\n\nWhat is the difference between a B2B SaaS and B2C SaaS company?\n\nA business-to-business (B2B) SaaS refers to an application that is offered to other businesses as a service while a business-to-customer (B2C) SaaS refers to a tool that is offered to end users.\n\nShopify, for instance, provides an e-commerce platform and supporting tools for small and medium businesses to launch and grow their online stores. On the flip side, Netflix is a streaming service that delivers entertainment directly to consumers’ homes.\n\nBest Of The Best SaaS Companies: What Are The Top 10 SaaS Businesses In 2023?\n\nGoogle. Uber. Netflix. Some of the best SaaS providers are household names. Others will surprise you. We’ve also organized this list into categories to represent different industries, from finance to software delivery to ecommerce.\n\nTo start us off, here are the top SaaS companies currently leading the pack.\n\n1.
