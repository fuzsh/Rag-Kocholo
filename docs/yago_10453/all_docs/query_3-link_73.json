Williams August 2011.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis large 13th to 15th century church has a tall shingled spire, which is a conspicuous landmark, now over shadowed by the over scale chimney of Kingsnorth Power Station. The church contains a good selection of brasses from the 15th to the 17th centuries, that of Richard Bayley, one of the finest in England.\n\nThe churchyard contains a good variety of headstones and one very large pedestal tomb, designed to demand attention! ( Everist Family).\n\nThere is a modern extension to the north, which I have included but have only transcribed pre-1930 graves. There are also some very modern burials at the east end of the churchyard, and some cremation interments on the south side of the church; I have excluded these.\n\nSection A is a small area north of the church between the porch and the east end of the chancel.\n\nSection B is all that area east of the church and south of the east – west footpath.\n\nSection C is the area south of the church.\n\nSection D is the area west of the church, bounded on the west by the footpath which leads to the\n\nsouth west corner.Section E is west of the above footpath, bounded by the north and west boundaries of the churchyard.\n\nSection F is a modern extension, (1920's), north of the east – west footpath, and east of the library building.\n\nSection G interior of Church\n\nWar Memorial\n\nIndex of Names - from gravestones only\n\nLocate the name you are interested in and note the numbers following.

Newnham, of Strood, was towed to Greenhithe last Saturday by a Conservancy boat. In the cabin of the wreck were found the dead bodies of David James Webb, aged 28 years, captain; and Alfred Joseph Groves, aged 24, mate. The men belonged to Hoo, near Rochester, and were employed by James Little, of Strood Hill.\n\nMr H.B. Sewell, corner for West Kent, held the inquest at Greenhithe on Monday afternoon, when James Webb, of Bell's lane, Rochester, bargeman, stated that he was the father of the deceased man Webb, and last saw him alive about three weeks ago. On Feb. 16th witness passed the sunken barge, which was lying in Sea Reach, and on making inquiries found that it went down on the previous Friday, when the night was very boisterous. There were two other barges sunk that night on the Thames. He was of the opinion that the men were sleeping in the cabin when the barge foundered. It was a dangerous proceeding for both to have \"turned in\" on such a night.\n\nJoseph Robert Groves, of Pottery Cottages, Hoo, said Grove was his son. The Newnham was the first barge he had ever been on.\n\nJohn Spicer, 68, James street, Maidstone, bargeman, employed on the Alice, of Maidstone, stated that the barge Newnham was brought up at anchor a little ahead of him on Friday afternoon, February 12th. The vessel was anchored on account of the rough weather. He saw that it was all right at 11 o'clock the same night. When he looked out an hour later, the barge was gone. At daybreak on Saturday, he noticed that the barge was under water, only one end being visible. He afterwards saw the barge boat drifting towards him, bottom upwards. Witness could not have rendered any assistance to the barge.\n\nJames Little, of Strood Hill, owner of the ill- fated barge, gave evidence to the effect that the craft was well founded. It was raised by the Thames Conservancy and brought to Greenhithe.\n\nP.C. Wiseman deposed to finding the bodies in the cabin. The men had evidently been drowned in their sleep. Their arms were folded , and there were no signs of a struggle.\n\nThe jury returned a verdict of \"Accidental death through drowning, consequent on a heavy gale\"\n\n54.
