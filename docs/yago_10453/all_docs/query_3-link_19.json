        "text": "Week 1 of the 2024 NFL preseason kicks off tonight as the Carolina Panthers face the New England Patriots. Patriots fans are expected to see both quarterbacks Jacoby Brissett and Drake Maye take the field tonight as Patriots head coach Jerod Mayo has yet to choose the team's starting quarterback for the 2024-5 NFL season.\n\nKeep reading to find out how and when to watch the Carolina Panthers vs. New England Patriots game tonight, even if you don't have cable.\n\nHow and when to watch the Carolina Panthers vs. New England Patriots preseason game\n\nThe Carolina Panthers vs. New England Patriots NFL preseason game will be played on Thursday, August 8, 2024, at 7 p.m. ET (4 p.m. PT). The NFL preseason game will air on NFL Network and stream on Sling TV and the platforms featured below.\n\nHow and when to watch the Carolina Panthers vs. New England Patriots preseason game without cable\n\nWhile many cable packages include NFL Network, it's easy to watch the game if NFL Network isn't included in your cable TV subscription, or if you don't have cable at all. Your best options for watching are below. (Streaming options will require an internet provider.)\n\nSling TV is the most cost-effective way to stream the Carolina Panthers vs. New England Patriots game\n\nIf you don't have cable TV that includes NFL Network, one of the most cost-effective ways to watch tonight's game, and all the major sporting events happening this fall, is through a subscription to Sling TV. To watch the NFL Network on Sling TV, you'll need a subscription to the Orange tier or the Blue tier. We suggest leveling up your coverage to get more NFL games this fall with the Orange + Blue tier.\n\nThat Orange + Blue plan normally costs $60 per month, but the streamer currently offers a half-off promotion for your first month, so you'll pay just $30. For the least expensive Olympic-watching option, the Blue plan includes the channels NBC, USA and E!, starting at $45 per month ($22.50 for your first month).\n\nThe streamer is also currently offering big savings on four months of the Orange + Blue tier plus the Sports Extra plan when you prepay for the Sling TV Season Pass. The Sports Extra plan includes Golf Channel and Big Ten Network, among others. Prepay for four months of the Sling TV Season Pass and spend $219, reduced from $300.\n\nBecause Sling TV does not carry CBS, Sling subscribers will want to add Paramount+ to their bundle.\n\nNote: Paramount+ and CBS Essentials are both subsidiaries of Paramount Global.\n\nTop features of Sling TV Orange + Blue plan:\n\nSling TV is our top choice for streaming major sporting events like NASCAR.\n\nThere are 46 channels to watch in total, including local NBC, Fox and ABC affiliates (where available).\n\nYou get access to most local NFL games and nationally broadcast games at the lowest price.\n\nAll subscription tiers include 50 hours of cloud-based DVR storage.\n\nYou can add Golf Channel, NBA TV, NHL Network, NFL RedZone, MLB Network, Tennis Channel and more sports-oriented channels (19 in total) via Sling TV's Sports Extras add-on.\n\nWatch the Panthers vs. Patriots game free with FuboTV\n\nYou can watch every NFL game airing on network TV, including tonight's game, on FuboTV. FuboTV is a sports-centric streaming service that offers access to almost every NFL game of the season. Packages include CBS, Fox Sunday NFC games via \"NFL on Fox,\" NBC (\"Sunday Night Football\"), ESPN (\"Monday Night Football\"), NFL Network and more, so you'll be able to watch more than just today's games, all without a cable subscription.\n\nTo watch the NFL without cable, start a seven-day free trial of Fubo. You can begin watching immediately on your TV, phone, tablet or computer. In addition to NFL football, FuboTV offers MLB, NBA, NHL, MLS and international soccer games.\n\nTop features of FuboTV Pro Tier:\n\nThere are no contracts with FuboTV -- you can cancel at any time.\n\nThe Pro tier includes over 180 channels, including NFL Network. (You'll need to upgrade to Ultimate for NFL RedZone.)\n\nFuboTV includes all the channels you'll need to watch college and pro football, including CBS (not available through Sling TV).\n\nAll tiers come with 1,000 hours of cloud-based DVR recording.\n\nStream on your TV, phone, tablet and other devices.\n\nWatch the Panthers vs. Patriots game on Hulu + Live TV\n\nYou can watch the NFL, including the NFL Network, with Hulu + Live TV. The bundle features access to 90 channels, including both Fox and FS1. Unlimited DVR storage is also included. Watch every game on every network with Hulu + Live TV, plus catch live NFL preseason games, exclusive live regular season games, popular studio shows (including NFL Total Access and the Emmy-nominated show Good Morning Football) and lots more.\n\nHulu + Live TV comes bundled with ESPN+ and Disney+ for $77 per month after a three-day free trial.\n\nWatch the Panthers vs. Patriots game live on your phone with NFL+\n\nIf you want to catch tonight's game live on your phone, check out NFL+. The premium streaming service, starting at $40 per year (or $7 per month), offers access to NFL Network. And yes, that includes games being broadcast out-of-market. To boost your NFL experience even further, you can upgrade to NFL+ Premium with NFL RedZone and watch up to eight NFL games simultaneously.\n\nTop features of NFL+:\n\nYou get access to NFL preseason games that are out of market.\n\nNFL+ lets you watch stream local and primetime regular season games on your phone or tablet, but not your TV.\n\nIncludes the NFL Network (and NFL RedZone with NFL+ Premium), so it's a good option for those who are looking to stream football on the go.\n\nWaiting for the game to start?
