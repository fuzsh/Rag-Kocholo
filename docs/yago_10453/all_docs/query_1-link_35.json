        "text": "Central Electric is a cooperative, owned by the people we serve. They are more than customers. Here at Central, we call them \"members\" or \"member-owners.\"\n\nOne way ownership is reflected is through capital credits. These are members' share of what's left over after we have paid the costs of delivering power, and set aside appropriate funds for emergency situations and regular growth projects. When we are financially able to do so, these capital credits are distributed to members. That means the member-owners financially share in the successful operation of the cooperative. Capital credits are one of the tangible benefits of being served by a co-op.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2023, Central Electric has retired more than $17 million in capital credits for the service years of 1982 through 2006. In 2023, the co-op gave back back $1.1 million and members who received service from the cooperative between 2003 and 2006 received a capital credit retirement check. Retirement amounts greater than $25 were issued a check, while all others were applied as a bill credit.\n\nUnclaimed Capital Credits\n\nDue to different factors, we may not have up-to-date contact information for members, past and present. You may have unclaimed capital credits waiting for you. Enter your name or other info to search our databases. If your name is listed, click it to open the claim form."
