Cobeil\n\nThrough out junior high and high school I wore the bracelet of the Earl Cobeil, then listed as an MIA (blue start still in place) . As the daughter of an Vietnam vet, also a pilot in the USAF, and my brother's Godfather a POW in Hanoi (also a 105 pilot I believe ) from 1965 - final release...I scoured the returnee and casualty lists for about a year after the general release and never saw his name.\n\nFor some reason of late I have pulled his bracelet out of my jewelry box several times and mentioned to my husband how much I would have liked to send it to him on his return, and wondered what ever became of him. The other day my husband found this website and I finally learned the outcome of Earl Cobeil. The news saddened me but in another way provided some closure to that part of my life... I know nothing of how it must have been for his family but wanted you to know that someone else was thinking of him and his family for all these years.\n\nIf you would like to have his bracelet, then stamped as \"Capt. Earl G. Cobeil\", I would be happy to send it to you . If you would prefer, I could send it to one of the historical collections or just keep it until I am able to visit \"The Wall\", in the future.\n\nYou may E-Mail me with your preference @ Redbearmom @ AOL.com or write me\n\nat the following address.\n\nSincerely,\n\nLeslie Austin\n\n924 Market Street\n\nBaird, Texas 79504\n\nFrom - Sat Oct 03 20:58:53 1998\n\nFrom: JANGREENIE@aol.com\n\nSubject: SGT KENNETH LANCASTER\n\nI have a bracelet that I wore for many years. I never did hear and never have found out the statis of the man whose name is on my braclet. You see I have always had a close attatchment to this man because I am a surviving widow to that terrible time in history . My husband lost his life in January at a very young age of 21 leaving behind myself and two beautiful young children a son and a daughter. His name was SGT VICTOR EDWARD ANDERSON.\n\nMy son told me about this web site. I decided that I would try to find out something on SGT KENNETH LANCASTER missing 1-03-68. I would like to know if he was ever found alive or otherwise. If he has a family. If his children had to go thru their lives with the emptiness my children always had to face not ever knowing their father. My son was 3 and my daughter was 1 when they last saw him. This has always tore at my heart to know the emptiness they have felt. Time can heal but all the time in the world mever removes the scars - they may fade but they are always visable. anyway I would like any information that anyone may have and thank you.\n\nFrom - Sun Oct 04 00:02:13 1998\n\nI want to thank you for the information you have sent to me and for the fast response. I sit here reading your letter and contemplating my feelings as the tears stream down my face. This man met what ever fate he faced the same month as my husband 2 years later. I gues I have had and worn his bracelet longer than I was married to my husband. Somehow it feels as tho I to was married to him in some strange way. At the age of 20 and being left with 2 small children to raise was a very frightening thing. Now 32 years later I some how feel a little bit frightened at finding out what happened to a man I have felt so strongly attached to for so long. I used to try to put a face to the name the face of a very young man. Now I find this very young man was only 5 years younger than myself and I see a much older face with much suffering and pain.\n\nI pray for his family his wife and children if he had any as well as his parents and brothers or sisters. My heart aches for their unknowing. I have thanked God so very many times for the fact the my husband's body was returned to us intact that we were able to view him and know beyond doubt he was really in the casket that was returned to us.\n\nWar is such a terrible thing and it touches so many lives and leaves so many hurts and pain. As I said before, time does help. The the scars never leave us and the wounds can open unexspectedly. I would love to hear from any of Kenneths family if they choose to contact me, but in the same sense I can definately respect their privacy. Again, thank you for your information even if it was not the word I had so hoped to hear. God bless you people for all your compasion and love and prayers.\n\nJanet Anderson Yamamoto\n\nClintom,Utah 84015\n\nJanGreenie@aol.com\n\nFrom - Fri Oct 09 13:52:09 1998\n\nFrom: \"Black, Mary (SE_ENG)\" <blackm@valeo.sylvania.com>\n\nSubject: JAMES ROZO\n\nTo the family of Sgt. JAMES MILAN ROZO, USA.\n\nI really don't even know what to say except for if you are out there, I have held Sgt. Rozo's POW/MIA bracelet for years and have been proud to do so. I purchased it when I was in junior high school thinking that the name \"Rozo\" was unusual and if I would ever see it again, I would certainly recognize it. Many years later I was shocked to see that he was listed as one of LIFE magazine's 25 MIA's. I still have the magazine that I keep with his bracelet that I wore until it broke in two.\n\nIf you are out there, I don't wish to intrude. I would simply like to know if you do know his whereabouts or what has happened to him. If you would like to have his bracelet, I would be more than happy to send it to you. I am sure that it is little consolation but I have never forgotten him and I would love to know if you have any information about him. If you wish, you can contact me via e-mail. Thank you.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMary C.

I received a stainless steel band with the name of Owen Skinner 12-12-70. I was concerned for his family--did he have a wife? children? and was saddened to note that he was lost just before Christmas.\n\nI wore the band for many years, until it broke. (I have a terribly thin wrist, which required a lot of bending in order to stay on.) Since then, the bracelet has followed me to various cities throughout the U.S. and now, in Montreal Quebec, where the two pieces reside on my bookshelf.\n\nAlthough I had stopped wearing the bracelet long ago, I continued to wonder about, and hope for the best for Owen Skinner. Last year, I found the web pages which list the status of MIA/POWs and was sorry to learn that Owen Skinner has not been found.\n\nNow, when I consider the worn areas on the bracelet, I remember how young and naiive I was in the early 70's....I had several young friends who went to fight, and we were fortunate that they all returned physically unharmed. (Although no one returned unchanged). For me, the significance of the bracelet has increased in time. It reminds me that not everyone made it back, and that each POW/MIA has a name, has a family who loves and misses them. I now check Owen's status report regularly....still concerned, still wondering, still harbouring a bit of hope. It is always an emotional experience for me.\n\nI would like to think there is some consolation for you to know that someone else--albeit a stranger--also cares. I send you warmest wishes.\n\nBarbara Layne\n\nFrom - Sun Oct 18 08:31:15 1998\n\nFrom: \"Steve & Nancy Brann\" <ehands@rt66.com>\n\nSubject: Sp4 Donald M. Shue\n\nFor years I wore another POW/MIA bracelet. Then I read in the newpapers that he had been released. I continued wearing it for a long time even then in the memory of all the others still there.\n\nNow, after all these years I once again am taking up the cause. On August 30, 1998 I felt a great need to write a letter to the men and women who made it back. I put this letter on my web site, and in doing so I have heard from many! Their voices reminded me that there is still so very much to be done! For too many years I was, as so many, still holding the pain of that war deep within me. But, now I know that it cannot be held within. Our voices must be heard. We will yell to the mountain tops every day until we\n\nget results!\n\nPart of my part is in the adoption of Donald Shue as my POW/MIA through Operation Just Cause. I now have his web site up, and though it has only been on-line for a few days, many people have already visited and spoken their words of love and caring. I want you to know this. He is NOT forgotten! Nor will he ever be. Even when we obtain an accounting for him, he will still be in our hearts and our memories. He is a hero, as are they all! They were my heros then, and that fact has never changed!\n\nIf you would care to share more personal information about him with me, or perhaps even a picture, I will put it on the web site to let others better know that he is NOT just another statistic, but a son, a husband, and perhaps even a father. At this point, I only have the details that were provided to me by POWNET and Operation Smoking Gun.\n\nAlso there were two other Americans with him in the same incident. I plan to adopt them as well. As they were captured together, so shall they be remembered together. Their names are SSgt William Brown and SSgt Gunther Wald. Any information or pictures of them would also be greatly appreciated.\n\nI just wanted you to know there are so many of us that do remember, share in your sorrow, and pray for answers to the many questions that have yet to be answered. God bless you, and I hope that you might find a bit of comfort in knowing that they are NOT FORGOTTEN!\n\nIf you want to contact me, please send me e-mail at:\n\nsunshinewoman41@hotmail.com\n\nIf you want to see his web page, go to:\n\nhttp://www.angelfire.com/nm/bootsiesplace/powmia.html\n\nI hope the web page I made for him meets with your approval. I want others to know of your son, your husband, and perhaps your father.\n\nNancy Brann\n\nRoswell, NM\n\nFrom - Tue Oct 27 08:56:35 1998\n\nFrom: glbailey@halifax.com (Gerry L Bailey)\n\nSubject: Delbert R. Peterson\n\nI have worn this bracelet for more than 20 years, longer than I have been married. I would like his family to know that I have always held out hope for his return and will not give up no matter how long it takes. It seems strange to feel a connection to the family of a man I never met and his family, however anyone who was raised in the military will understand the feeling of family you can have with complete strangers. As a teenager, I sold these bracelets as a fund-raiser for what would become the POW/MIA Network. {P.O.W. NETWORK NOTE: NOT this organization} I purchased three at the time and wore them all. One was for Jeremiah Denton, who came home shortly thereafter, one was for Richard Fitts, who finally came home in 1990, and one was for Maj. Peterson. Since he was reported to have survived on the ground, I can still hope. If you recieve any information about him, I would be happy to hear from you. I just wanted you to know that there are people out there who still think about you and your son, and will for as long as it takes to reach a resolution to your satifaction. He is not forgotten.\n\nS.A.

Only recently did I have any other information on him other than what was on the bracelet. I always hoped and prayed that one day I could hand it to him, but I know now that I will never get that chance. I just need to know that You the family knows that I cared and I will never forget him. Although I did not know him, in my heart I knew all I needed to know. If you read this it would mean so much to me for someone to respond. I would return the bracelet to the family, or I will continue to wear it for all the others. It is just up to you. I just had to\n\nlet you know that someone, a stranger that you have never met held you family member so dear to my heart and as long as I live, Chester will live in my heart. please e-mail me a SWa6580283@AOL.com. If you chose not to I will understand.\n\n.....I just wanted you to know that I have worn Chester's bracelet for many years. I have just recently found out the fate of Chester and I just want to say that I am so sorry for your loss and I hope that it helps for you to know that I did not forget about him nor will I forget about all the others that are over there and waiting to come home.

Thanks, Sheena\n\nFrom - Thu Nov 12 19:25:38 1998\n\nSubject: Fwd: Veteran's poem\n\nGang:\n\nI thought I'd pass along the following e-mail because I believe it was written for all of us and many more. My son Brian was driving to work yesterday listening to a local DC radio station when they read a poem about veterans. It touched him sufficiently to write the message to the station, and they acknowledged it. It brings tears to my eyes every time I read it.\n\nGBU\n\nHank\n\n* * * * * * * * * * *\n\nI too wish to thank you for reading that poem this morning. It really touched me, for I know all too well the level of respect our veterans deserve. On December 18, 1972, my father's B-52 was shot down over Hanoi during the Christmas raids (Operation Linebacker II) that Nixon had ordered to bring the Vietnamese back to the peace talks. My father and three other crewmen were taken prisoner. The two others became were added to that always too long \"Missing in Action\" list. He finally came home in March of '73, and I was born 13 months later.\n\nThere has been a great revival of emotions in our family over the past few years. His crashsite has been located, and one of the MIA's found. My dad has also been interviewed by both the Discovery Channel and the History Channel.\n\nLast Memorial Day, I had the honor of going to the reunion held in Dallas celebrating the 25th anniversary of their release. The brotherhood and support shown by all these men who share one common bond was just amazing. Having met men like Paul Galanti, Dick Stratton and Doug Hegdahl, along with some of my father's crew members has permanently enriched my life. And it doesn't stop there. I am now part of a \"sons and daughters of\" mailing list, communicating with some people who I haven't even met, and yet we carry on like good friends.\n\nWhen I feel like life is getting a bit out of control, I look at my father's POW bracelet and think about what he went through, and realize that he was only two years older than I am now when he survived one of the worst ordeals possible. It puts it all into perspective, and I know all my problems aren't that bad.\n\nI wish to say how proud I am of my father, Hank Barrows, and thank you.\n\nBrian Barrows\n\nFrom - Thu Nov 12 19:26:00 1998\n\nFrom: Don & Jane Kay Poore <dpoore@computerland.net>\n\nSubject: Russell Arden Poore\n\nI wear the bracelet of LtC Russell Arden Poore - missing since 4 Feb 67. I have his biography sheet, but wonder if there's more information. For instance, three people survived the shoot down and were prisoners that were eventually released. Wouldn't there be reports about what they know . . . if Russell Poor was still alive at the time\n\nof the crash, did they parachute, if so how many parachutes were seen, etc. Also of the six men involved in the shoot down, three came home alive, and two bodies have been returned, one in 1977 and the other in 1990. Finding out why there was so much time lag would be impossible, I'm sure. What did the three that were released (Jack Bomar, John Davies and John Fer) know about Russell Poor in captivity? Did they see him, hear of him, etc. Obviously, I think it's known what happened to Russell Poor. But, I can't seem to be able to find anything. Can you help me?\n\nAlso, what about his family. Are his parents still alive, or did they die not knowing what happened to their son? My \"little\" brother was in VietNam, so I know the anguish a family goes through. I can not imagine not knowing and my heart goes out to this family. Did he have a wife, children, pets? Is there anyway to put a human face to this bracelet? Does the family know that someone wears his name and cares very much.\n\nThey're in my prayers each night, so it's be easier if I knew a few facts. I don't know if that's allowed for bracelet wearers. People ask about my bracelet and therefore him. Most people are genuinely concerned, but for those that it's just have a passing curiosity, I carry a card with the information about Russell Poor that I give to them\n\nhoping to peak their interest in our MIA's.\n\nThanks for your time!\n\nDon & Jane Poore\n\nColumbia, Mo\n\nFrom - Thu Nov 12 23:20:22 1998\n\nFrom: \"Michele Hoffman\" <towerbel@lodinet.com>\n\nSubject: Rick Medaris\n\nRe: Rick E. Medaris\n\nDate of Loss 11/4/69\n\nTo the Family of Rick E. Medaris,\n\nIn 1970 I sent away for a braclet of a POW/MIA and recieved one with Rick's name on it.\n\nI proudly wore that braclet for many years. I always wondered about Rick and the outcome of his fate.\n\nIn Sept. of 1997 I took a trip to Washington DC, and had to see the \"Wall\". It was raining that day and as I looked over the many names, I wondered if Rick's name was there. I was unaware that I could have found it by the use of an index in the area.\n\nI left the area still wondering about him.\n\nIt wasn't until I heard on the radio today that I could find this site and and gain some information.\n\nSadly tonight I finally learned of his death in a helicopter accident.\n\nOver the years I have explained to my children and now, grandchildren, what the braclet represents. It has been a tangible tool in teaching them all about war and the real people who don't always come home.\n\nIf Rick's family wants this braclet I would gladly give it to them. If not, it will be kept safe for many years to come with my daughter's family. She is a family historian and cherishes the importance of memorabilia.\n\nAfter 29 years of not knowing what happened to Rick, I finally feel some piece of mind, while at the same time a great deal of sadness.\n\nHe lives on in my memory and also will in the memory of my family.\n\nSincerely,\n\nMichele Hoffman\n\ntowerbel@lodinet.com\n\nFrom - Fri Nov 27 08:18:16 1998\n\nFrom: LHSXCNTRY@aol.com\n\nSubject: Stephen W. Harris, SSG, USAF\n\nI was in the Air Force from Mar 73 to Dec 76, and after being out for a short period enlisted in the Missouri National Guard and am a currently serving SSG. Shortly after I enlisted in the Guard, a good friend and fellow Guard member introduced me to a group of Veterans who helped me get an MIA braclet of a USAF NCO from Missouri who was listed as MIA. The name on the braclet was Stephen W. Harris from Springfield MO and I wore that braclet for years. I often stopped and said a prayer that one day this fellow warrior would return to his family one way or the other and today I have learned that his remains were returned in 1995.\n\nI don't know if any of the family of this brave man will ever read this message, but in the off chance that someone knowing them does, please relay to them that I mourn the loss of their loved one with them and that I kept the faith. I wish I could return the braclet to the family, but it broke on a training mission some years ago and the pieces were lost. Even though the braclet was gone, I never gave up hope, and I would like to thank POWNET for putting this page together.\n\nI will continue to prayer for Stephen, and for his family. My hope is that God in his wisdom and mercy has enabled the family to carry on.\n\nSleep well Stephen, and thank you,\n\nJeffrey M.

Richard Fitts\n\nDecember 29, 1998\n\nTo the family of S/SGT. Richard A. Fitts:\n\nIt was with great sadness that just today I have learned of the death of your loved one, Richard Fitts. I have owned the original POW/MIA bracelet with his name engraved on it since 1973 -- when I was 12 years old. For many years as a teenager, I wore the bracelet. And as a devout young Catholic and an altar boy, I aways included Sergeant Fitts in my prayers at Mass. The bracelet had very special meaning to me, not only because of memory of an honorable soldier, but also because my own father is a surviving veteran of the Vietnam War (1968-69). My brother and sister and I grew up with tremendous respect for those who suffered in that war -- both in Vietnam and back here at home. And our mother -- indeed, our entire family -- has known the pain that many families of Vietnam veterans go through.\n\nAs the years went by and I started high school, I stopped wearing the bracelet, but kept it in a shoebox with other important personal items and souvenirs. It moved with me wherever my father was stationed in the U.S. Coast Guard-- even as far away as Alaska. II often wondered if my POW/MIA had made it home safely and I always hoped he had. The bracelet always made me feel that I was somehow spiritually linked to him.\n\nI only recently rediscovered my bracelet while unpacking boxes in my home office. Having recently bought a home computer and started experimenting with the Internet, I decided to begin researching what happened to the bracelets across the country -- and to see if I could find out anything about Sergeant Fitts.\n\nThis morning, within only a few moments of looking up the POW Network, I had my answer. I am so very disappointed and saddened to discover that his remains were returned nearly 10 years ago. I had hoped --perhaps naively -- to discover that he had returned home safely and had envisioned contacting him and returning his bracelet to him.\n\nMy sympathy and prayers go out to the Fitts family for their loss. I hope it will bring some comfort to know that a young boy -- and now a \"30-something\" man -- never forgot the name of Richard Fitts and that many prayers were said in his honor. And knowing that it has been many years since they put Richard to rest, I will respect th family's grief and will not try to contact them. However, I plan to follow the POW Network's instructions and take the bracelet to a Vietnam memorial -- probably the one\n\nhere in San Antonio, Texas. But just in case the family reads this letter and would like to claim the bracelet, I will hold onto it for a few weeks before leaving it at the memorial.\n\nIf family or friends of Sgt. Fitts see this note, feel free to contact me at kenslavin@msn.com.\n\nWith deepest respect and sympathy,\n\nKenneth R. Slavin\n\nSan Antonio, Texas\n\nDecember 29, 1998\n\nFrom - Mon Jan 25 18:14:17 1999\n\nFrom: PFSSTAR98@aol.com\n\nSubject: Col. Baras\n\nFamily of Col. Barras...\n\nMay I extend my family's most sincere condolence to your family on the news of Col. Barras. Tonight we found out alot about this man we only knew as \"Gregory Barras 12-18-68\" as listed on a bracelet that my wife has had since her highschool days. She wore it until the bracelet litterly wore in two...then placed it in her jewler box. After I met her in 1977, she showed it to me while discussing the Vietnam War one day. I was supprised to see that no other information was on it (except what is listed above). I repaired the bracelet the best I could, but it isn't strong enough to wear. Over the years, she has mentioned the bracelet, wanting to find out more about \"Gregory\". We tried several different addresses and organizations over the years, but with no results. Until now...\n\nSince the ability to get on \"the Web\", I have researched many things. And tonight, 24 Jan 1999, I researched (for the first time) \"Gregory Barras\". I wasn't prepared for the information I found. As my wife said, and I'm sorry to say, I never really thought of \"this name\" as a person, until tonight. As Col. Barras's name appeared on the Bio-list I\n\nhad found, I was overcome with grief. I am a Christian, but the feeling of helplessness came over me... I could barely utter my wife's name to come to my side. And then... when we read that just this past month, Col. Barras was \"returned home\"...we cried. We are so sorry that he was killed over in Laos...and so long ago, but we never forgot his name (sorry we never got to know more about him sooner).\n\nMy wife and I would like to know if, as the family of Col. Gregory Barras, you would want to have this bracelet. I feel it would mean alot to my wife to know his family had it. May I pray that you, Gregory Barras's family, find peace and comfort now that he has been brought home. May God bless you all.\n\nSincerely,\n\nReed & Pam Litch\n\npfsstar98@aol.com\n\nKeri Bowers\n\nemail: Keriduway@webtv.net or keribowers@earthlink.net\n\nFebruary 2, 1999\n\nTo the family of Capt. Robert Kent\n\nI'm not sure how to begin the salutation of a letter such as this, let alone what I might say to you, so I will start with the purpose of my writing.\n\nI have possessed a POW bracelet etched with Capt. Robert Kent's name and the date, 12-20- 68 since 1973. At the time I bought the bracelet, I was a 13 year old girl, utterly ignorant of the significance of and meaning behind the bracelet I wore.\n\nBecause I was so young, I understood little about the Vietnam war. I had no grasp of the ramifications of war, of its horrid reality, or of the very real pain and destruction it caused to so many lives. In truth, my fiiends and I wore the bracelets because at the time it was the fashionable thing to do.\n\nSomehow over the years, despite my own challenges and ever-changing life's circumstances, I have managed to hold the bracelet in safe keeping. It has followed me through a move away from home to college at 16; the upside-down turn of my life when, at 25 my husband of five years died and most of my possessions were sold off and only a few things remained to be put in storage. After that, a very rocky year\n\nwith several moves followed. When I was 26, 1 entered a rehabilitation hospital for drug abuse, and once again my few belongings were moved to yet another storage facility.\n\nBy the time I was 28 and to some degree or another I had settled down, I had my first child, Taylor. Taylor was bom autistic - and I had yet another challenge to face and overcome. With time, strength of conviction, and a deeply spiritual commitment, by the time I turned 30, I had come to find peace in the loss of my husband and for\n\nthe fact that my son was special.\n\nI mention these very personal things, because they have much to do with my growing understanding of the significance of the loss of Robert.\n\nToday, at 38, 1 can appreciate the life of one man - and of many men - who gave their lives in a thankless war. And because of my own history, I can empathize with the pain of a family who lost a loved one. Finally, I know what it is to go on, and in my case to triumph, in honor of the husband I lost and the \"normal\" child I will never have -\n\nall despite those losses.\n\nOver the years, throughout my many moves and ever-changing circumstances, I have had occasion to take out the bracelet and wonder: what happened to Capt. Robert Kent? What of his family?\n\nLast October, my son, then 9 years old, decided he wanted to be a hippy for Halloween. I rummaged through my belongings to find old love beads and other regalia of the era. I once again came upon the bracelet. But this time, my curiosity was more urgent. I wondered how I could contact the family of Capt. Robert Kent. I considered writing to the defense department, but had no idea where to start, and so the idea that came, once again went.\n\nLast weekend, I opened the box containing the bracelet yet again. I decided that the intemet was undoubtedly a resource worth looking into. And so I came upon the P.O.W. Network Biography.\n\nAs I looked through the long list of names, I sat with anticipation of finding the name - Capt. Robert Kent - and there, in alphabetical order, I found it. As I pulled up t'ne page ano read what little information was there about Robert, I was struck with an amazing, chilling feeling. I got goose bumps as the man named Capt. Robert Kent\n\nbecame real. He belonged to somebody, and sadly, he never came home. Most of all, he was no longer just a name on a 13 year old girl's fashionable bracelet.\n\nAnd so I come to this point of writing to you. It says on the Network home page that to return the bracelet would be an insult to the family if their loved one was abandoned again by returning the bracelet now. And so I write to you instead, to say that for me, your loved one has been with me for a long time, and that the meaning of his life has become more personal to me with time, and that my prayers and thoughts\n\nare with you, and forever with Robert.\n\nSincerely,\n\nKeri Bowers\n\nFrom - Mon Feb 22 08:18:18 1999\n\nFrom: knudsen@pacbell.net\n\nSubject: Sgt. Steven M Hastings\n\nTo the Family and Friends of Sgt. Steven M Hastings,\n\nI have, for so many years, had Sgt. Steven Hasting's bracelet. It was given to me by an elderly woman that was nearing death and feared it would be discarded upon her death. She gave it to me. She must have known I would care; that I would keep caring. Although I discussed it as often as appropriate, I could not find the strength to wear it. I was afraid I would lose faith. The bracelet has sat out on my dresser for the past few years.\n\nRecent events, added years, and maturity, have made me more aware, more in touch with my own feelings regarding life and family; the lives of service men/women, my father among them. Perhaps it is my own mortality or witnessing my child grow that gives me this new sense of being. It is with the power of the internet, that I write.\n\nI sorry for Steven's sake that I didn't have the guts to wear it.\n\nI am sorry for my father's sake that I have not been more vocal, more demanding of my government.\n\nI hope you all have had the strength I have lacked.\n\nI pray that your lives have been filled with love and hope.\n\nI pray that others find a new sense of compassion, understanding, and tolerance for the fellow human beings as I have.\n\nI pray that we as a people can hold tight to are faiths (in all things).\n\nI pray nothing I have done or said offends you in any way.\n\nI pray for you all, Gods blessings\n\nRespectfully,\n\nSamuel S.

After I was married I put it away but I never forgot about it or the man whose name is on it Capt. John Baldridge Jr. missing November 20, 1969. I found it when we moved last and I have had it out since trying to track down information about him and his family but to no avail. I found your site and was able to get some information and his status as of today, to say the least I was hoping for him to have been found or his remains to have been returned home it looks like neither has happened. I just would like his family to know that even though I was a kid of 14 this bracelet meant a lot to me and now, a wife, a mother and a woman of 40 it still has a meaning to me and will always have one. It has a meaning every day I\n\nget up because with out these men and women our country would not be free..... I am raising my children to respect and love this country and what the men and women do for it in the armed forces. If Capt. Baldridge's family reads this I would love to hear from them to know a little more about him and his family and what kind of man he was. Thank you for providing this Love Letters section it gives me a chance to express how proud I am of Capt. Baldridge and his family for making the ultimate sacrifice.

My father and I purchased these bracelets when I was a young girl. For years I wore my bracelet and watched for his return.\n\nI am now a Girl Scout leader planning to take a trip to Wash. D.C. with my troop. I have been having discussions with my girls about my bracelet. We decided it was time for me to use the internet to try and find any info. I could. I wasn't sure what I would find but I didn't expect it to be this. I sit at my computer crying for a man I never met\n\nbut one whom my family has prayed for, for years.\n\nI would like his family to know that his memory will live on. I am teaching his name to young Americans so that they will know the tragdy of war. I plan on finding him at the wall, continuing my prayers and teaching a new generation to pray for his return. God Bless you !\n\nIf anyone has any information on Maj. Bruce Johnson I would appreciate it. Any info. to pass on to my Girl Scout troop would be appreciated.

WOODROW WILSON PARKER II\n\nDearest Mr. and Mrs. Parker,\n\nI pray that you find this and I pray that Our God has given your hearts comfort. Our Hero, will always be loved and Never Forgotten. I have had his bracelet since the early 70's. And thru the years I have watched the in coming news for his safe return, but I never could find anything out. The other day my friend went on her computer and located the 1998 (latest report) on Woodie. I am heartbroken. And, I like you don't know what to believe. I do not live far from you and I would very much like to meet you as I feel we have shared the same love for so many years \"Woodie.\" I would love to learn more about his life. I already know that he was so brave and wonderful. Also, would you like his bracelet? I have carried it with me for what seems like a life time. I just needed in my heart to let you know that our Government may have failed him, but there are so many of us out here that are still loving and waiting for word about \"our Hero's\" and we know so little and feel so helpless. Please, contact me by my \"email address\" if you would like to meet me or if you just want me to mail his bracelet to you. I promises to Honor your wishes, no matter what they are. I do not wish to cause you any more pain then you both have already indured. I have prayed for you also. We\n\nlive less than an hour apart. I pray this letter finds you if, that is what God wants. I would love a picture of Woodie. He has been a part of me for almost 30 years. Please remember, he will always be with you. I saw how hard you both, fought for your son and I can feel the Love you have for him and the hurt you've lived with. You will always be in my thoughts and prayers.

Klughers\" <leek@mindspring.com>\n\nSubject: love letters\n\nHi .. I just found your site. I have 2 bracelets. I can't really remember when I got my first one. The name on it is Capt. John Hill 4-27-70. My second bracelet I got around 8 years ago. We were at a county fair and there was a POW MIA booth and I was so proud.. yet sad...to show them my bracelet. Yes it was on my wrist. That was when I\n\ndecided to get another. This one has Cdr. James R. Dennison 1-1-68. The funny thing is that I was working at JFK airport at the time and one bracelet was always setting the metal detector off. Now I had 2. I always wondered if Capt Hill had come home and at the time I asked at that booth how I could find out and they told me to write to an\n\norganization.. Omega something .. which I did but never received an answer. It never occurred to me to check the internet. It was great to find all the bios and be able to read about my Pows but it was so sad to find out that Capt Hill is still missing. If the families of either man would like to tell me about them or send a photo.. please do.. it would\n\nbe my privilege to know more about these brave men.

Peter Sherman on the Internet.\n\nWith much hope I found the site for the Vietnam War Memorial and with much more hope found that there was a listing of all the names on the wall. At this point I almost stop, in that I really did not want to find Capt. Sherman's name listed. I had always hoped over these many years that Capt. Sherman was leading a happy and productive life. It was with great sadness that I found his name as one that gave his life for his\n\ncountry.\n\nHe may not be leading a happy life on this earth but he has been very productive!\n\nMemorial Day and Veterans Day have always meant a great deal to me, giving me time to reflect on the great sacrifice that have been made for this Country of ours. In finding Capt. Sherman's name on the Wall, will now make everyday Memorial and Veterans Day for me.\n\nI was one of the lucky ones that just happened to be born just at the right time, six months before my 18th birthday the war came to an end. If Capt. Sherman's family would like to contact me please fell free to do so, in that it would be an honor.\n\nGOD BLESS THIS COUNTRY AND ALL THE MEN AND WOMEN OF OUR ARMED SERVICES PAST AND PRESENT!\n\nTHANK YOU ALL!\n\nFrom - Sun Apr 04 21:31:46 1999\n\nFrom: HAPPYH0PES@aol.com\n\nSubject: Love Letter To All Of \"Our Hero's Everywhere\" OUR U.S. SOLDIERS\n\nTo Our U.S. Soldiers Everywhere,\n\nGod Bless and watch over you. You are so very precious to us. Today is Easter Sunday 4/4/99 and how my heart aches for all of you that are still in Nam (POW/MIA's) or on any other foreign ground. We will always love you, don't give up hope. Many of us are still fighting for you, please don't give up. I am asking everyone who reads this to please, take a moment and say a prayer for our men (all of them) put a yellow ribbon on a tree at home or your mail box and tell everyone else what it means. Write all the letters you are able to write to help let Congress know that we will not go away! Ask friends to join in and help. We must not stop, we are the only ones they have, that can ever make a difference.\n\nThere are many of us, lets \"join together\" and show them that the Viet Nam war is NOT over and it will not go away until our men are home! Please keep our 3 young men in Kosovo in your prayers, Sgt. Andrew A. Ramirez, Sgt. Christopher J. Stone and Spc. Steven M. Gonzales, along with all the troops and the families. Lord, please protect these men from harms way.\n\nMy brother, Derreld E. Ferrier III USMC, came home and we are so thankful for his return, even with all the seen and unseen scars. But, the men left behind are also my brothers and yours. Remember that and it may give you the strength to write that letter, tie that ribbon and pass the word to friends. \"Please, help them.\" This is my Easter Prayer, but it is not for me that I pray.\n\nFor all you that have come home, I am thankful and I can't imagine the feelings in your hearts. Although I was a 10 year old child, I know some of the pain in the pages of your lives and if I could change any of it I would. I am sorry that you indured this. I am Proud to call you my brothers and I love you all.\n\nGod Bless You,\n\nLisa\n\nThank you, to all the volunteers who give so much of themselves for this cause, at pownet.\n\nHAPPYH0PES@aol.com\n\nPlease be advised the letter 0 in h0pes is the number 0\n\nFrom - Sun Apr 11 18:07:07 1999\n\nFrom: \"Von A Ehman\" <VEHMAN@prodigy.net>\n\nSubject: S/SGT WILLIAM T BROWN 11-3-69\n\nFamily and Friends of William T. Brown,\n\nI have a copper POW/MIA Bracelet with the name S/SS William T. Brown inscribed on it. I purchased the bracelet mail order from the advertising section of Rolling Stone Magazine in 1970. Like many of that generation, I just wanted to be of some help to those caught up in the war.\n\nI wore Bill Brown's POW/MIA bracelet till the end of the Vietnam War. Even though it broke in half several times, I always managed to put it back together with electricians tape so I could continue to wear it. For some reason I just couldn't take it off. It almost became a part of me. In my youth I learned to play the guitar while wearing Bill's bracelet on my left wrist. Looking back I believe wearing Bill's bracelet probably inspired me to be a better musician, especially one on an emotional level. The Vietnam War touched a lot of people, in a lot of ways and hopefully some were positive.\n\nI had always wondered of Bill Brown's fate and have thought of him often over the last 29 years. I got a computer this year and I wanted to find out what I could about the man's bracelet that I had worn. From what I read in his POW Network bio, Bill Brown is a good man. Bill reminds me of my own Father, he also loved people from all walks of life and he enjoyed working with them. My Dad was in the Navy in WW II. I found it\n\ncoincidental that Bill Brown had two Brothers, I have two Brothers, my Dad had two Brothers and so it went all the way down our family line.\n\nI was very bothered by the war and how our people were treated and I still am.\n\nI hope and pray for Bill Brown and his Family that someday something will be known.\n\nGod Bless America.\n\nVon Ehman\n\n1610 Bigley Avenue\n\nCharleston, WV 25302"
