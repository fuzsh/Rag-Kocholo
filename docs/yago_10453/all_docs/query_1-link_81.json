        "text": "This is the old school house in Sturminster Marshall. It was used until the present school was built in 1911. In the 1950's it was used as a Sunday School.\n\n\"This old post card of Sturminster Marshall is taken on the corner of Balls Lane. In the foreground is the farm yard that was there in the 1950s. I remember there being a bull tethered right by that gate. A huge great beast with a ring through his nose. What is interesting about this postcard is that it is all gone now and in it's place is a bungalow.\"\n\nFrom Terri Davies postcard collection\n\nMary Ann KENT nee CLARK born 1834 Bere Regis died 1923 Sturminster Marshall. Married James KENT and had 15 children. This is a quote from her niece, \"She was an illegitimate child, and suffered much from it. She was not raised by her mother, who later married and had other children, but by an aunt.\n\nThe marriage between William PIKE and Kathleen RANDELL. 1923 Sturminster Marshall. Left to right; Daisy SWYER, Walter George RANDELL, William Henry PIKE, Kathleen Maud RANDELL, George Burt RANDELL and Laura KENT. Daisy and Laura were cousins of the bride.
