        "text": "1. Introduction\n\nThere are reasons to suspect that healthcare utilization patterns may differ according to marital status. First, healthcare costs among married Medicare beneficiaries are approximately half of those not married;[1] this difference in costs is observed among the nonelderly (age < 65) as well, but for the elderly, the difference is significantly greater.[2] Second, socio-demographic factors have been demonstrated to be important determinants of healthcare utilization.[3–5] Third, unmarried individuals have reduced access to resources that may affect utilization (e.g. health insurance and disposable income) than those who are married and may engage in riskier health-related behaviors,[6,7] possibly impacting utilization. Fourth, previous research suggests that being married is predictive of better health status,[8–10] perhaps attributable to more effective patterns of utilization. This study analyses health care utilization patterns based on marital status and aims to explore the importance of and mechanisms by which marital status may influence healthcare utilization, costs, and outcomes.\n\nA substantial literature supports a positive effect of marriage on health. Married individuals, especially men, have a longer life expectancy than the unmarried,[10,11] better mental health,[12] and report greater satisfaction with overall quality of life.[13] The observed relationship between marriage and health was initially thought to be due to “marriage selection” (i.e., married individuals may be self-selected based on health-related characteristics, attitudes toward health, or behavioral factors).[14] However, there is a growing literature regarding the concept of “marriage protection.” This concept implies a protective role of a strong social relationship that may result in better health because spouses (especially women) function as care takers, providing physical and emotional support.[15–17] The idea that social circumstances impact the production of health is also supported by the Grossman model of health capital.[18] According to the Grossman model, individuals are not only mere consumers but also producers of healthcare, and that such production of healthcare is impacted by investments an individual makes to improve their health, one of which is leveraging personal social capital, such as marital status.[19]\n\nHowever, because the literature does not corroborate the same extent of health benefits among unmarried cohabiting couples, marriage may influence health status in ways other than the “support function” of cohabitation.[6,13] Cohabiting couples are less likely to share resources (e.g. health insurance benefits or finances) than married ones. In an analysis of young married women (age 24–34), the positive health effects of marriage were found only among the unemployed, suggesting that the relationship between marriage and healthcare utilization may be modified by additional social circumstances.[20] In addition, risk-adjusted healthcare expenditures are lower among married couples despite better health outcomes (defined as the extent of change in or preservation of health status following an intervention). These findings raise the possibility that marital status may influence health outcomes through efficient (improved outcomes for a given cost or reduced costs without a decrement in health outcomes) utilization of health-related resources. The aforementioned disparate assertions and conclusions lead to two questions: First, do married couples differ in their patterns of healthcare utilization, and second, if such a difference truly exists, is it responsible for the previously observed differences in costs and health outcomes? In this analysis, we focus on answering the former question.\n\nTo our knowledge, the published literature does not include a rigorous analysis of the association between marital status and patterns of utilization across settings of healthcare provision. Most research on healthcare utilization is focused on specific disease conditions, a single setting of care, or among patients with a particular insurance status, much of which is not grounded in a robust theoretical framework.[21–25] Some studies have focused on costs instead of service utilization as the primary outcome measure.[1]\n\nUnderstanding any difference in healthcare utilization associated with marital status is important, particularly as population demographics shift toward unmarried status and family structures change.[26–28] If there are indeed significant differences in patterns of healthcare utilization according to marital status, this insight may prove useful in the future to improve health outcomes and maximize the efficiency of healthcare provision. In conducting this study, we hypothesized that married Medicare beneficiaries would exhibit a more efficient pattern of healthcare utilization across settings of care.\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThis analysis was aimed at elucidating the relationship between marital status and patterns of healthcare utilization among a sample of Medicare beneficiaries. Marital status was predictive of reduced use of inpatient and SNF services, with a trend toward greater use of outpatient services.\n\nThere are several important insights from our study that may have implications from clinical and policy perspectives. Reduced utilization of more costly inpatient and SNF care, with greater utilization of outpatient services, supports the assertion that the social components of marriage may result in a more efficient allocation of healthcare resources. Prior literature has identified a trend toward substitution of inpatient utilization with additional care received in the outpatient setting.[37,38] Outpatient visits enhance continuity of care, which has been associated with reduced hospitalization rates.[39,40] In particular, increased use of outpatient services reduces hospitalization rates among patients with Ambulatory Care Sensitive Conditions.[41–43] In fact, as many as 9%–22% of hospital admissions are thought to be avoidable with adequate provision of outpatient care.[44] Therefore, a greater reliance on readily available outpatient care may be one mechanism by which married people achieve better health outcomes. Additionally, outpatient visits are also much less costly than inpatient and SNF stays,[2,45] creating opportunities for efficient provision of care while preserving the continuity that is the cornerstone of longitudinal physician-patient relationships. The tendency to substitute costly inpatient and SNF services with less expensive outpatient services is likely an important reason why married Medicare beneficiaries have significantly lower healthcare costs than those currently-not-married. In addition to our primary findings regarding the relationship between marital status and healthcare utilization across multiple settings of care, our analysis reveals that older Medicare beneficiaries have lower outpatient utilization, but higher inpatient and SNF utilization. As expected, those with worse self-rated health status, a greater number of functional limitations, and additional insurance benefits have greater utilization across all domains of care. These findings are consistent with prior analyses.[46–48]\n\nOur findings support the assertion that marital status is an important predictor of healthcare utilization. Although the observational nature of the data source limits our ability to draw true causal inferences, this analysis does exhibit a strong association, robust to multivariate modeling, between marital status and healthcare utilization in the three domains analyzed. This ‘‘spousal effect” is also corroborated by our finding that unmarried cohabitating individuals do not have the same pattern of reduced inpatient and SNF utilization with a trend toward greater outpatient utilization. These findings raise the possibility that marriage may influence health status not only through the support and protection that marriage offers, but also through a more efficient pattern of healthcare utilization.\n\nIn order to translate these findings into relevant policy, it is important to understand the causal mechanisms for this ‘‘spousal effect” in healthcare utilization. Our study does not allow us to unambiguously delineate these mechanisms. However, several mechanisms could explain the observed associations. First, spouses may function as in-home caretakers, thereby obviating the need for formal healthcare.[17] For example, spouses may assist with medication adherence, preparing and encouraging the consumption of healthy meals, or ensuring attendance at physician appointments.[49] Second, there may be psychological and physical health effects of spousal cohabitation, and that may consequently influence the volume and distribution of healthcare utilization.[5,15] Third, marriage has also been noted to create what has been referred to as “spare capacity” – the ability to dedicate one's time, effort, and available healthcare resources to improve health as a result of division of labor and shared responsibilities within the home.[50] Similarly, marriage also facilitates engagement in resource sharing and mutual investment. Fourth, there may be a self selection into marriage, often referred to as “marriage selection,” resulting from unobserved characteristics that influence both healthcare utilization and health.[14,51] We have tried to control for this potential selection as rigorously as our data would allow through regression controls. Consequently, we believe that our estimation reflects the effect of marriage mediated predominantly by the first three mechanisms.\n\nWe believe the trend toward greater OPD utilization observed among married respondents is mediated by a combination of factors: (a) greater access to resources, including higher total income and more private insurance enabling access to uninterrupted care; (b) greater health-enhancing home support and assistance improving compliance with outpatient appointments; (c) and higher levels of education contributing to intelligent and cost-effective decisions regarding the appropriate setting in which to pursue care. The validity of these assertions is supported by the fact that the relationship between marital status and OPD utilization is weakened when adjusted for these factors, suggesting that the observed relationship is in part mediated through these mechanisms.\n\nOur study has important strengths. The MCBS is a nationally-representative survey administered to a large sample of Medicare beneficiaries across the United States. The depth of the dataset allowed us to adjust for a wide range of potential confounding factors. Our outcome measures also represent the broad domains of healthcare provision, conferring a more global perspective on the hypothesized findings. The models we constructed were based on a well-validated conceptual model, clinical considerations, and potential policy relevance. As we indicated above, for cases in which prior literature exists, our findings are consistent with those of other investigators using different data sources. Finally, our analysis produced robust estimates with potentially important implications. The positive association we observed between worse self-rated health status and receipt of an influenza vaccination (representative of propensity to seek medical attention) with utilization across all three settings of care supports the validity of the outcome measures we chose.\n\nThe major limitation of this study is that this is a cross-sectional analysis of secondary data that assessed an association but not a causal effect. Although we established a strong association between marital status and the utilization measures, it is possible that unobserved clinical characteristics or social differences that correlate with marriage actually mediate our findings. However, we believe that the depth of the data allowing us to perform a multivariate analysis among a nationally representative sample renders our findings valuable for plausible causal inference. Another limitation important to acknowledge is our inability to derive a relationship between marital status and health outcomes. We were also not able to delineate the diagnoses or clinical circumstances associated with inpatient and SNF use. If the reduced utilization among the married was for ambulatory care sensitive conditions, this would be of particular importance for health system structure and quality measurement. Incorporating such detailed clinical information would be an important direction for future research in this area. Although we have controlled for measures of perceived need for health care, we were not able to rigorously control for comorbid conditions using validated methods such as the Charlson or Elixhauser methods for risk adjustment.[52,53] However, as Andersen points out in the 1995 reassessment of his model, perceived needs (as may be reflected in self-rated health status) may be a better measure of care-seeking behavior compared to objective measures of health care need (e.g. comorbidity burden).[29] Since we did not have access to rigorous measures of respondents’ propensity to seek medical attention, we used the receipt of an influenza vaccination as a proxy measure. Despite its face validity as such, we cannot state with certainty the fidelity or robustness with which it ascertains an individual's tendency to pursue healthcare services.\n\nFuture research might examine whether increasing outpatient service consumption among unmarried individuals reduces their hospitalization rates and/or SNF use, and any quantifiable effect on their outcomes or the costs incurred. This would lend credence to the substitution effect described above. The ‘‘spousal effect” may be more than simply psychological, thus creating discernible patterns of behavior in which spouses engage in caregiving and healthcare system navigation, yielding measurable health benefits. Rigorous knowledge in this regard could facilitate the design of targeted healthcare interventions and home health services for unmarried people. Such interventions may realize benefits by simultaneously improving objective health outcomes and patient-centeredness, while reducing costs.\n\nThe impact of social circumstances on health care utilization patterns is not well understood, but we believe that our findings aid in elucidating the relationship between marital status and utilization of health care. This study provides important corroborative evidence to support such a relationship among Medicare beneficiaries. Therefore, we conclude that patterns of health care use may explain at least some of the variations in outcomes and costs observed across social groups. Longitudinal, prospectively specified studies might determine with greater confidence the extent to which a true causal effect underlies this relationship. Although we have explored the mechanisms that may underlie our findings, future investigations may be directed at more definitively elucidating the factors that mediate the observed relationships between marital status and utilization. A greater understanding of these factors may have important implications for clinical care, social policy, and improvements in health system design, which may hold the potential to optimize health and mitigate the economic challenges of healthcare provision."
