        "text": "Bavarian Royalty: Ludwig III's Children\n\nLudwig and Maria Theresa had a large family. The oldest child, Rupprecht was the crown prince, but never reigned as the dynasty was deposed at the end of World War I. The available images are notable for how plainly the children were dressed. The boys until about age 3 or 4 years wore dresses and then were breeched and began wearing plain dark Kneepants suits. The simularly aged children look to be dressed identically or similarly. Their sisters also wore plain dresses, all dark colors except for the very youngest. We do not yet know a great deal about the children, except for Crown Prince Rupprecht. In a group portrait, Rupprecht is the only boy wearing a uniform. Unlike the Prussian princes, the Bavarian princes do not seem to have been all sent to military academies. We have little biographical information. None of the boys appear to have died in World War I.\n\nCrown Prince Rupprecht (1869- )\n\nCrown Prince Rupprecht (Ruppert) was born in 1869, although he was not at the time the Crown Prince. He succeeded as head of the Wittelsbach dynasty in 1921 upon the death of his father, Ludwig III, the last ruling King of Bavaria. Since then, royal titles have no longer carried any legal status in Bavaria, but there is considerable social status.\n\nAdelgunde (1870-1958)\n\nAdelgunde was born in 1870 and married Prince Wilhelm Hohenzollern.\n\nMarie (1872-1954)\n\nMarie of Bavaria was born in 1872. She married Prince Ferdinand of Bourbon-Sicily, Duke of Calabria (1897). They had six children. We note a portrait of Prince Luitpold with his first cousins, Maria Antoinetta, Maria Cristina, Barbara, Lucie and Urraca of Bourbon-Two Sicilies. The little boy in the group we believe is Luitpold's brother, Prince Albrecht. Maria's only son, Ruggerio, died in 1914, at the age of 13.)\n\nKarl (1874-1927)\n\nKarl was born in 1874 and married Princess Isabella of Croy. Karl like his other brothers appeas to have worn plain dak kneepants suits as a boy.\n\nFranz (1875-1957)\n\nPrince Franz of Bavaria was born in 1875 at Leutstetten. His father was King Ludwig III. His mother was Princess Maria Theresa of Austria (1849- ). He was a highly decorated officer on the Western Front during World war I. He commanded a Bavarian Division. Prince Franz after the War married Princess Isabella Antonie of Cro√ø (1912). They had six children. Franz died in Bavaria during 1957.\n\nMathilde (1877-1906)\n\nMathilde was born in 1877 and married Prince Ludwig of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n\nWolfgang (1879-1895)\n\nWolfgang ws born in 1879.\n\nHildegard (1881-1948)\n\nHildegard was born in 1881.\n\nNothburg (1883-1883)\n\nNothburg was born in 1883.\n\nWiltrud (1884-1975)\n\nWiltrud was born in 1884 and married Wilhelm Karl, Duke of Urach.\n\nHelmtrud (1886-1977)\n\nHelmtrud was born in 1886.\n\nDietlinda (1888-1889)\n\nDietlinda was born in 1888.\n\nGundelinde (1891-1983)\n\nGundelinde was born in 1891 and married Count Johann Georg of Preysing-Lichtenegg-Moos.\n\nHBRC\n\nNavigate the Boys' Historical Clothing Web Site royal pages:\n\n[Main Ludwig III page] [Main Bavarian page]\n\n[German Empire] [Main royal pages]\n\n[Austria] [Belgium] [Denmark] [France] [German Empire] [German states] [Italy] [Luxenburg]\n\n[Monaco] [Netherlands] [Norway] [Romania] [Russia] [Spain] [United Kingdom]\n\nCreated: May 7, 2002\n\nLast updated: 12:10 AM 6/25/2009"
