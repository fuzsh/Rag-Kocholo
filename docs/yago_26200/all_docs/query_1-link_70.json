Luitpold Rupprecht Heinrich Prinz von Bayern) (b. April 14, 1951) is a member of the Bavarian Royal House of Wittelsbach and a CEO of König Ludwig GmbH & Co. KG Schlossbrauerei Kaltenberg.\n\nEarly life\n\nPrince Luitpold was born at Schloß Leutstetten near Starnberg, in Bavaria. He is the only surviving child of Prince Ludwig of Bavaria and his wife Princess Irmingard of Bavaria.\n\nMarriage\n\nOn June 25, 1979 Prince Luitpold married Katrin Beatrix Wiegand, the daughter of Gerd Wiegand and his wife Ellen Schumacher. The civil wedding took place at Starnberg and the religious ceremony followed a day later at the Andechs Abbey in Andechs, Bavaria. Initially the union was considered morganatic, but on March 3, 1999 the marriage was decreed to be dynastic in accordance with the Bavarian house laws. The couple had five children:\n\n* Princess Auguste of Bavaria (b. 1979)\n\n* Princess Alice of Bavaria (b. 1981)\n\n* Prince Ludwig of Bavaria (b. 1982)\n\n* Prince Heinrich of Bavaria (b. 1986)\n\n* Prince Karl of Bavaria (b. 1987)\n\nLater life\n\nPrince Luitpold is the CEO of brewery located at Kaltenberg Castle (\"König Ludwig GmbH & Co. KG Schlossbrauerei Kaltenberg\") and an organizer of the annual jousting tournament at Kaltenberg.\n\nBecause the current head of the Royal House of Bavaria, Duke Franz and his younger brother Max have no male offsprings, Luitpold’s father Prince Ludwig will become the next in line in the Bavarian Succession, followed by Luitpold and his son Prince Ludwig.\n\nReferences\n\n* Die Wittelsbacher.
