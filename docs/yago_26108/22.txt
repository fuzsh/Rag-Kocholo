Archduchess Louise of Austria (2 September 1870, in Salzburg â€“ 23 March 1947, in Brussels) was by marriage Crown Princess of Saxony as the wife of the future King Frederick Augustus III.

Louise was born in Salzburg to the exiled Grand Duke of Tuscany and his second wife, Alice grew up in a relatively informal household. At the age of seventeen she began to attract suitors, but ended up choosing the crown prince of Saxony, Frederick Augustus, and they married in 1891.

Upon arriving in Dresden, she soon found herself despising the strict and overbearing rules of Saxon court life, which brought her into conflicts with her Wettin in-laws. However, Louise was not infertile and gave birth to six children in eleven years, five surviving, which increased her popularity among the Saxon people. Her unhappiness with her husband caused her to have affairs, and her father-in-law threatened to lock her up in an asylum. Whilst pregnant with her sixth child, Maria Alix, she fled Dresden to Lake Geneva, where her brother was meeting her. This scandal was extremely damaging to the Saxon royal family, since they were very devout Catholics.
