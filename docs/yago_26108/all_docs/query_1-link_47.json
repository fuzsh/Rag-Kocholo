        "text": "Prologue\n\nFew princesses in history have lived as many lives as Marie Louise of Austria (1791-1847), born in Vienna as Archduchess of Austria, then Empress of the French as Napoleon’s second wife, finally Duchess of Parma, Piacenza and Guastalla after Napoleon’s defeat ( whom she did not follow into exile), with two morganatic marriages.\n\nNot only that, Marie Louise is one of the princesses who remain among the most controversial to this day and whose choices (or non-choices) in life arouse doubts and even criticism. Just a weak and frightened woman who let herself be carried away by events and the different men in her life, or a woman who voluntarily chose a low profile while living passionately as much as she wanted in each different moment of her life?\n\nLet us discover her long and compelling story.\n\nEarly years\n\nArchduchess Marie Louise was born in the Hofburg Imperial Palace in Vienna on 12 December 1791. She was the eldest daughter of Crown Archduke Franz and his second wife Maria Theresa of Naples and Sicily. She was therefore the granddaughter of Maria Carolina of Austria, Queen of Naples and Sicily, and the grandniece of Marie Antoinette of Austria, Queen of France as wife of Louis XVI. Her paternal grandmother was Marie Louise of Spain, after whom she was named.\n\nAllied with Austria since 1756, the kingdom of France was facing a revolutionary wave that put an end to absolutism and created a constitutional monarchy that the royal couple vehemently opposed. It was in this troubled context that Emperor Leopold II of the Holy Roman Empire, brother of the Queen of France and the Queen of Naples and grandfather of Marie Louise, died on 1 March 1792. Archduke Franz took the crown. He was only 24 years old and inexperienced.\n\nOn 20 April, France declared war on its ally, the ‘King of Bohemia and Hungary’, as the Archduke had not yet been crowned Emperor in Frankfurt. On 10 August, the King of France and his family were imprisoned; on 22 September, the Republic was proclaimed. Louis XVI was tried, sentenced to death and executed on 21 January 1793. Marie Antoinette suffered the same fate on 16 October 1793.\n\nMarie Louise was 22 months old at the time. The war against France lasted more than twenty years and had a profound effect on the young archduchess.\n\nAlthough neglected by her mother, Empress Maria Theresa, a cold woman who lavished neither affection nor support on her daughter, the young archduchess lived a carefree childhood between the Viennese Hofburg and the summer palaces of Schönbrunn and Laxenburg.\n\nMarie Louise was very close to her father, Holy Roman Emperor Franz II, and was his favourite daughter.\n\nThe young archduchess was brought up rather simply, walking the streets of Vienna with her father and playing with the children of the servants, following the precepts of the Catholic religion and the classical education of the princesses of her time, which was supposed to make her a woman educated to duty, capable of appearing in public but docile.\n\nShe studied languages, in particular French, the international language of the time, and Italian, the other mother tongue of her parents (her father, the emperor, was born in Florence and her mother, the empress, in Naples). The rest of her education included general but not very thorough knowledge of literature, arithmetic, geography and the history of the House of Austria and the major European dynasties. Marie Louise loved gardening, cooking, embroidery and music (her favourite instrument was the piano).\n\nRelations between France and Austria\n\nAlthough she was kept away from war and politics, Marie Louise felt the consequences of Austria’s battles against Napoleon’s France from an early age: the Treaty of Campoformio, which sanctioned Austria’s first defeats, was signed in 1796 when she was only four years old. In addition, she was instilled with a deep hatred for the French leader who, in her eyes, was the devil: among her toys, Marie Louise had a little wooden soldier called ‘Bonaparte’ that she enjoyed mistreating.\n\nIn Marie Louise’s eyes, Napoleon was the incarnation of the Revolution, the Antichrist who wanted to destroy the Church and the monarchies of Europe, while her beloved father was the defender of order and justice.\n\nIn 1805, during the War of the Third Coalition, Napoleon inflicted a crushing defeat on the Austrian army at the Battle of Ulm. A month later, the French emperor entered Vienna and took up residence in Schönbrunn. Marie Louise, aged 13, and her siblings were sent to Hungary. From the city of Ofen, the archduchess hoped that the fortunes of the war would favour the allies and wrote to her mother: ‘Fate will lean towards the Father, and the time will finally come when this usurper will be humiliated. Perhaps God will let him reach that point in order to deprive him, after having dared so much, of any way out‘.\n\nContrary to his expectations, Napoleon won the decisive battle of Austerlitz. The defeat was followed by the Peace of Presburg, which was rather unfavourable to Austria, which was deprived of many territories and shortly afterwards, in August 1806, the Holy Roman Empire ceased to exist. Austria was defeated and isolated.\n\nOn 13 April 1807 Empress Maria Theresa died at the age of 35 after giving birth to her 12th child, who was stillborn. Emperor Franz, who had become a widower for the second time at the age of 39, sought a new wife. In January 1808 he married his 19-year-old cousin Maria Ludovika of Austria-Este, daughter of the late Archduke Ferdinand and Maria Beatrice d’Este, who had been driven from their duchy of Modena by French troops and were living in exile in Vienna.\n\nMarie Louise, who was only four years younger than her stepmother, became her friend and their relationship intensified. Empress Maria Ludovika, who was unable to have children due to frail and delicate health, considered her husband’s children as her own. Of Marie Louise she said: ‘I do not think I could have loved her more than if I had carried her; besides, she deserves it, because her character is basically good‘.\n\nIn 1809, the war between the two empires resumed, as Austria wanted to cancel the peace treaty of Presburg. Once again, Napoleon proved to be a skilful strategist and the war turned to his advantage. On 4 May, the imperial family again fled Vienna, which was occupied by the French for the second time on 12 May. From Ofen, 17-year-old Marie Louise wrote to her father: “We live in constant fear, not knowing whether each new day will bring us joy or sorrow“.\n\nEmpress Maria-Ludovika was in charge of her stepchildren’s education, inciting them to hatred towards Napoleon. She would read out questions for her stepdaughter to answer aloud: ‘Who is the enemy of our happiness? The emperor of the French. And who is he? A villain. How many natures does he have? Two: a human nature and an evil nature. From whom does Napoleon derive? From sin‘.\n\nOn 6 July 1809, Napoleon won the Battle of Wagram and Austria surrendered; the defeat was followed by the Treaty of Schönbrunn, which proved humiliating for Austria.\n\nMarriage by proxy in Vienna\n\nOn 20 December 1809, Napoleon divorced Josephine de Beauharnais because she had not borne him a child. Doubts about his sterility had been dispelled: he had a son by Éléonore Denuelle de La Plaigne and Marie Walewska was also expecting a child by him. Napoleon, however, was concerned about founding a dynasty with legitimate descendants and therefore quickly sought remarriage.\n\nAfter ruling out French candidates, two were at the top of the list: the 14-year-old Grand Duchess Anna Pavlovna, sister of Tsar Alexander I of Russia, and the 17-year-old Archduchess Marie Louise, daughter of the Emperor of Austria. Annoyed by the lack of enthusiasm of the Russian court and convinced by the diplomatic activity of Count Metternich, who feared an alliance between Paris and Moscow and had persuaded Franz II to surrender his daughter to his enemy, Napoleon decided to reject the Russian alliance.\n\nMarie Louise was never kept abreast of the negotiations through official channels and wrote to a friend on 23 January 1810: ‘I know that in Vienna they already see me married to the great Napoleon. On this subject, I express the opposite wish that it does not happen and I think I would be the only one who would not be happy about it‘.\n\nNapoleon therefore accepted the Austrian Emperor’s offer. The marriage was also intended to calm relations between France and Austria, which had been at war for 18 years. “It’s a belly I’m marrying!” said Napoleon rather inelegantly.\n\nWhen Metternich officially informed the Archduchess of her impending marriage, Marie Louise complained to her father, who justified himself by saying that the agreement had been reached by his ministers without his knowledge, although it is unlikely that the negotiations had been conducted without the Emperor’s knowledge! Marie Louise agreed to “sacrifice herself for the happiness of the state“, although she hated this “Corsican ogre“. She commented in a letter: ‘I only desire what my duty requires me to desire‘.\n\nThe marriage was first celebrated by proxy, in the Augustinian church in Vienna, on 11 March 1810. The Archbishop of Vienna gave the wedding blessing and blessed twelve rings, as the size of Napoleon’s finger was unknown.\n\nMarie Louise left Vienna on 13 March. The great rite of the ‘handing over of the bride’ was set for 16 March. Napoleon wanted the ceremony to follow the protocol used for Marie Antoinette forty years earlier. The young Austrian princess passed in succession through three small temporary wooden rooms (the Austrian room, the neutral room and the French room): in the first she undressed; in the second she wore the clothes worn by the French imperial court and was welcomed by Napoleon’s younger sister, the Queen of Naples, Caroline Bonaparte; in the third she became truly French by passing through Bavaria, an ally of France.\n\nReceptions in her honour were held in Strasbourg and Nancy, while the meeting with the emperor was scheduled to take place in Soissons on 28 March. Impatient, the emperor did not wait and met the carriage at Compiègne, where they arrived at 9.30 p.m. on 27 March.\n\n“Marie Louise was in all the splendour of youth… her complexion was enlivened by the movement of the journey and by her shyness; her fine, abundant, light chestnut-coloured hair framed a fresh, full face, to which her gentle eyes gave a charming expression; her lips, a little thick, were characteristic of the ruling family of Austria…. Her whole person exuded candour and innocence, and her plump appearance, which she lost after giving birth, announced her good health‘.\n\nNapoleon later said that Marie Louise ‘was well-shaped‘, with ‘charming hands and feet‘. He wrote again: ‘When I went to meet her, it was the first thing that struck me. She was as fresh as a rose and without any coquetry; in this she differed from Josephine, who had plenty.’\n\nMarie Louise was then presented at court and Napoleon decided to break protocol: that evening he decided to have sexual intercourse with his new wife, but not before asking the bishop of Nantes whether the proxy marriage celebrated in Vienna gave him the rights of a husband over his wife. Having received a positive answer, he decided to join her before the ceremony in Paris. After verifying his bride’s intentions, Napoleon asked his sister Caroline to briefly remind him of the role of women during a wedding night.\n\nNapoleon later recalled that night during his exile on the island of Elba: ‘I went up to her and she laughed. She laughed all night‘ and again ‘She asked me to do it again‘. The next morning, beaming, he said to his aide-de-camp Savary: ‘My dear, marry a German, they are the best women in the world, sweet, good, naive and fresh as roses!‘\n\nNapoleon had Josephine’s rooms in the imperial palaces completely renovated in anticipation of the new occupant. He also bought Marie Louise an entire new wardrobe, mostly of white silk, and a large amount of jewellery, every piece of which he personally inspected.\n\nOfficial wedding at the Louvre\n\nOn 1 April 1810, the civil union was celebrated in the Grand Gallery of the Château de Saint-Cloud in the presence of the Court and the imperial family. During the ceremony, the first rift with the College of Cardinals occurred: sixteen cardinals participated in the wedding, thirteen refused.\n\nOn Monday 2 April 1810, Paris welcomed Marie Louise with pomp and circumstance under a life-size model of the Arc de Triomphe. At the age of 40, dressed in his imperial gown, Napoleon married the Archduchess of Austria, Marie Louise, aged 18, in the Salon carré of the Louvre, transformed for the occasion into a chapel by architect Pierre Fontaine. The marriage was consecrated by the emperor’s uncle, Cardinal Fesch.\n\nThe rift with the clergy had become more pronounced, as Napoleon was still under the excommunication he had received in 1809 and was considered a ‘bigamist’ by them in the absence of Pope Pius VII’s ratification of his divorce from Josephine de Beauharnais.\n\nThe discontent also affected the court: Napoleon’s sisters and sisters-in-law refused to carry the train of the ‘Austrian‘, Marie Louise’s nickname, as Marie Antoinette had once been called. The empress did not know that she was already being spoken of in Paris in this way: the Bonapartists preferred Josephine, the republicans hated her as the niece of the beheaded queen, and the royalists disagreed that this marriage had given the Bonaparte family some sort of legitimacy.\n\nMarie Louise had no idea of the animosity her marriage had generated.\n\nLife of an Empress\n\nNapoleon quickly fell in love with Marie Louise, whose noble birth and domestic virtues he admired. Marie Louise proved to be an ideal wife for the Emperor: she had been brought up to obedience from childhood, was devoted and affectionate and did not meddle in political affairs. Marie Louise was a ‘delightful child‘; to the surprise of the courtiers, she used to call him by name using the nickname ‘Nana‘ or ‘Popo‘.\n\nMarie Louise was pleased with her new husband and her status as empress of the French. On 24 April 1810, she wrote to a friend that she was getting married, wishing ‘that you may soon be as happy as I am‘.\n\nIn the first months of their marriage, Napoleon spent much time with Marie Louise. They went on excursions together. They enjoyed hunts, plays, balls, concerts, operas, banquets and receptions. At the end of April, they embarked on a month-long honeymoon through northern France and Belgium. Napoleon often hugged and pinched Marie Louise, one of his methods of showing affection. Once back in Paris, Napoleon visited Josephine at the Malmaison. When Marie Louise showed signs of jealousy, he limited his visits to his ex-wife.\n\nNapoleon’s valet, Louis-Joseph Marchand, noted: “It must be said that the Emperor was very much in love with Empress Marie Louise…. The emperor attributed to her all the qualities that would make her loved: he said she was kind, affable and even playful in her dealings.”\n\nAlthough the emperor liked her, Marie Louise was, for the French, the new ‘Austrian’. In her letters to her father, she said she was happy, but sometimes let a certain bitterness shine through. The poet Lamartine described her as ‘a statue of Nordic melancholy abandoned in the middle of a French camp, amidst the clash of arms‘.\n\nMarie Louise did not feel at ease in this country and, as Napoleon wrote in his memoirs, ‘was always afraid to be among the French who had killed her aunt‘. The empress disliked the court atmosphere and the circle of compliant and accommodating nobles. In her diary, she wrote: ‘I do not like it when they flatter me in my presence, especially when the praise is not true, as when they tell me I am beautiful‘.\n\nThe courtiers were not long in despising the empress: Marie Louise was very shy, lacked the charm and ease of Empress Josephine and, unlike the latter, preferred the intimacy of her private life to Parisian society. A 19th century woman, while Josephine was an 18th century woman, Marie Louise was content to play the role of first lady at her husband’s side, displaying the upright and docile attitude she had learned at the Viennese court.\n\nThe young empress soon came into conflict with the Corsican Bonaparte clan, who had previously shown the same hatred towards Josephine. While Napoleon’s mother, Maria Letizia Ramolino, contented herself with casting contemptuous glances at the inexperienced young woman, her daughters worked to ridicule her at court. The only person with whom she had a good relationship was Hortense de Beauharnais, Queen of Holland.\n\nAs for Josephine, Marie Louise feared her and did not want to meet her. The two empresses are very different and Napoleon himself compares them: ‘In one – Josephine – everything is art and grace, in the other – Marie Louise – it is innocence personified‘; Josephine remains ‘always more or less distant from the truth‘ while Marie Louise ‘does not know how to simulate and never departs from the truth‘. Another big difference between the two concerned court expenditure on clothes and jewellery: Josephine even surpassed Marie Antoinette, already famous for her extravagance, spending for example 6,647,580 francs between 1804 and 1806. Marie Louise always remained below the 500,000 francs she was allowed.\n\nIn private life, the empress devoted herself to the activities that had filled her days in Vienna and pleased Napoleon. She continued to embroider and sew; playing instruments remained one of her favourite activities and she devoted herself to the harp, harpsichord and piano. Reading was an important pastime but also a tool for learning and education.\n\nMarie Louise gave great importance to meals and was a gourmet. She liked to play billiards, walk in the Elysée gardens and go horse riding in Saint-Cloud. She did not like hunting, which she only pursued in a carriage. As for Versailles, she had mixed feelings: she loved the Petit Trianon park, which reminded her of Laxenbourg, but the atmosphere seemed to her to be imbued with the late Marie Antoinette. Having grown up in the devout atmosphere of Vienna, Marie Louise went to mass on Sundays and various religious holidays. Within the limits set by her husband and under the strict control of the state apparatus, she was also involved in charity work.\n\nThe birth of King of Rome and the first regency\n\nIn July 1810, three months after her first night in Compiègne, Marie Louise wrote to her father that she was pregnant. The pregnancy presented no particular problems and the child’s title had already been chosen: King of Rome if it was a boy, Princess of Venice if it was a girl. Complications arose during the birth, which lasted twelve hours. The amniotic sac had ruptured, endangering the life of the baby and the mother. The doctor Antoine Dubois then asked Napoleon whom to save in case of danger. Napoleon replied that the priority should be to save the mother: ‘Come on, don’t lose your heads: save the mother, think only of the mother…. Nature has no laws, Monsieur: act as if you were dealing with a little bourgeois lady from rue Saint-Denis. Behave exactly as if you were expecting the child of a cobbler,’ replied the Emperor to Dubois, contrary to the custom of saving the child, which was equivalent to saving the Austrian alliance, thinking Marie Louise might give him other heirs.\n\nDubois had to use forceps because the baby was born from the feet, which made the birth very painful for Marie Louise. At 9.15 a.m. on 20 March 1811, the long-awaited heir, Napoléon François Joseph Charles Bonaparte, King of Rome, was born, but ‘without giving any sign of life‘. The baby was rubbed for seven minutes until he finally emitted a cry. Marie Louise had suffered greatly and the doctors advised against further pregnancies, which further confined the empress to her flats while the newborn was quickly placed in the care of her governess, Mme de Montesquiou.\n\nOn 9 June 1811, Napoléon François Joseph Charles was baptised in Notre-Dame Cathedral. His christening names paid tribute to his father, his maternal grandfather, his uncle Joseph Bonaparte and his grandfather Charles Bonaparte.\n\nMarie Louise, like many other sovereigns before her, could not take care of the child directly. Napoleon, in fact, had already planned his training and education, and his wife was kept out of the picture. To one of her ladies-in-waiting, she confided: ‘They are stealing my son, my darling child, I wish I could rock him, walk him, show him to the Emperor myself… I am sure that in Austria I would be allowed to spend every day with my son‘.\n\nWhen Napoleon had his heir, he devoted less attention to Marie Louise. He was fond of her and treated her with consideration but had to deal with the pressing demands of state and war. Marie Louise spent her time drawing, painting, playing the piano, doing needlework and reading books. She was rarely seen in public, which did not endear her to the French people.\n\nOne of Marie Louise’s ladies-in-waiting wrote: “[Marie Louise], accustomed from childhood to homage and respect and of a naturally shy and reserved disposition, knew nothing of the mentality of the French nation and had no one who could advise her, guide her and make her understand how essential it was, not only for her own good but also for that of her son, to win their esteem. But, although the empress had the fault of being cold and impassive in public, she was not to blame. She was constantly told that one must be natural and appear as one is; an excellent principle in private life, no doubt, but one that does not work in the case of sovereigns, nor in that of the great, who need to do many kindnesses and be very condescending to please the lower classes.“\n\nIn May 1812, Napoleon left for the Russian campaign. Marie Louise followed him to Dresden, where she was able to meet her father and stepmother. While Napoleon continued on his way to catastrophe, Marie Louise was able to travel in the territories of her father’s empire from June to July. On 18 July she returned to Paris. During the expedition, the emperor and empress exchanged numerous letters and remained in constant contact.\n\nMarie Louise missed him. She wrote to a friend: ‘I will only be happy and serene when I see him again. May God always preserve you from such a separation; it is too much for a heart in love and, if it continues much longer, I feel I will succumb‘.\n\nGeneral Malet’s coup attempt in October provoked Napoleon’s wrath: no one had had the idea to shout ‘The Emperor is dead. Long live the Emperor‘. Only Marie Louise, informed by Prince Aldobrandini, thought of saving the King of Rome. On 19 October 1812 the retreat from Russia began, while in Paris Marie Louise was increasingly worried: if Napoleon died, she would become regent on behalf of her son. On 18 December, shortly before midnight, Napoleon reunited with his empress.\n\n1813 was marked by Prussia’s entry into the war on the side of Russia and England.\n\nOn 5 February the regency clause without concordat was instituted, which Pius VII finally rejected, and on 30 March Marie Louise was appointed regent of the empire, although until then she had been kept out of affairs. On 15 April Napoleon left for Germany. The regency was a burden for the empress, although her role was only representative. All decisions were indeed taken by Napoleon and implemented by his closest entourage.\n\nThe regent’s official duties were to preside over the Senate, the Council of State, the Council of Ministers and the Privy Council. At the same time, obeying Napoleon’s pressing demands, the Empress continued to ask her father for help with the war, but to no avail. Austria remained neutral and preferred to enter into peace negotiations between the belligerent states.\n\nNapoleon did not accept the terms of the Peace of Prague and on 11 August 1813 Austria entered the war on the side of the Allies. The Empress of France sided with her husband against her own father. After Austria’s entry into the war, France’s position deteriorated. The decisive battle of Leipzig took place between 16 and 19 October: Napoleon was defeated and returned to Saint-Cloud on 9 November.\n\nThe second regency and the collapse of the Empire\n\nThe year 1814 did not begin under the best auspices: many in the country no longer praised the emperor, especially because of the increase in taxes and the recruitment of 300,000 men in November 1813. Marie Louise, for her part, was crushed by despair and confided to Hortense: ‘I bring bad luck wherever I go. Everyone I have had to do with has suffered from it to a greater or lesser extent and since childhood I have spent my life fleeing‘. On 23 January, Marie Louise was appointed regent for the second time. On the morning of 25 January, Napoleon took tearful leave of his son and wife. They would not see each other again.\n\nNapoleon again invited his wife to write to their father asking him to change sides, but Francis was adamant. The new peace negotiations, which began on 5 February at Châtillon-sur-Seine, proved to be a failure.\n\nIn the letters to her husband, Marie Louise speaks of a difficult situation: it is very sad, women and children are abandoning Paris, the paintings and treasures of the Louvre are being kept safe. On 8 February Napoleon writes to his brother Joseph, whom he has appointed lieutenant-general of the Empire, that if he should die, the empress and the crown prince should go to Rambouillet rather than fall into the hands of the Austrians: ‘I would rather have my son’s throat cut than see him grow up in Vienna as an Austrian prince‘. Marie Louise wrote to her husband: ‘Now I only desire peace, away from you I feel so powerless and so sad that all my desires are limited to this‘.\n\nOn the morning of 29 March 1814, the imperial cortege left Paris, threatened to the west by the Cossacks who had already occupied Neuilly-sur-Seine. The next day, Paris capitulated and the consequences of the defeat were significant for France, whose borders were reduced to those of the Republic. The Empress’ journey ended on the evening of 2 April in Blois, where the Council continued to meet. It was the fourth anniversary of their marriage and Marie Louise wrote to Napoleon, who was at Fontainebleau: ‘I believe that peace will restore all my serenity. You really must give me this gift quickly‘.\n\nOn 3 April, in Paris, the Senate declared the emperor’s interdiction. Napoleon told his wife to write a letter to his father Francis asking him to protect her and her son. The regent wrote: ‘The state of things is so sad and frightening for us that I seek refuge with you for myself and my son. It is in you, dear father, that I place our safety‘.\n\nOn 6 April Napoleon abdicated unconditionally, without Napoleon II succeeding him and without Marie Louise obtaining the regency. The next day, the news arrived in Blois, along with a letter from Napoleon to Marie Louise: ‘Farewell, my good Marie Louise, I am saddened for you. Write to your father and ask him to give you Tuscany. As for me, I only want the Elba Island‘.\n\nAt first, Marie Louise decided to join him at Fontainebleau, then she was convinced to stay in Blois. She wrote to her husband to ask for instructions, as some asked her to visit him, while others invited her to join her father.\n\nHer valuables were confiscated, not only state property but also her husband’s gifts. Marie Louise was terrified of ending up like Marie Antoinette and wrote to Napoleon saying that she had a fever, was coughing up blood and needed help. On 11 April Napoleon wrote to her and informed her of the decisions taken by the Allies: he was to be sent to the Elba Island, she and her son to Parma, while he would have preferred her to receive Tuscany, so that she could join him permanently on the island.\n\nOn 16 April Marie Louise met her father at Rambouillet, hoping to convince him to support Napoleon. Instead, Francis II persuaded her to go to Vienna with the King of Rome to rest.\n\nRenouncing exile with Napoleon\n\nOn April 23, 1814, Marie Louise’s return journey to Austria began. In her diary she wrote: “I send my best wishes to poor France. May it be able to enjoy the peace it so needs and may it be able to feel a little compassion from time to time for someone who has remained fond of it and who regrets her fate and the friends she must necessarily abandon.”\n\nDuring the journey, her health deteriorates significantly: she loses more and more weight, she is constantly feverish and she longs for “the peace that can only be found in the grave“. In Austria, she gradually began to recover. Later, she thought of finding support in Vienna, a kingdom in Parma and some stays on the Elba Island with her husband.\n\nIn Vienna, Marie Louise was initially welcomed with great demonstrations of affection. However, she still wanted to join the emperor on his island and wrote to him: “I console myself with the idea that you think of me from time to time, but I should not perhaps wish [that you could] forget me; you would have no worries while I, tormented, loving you more tenderly than ever, spend entire days despairing of not seeing you.“\n\nHer mood began to embarrass public opinion and her family, because she was distressed by her husband’s misfortunes. In June 1814, Francis II granted Marie Louise a holiday in the spa town of Aix-les-Bains; she was accompanied by a general whom her father trusted blindly, Adam Albert de Neipperg. The real purpose of his mission was to do everything possible to prevent the empress from joining Napoleon. Neipperg, who understood this perfectly, said upon leaving: “In six weeks I will be her best friend and in six months her lover.”\n\nTowards the end of August, the Duchess of Colorno, Marie Louise’s new title, wanted to return to Vienna to discuss her future and that of her son. Napoleon wrote to her that he would expect her on the Elba Island in September but Marie Louise had no desire to go there, nor could she do so without the consent of her father. During the return journey through Switzerland, Marie Louise expressed her feelings of love for Neipperg and the two became lovers.\n\nVienna and its congress\n\nMeanwhile, the European powers tried to reorganize the countries devastated by Napoleon’s conquests and on 1 October 1814 the Congress of Vienna was convened. Marie Louise was kept out of the initiatives of the Congress and led her court life in Schönbrunn Palace. Metternich defended her claims to the Duchy of Parma, which were contested by the Bourbons, as the Duchy of Parma had been alternately under Austrian and Spanish rule in the 18th century and the two contenders shared the same ancestor, Elisabetta Farnese.\n\nOn 8 March 1815, Marie Louise was informed of Napoleon’s escape from Elba: the former empress was distressed by the fear of having to return to France. In the last of the three letters written to Metternich, she declares that she places herself under the protection of her father, Francis II.\n\nThe powers of the Congress immediately declared war on Napoleon and Marie Louise hoped that he would be defeated. Her husband wrote that he was expecting her in April and made a request to this effect to Francis II, but neither the emperor nor his daughter were willing to accept.\n\nMarie Louise did not want a divorce from Napoleon but hoped that he would agree to an amicable separation and that he would retain no resentment about it; for her this separation had become inevitable, but it should not have altered the feelings of esteem and gratitude that she retained.\n\nOn 31 May 1815, Marie Louise was reassured by the pact between Austria, Prussia and Russia: the three great powers recognized the Duchy of Parma to Marie Louise and her son and, at the end of the war, she also obtained the recognition of England, France and Spain.\n\nLess than a month later, on 18 June 1815, Napoleon was finally defeated at the Battle of Waterloo. On 15 August 1815, while Napoleon was traveling to Saint Helena, Marie Louise wrote to her father: “I hope that he will be treated with kindness and clemency, and I beg you, dear father, to see that this happens, it is the only thing I dare ask for him and it is the last time I will take his fate to heart, because I owe him my gratitude for the calm nonchalance with which he let me live instead of making me unhappy.“\n\nWhen he was on Saint Helena, Napoleon spoke of Marie Louise with respect and tenderness. He kept a portrait of her on the wall. He reportedly told his companions: “You may be sure that, if the Empress has made no effort to alleviate my sufferings, it is because she is kept among spies who prevent her from knowing anything of what I suffer, because Marie Louise is virtue personified.“\n\nWhen the Congress resumed, England, Spain and France refused to grant Parma to Marie Louise and her son, considered a symbol of the rebirth of Bonapartism. Subsequently, the duchies were granted to Marie Louise for her lifetime, but she was not allowed to take her son with her, who would not inherit her duchy, which upon Marie Louise’s death would pass to the heir of Bourbon-Parma.\n\nShe was given the title “Her Majesty Archduchess Marie Louise of Austria, Duchess of Parma, Piacenza and Guastalla“.\n\nDuchess of Parma, Piacenza and Guastalla\n\nThe new duchess left for Italy on 7 March 1816. At her side was her beloved Neipperg. The duchy did not lack support: the Kingdom of Lombardo-Veneto was governed directly from Vienna, the Grand Duchy of Tuscany was governed by Ferdinand III, one of her dearest uncles, and Francis IV, brother of the recently deceased Empress Maria Ludovika, reigned in Modena. His grandfather Ferdinand I reigned on the throne of Naples.\n\nBefore taking possession of her new duchy, the former empress of the French wanted to make her name Italian. She assumed the name Maria-Luigia, which she made public with a decree dated 29 February 1816. She officially entered the duchy on 18 April. Shortly afterwards she wrote to her father: “The people welcomed me with such enthusiasm that I had tears in my eyes.” Her first destination was the Ducal Palace of Colorno, her future summer residence. The next day she left for Parma.\n\nMarie Louise did not deal much with politics: it was Neipperg who governed the Duchy, obeying Metternich’s directives. On 27 December 1816, Marie Louise abolished the office of Prime Minister and on 1 January 1817 Neipperg was appointed Governor of the Duchy. The Duchess was content with the representative functions that she had already held in the past; she became the benefactor of her State and the patroness of arts and culture. All Marie Louise wanted was “to be able to spend her life here in complete tranquility“.\n\nIn Parma, poverty was rampant and hygienic conditions were very precarious. The first concern of the ducal government was to improve the balance of the State. From February 1817 the first liberal aspirations began to emerge through the associations of the Sublimi Maestri Perfetti and the Carbonari, who attempted to organize an insurrection. Under pressure from Vienna, Maria Luigia was forced to establish a commission made up of civilians and soldiers to judge the Carbonari with “justice and clemency“. The only two sentenced to death had their sentences commuted to forced labor.\n\nOn May 1, 1817, after French doctors declared she could no longer have children, she gave birth to Albertina, who received the title Countess of Montenuovo. On 8 August 1819 she gave birth to a son, William Albert. In 1822 and 1823, Marie Louise gave birth to two more children, Matilde and Gustavo, who died almost immediately.\n\nMarie Louise could not recognize her illegitimate children, who therefore could not live in the palace. This situation made her suffer, because their existence was known in Parma and Vienna, where her father had just married for the fourth time to Caroline Augusta of Bavaria.\n\nRegarding the future of her first child, Marie Louise wrote to her father: “It is my duty as a mother and my firm wish that future arrangements be made for my son while I am still alive“, and requested the Palatine-Bavarian territories of Bohemia belonging to uncle Ferdinand III of Tuscany. Eventually, as compensation, her son received the territories and the title “Serene Highness the Duke of Reichstadt“.\n\nNapoleon’s death and second marriage\n\nOn May 5, 1821, Napoleon died. Nobody notified the former empress, who was only informed on the following 19 July by an article in the Gazzetta del Piemonte. She confides in a friend, to whom she writes:\n\n“I am now in a state of great uncertainty; the Gazzetta del Piemonte has announced the death of the Emperor Napoleon with such certainty that it is almost impossible to doubt it, although I have never had very strong feelings for him, I cannot forget that he is the father of my son and that, far from mistreating me as the world thinks, he has always shown me every consideration, the only thing one could wish for in a political marriage. I am therefore very upset and, although we should be happy that he has ended his unhappy life in such a Christian way, I would have wished him many years of happiness and life, as long as he was far from me.“\n\nA few days later, on July 24, Marie Louise wrote to her 10-year-old son: “I am sure you will feel this pain deeply, as I feel it myself, because you would be ungrateful if you forgot all the kindness he had for you in your early childhood; I am also sure that you will try to imitate his virtues, avoiding the traps that ultimately caused him to lose.“\n\nNow a widow, Marie Louise was able to legalize her relationship with Neipperg, whom she married on 8 August 1821 with a morganatic marriage, her husband being of lower rank than her. Marie Louise’s children went to live in an annex of the ducal palace, accompanied by their governess and their tutor. In Parma, Marie Louise reproduced the bourgeois and Biedermeier environment of her childhood in Vienna.\n\nThe Duchy of Parma was a poor, rural part of the Austrian Empire, with a population of less than half a million. Marie Louise and Neipperg’s task was to keep the insurgency under control through a combination of repression and reform. They introduced a new code of laws and made some improvements to the infrastructure. Marie Louise laid out gardens and planted orchards. She rode horses, gave balls, attended the theater and played billiards, chess and backgammon with the court ladies. She made annual visits to Austria to see her father and her son.\n\nEight years after their marriage, on February 22, 1829, Neipperg died of heart problems. Maria Luisa is very touched by his death, but Vienna forbids her to cry publicly. Neipperg’s will speaks in clear terms of marriage and children, whom the duchess would have liked to adopt. Vienna officially recognized their existence through a written confession by Marie Louise on 17 March 1829, contained in the “Secret Acts” of the State Archives. However, she is not allowed to recognize or adopt her children.\n\nEmperor Francis II revealed to the Duke of Reichstadt that Neipperg, the man who came to visit him from time to time and whom he respected, was his stepfather. When he later learned that he had two half-brothers, the prince stopped all correspondence with his mother. He thus commented: “If Josephine had been my mother, my father would not have been buried in St. Helena and I would not be in Vienna. My mother is kind but weak; she was not the wife my father deserved; Josephine was…“.\n\nNeipperg was replaced by Baron Josef von Werklein, in office in Parma since 1820. He implemented a rigid policy, attacking intellectuals. Discontent was growing.\n\nRevolutionary movements of 1831\n\nIn 1830, the July Revolution drove out the restored Bourbons on the throne of France. From there the rebellion spread to the rest of Europe and, in 1831, there were also uprisings in the duchies of Modena and Parma. Marie Louise always had a lenient attitude towards the Carbonari, unlike her father and her cousin Francis IV of Modena, both reactionaries. However, it was Vienna that commanded Parma, through Werklein, and not the reigning duchess.\n\nOn 4 February 1831 Bologna, which belonged to the Papal State, rose up and a few days later the people of Parma demonstrated in front of the ducal palace shouting: “Constitution and death to Werklein“. The subject of the protests was not the Duchess. Marie Louise doesn’t want to resort to violence but she doesn’t know how to behave.\n\nBetween 14 and 15 February she managed to leave Parma where, at the same time, a provisional government was established, entrusted to Count Filippo Luigi Linati. From Piacenza, where there was a large Austrian garrison, Marie Louise wrote to her father to find another place for Werklein. The emperor of Austria then sent troops and, on 2 March, in Fiorenzuola d’Arda, the first and last attempt at rebellion failed.\n\nOn 8 August the duchess returned to the capital. The people of Parma are unhappy, not so much with the return of Marie Louise, but with the presence of Austrian troops in the city. To avoid further unrest, Marie Louise decided not to condemn the rebel leaders and, on 29 September 1831, she proclaimed an amnesty.\n\nThe death of her son and the third marriage\n\nThe Duke of Reichstadt, son of Napoleon and Marie Louise, was educated according to the Habsburg principles and undertook a military career, becoming an officer in 1828. However, his health was fragile, above all due to his growth which made him become a thin and tall. The unfortunate fate of the son of a fallen emperor and his delicate and melancholic beauty earned him sympathy and compassion, in particular from his aunt-in-law Sophia of Bavaria, unhappily married to the Archduke Franz Charles, she was an admirer of the Emperor of France who made her native Bavaria a kingdom.\n\nAt the age of twenty, the Duke of Reichstadt fell ill with tuberculosis which consumed him until his death. At the beginning of June 1832, his condition worsened considerably. Marie Louise was not initially kept informed of her son’s health, because Vienna wanted her in Parma due to the delicate political situation. As soon as more serious news arrived, Marie Louise did not hesitate to leave. On June 24th she finally saw her son, who died on July 22nd 1832, calling upon his mother who was at his bedside. His death was mourned with great dismay by the entire Austrian court.\n\nIn Parma, after Werklein’s departure, Metternich sent Wenzel Philipp von Mareschall to replace him. The new minister was quick to criticize the forty-year-old duchess, who protected her subjects and refused to adopt a repressive regime. He also argued that the duchess acted too freely even in her private life. Marie Louise had truly loved and been loved by Neipperg but, after his death, she surrounded herself with many lovers. Von Mareschall, judging the duchy ungovernable, asked to be replaced, which happened at the end of 1832 to the great relief of the Parma people. His task was entrusted to a Lorraine gentleman, Count Charles-René de Bombelles, an upright, austere and pious man.\n\nAfter meeting him, Marie Louise wrote: “I am quite enchanted by the Comte de Bombelles of whom I was so afraid; this is what I can judge in such a short time. He has all the qualities one could wish for and is, at the same time, firm and kind in his ways. He is such a worthy man that I am truly fortunate to have secured his services.”\n\nIn 1833, her daughter Albertine was 17 years old and ready for marriage. She married Luigi Sanvitale, Count of Fontanellato on 26 October 1833. Perhaps Marie Louise too began to desire another marriage and on 17 February 1834 she morganatically remarried Charles-René de Bombelles.\n\nOn March 2, 1835 Francis II died. Marie Louise writes to her friend Victoire: “I have lost the person who, in the most difficult circumstances of my life, was a father, a friend and an advisor.” With the new emperor, her brother Ferdinand I, a good but limited person, Marie Louise maintained purely formal relationships.\n\nFinal years and death\n\nIn 1839, Marie Louise said that her happiness was «in the consolation that my courageous children can give me and in the effort to conform, as far as my weak strength allows, to the duties that God imposes on me». Marie Louise is surrounded by the affection of her loved ones, by a husband who respects her and by children who love her. Albertina and Luigi Sanvitale had four children. William marries Countess Giuliana Batthyány von Németújvár and they have three children after the duchess’s death.\n\nOn December 9, 1847, Marie Louise, aged prematurely, complained of violent chest pains, which worsened in the evening and were accompanied by chills and fever. Despite everything, the Duchess presided over the Council then she withdrew saying in Italian: “Addio amici miei”. On December 12, her fifty-sixth birthday, she seemed to recover but her condition worsened again.\n\nThe whole city is afflicted by grief and a large crowd gathers in front of the palace. She asked for extreme unction and the last sacraments, then read her will: she appointed her cousin, Archduke Leopold (son of his uncle Ranieri, viceroy of Lombardo-Veneto), universal legatee. Her husband, daughter and son-in-law are around her, her son is absent, serving as an officer in an Austrian garrison. Her two illegitimate children, unable to inherit, each receive 300,000 forints and personal items.\n\nOn the day of her death she was perfectly lucid; around noon on December 17, 1847, after vomiting several times, she fell asleep peacefully so as not to wake up. At 5pm she died. Her doctor Fritsch gave rheumatoid pleurisy as the cause of her death.\n\nThe funeral is celebrated on Christmas Eve. Field Marshal Joseph Radetzky, commander of the Austrian troops in Italy, sent a squadron of Austrian hussars to Parma as a guard of honor. Accompanied by these soldiers, the former Empress of the French and Duchess of Parma began her final journey to Vienna, where the Duchess was placed in the Capuchin crypt.\n\nOf her brothers and sisters, only Maria Clementina, Princess of Salerno, her Ferdinand I, Emperor of Austria, Franz Charles, Archduke of Austria, and Maria Anna, Archduchess of Austria survived her.\n\nThe title of Duke of Parma and Piacenza belongs to Prince Charles II of Parma, grandson of the last Bourbon reigning before Marie Louise, and that of Duke of Guastalla to Duke Francis V of Modena.\n\nHer work\n\nIn Parma, Marie Louise reigned from the beginning as an enlightened sovereign. She devoted particular interest to the condition of women and in September 1817 she inaugurated the Maternity Hospice and a technical-practical school of midwifery where eight girls were trained for eighteen months.\n\nMarie Louise also thinks of the mentally ill, whom she transfers to a spacious and comfortable environment, called the Hospice of the Pazzerelli. She was interested in the prevention and fight against epidemics, in particular through regulations that served to combat a typhoid epidemic in March 1817.\n\nAs early as 1831 she worried about a possible cholera epidemic and when it arrived, in June 1836, she faced it courageously. To help the city, she melted down a precious table offered by the city of Paris for her marriage to Napoleon and earned 125,000 francs from it.\n\nThe first architectural work carried out under the reign of Marie Louise was the construction of the bridge over the Taro designed by Antonio Cocconcelli, which employed 300 workers. The works began in 1816 and lasted three years. The inauguration took place on 10 October 1819, in the presence of the duchess who, on this occasion, drew lots for twenty-four “marriageable girls” to whom she gave 250 new Parma lire as a dowry. She relaunched the Napoleonic project of a road to cross the Apennines. She completes the construction site of the Villetta cemetery.\n\nMarie Louise, a lover of music, had the new Ducalt Theater built, today the Teatro Regio, whose construction began in 1821 and was completed in 1829, with an astronomical expense of 1,190,664 lire. It was inaugurated on 13 May 1829 with Zaira, a new opera by Vincenzo Bellini. The curtain is painted by Giovan Battista Borghesi with an allegory representing the ducal court, where Marie Louise is represented in the central figure as Minerva. The Duchess imposed low prices to open the theater to the less wealthy.\n\nIn 1821 Marie Louise also created the Conservatory of Parma, where the great conductor Arturo Toscanini would later study. The composer symbol of the Risorgimento, Giuseppe Verdi, to whom Marie Louise had granted a scholarship, dedicated one of his first operas to her, I Lombardi alla prima crociata (1843).\n\nMarie Louise is much loved by the people of Parma who call her “the good duchess“.\n\nFor further reading\n\nDeborah Jay, Napoleon’s Other Wife (2015)"
