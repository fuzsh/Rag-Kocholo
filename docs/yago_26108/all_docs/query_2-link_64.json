        "text": "I do apologise if I am beating a dead horse here, but the subject of France from the Revolution to the July Monarchy has been on my mind as of lately, and I'd like to try and get an answer to this question out of sheer curiosity.\n\nLet's say Louis Charles (or Louis XVII as he was proclaimed by royalists), his sister and parents escape in a successful Flight to Montmedy, then ends up on the throne during a Bourbon Restoration instead of his uncles. Who might he marry in the interim?\n\nHis mother, Marie Antoinette, had plans for his elder brother, Louis Joseph, to marry his first cousin, Maria Amalia of Naples & Sicily, and in the ATL \"The Bourbons in Exile: After Varennes\" by REICHFURST, that does happen, with Louis Charles marrying Grand Duchess Catherine of Russia. But as Louis Joseph did die IOTL in 1789, the option for a marriage between Maria Amalia of Naples and Louis Charles might still be open.\n\nI've found a few other potential candidates who might been options during an ATL exile:\n\nPrincess Maria Augusta of Saxony, the only daughter of Elector Frederick Augustus III of Saxony (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Maria_Augusta_of_Saxony).\n\nArchduchess Maria Amalia of Austria, the youngest daughter of Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archduchess_Maria_Amalia_of_Austria_(1780-1798)).\n\nTsar Paul of Russia's elder daughters - Alexandra (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duchess_Alexandra_Pavlovna_of_Russia), Elena (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duchess_Elena_Pavlovna_of_Russia), Maria (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Duchess_Maria_Pavlovna_of_Russia_(1786–1859)) or Catherine (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Pavlovna_of_Russia).\n\nPrincess Maria Louisa of Spain, OTL Duchess of Lucca (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Luisa,_Duchess_of_Lucca).\n\nPrincess Maria Isabella of Spain, OTL Queen of the Two Sicilies (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/María_Isabella_of_Spain).\n\nAny thoughts?\n\nWell, if he marries after the Restoration then most of those ladies will either be PAST their sell-by dates or widows, and also the whole political landscape is different:\n\nAlexander I of Russia proposed his youngest sister, Anna, for Louis XVIII/the duc de Berri, but then came the Hundred Days with the Bourbons losing their throne and Sasha decided that the Bourbons weren't really a horse he wanted to back (TBH there was some snobbery towards him, esp. by Mme Royal and the king, he was treated rather shabbily in Paris (Josèphine treated him better), and the jewelry that he gave Mme Royal as a partig gift she passed onto her chambermaids, that might've also played a part in the decision).\n\nAs to other Restauration options, Louis XVIII sent out feelers both to Naples and to Dresden for a bride for Berri after that. See, while Saxony had SUPPORTED Napoléon, it differed from Bavaria, Baden and Württemberg in that it hadn't actually married into his family, so I guess it was still a good idea.\n\nI agree about the Spanish infantas, and Maria Amalia of Naples reportedly burst into tears when her sisters (Cristina and Antonietta) left home after marrying, bemoaning that she was \"a bride with no bridegroom\" - so naturally when Orléans asked for her hand she was thrilled, her mother, not so much. (There had been an incident in the early 1800s when Berri was sent to Naples to scout out a potential wife (Maria Amelia or Maria Cristina) and there was a bit of a scandal that resulted in a kerfuffle with Berri sent home with no bride.\n\nAs to the Austrian archduchess, the match considered between France and Austria was a double one. Mme Royal would marry the duke of Teschen, while the duc d'Angoulême (her brother was dead by this point) would marry Marie Amalie, who would bring certain parts of the Austrian Netherlands as her dowry. Louis XVIII wasn't interested, since he pointed out that the Austrians were holding Mme Royal, and plus had never pqid the full sum of Marie Antoinette's dowry over to the French. (The Austrians had, but supposedly the reason Louis XVIII brought the topic up was to point out that as long as they held Mme Royal he wouldn't bite, it was either HER or the outstanding amount - Austria insulted, sent Mme Royal to Courland rather than cough up MORE money). Also, the Empress, Maria Teresa of Naples, might've influenced her husband in this decision, since in several cases, she made bones about Mme Royal being a \"poor\" relation of her husband, who \"owed\" him her loyalty (and could show this by agreeing to a match with Teschen (which Mme Royal refused, since she believed LXVIII that her parents had wanted her to marry Angoulême).\n\nWell, if he marries after the Restoration then most of those ladies will either be PAST their sell-by dates or widows, and also the whole political landscape is different:\n\nAlexander I of Russia proposed his youngest sister, Anna, for Louis XVIII/the duc de Berri, but then came the Hundred Days with the Bourbons losing their throne and Sasha decided that the Bourbons weren't really a horse he wanted to back (TBH there was some snobbery towards him, esp. by Mme Royal and the king, he was treated rather shabbily in Paris (Josèphine treated him better), and the jewelry that he gave Mme Royal as a partig gift she passed onto her chambermaids, that might've also played a part in the decision).\n\nAs to other Restauration options, Louis XVIII sent out feelers both to Naples and to Dresden for a bride for Berri after that.

I've had a look and I've only really got one candidate - Maria Leopoldina of Austria (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maria_Leopoldina_of_Austria), OTL Queen consort of Portugal and Empress consort of Brazil. Though, if the earlier double-Austrian match is proposed, I think Marie Antoinette might have jumped on it.\n\nA Louis Charles who is not captive of the French will be likely married as soon is possible. If Marie-Antoinette can have voice in the choice of her future daughter-in-law she will surely support her dearest sister's daughter so either Maria Amelia or Maria Antonia of Naples. I think at least Marie Antoinette really wanted one of Marie Caroline's daughters as bride for her son and Angouleme as husband for her own daughter (Married to him Marie Therese Charlotte will remain a French Princess and able to stay close to her family). About the Austriam matches I am not sure if she will accept something like that (Teschen is only the third son of Leopold) and in any case with Louis Charles alive and free the Austrian will have at least more courtesy: Louis XVII is the titual King and Madame Royal his sister and they are both close relatives and children of an Austrian Archduchess and if they are with her mother I think Leopold and after him Franz will not openly insult them.\n\nBerry was unmarried at the Restauration mostly become he was unable to find a bride and in any case he was a spare, his brother was already married but sadly without childrens. Louis XVII as titular king will be quicly married when he will reach the right age and a princess a little older than him (like his cousins of Naples) will be the ideal choice (because they do not need to wait for her).\n\nAfter the Restauration (but likely searching a second and not a first wife for the reasons I said before) the most logical choices are either Maria Leopoldina of Austria or Marie Caroline of Naples (daughter of Francis I and his first wife, OTL duchess of Berry) and I still think the princess of Naples a better choice (she is a Bourbon, not an Habsburg and she is not Napoleon's sister-in-law). IF her brother will be willing to force her a change her religion also Anna of Russia (the OTL queen of Netherlands) can be a good choice\n\nA Louis Charles who is not captive of the French will be likely married as soon is possible.

I know Marie Antoinette was on better terms, even friends, with Artois than Provence, but I'm not sure there's no way of knowing who Marie Antoinette wanted her daughter to marry. I suppose she would support a marriage between her daughter and Angouleme if she falls out with Emperor Francis.\n\nAs for Maria Amalia and Maria Antonia of Naples, I'd have to go with Maria Amalia, since, while both of Maria Antonia's pregnacies ended in miscarriages, eight out of Maria Amalia's ten OTL children survived into adulthood. Although, that might be because she and Louis Philippe weren't as closely related as she and Louis Charles were.\n\nI'm pretty sure Marie Therese Charlotte only married Angouleme because Angouleme's father said that's what her parents wanted.

Maybe Artois made that up for convincing Madame Royale to marry Angouleme but likely he was telling the truth.\n\nYeah, I had thought about Louis not marrying until after the Bourbon Restoration, but ever since watching a documentary on Louis XV, I've been under this impression that nobles, especially royal heirs, were under pressure to get breeding ASAP.

Though, if the earlier double-Austrian match is proposed, I think Marie Antoinette might have jumped on it.\n\nWell, the main reason that there was such a rush to get Louis XV was breeding was because his minister, the Duc de Bourbon, wanted to avoid the succession crisis that would occur should the young king die childless. According to the Treaties of Utrecht, the heir to Louis was the duc d'Orléans (whom the Bourbon-Condé hated (can't remember the details, but it started out due to sibling rivalry between Madame la Duchesse and her sister, the duchesse d'Orléans, and poured over into succeeding generations), according to French house law, the heir was the king of Spain. So while the Regent had been willing to allow Louis XV to wait for Mariana Vittoria of Spain to grow up, the duc de Bourbon was not. This was part of the reason that Marie Leczszynska was chosen, she was older than Louis and ready to start breeding posthaste, although the French courtiers disparaged the match, citing \"one did not even know who her grandparents were\" (despite the fact that she descended from the Piasts), and \"that her complexion had known no other cosmetics than melted snow\".\n\nA Louis Charles who is not captive of the French will be likely married as soon is possible.

IF her brother will be willing to force her a change her religion also Anna of Russia (the OTL queen of Netherlands) can be a good choice\n\nAs said, Alexander I was rather miffed with the Bourbons during his stay in Paris, and didn't consider them a horse worth backing. Plus, there would be an equal amount of snobbery, since the Bourbons (particularly Madame Royal) didn't consider the Romanovs as \"equals\". Mme Royal for one, pulled strings in Rome to move heaven and earth in order to prevent the proposed marriage between the Comte de Chambord and the Grand Duchess Elizabeth Mikhailovna"
