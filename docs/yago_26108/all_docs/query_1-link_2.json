        "text": "Maria Carolina (born Aug. 13, 1752, Vienna [Austria]—died Sept. 8, 1814, Vienna) was the queen of Naples and wife of King Ferdinand IV of Naples. She held the real power in Naples, and, under the influence of her favourite, Sir John Acton, 6th Baronet, who was reputed to be her lover, she adopted a pro-British, anti-French policy.\n\nThe daughter of the empress Maria Theresa of Austria, Maria Carolina married in 1768 Ferdinand IV, who allowed her to assume much of the power in the kingdom. By a clause in the marriage contract, she entered the council of state, the kingdom’s ruling body, when she had given birth to a male heir (1777). She soon brought about the downfall of the liberal minister Bernardo Tanucci and changed the court’s pro-Spanish policy to a pro-British one. Influenced mainly by Acton and possibly by the execution of her sister Marie Antoinette by the French, she took Naples into the first Austro-British coalition against the French Revolution and sent Neapolitan warships to join the British fleet near Toulon (1793).\n\nNaples joined the second coalition against France, but Maria Carolina and Ferdinand had to flee before the French (December 1798), who seized Naples, making it the Parthenopean Republic. After the overthrow of the republic (June 1799), the king and queen returned to Naples, where a massacre of the republic’s partisans, in violation of the peace agreement, took place, for which the royal couple must bear at least partial responsibility."
