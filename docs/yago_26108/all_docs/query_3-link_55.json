        "text": "The announcement of the pregnancy of Crown Princess Antoinette of Prussia (now known under the Germanized version of her name, Antonia) arrived to France in mid-February 1818; the news were widely celebrated by the court, the King and the citizens; however, the Queen at first refused to leave her rooms to celebrate, but was finally convinced by both the Dowager Dauphine and the Queen-Grandmother, because with this attitude she could win the hate of her husband and the population forever.\n\nIn the following months, the relationship of Marie Leopoldine and Louis XVII seems to be condemned to the failure, moreover because the King, after dispached his government affairs, spend several weeks in his hunting lodge at Fontainebleau. However, in April 1818 the whole court and the Kingdom, received shocking news: both the Queen and the Duchess of Normandy are pregnant.\n\nMarie Antoinette, happy to see the relations of her grandson and his wife improved, celebrated but pregnancies with joy: God finally answered my prays and with me, the wishes of the whole Kingdom....I ardently hope that finally a Dauphin arrived to this world and the Duchess of Normandy had this time a healthy child.\n\nIn contrast with the pregnancy of Catherine Pavlovna (who, being healthy and robust, continue her intense social life despite the warnings of the physicians), Marie Leopoldine, like the previous time, was forced to remained in bed after had several hemorrhages.\n\nIn the middle of the concern about the health (and life) of the Queen, in mid-August 1818 the court of France received the happy news that Crown Princess Antonia of Prussia, gave birth a healthy son at the Kronprinzenpalais on 10 June. The child, inmediately baptized, received the name of his father and grandfather, Frederick William. My child was so beautiful and robust....his father holded him all the time, and hardly could stay away from him....the King embraced and blessed me because I made my duty with Prussia and the Crown Prince..., wrote Antonia to her relatives in France.\n\nMarie Antoinette, with the news of her first Prussian grandchild, exclamed: Well!...our family was blooming in this year...now I'm the great-grandmother of the future King of Prussia, and, with the help of God, soon also of the future King of France.\n\nIn the night of 2-3 September 1818, the Duchess of Normandy woke up with severe pains. After nine hours of ordeal, she finally gave birth a daughter; the child was healthy, but unexpectedly the mother began with an intense bleeding, and soon was declared in her the fateful puerperal fever. In the early hours of 4 September, in the middle of intense suffering, Catherine Pavlovna, by birth Grand Duchess of Russia and by marriage Duchess of Normandy, died at the Luxembourg Palace aged 30.\n\nThe death of the vibrant and young Duchess of Normandy was considered a real tragedy by the Kingdom of France. Louis Charles, at first, refused to believe the demise of his beloved Katya and locked himself with the body in her rooms; was required the intervention of 5 soldiers to forcibly separated from the corpse.\n\nMarie Antoinette took herself the mission to wrote the Dowager Empress and Emperor Alexander I about the death of Catherine:\n\nMy dear and beloved Emperor Alexander and Dowager Empress Maria:\n\nToday, our Kingdom lost one of his most beautiful and colourful flowers....after she gave birth a daughter who was healthy and alive, the Duchess of Normandy leave this world, surrounded by her beloved ones and in comunion with Christ.\n\nMy eyes are in tears and my heart broke while I wrote this letter to all the family of our Duchess in Russia. I know that any word of consolation could be enough for the violence of their grief, but I hope that you had resignation and faith that in the other world, all were be together again.\n\nWith my heart near to both of you,\n\nMarie Antoinette, Dowager Queen of France and Navarre.\n\nThe body of Catherine Pavlovna was carried in solemn procession from Luxembourg Palace to Saint-Denis, where she was finally buried on 6 September 1818. During the ceremony of burial, some voices claimed that the Duchess can't be rested at the royal necropolis because she was an Orthodox; however, the Queen-Grandmother claimed that she converted to Catholicism in her deathbed, so she could be buried in Saint-Denis. Because Marie Antoinette was the only witness of the conversion, the question about if Catherine Pavlovna indeed died as a Catholic or was only a lie of the Queen-Grandmother, remained unsolved.\n\nThe widower, devastated and completely heartbroken, followed the cortege and collapsed when the body was placed in his tombstone, next to Louis XVI.\n\nSoon, the grief for the death of Catherine Pavlovna was replaced with concern about the health of Louis Charles: he refused to eat or sleep, and became postrated in bed with convulsions and high fever. After desperate attempts to save him, finally Louis Charles of France, Duke of Normandy and former Regent of the Kingdom, died in the arms of his mother at the first hours of 19 September 1818 at the Luxembourg Palace, aged 33 and only 15 days after the death of his wife. Reportedly, his last words were: Katya, I'm coming to you....\n\nThe remains of the Duke of Normandy were translated to the Tuileries, where received an state funeral by order of Louis XVII; with the flags of France and the oriflamme with the fleur-de-lis, for three days all the court paid their respects to the late Louis Charles. Finally, on 23 September, in an impressive cortege (all the parisians followed the coffin) the remains of the Duke of Normandy were placed in Saint-Denis next to his wife, according to his last wishes.\n\nMarie Antoinette, despite all her physical strength, was unable to walk without the help of her daughters, who are also devastated by the unexpected death. Shortly after the funeral, she reportedly say: Now I'm blind....first, I lost my right eye (in allusion to the Dauphin Louis Joseph) and now I lost my other and precious eye (the Duke of Normandy)....Oh God!, gave the force to live, because I don't know how to continue without my Louis Charles....\n\nOn 1 October, was celebrated privately the baptism of the little Mademoiselle de Normandy; she received the names of Alexandrine Philippine with Emperor Alexander I of Russia (after wom she received her first name) and his wife Empress consort Elisabeth Alexeievna as her godparents.\n\nDespite her inmense grief, Marie Antoinette formally took the guardianship of her two orphan grandchildren, the Duke of Brittany (aged 6, who continue with his delicate health) and the infant Alexandrine Philippine.\n\nA few days after the baptism, in the night of 8-9 October, the Queen began the labor pains. After almost nine hours, on 10 a.m. of 10 October 1818 all the churches of Paris began to ring their bells while all the population celebrated with fireworks and cheers: a son was born, automatically Dauphin of France and heir of the throne.\n\nDespite the inmense happiness of the royal couple for the long-waited birth of a son, the celebrations for the birth were firstly reduced in consideration of the Queen-Grandmother, although was Marie Antoinette herself who, sincerely happy for the birth, encouraged the court and population to celebrated properly the future of the country.\n\nThe birth of the Dauphin was celebrated for almost a week with parades, masses and fireworks. One month later, on 11 November, the child was solemnly baptised at Notre-Dame in a magnificent ceremony; he received the names of Louis Fran√ßois Henri, with the Queen-Grandmother and his maternal grandfather Francis I, Emperor of Austria as his godparents.\n\nTO BE CONTINUED......\n\nREICHFURST,\n\nSorry to hear you were unwell but glad to see you're doing better! My what a bunch of highs and lows here in this installment! Good that the Queen is able to quit pouting over the news of her sister-in-law's pregnancy [and HOORAY for Frederick William being born, and, hopefully sparing us from the two Kaiser Wilhelms]! Tragic that the Duchess of Normandy died from 'childbed fever' after all that bleeding [could the doctor/midwife have not bothered to wash their hands after the last patient before attending to Catherine?]. Even sadder is that despite the fact that he has two motherless children to live for , the Duke decides to will himself via no sleep or food to die so he can join her. Poor children becoming orphans and if the girl grows up, she likely will feel a GREAT deal of guilt over her parents' deaths even if no one openly blames her. At least MA has stepped up to the plate to become their guardian even though she's heartbroken over the loss of her younger son in her arms [yikes!]. Interesting,too, that MA told everyone that the Russian-born late Duchess had had a 'deathbed conversion' to Catholicism so her daughter-in-law could be entombed in the French Royal crypt. This is somewhat similar to what Robert Kennedy's wife Ethel and her siblings would do when their parents died together in a plane crash by claiming that their father George Skakel who'd been a Dutch Reformed Protestant his entire life had had a 'last minute' conversion to Catholicism so he could be buried with his wife who'd stayed Catholic and raised all their children as that!\n\nAt least there's some good news re the birth of Louis Francois Henri being born healthy [and safely to the Queen]! Will MA's great-grandson become King after his father Louis XVII's demise and will the new Dauphin decide to buck tradition and NOT opt for 'Louis' as his regnal name?\n\nOh, and any news from Great Britain? Haven't heard from the Prince Regent or Queen Charlotte since the Bourbons decamped for Courland and in OTL, they've dealt with the tragedy of losing the Heiress Presumptive Princess Charlotte of Wales in childbirth after bearing a stillborn son? Either of them survive in your AH? If not, will things still go to plan and will the future Queen Victoria consider marrying MA's Prussian great-grandson and uniting both kingdoms?\n\nI'm interested to see how this unfolds and am glad you're back!\n\nThe birth of the Dauphin Louis Fran√ßois Henri not only bring joy and the security of the continuation of the Bourbon line, but also caused that the King and the Queen spend more time together, who was widely reflected in May 1819, when Marie Leopoldine announced a new pregnancy.\n\nThe King paid more attention to his wife now than ever....we hope that this happy turn of events continue.... say the Queen-Grandmother to her daughters.\n\nDespite the love and care that Marie Antoinette showed to her orphan grandchildren at the √âlys√©e Palace, the death of her son changed: she became more reclusive and avoided ceremonies and balls. In company with the Princess of Lamballe, she visited every month the royal necropolis at Saint-Denis, and paid her respects to her husband, sons and daughter-in-law.\n\nIn the middle of her grief, the Queen-Grandmother remembered the death of Princess Charlotte Augusta of Wales, in a complicated childbirth on 6 November 1817. In a letter to the devastated Prince-Regent, she wrote: My dear Prince, we now are bounded not only by the grief of losing a dear mother and friend (Queen Charlotte died in November 1818) but also by the lost of our childs in such youth and grace....although you are more lucky than me, because you still are young enough to produce more sons, but I lost all my hopes.....\n\nThe uncertainty about the succession of the British throne also caused concern not only in the Queen-Grandmother but also in the rest of Europe: any of the other sons of King George III produced surviving legitimate offspring, and this caused the called Big Wedding Race between the bachelors royal Dukes.\n\nMarie Antoinette received some suggestions from the Prince-Regent that one of his unmarried brothers, the Dukes of Clarence or Kent, would married with the unmarried granddaughter of the French Queen, Elisabeth Th√©r√®se Louise. However, the matter was further complicated because according to the Royal Marriage Act of 1774 forbidden the union of a potential heir to the British throne with a Catholic. Finally, King Louis XVII, informed by his grandmother, declined to an alliance with Great Britain in a form of marriage, but renewed their maritime and trade treaties in the subsequents Treaties of Longchamps (18-19 July 1819), who bring the possibilities of a free trade between the ports of Dover and Calais.\n\nIn the meanwhile, arrived unexpectedly from Spain and Saxony marriage proposals: King Ferdinand VII, widow for the second time and without surviving issue, was desperate to had an heir and also wanted to renew the bonds with his cousins of France; by the other hand, King Frederick Augustus I of Saxony also wanted to secured the succession of his newly Kingdom: either him or his brother Anthony (next in line to the throne) had surviving heirs, and the heir apparent was their older nephew, Prince Frederick Augustus (born 18 May 1797).\n\nAgain, the Bourbons reunited in a family council at the Tuileries to examinate both proposals.\n\nMarie Antoinette was in favor of the Saxon Hereditary Prince, and her main argument in his favor was his closeness in age with Elisabeth Th√©r√®se Louise. The Counts of Provence and Artois, with Madame Elisabeth, enthusiastically supported this union, because they are half-Wettins through their mother.\n\nThe Queen, by the other hand, was bitterly against the union with Saxony, because her younger sister, Archduchess Maria Carolina (once considered a possible wife for Louis XVII), was also an intended bride for the Saxon Hereditary Prince, and tried by any means to blocked the intentions of the Queen-Grandmother and the old royals.\n\nFinally, Louis XVII decided the matter: after humbly appologize to his wife, he reportedly say to her: Madame, we know your sister the Archduchess wasn't a wife material: she suffered from epilepsy and had frequent seizures....please, change your decision and allowed the Princess Elisabeth to go to her happiness. As a dutiful and obedient wife, Marie Leopoldine, burdened and tired by her pregnancy, agreed with her husband.\n\nOn 1 August 1819 was formally accepted the proposal of the Kingdom of Saxony, and were made the preparations for the inminent arrival of the Saxon entourage in order to bring the future Crown Princess to her new homeland.\n\nTwo months later, on 18 October, the Saxon cortege arrived to Paris in the middle of parades and celebrations. The entourage, leaded by Prince Anthony of Saxony, paid their respects to Louis XVII and the whole royal family at the Tuileries. Marie Leopoldine, in the final stages of her pregnancy, only had a brief appearance at court and remained in bed.\n\nFor the Counts of Provence and Artois, with Madame Elisabeth, this was a happy family reunion: Prince Anthony and King Frederick Augustus I are their first cousins, being both sons of Frederick Christian, Elector of Saxony, in turn elder brother of Maria Josepha, Dauphine of France and mother of Louis XVI, Provence, Artois and Madame Elisabeth.\n\nThe marriage by proxy between Frederick Augustus, Crown Prince of Saxony and Princess Elisabeth Th√©r√®se Louise of France was signed at the Tuileries Palace on 29 October 1819, with all the parisians celebrating that another of his princesses being a future Queen. Like her older sister Crown Princess Antonia of Prussia, Elisabeth Th√©r√®se Louise received a magnificent trousseau and a dowry of 250,000 livres.\n\nTwo days later, on 31 October, Elisabeth Th√©r√®se Louise parted from the Tuileries and France forever with the Saxon entourage and also escorted by a French contingent leaded by her brother the Duke of Anjou, following the instructions of Louis XVII.\n\nTO BE CONTINUED.....\n\nOn the night of 15-16 November 1819, the Queen began the labor pains, and after only three hours, at 4 a.m. of 16 November, she gave birth a son, styled Duke of Aquitaine and now third in line to the throne.\n\nThe joy of the citizens of Paris and the court was enormous, moreover because this birth secured even further the Bourbon line; the King, sincerely grateful to his wife, embraced her, being the first time that he did this public demostration of affection to Marie Leopoldine, who recovered quickly from this childbirth.\n\nHowever, the joy and happiness was short-lived: the Duke of Aquitaine showed alarming signs of weakeness, and after a violent attack of convulsions, was decided that he must to be hurriedly baptized the next day of his birth, on 17 November at the private rooms of the Queen at the Tuileries; he received the name of Louis Joseph Auguste, with the Count of Provence and Madame Elisabeth as his godparents.\n\nAfter only 15 days of life, Louis Joseph Auguste of France, Duke of Aquitaine, died on 1 December 1819 at the Tuileries Palace after another attack of convulsions.\n\nThe body of the little prince was transported to Saint-Denis on 3 December and buried next to his grandfather and namesake the Dauphin Louis Joseph and granduncle the Duke of Normandy.\n\nIn a letter to her granddaughter the Crown Princess of Prussia, Marie Antoinette say: The whole court and the Kingdom are in tears with the death of our little Duke of Aquitaine....the Queen barely can leave her rooms and the King distracted himself hunting....now they worries and concerns are concentrated in the Dauphin, whose health also wasn't good...\n\nThe health of the Dauphin Louis Fran√ßois Henri, at first robust, began to deteriorate quickly since mid-August, with bounts of high fever. Although the fever ceded enough to be present with the rest of the royal family at the customary Christmas and New Year celebrations at Fontainebleau on mid-December/January 1819-20, after his return to Paris the high fever returned, this time more violently, and ultimately, fatally.\n\nLouis Fran√ßois Henri, Dauphin of France, died at the Tuileries Palace in the early hours of 18 January 1820 aged 15 months. Two days later, on 20 January, his body was transported to Saint-Denis and buried next to his brother the Duke of Aquitaine.\n\nThe death of his two sons within a month of difference devastated both the King and Queen. Marie Leopoldine collapsed at the sight of the coffin of her son the Dauphin, and the King tried to confort her; the court noted that their common sorrow bring the royal spouses more close than ever.\n\nMarie Antoinette, always dressed in mourning, sadly remarked to the Princess of Lamballe after the burial ceremony ended: Now my dear friend, the House of Bourbon only knew the mourning....first happiness, now sadness, what cruel destiny take me!....if someone would warning me about all the tears that I must to suffer when I leave Vienna, I would chose to became a nun.....\n\nThe whole city of Paris was decorated with large black tapestries with the fleur-de-lis as a sign of mourning; all the festivities, celebrations and parades were banned for a year in consideration for the royal family.\n\nTO BE CONTINUED.....\n\nThe Saxon-French entourage, leaded by Prince Anthony of Saxony and the Duke of Anjouy, arrived to Dresden, the capital of the Kingdom of Saxony, in the early hours of 28 December 1819. The whole population was anxiously waiting his new Crown Princess, who could bring new life to the old and strict Saxon court.\n\nElisabeth Th√©r√®se Louise arrived at the Residenzschloss, the official royal residence, surrounded by knights and courtesans who waited her at the doors of the palace in order to introduce her to the King and the royal family.\n\nThe Duke of Anjou, young and brillant with his hussar uniform, escorted his sister in front of King Frederick Augustus I, who warmly embraced her. Queen Amalie and Princess Maria Theresia of Austria (wife of Prince Anthony) showed some coldness towards her, probably because as the new and young Crown Princess, Elisabeth Th√©r√®se Louise would overshadowed both; however, following the indications gave by her mother before her departure (with the Queen and Princess Anthony you must to be extremely sweetness), the French princess quickly won the hearts of both ladies.\n\nAfter them, she was formally introduced to the Royal Princess, Maria Augusta, the only surviving child of the royal couple: a 36-years-old spinster, she and Elisabeth Th√©r√®se Louise soon became close friends.\n\nInmediately, Elisabeth Th√©r√®se Louise was introduced to her future father-in-law, Prince Maximilian, sisters-in-law and brother-in-law, all of them became extremely delighted with the charm and graceful manners of the French princess. Finally, she met her future husband, Crown Prince Frederick Augustus. As witnesses later recalled, the groom became so obsessed with his charming bride, that he was desperate to marry and consumated the union inmediately.\n\nThe marriage between Crown Prince Frederick Augustus of Saxony and Princess Elisabeth Th√©r√®se Louise of France took place on 30 December 1819 at Dresden Cathedral (Katholische Hofkirche) in a solemn but magnificent ceremony. The bride wore her wedding dress in French style, made of silk and silver and, at her request, identical to the one who used her older sister the Crown Princess of Prussia in her wedding.\n\nThe celebrations and parades lasted almost one week; at the request of the Crown Princess, the Duke of Anjou and the whole French cortege remained in the Saxon court to participated in the balls and festivities.\n\nAmong of the guests of the Saxon court where Prince Friedrich Karl Emil of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, his wife Sophie Eleonore Friederike (by birth Baroness of Scheel) and their children. Among the daughters of the Prince, the eldest, Charlotte Louise Dorothea Josephine (aged 16) caught the eye of the Duke of Anjou. Aimed by her parents, the timid princess danced all night with the Duke, and they barely separated to each other during the celebrations. Louis Fr√©d√©ric Guillaume became deeply in love, and secretly asked the hand of the princess to her parents, who are overjoyed with proud and happiness. However, he can't made a formal request without the permission of his brother Louis XVII, so he had to wait until his return home to asked it.\n\nFinally, once the week of celebrations ended, the French entourage parted from Dresden. The Duke of Anjou, with a bride in his mind, was ready to fight for his happiness.\n\nTO BE CONTINUED....."
