        "text": "Intro\n\nCarola of Vasa (1833-1907) was one of Europe’s most beautiful princesses in the 1850s. Her beauty fascinated the most coveted princes of Europe, including Napoleon III, Emperor of the French.\n\nThe daughter of the former crown prince of Sweden, Gustavus, Prince of Vasa, and his wife, Princess Louise Amelie of Baden, Carola was the only surviving granddaughter of Gustavus IV Adolf, the last king of Sweden belonging to the house of Vasa.\n\nIn 1853, she married Albert of Saxony, becoming the last queen consort of Saxony. She is remembered for her great kindness and numerous charitable activities.\n\nKey points\n\nIn this article on Carola Di Vasa, Queen Consort of Saxony, we will analyse the following key points:\n\nCarola of Vasa was born in exile at Schönbrunn Castle in Vienna, the only surviving daughter of the former Crown Prince of Sweden, Gustavus, Prince of Vasa, and his wife, Princess Louise Amelie of Baden.\n\nThe parents divorced in 1844 and Carola mostly followed her mother on her travels to warmer climates, more suited to Louise Amelie’s ailing health.\n\nIn 1852, Carola wanted to convert to Catholicism, despite her father’s disagreement, and soon after met Albert, Crown Prince of Saxony, with whom it was ‘love at first sight‘.\n\nThey married in 1853 and, despite being childless, their marriage was solid, bound by mutual love and respect.\n\nDuring the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 and later, during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, Carola of Vasa distinguished herself for her great help to the wounded and for her numerous charitable activities, which were core to her entire existence.\n\nUpon her father-in-law’s death in 1873, Carola became Queen Consort of Saxony, devoting most of her time to improving living conditions in Saxony.\n\nThanks to Carola, the deposed Swedish branch of the House of Holstein-Gottorp made peace with the new Bernadotte dynasty in 1884.\n\nHaving no children, the throne would pass to Albert’s brother George and then to the latter’s son, Frederick Augustus, who had married Archduchess Louise of Austria, known for her eccentricities and who caused a scandal after the death of Albert of Saxony.\n\nIn 1902, Albert of Saxony died next to his inconsolable widow, who lived a simple and withdrawn life from then on, dying five years later in 1907.\n\nOn 13 November 1918, Frederick Augustus abdicated the throne and the monarchy was abolished.\n\nEarly years\n\nCarola of Vasa was born on 5 August 1833, the daughter of the former Crown Prince of Sweden, Gustavus, Prince of Vasa, and his wife, Princess Louise Amelie of Baden. Carola was the only surviving granddaughter of Gustavus IV Adolf, the last king of Sweden belonging to the house of Vasa.\n\nCarola was therefore born in exile in Schoenbrunn Palace in Vienna, where her father was serving in the army. Carola was actually called Caroline, but the nickname Carola stuck and is the name by which she is known today.\n\nThe princess did not come from the Vasa dynasty, as her name might suggest. Rather, she owes the suffix to her father who, as a member of the deposed Swedish House of Holstein-Gottorp, could no longer call himself ‘Prince of Sweden’. Instead, he gave himself the nicknames of Vasa and (to further assert his claim to the throne) Holstein-Gottorp, hence Vasa-Holstein-Gottorp. As a result, Carola also took this surname.\n\nThe family owned a country house in Hacking, near Vienna, where they lived during the summer months. The rest of the time was divided between the city palace in Vienna, Stöckl, and Carola’s favourite Schloss Eichhorn in Moravia. The princess loved nature and spent many hours hiking with her mother and her English teacher.\n\nParents’ divorce\n\nIn 1844 her parents divorced, which not only meant the break-up of the family, but also that Carola had to leave Eichhorn. Her mother had tried to buy it, but without success. In the end, Louise Amelie bought Schloss Morawetz, which included many properties but was still being renovated after having risked burning down. Carola quickly learned the Czech language and took a keen interest in the welfare of the local population. She also loved to put on plays with her friends.\n\nWhen she was not with her mother, she was with her father in Vienna or with her grandmother in Baden-Baden or Mannheim. In 1849, Carola and her mother had to go to a warmer climate because of Louise Amelie’s health. She had been suffering from asthma and heart problems for some time and had deteriorated rapidly.\n\nMother and daughter also travelled to South Tyrol, where Carola discovered her love of painting. She spent the winter of 1849/1850 with her mother in Venice.\n\nConverting to Catholicism\n\nCarola managed to shock her family when she declared that she did not want to be confirmed in the Lutheran faith but wanted to convert to Catholicism. Her father was against her conversion and Carola found herself in deep conflict. At her father’s insistence, the girl would receive Protestant instructions from her aunt Sophie, Grand Duchess of Baden, and if she still wanted to convert after that, he would not stand in her way. This meant that she would not see her mother and grandmother for some time.\n\nEventually, Carola accepted her father’s conditions and went to the court in Karlsruhe, where she was deeply dissatisfied with the forced lessons. After realising the impact of the lessons on his daughter’s well-being, her father agreed to discontinue them. On 4 November 1852, Carola converted to the Catholic faith. Shortly afterwards she met the man who was to become her husband, the future King Albert of Saxony (who was the uncle of Queen Margherita of Savoy, as brother of her mother Elisabeth of Saxony).\n\nLove at first sight\n\nAlbert and his brother George were hunting in the Morawetz area, guests of Archduke Albrecht of Austria, and it would have been rude not to visit Louise Amelie and Carola. In fact, both parties were aware that it was not a simple courtesy visit: Albert, second in line to the Saxon throne, was 24 years old and Carola, at 19, was the right age for him.\n\nDuring the banquet for the princes and other royals, Albert introduced himself to Carola and was impressed by her grace and witty conversation. In later notes, Albert described his meeting with Carola as ‘love at first sight‘. On his return to Saxony, Albert asked his father to open negotiations for marriage. Carola’s parents gladly agreed and the two met again on 2 December 1852. They were allowed to spend some time alone and, at the end of the day, they were officially engaged.\n\nWedding to Albert of Saxony\n\nThe wedding date was set for 18 June 1853. Shortly before leaving, Carola wrote to a friend: ‘I will be at home for the last time. My heart aches when I think of the Austrian border. I love this dear country more than I know. The difficult separation from my good mother, all the new duties that await me, entering a completely different family, considering it as my own, and the fact that I am actually a very spoilt person, spoilt by the love and endless indulgence of the people I know‘.\n\nOn the journey to Dresden, Louise Amelie suffered a heart attack and was in very poor condition when they finally arrived in Bodenbach. Here they were met by Albert, who would travel with them on a specially decorated wedding train to Dresden. Louise Amelie improved and was at her daughter’s side during the great reception she received in the city. On 18 June, she also joined her daughter in the open gala carriage that would take them to the church. The wedding celebrations lasted until 2 July. Carola charmed people wherever she went and made an excellent first impression. The newlyweds moved into the Taschenbergpalais in Dresden.\n\nChildless love marriage\n\nAt the beginning of the following year, Carola visited her seriously ill mother in Morawetz, who died tragically on 19 July, aged just 43.\n\nDuring the following year, the crown prince couple travelled extensively, to Switzerland, Italy and Austria. In 1859, they moved to the royal villa of Strehlen in Dresden. The marriage between Carola and her husband was known to be a love marriage, but they had no children together. She reportedly had several miscarriages.\n\nShe devoted herself to charity work and liked to paint and play the piano. She also enjoyed horse riding, but gave it up when her eyesight deteriorated.\n\nThe great help during the wars\n\nDuring the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, Albert lead the army while Carola cared for the wounded soldiers in Prague. When Prague itself was threatened, they were transferred to Regensburg and then to Vienna, where Carola had grown up. Carola continued to visit hospitals and did not back down, even when entire wards were hit by typhus and cholera. At the invitation of Empress Elisabeth, she visited the Saxon soldiers in Hungary.\n\nWhen peace was signed in October, they were able to return to Dresden, but Carola resumed her hospital work during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870/1871 and even hosted 20 soldiers, including prisoners of war, at their home in Strehlen. One of these prisoners of war grew a special rose after his return home, which he named ‘Reine de Saxe‘ or Queen of Saxony, in her honour.\n\nAfter the victory of the North German Confederation and its allies over France, King John conferred the Order of Sidonia on Carola on 15 March 1871 in recognition of her charitable services during the war; in addition, she was named the 499th Dame of the Royal Order of Queen Marie Louise.\n\nCompassionate Queen of Saxony\n\nCarola and Albert had a hunting lodge built in Rehefeld and were much loved in the village. Carola often went for walks in the village without any security and without even a lady-in-waiting. During these walks, Carola learned that the village had neither a chapel nor a cemetery, forcing the locals to use the cemetery of a village an hour away. Carola donated a cemetery and chapel to them, so that their loved ones could stay there.\n\nOn 29 October 1873, Carola’s father-in-law died and she and Albert succeeded as King and Queen of Saxony. Already known for her charitable work, Carola devoted most of her time to improving living conditions in Saxony. She founded several women’s associations and support for the poor. She founded schools for girls and women and provided them with sewing machines and sewing lessons.\n\nOn 29 May 1884, the deposed Swedish branch of the House of Holstein-Gottorp made peace with the new Swedish dynasty of Bernadotte through Carola and her first cousin, the Swedish Crown Princess Victoria (née Princess of Baden), and the remains of Carola’s grandfather, King Gustav IV Adolf, her father, Prince Gustav of Vasa, and her infant brother, Prince Louis, were brought to Stockholm and interred in the royal crypt of the Riddarholmen church.\n\nMeeting Maria Larisch\n\nAs they grew older, Carola and Albert began to travel to warmer climates for their health. In the autumn of 1881, Carola fell ill with typhus and recovered in Menton. Countess Maria Larisch von Moennich (niece of Empress Elisabeth of Austria) met them there and wrote: ‘They were very kind to me and insisted that I go with them every afternoon, and on Sundays I always went to Mass with them. I used to call the King ‘Uncle’ and the Queen ‘Tante’. They were dear souls, who could be mistaken for a simple professor and his wife when they went out, because they did not look like royalty at all‘.\n\nThe Crown Prince and his wife Louise of Austria\n\nAs there was no heir to the throne, it became clear that one day the throne would pass to Albert’s brother George and his son Frederick Augustus. In 1891, Frederick Augustus married Archduchess Louise of Austria. George’s wife, the Infanta Marie Anne of Portugal, had died in 1884 and so Louise immediately became the country’s second lady.\n\nLouise wrote of Carola: ‘Queen Carola was an excellent and charitable woman, who occupied herself with good deeds […] She was remarkably beautiful, but somewhat shy and reserved‘. When Louise gave birth to her first-born son in 1893 after a long and awful labour, Carola repeatedly came to visit her and kept saying, “Poor dear! Poor dear!” However, Albert and Carola soon clashed with Louise after she changed the setting of an emerald parure. The two also disapproved of Louise’s cycling lessons, and Carola told her: ‘You seem to ignore etiquette; remember that I am the Queen and it is your duty to consult me in everything you do’.\n\nDeath of Albert of Saxony, the only man loved\n\nIn May 1902, Albert and Carola travelled to Sibyllenort, but it soon became clear that Albert was seriously ill. Carola took care of her husband in his last weeks and on 18 June they celebrated their 49th wedding anniversary. He gave her a large bouquet of roses and thanked her for the years they had spent together. The following day, around 8pm, Albert died at the age of 74.\n\nLouise arrived the next morning and later wrote: ‘We were led to the bedroom of the late king, where the widow remained with her beloved dead. King Albert lay on the bed, beautiful and calm, and his hands were crossed over the fine linen sheets, sprinkled with red roses, which covered him. Queen Carola knelt on a prie-Dieu at the foot of the bed, where two candles were burning, and as I looked at those silent figures, a great wave of sadness came over me and my heart overflowed with pity for the mourner. I did not say much to her, for I could see that she wished to be left alone, so I merely kissed her in solidarity and left the room as quietly as I had entered’.\n\nThe funeral took place on 23 June in Dresden. Attached to Carola’s wreath was a note that read: ‘The only man loved‘. Carola outlived her husband by five years.\n\nLater years and Death\n\nThe inconsolable widow spent most of her time in solitary confinement in Strehlen, wearing mostly woollen clothes and a simple bonnet. Her only jewellery was a brooch with the image of her husband.\n\nCarola had begun to suffer from diabetes in old age and, after a walk in the park on 11 December 1907, her health suddenly and rapidly deteriorated. She came down with a high fever and chills. The doctor diagnosed kidney and bladder disease, which soon became life-threatening. She received the last sacraments from her confessor. The family began to gather around her as she lost consciousness. On 15 December 1907, at 3.37 am, Carola fell asleep and never woke up again.\n\nA newspaper wrote in her honour: ‘Her tears were for human misery in all its forms. She had a real passion: to give, to comfort, to help and to do good. Every year she donated hundreds of thousands of marks. […] Above all, she gave from the heart and with a wise and considered understanding of the individual case‘.\n\nHer body was laid to rest under the palm trees in the winter garden of her villa in Strehlen. Thousands of people came to pay their respects. On 17 December she was transferred to Dresden Cathedral to be laid to rest beside her husband.\n\nEnd of the Kingdom of Saxony"
