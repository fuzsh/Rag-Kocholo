        "text": "Princess Marie Caroline of Wurttemberg (born Princess Marie Caroline of Bavaria on 23 June 1969) is a member of the Wurttemberg Royal Family as the wife of Prince Albrecht of Wurttemberg. She is also a member of the Bavarian Royal Family as the second daughter of Max, Crown Prince of Bavaria and Countess Elisabeth Douglas.\n\nLife[]\n\nOn 1 August 2015 her uncle, King Franz, announced changes to Wittelsbach house law that would allow his brother Max's daughters to follow him in the line of succession. Marie Caroline's older sister, Sophie, Hereditary Princess of Liechtenstein, and her children were excluded from the succession. Therefore, Marie Caroline is expected to follow her father as the first Queen regnant of Bavaria.\n\nIn November 2022, it was announced that Marie Caroline and her family would relocate from Wurttemberg to Bavaria in order to support her parents, the Crown Prince and Crown Princess, and her uncle, the King. This move is expected to take place in the summer of 2023.\n\nMarriage and Issue[]\n\nOn 4 February 1991, Marie Caroline's engagement to Prince Albrecht of Wurttemberg was announced. The couple were married in Munich on 27 July 1991. Albrecht and Marie Caroline have four children, Sophie, Pauline, Carl Theodor, and Anna.\n\nResidences[]\n\nSartorial Information[]\n\nTiara Collection[]\n\nClothing Collection[]\n\nTitles and Honours[]\n\n1969-1991 Princess Marie Caroline of Bavaria\n\n1991-present Princess Marie Caroline of Wurttemberg\n\nNational Honours[]\n\nFriedrich Order (1991)\n\nOrder of Olga (2001)\n\nForeign Honours[]\n\nOrder of St. George (1987) (Bavaria)\n\nOrder of St. Elizabeth (1991) (Bavaria)\n\nAncestry[]\n\nLines of Succession[]"
