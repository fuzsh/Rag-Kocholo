        "text": "The Armistice ending World War I was agreed upon at 5:00 a.m. on November 11, 1918, to come into effect at 11:00 a.m. Paris time (noon German time), for which reason the occasion is sometimes referred to as “the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month”.\n\nThe German Empire consisted of 26 states, each with their own nobility, four constituent kingdoms, six grand duchies, five duchies (six before 1876), seven principalities, three free Hanseatic cities, and one imperial territory. While Prussia was one of four kingdoms in the realm, it contained about two-thirds of Empire’s population and territory, and Prussian dominance had also been constitutionally established, since the King of Prussia was also the German Emperor (German: Kaiser)\n\nIn this post I will give a brief summary of the abdications of the German monarchs at the end of the war. Today I will mention the four kingdoms and 6 grand duchess that made up the German Empire. On November 28th, the anniversary of the abolition of the monarchy, I will summarize the abdication of the 5 Duchies and 7 Principalities that constituted the empire.\n\nKingdoms\n\nGerman Emperor and King of Prussia\n\nAs the war was nearing its end Wilhelm II’s hope of retaining at least one of his crowns,, that of the Kingdom of Prussia, was revealed as unrealistic when, in the hope of preserving the monarchy in the face of growing revolutionary unrest, Chancellor Prince Max of Baden announced Wilhelm’s abdication of both titles on November 9, 1918.\n\nWilhelm consented to the abdication only after Ludendorff’s replacement, General Wilhelm Groener, had informed him that the officers and men of the army would march back in good order under Hindenburg’s command, but would certainly not fight for Wilhelm’s throne. The monarchy’s last and strongest support had been broken, and finally even Hindenburg, himself a lifelong monarchist, was obliged, after polling his generals, to advise the Emperor to give up the crown. On November 10, Wilhelm crossed the border by train and went into exile in the Netherlands.\n\nKingdom of Bavaria\n\nOn November 2, 1918, an extensive constitutional reform was established by an agreement between the royal government and all parliamentary groups, which, among other things, envisaged the introduction of proportional representation. Ludwig III, approved on the same day the transformation of the constitutional into a parliamentary monarchy. On November 7, 1918, Ludwig III fled from the Residenz Palace in Munich with his family and took up residence in Schloss Anif, near Salzburg, for what he hoped would be a temporary stay. He was the first of the monarchs in the German Empire to be deposed. The next day, the People’s State of Bavaria was proclaimed. This effectively dethroned the Wittelsbachs and ended the family’s 738-year rule over Bavaria.\n\nKingdom of Württemberg\n\nKing Wilhelm II of Württemberg finally abdicated on November 30, 1918, ending over 800 years of Württemberg rule. He died in 1921 at Bebenhausen. King Wilhelm II was also the last German ruler to abdicate in the wake of the November Revolution of 1918.\n\nKingdom of Saxony\n\nFriedrich August III was a member of the House of Wettin, and the last King of Saxony (1904–1918). Though well-loved by his subjects, he voluntarily abdicated as king on November 13, 1918, after the defeat of the German Empire in World War I. He died in Sibyllenort (now Szczodre) in Lower Silesia and was buried in Dresden.\n\nWhen the German Republic was proclaimed in 1918, he was asked by telephone whether he would abdicate willingly. He said: “Oh, well, I suppose I’d better.”\n\nUpon abdicating, he is supposed to have said “Nu da machd doch eiern Drägg alleene!” (Saxon for “Well then take care of this crap yourselves!”), but there is no documentation of this.\n\nWhen cheered by a crowd in a railroad station several years after his abdication, he stuck his head out of the train’s window and shouted “Ihr seid mer ja scheene Demogradn!” (Saxon for “You’re a fine lot of republicans, I’ll say!”).\n\nGrand Duchies\n\nGrand Duchy of Hesse and by Rhine\n\nDuring World War I, Grand Duke Ernst Ludwig of Hesse and by Rhine served as an officer at German Emperor Wilhelm II’s headquarters. In February, 1917, the February Revolution in Russia forced his brother-in-law, Emperor Nicholas II, to abdicate. Sixteen months later, in July 1918, his two sisters in Russia, Elizabeth, the widow of Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich, and Alexandra, the wife of Nicholas II, were murdered by the Bolsheviks, Alexandra dying alongside her husband and children. At the end of the war, Grand Duke Ernst Ludwig lost his throne during the revolution of 1918, after refusing to abdicate.\n\nGrand Duchies of Mecklenburg-Strelitz and Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n\nFollowing the 1918 suicide of Grand Duke Adolph Friedrich VI of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Grand Duke Friedrich Franz IV of Mecklenburg-Schwerin took up the regency of Strelitz. This happened because the heir presumptive Duke Charles Michael was serving in the Russian Army at the time and had indicated that he wished to renounce his succession rights. Friedrich Franz IV abdicated the grand ducal throne on November 14, 1918 following the German Empire’s defeat in World War I; the Strelitz regency ended at the same time.\n\nGrand Duchy of Baden\n\nGrand Duke Friedrich II of Baden was the last sovereign Grand Duke of Baden, reigning from 1907 until the abolition of the German monarchies in 1918. He abdicated on November 22, 1918, amidst the tumults of the German Revolution of 1918–19 which resulted in the abolition of the Grand Duchy.\n\nFollowing the death of his uncle Grand Duke Friedrich I of Baden in 1907, Margrave Maximilian (Max of Baden) became heir to the grand-ducal throne of his cousin Friedrich II, whose marriage remained childless.\n\nin October and November 1918 Maximilian briefly served as the last Chancellor of the German Empire and Minister-President of Prussia. He sued for peace on Germany’s behalf at the end of World War I based on U.S. President Woodrow Wilson’s Fourteen Points, which included immediately transforming the government into a parliamentary system, by handing over the office of chancellor to SPD Chairman Friedrich Ebert and unilaterally proclaiming the abdication of Emperor Wilhelm II. Both events took place on November 9, 1918, the beginning of the Weimar Republic.\n\nGrand Duchy of Saxe-Wiemar-Eisenach\n\nIn 1901 Charles Alexander was succeeded by his grandson Wilhelm Ernst. In 1903, the Grand Duchy officially changed its name to Grand Duchy of Saxony. However, many people continued to call it Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, to avoid confusion with the neighbouring Kingdom of Saxony.\n\nWilhelm Ernst abdicated the throne on November 9, 1918, thereby ending the monarchy in the state. It continued as the Free State of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, until 1920, when it merged with most of its neighbours to form Thuringia, with Weimar as the state capital.\n\nGrand Duchy of Oldenburg\n\nFriedrich August III began his reign on June 13, 1900, when his father, Grand Duke Peter II, died. His reign came to an end on November 11, 1918, shortly before the German monarchy was formally abolished on November 28, 1918.\n\nFriedrich August and his family took up residence at Rastede Castle, where he took up farming and local industrial interests. A year after his abdication, he asked the Oldenburg Diet for a yearly allowance of 150,000 marks, stating that his financial condition was “extremely precarious.”\n\nFriedrich-August II (May 18, 1797 in Dresden – August 1854 in Brennbüchel, Karrösten, Tyrol) was King of Saxony and a member of the House of Wettin.\n\nFriedrich-August II, King of Saxony.\n\nFamily\n\nHe was the son of Hereditary Prince Maximilian of Saxony (1759-1838) was a German prince and a member of the House of Wettin. He was the sixth but third and youngest surviving son of Friedrich-Christian, Elector of Saxony (1722-1763)and the composer Princess Maria-Antonia of Bavaria (1724-1780)\n\nFriedrich-August II’s paternal grandmother was Princess Maria-Antonia of Bavaria who was born at Nymphenburg Palace in Munich to Elector Charles-Albert of Bavaria, later Emperor Charles VII, (1697-1745) and Archduchess Maria-Amalia of Austria (1701-1756). Throughout her life she received an outstanding education, particularly in the arts (including painting, writing poetry, as well as music).\n\nMaximilian, Hereditary Prince of Saxony\n\nThe mother of Friedrich-August II was Princess Carolina of Bourbon-Parma (1770-1804) the eldest of nine children born to Ferdinand, Duke of Parma (1751-1802) by his wife Archduchess Maria-Amalia of Austria (1746-1804).\n\nPrincess Carolina of Bourbon-Parma Parma\n\nPrincess Carolina of Bourbon-Parma’s full baptismal name was Carolina Maria Teresa Giuseppa. She was named after her godparents, her paternal great-uncle King Carlos III of Spain and her maternal grandmother Empress Maria-Theresa.\n\nFriedrich-August’s maternal grandmother was Archduchess Maria-Amalia of Austria was a daughter of Empress Maria-Theresa and Emperor Franz I. She was thus younger sister to Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor and older sister to Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor, Maria-Carolina, Queen of Naples and Marie-Antoinette, Queen of France.\n\nArchduchess Maria-Amalia of Austria\n\nOne of the siblings of Friedrich-August II was Maria-Josepha- Amalia of Saxony, Queen Consort of Spain. She died May 18, 1829 and her life will be reviewed next.\n\nMarch to the Throne\n\nFrom his birth, it was clear that one day Friedrich-August would become the ruler of Saxony. His father was the only son of the Elector Friedrich-Christian of Saxony who left surviving male issue. His uncle was King Friedrich-August I of Saxony (1750-1827) who reigned also reigned as Elector Friedrich-August III of Saxony from 1763 to 1806 and as King of Saxony from 1806 to 1827. He also served as Duke of Warsaw from 1807 to 1813.\n\nElector Friedrich-Christian of Saxony\n\nBefore 1806, Saxony was an Electorate as part of the Holy Roman Empire, a thousand-year-old entity that had become highly decentralised over the centuries. The rulers of the Electorate of Saxony of the House of Wettin had held the title of elector for several centuries. When the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved in August 1806 following the defeat of Emperor FranzII by Napoleon at the Battle of Austerlitz, the electorate was raised to the status of an independent kingdom with the support of the First French Empire, then the dominant power in Central Europe. The last elector of Saxony became King Friedrich-August I.\n\nKing Friedrich-August I-III, Elector and King of Saxony\n\nKing Friedrich-August I of Saxony married the Countess Palatine Amalie of Zweibrücken-Birkenfeld, the daughter of Count Palatine Frederick Michael of Palatinate-Zweibrücken-Birkenfeld-Bischweiler and his wife, Countess Palatine Maria Francisca of Palatinate-Sulzbach and sister of King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria.\n\nDuring their marriage, Amalia gave birth to four children, but only one daughter survived to adulthood: Princess Maria-Augusta of Saxony (1782-1863. Though she never married Her family had a claim to the throne of Poland (Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth) and the Constitution of May 3, 1791 named her as a potential successor to the Polish throne if the male line of the Wettin family were to end.\n\nKing Friedrich-August I died in 1827 and his brother Anton succeeded him as King. Friedrich-August then became second in line to the throne, preceded only by his father Maximilian.\n\nFriedrich-August was an officer in the War of the Sixth Coalition. However, he had little interest in military affairs.\n\nMarriages\n\nIn Vienna on September 26, 1819 (by proxy) and again in Dresden on October 7, 1819 (in person), Friedrich-August married firstly the Archduchess Maria-Caroline of Austria (1801-1832), a daughter of Franz II, Holy Roman Emperor, later Emperor Franz I of Austria after the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, and Maria-Teresa of the Two Sicilies, and was named after an elder sister who had died in infancy. She belonged to the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. She was educated strictly, standing out in drawing, as proven by several sketches and crayons preserved in Austria.\n\nArchduchess Maria-Caroline of Austria\n\nThe marriage was childless and unhappy. Marie-Caroline was sweet and pleasant, but she suffered from epilepsy and her attacks were so frequent that she was barely able to fulfill her duties as Crown Princess; they also seriously affected her marital relationship. Friedrich-August was unfaithful on several occasions. From one of these affairs he had an illegitimate son, the musician Theodor Uhlig (1822–1853). The long-suffering Maria Carolina died from an epileptic attack on May 22, 1832 at Pillnitz Castle near Dresden.\n\nIn Dresden on April 24, 1833 Friedrich-August married secondly Princess Maria-Anna of Bavaria (1805–1877), daughter of the King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria, and his second wife Caroline of Baden. There were no children from the marriage.\n\nPrincess Maria-Anna of Bavaria\n\nPrincess Sophie of Bavaria, Princess Maria-Anna‘s twin sister.\n\nPrincess Maria-Anna She the identical twin sister of Princess Sophie of Bavaria, mother of Emperor Franz-Joseph I of Austria and Emperor Maximilian I of Mexico. King Maximilian I Joseph of Bavaria and his wife had two sets of twins.\n\nFriedrich-August’s brother, Prince Johann of Saxony, was married to Princess Maria-Anna of Bavaria’s sister, Princess Amalie-Auguste of Bavaria (1801-1877).\n\nPrincess Amalie-Auguste of Bavaria\n\nCo-Regent of the Kingdom of Saxony\n\nThe July Revolution of 1830 in France marked the beginning of disturbances in Saxony that autumn. The people claimed a change in the constitution and demanded a young regent of the kingdom to share the government with the King Anton. On September 1, Hereditary Prince Maximilian renounced his rights of succession in favor of his son Friedrich-August, who was proclaimed Prince Co-Regent of Saxony. On February 2, 1832 Friedrich-August brought Free Autonomy to the cities. Also, by an edict of March of 17, that year, the farmers were freed from the corvée and hereditary submission.\n\nKing of Saxony\n\nOn June 6, 1836, King Anton died and Friedrich-August succeeded him. As an intelligent man, he was quickly popular with the people as he had been since the time of his regency. The new king solved political questions only from a pure sense of duty. Mostly he preferred to leave these things on the hands of his ministers.\n\nA standardized jurisdiction for Saxony created the Criminal Code of 1836. During the Revolutionary disturbances of 1848 (March Revolution), he appointed liberal ministers in the government, lifted censorship, and remitted a liberal electoral law. Later his attitude changed. On April 28, Friedrich-August II dissolved the Parliament. In 1849, King Friedrich-August II was forced to flee to the Königstein Fortress during the May Uprising which was crushed by Saxon and Prussian troops and Friedrich-August II was able to return after only a few days.\n\nJourney through England and Scotland\n\nIn 1844 Friedrich-August II accompanied by his personal physician Carl-Gustaf Carus, made an informal (incognito) visit to England and Scotland. Among places they visited were Lyme Regis where he purchased from the local fossil collector and dealer, Mary Anning, an ichthyosaur skeleton for his own extensive natural history collection. It was not a state visit, but the King was the guest of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert at Windsor Castle, visited many of the sights in London and in the university cities of Oxford and Cambridge, and toured widely in England, Wales and Scotland.\n\nQueen Victoria of the United Kingdom and Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha\n\nAccidental Death\n\nDuring a journey in Tyrol, he had an accident in Brennbüchel in which he fell in front of a horse that stepped on his head. On August 8, 1854, he died in the Gasthof Neuner. He was buried on August 16, in the Katholische Hofkirche of Dresden. In his memory, the Dowager Queen Maria arranged to establish the Königskapelle (King’s Chapel) at the accident place, which was consecrated one year later, some of the last members of the Saxon royal family, including Maria-Emanuel, Margrave of Meissen (1926-2012) who was the head of the Royal House of Saxony are buried beside the chapel.\n\nWithout legitimate issue, after his death Friedrich-August II was succeeded by his younger brother, Johann."
