        "text": "Poetry in Translation\n\nfrom Europe and beyond, including our Visible Poets, Arc Translations, Arc Classic Translations, New Voices From Europe and Beyond and Anthologies in Translation series. At Arc Publications, we believe that the importance of translated poetry cannot be overestimated. Reading the poetry of other cultures, countries and backgrounds helps us to understand other points of view. It also gives us an insight into other poetic traditions and allows us to hear unfamiliar voices. Translations of poetry must be poetic translations if they are to help their readers gain understanding, insight, and pleasure from new and exciting work, so we are careful to accept only those translations we consider outstanding.\n\nShowing 1 - 10 of 155 results\n\nPedro Serrano\n\nThe Conjurer\n\nThe Conjurer is Pedro Serrano’s second book from Arc, and includes work drawn from his three published collections in Mexico as well as unpublished work.

The poems in this short selection are full of longing, sadness, loss and, in the final poem, anger, as the poet remembers the devastating chemical attack on Halabja in 1988 in which his ‘country’s hair turned white’.\n\nPaperback forthcoming\n\n» More details...\n\nRo Mehrooz\n\nPoems Written Through Barbed-wire Fences\n\nThis chapbook by Ro Mehrooz is the first time that the work of a single Rohingyan poet has appeared in print in a bilingual edition. The Rohingya people continue to experience genocide at the hands of the Myanmar military, so it is not surprising that Ro’s poems are full of anger, anguish and despair, although there are moments of light as he reflects upon the traditions and customs of his people.\n\nChapbook forthcoming\n\n» More details...\n\nLucija Stupica\n\nVanishing Points\n\nTBC..\n\nPaperback forthcoming\n\n» More details...\n\nVirgil\n\nDreaming of an Ancient Country: Passages from Virgil's Georgics\n\nVirgil wrote The Georgics in the 30s BCE at a time of political uncertainty in the Roman state and although country matters are to the fore in the selections chosen and translated in this chapbook, there is also from time to time an underlying sense of unease. The passages from Books 1, 2 and 3 deal with farming and animal husbandry and, from Book 4, with bee-keeping. The chapbook ends with the concluding passage of Book 4, Virgil’s beautiful telling of the story of Orpheus and Euridice. This translation from the Latin by the poet Fred Beake makes for very entertaining reading.\n\nChapbook forthcoming\n\n» More details...\n\nAneta Kaminska\n\nCzernovitz - Charmovitz\n\nAneta KamiÅska is a Polish poet, author of\n\neight volumes of poetry.
