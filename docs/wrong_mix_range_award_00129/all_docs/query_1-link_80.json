The Prize was awarded for her body of work, including the 1891 novel, To the Story of Gosta Berling, and the 1902 two-volume work of fiction Jerusalem, the chronicle of Swedish peasants who migrate to Jerusalem. Selma became the preeminent Swedish writer of her day and produced an impressive body of work—33 novels and four biographical narratives. Shero Selma wasn’t content to merely be the most brilliant novelist of her age, however; she also worked extremely hard at obtaining the release of Jewish writer Nelly Sachs from a Nazi concentration camp. Sachs, inspired by her savior, won the Nobel Prize for Literature herself in 1966."
