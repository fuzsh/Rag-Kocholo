        "text": "Each year, thousands of members of academies, university professors, scientists, previous Nobel Prize laureates and members of parliamentary assemblies and others, are asked to submit candidates for the Nobel Prizes for the coming year. These nominators are chosen in such a way that as many countries and universities as possible are represented over time.\n\nAfter receiving all nominations, the Nobel Committees of the four prize awarding institutions are responsible for the selection of the candidates.\n\nMore about the Nobel Prize awarding institutions\n\nRead the article\n\nThe Nobel Peace Prize has frequently caused controversy. One reason is that many laureates have been contemporary and highly controversial political actors, another is that the Prizes in many instances, have increased public focus on international or national conflicts. In the latter case, the awards have often been seen by local authorities as “interference” in national matters. On some occasions there has even been strong criticism against the Norwegian Nobel Committee itself and the way its members are selected."
