        "text": "Category Archives: Nobel Prize Literature\n\nNobel Prize Laureate: Annie Ernaux\n\nAs a fan of Annie Ernaux I was delighted to read that she was the 2022 Nobel Prize Laureate for literature.\n\nThe Swedish Committee selected Annie Ernaux for the Nobel Prize for the courage and clinical acuity with which she uncovers the roots, estrangements and collective restraints of personal memory\n\nAmong her novels are ‘A Man’s Place’, ‘A Woman’s Story’ and ‘Years’.\n\nErnaux’s work is uncompromising and written in plain language, scraped clean. And when she with great courage and clinical acuity reveals the agony of the experience of class, describing shame, humiliation, jealousy or inability to see who you are, she has achieved something admirable and enduring.\n\nIn her Nobel Lecture Ernaux said:\n\nWriting in a democratic country, however, I continue to wonder about the place women occupy in the literary field. They have not yet gained legitimacy as producers of written works. There are men in the world, including the Western intellectual spheres, for whom books written by women simply do not exist; they never cite them. The recognition of my work by the Swedish Academy is a sign of hope for all female writers.\n\nTo read her entire lecture click here.\n\nI am always excited when a new book of hers is out on the market. Her latest book Getting Lost, is the diary she kept while she was having an affair with a married Soviet diplomat and which she wrote about in her biography/memoir Simple Passion.\n\nAnnie Ernaux writes beautifully about passion, love, pain, mourning and shame.\n\nFor more on her and her books click here.\n\nNobel Prize Laureate: Louise Glück\n\nBorn in 1943 in New York, Louise Glück who lives in Massachusetts and is also a professor of English at Yale University, is this years recipient of the Nobel Prize for literature.\n\nGlück was recognised for “her unmistakable poetic voice, that with austere beauty makes individual existence universal” said the Swedish Academy, which oversees the award.\n\nHer poetry focuses on the painful reality of being human and pens down poems around themes such as death, childhood, and family life. (Nithya Nair)\n\nA former U.S. poet laureate, Glück had already received virtually every honour possible for a poet, including the Pulitzer Prize in 1993 for “The Wild Iris”\n\nThe book is a collection of 54 poems on the subject of gardening in which Louise Glück gives the flowers voices as they pass though their different stages. She also writes about the person tending the garden and the Almighty supervisor.\n\nThe Wild Iris\n\nAt the end of my suffering\n\nthere was a door.\n\nHear me out: that which you call death\n\nI remember.\n\nOverhead, noises, branches of the pine shifting.\n\nThen nothing. The weak sun\n\nflickered over the dry surface.\n\nIt is terrible to survive\n\nas consciousness\n\nburied in the dark earth.\n\nThen it was over: that which you fear, being\n\na soul and unable\n\nto speak, ending abruptly, the stiff earth\n\nbending a little. And what I took to be\n\nbirds darting in low shrubs.\n\nYou who do not remember\n\npassage from the other world\n\nI tell you I could speak again: whatever\n\nreturns from oblivion returns\n\nto find a voice:\n\nfrom the center of my life came\n\na great fountain, deep blue\n\nshadows on azure seawater.\n\nFor a writer, Louise Gluck’s poetry is an example of the efficacy of writing.\n\nIn an article for the Atlantic titled The Many Beginnings of Louise Glück , Walt Hunter cites the openings of two poems and clearly explains why these lines are perfect:\n\n“Illuminations,” a poem about a child learning language by looking outside at the snow-covered world, starts with the line\n\nMy son squats in the snow in his blue snowsuit.\n\nAnother poem, “Happiness,” begins\n\nA man and woman lie on a white bed.\n\nThese two images are remarkable not for their strangeness or novelty, but rather for their ordinariness and familiarity, and for their emergence from a kind of psychological family album. These single lines feel impossible to edit or to make more precise: Each has a figure (child, couple), an orientation (squatting, lying down), a place (snow, bed), and a single color (white bed, blue snowsuit). The simplicity of these images suggest exquisite craft and revision.\n\nBecause of the pandemic the Nobel Prize ceremony, normally held in Sweden in December, will be held in 2021.\n\nFor more information on Female Nobel Prize Laureates visit my series\n\nHERE\n\nNobel Prize Laureate: Olga Tokarczuk\n\nOlga Tokarczuk is the recipient of the 2018-2019 Nobel Prize for Literature. Although this prize is awarded to Olga Tokarczuk in 2019, she is actually the 2018 nomination. The prize was held over because of sexual abuse and financial scandals which led to a series of resignations in the Swedish Academy. She is the fifteenth and second Polish writer to win this prestigious prize.\n\nMs. Tokarczuk is no stranger to receiving prizes for her literary works. In 2008 her novel Flights won the Nike award, Poland’s top literary award. In 2018 Flights took the Man Booker Prize for its translation into English by Jennifer Croft.\n\nTokarczuk’s work focuses on peace, democracy and activism. In an interview with Claire Armitstead in The Guardian, Tokarczuk had this to say about a two-year book deal on detective stories:\n\nBut just writing a book to know who is the killer is wasting paper and time, so I decided to put into it animal rights and a story of dissenting citizens who realise that the law is immoral and see how far can they can go with saying no to it.”\n\nIn a fascinating interview with Adam Smith – Chief Scientific Officer of Nobel Media – Olga Tokarczuk speaks of the 2018 Nobel Prize in Literature as a symbol of hope for those worried about the ‘Crisis in democracy’ she sees facing central Europe.\n\nFor more on Female Nobel Laureates for Literature please visit my series.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nNobel Prize Laureate: Svetlana Alexievich\n\nSvetlana Alexievich wins the 2015 Nobel Prize in Literature.\n\nAn investigative journalist from Belarus, Alexievich is the 14th woman to win this prestigious prize and the first female Russian writer to do so.\n\nWhat is unusual about her winning the prize for literature is that her writing is non-fiction.\n\nLiterature is just a fancy word for writing says Philip Gourevitch in his The NewYorker article titled Non Fiction Deserves a Nobel.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nNobel Prize Laureates: Who is Next?\n\nFourteen women have so far won the Nobel Prize for Literature.

You can click here for a comprehensive description of The Wonderful Adventures of Nils, written by Elysa Faith Ng, an eleven year old child.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nNobel Prize Laureate: Toni Morrison\n\nToni Morrison’s first novel,The Bluest Eye was her effort to depict racial self-loathing and to question the standards of beauty in America.\n\nIn an afterword of the 1999 edition of The Bluest Eye Morrison states that “…even the casual racial contempt can cause devastation.”\n\nAward winning editor and writer Dorothy Allison wrote of Morrison’s talent in handling the narrator, Claudia, of The Bluest Eye:\n\n“It was the storyteller, Claudia, who looked at the world with unflinching honesty, the beauty, and the ugliness alike. I understood her the way she raked her own soul, holding herself responsible for sins she should never have thought hers.”\n\nContinue reading →\n\nNobel Prize Laureate: Nelly Sachs\n\nIn the unimaginable aftershock of the Second World War the German philosopher Theodor W. Adorno made the famous statement, ‘To write poetry after Auschwitz is impossible.’ It was Nelly Sachs, more than anyone else, who showed that it was not only possible, it was necessary.\n\nChild\n\nChild\n\nWith the burial of your head\n\nseed capsule of dreams\n\ngrown heavy\n\nwith endless resignation\n\nready now to sow in another country.\n\nWith eyes\n\nturned round to mother earth –\n\n– Child\n\nThe Berlin-born Jewish poet (1891-1970) was arrested and interrogated by the Gestapo in 1938, and in 1940, after being summoned to report to a “work camp,” she narrowly escaped to the neutral country of Sweden with her mother. Throughout the war they lived in poverty, occupying a one-room apartment in Stockholm. Sachs penned poetry that bears witness to the Holocaust and the tragedy of the Jewish people with words that were also universal, symbolic of the suffering and redemption of all humanity.\n\nOn the day of her seventy-fifth birthday, Nelly Sachs was awarded the 1966 Nobel Prize in Literature. She gave the money away, half of it to the needy, half to the friend who had arranged to get her out of Germany in 1940.\n\nAt her Nobel reception, Ingvar Andersson of the Swedish Academy made the following comments to her:\n\nContinue reading →\n\nNobel Prize Laureate: Pearl S. Buck\n\nAlthough Pearl S. Buck was born in America, she spent the first forty years of her life living in China.\n\nHer novel The Good Earth, which was instrumental in her winning the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1938, was chosen as an Oprah book club selection.\n\nReading Pearl Buck’s writing feels like reading poetry to me. I just love the quiet rhythm of the words. They evoke the simple beauty of the characters and the harsh mystery of China’s ancient culture. —Oprah\n\nContinue reading →"
