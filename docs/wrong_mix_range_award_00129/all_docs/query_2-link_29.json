        "text": "Academia in Israel\n\nIn recent years, attention has been drawn to the persistent gender inequality in Israeli academia. Although some positive change occurred in the position of women faculty in Israeli academia during the 1990s, questions remain about why there are so few faculty members and why progress has been so slow.\n\nChava Alberstein\n\nChava Alberstein is a singer-songwriter who by the end of 2020 had recorded over 60 albums (including eight albums in Yiddish but not including singles and song collections), more than any other Israeli singer. Alberstein has toured globally and is considered one of the most important female performers of Hebrew music, Yiddish folk songs, and children’s songs.\n\nHedva Almog\n\nAs commanding officer of the Israeli Army’s Women’s Corps, Hedva Almog created training programs and promotion opportunities for female officers, working to create a better environment for women in the army. After her lengthy service in the army, she became a politician, serving on Haifa’s City Council and as deputy mayor.\n\nAmerican Jewish Congress\n\nThe American Jewish Congress (AJCongress) advocates for Jewish interests in the United States and abroad. Women have played an important part in AJCongress since the organization was first established after World War I.\n\nLynn Amowitz\n\nAfter years of offering medical help to refugees, Lynn Amowitz decided she needed to solve the problems at their source: the human rights violations driving refugees from their homes.\n\nAnglo-Jewish Writers in the Twentieth and Twenty-First Centuries\n\nAnglo-Jewish women writers have been active creators within the British literary arena since the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. The 1960s and 1970s saw the emergence of a number of Jewish female voices, although it was not until the 1990s that the works of Jewish women writers began to be recognized as part of the British literary canon. Anglo-Jewish women writers’ multifaceted perspectives are reflected in a literary production characterized by experimentation and fragmentation.\n\nMyriam Anissimov\n\nBorn to parents who were members of the French resistance, Myriam Anissimov worked as an actress and singer before turning to writing. One of the many strengths of her works lies in their outspoken presentation of the sexual and emotional relationship between the sexes from the point of view of the woman. In this respect, Anissimov’s works are intriguing complements to the American Jewish novel of the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nMia Arbatova\n\nTold first by her parents that dancing was immodest and then by Israeli pioneers that dancing was bourgeois, Mia Arbatova defied her critics and became a pioneer of ballet in Israel. Her efforts produced three generations of distinguished dancers and her studio achieved international respect in the world of dance.\n\nEdna Arbel\n\nWhile Edna Arbel was a justice on Israel’s Supreme Court from 2004 to 2014, her career has been influential for decades. She served variously as a District Attorney, a Judge, and as State Prosecutor, and her courageous determination to combat both governmental corruption and rising violence not only placed her in the public limelight but at times also aroused considerable hostility.\n\nArt During the Holocaust\n\nDuring the Holocaust, a number of women were able to create art while in concentration camps. Their works bear witness to their desire to escape the world in which they found themselves, while also revealing how they maintained their humanity and sensitivity despite the appalling conditions in which they lived."
