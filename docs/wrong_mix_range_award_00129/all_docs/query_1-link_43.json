Her career as a poet started only after her emigration, when she was nearly fifty years old. Despite her relatively short writing career and constant struggles with mental illness, Sachs' body of poetry is one of the essential artistic testimonies of the twentieth century. She died in Sweden on May 12, 1970. (Bio via Tavern Books, who published a translation by Michael Hamburger, of GLOWING ENIGMAS, in 2013).\n\n#poetryforgereads #nellysachs #poetryintranslation #peace #makepoemsnotwar #poetrycommunity\".",
