        "text": "Abstract\n\nNelly Sachs, the Swedish poetess who won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1966, was born in Germany and lived in Berlin for the first half of her life. Like many of Jewish descent, it was only after the Nazis came to power that she was surprised to find herself the object of a “purge” and forced to accept a crude and inhuman division of her identity. This genocidal classification brutally tore Jews who had already integrated into the local life from their own past, and the whole process was full of extreme spiritual suffering. In Sachs's poetic drama Eli, she invented a medieval story to allude to the misfortune of Jews, including herself. The poetess was forced into exile from Germany to Sweden. Although she was lucky to be able to save her own life, the spiritual wound never healed. To seek spiritual consolation, she turned to Jewish mysticism. Her works did not directly describe the bloody disaster, but faithfully recorded the process of the poetess's spiritual transformation. Taking the movement of geographical position and the flow of ideology and culture as the object of investigation, Qiao-Yiology has constructed a methodological “avenue” of “binary and three-dimensional” from the constant migration and change of things, and explored the causal process from “Qiao” to“Yi,” thus providing a new way of thinking for scientific research. This paper is a brief attempt to apply the theory of Qiao-Yiology to the field of literary studies,trying to find the artistic spark aroused by the collision of different beliefs in Eli from the perspective of Qiao-Yiology, as well as the interaction between imagination and reality in literary creation, so as to be able to define the extent to which mysticism has influenced the poetess and her works."
