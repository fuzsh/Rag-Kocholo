        "text": "Today’s Google Doodle honors the 127th birthday of German-born Jewish poet Nelly Sachs, whose life and work were profoundly altered by the cataclysmic damage inflicted by the Holocaust.\n\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter\n\nThank you for signing up!\n\nBy clicking submit, you agree to our <a href=\"http://observermedia.com/terms\">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties.

Sachs, who was also a playwright, referred to the metaphors in her work as “wounds,” but she posited that human beings were capable of renewal even in the face of annihilation.\n\nSubscribe to Observer’s Entertainment Newsletter\n\nSachs, who was born into a wealthy family in Berlin and grew up quite sheltered, fled her native country for Sweden in 1940 with the aid of novelist Selma Lagerlof when she and her mother learned that they were being sent to a forced-labour camp.\n\nThe poet’s ability to express herself through writing carried her through bouts of mental illness and terrifying ordeals with the Nazis. Sachs and her mother’s Sweden apartment was once invaded by the Gestapo, who subjected the two women to a terrifying interrogation that frightened Sachs so much she briefly lost the ability to speak.\n\nHer voice, then, was an inspired, reverberating rebuke to those who would silence her. Sachs dealt in subject matter that plumbed the depths of her and her community’s despair, but her language was deeply influenced by German Romanticism; her verse approached the ecstatic. Through her pain, Sachs glimpsed new worlds.\n\nIn honor of her legacy, we look back at three of Sachs’ greatest poems, all of which have stood the test of time and still resonate today.\n\nThe first, “O The Chimneys,” is her most famous work, and also the name of Sachs’s collection of poetry and prose released by Farrar, Straus & Giroux in 1967. It finds Sachs lamenting the genocide of her people, but also the disappearance of any form of true shelter. The Jews, ripped from their homes, were forced to reside in “planned dwellings of death” from which they could never escape.\n\nO Die Schornsteine (O the Chimneys)\n\nO the chimneys\n\nOn the carefully planned dwellings of death\n\nWhen Israel’s body rose dissolved in smoke\n\nThrough the air –\n\nTo be welcomed by a chimney sweep star\n\nTurned black\n\nOr was it a ray of the sun?\n\nO the chimneys!\n\nPaths of freedom for the dust of Jeremiah and Job –\n\nWho dreamed you up and built stone upon stone\n\nThe path of smoke for their flight?\n\nO dwellings of death\n\nSet out so enticingly\n\nFor the host of the house, who used to be the guest –\n\nO you fingers\n\nLaying the stone of the threshold\n\nLike a knife between life and death –\n\nO you chimneys\n\nO you fingers\n\nAnd Israel’s body dissolves in smoke through the air!\n\nSachs, who herself was spared the fate of being gassed and incinerated by Nazis, spent the rest of her life wondering what her unlucky family members and fellow countrymen had experienced. As an artist, she felt that articulating their final moments was her burden to bear. This mission forms the core of “If Only I Knew,” which also was published in the collection O the Chimneys.\n\nWenn ich nur wüßte (If Only I Knew) (translated by Rebekah Wilson)\n\nIf only I knew\n\nwhat the last thing you saw was.\n\nWas it a stone, that had drunk in\n\ncountless last looks, until, in blindness,\n\nthey fell on the blind?\n\nOr was it earth,\n\nenough to fill a shoe,\n\nand already black\n\nfrom so many partings\n\nand causing so much death?\n\nOr was it your final path,\n\nbringing you farewells from all the paths\n\nyou had ever walked?\n\nA puddle, a reflection in metal,\n\nperhaps your enemy’s buckle,\n\nor some other small interpreter\n\nof heaven?\n\nOr did this earth,\n\nwhich lets no one depart from here unloved,\n\nsend you a bird omen through the air,\n\nreminding your soul that it flinched\n\nin its pain-scorched body?\n\nSachs, who died in 1970, wrote the following poem in 1968, and in the language you can discern the ways she repeated herself purposefully throughout her career. The reappearing star imagery that twinkles through her universe of smoke, brick and darkness suggests that her overarching thesis was one of hope.\n\nWenn der Tag leer wird (When the Day Empties Itself)\n\nWhen the day empties itself\n\nin the twilight,\n\nwhen the imageless time begins,\n\nthe lonely voices join together–\n\nthe animals are nothing other than the hunting\n\nor hunted–\n\nthe flowers no more than fragrance–\n\nwhen everything becomes nameless as in the beginning–\n\nyou go under the catacombs of Time,\n\nwhich open for those who are near the end–\n\nthere where the heart buds grow–\n\ninto the dark inwardliness\n\nyou sink downward–\n\nalready past death\n\nwhich is only a windy passageway–\n\nand freezing from going out\n\nyou open your eyes\n\nwhere a new star\n\nhas already left its reflection–\n\nAmidst a resurgence of emboldened neo-Nazi groups and white supremacist sentiment in America, Sachs’s writing feels especially relevant today not only because it serves as a reminder of the past, but because it proposes radical routes to freedom. The might of institutionalized, professionally executed hatred could not take from Sachs what was hers. Let her life be a lesson to all of us."
