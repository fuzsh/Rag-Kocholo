        "text": "Kevin Bacon is one of my most favorite celebrities ever. Obviously, like so many, I first became a fan because of the original Footloose movie in 1984. I just watched it for the umpteenth time just a couple of weekends ago on one of our rainy 2023 summer Saturdays. I also loved him in A Few Good Men, Mystic River, Apollo 13, She’s Having a Baby, The River Wild, and Crazy Stupid Love, to name a few more blockbuster movies. And don’t even get me started on his guest appearances in Will & Grace.\n\nThere’s also Kevin's Boston-based Showtime series, City on the Hill, that started in 2019. He’s been around forever, and because of his prolific career covering a diverse range of genres, every Hollywood actor can be eventually linked to Kevin in six or less people. Kevin himself even jokes about it, and created charitable initiatives with SixDegrees.org that connect people and charities with one another.\n\nSo what is this incredible man doing in Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts? And are you ready for selfies and friendly 'hellos' if you spot him out and about? Well, did I mention Kevin is a singer? He’s not trying to become some big star on that end, but rather sings as a hobby with his brother Michael. The pair enjoy what they call \"Forosoco\", which is a blended sound of folk, rock, soul, and country influences, according to the Bacon Brothers website. They’re touring with their 11th album around the country."
