Introduction Perhaps one of the first lessons one is taught about bacteria is that they constitute the prokaryotic domain of life, while humans and most other readily visible life forms are firmly rooted in the eukaryotic domain. These domains diverged many millions of years ago from a common ancestor and, while the eukaryotic branch later split into eukaryotic and archaeal domains, it maintained its separation from the prokaryotic domain (Woese et al., 1990). Prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes are naturally very distinct in both content and structure as a result of eons long separation, and one tends to classify these domains as very distinct entities. However, there is increasing evidence of so called eukaryotic bacterial genes, or genes present in bacterial genomes that have some sort of eukaryotic origin or function. These eukaryotic bacterial genes are primarily of concern in determining virulence factors of human pathogens. As defined below, bacterial genes can be evolutionarily or functionally eukaryotic, or both. Presence of either type of gene would indicate some interaction between bacteria and eukaryotes, the most oft studied of which are pathogenic interactions. Discovering eukaryotic bacterial genes is particularly important in pathogens that secrete effectors to be taken up by host eukaryotic cells. These effectors tend to modulate host cell functions, so there would be some logic in these effectors being encoded by eukaryotic genes. Most research has been ...

Marlowe And FaustusDamnation In Shakespeare s Death Perhaps the most poignant of these moments is in Act IV during which Faustus has a troubling encounter with a horse courser. Speaking to himself (as well as the audience), Faustus laments, what are thou, Faustus, but a man condemned to die? (4.1, line 127). If the play were to be accepted as Calvinist, Faustus then becomes the worst sort of sinner. As Calvin himself explains in Institutes of Christian Religion, We see therefore that it is no absurdity, that one self act be ascribed to God, to Satan, and to man: but the diversity in the end and manner of doing, causeth that therein appeareth the justice of God to be without fault, and also the wickedness of Satan and man, bewrayeth itself to their reproach (Calvin 207). In the Calvinist mindset, Faustus damnation was first willed by God, then by Satan, and then by himself. Faustus, and his actions in the play, could have acted as a cautionary tale, though a rather dramatic one. However, even if one chooses to view the play as a critic of Calvinism, it remains true that Marlowe s interpretation of the Faust myth is wrought with religious concerns of the time. Was Faustus fate predestined or could he have saved his soul? This question and its difficult answer certainly would have resonated with Elizabethan audiences. Interestingly enough, 21st century America was also navigating a world in which religion and politics cannot be separated from one another. During David Mamet s original production of Faustus, ...

Yet, they are treated cruelly in the poaching industry and research facilities. They have been observed meeting most of the criteria for what we define as human , yet their habitats and wellbeing are being intruded everyday. The belief that all humans have ascribed natural rights that can not be infringed upon by a system of government is a fairly new concept, becoming predominant in the 20th century. However, religious scriptures have made mention of these concepts as early as 5 thousand years ago. It is apparent that though concrete natural rights for persons may be a recent idea in society, civilizations have been attempting to define the rights of personhood for millennia. I use the language persons , intentionally, to exhibit the contrast between this and human . Though the two words have become almost synonymous in modern day language, personhood is not exclusively defined by humanity by definition. We simply have not observed any species that we have unanimously considered worthy of this title. This brings in a moral dilemma, as people wonder what species, if any, should be ascribed personhood along with its rights, and to what extent. I propose that a potential candidate, that will kickstart conversation about the rights of all animals, is the Chimpanzee. A major justification for this is their genetic and behavioral similarity to that of a person. Exhibiting a ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n7. Advantages And Disadvantages Of Athens Democracy Portfolio paper A Democracy is said to work better and have better outcomes, but a Monarchy was said to be the most common use of government. However , monarchy of the new times is not characterized in terms of unlimited political power anymore as it has transformed to a more citizen friendly government. A Monarchy is a political system ruled by one individual who usually increases his role through inheritance. Although the Athens were ruled by a monarchy until the seventh century B.C.E. it had fallen under the control of its aristocrats. They possessed the best land and controlled political and religious life by means of a council of nobles, assisted by a board of nine archons. (Spielvogel 58) Near the end of the seventh century they faced political problems because of economic issues. Many Athenian farmers wounded up being bought into slavery. These farmers weren t able to repay loans their aristocrat neighbors loaned to them, pledging themselves as collateral. Many cried over and over again asking for no debt and to give the land to the poor. This seemed like the start of a civil war. This changed the governmentto a democracy. (Spielvogel 58) Athens had many strengths that contributed to its growth as an economy. For one, It had formed a cohesive polis, an assembly of political, social, or religious events at a central point where everyone gets together. Cyrus the Greatruled the largest Empire of his day.

While teaching gung fu in California, Bruce set to improve by expanding his knowledge of other styles.

The terms of the challenge were if Bruce lost, he would stop teaching non Chinese. Bruce won the fight in three minutes, but was disappointed in himself, for taking so long and being exhausted.

With traditionally, the display of the female body was seen as more mythical such as goddess like. For the typical male viewer, this provided comfort, freedom, and fantasy. Manet changed all this with his painting of The Luncheon on the Grass.

Titanic Buoyancy Essay In the early morning of April 15, 1912, the unthinkable happened. After hitting an iceberg, the RMS Titanic, which was thought to be unsinkable, sank to the bottom of the North Atlantic in over 12,000 feet of water. Of the 2,200 passenger and crew on board the ship, over 1,500 lost their lives. At the time of her maiden voyage, she was considered to be the largest ship afloat in the world. Several physical principles of buoyancy explain why any seaworthy vessel, including the Titanic, was able to float. First, Archimedes Principle states that the buoyant force on an immersed object is equal to the weight of the fluid it displaces. In the case of the Titanic, the buoyant force required to keep it afloat was 588,000,000 Newtons.This is obviously the weight of the Titanic as well ( not the mass ), and the weight of the water displaced.

These compartments actually lead to the ship s demise. When the water began to pour into the ship, the crew sealed each compartment filling up with water. However, these compartments never had a roof section. Therefore, the water could fill the next compartment and the next until the ship sank. The main purpose of these watertight compartments was to isolate parts of the ship, should the ship take on water. However, since the compartments were built without a roof, they were somewhat useless in preventing the vessel from taking on too much water. As the ship began to take on more and more water, the weight of the ship became greater than the weight of the water the ship displaced. In other words, the weight of the ship exceeded the buoyant force, and the ship ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n19.

Her methods proved successful as she continued to developed these ideas and became a well known and highly acclaimed philosopher.

She believed each childshould be motivated to learn new things. She encouraged these ideas through new materials, classrooms, and teaching procedures. The materials she created were didactic, meaning that they were self teaching. Lastly, Maria Montessori believed that while teachers should be observers, they should also be demonstrators and work with every child.

In order for median sized sediment to become entrained, the bed shear stress (П„b) must be greater than the critical shear stress (П„c), or the resistance force of the sediment quantified by the Shields number. The streams ability to transport large clasts can be assessed using the Costa entrainment velocity, and the critical value for the deposition of large clasts (П„b) that may have been mobilized further up stream can be estimated using the O Connor equation. The values assessed can ultimately offer insight into stream power or the energy available for sediment transport and ... Get more on HelpWriting.net ...\n\n33.

The female and child otherness is a prominent issue in the novels, Jane Eyre (1847), and Wide Sargasso Sea (1966), though the stories were fashioned in different periods. There is a depiction of extensively different social, political and societal sceneries. Conversely, regardless of their variances, expositions of youthful, female otherness and aspects as regards selfhood could be associated to the writers predictions of the dangerous female other.

Tennyson s In Memoriam Essay Tennyson s In Memoriam In Memoriam is an elegy to Tennyson s friend Arthur Hallam, but bears the hallmark of its mid nineteenth century context, the locus classicus of the science and religion debate. Upon reflection, Hallam s tragic death has proved to be an event that provoked Tennysons embarkation upon a much more ambitious poetic project than conventional Miltonian elegy, involving meditation upon the profoundest questions faced by mankind. Scientific advancements, most notably in the fields of geology and biology, challenged the beliefs that form the foundation of Christianity: the belief in a beneficent God responsible for creation and ensuing superintendence and the belief in man s immortal soul. By the mid ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... They are Tennyson?s trip through Hades. By personifying Nature and placing ?her? in opposition to God as a distinct power, Tennyson seems to imply a polytheistic belief that two, not one, seats of power exist. In these passages it seems that Tennyson perceives Nature to have greater influence over Earth and mankind. At the close of LV, God appears as distant and hidden in darkness, leaving man in a state analogous with that of a child ? weak, vulnerable and desirous of care: he falls ?upon the great world?s altar stairs That slope thro? darkness up to God,? (lines 14 15). Metaphorically darkness represents the secrecy surrounding God and the answers that he holds, a motif that is reprised at the close of LVI: ?behind the veil, behind the veil.? The repetition of the clause emphasises Tennyson?s frustrations. Indeed God seems so distant and hidden that Tennyson?s faith in his existence is weakened and he is only able to ?feel? and ?faintly trust,? not resolutely know. The lack of conviction conveyed here through Tennyson?s semantic choices illustrates an emergence of disillusion with eutheistic belief. The existence of the Christian conception of a loving god is called into question, and it is implicitly asserted that the conception of Nature conveyed in these passages may be the true, ditheistic, conception of God.

Gartner s 2Q16 forecast shows that 2016 global spending for enterprise software will be $367.5 billion in constant U.S. dollars. Large organizations as well as small startups have been focusing on the enterprise segment. Once consumer only products like iPhone (for business) and Android (for work) are now enterprise ready and widely used for businesses in the large organizations.

It s not surprising that nowadays virtually every enterprise software offers a flavor of cloud or SaaS solution.

Rock n Roll 20th Century Culture Essay Rock n roll and 20th Century Culture According to Philip Ennis, rock n roll emerged from the convergence of social transformations which resulted from World War II (Ryan 927). Despite its pop culture origins, rock music is arguably one of the strongest cultural factors to develop in this century. Artists such as Lennon, McCartney and Dylan defined the emotions of a generation and, in the last decade, it as even been acknowledged by members of the establishment which it hoped to change as a major influence in the country. In order to understand how rock went from a sign of rebellion to a cultural icon, it is necessary to understand where it came from. According to Albert... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... Rock n roll music came of age in the sixties which was a period in the nation s history when a young generation expressed their anguish and sense of alienation to the country s social establishments by searching for new answers to the age old questions concerning the meaning of life, the value of the individual, and the nature of truth and spirituality (Harris 306). The classic rock music which was created during this period gave form and substance to this search. Songs such as My Generation by the Who recorded the keen sense of alienation that young people felt from the past and the Establishment and it also showed the keen sense of community they felt among themselves. Classic albums such as the Beatles White Album, the Who s Who s Next, Dylan s Highway 61 Revisited, and Pink Floyd s Dark Side of the Moon capture what was essential about the time because they were both a result of that time and because they helped to produce it by reinforcing the younger generation s feelings of alienation and separation. Although the distinction is somewhat fuzzy, rock music is not exactly the same as rock and roll. Rock n roll brings up memories of two minute, Top 40 singles of the fifties era. Drawn ...

Behavioral Techniques in the Classroom Essay Behavioral Techniques in the Classroom Very often, American parents complain that schools are disorderly and undisciplined. They claim that their child s behavior has worsened and the child is using vulgar language. Teachers, however, complain that students arrive at school lacking common courtesy and respect for authority. Because of this, instruction time is wasted trying to obtain order (Bennett, et. al., 1999). Student discipline is affected by classroom management. The way in which a teacher manages his /her classroom delineates the type of instruction that will take place in the classroom.

The clearer the structure in the classroom, the more freedom the teacher can allow students (Slavin, 2003). Classroom rules are important in the smooth management of classrooms (Wardle, 2003). Effective schools ensure that parents and students know what is expected of them. Their written rules clearly define acceptable behavior and the consequences for breaking the rules (Bennett, et. al., 1999). Class rules should be few in number, should be seen as fair and make sense to students, and be clearly explained and taught to students. Class rules should become second nature to students (Slavin, 2003). Not only must rules be clearly presented to students, they must also be implemented. Students need to know that there will be real consequences for their misbehavior, not something that they will feel is not a big deal. The teacher needs to be the moral authority in the classroom and it is imperative that school officials and parents back up the teachers decisions (Bennett, et. al., 1999). Teachers who do not establish their authority in the classroom often spend a lot of time dealing with misbehavior (Slavin, 2003). Good behavior should be recognized and high academic standards maintained.

Spontaneous Human Combustion Do You think it s possible for a human being to all of a sudden ignite into a 3000 degree blaze? Well, there are multiple accounts of SHC that might prove it exists. SHC (Spontaneous Human Combustion) is when a human inexplicably bursts into a 3000 degree flame. Also, the strange part to the phenomenon, is that only the body burns, not the house or anything in it! Adding on to that, a usual house ignites and burns down completely from a 1500 degree flame. The most common things to find in a SHC case is the body being completely, or almost reduced to ashes. There will usually be a sweet, smoky smell in the room after the incident. In addition, there are a lot of cases that had alcoholics burst into flames. SHC is a real phenomenon that ... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ... According to (History.com), Because the human body is composed mostly of water and it s only highly flammable properties are fat tissue and methane gas, the possibility of SHC being an actual phenomenon seems remote. Many scientists dismiss the theory, arguing that an undetected flame source such as a match or cigarette is the real culprit in suspected cases. Typically, deceased victims are found close to a fire source, and evidence suggests that many of them accidentally set themselves on fire while smoking or trying to light a flame. (History.com, is SHC real?) This evidence might have some reasonable points, but the wick effect seems like a more reasonable explanation for SHC. The wick effect is the name given to the partial destruction of a human body by fire, when the clothing of the victim soaks up melted human fat and acts like the wick of a candle. The wick effect is a phenomenon that is proven to occur under certain conditions, and has been thoroughly observed.

How Did Charles Darwin Contribute To Science It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most responsive to change, this was said by Charles Darwin, a naturalist who developed the theory of evolution to explain biological change. Almost all things are somehow affected or reshaped entirely by scientific advances. Science plays a huge role in everyone and every things life. There are many scientist who have discovered, helped advance, or even invented incredible things. And in the top 100 influential scientist sits Charles Darwin. Just like any other scientist, his studies open doors to many more. His research and visions of common ancestry revolutionized studies in comparative anatomy, embryology, and taxonomy, and has brought together the basic rule of all biology. But Darwin s innovative idea of the process of evolutionwas received cautiously and remains in the minds of many scientist today. His idea made a huge leap, but there was a missing puzzle piece that was found by scientist Gregor Mendel who figured out that heredity depends on genes. So without Darwin s grand theory many discoveries enabled by the application of evolutionary tools would have not been made. Darwin s ideas have been enhanced and modified as new knowledge and technologies have become... Show more content on Helpwriting.net ...
