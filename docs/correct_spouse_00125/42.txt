Singer/songwriter/actress Solange Knowles has announced her recent marriage to Daniel Smith, a college football player from her native Houston. Solange and Daniel were married in the Bahamas last weekend.

Surrounded by her large extended family -- including her parents, Mathew and Tina Knowles, her sister Beyonce, Kelly Rowland and Angela Beyince-- Solange exchanged vows with Daniel at sunset in a beautiful seaside ceremony.

"I am excited about this new phase in my life," said Solange. "I am very happy and feel truly blessed to have the unconditional love and support of my parents and my entire family."

Solange Knowles' upcoming projects include a co-starring role in her first feature film, "Johnson Family Vacation," the release of her second CD, and a starring role in a still-unnamed new sitcom on UPN. Knowles will also continue her work as a celebrity spokesperson against teen violence.
