        "text": "In typical Solange Knowles fashion, the ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Touch My Hair‚Äù singer once again showed she is not to be tried. After announcing a separation from her husband of five years, Alan Ferguson, rumors began circulating that Solange had an affair with her co-manager John Bogaard, reported Page Six.\n\nAccording to Baller Alert, Twitter users said things like, ‚ÄúSolange really spits all that pro-black sh*t just to cheat on her black husband with a white man‚Äù and ‚ÄúI know damn we Solange ain‚Äôt with no white man.‚Äù\n\nSolange didn‚Äôt hesitate to clap back and address them head on. In a series of now deleted tweets, Solange refuted the allegations. She wrote, ‚ÄúYo, John [Bogaard] is my former co-manager y‚Äôall gotta chill. I‚Äôm not about to be silenced into letting complete lies narrate my life. To take my words ‚Äòmy body left me with no choice but to listen and be still‚Äô after speaking about my health journey‚Ä¶which has already been painful enough and turn [it] into an interpretation of unfaithfulness is just‚Ä¶wow.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúI hate to even give this energy, but I will not let something so untrue follow me when I‚Äôve tried to lead my life in truth. I hope y‚Äôall spread this with the same conviction and energy that [you] did that false narrative. Much love,‚Äù she concluded.\n\nThe eclectic artist also posted a photo of her and Bogaard to her Instagram stories with the caption, ‚Äúyo ty @onvacation for bein the best co-manager for 5 yrs. sorry the internetsss are so unkind n b lying. go back to enjoying ya vacation.‚Äù\n\nListen to GHOGH with Jamarlin Martin | Episode 68: Jamarlin Martin\n\nJamarlin talks about the recent backlash against Lebron James for not speaking up for Joshua Wong and the violent Hong Kong protestors.\n\nHer claims were backed up by a source who spoke to Baller Alert. According to the outlet, a member of Solange‚Äôs team said, ‚ÄúThere was never any cheating. Her and Alan separated earlier this year. ‚Ä¶ Solange and John Bogaard worked together for many years, with him as her co-manager. There was never anything between these two individuals, outside of a working relationship.‚Äù\n\nSolange announced her split from Ferguson in a very vulnerable Instagram post. In it she wrote, ‚Äú11 years ago i met a phenomenal man who changed every existence of my life. early this year we separated and parted ways, (and tho it ain‚Äôt nan no body business üò≠) i find it necessary to protect the sacredness of my personal truth and to live in it fully just as I have before and will continue to do. it is unfair to not have power of your own story as you shape and mold and rewrite it yourself.‚Äù\n\nHer stepfather, Richard Lawson, told Us Weekly the family is supporting Solange through the separation.\n\n‚Äú[We‚Äôre] helping her just work through it. It‚Äôs all a process. And the beautiful thing is, is that everybody comes out the other side is the better for it,‚Äù Lawson said."
