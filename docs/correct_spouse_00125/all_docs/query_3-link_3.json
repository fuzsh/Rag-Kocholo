The 33-year-old is a wildly-successful point guard for the Phoenix Mercury, and she's been playing in the league for a decade. The talented athlete began her career as a college basketball player for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish from 2009-2013. While there, she helped lead her team to three Final Fours and two NCAA championship appearances.
