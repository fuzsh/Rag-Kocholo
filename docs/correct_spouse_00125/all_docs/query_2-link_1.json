        "text": "Solange Knowles just let the world in on some personal news: she and husband Alan Ferguson have parted ways.\n\nThe “Seat At The Table” singer is often selective about the aspects of her personal life she’s willing to share with the public. However, after months of speculation, she felt compelled to set the record straight and discuss the personal journey that led her to make the tough decision.\n\n“The past 2 years have brought me more physical and spiritual transition and evolution than ever before,” she captioned a series of outdoor portraits. “My body left me with no choice but to listen and be still. Within that stillness i begin my journey in confronting my worst enemy, fear.”\n\nShe continues: “I’ve lived my best and worst moments in front of the lens and gaze of the world since I was a teenager. I’ve always tried to live in my truth no matter how ugly or full of love it is. I’ve also tried to carve out the space to protect my heart, and my life as it unfolds, evolves, and changes.”\n\nDiscussing her split with Ferguson specifically, she writes, “11 years ago I met a phenomenal man who changed every existence of my life. Early this year we separated and parted ways, (and tho it ain’t nan no body business) I find it necessary to protect the sacredness of my personal truth and to live in it fully just as I have before and will continue to do. it is unfair to not have power of your own story as you shape and mold and rewrite it yourself. A nigga ain’t perfect, but I’m leaning into the fear of the unknown and all the glory and power I know exist within god and the universes grace.\n\nIn conclusion, she addresses her four million IG followers with, “May all of your transitions no matter how big or small, be kind to you and filled with incredible love and light!”"
