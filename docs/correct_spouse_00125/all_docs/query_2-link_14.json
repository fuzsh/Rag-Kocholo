        "text": "It’s the end of the road for Solange Knowles and her husband, Alan Ferguson.\n\nThe singer-songwriter announced their separation on Saturday, November 2, though it appears that the couple has been apart for months. In an Instagram post, Solange noted that she and Alan met 11 years ago, and that he “changed every existence” of her life thereafter. “Early this year we separated and parted ways, (and tho it ain’t nan no body business 😭) I find it necessary to protect the sacredness of my personal truth and to live in it fully just as I have before and will continue to do,” she added. “It is unfair to not have power of your own story as you shape and mold and rewrite it yourself.”\n\nHer post also referenced the autonomic disorder she’s been dealing with since 2017, explaining that the past two years have contained “more physical and spiritual transition and evolution than ever before.” It seems as though that journey has helped Solange figure out what’s best for her going forward. “My body left me with no choice but to listen and be still,” she said on Instagram. “Within that stillness, I begin my journey in confronting my worst enemy, fear.”\n\nAs reported by People, Solange and Alan tied the knot in November 2014, almost exactly five years ago. They exchanged vows at the the Marigny Opera House in New Orleans, where they made a stunning entrance to the ceremony on a pair of vintage bicycles. The wedding was attended by approximately 200 guests comprised of family, friends, and plenty of celebs.\n\nDespite what seemed like a picturesque love story at the time, Solange’s fans are standing by her decision now, offering support for the musician on social media. “We will forever appreciate your authenticity,” one fan commented on Instagram, while another wrote: “Sending you lots of love and hugs. Protect your story — so you can rewrite it as your heart and soul desires.”"
