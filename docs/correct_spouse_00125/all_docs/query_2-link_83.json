        "text": "Solange Knowles is a single lady no longer!\n\nThe 28-year-old DJ wed Alan Ferguson, 51, on Sunday in New Orleans, reports Vogue.\n\nThe bride's sister, Beyonce Knowles, and her brother-in-law, Jay Z, were in attendance.\n\n\"Everyone I worked with on the wedding are friends who I love,\" said Solange, who wore a dress by Humberto Leon for Kenzo. \"Everything was a labor of love.\" (See an Instagram photo of her dress below.)\n\nKnowles put her own spin on the affair, opting to ride a bike to the ceremony, which was held in the Bywater district of the city. After changing out of her ivory jumpsuit, she walked down the aisle to a symphonic instrumental of Donny Hathaway's \"I Love the Lord, He Heard My Cry.\""
