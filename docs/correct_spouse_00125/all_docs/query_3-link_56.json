        "text": "Daniel Mark Smith was born on January 15, 1984, on a snowy night in Amarillo, Texas, to Mr. and Mrs. Carol Ray Smith. Daniel gained his wings far too early at the young age of 39, on August 9, 2023.\n\nFriends and family will gather for a visitation on Friday, August 18, 2023, from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. at Angel Funeral Home, 2209 S. Arthur. Daniel's life will be celebrated on Saturday, August 19, 2023, at 10:00 a.m., in the funeral home's Chapel of Angels.\n\nAs a child, Daniel was full of life and active. He was always up to something. He loved playing and watching football and baseball with his brothers by his side. According to his momma, “he was a great little catcher.” Though he enjoyed football and baseball, basketball had his heart. He was on top of the world in 7th grade when he assisted his teammates in winning the City Championship in Basketball for the Horace Mann Buffalos. He brought the love of the game into his adult years, cheering on Syracuse Orangemen! Hence why you only saw him in orange and blue!\n\nDaniel was happiest with family, from the many lake and river trips to just having a simple cookout with everyone. The countless hours with family helped him develop the traits that made him a person. Working with his dad and brothers, he developed a fantastic work ethic learning the roofing trade.\n\nDaniel had many hobbies. He loved working with his hands, from tinkering on cars and bikes to painting and drawing. He could find treasure in what most thought was trash. Daniel had a heart for helping others.\n\nDaniel met the love of his life, Shaleb, in middle school in 1996. They would move on, but their love would reunite them in 2015. True love always finds a way. They grew their family over the years. He was an instant stepfather to Kobe and Kiana, and they had two children of their own, Dezirae and Daniel Mark II. He was close to each one in their own way.\n\nHe was a loving spouse, a great father, a caring son, a loyal brother, an all-around good person, and a friend to all. If you knew Daniel, you would remember his big heart and a giant smile. For those who loved him, this would be a very different world without him. He will be genuinely missed. His memory will live on forever through his beautiful children.\n\nAlways and Forever 15 84…\n\nThose left to cherish his memories are his spouse Shaleb Bowie, Kids Kobe, Kiana, Dezirae & Daniel Mark II. Parents Mr. and Mrs. Carol Ray “Butch” Smith. Siblings Gary, Julie, Kenda, Kenneth, Adam, Landon & Gayle. 12 Nephews, 7 Nieces, 4 Grandkids, & 2 Great Nieces. Zelda “Granny” Smith & Numerous Uncles, Aunts, Cousins, and Friends.\n\nDaniel is preceded in death by Sister Lauren Smith, Grandpa R.B. Smith, Great Grandma Gussie Hallmark, Grandma Eva Long, Grandpa George Parrie Sr., Uncle David Parrie, and Aunt Diane Parrie.\n\nLet’s Pack the Place with Syracuse Orangemen Colors, ORANGE & BLUE for Daniel!!!!"
