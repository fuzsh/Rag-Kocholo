        "text": "Los Angeles: Singer Solange Knowles has tiedthe knot with music director boyfriend Alan Ferguson at a church in New Orleans. The couple got married on Sunday in front of about 100 close friends and family, including sister Beyonce and brother-in-law Jay Z, reported E! Online.\n\nEveryone, including the couple, wore white for the ceremony. Solange, 28, sported a stunning Humberto Leon for Kenzo floor-length gown with an attached cape. Beyonce wore a short fitted dress, while Jay Z sported a white suit. The couple beamed as they took photos after the ceremony, while mother Tina Knowles, 60, in a long-sleeve, floor length gown, was spotted holding hands with her boyfriend.\n\nThe pre-wedding festivities kicked off on Friday night. Solange, sporting a gorgeous, modern bridal-style dress, was spotted walking and holding hands with her beau as they headed towards the Indywood Cinema theatre, while Bey was seen entering the building by herself.\n\nSolange was previously married to her 10-year-old son Julez's father Daniel Smith in February 2004, later confirming their split in 2007. Julez played a big part of the couple's special day as well. The singer first sparked the news that she was engaged after posting a photo on Instagram of her and Ferguson swimming in an ocean and embracing while on vacation for her birthday. Ferguson has worked with Katy Perry, Fall Out Boy, Gym Class Heroes, Nelly Fertado, and, of course, Beyonce and Jay Z."
