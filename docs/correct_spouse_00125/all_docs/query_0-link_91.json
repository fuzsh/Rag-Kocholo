        "text": "Julez Smith had a star-studded 19th birthday celebration last month, surrounded by some of his famous family members. Smith, who is the son of singer Solange Knowles and her ex-husband Daniel Smith, enjoyed the special day with his parents, aunt Beyoncé, uncle Jay-Z, Kelly Rowland, and his grandma, Tina Knowles, among others.\n\nTina Knowles took to Instagram shortly after Julez’s 19th birthday on October 18th to shower him with love and well-wishes.\n\nIn a post, she wrote, “Happy Birthday Julez ! And happy Graduation ! We love you and are so proud of you .”\n\nTina also shared a video from the celebration. In the clip, Julez sat at the head as his family and friends serenaded him with a rendition of “Happy Birthday.”\n\n“This is the song Happy Birthday when you get a bunch of singers together,” Knowles wrote, adding, “The party was Great @solangeknowles you did that!!.”\n\nThe voices of not only Solange but also Julez’s aunt Beyoncé and her fellow Destiny’s Child member, Kelly Rowland, could be heard singing in the background.\n\nJulez’s birthday celebration serves as a testament to the supportive family that surrounds him. In 2013, when Julez was just 8 years old, Solange shared that she had relocated to Brooklyn, NY to be closer to her family, which included her parents, sister, friends, and cousin.\n\nShe emphasized the importance of having a “village”, stating,”We really wanted Julez to have the experience that we had growing up ― being able to drop in on his aunt’s house and being able to hang out with Grandma and see our friends and have that experience of actually having a soccer game and having family show up.”\n\nSolange further elaborated, “It’s such a beautiful feeling, but also having that village is a necessary reality so that I’m able to pursue my passion both outside of motherhood and outside of my career.”"
