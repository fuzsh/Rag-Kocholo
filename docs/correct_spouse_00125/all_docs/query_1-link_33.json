        "text": "Born:\n\nSolange Piaget Knowles\n\nJune 24, 1986 (38 years old)\n\nHouston, Texas, U.S.A.\n\nOccupation:\n\nSinger-songwriter, actress & record producer\n\nYears active:\n\n2001-present\n\nParents:\n\nSiblings:\n\nBeyoncé (big sister)\n\nNixon Knowles (younger half-brother)\n\nKoi Knowles (younger half-sister)\n\nEx-Husbands:\n\nDaniel Smith (m. 2004-2007)\n\nAlan Ferguson (m. 2014-2019)\n\nBoyfriend:\n\nGio Escobar (2019-present)\n\nSon:\n\nJulez Smith (b. 2004)\n\nNicknames:\n\nS, Sol, Solo, Solly & Sol-inky\n\nSolange (previously Solange Piaget Knowles-Smith & Solange Piaget Knowles-Ferguson, born Solange Piaget Knowles; June 24, 1986) is a Louisiana Creole-American/African-American singer-songwriter, actress & record producer. Expressing an interest in music from an early age, Knowles had several temporary stints as a backup dancer for Destiny's Child, which featured her sister among the members before signing with her dad's Music World Entertainment label. At 16, Knowles released her first studio album, Solo Star (2002). Between 2005 & 2007, Knowles had several minor acting roles including the direct-to-video, Bring It On: All or Nothing (2006) and continued writing music for Beyoncé and for former Destiny's Child group members, Kelly Rowland & Michelle Williams. In 2007, Knowles began to record music again. Her second studio album, Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams (2008) deviated from the pop-oriented music of her debut to the Motown Sound of the 1960s and 1970s. It peaked at number nine on US Billboard 200 and received positive reviews from critics. She followed this up with the 1980s pop and R&B–inspired extended play, True (2012) on Terrible Records and her imprint, Saint Records. Her third studio album, A Seat at the Table (2016) was released to widespread critical acclaim & became her first number-one album in the United States. The album's lead single, Cranes in the Sky won the Grammy for Best R&B Performance. Her fourth studio album, When I Get Home was released in 2019.\n\nKnowles was heavily influenced by Motown girl groups and says that her first passion is songwriting. She's frequently compared by the media to Beyoncé, but Solange insists they have different aspirations and are musically different. She has been ranked by Billboard as the 100th most successful dance artist of all-time & was honored in 2017 with the Impact Award at Billboard Women in Music. Her other ventures include an endorsement deal with Rimmel London and a line of hip-hop-oriented merchandise for young children.\n\nDiscography[]\n\nSolo Star (2002)\n\nSol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams (2008)\n\nA Seat at the Table (2016)\n\nWhen I Get Home (2019)\n\nEngagements[]\n\nMain article: Solange & Daniel's Engagement\n\nMain article: Solange & Alan's Engagement\n\nWeddings[]\n\nMain article: Solange & Daniel's Wedding\n\nMain article: Solange & Alan's Wedding\n\nTrivia[]\n\nSolange means sun angel in French.\n\nSolange's middle name, Piaget was named after luxury watch brand, Piaget.\n\nSolange's Louisiana Creole-American on Tina's side & African-American on Mathew's side.\n\nSolange was 13 when she & Daniel began dating.\n\nSolange was 17 when she & Daniel got engaged and when she married Daniel.\n\nSolange was 18 when she gave birth to Julez.\n\nSolange was 20 when she & Daniel split and when she and Daniel got divorced.\n\nSolange was 22 when she & Alan began dating.\n\nSolange was 23 when Tina & Mathew split and when Nixon was born.\n\nSolange was 24 when Koi was born and when Gena & Mathew began dating.\n\nSolange was 25 when Tina & Mathew got divorced and when Gena & Mathew got engaged.\n\nSolange was 27 when Tina & Richard began dating and Gena & Mathew got married.\n\nSolange was 28 when she & Alan got engaged, when Tina & Richard got engaged, when she married Alan and when Tina & Richard got married.\n\nSolange was 32 when she & Alan split.\n\nWhen Solange was in middle school, she petitioned to get both her English teacher and principal fired because her teacher gave her an F on her essay about her favorite poet, Nas, when the teacher didn't consider Nas a poet. Her father supported the petition and the essay and as a result, the teacher changed Solange's essay to an A.[1]\n\nSolange went to Louie Welch Middle School and Kinder High School for the Performing and Visual Arts like her sister.[1][2]\n\nSolange disassembled her sister Beyoncé's trophies when she was 6.[3]"
