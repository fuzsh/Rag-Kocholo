        "text": "The Knowles family took over the Luar fall 2024 fashion show on Tuesday in New York.\n\nSitting on the front row, Beyoncé and her mom, Tina Knowles, held court to see Daniel “Julez” J. Smith Jr., son of Solange Knowles and her ex-husband Daniel Smith, walk his first runway.\n\nFor the family moment, Beyoncé wore a sequin and crystal-embellished silver blazer from Gaurav Gupta’s spring 2024 couture collection. Giving continuity to her country era, Beyoncé accessorized the look with a gray cowboy hat.\n\nTina Knowles kept it classic in a black power suit. She sat next to Beyoncé and designer Christopher John Rogers.\n\nSmith Jr. walked the Luar runway in an oversize leather trenchcoat with dramatic sleeves that feature a furry trim.\n\n“Julez My Baby…Thanks to the Talented Raul designer extraordinaire,” Tina Knowles commented on her Instagram after the show, praising Luar’s creative director Raul Lopez’s work.\n\nBeyoncé is keeping busy. On Sunday, the singer attended Super Bowl LVIII with her husband, Jay-Z, and their daughters, Blue Ivy and Rumi Carter. During the sporting event, the singer announced the release of “Act II” from her “Renaissance” trilogy, which will be available for streaming on March 29."
