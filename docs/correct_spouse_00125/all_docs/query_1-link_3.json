        "text": "His star-studded family\n\nJulez is the son of Beyoncé’s equally talented musician sister Solange Knowles, 36, and songwriter and former NFL player Daniel Smith, 39. Though his parents are now separated, Julez seems to maintain a close relationship with his father, with Smith often sharing images and praising his son on social media.\n\nAfter Daniel Smith Snr’s NFL days, he became the talent manager for Jay-Z, 52, as per Hollywood Life. This makes young Julez’s family dynamic quite interesting as Jay-Z is Julez’s uncle and Beyoncé, 41, his aunt.\n\nMusic mishap\n\nThough Smith is surrounded by musicians and a family of singer-songwriters, the 18-year-old mentioned in an interview with 97.9 The Box in Houston that he doesn’t plan on entering the music industry, but he enjoys making beats in his free time just for fun.\n\nA while after making this claim, he posted a snippet of himself rapping to a beat on TikTok. Though the post went viral with over 100,000 views in a short period, it brought a negative reaction from citizens and Smith found himself being trolled on social media. The online community weren’t pleased with the lyrics, with many observers slamming his taste in music and apparent lack of flow, despite coming from a family of prestigious musicians and entertainers.\n\nSeveral tweets and memes popped up on Twitter with some of them saying things like “the talent missed his genes” and, “Everybody doesn’t have to go into music. There are other lovely careers out there.”\n\nCaught in controversy\n\nAccording to a report by Meaww, Adore posted alleged messages between herself and Smith, and she claimed that he had impregnated her.\n\nA basketball future?\n\nDespite being born into a celebrity world, Smith has gone on recording saying he isn’t into the celebrity culture and doesn’t want to go into the world of entertainment.\n\nAn article by Ace Show Biz weighed in on this and stated how Smith had a not-so-great experience when meeting Quavo, of the hip-hop trio Migos, for the first time. He mentioned that the rapper was kind of “mean” to him.\n\nWith music out of his line of career, Smith hopes to follow in his father’s sporty footsteps and enter the professional world of basketball. Unlike the music world, some sports writers have taken note, praising his dedication and skills, and tipping him for a possible future pro career.\n\nDuring his interview with 97.9, he mentioned that he has already decided to play basketball in college and has his eyes on top schools like UCLA and Texas Tech. His NBA inspirations have been named as Allen Iverson, James Harden and LeBron James."
