        "text": "Notorious South Carolina inmate Susan Smith reportedly told one of several suitors that she would make a \"good stepmom\" as her first parole hearing approaches in her life sentence for drowning her two boys.\n\nSmith, 52, also told her admirer on the recorded jailhouse phone call from Leath Correctional Institution last month that she \"could see [herself] around kids,\" per transcripts obtained by The Messenger.\n\n\"You'd be great, babe,\" responded the suitor, one of more than half a dozen corresponding with Smith, the outlet reported.\n\nSUSAN SMITH, SOUTH CAROLINA MOM JAILED FOR KILLING 2 SONS, STOPPED WRITING TO LONG-DISTANCE BOYFRIEND: REPORT\n\nPer South Carolina Department of Corrections records, Smith began her life sentence on Nov. 4, 1994, after she was convicted on two counts of murder in the deaths of sons Michael Daniel Smith, 3, and Alexander Tyler Smith, 14 months.\n\nInitially, then-22-year-old Smith told investigators that a Black man had carjacked her while the two boys were still inside the car.\n\nDays later, she wept alongside husband David Smith on national television, pleading for their safe return:\n\n\"Your mama loves you so much,\" she said during one news conference.\n\nSUSAN SMITH, MOM WHO KILLED TWO SONS IN 1994, SENDS ROMANTIC LETTERS TO BOYFRIEND FROM PRISON: REPORT\n\nBut ultimately, Smith admitted that there was no carjacker – she let her car roll into John D. Long Lake and watched as the vehicle sunk with the two children still strapped into the car seats.\n\nHer prospective affair partner and ex-boyfriend, Tom Findalay, penned a letter a week earlier that prosecutors said drove Smith to drown the boys:\n\n\"Susan, I could really fall for you. But like I have told you before, there are some things about you that aren't suited for me, and yes, I am speaking about your children,\" he wrote, per Deseret News.\n\nBut Smith has long argued that she did not drown her children for a man's sake, claiming instead that she had a psychotic breakdown.\n\nNow, relatives are not shocked by the near half-dozen men who have reached out to Smith while she's behind bars, telling The Messenger that \"guys have always flocked to Susan.\"\n\n\"She's always been into guys, obviously,\" one relative told the outlet. \"It would be the best case scenario for her, to be in a relationship. So she's hoping to find the right man to live with if she gets out.\"\n\nWATCH ON FOX NATION: THE SHOCKING STORY OF SUSAN SMITH\n\nWith her first parole hearing scheduled for Nov. 4, 2024, the mother plans to request her release.\n\nFormer husband David Smith – who appeared by her side on national news stations during the fruitless search for their dead children and was later pictured weeping at the boys' funerals – intends to oppose her release.\n\n\"David still thinks of his boys every day, and doesn't ever want Susan to get out,\" one of the man's relatives told The Messenger. \"She belongs in jail… she is exactly where she needs to be – in prison. And we will do what it takes to keep her there.\"\n\nSUZANNE MORPHEW MURDER: DA UNDER FIRE AS HUSBAND, DAUGHTERS SAY THEY'RE 'DISCOURAGED' IN UNSOLVED CASE\n\nMeanwhile, Smith's suitors are vying to help her post-release, per conversations reviewed by the outlet, offering her money and accommodations.\n\nOne man offered her a car, another offered her a place to stay with his relatives when she is paroled, while another spoke in recorded conversations about moving in together and starting a family.\n\nCASE OF MISSING TENNESSEE WOMAN, WHOSE HEAD WAS FOUND 30 YEARS AGO, STILL HAUNTS FAMILY: 'WE NEED ANSWERS'\n\nOne of the men told the outlet that he \"just [found Smith] interesting and misunderstood\" and that the woman is \"not what you think she is.\"\n\n\"She's a good person who did something terrible when she was young and not in her right mind – people can change,\" he told the outlet.\n\nSmith's search for love has gone on inside prison walls, too, with People reporting an illicit sexual relationship with a prison guard alongside marijuana use and self-mutilation in her disciplinary record."
