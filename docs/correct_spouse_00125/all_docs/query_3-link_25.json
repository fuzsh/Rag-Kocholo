        "text": "Skylar Diggins is a married woman now!\n\nThe WNBA star and her husband, Daniel Smith, exchanged their vows in front of close family and friends at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago with a lavish wedding experience curated by Kesh Designs.\n\nSkylar and met Daniel at the University of Notre Dame where he was a member of the football team. The two began dating in college and continued to grow in their relationship after Diggins entered the WNBA. The couple was engaged last summer during one of Daniel’s art exhibits.\n\nThe Smiths wedding party was a Fighting Irish affair attended by friends and Norte Dame teammates, including Skylar’s former high school and college basketball teammates and her former coach.\n\n“When I see you two, it always reminds me that true love still exists! @skydigg4 and @daniel87smith your commitment and love truly inspires me ! I wish you both continued happiness and bliss! May God continue to bless you both ! I love you guys #meettheSmiths,” shared Notre Dame’s Associate Head Coach and Recruiting Coordinator at the University of Notre Dame, Niele Ivey.\n\nPrior to tying the knot, the basketball pro even changed her name on her jersey so you know it’s real."
