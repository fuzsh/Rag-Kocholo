She did not give much detail, but said only that they had separated earlier this year.\n\nIn a very spiritual Solange-y way, and along with three stunning, dressed-down photos, the singer referred to changes in her life that had led to the breakup: ‚Äúthe past 2 years have brought me more physical and spiritual transition and evolution than ever before,‚Äù she wrote. ‚Äúive lived my best and worst moments in front of the lens and gaze of the world since i was a teenager. ive always tried to live in my truth no matter how ugly or full of love it is.‚Äù As of Ferguson, she said, ‚Äú11 years ago i met a phenomenal man who changed every existence of my life. early this year we separated and parted ways, (and tho it ain‚Äôt nan no body business üò≠) i find it necessary to protect the sacredness of my personal truth and to live in it fully just as I have before and will continue to do.‚Äù"
