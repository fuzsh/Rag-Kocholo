At the time, Daniel was in high school. In the interview, Solange revealed that they were high school sweethearts.\n\nAfter dating several years, Solange and Daniel decided to tie the wedding knot. They got married in February 2004, after she discovered that she was pregnant with Daniel's son Daniel Jr.\n\nSolange gave birth to their child in October 2004 and the family moved on to live in Moscow. From the day, the married pair were also parenting their kid merrily and jointly.\n\nEverything was going fine but after three years of marital relationship, Solange & Daniel divorced in 2007. It seems like even after the separation, they remain good friends and are parenting their son happily.\n\nHalf-Siblings\n\nDaniel Smith Jr is the only child of Solange and Daniel.

But this marriage was also fleeting which ended up in 2019. Additionally, Knowles and Ferguson did not share any kids from the marriage.\n\nIs Daniel Julez J. Smith Jr Dating Someone?\n\nThe 16-years-old Daniel Julez Jr has not mentioned his exact relationship status towards media.

Although, Woods and Smith Jr are facing rumors regarding their affair. They have not mentioned their relationship status clearly.\n\nNet Worth\n\nJulez Smith Jr is currently focused on his studies.
