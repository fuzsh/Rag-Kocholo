        "text": "Solange Knowles tied the knot with music video director Alan Ferguson in New Orleans on Sunday. The ceremony, attended by Knowles’ big sister Beyoncé and brother-in-law Jay Z, took place at Holy Trinity Church in the Crescent City’s Bywater neighborhood, Us Weekly reports. The couple rode into their nuptials on matching white bikes.\n\nTrending\n\nKnowles has made New Orleans her home since moving there from Brooklyn with her 10-year-old son Julez in the summer of 2013. In an interview with Harper’s Bazaar this past March, Knowles spoke about how her relocation to Louisiana has helped with work on a new album. “I figure there’s no better way to buckle down and finish it than to be as far away from everyone as possible, cell phone and computer behind,” she said. “I’m not very good at writing songs when I have a lot of clutter in my mind.” Her most recent record was the 2012 EP True, which she wrote and produced with Dev Hynes.\n\nFerguson, who had been dating Knowles for several years, has already done quite a bit of work with his new in-laws, directing the videos for Beyoncé ‘s songs “Party” and “Dance for You” as well as Jay Z’s “Feelin’ It” and “Who You Wit.” His long list of collaborators also includes Janelle Monae, John Legend and Fall out Boy."
