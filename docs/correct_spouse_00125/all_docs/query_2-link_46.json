But this time, she chose to speak out in order to \"protect\" her truth and be in control of how her story is shared.\n\n\"I find it necessary to protect the sacredness of my personal truth and to live in it fully just as I have before and will continue to do,\" she added. \"It is unfair to not have power of your own story as you shape and mold and rewrite it yourself.\"\n\nKnowles and Ferguson, a director, married in November 2014 in New Orleans. At the time, the bride wore a cream caped ensemble by Humberto Leon for Kenzo, and the couple famously arrived to their ceremony on matching cruiser bikes.\n\nIn addition to divulging about her relationship, Solange also opened up about the \"physical and spiritual transition and evolution\" she's undergone in the past two years. \"My body left me with no choice but to listen and be still,\" she began her Instagram caption. \"Within that stillness I begin my journey in confronting my worst enemy, fear.\"\n\nShe ended her message with an uplifting note, saying she's \"leaning into the fear of the unknown and all the glory and power I know exist within god and the universe's grace.\" Solange continued, \"May all of your transitions no matter how big or small, be kind to you and filled with incredible love and light!\""
