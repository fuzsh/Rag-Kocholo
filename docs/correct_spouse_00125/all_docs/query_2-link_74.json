        "text": "We all know who Solange Knowles is, right? She’s Beyoncé‘s little sister, a kick-ass recording artist in her own right… and the chick who went completely nuclear on Jay Z in that elevator incident at the Met Gala back in 2014. We’re less familiar with Alan Ferguson, who has now been married to Knowles for about two years. Here are seven fun facts about Beyoncé and Jay Z’s brother-in-law.\n\n1. He’s a music video director\n\nFerguson has directed videos for Katy Perry, John Legend, Fall Out Boy, Beyoncé and Jay Z. He won a BET Award for Best Video Director for co-directing Beyoncé’s “Party” and “Dance for You” music videos.\n\nMore: Solange Knowles and Jay Z out shopping…?!\n\n2. He’s 53 years old\n\nFerguson is 53 years old; Knowles is 30. We’ll do the math for you. Ferguson is technically old enough to be a grandpa — maybe not quite old enough to be Knowles‘ grandfather (but certainly old enough to be her father). But hey, love is love is love, so more power to them for finding one another!\n\n3. He’s a Leo\n\nFerguson is a Leo, and Knowles is a Cancer. According to Astrology.com, “When Cancer and Leo make a love match, they understand and know how to satisfy basic emotional needs within one another. Both these signs require dedication and tender, loving care, but while Cancer seeks stability and emotional harmony, Leo craves heartfelt compliments and sincere admiration. Both are strongly loyal, even to the point of possessiveness — Cancer for safety’s sake — Leo for the sake of their self-confidence. They are also both committed to a[n] enduring, rewarding connection. Since their desires are similar, a Cancer and a Leo may fill very important voids in each other’s lives.”\n\nMore: Solange Knowles publicly addresses that Jay Z elevator incident\n\n4. They’ve been dating since 2008\n\nMr. and Mrs. Ferguson were first spotted in 2008 at an art gallery. Over the years, they’ve been seen together at many functions, several of them with Beyoncé and Jay Z.\n\n5. Knowles pursued Ferguson\n\nIn a 2013 interview, Knowles admitted she was the one who put the moves on first.\n\n“In the beginning, I was the one who approached him, so I have always sort of historically been one of those girls that goes after something that I’m into,” she said. “I’m not very old school and like, I’m not gonna wait on you. Wait for you to approach me type of situation.”\n\n6. He came from a military family\n\nFerguson’s mother is Winifred Hocker Ferguson. Ferguson’s late father, William Alfred Ferguson Sr., was a U.S. Army veteran and a postal worker.\n\n7. He’s a middle child\n\nFerguson is a middle child. He has an older brother, William, and a younger brother, Mark.\n\nMore: Solange Knowles shuts down hateful comments about her young son (PHOTO)\n\n8. Knowles got some sexual healing\n\nKnowles told the London Evening Standard in 2012, “I think I just finally started having good sex,” and she was dating Ferguson at the time. That statement was likely meant as a dig at her first husband, high school sweetheart Daniel Smith, who Knowles married when she was 17. The marriage ended just four years later.\n\n9. Knowles and Ferguson make sweet, sweet music together\n\nAnd we mean this literally. Knowles recently dropped two new music video from her new album A Seat at the Table, and both were co-directed by Ferguson.\n\nMore: Solange’s new album A Seat at the Table is unapologetically black\n\nDo you think Knowles and Ferguson are a match made in heaven?"
