        "text": "Earlier this week, rumors began to surface concerning Solange and Alan Ferguson‘s marriage. To put out the flames, Solange posted a touching caption on her Instagram account to confirm their split.\n\n“Eleven years ago I met a phenomenal man who changed every existence of my life,” the “Cranes In The Sky” singer wrote. “Early this year we separated and parted ways, (and tho it ain’t nan no body business) I find it necessary to protect the sacredness of my personal truth and to live in it fully just as I have before and will continue to do.” The 33-year-old artist continued to state that she can’t deny the fact that she’s had to navigate life’s ups and downs in the spotlight but is assured that her message will help someone dealing with a similar situation.\n\n“It is unfair to not have power of your own story as you shape and mold and rewrite it yourself. a nigga ain’t perfect, but I’m leaning into the fear of the unknown and all the glory and power I know exist within god and the universes grace,” she continued. “May all of your transitions no matter how big or small, be kind to you and filled with incredible love and light!”\n\nIn November 2014, the pair tied the knot in New Orleans. Since then, Ferguson remained a part of Solange’s musical creativity in terms of video production.\n\nRead her full message below."
