        "text": "Solange Knowles is a married woman! The 28-year-old tied the knot with video director Alan Ferguson at the Marigny Opera House in New Orleans on Sunday in front of 200 guests. At around 2pm, the bride and her groom, 51, arrived at their wedding venue together riding white vintage bicycles, Solange's basket filled with white flowers. She was dressed in a plunging white playsuit and a cape, injecting a splash of colour with bright red lipstick. Her husband-to-be matched in a white suit without the tie.\n\nFor the ceremony itself, Solange wore a simple and classic floor-length white gown with an attached cape. The wedding party also all wore white; sister Beyoncé in a fitted dress and mum Tina Knowles in a long-sleeve gown. Beyoncé arrived for the ceremony in a black SUV with her husband Jay Z and daughter Blue Ivy. Other guests included Solange's 10-year-old son Daniel Julez.\n\nAhead of their wedding ceremony, the happy couple celebrated with an intimate pre-wedding bash at Indywood Cinema. Guests were treated to a special screening of the 1975 Diana Ross classic Mahogany, a film particularly close to Solange and Alan's hearts. \"It was pretty adorable,\" the cinema's owner, Hayley Sampson, told People. \"They were talking about how they met and that the bonded (over) this film and then showed everyone the movie.\"\n\nA statement from the cinema read, \"Solange is getting married to a wonderful man on Sunday and they rented out the theatre for a pre-wedding party. It was beautiful, they were beautiful, Diana Ross is beautiful, love is beautiful.\" This is the second marriage for Solange, who had her son Daniel, 10, with ex-husband Daniel Smith."
