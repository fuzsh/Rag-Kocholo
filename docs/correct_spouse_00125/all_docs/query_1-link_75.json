        "text": "SOLANGE KNOWLES is said to be set to marry her long-term boyfriend, Alan Ferguson, in New Orleans this weekend.\n\nThe singer and video director got engaged some time ago, US Weekly reports, but kept the union quiet. The couple, who generally stay out of the public eye, have attended a few select events together, most recently joining Knowles's sister Beyoncé and husband Jay Z at a dinner in New Orleans in late October.\n\nKnowles's 10-year-old son Julez is reportedly set to take part in the nuptials, which are thought to be scheduled for this Sunday, November 16. Knowles married her first husband - Daniel Smith, the father of her son - when she was just 17. The singer, who is still just 28, has said before that going through a divorce and having her son while still so young made her grow up quickly, negating the age gap between herself and Ferguson, who is 51."
