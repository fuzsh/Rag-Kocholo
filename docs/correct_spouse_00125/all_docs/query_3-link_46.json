        "text": "Grateful to the Camp Lejeune leaders for their hospitality and for allowing us to bring Hiring Our Heroes Brand Ambassador and Medal of Honor Recipient Sgt Dakota Meyer to speak with the Marines. It was an incredible honor visiting and meeting with Marines alongside Dakota and Hiring Our Heroes Vice President, Elizabeth OBrien. Dakota’s message of leading with empathy resonates deeply. In our journey as leaders, it's not just about commands, but understanding, supporting, and uplifting those we serve. Thank you to Toyota North America for your partnership and supporting our Military Community and ambassador engagements like this trip. Through their support we were able to meet with over 700 Marines. Dakota and Liz also spoke at our Career Summit which provided transition support to over 150 members from the military community. Lauren Kovaleski Dennis Bronzo and Becky Thomas did an amazing job planning and executing the Career Sunmit. Between their hard work and the hard work from the Camp Lejeune MCCS staff. I know without a doubt the Marines and their spouses are better prepared for Transition. None of this would be possible without our great partners for this event Toyota North America and HCA Healthcare #hiringourheroes #military #leadership #empathy #militaryspouse #toyota\n\nThrilled to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with some incredible soldiers of the 82nd Airborne as they inducted SEAC John Troxell into their Hall of Fame. It's moments like these that remind me of the honor and camaraderie that define our service. Here's to celebrating our shared commitment to excellence and service to our nation! John's dedication is truly inspiring! With 38 years of service under his belt, his commitment to supporting our military community shines bright. As a Hiring Our Heroes Ambassador, he's not only educating but empowering Service Members, Veterans, and Military Spouses worldwide. Huge thanks to Toyota North America for their unwavering support in making these invaluable initiatives possible!# Dennis Bronzo Patrick J. Murphy #Service #Veterans #HiringOurHeroes #Toyota #usarmy #usmilitary #82ndAirborne #HallOfFame\n\nGrateful to have had the opportunity to meet the incredible soldiers from PSYOP Thor during a workout session with Hiring Our Heroes Ambassador John Troxell. Their dedication to physical fitness and mental resilience is truly inspiring. It was an honor to train alongside such disciplined professionals, reinforcing the importance of teamwork and perseverance. Grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow together. Thank you Dennis Bronzo for setting up this PT session and for being a great team mate. One Team One Fight #PSYOPThor #Fitness #Teamwork #Resilience #hiringourheroes\n\nWhat an amazing trip to JBLM. Just spent the last few days visiting units and Commanders on JBLM to discuss Hiring Our Heroes programs with HOH Ambassador, the Honorable Patrick J. Murphy. We did PT with the 504th MP BN on Tuesday and PT this morning with the 16CAB. We even had one of our partner employers Alec Mizner from Werner Enterprises join us for PT. We also met with the Garrison Commander, Col Park and Deputy Commanding General for I Corps, MG McFalarne. These two great Americans care deeply for their service members as well as for the military spouses connected to their soldiers. We were joined by our HOH Teammates Rob, Stefanie, and Jessica for our meetings with representatives from the Tacoma Chamber of Commerce - Carlos Ortiz, and WorkForce Central. Shellie Willis, MSM Nonprofit, CDFM-A,LSSBB and Katie Condit are doing so much work for the military community in the area and I look forward to more collaboration in the future. We even had USCG representation at the meetings through the Seattle TRM Epsy Garcia. Lastly, I want to thank our great partner Shane Watson from the JBLM Transition office. Without the support from Shane none of this would have been possible! Alec Mizner Stefanie Watson Rob Comer Jessica Oxley, MBA, CWDP Patrick J. Murphy U.S. Coast Guard US Army"
