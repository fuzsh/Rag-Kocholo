        "text": "“In a lot of ways, emotionally and mentally, I feel far older that 27,” Solange Knowles revealed in the latest issue of Harper’s Bazaar.\n\nThe eclectic star, who had son Daniel Julez and married her high school sweetheart at the age of 17, says being a divorcee by the time she was 19 made her grow up fast. “Just going through a marriage and a divorce-which I essentially did by 21-will give you an insane amount of perspective on life,” she shared, adding how at just 27 she’s a bit ahead of the game.\n\n“Everyone talks about how, in your 30s, all of these growing pains transition into wisdom and you feel more self-assured and confident, but I think I had a bit of a jump-start on that at 27,” she said.\n\n“For the first time in my life, I’m basing every decision around the idea of whether I want to do it or if I think it will be inspiring. And that’s paid off for me.”\n\nAlthough the marriage did not last, she and ex-husband Daniel Smith’s relationship remains positive as they both do their share to raise their son, who is now 9. “We co-parent really well. I’m able to say, ‘I need to finish this album, can you step up and take care of the boy?'” she said.\n\nThe growing pains and Solange’s approach have definitely paid off. Knowles’ name has become synonymous with fearless fashion and she recently became art director and creative consultant role for Puma, while heading super-funky label Saint Records."
