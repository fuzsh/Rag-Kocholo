        "text": "Solange Knowles Allegedly Has A New Boyfriend, Jazz Composer Gio Escobar\n\nIt’s been almost a year since Solange announced her split from her former husband Alan Ferguson. According to Page Six, the singer has moved on with her new boyfriend, jazz composer Gio Escobar.\n\nSolange Knowles posted the photo with her new boo over the weekend on social media, and according to a source close to the singer\n\n“[He] is her boo. People know. It’s not a new thing, but it’s new for the public. It’s a big deal that she shared the photo because she’s so private.”\n\nSolange was linked to the composer back in October 2019, after a video made it’s way to the internet, showing Solange and Gio very close, at lunch, shortly after she announced her split to Alan Ferguson. Solange Knowles married music video director Alan Ferguson in 2014, and they were married for five years. Solange Knowles announced her split from her now ex, Alan Ferguson, last year. They married in 2014. She said in a statement,\n\n“The past 2 years have brought me more physical and spiritual transition and evolution than ever before\n\nmy body left me with no choice but to listen and be still\n\nwithin that stillness i begin my journey in confronting my worst enemy, fear.\n\nive lived my best and worst moments in front of the lens and gaze of the world since i was a teenager. ive always tried to live in my truth no matter how ugly or full of love it is. ive also tried to carve out the space to protect my heart, and my life as it unfolds, evolves, and changes.\n\n11 years ago i met a phenomenal man who changed every existence of my life. early this year we separated and parted ways, (and tho it ain’t nan no body business ?) i find it necessary to protect the sacredness of my personal truth and to live in it fully just as I have before and will continue to do. it is unfair to not have power of your own story as you shape and mold and rewrite it yourself. a nigga ain’t perfect, but im leaning into the fear of the unknown and all the glory and power i know exist within god and the universes grace. may all of your transitions no matter how big or small, be kind to you and filled with incredible love and light!”\n\nThis was the second marriage for Solange. She married her son Julez’s father Daniel Smith when she was 17 and he was 19. They were married for three years. Solange continues to co-parent her son with Daniel.\n\nEarlier this year, there were even rumors that Solange was dating Common. She quickly took to her Instagram stories and appeared to respond to reports that she and Common were dating.\n\nRumors that they were dating sparked amid speculation that he was her date when she received the first-ever Lena Horne Prize for Artists Creating Social Impact."
