        "text": "DANIELLE Smith has been one of the leading politicians in Canada since she made a comeback in 2022 - but this isn't her only skill.\n\nThe United Conservative Party leader has also turned her hand at restaurant owning and runs a quirky diner with her spouse David Moretta.\n\nWho is Danielle Smith?\n\nDanielle Smith is the leader of the United Conservative Party of Canada.\n\nShe was born in Calgary on April 1, 1971, and was the second of five children who lived together in subsidised housing.\n\nDanielle worked the odd job as a TV extra and also had a stint at McDonald's before she gained a degree in English and Economics at the local university.\n\nThe ambitious woman kick-started her career working as a columnist before she went on to host her own radio show which was focused on health policy and property rights.\n\nWhen did Danielle Smith come into power?\n\nThe Canadian entered into the world of politics in 2006 when she supported Progressive Conservative member Ted Morton in his leadership campaign, before she quit to join the Wildrose Alliance in 2009.\n\nAs the Wildrose leader she lost the Alberta election in 2012, as well as subsequent by-elections.\n\nIn December 2014, she rejoined the Progressive Conservative Party.\n\nThe Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta and the Wildrose Party merged to form the United Conservative Party in 2017.\n\nShe worked in politics up to 2015, when she took a break to have a career in media and radio - which she did for seven years until making a comeback in 2022.\n\nDanielle's return to politics was dubbed by CBC as \"one of the most remarkable political comebacks in Canadian history\".\n\nHowever the politician has experienced bumps in the career road and was criticised by a desmog reporter for making \"several misleading statements\" regarding fossil fuel.\n\nWho is Danielle Smith's husband David Moretta?\n\nDavid Moretta is Danielle's second husband - who she met when she was working in radio as he was an executive producer.\n\nThe couple have been together for more than 15 years and were married in 2006.\n\nThey don't have children but have a small fluffy dog named Boot who features on Danielle's Twitter page.\n\nWhilst his wife runs the UCP, David spends his time running several businesses, one of which is a small restaurant which he co-owns with Danielle.\n\nWhat is Danielle's Smith's restaurant?\n\nDespite having busy lives, Danielle and her husband manage to find enough time to run a restaurant.\n\nThe pair own a popular caf√© called The Dining Car which is a cosy spot located in High River, Canada.\n\nThe UCP leader is known to put in the occasional waitress shift at her restaurant and can be seen beaming whilst washing dishes in a snap shared on Twitter.\n\nDanielle captioned the post: \"Fun fact: my husband and I still own a restaurant.\n\n\"This weekend the dishwasher broke down, so I went in for a shift.\"\n\nThe restaurant serves a range of traditional dishes from burgers to pecan pie and has received many five star reviews."
