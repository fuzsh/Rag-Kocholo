        "text": "Beyonce's younger sister divorced husband Daniel Smith in October 2007 - but the split has not put her off exchanging vows in the future.\n\nShe says, \"I'd definitely get married again.\"\n\nAnd Solange, who has a son Daniel Jr. with Smith, would love to follow in the footsteps of stars like Angelina Jolie and Madonna and adopt a child - because growing up with singer Kelly Rowland showed her you don't need to be blood relatives to form sisterly bonds.\n\nShe adds she would love to have more children, \"even if it means adopting\".\n\nShe continues, \"If there are two people devoted to nourishing and growing and developing their love for a child, that is a beautiful thing.\n\n\"Kelly grew up with me since I was about five years old, so she is my sister. She didn't come from my parents, but there is nothing I feel differently for her than my sister. I have definitely explored that option... But I've got to find a man first!\"\n\nRowland moved in with the Knowles family when she joined forces with Beyonce and pals LaTavia Roberson and LeToya Luckett to form the original line-up of Destiny's Child in 1990."
