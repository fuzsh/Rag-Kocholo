        "text": "Solange Knowles and Alan Ferguson have called it quits.\n\nThe 33-year-old singer and sister to Beyonc√© announced she and the 56-year-old music video director she married in Nov. 2014, have \"separated and parted ways.\"\n\nOn Instagram Friday, Knowles wrote that \"the past 2 years have brought me more physical and spiritual transition and evolution than ever before...my body left me with no choice but to listen and be still. within that stillness i begin my journey in confronting my worst enemy, fear.\"\n\nKnowles said she's \"lived (her) best and worst moments in front of the lens and gaze of the world\" since adolescence.\n\n\"ive always tried to live in my truth no matter how ugly or full of love it is,\" she added. \"ive also tried to carve out the space to protect my heart, and my life as it unfolds, evolves, and changes.\"\n\nKnowles then disclosed she and Ferguson have split.\n\n\"11 years ago i met a phenomenal man who changed every existence of my life. early this year we separated and parted ways,\" she wrote. \"i find it necessary to protect the sacredness of my personal truth and to live in it fully just as I have before and will continue to do. it is unfair to not have power of your own story as you shape and mold and rewrite it yourself.\n\n'When I Get Home': Solange's new album is one of 2019's best releases yet\n\nKnowles said she's \"leaning into the fear of the unknown.\"\n\n\"may all of your transitions no matter how big or small, be kind to you and filled with incredible love and light!\" she capped off her post.\n\nSolange Knowles drops surprise album and her mom Tina is so proud\n\nAt their wedding, Knowles and Ferguson both wore ivory, a color also worn by key attendees, including the bride's mother Tina, brother-in-law Jay Z, niece Blue Ivy and big sis Beyonce.\n\nKnowles told Vogue at the time the New Orleans nuptials were a labor of love.\n\nContributing: Associated Press"
