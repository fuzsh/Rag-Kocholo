        "text": "the past 2 years have brought me more physical and spiritual transition and evolution than ever before my body left me with no choice but to listen and be still within that stillness i begin my journey in confronting my worst enemy, fear. ive lived my best and worst moments in front of the lens and gaze of the world since i was a teenager. ive always tried to live in my truth no matter how ugly or full of love it is. ive also tried to carve out the space to protect my heart, and my life as it unfolds, evolves, and changes. 11 years ago i met a phenomenal man who changed every existence of my life. early this year we separated and parted ways, (and tho it ainâ€™t nan no body business ðŸ˜­) i find it necessary to protect the sacredness of my personal truth and to live in it fully just as I have before and will continue to do. it is unfair to not have power of your own story as you shape and mold and rewrite it yourself. a nigga ainâ€™t perfect, but im leaning into the fear of the unknown and all the glory and power i know exist within god and the universes grace. may all of your transitions no matter how big or small, be kind to you and filled with incredible love and light!\n\nA post shared by @ saintrecords on Nov 1, 2019 at 12:18pm PDTNov 1, 2019 at 12:18pm PDT\n\n\"ive lived my best and worst moments in front of the lens and gaze of the world since i was a teenager. ive always tried to live in my truth no matter how ugly or full of love it is,\" she wrote.\n\nSolange went on to add, \"11 years ago i met a phenomenal man who changed every existence of my life. early this year we separated and parted ways, (and tho it ain't nan no body business) i find it necessary to protect the sacredness of my personal truth and to live in it fully just as I have before and will continue to do.\"\n\nSolange tied the knot with Ferguson in November 2014 at New Orleans' Marigny Opera House. The ceremony was attended by friends and family, including Solange's sister BeyoncÃ©, brother-in-law Jay-Z, and niece Blue Ivy.\n\nSolange and Ferguson don't share any children together, although the songwriter has a 15-year-old son whom she shares with ex-husband Daniel Smith."
