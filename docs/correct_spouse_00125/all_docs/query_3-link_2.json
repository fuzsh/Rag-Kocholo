        "text": "WNBA star Skylar Diggins rose to prominence after being selected as the third overall pick during the 2013 WNBA Draft.\n\nAs Skylar continues to make strides in women's basketball, many want to know more about her husband, Daniel Smith.\n\nWho is Skylar Diggins' husband, Daniel Smith?\n\nDaniel Smith was born in South Bend, Indiana, on July 16, 1991.\n\nHe is the son of Vicky and Robert Smith. His father was a businessman and his mother worked in a broadcasting station.\n\nDaniel finished Clay High School and attended the University of Notre Dame.\n\nWhile studying, he played football, and at the time, he was very successful and won many games.\n\nHowever, he suffered an ankle fracture and had to stop playing. That was when he decided to focus on his passion for art.\n\nHe began his art career by selling his artwork online atsonsoftyce.com.\n\nLater on, he designed logos for some clothing brands.\n\nHe now owns Doperman Studios in Dallas, Texas, and his work has also been shown at a music and art festival called Life is Beautiful.\n\nWhen did Skylar Diggins and Daniel Smith get married?\n\nSkylar and Daniel have been together since 2014.\n\nThe couple met and began dating while they were studying at the University of Notre Dame.\n\nIn June 2016, Smith proposed to Skylar during one of his art exhibits. The pair later tied the knot in April 2017.\n\nTheir wedding was held at the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago.\n\nAfter marrying Daniel, she changed her jersey name to Diggins-Smith on the court.\n\nSkylar showed off her jersey on Instagram, captioning it: \"Diggins, a two-time WNBA All-Star and guard for the Dallas Wings, will now go by 'Diggins-Smith.'\"\n\nTo this day, Skylar calls Daniel \"the biggest part of my support system.\"\n\nDo they have children?\n\nSince tying the knot, the pair have welcomed two children.\n\nIn 2019, Skylar gave birth to her son, Seven. The couple chose the name for biblical reasons.\n\nShe and Daniel have decided to keep their son away from the limelight as they do not wish to disclose their son's identity.\n\nThey welcomed a daughter in 2023. However, they have yet to announce her name to the public.\n\nIn an interview with Essence, Skylar revealed Daniel takes care of the children while she tends to her busy schedule during basketball season.\n\n\"My husband [is] the one that takes care of the kids when I'm on the road, when I have to do things,\" she told the outlet.\n\n\"So it's a blessing having a husband who wants to be so hands-on.\"\n\nThough she had a packed itinerary, Skylar said she always knew she wanted to be a mom.\n\n\"I always knew that I wanted a kid while I was playing because I want my kids to see me play,\" she said.\n\n\"I think that that stuff is intangible, you know. When they see you really going after your dreams.\""
