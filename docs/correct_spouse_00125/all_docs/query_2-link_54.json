        "text": "Solange Knowles announced yesterday that she and her husband Alan Ferguson split earlier this year.\n\nThe couple got married back in 2014.\n\nToday in not-so-fun celebrity news, Solange Knowles and her husband of five years, Alan Ferguson, have broken up. Solange and Alan, who is a music video director, got married in a dreamy New Orleans wedding back in 2014 (Beyonc√©, Jay-Z, and Blue Ivy were obviously on the guest list), and have been pretty private about their relationship since.\n\nSolange announced the news of the split on Instagram yesterday, sharing that the two ended their relationship earlier this year. She posted three photos of herself with a long caption, writing:\n\nive always tried to live in my truth no matter how ugly or full of love it is. ive also tried to carve out the space to protect my heart, and my life as it unfolds, evolves, and changes. 11 years ago i met a phenomenal man who changed every existence of my life. early this year we separated and parted ways, (and tho it ain‚Äôt nan no body business üò≠) i find it necessary to protect the sacredness of my personal truth and to live in it fully just as I have before and will continue to do. it is unfair to not have power of your own story as you shape and mold and rewrite it yourself. a nigga ain‚Äôt perfect, but im leaning into the fear of the unknown and all the glory and power i know exist within god and the universes grace. may all of your transitions no matter how big or small, be kind to you and filled with incredible love and light!\n\nSending love to Solange and her family. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
