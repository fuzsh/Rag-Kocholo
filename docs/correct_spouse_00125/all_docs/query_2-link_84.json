        "text": "He liked it, so he put a ring on it (waves hand).\n\nBeyoncé’s sister Solange Knowles has got engaged to video director Alan Ferguson. Page Six reports that the couple plan to marry on Sunday 16 Nov in New Orleans, where Solange and her 10-year-old son Julez live.\n\nApparently, ‘On Friday, guests will unwind with a movie night together before Saturday’s rehearsal dinner. On Sunday, the couple will make it official with a ceremony in front of family and friends.’\n\nWe could’ve guessed that they’d invite their friends and family, but thanks for the heads up. What we really want to know is will Jay Z be there, and exactly how awkward will the family pictures look?\n\nFingers crossed no one gets tiddly on the Champagne and mentions the lift incident in their speech. Actually, fingers crossed that if that does happen one of the guests will have the good grace to record the ensuing chaos and have it uploaded onto Youtube within the hour. Come on Kelly Rowland, we’re pinning all our hopes on you.\n\nThe wedding will be Solange’s second, after she married Julez’s father, Daniel Smith, when she was seventeen.\n\nNo word yet on who the entertainment would be, but if we were Solange we’d be dropping some pretty big hints about how much we love Destiny’s Child deep cuts. Then again, if we were Solange there is no way that we wouldn’t have bullied our way into the band the second LaTivia and LaToya did a runner. Michelle who?"
