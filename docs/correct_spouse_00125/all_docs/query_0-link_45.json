        "text": "Motherhood hasn’t been all roses for Solange.\n\nThe “Losing You” singer had son Julez with then-husband Daniel Smith in February 2004 when she was 18 years old. Shortly afterwards, Beyoncé‘s sister packed up and moved to Moscow, Idaho, to be with Smith, who was in school there, and her career faltered because of it.\n\n“It was one of the most bittersweet moments of my life,” Solange, now 30, told Elle in the magazine’s March issue, on newsstands Feb. 21. “I was so in love with Julez, and having spent a lot of time on the road, I yearned to be in one place, to have the opportunity to really ground myself with him. But it was isolating and lonely, and so cold and dark. And it was just Julez and me most of the time,” she said. “It was hard to imagine being able to progress in my career in any way.”\n\nShe channeled some of that frustration, as well as her own opinions about the world, into her most recent album, “A Seat at the Table.”\n\n“I did want to create this juxtaposition, politically, of having these very hard, messy conversations but having them stylistically in a way that you can really hear me, and not the yelling, the rage,” she explained about her latest effort. “I wanted to project in my delivery what I was not achieving at all: peace and having a certain lightness and airiness that could maybe help me get closer to having more light and airiness in my life.”"
