Are you still married?\n\nSolange Knowles:Well, I am no longer married, but I think it’s very important not to dish details. We are friends and we coparent our son. When he gets older I don’t want him to read anything about me saying anything about his father or vice versa. When there’s a child involved I think the less information given is best.\n\nESSENCE.com: So just to clear things up, how did you two meet?\n\nS.K.: We met at a high school party through mutual friends. He was in high school and I was 13 and in middle school. We were together seven years, so it wasn’t just some random guy. We were basically high school sweethearts.\n\nESSENCE.com: Do you have any regrets about the situation? Did you feel forced or pressured to get married?\n\nS.K.: No, I think every decision has made me who I am today. I’ve embraced everything because I know that only God can give life, no one else. I’m happy that I have a beautiful, wonderful, amazing child who’s made me a better person.\n\nESSENCE.com: Let’s address some of the rumors out there. Apparently, folks believe you left your husband for Lil Wayne. Is that true?\n\nS.K.: (Laughs) That’s absolutely not true. Yes, we know each other but I absolutely did not leave my husband for him.\n\nESSENCE.com: What’s the craziest rumor you’ve heard about yourself?\n\nS.K.: I think the craziest rumor was that my dad paid my son’s father $1 million to marry me. That was everywhere at one time, and that was really funny. I always joke that I wish we had it like that: “Here, take a million dollars, marry her…”\n\nESSENCE.com: So you don’t aspire to your sister’s level of superstardom?\n\nS.K.: No, I don’t want to get that far. (Laughs) I feel really bad for my sister. I’m always like “Oh, let’s go to the mall” or “Let’s go here” and she can’t. I enjoy having that."
