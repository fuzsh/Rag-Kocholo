        "text": "These days, people are quick to label some of the cutest celebrity couples as #goals, but it’s very important to remember that they are people too. Because Solange has no problem keeping it all the way real, the Grammy-winning singer candidly shared a realistic — and relatable — tidbit about her marriage to husband, Alan Ferguson. A fan and Twitter user asked the Houston native about her favorite cocktail, what her #BlackGirlMagic group chats are like, the curse word dearest to her heart, and something she and Alan fight about. “Last thing Alan & I had tension over was because he & Julez went to see Black Panther w out me (I was admittedly really tired but they could’ve waited) but when I went to see it next day w (@internetsyd) they wanted to go again & I wanted to see it w fresh eyes only so said nah.” Hilarious! As for her favorite drink and her lit group chat, the 31-year-old divulged on that information too. Solange and Alan really are #goals!"
