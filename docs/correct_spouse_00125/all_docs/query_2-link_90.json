        "text": "Solange Knowles has married her her partner, video director Alan Ferguson, in a wedding attended by Beyonce and Jay Z.\n\nThe ceremony took place in New Orleans, with the bride and groom arriving on matching white bicycles.\n\nWhite and ivory were the colours of the day, being worn by husband, wife and almost all of the guests.\n\nThe bride's mother Tina Knowles, her 10 year old son Daniel and niece Blue Ivy were also there.\n\nIn May, footage of Solange arguing and fighting with Jay Z in a lift in New York went viral.\n\nAfterwards, the pair, along with Beyonce, said they'd \"moved forward as a united family\" since the incident.\n\nSolange told Vogue magazine: \"Everyone I worked with on the wedding are friends who I love. Everything was a labour of love.\"\n\nThe festivities began on Friday with Solange and Alan treating Beyonce and about 50 of their friends to cinema night at the Indywood movie theatre.\n\nOn the big day the colour theme was pretty strict, with even the vinyl being played by DJ, Roots drummer Questlove, having to be white."
