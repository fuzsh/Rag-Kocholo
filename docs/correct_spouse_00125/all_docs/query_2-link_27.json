Beyonce's little sister and music video director Alan first met 11 years ago and tied the knot in a beautiful ceremony in New Orleans in 2014.\n\nRevealing the news to her social media followers, Solange wrote a heartfelt message saying the pair had gone their separate ways earlier this year.\n\nHer post began: \"The past 2 years have brought me more physical and spiritual transition and evolution than ever before my body left me with no choice but to listen and be still within that stillness I begin my journey in confronting my worst enemy, fear.\"\n\nThe 'Cranes In The Sky' singer said she's spent most of life - the ups and the downs - in the spotlight and she's always tried to \"live in my truth no matter how ugly or full of love it is\".\n\nShe continued: \"11 years ago I met a phenomenal man who changed every existence of my life. early this year we separated and parted ways, (and tho it ainâ€™t nan no body business ðŸ˜­) I find it necessary to protect the sacredness of my personal truth and to live in it fully just as I have before and will continue to do.\"\n\nSigning off, the 33-year-old told fans: \"May all of your transitions no matter how big or small, be kind to you and filled with incredible love and light!\"\n\nSolange and Alan met in 2008 after being introduced by singer Janelle Monae. Speaking about their relationship in 2017, Solange told Interview magazine: \"When I go out in the world, I know that when I come home, Iâ€™m going to find peace with him.\"\n\nSending virtual hugs to Solange and the family.\n\nLike this article?
