        "text": "Solange Knowles is slamming rumors that an affair with her manager, John Bogaard, broke up her marriage.\n\nThe “Cranes in the Sky” singer tagged Bogaard over a paparazzi picture of them together, and wrote on her Instagram Stories, “yo ty @onvacation for bein the best co-manager for 5 yrs. sorry the internetsss are so unkind n b lying. go back to enjoying ya vacation.”\n\nSome speculated that Knowles, 33, cheated with Bogaard after a picture of the pair walking together circulated online.\n\nBogaard has not commented, but is apparently in a relationship. He has shared several photos with a woman named Judith Joy on his social media.\n\nOn Friday, Beyoncé’s younger sister explained her decision to separate from husband Alan Ferguson after 5 years of marriage.\n\nKnowles said the past two years were a period of “physical and spiritual transition,” and the couple decided to part ways earlier this year.\n\nShe said of her decision to speak out, “I find it necessary to protect the sacredness of my personal truth and to live in it fully just as I have before and will continue to do. it is unfair to not have power of your own story as you shape and mold and rewrite it yourself.”"
