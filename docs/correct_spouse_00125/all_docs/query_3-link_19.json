Presumably she died intestate. Unfortunately her deceased husband is not named.\n\nWhile this does not prove that she was the mother of this particular Daniel, there does not appear to be another unaccounted-for Abraham Smith of this age and location. The (attached) 1660 will of Daniel listing \"my brother Abraham Smith\", while it might refer to a religious brother relationship, is at least some indication that Daniel Smith may have been another son of Alice.\n\nPhotographed Primary Sources\n\nDaniel Smith died after July 14, 1660 (the date of his will) and before 24 September 1660 (date of his inventory), in Watertown, Middlesex, Massachusetts[2], leaving widow Elizabeth (Rogers) Smith.[3]\n\nHis will is dated 14 July 1660 and recorded on 10 October 1660 in Middlesex court. His inventory was taken on 24 September 1660 in Watertown.[4]\n\nResearch Notes\n\nOn 23 May 1655 Grace Porter, of Watertowne, 'proferring a petition for power to make sale of a certain house and land left by her deceased husband, hath her petition granted, unless Daniel Smyth, of Watertowne, husband of the daughter of Thomas Rogers, mentioned in the petition, shall... show cause to the contrary... '[5]\n\nThomas Rogers daughter Elizabeth, who married Daniel Smith, was baptized at Dedham 16 Nov 1617. Daniel was baptized 21 Jun 1612, and buried at Dedham 31 Mar 1657. He was a legatee in the will of his grandmother Susan Chapman, and also of his father Daniel Sherman.[6]\n\nThe will of Ann (Sherman) Anger item: 'I give to the two children of the wife of Thomas Rogers, John Sherman and Richard Sherman, my kinsmen, ten shillings apiece' . 'The wife of Thomas Rogers mentioned was Grace Makin, daughter of Tobias Makin of Fingringhoe, Essex. Grace first married John Sherman, who was buried 1616 in Essex County. She then married Thomas Rogers, as Elizabeth Rogers, their daughter, was baptized at Dedham 6 Nov 1617. Elizabeth afterwards married Daniel Smith, at Watertown, Massachusetts.[6]\n\nThomas Rogers left a widow Grace, who married William Palmer, and afterwards Roger Porter, and a daughter Elizabeth, who married Daniel Smith.[7]\n\nGrace, widow of Thomas Rogers, who died in Watertown 12 Nov 1638, married William Palmer. Grace and Martha (wife of Captain John Sherman) were mentioned in William's will. After he died Grace returned to Watertown and married thirdly Roger Porter. Elizabeth, wife of Daniel Smith, was a daughter by Grace's first husband, Thomas Rogers (Colonial Records, col iv, p 232). [8]\n\nElizabeth Rogers of Watertown, daughter of ... Grace Porter by her former husband, Thomas Rogers, married Daniel Smith of Watertown.[9]\n\nDaniel Smith ...
