        "text": "American singer and younger sibling Beyonce, Solange Knowles has announced the end of her five year marriage to Alan Ferguson. The two reportedly spilit earlier in the year and Solange says she is \"spiritually transitioning\" into the next phase of her life, without giving specifics into what caused the marriage to end.\n\n\"The past 2 years have brought me more physical and spiritual transition and evolution than ever before\n\nmy body left me with no choice but to listen and be still\n\nwithin that stillness i begin my journey in confronting my worst enemy, fear.\" she wrote on Instagram, adding that \"11 years ago i met a phenomenal man who changed every existence of my life. early this year we separated and parted ways, (and tho it ainâ€™t nan no body business ðŸ˜­) i find it necessary to protect the sacredness of my personal truth and to live in it fully just as I have before and will continue to do.\"\n\nSolange appears to have taken a different route to her sister's whose famous marital problems were worked through, leading her to continue being married to Jay Z. Solange and Ferguson got married in 2014, after her first marriage. She has a fifteen year old son from her first marriage which ended in 2017."
