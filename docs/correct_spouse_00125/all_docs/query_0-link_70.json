        "text": "Over the weekend, the internet was ablaze with rumors suggesting that Solange Knowles is not the primary caretaker of her 19-year-old son, Daniel Julez Smith Jr. According to these unverified claims, Julez is supposedly being raised by Solange’s cousin, Angela Beyincé, known as Angie.\n\nThe allegations, seemingly originating from an internet troll, took a jab at Solange’s parenting, stating, “Solo hasn’t looked over Juelz since 2014. She is completely disconnected from that child. Juelz lives with Angie. Without Daniel Sr. Stepping n out of. Yea, I said it.”\n\nAnother individual lent credence to the allegations, with one person citing a TikTok revelation from Julez about his complicated relationship with his mother. The claim asserted that Julez hasn’t lived with Solange full-time in years.\n\n“Y’all mad in these comments but she is definitely not lying. He told someone on TikTok a while ago that his relationship with his mom is complicated. He hasn’t lived with her full time in YEARS. Never cared enough to figure out why but, I do hope it’s for a good reason.”\n\nIn response to the rumors, both Solange and Julez Smith took to social media to share their perspectives. Julez used his Instagram stories to post a song by Master P titled “Mama raised Me,” possibly conveying a message about his upbringing. He also shared a heartfelt photo of his mother with the caption “My whole heart.”\n\nSolange, on the other hand, addressed the rumors indirectly on Twitter by liking a comment that dismissed the claims as false and urged people to focus on their own lives.\n\nThe liked post expressed, “This is a lie. y’all really need to get your own lives. it’s sickening and scary that people sit online and do this.”"
