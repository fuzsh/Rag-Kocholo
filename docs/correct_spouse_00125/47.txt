Solange Knowles, Beyonce's younger sister, is a married woman.

Knowles, 28, tied the knot with 51-year-old video director Alan Ferguson in New Orleans on Sunday.

Among the 200 family members and friends attending were big sis Beyonce and husband Jay Z, with daughter Blue Ivy in tow. Mom Tina Knowles and son Daniel Julez, 10, also attended. Celebrity guests included singer Janelle Monae and musician friends Kelela, Questlove and Kindness, who performed at the reception.

"Everyone I worked with on the wedding are friends who I love," Knowles told Vogue by email earlier in the day. "Everything was a labor of love."

The bride and groom arrived at the ceremony on vintage white-painted bicycles decorated with cream roses. Knowles wore a cream pantsuit with plunging neckline and cape by Stephane Rolland, according to the magazine.
