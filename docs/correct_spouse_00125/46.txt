Solange Knowles Ex Hubby Makes Rare Public Appearance

Over the weekend, Solange Knowles’ ex husband, Daniel Smith, whom she shares a child with (Daniel Julez), made a rare ‘public’ appearance of sorts.

He was spotted at their son, Julez’s, 12th birthday party in LA. Solange’s mother, Tina Lawson, was in attendance and shared a few photos.

While we’re told Daniel is very active in raising their son, he remains out of the spotlight. Solange and Daniel married in February 2004 when she was 17 and he was 19. In October, Solange gave birth to their son, Daniel Julez Judo Smith, Jr.

Solange, who recently released her highly successful album ‘A Seat At the Table‘, has partly expressed regret that she had a child at an early age, but calls her son the greatest unplanned blessing.

A song she wrote for her baby, “6 O’Clock Blues”, was included on Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams. After Daniel Julez’s birth, the family moved to Moscow, Idaho, where Solange’s then husband continued studying in college. They later split and Solange confirmed their divorce in 2007.

Solange, Julez, and her husband Alan Ferguson now live in New Orleans, Louisiana. Anywho, we love co-parenting coolness!
