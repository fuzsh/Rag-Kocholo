Director Jacques Feyder’s 1935 La kermesse héroïque [Carnival in Flanders] is a bright French romantic comedy adventure that puts a bawdy spin on the story of the Spanish invasion of Flanders, in which 17th-century Flemish women of the village of Boom stoop to conquer the invading Spaniards after the the four-man army deserts and the Burgomaster plays dead. Françoise Rosay stars as the Burgomaster’s wife Cornelia de Witte, who organises the townswomen to greet the invaders and keep the peace with their female frolics.

La kermesse héroïque is famed for its rousing performances (from Françoise Rosay, Louis Jouvet, André Alerme and Jean Murat), an amusing screenplay (by Charles Spaak, Bernard Zimmer, Robert A Stemmle and Jacques Feyder), as well as lovely production designs (by Lazare Meerson) and costumes (designed by Georges K Benda) in the manner of the artist Julien Breughel (who is portrayed in the film by Bernard Lancret).

Feyder won the award for Best Director at the Venice Film Festival in 1936 and La kermesse héroïque was voted Best Foreign Language Film by the New York Film Critics in 1937.

Also in the cast are Alfred Adam, Lyne Clevers, Ginette Gaubert, Pierre Labry, Alexander D’Arcy and Micheline Cheirel.

La kermesse héroïque is based on a short story by Charles Spaak, with dialogue by Bernard Zimmer, and uncredited writing by Jacques Feyder and Robert A Stemmle.

Apparently, it was first APPROVED and then CONDEMNED by the Catholic Legion of Decency, which made for very good, teasing advertising.

It was released on DVD by BFI Video in the UK in 2004.
