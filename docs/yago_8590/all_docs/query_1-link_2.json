The inhabitants of the small town of Boom are busy organizing the annual local festivities when the arrival of the Duke of Olivares, who rules the country on behalf of the King Philip III of Spain, is announced.

        "text": "Carnival in Flanders (La Kermesse heroique, 1936) is unusual in many ways. How many films dealing with the occupation of a city by elements of an invading army are comedies? How many movies have ever been set in Seventeenth Century Flanders? Where the heck is Flanders? (For those not knowing the answer to the last question, Flanders is the Dutch-speaking northern portion of today’s Belgium.)\n\nThe year is 1616 and Spain has invaded and occupied the Low Countries. A courier brings news to the village of Boom that a contingent of the enemy army will spend the night within its walls. Envisioning pillage and rapine, the male Boomers (Boomites?) go into hiding. The cowardly burgomaster decides to fake being dead,…\n\nA delightful farce, in which all the men are cowards, and the women save the day. I guess some things will never change.\n\nSet in 17th century Flanders, the local honoraries get scared when a Spanish duke announces his visit with his army for an upcoming carnival. While the mayor, who fears looting and pillaging, suggests he could fake his death to keep them away, the town's women decide to greet the visitors with hospitality, and the result is a joyful romp for everyone involved - including the audience.\n\nOn top of being a ton of fun, La Kermesse héroïque also has impeccable costumes and set designs.\n\nThe Flanders women have balls! Am amusing tale of female wit and intellect when their men fail them as their town is invaded by foreign powers. I've loved other Jacques Feyder films more, but La kermesse héroïque [Carnival in Flanders] (1935) is another compliment to his long list of quality films. A fine example of the comic tone that existed in French film making before the war.\n\nCriterion Challenge 2023\n\nProgress: 52/52\n\nPrompt: 1930s\n\nDiverting farce. The citizens of Flanders are facing a delegation of Spaniards. Fearing rape, murder, and torture, the men all go to pieces. The women, however, led by the burgomaster’s wife played by Françoise Rosay, who marshals everyone into a new plan.\n\nI really liked this. I particularly enjoyed a film that had no problem showing women having sex with men not their spouses with no dire consequences. Lots of really clever touches in the screenplay. Incredible costumes and sets. And it’s funny as hell.\n\nWhat I did not consider was the context around the film at the time. Made when fascism was very definitely on the rise and when the Nazis were beginning their attempt at conquering Europe, well, now I get why this might have been received with some uneaee.\n\nA feminist comedy of manners where the potential horrors of Spanish occupiers are thwarted by booze, music, food and sex, Carnival in Flanders may be set in modern day Belgium but it doesn't get much more French than this. It's all delightfully farcical as the town's women, following the cowardice of their male counterparts including the mayor, who decides to play dead, take charge of welcoming the Spanish for their supposed one-night stay, killing them with kindness to the growing frustration of their Flemish husbands and lovers. More charming than insightful, it's nonetheless a consistently fresh and amusing film boasting perhaps the worst pair of pants ever committed to celluloid.\n\nI’ve just seen this film for a second time. The first time was back in the first half of the 1970s: it was one of the first foreign language films I had seen and was part of a BBC series called something like Masterpieces of World Cinema. I doubt if this would ever be included in such a series today: its reputation has dwindled over the years (and even in the early 1970s it is quite surprising to find it acclaimed). But it was acclaimed when it was first released, seen as a major French film of its period, and Jacques Feyder was placed alongside Renoir and Carné and Duvivier: no doubt he still has his admirers but they are…"
