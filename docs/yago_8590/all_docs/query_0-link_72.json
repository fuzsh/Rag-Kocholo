        "text": "The John Golden Theatre, 202 West Fifty-eighth Street, where once played \"Strange Interlude,\" \"Ned McCobb's Daughter\" and such like, has struck its colors to the cinema, and became last night the Filmarte, dedicated to the exhibition of outstanding pictures from abroad. Let us note at once that the Filmarte's first offering comes easily within the distinguished category mentioned in the theatre's dedication. \"La Kermesse Heroique,\" which bears the subtitle \"Carnival in Flanders,\" is an outstanding picture by any standards save those of strict moralists and stricter religionists.A sly, gay and impious farce, typically Gallic in its conception and execution, it whipped its way past the State Board of Censors before that august body had time to recover from the news that the photoplay had received the Grand Prix du Cinema Français and some sort of a gold medal award of the Venice International Exposition of Cinematography. At first, we are reliably informed, the State Board had banned it outright. But then, hearing about its international honors, it reconsidered and leaned so far backward in its charity that the de Maupassant flavor of the piece has miraculously, been preserved. Which is all to the good and will, no doubt, reflect undeserved credit upon New York's guides to filmic morals.Jacques Feyder, its director, and a completely heroic cast which includes Alerme, the Frank Morgan of France; Françoise Rosay of the Théâtre National, Jean Murat and Louis Jouvet, have worked comic marvels with the story. The place is Boom, a Belgian village, and the time is 1616, after Philip of Spain has conquered Flanders. The Burgomaster and his Aldermen are posing for their portrait in the Town Hall; the Burgomaster's daughter is pining for the Flemish painter; the butcher, and honored Alderman, has obtained the Burgomaster's consent to his marriage with the daughter in exchange for a beef contract; the Burgomaster's wife has promised to protect the lovely Siska from so unwelcome a husband.Then come the Spaniards! An insolent courier brings word that a battalion, led by their noble Duke, will spend the night in Boom. The Flemish burghers are panic-stricken: there will be murder, arson, the rack and dishonor to their women. So the stout but shaking Burgomaster conceives a stratagem: he will pretend he is newly deceased, Boom will go into mourning, the men-folk into hiding and the Spaniards, out of respect for the dead, will go their way in peace. But the women of Boom decide otherwise. Their husbands out of sight, they welcome the Duke and his men with true Flemish—or would it be Gallic—hospitality and the invaders are cheered as they resume their journey while the men come out of hiding to take full credit for Boom's heroic defense.A delightfully satirical libel upon the city of Boom and its masculine inhabitants, the film has achieved a delicate balance between broad farce and subtle humor which makes it one of the most refreshing and witty pictures of the year. Technically, it is equal, if not superior, to anything Hollywood has turned out this season. On a performance basis, Alerme's mock heroic portrait of the Burgomaster is superb, Louis Jouvet's sardonic characterization of the friar a model of comic implication, Mile. Rosay's lively sketch of the Burgomaster's wife thoroughly delightful and Jean Murat's gallant Spanish grandee suavely perfect. The minor rôles are excellently served by an appreciative cast. And do not, we beg you, be dissuaded from seeing it because the dialogue is in French. Even without the many English subtitles, \"La Kermesse Heroique\" would be clearly understood; like all great comedies, it speaks a universal language.Also on view at the Filmarte is the first of that anonymously produced series of pro-labor films which are being bootlegged out of Hollywood. \"Millions of Us\" is its name and, like most propaganda pictures, it reduces the questions of capital and labor, production and distribution, strike and lookout to their simplest terms. Still, it has been well made and may serve as an instructive, if one-sided, primer of labor thought.\n\nLA KERMESSE HEROIQUE, from a story by Charles Spaak; screen play by Bernard Zimmer; music by Louis Beydts; directed by Jacques Feyder; a Tobis production.
