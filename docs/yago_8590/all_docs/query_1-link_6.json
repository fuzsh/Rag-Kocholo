Fearing carnage and rape, the mayor decides to play dead in the hope that the fearful occupiers will respect the townspeople’s mourning and bypass Boom. But the mayor’s wife has an alternative solution. . . .\n\nThe enduring miracle of director Jacques Feyder’s supremely elegant costume entertainment is that it succeeds in balancing witty farce and intimate character comedy in grandiose settings (inspired by the Flemish masters) more suited to the ‘cast-of-thousands’ action spectacular.

Feyder had the technical skill, cosmopolitan elegance and taste to make this one of the French cinema’s crown jewels. And in doing so, he offered his own wife, Françoise Rosay, the greatest role of her career as Cornelia, the mayor’s wily and humane spouse.."
