It's a politically dubious anti-war satire in which the bourgeois ladies of a town in 17th-century Flanders disarm the Spanish invaders with sex, good food and other domestic comforts while their husbands hide. Their leader is the mayor's wife, a Lysistrata figure played by the imposing Françoise Rosay. The plot depends on the enemy being kind and harmless, and it ends up as a handbook for collaborationists. Except for Louis Jouvet as a crafty Spanish priest, there is little laughter-producing comedy, but the movie, which resembles paintings by Dutch masters, is beautifully designed by Lazare Meerson."
