        "text": "This weekend found me watching two movies that couldn’t be less alike. Their only commonality is their running time – excessive.\n\nI’ll take on the newest first, Deadpool and Wolverine. Its reviews were all over the map. Michael Phillips gave it a scathing pan and a single star. The gist of his column was that this flic embodies exactly what is killing decent, modestly budgeted films – bloated, mindless slogs through non-stop violence aimed at teenage boys.\n\nThe Times, and my friend, Tom, were much kinder. The Times gave it a full four stars, and Tom found it laugh out loud funny, as did his fellow audience of teenage boys.\n\nI doubt I’d have gone to see it, but my friend, Tim, was eager to do so, and I’m always eager for his company, so I put on my Captain America t-shirt, and off we went. My reaction was closer to Phillips’, though I’d give it another half star. I like Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman, and I found the first Deadpool movie amusing, but this one is a long, hollow shell encrusted with satire and snarky irony. Instead of a plot, you get an endless series of battles to the death between two characters who cannot die, and hundreds of their foes who can. Since the principals are immortal, their clawings and stabbings at each other are impossible to care about. What kept me awake were the occasional flashes of wit, and the odd sword flying at me in 3D IMAX. Ah well, I’d watch worse to spend time with Tim.\n\nThe other picture was The Green Years, from 1946. My mother took me to see it at the Avalon when it came out. I was eleven and didn’t like it much. I came away thinking it was way too long, and there was a scene that upset me greatly. Someone gets his leg caught in a railroad track as a locomotive bears down on him – never a favorite plot point of mine.\n\nWhat I was too callow to appreciate then was what a festival of strong supporting actors it contained. Turner offered it last week, and this time I couldn’t stop watching it. It’s from a best seller by A. J. Cronin who had a string of them made into movies in the 30’s and 40’s, including Hatter’s Castle, The Citadel, and Keys of the Kingdom.\n\nThe Green Years is basically a soap opera, but the screenplay preserves many of the novel’s tasty situations and turns of phrase. This time around, I noticed it was by Robert Ardrey. I was a college classmate of his seriously handsome son, Ross. But I digress.\n\nVictor Saville is a decent director, (and who can do anything with Tom Drake?), but for me, the real credit for the success of the picture must go to the casting director, Benny Thau. He drew on a small army of solid supporting actors, cast many of them against type, let them out for a run from their usual confines, and they reward him handsomely.\n\nThau was at MGM forever. He outlasted Louis B. Mayer, Dory Shary, and just about everyone else on the lot. He worked with Garbo. He worked with Elvis. Actors loved him, and he loved them back. His casting couch was notorious, and his mistresses are said to have included Greer Garson.\n\nFor the young lead in the first half of “Green,” Thau chose Dean Stockwell. Stockwell never played cute as did. say, Jackie Cooper. He had an adult’s acting chops right from the start. His scenes with Gladys Cooper are a believable joy because of his restraint. Unfortunately, at the midpoint, he grows up to be that bland cypher, Tom Drake.\n\nWith that exception, (since they were at the studio, better to have gotten some charisma and gone with Robert Walker or Van Johnson), Thau cast every role smartly, and for maximum effect. Gladys Cooper is a treat in an earthy part, far from her usual imperious patricians. Just watch her, stripping off petticoat after petticoat to find the material that becomes the boy’s ghastly green flowered suit. And watch Stockwell’s eyes and hands as they lie together in the dark, and she disabuses him of his grandfather’s legends. They work magic together.\n\nRichard Haydn too gets let off his usual leash of prissy sissy to play perhaps the best part he was ever given, the disillusioned but caring schoolmaster. He seems grateful to behave on screen like an actual adult from this planet. Sadly, the next year it would be back to the rote mincing snippery in Sitting Pretty.\n\nSelena Royle gets a chance to shine, as does Jessica Tandy, especially in the chocolate box scene,, and Hume Cronyn does well as a penny pincher straight out of Dickens.\n\nThe star of the proceedings is not the young man beset by adversity, but his mellow, drunken grandfather. For once in his career, Charles Coburn is given a lead and he makes the most of it. I’m glad Thau didn’t go with Charles Laughton, or Cecil Kellaway, who had already portrayed such characters. Coburn’s specialty was wittily acid patriarchs, and it’s a gratifying surprise to see him get down and dirty. For this he was nominated but for a supporting Oscar, despite having more screen time than anyone, and being the character who holds the story together.\n\nLike Deadpool and Wolverine, it goes on too long, but the adult me found much to enjoy in The Green Years.\n\nIt’s been a good while since I’ve written here. Nothing in my placid life seemed to justify a blog. What follows, then, is a meandering miscellany intended to keep my hand in.\n\nThere was, of course, our political roller coaster, about which I have plenty to say, but nothing that hasn’t been said already, many times over. It was certainly a popular topic on Facebook. One fellow posted so much vitriol that at last I had to unfriend him. He was a student of John’s, so I hated to do it, (to say nothing of how it feeds my vanity to have a large number of friends), but each day, his snide mockery of people I respect made me feel bad. He had to go.\n\nLosing a virtual friend was compensated by gaining two actual friends, neighbors who stopped to admire the garden and stayed to chat. Possessed of wit and charm, they encouraged me to drop in for a glass of wine. I knew they were serious the next day when a bottle of good wine and a sweet note appeared at my door. It seems this geezer still has it.\n\nThen there was the exasperating ending of this season on Professor T. The writers killed off my favorite character, played by the beauteous and talented Emma Naomi. It’s such a cliche to have the grim reaper nip an endearing romance in the pre-nuptial bud. This is becoming a predictable and unwelcome staple of detective series.\n\nEmma Naomi\n\nI was so annoyed that I felt like writing the station to vent my displeasure. What a treat it had been to look at Naomi’s pretty and expressive features. Her eyes and slight smile conveyed that she knew what you were up to but didn’t especially mind.\n\nEmma Naomi is just the sort of girl I had crushes on all the way through college. Yes, I had straight crushes until I finally sorted out the life I actually had to live.\n\nShe’s still there to be savored in Bridgerton where again she’s my favorite character. I heartily wish her the fulfilling career she deserves. Let’s get that slyly seductive face up on the big screen.\n\nOne of my very favorite films has always been Carnival in Flanders or, in the original French, La Kermisse Heroique. Thanks to a striking poster, I now know the Swedes called it Hertigen onskar Natikvarten.\n\n“Carnival” is beautifully acted, especially by its illustrious lead, Francoise Rosay, wife of the gifted director, Jacques Feyder. It is also brilliantly designed by Lazare Meersen whose sets echo many fine old Flemish paintings. Full justice is done to these clever sets by the shrewd cinematography of Harry Stradling who, after a number of films with Feyder, had great success in America, culminating, to my mind, in his powerful work on A Streetcar Named Desire.\n\nI mention these contributors to the whole because each brings a sensibility that sharpens the enjoyment of this delicious movie. I must note one more, the costume designer, Georges Benda. His cunning outfits, particularly for the women, are both apt and amusing.\n\nOnce, as I was leaving England, I found a DVD of “Carnival.” I snapped it up, but back in the states, I discovered it could only be played in Europe. Fudge.\n\nI had to have the poster when it was offered at auction, but what came turned out to be too big for my changeable frame, unlike previous Swedish posters, which I love for their graphics. I thought I’d just store it away and take it out to admire from time to time, but gradually I decided it deserved a frame of its own, despite my lack of wall space.\n\nI went with Lois to Michael’s, where we have great confidence in the woman who heads the framing department. The poster excited her, and she offered a number of suggestions, some, of course, more costly than the poster itself. I pondered the lot until Lois gave her usual sensible advice, “Which will bring you joy?” Naturally, it was the most expensive of them all.\n\nA week or so later, Tim, renowned in the region for his expert hanging of anything, went with me to pick up both that frame and a much smaller one of a piece of sheet music for “It’s Magic,” the one song I’d like my friends to play after I’m gone. Ann knew how much I liked it, and imported it from London.\n\nMagical Doris.\n\nThe girl who waited on us looked at my name and said, “Did you teach at Washington High?” I did. She grew quite animated and said, “I didn’t have you, but my best friend did. He still talks about how much he loved your class. He bought your book! Do you mind if I take your picture? He’ll be so excited.” I didn’t mind; in fact, it made my day.\n\nOnce home, I helped Tim move some tables and bric-a-brac away from the wall where the poster would hang, and what should we discover but a small dead mouse. Hmmm.\n\nI’d been afraid that the large frame would overwhelm the space, and I hated to lose any of the desert scene on the walls. By positioning it off to the side and nestled by a palm tree, Tim found the perfect spot for it. It looks as though it always belonged there.\n\nWelcome to my lair, “Hertigen.” By any name, you have a place in my home and my heart.\n\nIf the course of true love never did run smooth, it is particularly perilous in two movies I saw this weekend. Both were worth watching.\n\nOn the spur of the moment, Darlene and I decided to go see The Fall Guy because of its leads, Ryan Gosling and Emily Blunt. My hopes of seeing Gosling shirtless were met soon and often. The film is an ode to stunt men, and demands so prolonged and strenuous a suspension of disbelief, that it’s best not even to try. One example may give you the idea. Gosling expertly steers a power boat through a hail of bullets, facing away from the wheel with his hands tied behind him.\n\nIt’s like that throughout, so I just sat back and gave in to the nuttiness. The picture works because A) the stunts are ingeniously entertaining, and B) the core of the film is a compelling romance between a couple whose chemistry made it impossible for me not to root for them. This wacky opus is securely grounded by what goes on, even unspoken, between Blunt and Gosling. It’s in the eyes. The plot is non-stop frantic mayhem, but they make it work so well that your questions just evaporate.\n\nOn the other hand, The Hit Man is a model of logical plotting, loosely based on actual events. The premise is a natural. A nerdy philosophy teacher is moonlighting for the police who value his technical expertise. They attempt to forestall murders by using a cop as a fake hit man. One night, a snafu leads the police to pressure our timid hero (deliciously played by Glen Powell), to step in for the errant and unavailable cop. Released from being himself, he proves so resourceful and effective that his successes outstrip his predecessor. Any possible improbability is overcome by a realistic screenplay and smart dialogue.\n\nSo far so good, but what Hit Man has in common with Fall Guy is its engaging love story, played by an ultra charismatic Powell and Adria Arjona. She tries to hire him to rid her of an abusive husband, and Powell, instantly smitten, dissuades her, much to the annoyance of the police who, listening on a wire, hoped to entrap her.\n\nGlen Powell and Adria Arjona\n\nGary, Powell’s character, adopts a different look and manner for each potential client, researching what type of hit man would most entice and convince each new potential perp (with most amusing results). This time, his sexy commanding “Ron” proves so alluring that they melt into a very steamy affair. Then her husband is killed. You aren’t sure who’s responsible, and you don’t really care. The suspense of the final scenes had me on the edge of my rocker. Powell is quite a find. He’s so good here that his future as a leading man seems assured.\n\nBoth of these films happily rewarded me with characters to care about and actors to ensure that I did.\n\nMany of my dreams are about getting lost – really quite a lot of them. Last night, for a while, that’s where I thought my dream was headed, but then it swerved into something lovely that I was grateful to be dreaming.\n\nJohn and I were attending a fund raising function for the restoration of the Paramount theater, in Hammond, Indiana, where John had once taken me to see Fame, one of the last films shown there before it closed. He shared my love of those old palaces, and we were happy at the prospect of the Paramount rising again.\n\nThis dream had something going for it that I particularly liked. John was not just a silent observer as he had been in so many dreams before. No, in this one, he was more of a presence, actually talking to me.\n\nThe presentation ended, and we filed out onto the street to wait for our ride. In the dream, this was Greg, my masseur, who seemed to have forgotten us. I tried to call him, but John spotted people he knew, and crossed the street to chat with them. He came back to tell me they would drive us home. He was smiling and in a very good mood.\n\nWell, my dreams are never without plot complications, and I realized I’d left my back prop in the theater. I’ve had back issues for fifty years, and this prop is not something I dared leave behind. I used to lug around an attaché case filled with several heavy books to support my back in soft or iffy chairs. In time, the ever resourceful Mickey measured the angle of my back and used balsam wood to create a much lighter and more manageable prop for me. In any case, my forgetfulness meant that everyone would have to wait while I went back to retrieve it.\n\nMy back prop.\n\nHere’s where my dreams normally go really south. The theater was deserted now, and the main entrance was closed. I had to walk around the building in hopes of finding another way in. I was able to push open a door, but immediately found myself stumbling over a maze of construction. I managed to get back into the auditorium, but by this time, I was worried about how annoyed John might be.\n\nJust then,he was at my side. He had followed me in, not wanting me to get lost. He took my arm and smiled at me with a look of deep affection and amused forbearance. I felt safe, and loved, and I knew everything would be alright. For once, I was sorry to wake up.\n\nThe passing of the year finds me, like many others, in a reflective mood. I wish to make the most, or at least much, of what remains to me. Time, of course, which, now that I’m as old as the hills, accelerates at a dizzying pace. But also people. 2023 has not been kind in that respect. It knocked around many people I care about. I survive with only minor bruises, but a relative especially dear to me lies in mortal danger as I write this.\n\nI’ve known her all her life and longer than anyone else in mine. We share memories of things no one else has seen. We are what makes lifelong friends so comfortable, so valuable: witnesses to each other’s lives. I pray she doesn’t suffer; yet, when she is gone, all that we knew goes with her, and I am incomplete.\n\nOther friends are fragile, hospitalized, or at risk of being so. A good day now is one in which I hear no bad news of them. Knocking wood in puzzlement at my own good health, I thank my parents for bequeathing me both sturdy genes and the discipline not to undermine them. It helps, of course, not to have an addictive personality, though I confess I never met a cuisine I didn’t like.\n\nI’m fortunate too with the doctors in my life, particularly a new one, a cardiologist who is among the smartest, most charismatic people I’ve met. He came highly recommended, and as to his bedside manner, let’s just say I want to marry him and bear his children. Will I follow his advice? You betcha.\n\nThis year leaves me frightened not only for the health of my friends and family, but for that of this divided nation. Never since I’ve been alive, never, I believe in our history, has so much depended on the outcome of an election, (and its possible aftermath).\n\nThankfully, I have the distractions of books, music, and movies. I would add theater, but the pandemic makes me reluctant to resume that habit of a lifetime, though I’m tempted by the reviews for Boop. Christmas brought a welcome array of novels, biographies, and Eddie Muller‘s handsome revision of The Art of Noir.\n\nOne of my favorite times between the covers has been Reynaldo Hahn’s memoirs of Sarah Bernhardt. Hahn knew everyone in fin de siecle Paris, and was a chum (with benefits) of Marcel Proust. What a treat to follow the antics of this extraordinary group. It led me to order several CDs of Hahn’s music.\n\nMovies, on the whole, were a bit more interesting than in recent years, and I have some catching up to do. The last two I streamed were Maestro and Saltburn. Maestro may be overlong, and yes, there are things I would tweak about Cooper‘s performance (mainly the forced effect of his voice in a lower register), but Carey Mulligan is simply dazzling, and not to be missed. It’s certainly not the bore that some social media sites are ranting about.\n\nFull of twists and surprises, Saltburn is well cast and acted, especially by Barry Keoghan, who does the nicest little naked dance through room after room that you’d ever want to see.\n\nMornings, if I’m careful to avoid news of endless, merciless wars, new legal barriers to reasonable freedoms, and crime close to home, the paper lifts my spirits with a tricky crossword and the funnies, notably “Pickles,” “Brewster Rockit, Space Guy,” and “Mutts,” (the fate of Guard Dog had me on the edge of my rocker for weeks).\n\nFinally, this was the year I got up my nerve to travel again. Back in Mexico, to the spot where John and I went so often, I basked in the company of friends I’d begun to fear I’d never see again. But I did!\n\nAnd so, Happy – or at least less scary – New Year to us all.\n\nFull disclosure: the book I’m about to tout was written by a friend. I first encountered Dan Callahan eleven years ago when, either for Christmas or my birthday, John gave me a copy of Barbara Stanwyck, the Miracle Woman. I ‘d never read anything like it. This was not a biography, rather a surgical, film by film analysis of her entire career.\n\nDan examined in detail the physical elements of Stanwyck’s talent – voice, gestures, movement, and how she adapted them to suit each new role. I was so impressed that I had to write him. He wrote back, and we entered into an ongoing conversation about acting, movies, and life.\n\nSince then, Dan has written six more books, and I’ve loved them all. I’ve written one, for which he penned an enthusiastic blurb to grace the back cover and entice potential readers. So there you are, all sorts of vested interests and conflicts of same.\n\nBe that as it may, I feel that his latest book, Bing and Billie and Frank and Ella and Judy and Barbra, is his very best. This time, he casts his analytical eye on six of America’s greatest singers. The research involved is staggering and rewarding. He explores their gifts, their styles, their interactions, (there were many), the waxing and waning of their powers, their influence on American music, their lives and times, and their personalities.\n\nThese are bigger than life characters, and though their talents are magical, their behavior was often less than angelic. In that respect, Ella Fitzgerald comes off as the most civilized, even tempered, and caring of the six.\n\nI saw two of them in live performance, one at the dawn of her career, and one as darkness descended. Barbra Streisand was late enough at McCormick Place to antagonize the audience, but once she began to sing, all was forgiven. Judy Garland was late too, at Lyric Opera, but we expected that and were relieved she showed up at all. Her voice was in shreds, but not her phrasing or showmanship.\n\nMost people know Bing Crosby as the laid back, feel good dispenser of calm, comfort, and holiday good will that he eventually became. I prefer the earlier sexy, bad boy torch singer of the 30’s. Dan covers both eras thoroughly.\n\nIn contrast to Crosby’s baritone, Frank Sinatra‘s tenor was just as potent and interesting with the rough edges of age as he had been as the fresh voiced dreamboat of bobby soxers. And what a life he led on the way.\n\nMost dramatic and turbulent of all are the life and career of Billie Holiday. It’s amazing she survived as long as she did. Dan does justice to her struggles with racism, men, her mother, and her own inner demons. There has never been a voice so drenched in rueful wisdom, but then at times with utter joie de vivre.\n\nIf you care about The Great American Songbook and the singers who kept it alive, you’re going to love this book.\n\nSteve and Johnnie became creatures of the night long ago. For years, their program was a beacon of life, music, and laughter for night owls of every stripe. Now, in semi retirement, they do occasionally see the sun, but it was in deepest darkness that they drove here recently for Steve’s birthday.\n\nI had gone to bed and was unaware of their arrival. I’m sure they made an attempt to enter quietly, but noise won’t awaken me, (it’s been tried), though light always does. No, it wasn’t until mid morning that I knew they had actually come. The three of us were still clad in our sleepware – they in stylish pajamas, and I in – oh, never mind. And thus garbed, we remained for much of the next several days.\n\nBreakfast at such times is a long, leisurely affair, festooned with course after course of Johnnie’s deft devising. We don’t solve the world’s problems any more, (could you?), but they do come up. Mostly, we groan at the groaning board, and laugh ourselves silly.\n\nI never mean to, but I often seem to put Johnnie to work undoing my latest tech-world screw ups. This time, it involved passport complications that led to her battling recalcitrant phone robots for what seemed like hours, She won. She always does.\n\nShe gifted both of us with shaving cuffs. I don’t know where she finds these things. I’d never heard of them, but they instantly solved a perpetual grooming annoyance. I won’t go into detail, except to say that no man who doesn’t use an electric shaver should be without them. Curiously, mine were pink. Had I had them in time, I could have worn them to see Barbie. It would have looked like Barbie bondage.\n\nA shaving cuff\n\nWatching my brother open Johnnie’s gifts to him, and reading the tender messages on her cards, (one is never enough), I was moved to realize how well this marriage has worn, and how right it was from the beginning.\n\nOne night, when I intended to show them a double feature of noir they’d never seen – The Big Clock and The Mask of Dimitrios – there was a debacle with my DVD player, so we talked instead. We’re good at that. We’re good at contented silences, too.\n\nS&J retired, planning to nap and then, in the middle of the night, (as Longfellow put it in “When Day is Done”) fold their tents like the Arabs, and quietly steal away.\n\nBut that didn’t happen. Morning found them still here, well slept. More pajama time, another breakfast, more exquisite silliness.\n\nIt’s so helpful when you don’t just love your family, but actually like them.\n\nI’ve been going back to the movies pretty fearlessly of late. In the past fortnight, I’ve seen three of the pictures people are talking about. Being a people, I herewith talk.\n\nTim and I thought Mission Impossible, whatever its current sequel number, might be worth seeing in IMAX. Indeed it was. Yes, there is a talky opening scene that could give you the giggles with what they are all spouting, but once these gasbags are gassed, (literally), “Mission” roars off at top speed where it remains to the very end.\n\nMission Impossible Poster\n\nI’m not a fan of mindless car chases, but the action scenes here are so artfully contrived that my interest never flagged. The motorcycle cliff jump pays off beautifully, and the bridge dangling Orient Express sequence is quite simply thrilling. It builds and builds until you think it can’t top itself, and then it does. I haven’t seen anything as seat gripping since Raiders of the Lost Ark.\n\nAfter all this time, no one is to blame or praise for anything that happens in this franchise, but Tom Cruise. He knows what he wants, and he knows what he’s doing. The plots are pipe dreams, but Cruise makes a pact with the audience. “Suspend your disbelief, and I’ll give you a three ring circus joyride that you’ll never forget.”\n\nHis eye for detail extends to feminine beauty and the talent behind it. Both Rebecca Ferguson and Hayley Atwell have faces that would have ruled in Hollywood’s golden age, and the skills to make you care about them in this sea of fictional nonsense. Cruise himself is older, but we should all age as he has. His physical appearance and athletic skills are “picture in the attic” stuff. He is our Douglas Fairbanks Sr.\n\nThis iteration of Mission Impossible, like its predecessors, hasn’t a serious idea in its head. It aims only to distract and entertain. Yet, given this level of craft, creativity, and polish, it rises to movie making at its best. So, A for attaboy.\n\nNext was Barbie, which I saw with Darlene, my fashion consultant. Thanks to Greta Gerwig, Barbie has a head stuffed with serious ideas. Seeing it unprepared would be like sitting down to a banana split, only to discover that under the banana are a medley of nutritious vegetables and fiber. America Ferrera, in particular, delivers a speech that powerfully conveys the curse of being a woman with even half a brain in your head.\n\nStill, the banana on top doesn’t disappoint. The sets and costumes have the most cheerful pink and turquoise sheen imaginable. You want to hitch rides in Barbie’s car, her boat, her plane. Just don’t bang your head on the water in her pool.\n\nThen there’s Ken. Quite a few of him actually. Poor neglected Ken. Barbie is repulsed by his clueless advances. A trip to the real world inspires him to attempt a coup in Barbieland, but of course, the Barbies are too smart for him.\n\nThe movie has a split personality, and tries to divert two quite different audiences. Mostly, it succeeds. Little girls will like what they see, and adults will be amused by what they hear. At one point, the various Kens are quarreling about which of them does best the only thing they do well – beach (for them, it’s a verb). The resulting face off suggests to the jaded ear the prospect of an epic Mattel circle jerk. And Barbie’s final line, one for the ages really, might need some explaining to very young viewers.\n\nMargot Robbie is a restrained dream as Barbie. There hasn’t been as earnest a portrayal of a cartoon character since Shelley Duvall played Olive Oyl in Popeye. Ryan Gosling is just whom you’d want as Ken, and Rhea Perlman has a lovely cameo as Barbie’s creator. So, I’ll give Barbie a B for better than you might expect.\n\nFinally, Tim and I were back at IMAX for Oppenheimer. Full disclosure, I had gotten up at what seemed like crack of middle of the night for other errands, and felt under-slept as we got to the theater. I’ve never changed my opinion of a movie so drastically while I watched it. The first two hours (it’s a long watch) I alternately nodded off in boredom or hated what I snapped awake to see. Tim told me I missed some enjoyable but gratuitous full frontal nudity and a suicide.\n\nChristopher Nolan is a show off. He serves himself first and his subject second. You must be made aware this is a movie by Nolan, so he does things that John Ford or Howard Hawks would never stoop to. He employs a slice and dice form of editing so that you’re given brief ribbons of alternating scenes, now color, now black and white, now the present, now a flashback, and you are expected to stitch them together in your head to form a cogent narrative. In my sleep deprived state, this was impossible, but Tim, who was wide awake and alert, found the editing similarly exasperating. It also didn’t help that much of the dialogue was tamped down to a whisper.\n\nThen, about two thirds of the way in, Nolan stops hot dogging. It’s as though someone grabbed him and said, “If you don’t put down that scissors, we won’t have a picture.” Scenes lengthen, to accommodate anyone with an attention span, and a meaningful and involving story emerges.\n\nI can’t imagine the actors are happy with Nolan’s fragmenting of their efforts. Cillian Murphy gives us the multi-faceted complexity of Oppenheimer’s troubled genius. Emily Blunt is well cast as his stressed out wife, and Gary Oldman has a telling, nasty bit as Truman, once more disappearing into a well known character as he did with Churchill in Darkest Hour. The real surprise here though, is Robert Downey Jr. as Oppenheimer’s nemesis. It’s a masterful job that I didn’t Know he had in him. Shame on me.\n\nSo, overall, I’d say this is indeed worth seeing, (though there’s no need for IMAX), particularly if you can arrive late. I rate it C for Can you stop running with scissors?"
