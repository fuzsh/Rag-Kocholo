        "text": "One of my very favorite films has always been Carnival in Flanders or, in the original French, La Kermisse Heroique. Thanks to a striking poster, I now know the Swedes called it Hertigen onskar Natikvarten.\n\n“Carnival” is beautifully acted, especially by its illustrious lead, Francoise Rosay, wife of the gifted director, Jacques Feyder. It is also brilliantly designed by Lazare Meersen whose sets echo many fine old Flemish paintings. Full justice is done to these clever sets by the shrewd cinematography of Harry Stradling who, after a number of films with Feyder, had great success in America, culminating, to my mind, in his powerful work on A Streetcar Named Desire.\n\nI mention these contributors to the whole because each brings a sensibility that sharpens the enjoyment of this delicious movie. I must note one more, the costume designer, Georges Benda. His cunning outfits, particularly for the women, are both apt and amusing.\n\nOnce, as I was leaving England, I found a DVD of “Carnival.” I snapped it up, but back in the states, I discovered it could only be played in Europe. Fudge.\n\nI had to have the poster when it was offered at auction, but what came turned out to be too big for my changeable frame, unlike previous Swedish posters, which I love for their graphics. I thought I’d just store it away and take it out to admire from time to time, but gradually I decided it deserved a frame of its own, despite my lack of wall space.\n\nI went with Lois to Michael’s, where we have great confidence in the woman who heads the framing department. The poster excited her, and she offered a number of suggestions, some, of course, more costly than the poster itself. I pondered the lot until Lois gave her usual sensible advice, “Which will bring you joy?” Naturally, it was the most expensive of them all.\n\nA week or so later, Tim, renowned in the region for his expert hanging of anything, went with me to pick up both that frame and a much smaller one of a piece of sheet music for “It’s Magic,” the one song I’d like my friends to play after I’m gone. Ann knew how much I liked it, and imported it from London.\n\nMagical Doris.\n\nThe girl who waited on us looked at my name and said, “Did you teach at Washington High?” I did. She grew quite animated and said, “I didn’t have you, but my best friend did. He still talks about how much he loved your class. He bought your book! Do you mind if I take your picture? He’ll be so excited.” I didn’t mind; in fact, it made my day.\n\nOnce home, I helped Tim move some tables and bric-a-brac away from the wall where the poster would hang, and what should we discover but a small dead mouse. Hmmm.\n\nI’d been afraid that the large frame would overwhelm the space, and I hated to lose any of the desert scene on the walls. By positioning it off to the side and nestled by a palm tree, Tim found the perfect spot for it. It looks as though it always belonged there.\n\nWelcome to my lair, “Hertigen.” By any name, you have a place in my home and my heart."
