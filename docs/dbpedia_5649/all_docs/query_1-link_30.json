        "text": "Not to be confused with People's Court (Bavaria).\n\nThis article is about Nazi Germany's Volksgerichtshof. For other similarly named entities, see People's Court (disambiguation).\n\nThe People's Court (German: Volksgerichtshof pronounced [ˈfɔlksɡəˌʁɪçt͡shoːf] ⓘ, acronymed to VGH) was a Sondergericht (\"special court\") of Nazi Germany, set up outside the operations of the constitutional frame of law. Its headquarters were originally located in the former Prussian House of Lords in Berlin, later moved to the former Königliches Wilhelms-Gymnasium at Bellevuestrasse 15 in Potsdamer Platz (the location now occupied by the Sony Center; a marker is located on the sidewalk nearby).[1]\n\nThe court was established in 1934 by order of Reich Chancellor Adolf Hitler, in response to his dissatisfaction at the outcome of the Reichstag fire trial in front of the Reich Court of Justice (Reichsgericht) in which all but one of the defendants were acquitted. The court had jurisdiction over a rather broad array of \"political offenses\", which included crimes like black marketeering, work slowdowns, defeatism, and treason against Nazi Germany. These crimes were viewed by the court as Wehrkraftzersetzung (\"the disintegration of defensive capability\") and were accordingly punished severely; the death penalty was meted out in numerous cases."
