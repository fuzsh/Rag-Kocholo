Adolf Hitler was, like Bonaparte, a titanic failure as supreme warlord, but, unlike Bonaparte, he has so far not been glorified by a posthumous myth explaining away all his political and military errors, and attributing to him nobly constructive aims which he never had. Except for a few crypto-fascist historians, no one has yet sought to argue that Hitler would have avoided particular disasters and achieved ultimate victory had it not been for the blunders of his generals. Yet the parallels between Hitler and Bonaparte are obvious. While loudly prating of their patriotism both were foreigners in the countries they led into catastrophe. Both were social upstarts with chips rather than epaulettes on their shoulders. Both were romantics cherishing soaring fantasies of imperial conquest. Both failed to invade England and chose instead to invade Russia, thereby meeting their doom. Both began their wars with a run of flashy quick victories, and ended them by losing a series of grim attrition campaigns. Both men were in a hurry, compelled to be so for economic and political reasons; and both were therefore colossal gamblers. And there is another parallel: the wars that both initiated and conducted left in their wake Europes profoundly different politically and socially from those existing beforehand; and yet neither warlord had intended these new Europes, each planning something totally different. While Bonaparte had set out to create a Europe dominated by a French empire stretching from the Baltic to the Adriatic, Portugal to East Prussia, Hitler had intended his war to leave behind a 'Thousand Year' Germanic Reich and a German-dominated European 'New Order' extending from the North Sea and the Atlantic to the Urals. Yet while the age of romanticism and liberalism credited Bonaparte with creating the nineteenth-century European political order, with its middleclass nation-states, something far from his mind - rather like crediting a bulldozer with the building eventually erected on the site it had cleared - few there\n\nI\n\nINTRODUCTION have credited Hitler with the creation of the post-1945 European order. Yet the division and permanent weakening of Germany, the evolution of the European Community and the spread of democracy to all European states west of the Iron Curtain all ultimately resulted from the denouement of Hitler's\n\ncatastrophic failure as a warlord.\n\nIn other words, although Bonaparte and Hitler are\n\nmuch on\n\na par in\n\nterms\n\nof ultimate bankruptcy as empire-builders by force of arms, Bonaparte has got\n\naway with\n\nit\n\nin\n\nterms of reputation, receiving from posterity a press ranging\n\n(with few exceptions) from admiration to hero-worship. For the Napoleonic\n\nlegend provided exactly the right package for the intellectuals of the 'romantic' nineteenth century. His record, suitably edited and distorted, was transformed into that of a standard-bearer of liberal progress, a liberator of nations,\n\nand\n\neven a military genius (despite the small matter of his finishing up\n\na prisoner\n\non St Helena). But Hitler has enjoyed none of these advantages.\n\nHe\n\nstands\n\nEuropean ideas - supershot was fired in Hitler's\n\nfor the past, not for the future, of twentieth-century\n\nrace rather than supermarket.\n\nBy\n\nthe time the last\n\nwas already demode. As an ideology it belonged to the distant pre-1914 era of romantic nationalism and glorification of military might; as a system it was totally and finally discredited by the discovery of the full horror of the extermination camps. As a warlord Hitler, in contrast to Bonaparte the professional soldier, exemplifies the amateur, devoid of understanding of the fundamental principles of grand strategy or operations; ignorant of - contemptuous of- logistics; war\n\nin 1945, fascism\n\nunwilling, perhaps unable, to confront the realities of the battlefield, such as that the bravest soldiers can only prevail for so long against fatigue, casualties\n\nand superior numbers, or that a lost battle is a battle lost, and must be broken off. Yet Bonaparte the professional can also be accused of ignoring logistics and the reality\n\nlimits of his soldiers'\n\nof\n\nlost battles, lost\n\npowers of endurance, and of defying the\n\ncampaigns,\n\nlost wars.\n\nNevertheless, he retained his\n\nextraordinary personal spell over his marshals right up to the final disasters\n\nof the 1814 campaign which brought the armies of his enemies into Paris.

Meanwhile a procession of distinguished private British visitors, including Lloyd George, was also taken in.

His testament Mein Kampf, published in 1925-6, envisaged a German colonial empire carved out of Soviet Russia. He told the army leaders just after becoming Chancellor in 1933 that Germany must solve her economic problems by conquering markets, that this required her rearmament, and that there must be expansion towards the East (i.e., Russia) and 'ruthless Germanization of it'. He told Goring in 1936 that Germany must defeat Soviet Russia.

In\n\n1933-6 he spent\n\njust\n\nenough on armaments\n\nto give a fillip to the economy By 1936 Germany had climbed out appeared to have dawned for the German\n\nalong with a programme of public works.\n\nof the Depression, and a golden age\n\nThe new armaments, coupled with rapid expansion of the Army and new Luftwaffe, and displays of military pageantry, served to make Germans\n\npeople.\n\nthe\n\nfeel that\n\nthey were a great nation again, while at the same time enabling Hitler\n\ncon the British and French into believing that he had embarked on a war economy in peacetime, which was far from the case. From 1935 onwards Hitler to\n\nsucceeded in frightening the British and French - especially the British - into seeking a deal with\n\nhim before he became\n\ntoo strong altogether. In 1937\n\nChamberlain's government gave Hitler a clear signal that\n\nit would connive at and eastern Europe if only it were done in a seemly way, by international agreement, and not just by obvious smash-andgrab. Thus Hitler was operating the strongest of all ploys, in diplomacy as\n\nGerman expansion\n\nin central\n\nwell as war: the strategic offensive coupled with the tactical defensive.\n\nHe\n\ntwanged the nerves of pacifistic democratic statesmen with propaganda about the strength of his armed forces and his willingness to use them, and waited successfully for the democracies to come creeping to him.\n\nstirred the pot,\n\nClausewitz wrote that war was a continuation of policy by other means; in the late\n\n1930s Hitler\n\nBy means\n\nmade\n\npolicy a continuation of\n\nwar by other means.\n\nof his 'shop-window' rearmament and his well tuned rantings\n\nabout the terrors that would ensue\n\nif\n\nGermany were\n\ndeserts. Hitler achieved his greatest diplomatic\n\nwhen Chamberlain persuaded France\n\nnot accorded her just\n\ntriumph\n\nat\n\nMunich\n\nin 1938,\n\nabandon her ally Czechoslovakia, and the two democracies handed him the Sudetenland, which happened to contain the powerful Czech frontier defences. The Munich Agreement radically altered the strategic balance of Europe in Hitler's favour, opening the way to his final occupation of Czechoslovakia in March 1939, which in turn uncovered the southern flank of his next victim, Poland. But Munich marked not only Hitler's triumph over Chamberlain and Daladier, but also over the leadership of the German Army. That leadership certainly saw war as a legitimate instrument of policy, as it always had been in European affairs, but war waged at the right time and with a strong and thoroughly well prepared army, as in 1866 and 1871. The foreshortening of the possible date for a conflict from 1940 (dismayingly close as even that was) to 1938,\n\nwhen\n\nthe\n\nto\n\nGerman Army remained\n\nstage of expansion, training and equipping, horrified them.\n\nbecome embroiled again\n\nin a\n\nin the middle For Germany to\n\nwar with France and Britain over Czechoslovakia\n\nwould, they contended (Beck, the Chief of\n\n6\n\nStafI, in particular), lead to yet\n\nINTRODUCTION another cataclysmic national defeat.

With Fritsch already discarded in February 1938 after being framed on a homosexuahty charge by the Gestapo, and replaced by Brauchitsch, a good soldier but (as Professor Brian Bond shows in his admirable analysis of his character in this book) weak and vacillating as a head of the Army, Hitler had achieved complete dominance over the generals. However, by summer 1939 his run of successful conquest without w ar w as coming to an end. His 'shop-window' rearmament had provoked the Allies, and especially Britain, into embarking on their ow n rearmament, but in depth; preparation for real war, and particularly in the air. His occupation of the rest narrower\n\nMarch 1939 convinced western opinion that he was planned timetable of expansion, and must be stopped.\n\nof Czechoslovakia in\n\nindeed following\n\na\n\nChamberlain, instead of handing Hitler the keys to Poland as he had the keys Czechoslovakia in 1938, gave a guarantee to Poland that Britain would if she was attacked. When in August 1939 Hitler sought to repeat his ploy of threats coupled with blatant military preparations, the Poles refused to\n\nsupport her\n\nto\n\nbudge. So for the\n\ncrisis or still\n\nfirst\n\nrelatively\n\ndown in a when Germany was\n\ntime he had to choose between backing\n\nturning the threat of force into a reality - and\n\nunprepared for\n\na\n\nmajor war. Emboldened by\n\nhis cynical pact\n\nwith Soviet Russia in August 1939, which freed him from the menace of a two-front war, and believing that Chamberlain would be no more likely to go to\n\nwar over Danzig than the Sudetenland, he ordered\n\nhis generals to\n\nan attack on Poland. Amoral as he was, Hitler was flabbergasted\n\nproduced\n\na British declaration\n\nlaunch\n\nwhen\n\nthis\n\nof war because of fidelity to principle and a\n\npromise.\n\nSo he had got Germany into that confhct with Britain and France against in vain, and which Beck had argued that Germany must lose in the end. Here was Hitler's first outright mistake as director of Germany's total strategy; indeed the crucial mistake from which ultimate catastrophe was to flow That the mistake was catastrophic did not become immediately apparent. The generals led the 'shop-window' Wehrmacht of 1939 with high professional skill in a classic campaign which crushed Poland in three weeks, while the French Army w hich they had so much feared hardly stirred from its lines in support of the Poles. which Beck had warned\n\n.\n\nWhat\n\nnext.-^\n\nAfter the Polish campaign Hitler and\n\nbelieved that the war would\n\nreason for the Allies to carry\n\nnow it\n\nChamberlain\n\nalike\n\npeter out; Hitler because he could see no\n\non now that Poland,\n\ntheir casus belli,\n\nhad been\n\nswallowed up; Chamberlain because he simply could not believe that the\n\n7\n\nINTRODUCTION belligerent\n\npowers would\n\ninto another great\n\nreally allow the present\n\nEuropean\n\n'phoney war' to blaze out\n\nconflict fought to the death.\n\nThe\n\nsticking point\n\nand Poland, which Chamberlain rightful owners as a condition of peace; not\n\nlay in Hitler's trophies of Czechoslovakia\n\ninsisted\n\nmust be returned\n\nto their\n\nWhen therefore the British government rejected October 1939, Hitler had to re-think his total strategy. Having stumbled into a general war with armed forces good only for Blitzkrieg one Hitler was\n\nlikely to accept.\n\nHitler's 'peace' offer in\n\ncampaigns each\n\nlasting a\n\nfew weeks, he faced the\n\nself-inflicted\n\nproblem that\n\nmore powerful than he embarked on the maximum\n\nwithin a year or so France and Britain could be militarily he, thanks to their\n\nrearmament\n\nmobilization of Germany's\n\nin\n\nstill\n\ndepth - unless\n\nlargely peacetime\n\neconomy. But such\n\na switch\n\nwar economy would damage his credit with the German people for having so far given them butter as well as guns. He therefore again opted for a Blitzkriegs this time against France and the\n\nto a\n\nLow\n\nOnce again his generals proved round the feet. They remembered too well the German Army's defeat in 19 18 at the hands of Haig and Foch. With Brauchitsch as their mouthpiece they sought to persuade Hitler to abandon the project, as Professor Brian Bond and Professor Barry Leach describe from different angles in their studies of Brauchitsch and Haider in this book. In a repetition of the pattern during the Czech crisis of 1938 professional opposition to Hitler's new venture deepened into a tentative conspiracy to depose him, so further lowering his opinion of his generals. Confronted in a conference in November 1939 by Hitler in a well acted rage, the generals crumbled and tamely got on with the task of planning the coming offensive. Fall Gelb ('Case Countries; another high-risk gamble.\n\nlukewarm or\n\npositively cool, especially\n\nYellow').\n\nHitler had given as\n\nits\n\nobjectives the conquest of territory in the\n\nLow\n\nCountries and northern France, rather as in 19 14-18, in order to establish air and submarine bases much closer to England while at the same time pushing Allied air bases further\n\naway from the Ruhr\n\nindustrial region.\n\nThese were\n\ncuriously limited prizes for so huge and risky a venture. Like Ludendorff 's offensives in spring 19 18, Fall Gelb lacked an overall political aim, so remaining a purely military project\n\nconducted\n\nin a policy\n\nvacuum. Hitler therefore here\n\nstands guilty of breaching Clausewitz's fundamental principle that war\n\nalways a political\n\nis\n\nact.\n\nThe operational planning for Fall Gelb found the military conservatives on Army General Staff (Oberkommando des Heeres: okh) led by Haider in\n\nthe\n\nconflict with the bold strategic innovators\n\nRundstedt (Commander-in-Chief\n\n- Manstein, Chief of\n\nArmy Group\n\nGuderian, Germany's panzer warfare expert and\n\nThe\n\nStaff to\n\nA), Rundstedt himself, and\n\nnow commander\n\nof 39th\n\nbook by FieldMarshal Lord Carver's professional appraisal of Manstein, Kenneth Macksey's portrait of Guderian, and Professor Earl Ziemke's study of Rundstedt, as well Panzer Corps.\n\ncontroversy\n\nis\n\nclearly illuminated in this\n\n8\n\nINTRODUCTION by Bond on Brauchitsch and Leach on Haider. Hitler himself, characbacked the innovators and gamblers; in fact, it was he who first conceived of the basic idea for a thrust from the Ardennes through the Allied as\n\nteristically,\n\ncentre to the Channel coast, instead of the General Staff's plodding concept\n\nof a direct advance against the Allied\n\nleft\n\nwing\n\nin the\n\nBelgian plain, a repetition\n\nof the Schlieffen Plan of 19 14.\n\nmoments of doubt and loss of nerve on both and the generals' part (but not on Guderian's) Operation Sichelschnitt (Sickle-cut) proved an unimagined triumph, destroying the whole Allied northern army group and paving the way for the final defeat and fall of France, In the event, and despite\n\nHitler's\n\nthe great\n\nenemy of 1914-18,\n\nweeks of battle. Thus the prowess under the leadership of such men as\n\nafter only six\n\nof the panzer divisions in the field\n\nGuderian and Rommel had made possible the\n\npolitical prize that\n\nhad been\n\nabsent in Hitler's original concept for the offensive in the west.\n\nFor Hitler and the German people this amazing and unexpected deliverance seemed to mark Germany's victory in the present war, and they celebrated it as such. The share of munitions production in the German economy was actually to fall in the latter months of 1940. Historians have been so dazzled by Stchelschnitf s brilliance and by its stunning success in bringing France down that they have not questioned whether Hitler's decision to attack France and the Low Countries really constituted sound long-term 'total strategy' in the first place, or instead another decisive error of judgment. In the winter of 1939-40 it had been perfectly plain in Berlin that the British and French were themselves highly reluctant end the so-called 'phoney war' by launching\n\na grand offensive; evident also French Army's morale was gradually rotting as it sat idle in its defences - that the French nation's enthusiasm for the war was waning likewise. Thanks to the Russo-German Pact, Germany's oil and raw material\n\nto\n\nthat the\n\nsupplies were assured, so nullifying the Allied attempt at maritime blockade.\n\nWas\n\nopen up the war by an offensive in drive from the Meuse to the Channel and the subsequent fall of France was in fact a political blunder though a military masterpiece.'* For what flowed from the victory of May-June 1940 was the lost Battle of Britain; the abortive preparations to invade England (Operation Sealion); the ever increasing support of the United States for the British cause; Italy's entry into the war that eventually led to the entanglement of German forces in the Balkans, North Africa and the Mediterranean. It can be further argued that, by fostering in Hitler an overweening self-confidence, the triumph over France coupled with the superb professional performance it\n\ntherefore in\n\nthe west?\n\nCan\n\nit\n\nGermany's\n\ninterest to\n\nnot be argued that the\n\nGerman\n\nGerman Army provided key factors in his fatal decision to attack Soviet Of course Hitler could not have been expected to foresee such far-reaching consequences when he was contemplating Fall Gelb^ yet there\n\nof the\n\nRussia in 1941.\n\nmust always be the\n\nrisk in\n\nopening up quiescent situations that the ramifications\n\n9\n\nINTRODUCTION may prove harmful\n\nas well as unpredictable. Hitler's original\n\noffensive in the west does not\n\nseem\n\nin\n\nany way to\n\njustify\n\naim\n\nfor the\n\nacceptance of that\n\nand that unpredictability. first consequence of his defeat of France lay in the totally unexpected problem of improvizing a cross-Channel invasion of England. This time it was the admirals who opposed him, successfully arguing that it would be risk\n\nThe\n\nGerman Army to Kent and Sussex in the face of and unless the Luftwaffe had won complete air superiority over the Channel. In the event the victory of Royal Air Force Fighter Command saved the German generals from having to put their Sealion plan to the test. But even before Hitler in October postponed' Sealion until spring impossible to transport the the Royal\n\nNavy\n\n1941 (in\n\nfact, for\n\nuntil\n\ngood), he had decided to invade Soviet Russia, the final\n\ndirective to prepare for Operation Barbarossa being issued\n\non\n\n5\n\nDecember\n\n1940.\n\nWhy\n\ndid he\n\nmake\n\nthis fateful decision.? Stalin\n\nhad scrupulously\n\nfulfilled\n\nevery shipment of supplies specified under the Russo-German Pact; there was\n\nno sign\n\nhe meant to turn off the tap. Since it was Hitler's reckoning armed forces were such poor stuff that they could be defeated\n\nat all that\n\nthat the Soviet in six weeks,\n\nhe cannot really have believed that Germany stood in danger of\n\nRussian attack. His claim that Russia constituted Britain's\n\nlast hope, and was smashed Britain would make peace was hardly well founded, since Russia was then not even a belligerent, was in no way supporting Britain's fight, while Britain was very evidently looking to America for rescue rather than to Russia. It must be conjectured that Hitler simply believed that as an opponent Britain was as good as defeated, and that it was now time to fulfil his cherished dream of founding a Germanic empire on Russian soil. But whatever the motivation, here was his second decisive mistake of 'total strategy' (the first being to get Germany into a general war at all) and all his own. For his senior soldiers - Brauchitsch, Haider, Rundstedt - were filled with gloomy foreboding at the prospect of campaigning in Russia, again and again pointing the operational problems (as the relevant portraits in Hitler s Generals describe). Hitler believed that his 'shop-window' (as they still were) armed forces could crush the Soviet Union by Blitzkrieg as they had Poland and\n\na\n\nthat once Russia\n\nFrance. His generals too shared Hitler's poor opinion of the\n\nRed Army,\n\nas for\n\ndown, as his generals did not, the Russian factors of space, distance and bad communications; the immense problems of logistics and movement. And just like that matter did the British General Staff. Nevertheless Hitler played\n\nFall Gelb^ Barbarossa lacked a clear political aim. Hitler stated as an\n\nadvance\n\nto the east of Moscow, the destruction of the\n\nits\n\nobjectives\n\nRed Army's powers\n\nof resistance, and the establishment of a kind of permanent military frontier\n\nbetween German-occupied Russia and the remainder.

By September 1942 the drive into the Caucasus, spearheaded by the ist Panzer Army under Kleist (whose problems are well analysed by Professor Samuel Mitcham), had crawled to a stop, another victim of insurmountable logistical difficulties and of sheer attrition.

Only Manstein's and Kleist's mastery of the art of operational manoeuvre and consummate staff work (as Field-Marshal Lord Carver and Samuel Mitcham describe) saved the armies in the Caucasus from a similar fate, where again Hitler refused to sanction a retreat until refusal to\n\nBattle of\n\nperilously late.\n\nNow\n\nHitler had not only lost the political initiative in the war, but also the\n\nit in 1943 on the Eastern Front by Kursk Salient, with all available panzer forces, failed with enormous losses that weakened defensive operations for the rest of the year.

But just like Bonaparte in his time. Hitler could not see that it was himself that held the coalition together; and that so long as he was alive and free, it would go on holding together. For apart from the conviction among the Allied peoples and their leaders that he was a trickster and a criminal who had carefully planned aggressive war, there was the question of his regime's barbaric treatment of the Jews, Poles and Russians.

His performance at the Kriegsakademie in the years 1907-10, where he topped his class with the extraordinary grades of 9 in both tactics and military history, the two dominating subjects, gave him a status in the Army matching that of the double first at Oxford or Cambridge.

He was an outstandingly good choice for handling the military problems of the German Army. Unfortunately, the problems which faced the Army in the years after Fritsch's appointment were more than merely military. The difficulties of reexpanding the Army were small compared with the political complications which attended the functions of the Army under the Nazi regime.

Weichs was about to report what had happened, when Fritsch broke him off\n\nreserve, his principles of\n\nhis strict Protestant Christianity.\n\nwith, 'No!\n\nHe\n\nIt is all lies!'^\n\nwhen Seeckt was\n\ndid once turn his thoughts in a political direction\n\ndismissed from office in 1926.

Hitler and Fritsch had\n\nvery little to do with each other. Fritsch had no right of direct access, and Blomberg transacted all the usual defence business with the Fiihrer. When Fritsch did see Hitler, it was usually in Blomberg's presence. Their relations were therefore restricted to formal correctness, which was, until 1938, always observed on both sides. Fritsch's presence had a strange effect on Hitler. While Hitler would talk quite freely with Blomberg, and even argue, he always felt inhibited when Fritsch was present, and never let anything slip - either in\n\nsubstance or in form. Fritsch, for his part, never tried to argue things out with Hitler until 5\n\nNovember\n\n1937, preferring to thrash matters out\n\nor simply to voice a protest to Hitler through\n\nw ith Blomberg,\n\nBlomberg. Hitler once described\n\nFritsch as 'the incorruptible Englishman'.'\" Fritsch's outlook on Hitler\n\nsummed up\n\nin his oft-repeated\n\nwords: 'Hitler\n\nis\n\nGermany's\n\nfate for\n\nis\n\ngood and\n\nforbad.'\"\n\nWhether Hitler had studied the nature of his new Army Commander or not not known, but the words which he chose to greet Fritsch on the latter's assumption of office would have confirmed Fritsch in his conception of his task: 'Create an army of the greatest possible strength, inner resolution and unity, on the best imaginable foundation of training.\"- He would have been wiser to have given more weight to the prophetic words with which Ludendorff advised him: 'Hitler remains loyal to no one - he will betray even you inside is\n\na\n\nfew\n\nyears!\"-'\n\nThe\n\nBlomberg w as alw ays tense. Although must have found great difficulty in feeling sympathetic towards a man who was playing a part which Fritsch felt improper for a military officer. Moreover, his past experience of Blomberg had made him aware of the minister's propensities for romanticism, fantasy and novelties, and of his habit of acting from a sudden impulse. However, relationship between Fritsch and\n\nFritsch was able to co-exist with Blomberg, he\n\nthey were able to co-operate sufficiently well for the discharge of their duties,\n\nand they avoided\n\nable to persuade\n\na\n\nBlomberg\n\nmajor\n\ncrisis in their relations. Fritsch\n\nto take to Hitler matters about\n\nofficial\n\nwas usually\n\nwhich Fritsch had\n\ncomplained, but he was exasperated by the ease with which Blomberg allowed himself to be beaten\n\ndown by\n\nthe Fiihrer.\n\n25\n\nTHE ANTI-NAZI GENERALS\n\nTwo months\n\nbefore Fritsch's assumption of his new office, the German Army had received a new Chief of the General Staff, General Ludwig Beck. Like Fritsch, Beck had been chosen on the basis of his military ability and also, like Fritsch, had very little to speak of by way of private life. Beck, like Fritsch was born a Rhinelander in 1880, near Wiesbaden, into a quiet, respectable, upper-middle-class family.\n\nHis father was\n\na highly skilled\n\nmetallurgical engineer, with a strong academic bent. This bent was present in\n\nthe\n\nyoung Ludwig, and became one of\n\nHe\n\nentered the 15th Prussian Field Artillery Regiment in 1898, and spent\n\nmost of the period before the beautiful country aroused in\n\nwoods and\n\nFirst\n\nhim\n\na\n\nmost outstanding\n\nhis\n\nWorld War\n\ndeep love of\n\nits\n\ncharacteristics.\n\nin Alsace-Lorraine.\n\nThis\n\ncharacteristic villages,\n\nits\n\nand to retire to a house in Alsace always remained one of his pipe-dreams. His service as a junior officer had been sufficiently proficient to enable him to be selected for General Staff training, which he completed between October 1908 and July 191 1. During the First World War, he served as a Staff Officer in divisional and higher headquarters. For the last two years of the war, he served on the Staff of the Army Group Deutscher Kronprinz with the then Major Max von Viebahn, who relates how Beck carried heavy responsibilities which sometimes in effect embraced command of the entire Army Group. In this position. Beck acquired the habits of intense industry which were to mould the whole shape of his future life. He became accustomed to working fifteen hours a day, and to going for long periods without any free time. He even gave up one of his its\n\nvalleys,\n\nfew relaxations - playing the\n\nviolin.\n\nHe\n\nparticularly distinguished himself at\n\nthe end of the war by his planning of the withdrawal of German forces totalling\n\nninety divisions, under difficult and pressing circumstances.\n\nThe\n\nonly romance of his\n\nlife\n\nblossomed\n\nbriefly in the\n\nmid-war period. He\n\nmarried Amalie Pagenstecher, the daughter of a Bremen merchant, on 12 1916.\n\nThey had\n\na brief\n\nwartime honeymoon, and he returned\n\nMay\n\nto the Front.\n\nin 19 17. However, the health of Frau Beck deteriorated severely, and she died on 16 November 19 17, leaving the upbringing of Gertrud to her father. His reaction to this loss was, similar to that of Montgomery, to immerse himself totally in his profession. He grew more and more apart from the social life that tended to surround rising young officers. He was shy and withdrawn. Few things repelled him more than the artificial bonhomie of officers' messes. Life's burdens increased further when he developed a stomach complaint which robbed eating of pleasure. He ate two simple meals a day, with a warm drink as his only sustenance in the middle\n\nTheir daughter Gertrud was born\n\nof the day. This was not the kind of diet with which to sustain ally as\n\nhe used to continue his work to a\n\nfew opportunities which he had for using\n\nOn\n\nI\n\nlate it,\n\nhour\n\nhe never\n\nlost his personal\n\nOctober 1929 he became Commander of the 5th\n\n26\n\nvitality, especi-\n\nafter dinner.

He went sympathy with Scheringer's ideas. As soon as Groener, the Defence Minister, heard of this testimony he wanted to have Beck dismissed. Hammerstein, then Chief of the General Staff and an admirer of Beck's qualities, dissuaded Groener, and Beck went on to become a divisional commander. Beck's flirtation with Nazism proved short-lived as he found out more about the people who comprised the movement. In the years 1931 to 1933, he was busy with the writing of a manual of tactics which was to become one of the most renowned of German military publications - the T.F. or Die TruppenfUhrung. This became his best known work, and gained him a great reputation for the clarity of his ideas and expression. For a military publication the book has one other unusual feature it is written in prose of some elegance. This, together with the large number of other studies which he wrote during his lifetime, mark him as a thinker in the tradition of Moltke the Elder. Thus, in October 1933, it was difficult to go beyond Beck in the quest for a new Chief of the General Staff, and despite the episode of the trial of the three lieutenants, he was the man whom Hammerstein chose to be his closest adviser and assistant. In view of the difficulties of that first year of the Nazi rule, Hammerstein must have been aware that his period of office was drawing to a close. Beck would have to serve as the only sort of bridge which he could build between his era and that of his successor. Moving to Berlin was a mixed blessing for Beck, for he much preferred life in the open country to office work in a city. However, he had scope for his one form of recreation, horsemanship, in the Tiergarten and the Griinewald, and he settled down to a busy routine. He had ridden regularly since he was a youth, and was an expert judge of horses. An equestrian gift was the one sort which gave him great pleasure on birthdays and other anniversaries. He rose every morning at 5.30 and rode from 6 until 8 o'clock. Breakfast followed, and by 8.30 he was being driven to his office in the Bendlerstrasse. Work commenced at 9 o'clock, and continued without a break until nearly 7 p.m. Then he would return home, and dine. After dinner, he would usually go to his desk and do another three hours' work before midnight. On this pattern of rest, nutrition and relaxation he was probably rarely in the good, robust form which he needed in order to take on the Nazis. He resided in a simple double-fronted, grey stucco house, No. 9 Goethestrasse, Lichterfelde. He deliberately chose a simple house which he could character of Scheringer, which, as his\n\n27\n\nTHE ANTI-NAZI GENERALS income without any special allowance. He shunned the residence which could have been his, since he realized the tentacles which favours of that sort could send out to bind a man's honour to his job long after the two had become incompatible. Beck's honour was not to be bought. As he said to his daughter, he did not want to owe anything to anyone, especially Hitler. His friends were chiefly military colleagues, especially Manstein, Hammerstein, Hossbach, Heinrich von Stiilpnagel, and above all, Fritsch. This group was to widen later as he turned more to conspiring against Hitler during the war, and included men of distinction from many walks of life, such as the historian Friedrich Meinecke, and the members of the opposition group the Mittwochgesellschaft (Wednesday Club). The main criticism which has been made of Beck is that he was too conservative and incapable of making a decision in an unfamiliar environment. There is no doubt that his basic mould of character was conservative. He was also cautious, and adhered strictly to the dictum of Moltke: 'Erst wagen, dann wagen' ('First consider, then venture'). But both parts of this process must be given weight - he was prepared to take risks, after due consideration. It may be that his idea of consideration was somewhat more thorough than that of his colleagues, but he carried the greater responsibility. His planning of exercises for the General Staff using armoured formations of the size of a division, or even of a corps in 1935, when Germany scarcely had any tanks at all, and no combat models, shows anything but excessive conservatism. His decision-making powers had been proved during World War I under conditions in which he bore unusual responsibility, and where an inability to make up his mind would have resulted in his rapid dismissal, instead of his on\n\nafford entirely\n\nmore luxurious\n\nhis\n\nofficial\n\ndistinguished record of promotion.\n\nHowever, he was no match\n\nfor the fast play of the Nazis. Initially\n\nhe attacked\n\nwhich they might have recognized an error, rather than risk a full confrontation on basic strategy. His resistance was made ineffective by the simple expedient of shutting him out. Beck obtained a faceto-face interview with Hitler twice on official matters during his five years of office as Chief of the General Staff. However, the quantity and scope of the studies which he wrote at this time show what a clear grasp he had of the practical details of their plans in\n\ninternational strategic issues of his day.\n\nwas not able\n\nwedded\n\nto\n\nput them into\n\neffect.\n\nHe\n\ncould see the best solutions, but\n\nIt is a pity that this insight\n\nwas not\n\nto the dashing, driving personality of a Seeckt rather than that of the\n\nsimilarly conservative\n\nand introverted Fritsch.\n\nFritsch and Beck formed a strong and close partnership within the\n\nCommand.

However, their relations in early 1934 became clouded, due to Fritsch's suspicion that, in the debates taking place about reorganization.

This was the environment in which Fritsch had to attempt to carry out his task. He was quite clear what this was - on the one hand to see that the reestablishment of German military parity was efficiently conducted and on the other to keep Germany out of a major war, which he knew Germany would lose. He wished the Army to expand gradually, so that its skill and efficiency would not be sacrificed for the sake of mere size. He intended to base this new Army on the old traditions, despite the effi)rts of the Nazis to stress a complete were speedily dissolved\n\nbreak with the past.\n\nin\n\nHe\n\ntook office at a critical point\n\nSA (Brown Shirts) to replace the\n\ninvolved in a struggle with\n\nArmy were\n\nRohm,\n\nwhen\n\nthe\n\nthe SA leader, from the outset.

Blomberg and Reichenau (whom Blomberg\n\nhad made head of his own office) represented the spirit of the new political while Fritsch and Beck embodied the traditions of the old. Initially, these\n\nera,\n\ndifferences do not appear to have caused disruption. Relations between Fritsch and Blomberg had been sufficiently close in 1933 for Blomberg to have told Fritsch that he wanted him to succeed Hammerstein, and Beck took office in a\n\nspirit\n\nof confidence that he could work with Blomberg. However, the\n\ndifferences between their objectives swiftly reinforced their differences in\n\noutlook and personality. Blomberg and Reichenau were concerned with the adaptation of the Reichsrvehr to the Nazi government, the Nazi Party, and\n\nNazi ideology, so that political-military relations ran as smoothly as possible. Fritsch and Beck saw their task as to rebuild the\n\nnot as an\n\narm of the Nazi\n\nAs soon\n\nArmy\n\nbut on the old model,\n\nParty.\n\ntwo different aims began to conflict with each other, the two pairs on to ever-diverging courses, the potential unity of the Armed Forces which could have served to as these\n\nforces of individual personality set these splitting\n\nrestrain Hitler.\n\nOut of this,\n\nHitler was able to increase his personal\n\npower by\n\nallowing the two groups to fight each other, while he remained as an onlooker, or sometimes performed the functions of an adjudicator, until he finally broke\n\nboth groups individually.\n\nOne\n\nof the major problems that Fritsch and Beck had to contend with was\n\nNazi indoctrination of the Army. Both were opposed\n\nto this politicization of\n\nBlomberg and Reichenau, there was little they could do, including resignation, to stem the tide. Men who knew Fritsch their troops but, given the stance of\n\nwell during this period, such as Manstein, Heinrici, Viebahn, Hossbach,\n\nHaider, Erfurth and Foertsch have\n\nall\n\n29\n\nreported his opposition to the Nazi-\n\nTHE ANTI-NAZI GENERALS\n\nHow\n\nWe that\n\nArmy, and\n\nBlomberg about it. unknown, except in the broadest outHnes. do know that Fritsch was becoming increasingly anxious in 1937, and his health had begun to deteriorate.

The reactions of the other generals followed on from those of Blomberg and Fritsch. On the one hand, there were those who regarded the dissemination\n\nessentially\n\nmilitary\n\nof Nazism within the\n\nArmy\n\nReichenau and Dollmann. political indoctrination\n\nwith favour, or equanimity, as did Brauchitsch,\n\nOn\n\nthe other, there were those\n\nwho opposed the They\n\nof the Army, such as Beck, Weichs and Ulex.\n\nsaw that Fritsch was able to achieve little against it, and believed that the only thing to be done was to cut their losses in the political fight, and set about their actual military duty, leaving politics to the politicians.\n\nThe\n\noutlook suited\n\nthe Party admirably. Its co-ordinated policy of indoctrination was able to\n\ngather gradual\n\nThe\n\nmomentum,\n\nassisted\n\nby the successes of Hitler's foreign policy.\n\nwas to be shown both by the hesitation which was induced in the minds of those generals who considered armed revolt in 1938 and 1939, and by the tenacity with which many soldiers clung to Nazi beliefs throughout the war. The predominant mood was appropriately summed up by the commander of the 17th Division, Lieutenant-General Friderici, in his farewell address to the division before his re-posting, on 30 March 1939, thus: 'The Fiihrer Adolf Hitler gives us the example. We will follow him gladly into the German future - come what will!''\" The more time went by, the less chance Fritsch and Beck had of exercising restraint on the military policies of the Third Reich, since the Army was being filled beneath them with the spirit of Nazism, transferred from the Hitler Youth, from the schools, and from the other Party organizations, by the thousands of youths who, from 1935 onwards made up the mass of the striking power of the Army. Thus the process of German rearmament served to tighten the Party's influence both at the top and at the grass roots of the Wehrmacht. effectiveness of the indoctrination\n\nThe Army became\n\nincreasingly less able to exercise control over\n\nfortunes.\n\n30\n\nits\n\nown\n\nFRITSCH, BECK AND THE FUHRER Rumours abounded in the mid- 1930s alleging friction between the Army and the Party. There were many references to hostility between Fritsch and the Party, and between Fritsch and Reichenau. One published report included the so-called Blue Book of the Reichswehr, which was supposed to have been submitted to Hindenburg by Army officers after the shooting of the sa leaders on 30 June 1934, calling for a change in the government, with Fritsch as ViceChancellor, Hammerstein as Reichswehr Minister, and Nadolny as Foreign Minister. It is interesting that such a report should have been published, not only for the Gestapo to read at such a time, but also for the for\n\nservant of the Nazi regime. this idea to\n\na constraint\n\nThe\n\nbe utterly ridiculous.\n\nas a whole,\n\nmay have been an attempt\n\npublicity It\n\nmay\n\nalso\n\nto\n\nshow\n\nhave been an attempt to exercise\n\non Fritsch.\n\nHimmler even went was\n\nArmy\n\ndoes raise the thought that Fritsch in particular was a most reluctant\n\nit\n\nso far as to designate a day\n\non which he believed Fritsch\n\nattempt a putsch against the Nazis. Fritsch recorded that he thought\n\nto\n\nrumours put the day as 10 January 1935, but other evidence suggests was 13 January. Blomberg was informed, although it is not known from which side the warning came. Accordingly, he called a meeting of the senior officers of the Army for the night in question, in Berlin. His motivation for his action would have depended upon the source of his information. Blomberg that the that\n\nit\n\nHimmler\n\ninvited\n\nof\n\nI\n\nto address this meeting. Fritsch related in a\n\nmemorandum\n\nFebruary 1938:\n\nI was accused of inviting a Professor, who was also a senior legal Government, I think his name was Schmidt, to give an address one Thursday at Army Headquarters. Goring held that it would be shown in this address that a putsch was permissible, according to constitutional law.

It was only six months since Hitler had made an example of the leaders of the sa, so Fritsch may have continued to place confidence in Hitler as an effective leader. Second, the process of building up\n\n31\n\nTHE ANTI-NAZI GENERALS Army, and thereby of restoring national security, was in full swing, so what did the personal attacks and insults of the onlooking group of lesser Party leaders amount to?
