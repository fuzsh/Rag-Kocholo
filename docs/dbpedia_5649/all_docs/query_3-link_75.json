        "text": "I.\n\nJuly 1944:\n\nHitler’s reign comes to a sudden end\n\nat the hands of Claus von Stauffenberg\n\nJuly 20th, 1944\n\nThe Wolf’s Lair, East Prussia\n\n12:03 to 12:42 PM​\n\nAmong the members of the conspiracy to assassinate Hitler there were only two who both held high rank and were constantly present at the Wolf’s Lair, thus having access to the Führer: General Helmuth Stieff, once the designated assassin, who had backed away from going through with the plot several times before, and more crucially, General Erich Fellgiebel, the man in charge of army communications within the base. Having resisted Hitler in secret from within the army since 1938[1], and after spending the 15th of July in agony as Stauffenberg and the Bendlerstrasse [2] plotters dithered and wasted an opportunity to kill the Führer, Fellgiebel could only hope that the Colonel would get it right this time. Nervous at not having seen Stauffenberg over a good part of the morning, the General’s instinct was to have a call placed, but ultimately he put his nerves under control and decided against it. If Stauffenberg was going to get caught, there was hardly anything he could do to save him, and interrupting him would probably cause problems of its own. Unwittingly, Fellgiebel had just ensured Stauffenberg and his aide Werner von Haeften would not be disturbed as they were preparing the explosives that were to be used in the attempt later that day [3].\n\nBy 12:30 Colonel Von Stauffenberg and General Walter Buhle reach the conference room on a rush, knowing they are late to the meeting. While Buhle is unfazed as he believes the Colonel’s delay is understandable given the handicaps of his wounds, Stauffenberg is fully aware that only through sheer luck he has managed to set everything up before having to leave the room in which he was “dressing”. With the clock ticking, both pieces of plastic explosive had been prepared at the last possible moment and put into the Colonel’s briefcase, ensuring that the blast would be as powerful as it possibly could [4]. Inside the room, General Heusinger – temporary Chief of the General Staff following Kurt Zeitzler’s breakdown – was already giving an exposition on the general state of the frontlines, but paused for a moment as Stauffenberg entered the room and was introduced to the Führer by Field Marshal Keitel. Hitler looked over to the young Colonel, and then shook his hand. Von Stauffenberg successfully hides the immense pressure he is facing, but it is no easy task. Even for a battle-hardened veteran, the role Stauffenberg has to play – not only assassinating the Führer, but ensuring the success of Valkyrie – is beyond critical. If the bomb fails to detonate or kill Hitler, if Stauffenberg is detained before leaving the Wolf’s Lair, if the Reserve Army can’t mobilize, then all will be lost for him and his comrades.\n\nAs the conference goes on for a few minutes, von Stauffenberg finally decides it’s time to leave the room as he sets up the briefcase as close as possible to Hitler. Although the fuse is set to last up to thirty minutes, the heat in the room makes it likely – as explained back in Berlin by Colonel von Quirnheim and others – that it could last as little as ten. He makes a signal to von Freyend (Keitel’s adjutant) that he needs to make a phone call, and the young officer leads him out of the room. Almost forgetting to take his hat and his belt [5], Stauffenberg begins to walk rapidly towards a nearby building, where General Fellgiebel and Lt. Haeften wait nearby a car. He hopes not to have attracted any suspicions, but his nerves have already almost betrayed him at a crucial moment. Just as Stauffenberg has left the room Heusinger is touching the subject of the defence of East Prussia (which brings the Colonel to the meeting), and to Hitler’s disappointment the officer is not there to answer a question regarding new divisions for the area.\n\nThe Colonel’s absence is most noted, and Hitler’s annoyance grows due to the avalanche of bad news from virtually all fronts. Colonel Brandt, one of the officers at the meeting, notices Stauffenberg’s briefcase and pushes it slightly forwards. As Heusinger points towards the Normandy in one of the maps, Hitler moves forward in order to look more closely. At about 12:42, as Stauffenberg and Fellgiebel have just saluted each other and while Hitler oversees the mounting ruin of the Third Reich in the map at the table, the explosives finally detonate.​\n\nOn the way to the Airfield:\n\n12:42 to 13:15 PM​\n\nThe loud explosion startles Stauffenberg, Fellgiebel and Haeften, neither of them expecting the blast to be so soon or that strong. Some of the other officers are almost nonplussed, one of them commenting on how usual it is for animals to step on the perimeter landmines [6]. Stauffenberg excuses himself on going straight for lunch with the camp’s commander, then enters the car obtained by Fellgiebel and orders the driver to move on. As the Colonel and his aide leave the area smoke is starting to come out of the main building, and more and more soldiers rush to the scene. Stauffenberg hears screams of horror. Having passed the first checkpoint easily, the others pose a challenge as the alarm has already been raised across Rastenburg. Calling a fellow officer back at the compound to obtain clearance, Stauffenberg finally makes it through the final checkpoint and into the airfield, where a He 111 provided by the conspirators awaits. At 13:15 PM, and barely believing their luck, Stauffenberg and Haeften begin their flight towards Berlin [7]. Stauffenberg can only hope that the blast has been enough to kill Hitler – infamous for inexplicably surviving countless others attempts -, and that his fellow conspirators are already enacting Valkyrie from Berlin. The flight to the capital will leave him uncommunicated.​\n\nBack at the Wolf’s Lair:\n\n12:42 to 14:00 PM​\n\nThe first men to rush towards the burning conference room are one of the Führer’s aides (Schaub) and Hitler’s valet (Linge), both terrified at not seeing anyone emerge from the rubble. Entering the wreckage, they look in horror at the grim display: more than two dozen bloodied and burnt corpses across the room, many of them barely recognizable. Seeing a familiar figure at one of the extremes, Schaub moves and then tends to an agonizing Field Marshal Keitel – who’ll perish in a matter of minutes – while Linge looks towards a nearby body. It doesn’t take long for the valet to recognize the man he’s served for years, just as von Hasselbach – the nearest doctor - and a cohort of SS troops enter as well. Hasselbach kneels besides the body and checks for vital signs as Linge and Schaub begin to tear up, which is followed by the now famous statement: “Der Führer… der Führer ist tot.” It is thus recorded that, at 12:43 PM of July 20th, 1944, Adolf Hitler was dead. But it did not stop there. Twenty-three other people were present at the meeting by the time the bomb went off, and the impact was large enough to kill all of them either instantly or within a few minutes, Field Marshal Keitel and Otto Gunsche being the last to perish [8].​\n\nMain Casualties of the Stauffenberg Bomb:\n\nAdolf Hitler, Führer of Germany\n\nField Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, Chief of the OKW\n\nGeneral Alfred Jodl, Keitel’s Chief of Staff\n\nGeneral Adolf Heusinger, Interim Chief of the General Staff\n\nGeneral Rudolf Schmundt, Chief of the Army Staff Office\n\nGeneral Walther Buhle, Chief of Army Staff at OKW\n\nGeneral Walter Warlimont, Deputy Chief of Staff at OKW\n\nGeneral Gunther Körten, Chief of Staff of the Luftwaffe\n\nLt. General Hermann Fegelein, SS Liason Officer\n\nVice Admiral Hans Erich Voss, Kriesgmarine Liason Officer\n\nIn addition to these men, the explosion also killed several officers serving as adjutants to the different Wehrmacht branches or to some high ranking officers present at the meeting, such as Air General Karl Bodenschatz, Colonels Nicholaus von Below, Heinrich Borgmann and Heinz Brandt, Rear Admiral Karl Jesko von Puttmaker, Captain Heinz Assman, and Majors Ernst von Freyend, Herbert Büchs and Walter Scherff. Also killed were diplomat Franz von Sonnleithner, bodyguard Otto Günsche and three stenographers: Berger, Buchholz and Waizenegger. Although the aides and adjutants were fairly irrelevant in the grand scheme of things, it was the Wehrmacht’s structure that Hitler had created that had just suffered an enormously crippling blow, losing not only its commander in chief in the Führer, but the Heads of the OKW (Keitel and Jodl), the Chief of the General Staff (Heusinger), Jodl’s Deputy (Warlimont), and key staff and operation officers (Buhle, Schmundt and Warlimont), all of which left a gaping hole in terms of leadership of the army.\n\nAs the officers in the Wolf’s Lair tried to make sense of the situation and placed the compound into as much of a lockdown as possible, chaos spreas quickly [9]. With the SS moving to find Brigadier General Rattenhuber (head of security) and Lt. Colonel Struve (camp commander), the mangled bodies are quickly taken out of the room in fear of more explosives. Fellgiebel, recognizing this is his best chance to try and manipulate communications, orders his staff to enforce a full communication black-out, with emphasis on blocking communications from the SS. Having personally seen Hitler’s body, at around 13:10 Fellgiebel successfully calls Lt. General Thiele (his chief of Staff in Berlin) to inform him of the deaths of Hitler, Keitel and Jodl, ordering him to relay the info to General Olbricht as soon as possible. The General also contacts Colonel Hahn, fellow conspirator and subordinate at the nearby Mauerwald OKH HQ, and orders him to disconnect a couple of stations nearby, further complicating communications and leaving the Wolf’s Lair as isolated from those not involved in the conspiracy as his authority allows (with the SS having a channel out of his authority) [10].\n\nIt does not take long for Martin Bormann (and Rattenhuber) to arrive at the scene, forced to come to terms almost immediately with the sudden demise of the Führer. A horrified Bormann ponders on his mind both the implications and potential culprits: the political succession of the Reich is left almost wide open due to Goering’s blatant unsuitability as a would-be Führer – the succession decree notwithstanding [11] – and what Bormann suspects is the near-incontrollable ambition of Himmler, of Speer, and of more than a few Generals. If this is part of a coordinated plot it is likely that any conspirators might attempt something else (even killing other prominent figures), and even if not, Bormann is not only aware of how damaging a succession struggle would be… he knows he is not currently in a position to win one, certainly not with a close ally like Keitel dead [12].\n\nTasking the shell-shocked Rattenhuber with an immediate investigation on the attack, Bormann resolves to move as fast as possible and find a temporary solution to the crisis. He resolves to inform Himmler, Doenitz, Goering and Goebbels and have them summoned to Rastenburg.\n\nIt is around this time that events start to happen in Berlin.​\n\n_____________________________________________\n\nNotes for Part I:\n\n[1] Fellgiebel, of course, was involved in the aborted 1938 coup planned by Beck, Halder and others in case war was to break out over Czechoslovakia, with Fellgiebel tasked to cut communications through Germany.\n\n[2] Name given to the Reserve Army HQ, since it was based on the Bendlerblock in Berlin.\n\n[3] This is the POD, chosen because of its sheer simplicity. Fellgiebel does not leave a call for Stauffenberg that interrupts the Colonel as he is preparing the bombs.\n\n[4] In OTL, Fellgiebel’s call forced an aide to interrupt Stauffenberg, ensuring a single explosive was used. Here, they have two, ensuring any blast will be lethal regardless of Brandt moving the briefcase away from Hitler.\n\n[5] A simple detail, which in OTL made the driver suspicious of the Colonel. Here, probably more confident due to being able to set both explosives, Stauffenberg does take his hat and belt.\n\n[6] OTL, although this one was a surprise to read about.\n\n[7] It took a lot of courage and luck for Stauffenberg to get through to the plane to Berlin, but with even greater confusion and considering the situation I think he would have managed to get the airfield here as well.\n\n[8] Despite all disadvantages, had both pieces of explosive been used everyone in the room would have died. Most of them instantly given the blast.\n\n[9] Plainly speaking, everybody at the Wolf’s Lair were caught with their pants down in the OTL attempt, and it was the slightly wounded Nicholas von Below who took decisive action first, arranging for several orders that were crucial in retrospect because of their early timing. But of course, ITTL von Below and most of the senior officers are dead. I do not know who else of high rank was there at the moment of the explosion (Himmler and Goering are in East Prussia, but not in Rastenburg), and neither Stieff nor Fellgiebel have the rank to give orders around, so Bormann and Rattenhuber will have to do.\n\n[10] All of this minus successfully relaying Hitler’s death instead of his survival is OTL. Fellgiebel did as much as he could, but the expectations placed from Berlin were always too high related to his actual powers. Still, this is a key detail, because here he can inform the plotters early enough that Hitler is indeed dead, an overlooked factor in the almost suicidal delays for Valkyrie.\n\n[11] On one side, Goering does have an official decree which names him as successor to Hitler. On the other, not only is he despised by the public, the military and the party alike, his own Luftwaffe subordinates and party rivals try to get him removed from power basically every month. The degree of loyalty that Goering might nonetheless command is, however, a source of debate. This will be covered on greater detail.\n\n[12] Obviously, Bormann built most of his power on having full access to Hitler as his gatekeeper and from his handling of his schedule, but he had a “back-up”: his alliance with Keitel, Lammers, and at times Heinrich Müller as well, allowing him to influence the military, Gestapo and the bureaucracy. Here, not only has Bormann lost his patron, he has lost his link to the military leadership than can give orders (Keitel), meaning that all he has left is his bureaucratic lieutenants at the Party and Reich Chancellery and possibly Müller.\n\nII.\n\nJuly 1944:\n\nHimmler’s paranoia forces him to make a move,\n\nwith dramatic consecuences\n\nJuly 20th, 1944\n\nReserve Army HQ, Berlin:\n\n13:10 to 15:00 PM​\n\nRight after receiving Fellgiebel’s call from Rastenburg regarding the success of the assassination, Lt. General Thiele rushes to inform General Fredrich Olbricht – head of the General Army Office and key conspirator – and his chief of staff, Colonel Mertz von Quirnheim. The three men are both ecstatic and relieved to hear that, at last, they have finally managed to succeed in their mission to get rid of Hitler. And yet, as Mertz von Quirnheim points out, the hard part of the task begins now. Despite thinking it necessary to take some time for extra arrangements, von Quirnheim presses onto Olbricht the need to immediately place the Reserve Army (Erzatzheer) in alert, establish contact with the rest of the plotters and, above all, break the news of Hitler’s death to their superior: General Fromm, the man whose authority is crucial to properly commence and execute Valkyrie. Olbricht then places a call to General Eduard Wagner – Quartermaster General – at OKH HQ in Zossen, informing him of the assassination and asking him to make preparations for the eventual arrival of Field Marshal Erwin von Witzleben [13].\n\nMertz von Quirnheim then sets Phase One of Valkyrie in motion, placing units across Berlin in full alert. Shortly afterwards, Olbricht and Quirnheim grab the set of documents needed to authorize Valkyrie from a safe in the Bendlerstrasse, and rush towards Fromm’s office to inform him and hopefully persuade him to grant immediate authorization for their plans. Fromm, who had already lost faith in the conspiracy ever since the failure of July 15th (and who remained outraged at the usurpation of his authority that day to mobilize the Reserve Army) is not particularly surprised when he hears of von Stauffenberg making an attempt, but expresses his clear disbelief at the Führer’s death. Having suspected such a situation might arise, Olbricht contacts Fellgiebel at the Wolf’s Lair, giving Fromm a direct line. Asking for Field Marshal Keitel, Fromm hears it directly from Bormann - the only one prepared to talk to him – that Hitler, Keitel, Jodl and several others are dead. Afterwards, the General almost collapses into his seat. To the frustration of Olbricht and Quirnheim, he demands to be left alone for a few moments, the orders for Valkyrie still on his desk.\n\nAround 14:40 Fromm emerges from his office and into the room where the two plotters wait for him. Handing Quirnheim the signed folder, he instructs him to begin Phase Two as soon as possible, and eventually implement the entire plan [14]. Fromm warns Olbricht that even at this stage his participation remains very much conditional – to Olbricht’s disbelief - and he also makes it clear he will not tolerate any sort of insubordination from Reserve Army officers. By 15:00 PM, a group of plotters already inside the Bendlerstrasse has joined Fromm and Olbricht, including former panzer commander General Hoepner, Counts von Schulenburg and Yorck von Wartenburg, and Stauffenberg’s brother Berthold. Officers and staff at the Reserve Army HQ are informed of Hitler’s death and the assumption of military and political power by Beck and von Witzleben, the unspoken assumption being that the SS – and possibly key party members – are plotting a coup against the state. Beck is expected to arrive within the hour, and Field Marshal Witzleben is preparing to travel to Zossen. Goerdeler, the likely candidate for Chancellor, remains hiding from the Gestapo, unlikely to be contacted until the morning of the next day. With Fromm’s temporary – and reluctant - support, the coup is now in motion.​\n\nThe Wolf’s Lair:\n\n14:00 PM to 18:00 PM\n\n​\n\nFrom the men that were to be contacted by Bormann after Hitler’s death and summoned to Rastenburg, Goebbels would receive the news too late to leave Berlin and Himmler would laconically express his inability to attend a meeting – fueling Bormann’s growing paranoia -, thus making it unable for all of the seemingly key players within the Reich to be on the same spot at once. The first one to obey Bormann’s summons and arrive at the Wolf’s Lair was Joachim von Ribbentrop, who hardly had any time to mourn the Führer before Reichsmarshall Hermann Goering finally made his appearance sometime after 2:00 PM, using his private train to enter Rastenburg. For all the decadent days Goering experienced around that time, July 20th did not saw him on a drug induced frenzy, but it did found him on a particularly aggressive state of mind. Indeed, the Reichsmarshall wasted no time to harshly berate Bormann him in front of the staff for the security lapses that led to Hitler’s demise, along with Bormann’s failure to secure the immediate attendance of Goebbels and Himmler. An infuriated Bormann, about to inform Goering of his growing suspicions regarding the missing Colonel Stauffenberg, bit his tongue and decided not to bring up the issue [15].\n\nMatters are made worse when it is announced that Mussolini’s arrival via special train is imminent. Goering – who intensely dislikes Mussolini – declines to go to receive the Duce and forces von Ribbentrop to go to the station despite the Minister’s protests. Learning from Hamburg that Grand Admiral Doenitz has boarded a plane at 14:50 PM and is expected soon, Goering is forced to give the visibly shaken and even emotional Mussolini a tour of the Wolf’s Lair so he can pay his respects to the fallen Führer. Sitting down to drink some tea after the arrival of Doenitz from Hamburg and to Bormann’s increasing annoyance, Goering boasts of his new position as Hitler’s successor and begins to speak at length on his plans on Europe and his belief that “things need to change”. As Field Marshal Graziani – who came with Mussolini – asks whether some knowledge of the culprit is available, the Italians watch in increasing disbelief as Goering launches a tirade against Himmler and the SS first, then against Ribbentrop when the latter attempts to stop Goering from launching accusations. An attempt by Bormann to intervene only makes matters worse, as Goering charges them both with incompetence [16], Doenitz choosing to stay out of the discussion.\n\nIt does not take long for Mussolini and Graziani to propose suspending the meeting until the situation is more clarified, and the Reichsmarshall is happy to oblige them. It is around that time (18:00), that Fellgiebel’s blackout begins to slowly falter. Goering, Ribbentrop and Bormann receive a series of disturbing news: Rumors state that both SS and Heer units are moving across the streets of Berlin, with a report stating that gunfire has erupted through the capital. A stunned Goering orders Fellgiebel to contact Himmler and Fromm immediately, demanding to know what’s going on. A few minutes later, Fellgiebel reports the Bendlerstrasse cannot be reached and that Himmler is out of contact, last seen departing his village for Berlin with Kaltenbrunner in tow. As Mussolini’s train starts the journey back to Northern Italy and Bormann quietly slithers away to receive a phone call from Müller, Goering continues to fume and demands to be put through to the OKH/OKW HQ immediately. Grand Admiral Doenitz, sitting quietly and alone, begins to seriously consider the possibility of a coup within the party and military structures being in progress. The question is… by whom?​\n\nGansenstein Village and Berlin:\n\n13:00 to 16:00 PM\n\n​\n\nIt was through the SS’s own communications channel at Rastenburg that the Reichsführer SS, Heinrich Himmler, was informed of the explosion at the Wolf's Lair no less than twenty minutes after Hitler’s demise. Himmler and his subordinates spent the next few moments in deep consideration, and then suspended their meeting to allow Himmler to immediately phone Ernst Kaltenbrunner at the Security HQ in Berlin. Upon informing Kaltenbrunner and as they discuss Hiitler's death, both men immediately suspect the resistance groups within the army, and realize that should that be the case – as they themselves have failed to take certain actions which might have prevented the situation - both of them are in serious danger [17] either by the actions of any potential plotters in the event of a coordinated plot, or via an attempt by Goering, Bormann and other members of the government to remove them from any possible succession crisis. Furthermore, Himmler does not believe for a moment that Bormann or Goering aren’t already mobilizing for support and/or considering ways to neutralize his SS.\n\nHaving experienced severe manpower shortages through the middle of the year due to the continuous creation of Waffen-SS units for the battlefield, it had been only five days ago that Hitler had granted Himmler permission to recruit men for the SS from the Reserve Army units, a key disposition that nonetheless had not been started at that point. While Himmler thought that most if not all of the SS combat units would stand with him should the need arise, virtually all of those combat ready divisions where fighting in the Balkans, Normandy or the East, each of them locked in battles harsh enough to make it virtually impossible that they could be quickly redeployed to Germany itself. Nonetheless, Himmler felt he could still rely on his police units, guard camps, a few parachuting regiments, a few units in formation in Austria and Bohemia-Moravia, and potentially a few regiments in Berlin as well. As a result, both Kaltenbrunner and Himmler agreed that putting down a potential putsch by the army and seizing the security services was vital to their survival, and might prove crucial in an upcoming struggle for the leadership of the nation.\n\nThe call is interrupted by an SS officer, who informs Himmler that Bormann is summoning him to come at the Wolf's Lair at the earliest possible moment. Although Gansenstein is only half an hour away from Rastenburg, Himmler nonetheless hesitates, and privately wonders not only why is Bormann - whom Himmler has increasingly seen a threat for the last few months - trying to \"run the show\", but whether it is safe to go to Rastenburg at all. Himmler resolves to ignore the summon, orders Kaltenbrunner to keep a close eye in Berlin until his arrival that afternoon, and starts placing further calls to Kaltenbrunner and the entire security apparatus at the Prinz Albrechtstrasse. Kripo Chief Arthur Nebe is first, being tasked by immediate investigation of the assassination. Gestapo Chief Müller follows, receiving orders to arrest key individuals in Berlin – including Stauffenberg -, and Walter Schellenberg is warned of a potential coup and ordered to stay vigilant. Finally, Himmler manages to reach whom he thinks is the most reliable officer he can find in the Berlin area: the infamous Lt. Colonel Otto Skorzeny. Breaking the news of Hitler’s demise to him and presenting it as the result of a conspiracy, Himmler orders the outraged Skorzeny to gather SS units and work with Kaltenbrunner and loyal Heer formations to ensure the safety of the capital. Temporarily satisfied, the Reichsführer and his lieutenants board their cars for the nearest airport and prepare to reach Berlin as soon as possible. After all, they reason, there is little point in allowing Goering – or any possible rival – to mobilize first.\n\nWhat Himmler fails to realize, however, is that Nebe is already a conspirator, Schellenberg has withheld knowledge of the plot for himself, and Müller has already secretly sided with Bormann weeks, if not months, ago [18].​\n\nBerlin Area:\n\n15:00 to 17:00 PM\n\n​\n\nAlthough most of the key figures of the Third Reich were absent from Berlin in that particular day – Hitler and Bormann at the Wolf’s Lair, and Doenitz, Himmler and Goering elsewhere -, left in the city were still key members of the bureaucracy and the security services, and more importantly Reichministers Speer, Funk and Goebbels, who spent the morning at the Propaganda Ministry at a venue designed to raise the morale of fellow ministers, functionaries and selected journalists. It was Speer’s task of delivering the main speech that resumed the call for resistance and total war, which drew a healthy round of applause. Having refused General Fromm’s invitation for lunch, Speer shared a glass of wine with Funk and Goebbels before leaving for his ministry [19]. Due to Fellgiebel’s blackout of communications and the chaos at Rastenburg it takes a while for Press Chief Otto Dietrich to finally contact Goebbels, breaking the news of the Führer’s death. Goebbels, grief stricken and in shock, resolves to depart to Rastenburg. Alas, before Goebbels can depart to the airport the Reserve Army begins to mobilize and spreads through the streets of Berlin, reaching the outskirts of the Propaganda Ministry very soon due to a last minute change in planning.\n\nKripo Chief Arthur Nebe informs the Bendlerstrasse that Himmler has contacted him from East Prussia, which makes Himmler’s surprise arrest virtually impossible [20]. Quirnheim and General Paul von Hase, the City Commander, convene that the greater threat within Berlin is Goebbels, and therefore task Nebe with his arrest (thus replacing Major Remer, a seemingly unreliable officer, from performing this task). Nebe rushes with a group of his men and a company of Reserve Army troops, and blocks the exits to the Propaganda Ministry as the phone lines are cut. Desperate attempts from Goebbels to contact Rastenburg, the Bendlerstrasse or Speer meet in failure, and soon afterwards the lines are cut. Realizing the gravity of the situation Goebbels tries to find a way to seek help or escape alongside his press adjutant von Oven, only for the Kripo to storm the building. Nebe and his men eventually break into Goebbels’s office, informing him of his arrest for treason against the party. Realizing a coup is taking place by the army, and believing the SS to be involved due to Nebe’s presence, Goebbels’s psyche gives in as he finds the situation to be hopeless. Before the Kripo can intervene he bites a cyanide capsule, violently collapsing to the floor. A few minutes afterwards, a messenger reports to the Bendlerstrasse that Minister Goebbels is dead [21].\n\nStauffenberg and von Haeften land in Berlin at 15:45 after escaping from the Wolf’s Lair, being escorted along with General Beck to the Reserve Army HQ as they unwittingly miss an SS squad by minutes. With the support of City Commander von Hase, orders begin to pour out to the Berlin units, to the Wehrkreise (military districts), and to key cites like Prague, Paris and Warsaw. The beginning of these orders will become famous (or infamous): “The Führer Adolf Hitler is dead! An unscrupulous clique of party leaders alien to the front has attempted, under the exploitation of this situation, to betray the hard-struggling front and to seize power for their own selfish purposes...” Included in the message as well is the proclamation of General Beck as Head of State, and Field Marshal von Witzleben as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces. Despite Fromm being forced to arrest the Commander of Wehrkreis III (Berlin), General von Kortzfleisch, due to insubordination [22], the other officers in Berlin follow orders, and troops begin to mobilize across the capital. Supported by Nebe’s Kripo and the Berlin Police under conspirator Count von Helldorf, ministries and offices are locked down and scads of party members, SS officers and bureaucrats are taken prisoner, including men like Ley, Funk, Lammers and other key Nazi personnel.\n\nA crisis, however, begins at around 16:30. It is around this time Skorzeny begins to enter the center of Berlin followed by several companies of SS men, being blocked by a Reserve Army unit led by Major Remer. Hoping to avoid friendly fire Skorzeny tries to ask Remer to stand down, unaware that the Major has received strict orders to arrest SS officers. A botched attempt to capture Skorzeny on the street results in a gunfight between the Reserve Army and the SS, Skorzeny barely escaping with his life as Remer is riddled with bullets. Around the same time SS Oberführer Humbert Achamer-Pifrader and a Gestapo squadron arrive at the Bendlerstrasse on Müller’s command, bringing orders for the arrest of von Stauffenberg, who just arriving by car. Reserve Army troops try surround the Gestapo officers, who nonetheless attempt to fire at the Colonel as another gunfight breaks out in the street.\n\nBy 17:00 PM, the SS, Gestapo and security services are in a shooting war with the Reserve Army.​\n\n_____________________________________________\n\nNotes for Part II:\n\n[13] The butterflies begin to spread! In OTL, Olbricht is informed that Hitler lives, but Fellgiebel’s wording regarding von Stauffenberg is ambiguous enough to make it look like no attempt took place at all. I’ve decided to go with Peter Hoffman’s take on the situation, that being that Olbricht, unaware that the bomb had actually gone off IOTL initially thought it was a situation similar to July 15th and thus a coup was either futile or too much of a risk. Here, it is clear Hitler is dead and the attempt was successful, emboldening Olbricht and preventing a decisive two-hour delay.\n\n[14] Fromm knew very well what Stauffenberg was up to. Stauffenberg told him point blank, and despite his constant ambiguity he personally told Stauffenberg not to forget about Keitel if he attempted a coup. In this scenario, not only is Hitler gone (and Fromm has reliable information), but also Keitel and a good part of the Wehrmacht command. Fromm, highly ambitious despite his caution, knows there’s a real vacuum in power to be filled, and much as he may not like Olbricht events show he did have some faith in Stauffenberg. As we will see later on, Fromm’s attitude is far more complex and opportunistic than it seems to the plotters, but I feel it’s perfectly reasonable that in this particular context and in the absence of Hitler and Keitel he would give Valkyrie the greenlight whilst keeping an open mind about the future. Fromm was, if anything, prepared to be flexible, which led to his OTL death.\n\n[15] Bormann is one crafty fellow, but also one to hold grudges, and he and Goering did not get along at all. Knowing how much of a mess Goering is at this point and looking as his own actions in July 20th and in April 1945, I have no doubt he would not be able to rise up to the occasion, and would unnecessarily antagonize his rival. Bormann, in response, would probably be only too happy to undermine Goering and begin to think about the future.\n\n[16] Seeing that Goering and Ribbentrop were at each other’s throats in OTL July 20th and the Foreign Minister probably feels a lot more entitled to speak his mind without Hitler around, chances are this meeting with Mussolini would turn into a mess as well, presenting a very inauspicious start to Goering’s aspirations as the next Führer.\n\n[17] I don’t subscribe to any conspiracy theories of Himmler being a part of the 20 July Plot, but there are factors we simply cannot overlook. Himmler had been contacted at least once by the plotters through indirect means; with one associate of Carl Goerdeler bluntly offering support should Himmler overthrow Hitler to end the war. Far from having him arrested, thus uncovering the plots of Tresckow and the Army Group Centre officers, Himmler did nothing, and it appears he had privately expressed suspicions that some officers were plotting against Hitler. Whether this is negligence, underestimating the conspiracy or something else I don’t plan to speculate on, but the facts are these:\n\nHimmler has expressed openly his utter contempt for Goering, going as far to declare that should something happen to Hitler he would see to it that the Reichsmarshall would not become Führer. Not only that, Himmler knows that Goering knows of his hostility, which on this environment and given the paranoid court Hitler (and Bormann) were running can only predispose both men to a conflict. But to make matters truly worse, Himmler realizes that if word gets out to Bormann or Goering that he did nothing to stop the plot – whatever his motives were -, he’s finished. That, above all, would mean he needs to get into action far sooner he would prefer too.\n\nI suppose the jury is still out on the extent of knowledge Kaltenbrunner had, but neither the Gestapo nor the security services had been particularly effective despite slowly closing in the Valkyrie plotters through July. A similar accusation can be levelled against him by his rivals since to merely arrest Goerdeler or others that were targeted a few days ago might have stopped the conspiracy, and since he realizes that, I believe it plausible Himmler and him would join forces out of their belief that they position is in danger.\n\n[18] Believe it or not, Müller – who clearly excelled at his work – presented Himmler with concrete evidence of plotting within the General Staff, particularly through Admiral Canaris. Himmler’s response? He told Müller to simply drop the case. As a result, Müller would then enter in an informal pact with Bormann in OTL.\n\n[19] Minor butterflies again, as Goebbels was contacted and informed while meeting with Funk and Speer, and would later insist on having Speer nearby as he set his crucial countermoves in place. With sheer chaos at Rastenburg and with Fellgiebel doing his best to make communications hard for those outside the plot, Speer and Funk leave before Goebbels is informed.\n\n[20] Nebe was supposed to take a dozen policemen or so to arrest and kill Himmler on the day of the plot, but the signal for him never arrived because, inexplicably, the plotters neglected the fact that Himmler was not in Berlin! (seriously, amateurish stuff) Here, with an earlier and better coordinated plan due to greater clarity regarding Hitler’s death, orders are changed accordingly and Nebe – a more determined conspirator - is sent after Goebbels, who can’t talk his way out of the situation like he did with Remer.\n\n[21] Goebbels showed little inclination to survive Hitler in OTL, and as far as he knows Berlin is already falling to a coup. The emotional distress he would probably go through makes me think he’s likely to kill himself before surrendering to Nebe – which, ITTL hindsight, would have been the right choice for him -.\n\n[22] Pretty much OTL. This particular General never believed in Hitler’s death, and had to be arrested by Beck and Olbricht after disobeying orders. Chances are he wouldn’t believe Fromm either, so he gets arrested here as well."
