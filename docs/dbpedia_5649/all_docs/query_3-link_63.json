        "text": "The abortive putsch of the Junkers against Hitler was sheer melodrama. But it was more—it was the last gasp of one of Europe’s historic power groups; its story, pieced together here from many publications, has important implications not only for the historian, but for all those concerned with reconstructing Germany along democratic lines.\n\n_____________\n\nEarly in the morning of July 21, 1944 all German radio stations suddenly interrupted their programs, and Hans Fritsche, Chief of the Radio Division of the Reich Ministry of Propaganda, came to the microphone to announce that the Fuehrer would address the nation. A moment later Hider’s hysterical voice was heard: “I am speaking to you,” he said, “first in order to prove to you that I am unhurt and healthy, second, to inform you of a crime unparalleled in German history. A very small clique of ambitious, criminal, and stupid officers have plotted to assassinate me. . . . a very small group of criminal elements . . . who are now being liquidated without mercy. . . .”\n\nMost Germans, tired and depressed, received the news apathetically. Moscow, in its unrelenting effort to increase the ranks of German deserters, made full propagandistic use of this story of an attempted coup d’état. In London and Washington there were two schools of opinion: one believed the whole plot was a fake, created by the Gestapo in order to get rid of a number of disaffected officers; the other group thought that the story rang true, but that the putsch could not have greatly affected the course of the literature war even had it been successful, since any successor of Hitler could only continue the Nazi efforts to gain a negotiated peace, with the Allies remaining firm on unconditional surrender.\n\nThe July plot was real enough. Himmler, made virtual dictator on the morrow of its failure, “purged” the Third Reich of hundreds and possibly thousands of adversaries of the Nazi regime, to prolong its life for another three hundred days.\n\nThe plot now takes a central place in the dispute on total German guilt between the Vansittartites, who claim there couldn’t have been any German underground because the Germans—unlike the French or the Czechs—lack civil courage and the passion for freedom, and the anti-Vansittartites, who tend to exaggerate the German resistance to Hitler. There is also a real danger that a legend may develop in Germany on the basis of the plot, magnifying it into another “Dolchstoss” (stab-in-the-back) fable about an undefeated German army destroyed by traitors in the rear. Thus it is of more than historical importance to get at the full truth about the plot.\n\n_____________\n\nDuring the war several books were published that tried to portray Germany as an anti-Nazi cauldron, seething with rebellion and kept down only by the ruthlessness of the Gestapo.1 Some writers spoke of “millions” of German anti-Nazis held in concentration camps. But after the war it was discovered that in the twelve years and twelve weeks of the Third Reich no more than 800,000 persons of German origin had been arrested by the Gestapo for anti-Nazi activities (see Der Tagesspiegel, American-licensed Berlin newspaper, March 29, 1947). A striking number—and yet it means that hardly more than one per cent of Europe’s German-speaking population took serious risks to resist Hitler.\n\nNow we can look to the revelations made by some of the participants in the July plot for further light on the state of German resistance under Hitler. Since May 1945 a number of personal accounts by such participants have been published, and these have been supplemented lately by the book of an American OSS chief in Switzerland.\n\nUlrich von Hassell (1881-1944) was one of the few German civilians to take an active part in the July plot. A conservative imbued with Christian ideals, he resigned his post as German ambassador to Rome in 1937 in proest against the formation of the Berlin-Rome Axis. He was executed by the Nazis a few weeks after the failure of the plot, but the Gestapo failed to discover his diaries, which have now been published by his son (Vom andern Deutschland, Zurich, 1946).\n\nHans Bernd Gisevius was thirty-two when the Nazis came to power. A member of Alfred Hugenberg’s strongly monarchist and anti-Marxist German National People’s party, Gisevius claims to have been firmly anti-Nazi from the beginning, although he did accept a job with the Gestapo. Be that as it may, from 1940 on he was in touch with the Allies. Stationed in Zurich as German vice-consul, he collaborated with the OSS and made frequent trips from Switzerland to Berlin to aid the conspirators. By sheer luck he escaped the Gestapo after the plot, and the two volumes of memoirs he has published since the war (Bis zum bittern Ende, Zurich, 1946) are essential material for the history of the Nazi era, even though some of his statements are open to suspicion, especially when he attempts to whitewash Schacht. Gisevius was an important witness against some of the defendants in the Nuremberg trial.\n\nBeyond any controversy is the figure of Fabian von Schlabrendorff, who belonged to a student organization at Halle that constantly fought the Nazis, and who was a disciple and intimate friend of the noted Halle jurist, Max Fleischmann, a Jew. In 1943, when he was a lieutenant in the German army, Schlabrendorff made an unsuccessful attempt on Hitler’s life. He was arrested after the July plot, but the death of the judge in an American air raid saved him from trial. Together with Niemoeller, Léon Blum, Kurt Schuschnigg, and other prominent prisoners of the Nazis, he was rescued by the American army in May 1945 while being transported through the Tyrol. After his liberation Schlabrendorff dictated his story to Gero v.S. Gaevernitz, an American of German origin who worked in Switzerland for the OSS (They Almost Killed Hitler, New York, Macmillan, 1947).\n\nIt is, however, the chief of Gaevernitz’ OSS unit, Allen Welsh Dulles, who has given us the first comprehensive history of that section of the German underground whose position was most directly represented in the July coup (Germany’s Underground, New York, Macmillan, 1947). From these volumes one can gain a fairly clear idea of the German resistance movement and of the steps that led to the climax of July 2,0, 1944.\n\n_____________\n\nSchlabrendorff speaks of Colonel General Ludwig Beck as the brains of the conspiracy, and of Dr. Carl Friedrich Goerdeler as its heart. Beck was not a Junker, but came of Huguenot stock, and his father and father-in-law were prominent scholars. He was among the few German generals who opposed the Prussian brand of militarism, and he had been sincerely devoted to the Weimar Republic. Despite his opposition to Hitler he continued to serve as Chief of Staff of the German army, trusting, like many other German patriots, that Hitlerism was a transitory phenomenon. But in the summer of 1938 he finally resigned from his post, after sternly warning Hitler against war. The pogroms of the same year opened his eyes still further. After the failure of the July plot he committed suicide.\n\nGoerdeler was the most prominent of the civilians involved in the attempted coup d’état—and, indeed, the Nazis referred to the plot as the “Goerdeler Putsch.” Bruening, who had appointed him price administrator in 1931, had also wanted the conservative but uncompromisingly anti-Nazi Goerdeler to succeed him as chancellor, considering him the man most likely to hold back the Nazis.\n\nEven under the Nazi regime, Goerdeler managed to retain his post as mayor of Leipzig, though he was known as an anti-Nazi. In 1936, however, he resigned in protest at the removal of Leipzig’s Felix Mendelssohn monument. Afterwards Goerdeler made many trips abroad, warning British, French, and American statesmen of the imminent danger of a world war and trying to enlist aid for the German anti-Nazi underground. Had the coup of July 1944 been successful, Goerdeler would have become chancellor of Germany. After the failure of the plot he went into hiding but was caught and executed.\n\nA peculiar role was played by Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, chief of the military intelligence division of the German High Command. Canaris had hated the Weimar Republic, and had worked with the militarists and reactionaries to overthrow it; he was very active in the secret rearming of Germany before 1933. Nevertheless he came to loathe the Nazis and their methods, especially because of the atrocities committed by them in Eastern Europe. He used his position to color the information on which Hitler based his military decisions; in this way, he was instrumental in discouraging the Fuehrer from attempting an invasion of Spain. Canaris did not join the conspiracy but confined himself to protecting the conspirators in his own service-among them his chief assistant, Major General Hans Oster—and permitting them to use the facilities of the intelligence organization for their anti-Nazi activities. Schlabrendorff believes that Canaris felt too old to take an active part in the conspiracy; Gisevius ascribes his passive role to a feeling that German guilt was so great that nothing should be done to help the nation escape just punishment for its crimes. In any case, Canaris was hanged by the Nazis in April 1945.\n\n_____________\n\nWe need not here identify the rest of the dramatis personae at length. Most of the plotters and their sympathizers were army officers, but there were also some labor leaders and young professionals. The latter centered around Helmuth von Moltke, whose group was known among the conspirators as the “Kreisau Circle,” after Moltke’s Upper Silesian estate where many of the anti-Nazis regularly met. Young Moltke, a great-grand-nephew of the famous field marshal of 1870, was far more liberal than other Junkers; he had divided his ancestral estate among his tenants and he showed open contempt for the Nazis. As an expert on international law attached to the German General Staff, he was able to travel abroad, forming contacts with Allied leaders and warning anti-Nazi Germans.\n\nThe Kreisau Circle also included Peter Yorck, descendant of the famous Prussian general of 1812; Theodor Steltzer, who had been active in the movement for adult education and was one of the few conspirators to escape execution; and Adam von Trott zu Solz. The latter, a graduate of Göttingen University, had been to Oxford on a Rhodes scholarship and had lived and studied in the Far East and the United States. Returning to Germany after the outbreak of the war, he became a Foreign Office official, traveling frequently to neutral countries, where he kept Allied representatives informed of the plans and wishes of the German underground. On his return to Germany after one of these trips, during which he made contact with Madame Kollontay, Russian Ambassador to Sweden, he was arrested by the Gestapo and subsequently executed.\n\nTrott zu Solz was one of the few activists in the Kreisau circle, most of whose members suffered from a certain lack of decision, a romantic Weltfremdheit that kept them out of touch with reality. They wished to run the world on the basis of the Sermon on the Mount. Taking their Christian Socialism seriously, they wanted to nationalize heavy industry, the banks, insurance companies, etc.; they dreamed of the political decentralization of Germany and the establishment of a federation of German states in which Prussia would no longer be dominant, and they favored the total abolition of the German army, and punishment of German war criminals. They dreamed also of a family of nations, a commonwealth of Europe (including Soviet Russia) in which the national sovereignty of each country would be limited. Yet most of these idealists were hesitant about taking direct part in any plot to kill Hitler. In this hesitancy they showed again the old inability of many German intellectuals and liberals to embody their ideals in action; faced with a reality that required the implementation of means as well as the statement of ends, they felt themselves bankrupt. . . .\n\nAny account of the plot would be incomplete without at least a few remarks about the man who actually handled the bomb that almost killed Hitler: Colonel Count Claus Schenk von Stauffenberg. At the time of the attempt, he was attached to the General Staff. In the North African fighting, he had lost one eye, his right hand, and two fingers of his left hand. Stauffenberg came of an old Catholic family of Southern Germany. He was a brave man but, like his less resolute friends of the Kreisau Circle, politically confused. He hated Hitler because he had betrayed socialism. He dreamed of a sort of “national bolshevism,” and was willing to see it introduced with the aid of the Red Army rather than permit a revival of “rotten bourgeois liberalism.”\n\n_____________\n\nThese were to become the chief figures in a drama that actually began in 1933 but did not develop substantially until a few years later. In January 1933, General Kurt von Hammerstein, one of the few democratic Reichswehr generals (called the “Red general” because of his sympathies with progressive elements), urged a military putsch to prevent Hitler’s appointment as chancellor, but he was frustrated by Hindenburg, who bluntly told him to mind his own business.\n\nAfter the Reichstag fire, nearly all prominent anti-Nazis remaining in Germany were jailed or killed. This left the initiative in any anti-Nazi plans almost exclusively with the generals. Moral scruples aside, many experienced German military men conceded that a war started by Germany would recoil into a catastrophe, since she would find the entire world united against her. During the Munich crisis—in the late summer of 1938—General Franz Halder told the conspirators around Goerdeler that he would order his troops to arrest Hitler and his gang if Hitler ordered a direct assault on Czechoslovakia. This, of course, came to nothing. The apparatus was again mobilized in the beginning of 1939 when the conspirators learned that Hitler was planning to occupy all of Czechoslovakia, at which time Goerdeler, Hassell, and other anti-Nazis endeavored to convince the generals that this time the Western powers would actually resist. Again General Halder promised to arrest Hitler—provided that war was declared.\n\nIn the first months of the war, about November 1939, all was made ready again for a coup d’état, to be carried out by a section of the General Staff. Troops were ordered into Berlin—but, in the erroneous belief that the plot had been betrayed, the generals (a handful of men including Field Marshal Erwin von Witzleben in addition to Beck, Oster, and others) abandoned their plans. And during the next two years those generals who thought that Hitler could not win saw themselves outnumbered and overborne by colleagues whose natural obsequiousness toward Hitler was increased by the unparalleled successes of the German army.\n\nThe situation changed when the Red army held fast at Stalingrad and the Nazis suffered defeats in Africa. It was in March 1943 that Schlabrendorff—then adjutant to General Henning von Tresckow of the General Staff, himself a convinced anti-Nazi and a party to Schlabrendorff’s plans—succeeded in planting a time bomb in a plane that carried Hitler back to headquarters from a visit to the Russian front. When the news came that Hitler had arrived safely, Schlabrendorff rushed to East Prussia, risking his life to retrieve the bomb in order to prevent discovery of the entire plot.\n\n_____________\n\nBy the middle of 1944 the anti-Nazis realized that they could wait no longer if Germany was to be saved from utter destruction. The Allies had landed in Normandy, and the Red army was opening a major offensive in White Russia. Thereupon Stauffenberg, the most active of the conspirators, volunteered to kill Hitler. If the attempt succeeded, General Beck was to announce over the Deutschland-Sender that Hitler was dead and that he, Beck, was now chief of state. Meanwhile the anti-Nazi generals would arrest all leading Nazis, and a cabinet would be formed with Goerdeler as chancellor and the Social-Democrat Leuschner as vice-chancellor. Among the generals who were expected to back up the conspirators were such leading figures as Field Marshal Rommel; General Count Heinrich von Stuelpnagel, Military Governor of France; General von Falkenhausen, Military Governor of Belgium; and Field Marshal von Kluge.\n\nStauffenberg went to Hitler’s headquarters in East Prussia and managed to place a time bomb in a briefcase under the table at which Hitler and some high officers sat in conference. The bomb exploded and killed several officers and one male stenographer, but Hitler himself was not fatally hurt, though his right arm was partly paralyzed, his right leg burned and injured, and both eardrums damaged (he was left with impaired hearing).\n\nStauffenberg escaped in a plane to Berlin, convinced that he had killed Hitler. The small circle of conspirators in the capital immediately went into action, but the generals who had promised cooperation still wanted to make sure that Hitler had really been killed. And when they learned that he was alive, they not only refused to cooperate with the plotters, but even helped turn them over to the Gestapo, simply in order to save their own skins.\n\nIt is commonly agreed that the generals could have saved the day, had they declared over the radio that they would stand firm behind the conspirators instead of making hasty declarations of loyalty. A civil war between the army and the SS would certainly have followed, but the army had power enough to make sure of the victory.\n\nThe only direct outcome of the plot was the ruthless execution of hundreds and possibly thousands of German anti-Nazis and the complete subjugation of the army by the SS under Himmler. Even if the plot had been successful, it might not have radically changed the course of events in the next year, for the Goerdeler regime would have offered a negotiated peace to the Allies, who presumably would have refused it. But it is safe to assume that under Goerdeler’s chancellorship no atrocities would have been committed against Jews and foreign workers.\n\n_____________\n\nThus ended the July affair. Despite the participation of Goerdeler, Leuschner, and a few other civilians, it was at bottom a “Militaerputsch” and at the same time an “Adelsputsch”—militarist and aristocratic. It had nothing in common with the mutinies of 1918 in which common soldiers and sailors took the initiative to overthrow the Kaiser, halt the war, and establish a democratic republic. In 1944 it was the aristocratic landowners, who dominated the army, and a few of the same big industrialists who had held the stirrup for Hitler in 1933 because they feared the Communists, who now realized that they had to drop the Fuehrer in order to save their country from utter destruction.\n\nThe sociological background of the plot has not been recognized sufficiently. If the Falkenhausens and Kluges were prepared to support the plot, their motives were anything but progressive. For them, it was only a question of whether Germany was to be run in the future by the “mob” or by the Prussian gentry. They saw in the plot a chance to get rid of the plebeian Hitler and at the same time to turn Germany’s clock back to—say—1750. Schlabrendorff’s list of the 125 main conspirators who lost their lives2 shows that almost half of them were “vons”; 42 were high-ranking officers, including an admiral and several generals. There was also a considerable number of diplomats and statesmen, and quite a few industrialists and gentleman farmers, but the number of professional men and labor leaders was negligible.\n\nAccordingly, Mr. Dulles misjudges the July plotters when he writes at the end of his book: “Upon their example and their ideas the Germans can build, if they choose, the road to democracy.” For very few, if any, of the conspirators were upholders of the ideas and ideals of genuine democracy. The best of them were dreamers of fantastic dreams, the worst were amateur Machiavellis. Perhaps the closest historical parallel is the Fronde, that brave but entirely unaltruistic and un-idealistic plot formed by a union of aristocrats and merchants against the young King Louis XIV and his minister Mazarin.\n\nWhen, in a speech made after the putsch, Robert Ley thundered against the “idiotic nobility,” accusing them of selling out to the enemy, he was not far from the truth. General von Seydlitz and the others who formed the Moscow Committee of Free Germans did so not because they were morally opposed to Hitlerism, and surely not because they were converted to Communism, but simply because they recognized Hitler’s bad leadership; they thought by making peace with Russia to save themselves and their caste and preserve Germany from total defeat. Likewise, Kluge and Falkenhausen listened to Goerdeler and Beck because they were ready to believe that London and Washington were looking for a German Badoglio.\n\nTrue, there were some genuine idealists among the plotters, many of them courageous men who frankly expressed their contempt for Nazism when interrogated by the Nazi Judge Freisler at the Volksgericht. But too many were devoid of all moral principle, willing even to align themselves with such renegade Nazis as the notorious Count Helldorff, police president of Berlin, who was responsible for some of the worst anti-Jewish excesses. And the industrialists connected with the plot felt that, in the face of the inevitable debacle, it would be safer to rely on generals anxious to retain the present social order than upon “Reds”—a term that included not only the Communists but the whole liberal and democratic camp.\n\n_____________\n\nTo help deflate the potential “stab-in-the-back” legend, it should be stated categorically that the plot changed little in the course of military events. The Allies had already broken the German front in Normandy. True, the Nazis lost some very able army commanders as a result of the punishments they inflicted after the plot; among these was Rommel, who was secretly killed by the Gestapo. But Rommel’s equally competent colleague, Kesselring, continued to serve Hitler as efficiently as he would have served Goerdeler. And it was Field Marshal von Rundstedt—a Junker—who on December 15, 1944, the eve of the last Naxi offensive, called on the German soldiers “to give everything and to achieve the superhuman for the Fuehrer and the Fatherland.”\n\nIndeed, the failure of the plot only served to confirm the fact that the German army had ceased to exist as anything but a tool of Hitler, and that the characters of most of the German officers had deteriorated to such an extent as to permit them to accept the role of Hitler’s puppets. “The longer the war lasts, the lower my opinion of the generals,” Ulrich von Hassell remarks in his diaries. “These men have technical knowledge and they are courageous physically; but they have no civil courage. They lack the self-assurance and the universal views that come from real culture. Almost to a man they bow before Hitler. The gifts they receive and the field marshal’s baton are more important to them than all moral values. All upon whom we placed hopes fail us, and they fail in the most miserable way.”\n\nIn Berlin Underground, a recent book about some less-advertised aspects of the anti-Nazi struggle within the Reich (New York, Henry Holt, 1947), Ruth Andreas-Friedrich quotes a German officer: “For six years we labored to remove the Fuehrer, for six years we devised one plan after another. It was supposed to be done back in 1938, at Munich. But the generals were against it. Actually the generals were always against it, no matter how much they pretended otherwise. Halder held back, and Kluge held back. For six years they talked, and did nothing. ‘I’ll set the time,’ Halder said, and waited until they chucked him out. ‘I’m in command; it’s your business to obey,’ said Kluge. It’s the generals’ fault. The generals were quite simply too stupid.”\n\nThere was a time when German generals defied their own government’s orders because they considered them harmful to their country: in 1812 the Prussian General Yorck von Wartenburg—an ancestor of the conspirator Peter Yorck—concluded a separate peace with the Russians against the command of his own king, thus saving Prussia and contributing to the downfall of Napoleon. But in 1934 the Reichswehr did nothing to avenge the murdered General Schleicher. Nor did it raise a hand to support General Werner von Fritsch, ousted from his post on a trumped-up charge of homosexuality; and Fritsch could do nothing but seek death on a Polish battlefield in 1939.\n\nHence the July plot was, in a sense, the last feeble attempt of what was left of Frederick the Great’s Prussian army to act as an independent political force. If November 1918 marks the downfall of the Hohenzollerns and May 1945 the collapse of Nazism, then July 1944 is the date on which the Prussian army made its final exit from history, bankrupt in morale as well as morality. It was Hitler who destroyed that army by evoking its worst and slaughtering its best—when that best showed itself lacking in powers of decision and political sense. Last winter, when the Allied Control Council approved a law formally dissolving the State of Prussia and thus eliminating her as the central German force, it merely put the seal on a development that had begun as early as 1933.\n\nAlready in 1941, when Hitler’s General Reinecke, Chief of the Prisoner of War Department of the High Command, issued instructions that all Russian prisoners of war who happened to be Jews or members of the Communist party were to be shot, the lone voice of protest was raised by a navy man, Admiral Canaris. The generals remained silent. Canaris, in a memorandum to Field Marshal Keitel, declared that it was “contrary to military tradition to kill or injure helpless people.” Keitel dismissed his protest with a sneer at the “concept of chivalrous warfare.” The same Keitel, questioned at the Nuremberg trials, declared that he did not care whether a war was aggressive or non-aggressive, just or unjust—as a soldier, he blindly carried out Hitler’s orders.\n\n_____________\n\nWith the demise of the Prussian army, the German situation is now rather different from what it was in 1919, when the German High Command managed to survive the debacle practically intact and went on almost without interruption to regain control of the nation. This time, apparently, there is a golden chance for the anti-Nazi civilians to fill in the vacuum left by the Junkers and establish, once and for all, a non-militaristic, non-aggressive, non-imperialist Fourth Reich. Although Mr. Dulles’ book might give the impression that the anti-Nazi movement inside Germany was limited to military men and a few professionals and landowners, there were, after all, the quiet but active anti-Nazis outside the army. It is these who might lead a new and better Germany.\n\nTo counteract the effect of Mr. Dulles’ book, one should read the above-mentioned Berlin Underground. There one discovers that ordinary people, too, defied the Nazi regime inside the Reich. Some limited themselves to helping Jews; bolder ones formed anti-Nazi cells, printed and distributed anti-Nazi leaflets, and engaged in sabotage. True, the German civilian resistance could not boast of such striking achievements as those of the partisans in Yugoslavia, the maquis in France, or the fighters of the Warsaw ghetto, but it should not be forgotten. Unfortunately, the Allied authorities seem to have less use for these brave and reliable people, and for the survivors of the concentration camps, than for those more glamorous “non-political” figures who once betrayed the Republic to Hitler, and in time of adversity were ready to sell the Fuehrer to Goerdeler and Beck, or to the highest bidder.\n\n_____________\n\n1 For example, The German People Versus Hitler, by Heinrich Fraenkel (1940); The Silent War, by Jan B.
