The student, known as J, plays amateur football in Lviv, one of eight host cities\n\nfor the tournament which starts next Friday. He said spectators sometimes come armed with\n\nbananas even when the game is for fun and played in front of a crowd of a few dozen. \"It has\n\nhappened to me – the monkey chants, racist comments and the fruit. I try to ignore it or turn it\n\ninto a joke by eating the fruit.\"\n\nBlack and Asian students in the city told the Guardian that racism here is rarely challenged and\n\nracist violence lies just below the surface. There are random beatings, pepper spray muggings and\n\na liberal dose of insults – as well as an unsympathetic response from the police.\n\nThe students leave their campus for home before dark, seldom go into the city centre unless in a\n\ngroup and stay away from gangs of men.\n\nNo-one supports them from Ukraine's authorities, J said. \"It is difficult to stop racism here because\n\nthe police are corrupt, the authorities don't want to know. We try to be invisible.\"\n\nThe biggest sporting event in Eastern Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall appears to be in crisis\n\nover reports of racism within the host countries of Ukraine and Poland.\n\nIn Lviv, allegations that the authorities have allowed racism to fester have prompted incredulity\n\nand soul-searching among councillors and government officials.\n\nFew in the city believe that the tournament will experience high profile racist incidents – each\n\nmatch will be heavily policed and monitored while many hardcore hooligans show little interest\n\naway from club football.\n\nThe authorities admit, though, that they have previously given little thought to the concept of\n\nracism until prompted to do so by intense media scrutiny.\n\nA BBC Panorama programme on Monday broadcast brutal footage of \"fans\" on the terraces of\n\nUkrainian and Polish club teams involved in criminal, racist acts. Hooligans were filmed attacking\n\nnon-white fans as police stood by; others unfurled giant anti-Semitic banners; some fans including\n\nthose of the local team Karpaty Lviv whooped monkey noises at black players while others\n\nappeared to give Nazi salutes during matches.\n\nBefore Campbell's comments, the families of two of England's black players Theo Walcott and Alex\n\nEuro 2012: Ukraine's festering football racism https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/01/euro-2012-ukraine-f...\n\nСтр. 1 из 3 25.02.2023, 13:11\n\nAnnex 217\n\nOxlade-Chamberlain said they would probably not attend the 16-team tournament, fearing abuseor violence in Ukraine, where England will play their first three matches.Ukraine's president Viktor Yanukovych on Friday was forced to release a statement defending thetournament and saying there would be no racism from the terraces.J, a second year student, was one of five minority ethnic students who spoke to the Guardiananonymously, for fear of reprisals. Each, while quick to praise most Ukrainians as well meaningand polite, had personal stories of unreconstructed racism that have had a long-lasting effect ontheir lives.One football lover went to watch local team Karpaty Lviv play Seville in the Europa League inOctober 2010. He was forced to run from the ground after a black player scored and he wasthreatened by fellow Karpaty supporters.Another had a cigarette flicked into his eye as he walked to McDonalds in the city centre. He foughtback and was beaten to the ground by a gang of five men.Last year, two men, an Indian and a Moroccan, were assaulted with pepper spray before beingbeaten up outside their accommodation.J, his friends and a growing influx of non-white workers know they have a tough task to changeattitudes in this beautifully preserved city, known as \"little Paris'' because of its curved, cobbledstreets and baroque architecture.The city's ruling party, Svoboda, whose slogan is \"one race, one nation, one fatherland\", has beenvariously described as fascist, neo-Nazi and extreme. Members prefer to say they are nationalistsand friends of Marine Le Pen's Front National.Andriy Khomytskyy, 29, a Svoboda councillor in Lviv, said that there are no issues of race toconfront within the city because there are so few foreigners.\"There is no problem here, not like other Ukrainian cities. In Kerch [in eastern Ukraine] they havea problem because of illegal Chinese and Koreans.Khomytskyy, a one-time regular on the terraces of Kapaty Lviv, is now a lead member of thecouncil's economic and foreign affairs committee.Perhaps unsurprisingly, he remains resistant to confronting racism either on the terraces or on thestreets where students have been beaten. He said of the fans at Kapaty: \"They are patriotic, notracist.\" Of the apparent Nazi salutes filmed by Panorama, he said: \"It [the salute] is not from theNazis, it is from the Roman empire.\"A father of one who teaches at a college, Khomytskyy said he bears no ill will towards people forthe colour of their skin. When told of how black students said they feared for their safety, heshrugged and said that racist incidents are difficult to prove: \"It is nuanced. It is difficult to say if itis racism if a black man is attacked. Often, it is just banditism.\"Euro 2012: Ukraine's festering football racismhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/01/euro-2012-ukraine-f...Стр. 2 из 325.02.2023, 13:11\n\nAnnex 217\n\nKhomytskyy said that the best way to limit racist incidents is to limit immigration and ensure thatthe resident culture prevails, adding that he has spoken at length about race \"problems\" with hisassociates in the Front National.\"They tell me that they cannot go to certain [Arab] areas in France because you would get beatenand they might take your white girl,\" he said.The profile of Svoboda, which now has more than 50 councillors in Lviv, has risen as the Orangerevolution and its peaceful protests failed amid recriminations and allegations of corruption. Thereis a groundswell of anti-semitism, which campaigners said could be seen on walls around thefootball ground before a pre-tournament clean up. Some commentators have claimed that the righthere have successfully linked anti-semitism and anti-communism.For the more thoughtful members of the city council's administration, the allegations of casualracism in the media and on the terraces are an embarrassment which they are now trying toconfront. Citizens who have volunteered to help fans during the championship have been givenrace relations training.Oleh Berezuk, who is head of the mayor's office, said that the city and the country were trying todevelop strategies to educate local people and allay the fears of immigrants.\"Lack of knowledge presents a problem for us. One has to remember our history – the Nazis killedor deported most of the Jewish population in the 1940s and we were under Russia and the SovietUnion until 1991. These issues are relatively new for us,\" he said.Some have swung towards the extreme right because of a belief that the left let them down duringthe Soviet era, he claimed. Ukraine has not had the benefit of experiencing what it is like to adaptto a generation of immigrants in the same way as Britain and France.\"The brutality of the Soviets was something that we were told about by our parents andgrandparents. We still feel it, in the same way that people in the west still feel the lessons aboutrace. We need some time and understanding as we learn,\" he said.One experienced anti-fascist campaigner believes cities such as Lviv are taking their first steps intothe tricky area of race relations and are having to do so in public. Rafal Pankowski, of the Warsaw-based Never Again Association and co-ordinator of the anti-racist programme for Euro 2012, saidit should be remembered that this is the first major football event to be held in eastern Europe inthe modern era.\"These countries are beginning to talk about these issues . We have started a dialogue. We havealready achieved something before the tournament has started,\" he said.Euro 2012: Ukraine's festering football racismhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/01/euro-2012-ukraine-f...Стр. 3 из 325.02.2023, 13:11\n\nAnnex 218\n\nLenta.ru, Kyrym Khanlygy: Crimea Remembers Its Local Statehood (12 January 2012)\n\n(translation)\n\nAnnex 218\n\nTranslation\n\nLenta.ru, Kyrym Khanlygy: Crimea Remembers Its Local Statehood (12 January 2012),\n\navailable at: https://lenta.ru/articles/2012/01/12/crimea/.\n\nKyrym Khanlygy: Crimea Remembers Its Local Statehood\n\nJust before the New Year, the press service of the Crimean Tatar Mejlis issued a statement\n\nwhich, in addition to the traditional congratulations to compatriots on the upcoming holiday,\n\ncalled on all Tatars to continue the struggle for “the restoration of statehood in our land”. While\n\nsome fringe elements called for the revival of the “Kyrym Khanlygy” (Crimean Khanate) even\n\nbefore, this year will see elections of the Kurultai and the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People\n\nthe behaviour of whose leadership has long been subjected to sharp criticism from opponents.\n\nAnd it can be assumed that the nationalist and separatist cards will be played in full as part of\n\nthe pre-election struggle.\n\n“The coming 2012 calendar year requires each of us to show even greater dedication and\n\nconcentration of will in the name of the future of the Crimean Tatar people and the restoration\n\nof our statehood in our land for a happy future for all people living in Crimea”, the Mejlis said\n\nin its New Year’s greetings. Summing up the results of the outgoing year, Mustafa Dzhemilev,\n\nthe Mejlis’ permanent speaker, stated one curious figure – according to his information, about\n\n2,500 representatives of the Tatar nationality died and about 4,500 were born on the peninsula\n\nin 2011, that is the birth rate exceeded the death rate by almost twice. No other nationality in\n\nthe former USSR can boast of such an achievement. Currently, about two million people live\n\nin Crimea, with the share of Tatars amounting to 13%, and, given the demographic trends, this\n\nfigure is constantly growing.\n\n“I have grown old and want to give way to the young”, the Chairman of the Crimean Tatar\n\nMejlis said last November in an interview with Kommersant-Ukraine. Mr. Dzhemilev has\n\nalready tried twice to resign as head of the Mejlis in 2007 and 2009, but most of the Kurultai\n\ndelegates did not accept his resignation since the statutory documents did not allow voluntary\n\nresignation from that position. However, this time the leader of the Crimean Tatars found a way\n\nout: “The only way out is not to run for Kurultai delegates as the Chairman is chosen from\n\namong the delegates”.\n\nIn his New Year’s speech, Mr. Dzhemilev, who announced his upcoming retirement from\n\npolitics last autumn, repeatedly mentioned Turkey whose centuries-old patronage over the\n\npeninsula seems to be reviving these days. According to the head of the Mejlis, in the face of\n\nthe weak financial support from Kiev, the Crimean Tatars are increasingly forced to turn to\n\nAnkara for help.\n\nMr. Dzhemilev said the Ukrainian authorities last year cut the funding for “improvements for\n\nour people to a minimum”. In particular, instead of the planned UAH 127 mln (about RUB 500\n\nmln), only UAH 23 mln were allocated from the state budget. For this year, they initially\n\nplanned to allocate UAH 142 mln, but, according to Mr. Dzhemilev, only UAH 25 mln were\n\nincluded in the adopted budget. “This money is not enough to build even half of one general\n\neducation school”, he noted. So, schools instructing in the Crimean Tatar language and the\n\nnational cultural centre will now be built with Turkish money.\n\nBy the way, not only schools. Information surfaced last November that the Turks intend to\n\nAnnex 218\n\ninvest in the Crimea’s holy of holies – its tourism sector. This year, the peninsula will receive a delegation of Turkish investors interested in building hotels and boarding houses of the type well known to everyone who prefers the all-inclusive services. The delegation will arrive as part of the “Go to Crimea” project – a joint programme of the Crimean Ministry of Resorts and Tourism and Turkish Airlines. A presentation of the Crimea was also held last year in four Turkish cities and towns – Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, and Antalya as part of this project. The interest of Turkish businesspeople in Crimea is understandable, just as it is understandable that the local Tatars will only benefit if it will be the Turks with whom the indigenous population is connected by language, faith and customs who will eliminate the monopoly of Russians and Ukrainians in the tourism sector, this “gold mine” of autonomy. Such financial intervention is very welcome when it comes to, albeit purely hypothetically, the “restoration of statehood”. Mustafa Dzhemilev at a rally of his supporters. Photo: qtmm.org But most Ukrainian experts still see nothing dangerous in such statements. In an interview with Novy Region, Rostislav Ishchenko, a political scientist, recalled that the Mejlis had missed no opportunity to make such statements over the past 20 years. He also believes that the Crimean Tatars have no prospects of gaining independence since not only does the Russian-speaking majority having close ties with Russia live in Crimea but the factor of the presence of the Russian Black Sea Fleet also plays. “Therefore, a forceful struggle for independence is impossible, and no one will let them go peacefully”, Mr. Ishchenko concluded. Another political scientist, Vladimir Kornilov, also believes the Mejlis’ statement will unlikely “result in something bigger because the Mejlis has lost significant support from the Crimean Tatar population and is only trying to attract attention with such calls”. Indeed, Mr. Dzhemilev’s joyful statements about the support of the Mejlis by 82% of the Crimean Tatars, a split has been recently observed in the ethnic parliament itself. Last November, those dissatisfied with the leadership of the Mejlis even held a rally in Simferopol, which Mr. Dzhemilev’s supporters hastened to declare a provocation by the Russian special services. They allege Moscow is trying to eliminate the Mejlis, which, according to Nedim Useinov, a political scientist, is “the only trump card of the Ukrainian government in the struggle for Crimea”. However, the opponents of Mr. Dzhemilev and his constant deputy Refat Chubarov continue to insist that the current Mejlis only serves the interests of its Chairman and a narrow circle of his close associates. Dissatisfied people also call for an end to the speculations around the 1944 deportation and the FSB’s current insidious plans in respect of the peninsula.\n\nAnnex 218\n\nAs Ruslan Balbek, a delegate of the Kurultai of the Crimean Tatar People and the head of the public organisation “Generation Crimea” wrote in Ukrayinska Pravda, there is currently a consolidation of all forces oppositional to the leadership of the Mejlis in Crimea. Mr. Balbek also said Mr. Dzhemilev’s key drawbacks include the fact that “Crimean Tatars today are perceived as eternally dissatisfied, constantly demanding something and threatening mass riots”. “It is time for the Mejlis to stop blackmailing the population and authorities with false threats. It is necessary to create legitimate institutions of people’s self-government adapted into the state”, he believes. At the upcoming Sixth Kurultai of Crimean Tatars, 250 delegates of this representative body and then a new composition and a new Chairman of the Mejlis will be elected. The authorities in Kiev have already got used to, and have learned to work with, Mr. Dzhemilev, even in most extreme situations. However, it is no secret that Hizb ut-Tahrir, an organisation that has been banned in many countries all over the world and whose ideas to build an Islamic state (Caliphate) largely echo the pan-Islamist sentiments in Turkey, operates in Crimea almost openly. If the Islamists gain influence in the Crimean Tatar official structures, the situation on the peninsula may change dramatically. No one is talking about Wahhabi gangs on Ai-Petri, but the tension on the Kiev-Simferopol-Moscow line can grow massively.\n\nAnnex 219\n\nTASS, How the Use of the Russian Language Was Restricted in Ukraine (15 July 2021)\n\n(translation)\n\nAnnex 219\n\nTranslation\n\nTASS, How the Use of the Russian Language Was Restricted in Ukraine (15 July 2021),\n\navailable at: https://tass.ru/info/11907705/.\n\nHow the Use of the Russian Language Was Restricted in Ukraine\n\nOn the 16th of July, the Law “On Ensuring the Functioning of the Ukrainian Language as the\n\nState Language” will come into force in Ukraine\n\nTASS-DOSSIER. On the 16th of July, the Law “On Ensuring the Functioning of the Ukrainian\n\nLanguage as the State Language” will come into force in Ukraine. The Law will ukrainise the\n\nfilm industry, require cultural events to be held in the Ukrainian language, and introduce exams\n\nfor proficiency in the state language.\n\nTASS describes how and in what areas the use of the Russian language was restricted in\n\nUkraine.\n\nRepeal of the Language Policy Law\n\nOn 23 February 2014, immediately after the coup d’état took place and the opposition came to\n\npower in Kiev, the Verkhovnaya Rada of Ukraine voted to repeal the Law “On the\n\nFundamentals of the State Language Policy”, which had been in force since 10 August 2012.\n\nThe Law granted the Russian language and those of national minorities the status of regional\n\nones in those areas where they are native to at least 10% of the population. The repeal of the\n\nLaw sparked protests in Eastern Ukraine where the Russian-speaking population predominates.\n\nAs a result, Acting President Alexander Turchynov refused to approve the Rada’s decision. The\n\nLaw “On the Fundamentals of the State Language Policy” had been under consideration by the\n\nConstitutional Court of Ukraine since 2016. On 28 February 2018, the Court found it to be\n\ninconsistent with the Ukrainian Constitution. Following the Court’s verdict, the language issue\n\nhad been actually governed only by Article 10 of the Ukrainian Constitution, which says the\n\nstate language in Ukraine is Ukrainian and guarantees free development, use and protection for\n\nRussian and other languages of national minorities.\n\nIntroduction of Language Quotas for Radio and Television\n\nAnnex 219\n\nOn 16 June 2016, the Ukrainian Parliament adopted amendments to the Law “On Television and Radio Broadcasting” (which entered into force on 8 November 2016) introducing language quotas for radio. TV and radio companies were obliged to make available at least 60% of the daily volume of their broadcasting for news, analytical and entertainment programmes in the state language. The share of songs in Ukrainian was set at no less than 35% of the volume of daily broadcasting for any radio stations or at least 25% for those radio stations playing songs in languages of the European Union to the extent of more than 60% of their daily broadcasting volume. At the same time, songs in the state language were to be played in prime time from 07:00 to 14:00 and from 15:00 to 22:00. On 23 May 2017, upon the initiative of President Pyotr Poroshenko (2014-2019), the Verkhovnaya Rada adopted amendments to the Law “On Television and Radio Broadcasting” requiring that the share of broadcasting in Ukrainian be at least 75% per week for national and regional television channels and radio stations and at least 60% for local ones (during the time intervals from 07:00 to 18:00 and from 18:00 to 22:00). The share of news programmes in Ukrainian was increased to 75%. A fine of 5% of the total amount of the licence fee payable by TV and radio companies was imposed for a breach of that rule. All companies broadcasting in languages of national minorities must make available at least 30% of the volume of their broadcasting for the Ukrainian language. National TV channels were obliged to broadcast foreign-produced films and programmes only in the state language. The only exception was made for those programmes and films created before 1 August 1991, which must be accompanied by Ukrainian subtitles. Ban on Russian in Education On 5 September 2017, the Ukrainian Parliament adopted a new version of the Law “On Education” (which was signed by the President on 25 September 2017 and entered into force on 28 September 2017). It provided for a phased ban on the use of Russian and the languages of other national groups in Ukraine in the educational system. The education process in secondary schools and higher educational institutions should be carried out only in Ukrainian. Since 2018, those classes with instruction in Russian and other languages could only be retained in elementary schools. Beginning from 1 September 2020, those schools instructing in a language other than Ukrainian had to virtually cease to exist. Beginning from 1 September 2023, those schools instructing in languages of national minorities of the EU countries should switch to Ukrainian. The Law caused a negative reaction in Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and other Eastern European countries whose expatriates had communities in Ukraine. In particular, Budapest stated that Hungary would block all international initiatives of Kiev until an agreement on language issues was reached between the Ukrainian authorities and the Hungarians of Transcarpathia. On 27 September 2017, the State Duma of the Russian Federation issued a statement “On the Inadmissibility of Violations of the Fundamental Right of Indigenous Peoples and National Minorities of Ukraine to Study in Their Native Languages”. The Russian parliamentarians pointed out that the new Law fails to meet the principles and rules of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and other international treaties and constitutes an “act of ethnocide” of the Russian people in Ukraine. On 13 March 2020, Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky (elected in 2019) signed the Law “On Complete General Secondary Education”, which came into force on the 18th of March of\n\nAnnex 219\n\nthat year. It provides for a gradual reduction of teaching in the languages of national minorities, including Russian. Those national minorities whose languages are related with Ukrainian as well as those living mainly in the speech environment of their native languages were allowed to study in primary schools in their own languages, provided that that would also study Ukrainian. Beginning from the fifth grade, at least 80% of the study time should be dedicated instruction to the state language. Beginning from 1 September 2020, in accordance with the Law “On Education”, all Russian-language schools in Ukraine switched to instruction in the state language. The opportunity to continue studying in Russian at the primary level of education has only been reserved for those students who went to school before 1 September 2018. Adoption of the Language Law On 25 April 2019, the Verkhovnaya Rada of Ukraine adopted the Law “On Ensuring the Functioning of the Ukrainian Language as the State Language”, which significantly limited the possibility of using Russian and the languages of national minorities in the country. On 15 May 2019, it was signed by Pyotr Poroshenko, whose presidential powers expired in five days. On 16 July 2019, the Law entered into force, with the exception of certain provisions. According to the Law, the only state official language in Ukraine is Ukrainian. Attempts to introduce multilingualism are considered as actions aimed at forcibly changing or overthrowing the constitutional order. In addition, the Law prohibited any distortion of the state language in official texts and documents, including “intentional violation of the requirements of Ukrainian spelling”. According to the requirements imposed by the Law, all governmental officials and employees as well as all people engaged in trade, services, education, medicine, culture, etc. must know and use Ukrainian in performing their duties. The only areas not subject to the Law are religious rites and private communications. The National Commission for Ukrainian Language Standards (established by the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers on 6 November 2019) was charged with determining the level of language proficiency for holding governmental and other offices and positions. All cultural events in Ukraine must be only held in the state language, and theatrical performances in other languages should be accompanied by subtitles in the state language. In addition, Ukrainian is established as the main language for the film industry, printing, and publishing. According to the Law, Ukrainian is mandatory for all media, including online publications. Beginning from mid-July 2024, the share of the state language will have to be at least 90% instead of the current 75% on national channels and at least 80% instead of 60% on regional ones. All programmes in other languages must be dubbed in Ukrainian. Those print media published in national minority languages, including Russian, are required to issue an additional print run in Ukrainian, with the content of all issues required to be completely identical. Ukrainian companies must create a version of their websites and pages on social networks in the state language as a start page. Those persons wishing to obtain Ukrainian citizenship will have to pass an exam in the state language.\n\nAnnex 219\n\nOn 14 July 2021, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine found the Language Law consistent with the Ukrainian Constitution. That decision was made in response to an appeal in June 2019 by a group of Opposition Bloc deputies of the previous Verkhovnaya Rada. Effect of the Language Law The Law is being introduced in stages. The advertisement sector has switched to the state language from 16 January 2020. The scientific and medical sectors (all scientific publications must be issued in Ukrainian or in English and an official language of the European Union) and the transport one (all airport, port, station and stop names must be written in the state language) have done so from 16 July 2020. Businesses of all ownership patterns in the service sector, including online stores, have switched to Ukrainian from 16 January 2021. Services in any other language can now only be provided upon request of customers. Information concerning the services offered may also be duplicated in other languages. A language exam has been introduced from 16 July 2021 for future civil servants and applicants for Ukrainian citizenship. The requirements to hold all cultural events, serve all tourists (except for foreigners) and to print and sell at least 50% of all printed publications in the state language are coming into force. In addition, all movies and serials in foreign languages will have to be shown in the state language in Ukraine. Language quotas for nationwide print media will become effective from 16 January 2022, those for television will be increased from 16 July 2024. Liability for Compliance with the Law Beginning from 16 July 2022, breaches of the Language Law will be punished by fines ranging from 200 to 700 tax-free minimum personal revenues (UAH 3,400 to UAH 11,900). In addition, various penalties will be imposed for “public humiliation or insult to the state language” from 2024. The so-called “Language Ombudsman” (appointed by the government) should monitor the implementation of the Law. On 27 November 2019, Tatyana Monakhova was appointed to hold that office. However, she resigned on 24 April 2020 due to the lack of “proper funding” for her activities. On 8 July 2020, Taras Kremen was appointed the new “Language Ombudsman”.\n\nAnnex 220 Vedomosti, Ukraine Legislatively Bans Screening of Russian Movies Filmed after January 2014 (21 April 2016) (translation)\n\nAnnex 220\n\nTranslation\n\nVedomosti, Ukraine Legislatively Bans Screening of Russian Movies Filmed after January\n\n2014 (21 April 2016), available at:\n\nhttps://www.vedomosti.ru/politics/news/2016/04/21/638562-ukraine-zaprete-rossiiskihfilmov.\n\nUkraine Legislatively Bans Screening of Russian Movies Filmed after\n\nJanuary 2014\n\nUkrainian President Pyotr Poroshenko signed a law banning the screening of Russian movies\n\nfilmed after 1 January 2014, according to the Verkhovnaya Rada’s official website. The bill\n\nwas adopted by the Ukrainian parliament on the 29th of March. The ban concerns “broadcasting\n\nof films made by individuals and legal entities of the aggressor state, which contain no\n\npopularisation or propaganda [of the bodies of the aggressor state and their individual actions]”.\n\nThose films containing such propaganda may not be shown in Ukraine if they had been made\n\nafter 1 August 1991. Non-propaganda films include feature ones as well as TV series,\n\nprogrammes and shows.\n\nAs follows from the explanatory note to the document, “the purpose of the bill is to improve\n\nthe legal mechanism for protecting the national security of Ukraine in the information sphere\n\nby limiting any form of propaganda used by the occupying state in Ukraine”.\n\nIn late 2015, the Ukrainian Ministry of Culture published a list of 83 Russian and world cultural\n\nfigures posing a threat to the national security of the country. It includes directors Karen\n\nShakhnazarov and Pavel Lungin as well as actors Vasily Lanovoy, Valentin Gaft and Oleg\n\nTabakov. The “white list” drawn up by the Ukrainian authorities includes, in particular, Andrei\n\nMakarevich, Liya Akhedzhakova, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and George Clooney.\n\nIn total, the distribution certificates for 431 movies have been cancelled in Ukraine.\n\nAnnex 221\n\nTASS, Ukraine Banned 780 Russian Movies and Series Since 2014 (5 October 2018)\n\n(translation)\n\nAnnex 221\n\nTranslation\n\nTASS, Ukraine Banned 780 Russian Movies and Series Since 2014 (5 October 2018),\n\navailable at: https://tass.ru/kultura/5643645.\n\nUkraine Banned 780 Russian Movies and Series Since 2014\n\nThe Ukrainian State Film Agency said the ban had caused financial losses to Russian\n\nmovie and series producers.\n\nKIEV, 5th of October, TASS. The press service of the Ukrainian State Film Agency (Derzhkino)\n\nannounced on Facebook on Friday that the Agency had banned the demonstration of 780\n\nRussian-made movies and series.\n\n“In general, from August 2014 to the present day, Derzhkino has banned 780 movies and series\n\npopularising or propagandising bodies of the aggressor state and punitive bodies of the USSR,\n\nfeaturing those persons on the list of persons posing a threat to the national security or produced\n\nby the aggressor state after 1 January 2014”, Derzhkino said.\n\nThe Agency added such ban changed the situation in the Ukrainian movie and TV market, “led\n\nto the clearing of the Ukrainian information space from Russian propaganda and contributed to\n\nthe emergence of mass production of domestic content”. In addition, the press service claims\n\nthe ban has caused “significant financial losses to Russian movie and TV series producers”.\n\nSix seasons of the series titled “Matchmakers” and the movie titled “Matchmakers. Life\n\nWithout Makeup” were banned in Ukraine as featuring Russian actor Fyodor Dobronravov who\n\nhas been blacklisted as “posing a threat to the national security of the country”. The list of\n\nbanned movies also includes “The Case of Dead Souls” directed by Pavel Lungin, “To the Real\n\nYou” featuring Dmitry Kharatyan, “Attraction” featuring Valentin Gaft and “Divination by\n\nCandlelight” featuring Vladimir Gostyukhin.\n\nAnother 21 films have been banned based on the findings made by Derzhkino’s Expert\n\nCommission on the Distribution and Demonstration of Movies. These include “Oles Buzina:\n\nLife Out of Time”, “Officers’ Wives”, “A Task of Particular Importance. Operation Typhoon”,\n\n“Still I Love” and others.\n\nTen movies were blacklisted under the law on cinematography, i.e. have been screened for the\n\nfirst time after 1 January 2014. These include “The Exclusion Strip”, “Tankman”, \"Love in the\n\nCity 3” and others.\n\nDerzhkino has revoked the official permit for distributing and screening, and cancelled the\n\nofficial registration of, the television films titled “My Other Children” (directed by\n\nV. Netetsky), “A Call from the Past” (directed by S. Vaskovsky) and “You Can’t Deceive\n\nLove” (directed by A. Zadvorny).\n\nThe screening of the Russian TV titled “The Heart is Not a Stone” as well as the TV films titled\n\n“Still I Love” (Russian production) and “Happy Family Tariff” (Russian-Ukrainian production)\n\nhas also been prohibited in Ukraine.\n\nAnnex 222\n\nTASS, How Russian Was Restricted in Ukraine (1 August 2022)\n\n(translation)\n\nAnnex 222\n\nTranslation\n\nTASS, How Russian Was Restricted in Ukraine (1 August 2022), available at:\n\nhttps://tass.ru/info/15358089.\n\nHow Russian Was Restricted in Ukraine\n\nOn the 1st of August, a ban on the teaching of the Russian language and literature comes into\n\nforce in the Odessa Region.\n\nTASS-DOSSIER. On the 1st of August, a ban on the teaching of the Russian language and\n\nliterature in educational institutions of the Odessa Region will come into force. All Russian\n\nwriters have been removed from the curriculum for the 2022-2023 academic year and will be\n\nreplaced by authors from other countries.\n\nTASS describes how and in what areas the use of the Russian language was restricted in\n\nUkraine.\n\nSituation in 1990s and 2000s\n\nFollowing the declaration of independence of Ukraine, its authorities have set a course to recreate\n\nthe Ukrainian-speaking environment, especially in the central, eastern and southern\n\nregions where the Russian-speaking population historically predominated. The authorities have\n\nimplemented a number of initiatives to switch education, media, etc. to Ukrainian. Those\n\ninitiatives were met with mixed reactions in Ukraine, especially in the traditionally Russianspeaking\n\nregions. A significant part of the population preferred to use Russian, which was not\n\nrecognised as an official language but to which the Constitution guaranteed free development,\n\nuse and protection, as well as to the languages of national minorities.\n\nAfter Viktor Yushchenko came to power in 2005, the situation changed. During his election\n\ncampaign, he promised that if he wins the elections, he will ensure the steadfast observance of\n\nArticle 10 of the Ukrainian Constitution guaranteeing free development and protection of the\n\nRussian language as well as its use on an equal basis with Ukrainian in areas densely populated\n\nby the Russian-speaking people, including in education. In addition, Mr. Yushchenko published\n\nhis draft decree “On the Protection of the Rights of Citizens to Use Russian and Other\n\nLanguages of the National Minorities of Ukraine in the Provision of Public Services”, which\n\nhe undertook to sign immediately after his inauguration. His election promises allowed him to\n\nAnnex 222\n\nenlist the support of Russian organisations in the Crimea as well as in the Odessa, Nikolaev and Kherson Regions. However, after he was elected, none of the measures he promised to take to protect the rights of the Russian-speaking population were implemented. A process of ousting the Russian language from various spheres of governmental and public life has begun in Ukraine. The number of Russian-language schools has been reduced, and legal proceedings have been switched to the state (Ukrainian) language. TV and radio broadcasting quotas (valid until 2012) were set for the state language at 75% in 2006 and at 80% two years. In 2006, the municipal councils of the Kharkov, Donetsk, Lugansk, Nikolaev, Zaporozhye, Kherson and Odessa Regions, the cities of Sevastopol, Dnepropetrovsk, Donetsk, Lugansk, Kryvoy Rog and others passed resolutions giving Russian the status of a regional language. They were guided not only by the Ukrainian Constitution but also by the European Charter for Regional Languages, which was ratified by Ukraine in 2003 and entered into force in 2006. However, their resolutions provoked a protest from the official Kyiv who regarded them as “threatening national security”. Nationalist political forces also opposed them by organising a number of pickets and protests across the country. The prosecutors’ offices challenged those resolutions, so that many of them were eventually cancelled. Law on the Fundamentals of State Language Policy of 2012 In 2012, during the presidency of Viktor Yanukovych, a draft Law “On the Fundamentals of the State Language Policy” was submitted to the Verkhovnaya Rada. It granted Russian the status of a regional language in those areas where it was native to at least 10% of the local population and gave it equal rights on a par with the state Ukrainian language. The bill was opposed by Ukrainian people’s deputies Vadim Kolesnichenko and Sergey Kivalov as well as representatives of human rights organisations representing the Russian, Jewish, Hungarian and Romanian ethnic minorities. The bill caused a wide public outcry. Various events were held in the country by both opponents and supporters of its adoption. In the Rada, its consideration was accompanied by demarches and brawls between deputies and even a resignation of parliamentary speaker Vladimir Lytvyn (which was not accepted). Many governmental, political and public figures opposed it. The authorities of a number of regions stated they would refuse to comply with the new Law should it be adopted. The National Commission for the Protection of Public Morality demanded that President Viktor Yanukovych veto the bill, noting that, among other things, it “generates separatist sentiments”, contradicts the interests of Ukraine’s national security and leads to the displacement of the Ukrainian language from all spheres of public life. Nevertheless, the Law was passed by the Rada and signed by the President on 8 August 2012. As a result, Russian has begun to enjoy protection as a regional language in those areas of Ukraine where the number of its speakers exceeded 10%. According to the All-Ukrainian Census of 2001, 13 of the 27 constituent entities in Ukraine met that criterion, with the highest percentages of all Russian speakers being recorded in Sevastopol (90.6%), the Crimea (77%), the Donetsk Region (74.9%) and the Lugansk Region (68.8%). Repeal of the Language Policy Law\n\nAnnex 222\n\nAfter the coup d’état took place and supporters of European integration came to power in Ukraine on 22 February 2014, the official Kiev began pursuing an active policy of suppressing the rights of the Russian-speaking population. On the 23rd of February, the day after the coup d’état, the Verkhovnaya Rada passed a resolution repealing the Law “On the Fundamentals of the State Language Policy” of 2012. The Council of Europe expressed its regret over this issue, and Astrid Tours, OSCE High Commissioner on National Minorities, said the Rada’s resolution could lead to “a subsequent aggravation” in the country. The repeal of the Law caused violent protests in Eastern Ukraine – in the Crimea, Donbass, Odessa and other regions where the Russian-speaking population predominated. In order to prevent the escalation, Acting President Alexander Turchynov refused to sign the resolution until the Parliament passes a new law on language. However, this has never happened. In 2016, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine initiated proceedings on the proposal of 57 people’s deputies to check if the Law complies with the Constitution. Those proceedings lasted almost two years. On 28 February 2018, the Court declared the Law inconsistent with the Constitution, so it became null and void. In fact, through all the years that the Constitutional Court was conducting proceedings on the language Law, the official Kiev continued its policy of ousting the Russian language from all spheres of political and public life and discriminating against the Russian-speaking population. This policy, which was started under President Pyotr Poroshenko who came to power in 2014, was continued under President Vladimir Zelensky who was elected in 2019. Introduction of Language Quotas for TV and Radio in 2016-2017 On 16 June 2016, the Ukrainian Parliament adopted amendments to the Law “On Television and Radio Broadcasting” (which entered into force on 8 November 2016) introducing language quotas for radio. TV and radio companies were obliged to make available at least 60% of the daily volume of their broadcasting for news, analytical and entertainment programmes in the state language. The share of songs in Ukrainian was set at no less than 35% of the volume of daily broadcasting for any radio stations or at least 25% for those radio stations playing songs in languages of the European Union to the extent of more than 60% of their daily broadcasting volume. At the same time, songs in the state language were to be played in prime time from 07:00 to 14:00 and from 15:00 to 22:00. On 23 May 2017, on the initiative of President Pyotr Poroshenko, the Verkhovnaya Rada adopted amendments to the Law “On Television and Radio Broadcasting” requiring that the share of broadcasting in Ukrainian be at least 75% per week for national and regional television channels and radio stations and at least 60% for local ones (during the time intervals from 07:00 to 18:00 and from 18:00 to 22:00). The share of news programmes in Ukrainian was increased to 75%. A fine of 5% of the total amount of the licence fee payable by TV and radio companies was imposed for a breach of that rule. All companies broadcasting in languages of national minorities must make available at least 30% of the volume of their broadcasting for the Ukrainian language. National TV channels were obliged to broadcast foreign-produced films and programmes only in the state language. The only exception was made for those programmes and films created before 1 August 1991, which must be accompanied by Ukrainian subtitles. In addition, the broadcasting of Russian TV channels and programmes was stopped, the screening of Russian movies and the import of Russian publishing products with “anti-\n\nAnnex 222\n\nUkrainian content” were prohibited in Ukraine. Those artists included on the “List of Persons Posing a Threat to National Security” were also banned. For the other artists from the Russian Federation, a special procedure for touring was established, requiring them to get a permit from the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) as to perform in Ukraine. Ban on Russian in Education On 5 September 2017, the Ukrainian Parliament adopted a restated version of the Law “On Education” (which was signed by the President on 25 September 2017). According to it, since 2018, those classes with instruction in Russian and other languages could only be retained in elementary schools and all students of the fifth and higher grades should be switched to instruction in Ukrainian. Beginning from 2020, the entire education system should be switched to Ukrainian. The Law caused a negative reaction both in Russia and in those Eastern European countries whose expatriates had communities in Ukraine. In particular, Budapest stated that Hungary would block all international initiatives of Kiev until an agreement on language issues was reached between the Ukrainian authorities and the Hungarians of Transcarpathia. On 27 September 2017, the State Duma of the Russian Federation issued a statement “On the Inadmissibility of Violations of the Fundamental Right of Indigenous Peoples and National Minorities of Ukraine to Study in Their Native Languages”. The Russian parliamentarians pointed out that the new Law fails to meet the principles and rules of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and other international treaties and constitutes an “act of ethnocide” of the Russian people in Ukraine. On the 12th of October, the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) adopted a resolution recommending Kiev to revise its Law that was intended to ukrainise the Ukrainian education. As a result, some amendments were made to the Law in 2018: for example, the complete transition of schools instructing in EU languages to Ukrainian was postponed until 2023. In continuation of the new policy in education, the Verkhovnaya Rada on 16 January 2020 adopted the Law “On the Complete General Secondary Education” (which was signed by President Vladimir Zelensky on 13 March 2020), providing for a reduction in teaching in Russian and languages of national minorities beginning from the fifth grade of secondary-school students. The Russian-speaking population was subjected to the most discrimination as at least 80% of their education should now take place in Ukrainian. Those ethnic minorities speaking languages of EU member states were required to get at least 20% of the educational process in Ukrainian, with a gradual increase in that degree to 60% for high-school students. The only exception was made for “indigenous peoples” who were permitted to study in their native languages along with the study of Ukrainian (the Law “On Indigenous Peoples” adopted on 21 July 2021 excluded Russians as well as most other ethnic minorities from the list of indigenous peoples of Ukraine, granting this status only to Crimean Tatars, Karaites and Krymchaks). Since 1 September 2020, Russian-language schools in Ukraine have switched to the state language in accordance with the Law. The opportunity to continue study in Russian is only reserved for those primary-school students who entered school before 1 September 2018. Law on Total Ukrainisation\n\nAnnex 222\n\nOn 25 April 2019, the Verkhovnaya Rada of Ukraine adopted the Law “On Ensuring the Functioning of the Ukrainian Language as the State Language”, which significantly limited the possibility of using Russian and the languages of national minorities in the country. This Law, which caused criticism from both the Russian-speaking population and ethnic minorities, was called the “Law on total Ukrainisation”. It was adopted four days after the presidential elections where Pyotr Poroshenko, who was the main lobbyist for the new Law, conceded victory to Vladimir Zelensky. Before taking the presidential office, Mr. Zelensky promised to conduct a “thorough review” of the Law for compliance with the constitutional rights and interests of all citizens of Ukraine. However, the authorities later concluded that the fundamental provisions of the Law “do not need to be adjusted”. The requirement to switch to Ukrainian applies to all spheres of governmental and public life, with the only exception of religious rites and private communications. The Law established that the only state official language in Ukraine is Ukrainian and obliged the citizens to use it in all spheres of public life. TV channels were required to air at least 90% of their programmes in Ukrainian, applicants for Ukrainian citizenship were obliged to pass a language exam, a ban was imposed on the use of Russian and the languages of national minorities in education, etc. At the same time, any attempts to introduce multilingualism are considered under the new Law as actions aimed at forcibly changing or overthrowing the constitutional order and are strictly punished. Situation in 2022 Following the recognition by the Russian Federation of the independence of the Donetsk and Lugansk People’s Republics and the beginning of the Russian special military operation in Ukraine in February 2022, a new campaign to ban the Russian language in educational and culture began there. On 16 April 2022, Taras Kremen, Commissioner for the Protection of the State Language, proposed to replace the study of the Russian language in Ukrainian schools with other subjects and to revise the foreign literature curriculum that pays much attention to Russian writers. In June, the working group for updating the foreign literature curricula under the Ukrainian Ministry of Education decided to eliminate all literary works by Russian and Soviet authors from Ukrainian schools. The Ukrainian Ministry of Culture and Information Policy has begun developing recommendations to withdraw from libraries those Russian books it considers as propaganda. According to representatives of the Ministry, the publications withdrawn from libraries “will be recycled as wastepaper to print Ukrainian books”. Furthermore, a law prohibiting the import of books and publishing products from Russia was adopted in 2022. The Kiev City Council on 1 July 2022 said it would impose a complete ban on the public use of any books, performances and concerts in Russian as well as and other “Russian-speaking cultural products” in the Ukrainian capital. A similar moratorium was earlier imposed in the Khmelnytskyi Region, and the authorities of Ivano-Frankovsk, Ternopol and Konotop prohibited songs in Russian to be performed and listened to in public places. The local authorities in the Odessa, Nikolaev and Lvov Regions have imposed a complete ban on the study of Russian at schools, and the Kharkov University has closed its Department of Russian Language and Literature.\n\nAnnex 223\n\nMK, Kiev Schools to Abandon Study of Russian (12 August 2022)\n\n(translation)\n\nAnnex 223\n\nTranslation\n\nMK, Kiev Schools to Abandon Study of Russian (12 August 2022), available at:\n\nhttps://www.mk.ru/politics/2022/08/12/v-shkolakh-kieva-reshili-otkazatsya-otizucheniya-\n\nrusskogo-yazyka.html.\n\nKiev Schools to Abandon Study of Russian\n\nBy Natalia Trushina\n\nIn the years 2022 and 2023, Kiev schoolchildren will not study Russian either as a subject or\n\noptionally. This is stated in the response of the Standing Commission on Education, Science,\n\nFamily, Youth and Sports of the Kiev City Council, which was given to the request by the\n\npublic organisation “Youth Club of Jura”. The news was published on Friday, the 12th of\n\nAugust, in the Telegram channel “Politics of the Country”.\n\nAnnex 223\n\nAttached to the publication was a scanned copy of the official response by the Kiev Commission. The policy of gradually ousting the Russian language from education in Ukraine became obvious after the coup d’état in 2014. Since 24 February 2022, when Russia began its special military operation in Ukraine, the government has actually launched a total de-Russification campaign in the country. For example, the Kiev City Council announced on the 1st of July their intention to impose a complete ban on the public use of books, performances and concerts in Russian as well as other “Russian-language cultural products” in the Ukrainian capital. The authorities of the Khmelnytskyi Region did the same thing. And in Ivano-Frankovsk, Ternopol and Konotop, songs in Russian were prohibited to be performed and listened to in public places. Ukrainian local authorities are gradually imposing a complete ban on the teaching of Russian at schools. Such decisions have been made in the Odessa and Nikolaev Regions.

The news was posted on the City Council’s website\n\nin the evening of 10 November 2022. This decision was made by 64 City Council deputies (out\n\nof the 120) at the plenary meeting of the City Council’s Second Session.\n\n“The Russian language will be completely eliminated from the curricula of communal\n\npreschool and general secondary education institutions in the capital”, the press release said.\n\nAnnex 224\n\nAccording to Vadim Vasylchuk, the head of the City Council’s Standing Commission on Education, Science, Family, Youth and Sports, in the context of the conflict with the Russian Federation, it would be inappropriate and incorrect to carry out the educational process and to study the Russian language in preschool and general secondary education institutions. “The leaders of the Russian Federation have repeatedly stated that “Russia is going as far as the Russian language is widespread”. In this regard, the Kiev City Council has made a decision that will help avoid escalation of tension in the society and strengthen the protection of Kiev’s educational space from the hybrid influences by the aggressor state. Language matters, and in times of war, it is a matter of national security”, Mr. Vasylchuk said. Kiev City Council / © Wikimedia Commons He added that the draft decision provides for the implementation of certain organisational and legal steps aimed at switching groups and classes from Russian to the state language. A similar decision was earlier made by the City Council of Nikolaev where a ban on the use of Russian in general secondary education institutions began to operate from 1 September 2022. As noted by Ekaterina Stokolyas, a member of the Nikolaev City Council’s Executive Committee, the measure applies, inter alia, to various electives, courses and junior classes with instruction in Russian and the Russian design of the educational environment. In turn, Alexei Danilov, Secretary of the National Security and Defence Council (NSDC), told reporters that the Russian language should disappear from Ukraine “as an element of hostile\n\nAnnex 224\n\npropaganda and brainwashing for our population”. According to him, only Ukrainian and English should be mandatory in Ukraine. Sergey Aksyonov, the head of the Crimea, commented on his words. “It is not the Russian language that will disappear, but Ukraine, which is led by such characters. Danilov is a clear example of what a former Russian man who has sold his dignity and the memory of his ancestors for a rotten Banderite pottage can turn into”, Mr. Aksyonov wrote in his Telegram channel. Struggle with Russian Recall that the consistent eradication of the Russian language in Ukraine began immediately after the coup d’état in 2014. One of the first decisions made by the Verkhovnaya Rada after the “Maidan” was the abolition of the Law “On the Foundations of the State Language Policy”, which had been in force since 2012. That Law endowed the languages of national minorities, which Russian was also attributed to, with the status of regional ones. An attempt to repeal this law provoked mass protests in the eastern regions of Ukraine. The harsh reaction by the society forced the Ukrainian authorities to leave the Law in force, but not for long: in 2018, the Ukrainian Constitutional Court found it inconsistent with the Constitution. “Euromaidan” / АР / © Sergei Chuzavkov In parallel with this, the Ukrainian language began to be artificially implanted in Ukraine. In 2017, Pyotr Poroshenko, who then held the office of the President of Ukraine, signed the Law\n\nAnnex 224\n\n“On Education”, which marked the beginning of drastic changes in the national educational system. One of its key provisions was the restriction of the use of minority languages at schools. Then this Law was clarified by the Law “On Complete General Secondary Education” adopted under President Vladimir Zelensky, which divided the languages of national minorities into three categories, implying a different amount of use in the educational process. Russian was assigned to the third category, which assigned the minimum amount of teaching hours to the languages of national minorities. In particular, at least 80% of the teaching time was to be dedicated to studies in Ukrainian beginning from the fifth grade. In addition, it was under Zelensky when the phased implementation of the Law “On Ensuring the Functioning of the Ukrainian Language as the State Language” began, which was signed by President Poroshenko before his resignation. According to that Law, only the Ukrainian language must be used in the public sphere, including culture and education. Advertising, transport, science, medicine, and services were all consistently switched to Ukrainian. At the same time, penalties were imposed for breach of the Law. The new rules led to numerous conflicts with employees of various organisations accustomed to using the Russian language refusing to serve customers in Ukrainian. In July 2021, President Zelensky signed a scandalous law that did not include Russians among the indigenous peoples of Ukraine despite the fact that, as analysts note, Ukraine had remained largely a Russian-speaking country throughout its existence. “Ukraine Is a Nazi State” According to Vladimir Olenchenko, a senior researcher at the Centre for European Studies of the Institute of World Economy and International Relations under the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Kiev City Council’s decision runs counter to the needs of the population and “is aimed at strengthening discrimination against Russian-speaking citizens who, according to some estimates, make up to half of the Ukrainian population”. “Russian-speaking people will have to adapt artificially. Most likely, the Russian language will be studied further, but already privately, unofficially”, the analyst suggested in an interview with RT.\n\nAnnex 224\n\nClasses at a Ukrainian school / RIA Novosti In turn, Vladimir Shapovalov, Deputy Director of the Institute of History and Politics of the Moscow State Pedagogical University, recalled that the persecution of the Russian language has a long history in Ukraine. “All this began after the ‘Orange Revolution’ of 2004 and even earlier in some aspects. Zelensky is especially aggressive in the fight against the Russian language, although he promised his voters just the opposite. Such policy, of course, does not fit into any norms of democracy and indicates that Ukraine is a Nazi state that grossly violates the rights of a significant part of its population because the Russian language is native to millions of Ukrainian citizens”, the expert said in an interview with RT. Mr. Shapovalov also drew attention to the fact that international human rights organisations had turned a blind eye to discrimination against Russian-speaking citizens throughout all these years. “Unfortunately, all international human rights organisations depend on the West and participate in the fight against Russia. Therefore, they condone the violation of the rights of citizens of Ukraine”, the analyst said. But Russian-speaking Ukrainians did not protest against such policy because they were intimidated by the repressions from the new authorities after the “Maidan”, Mr. Shapovalov said. “An absolutely repressive government is now operating in Ukraine. For example, the party “Opposition Platform – For Life”, which was considered to represent the interests of the Russian-speaking population of the country, had been consistently among the leaders in recent public opinion polls, but it was banned and one of its leaders was sent to prison in the end.\n\nAnnex 224\n\nMany other politicians have also been repressed or even killed and TV channels shut down. In Ukraine, the spirit of intimidation and terror reigns, so there is no resistance”, Mr. Shapovalov said. According to Vladimir Olenchenko, the Russophobic policy of the Ukrainian authorities “once again proves that the Crimea and Donbass made the right choice in 2014”. “The population of those regions does not accept the imposition of the Ukrainian language, nor will it accept it. The Russian language was used there historically, it was not introduced from the outside. It was, is and will be spoken there”, the analyst concluded.\n\nAnnex 225 TASS, Ukraine Imposes Fines for Breach of State Language Law (16 July 2022) (translation)\n\nAnnex 225\n\nTranslation\n\nTASS, Ukraine Imposes Fines for Breach of State Language Law (16 July 2022),\n\navailable at: https://tass.ru/mezhdunarodnaya-panorama/15232059.\n\nUkraine Imposes Fines for Breach of State Language Law\n\nA failure to comply with the law will entail a fine of up to UAH 8,500 (about $300), which will\n\nbe increased for repeated breaches.\n\nKIEV, 16th of July, TASS. The next stage of the implementation of the Law “On Ensuring the\n\nFunctioning of the Ukrainian Language as the State Language” will come into force in Ukraine\n\non Saturday. From now on, a failure to comply with the Law will entail a fine of up to UAH\n\n8,500 (about $300), which will be increased in the event of repeated breaches.\n\nAccording to the new Law, which was adopted in April 2019 and introduced in stages,\n\nUkrainian citizens should use the Ukrainian language in all spheres of public life. Currently,\n\npublic administration, science, education, medicine, services, advertising, print media and\n\nInternet websites must completely switch to Ukrainian. All cultural events must only be held in\n\nthe state language. A 75% quota for programmes in Ukrainian is set for TV channels. Foreign\n\nmovies and TV series can only be showed in the state language.\n\nThe imposition of language fines, according to experts, will primarily affect the service sector\n\nas it is in the communications of sellers, waiters and hairdressers with customers that most\n\nviolations will occur. The Law will be monitored by the Commissioner for the Protection of the\n\nState Language and language inspectors. Taras Kremen, Ukrainian Language Ombudsman, has\n\nalready advised Ukrainians to send denunciations to his office should they reveal any breach of\n\nthe Law, attaching a video or audio record of the incident. Language inspectors can also attend\n\nmeetings in any government bodies, demand documents from any public organisations and\n\npolitical parties, and charge fines.\n\nTaras Kremen recently accused Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky and several other\n\nofficials of breaching the language Law. Mr. Zelensky, who has already been reproached for\n\nswitching to Russian in some interviews, spoke English this time.\n\nNew Rules\n\nThe provisions of the Law on the state language are primarily aimed at fighting the right to use\n\nRussian. For example, the requirement for publishers of newspapers and magazines to publish\n\nat least 50% of their circulations in the Ukrainian language does not apply to printed\n\npublications in The Crimean Tatar and other languages of the so-called indigenous peoples of\n\nUkraine (Crimean Tatars, Karaites and Krymchaks) as well as English and other official\n\nlanguages of the EU. The main target of the restrictions is the Russian language, which,\n\naccording to the All-Ukrainian Population Census of 2001, was called native by 29.6% of the\n\nrespondents.\n\nAfter the new Law was adopted, a number of deputies of the Verkhovnaya Rada filed a\n\ncomplaint about discrimination against the Russian language with the Ukrainian Constitutional\n\nCourt. However, the Court found the Law to be constitutional.\n\nAnnex 225\n\nBan on the Russian Language in Education After the 2014 events in Ukraine, the government took a course to gradually reduce the use of the Russian language in education. The new version of the Law “On Education”, which was adopted in September 2017, provided for a switch to Ukrainian from 2018 for secondary schools and universities, from 2020 for primary schools and from 2023 for schools instructing in the languages of national minorities of the EU countries. After the Law caused a negative reaction in Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and other Eastern European nations having their expat communities in Ukraine, the Law “On Complete General Secondary Education” was adopted in March 2020, which allowed national minorities living mainly in the speech environment of their native languages to study in their own language at primary school, but along with the study of Ukrainian. At least 80% of their teaching time must be devoted to the state language beginning from the fifth grade. De-Russification Campaign In accordance with the new Law, the last stage of its implementation should be the year 2024. Beginning from 16 July 2024, the share of the Ukrainian language on national TV channels should be at least 90%, all regional newspapers and magazines will have to completely switch to the state language, and the punishment for “public humiliation or insult to the state language” will be toughened. However, long before the year 2024, a campaign of total de-Russification has seized the country since the beginning of the Russian special military operation in Ukraine. On the 1st of July, the Kiev City Council announced their intention to introduce a complete ban on the public use of books, performances and concerts in Russian and other “Russian-speaking cultural products” in Kiev. A similar moratorium was earlier imposed in the Khmelnytskyi Region, and songs in Russian were prohibited from being performed and listened to in public places in Ivano-Frankovsk, Ternopol and Konotop. Local authorities impose a complete ban on the teaching of the Russian language at schools. Such decision was made in the Odessa and Nikolaev Regions, and the Kharkov University closed its Department of Russian Language and Literature. The Mayor of the traditionally Russian-speaking town of Kryvoy Rog also said the Russian language should be abandoned.\n\nAnnex 226 DW, Ukraine bans music, books from Russia, Belarus (29 June 2022)\n\nAnnex 226\n\nCULTURE | UKRAINE\n\nUkraine bans music, books from Russia, Belarus\n\nDaria Nynko | Alexander Savitsky\n\n06/29/2022\n\nAs war rages, Ukraine's parliament is defending itself against the invaders with new laws banning Russian music\n\nand literature.
