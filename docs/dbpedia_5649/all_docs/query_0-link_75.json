        "text": "This is not a narrative history of the Ulm and Austerlitz campaign of 1805. There are many of these available. This is the superbly illustrated reference book you will keep alongside any other history and refer to time and time again. In this one volume you will find 360 uniforms, 260 uniform schema and details, 55 flags, 58 orders of battle, 31 maps and 85 tables. In all there are over 700 illustrations. My dear friend Stephen Summerfield and I meet up only on infrequent occasions where we have the chance to chat together and plot the sort of books we love and want to publish. Last August (2023), in the middle of a large and open field, whilst walking my dog “Mopsa” (who shows little interest in military history and would rather we write about sticks and rabbits), I suggested a way of developing what we had achieved with our books on Hanau 1813, Friedland 1807 and most particularly the Russia 1812 campaign studies based upon orders of battle and uniforms leaving the campaign narrative to other books. He was unusually left speechless for some minutes and you could see the cogs turning. Finally, he replied, “Brilliant, simple and elegant idea.” Then for rest of the walk described the content of the books I had proposed in detail. I had rarely seen him so animated about a project. In his usual way, Stephen took my inarticulate attempts to describe a style and content and turned them into pure magic. This is the result, much more than a simple book, more a compendium of all the useful information you would like in one place to study what was according to David Chandler, “Napoleon’s finest campaign and battle.” Here, within these pages, are exhaustive orders of battle from August to December 1805, the composition of corps and divisions and how units evolved from their Revolutionary formations, essential details of the working structure of Napoleon’s army, how and where they marched towards their famous victory, maps galore, and of course their flags, eagles and their uniforms. When I say uniforms, I do not just mean the obvious infantry and cavalry, but where else are you likely to find such as the Gendarmes, Invalids, the Chasseurs d’Orient, the Regt. de la Tour d’Auvergne, Italians, German States (Baden, Bavaria and Württemberg) and so many others. This is a book not to put on the book shelves but to keep handy, where you can refer to it time and time again. You may be simply studying the campaign, or you may be planning your own campaign game or raising your own model army. Whatever you interest, we sincerely believe that within these pages lies so much of what you need to know and understand.\n\nThis paper focuses on the life and military activity of the Imperial-Royal Lieutenant General Baron Joseph Meskó de Felsőkubin. The paper is mainly based on archive resources, partly on documents of the Austrian State Archives, partly on Meskó’s handwritten memoir written in German, which has never been worked up before. Meskó was born in 1762 in an old hungarian noble family, and he had been one of the most outstanding Hussar officers in the history of the Austrian Imperial army. He served well not just as a troop officer, but excelled in higher commanding ranks, too. Meskó covered himself with glory several times during the French Wars. For example, on April 30th 1792 Meskó while fighting in the vanguard of the Imperial-Royal Army at Quiévrain (today in Belgium) reached the French rearguard and captured 11 cannon and more than 1000 men. The booty included reasonable amount of supply food. On April 6th 1799, on the second day of the Magnano victory, serving as a second major in the 7th Hussar regiment he defeated the enemy’s rearguard at Isola della Scala. Furthermore, he captured their hospital and its resources and a wounded French general. On May 17th 1799 Meskó forced the garrison of Casale Monferrato in Piedmont to surrender and he occupied the town and the citadel. In April 1800 he captured the French positions with a commando. The French positions were at 2000 metres high in the Alps at the Mont Cénis. Owing to his valour Meskó was awarded with the Knight’s Cross of Military Order of Maria Theresa in 1801. In 1809 after the battle of Győr Meskó fought his way out of the French encirclement with his division. After that, while completing a long march and fighting continuous advance- and rearguard actions, he defeated all his attackers. For this he received later on the Commander’s Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa. The closing of the general’s active career was in the battle of Dresden in 1813 when he was captured with some imperial-royal troops. I describe the exact circumstances of this event which was very famous of that age and later on as well. In my opinion the prisoner-taking was not really Meskó’s fault, but was caused rather by the unexperienced high command, by the unfortunate course of events and by the cumbersome maneuverability of the huge army."
