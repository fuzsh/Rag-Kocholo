        "text": "[thread=213412]Link to discussion[/thread]\n\nNovember 8th, 1939, 1930h Munich Airport, Runway\n\nFocke-Wulf FW-200 sat on the airport runway quietly. Inside Hans Bauer said to his copilot. \"According to the report of the ground control, this damn fog will be lifting in 45 minutes. Night should be clear enough for take-off by 2200.\" \"Ja, herr Standartenfuehrer.\" said the copilot. Picking up the radio microphone he said \"I'll notify herr Weber, the head of security detail.\"\n\n2000h, Bürgerbräukeller, Munich\n\nChristian Weber listened to the man that approached him intently. Afterwards, he approached Adolf Hitler, who was preparing to start his speech for annual Beer Hall Putsch anniversary. After hearing what Weber whispered to him, Hitler replied \"Ach, sehr gut. Prepare to leave this place in 2130.\"\n\n2035h, Konstanz, Germany-Switzerland border crossing\n\nThomas Gruener, Reich Customs official, accompanied by an ominous looking Gestapo man, moved around the train, checking papers of passengers on regular Munich-Bern line. Entering the compartment he said „Aussweiss!“. People immediately produced their papers, while one, Johann Georg Elser as it turned out, fumbled around with a bunch of papers. Finally, he produced his ausweiss and handed it to Thomas. His nervousness caught attention of the Gestapo officer who took his passport from Thomas. Instantly he declared \"Your papers are not in order! Please follow me!\". Thomas stepped aside, careful not to interfere. Gestapo man roughly took Johann by the hand and guided him outside of train, where he was joined by two other officers. Thomas didn't want to know what was going to happen to the man. He heard some stories about \"interrogation\" methods of men in gray overcoats, and didn't want to get more intimate with them.\n\n2119h, Bürgerbräukeller\n\nClock was inexorably ticking on the detonator of the bomb, set beneath the speaker stand of the Hall. Only 60 seconds were left till the mechanism activated detonation cap. On the speaker stand the Fuehrer of Nazi Germany, mighty Third Reich was concluding his speech on decadence and impending fall of Allied power, which held Germany enslaved for 20 years.\n\n2120h At the moment when Hitler bellowed \"NO MORE! I will ANNIHILATE them!\" and Alte Kaempfer jumped to their feet, shouting \"Heil Hitler!\" in ecstasy, loud explosion obliterated speaker stand. Roof of the hall caved in, burying everything beneath rubble of concrete, metal and wood construction and roof tiles that was almost shoulder high at shallowest point. Ecstasy of the second earlier was replaced by cries of pain as over 90 people laid wounded and bleeding. Almost immediately 15 members of SS Liebstandarte who were standing outside rushed in the hall. They were shocked by the sight, but, oblivious to the cries of wounded men, started digging the rubble with their bare hands, hoping against hope to save the dictator they were sworn to protect with their lives.\n\n2145h It took almost half an hour for the first teams of Feurwehr and Ambulanz to arrive to the scene. Place was already crawling with members of half a dozen security services, although SS men were clearly in charge. Fifteen Liebstandarte officers were sitting on the sidewalk, visibly subdued, while what looked like a senior officer of the SS, wearing Algemeine SS insignia and rank of Brigadefuehrer SS swore at them savagely.\n\n2200h Feurwehr officers dig out first bodies buried in the general area where speaker stand used to be. They are immediately surrounded by SS men and suggested to get some rest. A minute later four SS officers were seen taking out a body of man. His grey uniform was in tatters, and what probably used to be an overcoat, was a bloody mess of textile hanging off the stretchers. They put the stretcher in the black van, waiting outside, which promptly vanished at great speed. Most of the SS officers dispersed in the surrounding streets. They started frisking every bystander and arresting anyone even slightly suspicious. As most people tried to get out of the way, and made run for their homes this resulted in hundreds arrest. 15 members of SS Liebstandarte who were in front of the Hall, were picked up in the bus and driven away. Nobody knew what happened to them, although some sources claimed that they were given personal weapons and left in their cells.\n\n2205h Berlin, Prinz-Albrecht-strasse, SS HQ\n\n\"You must confirm this! Right now! I don't care if you have to run to Munich!\" shouted Himmler, whose face was red with anger to the young Hauptsturmfuehrer who brought the teleprinter report. He saluted, shouted sharp \"Jawohl, Herr Reichsfuehrer!\" and turned on his hills and left. After the doors closed, Haydrich, sitting opposite to Himmler, with woried look on his face said \"Herr Reichsfuehrer, you understand what this means?\". Equally worried Himler replied \"Ja, mein Reinhard! The fat, bungling fool will have his five minutes! If only Hess was kept as a heir-apparent!! But even Fuehrer realized that Hess was loony. Anyway, we must follow publicly expressed will of the Fuehrer for now. Send your men to bring the idiot from his hunters lodge\". \"Jawohl, Herr Reichfuehrer! I will personally take care of that. I just wish I could get my hands on the swine that did it. He would wish that Mueller got to him first.\" At that moment Hauptsturmfuehrer appeared again. He omitted the usual Hitler salute, instead only rising his right hand. \"Herr Reichsfuehrer! It is confirmed! Der Fuehrer ist Tot!\"\n\n2300h Zossen, OKH\n\nPhone rang in the conference room, where Brauchistch, Halder, Jodl, Keitel, von Rundstedt, von Bock and von Leeb were just going through the proposed plan to attack France by the way of Low Countries. Captain Roehmer answered it. His face paled. \"WAS?\" he shouted as he stood up holding the receiver so tightly that his knuckles went white. Everyone in the room turned toward him. Senior officers looked at each other fear visible on every face. They knew that this war was gamble and that French army could still roll over slight opposition forces on so called \"Sigfried line\" could offer. Most divisions were still transiting from Poland to the west using rail and highways. They were triumphant, but tired. Losses were just replenished and new men still haven't gotten the grips and unit cohesion suffered. They all feared French offensive. The bad news that arrived, was however of different nature. Keitel was the first one to hear it. His reaction caused chill to penetrate the room as his face conveyed shock, sadness and fear at the same time. He announced quietly, unable to use his throat in full capacity \"Meine herren, der Fuehrer ist Tot!\" Anybody left standing after his announcement just lost control of their legs and sat down. Many faces of junior officers filled with tears, as the man they recognized a hero, and worshipped for bringing glory and might to their country was suddenly taken from them. \"Halder, this changes everything,\" whispered Brauchistch. General-oberst Brauchistch has only weeks earlier refused to take part in conspiracy which was headed by Halder, Canaris, Witzleben, Hoepner. This exchange was not noted by anyone. Halder just nodded solemnly.\n\n2315 Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, Bendlerblock, Berlin\n\nA figure in the chair behind a large desk sobbed quietly in his hands, wrapped around his face. Paper on his desk that caused this was soaked in tears. \"Why!\" he whined. His hand reached into his drawer and appeared holding a pill between his index finger and thumb. After staring through the window on quiet Berlin night for few minutes, he carefully put it on the table and reached for a telephone receiver. \"Get me Magda\" he whispered. \"I need my wife.\"\n\n2330 Carinhall\n\n\"Herr Goering, wake up\" shouted the young servant, Mathias Gnaedinger. He never dared interupt Feldmarschals sleep, but there were four men from SS in the house. He knew you don't get to say too many noes to these guys. One of them, tall, young and blonde fellow, bearing insignias of SS-Gruupenfuehrer pushed Mathias away and poured water from the glass he picked up from the nightstand directly on Goerings face. Bewildered, Feldmarschall rose up to sitting position,trying to gather his bearings. He was not used to such rude awakening. As he blinked, he saw blurred figure in black uniform and bowing toward him. Instinctively he flinched, his mind racing to recent past, sorting out events to check if something he did could bring his demise in the eyes of the Fuehrer. Nothing he could think of could be so devastating to him that Hitler would decide to rid himself of one of his most faithful lieutenants. \"However, life in Third Reich was cheap. My life might be more expensive than others, but...\" He never finished this line of thought. Bowing figure whispered in his ear \"Der Fuehrer ist Tot!\". This caused Goerings mind to frantically activate. At that moment he recognized Himmlers' hound dog. He shuddered from the shock this announcement brought to his unprepared mind. Goering jumped out of the bed, rushed to the cabinet in the far end of the room and reached for a pill container in the drawer. He popped one of the pills in his mouth, and quickly followed it with brandy from the bottle that stood ready on the cabinet. He was not ready for this. Himmlers' pet read an official announcement from the piece of paper he retrieved from his pocket. As Goering turned around, three SS what-ever-fuehrers stood at attention and bellowed \"Der Fuehrer ist Tot! Heil Fuehrer!\". At that moment Goering fainted.\n\n0200 Downing street 10, London\n\nChambarlain woke to the sound of door to his bedroom opening. His personal secretary was at the door, with police officer from PMs personal security detail at his side. His face conveyed utter confusion and without any preliminaries he said \"Adolf Hitler is dead!\". This woke Prime minister instantly. \"Summon me Leslie, Halifax and...\" he started thinking aloud. After a moment of consideration \"Actually, summon entire War Cabinet for immediate session. Also, confirm this news however you can. Tell Macmillan to sketch comment for BBC. It must confirm our position on the war, no matter what!\"\n\n0200 Paris, Elysee Palace\n\nDaladier looked on the piece of paper in his hand with disbelief. \"He is dead.\" he thought \"So this is why they called me from my house in the middle of the night. What happens now?\". Daladier pressed a button, and his aide d'affairs appeared. \"Summon meeting of the cabinet as soon as they can come. Call Maurice and tell him to be here in half an hour.\"\n\n0200 Moscow, Kremlin\n\nStalin, Molotov, Beria, Zhdanov and Voroshilov sat at the desk. Cups of hot tea were in front of them, and air was full of scent of Stalin’s favorite Georgian tobacco. \"I can't believe that Hitler would allow something like this to happen to him.\" Stalin said, waving his head. Beria just smiled and remarked \"I guess that he wasn't as beloved a Fuehrer as we thought he was.\" \"Comrade Vycheslav, who do you think is going to succeed him?\". \"I am better able to answer this.\" said Beria \"Comrade Chairman, according to my sources, Goering is slated as heir apparent, by the will of Hitler.\" \"Thank you, Comrade Beria\" said Stalin. \"Comrade Vyacheslav, is our agreement with fascists in danger? Could Goering revert Hitler’s policies and attack us?\" \"Comrade Chairman, Goering is reputed to have expressed doubts on war against Soviet Union privately! If he manages to consolidate his power, I believe we can even find common interest with Germany and continue our cooperation!\" \"Comrade Chairman,\" interjected Voroshilov \"We could rely that Goering has distaste of ground war as an air force pilot. He will try to avoid getting into large scale conflict on the ground as much as he can, I believe. Pilots of our VVS shy away from \"ground pounding\" and despise any combat on the ground.\" \"Thank you, Comrade Klimenti\" said Stalin \"We will now inspect the figures of realization of the third Five Year plan.\"\n\n0200 Rome, Il Duce Palace\n\nCiano and Badoglio were summoned from their houses by Il Duce and having arrived in front of Palace, were ushered instantly into the grand room to find only Mussolini sitting there. He greeted them and offered them to sit down. \"Adolf Hitler is dead!\" said Benito, matter of factly. \"The fool got himself killed in one of those foolish anniversary celebrations of his failed emulation of our glorious March on Rome.\" Ciano was the first to respond \"Well that simplifies things for us, doesn't it?\" \"Si, conte. We now have no obligation toward Nazi Germany. We are free to form our own policy.\" answered Mussolini. \"Badoglio, how soon can you prepare mobilize the Army?\" \"What for, sir?\" \"Unforeseen circumstances! What sort of question is that?\"\n\nNovember 9th, 0645 Berlin\n\n\"German citizens, heroic soldiers of the Wehrmacht, sailors of Kriegsmarine, pilots of the Luftwaffe! We interrupt our regular transmission for an grave announcement. Beloved Fuehrer, savior of our Vaterland, was killed by the hand of terrorists, while addressing his most faithful followers in Munich. Every son and daughter of Greater German Reich will weep for the greatest son of Vaterland. Today, every window will fly black flag. For next seven days Mourning will be pronounced throughout the Reich and her allies. All public events, except memorial services to the great Fuehrer, will be canceled. However, even in this sad occasion we must not forget our DUTY! Our obligation! Our debt to the man who delivered us from the dual grips of Bolshevism and Jewry. Every man, woman and young will do their duty. As per wishes of our departed Fuehrer, General Fieldmarshal of the Luftwaffe, Herman Goering, will take over Fuehrer position. Let us all hail this worthy successor, bestowed on us by the will of one and only Fuehrer Adolf Hitler.\" Mozart’s Requiem is played after this announcement.\n\n0800 London, Downing Street 10\n\n9 people sat in their chairs, with sound of paper shuffling the only sound disturbing the silence of the room. \"Gentlemen\" started sir Neville Chamberlain \"I believe you are all familiar with the subject of this meeting. As has been reported by our sources in Germany, during the previous night Chancellor of Germany, Adolf Hitler has been killed. We have gathered here as War Cabinet to discuss further steps in prosecution of the ongoing war against Germany. I have been in contact with mr. Daladier, who is having similar meeting with his cabinet as we speak. He assured me of his adamant position to prosecute the war further, until our commonly agreed objectives have been met. In order to enable us to have more accurate picture, I invite sir Leslie to present current state of military preparation of our country.\" \"Thank you mr. Prime Minister. Gentlemen, I must confess that we cannot be satisfied with the current state of our forces. Since we came to the decision to deploy our forces in France in 1938, progress has been painfully slow. In absence of conscription, we were able to form only skeleton of formation. On 3rd September, we were able to deploy a total of 160000 troops. We expect to reach targeted 316.000 by the spring of 1940. Our Expeditionary forces in France consist of 4 divisions right now, while four are forming up at home, and will be deployed as they become available. We have no problems in supply and entire army is motorized. French have mobilized over five million people. Their army is deployed on the entire Franco-German frontier, behind their formidable Maginot line. Mr. Daladier has assured me that German Army cannot penetrate this line without devastating casualties.” He looked down on the folder in front of him, and turned the page.\n\n“Germans have deployed around 50 divisions on the border front. Without reinforcements they cannot effectively defend their entire front, though they can offer some resistance. Unfortunately, French mobilization process was too slow to allow offensive before adverse weather set in. Current military thinking of French GQ is to receive German attack, blunt it and then start counter-offensive operations. Our home forces consist mostly of regular divisions forming up for deployment in France, reserve forces with 183000 various personnel and around 300.000 newly formed Territorials. We have only one armored division at home, the 1st Armored. They are still getting familiar with their vehicles so we expect it to be ready mid-April. I will now let sir Kingsley present state of air forces to you.\" \"Thank you sir Leslie. Our air forces are the most modern part of our defense. We have almost finished modernization and most RAF fighter squadrons received our new Hurricanes and Spitfire aircrafts. Our...\"\n\nAt that moment, Winston Churchill, already visibly exasperated, said \"That is all very well and fine, but I think we must make a policy decision here. Mr. Prime Minister, my opinion is that death of Hitler doesn't change much in overall situation. He was only an exponent of aggressive German ambitions since previous war.\" \"Winston, please can you for once refrain from interrupting our meetings!\" \"I am sorry sir Hoare\" said Prime Minister \"but sir Winston is right. We must prosecute this war until Europe can brief free of incessant German aggression. This government must insist that Germany release Poland from her grip and allow Czech people the right of self-determination. This government will stand by international law and our commitments. We undertook on March 1939 to defend independence of certain countries in Europe and will not retreat from fight until this independence is assured, or this Island is conquered.\" Everybody in the room felt proud for being British in this moment. It felt the finest hour of Britain.\n\n\"Very well, gentlemen.\" exclaimed sir Hoare \"Let's have a vote of the cabinet on the \"Proclamation of willingness of the His Majesty's Government to prosecute current war until it concludes under terms as presented in the Ultimatum dated 3rd September\" to be presented to the House of Commons. In favor 9, against 0.\" \"Thank you gentlemen. Leslie, Halifax, Churchill and Kingsley, please stay.\"\n\n0900 Zossen\n\nHalder entered his office. He found Brauchitsch and Canaris in the room. In front of the doors two men from Brandenburg regiment took care that they are not disturbed. Halder started \"We gathered here due to the divine intervention. We have been rid of the Fahneneid to the madman. We are now free to act against the extremists. However, nothing we do must endanger Vaterland. We must not allow them to brand us traitors, who betrayed Vaterland due to their blind ambition. Herr Canaris, please continue!\" \"Goering has already contacted me. He asked for information on willingness of Western powers to conclude negotiated peace. My personal estimate of chances for treaty is slim, without serious concessions that nobody in Germany is willing to accept. I am talking of giving up Poland, Czezch and possibly even Austria.\" At these words, Halder and Brauchitsch exchanged glances, which Wilhelm did not notice \"We must act now and take over government if we have any hope of peace treaty.\" Halder retorted \"To accept what? Give up Poland, for which my troops shed their blood? Even if I personally could get over that, no officer in the army will accept it. We would be hung from the poles by our own soldiers.\"\n\nBrauchitsch joined in \"No, no, no! I could never order an Army to abandon the field of battle which they just conquered. We must be safe from the Bolsheviks and to be safe we must hold Poland!\". Canaris frowned at this. \"Franz, Walther you cannot be serious?\" asked Canaris \"We have this opportunity alone. Goering has the ear of almost every industrialist in Germany. If he manages to consolidate his power, I doubt that we will have this opportunity again. Besides, my Fremde Heere West estimates that French could throw up to 100 divisions on us. Our sources claim French have over 3000 tanks, some of them better than what we have. Although the England has not been able to provide serious forces yet, our intelligence suggests they have few divisions of their Expeditionary Army fortifying at Belgian frontier. Military situation is grave, you know it better than me.\" Few minutes of silence passed, as both officers pondered knowns and unknowns. Halder was first to voice his opinion \"Herr Wilhelm, you are right, French are much more powerful than Wehrmacht at the moment. However, campaign season is at least five months away. That gives as time to strengthen our forces. Currently Wehrmacht has around 70 divisions of all categories mobilized and ready, while some 40 are forming up. We managed to beat Poland at about 1:1 ratio. Before our triumph over Poles I wasn't very confident in our own armed forces, but now I believe that we can hold our own in combat. However, any fight will be bloody. Walther, let’s see if we can secure the peace with negotiation.\".\n\nCanaris said \"Very well. Halder, you will try to figure out Goering’s intentions, before we decide what to do next.” “In the meantime we must prepare everything to take over the government, before the extreme elements of Nazi party gather strength.\" concluded Brauchitsch. \"Very well, then. I shall contact the others and revive the pre-Munich plan!\" added Halder.\n\n0908 Prinz-Albrecht-Strasse, Gestapo HQ\n\nHeinrich Mueller was going through the reports of various field offices of Gestapo with accustomed routine. He was sipping his regular morning coffee, cigarette in his hand. What happened the previous night was drawing attention of entire formidable RSHA apparatus. On the streets of Munich officers of various services were practically running into each other. Mueller was expecting his senior staff members to come any minute now. The meeting was scheduled rapidly but efficiently. Mueller was worried that he could not identify any organization or group capable of an act of terrorism that happened in Munich. He was sure that anyone that competent would be unable to escape attention of his agents. He was mildly afraid of reaction of his superior officer Reinhard Heydrich to his lack of information. At that moment, a phone rang. Person on the other side of the line identified himself immediately as head of Munich office. \"Herr Generalleutnant, I have to report that my office has apparently apprehended the person responsible for setting the bomb.\" Mueller promptly asked \"Are you sure? Who is he?\" The voice on the other side responded \"We never heard of him before. He is a no body. Our agent on the border crossing took him off the train before he escaped to Switzerland. He was in our custody since last night.\" Mueller retorted in ominously low voice \"Listen to me herr Oberst... I have serious business at hands and I do not have time for some junior inspector delusions of grandeur. That cannot be the man!\"\n\nNext remark of the Oberst changed the mind of Gestapo chief \"He had in his possession postcards from the beerhall. THE BEERHALL herr General! We located some of the personnel, and a few of them recognized this man, Elser, as regular customer in previous months. Also he has bruised knees, as if he was crawling on them for a long time! And finally, he confessed just a few moments ago, which is why I called you.\" At this, Mueller exploded \"You idiot, why didn't you say so at once. HERR OBERST, YOU AND YOUR SENIOR OFFICERS WILL PERSONALLY ACCOMPANY THIS MAN TO BERLIN. Use the airplane and get the prisoner here right now! Or I will have you patrolling some Polish village for the rest of your life!\"\n\n0930 few floors up in SS HQ\n\n\"Well Heinrich, what have you got?\" asked Heydrich.\n\n\"Herr Gruppenfuehrer, Gestapo agents in Munich identified and apprehended one Johann Georg Elser last night in Konstanz. He was attempting to get across the border with false papers. After investigation and interogation of the suspect, he confessed to have planted the bomb.\" Mueller reported instantly.\n\n\"Sehr gut herr Mueller. Has any progress on identifying his co-conspirators been made yet?\"\n\n\"No, herr Gruppenfuehrer. They are bringing him to Berlin now. I have no doubt he will sing in no time once I hand him over to Hans.\"\n\n\"Please notify Hans to keep him alive.\"\n\n\"Of course, Herr Gruppenfuehrer.\"\n\n\"You can go to your office now! I have urgent business with Reichsfuehrer! Dismissed!\"\n\n\"Jawohl, herr Gruppenfuehrer!\".\n\nAfter Mueller left the office, Heydrich got up and through a side door on his office entered the room that was occupied by Himmler. \"Herr Reichsfuehrer\" he started.\n\n\"Come in Reinhard.\" answered Himmler. Himmler continued instantly \"I was very lucky that the Venlo thing Walther cooked up had me stay here yesterday, instead of going to that stupid celebration. I could have been there with der Fuehrer. Where is Walther anyway? Wasn't he supposed to be here to give me a report on those English spies he duped?\"\n\nHeydrich promptly answered \"Herr Reichsfuehrer, he is coming in two hours. On my orders this affair is terminated, and I sent him to arrest and bring those english spies. We couldn't risk it anymore after last night.\"\n\n\"Good thinking there, Reinhard. Good thinking. I know these spies were amateurs, and their games were foolish. However, if anything leaks out, especially after last night, it could get rather exciting for the two of us.\"\n\n\"Herr Reichsfuehrer we must be sure they didn't get into contact with any other insurgent group inside Reich. As unlikely a prospect as it may be, I must make sure.\"\n\n\"Well, I must go now. Goering has summoned me for a security briefing. He seems to be afraid of shadows right now. Personally report to me the progress of Elsers interrogation. And, Reinhard, from now on file everything on this person in \"Special security file Eller\".\"\n\n\"Jawohl herr Reichfuehrer!\"\n\n1000 Berlin, Reichstag\n\nGoering entered into grand chamber. Instead of his customary Luftwaffe uniform, he was dressed in black suit, swastika on his collar, black ribbon on his arm. He was followed by mean looking SS men of formerly Hitler’s security detail. Entire room has been swept multiple times for explosives. Nobody without written permission, signed by Himmler himself, was allowed within five hundred meters of Reichstag for entire morning. Air was alive with buzzing of airplane engines, as two squadrons of Luftwaffe fighters raced above Reichstag. Entire tank regiment isolated Reichstag square, soldiers manning tank machineguns at ready, ominously scanning environment. As Goering entered the room the men sitting there rose to their feet, right hands extended in Nazi salute. Entire who-is-who of Third Reich was present inside this room. \"Volksgenossen of Third Reich,\" started Goering \"I undertake the responsibility of leadership in these tragic circumstances with no reservations. Although our grieving has not and never will end, I had to organize this ceremony, for danger of leaving the Reich leaderless at time like this was unthinkable. Let no body doubt that persons responsible for the act of terrorism committed yesterday will get their dues and that their terror will be answered with double and triple measure. Entire Reich will curse those names forever. As our only true Fuehrer Adolf Hitler was taken from us, I declare his title singular and unique. I myself will take on title of Reichspraesident, which will be put to vote by entire Volk. Should I earn your trust in free election, I will assume this title for life.\" At that moment Otto Thierack approached. He started \"I, state your name solemnly swear...\" That marked ascension to the power of Herman Goering. Entire ceremony took half an hour. Radio program continued with a broadcast on Hitler’s life and achievements. Only interruptions were five minute reports from the front that were broadcasted every hour.\n\nMeanwhile, in the same building, few offices away, Albert Speer quietly continued his work, sketching monumental mausoleum for his idol, Adolf Hitler. Tears flowing down his cheeks occasionally threatened to ruin his sketches, forcing him to look away and wipe them off.\n\n1200 Broadcasting House, Information office\n\n\"This is Home Service, on the next beep it will be precisely twelve o'clock! This is the News\" said speaker in front of the microphone \"Today, after an announcement that head of German government Adolf Hitler is dead, His Majesty's Government held an immediate War Cabinet Session. Proclamation of willingness of this government to pursue war until terms of Ultimatum issued on September the 3rd this year was unanimously approved and sent to House of Commons. House of Commons accepted the text of proclamation, which was sent to the representatives of German Government by wireless. Text of proclamation goes as follows: Government of The United Kingdom and Great Britain will pursue ongoing war against Germany and her satellites or associated forces further, no matter what internal power structure or head of the German government might be. Our peace terms are unambiguous and not subject to change. We are willing to conclude peace with Germany right now if terms outlined in ultimatum are fully complied with. Mr. Macmillan of Her Majesty Governments also added that United Kingdom and her Allies have no wish to wage war or impose unjust terms, bound to be opposed by majority of German people. Our only wish, according to Mr. Macmillan is that peoples of Europe, including Germans, have equal rights and independence. In other news, similar proclamation was issued by French Government. Situation on the frontline is stable, with only minor skirmishes reported. There were no British casualties reported. These were the news. Continue listening to our programming for up to date news and music.\"\n\n1300 Conference room in Reichskanzlei, Wilhelmstrasse 77, Berlin\n\nMen seated in their chairs placed around the table could, even through the closed doors, hear sharp military steps pounding the granite floors. Double door opened and two soldiers in black uniforms with double lightning insignia stepped in. Although armed only with holstered pistols, they left no doubt to all the present that they could kill anybody in the room should they attempt anything threatening. A second later, Goering stepped in the office. This was his first conference with senior leaders of the Reich in capacity of national leader. In spite of his momentary desire to assume full title of the Fuehrer, he decided after careful consideration not to. If everything went as he planned, he could do it later. First he had to establish sufficient authority and prestige. Besides, such fast grabbing of the coveted title would cause all sorts of speculation. Until all conspirators were arrested and responsible persons identified, he would not toy with the powerful forces held at bay only by the iron will and magical charisma of the (late) Fuehrer. He was sure that these forces were slowly awakening from their imposed slumber. All these thoughts crossed Goerings mind as he walked to the head of the table. As he approached his chair, escorting SS-Liebstandarte praetorian pulled the chair to allow him to sit. Another one placed neat folder on the desk, in front of Goering. Goering nodded at both of them, and they took their positions aside from the desk. Goering came to admire methodical efficiency of the Liebstandarte and their carefully trained choreography of protective detail.\n\n\"As you all know\" he spoke to the gathered men \"the Fuehrer has been killed last night.\" As he uttered these words, Goering tried to read the faces of men sitting in front of him. He couldn't detect any guilt on the face of the more obvious suspects, such as senior generals or heads of the security services, which took positions closest to the head of the table. All he could see there was deep wondering (presumably about the same thing), as they all tried to detect the same on each other’s faces. 'Curious' he thought, 'I am sure the perpetrator must be in this room.' He continued aloud \"Only this morning we received many condolences on behalf of leaders and people of all, but the countries we are at war with. Those others were quick to send us their assurances that they will maintain current 'relationship' with us, we all came to appreciate. Joachim\" he looked towards foreign minister, barely able to conceal his contempt \"if you please, provide us with details!\".\n\nVon Ribbentrop raised his eyes from the folder open in front of him and said \"Well, as we expected, Anglo-French coalition is continuing their encirclement policy. My personal belief and of most of my staff is that English are pushing the French further into this war. English sent their proclamation almost at the same time that it was broadcasted on their state radio. French were a bit more subtle and delivered it through Belgium, using mediation of Belgian Foreign affairs. Both proclamations are roughly identical in content and both refer to Ultimatum we received on 3rd of September.\" All present started excited whispering and head waving, expressing their surprise. \"Well this is about what one might expect on such a short notice\" said Goering. \"I believe they expect us to collapse without...\" he stopped, unsure how to refer to Hitler. It seemed so undignified to call him the late Fuehrer, and anything else was just grotesque. \"Herr Halder from the Oberkommando das Heeres will present our dispositions.\"\n\nHalder stood up, and started walking toward large map of Europe hanging on the wall. He felt eyes of SS troopers on him and he could swear that nearest one has almost unnoticeable relaxed his right hand and moved it closer to the gun hanging on the side. \"Herr Praesident, meine Herren, You can see on this map current dispositions of our forces, and of enemy formations identified so far. Here, here and here\" he said pointing on areas of Germany on the French border \"are our army groups A, B and C. Army group A is by far our strongest formation on the West. Currently it consists of 12th and 16th Army, Panzer gruppe Kleist, while 4th army in transit from Poland is also going to be part of this Army group. Army group B consists of 6th Army, formation created in October and currently being trained and 1st Army, already deployed. Army group C is deployed along the French border, covering their forces on Maginot line. This formation consists of 7th and 18th Army. We plan to fully deploy all formation by march 1940. At full strength, we will have 10 panzer divisions and 100 infantry division formations or their equivalents. So far, action on the front has been light. French tried limited offensive toward our Sigfried line, on narrow front. Why they stopped is not known. Our losses during this offensive were light. However, intelligence we received so far, as well as B-dienst have identified over 100 divisional formations active on the French side of the front. Reports from before the war indicated that French army has around 3500 armored vehicles. Although, admittedly, most troops are deployed in the area of Maginot line our reconnaissance flights over Northern France have detected large formations deployed in offensive posture near the border with Belgium.\" Halder stopped and started towards his seat, when Goering asked \"Herr Halder, can you elaborate our existing plans?\" This question caused Halder to freeze. How could he say that German Generalstaff has been unable to device plan that would differ from the one that lost the war quarter of a century ago? What is worse, Goering knew their plans and was involved in most aspects of operational planning. Was he trying to discredit him personally? Or entire army? He decided to stall \"Herr Praesident, we only have planning in the starting phases. We were supposed to present the draft of a plan in two weeks from now. That was before events of previous night.\"\n\n\"Herr Halder, please, we need your professional estimate of our chances. These people here must have full available information if any rational decision can be made!\"\n\nReluctantly, Halder continued \"To be frank, operational possibilities on Western fron are limited. We have three basic routes for assault. First, and most obvious one is common border. This option is unfavorable for attack. Rhein river is too wide to be forded easily, especially in spring. On the other side of the river we will be met with Maginot line with its formidable array of fortress and fortified positions. It would take appalling casualties to even approach this line, and breeching it is near impossible. Second and third option is taking route through flanks of the front, where we share border with small, neutral countries. On the left flank of the front we have Switzerland. We currently do not have plans ready for attack on Switzerland. Level of difficulties involving invasion of this country can only be guessed at without detailed study. My personal feeling is that this operation is perhaps even more difficult than outright attack over common border with France. Our only other option is an attack through Belgium. This operation is easy - Belgium is military highway to France since Caesar. However, it is also the most obvious route. As I explained earlier, French have deployed strong formations on their north. According to plans leaked to our spies, these forces are ready to start marching into Belgium at moment notice. We are not sure whether they would advance all the way or take positions on easily defensible river banks. Either way, it would mean meeting engagement. Tactical fluidity of such operations is notorious and little control is possible to senior commanders on either side. My colleagues believe that Wehrmacht would have advantage in this form of battle. I myself have am reluctant to waive off inherent risk of total loss of control and consequent loss of battle.\" Halder finished, glad that he wasn't interrupted, wondering if he perhaps was too frank.\n\n\"Thank you herr Generalloberst. You may take your seat now.\" Goering said, in obvious dismisal. Inwardly, he was glad that Halder gave such a briefing. Of course, he knew most of this, but others had to hear it from the mouth of professional soldier to truly appreciate the gravity of situation they were. \"Any comments on this?\"\n\nMost present had been stunned. Disparity between the forces of Germany and her enemies at the moment were discouraging. Other senior military officers present included Brauchitsch, Jodl and Kaitel, as well as admiral Roeder and Generalmajor Jeschonnek, Chief of Lutftwaffe General Staff. Jodl and Keitel, while aware of forces arrayed against their country, relied on Hitlers genius to overcome adversity as he had many times before. Their hope was extinguished and now they wondered whether their positions were safe. They didn't have anything to add to Halders expose. Other officers viewed land warfare as distant affair, outside their area of competence, while von Brauchitsch, who discussed all this with Halder earlier, decided to keep quiet unless asked directly. Admiral Canaris spoke next \"Herr praesident, if I may?\" \"You have my permission herr Admiral.\" Goering wasn't sure what to think about this enigmatic person. He knew Hitler was not fond of this former submarine officer. He also knew that Abwehr, which Canaris commanded was quickly becoming superflous organization, which Heydrich strived to include in his growing security empire. He may still prove useful, he thought. At that moment, Canaris started speaking \"Meine herren, my service has indication that western Allies are prepared to pursue this war. Our Foreing armies (West) department has confirmed the numbers herr Halder quoted earlier. We have sources claiming that further divisional formations are on the way from Englands colonies (or dominions as they call it) and that, instead of full offensive, Western powers intend to blockade Germany, cutting us off the world markets.\"\n\nGoering smiled. This meeting was turning out even better than he hoped. He still had to take care of one more thing on the agenda \"Well, time has come for even more unpleasant business. Herr Himmler, please continue.\"\n\nSmall man in black uniform stood up. Most people present in the room were afraid of him. Pure evil radiated from him wherever he appeared. He spoke without addressing anyone or without introduction of any kind \"Reichssicherheitshauptamt has started investigation into assassination of der Fuehrer almost instantly. Munich was isolated during the night, and nobody but personnel of RSHA was able to enter or leave city. I am happy to report that the man directly responsible for the bomb that killed der Fuehrer was arrested by Munich Gestapo office. Despite interrogations both there and in SS HQ in Berlin, he has not yet uncovered neither his accessories nor his employers. However, as he is interrogated for only 10 hours so far, we didn't expect to uncover anything of value yet. We at SS are certain that he didn't act in isolation, since person in question, as you can see from his file, is virtual nobody. Once we uncover his co-conspirators,\" at this he looked around the table ominously which caused shudders in everyone \"we will deal them some good, old fashioned SS justice!\"\n\n\"Since we appear to have gone over everything on agenda, I propose a break for fifteen minutes.\" said Goering as he rose up from his chair.\n\nAs Goering got up, Walther Funk, currently Reich minister of Economics approached him. As he approached Goering, two SS men tensed, but once Goering smiled, they relaxed a bit. \"Herr Praesident,\" started Funk \"wars are not won on the battlefields alone. Herr Praesident, you must allow me to present our current economic situation. You know how critical the economic situation currently is.\" Goering answered \"Of course I know. We must make decision on the further prosecution of the war. And we cannot do it without accurate information. Can you prepare all the figures for meeting in my office?\". After Funk nodded quietly, he continued \"Herr Funk, you will contact Generalmajor Georg Thomas of the OKW and herr Todt. You will work with them and come up with needs of the Army for the immediate future and next two years. I will invite heads of the major industrial geselschatfs. We will once again try to find the solution for our economic situation. See if we need anyone else for this meeting. Will two days be enough to collate all the figures?\" \"Of course herr Praesident. It will be ready!\" answered Funk without hesitation.\n\nHe wondered, however, if the figures will be found acceptable. When he presented those figures to the Fuehrer it caused him to embark on one of his infamous outbursts of rage. He was not pleased with 'suggestion' to contact Fritz Todt. The head of 'Organisation Todt' (so self-serving) was up and coming star in politics of Reich. His organisation, along with Office of the Four Year plan was seriously encroaching responsibilities of his ministry. Although he was not happy with it, he also had the office of the President of the Reichsbank, which put him in almost complete control of financial life of the Reich. His worries at the moment stemmed from the fact that economy of the Reich since beginning of the war has been failing. Raw materials necessary for the smooth functioning of the war production have been getting increasingly harder to obtain. Shortages of rubber, oil and certain strategic metals mostly copper and iron ore hampered production of almost all military equipment. How to solve this was not apparent, as imports in Germany have fallen for 80% since the beginning of the war. Improvisation only could get things so far and after certain point entire industry faced meltdown. He hoped that Goering could come to some solution or else the war was lost. Another suggestion, to contact General Thomas was more welcomed by Funk. He hoped he could manage to cut some of the unreasonable demands that were coming from the OKW.\n\nFifteen minute brake was already ending, and everyone was going back to their places around the table. It looked like the meeting will not end very soon.\n\nNovember 09th, 1430 Heidelberg, Steier’s house\n\nJosef Steier sat in his living room, listening to the radio. He was as shocked with events that happened during the night as the next man. His wife Anna was out shopping groceries which were increasingly hard to find. He wondered whether she could come back with any meat. He also wondered how they would feed their children when they come back from school. Hans was 15 and attended Realschule, but he was also member of Hitler Jugend. Before the war started this seemed like innocent child play, but Josef was really worried once war started that this would turn into something else. Now that der Fuehrer died, he was shocked and confused. For past six years, Hitler and Nazism where the major points of whispered discussions at his company, the small insurance office at Heidelberg. It was dangerous to talk too loud or against the regime since 1933. However, they all agreed that life was getting better under the Nazis. Their firm was taken from herr Goldstein, of course, but they were better off since then. He had to admit that Nazis made life of ordinary Germans better. But then, the war broke out. He hoped it would finish quickly and that his son would not be old enough to go to the army before it ended.\n\n1500, Reichkanzlei, Wilhelmstrasse 77\n\n\"I call this meeting to order. Meine herren, I hope you had your refreshments, as we will now continue our meeting.\" started Goering, interrupting lively chat going on around the table. \"After having heard the elaborations of foreign minister herr Ribbentrop, our chief of staff herr Halder and herr Canaris and having in meantime consulted with our Economics minister, her Funk I have concluded that our Reich is in extremely exposed position. As you know, in my capacity of Praesident and Kanzelar, I can take all the decisions. This grave situation, which threatens very survival of our Revolution and ideal, has impelled me to seek diplomatic means to end this conflict. It is clear that our Reich neither wanted nor provoked this war. All we wanted is to have contiguous territory, as is right of every self-respecting country in the world. We were denied this as you know, and the resulting war has ensued. Later today we will present our peace terms to our enemies through formal channels. We will seek mediation of friendly and neutral powers. I intend to offer end of all hostilities. In order to show our good faith I will immediately order a cease of all naval activity in the Northern Atlantic. Herr Roeder, see to it that our U-boats are given orders to proceed at their best speed towards nearest friendly port. They are to fire only if fired upon. We will notify our enemies of this. Furthermore, we will offer to retreat from the large swaths of Polish territory, keeping only what rightfully belongs, with regards to strategic defensibility of the frontier of course.\"\n\nThe announcement stunned all present. They expected that Goering would have a less belligerent stance, but this? First to speak was von Ribbentrop \"Herr Goering, but...\" That was as far as he got. \"Herr Ribbentrop you will address me as Herr Praesident from now on! If you have any constructive comments, let us hear them.\" \"Herr PRAESIDENT,\" said Joachim \"I am not sure that Allies will consider this offer satisfactory. The English hate us, they will not want to stop while they have the chance to strangle us. I think we should attack them and...\". Again he was interrupted by Goering, visibly annoyed \"Herr Minister, I asked for constructive comment. I will not stand for my decisions to be opposed by such nonsense. You heard herr Halder, didn't you? I cannot risk entire Reich to satisfy your vanity.\" At this moment, Goering decided that it would be best if he disposed of Ribbentrop. He knew the man wasn't very popular diplomat to say the least. He wasn't even a capable one. Pretty soon he will have to consider replacement but until then, he will try to take as much of foreign policy as he could. He already had engaged in some on his own, but now he had the authority of position to back up the attempts. \"But herr Praesident...\" tried Ribbentrop again, but one look from Goering was enough to shut him up. Red in face, he fumed inside yet he didn't dare try any further.\n\nNext, Goering turned towards von Brauchitsch. \"Herr Brauchitsch, do you estimate that Wehrmacht is capable of defending Reichs borders for the time being?\" After short contemplation and whispered conversation with Halder, he answered \"Of course herr Praesident. Consensus of Wehrmacht staff is that, given enough ammo, and without serious disturbances in the east or at home, we will be able to hold the front for at least a year, perhaps indefinitely. Soviet forces might present a threat later on, but at the moment they are too busy swallowing their alloted portion of Poland. According to our mutual treaty, they will try to subjugate Latvia and Estonia. Our intelligence information leads us to conclusion that they are massing armies on the Finnish border, probably with intention of exhorting concesions from Finns, after an ultimatum Soviet government issued on 31st of October.\"\n\n\"Thank you herr Brauchitsch. So, if nobody has anything to add, I will conclude this discussion!\" At that moment Himmler spoke \"Herr Praesident,\" he started, with slight trace of irony in his voice indicating that he didn't take Goering title all to seriously \"I must protest this. We cannot abandon our conquests, not with Bolsheviks in the east. Consider also, that Poland has sizeable Jewish population. We mustn't allow this so close to our borders. We just started solving the threat of Jews in our midst. If we allow a country on our border to exist with even slightest posibility of Jewish takeover, we will be in danger.\" \"Herr Himmler, this is why we have our Nurnberg laws. Precisely that situation is why we adopted these laws. Do you want to propose we amend them further?\" \"Herr Praesident\" continued Himmler \"You know my stand and stand of my service on this issue. I propose we leave this discussion for a less public setting, due to sensitivity of the issue.\" \"So, you do not have anything else to add?\" asked Goering. \"No herr Praesident. Not at this time.\" answered Himmler.\n\n\"One more thing is left for us to discuss. After hearing herr Himmler earlier, my intention is to have a public investigation into the assassination of der Fuehrer. I propose we establish an interagency Board of inquiry, responsible to me.\" What followed was expected. \"Herr Praesident, I must protest this. I believe my service is enough to conduct the investigation!\" Himmler exclaimed. \"What other agency should I cooperate with?\" \"Well, there is CriPo and as it appears that foreign powers might have their hand in this, Abwehr should be involved!\" Goering answered. It was obvious he has given this some thought. \"Of course, this investigation would be as public as possible.\" \"But herr Praesident, actions of SS and RSHA are not subject to public disclosure at any time. You know that as well as I. Those topics are sensitive...\" but Goering cut him off \"This is not subject of discussion herr Himmler. Significance of this event surpasses your objections. You will meet herr Canaris and both of you will outline plan of activities in order to conduct joint investigation. You will of course have full cooperation of civilian police as always. You will report to me directly.\" Himmler swallowed his true response and only said \"Jawohl, herr Praesident!\"\n\n\"I conclude this meeting!\" said Goering and stood up. He quickly left the room, escorted by SS personnel closely. The rest of present got up and left, wondering how will all this turn out. It was clear that all was not said between two most powerful people in Germany at the moment. But for the moment the conflict was frozen. Whether it will thaw, or some compromise will be reached, remained to be seen.\n\n0900 Eastern time, Washington DC, White House, Oval office\n\nRoosevelt sat behind his massive desk. He followed the events of previous day with detached interest. It all happened to late in the day for meaningful conversation between him and his subordinates to take place and the event in itself was while shocking, not the most important for United States. Doors of the office opened, and Cordell Hull entered. Elderly diplomat proved to be able and amicable fellow. He managed to convey good will of United States and made many valuable friendships. \"Mr. President, it seems that Goering has been appointed as Hitler's successor. I think our friends in Britain and France may have a little less to worry about now. Mr. Shirer visited Mr. Kirk in Berlin. He was present as one of accredited reporter on the 'inauguration' this morning. Mr. Goering didn't indicate any change in political direction of the Germany. However, here is the full transcript of his speech.\" reported Hull. \"Thank you, mr. Secretary. I hope the war will turn out for the best. The ease with which Nazis conquered Poland is frightening. General Marshall was surprised - he expected a prolonged battle on the Wistula at least.\" Cordell offered some consolation with his remark \"You must remember Soviets attacked Poland from the east. They were crushed between wolf and bear.\". After this remark, Cordell left. Roosevelt returned to reading the first draft of his speech meant for the ceremony he was expected to attend on 15th. He felt fitting to mention struggle for liberty and against tirany on the foundation of the Jefferson memorial. He made annotations to his speech writer to insert something along these lines.\n\nNovember 10th, 1600 Downing Street 10, London\n\n\"So, sir Wood, we have received this proposal from Swedish ambassador?\" Said Chamberlaine, looking at the bunch of papers he was holding in his hand. \"Did you have the chance to study it?\" \"No mr. Prime Minister, not in detail. It was delivered just two hours ago, so after reading it I immediately set off to show you. Sir, if this proposal is genuine it might offer peace in our time. But for real this time.\" Said lord Halifax, not hiding his excitement. He was against this war from onset, but he agreed that some things just couldn't be tolerated. However, what he read in the proposal he just delivered to his boss, offered an elegant way out of the war, which according to his oft repeated opinnion threatened existence of the empire itself. He knew Prime minister felt personally insulted by the former head of Germany. But little man was dead now. And first thing that new leadership did was to propose this bloody good offer. If it only depended on him to call this decision...\n\n\"Well this proposal is\" Prime minister paused, looking for word \"tempting for the lack of better word.\" He shuffled the papers a bit more and added \"Well, anyway we must contact our Ally and see what they make of this offer. As much as I am tempted to consider this peace proposal, I am reluctant to trust Germans. They have shown blatant disregard for basic civility so far. You realize that political situation in Germany is bound to be instable. Maybe if we wait a fortnight, our problems will be solved altogether by themselves.\" Halifax was more than a bit disappointed by PMs attitude, but didn't allow it to show. In the meantime, telephone on the PMs desk rang. He picked up the receiver and answered \"Yes?\" as he put it against his ear. He waived \"Stay!\" gesture at Halifax who half stood up from his chair.\n\nNovember 11th, 0800, northwest off Scotland\n\nKapitaenleutnant Wilhelm Ambrosius stood on the coning tower of U-43, his first officer Paul-Karl Loeser standing next to him. They used this opportunity to relax and spend some time outside cramped and noisy environment of U-boote. They didn't expect to see any ships in these waters, but both officers wanted to breathe some fresh morning air. They have surfaced only 20 minutes ago, as they observed thick fog through periscope. Young communication officer appeared through the hatch, carrying a piece of paper. Wilhelm hoped it was report on some convoy, so that he could finally let loose a few torpedoes. \"Herr Kapitaen, this came through in the clear!\" said young officer. 'In the clear?' thought Wilhelm. He was confused. He took message and scanned it looking for important bits. Wordlessly he handed it to Paul. Pauls eyes widened as he read the message. \"Herr kapitaen! Do you realise what this means?\" Paul asked. Wilhelm silently nodded. He wondered what genius came up with order not to fire unless fired upon. In U-boot being fired upon, usually meant you dont get to fire back. He decided that it probably was one of ground pounding, paper pushing admirals. He barked orders over internal communication system \"Navigator plot course towards Wilhelmshafen. Engineering, two thirds ahead. Helm, make your course 045.\" Confused \"Jawohl herr Kapitaen!\" echoed his orders. Next he said \"All hands. We have just received new orders. We are going back home. This patrol is over. This entire war might be over. Our order came in clear. Do not start celebrating yet, but I believe these are good news. I need everyone to double your attention, as I want to get back home in one piece. Double your attention, men. Good luck!\" he exclaimed finally.\n\nNovember 11th, 1200 Linz\n\nOn the recently named Adolf Hitler Platz, huge crowd has gathered. Sdkfz 11 moved slowly through the main street, as troops cordoned off people to each side. In front of the halftrack marched military orchestra, playing Marcia funebre by Ludwig van Bethoven. Halftrack pulled an artillery lafette modified for the cargo it now carried. Luxurious looking coffin covered with now familiar red flag was mounted upon carriage. Behind carriage procession of most important leaders of Germany marched slowly, solemn look on their face. As they reached future burial site, column stopped. Six soldiers, riding halftrack, dismounted and picked up coffin. Carrying it on their shoulders they proceeded to the grave site. Before laying coffin to the ground they picked up the flag, folded it carefully and gave it to the blond woman in black clothes. Ceremony continued as all leaders gave speeches. It was over in one hour. Crowd started defilee, signing in the book of mourning, open on the stand in front of the grave. Model of mausoleum was exhibited in front of it. Not everyone was grieving however.\n\nSome of the inhabitants of Linz vividly remembered the February morning when man, now laying beneath the ground, marched in their city, preceded by few hundred black clad troops who forced everyone out on the streets in order to welcome him back. As if they asked him to come. They also remembered arrests, fear and terror that followed. To think the man who caused all this was born here... None of them dared say this aloud of course. Not with feared SS around them. But no one could see inside their heads. At least their thoughts belonged to them.\n\nAfter the funeral, Road to Munich\n\nA large black Mercedes was travelling on the road bending slowly down the Alps. Inside, Goering and Halder were seated. Goering delibaretely arranged to have Halder travel with him back to Munich. He wanted to discuss current situation in Germany with head of most powerful force in Germany, so he arranged only the driver to be in the car. He hoped he could repeat Hitler’s strategy from 1932. As his precedent, Goering knew that he could not achieve control of the Reich without recruiting either Army or SS to his side. He was leaning more towards the Army, in spite the fact that outwardly he shared ideology with powerful SS chief. The crude methods employed by Himmler and disgust actions and methods of his thugs caused on international scene repelled him. His instinct told him that it would be better to cut off an arm (even if it was right one) than to lose entire body. \"Herr General, I wanted to have this chance to talk to you in private. You are aware that I have decided to embark on peace offensive. You know what terms I offered to our enemies. I am aware that some in the Armed forces may be against the extent of those terms. Warriors always find it is painful to abandon the conquest won through spilling of their blood and lost comrades. We are both military men, and although I never fought on the ground, I understand what it means to lose one's comrades.\" Goering said to his general, empathizing with him. He wanted to make the man comfortable and establish some sort of commonality with him. If he failed to win him over, there were not many good options remaining to him. \"As much as it hurts, one must take into consideration wider perspective. We must, if we want to save what we achieved up until now, accept certain sacrifices.\". Goering stopped to allow Halder to consider his words.\n\n\"Herr Praesident, I am at a loss. I... I just wasn't able to speak to your predecessor in those terms.\" Halder pondered how honest could he be? He decided to risk a bit and see the reaction. Afterwards he will see how far it would go. \"Herr Praesident, I am aware of the reasons that guided your decision. I share your opinion on certain agencies in our country.\". If he misread the reason he was here, Halder would get in lot of trouble for the previous statement. He relied on his instinct and it was not wrong. Conversation that followed between two men was not recorded nor written down anywhere. What they agreed in the Mercedes that day historians derived only through events that ensued in following weeks.\n\nNovember 11th, 1930, Koblenz, Army Group A HQ, dining room\n\nVon Rundstedt was sitting at his table sipping his customary glass of wine, waiting for von Manstein his chief of staff who was supposed to join him for supper. Heinz Guderian, appointed commander of XIX corps and famous 'inventor' of Panzer warfare, was supposed to join them. Guderian was invited on Manstein’s insistence, as he wanted to discuss with him the plan whose rough sketches he presented to von Rundstedt two weeks earlier. Due to the constant demands of forming up formation, touring the units and conferring with their subordinate officers, they grabbed this opportunity when everything was slowed as a consequence of the death of der Fuehrer. He heard steps approaching and the door to the dining room opened. Two officers stepped inside. They were engaged in animated conversation. As they saw aging general, they stopped in achtung stance and bowed, clicking their heels. Removing their hats, they approached at the table. Manstein put his briefcase by the table. \"Good evening, herr general!\" they called in unison to their superior officer. Rundstedt nodded lightly, gesturing them to take seats. \"Dispense with formalities please. We are not on duty, consider this a dinner among friends. Besides my rank is not that senior.\" \"Danke, herr General!\", answered Manstein. Servant appeared carrying their soup. Dinner passed with light conversation, sharing memories from previous war and polite questioning on life of their offsprings.\n\nAs they finished the desert, von Manstein opened his briefcase and took out folded map of Northern France and Low Countries. On the map various arrows of two different colors protruded from German border and towards France. Two thick arrows of one color started their journey on the German side of the border, extended over Belgium, turning slightly southwards and ending their journey on the banks of Somme river. Timeline on various points of the journey indicated that forces represented by the arrows were supposed to reach their final position one month after X-Day. On the other hand there was the arrow of different color, thicker than the previous one, protruding from German border, crossing south portion of Belgium and then turning northwards towards the coast. \"As you can see Heinz,\" Rundstedt used first name of his subordinate to enforce informality \"my chief of staff has devised a plan. Plan different than the one we are supposed to use once the order is given and if the order is given. But that decision is not up to us. What I want from you is to check and double check this plan as an expert in use of panzers. I will now allow let Erich to elaborate his plan further. You will correct his failings or improve his concepts to create a new plan. I want a plan for decisive victory, victory which would guarantee the end of war, unlike this plan from previous century. We want to be in Paris, not in some village on Somme in June. I intend to submit this plan for approval to high command. Of course, what we discuss here, well, you know.\" \"Must not leave this room!\" finished Heinz. \"Exactly, Heinz. Exactly.\" said von Rundstedt with satisfied smile. Manstein started talking, and Guderian was immediately absorbed in elegant strategic concept that was presented to him. He found it to his liking and in spirit with his beloved Panzerkorps.\n\nStory so far:\n\nAdolf Hitler was killed by a bomb set up by Johann Georg Elser. Elser was arrested by accident, even before bomb exploded. Goering takes over Hitler's position and starts sounding peace offer to the Western Allies. German military, which was already considering plot against Hitler is considering taking action. They decided to wait for proper moment, but to re-examine existing plans for military takeover of Reich’s government. SS, already investigating the assassination, is ordered to cooperate with other services in conducting further investigation. Also, Goering’s peace offer causes further rift between him and Himmler, as Himmler envisioned General governance area as his test bed, where he would conduct large scale experiment for his ideal of society he wanted to build in the east. Hitler was buried in Linz, and Goering, realizing inevitable conflict with Himmler starts courting Army. In the meantime Allies are considering whether to accept the offer coming from Berlin. Manstein, Rundstedt and Guderian work on their plan for decisive victory.\n\nNovember 12th, 0900, Tokyo, Imperial Palace\n\n\"Nomura-san,\" broke the silence Abe Nobuyuki, addressing his foreign minister \"Can you, please, comment on latest events in Europe?\" Nomura looked around the desk. Only the vital ministers were present in the room. This, aside of Prime minister and Foreign minister, included President of Privy council, Minister of finance, Army and Navy, ministers of Commerce and Industry and chief of Cabinet Secretariat, taking minutes of the meeting. Emperor took his customary position of unnoticeable presence. In carefully considered phrases Nomura said\n\n\"Gentlemen, our prospective ally Germany has been hit by an act of terrorism. Their head of government has been assasinated by bomb during one of the official celebrations. Although they have already named the successor, we have reason to believe that internal situation in Germany is not unlike one we had in Japan in 1936. We were also notified both by our ambassador Saburo and my own personnel that Germany has sent peace feelers to their enemies. This represents rather serious reversal for us, since we counted that attention of European colonial powers will be tied closer to home for extended period of time. Although nothing has yet been reported, I have outlined three scenarios:\n\n1. Germany continues war but it is destabilized further and a coup causes chaos inside Germany. Consequently, Germany losses war. Thus European powers attention is redirected to us.\n\n2. Germany makes peace, retreats from war, thus European powers are free and redirect their attention to us.\n\n3. Germany continues the war as we foreseen and we are free to continue with our plans.\n\nThose are basic scenarios. However, we are unable to estimate chances of any single of those scenarios actually coming to pass, since there is not enough information. On the other hand, United States has since that unfortunate incident with their vessel, increased support for China. Although there is no shooting war between us yet, we must consider we are in the state of economic war. United States consider our current policy overtly aggressive and feel that Japan represents a threat to their Pacific holding and is unstable factor in the Pacific basin. We will surely come to real conflict against America if we continue our present policy.\"\n\nGodo Takuo, Minister of Commerce and Industry spoke next \"Gentlemen, I must concur with my esteemed colleague. Embargoes of Allied powers against us create many difficulties in our industry. We are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of crude oil, iron ore and other raw materials we need. Until last year we depended on Australian iron ore supply, but they cut that off after we attempted to buy the mining company. We now face the prospect of slow strangulation of our economy unless the alternative supplies are found or embargo is lifted.\"\n\nArmy minister Hata Shunroku declared \"Mister Prime minister, I must advise you and other here that the Army is determined to bring the Chinese incident to conclusion. For us, there is no other option but to continue on our course. In case of worst-case prediction coming to pass, we might be willing to curtail our offensives for some time and allow some time for favorable diplomatic solution. I must stress that Communist interference in China is increasing. The time is running short. We must maintain presence in China in order to forestall Communist takeover, in which case we will face bigger danger than what we are now. Diplomatic service must put all their efforts in coming to an understanding with Americans and Allies. We cannot fight against China with one eye on the horizon and one hand tied. All we need is to be left alone for few months, and Army can finish the job.\"\n\nMany a Prime minister of Japan heard these words from their Army ministers during past few years. None dared stand to the Army and ask questions such as \"What happened to your prediction that the army needs only few more months you prophesized a year ago?\". Not that many Prime ministers lasted even that year. As soon as they were too critical of military staff, the government was brought down by resignation of army minister. Pretty quickly this settled into uncomfortable routine. Government gets in power, questions military, goes out of power and new government is sworn in. Abe knew this. He was sworn only 3 months ago and didn't intend to lose his office that quickly. \"Hata-san, this government has concurred to army wishes so far. However the events in Europe happen, we will not abandon any of our conquests in China, without assurance that China will never fall in Communist hands.\" Japanese, accustomed to listening to slightest detail, noticed the phrasing of the last sentence. Was Abe opening up possibility of limited retreat?\n\nNovember 12, 100 miles south off Cape of Good Hope, command bridge of Admiral Graff Spee\n\nCaptain Hans Langsdorff scanned the horizon with his high powered binoculars. The radio message that arrived in the clear the previous morning utterly confused him. He knew what happened in Germany, but he expected that, tragic as it might be, it wouldn’t affect his mission. Yet, now he had orders to turn towards home. His crew was happy enough with it. Their cruise lasted two months, during which they sunk around 100000 tons of enemy shipping, all the while being lucky enough to slip through the numerous hunting vessels.\n\nAs the ships engine started to act up two weeks ago, the crew felt that their luck was running out. Although Langsdorff ordered engineers not to reveal the full extent of the damage to the engines, the entire crew was already whispering about it. In truth the order to sail back home could not have come at better moment. If only Altmark appeared on rendezvous point as scheduled. His bunkers were a depleted and he didn't want to refuel in more constricted waters of the Northern Atlantic.\n\nAt that moment his navigation officer Juergen Wattenberg shouted \"SMOKE! I see smoke on the horizon, bearing 120.\". Hans instantly ordered \"Helm, steer full right. Evasive maneuver.\". This was the second ship they met on this busy sea lane. Once, it was his prey. Now he was ordered not to pursue it. Well, while not entirely happy, he could live with those orders.\n\n13 November, 1000 Zossen, OKH\n\nHalder was waiting for Canaris and von Witzleben to arrive. He made an appointment with them as soon as he arrived to Berlin. Witzleben needed some time to prepare and arrive from Saarbruecken, where he was stationed as commander of the 1. Army. Halder decided that those two were the only people he could trust with the assignement he received from the President. This assignment required him to gather a few units (he deduced that two divisions would suffice) and deploy them in certain manner, so that SS and other organizations connected to it were effectively neutralized. He knew he could count with Brandenburg regiment and he intended to use them in... At that moment a buzzer on his desk sounded. \"Let them in!\" Halder said. Admiral Canaris and General Witzleben entered through the door after a few seconds. \"Good morning, herr General.\" they said, greeting him. \"Good morning. It is nice to see you again herr Witzleben. How is your army doing?\" asked Halder amicably. \"Training as usual, herr General.\" answered Witzleben.\n\n\"Well, I'd like to explain you the reason for this meeting. Gentlemen, the President himself authorized me to conceive an operation. Objective of this operation is to neutralize certain organizations within Reich, opposed to our current leadership and suspected of plotting overthrowing of the legally established government by means of force. I was also authorized by the President himself to select trusted people to plan and execute this operation. What we discuss here you will be able to share with subordinates on need-to-know bases only and pending approval by me or President himself, should I be unavailable. Operation will be listed as ‘Schwarz’. You are not supposed to make any written records of this operation. Furthermore, all troops’ movements pertinent to execution of Operation ‘Schwarz’ must be either part of, or made to look like part of, routine troop movement. I must stress the significance of secrecy. Nobody and I mean nobody is to know of this operation except people who are absolutely indispensable for successful execution. Operation must be ready at any moment two weeks from now.\"\n\nWitzleben was surprised by this. He didn't know that situation between Goering and SS (what other organization might be plotting) has deteriorated so quickly. Well, this might be satisfying - arresting those SS thugs was one activity he would enjoy. As first shock subsided, serious discussion between three officers started. It continued for two more hours. Operation ‘Schwarz’ took its final form and they compiled list of candidates to be blessed with knowledge of it workings.\n\n1100 Bletchley Park, Bletchley\n\nAlexander Denniston and Arthur Bonsall seat in the office. They were going over latest report of \"Hut 8\", department trying to decipher German naval codes. Although head of the section Alan Turring expressed optimism, no significant breakthroughs were achieved yet. The only message that was recovered in entirety was sent in clear language, and that was nothing to brag about. The same result could have been achieved by a kid listening to the radio and knowing Morse code. It was Denniston who spoke first. \"Sir, we need at least one whole machine to make further progress. All we have now are the primitive version of machine recovered by the Poles, and few pieces of current versions. Alan has promised that with the whole machine he will have entire system broken by Christmas.\"\n\nArthur, the director of the GC&CS, just looked at Alexander with bemused look on his face. \"Sure, Alistair. I tried. I really tried.\" he started, irony visible in his voice \"But commercial department of Olympia factory in Berlin answered that they have this huge backlog and that domestic orders will have priority for foreseeable time. They thanked me for interest and added that something might be done if I could pop them a Typex. Alistair, they tend to sink by the time we get near those machines. And our friends from the Army have yet to capture a single tent, let alone signal outfit of German army.\" Alistair laughed bitterly. \"I know sir. But without the working machine, we will never be able to read their mail. Well not never, but not soon enough. Alan can read few words of every coded message. He swears that there are 12 subs in Atlantic. He even had approximate positions for 7. But since they stopped talking, those subs could be anywhere. At least we know where the seven of them were heading. We informed Admiralty, and they are trying to intercept them on the way to base. But it is large ocean.\"\n\nNovember 14th, 1113, Prague, former Czech Republic\n\nStudent Jan Opletal died 3 days earlier, due to the wounds he received during massive protests against Nazi occupation on 28th of October. His colleagues at the Prague University were walking in small groups around the University building. Approaching other students, they would just whisper \"Tomorrow, during funeral.\". The information spread virally. Students told it to their parents, parents to their friends. Demonstrations might not be that big, had not the rumors of impending peace negotiations spread through population of the city. People listened to BBC in secret, so they heard what Nazi authorities hid from them.\n\nCzechs decided, spontaneously and almost unanimously that this time, their voice will be heard. In 1938, they accepted the dictate of great powers, not wishing to needlessly suffer and trusting their Allies. Now they thought \"Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me!\". Having no weapons caches, no organized armed forces nor any hope of outside assistance and no central organization, it was miracle that population of Prague decided to voice their protest. With no other alternative, the ordinary citizens would turn up at the funeral of the murdered student. They knew that there was danger in this, but falling back to human’s primary instinct, they felt that security lay in numbers. No one would shoot thousands of unarmed civilians, would they?\n\n2100, Carinhall\n\nGoering and his wife Emmy were sitting in the living room. This was the first time in the week that Goering had enough time to spend with his family. Edda was already asleep and Emmy hoped that she could talk to her husband. \"Such a tragedy, Hermann. Poor Eva, I had to comfort her for two days. She was devastated on that night. I didn't dare leave her alone, for fear of what she would do. If only there was somebody for Magda. Luckily that the guard in front of the house heard the cries of the children and managed to save them before unfortunate woman got her hands on them. Do you know who did it, Hermann?\"\n\n\"Well that brute Heinrich claims that it was the carpenter Elser they captured. I ordered him to work with Abwehr, but he is constantly dragging his feet about it. I am afraid the worst Emmy. It had to be a conspiracy. Simply had to be. Herr Himmler thinks he is so smart, but I found out that he executed 15 guards detailed with Hitler. I know his right hand man, Heydrich conveniently had some ‘engagements’ and left the security arrangements to unsuspecting Christian. After all this, he produces that poor carpenter, who would confess to being his own mother after 10 hours of hell they gave him. It all stinks. I ordered the Army to prepare new Night of Long Knives. I am just waiting for the right moment now. I do not want to do anything while we are at war. I hope English will come to their senses and accept my offer during next few days.\"\n\n\"Oh, Hermann, will there be any danger to you? Himmler looks so dangerous and evil. Edda always cries when she sees him.\" Emmy said, with fear audible in her voice.\n\n\"Don't worry my darling. I have taken precautions. The men that guard me have been thoroughly checked. I have ordered Leibstandarte taken out of SS command chain. Since yesterday they are augmented by Armies special unit, Brandenburg. I should be safe.\"\n\n\"Oh, my poor husband. Such responsibility, thrown on you and so quickly. Please be careful. I don't know how I could live without you.\"\n\nNovember 15th, 0800, Prague, Prague Castle\n\nNeurath sat in his office. After having served a year in the government with no ministry assigned to him, Hitler appointed him a Reichprotector of Bohemia and Moravia. Immediately he faced problems, as people he ruled were used to great deal of democracy and personal liberties. He instituted censorship and banned all political activity. This provoked only further unrest. After a virtual rebellion broke out, Neurath ordered police to open fire and disperse protesters. Since then, situation was tense, but peaceful overall. Although Neurath expected whole thing to defuse by itself within next days, he ordered a security company to be prepared to act in case something happened. Student that was shot during protests died and his funeral, scheduled later today, was going to be a public event. The security chief has classified this event a high-risk event and ordered additional company of SS troops, training for deployment on the Western front to reinforce existing garrison deployed in barracks attached to the castle. The unit consisted of Sudetten Germans, who were known for their particular hatred of Czechs. Neurath hoped this was unnecessary precaution, but his security chief operated under \"Better safe, than sorry\" rule. Usual complement of Gestapo agents and informers were deployed around central square Vaclavske Namesti, around Malostranske Namesti and around cemetery. They had orders to observe and report, resorting to force only if things got out of hand.\n\n1012, Berlin, Bendlerblock, Reichs Ministry of Foreign affairs\n\nLetter from Goering said:\n\n\"Herr Ribbentrop, I have decided that foreign policy at this moment is on critical juncture. Since it is now obvious that peace negotiation will include certain concessions on the part of Reichsgovernment and that such concessions are now indivisible from general military and economic situations of the Reich, I have decided to take the post of the Foreign minister personally. Remain sure that I value all the services you provided to the Reich in the capacity of Minister for Foreign affairs. Without your work, our successes of previous year would not have come to pass. In order not to slight your position, I have decided to employ your capabilities in another challenging task. This task is indispensable from the aspect of the economy of the Reich. Upon my decision, you, herr Ribbentrop, have been appointed as Special diplomatic and economic envoy to South America. You will travel to Argentina, where your HQ will be at our embassy in this friendly country. I assure you that entire German diplomatic service in South America will be at your disposal. Your goal is to secure favorable trade terms and enable Reich to obtain raw materials. Letter of the Ministry of economics, attached to my letter will provide with detailed figures you need to know in order to work on the task. Rest assured that this posting if successfully completed will be adequately rewarded.\n\nYours Truly,\n\nHermann Goering, Reichspraesident\"\n\nAfter reading the letter, Ribbentrop was stunned. Two men who delivered it were standing by the door, waiting. Ribbentrop said \"Gentlemen, thank you for delivering this letter. I must now go see the Reichspresident.\" \"I am sorry herr Minister, that is impossible. Herr President is currently occupied. We have instructions to escort you to your home, where you will pack for immediate journey. We are afraid that itinerary is a bit complicated by the war, and since your task is sufficiently urgent, arrangements have been rushed by authority of herr President. We must leave immediately.\" said the taller escort. \"But he cannot do this to ME...\" raged Ribbentrop. Then he realized that he could. And that he just did. He wondered how long will exile, for this was exile, no sense pretending it was anything but, last.\n\nMeantime in Reichskanzlei\n\nIt has been long time since he last sat with all the heads of the industry. He called this meeting in order to consider the economic problems Reich faced. His secondary goal was to strengthen his own position. He knew that earning big industrialists trust was vital for control of economy. And control of economy was in turn vital for control of the Reich. \"Gentlemen,\" Goering started \"as you all know, Reich faces significant difficulties in securing important strategic materials critical for operation of our industry. Naval blockade enforced by our enemies has impaired our ability to import iron ore, rubber, oil, wolfram and copper, to mention but a few materials that many of your companies need. Although we intend to start negotiations with the enemy, we cannot be sure how long this situation will continue. What I expect of you is to increase rationalization to maximum. No single gram of material can be wasted. You understand that our production priority, in view of current situation, is material for war.\" \"Herr President, current shortage of raw materials is unbearable in long term.\" exclaimed Funk. He has been pressing for this meeting with Goering for few days now. Finally Goering agreed and meeting was scheduled. \"I know herr Minister. I have decided to send herr Ribbentrop to South America in order to try to secure us imports from there. However, I am pessimistic as to his chances, and then there is still the problem of shipping the goods. We need something much closer, something that cannot be choked off by enemy navy. And I have an alternative. Herr Schulenburg has sent us a report that government of Soviet Union is interested in some sort of trade agreement between our countries. He has indicated that they want the meeting between highest authorities of both parties.\" Alfried Krupp, representing the largest steel producer in Germany said \"Herr Praesident, the problem is not only raw materials. I, for one, face severe labor shortages if mobilization is extended.\" \"Well, I will give Herr Funks ministry authority to employ and mobilize any able body inhabitant of the Reich.\" answered Goering \"That should alleviate some of the shortages.\"\n\n\"Herr Funk, as we have lost services of herr Goebbels, I am forced to appoint you as Minister of Public enlightment and Propaganda. Herr Todt, you will take over herr Funks place, while I intend to place herr Albert Speer to replace you as head of the Organisation Todt. The necessary paperwork will be completed by the end of week, but changes are effective immediately.\" announced Goering. \"Office of the Four Year plan will be joined with the Ministry of Economics.\"\n\n\"Herr Thomas, do you have anything to add?\" asked Goering. General-major Thomas answered \"Herr President it is the estimate of OKW economics staff that we can support the war effort with extremely careful rationalization of resources. However, large scale increase in production of war material is not possible without prior investment. Our railways are in particularly dire conditions. Herr Dorpmueller has provided detailed report. Deutche Reichsbahn lacks enough locomotives and we cannot transport coal from the mines to the factories.\" Goering, who knew some of this situation tried to offer some consolation \"Herr Thomas, we do not expect any large scale military operations in the next few months. As I read in herr Dorppmueller report, some of the problems are largely seasonal, and by the end of winter most of our problems should be solved. I hope that we will manage to come to diplomatic solution for our conflict, after which we will be able to solve these problems systematically. In the meantime, priority remains in respective order: needs of Wehrmacht, then of arms industry and then of civilian needs. I conclude this meeting. Thank you, gentlemen.\"\n\n1228 Prague, Charles Bridge\n\nHauptsturmfuehrer Roland Klein observed as his company was establishing a blocking point on the bridge. They have been ordered to block approach to the Prague Castle, since Gestapo agents observed huge crowd of Czechs marching through the city, heading towards the bridge. According to informants a group of students, no doubt the same group that incited the protests two weeks ago incited the mob to protest German authorities. SS company looked forward to some activity to break the boredom of routine training. They were fully armed and he ordered machinegun section of his company to set up their two MG34 machineguns at the center of the blockage. On the other end of the bridge, security company of the castle formed a cordon formation. The purpose of SS troops was to act as fall back point in case crowd managed to overwhelm the security company. Roland doubted this would happen, but he would be ready. No Czech mob will pass his troops. The men in his company were all young, 18 year old boys who lived in Sudetenland, and most hated Czechs with passion.\n\nAt that moment, a noise filled the air. It was the noise of thousands of people chanting. Roland couldn't understand what they were saying, but he was sure it wasn't very flattering to Germans. When crowd reached the security cordon, they stopped. Front row of protesters closed together, and hand in hand they advanced on security cordon. For a moment it looked like the cordon would stop them, but then the line of troops bent inside toward the bridge, and second later it broke. Protesters started pushing, and then a few of young man picked one of soldiers and dropped him in Vltava over the bridge railing. Roland had his orders what to do in this case. He just bellowed \"Machinengewehr sektion, bereiten.\" He heard the distinct sound of MG-34 being chambered. His soldiers tensed, training their weapons towards crowd. As crowd reached half of the bridge, soldier of his unit shouted \"Achtung! Citizens of Prague you must disperse now! If you do not disperse we will open fire!\". Crowd didn't show any sign of stopping. They might not even have heard the call. Roland belowed \"Einrichten!\". Weapons were ready, and soldiers took firing position. They were positioned in two rows, 20 people each. Machineguns were put on the trucks, parked in blocking position. Warning was repeated once more, but crowd just continued. They were less than twenty meters away. At that moment, Roland ordered \"FEUER!\". Sounds of rifles firing echoed over the river. First row of protesters fell to the ground, but people behind just kept on coming. Sound that came next was unmistakable. It was the sound of machineguns firing in anger. Soldiers, manning the formidable antipersonnel weapon single handedly responsible for death of hundreds of thousands in the previous war, used long bursts, firing more than 500 rounds into the crowd. All hell broke loose. If the first salvo of rifle fire didn't frighten the people, machinegun fire absolutely terrorized them. Many just dropped to the ground, not wounded, but hoping to avoid being shot. Others turned to run. Third echelon of SS troops, passed between two rows of men who just fired on the crowd. They didn't carry firearms, but batons.\n\nAt the end of the day, more than 100 people were counted dead. Among them there were two Germans of the security detachment. Over a thousand was seriously wounded or beaten. All were arrested and sent to Dachau. Gestapo agents and informers identified more prominent protesters, who were later arrested in their homes. Final figure of arrested and deported people climbed to 2350. The terror of that day remained imprinted in minds of Prague people. The lesson they learned from this was that without the careful organization and at least some weapons, no amount of mass protest would deter Germans. Although Neurath hoped the events wouldn't get to this point, he justified the actions of the day. Hauptsturmfuehrer Roland was commended for braking up the demonstrations. Neurath also ordered Gestapo office of Prague to pay close attention to people who try to leave city in following days. He didn't want news of this event to spread outside of Reich. But, in this he was already late.\n\n1326 Hours, Reichskanzlei\n\nHaving finished his previous meeting, Goering started preparing for his next guest. He had to be careful and pick his words with care. Although he was sure that no peaceful solution to ongoing confrontation with SS is possible anymore, he was not going to escalate the conflict to the next level without at least trying to reconcile with Himmler. Himmler himself eagerly accepted invitation for the meeting, since he insisted on earliest possible time. Goering was less satisfied with this choice, since he wanted to delay possible final confrontation until peace or at least truce with foreign enemies. Anyway, this worked just as well... He retrieved a cigar from the box on his table and just as he was about to light it, a buzzer on his desk sounded. \"Herr Reichsfuehrer SS to see you herr Praesident\", his secretary announced through the speaker. \"Let him in.\" As the doors opened, Himmler walked into the room. He was wearing fresh dress uniform, no doubt with intention to induce respect. Well, perhaps it worked on the other people, but Goering was beyond the dubious charm, or whatever it was that got Himmler to the position he occupied. Himmler stopped and extended his right hand. \"Herr Himmler, good afternoon!\" Goering greeted him. \"Good afternoon, herr Praesident.\" This time there was no irony, but Goering was sure that the words were deliberately pronounced with hesitation.\n\n\"Herr Himmler, I invited you to get a report on your joint investigation. It was due yesterday, but I haven't found anything on my desk.\" Himmler responded \"Well, herr Praesident, I do not want to clog your desk with useless reports of 'No further progress in investigation.'. Elser insists, despite all our efforts, that he worked alone. We checked his expenditures, we interviewed neighbours, arrested entire family, and everything was overturned in his house and shop. We could not establish any connection between him and any group.\" \"Herr Reichsfuehrer\" Goering used the proper official title to enforce the meaning \"That is impossible. I expect results, not excuses. Herr Himmler, I also gather that you are against the peace proposal I gave. Are you aware of situation in which we are? Both economically and militarily?\" asked Goering. Himmler answered \"Herr Praesident, I am not an economist. But as a soldier, I am aware only that one’s enemies should be attacked. I believe we can win. We have better discipline and more determination. Those are decisive values in war. Our generals barely qualify for the name of soldier. My opinion is---\" Goering interrupted him \"Oh yes, you would know, from your extensive experience in the field of battle. Our general staff is old institution. It is one of the oldest in this country. I must and I will trust their judgment. It seems to me you should keep your mind on security services and not trying to run the war instead of me and people paid to do it.\" Himmler was outraged by this retort. \"Herr praesident, I will not stand to this. SS is the only protector of our ideology. Even your position depends on it.\" \"Is that a threat herr Himmler?\" asked Goering. \"No herr Praesident, it is merely a statement of fact. If you will excuse me, I must leave you.\" Himmler stood up, without waiting for response. Goering just waived his hand in dismissal.\n\n'So it comes to this. I cannot believe that history repeats like this.' Goering lamented. He didn't want internal conflict at this moment, but it was now inevitable. He was being threatened and he had to respond. He took the phone and said \"Get me Chief of staff.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Downing Street 10, London\n\n\"Gentlemen, as you know, after conferring with French government and governments of our dominions, decision has been made to start negotiation with government of Germany.\" Chamberlain opened the meeting \"We have agreed to start first round of negotiations in two days in The Hague. We intend to request from the German government to demilitarize the border between France and Germany, evacuate areas of Poland to be determined during negotiations, to allow for international control of armaments and readiness of German army for next ten years. We have gathered here to determine minimum demands acceptable to us.\"\n\n\"I think we cannot accept any terms short of surrender of Germany and evacuation of all areas occupied after 1938.\" spoke Churchill. \"They must disband all but 20 divisions. That is my opinion, and I believe great part of public.\" Chamberlain expected something like this from his bellicose Minister of Navy. \"Sir Winston, while your opinion is valued, I must oppose you. Most of Conservative and Labor party disagree with you. My voters disagree with you.
