        "text": "Johan Gabrielsson was six when he was told that one of his relatives tried to kill Hitler.\n\nThe boy and his father were admiring the highways as they sped along the German autobahn in the 1960s.\n\n\"Hitler did such a great job,\" Johan said from the backseat. \"He built all these highways where cars can go as fast as they want.\"\n\nHis mother angrily put a stop to the talk.\n\n\"I don't want to hear any more about Hitler,\" she said. \"He was evil.\"\n\nJohan sobbed quietly for a while, then his mum broke the silence.\n\n\"You know we have a relative who tried to kill him, Hitler.\"\n\nIt would be decades before Johan learned the truth behind that story — the search for his family's history taking him to some of the darkest chapters of the 20th century.\n\nA mysterious photo\n\nJohan grew up in Sweden, and remembers family gatherings with members of his maternal grandmother's side of the family, the Sodensterns.\n\nOn the hallway was a picture of a man in uniform. All he knew was his name: Georg.\n\nBut every time he asked his mother's uncle Lennart about him, he was told: \"Next time you come, I tell you the story.\"\n\nHe never did.\n\nJohan would see another photo of Georg von Sodenstern many years later. In it, the general is standing next to Adolf Hitler.\n\n\"He has a round face and a small moustache. It's spooky, he looks a bit like my eight-year-old son,\" Johan says.\n\nJohan's mother didn't have much to do with her mother's side of the family.\n\nHer mother had died in childbirth.\n\n\"I grew up with the knowledge that I was the cause of my mother's death; my siblings said I killed her. We ended up not talking about my mother, or that side of the family,\" she recalls.\n\nOn Johan's wedding day, his mother gave him the last reminder she had of her mother.\n\nTwo silver spoons, decorated with the Sodenstern family crest — a helmet, and three stars.\n\n\"I remember thinking it was a bit strange, that today of all days she wants to give me something that belonged to my grandmother's family. A family that we never talked about,\" Johan says.\n\nBut the spoons, and their coat of arms, pique his interest.\n\n\"It's a memory of my grandmother but I'm also excited that the crest belongs to a man who tried to kill Hitler. He's a man I want to know more about — it's a story my great-uncle never finished.\"\n\nKnights and generals\n\nJohan learns the Sodensterns were a Swedish noble family, and with his mother, visits the country's House of Knights.\n\nThe walls of its ornate Great Hall are lined with hundreds of coats of arms.\n\nHis mother rests on a bench, craning her neck to see the Sodenstern crest, four metres up.\n\n\"It makes me realise how far removed we feel, she and I, from our family's history,\" Johan says.\n\nHistorian Pontus Ragnö tells Johan the Sodensterns of hundreds of years ago were a family of traders and soldiers who lived in the part of Northern Germany that then belonged to Sweden.\n\nYears of pressure from neighbouring Austria and Russia meant the military was important to the area.\n\nMr Ragnö says the family most likely got its knighthood after lending money to Sweden's King.\n\n\"Before the land was returned to Germany — or Prussia as the area was called — about 20 families decided to follow the king back to Sweden. Other members of the Sodenstern family decided to remain in Prussia and continued their military tradition,\" he says.\n\n\"Many of Hitler's top generals came from Prussia.\"\n\nThe plot\n\nAs Johan continues his search, the reminders of the horrors of history are never far away.\n\nWhile walking down a leafy, cobblestone street in Berlin, shiny brass stones in the pavement catch Johan's eye.\n\n\"They're inscribed with the names of the Jewish families that used to live at the address,\" Johan says.\n\n\"They were all taken to Auschwitz.\"\n\nAt the German National Archive, Johan learns his mysterious great-uncle became an officer in World War I, and a general in World War II.\n\nHe finds letters from this General Georg von Sodenstern.\n\nHe wrote: \"Hitler had this astonishing acting talent, of which he let himself be carried away to self deception. Hitler made a nearly two hour speech that tired me to the ground … not too much was resonating with me.\"\n\nOne of Sweden's leading experts on World War II, Christer Bergström, says many of the old Prussian generals were unhappy with Hitler — a politician — meddling in military matters.\n\n\"They had this scornful nickname, they called him the Little Sergeant,\" he says.\n\nThat unhappiness would lead von Sodenstern, Erwin von Witzleben and a number of other generals to plan a coup in 1937.\n\n\"Hitler gathered his generals and told them about his war plans, which in those days included an attack against Czechoslovakia,\" Mr Bergström says.\n\n\"So they were frightened then and they made a plan that they would use the army to launch a coup against Hitler on the very same day as he attacked Czechoslovakia.\n\n\"They repeatedly secretly contacted Chamberlain, the British prime minister, and informed him about this, and said, 'You can go ahead and threaten Hitler with a war and we will launch a coup against him.'\"\n\nBut Chamberlain wouldn't, and the plan fell apart.\n\nVon Witzleben was later executed after a second assassination plot failed to kill Hitler.\n\nVon Sodenstern was made chief of staff to a general overseeing Army Group South — part of the attack against the Soviet Union.\n\nHistorian Johannes Hurter says Army Group South operated in areas where war crimes were definitely committed.\n\n\"Outside Kiev, in Babi Yar, over 33,000 Jews were executed. To not know, or not to be aware of such atrocities, doesn't hold up,\" he says.\n\nJohan's family story of his great-uncle was becoming more complicated.\n\n'These unpleasant things'\n\nOne of the family tales Johan had heard was of a Sodenstern castle in Georg's home town of Kassel, Germany.\n\nBut standing on the street bearing the family name he saw nothing but a rundown park with dry patches of grass.\n\nTo find out more about Georg he looks through his testimony at the Nuremberg trials. He dreads what he might find.\n\n\"Until now Georg Sodenstern has felt buried to me,\" Johan says.\n\n\"What part did he play in some of the worst atrocities of the war?\"\n\nIn one section von Sodenstern recalls the order that every German soldier was to execute any member of the Communist Party on the spot.\n\n\"For the soldiers, it was a very unpleasant arrangement, the way it was presented something best to avoid or to circumvent. But at the same time, we had to come to terms with the order in a way that would not harm the discipline and morale of the troops.\"\n\nMr Bergström says he doesn't think by \"morale\" von Sodenstern meant their \"fighting spirit\".\n\n\"I think he meant that their human values were undermined by just shooting people like that,\" he says.\n\n\"When the troops got used to just shooting people, and when it was sanctioned from the higher echelons, their own moral values were eroded.\"\n\nIt wasn't just communists who were shot. It was also Roma, Jews and other civilians.\n\nJohan's mother-in-law Rosemary Block volunteers at the Sydney Jewish Museum. She's travelled to many of the areas where von Sodenstern's army operated.\n\n\"When you go there, you are walking on top of the abyss, on top of the grave of all these people,\" she says.\n\nIt's estimated between 100,000 and 150,000 people were executed by various groups, including the SS death squads and German intelligence units.\n\nIn von Sodenstern's testimony he explains how the high command of his army group felt about it.\n\n\"We saw the statistics of what was going on and wanted as little as possible to do with these unpleasant things. We saw them carrying out their official duties, but a sense of relief not to be directly involved.\"\n\nMr Hurter says generals like von Sodenstern closed their eyes to the horror, choosing to focus on what they thought was the real threat — the communists.\n\n\"He didn't want to be side-tracked by what was happening while he waged war, those crimes happened in the periphery of his vision.\n\n\"He was a total professional, he was running a military force and contributed to the initial success of Army Group South, but he let himself be used by Hitler. \"\n\nA year before the war ended, von Sodenstern was dismissed.\n\nMr Bergström says it was because of his criticism of Hitler. He says many generals were viewed with great suspicion.\n\n\"There were many among the SA and SS who just wanted to massacre all of the generals, because they regarded them as traitors or potential traitors.\"\n\nJust as Johan's dreams of a grand family castle faded, so did the heroic story of Georg von Sodenstern.\n\nHe now saw a man who was caught up in a war machine, but who turned a blind eye to the most vicious atrocities.\n\n\"I'd like to believe that after the war, he and my great-uncle Lennart took a stroll in that beautiful park and that Georg expressed guilt about what he'd been part of,\" Johan says.\n\n\"I do know that after the war, Georg worked with the Allied forces and created a unit to cast light on the German army's actions during the war.\"\n\nJohan walks with his mother, now 91, through the fallen headstones of an abandoned graveyard in Sweden.\n\nShe's searching for her mother's grave. She says it's the last time she'll ever visit.\n\nWhen they find it, the gold letters that spell out her name are hard to make out.\n\n\"It wasn't something you were proud of, being related to a German general, but it's great for my grandchildren to know a bit about their history,\" his mother says.\n\n\"I can say, after visiting my mother's grave, and having children and grandchildren, I do feel more that life is a gift.\n\n\"It's been a long journey.\""
