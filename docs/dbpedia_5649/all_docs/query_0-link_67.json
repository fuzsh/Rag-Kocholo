        "text": "20 July 1944 of the year in Hitler’s headquarters in the Görlitz forest near Rustenburg in East Prussia (the wolf’s den) was the most famous attempt on the Fuhrer. From Wolfsschanze (German Wolfsschanze), Hitler led military operations on the Eastern Front from June 1941 of the year to November of 1944. The bet was well guarded, it was impossible for an outsider to enter it. In addition, the entire surrounding area was in a special position: just a kilometer away, the headquarters of the Army High Command was located. For an invitation to the Headquarters, a recommendation was needed from a person close to the top leadership of the Reich. The call to the meeting of the Chief of Staff of the ground forces of the reserve Klaus Schenk von Stauffenberg was approved by the head of the Wehrmacht High Command, the chief adviser to the Fuhrer on military issues, Wilhelm Keitel.\n\nThis attempt was the culmination of a military opposition plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler and seize power in Germany. The conspiracy that existed in the armed forces and the Abwehr against 1938 of the year involved the military, who believed that Germany was not ready for a big war. In addition, the military was angry about the increasing role of the SS troops.\n\nLudwig Augustus Theodore Beck.\n\nOf stories assassination attempts on Hitler\n\nThe 20 assault of July was 42 in a row, and they all failed, often Hitler survived by some miracle. Although Hitler's popularity among the people was high, he also had enough enemies. Threats to physically eliminate the Fuhrer appeared immediately after the transfer of power to the Nazi party. Regularly the police received information about the impending assassination attempt on Hitler. So, only from March to December 1933, at least ten cases were, according to the opinion of the secret police, a danger to the new head of government. In particular, the ship's carpenter from Königsberg, Kurt Lutter, was preparing with his colleagues 1933 in March an explosion at one of the election rallies, at which the head of the Nazis was to speak.\n\nFrom the left Hitler, basically, tried to eliminate the loners. In 1930, four attempts were made to eliminate Adolf Hitler. So, November 9 1939 in the famous Munich beer Hitler spoke on the occasion of the anniversary of the “beer putsch” that failed in 1923. Former communist Georg Elzer prepared and detonated an improvised explosive device. During the explosion, eight people died, more than sixty people were injured. However, Hitler was not injured. The Fuhrer completed his speech earlier than usual and left a few minutes before the bombing.\n\nIn addition to the left, Hitler’s supporters of the Black Front, Otto Strasser, tried to eliminate Hitler. This organization was created in August 1931 of the year and united extreme nationalists. They were unhappy with the economic policies of Hitler, who, in their opinion, was overly liberal. Therefore, in February 1933, the Black Front was banned, and Otto Strasser fled to Czechoslovakia. In 1936, Strasser persuaded a Jewish student, Helmut Hirsch (he emigrated to Prague from Stuttgart), to return to Germany and kill one of the Nazi leaders. The explosion was planned to take place in Nuremberg, during the next congress of the Nazis. But the attempt failed, Hirsch was surrendered to the Gestapo by one of the conspirators. In July, the 1937 of the year in the Berlin prison of Plotzensee, Helmut Hirsch, was executed. The Black Front tried to plan another attempt, but it didn’t go further than the theory.\n\nThen Hitler wanted to kill the student theologian from Lausanne Maurice Bavo. He was unable to penetrate the Fuehrer’s speech on the fifteenth anniversary of the “beer putsch” (November 9 1938). Then the next day he tried to get into the residence of Hitler in Obersalzburg and there to shoot the leader of the Nazis. At the entrance, he said that he should give Hitler a letter. However, the guards suspected something was wrong and arrested Bavo. In May, 1941, he was executed.\n\nErwin von Winzleben.\n\nConspiracy of the military\n\nPart of the German military elite believed that Germany was still weak and not ready for a big war. The war, in their opinion, would lead the country to a new catastrophe. A small circle of senior officers of the armed forces and the Abwehr, who dreamed of changing the state course, was formed around the former chief mayor of Leipzig, Karl Goerdeler (he was a well-known lawyer and politician).\n\nA prominent figure among the conspirators was Chief of the General Staff Ludwig Augustus Theodore Beck. In 1938, Beck prepared a series of documents criticizing Adolf Hitler’s aggressive designs. He believed that they were too risky, adventurous in nature (given the weakness of the armed forces that were in the process of becoming). In May 1938, the Chief of General Staff spoke out against the plan of the Czechoslovak campaign. In July, 1938 Beck sent a memorandum to the commander-in-chief of the land forces, Colonel-General Walter von Brauchitsch, in which he called for Germany’s senior military leadership to resign in order to prevent the outbreak of war with Czechoslovakia. According to him, there was a question about the existence of the nation. In August, 1938, Beck filed a resignation report and ceased to perform the duties of the Chief of General Staff. However, the German generals did not follow his example.\n\nBeck even tried to find support from the UK. He sent emissaries to England, at his request, Karl Hordeler traveled to the British capital. However, the British government did not make contact with the conspirators. London walked the path of \"appeasement\" of the aggressor in order to send Germany to the USSR.\n\nBeck and a number of other officers planned to remove Hitler from power and to prevent Germany from being drawn into the war. For the coup prepared assault group of officers. Beck was supported by a Prussian aristocrat and a staunch monarchist, commander of the 1 Army, Erwin von Witzleben. The strike group consisted of officers of the Abwehr (military intelligence and counterintelligence) led by the chief of staff of the intelligence department abroad, Colonel Hans Oster, and Major Friedrich Wilhelm Heinz. In addition, they supported the ideas of the conspirators and were unhappy with the policies of Hitler's new chief of the General Staff, Franz Halder, Walter von Brauchitsch, Erich Goepner, Walter von Brokdorf-Alefeld, and the head of the Abwehr, Wilhelm Franz Canaris. Beck and Vitsleben were not going to kill Hitler, they initially only wanted to arrest him and remove him from power. At the same time, the Abwehr officers were ready to shoot the Fuhrer during the coup.\n\nThe signal for the beginning of the coup was to follow after the start of the operation to seize the Czechoslovak Sudetes. However, there was no order: Paris, London and Rome gave the Sudetenland to Berlin, the war did not take place. Hitler became even more popular in society. The Munich Agreement solved the main task of the coup - it prevented the war between Germany and the coalition of countries.\n\nHans Oster.\n\nThe Second World War\n\nMembers of the Hölderer circle considered the beginning of World War II a catastrophe for Germany. Therefore, there was a plan to blow up the Fuhrer. Erich Kordt, an adviser to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, was supposed to take over the organization of the blast. But after the attempt of 9 in November 1939 by Georg Elzer, the security forces were on the alert and the conspirators failed to get explosives. The plan failed.\n\nThe Abwehr leadership attempted to thwart the invasion of Denmark and Norway (Operation Vezeryubung). Six days before the start of Operation Teachings on the Weser, 3 on April 1940, Colonel Oster met with the Dutch military attache in Berlin, Jacobus Guysbertus Sas, and informed him of the exact date of the attack. The military attache was supposed to warn the governments of Great Britain, Denmark and Norway. However, he only informed the Danes. The Danish government and army could not organize resistance. Later, supporters of Hitler \"cleaned up\" the Abwehr: Hans Oster and Admiral Canaris executed 9 on April 1945 at Flossenburg concentration camp. In April, 1945 also executed another head of the military intelligence department, Hans von Donanji, who was arrested by the Gestapo in 1943.\n\nThe successes of the “greatest commander of all times,” Hitler and the Wehrmacht in Poland, Denmark, Norway, Holland and France, also became a defeat for the German Resistance. Many were discouraged, others believed in the Fuhrer's \"star\", the population supported Hitler almost completely. Only the most irreconcilable conspirators, like a Prussian nobleman, an officer of the General Staff Henning Hermann Robert Carl von Treskova, did not resign themselves and tried to organize the murder of Hitler. Treskov, like Canaris, had a sharply negative attitude towards terror against the Jews, the commanding and political staff of the Red Army, and tried to protest such orders. He told Colonel Rudolf von Gersdorf that if the instructions about the shootings of commissioners and “suspicious” civilians (almost any person could be entered into this category) are not canceled, then “Germany will completely lose its honor, and this will make itself felt hundreds of years. The blame for this will be laid not on Hitler alone, but on you and me, your wife and mine, your children and mine. ” Even before the start of the war, Treskov said that only the death of the Fuhrer could save Germany. Treskov believed that the conspirators must make an active attempt to assassinate Hitler and the coup d'état. Even if it fails, they will prove to the whole world that in Germany not all were supporters of the Fuhrer. On the Eastern Front, Treskov prepared several plans for the assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler, but each time something interfered. So, 13 March 1943, Hitler visited the troops of the group \"Center\". On the plane that was returning from Smolensk to Berlin, a bomb was disguised as a gift, but the fuse did not work.\n\nA few days later, Von Treskov’s colleague in the headquarters of the Center group, Colonel Rudolf von Gersdorf, tried to undermine himself with Adolf Hitler at an exhibition of captured weapons in Berlin. The Fuhrer was supposed to spend an hour at the exhibition. When the German leader appeared in the arsenal, the colonel set the fuse to 20 minutes, but after 15 minutes, Hitler unexpectedly left. With great difficulty, Gersdorf managed to stop the explosion. There were other officers who were willing to sacrifice themselves to kill Hitler. Captain Axel von dem Boucher and Lieutenant Edward von Kleist, independently of each other, wanted to eliminate the Fuhrer during the show of the new military uniform at the beginning of 1944 of the year. But for some unknown reason, Hitler did not show up at this demonstration. Ordinarial Field Marshal Bush Eberhard von Breitenbuch plan to shoot Hitler 11 in March 1944 at the Berghof residence. However, on this day, the German leader was not allowed to speak with the field marshal of the orderly.\n\nHenning Hermann Robert Karl von Treskov\n\nPlan \"Valkyrie\"\n\nSince winter 1941 — 1942 the deputy commander of the reserve army, General Friedrich Olbricht, developed the plan \"Valkyrie\", which was to be implemented during an emergency or internal unrest. According to the Valkyrie plan during the state of emergency (for example, because of mass actions of sabotage and the uprising of prisoners of war), the reserve army was subject to mobilization. Olbricht modernized the plan in the interests of the conspirators: the reserve army during the coup (the murder of Hitler) was to become a weapon in the hands of the rebels and take key objects and communications in Berlin, suppress the possible resistance of the SS units, arrest the supporters of the Fuhrer, the top Nazi leadership. The Wehrmacht’s chief communications officer, Erich Velgibel, who was part of the conspirator’s group, together with some trusted employees, had to ensure the blocking of a number of government communication lines and at the same time support those that the rebels would use. It was believed that the commander of the reserve army, Colonel-General Friedrich Fromm, would join the conspiracy or be temporarily arrested, and in this case Göpner will take over the leadership. Fromm was aware of the conspiracy, but he was waiting. He was ready to join the rebels in the event of the news of the death of the Fuhrer.\n\nAfter the Fuehrer's assassination and seizure of power, the conspirators planned to establish a provisional government. Ludwig Beck was to become the head of Germany (president or monarch), Karl Gördeler was to lead the government, and Erwin Witzleben - the armed forces. The interim government was to first of all conclude a separate peace with the Western powers and continue the war against the Soviet Union (perhaps as part of the Western coalition). In Germany, they were going to restore the monarchy, to hold democratic elections to the lower house of parliament (to limit its power).\n\nThe last hope for success with the conspirators was Colonel Klaus Philipp Maria Schenk, Count von Stauffenberg. He came from one of the oldest aristocratic families in southern Germany, associated with the royal dynasty of Württemberg. He was educated on the ideas of German patriotism, monarchical conservatism and Catholicism. Initially, he supported Adolf Hitler and his policies, but in 1942, Stauffenberg joined the military opposition because of mass terror and military mistakes of the high command. According to him, Hitler led Germany to disaster. Since the spring of 1944, he, along with a small circle of comrades, planned an attempt on the Fuhrer. Of all the conspirators, only Colonel Stauffenberg had the opportunity to approach Adolf Hitler. He was appointed 1944 in June as chief of staff of the reserve army, which was located on Bendlerstrasse in Berlin. As the reserve army chief of staff, Stauffenberg could participate in military meetings, both at Adolf Hitler’s wolf lair in East Prussia and at the Berghof residence near Berchtesgaden.\n\nVon Treskov and his subordinate, Major Joachim Kun (a military engineer by training), prepared homemade bombs for the assassination attempt. At the same time, the conspirators established contacts with the commander of the occupying forces in France, General Carl-Heinrich von Stülpnagel. After the liquidation of Hitler, he had to take all the power in France into his own hands and begin negotiations with the British and Americans.\n\nOn July 6, Colonel Stauffenberg delivered an explosive device to the Berghof, but the attempt did not occur. On July 11, the reserve army chief of staff attended a meeting at the Berghof with a British-made bomb, but did not activate it. Earlier, the rebels decided that together with the Führer it was necessary to simultaneously destroy Hermann Goering, who was the official successor of Hitler, and the SS Reichsführer Heinrich Himmler, and both of them were not present at this meeting. In the evening, Stauffenberg met with the leaders of the conspiracy Olbricht and Beck and convinced them that the next time an explosion should be arranged regardless of whether Himmler and Goering were involved.\n\nOn July 15, another assassination attempt was scheduled. Stauffenberg participated in a meeting at the Wolfschanger. Two hours before the beginning of the meeting at the headquarters, the deputy commander of the reserve army, Olbricht, ordered the beginning of the implementation of the Valkyrie plan and the advancement of troops in the direction of the government quarter on Wilhelmstrasse. Stauffenberg made a report and went out to talk on the phone with Friedrich Olbricht. However, when he returned, the Führer had already left the bid. The colonel had to notify Olbricht about the failure of the attempt, and he managed to cancel the order and return the troops to the places of deployment.\n\nFailure of attempt\n\nOn July 20, Count Stauffenberg and his orderly lieutenant Werner von Gefeten arrived at the Wolf's Lair Headquarters with two explosive devices in their suitcases. Stauffenberg had to activate the charges just before the assassination. Stauffenberg was summoned by the General Headquarters of the Wehrmacht High Command Wilhelm Keitel. The colonel was to report on the formation of new units for the Eastern Front. Keitel told Stauffenberg an unpleasant news: because of the heat, the military council was transferred from a bunker on the surface to a light wooden house. An explosion in a closed underground room would be more effective. The meeting was supposed to start at half past twelve.\n\nStauffenberg asked for permission after the road to change his shirt. Keitel's adjutant, Ernst von Freyend, took him to a dormitory. There the conspirator began to urgently prepare fuses. It was difficult to do this with one left hand with three fingers (in April 1943 in North Africa during an English raid aviation he was seriously wounded, he was shell-shocked, Stauffenberg lost his eye and his right hand). The colonel was able to prepare and put only one bomb in his briefcase. Freyand entered the room and said that he had to hurry. The second explosive device was left without a detonator - instead of 2 kg of explosives, only one remained at the disposal of the officer. He had 15 minutes before the explosion.\n\nKeitel and Stauffenberg entered the house when the military meeting had already begun. The 23 man was present, most were sitting at a massive oak table. The colonel sat down on Hitler’s right. While they were reporting on the situation on the Eastern Front, the conspirator put a briefcase with an explosive device on the table closer to Hitler and left X.NUMX minutes before the explosion. He had to support the next steps of the rebels, and therefore did not stay in the room.\n\nA lucky chance and this time saved Hitler: one of the meeting participants put a briefcase under the table. In 12.42 thundered explosion. Four people were killed, others were injured. Hitler was contused, received several minor shrapnel wounds and burns, his right arm was temporarily paralyzed. Stauffenberg saw the explosion and was sure that Hitler was dead. He was able to leave the cordon area until it was closed.\n\nThe location of the meeting at the time of the explosion.\n\nIn 13: 15 Stauffenberg flew to Berlin. Two and a half hours later, the plane landed at Rangsdorf airport, where they were to be met. Stauffenberg learns that the conspirators, because of the inconsistency of information received from the rate, do nothing. He informs Olbricht that the Führer has been killed. Only then Olbricht went to the commander of the army reserve F. Fromm, so that he agreed to the implementation of the plan \"Valkyrie\". Fromm decided to verify for himself the death of Hitler himself and called Stake (all the communication lines were not blocked by the conspirators). Keitel informed him that the attempt had failed, Hitler was alive. Therefore, Fromm refused to participate in the rebellion. At this time, Klaus Stauffenberg and Werner Geften arrived at the building on Bendler Street. The clock was 16: 30, almost four hours had passed since the assassination, and the rebels had not yet begun implementing the plan to seize control in the Third Reich. All the conspirators were indecisive, and then Colonel Stauffenberg took the initiative.\n\nStauffenberg, Geften, along with Beck went to Fromm and demanded to sign the plan \"Valkyrie\". Fromm again refused, he was arrested. The commander of the reserve army was Colonel-General Göpner. Stauffenberg sat on the phone and urged the commanders of the formations that Hitler had died and called for the instructions of the new command to be fulfilled - Colonel General Beck and Field Marshal Vitzleben. In Vienna, Prague and Paris began the implementation of the plan \"Valkyrie\". It was especially successful in France, where General Stülpnagel arrested the entire top leadership of the SS, the SD and the Gestapo. However, this was the last success of the conspirators. The rebels lost a lot of time, acted uncertainly, erratically. The conspirators did not take control of the Ministry of Propaganda, the imperial office, the headquarters of imperial security and the radio station. Hitler was alive, many knew about it. Supporters of the Führer acted more decisively, while the wavering stayed away from the insurgency.\n\nAt about six o'clock in the evening, the Berlin military commander of Gaza received a telephone message from Stauffenberg and summoned the commander of the Great Germany protection battalion, Major Otto-Ernst Remer. The commandant informed him about the death of Hitler and ordered him to put the unit on alert, cordon off the government quarter. During the conversation, a party functionary was present, he convinced Major Remer to contact Goebbels, the Minister of Propaganda, and to coordinate his instructions with him. Joseph Goebbels established contact with the Führer, and he gave the order to the major: crush the insurrection at any cost (Remer was promoted to colonel). By eight in the evening, the Rehmer's soldiers controlled the main government buildings in Berlin. In 22: 40, the headquarters security on Bendler Street was disarmed, and the officers of Remer arrested von Stauffenberg, his brother Berthold, Hefeten, Beck, Göpner and other rebels. The conspirators were defeated.\n\nFromm was released and to hide his participation in the conspiracy, he organized a meeting of the military court, who immediately sentenced five people to death. An exception was made only for Beck, he was allowed to commit suicide. However, two bullets in the head did not kill him and finished off the general. Four rebels — General Friedrich Olbricht, Lieutenant Werner Heuften, Klaus von Stauffenberg, and the head of the general department of the Merz von Quiernheim Army Headquarters — were taken out one by one into the courtyard of the headquarters and shot to death. Before the last volley, Colonel Stauffenberg managed to shout: \"Long live holy Germany!\".\n\n21 July G. Himmler established a special commission of four hundred senior SS officials to investigate the \"20 Conspiracy July\", and throughout the Third Reich arrests, torture, and executions began. In the case of the \"Conspiracy 20 July\" more than 7 thousand people were arrested, about two hundred were executed. Even the corpses of the main conspirators Hitler \"avenged\": the bodies were dug out and burned, the ashes scattered.\n\nAlexander Samsonov"
