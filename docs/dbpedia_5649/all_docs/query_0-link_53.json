        "text": "Lightning Strike\n\nMembers of a Strosstrupp or raiding party were recruited from the ranks of active military and the Abwehr, former members of the Stahlen WW I veterans group, student and labor leaders. By mid-September, 1938, 56 hardline anti-Nazis had signed on, were given arms and explosives, and installed in safe houses throughout Berlin. Their assignment: to lead a direct attack on the chancellery, blow off entry doors if need be, remove the 12 to 15 SS who guarded the main entrance to the building and the entrance to Hitler’s quarters and patrolled the corridors and grounds as directed by Gen. Erwin von Witzleben, the commander of the military district of Berlin, Wehrkreis III, and Maj. Friedrich Wilhelm Heinz.\n\nMore than men and materiel were needed. The coup plan also called for the coordinated movement of troops and police to tamp down the expected violent response from the Gestapo and SS by rounding up Nazi leaders ahead of or at the time of the attack and securing the city of Berlin.\n\nKey locations were identified: The war ministry and other ministries, the main radio transmitter and radio stations, Gestapo headquarters, police and SS installations. As soon as the raiding party made its move, two senior military commanders would direct their divisions to target and occupy each location, arrest and detain all SS and Gestapo: Walter von Brockdorff-Ahlefeldt of the 23rd Infantry Division and Paul von Hase of the 50th Infantry Division.\n\nA third, Erich Hoepner, would position the 1st Light Division across the road leading to Berlin from Munich to stop Hitler’s bodyguards in the SS Panzer Division Leibstandarte from entering the city.\n\nPolice units also had to be restrained from taking action against the army divisions once the coup became operational or, perhaps, encouraged to join the conspirators. The liaison to the police was Hans Gisevius, a former officer in the Gestapo and employee of the Ministry of the Interior. With the help of Arthur Nebe, a police officer who had access to some of the Gestapo’s secret files and reports, and Wolf von Helldorf, Berlin chief of police, Gisevius obtained the addresses of police stations in Berlin, some of which were housed in private homes. (To Kill the Devil)\n\nMore than Wishful Thinking\n\nThe conspirators gradually put meat on the bare bones of the coup plot. Gisevius and Brockdorff scoped out the targeted locations, careful not to catch the eyes or ears of the Gestapo. Posing as tourists, they rode up and down streets of Berlin driven by a woman whose husband was director of an insurance company and no friend of Hitler.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Oster-Conspiracy-1938-Military-Hitler/dp/0060955252\n\nThe Purge\n\nOn January 27, 1938, 59-year-old Werner von Blomberg resigned from his position as War Minister and Commander-in-Chief of the German Armed Forces because of allegations about his new wife. Little more than two weeks before, Blomberg had married Margarethe Gruhn in a civil ceremony attended by Hitler himself and Luftwaffe Chief Hermann Göring. Under pressure from Hitler, Blomberg claimed he was retiring for “reasons of health” when in fact he sought to quash revelations about his wife’s criminal record for prostitution and a file of pornographic photographs, information obtained and passed along by Göring.\n\nArmy Commander-in-Chief General Barron Werner Freiherr von Fritsch was next. Hitler resurrected evidence of Fritsch’s homosexuality, evidence he had seen and rejected as wholly fabricated in 1936, and asked Göring to preside over a special court to investigate the charges. Fritsch resigned his post four days later on January 30, 1938.\n\nOn February 4, Hitler decided to “exercise personally the immediate command over the whole armed forces,” assuming Blomberg’s position as war minister, handpicking the successor to Fritsch’s position as commander-in-chief of the army, relieving 16 senior generals of their commands, and transferring 45 high-ranking officers, thereby replacing generals who were loath to go to war and reluctant to adhere to his will with “men of brutality,” men who thought the same way he did. (Roger Moorhouse: Killing Hitler)\n\nMilitary Unrest\n\nThese sudden and shocking upper echelon changes built on disturbing undercurrents that were raising alarm among many of the German military.\n\nHitler had steadily enhanced the status of the armed forces by pointedly ignoring precepts of the Versailles Treaty that held the German military in check. Beginning in 1935, he enabled army expansion by allowing the reinstitution of conscription, remilitarized the Rhineland, blew past the limits that had been imposed by the treaty on the size of the military, increased funding and personnel, and modernized equipment. (Killing Hitler)\n\nWhile many military leaders as well as the rank and file welcomed these moves, some were becoming concerned about the shift in the seat of their power.\n\nBeginning on August 20, 1934, members of the armed services and civil servants were no longer required to take an oath to serve their country or its constitution. They now had to swear allegiance to a single man: to “render unconditional obedience to the Führer of the German Reich and people, Adolf Hitler…and be ready at any time to stake my life for this oath.” (Killing Hitler)\n\nMilitary leaders who did not toe the line were put at risk. The Night of the Long Knives, which eliminated Ernst Röhm and most of the other Brownshirts (see the previous Historka post), also targeted General Kurt von Schleicher, chancellor of the Weimar Republic, who was gunned down in his villa near Potsdam, and his associate, head of the Abwehr military intelligence unit Ferdinand von Bredow for criticizing Hitler and his cabinet.\n\nMost disturbing was Hitler’s push for war.\n\nRun-up to War\n\nOn March 12, 1938, Hitler rode in one of a cavalcade of Mercedes automobiles across the German border into Austria as a “liberator,” making his homeland a province within the German Reich and absorbing its military into the Wehrmacht, thus violating one of the most uniformly despised clauses of the Versailles Treaty by Germans—Anschluss, unification of Austria and Germany.\n\nA month later, Hitler ordered the Wehrmacht’s General Staff to formulate a plan for a preemptive attack on neighboring Czechoslovakia, the first step in his vision for a “German Empire which would include Poland, Ukraine, Baltic States, Scandinavia, Holland, Flemish Belgium, Luxembourg, Burgundy, Alsace-Lorraine, and Switzerland.” (Herbert Molloy Mason, Jr., To Kill the Devil)\n\nThe plan was considered to be disastrous for the country because of the status of Germany’s war machine—the military and defense industry were relatively weak and unprepared—the central location of the country, which opened it up to attacks on land, sea, and in the air, and the likelihood of provoking formidable enemies--Russia, France, Britain, and eventually the US.\n\nHitler nonetheless insisted: “It is my unalterable decision to smash Czechoslovakia in the near future.” (To Kill the Devil)\n\nIn the summer months, propaganda reported on the so-called atrocities committed by Czechs on Germans living in Sudetenland. The Sudeten Nazi Party led demonstrations and other actions in Sudetenland to disrupt the Czech government’s operations. Maneuvers were held in Franconia, near the Czech border, the infantry trained soldiers in methods of storming the type of fortifications maintained by Czechoslovakia, and throughout the country citizens were learning civil defense. (James P. Duffy and Vincent L. Ricci , Target Hitler)\n\nPreparations accelerated in September: tanks and infantry divisions practiced firing on concrete bunkers similar to the ones Czechoslovakia maintained on its border. Concrete “dragon’s teeth” were being constructed, tank traps were being dug, and machine guns were being mounted along German’s West Wall or the Siegfried Line.\n\nHitler set the deadline for an attack on Czechoslovakia—no later than October 2. (John Grehan, Assassination Attempts)\n\nThe Men\n\nKey Plotters\n\nAbwehr’s organized effort to remove Adolf Hitler from leadership was called The Oster Plan or the Oster Conspiracy. (See the next Historka for details.) Several men in- and outside the military were instrumental:\n\nSturmabteilung (en-academic.com)\n\nThe SA\n\nThe SA grew from the ranks of unemployed WW I veterans or Freikorps (Free Corps), independent and volunteer paramilitary units, who were attracted to the Nazi movement because of their opposition to the groups they believed were responsible for Germany’s defeat—government officials who had capitulated by signing the Versailles Treaty, the so-called November Criminals, as well as Communists, Jews and Social Democrats who profited from the war, betrayed the German Army, and as a result “stabbed the country in the back.” (Christopher Ailsby, The Third Reich Day by Day), p 14).\n\nTheir purpose: to maintain order during meetings of the Nazi Party and disrupt those held by other political parties, thereby, as Hitler said, “ruthlessly prevent—if necessary by force—all meetings or lectures that are likely to distract the minds of our fellow countrymen.” (William Shirer, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, p 43.)\n\nThe SA played prominent roles in a number of high-profile events in the early days of the Nazi movement:\n\n· The German Day folk festival on October 14 and 15, 1922. Hitler and 800 SA marched through Coburg and for the first time gained active support for the Nazi movement from people in attendance. (The Rise and Fall of Third Reich)\n\n· The First Nazi Party Day from January 27 to 29, 1923. Members of SA for the first time publicly unveiled and flew the swastika flag in Munich. (Christopher Ailsby, The Third Reich Day by Day)\n\nMunich Putsch on November 8 and 9, 1923. Hundreds of SA surrounded the beer hall while Hitler and 20 of their men rushed inside and overtook a meeting of Bavarian government officials while Hitler announced “The National Revolution has begun.” After holding Bavarian government officials overnight, Hitler and nearly 3000 Stormtroopers marched toward the center of town, where they were stopped by police and arrested.\n\n(Because of the failed putsch, Hitler was tried and convicted of high treason, and the Nazi Party and its enforcers, the SA, were disbanded, at least temporarily.)\n\nMembership in the SA increased markedly after the Great Depression threw many men out of work. From meager beginnings (SA membership totaled about 3000 in 1923), the organization grew steadily. Even though it was still considered to be illegal and called by another name—Frontbann—SA had 30,000 members in 1924. By 1930-31, 50,000 men were members, and in 1933-34, SA had between 2 and 4 million in its ranks. (The Third Reich Day by Day)\n\nFalling Out\n\nOne man was responsible for the early growth and militarization of the SA: Ernest Röhm. After fighting for the Imperial German Army in WW I and receiving the Iron Cross for his wartime service, Röhm remained in the military and rose to the rank of captain. He joined the German Workers’ Party in 1919 and transformed Hitler’s so-called Ordnertrupe strong-arm guards into Brownshirts who were known not only for disrupting political meetings and speeches but for street violence against Jews and opponents of the Nazi party in the early 1920s. Because of his participation in the Munich Beer Hall Putsch, Röhm was tried and found guilty of treason. After receiving a suspended sentence for the crime, he was dismissed from the army and served as a Reichstag deputy. (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernst_R%C3%B6hm#:~:text=After%20a%20stint%20as%20a,advisor%20to%20the%20Bolivian%20Army, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, The Third Reich Day by Day)\n\nRöhm and Hitler had very different ideas about the role of the SA. From the first, Hitler viewed Stormtroopers as a political organization, one that would stir up enthusiasm for the Nazi Party among its own ranks and strike fear in the minds of those in other political parties. Röhm wanted the SA to be a revolutionary or people’s army that replaced old-guard Prussian generals with now seasoned Brownshirts and coalesced all military leadership—the armed forces, SA, and the elite SS--under his control. (The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich)\n\nFake News\n\nOther Nazis were growing weary of Röhm’s ambitions. Heinrich Himmler, his second-in-command Reinhard Heydrich, and Hermann Goring as well as the German Army pushed for a purge of the SA and the elimination of Röhm himself. The plan was to convince Hitler that Rohm was planning a putsch against the army and Hitler’s nascent government in 1934. Letters stating that Röhm was ordering the SA to arm itself in preparation for an attack on military headquarters were forged by Heydrich’s men. Telephone calls warning Hitler of an SA uprising in Berlin bombarded his hotel room in Essen. Over a full day and night reports told of an escalating situation: “armed bands of SA are marching through the streets of Berlin…the putsch will erupt all across Germany at 4 p.m. sharp…Rohm has set the machinery in motion for Hitler’s ouster.” (Herbert Molloy Mason, Jr., To Kill the Devil, p 9)\n\nThis “threatening intelligence” was highly exaggerated if not wholly fictional. Urgent messages told that an alarm muster had been ordered for 4:00 pm and a surprise attack leading to full occupation of government buildings in Berlin would follow within the hour, and in Munich SA had already been ordered to assemble in revolt. (The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich)\n\nIn reality, SA was on holiday. Hitler had told the SA to take a month off from its duties, and Rohm took sick leave, moving to a hotel in the resort area of Wiesse outside of Munich. (The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich)\n\nYet Hitler and the SS acted precipitously to stop Röhm and his minions.\n\nThe Night of the Long Knives\n\nBeginning at 4:00 am on Saturday, June 30, 1934, leaders of the SA in Munich were arrested and taken to the Ministry of the Interior. SA in nearby Wiessee were dragged from their hotel rooms, hustled outdoors, and shot to death. Göring and Himmler rounded up 150 SA, stood them against the wall of a school, and executed them by firing squad in Berlin. Röhm himself was escorted to Stadelheim prison in Munich, presented with a pistol so he could take his own life if he chose, and then shot to death when he refused. (To Kill the Devil, The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich)\n\nOnly two actual attempts on Hitler’s life were made by the SA. One was half-hearted. A man wearing an SA uniform was arrested at Hitler’s Berghof residence carrying a gun he said would be used for assassination in 1933. The other was in response to Röhm’s arrest during the Night of the Long Knives. Hitler confronted a band of SA bodyguards as he was returning to Munich from the prison where Röhm was being held and convinced them to shoulder their weapons. Realizing their mistake, the SA bodyguards regrouped, setting up machine guns on both sides of the road to Munich. Hitler and his driver backtracked, however, and took a different route, one that bypassed the Stormtroopers as they lay in wait.\n\nMystery surrounds another assassination attempt. One of Hitler’s personal bodyguards, SA member Heinrich Grunow, proposed picking off Adolf Hitler with a rifle shot as he traveled to his weekend retreat at the Berghof in 1936. Grunow even reported that he had fired off two shots, saw Hitler “screaming and clawing in the air” in the passenger seat, then fired again before turning the gun on himself and pulling the trigger. While Grunow did threaten Hitler’s life in 1939, he was arrested, imprisoned, and died in Sachenhausen concentration camp in 1945. (John Grehan, The Hitler Assassination Attempts)\n\nThere are conflicting reports about Hitler’s travels to the Berghof in 1936, however. Reichsführer-SS Julius Schreck, Hitler’s chauffeur, died suddenly in May of that year. Two days after his death, officials listed the cause of death as an infected tooth. Another report claimed his death was caused by meningitis. Later reports, including those from Humanitas International and the University of North Carolina’s D. H. Ramsey Library, state that Schreck was involved in an auto accident and died from his injuries. A Chicago newspaper article stated that Schreck and Hitler were traveling by car to the town of Bernau when shots were fired, and the man in the passenger seat was killed. That man was thought to be Julius Schreck, and Hitler, as the driver, escaped death. (The Hitler Assassination Attempts)\n\nSources:\n\nChristopher Ailsby: The Third Reich Day by Day, Chartwell Books, 2011.\n\nJohn Grehan: The Hitler Assassination Attempts, Frontline Books, 2022.\n\nHerbert Molloy Mason, Jr.: To Kill the Devil, George J. McLeod Ltd., 1978.\n\nWilliam Shirer: The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, MJF Books, 1960.\n\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/hitlers/3226959811/\n\nHitler’s retreat since 1926, the Berghof was in the Austrian mountains 70 miles from Munich and 16 miles from Salzburg. The estate grew steadily to encompass barracks and an SS guardroom, residences for Nazi leaders such as Martin Bormann, Hermann Göring, and Albert Speer, a small farm, hotel, and theater plus an underground system of bunkers. It was surrounded by chain-link fences and barbed wire as well as gates manned by Reichssichrheitsdienst (RSD) and SS escorts, but overall security was questionable. The large numbers of guards and workers increased the chances for an enemy agent or assassin to gain access disguised as one of them. (Peter Hoffman, Hitler’s Personal Security).\n\nA 19-man team of RSD guards was installed in 1942-3, with the men making regular patrols in front of the main building and surrounding area. Another 16-man RSD unit served as guards at outer checkpoints and allowed access only to those with official visitors’ passes. (Hitler’s Personal Security, p 189). The property had anti-aircraft batteries, and regular five-minute readiness checks were conducted beginning in 1944 (Hitler’s Personal Security, p 196).\n\nThe Berghof nevertheless was the chosen site for FOXLEY. For one thing, Hitler maintained a fairly regular schedule at the retreat. He routinely took a walk between 10 and 11 from his residence through the woods to a teahouse on the grounds, and he walked alone or with a friend or colleague rather than a guard. While SS monitored him, their patrols followed only at a distance. Sentries also tracked his movements, but from 500 yards or more away from his path. (John Grehan, The Hitler Assassination Attempts).\n\nAs its first line of attack, FOXLEY proposed a sniper attack from a vantage point 100 to 200 yards away from Hitler as he took his daily walk. However, the perimeter of the grounds was not only enclosed by chain link and barbed wire, it was patrolled by guards and guard dogs minutes before the start of Hitler’s walk. If the sniper was not able to get into position in time or otherwise not able to carry out the mission, FOXLEY envisioned a two-man team firing on the Führer when he returned from the teahouse to the Berghof by car.\n\nAn aerial attack on the property itself was another option. FOXLEY envisioned an RAF sortie that bombed the residence and other buildings, especially those housing SS, followed by landing a parachute battalion of 800 men to overcome the approximately 300 SS and other German troops on site.\n\nAttention shifted to Hitler’s travels between the Berghof and Berlin where trains were under less surveillance than they were in the occupied countries. According to FOXLEY planners, “signal boxes are not guarded as a rule… Guards at bridges and tunnels are said to consist of only two men and to be very slack in performing their duties.” (The Hitler Assassination Attempts, p 214). FOXLEY therefore surmised that a “sabotage party” could be disguised as train guards so as not to arouse suspicion. The sabotage party could then plant explosives in one of the tunnels near Salzburg or Stuttgart. Hitler’s train might also be derailed by diverting his train onto a siding where it would crash off the rails, or an operative might be able to toss a suitcase full of explosives under the train as it rolled by. The inability to get reliable advance information on Hitler’s movements ahead of time sidelined these FOXLEY options.\n\nOther FOXLEY thoughts explored the possibility of a sniper attack as Hitler stepped out of his auto and poisoning the water supply to his train. (The Hitler Assassination Attempts, p 218-220).\n\nIn the end, FOXLEY was abandoned. In 1944 and -45, Hitler’s misguided decisions involving the war effort and willingness to overrule sound advice from his own military leaders were “help[ing] the Allied cause enormously.” The focus therefore shifted to full defeat of the German military machine, Hitler’s eventual loss of power, and the perception of him as an object of ridicule.

Speculation abounds: Niepokólczycki could not reach the site to order detonation because streets had been closed. The officer in charge at the scene did not confirm Hitler was actually in the automobile until it had passed him by. Wiring leading to the explosives was faulty. With 12 high-ranking Polish government officials held hostage in the basement of City Hall, the risk was too great. (Killing Hitler, The Hitler Assassination Attempts)\n\nTrain Targets\n\nPerhaps because of the Polish underground’s history of successful disruptions of railways and transportation, assassination attempts involved Hitler’s train travels in 1941, -42 and -43.\n\nThis is not to say that train travel precautions were at all lax. So-called Special train cars were built expressly for Hitler’s use in 1937, -38, and -39 and were made entirely of welded steel. There were two versions of the Führersonderzug (Führer Special Train). The train used during times of peace or in peaceful settings had sleeping cars, a dining compartment, Pullman coach, personnel and press cars. The train used during times of conflict (known as Führerhauptquartier—Fuhrer’s Headquarters—and nicknamed Amerika) had an armored anti-aircraft car manned by a 26-member crew, a car for commandos, and conference car with teletype and communications center with a short-wave transmitter. (Peter Hoffman: Hitler’s Personal Security)\n\nTravel plans were kept secret until a few hours before departure, and advance units were established along the route to close crossing barriers and guard track lines. Onboard railway technicians checked for defects on rail lines as well as the train cars; train stations, platforms on both sides of the tracks, under- and overpasses were heavily guarded. Other trains were sidelined or their departures delayed until the Special train had left the upcoming station, freights or maintenance trains could not run on parallel tracks, and a dummy train typically preceded the Special train that actually transported Hitler. (Hitler’s Personal Security)\n\nAssassination Attempts\n\nDetachments of the Polish Home Army, AK, placed explosives on railroad tracks in West Prussia 20 to 30 minutes before any fast train was scheduled to pass by. The explosives were set to be detonated by a transmitter approximately 400 meters away. The train carrying Hitler did not arrive at the scheduled place and time in the autumn of 1941. It made an unscheduled stop at a nearby station and sat for 20 minutes while Hitler addressed Danish volunteers en route to the Eastern Front. The train that went ahead of the Führersonderzug did crash as a result of the detonations, and 430 of the German passengers were killed. (The Hitler Assassination Attempts)\n\nOn June 8, 1942, two AK teams learned that Hitler would be traveling across Poland to Berlin to attend the funeral of the head of Nazi-Occupied Czechoslovakia who had been killed by Czech partisans. Under the code name Wiener Blut (Viennese Blood), Lt. Jan Szalewski directed one of the teams to remove railroad tracks between Tczew and Chojnice and the other to secure the wooded area nearby.\n\nAfter the apparent dummy train passed by, the team removed the tracks and waited with their compatriots in the woods. When the train they assumed to be Führersonderzug derailed and ran down an embankment, the teams opened fire and killed 200 German soldiers as they fell from the train cars. Hitler was not among them. (Killing Hitler, The Hitler Assassination Attempts)\n\nThe deputy commander of the Zagra Lin arm of AK, Bernard Drzyzga, learned two days ahead of time that Hitler’s train would be passing through Bydgoszcz in May, 1943. Acting on his own because of the short time frame, he planted two explosive devices along a bend in the tracks and connected them by electric wire to a detonator. He waited along the tracks at the day and time the Führersonderzug was expected to arrive. The only train to pass by was a freight. (The Hitler Assassination Attempts)\n\nSources:\n\nhttps://www.historyhit.com/polands-underground-state-1939-90/\n\nhttps://warsawinstitute.org/phenomenon-polish-underground-state/\n\nGrehan, John: The Hitler Assassination Attempts, Frontline Books, 2022.\n\nMoorhouse, Roger: Killing Hitler, Bantam Books, 2006\n\nHoffman, Peter: Hitler’s Personal Security, Da Capo Press, 2000\n\nGerman Resistance Memorial Center - 7 Georg Elser and the Assassination Attempt of November 8, 1939 (gdw-berlin.de)\n\nThe target of the attack learned about the incident minutes later when his train stopped in Nuremburg. At about the same time, the perpetrator approached the Swiss border. He was stopped by German guards and turned over to the Gestapo almost immediately when a postcard of the Bürgerbäukeller, sketches of a bomb, and a fuse were found in his pockets.\n\nFive days later, the man confessed. He was Georg Elser, an ordinary German, a member of the working class expected to be a staunch supporter of the Nazi Party. Even more surprising, he had acted alone, meticulously and patiently putting the incendiary device together.\n\nThe Plan\n\nElser decided almost immediately that the beer hall would be the location for his assassination attempt. The speech came off every year at the same location like clockwork. The streets outside the beer hall were routinely barricaded, crowded, and afforded little chance of a good shot. And the beer hall itself was fairly easily accessible. When he visited in November, 1938, Elser noticed that the speaker’s platform was in front of a column supporting the upper gallery of the building and in the middle of the hall. “In the course of the next few weeks,” he reported in his confession, “I slowly worked it out in my head that it would be best to pack explosives into this particular pillar behind the speaker’s platform and then by means of some kind of device cause the explosives to ignite at the right time.” (Bombing Hitler, p 157)\n\nThe Bomb\n\nSince the summer of 1937, Elser had been working at the Waldenmaier armaments factory. Because of lax security, he was able to gather 250 compressed pellets of explosive powder, secreting each of the discs in sheets of paper and covering them with clothes in his locker. Realizing he needed more explosives as well as details about fashioning a detonator, he got a job at the Vollmer quarry in Itzelberg. Elser was able to pick up cans of explosives that had been left behind after blasts and “pay a visit” to the hut that served as a supply depot, easily filing down a key to fit the lock on the iron exterior door and yank open the unlocked wooden interior door. (Bombing Hitler, p 161, To Kill the Devil)\n\nElser trailed explosives experts at the quarry to learn their techniques and tested four devices in his parent’s orchard in the summer of 1939. The devices consisted of three blocks of explosives mounted on a board with a spring stretched across, a rifle shell as a firing cap, and a nail as the firing pin. He placed the materials, including 110 pounds of explosives, 125 high-capacity detonators, and quick-burning fuse, in the false bottom of his wooden suitcase and carried it with him when he moved to Munich in August, 1939. (To Kill the Devil)\n\nThe Placement\n\nElser began having dinner in the Bürgerbäukeller regularly. He sat at the same table served by the same waitress a little after 8:00 pm. He ate the cheapest meal, had a single beer, and left the table about 10:00 pm. He canvassed the hall by walking through the cloakroom. When he was sure no one was watching, he climbed the stairs to the gallery and hid in a storage space behind a folding screen.\n\nElser waited for the sound of the key turning in the lock between 10:30 and 11:30 pm, then quietly made his way along the gallery to the column that would be the backstop for Hitler’s speech on November 8. He first created a door close to the bottom of the column, then he chiseled out a chamber for the bomb using a hand drill with a chisel bit. He covered his tools with rags to minimize the noise and stopped making loud actions, such as chipping out portions of brick or masonry, until sounds from outdoors could camouflage them. He worked for several hours each night, then dozed until morning when he walked out of the beer hall soon after it opened between 7:00 and 8:00 am.\n\nHe spent three to four hours a night over the course of about a month to hollow out the pillar, insert the bomb, and set the timing device, each time sweeping up dust and debris, hiding the detritus in a storage room on the gallery until he could return with a suitcase to remove any signs of his work. He loaded explosives, made corrections to his ignition device, added wire and started the clock on November 5, setting the timer to detonate the charge 63 hours and 20 minutes later. (Bombing Hitler, To Kill the Devil)\n\nThe Man\n\nElser was born in January, 1903, in a small village in southwest Germany, a region known for the manufacture and sale of cuckoo clocks. After working briefly for his father, he apprenticed as a lathe operator in a smelter at age 14 and soon left because of health issues. He switched to woodworking, graduating at the top of his class from the Heidenheim trade school eight years later. He then worked in a furniture factory, a factory that made aircraft propellers, and as a carpenter building desks. He also worked for a brief time at a clock factory.\n\nThe church described as a 'symbol of evil' - BBC News\n\nBefore the newly elected members of the Reichstag would reconvene in Kroll Opera House, Berlin, Hitler and Joseph Goebbels organized speeches, religious services, parades, and memorials in an event known as Potsdam Day. The city of Potsdam was selected for the ceremony because it had been the seat of Frederick the Great’s Prussian Kingdom as well as Otto von Bismarck’s German Empire. The date was chosen because Imperial Germany’s first Reichstag opened on March 21, 1871. In addition to Hitler and Hindenburg, dignitaries also included Crown Prince Wilhelm of the Hohenzollern dynasty and three of his brothers. (Potsdam Day-- Wikipedia)\n\nInvestigators did find that the tunnel “seen” by the medium was, indeed, being dug. But instead of being loaded with explosives, the tunnel was lined with cables so the Potsdam Day proceedings could be broadcast live over the radio. (Hoffmann: Hitler’s Personal Security, page 25)\n\nPolice intervened to eliminate two more serious bomb threats associated with Potsdam Day. The day before the event, Himmler reported that three Checkists had driven to the Richard Wagner memorial in Tiergartenstrasse, Munich, carrying bombs that would be set off as Hitler passed by on the way from the Potsdam festivities to the new Reichstag in Berlin. The men were spotted and arrested before they could plant and arm the devices, however. According to Himmler, “The authorities saw in every attempt of this kind the grave danger to public order and security. From his own knowledge of the public mood and from reports of subordinate officials, [Himmler] was convinced that the firing of the very first shot -- whether it hit the mark or not -- might lead to unequalled chaos throughout Germany and to a great programme which no power of the state or the police would be able to prevent.” (Grehan: The Hitler Assassination Attempts, page 25)\n\nDays before Potsdam Day, Kurt Lutter, a ship’s carpenter and member of a small group of Communists, was arrested for planning to detonate the speaker’s platform while Hitler was addressing a political rally in Konigsberg on March 4, 1933. On March 3, a police informer who had infiltrated the group notified authorities, and Lutter and others were rounded up and interrogated. When none of the plotters owned up to the plan, they all were released. (Grehan: The Hitler Assassination Attempts; James P. Duffy and Vincent L. Ricci: Target Hitler)\n\nTight Security vs. Loose Lips\n\nRoutine security measures foiled at least one potential assassin. Hitler regularly strolled up and down the hilly walking paths near his mountain retreat on the slopes of the Obersaltzberg mountain range, talking with compatriots as he crisscrossed over public hiking trails in the open countryside. Hitler’s bodyguards grew suspicious when they spotted a stranger in an SS uniform intently watching Hitler and his entourage. After stopping and searching the man, the security detail found a loaded gun and promptly arrested him. (James P. Duffy and Vincent L. Ricci: Target Hitler; Grehan: The Hitler Assassination Attempts)\n\nInformers sidelined other assassins. A school teacher in early 1933 told police that she had heard about a plan by Ludwig Assner, a member of the Bavarian State Parliament, to send a personal letter laced with poison to Hitler from France. On other occasions, Assner declared that he would not rest until he had shot Hitler or otherwise removed him from office. Assner’s plans were dismissed as extortion when he promised to desist if given a large sum of money. (Duffy and Ricci: Target; Grehan: The Hitler Assassination Attempts).\n\nAn elaborate plan to infiltrate the SS and gather information about Hitler’s movements was itself infiltrated by Gestapo in 1935. Led by industrialist Dr. Helmut Mylius, head of the Party of the Radical Middle Class and editor of a right-wing political and economics publication, and the retired Navy Captain Hermann Ehrhardt, 160 Radical Middle Class Party men supporters actually were able to join the SS according to plan. But the size of the group may have been its undoing. According to John Grehan, such a large group made its discovery almost inevitable, as some members of the group most likely fell into the “loose lips” category. As a result, the plan was discovered, and most of the men were arrested. Mylius himself was able to circumvent arrest by joining the army, as arranged by his friend Field Marshall Erich von Manstein. (Duffy and Ricci: Target; Grehan: The Hitler Assassination Attempts)\n\nPlans by another potential assassin were foiled not once, but twice. Josef “Beppo” Römer in 1934 was arrested after gaining entry to the Reich Chancellery. A former member of the Freikorps paramilitary group who sought revenge for Hitler’s purge of the ranks of the SA on the Night of the Long Knives (June and July, 1934 when Nazi Party members purged SA from its ranks) and later a Communist, Römer was imprisoned for his actions at Dachau concentration camp. After his release in 1939, Römer again plotted to eliminate Hitler (or, as he said, “cut off the snake’s head”). He may have flagged his own actions, however, by dropping incriminating information about his analysis of German military action and active resistance into wastebaskets. (Grehan, page 34). Römer was arrested and sentenced to death in 1942 and executed in 1944.\n\nA Cause Célèbre\n\nThe Stuttgart born and raised German Jew Helmut Hirsch was not able to enroll in a German university because of the Nuremberg Laws of 1935. He therefore traveled to Prague and entered the German Institute of Technology there. He soon joined the Black Front, an organization of former members of the Nazi Party and German expatriates who opposed Hitler and led underground activities.\n\nPeople, Places, and Events Behind the Headlines in History\n\nEarly Assassination Attempts on the Life of Adolf Hitler\n\nThe assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, head of Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia and second-in-command of the SS in 1942, was, to put it mildly, shocking, not because it was attempted but because it succeeded. (Heydrich’s assassination and its aftermath are subjects of this author’s historical novel The Pear Tree.)\n\nThe attack on Heydrich certainly was not the first attempt to assassinate a high-ranking member of the Third Reich, to be sure. Adolf Hitler had been a target of assassination from the very beginning of his rise to power. Months after he became leader of the then-fledgling Nazi Party in 1921, shots were fired at Hitler as he spoke to a crowd in a Munich beer hall. Several more attempts were made before the formation of the Third Reich with Hitler at its helm in 1933. This Historka post describes assassination attempts in the early 1920s and the historical and political setting in which they occurred.\n\nThe First Attack\n\nAdolf Hitler joined the German Workers Party, an organization said at the time to have “no assets except a cigar box in which to put contributions,” in 1919. (Ailsby: The Third Reich Day by Day, page 9) As member of the steering committee for the group, Hitler sought to multiply the party’s membership by adopting military garb and pageantry and the swastika emblem, which he considered to be “something akin to a blazing torch.” (Ailsby, page 10)\n\nFeeling the need to attract more attention, he relished the chance to confront his political enemies when social democrats and communists crashed a Nazi Party meeting in the Munich Hoffbräuhaus on November 4, 1921 (6 Assassination Attempts on Adolf Hitler | HISTORY). “The dance had not yet begun when my Stormtroopers, for so they were called from this day on, attacked like wolves. They flung themselves in packs of eight or 10 again and again on their enemies, and little by little actually began to thrash them out of the hall. After five minutes, I hardly saw one of them who was not covered with blood.” (Ailsby, page 10, Grehan, The Hitler Assassination Attempts, 2022, page 20)\n\nAfter Hitler had spoken for an hour and a half, a man jumped up on a chair and shouted, “Freedom,” setting off a melee as beer mugs crashed to the floor, chairs were overturned, and fistfights broke out. Twenty minutes later, two pistol shots were fired at the podium where Hitler had been standing. Members of the assembled Nazis and outsiders exchanged more shots while Hitler continued speaking. (Grehan, The Hitler Assassination Attempts, 2022, page 20).\n\nHitler later wrote that he welcomed the attack. “Then two pistol shots rang out and now a wild din of shouting broke out from all sides. One’s heart almost rejoiced at this spectacle which recalled memories of the war.” (Ailsby, page 10)\n\nDeutscher Tag, Coburg, 14./15. Oktober 1922 – Historisches Lexikon Bayerns (historisches-lexikon-bayerns.de)\n\nThe First Nazi Party Day\n\nThe first Nazi Party Day, the Parteitage, brought 5000 Brownshirts to Munich to hold 12 mass meetings on January 27-29, 1923. An initial ban and declaration of a state of emergency by city officials was lifted after Bavarian General Otto von Lossow declared “suppression of the National Socialist organization [was] unfortunate for security reasons (Ailsby, page 13). At this meeting Hitler declared the swastika would become the symbol of a new Germany and proclaimed that “Germany is awakening, the German freedom movement is on the march” (Ailsby, page 13-14).\n\nThe Beer Hall Putsch\n\nThe most prominent and remembered event in 1923 was the so-called Beer Hall Putsch.\n\nImpressed by Benito Mussolini’s ability to seize power in October, 1922, by means of the March on Rome, (see this author’s Time Stamp blog October, 2022), Hitler believed the Nazi Party could take over the German government by force in early 1923.\n\nDeteriorating economic conditions did threaten the stability of the Weimar Republic at the time. The government had defaulted on reparations as required by the Treaty of Versailles, leading French forces to occupy Germany’s industrial center, the Ruhr; hyperinflation and other effects of the Great Depression were rampant. Blame fell at the feet of government leaders who had signed the treaty as well as groups that had “stabbed the country in the back” during WW I, including Communists, Jews, social democrats, and war profiteers.\n\nHitler’s plan to overthrow the Bavarian government, set for November 9, 1923, began in Munich’s Bürgerbräukeller the day before while the appointed governor of Upper Bavaria, Gustav von Kahr, was making a speech. In the audience Adolf Hitler waited for 20 minutes until 25 of his armed Brownshirts burst into the hall. He then climbed onto a chair, first a shot into the ceiling, and claimed the national revolution had begun. “This hall is occupied by 600 armed men…. The Bavarian and Reich Governments have been removed and a provisional National Government formed. The army and police barracks have been occupied, troops and police are marching on the city under the swastika banner.” (Ailsby, page 15)\n\nKahr and other leaders of the Bavarian government, military and police were taken by gunpoint to a side room where Hitler tried to convince them to accept his leadership. The men refused to accede to the demands but were released when they agreed they would not stand in his way (Grehan, page 34). While fighting outside the building distracted Hitler and other leaders of the rebellion, German Army generals fled the hall and mobilized troops from outlying garrisons, and Kahr denounced the episode.\n\nNevertheless, on the morning of November 9, Hitler led 2000 men in a march toward the center of the city. By then, Brownshirts at the War Ministry were already surrounded, and police blocked streets. When police began firing, Hitler was pulled to the street and protected by his body guard and others until he could make his escape. Members of the crowd gave up their weapons and identified themselves to the police; coup plotters still on the scene were singled out and arrested; and 14 lay dead on the streets. The wounded included Hitler himself (a wrenched shoulder) and Hermann Göring (bullet wound to the groin). (Beer Hall Putsch | Facts, Summary, & Outcome | Britannica)\n\nThe German General State Commissar immediately disbanded the Brownshirts as well as the Nazi Party and imposed heavy fines on anyone working for the party. Leaders of the coup were arrested for treason, arraigned, and imprisoned. (Ailsby, page 20)\n\nFollowing the failed putsch, the Nazi Party entered what has been called the Kampfzeit or time of struggle when party members dropped from nearly 70,000 to less than 1,000. Nevertheless, some “old fighters” remained, and their message gained a wide audience. To Hitler, the putsch was major propaganda. “As though by an explosion, our ideas were hurled over the whole of Germany,” he said. (Ailsby, page 19)\n\n1932 Assassination Attempts\n\nIn the months leading up to the July, 1932 elections, four attempts were made on Hitler’s life. In January, Hitler and others became ill within an hour after dining at Hotel Kaiserhof in Berlin. Though poisoning was suspected, no arrests were made.\n\nA month later, Ludwig Assner, a member of the Bavarian State Parliament, sent a poisoned letter to Hitler from France. The letter was intercepted before it reached Hitler.\n\nIn March, shots were fired at the train that was carrying Hitler, Joseph Goebbels, and Wilhelm Frick (who later became Minister of the Interior in the Third Reich) from Munich to Weimar. No one was hurt.\n\nWhile traveling to Stralsund, Hitler’s car was nearly ambushed by a group of men waiting at the corner of a sharp turn in the road.
