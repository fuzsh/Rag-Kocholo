Job von Witzleben was born on August 4, 1916, in Copitz, Germany. He was a member of the von Witzleben noble family and a grand-nephew of Field Marshal Erwin von Witzleben. He joined the Nazi Party at 1935, and served in the Wehrmacht during World War II, being awarded the German Cross in Gold during 1943. He was then transferred to staff duty. His uncle, Field Marshal von Witzleben, had informed him of his intentions to remove Hitler from power, although he did not tell him of the plan to assassinate the latter. After 20 July 1944 and his uncle's execution, the younger Witzleben was relegated to the field once more. While in the besieged city of Koenigsberg, he was told that he is to be flown to Vienna and face a court-martial, that would probably result in execution. Witzleben contacted the Red Army via radio and defected to the Soviets. He was held in captivity for three years, before returning to East Germany to serve in the Barracked People's Police and later, in the National People's Army. He also joined the East German Communist Party, the SED. He reached the rank of a colonel, but was removed from his command post because the Stasi viewed his aristocratic background with suspicion. From 1958 until his retirement from the army at 1972, he served as a military historian in the Potsdam Institute. He worked as a film military consultant on several occasions. He died at 1999.
