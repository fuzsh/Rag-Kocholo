Lane, Frederic C., special issue, Journal of Economic History 29, no. 1 (1969): 5–12CrossRefGoogle Scholar. A number of items by Lane were reprinted in Lane, Profits from Power: Readings in Protection Rent and Violence-Controlling Enterprises (Albany, 1979); Lane appears to have had in mind this short “memo” (reprinted as chapter 5) when he expressed discomfort with calling all of the items “essays.” See Lane to William D. Eastman, 23 Mar. 1979, MS-0381, series 2, box 7, Frederic C. Lane Papers, John Hopkins University Libraries (hereafter Lane Papers). Worth noting also, in the same folder, are Lane's early extensive notes on the stadial theories of the German Historical School, notes that found their way into the important introduction of Profits from Power, 1–11. For further details on the controversy in Bloomington, see Lane, “Introductory Note,” in “The Tasks of Economic History,” 1–4. The title of the 1969 special issue of the Journal of Economic History was recycled in honor of Edwin F. Gay, who had entitled his inaugural lecture as first president of the Economic History Association “The Task of Economic History”; see supplement, Journal of Economic History 1, no. S1 (1941): 9–16; on Gay's lecture, see Sophus A. Reinert, “Historical Political Economy,” in The Palgrave Handbook of Political Economy, ed. Ivano Cardinale and Roberto Scazzieri (Basingstoke, 2018), 133–69. On Lane, see the biographical sketch by Reinhold C. Mueller, “Frederic C. Lane, 1900–1984: Un profilo, con bibliografia aggiornata,” Ateneo veneto 171 (1984): 269–75; for more detail on Lane as impresario of American economic history, see Giuliana Gemelli, “‘Leadership and Mind’: Frederic C. Lane as Cultural Entrepreneur and Diplomat,” Minerva 41, no. 2 (2003): 115–32; for Lane's thoughts on the origins of capitalism, see Bullard, Melissa Meriam, Epstein, S. R., Kohl, Benjamin G., and Stuard, Susan Mosher, “Where History and Theory Interact: Frederic C. Lane on the Emergence of Capitalism,” Speculum 79, no. 1 (2004): 88–119CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n3 Lane's interest in sociology long preceded, for example, the founding by Sylvia Thrupp in 1958 of the pathbreaking journal Comparative Studies in Society and History, in which Lane published. A copy of Talcott Parsons's doctoral thesis, “Der Kapitalismus bei Sombart und Max Weber,” is in box 1, HUGFP 42.8.2, Papers of Talcott Parsons, Early Papers, Harvard University Archives. Parsons taught in the Harvard economics department from 1927 until 1931, when a department of sociology was finally formed. On Parsons and Schumpeter, see Swedberg, Richard, “Schumpeter and Talcott Parsons,” Journal of Evolutionary Economics 25, no. 1 (2015): 215–22CrossRefGoogle Scholar. In his latter years, Parsons reminisced: “Another very important figure, for me, was the economic historian Edwin F. Gay. Gay had been trained in Germany. He got his doctorate with [Gustav] Schmoller in Berlin and he knew the background that I had been exposed to in Germany, whereas most of the Harvard economists hadn't the slightest idea of what that stuff was all about. And most of them, not knowing anything about it, knew it was bad!” See “A Seminar with Talcott Parsons at Brown University: ‘My Life and Work’ (in Two Parts), Saturday, March 10, 1973,” in “Talcott Parsons: Economic Sociologist of the 20th Century,” ed. Laurence S. Moss and Andrew Savchenko, special issue, American Journal of Economics and Sociology 65, no. 1 (2006): 1–58, quotation at 8.\n\n9 Jennifer Schuessler, “In History Departments, It's Up with Capitalism,” New York Times, 6 Apr. 2013. For a foundational example of this recent trend, see Sven Beckert and Christine Desan, eds., American Capitalism: New Histories (New York, 2018) and the historiographical tradition to which it speaks. For an insightful definitional discussion, see Nancy Fraser and Rahel Jaeggi, Capitalism: A Conversation in Critical Theory (Cambridge, U.K., 2018). The so-called new history of capitalism is only one strand in this story, but for an enlightening discussion of one of its predominant themes, see John J. Clegg, “Capitalism and Slavery,” Critical Historical Studies 2, no. 2 (2015): 281–304, 282n2 (which also identifies finance as the field's other main theme). For a more critical approach, see Eric Hilt, “Economic History, Historical Analysis, and the ‘New History’ of Capitalism,” Journal of Economic History 77, no. 2 (2017): 511–36. And for a broader picture, from a different and salutary perspective, see Walter A. Friedman, “Recent Trends in Business History Research: Capitalism, Democracy, and Innovation,” Enterprise & Society 18, no. 4 (2017): 748–71.\n\n17 Weber's reply to Rachfahl appeared in the Archiv für Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik 30 (1910): 176–202; it has since been translated by Austin Harrington and Mary Shields in David Chalcraft and Austin Harrington, eds., The Protestant Ethic Debate: Max Weber's Replies to His Critics, 1907–1910 (Liverpool, 2001), 61–88, quotations at 69, 73–74. Weber's thoughts on this controversy were partly incorporated in his revised edition of The Protestant Ethic (the edition translated into English by Parsons), especially in the famous footnote on Leon Battista Alberti, which also served as a response to Sombart (pp. 194–98). On the restitution of usury in medieval and Renaissance Italy, which remains a vibrant area of research, see the classic articles of Armando Sapori, “L'interesse del denaro a Firenze nel Trecento (dal un testamento di un usuraio),” in Studi di storia economica (secoli XIII, XIV, XV), 3rd ed., vol. 1 (Florence, 1955), 223–43; and Florence Edler de Roover, “Restitution in Renaissance Florence,” in Studi in onore di Armando Sapori, vol. 1 (Milan, 1957), 773–90, which is based on material in the Selfridge Collection of Medici business records at Baker Library; Giovanna Petti Balbi, “Fenomeni usurari e restituzioni: La situazione ligure (secoli XII–XIV),” Archivio storico italiano 169 (2011): 199–220; and Sylvie Duval, “L'argent des pauvres: L'institution de l’executor testamentorum et procurator pauperum à Pise entre 1350 et 1424,” Mélanges de l'École française de Rome – Moyen Âge 125, no. 1 (2013), https://doi.org/10.4000/mefrm.1157. For a larger legal-philosophical-theological background, see the important work of Lawrin Armstrong on usury and restitution, especially The Idea of a Moral Economy: Gerard of Siena on Usury, Restitution, and Prescription (Toronto, 2016).\n\n27 Brentano, “Handel und Kapitalismus,” 361, citing the Catholic theologian Franz Xaver von Funk, “Über die ökonomischen Anschauungen der mittelalterlichen Theologen: Beiträge zur Geschichte der Nationalökonomie,” Tübinger Zeitschrift für die gesamte Staatswissenschaft 25 (1869): 125–175, 151n1, in turn citing Antonino's Summa. For the original version of the quotation, see Sancti Antonini archiepiscopi Florentini ordinis praedicatorum Summa theologica in quattuor partes distributa, Pars seconda (Verona, 1740), facsimile reprint, ed. Pietro Ballerini (Graz, 1959), tit.1, cap.7, par.16, at col.99: “Pecunia ex se sola minime est lucrosa, nec valet seipsam multiplicare: sed ex industria mercantium fit per eorum negotiationes lucrosa.” The text quoted by Xaver and Brentano has “mercantiones” instead of “negotiationes” with minimal or no change of sense. The sentiments of Antonino, the sterility of money in itself and the value of merchants in producing both profit and socially useful goods, were already commonplace a century earlier. When Brentano was writing, the economic thought of Antonino and his contemporaries was becoming a more and more popular subject. See, for example, the work of Carl Ilgner, In S. Antonini Archiepiscopi Florentini sententias de Valore et de Pecunia Commentarius (Breslau, 1902). Raymond de Roover, who is discussed below, declared St. Antonino to be one of the “two great economic thinkers of the Middle Ages” in a small volume in a series overseen by Arthur H. Cole. De Roover, San Bernardino of Siena and Sant'Antonino of Florence: The Two Great Economic Thinkers of the Middle Ages, Kress Library of Business and Economics Publication No. 19 (Boston, 1967). In his recent dissertation, working from autograph manuscripts of the Summa held at the Convent of San Marco in Florence, Jason Brown has prepared a critical edition of Antonino's section “On merchants” (Summa 3.8.1, De merchatoribus et artificibus per modum predicationis). See Brown, “St Antonin of Florence on Justice in Buying and Selling Introduction, Critical Edition, and Translation” (PhD diss., University of Toronto, 2019), 304–18. On Antonino, see David S. Peterson, “Archbishop Antoninus: Florence and the Church in the Earlier Fifteenth Century” (PhD diss., Cornell University, 1985).\n\n29 For context, see Fredona and Reinert, “Harvard Research Center”; Barry E. C. Boothman, “A Theme Worthy of Epic Treatment: N. S. B. Gras and the Emergence of American Business History,” Journal of Marketing 21, no. 1 (2001): 61–73; and Gras, Development of Business History up to 1950: Selections from the Unpublished Work of Norman Scott Brien Gras, ed. Ethel C. Gras (Ann Arbor, 1962), 185–87. Gay and Gras clashed over the editorship of the short-lived HBS Journal of Economic and Business History, because of Gras's increasingly proselytic devotion to “business history” as a discipline distinct from economic history, but they also disagreed about stadial models in economic history. Already in 1907, Gay was very critical of Karl Bücher's stages of economic development, stressing that all generalizations must be approached with caution: “My attitude with regard to stages,” he said, “may perhaps be summed up in what Meredith somewhere says of a proverb. A proverb is like an inn; an excellent halting place for the night but a poor dwelling.” Gay, “Some Recent Theories Regarding the Stages of Economic Development,” and, responding to points raised by others at the 1906 meeting of the AEA, “Stages of Economic Development: A Discussion,” Publications of the American Economic Association 8, no. 1 (1907): 125–136, quotation at 136. Gras, on the other hand was deeply informed by the theory of stages. Henrietta Larson, Gras's protégée, who perhaps knew his vision for business history better than anyone, noted that Gras took “the early inspiration for his concept of economic stages” from “the theorist Von Thünen and the genetic economist Bücher,” though as he turned toward business history explicitly and away from economic history, it was the “writings of Werner Sombart and of George Unwin [that] made a deep impression on him.” Larson, “Business History: Retrospect and Prospect,” Bulletin of the Business Historical Society 21, no. 6 (1947): 173–99.\n\n31 Of Gras's sedentary/traveling merchant, Wallace K. Ferguson noted that the distinction “has since been generally accepted” in Renaissance economic history. Ferguson, “Recent Trends,” 17. Shortly after Gras's 1939 book Business and Capitalism came out, his protégée Florence Edler de Roover wrote Gras from Paris: “Your book should make the use of the differentiating terms, ‘petty capitalism,’ ‘mercantile capitalism,’ etc., common. . . . I can now classify my merchants better and fit them into the picture of mercantile capitalism. . . . Last summer we spent a good part of our evening with Marc Bloch trying to find French expressions for many of your business terms that are well expressed by one or two words in English, but have no short equivalents in French or Italian.” Edler de Roover to Gras, 13 Aug. 1939, box 1, Florence Edler de Roover Papers, University of Chicago Library. Frederic Lane's book Andrea Barbarigo, Merchant of Venice, 1418–1449 (Baltimore, 1944) was explicitly described as a study of a “sedentary merchant” in Gras's mold. Reinhold C. Mueller has also, more generally, noted the influence of Gras's business history group on Lane. See Mueller's entry “Lane, Frederic Chapin” in The Oxford Encyclopedia of Economic History, vol. 3, ed. Joel Mokyr (Oxford, 2003), 277–78. Raymond de Roover called attention to the “sedentary merchant,” expressly invoking Gras, throughout his chapter in The Cambridge Economic History of Europe and Robert S. Lopez, in his chapter, used the term some nine times. De Roover, “The Organization of Trade,” in The Cambridge Economic History of Europe, vol. 3, Economic Organisation and Policies in the Middle Ages, ed. M. M. Postan, E. E. Rich, and Edward Miller (Cambridge, U.K., 1963), 42–118, esp. 74; Lopez, “The Trade of Medieval Europe: The South,” in The Cambridge Economic History of Europe, vol. 2, Trade and Industry in the Middle Ages, ed. M. M. Postan and E. E. Rich, 2nd ed. (Cambridge, U.K., 1952), 306–401. De Roover, who received his HBS MBA in 1938 under Gras's guidance, dedicated his first book on the subject, The Medici Bank: Its Organization, Management, Operations, and Decline (New York, 1948), “to N. S. B. Gras, whose teaching inspired this study of one of the most famous business firms in history” (p. v; see also xiv). We are currently completing a biography of Florence Edler de Roover, which will address in detail the de Roovers’ debts to Gras. Not everyone, of course, was convinced about the “sedentary merchant”: Shepard B. Clough, for example, found “extravagant” Gras's claim “that economic history for the period 1200–1800 has to be rewritten because of his discovery of the sedentary merchant.” Clough, review of Business and Capitalism, by Gras, and Casebook in American Business History, by Gras and Larson, Political Science Quarterly 55, no. 2 (1940): 273–75.\n\n32 N. S. B. Gras, “Capitalism—Concepts and History,” Bulletin of the Business Historical Society 16, no. 2 (1942): 21–34, at 68; Raymond de Roover, “Discussion by Raymond de Roover,” Bulletin of the Business Historical Society 16, no. 2 (1942): 34–39. Of course, the idea of a “commercial revolution” was not new. Lane, for example, had published “Venetian Shipping during the Commercial Revolution,” American Historical Review 38, no. 2 (1933): 219–39, but this revolution occurred in the transition from the fifteenth to sixteenth century, or around then (p. 219). Ed Muir has described this article as “the earliest example of extensive research by an American in an Italian archive.” Muir, “The Italian Renaissance in America,” American Historical Review 100, no. 4 (1995): 1095–1118, 1106n45. De Roover expressly rejects a sixteenth-century “commercial revolution” in his discussion, in a section boldly titled “No Commercial Revolution in the Sixteenth Century” (p. 37), directed not at Lane but at those who associated this revolution with England's rise to prominence on the global commercial stage.\n\n34 Robert Lopez's The Commercial Revolution of the Middle Ages, 950–1350 was published by Prentice-Hall in 1971 and by Cambridge University Press in 1976 and subsequently reprinted many times. In 1945, when Lopez was hired by Yale University, he wrote Gras to thank him: “I think with both remorse and deep gratitude of the amount of letters you must have had to write on my behalf before my pilgrimage could end.” Lopez to Gras, 20 Nov. 1945, box 3, folder 2, Norman S. B. Gras Papers, Baker Library Special Collections, HBS (hereafter BLSC). Lopez's library contained a number of Gras's works, including at least one autographed offprint; see box 23, folder 13, Robert S. Lopez Collection, Arizona State University, Tempe. Unsurprisingly, Lopez himself favored the longue durée. As he wrote to Eric Cochrane upon hearing Cochrane had embarked on his Florence in the Forgotten Centuries, 1537–1800 (Chicago, 1973), “Best of luck on your history of Florence from 1530 on, a much needed job, for on the whole the history of Tuscany falls into the doldrums after 1530. . . . I am glad that at long last the Society for Italian Historical Studies faces up to the fact that the history of Italy begins somewhat before 1815, but even so, I think it would be bolder and more useful to give admission to the whole run of Italian history, from Neanderthal to Neanderthal (Mussolini). Surely there are problems that run through the history of the country.” Lopez to Cochrane, 15 Feb. 1963, MS 1459, series 1, box 3, folder 50, Robert Sabatino Lopez Papers, Yale University Archives (hereafter RSLP). For a very brief sketch of Lopez's career, see Archibald R. Lewis, Jaroslav Pelikan, and David Herlihy, “Robert Sabatino Lopez,” Speculum 63, no. 3 (1988): 763–65. Lopez's publications are listed in Harry A. Miskimin, David Herlihy, and A. L. Udovitch, The Medieval City: In Honor of Robert S. Lopez (New Haven, 1977), 329–34.\n\n43 Raymond de Roover to Jacob Viner, 15 June 1956, 1r, Jacob Viner Papers (MC #138), box 8, folder 12 (de Roover, Raymond, 1940–1967), Seeley G. Mudd Manuscript Library, Princeton, NJ (hereafter Viner Papers). The editio princeps of Cotrugli's Della mercatura et del mercante perfetto (Venice, 1573) to which de Roover refers actually includes a chapter entitled “Dell'huomo Economo,” rather than “economico,” but the shorthand economico for uomo economico appears repeatedly in the text (e.g., pp. 85–86). The recent critical edition based on the earliest known manuscript of 1475 (ms. 15, National Library of Malta, Valletta) and others refers to the chapter in question as “De lo yconomo” and uses the phrases “yconomo,” “homo yconomo,” “vivere yconomico,” and even “virtù icognomiche.” See Benedetto Cotrugli, Libro de l'arte de la mercatura, ed. Vera Ribaudo, with an introduction by Tiziano Zanato (Venice, 2016), 157, 162. The recent English edition conservatively translates the chapter title as “On Man as Administrator of His Household,” discussing “the administration of the life of a household” by an ideal “administrator.” See Benedetto Cotrugli, The Book of the Art of Trade, trans. John Francis Phillimore, ed. Carlo Carrraro and Giovanni Favero (Cham, Switzerland, 2017), 145–46. For Xenophon's work and the tradition it took part in, see Xenophon, Oeconomicus: A Social and Historical Commentary, ed. Sarah B. Pomeroy (Oxford, 1994). On the relationship between micro and macro in this tradition, see Sophus A. Reinert, “Authority and Expertise at the Origins of Macro-Economics,” in Antonio Serra and the Economics of Good Government, ed. Rosario Patalano and Sophus A. Reinert (Basingstoke, 2016), 119.\n\n50 Robert Sabatino Lopez to Gino Luzzatto, 22 Sept. 1947, 1r, MS 1459, series 1, box 7, folder 148, RSLP (translation ours). Lopez himself spoke of “Florentine capitalists” and was transparent in wishing to understand “the slow process by which the small, isolated, self-sufficient economies of the late Middle Ages evolved into the modern world economy”; see Lopez, “Small and Great Merchants in the Italian Cities of the Renaissance” (1931), in Lane and Riemersma, Enterprise and Secular Change, 4, 45. Over time, however, he came to feel more wary about such strong statements, admitting that “I have lost, by force of habit, the courage of making a generalization without many qualifications, a probable statement without the warning that it is a mere conjecture, a personal judgment without some hint that it may be wrong and it is open to challenge.” The cost, for Lopez, was ironically high even in terms of historical understanding, as “too many footnotes and ‘perhapses’”—for example, in a new biography of Benedetto Zaccaria, the Venetian “admiral, merchant, industrialist, writer, diplomat, crusader, [and] pirate”—would ultimately fail “to bring out the incredible maverick he was while the Middle Ages was at its peak.” See Lopez to Eric Cochrane, 17 Nov. 1978, MS 1459, series 1, box 3, folder 50, RSLP. A final irony, of course, is that Lopez gained fame not as a meticulous scholar but as a great generalizer, associated with major revisionist claims.\n\n52 Eric Cochrane and Julius Kirshner, “Deconstructing Lane's Venice,” review of Venice: A Maritime Republic, by Frederic C. Lane, Journal of Modern History 47, no. 2 (1975): 334, emphasis added. Albeit from a different ideological stance, Renzo Pecchioli made a similar and wider case about Venice and America in his Dal “mito” di Venezia all’“ideologia americana”: Itinerari e modelli della storiografia sul repubblicanesimo dell'età moderna (Venice, 1983). J. G. A. Pocock replied, noting that Pecchioli “describes [him], along with Hans Baron, William J. Bouwsma, and the late Frederic C. Lane, as conducting an offensive against Marxist historiography which must necessarily serve the interests of American ruling classes, and in which the thesis of a continuity of republican political values passing from Italy to England and the United States plays a leading part.” Pocock, “Between Gog and Magog: The Republican Thesis and the Ideologia Americana,” Journal of the History of Ideas 48, no. 2 (1987): 325; for further discussion of Lane and Cochrane and Kirshner's critique, see pp. 328, 332. See also Pocock's fascinating retrospective, “The Machiavellian Moment Revisited: A Study in History and Ideology,” Journal of Modern History 53, no. 1 (1981): 49–72, which discusses “Deconstructing Lane's Venice” on p. 55; at the time, Kirshner was one of the editors of the Journal of Modern History. For a different argument about the role of American ideology at work in Italian Renaissance historiography, see Anthony Molho, “The Italian Renaissance, Made in the USA,” in Imagined Histories: American Historians Interpret the Past, ed. Anthony Molho and Gordon S. Wood (Princeton, 1998), 263–94. We do not wish to judge here the merits of the Cochrane-Kirshner-Pecchioli criticisms of Lane, but the following should be noted: friends of Lane describe him as having been a “left liberal”; he firmly defended his Hopkins colleague Owen Lattimore against Joseph McCarthy's charge that he was a Soviet agent, writing that “[Lattimore] has not followed the Communist line . . . [and] I never had any reason to think him a Communist or to doubt his good faith and loyalty”; and, during his long tenure as editor of the Journal of Economic History, Lane regularly acted as an intermediary between, as it were, both sides of the Iron Curtain and had many productive contacts among Marxist historians.

For a critique, see Peregrine Horden and Nicholas Purcell, The Corrupting Sea: A Study of Mediterranean History (Oxford, 2000), 31–32. The debate over whether the “ancient economy” was “modern” or “primitive” continues unabated, but see, for powerful contrasting views, M. I. Finley, The Ancient Economy, with a foreword by Ian Morris (Berkeley, 1999); and Edward Cohen, Athenian Economy and Society: A Banking Perspective (Princeton, 1992). For one of the earliest salvos in the debate, see August Böckh, Die Staatshaushaltung der Athener, 4 vols. in 2 bks. (Berlin, 1817). The debate really took on a life of its own during the controversy between Eduard Meyer, a “modernist” who saw in Ancient Greece the womb of modern capitalism, and the “primitivist” Karl Bücher, who did not. See Paul Cartledge, “‘Trade and Politics’ Revisited: Archaic Greece,” in Trade in the Ancient Economy, ed. Peter Garnsey, Keith Hopkins, and C. R. Whittaker (Berkeley, 1983), 1–15, at 1.\n\n57 Keith Luria and Romulo Gandolfo, “Carlo Ginzburg: An Interview,” Radical History Review 35 (1986): 89–111, at 105. The phrase “totally forgotten and completely irrelevant to the present” appears in Edward Muir, “Introduction: Observing Trifles,” in Microhistory and the Lost Peoples of Europe, ed. Edward Muir and Guido Ruggiero (Baltimore, 1991), vii–xxviii, at xii. This is, of course, not the only way of writing a microhistory; Francesca Trivellato's self-described “global history on a small scale” is the most important example.

For other, very different studies that establish the global import of the small scale, see Paul Cheney, Cul-de-Sac: Patrimony, Capitalism, and Slavery in French Saint-Domingue (Chicago, 2017); and Michael Kwass, Contraband: Louis Mandrin and the Making of a Global Underground (Cambridge, MA, 2014). John Brewer has elegantly sketched some of the differences between different national microhistorical traditions, in “Microhistory and the Histories of Everyday Life,” Cultural and Social History 7, no. 1 (2010): 87–109.\n\n65 However, it may be best to separate the productivity of this heuristic from the ideologies and insecurities that brought it about. It was in their search for disciplinary purpose and pertinence, as Daniel Lord Smail shows, that medievalists over the last century have found in the European Middle Ages the “origins” of a wide range of phenomena with more or less unquestionable present-day relevance, including “civil society, the state, commerce and trade, banking, cities, individualism, universities, the modern nuclear family, scientific method, law and justice, human rights, citizenship, colonialism, fashion, and . . . even persecution.” Smail, “Genealogy, Ontogeny, and the Narrative Arc of Origins,” French Historical Studies 34, no. 1 (2011): 21–35, at 31–32, esp. 32n33. As Tim Carter and Richard Goldthwaite rightly observe, “All history is about continuity and change, and which dynamics gets emphasized depends on the objective of the historian.” Carter and Goldthwaite, Orpheus in the Marketplace: Jacopo Peri and the Economy of Late Renaissance Florence (Cambridge, MA, 2013), 348.\n\n67 Lane, “Economic Growth in Wallerstein's Social Systems,” 99. The review is largely even handed, as evident also in a letter from Goldthwaite to Lane: “I also want to thank you for the review of Wallerstein's book. I thought you were remarkably generous and restrained in your criticisms. Personally, the book enraged me, for its style, for its shoddy use of materials, for its simplistic schematicization of things. . . . I learned more from your review than I learned from the book”—to which Lane added the laconic marginal note “Problem of syntheses.” Goldthwaite to Lane, 9 Mar. 1977, 1v, series 2, box 6, Lane Papers. For Kuznets's definition, see Simon Kuznets, Economic Growth and Structure (London, 1965), 18; on this, see, among others, Robert William Fogel, Enid M. Fogel, Mark Guglielmo, and Nathaniel Grotte, Political Arithmetic: Simon Kuznets and the Empirical Tradition in Economics (Chicago, 2013). For a similar (though not explicit) emphasis on discovering the sources of growth rather than the definitions of “capitalism,” see Joel Mokyr, A Culture of Growth: The Origins of the Modern Economy (Princeton, 2016).\n\n68 Deirdre McCloskey, “‘You Know, Ernest, the Rich Are Different from You and Me’: A Comment on Clark's A Farewell to Alms,” European Review of Economic History 12, no. 2 (2008): 138–148, at 141. For overviews of these debates, see Peer Vries, The Escape from Poverty (Vienna, 2013); and Sophus A. Reinert, “The Great Divergence: Europe and Modern Economic Growth” (Harvard Business School Case 715-039, Boston, 2015). On the “Malthusian trap,” see Gregory Clark, A Farewell to Alms: A Brief Economic History of the World (Princeton, 2007), 19–40. For a critique of Clark, see Karl Gunnar Persson, “The Malthus Delusion,” European Review of Economic History 12, no. 2 (2008): 165–73. Note that even the causes and contexts of the Industrial Revolution remain uncertain. See, for example, recent salvos in the important and continuing debate about Allen's “high wage” thesis: Robert C. Allen, “Real Wages Once More: A Response to Judy Stephenson,” Economic History Review 72, no. 2 (2019): 738–54; Judy Z. Stephenson, “Mistaken Wages: The Cost of Labour in the Early Modern English Economy: A Reply to Robert C. Allen,” Economic History Review 72, no. 2 (2019): 755–69. Its world-changing importance, though, is undeniable.\n\n78 See also Bernard Harcourt's essential The Illusion of Free Markets: Punishment and the Myth of Natural Order (Cambridge, MA, 2011). As libertarian Peter T. Leeson has shown, after all, anarchy may be preferable to certain kinds of predatory regulatory regimes. See Leeson, “Better Off Stateless,” in Anarchy Unbound: Why Self-Governance Works Better Than You Think (Cambridge, U.K., 2014), 170–196, at 194. More specifically, the fact that similar but not identical import-substitution policies in Nigeria and South Korea in the 1960s had such incredibly divergent consequences for the respective countries suggests that it may be more enlightening to evaluate policies in their contexts than to pass judgment on policies as such. Compare, say, M. Daly, Development Planning in Nigeria (Ibadan, 1977), and Adejugbe, Michael Adebayo, “Industrialization, Distortions and Economic Development in Nigeria since 1950,” in Industrialization, Urbanization and Development in Nigeria: 1950–99, ed. Adejugbe, Michael Adebayo (Lagos, 2004), 325–54Google Scholar, esp. 334–35, to Alice H. Amsden, Asia's Next Giant: South Korea and Late Industrialization (Oxford, 1989)."
