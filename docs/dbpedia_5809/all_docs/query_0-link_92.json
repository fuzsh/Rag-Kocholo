        "text": "Courtney Love, born Courtney Michelle Harrison on July 9, 1964, is an American singer-songwriter and actress. Her life and career have been a rollercoaster ride of highs and lows, characterized by immense talent, controversy, personal struggles, and resilience. She's best known as the frontwoman of the alternative rock band Hole, which she formed in 1989. The band gained critical acclaim with albums like Live Through This and Celebrity Skin, establishing Love as a compelling and provocative figure in the world of rock music. Born in San Francisco, California, Love had a tumultuous childhood marked by familial discord and frequent moves. This early instability would go on to shape much of her life and artistic expression. Despite these challenges, Love found solace in music and acting, pursuits that would eventually lead her to global fame. In addition to her musical endeavors, Love has also made notable contributions to cinema. She earned a Golden Globe nomination for her role in The People vs. Larry Flynt in 1996, demonstrating her versatility as an artist. Beyond her professional achievements, Love's personal life has often been the subject of media attention. Her marriage to Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain in 1992 placed her at the center of the grunge movement, and his tragic suicide in 1994 was a pivotal point in her life. Love's struggles with addiction and legal issues have also been well-documented. Yet, despite the numerous trials she has faced, Love's enduring influence in the realm of music and pop culture is undeniable.\n\nOscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde (16 October 1854 – 30 November 1900) was an Irish poet and playwright. After writing in different forms throughout the 1880s, he became one of London's most popular playwrights in the early 1890s. He is best remembered for his epigrams and plays, his novel The Picture of Dorian Gray, and the circumstances of his criminal conviction for \"gross indecency\", imprisonment, and early death at age 46. Wilde's parents were successful Anglo-Irish intellectuals in Dublin. Their son became fluent in French and German early in life. At university, Wilde read Greats; he proved himself to be an outstanding classicist, first at Trinity College Dublin, then at Oxford. He became known for his involvement in the rising philosophy of aestheticism, led by two of his tutors, Walter Pater and John Ruskin. After university, Wilde moved to London into fashionable cultural and social circles. As a spokesman for aestheticism, he tried his hand at various literary activities: he published a book of poems, lectured in the United States and Canada on the new \"English Renaissance in Art\" and interior decoration, and then returned to London where he worked prolifically as a journalist. Known for his biting wit, flamboyant dress and glittering conversational skill, Wilde became one of the best-known personalities of his day. At the turn of the 1890s, he refined his ideas about the supremacy of art in a series of dialogues and essays, and incorporated themes of decadence, duplicity, and beauty into what would be his only novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890). The opportunity to construct aesthetic details precisely, and combine them with larger social themes, drew Wilde to write drama. He wrote Salome (1891) in French while in Paris but it was refused a licence for England due to an absolute prohibition on the portrayal of Biblical subjects on the English stage. Unperturbed, Wilde produced four society comedies in the early 1890s, which made him one of the most successful playwrights of late-Victorian London. At the height of his fame and success, while The Importance of Being Earnest (1895) was still being performed in London, Wilde had the Marquess of Queensberry prosecuted for criminal libel. The Marquess was the father of Wilde's lover, Lord Alfred Douglas. The libel trial unearthed evidence that caused Wilde to drop his charges and led to his own arrest and trial for gross indecency with men. After two more trials he was convicted and sentenced to two years' hard labour, the maximum penalty, and was jailed from 1895 to 1897. During his last year in prison, he wrote De Profundis (published posthumously in 1905), a long letter which discusses his spiritual journey through his trials, forming a dark counterpoint to his earlier philosophy of pleasure. On his release, he left immediately for France, never to return to Ireland or Britain. There he wrote his last work, The Ballad of Reading Gaol (1898), a long poem commemorating the harsh rhythms of prison life.\n\nDavid Patrick Bernard Norris (born 31 July 1944) is an Irish scholar, independent Senator and civil rights activist. Internationally, Norris is credited with having \"managed, almost single-handedly, to overthrow the anti-homosexuality law which brought about the downfall of Oscar Wilde\", a feat he achieved in 1988 after a fourteen-year campaign. He has also been credited with being \"almost single-handedly responsible for rehabilitating James Joyce in once disapproving Irish eyes\".Norris is a former university lecturer and a member of the Oireachtas, serving in Seanad Éireann since 1987. He was the first openly gay person to be elected to public office in Ireland. A founder of the Campaign for Homosexual Law Reform, he is also a prominent member of the Church of Ireland. He was a candidate for President of Ireland in the October 2011 election. He topped numerous opinion polls and was favourite among members of the Irish public for the position but withdrew from the race months before the election, before returning to the race in September 2011."
