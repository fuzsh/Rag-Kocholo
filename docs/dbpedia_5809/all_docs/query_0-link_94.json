The different diagnoses about Brentano’s impact range from pure “invisibility”1 to being “among the most important …philosophers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries”.2 Brentano is sometimes mentioned as a philosopher who had an “undoubted and far-reaching philosophical influence”.3 But the nature of this impact similarly has no consensus: sometimes, the “strong and consistent influence that Brentano’s writings … have had on subsequent thinkers” is assessed,4 while others rather see in Brentano a philosopher who had an “influence almost exclusively through his lecture courses”.5 These descriptions of the nature of Brentano’s influence actually address two different aspects of this influence. It is true to say that Brentano’s influence on Austro-German philosophy was diffused almost exclusively through the notes of his lecture courses and by his students. His lectures on metaphysics, for instance, were never published, but widely diffused among his students. Husserl, Meinong, Marty, Stumpf, Twardowski, and many others had copies of Brentano’s lectures notes and used them extensively for their own courses and publications.6 Moreover, his students only sparsely quote 1\n\nSee Poli (1995). Jacquette (2004). 3 Schuhmann (2004). 4 Tassone (2012, 2). 5 Schuhmann (2004). 6 It became a problematic issue among Brentano’s students as to whether they were acknowledging the influence of Brentano in their publications correctly. The best example of this is the publication of Alois Höfler and Alexius Meinong’s Logics in 1891, for which Anton Marty acted as an anonymous referee, giving a very negative 2\n\n10\n\nGuillaume Fréchette\n\nBrentano’s own publications. Stumpf in one of his biographies of Brentano evokes the reason for this: It is very awkward to have to refer to lectures or even conversations in order to explain to the reader the assumptions one uses as a starting point; it is even more awkward to attack points of view which came from your teacher and which you can no longer share, if these points of view are not available in printed form. How great is the possibility for misunderstanding and inaccuracy! How far, in any case, does the right to cite another’s views extend when they are views that the originator himself has not published and may have even renounced altogether or in part in the meantime? Personal separation for years must necessarily bring about transformations in thought on both sides, which make complete mutual understanding difficult. (Stumpf 1919/1976, 145/43)\n\nThe possibility of misunderstanding the master’s view, together with Brentano’s reluctance to publish, necessarily restricted the influence he exerted on his students to a corpus of lecture notes that were cited indirectly. In this context, it is fair to say that the impact of Brentano on philosophy is also measurable through the impact of some of the works of his students, at least those who were influenced in this way: Husserl’s Logical Investigations, Meinong’s Theory of Object, Twardowski’s On Content and Object of Presentations, Ehrenfels’ On Gestalt-Qualities are all works that indirectly exhibit the influence of Brentano’s lectures notes. In this sense, the impact that Brentano had on Austro-German philosophy, mostly through his direct students, doesn’t come from his publications but from his teaching.7 The specificity of this Austro-German channel of influence certainly plays an important role in the fact that, between the 1930s and the 1950s, with exception of a few ‘grand-students’ of Brentano (the students of Brenreview of the book, and even insinuating that the book was plagiarised from Brentano’s lecture notes. It is still unclear how Meinong discovered that Marty was the author of the review, but it is fair to say that it was Marty’s review that caused the break between Marty (and with him the whole orthodoxy of the school of Brentano) and the Meinongians. On this episode, see Fisette and Fréchette (2007, 55f.). 7 The ‘historical background’ presented in the Vienna Manifesto by the members of the Vienna Circle also makes clear not only that they were deeply influenced by the philosophy of Brentano and his school, but also that this influence was essentially mediated by the teachings of Brentano and his students (in the case of the Vienna Circle: Alois Höfler).\n\nIntroduction: Brentano’s Impact\n\n11\n\ntano’s students) who were actively doing research and cultivating Brentano’s influence, the presence of Brentano in Austrian and German philosophy remained relatively negligible. Brentano’s impact on philosophy followed a different course outside the German-speaking world. In France, Husserlian and Heideggerian phenomenology were the main channel of reception and discussion of Brentanian ideas. The works of Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, and Lévinas addressed Brentanian issues mainly from the angle of Husserlian subjectivity or Heidegger’s philosophy of Dasein. The reception of Brentano in the English-speaking world was considerably different: As early as 1876, the Scottish theologian and philosopher Robert Flint published a review of the Psychology in the first issue of Mind, which was then later discussed in the next issue of the journal by the Dutch orientalist and philosopher Jan Pieter Nicolaas Land (Land 1876). In 1879, the French psychologist Théodule Ribot discussed the ideas of Brentano in his (Ribot 1879). The British psychologist Titchener, a few years after his studies under Wundt’s supervision in Leipzig, also discussed Brentano’s Psychology in 1898.8 Brentano’s works were later introduced to Italy by Vailati, who published a number of articles on Brentano – in Italian – at the turn of the century.9 At about the same time, influenced by their teacher, Stout, in Cambridge, Russell and Moore became acquainted with Brentano’s philosophy. Stout’s Analytic Psychology, from 1896, deals extensively with Brentano’s psychology and adopts many of Brentano’s positions. Russell and Moore knew the book well.10 One can even find, in Moore (1899), echoes of the Brentanian distinction between the content of a belief or judgement and the object it is directed upon, a distinction that Moore opposes to Bradley.11 The first English translation of Brentano’s work was instigated by a student of Brentano, Anton Marty, who convinced his British student Cecil Hague, then in Prague, to prepare a translation of Vom 8\n\nSee Titchener (1898). See Albertazzi (2006, 27ff.). 10 Russell read the book “as soon as it came out” (see Griffin 1991, 34); Moore also read Stout’s book “with a great deal of attention.” In addition, Russell attended Stout’s lectures on the history of philosophy in 1893/94, as Moore did two years later. See Griffin (1991, 33). 11 This distinction is still unclear in Brentano (1874), but it might have been mediated through Twardowski (1894). See van der Schaar (1996) on the influence of Brentano’s student Kazimierz Twardowski in Cambridge. 9\n\n12\n\nGuillaume Fréchette\n\nUrsprung sittlicher Erkenntnis (Brentano 1889). The translation was published in 1902. A year later, it was positively reviewed by Moore (1903). Russell, however, cam into contact with Brentanian philosophy through his reading of Meinong and his correspondence with the Grazer philosopher from 1899 up to ‘On Denoting’ of 1905. He could have encountered Brentano in his reading of Stumpf (1873) as early as 1897.12 Russell (1899) discusses Meinong’s critique of Fechner’s interpretation of Weber’s law, as well as his theory of complexes and assumptions and his theory of object, in numerous papers published in Mind between 1899 and 1905.13 Russell later came back to Brentano’s theory of intentionality in his Analysis of Mind, proposing a critique of the Brentanian distinction between the physical and the psychical based on his monism. In Analysis of Mind, Russell pays tribute to Brentano, presenting his Psychology – in 1921 – as “still influential” and as “the starting-point of a great deal of interesting work.” It was here that the famous ‘intentionality quote’ was given in English for the first time. A second wave of influence came through Gilbert Ryle in England and Roderick Chisholm in North America. In the 1930s, Ryle had published numerous reviews on the newest publications coming from the phenomenological movement. Ryle labelled his own work ‘phenomenology’, albeit in a very restricted sense, although he disagreed with Merleau-Ponty’s affirmation that they both, at bottom, agreed.14 It was Russell’s Analysis of mind that led Chisholm to Brentano and Meinong.15 In the early 1950s he published a number of reviews of recent work in the field of phenomenology, and, at the behest of Ayer, delivered a lecture in London on ‘Sentences about believing’. In this lecture, he defended Brentano’s thesis about the irreducibility of intentionality. In many of his publications, Chisholm discusses Brentanian and Meinongian ideas, advocating the view that the reference of language has to be understood on the basis of the 12\n\nSee Russell (1897). On the relation between Russell and Meinong, see Simons (1992). 14 This disagreement was expressed at the Royaumont Colloquium on analytic philosophy in 1958. On the Ryle/Merleau-Ponty episode, see Beck (1962, 7). 15 See Chisholm (1997, 13). As a matter of fact, there actually is a direct connection between Brentano and Chisholm, and in some sense, Chisholm could be called Brentano’s grand-grand student (Urenkelschüler), since he attended Hocking’s courses, who was an early student of Husserl in Göttingen. See Chisholm (1997, 5). 13\n\nIntroduction: Brentano’s Impact\n\n13\n\nintentionality of thought. Chisholm’s focus on the irreducibility of intentional sentences had a decisive influence on the further reception of the so-called ‘Brentano thesis’.16 In 1960, Quine interpreted Brentano in light of Chisholm, seeing in Brentano’s thesis a claim about the indispensability of intentional idioms. Quine’s rejection of the ‘Brentano thesis’, together with Wittgenstein’s influence on the development of the philosophy of mind in the 1970s, played an important role in bringing programmes of naturalization to prominence in philosophy of mind. In the early 1980s the Churchlands called for the elimination of intentional concepts and the concepts of a ‘folk psychology’ that should make way for advances in neuroscience. Others still, like Searle, were closer to the spirit of Brentanian descriptive psychology. In Europe, in the late 1970s, three young British scholars – Kevin Mulligan, Peter Simons, and Barry Smith – contributed significantly to the reactivation of Brentano’s philosophy, and of Austrian philosophy more generally, by promoting its analytical ontological realism against the background of conv entionalism and anti-realism that were dominant in British philosophy at the time.17 Brentano’s presence in contemporary philosophy has benefited from these various receptions, both in Europe and in North America, to the extent that Brentanian or even ‘Neo-Brentanian’ views are now defended and discussed in philosophy of mind, value theory, ontology and theories of knowledge. Furthermore, the various contributions to this volume give good testimony to the vitality of Brentano’s philosophy. The particular history of his reception in 20th and 21st-century philosophy should, therefore, not be interpreted as the history of his invisibility, as has been suggested, but rather as a testimony to the wide and various long-term influence he has exerted upon analytic philosophy and phenomenology. At a time when philosophy oscillated between idealism (in Germany), empiricism, utilitarianism (in Great Britain) and positivism (in France), Brentano favoured an analytic and descriptive approach, influenced mainly by Aristotle and medieval 16 Chisholm not only did a great deal of work in Brentanian studies, but he also did much for the conservation, edition and publication of Franz Brentano’s posthumous writings. At the end of the 1950s, Chisholm met with John Brentano, the son of Franz Brentano, and arranged to publish these manuscripts, with the help of Georg Katkov (a grand-student of Brentano from Prague), William Kneale and Stephan Körner. Several volumes to whose edition he contributed were published by Meiner, and he instigated many translations of Brentano’s work in English. 17 See their Programmschrift: Mulligan, Simons & Smith (1984).\n\n14\n\nGuillaume Fréchette\n\nphilosophy. He saw from early on the importance of practicing philosophy with the same rigor as any other scientific investigation.18 These central features of philosophical investigation were identified by Brentano more than thirty years before Moore and Russell abandoned idealism, a few years before Frege’s Begriffsschrift, and thirty years after the publication of Bernard Bolzano’s Theory of science. His contribution, located at the source of both early analytic philosophy and phenomenology – or, following Simons (1986), on the ‘Anglo-Austrian Analytic Axis’ – is in this context clearly visible. His invisibility, if we can call it that, has more to do with his marginalization from both the analytic and continental philosophy of the 1950s, as a mere ‘forerunner of the phenomenological movement’,19 a ‘precursor of Husserl’,20 or, as Ryle calls him in relation with his philosophical offspring, the ‘disgusted grandfather of phenomenology’.21 ***\n\nThis volume gathers together fourteen new essays, which are grouped into five sections: Consciousness (I), Intentionality (II), Ontology and Metaphysics (III), the school of Brentano (IV) and a selection of original manuscripts and correspondence from Brentano’s Nachlass (V). These sections are not intended to cover Brentano’s whole philosophy, but merely to give an insight in three core issues of his philosophy (sections I to III) that are determinant in most, if not all, of his work. Although Brentano was not a systematic philosopher in the classical sense, his thought has systematic features that are addressed in the three first sections: 1) the epistemological priority of inner perception over outer perception, which is the basis of his theory of evidence, and which also plays a central role in his theory of consciousness; 2) his conception of intentionality as the mark of the 18\n\nSee his habilitation viva of 1866, as reprinted in Brentano (1929). See Spiegelberg (1965, 27). Brentano’s disciples certainly have their share of responsibility for the confusion about the nature of Brentano’s contribution. 20 Farber (1943, 11). Both Spiegelberg and Farber remained true to the late Husserl’s account of the (un)importance of Brentano for phenomenology: according to Husserl, “Brentano remained far from a phenomenology in [his] sense” and “did not see the essence of intentional analysis”. See Husserl (1980, 51). Unsurprisingly, this reading of the history of phenomenology was later advocated by Heidegger, who candidly remarked that “in a certain way, Husserl’s teacher Brentano had already noticed intentionality” (Heidegger 2001, 146). 21 Ryle (1976). 19\n\nIntroduction: Brentano’s Impact\n\n15\n\nmental, which is at the basis of his conception of perception in general, but also of sensations, cognition and valuation and 3) his ontological conception of the mind and the world as mereological structures, which underlies not only his philosophy of mind and his metaphysics, but also his ethics and his logics. The last two sections deal with the posterity of Brentano’s philosophy from two different perspectives: in section IV, the legacy of Brentano’s account of sense perception and feeling is discussed, while the history of Brentano’s unpublished manuscripts is discussed in section V. This section also presents an edition of a manuscript from 1899 on relations, along with the letters from Brentano to Marty which discuss this manuscript. The last part of section V contains the text of a public lecture given by Brentano on the laws of inference. This edited material is presented both in English translation and in the German original.

BRENTANIAN AND NEO-BRENTANIAN PERSPECTIVES INTRODUCTION (DENIS FISETTE)\n\nThe three papers grouped in this section illustrate the growing interest in philosophy of mind and cognitive science for the theory of consciousness developed by Franz Brentano in the second book of his Psychology of an Empirical Standpoint. This interest is on a par with the current debates surrounding the so-called problem of consciousness. This problem has been at the focal point of philosophers’ concern for the past thirty years and it concerns both the difficulties related to its definition as well as the scientific explanation based on the descriptive apparatus of the theories currently available on the market.1 It is also known as the ‘hard problem’ of consciousness, to use D. Chalmers’ well-known expression, mainly because of the resistance offered by (phenomenal) consciousness to a scientific explanation from the perspective of cognitive science.2 Faced with this problem, some philosophers have developed theories of consciousness inspired in part by Brentano’s theory of consciousness, thereby highlighting its relevance and value in light of current debates on consciousness. David Rosenthal has for example emphasized the innovative nature of Brentano’s theory of consciousness with respect to modern theories since Descartes, and in a recent article, he argues that the originality and breakthrough of Brentano’s views on consciousness rests on his characterization of mental states as conscious states: … it was rare until Brentano’s time to describe mental states as conscious at all. Even though Descartes and Locke were plainly writing about the property we describe as a state’s being conscious, they did 1 2\n\nCf. Fisette and Poirier (2000). Chalmers (1995).\n\n18\n\nDenis Fisette not say that our mental states are all conscious, but rather that we are conscious of all our mental states.” 3\n\nIndeed, this is one of the theses formulated by Brentano at the beginning of the second chapter of the second book of his Psychology and this thesis is an important piece of his theory of primary and secondary objects. Some philosophers of mind refer explicitly to Brentano as a precursor to their own theory. This is true primarily of Uriah Kriegel who characterizes his self-representational theory of consciousness as neoBrentanian.4 In his contribution to this volume (‘Brentano's Most Striking Thesis: No Representation Without Self-Representation’), he claims that Brentano’s theory is currently one of the main options in philosophy of mind: In recent years, it has turned out that Brentano still has much more to teach us. His account of consciousness in terms of self-directed intentionality has been developed and defended by a variety of authors, and is now among the leading options for a philosophical theory of consciousness in analytic philosophy of mind.5\n\nBrentano’s opponents recognize that his theory of primary and secondary objects is akin to a higher-order theory of consciousness, but argue at the same time that it is vulnerable to most of the objections raised against the latter and it is therefore not a reliable alternative for solving the problem of phenomenal experience.6 Many of these objections are in line with the criticism that D. Moran has addressed to Brentano in his article ‘Brentano’s Thesis'. Moran argues that “Brentano’s views as a whole are best understood as a continuation of the Scholastico-Cartesian tradition” and “did not progress much beyond a refined and nuanced Cartesianism in his account of the mind and its intentional relations”.7 In a more recent article entitled ‘Back to Brentano?’,8 Dan Zahavi has reviewed the ins and outs of this return to 3\n\nRosenthal (2009, 4).

Zahavi believes that if, as most theorists of consciousness do, we aim at a genuine theory of pre-reflective selfawareness, we ought to turn our attention to philosophers such as Husserl, Sartre or Merleau-Ponty because they truly contributed in their own way to the study of the qualitative and phenomenal dimension of consciousness. In response to these objections, other philosophers have argued that these discussions on the viability of the Brentanian theory of consciousness with regard to current debates on qualia and phenomenal consciousness presuppose that we have a reliable interpretation of Brentano’s views on consciousness. But opinions diverge on this issue. Indeed, while Kriegel claims that Brentano defended a selfrepresentational theory of consciousness,9 others identify it with a theory of higher-order thoughts or with an adverbial theory of consciousness.10 Hence the urgent need to revisit Brentano’s Hauptwerk. This task has been undertaken by two recognized Brentanian scholars in their contributions to this book, i.e. Johannes Brandl and Mark Textor. In his article ‘What is pre-reflective self-awareness? Brentano's theory of inner consciousness revisited,’ Brandl disagrees with the interpretations of Brentano’s theory that are in line with higherorder theories of consciousness and argues, against Brentano’s critics, that Brentano advocated a theory of pre-reflective self-awareness in the chapters of his Psychology devoted to the analysis of consciousness. Another important dimension of Brentano’s theory that is barely considered in these discussions is his doctrine of the unity of consciousness which, as shown by Textor in his article ‘Unity Without Self: Brentano on the Unity of Consciousness,’ constitutes a fundamental principle of his theory of consciousness and is therefore inseparable from the solution he proposed both to the problem of duplication and to that of regression.11 Textor emphasizes particularly the originality of Brentano’s conception of the unity of consciousness on what he calls the ‘conscious-of trap.’ This is what Kriegel calls Brentano’s most striking thesis : “that conscious states are conscious in virtue of self-representing (and to that extent that self-representation is the essence of consciousness).” (this volume, 24). 10 Thomasson (2000). 11 See also Textor (2006). 9\n\n20\n\nDenis Fisette\n\nwith regard to Hume’s bundle theory and argues that Brentano’s key concept is that of fusion, which has been developed by his student Carl Stumpf. All these discussions about the ins and outs of Brentano’s theory of consciousness raise a more general question regarding Brentano’s conception of the mind as a whole. In his classical paper ‘Two Concepts of Consciousness,’ Rosenthal has shown convincingly that the conception that one has of the mental determines in general the way one defines consciousness. Rosenthal himself advocates an intentionalist conception of the mind and seeks to reduce consciousness to an intentional relation between a higher-order thought (i.e. the content of a propositional attitude) and a lower-order state that it takes as its object. Within Brentanian studies, the received view since R. Chisholm is that Brentano’s key concept is that of intentionality, which he had the merit of having reintroduced in the vocabulary of philosophy and which still remains today a key concept in philosophy. Hence, what is sometimes called intentionalism or ‘Brentano’s thesis’ according to which intentionality is the fundamental characteristic of the mind. However, it is one thing to recognize Brentano’s merit of having reactualized the notion of intentionality, it is quite another to make it Brentano’s main thesis. For, as shown in the recent reception of Brentano’s philosophy, this intentionalist reading do not take into account other principles of his theory of consciousness, which is the central topic of the second book of his Psychology and where Brentano introduces his concept of intentionality. In addition, the work of Brentano on consciousness after the publication of his Psychology in 1874 provides further arguments against this interpretation. Textor and Kriegel offer significant corrections to Chisholm’s thesis, the first emphasizing the importance of the principle of the unity of consciousness within the general conception of the mind in his Psychology, and the second by attributing to Brentano the co-extension thesis of the mind and the conscious (“no mental state can be non-conscious”). They acknowledge, however, that this picture of Brentano’s theory raises several problems and leaves open several questions for further study of Brentano’s theory of consciousness.\n\nIntroduction to Section I References\n\n21\n\nCaston, V. 2002. ‘Aristotle on Consciousness’ in Mind 111: 751-815.

The extensional claim would be that all and only mental states are intentional states. The stronger claim would be that mental states are mental in virtue of being intentional. Unfortunately, the text itself does not appear to decisively support one interpretation over another, though arguably the tenor of Brentano’s discussion suggests the stronger claim: intentionality is the essence of mentality. It is much less known that Brentano also held a thesis of coextension between the mental and the conscious. Obviously, no non-mental state could be conscious. But interestingly, Brentano also argues for the converse: no mental state can be non-conscious. Thus the final Section 13 of Chapter 2 of Book II of the Psychology reads as simply: “There is no unconscious mental activity.” This was not a striking thesis at the time, mind you: Freud’s “The Unconscious” was not to appear for another forty years (Freud 1915).1 It follows, in any case, that the mental, the conscious, and the intentional or representational were all co-extensive for Brentano. A much more striking Brentanian thesis concerns the nature of consciousness itself. Over the past decade, several partially interpre1\n\nIt is sometime claimed that Leibniz’s petites perceptions were a pre-Freudian introduction of the unconscious, but upon examination this is not all that plausible. It is much more plausible that the petites perceptions were perceptual experiences in the periphery or “fringe” of consciousness.\n\n24\n\nUriah Kriegel\n\ntive works have appeared that cast Brentano as a forerunner of current-day self-representational theories of consciousness, according to which a mental state is conscious when, and only when, it represents itself in the right way (see, e.g., Caston 2002, Kriegel 2003). Brentano himself does not typically put things in terms of representation, but instead in terms of presentation (Vorstellung) and intentionality. In keeping with the current-day tendency to use the terms “intentionality” and “representation” synonymously, however, we may safely take a passage as this to mean that every conscious state self-represents (Brentano 1874: 153-4): [Every conscious act] includes within it a consciousness of itself. Therefore, every [conscious] act, no matter how simple, has a double object, a primary and a secondary object. The simplest act, for example the act of hearing, has as its primary object the sound, and for its secondary object, itself, the mental phenomenon in which the sound is heard.\n\nHere as before, there is no decisive textual evidence that the claim is not merely extensional – that all and only conscious states happen to self-represent. But the tenor of the discussion suggests a stronger thesis – that conscious states are conscious in virtue of self-representing (and to that extent that self-representation is the essence of consciousness). So now we have a four-way coextension in Brentano: intentionality/representation, mentality, consciousness, and self-representation are all coextensive to him. The coextension of the first and last of these is particularly surprising, however: Why would representation coextend with self-representation? Why would the very existence of one order of representation (namely, first-order) be conditioned by the existence of another order of representation (second-order)? Brentano is not shy about this claim of coextension. Section 8 of Chapter 2 of Part II of the Psychology reads: “A Presentation and the Presentation of that Presentation are Given in One Mental Act.” Thus Brentano appears fully committed, in a considered way, to the idea that there could be no representation without self-representation. To my mind, this is Brentano’s most striking thesis: that the very possibility of representing an apple, say, depends on the possibility of self-representing to represent an apple. In what follows, I want to argue that this claim, which sounds odd\n\nBrentano’s Most Striking Thesis\n\n25\n\nto our modern sensibilities, is actually deeply insightful. The insight can be briefly illustrated as follows. When I consciously think of the Sydney Opera House, I am in an internal state that represents the Sydney Opera House to me. The state thus instantiates two representation relations: it bears a representation-of relation to the Opera House and a representation-to relation to me. Although virtually all work on mental representation in the past century has focused on the nature of the representation-of relation, little if any illumination has been offered on the representation-to relation and its connection to representation-of. A close examination of the connection between these two relations reveals, first, that in some sense there could be no representation-of without representation-to, and secondly, that representation-to is plausibly implemented in self-representation. The plan for the rest of the paper is as follows. In §2, I will argue that there could be no representation-of without representation-to. There can be token representations-of that are not representations-to, but they must betoken a type of representation some tokens of which are both representations-of and representations-to. In §3, I will offer an analysis of “x represents y to z” according to which it means (more or less) that z has a representation of x representing y. In §4, I will note that this generates a regress of representations which can only end with self-representing representations. If my thought of the Sydney Opera House represents both the Opera House and itself, then it is both a representation-of and a representation-to without requiring the postulation of any further representation. The upshot is that there could be no representation without self-representation: in a world without self-representing representations there would be no representation at all. Brentano’s most striking thesis is true. 2 No representation-of without representation-to The notion that there could be no representation-of without representation-to might strike the reader as a non-starter. The world is awash with natural signs, and these can legitimately be said to represent what they do even if there is nobody to whom they represent. The rings on the tree’s trunk represent the tree’s age, the traces in the snow represent the culprit’s path, etc. Moreover, as Dretske (1988: 55) notes, what such natural signs represent is independent of what they are taken to represent. The tree rings would represent the tree’s age even if nobody took them to represent the tree’s age (or anything at all for\n\n26\n\nUriah Kriegel\n\nthat matter). They would represent the tree’s age even if everybody took them to represent the tree’s height (or took them to be non-representational). There may be a subtle fallacy in this reasoning, however. An ant strolling about a deserted island’s beach may form the inscription “cat” in the sand, and some rocks on Venus may accidentally be arranged “cat”-wise. We have no trouble saying that these structures represent cats, but we realize that, in and of themselves, there is nothing about these “cat” structures to make them mean cats in English rather than lizards in a language yet to be invented. These are instances of what we may call “representation by courtesy.”2 What is representation by courtesy? The “cat”-ly inscriptions represent what they do, and at all, only because they are graphically typeidentical to other inscriptions. There is, moreover, an asymmetry between these inscriptions and, say, my own deliberate “cat” inscriptions. The former represent because the latter do, but not conversely. In other words, the former represent by courtesy of the latter. Thus the token Venutian rock formation represents cats only because it betokens a type of representation some tokens of which represent cats. It follows that if those other tokens did not represent, the Venutian rock formation would not represent either. In general, we may construe representation-by-courtesy as follows: R1,…,Rn represent by courtesy of Rn+1,…,Rn+n just in case (i) R1,…,Rn belong to the same representation type as Rn+1,…,Rn+n, (ii) R1,…,Rn would not represent if Rn+1,…,Rn+n did not, and (iii) it is not the case that Rn+1,…,Rn+n would not represent if R1,…,Rn did not. It is very likely to turn out that (iv) Rn+1,…,Rn+n are paradigmatic or “core” tokens of the representation type to which they and R1,…,Rn belong. This may or may not force us to add this explicitly as a fourth condition, a condition of “paradigmaticness.” With the notion of representation-by-courtesy in mind, we may wonder whether unseen, undiscovered tree rings represent tree ages merely by courtesy of the discovered and seen tree rings. This would mean that representations-of that are not also representations-to represent only by courtesy of representations-of that are also representations-to. If so, the former would not represent if the latter did not. The slogan “No representation-of without representation-to” 2\n\nThe fitting label is due to Jenann Ismael.\n\nBrentano’s Most Striking Thesis\n\n27\n\nshould not be read, then, as the thesis that every token representationof must also be a representation-to. Rather, the thesis is that every token representation-of must betoken a representation type some tokens of which (perhaps paradigmatic ones) are both representations-of and representations-to.3 In the remainder of this section, I argue for this thesis. When we look at a duck-rabbit picture, it represents to us a duck and a rabbit (though not simultaneously). Suppose Smith has suffered a duck-related childhood trauma that causes her to repress all incoming duck-related information. It is reasonable to say that the same picture represents a rabbit to Smith, but does not represent a duck to her. Unlike Smith, Jones simply suffered a brain lesion and consequently cannot recognize ducks. To her too, the picture represents a rabbit but not a duck. Importantly, in the case of Jones we may suppose that it is nomologically impossible for her to recognize the duck representation in the picture. Suppose now that there were pictures of an animal which it was nomologically impossible for any human to recognize as such. More generally, imagine a natural sign S of a signified entity E, such that it is nomologically impossible for all humans to recognize that S signifies E. Worse, imagine it is nomologically impossible for any nomologically possible sentient creature to recognize S as signifying E. Does S represent E? I entreat the reader to consult her own intuition, but mine is a categorical No. If it be accepted that S does not represent E, despite bearing the right informational/teleological relation to E, the question arises, Why is S not a representation of E? The only plausible answer seems to be that S is not a representation of E because it is not, and cannot in principle be, a representation of E to anyone. It appears, then, that S cannot be a representation of E if it is nomologically impossible for S to be a representation of E to some nomologically possible sentient creature. Thus the nomological possibility of representation-to is a necessary condition for actual representation-of. It is quite improbable that there is a natural-sign type all of whose actual tokens do not represent to anyone even though its nomologically possible tokens do. But suppose there is. It is still the case that 3\n\nIf we accept the fourth condition on representation-by-courtesy, we may also formulate the thesis (or a nearby one), more economically, as follows the claim that every paradigmatic token of representation-of is also a representation-to.\n\n28\n\nUriah Kriegel\n\nthese tokens are representations-of only because they belong to the same type as the nomologically possible tokens that are also representation-to.4 Furthermore, the converse does not hold: it is not the case that the nomologically possible tokens that are also representations-to are representations-of because they belong to the same type as the actual representation-of that are not also representations-to. It follows that the actual representations-of represent only by courtesy of the relevant nomologically possible representations-of. It might be objected that our tentative fourth condition on representation-by-courtesy does not hold here. The relevant nomologically possible tokens cannot be paradigmatic, precisely because they are merely possible. However, the assumption that actuality is necessary for the status of paradigm is misplaced. There are no actual perfect circles, only possible ones. Yet perfect circles are surely the paradigms of circularity. In the case of natural representations, it likewise seems that those that represent what they do to someone are paradigmatic. Another objection would be that there are different notions of representation, some of which may require little more than brute covariation relations. In philosophical contexts, “representation” is used technically, and so can surely be used, in some context, in that sort of thin sense. This objection is grounded in a correct observation but misapplies it. It is correct that the notion of representation is technical and can be used in any number of ways. But there is only one sense of representation that concerns me here, namely, the sense in which it can be said to capture intentionality. The discussion in the present is not interested in every possible notion of representation, but in the notion that is of relevance to Brentano’s most striking thesis, which is a thesis about intentionality.5 4\n\nOne view, by no means implausible, is that tokens of a natural sign type which has no actual tokens that are representations-to are not representations-of. On this view, representation-of requires not only nomologically possible representation-to, but also actual representation-to. Although I find this view plausible, I will not commit to it here. 5 Moreover, to the extent that we are liberal in our usage of “representation,” just as we can devise a thin sense of representation that would require very little, so we can devise a thick sense on which representation-of is impossible without representationto by stipulation.\n\nBrentano’s Most Striking Thesis\n\n29\n\nThere is also a more principled methodological reason for giving center stage to this thicker notion of representation. After all, this is the only form of representation we really know from the first-person point of view – the only form of representation we are personally acquainted with, if you will.6 Other forms of representation are theoretical constructs and can thus deploy all manners of technical notion of representation. But the notion of representation that captures intentionality is not merely a theoretical construct. It is something we are directly acquainted with, and which we take to have the status of representation not merely in a purely theoretical or technical sense. 3 What is representation-to? As mentioned in §1, discussions of representation have focused on representation-of to the virtual exclusion of representation-to. As a result, we have a very murky notion of representation-to to work with. In this section, I will try to say something constructive about representation-to. A minimalist might attempt to account for representation-to simply in terms of ownership. For a state or feature to represent something to someone is simply for that state or feature to represent what it does and be a state or feature of the relevant “someone.” On this account, “x to represent y to z” can be analyzed as follows: (i) x represents (is a representation of) y and (ii) x occurs in z (or: x “belongs to” z in the appropriate sense). The minimalist account is highly implausible. The tree rings (i) represent the tree’s age and (ii) are a feature of the tree, but they do not represent the tree’s age to the tree. So conditions (i) and (ii) can be fulfilled even when representation-to does not occur. Conversely, the tree rings do not represent the tree’s age to the tree, but they do represent the tree’s age to Tania the botanist. Yet they are not a state or feature of Tania. So representation-to can occur even when condition (ii) is not satisfied. Note, more generally, that representation-to comes in two varieties: one where x is an internal state of z and one where it is not. As I think of the Sydney Opera House, my thought represents the Opera House to me. And as I look at my postcard of the Sydney Opera House, the postcard represents the Opera House to me. Both cases involve repre6 This consideration is inspired by a similar methodological principle due to Georgalis (2006).\n\n30\n\nUriah Kriegel\n\nsentation-to, but clearly they are crucially different. We may call the first variety first-person representation-to and the second third-person representation-to. It is reasonable to expect that the two varieties would require two different accounts. After all, they seem to be slightly different phenomena. In particular, the first-person variety seems somehow more fundamental than the third-person one. At the same time, it is reasonable to expect that there will be something in common in the two accounts, since there is something in common in the two phenomena accounted for. It should therefore be a constraint on the adequacy of an account of representation-to that it accounts for this commonality.7 A modified minimalist account might restrict the analysans to conscious and/or sentient creatures. So “x represents y to z” is to be analyzed as (i) x represents y, (ii) x occurs in z, and (iii) z is a conscious and/or sentient creature.8 Nothing represents anything to trees, but internal states of conscious/sentient creatures may represent to them. This analysis is still implausible. For one thing, it does not address the possibility of third-person representation-to. As we noted, in such representation-to condition (ii) is not satisfied. In fact, however, the account is unsuccessful even as an account of first-person representation-to only. States of a conscious and sentient creature’s skin, say, can represent some environmental feature without representing it to the creature. Thus, Brown’s goosebumps represent that the ambient temperature is below 6ñC. The state of being goosbumped thus (i) represents the ambient temperature and (ii) occurs in Brown, and (iii) Brown is a conscious and sentient creature. Yet it does not represent the temperature to Brown. (At least this is so if we stipulate that, throughout her life, Brown remains unaware that her goosebumps constitute the natural sign they do.) Moreover, even if we restrict ourselves to mental internal states, conscious and sentient creatures have unconscious states that repre7\n\nThus, if someone held that the minimalist account is at least a good analysis of firstperson representation-to, we would protest that it makes no room for a commonality with third-person representation-to. There is, of course, also the problem discussed above, that the tree rings do not represent the tree’s age to the tree even though the minimalist analysis’ conditions are satisfied. 8 I use ‘and/or’ here as short for formulating what are in fact two separate analyses, one requiring z to be conscious, the other requiring him or her to be sentient.\n\nBrentano’s Most Striking Thesis\n\n31\n\nsent, but not to them. Blain the blindsight patient has an unconscious perceptual representation of an orange in his left visual field. Blain’s perception (i) represents the orange and (ii) occurs in Blain, and (iii) Blain is a conscious and sentient creature. Yet clearly it does not represent the orange to Blain.9 A more sophisticated account of representation-to will focus on the use to which representations are put. When the tree rings represent the tree’s age to Tania, at least part of what is involved is that Tania can use the tree rings as a representation of the tree’s age. She can use that information, e.g., to make inferences, decisions, etc. Likewise, my thought, which represents the Sydney Opera House to me, is poised for free use in action guidance, reasoning, deliberation, etc. An internal state can thus be said to represent to the subject when it is poised for this sort of use by the subject. The analysis here offered is basically this: x represents y to z iff (i) x represents y and (ii) z can use x as a representation of y. One advantage of this use-based account of representation-to is that it identifies a commonality of the first-person and third-person varieties. At the same time, the use will be cashed out differently in each case. In the case of third-person representation-to, the representation is “used” somewhat as a tool is used. The subject “uses” the representation as she may use a hammer. In the case of first-person representation-to, the use is rather a matter of the representation’s functional role: x represents y to z when x has the right functional role in z’s mental life. Interestingly, it was once popular to account for representation-of in terms of functional role. That was the idea in functional role semantics.10 Beyond the variety of technical problems this approach faced, ultimately it came up against the principled problem that “functional role semantics” appears to be an oxymoron: functional role is a matter of relations among mental states, whereas semantics, represen9\n\nThe same holds for tacit beliefs. Tacitus believed that 1374.67 is greater than 873.92. His belief (i) represented the fact that 1374.67>873.92 and (ii) occurred in Tacitus, and (iii) Tacitus was a conscious and sentient creature. Yet the belief did not represent the fact that 1374.67>873.92 to Tacitus in any non-technical sense. At least this is so if we stipulate that, throughout his life, Tacitus never became aware of this tacit belief. Searle (1992) claims that tacit beliefs could not be anything but brute neurophysiological states. If so, Tacitus’ tacit belief is no different from his goosebumps. Unconscious brain states and skin states are exactly the same in the respect. 10 See Field (1977), Loar (1981), Harman (1982), Block (1986), Brandom (1994).\n\n32\n\nUriah Kriegel\n\ntation-of, is a matter of relations to (typically) extra-mental entities. It appears impossible to get the latter out of the former. Since representation-to is not fundamentally a matter of relation to extra-mental entities, a functional role account of representation-to is much more plausible. In particular, one may employ functional role semantics that incorporate a “consumer semantics” component.11 This view considers as the key aspect of a representation’s functional role its availability for consumption by certain cognitive modules. Presumably, the account would designate as central the representation’s availability to an executive control module, or perhaps focus on the representation’s global availability to a number of high-level modules. The use-based account does run into a principled problem of its own. Having a certain functional role is a dispositional property, but being a representation-to seems to be a manifest, hence non-dispositional, property. Thus, for a mental state to be poised for use, it need not actually be used; for it to be available to certain modules, it need not actually be availed of by them. But representing something to someone is not just a matter of things possibly happening. Something does actually happen when my thought represents the Sydney Opera House to me. So representation-to cannot amount to nothing more than functional role, since a non-dispositional property cannot amount to a mere disposition. In fact, it is quite likely that representation-to is the categorical basis of the relevant functional role. My thought of the Sydney Opera House is poised for free use by me because it represents what it does to me, not the other way round.12 Another problem with the use-based account is that, despite initial appearances, it actually fails to account for the commonality of firstand third-person representation-to. Although we can employ the word “use” for both, it does not seem to be in the same sense. In the case of third-person representation-to, “use” is employed literally: the tree rings’ representation of the tree’s age is indeed used as a hammer might. But in the case of first-person representation-to, “use” is employed most certainly metaphorically. I do not “use” my thought’s 11 This is the semantics favored by Carruthers (2000 Ch. 9); see Millikan (1984, 1989) for consumer semantics proper. 12 To my mind, the same problem afflicts functional role accounts of representationof. Functionalists assume that a representation acquires its representational content in virtue of its functional role. But this quite obviously puts the cart before the horse. More plausibly, a representation acquires the functional role it does precisely because of the representational content it has.\n\nBrentano’s Most Striking Thesis\n\n33\n\nrepresentation of the Opera House as I might a hammer. Perhaps when I consciously and deliberately make inferences on the basis of my thought, I could be said to “use” it in a literal sense. But such conscious, personal-level inferences account for a marginal part of the relevant functional role. In the face of these problems, I would like to make what may sound on first hearing like a silly suggestion: a representational account of representation-to. The idea is to account for representation-to purely in terms of representation-of. Thus, the fact that the tree rings represent the tree’s age to Tania lends itself quite naturally to the following interpretation: Tania has a representation of the tree rings’ representation of the tree’s age. More generally, x represents y to z iff (i) x is a representation of y and (ii) z has a representation of x’s representation of y. Now, for z to have a representation of x’s representation of y is for z to have, or be in, some internal state w, such that w represents x’s representation of y. So the overall analysis may be stated as follows: x represents y to z iff (i) x is a representation of y and (ii) z has a(n internal state) w, such that w is a representation of x’s representation of y. A general argument for the representational account is this: x may be said to represent y to z only if z is aware of x’s representation of y; awareness of something requires representation of it (for example, I cannot be aware of a table without having an internal representation of it); therefore, x may be said to represent y to z only if z has a representation of x’s representation of y. Condition (ii) in the representational account does not require – though it may be strengthened to do so – that z’s representation be propositional or conceptual. As (ii) stands, it does not require that z have a representation that x represents y, nor even that z have a representation of x as a representation of y. The representation of x’s representation of y may perfectly well be altogether non-conceptual. But should we come upon a good reason to introduce a stronger requirement – say, that the representation be conceptual – we could readily tweak (ii) to make it so. 4 The necessity of self-representation One advantage of the representational account is that it successfully accounts for the commonality between first- and third-person representation-to. When my postcard represents the Opera House to me,\n\n34\n\nUriah Kriegel\n\nthis is because I have a representation of the postcard’s representation of the Opera House. And when my thought represents the Opera House to me, this is because I have a representation of my thought’s representation of the Opera House. This raises an immediate worry, however. The account appears to lead straightforwardly to a vicious regress, at least for first-person representation-to. When x represents y to z, this is because z has (or is in) an internal state w, such that w represents (is a representation of) x’s representation of y. But given that representation-of requires representation-to, we may expect w not just to represent what it does, but to do so to z. And off we are on a regress. Once the specter of regress afflicts first-person representation-to, it is bound to haunt third-person representation-to as well. Let us suppose that the tree rings represent the tree’s age to a machine whose function is to garner and process information on trees’ age. The rings represent as they do because the machine has a representation of the tree rings’ representation of the tree’s age. The machine may in its turn represent what it does to Blain the blindsighted. It would do so in virtue of Blain’s unconscious perceptual representation of the machine’s representation of the tree rings’ representation of the tree’s age. This unconscious perceptual representation may represent what it does to Nora the neuroscientist, who is observing Blain’s brain with functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). The unconscious representation represents as it does because Nora has a representation of Blain’s representation of the machine’s representation of the tree rings’ representation of the tree’s age. But it may then be the case that Nora’s representation represents what it does to Nora. The chain of third-person representations-to thus comes to an end with a first-person representation-to. So if a vicious regress does afflict Nora’s firstperson representation-to, the affliction will transmit to all those thirdperson representations-to chainlinked thereto. It might be thought that this looming regress problem could be skirted by purely technical considerations. Recall, the thesis argued for in §2 was not that every token representation-of is also a representation-to. We have allowed there to be token representations-of, perhaps very many of them, that are not representations-to. If so, z’s internal state w, which is a representation of x’s representation of y, need not necessarily be a representation to z. Thus, when my thought represents the Opera House to me, I must have a representation of my\n\nBrentano’s Most Striking Thesis\n\n35\n\nthought of the Opera House, but that second-order representation need not represent what it does to me. This technical resolution of the regress problem seems somehow unsatisfactory, however – as though it does not get to the root of the issue. After all, if the second-order representation does not represent anything to me, if it is characterized by the sort of ‘blindness’ of brute representations-of, it is hard to see how the first-order representation would inherit its representation-to component therefrom. Internal states that represent but not to their subject are akin to the representations the blindsighted hosts somewhat impersonally. Such an impersonal representation seems ill-suited to bestow the representation-to status on my thought of the Opera House. Relatedly, recall that although we allowed representations-of to be such even when they are not representations-to, we allowed them to be representations-of only by courtesy. It is difficult to see how a fullblown representation, which is both a representation-of and a representation-to, can be such in virtue of being ‘represented’ by something that is a representation only by courtesy. (I use inverted commas around “represented” precisely because the representation in question is only such by courtesy.) Moreover, there is nothing in the above technical consideration to preclude the chance occurrence of an infinite chain of representations. Although we have allowed representations-of to not be representations-to, we have also allowed them to be representations-to. Even if the likelihood that a particular thought of mine would implicate an infinity of higher-order representations is negligible, this is a purely contingent matter. There is thus a nomologically possible world in which my thought represents the Opera House to me in virtue of a second-order representation-of that happens to be also a representation-to, the second-order representation is a representation-to in virtue of a third-order representation-of that also happens to be a representation-to, and so on ad infinitum. The infinite regress is thus nomologically possible. Furthermore, a regress may be vicious enough without being infinite. The possibility, whose likelihood is not negligible, that a thought of mine would implicate, say, six orders of representation, is problematic. It is problematic because it is empirically implausible that we may happen to entertain six orders of representation on a particular occasion of thinking of an opera house.\n\n36\n\nUriah Kriegel\n\nFor all these reasons, we should not rest content with the technical resolution of the regress problem, but instead seek a resolution that is not so shrouded in suspicion. I turn now to such a resolution. We said above that when x represents y to z, z must have a token representation w of x’s representation of y. Our discussion thus far has assumed that it must be the case that w ≠ x. But this is precisely the assumption that generates the regress. If we allow that in (some) cases of first-person representation-to w = x, the regress does not get started. For then x represents y to z because (i) x represents y and (ii) x represents x’s representation of y. No second-order representation is introduced, so the regress is stopped at its second step. Thus, my thought represents the Sydney Opera House to me in virtue of the facts that (i) the thought represents the Sydney Opera House and (ii) the thought represents that it, itself, represents the Sydney Opera House.13 On this view, what is involved in a token x representing y to z is x’s falling under two distinct types of representation-of: the type Representation-of-y and the type Representation-of-representation-of-y.14 The latter type can perfectly well be betokened by a token state that does not betoken the former type. In that case, no self-representation comes into play. That is in fact what happens when w ≠ x. There, w betokens the type Representation-of-representation-of-y but not the type Representation-of-y, and so does not self-represent. The emerging picture involves representations-of that are also third-person representations-to in virtue of being represented by further representations-of in a chain of representations that ends in representations-of that are first-person representations-to; these are first-person representations-to in virtue of being representations of themselves. Thus representation-to bottoms out in representation-of, but of a very special kind, namely, self-representation. The outcome can thus be captured in the slogan ‘No representation without selfrepresentation.’ This picture raises problems of its own. An immediate set of questions arises in connection with the very notion of self-representation. 13 I do not mean to suggest that the representation must represent itself as itself. (Perhaps it will turn out that it does, but we ought not commit to this until a compelling argument is offered.) Also, although I am using the propositional form here (with the ‘that’ clause), this is inessential and can be rid of readily. 14 This is in fact Caston’s (2002) view of conscious representations: they are token representations that betoken two representational types in such a way that they become self-representing.\n\nBrentano’s Most Striking Thesis\n\n37\n\nWhat is self-representation? What does it mean for a thought to represent itself? What representations are self-representing? How does a representation come to self-represent? Addressing all these questions would be impossible here (see Kriegel 2009 for partial addressing of many). But note that the Brentanian thesis that all and only conscious states are self-representing would be eminently relevant here. For it would cast conscious experiences as the stopgaps of regress, bestowing representational status on all those representations-of chainlinked to them. This line of reasoning suggests a tight connection between consciousness and representation, of the sort proponents of the so-called ‘Phenomenal Intentionality Research Program’ seem to have in mind (see Kriegel 2012 for a collection of relevant essays). Other kinds of mental states have at times been offered as self-representing. Burge (1988) argued that “cogito-like” thoughts are selfrepresenting (or have a second-order content “locked onto” their firstorder content). Shoemaker (1996) claimed that certain “available” beliefs self-represent (they perform “double duty” as first-order beliefs that p and second-order beliefs that one believes that p). Such cogitolike thoughts or available beliefs may turn out to be conscious states, but in any case they could serve as stopgaps themselves.15 If there are mental states that are self-representing, there must be a way they come to self-represent and there must be a possible account of what it means for them to self-represent. Such an account would ultimately have to be provided if we are to fully understand representation-to and representation-of. But for present purposes it suffices we note simply that the account must exist. That would suggest that the questions raised above do not point to inherent defects in the picture proposed here, but should rather be thought of as invitations to elaborate the model. Another sort of objection may be that the original regress problem has only been replaced by another. Consider x’s representation, not of y, but of its own representation of y. Does x represent its own representation of y to z, or not? If it does, then it would seem that it must do so in virtue of representing its own representation of its own representation of y. If it does not, then it is still hard to see how such an ‘impersonal’ representation of the fact that x represents y can bestow a 15 A view of this sort was also held by Thomas Reid (see Lehrer 1989, Hossack 2002), who held that all sensations are self-representing.\n\n38\n\nUriah Kriegel\n\nrepresentation-to component on x. One response to this dilemma is to embrace the new regress but note that it is only a regress of types, not of tokens, and as such is less vicious. Even if we agree that x represents not only its own representation of y, but also its own representation of its own representation of y, its own representation of its own representation of its own representation of y, and so on, it still remains the case that x is a single token state. And we must realize that falling under a type, or betokening a type, is not some sort of activity that a token might be said to expend energy on. There is no extra “cognitive burden” involved in betokening three types rather than two or an infinity rather than five. At the same time, there is certainly something odd about the notion of an infinitely typed thought. Intuitively, there has to be something about a token in virtue of which it betokens the types it does. Thus if a token mental state betokens infinitely many representational types, there should be something about that token that makes it the case that it betokens the representational type of the 837th order, and it is hard to see what that would be.16 A better response employs the token/type distinction as well, but differently. When we contemplated the “technical” resolution of the regress problem above, we were uncomfortable allowing a representation-of to qualify as a representation-to in virtue of being represented by a representation-of that is itself not a representation-to. We were uncomfortable allowing this mainly because representations-of which are not also representations-to represent only by courtesy. Observe, however, that being a representation by courtesy (or not) is not a property of representational types, but rather of representational tokens. So, once a token becomes a representation-to in virtue of betokening a second-order representation type in a way that makes it self-representing, it does not represent only by courtesy, but in and of itself. We may thus allow that x represents y to z in virtue of representing its own representation of y, since it represents its own representation of y in and of itself and not merely by courtesy. This may suggest an “attenuation” of the representational analysis 16\n\nNonetheless, the regress of types must be deemed at least more acceptable than the regress of tokens. Thus, some people may hold that every token necessarily betokens an infinity of types, since it betokens indefinitely many disjunctive types. Thus, if a creature betokens the type Cat, it also betokens the type Cat-or-dog. Others, however, may reject this notion, claiming either that there are no disjunctive types or that the tokening of a disjunctive type is not just a matter of tokening one of the disjunct types.\n\nBrentano’s Most Striking Thesis\n\n39\n\nof representation-to offered in §2: x represents y to z iff (i) x represents y, (ii) z has a(n internal state) w that represents x’s representation of y, and (iii) w represents not merely by courtesy. On the other hand, this analysis would strip some third-person representations-to of their status as such. A more cautious analysis would rest on a disjunctive third condition: x represents y to z iff (i) x represents y, (ii) z has a(n internal state) w that represents x’s representation of y, and (iii) either (a) w represents not merely by courtesy, or (b) there is a z*, such that w represents x’s representation of y to z*. 5 Conclusion: Brentano the teacher Husserl once wrote a touching essay entitled “Reminiscences of Franz Brentano” (see McAlister 1977 Ch.2), which offers a warm and respectful portrait of someone who for him was clearly first and foremost a teacher. It is well-known that Brentano taught a whole generation of leading philosophers, including Husserl, Meinong, Twardowski, Stumpf, Marty, and others. At one time, later generations were interested in Brentano’s mostly for his thesis that intentionality is the mark of the mental, and sometimes also for his insistence that intentionality cannot be understood in physical terms. In recent years, it has turned out that Brentano still has much more to teach us. His account of consciousness in terms of self-directed intentionality has been developed and defended by a variety of authors, and is now among the leading options for a philosophical theory of consciousness in analytic philosophy of mind. In this paper, I have argued that there may be yet another deep and insightful lesson we have in store from Brentano, one that connects the very possibility of representation to self-representation. Unlike most work on mental representation over the past century, Brentano’s thinking on the subject is attune to the fact that mental representation involves crucially not only a representation-of relation, but also a representation-to relation. Attention to this relation of representation-to opens the door to a number of surprising and important theses about the nature of mental representation; not least the notion that there would be no representation without self-representation.\n\n40 References\n\nUriah Kriegel\n\nBlock, N. 1986. ‘Advertisement for a Semantics for Psychology’ in Midwest Studies in Philosophy 10: 615-677.

BRANDL\n\n(UNIVERSITY OF SALZBURG)\n\n1 Introduction A common distinction drawn in philosophical theories of self-awareness is the distinction between reflective and pre-reflective ways of being aware of oneself. The distinction goes by many names. Pre-reflective self-awareness is also called ‘non-objectual’, ‘nonobjectifying’, ‘non-observational’, ‘non-thematic’, ‘non-conceptual’, ‘intrinsic’, ‘implicit’, ‘tacit’, ‘low-level’ or simply ‘basic’ self-awareness. The terminology varies with the philosophical traditions in which this idea has been nurtured. In one form it originated in German Idealism and in German Romantic philosophy where it plays a central role in the works of Fichte, Hölderlin, Novalis and Schelling.1 Another version of it emerged – or re-emerged – in the writings of Husserl, Scheler, Sartre and the ensuing phenomenological tradition.2 Finally and most recently, philosophers taking a naturalistic approach employ a similar distinction when they refer to simple forms of self-awareness in pre-verbal children and in nonhuman animals.3 It is not just the terminology that varies however. Given the huge differences in doctrine between these traditions it is unlikely that they converge in that particular case on a single idea. We should rather expect to find as many different conceptions of pre-reflective selfawareness as there have been reasons for drawing such a distinction. 1 This tradition has been reconstructed and given a modern shape in the work of Dieter Henrich (1966) and Manfred Frank (1991). 2 The phenomenological approach to pre-reflective self-awareness is elaborated and defended in the work of D. Zahavi (1999, 2005) and S. Gallagher (Gallagher & Zahavi 2008). 3 A naturalistic bottom-up approach to self-awareness is taken, for instance, by Jose Bermúdez (1998) and Gottfried Vosgerau (2009).\n\n42\n\nJohannes L. Brandl\n\nYet another source to which one can turn here is the work of the 19th century philosopher and psychologist Franz Brentano. His attempt to provide a systematic foundation for the idea of pre-reflective selfawareness will be reconsidered in what follows. That Brentano should play a seminal role in this context may need no further explanation. It is well known that Brentano had a formative influence on phenomenology, providing it with the theoretical background from which Husserl and his successors took off. This makes Brentano’s view important from a historical point of view. In addition to that, however, I will argue that there are also systematic reasons for revisiting his writings on this matter.4 In my view, Brentano had a conception of pre-reflective self-awareness that was both more sophisticated and less mysterious than many of the accounts one can find elsewhere. This includes the recent self-representational theories of consciousness that have been developed in a neo-Brentanian spirit.5 Despite this renewed interest in Brentano, I think that the main virtue of his theory of inner consciousness has been overlooked. Brentano conceived of self-awareness as a phenomenon that initially provides very little insight into the mind and only gradually turns into an epistemically clear form of self-awareness. This makes his theory not just interesting from a phenomenological point of view but also from a naturalistic perspective, or so I shall argue. The plan of the paper is as follows. I begin with Brentano’s definition of mental phenomena (section 2) and his idea that mental phenomena have a distinctive internal structure (section 3). I then consider what inner consciousness contributes to this structure by clarifying two distinctions with which Brentano operates here: the distinction between primary and secondary objects (section 4), and his distinction between inner perception and inner observation (section 5). The main step in my interpretation will then consist in pointing out that inner perception and inner observation need not be conceived as two distinct cognitive faculties. Rather we can think of them as one faculty that gives rise to gradually different forms of self-knowledge 4 I am following here other recent interpreters that have pointed out the systematic significance of Brentano’s view. See Thomasson (2000); Smith (1986, 2004); Soldati (2005); Janzen (2006) and Textor (2006). 5 A collection of papers that attempt to revive Brentano’s ideas within the contemporary framework of a representational theory of consciousness has been published by U. Kriegel and K. Williford (2006). The intricacies of this approach are clearly set forth and developed further by Kidd (2011).\n\nWhat is Pre-Reflective Self-Awareness?\n\n43\n\n(section 6). In the remaining part of the paper I will then exploit this interpretation for rebutting two objections that have been raised against Brentano’s theory. David Rosenthal has argued that Brentano’s model rests on a Cartesian premise and should therefore be replaced by a proper higher-order theory of consciousness (section 7). Others, including Henrich, Frank and many phenomenologists have questioned Brentano’s treatment of the regress-problem and on that basis suggested that Brentano’s model of consciousness should be replaced by a strictly one-level theory (section 8). I will argue that both objections miss their target because Brentano’s fits neither the mould of a higher-order nor of a one-level theory. 2 Intentionality: clearing the ground Brentano is famous for a doctrine that was not his own invention. I am referring of course to his doctrine of the intentional nature of mental phenomena, as it is stated in the often quoted passage of his Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint (1874/1995). This is not to suggest that Brentano was hiding his sources, as he explicitly mentions them: “the Scholastics of the Middle Ages”, he says, already held the view that “every mental phenomenon is characterized by what [they] called the intentional (or mental) inexistence of an object” (ibid., p. 88). Brentano picks up this idea and makes it the foundation of his characterization of the mind. By following this Scholastic lead, he thinks that psychology can remain neutral on the question concerning which entities are capable of instantiating mental phenomena. Psychology, he suggests, can be defined as “the science of mental phenomena”, without mentioning a bodily or mental substance that instantiates such phenomena. Brentano thereby closes – at least for the moment6 – the door to a theory of the self. The objects of investigation in his Psychology are the mental acts of perceiving, thinking, and feeling, not a self that perceives, thinks and feels. Yet one should not conclude thereby that Brentano also closes the door to a theory of self-awareness. He spends two entire chapters (chapters II and III of the second book) on setting forth an account of ‘inner consciousness’. Although Brentano refrains from using the term ‘self-awareness’ (i.e. ‘Selbstbewusstsein’), these 6\n\nBrentano intended to re-open this door in a later volume of his Psychology dedicated to the metaphysics of the mind (see Brentano 1874/1995, p. xv). He never finished this project, however, and I will not engage with this aspect of his philosophy here.\n\n44\n\nJohannes L. Brandl\n\nchapters contain what we now call a theory of ‘pre-reflective’ selfawareness.7 This will become clearer as we go along. First, however, some clarifications of Brentano’s doctrine of intentionality are in order. When one interprets Brentano’s intentionality thesis literally, it says that mental phenomena contain intentional objects. These are not ordinary objects that may or may not exist in a spatio-temporal world, but mental images, ideas or concepts that we know to exist in the mind-dependent realm of our consciousness. Many interpreters have claimed however that Brentano’s doctrine involves no commitment to such intra-mental objects. Since I find these interpretations contrived, I prefer to take Brentano literally and accept that his notion of intentionality includes the category of immanent objects.8 Yet in opting for an immanentist interpretation, I am not proposing that Brentano is a full-scale immanentist who denies our minds the power to direct its attention to mind-independent objects. That, too, would be a serious distortion of his view. Brentano was convinced he could block this counter-intuitive consequence by understanding the images and concepts that exist “in” our minds as making up the content of our mental acts, without also being their targets. That means to acknowledge that Brentano always drew a clear distinction between mental acts, their immanent content, and whatever objects they are directed at.9 It has been suspected that Brentano missed this crucial distinction because he often uses the terms ‘content’ and ‘object’ interchangeably. Brentano’s specific interests may explain this unfortunate aspect of his terminology, however. He defended what we now call an ‘internalist’ view of knowledge. From this perspective, one can be certain that mental acts and the ideas and concepts contained in them exist, but one cannot be certain that any objects exist in the external world or that they have the properties attributed to them in experience. This concern for what is certain or immediately evident may be reflected in his tendency to switch from ‘object’-talk to ‘content’-talk. But Brentano does not lose sight of this distinction when he 7\n\nBrentano still uses the term ‘self-awareness’ in his Psychology, but only when quoting or referring to other writers he is discussing, e.g. Maudsley (p. 25, 27, 43), Horwicz (p. 36), Comte (p.40), Bain (p.59), Hamilton (p. 90), Lange (p. 133). Page references are to the 1874/1995 translation. 8 I have argued for such a literal interpretation in Brandl (2006). 9 The textual evidence supporting this claim is reviewed in Rollinger (2008).\n\nWhat is Pre-Reflective Self-Awareness?\n\n45\n\nis concerned with judgements that can be made only with a certain probability because they go beyond the content of our experience.10 Another feature of Brentano’s doctrine of intentionality that has caused some confusion is his restricted use of the term ‘mental’. Brentano applies this term only to conscious phenomena, i.e., to the realm of experience. No room is left in his theory for intentional states that are not experienced by the subject. But what about mental states that influence our behavior although we are not aware of this influence or even of their existence? Why does Brentano rule out that such states exist and that they can satisfy the criterion of intentionality? There is a simple historical explanation why Brentano had no eye for the unconscious. His Psychology belongs to the era before Freud and therefore still in the grip of the Cartesian conception of the mind according to which the mind is by definition aware of all its states. Brentano’s view would thus be fundamentally opposed to the functionalist conception of the mind that has recently replaced the Cartesian conception. Fortunately, we can move beyond this historical perspective and adopt a more charitable interpretation of Brentano on this point. Again, it is the internalist perspective that does the trick. This perspective is not incompatible with the functionalist view, which allows that intentional states may be conscious or unconscious. Adopting this perspective just means to give priority to states that are part of consciousness. This decision to give priority to conscious states can be justified by the fact experiences are commonly understood as the paradigmatic examples of mental states. If one takes this line, there is no need to deny the reality of unconscious states that are both ‘mental’ and ‘intentional’. Admittedly, this was not the line taken by Brentano, but it is a charitable way of “updating” his theory without doing damage to it. Having cleared the ground so far, I now turn to Brentano’s theory of inner consciousness. This theory is very complex and so I will present it in several stages. 3 The inner structure of conscious experience Intentionality is a characteristic feature of mental phenomena according to Brentano, but it is not the only one. Brentano discusses at length 10\n\nA simpler reason for this switch in terminology may be that everything is an object since the term ‘object‘ denotes the most general category in ontology. So why not call the immanent content of a mental act an object too?\n\n46\n\nJohannes L. Brandl\n\nalso a number of other features. Mental phenomena, Brentano claims, are also characterized by the fact that they are all based on a limited number of simple presentations, what Hume called ‘impressions’. Another feature is that all mental phenomena appear to us “as a unity”, i.e. as part of one consciousness (ibid.). And last but not least, they are all “perceived in inner consciousness” (Brentano 1875/1995, p. 91). This is not a random list for Brentano. In his view, all these features have a common source.11 Although Brentano does not put it this way, I think one can identify this common source as the internal structure of our experience. Intentionality is the most prominent feature of experience because it is so immediately connected with this internal structure. The other features require further analysis and may therefore be considered to be aspects of this structure that can be derived from its intentional foundation. Since the term ‘structure’ does not belong to Brentano’s own vocabulary, we need to make sure that our use of this term fits his theory. What could structure mean for Brentano? It must be something different from complexity, at least if we think of complex mental states as states that involve other states. Brentano insists that even the most elementary experience is “structured” by having distinctive parts. The example he often uses to illustrate this is the example of hearing a sound. Despite being the simplest experience one can think of, Brentano claims that it contains the following three discernable elements: a sound (= S), the hearing of a sound (= H), the inner awareness of hearing a sound (= A). This tripartite analysis of experience is the backbone of Brentano’s theory of inner awareness. The analysis itself, it must be admitted, is not very illuminating. One cannot use it to explain what inner awareness means since it would be circular to appeal here to a structure whose description makes use of this very term. The theory envisaged\n\n11\n\nThis may not be true for another feature that Brentano mentions, namely that we perceive mental phenomena as ‘unextended’. One might take this to be a reason to omit this feature from Brentano’s list.\n\nWhat is Pre-Reflective Self-Awareness?\n\n47\n\nhere will become informative only if some independent explanation is given what it means for an experience to be structured in this way. I will consider in the next three sections what Brentano has to offer to meet this challenge. Before I turn to that, however, let me mention an important point about Brentano’s view of perception. As the above example shows, Brentano’s analysis of perception contains an element that qualifies as a sense datum. It is the first element in the tripartite structure, which Brentano also calls a “physical phenomenon“, the sound S in the present case. Yet, Brentano’s theory is not a sensedatum theory that reduces perception to a relation between a subject and a sense datum. The very point of his analysis seems to be that more is involved in a simple experience than just being related to a sense datum. In order to hear the sound of the doorbell, for instance, one must not only be aware of the physical phenomenon, but also of the perceptual process which makes one aware of the sound. If one reduces experience to the presence of a sense datum, what is left is no experience at all. Hearing a sound would then be nothing more than receiving auditory information, like a blindsight patient receives visual information without seeing anything in the proper sense of the term. By generalizing this point about perception, we arrive at a doctrine that Tomis Kapitan has called ‘the ubiquity of self-awareness’ (see Kapitan 1999). In Brentano’s terminology this doctrine says that there is no conscious experience, which does not include within its structure the element of inner awareness. Thus we can see how the idea that all mental phenomena have a complex inner structure prepares the ground for a theory of pre-reflective self-awareness. 4 Primary and secondary objects In Book II of his Psychology, Brentano opens the discussion of inner consciousness by drawing attention to the inhomogeneous use of the term ‘consciousness’. He first sets aside the moral meaning of the term when speaking about feelings of guilt or conscience. Brentano’s concern is with the epistemic usage. Taken in this sense, he says, ‘consciousness’ refers to the immediate knowledge that subjects have of their own mental phenomena. This specific type of consciousness Brentano singles out by the term ‘inner consciousness’, which he often uses interchangeably with ‘inner perception’. At this point one might expect Brentano to give an account of firstperson knowledge as it pertains to our own mental states. But he treats\n\n48\n\nJohannes L. Brandl\n\nthese epistemological issues only in passing. Although he frequently refers to the self-evidence of inner consciousness, he does not say much about the source or the nature of this evidence.12 This lack of epistemological concern will play an important role later when I defend Brentano against the objection that his account of inner consciousness is simply an outgrowth of his Cartesian thinking. This said, I will set aside here the epistemological allusions that accompany Brentano’s text. I take him to make a plain grammatical observation about how we use the term ‘conscious’ when he says: “There are undoubtedly occasions, when we are conscious of a mental phenomenon while it is present in us; for example while we have the presentation of a sound, we are conscious of having it” (Brentano 1874/1995, 126). Reflecting on such an experience, we may ask ourselves: “Do we have several heterogeneous presentations or only a single one?” The natural response here is certainly to count two acts of presentation with two different objects: the sound (S) and the hearing of the sound (H). Brentano dismisses this answer, pointing out its phenomenological consequences: if these presentations were different, the sound would be presented twice over in a single experience. “Yet this is not the case”, Brentano says, “rather, inner experience seems to prove undeniably that [these two alleged presentations are connected] in such a peculiarly intimate way that its very existence constitutes an intrinsic prerequisite for the existence of [the presentation of the sound]” (ibid., 127). Although the argument has a strong Cartesian flavor, Brentano is picking up here an idea that goes back to Aristotle’s treatise De anima, a work he had examined in detail in his second academic thesis (Brentano 1867/1877). His point is that the question “How many presentations are involved when we are conscious of hearing a sound?” requires the same treatment as Aristotle’s question: “How many senses are involved in a perceptual experience?” Since only a single sense is needed, Aristotle concluded that the sense of sight is also the sense by which we are experientially aware that we see. (De anima, 425b13f.). Brentano then simply draws the further conclusion that only a single presentation occurs if only a single sense is involved. We must therefore assume that a single act of perception can 12\n\nBrentano addresses this question in his writings on truth and evidence. See Brentano (1930/1966)\n\nWhat is Pre-Reflective Self-Awareness?\n\n49\n\nbe directed simultaneously at two different objects in the tripartite structure of a single experience. But how is this possible? Here Brentano draws on another Aristotelian idea. While we are hearing a sound (S), he says, we also perceive the hearing of the sound (H) “incidentally” (en parergo). The sound may therefore be called the primary object of the experience, while the experience itself apprehends itself “alongside” as a secondary object. This is how the experience of hearing a sound now splits up into three distinctive elements, with the inner awareness of hearing a sound (A) accompanying the soun"
