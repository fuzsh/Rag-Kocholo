        "text": "“Fellas, I have 3,000 words to say. Quit screaming and start singing from your hearts.“-Murry Wilson, to the Beach Boys\n\n“Desert Song” by My Chemical Romance was originally supposed to be the final track of Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge. It is a quiet, heartfelt meditation on being a member of MCR and features minimal noodling from Ray Toro, prominent acoustic rhythm guitar from Frank Iero, and passionate vocals from Gerard Way. According to the band’s biographer, Gerard was drunk during the recording of this song so they have a very raw quality.\n\nFrom the first verse, “Desert Song” is a call to empathy for Gerard’s struggles with his addiction and mental health. He uses religious imagery like “the sword and the faith” to describe to difficult nature of touring, recording, playing on television, and dealing with a meteoric rise to fame before closing the verse with the killer line, “And did you come to stare or wash away the blood.” He knows that rock stars’ struggles with addictions can be used for entertainment, whether that’s Behind the Music, the nascent reality television genre (E.g. The Osbournes), or supermarket tabloids.\n\nHowever, Gerard wants his fans and listeners to empathize with him and use My Chemical Romance’s music to help them with their own struggles instead of gawking and laughing at him as he falls down a lot and vomits throughout the Life on the Murder Scene documentary that this song was packaged with. He describes this journey from touring to performing to hitting rock bottom in the poetic bridge of “Desert Song” where he sings “From the lights to the pavement/From the band to the floor/From backstage to the doctor”.\n\nIt’s raw autobiography without any genre fiction or characters to garnish it even though he does comment on MCR’s purpose when he says “From the Earth to the morgue…” Even if it isn’t together, Gerard and My Chemical Romance will continue to make music or art as evidenced by their various side and solo projects since the band’s breakup from The Future Violents and Electric Century to the rad covers that Gerard does with Mikey and Ray Toro for The Umbrella Academy TV show that he consults on and continues to make comics of. There is definitely a feel in “Desert Song” that My Chemical Romance would still exist as a band even if they were just playing basements and small clubs in New Jersey because it’s both an emotional and artistic outlet for the members.\n\nAnd speaking of emotional and artistic outlet, I would like to move the spotlight from Gerard pleading with the microphone, Toro doing little runs on his clean electric guitar, and Frank Iero’s steady acoustic strumming to myself. This project has been like an emotional cleanse for myself during the conclusion of a really difficult semester and time period. Until a couple days ago, I didn’t leave the house (Except for work and essentials.), and this project helped keep me in a good routine and creative state of mind. My Chemical Romance is a really fun band to write about because they have a sound that spans genres as well as a sense of narrative in their songs.\n\nProbably, my favorite part has been doing the background research on Gerard, Mikey, Frank Iero, Ray Toro, Matt Pelissier, Bob Bryar and producers Geoff Rickly and Howard Benson, and seeing how their personalities and interests connect with MCR’s music. Life on the Murder Scene was really a valuable resource and a must-watch for any fan who wants to get insight into the band’s early days. I love how My Chemical Romance discusses topics like grief, relationships, addiction, depression, and yes, death (We’ll see more of that in Black Parade.) using metaphors from literature and pop culture.\n\nIt’s something I do in my own life whether out loud or in my own head, and I think it’s why I really start falling in love with the band around when I started my English major and later my pop culture criticism career around 2011-2013. However, it’s nice to see them drop the theatrical makeup and epic plots and just sing a song about being in a band and their feelings about this in “Desert Song”. The acoustic guitar is a rare treat and a foretaste of the sonic diversity that MCR would display in The Black Parade and Danger Days showing that they weren’t content with chugging out ten of the same kind of song each record, but finding ways to expand their audience’s palettes and even attract new fans. (Danger Days might be the fabled bridge between poptimism and rockism, but we’ll explore that in a much later essay.)\n\n“Desert Song” demonstrates that My Chemical Romance is equally skilled at rockers and ballads as well as genre fiction and personal narratives. The track features some of Gerard’s most compelling vocals and show that Frank Iero is an old hand in the mosh pit as well as as the coffee house. It’s like the old adage that I just invented, “Sometimes, you want to write about vampires, superheroes, and sexy assassins, and sometimes you want to hand your still-beating heart to the audience.”\n\n“And if you gaze long into an abyss, the abyss also gazes into thee.”- Friedrich Nietzsche in Beyond Good and Evil\n\nIf 13 tracks of darkness, revenge, and macabre imagery by My Chemical Romance weren’t enough for you, then the Japanese edition of Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge and the 2006 live album/rarities compilation Life on the Murder Scene has the track for you. “Bury Me in Black” is just a demo, but it distills the id and emotions of the protagonist of Three Cheers into a sub-three minute metalcore track with growled vocals from Gerard Way, discordant guitars playing by Frank Iero and Ray Toro, driving bass from Mikey Way, and a touch of drum from Matt Pelissier. It’s violent, angry, confrontational, and perfect for howling out in your car after a long day at the office.\n\nGerard’s vocals are aggressive in “Bury Me in Black” alternating between deep roars and a theatrical tenor, and he has some iconic moments like his deranged delivery of “Pick up the phone, fucker” and the emphasis he puts on the word “shotgun” in the second verse. He is completely in character and ready to gun down 1,000 souls if it means being with the women who loves. But he also kind of hates this someone and the difficult situation she has put him through that ends in his own demise.\n\nThis emphasis on the “hate” part of the love/hate relationship shows up when Gerard sings “I wanna see what your insides look like/I bet you’re not fucking pretty on the inside” to Toro and Iero’s heavy metal guitars. It reminds me a lot of the 2016 Netflix/Sanrio anime Aggretsuko where a normally cute red panda office worker screams her insecurities and hatred for her day job at the karaoke bar after work. Sometimes, you need to get these negative feelings out, and creating stories or making music is a great outlet for that.\n\nHowever, deep down beneath all the assassinations, gun fights, prison assaults, and general ghoulishness, Three Cheers is a dark, star-crossed love story thankfully bereft of Romeo and Juliet references. (Macbeth gets the nod in this record.) Gerard plays with the double meaning of “insides” as both emotions and entrails and wraps up the song with death metal yell of “I wanna save your heart/I wanna see what your insides may be…” The protagonist’s motivation for his violent actions is still the woman he loves, and even though they do funereal music videos and feature both macabre imagery and lyrics, MCR is about saving lives and bringing hope starting with its members.\n\nSo, “Bury Me in Black” has a purging or therapeutic effect and is My Chemical Romance at its loudest, most id-driven, and rawest thanks to the stripped down production of the demo. It’s also a reminder of path not travelled where MCR decided to embrace their metal and posthardcore roots instead of going the neo-classical rock and finally pop rock route. This is totally speculation territory, but maybe they would have ended up more niche artists than capturing a wide audience of everyone from emo kids to boomers dusting off their Queen records as well as both metalheads and poptimists.\n\nEither way, it’s cool to see My Chemical Romance try out a different kind of sound (Especially in Gerard’s vocals) and turn in some fucking intense lyrics in “Bury Me in Black” as a kind of coda to the Three Cheers era.\n\nTomorrow, we’ll look at one more Life on the Murder Scene track before finally advancing to The Black Parade.\n\nThe early history of My Chemical Romance is deeply intertwined with The Used a post-hardcore, pop punk band from Utah. The Life on the Murder Scene documentary and several interviews establish the often homoerotic friendship between MCR frontman Gerard Way and The Used lead singer Bert McCracken. My Chemical Romance’s manager Brian Schechter was The Used’s tour manager and had them tour together several times, which built the bond between Gerard and McCracken. Other than their cover of “Under Pressure” by Queen and David Bowie, their final connection was that MCR’s second drummer, Bob Bryar, did sound for The Used while the were on tour.\n\nAround this time, Bert McCracken and Gerard forged a fast, if a little crazy friendship that may have been the inspiration for the lyrics of “You Know What They Do to Guys Like Us in Prison”. McCracken sings backup vocals on that song, but he would take over co-lead vocal duties on “Under Pressure”, which started as a live cover featuring members of The Used and My Chemical Romance. It morphed into a studio recording in 2005, was a part of both the rock and Hot 100 charts, and its proceeds went to a tsunami relief fund. The song was released both as a separate single and as a bonus track of the re-release of The Used’s second, breakthrough album In Love and Death.\n\nMikey Way is relegated to tambourine during the live performance of “Under Pressure” so The Used’s Jeph Howard handles the band’s iconic bassline. Ray Toro, Frank Iero, and Quinn Allman are on guitar while Bob Bryar and Branden Steineckert are on the dueling drum kits. However, this song is really a showcase for Gerard and Bert McCraken’s complementary vocals and general chemistry that can be seen in their offstage joking, and yes, smooches. Freddie Mercury and David Bowie were rock and roll icons to queer kids, outsiders, and misfits in the 1970s and 1980s, and Gerard Way and Bert McCracken played the role in the 21st century and cemented it in “Under Pressure”, which features what producer Howard Benson said were some of Gerard’s best vocals ever.\n\nGerard definitely hits the high notes in “Under Pressure”, and his performance is soaked with emotion. Blending nicely with these vocals is McCracken, who even though The Used is classified by some as a screamo band, sings in a smooth, warm tone to match Gerard’s energy as he hits the final part of the song and starts screaming while Toro, Iero, and Allman’s guitars get epic. It really feels like Gerard and McCracken are trying to outdo each other vocally, and it captures the fun and “jamming good with Weird and Gilly” (Had to throw in a Bowie reference.) feel of the live version.\n\nMy Chemical Romance and The Used’s cover of bisexual smash hit “Under Pressure” is a worthy homage to two of MCR’s greatest influences, David Bowie and Queen, and is a set-in-wax time capsule of the relationship between Gerard Way and Bert McCracken as they supported each other in their early days of fame.\n\nThis version of “Under Pressure” is also for charity and great to sing at karaoke too! Sometimes, in the midst of crafting complex concept albums, it’s nice to just rock out to you favorite songs with your friends, who happen to be multi-platinum recording artists. Now kiss!\n\n“I took Punk to be the detonation of some slow-fused projectile buried deep in society’s flank a decade earlier, and I took it to be, somehow, a sign.”-William Gibson in A Cultural Dictionary of Punk: 1974-1982\n\nAs a rule, My Chemical Romance didn’t play a lot of covers, but when they did, they were homages to artists that were major influences on the band’s sound and lyrics. For example, in 2005, they contributed a cover of “Astro Zombies” by fellow-New Jerseyans and horror punk band Misfits to the Tony Hawk’s American Wasteland soundtrack. The cool thing about the American Wasteland soundtrack was that it featured contemporary punk bands covering classic ones like The Stooges, Black Flag, Bad Brains, The Buzzcocks, and of course, The Misfits. Also, the album cover was an homage to London Calling by The Clash, but with a skateboarder, of course, showing the timeless connection between skating and punk rock.\n\nAlso, while doing research for this essay, I found out that the first two Tony Hawk Pro Skater games (Which I pray every day will be remastered for the Nintendo Switch.) were integral to MCR building chemistry in their early days as a band and perhaps even responsible for Frank Iero joining the band. In an interview with Loudwire, Gerard Way talks about the game “connected us on a social level”, and that they had been playing Tony Hawk for several years before the formation of My Chemical Romance. At that time, they also shared a practice space with Iero’s band Pencey Prep and would play against their members. I’m definitely speculating, but without the Tony Hawk game, Frank Iero might have never joined MCR and made their punk influences more pronounced with his rhythm guitar playing and backup vocals.\n\nMy Chemical Romance’s cover of “Astro Zombies” is very faithful to the Misfits’ original from their 1982 debut album They Walk Among Us, except with cleaner production values and Ray Toro getting to bust out a mini solo during the outro. Gerard even channels the tenor part of Glenn Danzig’s vocal register. Iero’s rhythm guitar playing is very prominent during the verses and the catchy, Ramones-esque chorus of “All I want to say/And all I gotta do” while Mikey Way and new drummer Bob Bryar keeps the rhythm section, fast and loose.\n\nWhile MCR was influenced by the Misfits’ heavy, yet melodic punk sound, they were probably more influenced by the subject matter of their songs. “Astro Zombies” gets its title from a 1968 B-movie of the same title about a scientist, who was fired by the government’s space department, so he creates zombies out of murder victims, who go on a rampage. The Astro-Zombies was shot in 2 weeks on a $37,000 budget, and like all good B movies, it was panned by critics. But it achieved a kind of immortality by being the inspiration for this great 1980s punk single that became a great 2000s punk single whose lyrics are the plot of the film aka “Prime directive, exterminate the whole human race.”\n\nThrough songs, albums, and a record label named and based on their favorite horror and exploitation movies, the Misfits helped cement a template for artists to use their favorite pieces of pop culture as the subject matter of their music. My Chemical Romance would definitely follow this template with songs about vampires, zombies, assassins, bisexual prisoners, and Western gunslingers appearing in their first two records alone. Then, with Black Parade and Danger Days, they wouldn’t just sing and play as these characters, but become them.\n\nHowever, sometimes MCR would take a break from red and black formalwear or the marching band uniforms to play songs by bands that they love like “Astro Zombies” by The Misfits. Now, excuse me, I’m going to be humming this song under my breath the entire Thanksgiving dinner\n\n“The stars move still, time runs, the clock will strike/The devil will come, and Faustus must be damn’d.”-Faustus in The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus by Christopher Marlowe\n\nMy Chemical Romance wraps up their second (and breakthrough) album Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge with the ode to hitmen and doomed heroes and heroines that is “I Never Told You What I Do for a Living”. The track also concludes Three Cheers‘ story arc with the protagonist going from looking forward to a reunion with his lover to descending into Hell during a chaotic Ray Toro and Frank Iero guitar-driven breakdown part. Gerard Way screams like a bat out of hell while Matt Pelissier and Mikey Way play out his fall.\n\nWith its subject matter and even its sprawling, multi-part structure, “Living” definitely evokes shades of Bullets‘ album closer, “Demolition Lovers”. However, like the other songs on Three Cheers, Howard Benson brought discipline and focus to MCR’s initial posthardcore sound and emotionally vulnerable lyrics and makes the ending of this record very satisfying. He knows when to unleash Iero’s punk energy, when to lay back and let Ray Toro noodle a little bit in the spaces between the sounds, and matches it nicely to Gerard’s powerhouse vocals and Pelissier and Mikey’s rhythm section.\n\nFrank Iero is like the meter of a poem keeping the verses and storyline running at a steady clip. He and Mikey demonstrate good chemistry during the first post-chorus part where Gerard reveals the ending of the story and softly sings, “And never again, and never again, they gave us two shots to the back of the head, and we’re all dead now.” It’s the buildup to the crescendo as Toro’s clean strumming and Pelissier’s percussion jump into the mix as Gerard’s vocals get more raw, and the lyrics go from hook-filled to pure feeling as he yelps, “I tried”.\n\n“I tried” is definitely a callback to “Demolition Lovers”, which is all about the protagonist and his lover getting gunned down. This leads to the infamous deal with the devil for 1,000 souls so he can be reunited with her. It’s also a great way to describe the underlying theme of “Living” and Three Cheers as a whole. As evidenced by the guilt-ridden lyrics, violent imagery, and of course, heavy sound of the album, the protagonist did everything in his power to be reunited with his lover. However, he should have read Doctor Faustus or Macbeth, which this song directly references (“The kind of dirty where the water never cleans off the clothes.”), or really any vengeance-driven tragedy to know what was in store for him. (The Romans loved them.)\n\nSo, the big ending to the Three Cheers‘ storyline is that after killing 999 souls, the protagonist must kill one final evil soul: himself. This was confirmed in a 2004 interview with Gerard although he didn’t have an ending in mind while recording the album. The protagonist falls into this Atreid (The ancient Greek family, not the one from Dune, which I’ve never read or watched.) cycle of constant revenge that can only be broken with his own death and damnation. He tells himself that he is just doing it for the woman he loves, but he ends up being addicted to the “bodies he claim” so he doesn’t get a happy ending.\n\nAnd in a just, moral universe, he really shouldn’t even though it’s kind of sad that a character we’ve kind of been rooting for throughout Three Cheers doesn’t achieve happiness. Although, this concept album is ostensibly about two lovers trying to be reunited with each other, it’s really about a man’s descent from being a good, decent person into being wholly consumed by revenge like Edmond Dantes, V from V for Vendetta, or even some incarnations of Gerard’s favorite superhero, Batman. “Living’s” lyrics echo this sentiment with lines like “I fall out of grace” and the slightly more erotic “… I’m so dirty, babe”.\n\nThe protagonist has taken so many lives that he’s beyond any kind of redemption, and you can definitely feel this in Gerard’s vocals throughout “Living”. His voice howls, wails, and general flows with the squeal of Ray Toro’s lead guitar and descends into bloodcurdling screams during the aforementioned epic breakdown where Frank Iero’s rhythm playing takes center stage. Like Faustus, the protagonist pleads for another night away from damnation, either to bring even more souls to the devil or just to spend one last day with his lover before he’s in Hell for all eternity. Later, Toro starts playing the song’s melody line, which allows for extra anguish and what Genius.com calls an ad-lib part from Gerard as he wrings every ounce of emotion out from the lyrics.\n\n“I Never Told You What I Do for a Living” is a darkly poetic ending to the story and album of Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge. My Chemical Romance is totally synced up and focused with each member getting a key moment like an actor stealing a scene in an epic film. It also features an utterly tragic vocal performance from Gerard, who is free to “strut and fret his hour upon stage” and tell a heartbreaking story while Ray Toro, Frank Iero, Mikey, and Matt Pelissier shred and play their hearts out.\n\nMCR makes music for rocking out and bawling your eyes out (Sometimes at the same time.) Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge album cemented this reputation while also introducing the band to a wider audience. MCR’s sound, storyline, and visual image would only get more complex and theatrical while making damn good songs, which I will touch upon in my upcoming coverage of the legendary Black Parade album.\n\nDon’t worry, I’ll be covering a couple 2005-2006 era B-sides and rarities first so you’ll have a few days to dust off your old drums and marching band uniform.\n\n“Oh, I used to write a lot of sad ass songs.”– Dolly Parton in Dolly Parton’s America podcast\n\nContent warning: alcoholism, drug addiction, suicide, self-harm\n\nIn “Cemetery Drive”, My Chemical Romance follows the tried and true soft verse and loud chorus structure to spin a tale of grief and loss. However, they switch up the instrumentation that drives each part of the song like a superhero team comic (E.g. JLA, written by Gerard Way inspiration Grant Morrison) where the writer splits a squad into groups to give them more of a character-driven focus while solving a big crisis.\n\nSo, this song starts with a drum intro from Matt Pelissier, and his percussion along with Mikey Way’s bass and Ray Toro’s pluck-y picking drive the verses. Then, Frank Iero and Toro’s bigger, louder guitars drive chorus while Mikey gets in a little more of a groove. During the post-chorus “Way down” part, Gerard hits one of his signature wail parts like someone mourning their lover as Iero plays a downbeat rhythm riff like a grave being dug. With the raw lyrics and guitar part, the emotions bleed into the sound.\n\nPelissier’s funereal drum and Toro’s clean guitar picking plus a bonus bell sound from Howard Benson’s keyboard really focus your attention on Gerard’s vocals and “Cemetery Drive’s” lyrics. He juxtaposes the death of his lover with the grief he feels and tries to cope with by singing depressing songs and drinking by her gave. We know that he’s drinking alone because he “…walk[s] the dead in a solitary style.” Even though MCR is telling the story of Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge‘s protagonist’s internal motivation for taking 1,000 souls to be reunited with his wife, there could be a bit of autobiography in this one because Gerard had a problem with alcoholism around the time of the making of this album and the subsequent, extensive tours the band did after to promote it.\n\nAs mentioned in some earlier essays, Gerard talks about his drinking (That would later lead to cocaine use) in the documentary Life on the Murder Scene with the help of his manager Brian Schechter as well as in a frank 2005 cover story interview with Spin. To get in the mood to play such a dark character as the protagonist of Three Cheers, Gerard “…would drink from when [he] woke up until set time” and even wore his red, black, and leather costume plus the corpse paint makeup off-stage.\n\nThe interview and lots of information about Gerard cast him as a introverted comic book artist before he became My Chemical Romance’s frontman. Therefore, it makes sense that the insane stress of dealing with his grandmother’s death (The inspiration for “Helena”), the intense and theatrical nature of touring, and getting into such a dark character’s headspace wore on him. Gerard turned to drugs and booze to cope until Schechter staged a couple interventions after he had suicidal thoughts after doing cocaine at pre-fame Killers show and vomiting for 45 minutes after a bender before a big show in Japan.\n\nI’ve given these biographical details because “Cemetery Drive” seems like it’s not just Gerard and MCR sketching a character and his motivation. They’re also putting some of their own demons and inner feelings onto the track trapped in the wax like a jinn in a bottle and “singing songs that make you slit your wrists.” The verses might have a softer sounder, but they deal with some dark subject matter that could be about the protagonist facing death to take out the souls, MCR struggling while on tour (Gerard’s intro to the live version of this song alludes to this interpretation.) , and the agelong question of whether humans get what we deserve in the end.\n\nThree Cheers’ protagonist’s grief for the woman he lost soars into the chorus along with Gerard’s powerful tenor voice, Mikey’s louder-in-the-mix bass, and Frank Iero’s guitars. “Cemetery Drive’s” chorus is simple and raw: a simple “I miss you” with the lyric “the collision of your kiss” hinting at the intense and passionate relationship of the two lovers as well as the suddenness of our protagonist’s partner’s passing. Gerard really holds those notes and vocals to accentuate the feeling, and it definitely feels more like an acting performance than a rocker singing a sad ballad. There’s no distance between the character and performer, and interviews, like the aforementioned Spin one, and other during the Three Cheers seem to confirm this as Gerard’s method acting approach to recording this album and playing it live took a toll on him.\n\nReading about and watching Gerard’s addiction is super sad, and I’m glad that he got help, became sober, and is a happy, comic book writer and father now. However, “Cemetery Drive” is a marker of darker times for him, and My Chemical Romance, who underwent a lot of turmoil in this era as they went from playing basements in New Jersey to going on big domestic and international tours thanks to the commercial success of Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge. Part of that success came this catchy soft/loud Howard Benson sound that still gave a chance for Gerard, Mikey, Ray Toro, Frank Iero, and Matt Pelissier to showcase their unique skill sets as well as lyrics that anyone who has struggled with losing someone, depressions, or any kind of addiction could relate to.\n\n“Cemetery Drive” doesn’t provide any answers to these issues, but it did show that someone else was going through them too.\n\n“For some folks death is release, and for others death is an abomination, a terrible thing. But in the end, I’m there for all of them.”- Death of the Endless in Sandman, written by Neil Gaiman\n\n“It’s Not a Fashion Statement, It’s a Deathwish” is both mine and Gerard Way’s favorite track off Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge. And that monster Ray Toro intro guitar riff plus the quote from my favorite arc of Sandman, “Brief Lives” (Think American Gods with less padding and gorgeous Jill Thompson artwork.) were what got me to fall in love with it. According to Gerard on Twitter, this was one of the first songs My Chemical Romance recorded for Three Cheers. This is why (Even more so than “Hang ‘Em High”) it feels like a kind of intermediate stage of evolution between MCR’s sound in Bullets and Three Cheers. It’s like a musical Wartortle.\n\nHowever, this isn’t a bad thing as Toro and Frank Iero play heavy and loud with no time for solos or pretty instrumental breaks, and Gerard goes into the scream register of his vocals, which is why he said that this is a difficult song to play live for him. It definitely feels like he’s wrestling with the Grim Reaper and not the kind, Goth woman version of Death from Sandman, whom he quotes in the opening lines of the song and states the fact that we basically only have a single life to live so make it count. (I was so close to writing “Yolo”.)\n\nAs a Sandman and MCR fan, the harshness of the quoted line gave me pause because Death of the Endless is portrayed as sweet and kind in the comic. Throughout the series, you see her make the process of dying as natural and painless as possible unless you’re a really messed up person. However, Gerard’s vocal delivery corresponds with the storyline of Three Cheers, which is the story of a man that defies death to be with the woman he loves.\n\nThis also connects to the title of the song, which is also a cheeky jab at emo/scene style as well. (Maybe, Goth because all-black and Death of the Endless.) The protagonist of Three Cheers wears dark colors, not because he want to be a cool kid, but for stealth purposes because if he rocked florals, then his soul would be taken, not vice versa. “It’s Not A Fashion Statement, It’s a Deathwish” also connects to another theme of the record: grief and loss. Black is the color of mourning, and Gerard and Mikey Way had lost their grandma, hence, a funeral music video for “Helena” and the black and red formal wear like they’re attending one. (It also matches the color palette of the album art, but they, there’s layers to this.)\n\nThis song is about defying death and taking revenge, but there is also a weird sense of hope throughout the song from Gerard’s vow “to avenge my ghost” and the line “I’m taking back the life you stole.” He’s addressing the Death personally and saying that he can cheat them (Or her if we’re doing the Sandman.) if he kills enough evil doers. During the chill bridge part toward the end where Iero’s guitar is meditative for once, there are even lyrics about clawing out of one’s grave.\n\n“Fashion Statement” was written early in the Three Cheers so that line could have been treating like a big opening scene in a horror or revenge film. The protagonist was killed at the end of “Demolition Lovers”, but he’s back for vengeance in the sequel even if everything has changed. A parallel for me would be Buffy’s resurrection in Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Six when she gets back not quite correctly in a magic rite performed by Willow. The protagonist certainly doesn’t live a happy, normal life, but a dark, violent. However, he experiences such hardships that “paint these walls pitchfork red” for a chance to be with the person he cares most about.\n\nAll in All, “Fashion Statement” is like the angsty teenage years of My Chemical Romance before they went off to college in Three Cheers, got their doctorate in Black Parade, and published an off-beat, yet compelling monograph in Danger Days with Conventional Weapons acting as peer-reviewed articles to enhance their profile. (I work in academia so bear with me.) It has that DIY, Eyeball Records feel, but you can tell that Howard Benson directed the band to center the track around that iconic Ray Toro and Frank Iero riff before cutting them loose to do their revenge/romance/stare down Death storyline.\n\nThere is a real story arc to this song culminating in a sweet “fade-out” outro where the protagonist understands that he’ll be with his lover even if he fails his mission because he himself will be dead. Like the folks that Death visits in Sandman and her two solo comics, he relents and gives into the “sound of her wings” because he knows he will have rest and peace after his hard, dramatic life.\n\n“It’s a hell of a thing, killing a man. You take away everything he’s got, and everything he’s ever gonna have.”– Bill Munny (Played by Clint Eastwood) in Unforgiven, written by David Peoples\n\nEnnio Morricone meets I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love in “Hang ‘Em High”. This is My Chemical Romance’s take on the spaghetti Western genre and also revisits their raw posthardcore sound from their previous record with a distortion-filled guitar break from Ray Toro and Frank Iero and screamed vocals from Gerard Way. And the proverbial cherry on this punk rock sundae is that Keith Morris, the frontman of Black Flag, contributed backup screams on the bridge and outro. Iero got him to appear on the song by cornering him at a gas station, which is punk as fuck.\n\nThe sound and lyrics of “Hang ‘Em High” complement each other nicely even if the structure of the song is looser than the hookier one on Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge. Mikey Way’s bass sounds like the rumble of cattle being driven to the next, and Matt Pelissier’s drums are the plod of their hooves. Toro and Iero’s guitars are a bit faster like cowboys galloping into the sunset as the credits “fade to black”. The fuzzy noise and effects from these guitars are like the extra violence and buckets of blood in Sergio Corbucci’s (Django) Westerns. Or to use a more musical reference, Toro’s guitar is like the guitars in the music from the Dollars trilogy, but a little more heavy metal while Frank Iero contributes fast, jagged riffs.\n\nHowever, the chorus takes a clearer sound as Gerard articulates his feelings from the perspective of Three Cheers’ protagonist. (Take it from this Unforgiven fan, revenge and Westerns go together like peanut butter and jelly.) He tells his lover that if he fails to get the appropriate number of souls, it’s okay to move on with her life, bury the past, and “don’t look back”. Conversely, the protagonist is also a bit of a hypocrite because he “won’t stop” and “put it down” and will keep murdering the “shotgun sinners” and “wild-eyed jokers” that populate this album until he is reunited with her. Death is not the end for him, and he will never find peace or move on.\n\nTo circle back to Unforgiven, (“Hang ‘Em High” takes it name from a much earlier Clint Eastwood Western.) Three Cheers’ protagonist has lived a life of violence and can agree with Bill Munny that “We all have it comin’ kid.” The stylized language of “Hang ‘Em High” and anguish and venom in Gerard’s vocals definitely paint a picture of an old gunslinger, who’s made enemies, seen some shit, and is ready to take all those sons of bitches with him on the way to Hell. And when he arrives, he hopefully will be reunited with the woman he love because unlike Eastwood, MCR doesn’t shy away from the star-crossed romance goodness.\n\n“Hang ‘Em High” is a faster, louder Western that conveys the storyline of Three Cheers in under three minutes with genre trappings that fit its theme. It features some wonderful production flourishes from Howard Benson like the cinematic whistles that transition directly into Ray Toro and Frank Iero’s speed-playing and adding Morris to the vocal mix to make everything rawer and more intense. The song doesn’t have a clean outro like most of the other tracks on this record, but ends in a cacophony of gunfire, er, guitar noise.\n\n“I’m free to be whatever I choose, and I’ll sing the blues if I want.”-“Whatever” by Oasis\n\nEven though it was only released as a single in the U.K. where it charted at #71, “Thank You for the Venom” has truly become a fan favorite My Chemical Romance. Kerrang listed it at #2 on their list of best MCR songs, it was included in the setlist for their 2019 Los Angeles reunion gig, and Alt Press put it on their list of best guitar riffs of the 2000s. And that monster Ray Toro riff is one of many reasons why we’re still geeking out over this song 16 years after its release.\n\nA great guitar riff skips the brain and goes straight to your heart and soul. Hence, all the involuntary responses to one like humming along (Very badly in my case), head banging, and of course, air guitar, which is something Gerard Way has done in live performances of this song during Toro’s solo. The intro of “Thank You for the Venom” also shows the killer chemistry between Toro and rhythm guitarist Frank Iero with Toro playing the fast, melodic parts and Iero dropping the hammer with the heavy bits before Mikey Way’s bass and Matt Pelissier’s drum kit kick in. Also, this riff is so iconic that it returns for a few seconds during the outro to symmetrically round out the song.\n\nI could go on all day about Toro and Iero’s playing, but “Thank You for the Venom” also has incredible, basically band-defining lyrics for My Chemical Romance and reinforces that they both transcend the emo scene and are a life saving band. Speaking of the life saving, it’s fitting that Gerard plays with a Morrissey song lyric in this track’s first line, singing “Sister, I’m not much a poet, but a criminal.” As a member of MCR, Gerard might write poetic lyrics that you want to get tattooed on your skin forever, but playing the protagonist of Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge, he’s a murderer even if he only kills evil people and is motivated by the loss of the woman he loves. (It’s really fitting that “Jack the Ripper” by Morrissey is the B-side of this single because it’s also sung from the POV of a less sympathetic murderer.)\n\n“Thank You for the Venom” is filled with these theatrical, concept album elements, especially when My Chemical Romance continues to run with the religious imagery from “Interlude”. In the second verse, MCR throws in three, maybe four Biblical references to the curse of Cain, Mark of the Beast, the serpent in the Garden of Eden, and possibly even the crucifixion. This symbolism has been used everywhere from Beowulf and the poems of Lord Byron to Vampire the Masquerade, and of course, Iron Maiden, who were a big influence on MCR, both sonically and lyrically.\n\nThe images paint a picture of a protagonist, who has been screwed over by a higher power with the loss of the woman he loved, and now he has to “Hallelujah, lock and load” and shoot his way out of everything with his trusty handgun. (It’s fitting that the next track on the album is the Western-inspired “Hang ‘Em High”) The cracks are starting to show, and the protagonist is beginning to doubt that he will complete his mission and be reunited by his lover as evidenced by the line, “You’re running after something you’ll never kill.”\n\nThe protagonist thinks that he’ll be like Cain, the first murderer in the Old Testament, and will be forced to hopelessly wander the Earth with a mark on his forehead that protects him from harm, but reminds everyone he comes into contact with that he introduced the taking of human life into the world. Or he will be a symbol for the end of the world, like the Beast of Revelation. (And be fodder for conspiracy theories and justification for bigotry for millennia.) From what I’m saying about Three Cheers‘ protagonist and storyline, “Venom” seems like a song about hopelessness. However, when viewed in the light of the context of My Chemical Romance as a band and their impact on the rock and emo scenes, it is actually hopeful (and a bit cheeky.)\n\nMCR directly addresses the critics, “the rock establishment” (Whatever the hell that’s supposed to be.), and the bands that they’ve been lumped in with and compared to in “Thank You For the Venom”. “I won’t front the scene if you paid me” shows that despite their commercial success that they want to be something more than the “saviors of rock music” or the band that got emo on MTV. (This is explored in a 2004 interview that has great insight about My Chemical Romance’s early days.) They don’t want to make the same record every time or have the same imagery, and MCR would follow up on this promise with the vastly different sounds and looks of The Black Parade and Danger Days. (I mean, look at Gerard going from black to white to red hair color.)\n\nTheir appearances on Emo Nite playlists aside, My Chemical Romance never wanted to be a nostalgia act, but an artist like The Smiths, Queen, or hell, even Iron Maiden (See the popularity of classic metal bands in the E-girl subculture.) , who transcend scenes and boundaries and had an impact on their listeners. When “Venom” is played live, there’s kind of a call and response between Gerard and audience on the line “Give me a reason to believe.” Going back to the early days of the band and its roots in the tragedy of 9/11, MCR was formed so Gerard could really have something to live for and share that with others, and Mikey, Ray Toro, Frank Iero, and Matt Pelissier bought in to this as well. (See Toro and Iero’s backup vocals at the end of the song combined with their guitar playing to create a full, rich sound.)\n\n“Venom’s” chorus could be read to be about addiction again, and I definitely think the line about the “doctor” is about Gerard’s use of anti-depressants before he became addicted to alcohol, pills, and later cocaine. But I think it’s a more positive message with My Chemical Romance acting as a kind of “sin-eater” (Ooh, more religious imagery.) to their listeners and giving them an opportunity to feel less alone and like outsiders through their music.\n\nBecause if you can believe in My Chemical Romance and their cathartic and honestly life changing music (Plus cool guitars.), maybe one day you’ll be able to believe in yourself. (I keep telling myself that.)\n\n“How long to sing this song.”- “40” by U2 from War\n\nWhen I initially plotted out the Disenchanted series, I planned on combining “Interlude” and “Thank You for the Venom” into essay. But, then, I may have semi-collapsed under the stress of writing 19 essays in 19 days plus comic book reviews and Mandalorian recaps, and did I mention that I have a full time job as an academic librarian in the middle of a pandemic. So, for the good of everyone, I decided to split “Interlude” and “Thank You for the Venom” into two essays, vibe out, and gather my thoughts about this stripped down 57 second track of mournful Gerard Way vocals, Ray Toro picking, and darker strumming from Frank Iero.\n\nMy Chemical Romance dips back into the Catholic iconography in “Interlude”, and this song takes the form of a brief prayer. The protagonist appeals to “saints”, “angels of the Lord”, and “angels of the unknown” to protect the woman he loves while he continues on his mission to take 1,000 souls and be reunited with her like the blood-stained lovers on the cover of the Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge album. He wants some higher power to have his back while he does unconscionable deeds.\n\nIt reminds me a lot of the first present-day scene in Daredevil Season 1, Episode 1 where Matt Murdock tells his priest, “I’m not seeking penance for what I’ve done. I’m asking forgiveness for what I’m about to do. Yeah, Catholic confession doesn’t work that way, but Murdock like Three Cheers’ protagonist already knows that his actions will create grief and trauma for him. Also, Gerard is totally a Daredevil fan as evidenced by a really sad tweet from 2016 about losing a friend, who introduced the character to him.\n\nDaredevil truly is the urban vigilante with Catholic guilt. Just like MCR with “Helena”, some of his most emotional moments happen in churches. These include being nursed by his long lost mother-turned-nun Maggie in the famous Frank Miller/David Mazzucchelli (A professor at Gerard’s alma mater, School of Visual Arts) “Born Again” arc, or when he watched Bullseye kill his love, Karen Page, in Kevin Smith and Joe Quesada’s “Guardian Devil”. Ultraviolence, dead women showing up in their stories, and dark imagery are something that the Man without Fear and My Chemical Romance draw on and sometimes even poke fun of. (Bits of the Mark Waid run, “Vampire Money”)\n\nSo, “Interlude” is a kind of mental break before the main character does acts of violence as well as a chance for MCR to show their softer side before immediately launching into the speed punk of “Thank You for the Venom”. Honestly, we needed the break after tracks about the loss of a relative, being abused in prison, mass murder, addiction, and just missing someone you love. It’s like taking a drag on a cigarette (or a sip on a Diet Mountain Dew like yours truly) after a long day at work and preps listeners for the aggression (and fun genre pastiches) of the back half of Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge.\n\nI think the message of “Interlude” is that it’s okay to not always be in control, and you and call on a higher power for help even if faith is like a fuzzy spiritual connection (i.e. “unknown angel”) and not something that completely rules your life. Also, you can break down the big Homewrecker burrito of an essay into two manageable ones because with their storytelling chops and large reference pool, it’s easy to delve deep into a My Chemical Romance track even if it’s less than a minute long and only features Gerard, Ray Toro, and Frank Iero. (Honestly, that lineup sounds a lot like Gerard’s recent solo songs/covers to promote the Umbrella Academy television show.)"
