        "text": "Why did Gerard and frank iero broke up?\n\nThey were never together. This rumour was started by fans who liked seeing them kissing onstage. They have said their onstage kissing is to challenge homophobia in the audience. ---- I disagree, I believe they were together but thought they were better off friends. No one is really sure if them being together was a rumor or not. ---- Frank has said he has been with his now wife Jamia since he was a teenager - before he met Gerard. And up until 2006 Gerard was with a girlfriend he had before the band. Neither member has ever said they were bisexual at all. I think people just like the idea of them being together but it's really very unlikely that they were ever together. --- \"very unlikely.\" Still a possibility. We dont really know what happened.\n\nWhat are the names of my chemical romance?\n\n. Frank Anthony Iero - Rhythm Guitar. Gerard Arthur Way - Lead Singer. Mikey (Micheal) James Way - Bass. Ray (Raymond) Toro - Lead Guitar. Matt Pelissier was the original drummer, and co-founded the band with Gerard and Mikey Way, but was replaced by Bob Bryar sometime during 2004. Bob Bryar (Robert Bryar) was their drummer through the three cheers and black parade era, but after a disagreement they decided to part ways, later to be replaced by Mike Pedicone recently Pedicone was caught red handed stealing from MCR during their honda civic tour with Blink-182, they DID NOT press charges, but he was KICKED OUT so there are only 4 true members of My Chemical Romance Frank Gerard Mikey Ray"
