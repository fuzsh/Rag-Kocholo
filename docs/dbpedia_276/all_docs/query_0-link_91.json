        "text": "The Wonder Years really did come out swinging adn changed an entire genre.\n\nThe band went from a local joke-easycore group to leaders of a wave that altered the course of the scene. How did they did it? And where did it all come from? And where are they today? Tyler breaks down the band's entire history on the latest episode of the Note To Scene podcast.\n\nAlso this week we have new music to talk about from Architects and Yungblud, who has a new track with MGK and Travis Barker. And of course there is this week's radio rundown.\n\nListen and subscribe to the show on iTunes, Spotify and Stitcher. And check out the show's Spotify playlist here."
