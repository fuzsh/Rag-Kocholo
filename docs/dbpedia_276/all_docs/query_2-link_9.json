        "text": "What is the Online Entry Process and how does it work?\n\nMarking the first step toward participating in the GRAMMY Awards process every year, the annual Online Entry Process is the period when registered Media Companies and Recording Academy Members (both Voting and Professional Members) can submit music and works for GRAMMY consideration at the 2025 GRAMMYs.\n\nWhile the total amount of entries varies each year, the Recording Academy can receive more than 20,000 eligible entries during a GRAMMY season. Once we receive submissions, each entry is individually and manually vetted by a member of the Recording Academy's Awards staff to determine its eligibility.\n\nAfter submissions are received during the Online Entry Process, the Recording Academy's Voting Members vote on said submissions across two GRAMMY voting rounds: First Round Voting determines the nominees for the majority of the categories at the annual GRAMMY Awards, while Final Round Voting determines the ultimate GRAMMY winners.\n\nThe full participation in our annual GRAMMY Awards process — from the Online Entry Period to Final Round Voting — on behalf of the Recording Academy's Membership and the music industry at large is crucial to maintaining the integrity of the GRAMMY Awards, music's only peer-voted honor.\n\nWho can submit entries during the Online Entry Process?\n\nOnly registered Media Companies and Recording Academy members (Voting and Professional) can make submissions for GRAMMY consideration through the Online Entry Process.\n\nThe Recording Academy defines a media company as a legitimate business entity whose core business function is to create, aggregate and promote audio and/or video content for multiple artists for commercial purposes, and that must have verifiable product in national U.S. commercial distribution on our approved streaming platforms within the current eligibility period. It cannot just be an imprint in name only for a single or small number of artists.\n\nWhen does Media Company registration open?\n\nMedia Company Registration for the 2025 GRAMMYs is open now and closes August 23 at 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET. Existing or new Media Companies may register here. Media Companies will receive further information by email pending registration approval. Reference the Online Entry Process resources for more information.\n\nWhen does the Online Entry Process open?\n\nThe Online Entry Process for the 2025 GRAMMYs opens today (Wednesday, July 17) and closes Friday, Aug. 30, at 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET.\n\nIMPORTANT: There is only one round in which to make entries during the Online Entry Process. We encourage everyone to submit their entries as early as possible so that the Recording Academy's Awards team can assist with any questions in a timely manner. If a recording is not formally submitted, it cannot be considered for a GRAMMY Award or a GRAMMY nomination.\n\nWhat is the eligibility period for submissions for the 2025 GRAMMYs?\n\nThe eligibility period for the 2025 GRAMMYs is for recordings released Sept. 16, 2023, through Aug. 30, 2024. All releases must be available for sale, via general distribution, to the public by this date and through at least the date of the current year's voting deadline (final ballot) to be eligible for the 2025 GRAMMY Awards.\n\nHow do I submit recordings and releases for the 2025 GRAMMYs as a Recording Academy member?\n\nRecording Academy members, follow these steps to submit your music and releases during the Online Entry Process for the 2025 GRAMMYs:\n\nLog in to your Recording Academy Member dashboard and find the Submit To Online Entry Process button on the left side of your dashboard\n\nOnce logged in, please review the available resource documents and begin making your entries\n\nMake sure you submit your entries by the deadline: Friday, Aug. 30, by 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET\n\nHow do I submit recordings and releases for the 2025 GRAMMYs as a registered Media Company?\n\nRegistered Media Companies, follow these steps to submit your music and releases during the Online Entry Process for the 2025 GRAMMYs:\n\nVisit the Entry Process & Registration Updates Page\n\nClick MAKE ENTRIES HERE (will direct you to entry site)\n\nSelect MEDIA COMPANY LOGIN\n\nOnce logged in, please review the resource documents and begin making your entries\n\nMake sure you submit your entries by the deadline: Friday, Aug. 30, by 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET.\n\nWho can vote for the 2025 GRAMMYs?\n\nEach year, GRAMMY winners and GRAMMY nominees are determined as voted by the Recording Academy's Voting membership, which is composed of music creators, including artists, producers, songwriters, and engineers. Registered Companies are not permitted to vote in the GRAMMY Awards process.\n\nLearn more about our GRAMMY Awards voting process and the full GRAMMY Awards process.\n\nHere is a list of all the key dates for the 2025 GRAMMYs:\n\nSept. 16, 2023 – Aug. 30, 2024\n\nProduct Eligibility Period\n\nThe period by which recordings are submitted for GRAMMY consideration.

Underscoring the Academy's commitment to inclusivity and representation within the music industry, the 2024 New Member Class of invitees is 45% women, 57% people of color and 47% under the age of 40. With this year's new member invitees, the Recording Academy is on track to achieve its goal of adding 2,500 women Voting Members by 2025; the Academy is set to achieve this milestone later this year, one year ahead of schedule\n\nA comprehensive report on the Recording Academy's 2024 New Member Class, along with a detailed breakdown of the overall membership demographics and crafts, will be released later this year following the deadline for 2024 invitees to join the Academy. See the 2023 New Member Class and overall membership update.\n\nNew member invitations must be formally accepted by invitees by Wednesday, July 31, for recipients to become Recording Academy members and participate in the Online Entry Process (OEP) for the upcoming 2025 GRAMMYs, which will take place Sunday, Feb. 2, live at Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles. Through OEP, members can submit recordings, music videos and other eligible content for GRAMMY Award consideration. Individuals invited as Voting Members who accept their invitations are eligible to vote for the GRAMMY Awards, with the first voting ballot opening on Friday, Oct. 4, and closing on Tuesday, Oct. 15. Learn more about some of the key updates set to go into effect at the 2025 GRAMMY Awards, officially known as the 67th GRAMMY Awards, including adjustments to eligibility criteria, Category renaming, submission guidelines updates, and more.\n\nThe invitations extended today offer each potential new member an opportunity to power the Recording Academy's mission of cultivating the well-being of the music community, celebrating artistic excellence in the recording arts, advocating for human creators' rights, investing in music's future through the GRAMMY Museum, and supporting music people in times of need through MusiCares. Recording Academy Voting Members — made up of artists, songwriters, producers, and engineers active in the music industry — are eligible to vote for the annual GRAMMY Awards, ultimately determining the outcomes on Music's Biggest Night and shaping music history.\n\nThe Recording Academy's membership invitation process is community-driven and peer-reviewed annually, focusing on two types of membership: Voting Membership for music creators and Professional Membership for music business professionals. (GRAMMY U is the third type of Academy membership and follows a distinct application process.)\n\nEach year, interested musicians and professionals must apply for membership by March 1. Their submissions are reviewed in the spring by a peer review panel composed of existing Recording Academy members active in the music industry. If approved, candidates are invited to join the Recording Academy.\n\n2024 New Member Class invitees and those interested in Recording Academy membership are encouraged to join our newly launched New Member Class broadcast channel to learn more about the Recording Academy and membership-related updates.\n\nLearn more about the Recording Academy's membership and membership requirements.
