One of the very few artists to have charted top 10 records/albums in SIX decades, he may not have been the most talented singer in history (Nat King Cole, Jackie Wilson, Billy Eckstein, & Al Jolson come to mind) but NO ONE had an across the board appeal like Frank!

Hope you'll be at Cropedy with the rest of us.\n\nSimon is a very underated singer and his voice just seems to get deeper and richer as they years go on.\n\nUnfortunately, I never seem to get to Cropredy, even though I've promised myself year after year. Something always seems get in the way - lack of money, lack of time, etc.\n\nI have seen them several times at various venues, mainly as Acoustic Fairport. The strange thing about them is that I can't decide which is their best song. But it must be said that when they perform Meet on the Ledge, it always brings a lump to the throat. That's probably their equivalent of Hey Jude. Simon's voice has a strangely hypnotic value.\n\nTheir concerts are always good, mainly for the following reasons:\n\nThey're usually on stage for about 2 hours (or more!)\n\nThey vary their material.\n\nThey always have time for their fans - both during intervals and after a concert.\n\nand most importantly:\n\nThey always pick venues with bars! ;D\n\nTom\n\nPost by peridot44 on\n\nadmin said:\n\nperidot44 said:\n\nWell, maybe nasal whine was a bit strong but really I found his voice to have a very 'nasal' quality to it and a hard edge I didn't like at all.
