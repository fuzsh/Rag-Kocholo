        "text": "I think that having an emo phase should be a necessary rite of passage into young adulthood. Change my mind. Seriously though, I confess that my so-called “edgy” teen years really opened my eyes to a whole new word of music, culture, crazy fans, etc. I found others that shared the same passion for music as I do as we found solace in the same lyrics. This emotional and quite over the top music established a solid basis for me to grow and explore other music that I initially wouldn’t have been interested in. And so, I’m taking it back to the old days with the band My Chemical Romance…\n\nHonestly, if you google the word “emo music” the first search and images that pop up are of the band My Chemical Romance. Their songs are charged with energy, sadness, angst, relief, and are pretty much a good remedy for whatever you’re feeling. Even though they come with this association of singing about depressing themes or teenage rebellion, their collection of songs is quite impressive and definitely ingrained in time. Although I seemingly poke fun at their music following this stigma of being emo, they have significantly spearheaded the revolution of bringing this genre of music into the mainstream music world. They made a name for themselves in the musical community, and have steadily maintained this throughout the years despite having been broken up for years.\n\nOnto the background, My Chemical Romance is an American rock band from Newark, New Jersey that was formed by frontman Gerard Way and drummer Matt Pelissier shortly after the 9/11 attacks in 2001. This tragic event was actually the reason why Gerard Way was moved enough to start a band and the song “Skylines and Turnstiles” also documented his emotions about this event. The name of the band was suggested by bass guitarist Mikey Way (younger brother of Gerard) who was working in a Barnes & Noble when he was struck by the title of a book by Irvine Welsh named Ecstasy: Three Tales of Chemical Romance. Later the band added two more members: Frank Iero and Ray Toro and started building its fan base through MySpace before signing with a major label. To this day My Chemical Romance has released four albums with the most recent one being Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys (2010). The band has also experienced some ups and downs as they formally broke up March 22, 2013. However, the band reunited outside of the public eye in 2017 and recently announced a North American tour in 2020."
