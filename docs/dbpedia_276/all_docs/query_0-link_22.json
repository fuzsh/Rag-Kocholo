        "text": "I have a list. Actually, I have many lists. One list is my favorite songs currently. A whole nother list is my favorite bands ever… of all time. A whole nother list after that is my favorite songs ever… of all time. You get the idea. But one list I haven’t made yet, is one that has my favorite bands to see live in concert. Well that ends today. Last December, I got the brilliant idea to write about 31 songs in 31 days. It amounted to writing about one song a day for the month, from December 1st to 31st. That song a day for a month idea, translated into writing about a song a day for an entire year this year! That project is on Day 336 of 365 and is closing in the grand finale. While I don’t really have a surprise like the 31 songs in 31 days project last December, I am going to try to have a whole nother post to go along with the daily Song a Day for a Year project post.\n\nSo that’s where this post comes in… it’s a list, because everyone loves lists. As I mentioned, I do have musical artists and bands I love to go see in concert and have seen those artists and bands multiple times in concert. Keep in mind, this is subjective (clearly) and my opinion only. It’s also not a ranking nor is it a contest. Just because I have one artist/band at 1 and a whole nother at 10, means nothing. I’ll give my overall opinion on each based on a few factors (and some random voodoo bullshit advanced baseball mentions). So, without any further interruption and talk of musical philosophy, here is a list ten of my favorite musical artists/bands to see in concert.\n\n1. Arkells\n\nThe Arkells hail from the Great White North, Canada. Their sound has evolved greatly this coming on to the scene, going from early Hall and Oates to more modern Hall and Oates. Their version of blue eyed soul can only be described as “black and blue eyed soul). An Arkells concert is akin to a religious experience for some. For me, every time I’ve seen them live, it’s been a [redacted] amazing show. The energy that Max Kerman and company bring to the stage is incredible. It’s so much dynamic energy, the band could power a large American city by themselves. Max and co., definitely know how to work an audience. Whether it was the Rally Cry hotline where fans of the band could call in (toll free) and rest a song be played at a show in their city; jumping up on a bar top at Underground Arts while singing a song; leading a conga line through the crowd; having “doctor’s notes” ready to go for random fans to give to their bosses; asking fans to join them on stage to play guitar or saxophone or sing along to a song… the list goes on. While the sound varies from venue to venue, they sound amazing live, even better than they do in studio. Every show was different, extremely fun and exciting and the band made sure the atmosphere reflected that. Also in a related note, that cover of ABBA‘s Dancing Queen with The Greeting Committee was legitimately perfect.\n\nOVERALL OPINION: It’s time to join the Nondenominational Gospel Choir of Philadelphia the next time the Arkells are in Philly.\n\n2. Dave Hause and The Mermaid\n\nWhat do get when you take one of the best of Philadelphia’s hardcore punk scene and some of the best all-star musicians around? You get Philadelphia ex-pat, Dave Hause and his band, The Mermaid. Dave Hause, in my ever so humble opinion is to be considered Philadelphia Springsteen. His ability to write songs and turn them into personal experiences for the listener is second to none. That’s what his concerts are like… even giant-ass music festivals. Hause manages to make them feel, well, intimate… like we’re having a one-on-one conversation through music. And that’s just his unplugged shows. His plugged-in shows are, for lack of a better pun, electric. He ratchets the energy up to 11 and makes a weekday night seem like a Saturday night. The strange irony is, I have a whole nother artist on this list to thank for me discovering just how awesome Dave and company are live.\n\nOVERALL OPINION: Shout out to Tommy Conwell for getting me hooked on Hause’s music. That said, well worth the price of admission… and the lost voice. An intimate affair with electric guitars… even with a couple hundred strangers.\n\n3. The Wonder Years\n\nIf you are looking for a whole nother local band that bring the heat and energy, look no further than, The Wonder Years. The Wonder Years are one of the biggest names in pop punk today. Vocalist Dan “Soupy” Campbell is to be considered Philadelphia Springsteen as well, in my humble opinion. His ability to craft songs that are highly relatable to every listener is second to none. Their shows are close to that level. Every show of theirs I’ve been too has been packed… the energy level was through the roof. I’ve only seen them a few times, but every time has been an amazing experience. I’ve lost my voice every time, shouting along to the songs. My feet would ache from jumping up and down when certain songs would play. Much like the the first two bands, The Wonder Years are definitely worth seeing again (and again).\n\nOVERALL OPINION: This band comes out swinging from a South Philly basement with raw energy and power; well worth the sore vocal chords from shouting along.\n\n4. The Menzingers\n\nScranton’s native sons and Philadelphia’s adopted sons, The Menzingers are a blast to see live. If you are looking for pure badass energy and kickass music, look no further. Once again, The Menzingers are a whole nother band where I found myself no only having an awesome time, but losing my voice. Their shows are raucous and loud, but extremely fun. Much like every other band on this list, I found myself at the end of the set or show leaving with a big cheese-eating grin on my face because of how happy I was.\n\nOVERALL OPINION: One of the first bands to leave me smiling at the end of the show for how happy I was. 100% needs to be seen live for the full experience that the studio can’t reproduce.\n\n5. Kayleigh Goldsworthy\n\nIf you are looking for the true definition of a BAMF when it comes to stage presence and command, look no further than Syracuse, New York native and Philadelphia’s adopted daughter, Kayleigh Goldsworthy. I’ve seen her play with Dave Hause, Frank Iero, and other artists… and holy carp is she a badass all-star musician. I’ve never experienced a show that intimate have such energy. That said, you’re going to tired of hearing me say this by the end of this post but it needs to be said… she is definitely worth seeing live. Would’ve saw her play live in Philly earlier this year (September/October, I think) if it wasn’t for my work schedule.\n\nOVERALL OPINION: when the most Philadelphian musician in the city isn’t even from here… that’s the time of energy and ethic her shows bring to the table. You get excellent quality over quantity compared to other artists and bands.\n\n6. The Interrupters\n\nThe Interrupters are an exciting band to see live. First off, this a band that does ska right. Seriously, you can never go wrong with ska. Or ska-punk for that matter. The energy level from the band just set the stage for the rest of evening…. and that’s what I want to see, feel, and hear. I want to be energized and ready to party and hot damn did they bring the noise. This was definitely a band I lost my voice shouting and singing along to.\n\nOVERALL OPINION: This is a band to see live if you love ska and want to have a fun time cranking, skanking, and singing the night away.\n\n7. Valencia\n\nValencia is still one of my favorite local bands. They were the kings of pop punk for a time. Their music is infectious and catchy while maintaining an edge to them. Much like fellow Philly compatriots, The Wonder Years, Valencia‘s shows were (and are!) packed with energy. It’s a positive energy. I can’t begin to tell you how many times I’ve gone to see a band in concert and the energy from the band and the crowd is negative. Every time I’ve seen them play from basement shows to the TLA and elsewhere, it’s always been a blast seeing these guys live in concert.\n\nOVERALL OPINION: Long live Valencia! There’s always a place in the crowd for you with this band.\n\n8. The Gaslight Anthem\n\nThe Gaslight Anthem were always an excellent show to see in person. The energy, the lights, the sound, the crowd, it was like entering a different world. I only wish that they didn’t go on semi-permanent hiatus. Seriously, Brian Fallon‘s stage presence and command is second to none. I was fortunate enough to see a show during their last reunion tour. It was spectacular; every one was moving or bouncing along to the music and good times were being had.\n\nOVERALL OPINION: The Gaslight Anthem? More like The BOSS-LITE Anthem, amirite? Bruce Springsteen puns aside, The Gaslight Anthem was well worth traveling to New Jersey to see.\n\n9. My Chemical Romance\n\nI get that as I got older, I was “supposed” to age out of enjoying pop punk. But in reality, I never did. Guess it wasn’t just a phase, mom. That said, My Chemical Romance was always a blast to see live in concert. The energy and music just drowning out all of life’s problems for two-plus hours for a night, is an incredible feeling. It was that type of experience I had. There is something about singing along to songs that you can relate to with others in the crowd, is comforting.\n\nOVERALL OPINION: Welcome back, MCR! I expect a sold out Wells Fargo Center or Lincoln Financial Field or Citizens Bank Park.\n\n10. Tommy Conwell and The Young Rumblers\n\nI was definitely one of the youngest people in the crowd at a concert my former elementary school teacher was playing. Who is my former elementary school teacher you may ask, humble reader? None other than Tommy Conwell. The dude had a number 1 Mainstream Rock hit in the late 1980’s, as well as an album that charted on the Billboard 200, oh and two top 100 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 (four top 25 Mainstream Rock songs total). That said, his concerts are a blast and a blast from the past. It’s amazing to see people of all ages, sizes, races, genders, etc. having a damn good time. Conwell can still rock. If you’re looking for maximum fun for your dollar, you can’t go wrong seeing Tommy Conwell play live in concert.\n\nOVERALL OPINION: Everything They Say Is True, Tommy Conwell is a true rocker and showman. Never a disappointed face in the crowd at his shows.\n\nConclusion:\n\nHere are ten of my favorite bands and artists to see live in concerts. Some honorable mentions include: the Foo Fighters, Rise Against, Paramore, Coldplay, Taylor Swift (yes, you read that right… but that is a whole nother story for a whole nother time), Yours Truly, Stand Atlantic, Modern Baseball, Avenged Sevenfold, Linkin Park, Volbeat, Billy Talent, and many more. I realize that I have most local bands and artists on here, but I’ve always been a big proponent of supporting your local artists, bands, and music scene. Of course, when your favorite band from out of town comes into your town, you go and see.\n\nThat said, here’s to being able to see our favorite artists and bands in concert again! \\m/\\m/\n\nGot Social Media?

The album was recorded during the fall of 2003 through February of 2004 and released on June 8 2004 through Reprise Records. The album peaked at number 28 on the Billboard 200 with singles I’m Not Okay (I’m Promise), Helena, and The Ghost of You peaking at numbers 86, 33, and 84 on the Billboard Hot 100 respectively. The album is certified three times (3x) platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America.\n\nThoughts on the Album\n\nALL RISE FOR THE HOT TOPIC NATIONAL ANTHEM! Oh wait, that’s My Chemical Romance‘s Welcome to the Black Parade. Well, today we’re dressing in all black, donning the black eyeliner, and the checkered vans shouting out at the top of our lungs, “I’M NOT OOOOOOOOOOOOKAYYYYYY!” Okay, maybe not that, we are checking out My Chemical Romance‘s sophomore album, Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge. This was one of those albums I accidentally discovered after seeing the music video for Helena on MTV2 back in the summer of 2004. 15 year old me was mesmerized by the sound and style of MCR. It was grandiose, it was loud and in your face, it was relatable. Needless to say, I had to have the CD and countless plays (and two CDs later), I still am enamored with the dark and grandiose cinematic sonic landscapes of Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge.\n\nAn album is like a Major League Baseball pitching staff. Every album needs an ace to open. The ace sets the tone for the rest of the album. Helena (So Long & Goodnight) is the premier opener of not just the pop punk and emo genres, but of the decade. It’s a thrashing goth rock ballad that was inspired from the death of frontman Gerard Way and his brother and the band’s bassist Mikey Way‘s grandmother passing away. While the fusion of a mournful ballad with lightning quick pop punk riffs is a bit messy and jarring at times, it is incredibly visceral. The infectious and titanic guitar riffs from Ray Toro and Frank Iero combine with an excellent rhythm section and Gerard Way’s powerful vocal delivery make for a song that does an excellent job at capturing the sadness of losing a beloved one. As Helena ends, the uptempo and high energy Give ‘Em Hell, Kid comes in and continues the pace that it’s predecessor made. Give ‘Em Hell, Kid sets the conceptual tone of the album. While this song may be or sound silly to some, it depicts the difficulties that lovers or significant others who take on a long-distance relationship with a devastating accuracy.\n\nOf course this album has several aces on it’s staff. The next one we here is the legendary, I’m Not Okay (I Promise). It’s the teen angst and back up Hot Topic National Anthem. It was literally one of the songs that helped me survive high school. It was a song that saved my life. It’s joyous instrumentation and rather lighthearted lyrics are incredibly relatable to anyone. It’s definitely an ace on this album… and arguably the best one too. It will always be a song I go back to and put on when I need a pick-me-up. Essentially, by taking a topic that all teenagers go through in life, acceptance/(not) fitting in/of lost love and blending it with Gerard’s trademarked emotional vocals, they crafted a true masterpiece. This is a song that will always define MCR for who they truly are.\n\nIf Helena (So Long & Goodnight) and I’m Not Okay (I Promise) are two of the staff aces on this album, The Ghost of You is number three. The Ghost of You is very different from the rest of the songs on the album. The Ghost of You drops the tempo down to mid-tempo and slows the pace a bit. It’s a pretty welcomed change of pace and very much a breather. One thing this song does touch is the railing guitars and explosive drumming, which is a great thing. With this track, you get a sense of maturity and darkness; highlighting a side of the band that’s not fast-paced, energetic, and angst driven. Gerard Way shows off some incredible vocal range here along with incredibly well-written lyrics. This combined with excellent work by the duo of Ray Toro and Frank Iero on guitar, create a sense of calm and order on the album.\n\nOverall, Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge is the magnum opus My Chemical Romance was looking for.\n\nConclusion\n\nI’M NOT OOOOOOOOOOOOOKAYYYYYYYYY! No seriously, I’m okay thanks to this album. Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge is one of the albums that helped me survive high school. It’s very rare that I describe an album as “epic” by Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge is just that: epic. An album that lands on the coveted “S-tier” on my hypothetical tier list of albums. You can always tell how influential an album is by it’s staying power. 16 years later, this album is still as strong and relatable as ever. Also, I just needed to mention that “I’m not o-fucking-kay” in the final chorus gets me every time (probably because of versatile of a word “fuck”/”fucking” is). But let’s be honest here, My Chemical Romance didn’t just open the door for new emo/pop punk bands, they also opened the door for future alternative rock bands; it is because of this album (among others in their discography).\n\nSo yes, let’s give three cheers for sweet revenge.\n\nGot Social Media?

Last time, we we had some loud and local Philly flavor with albums from Valencia and Modern Baseball. We welcomed the the zombie reincarnation of Queen with Foxy Shazam. Went retro with Mando Diao. Blurred the lines between emo, metalcore, and pop punk with A Day to Remember. Went balls-to-the-wall and all out with PUP. Discovered that Celtic punk can be played by a bunch of Swedes (and an Irish ex-pat) with SIR REG. Learned how to overcome our demons through the power of partying with professor Andrew W.K. And finally, chilled out with Lights.\n\nWith that said, let’s continue the countdown with number…\n\n40. The Flatliners – “Cavalcade” (2010)\n\nA “cavalcade” is considered a formal procession of people walking, on horseback, or in vehicles. While The Flatliners didn’t arrive in vehicles, their 2010 album Cavalcade provides a 12 song, 40 minute namesake. The album displays an immense growth from the band, branching out from their old skate punk roots into more melodic tunes. Straightforward melodic punk tracks like Here Comes Treble and Carry the Banner sit incredibly comfortably alongside mid-tempo tracks like Count Your Bruises and the effervescent Monumental. The production of the album is both slick and smooth with just enough rough and raw edges to appease the purists. Check out my review of The Flatliners‘ Cavalcade here!\n\n39. Tonight Alive – “What Are You So Scared Of?” (2012)\n\nOh hey, a female fronted band that’s NOT Paramore! I’ve said the following so many times on this blog, I feel like it’s old hat by now. But, for the uninitiated… I absolutely love female fronted bands, especially when it comes to pop-punk. The problem is, many female fronted bands get lumped together into one of two categories: Sounds like Paramore and Doesn’t Sound Like Paramore. So how is Tonight Alive different? Well their 2012 debut is pretty cot damn impressive. Frontwoman Jenna McDougall is like a one woman army with her vocal command and prowess. It’s an album that separates itself from an incredibly and exceedingly crowded pop punk scene. The opener, Eject, Eject, Eject! acts as an atmospheric catalyst for the anthemic and booming follow-up Breaking and Entering. The album is packed with soaring guitars, catchy hooks, and most importantly: substance. Check out my review of Tonight Alive‘s What Are You So Scared Of? here!\n\n38. Billy Talent – “Dead Silence” (2012)\n\nI’m pretty sure a lot of people will ask me, “why this Billy Talent album and not Afraid of Heights?” Well, this one has stuck with me for a while. It’s a marked change of style and progression from previous Billy Talent albums. First off, this band will always have a special place in my heart. Secondly, it’s a much more darker and heavier album. It’s an album that hits with the force of ten Fletcher Coxes and Chris Prongers. Swallowed Up by the Ocean is a hauntingly beautiful track that is every bit as brilliant as it is emotional. It’s one of the songs found on this album that perfectly showcases the new sound. It starts out all mellow and light, catching you by surprise, before gradually building into an epic piece of music. It’s an album that manages to incorporate every “era” of Billy Talent, as well as some new sound and style. Check out my review of Billy Talent‘s Dead Silence here!\n\n37. My Chemical Romance – “Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys” (2010)\n\nOnce again, emo/pop punk kings, My Chemical Romance were at it again, creating a whole nother behemoth of an emo/pop punk concept album. While not as good as say Three Cheers… or The Black Parade, Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys is pretty damn good. The narrative that album created is like it is ripped straight from plot of the anime movie Akira or from the anime Hokuto no Ken (lit.: Fist of the North Star). I have said before that I love grandiose and over-the-top albums, and this is it. It’s one of the favorite albums of the decade because of it’s narrative and the story telling. The songwriting is sharp and the instrumentals are crisp. The guitars act as buzzsaws on tracks like Planetary (Go!).\n\n36. The Chain Gang of 1974 – “Daydream Forever” (2014)\n\nContrast. One of the reasons why The Chain Gang of 1974‘s 2014 album, Daydream Forever is one of my favorites of the last decade is because of the contrast is provides to the rest of my music library. It’s chilled out, seemingly retrowave, that brings about a sense of 1980’s style nostalgia that hooks your ears and doesn’t let go. The album is full of these nostalgia-tinged beats that are both bolstered and showcased by the track Sleepwalking. One of my favorite things about this album is that the more times you listen to it, the more different things you pick on that you missed during a previous listen. Check out my review of The Chain Gang of 1974‘s Daydream Forever here!\n\n35. The Material – “Everything I Want to Say” (2013)\n\nOh hey, a whole nother female-fronted band that gets eschewed into the whole “Sounds Like Paramore” camp, but in reality is solidly in the “Doesn’t Sound Like Paramore” camp. The Material with their 2013 album, Everything I Want to Say brings a heavier and more alternative rock sound rather than pop punk. It’s one of my favorite albums of the decade because of the vocals of Colleen D’Agostino. And holy crap, are her vocals powerful. Her performance is powerful and commanding, putting on display a broad and incredible range. The first four tracks bring the listener in fast and hard, not allowing you to come up for air. The dual (and dueling) guitars on these tracks create this aural and sonic assault on the senses… in a good way. P.S. Tonight I’m Letting Go is definitely (and arguably) the best track on the album. Check out my review of The Material‘s Everything I Want to Say here!\n\n34. Johnossi – “Transitions” (2013)\n\nSwedish duo, Johnossi, is one of my favorite bands of all time. No one can turn an acoustic guitar into a primal sounding electric axe of doom, quite like John Engelbert. Engelbert’s effect pedals and pads and distortion effects turn an otherwise decent acoustic guitar into beastly and primal monster that melts faces off. This is showcased by the 2013 album, Transitions. It’s one of my favorite albums of decade (and of all time) because of how Engelbert and drummer Oskar “Ossi” Bonde can turn said acoustic guitar and drums into a fully fleshed out band. Tracks like Gone Forever is a hugely melodic and dark number whose chorus soars. How huge? Allow me to quote the philosopher Bryzgalov:”humongous beeg”. There is a contrast on this album. Whereas Gone Forever is dark and heavy, Everywhere (With You Man), is of more light subject matter but still brings the hard chugging guitar riff. I love the smattering of keys, synth, and piano which allows the band to fully flesh out their raw and primal sound. Check out my review of Johnossi‘s Transitions here!\n\n33. Beatsteaks – “Boombox” (2011)\n\nIt took me awhile to get into German punk rockers, Beatsteaks. By “awhile” I mean, I am always late to the party in discovering them. Their 2011 album, Boombox contains arguably my favorite song of all time, Milk & Honey. I say, arguably, because it constantly changes, but the one constant is Milk & Honey. Arnim Teutoburg-Weiß‘s vocals on the track are perfect, considering English is his second language. The guitar riffs and chords are solid, the vocals are crisp and sharp, the piano adds an excellent touch, and bass/rhythm section bounce brightly. It’s a “punk rock” album for the non-punk rocker. It’s one of favorites of the decade because it highlights a continuous growth by the band. This album is straight-forward and no-nonsense. Check out my review of Beatsteaks‘ Boombox here!\n\n32. BOY – “We Were Here” (2015)\n\nOnce again, it’s time to display a more softer side of my taste in music. BOY‘s 2015 album, We Were Here does just that. One of the reasons why I love this album is because of Valeska Steiner‘s vocals. Chills. Her vocals give me chills. She can hit a wide range of octaves and she can easily go from soft to loud. The album reflects on the duo of Steiner and bassist Sonja Glass‘ journey as musicians. It is an album that perfectly sets up the next album. It effectively channels their previous album while building on their sound. An ambitious and charming album that grew on me from first listen. Check out my review of BOY‘s We Were Here here!\n\n31. Rise Against – “Endgame” (2011)\n\nTime to close out albums 40 through 31 with one from one of my favorite bands, Rise Against. Their 2011 album, Endgame, is as socially conscious as it is loud. One of the reasons why I love this album is because of how the band shifts some of their trademarked intensity from the music to the message. It provides a rally cry or a calling card for the listener get off their butt and onto their feet to do something about the things that plague society. Endgame builds off of the massive Appeal to Reason and goes big and hard. While is less punk rock and more hard rock/alternative rock, that’s fine. A friendly reminder from the message of this album: All of the heavy distorted guitar riffs and raw vocals in the world don’t mean a cot-damned thing if you don’t have anything to say. Check out my review of Rise Against‘s Endgame here!\n\nThat’s it for part two of my favorite 50 albums of the 2010’s.

The album was recorded from April 2006 to August 2006 and released on October 23rd 2006 through Reprise Records. The album, is a rock opera that centers on a dying character with cancer known as “The Patient”. The songs tell the story of his death, his experiences in the afterlife, and his subsequent reflections on his life. The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 in 2006. The album is certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Lead single, Welcome to the Black Parade, is/was the band’s only top 10 hit, peaking at number nine on the Billboard Hot 100. Welcome to the Black Parade and Teenagers can be found on multiple Guitar Hero, Rock Band, and Rocksmith video games.\n\nThoughts on the Album\n\nDay 2 of our sixth year comes out swinging for the fences. The Black Parade by My Chemical Romance was arguably one of the biggest and important albums of the mid-2000’s. This album demands a lot from the listener and one can see how someone could dismiss it. The Black Parade is like a fine wine or art that one gets better and better given time and age. It’s a heavily intricate and detailed album that received regular play from me on my Sony PSYC Walkman CD Player throughout my junior and senior years of high school. It’s an album that embraces the glam rock theatrics of Queen while putting a modern punk rock/pop punk spin on it. It’s MCR‘s magnum opus.\n\nHere’s the thing. If you talk to any gambler or investor, they will tell you that with greater risk comes the possibility of greater reward. Think about it, if there were no downside to risk, we’d all be richer. What The Black Parade does is takes big risks and the rewards are massive. One of the reasons that there is such massive payoffs from the risks MCR takes is because of the musical influences. You can hear every single influence the band has ranging from Pink Floyd to Queen. Hell, you can even hear the theatrics of David Bowie to the anthemic arena rock of Bon Jovi. While the songs are influenced by many artists as such, there isn’t one specific artist that’s ripped off.\n\nCall it a “concept album”, The Black Parade is truly a rock opera. One that is in the same vein as The Who‘s Tommy or more recently Green Day‘s American Idiot or 21st Century Breakdown. You get a great look at just how theatrical the album will be with the opener, The End. which is a sub-two minute song. Frontman Gerard Way acts as a Master of Ceremonies of sorts in what is an effective great acoustic track. It’s a track that just builds momentum and explodes into the second track, Dead!. Dead! is a raucous rocker that serves as a perfect partner and accompanying piece for The End. Dead! breaks new ground as it takes Queen‘s stadium/arena style glam rock and crushes it with a melodic punk style. The album wisely, takes the rock aspect and soars it to new levels with This Is How I Disappear. This Is How I Disappear is one of the heaviest songs on the album and ironically, one of the most catchiest songs on the entire album. Take the seventh track, House of Wolves, you can see MCR show off some of their improvements from the previous albums. They are able to successfully (and subtly) adjust from punk rock influences to more arena style hard rock. They keep up the intensity, while showing off greater variety, influences, and accessibilty. A trait that not many bands have.\n\nOf course, the centerpiece of this behemoth of a rock opera is the fifth track and pseudo-titled lead single, Welcome to the Black Parade. It’s almost as if the first four songs of this album were building up to this moment. Welcome to the Black Parade begins with some subtle and effective piano and Way’s vocals before a marching band style drum line propels the song forward. The crunching power chords of the guitar kick around the one minute mark and heavy pounding of the marching drums power the song into an almost breakneck pace at around the two minute mark. It’s a track that patiently bides it’s time before letting the home run swing rip. And boy does it knock it out of the park. It’s got all the makings of a song that was heavily influenced by Queen (think We Will Rock You or We Are the Champions).\n\nThen there’s Teenagers and Famous Last Words, two tracks that have heavy mainstream play-ability. Teenagers is one of the most fun and catchy songs to listen to, despite it’s anti-youth message. I wouldn’t say it’s “anti-youth”, as much as it highlights what the older generations dislike about the younger generations. The guitars, heavy on distortion, absolutely power the song. It’s a song that you could easily find yourself singing along to. Famous Last Words, the true ending to an absolutely thrilling and wonderful album (not including the hidden track Blood), shows off some keen pop-punk/pop-rock hooks while being more of a hard rock jam.\n\nConclusion\n\nI was astonished back in high school when I first listened to this album. Most punk bands can’t put a complete album together, let alone half of one. What My Chemical Romance did with The Black Parade is simply amazing from start to finish. Many rock opera and concept albums fall flat, sometimes because of a lack of cohesiveness, sometimes from trying to do too much, or sometimes from trying to experiment too much. However The Black Parade is the complete package. It’s epic and spectacular.\n\nAnd if we are being completely honest with each other, there’s a scene kid within us all, just waiting to be embraced. And maybe, just maybe, be should be brave and embrace our inner scene kid and be bold like My Chemical Romance was with The Black Parade.\n\nTracks to Listen to: Welcome to the Black Parade, Teenagers, Famous Last Words, I Don’t Love You, and The End./Dead!\n\n(Next Post – Previous Post)\n\nGot Social Media?
