        "text": "Between his time in Pencey Prep, My Chemical Romance, and Leathermouth, among others, Frank Iero is a seasoned road dog. Now, he’s parting with some of the gear he used along the way.\n\nBeginning June 28 at 10 a.m. CT, Iero will host a sale on Reverb with fixed prices. That includes significant parts of 2000s history, with dozens of items up for grabs from his various projects over the years. Most significantly, he’s listing a Fender Telecaster 72 Deluxe Reissue that he played on My Chemical Romance’s The Black Parade tour and wants to “pass on to another deserving player.”\n\nRead more: 10 essential My Chemical Romance songs that encapsulate every era\n\nThere’s also a 1970s Ludwig Blue Vistalite drum set that was used while MCR wrote their final album, Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys, a Series 10 four-string bass that appears in his 2014 “joyriding” music video, and the first Les Paul he ever owned. “This particular LP was smashed during a Pencey Prep show,” he says of the item."
