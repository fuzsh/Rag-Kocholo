Listen at your own risk. This is NOT an episode of Ian‚Äôs Untitled Scene Show. Enjoy.‚Äù\n\nIan Hates returns for this ‚Äúspecial event.‚Äù with another surprise return. There‚Äôs nothing else to give away here, so you‚Äôre just gonna have to get a sense of humor and listen to this comedy scene episode on the comedy scene band I Prevail‚Äôs new album ‚ÄòTrue Power‚Äô! I won‚Äôt apologize unless they do!\n\nListen on one of the sites below or by downloading the episode:\n\nSpotify ü§ò iTunes ü§ò Stitcher ü§ò Google Play Music\n\nI was visited by the ghosts of Scene past, present, and future, and even though they agreed with all my opinions of the scene, the one thing they wanted from me was to stop trying to make everything perfect and just put out episodes without worrying about making them sound studio quality. So, here‚Äôs the end of 2020 episode with all the scars that the real 2020 has (i.e. no editing, you get what you get). No one seems to care when shows sound like it‚Äôs two guys in a bathroom stall and not humorous whatsoever, so why would you care that Dave is halfway across the country and there‚Äôs some background noise?\n\nAnyway, I‚Äôm hanging out with the Scene ghosts right now listening to From First to Last and talking about how terrible Alt Press is. Enjoy the jokes and please stay safe and healthy this holiday season!\n\nHappy Holidays!\n\nMerry Christmas!\n\nHappy New Year!\n\nStay Scene!\n\nBuilding another brand is tough.

Yes, it didn‚Äôt happen at the beginning of 2020, it happens at the end! To celebrate this oh so special of occasions, Dave put together his list of the worst scene albums of the decade! This is a really fun conversation, so go have some fun yourself and take a listen! Really, I think that‚Äôs all the hype you need.\n\nBig shout out to Rick, who helps anytime I need a promo image!

Ian and Dave talk about some of their favorite recent singles and then a ton of album reviews! Here‚Äôs a quick list of what you have to look forward to, including everything else going on in the scene:\n\nBroadside - Into the Raging Sea - Sharptone Creeper - Sex Death and the Infinite Void - Roadrunner If I Die First - My Poison Arms - Independent - EP Slaves - To Better Days - SBG Records S‚Äôefforcer - Lifeless - We Are Triumphant - EP Black Veil Brides - Re-Stitch These Wounds - Summerian In Hearts Wake - Kaliyuga - UNFD The Fall of Troy - Mukiltearth - Independent Curses - Chapter II: Bloom - Sharptone Year of the Knife - Internal Incarceration - Pure Noise Records Misery Signals - Ultraviolet - Independent\n\nIt‚Äôs time to talk a lot of awesome scene music and have some fun!

Which of Ian‚Äôs personalities are talking, Ian Scene or Ian Hates? He‚Äôll never tell! Wow, that‚Äôs dumb. Anyway, Dave returns for a brand new combination show where we talk all the scene news that‚Äôs important right now, including but not limited to: streaming shows, backing tracks at live shows, idiots on Twitter, reaction videos, and recent allegations.\n\nLots of strong opinions and hopefully some jokes are on the way.\n\nTRIGGER WARNING: Do not take jokes Ian and Dave say seriously. There is also a serious conversation about allegations in the scene. If you can‚Äôt handle a discussion and conversation on serious topics then don‚Äôt listen to this episode and check out Part 2.

Ian Hates (the bad one) and Ian Scene (the good one) welcome returning co-hosts Dave and Jackson as they take 32 of the most popular scene bands and whittle them down to‚Ä¶\n\nThe.\n\nSingle.\n\nWorst.\n\nCurrent.\n\nScene.\n\nBand!\n\nYou read that correctly.

If you like an open conversation with no judgements that may actually be thought provoking, then this conversation is for you. If not, you can skip it and go on to New Songs. The entertainment show, known as Ian Hates Music, is normally a comedy show, but the co-hosts try to be open and honest and sometimes that means covering the big stories that involve a sensitive nature.\n\nAnd New Songs talk from:\n\nBorn A New, Low Dose, AngelMaker, Whitechapel, Dayshell, Harm, Life Itself, The Damned Things, Our Last Night, New Idea Society, Belle, The Anchor, and Charlatan!\n\nAdd on album reviews from:\n\nAttila - Villain - Self-Release\n\nExitWounds - Visions - EP - SharpTone Records\n\nBlood Youth - Starve - Rude Records\n\nBoundaries - My Body In Bloom - EP - Unbeaten Records\n\nTo the Rats and Wolves - Cheap Love - Arising Empire/Nuclear Blast Records\n\nMinors - Abject Bodies - Holy Roar/Deathwish Records\n\nDeadships - D.O.A. - Stay Sick Recordings\n\nGhost Iris - Apple of Discord - SPV/Long Branch Records\n\nPlus, stuff and/or things and maybe some more!\n\nAlso, Ian has opened a Patreon to help with the costs of the many Ian Hates shows.
