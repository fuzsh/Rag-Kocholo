They’re back now with a new album, Overcome the Darkness. These albums are a two-part record which I think is a very interesting idea. It has probably been done before but I cannot remember that happening anytime recently. Overcome the … Continue reading Overcome the Darkness with Our Last Night\n\nHalloween Horror: The Silver Scream Edition\n\nBack at it again, the metalcore band Ice Nine Kills (INK) released their fifth album, The Silver Scream, on October 5, 2018. In the same vein as their last album, Every Trick in the Book, where every track was based on a different piece of horror literature, all 13 songs in The Silver Scream are based on a different horror film. It feels like a … Continue reading Halloween Horror: The Silver Scream Edition\n\n15 Spooky Songs for Your Halloween Playlist\n\nWith Halloween right around the corner, it’s time to start planning your party playlist.

Issues follows up Headspace with Beautiful Oblivion, a project that has either gained traction or been a swing and a miss with the fans. Kublai Khan TX builds off of the enormous campaign that was Nomad with Absolute. Plus, another new act has emerged on the scene and is loaded with potential. Read more … Continue reading Issues, Kublai Khan TX, & Just Like Heaven Kick Off October\n\nReview: “Nine” by Blink-182\n\nWhen Blink-182 released the first single off of their upcoming album, “Blame It on My Youth,” I wasn’t exactly impressed. I deemed it to be “a lackluster song that could’ve come from any pop punk band”. I hold Blink to a much higher standard when compared to their pop-punk cohorts, and as such I went into this with very low expectations. However, Nine as … Continue reading Review: “Nine” by Blink-182\n\nSustenance Torches ATL Death Scene with “Goddess”\n\nAtlanta’s own death metal up-and-comers Sustenance have obliterated the local death metal scene with their newest track, “Goddess”.

Since their debut album, Magnolia in 2013, Turnover has been placed within the emo/pop punk genre, especially with their popular, Peripheral Vision.

They released their second album Welcome Back to the Brodeo last August and are soon to go on tour promoting their new album. Recently, I had the opportunity to speak with Logan Burns (Guitar, Vocals, High screams, Keys/Strings) about their new album, some of … Continue reading Join the Brodeo with Scarlett O’Hara\n\nFlashback Reviews: Backtrack’s Bad To My World\n\nAs somewhat of a hardcore newbie, it’s been fun to branch out in my free time and dive into the history of hardcore. I recently watched the documentary Godfathers of Hardcore, which documents the rich history of New York hardcore act Agnostic Front. Agnostic Front is a massive component of what hardcore is today, along with the likes of Minor Threat and many other punk/metal … Continue reading Flashback Reviews: Backtrack’s Bad To My World\n\nOh, Sleeper Resurrects Metalcore with “Bloodied / Unbowed”\n\nOh, Sleeper is back at it again and puts out an instant metalcore classic in “Bloodied / Unbowed” Continue reading Oh, Sleeper Resurrects Metalcore with “Bloodied / Unbowed”\n\nToo Close To Touch and Lacuna Coil Headline New Releases + Announcements\n\nThe latest review on “F.I.N.E.” from Too Close To Touch.

Here’s why: Continue reading Live Review: Orthodox Is Next Level Hardcore\n\nAtreyu shows a softer side with “House Of Gold”\n\nFrom the early days of metalcore, Atreyu has been a constant, releasing albums on a regular basis since the release of Suicide Notes and Butterfly Kisses in 2002. For myself, and probably many others, that album was one of the albums that introduced me to the beauty that is hardcore and metalcore. The rest is history.
