They saved his life twice.\n\nWay is sitting in a Lost Angeles hotel room having just returned from the desert outside the city where he and his bandmates – lead guitarist Ray Toro, rhythm guitarist Frank Iero, bassist Mikey Way and drummer Bob Bryar – were making the video for Welcome to the Black Parade, the first single from the band's new album The Black Parade.\n\nHe is sporting a cane and a limp, courtesy of torn ligaments in his leg sustained while filming the video.\n\nHis once long, black hair is now cropped and bleached and, combined with his sharp threads, the effect is quite startling, making him look all the way a rock star and object of frenzied affection of millions of teenagers throughout the world.\n\nBut it wasn't always that way.\n\nWay says he was exactly the teen you might expect from listening to the angst-filled, rage-fuelled music that has characterised MCR's first two albums, I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love (2002) and the two-million-selling follow-up, Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge (2004).\n\n\"I was really quiet, I was very alone,\" he says.\n\n\"I didn't become popular until senior year when punk rock started to become popular.\"\n\nThe September 11 terror attacks galvanised Way and his bandmates into forming the group, with the hope of creating something that would not only be therapy for them but would have a more tangible effect as art.\n\n\"It saved my life because it was started out of that depression when I didn't have a purpose. I'm the kind of person that if I don't have a purpose, I'm dead,\" he says.\n\n\"I didn't feel like I had any control over my life and this gave me control back.\"\n\nAs the band's star rose, so did Way's depression and he took refuge in drugs and alcohol. Again, the band was his salvation when he beat his demons in mid-2004.\n\nTherein lies the band's appeal, particularly to the teen market, says Way. Far from revelling in and even exploiting teenage misery, as the band's detractors have charged, Way says the band gives a voice to those who feel they have none and speaks directly to their self-doubt and alienation. In short, the band understands them because they are them.\n\n\"There is something so honest about youth and I think that a band that is honest and sincere connects with that,\" Way says.\n\nMCR has made a giant leap for its third effort, a concept album that takes its cues from Queen's A Night at the Opera, Pink Floyd's The Wall and the Beatles' Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The central figure is the Patient, who is dying young of cancer.\n\nWay describes the album as an examination of mortality, with the premise that when you die, death comes for you in whatever form you like. In the Patient's case, inspired by a childhood memory of going to a parade with his father, death comes as a Black Parade, which is also the band's alter ego.\n\nMCR – with the guidance of producer Rob Cavallo, best known for his work with Green Day – have broken new territory sonically and thematically, with the band now poised to make the same leap forward as the pop-punk trio did with their own rock opera, American Idiot. Given the orchestral flourishes and theatricality abundant on The Black Parade, and a desire to find someone to push them further musically, Cavallo was at the top of the band's list of producers.\n\n\"His fingerprints are all over the record because he encouraged us to do whatever we wanted and he gave us all the toys,\" Way says. \"A really great example of that is Welcome To the Black Parade, which has 167 tracks.\n\n\"Another is Momma, where I was recording vocals and I said you know, what this needs is Liza Minnelli. And he said all right, and he got on the phone and got Liza Minnelli. The sky was the limit with every track.\"\n\nSo came about one of the most unlikely musical pairings since Shirley Bassey met the Propellerheads, but Way says that working with the Broadway veteran was a delight and an honour.\n\nMCR are preparing to hit the road for a world tour that will take the band to Asia and South America for the first time, and will include an appearance at the Big Day Out in January.\n\nlink to this article: http://www.news.com.au/sundaymail/story/0,23739,20574441-5003421,00.html\n\nDoctor Blind.:\n\nWhoop! I heard from my brother that MCR are going to be featured in the next issue of Guitar World! Took a peek at their site and saw it was true for myself as well. http://www.guitarworld.com. Kinda funny how it comes out on the American release date of the album too. :]\n\nAs for me, I shall definitely be reading the interviews, even though I don't play guitar. Simply because my brother does and he really wants to get this issue.\n\nhead1stforhalos:\n\nyou'll see Mr. Hodgson, you'll see...\n\nit's a link, btw.\n\nIt's also kinda funny that this is the only bad review on the album so far...\n\nJSharples:\n\nHey guys,\n\nThis my first ever post but I thought you might be into this. Basically I interviewed My Chemical Romance for Big Cheese Magazine (http://www.bigcheesemagazine.com) when they played Hammersmith and it's made the cover this month. Apparently it's the only big thing they're doing this month apart from the Kerrang thing. Just thought you might be interested is all and I've got to say, I'm pretty proud of it. Not sure how I link things on here, but you can check out the cover at www.myspace.com/bigcheesemagazine and order it online at www.bigcheesemagazine.com - it hits the shops proper this weekend. I hope you guys don't think this is a blatant sales thing - I love this band to bits and will be posting a lot more stuff on this amazing site - got a bunch of live photos and some other stuff that I'll be more than happy to post if anyone wants to see them and can tell me how? Hope that's cool?\n\nCheers,\n\nJim\n\nImNotOkay3505\n\nSalute You in Your Grave\n\nAge: 31\n\nGender: Female\n\nPosts: 2765\n\nOctober 18th, 2006 at 05:27pm\n\nthank you!\n\nfabulous killjoy.\n\nModerator\n\nAge: 32\n\nGender: Female\n\nPosts: 46256\n\nOctober 18th, 2006 at 06:25pm\n\nCharliebitmyfinger.\n\nSalute You in Your Grave\n\nAge: -\n\nGender: -\n\nPosts: 2575\n\nOctober 18th, 2006 at 09:44pm\n\nExellent!!! you rock!\n\nnoxx\n\nThinking Happy Thoughts\n\nAge: 33\n\nGender: Male\n\nPosts: 534\n\nOctober 19th, 2006 at 07:42pm\n\nDoes anyone know if they will be in the cover of AP?

We’re actually a very hopeful and celebratory band and very much about empowerment.\n\n“People fear death but on this record we’ve looked at the fantasy of death and its reality.\n\n“When death comes for you — we believe it comes in the form of your strongest memory and for The Patient, this was a marching band — The Black Parade.\n\n“Death is something we as a band faced head on. When mine and Mikey’s grandmother died, we began to look at death and the after-effects.\n\n“She had been very instrumental in this band as not only was she responsible for my singing career, she was our biggest supporter.” It’s clear that Gerard is a man who takes his art very seriously. He famously cut off his long black locks, bleaching his hair a yellow-tinted blond, to “get into character” as The Patient, attempting to look like a cancer-stricken man who had undergone chemotherapy.\n\nDressed in military uniform and smoking cigarette after cigarette, Gerard says making the record was a very dark time for the band and they actually became another one — their alter-ego The Black Parade, answering and playing gigs under this guise.\n\nThey even recorded tracks in a haunted studio at Los Angeles’ famous Paramour Estate where Gerard was attacked one night by what he believes was a spirit.\n\nHe says: “I suffered from anxiety and I was only getting three hours sleep a night. One night I woke up and felt like I was being strangled.\n\n“It was something that inhabited the place. I had been writing notes every night and that night I wrote, ‘We are all just a Black Parade’. I thought it would make a great album title.\n\n“However I never expected so much attention, headlines even, because of the change in the way I looked,” he claims. “But it was a strong form of resignation against pre-conceived notions of how we look and how we are. We became a different band.\n\n“We’ve always looked according to our music. And we’ve always based what we wear on living the music.\n\n“This is no different. I was resigning from that look saying this isn’t going to be a fashion show anymore — hence the uniforms and change in hair.” An intense, dark and theatrical record about mortality, The Black Parade marks a new sound for the emo rockers compared to their previous breakthrough album, Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge.\n\nGerard says: “This album is a rock opera. We don’t really see ourselves as emo though we are proud to have opened doors to bands who are different.\n\n“When we first started we couldn’t get booked on to shows as we were the opposite of everything that was emo — we’ve never really seen ourselves as that type of band.\n\n“Now we are proud to be bringing a sense of theatre to rock as we like to see bands do that. Bands like Panic! At The Disco make us happy. We want to see people push the genre.”\n\nOn the record, My Chemical Romance experiment with a new direction, including piano and strings.\n\nControversial track Cancer is a stripped down, piano and vocal driven number which includes string arrangements.\n\n“It’s an epic and poetic track,” says Gerard, “which we also think is the darkest most brutal song we’ve written about a horrendous disease which The Patient has suffered.”\n\nAnother track, Mama, sees legendary singer and performer Liza Minnelli lend her vocals.\n\nGerard reveals: “We are big fans of Liza and my grandmother loved her. She was her favourite singer so it was a nod to her.\n\n“We didn’t meet up to record the song but if the opportunity arises to perform it together then we will jump at it.”\n\nAlways being a group of outsiders for outsiders, doesn’t Gerard worry about how mainstream success might change them — and their fans?\n\nHe answers: “We’re very honest about who we are. On stage we’re something very extraordinary and offstage we’re very ordinary.\n\n“With this success, the worry is that kids are coming to see you just because you’re No1. But we stay true to who we are and so it’s never safe. We don’t attract the wrong people. It’s just that we’re all still outsiders just growing together.\n\n“It’s such an important record for all ages. Whether it’s a kid’s first life-changing record or just a record someone needs to have. It’s exciting and reminds you of something you don’t hear any more.”\n\nMy Chemical Romance cite many British groups as influences, in particular The Smiths, Oasis and Iron Maiden. But for The Black Parade, Gerard says there is one specific British album he compares this to.\n\nHe reveals: “Pink Floyd’s The Wall. People have suggested Queen — and we are massive fans. But the concept idea, everything about it, nods to The Wall.”\n\nThe Black Parade is set to be this year’s American Idiot by Green Day. And both albums were made by American producer Rob Cavallo.\n\n“We never held back and anything goes on this record and Rob Cavallo encouraged that,” says Gerard. “Rob was very vocal in wanting to work with us and we had a mutual respect for each other.\n\n“We are huge fans of American Idiot but also his other work, especially Jawbreaker and Fleetwood Mac.\n\n“He’s able to do any type of band and that’s what we liked about him. We have evolved and he can show our evolution on this record.”\n\nSpookily, while making an album about death, Gerard and drummer Bob Bryar were both injured while filming the video to their next single. Famous Last Words.\n\nGerard burnt his leg and tore ligaments in his ankle when guitarist Frank Iero jumped on his back. Bob got a staph infection that was so serious, he was hospitalised, pumped with antibiotics and told he had been just days away from death himself.\n\nGerard recalls: “We didn’t realise just how serious it was at first and Bob even tried to check out of hospital as he wanted to play the shows we were forced to cancel.\n\n“It was a scary moment as we were so engrossed in the notion of death that when Bob nearly died, it was like it was a dream, well, a nightmare. We’re all just happy he pulled through.”\n\nTalk to Frank.\n\nJoining The Black Parade\n\nAge: 33\n\nGender: Female\n\nPosts: 214\n\nOctober 20th, 2006 at 12:33pm\n\nmcr will be in NME mag on this monday i think so i will try n scan it in =]\n\nfabulous killjoy.\n\nModerator\n\nAge: 32\n\nGender: Female\n\nPosts: 46256\n\nOctober 20th, 2006 at 05:28pm\n\nMy Chem is going to be in the November issue of AP\n\nhttp://myspace-818.vo.llnwd.net/01313/81/87/1313737818_l.jpg\n\nCeiling Gerard\n\nAwake and Unafraid\n\nAge: 35\n\nGender: Female\n\nPosts: 14232\n\nOctober 20th, 2006 at 08:22pm\n\nBAHH Im sorry I didn't see this.\n\nMy Chemical Romance was in Entertainment Weekly.

There was an artical on MCR and The Black Parade.\n\nIt was rated a 5-Buy Now\n\nRead any interview with My Chemical Romance frontman Gerard Way, and he'll usually be going off on how rock bands should be larger than life, just like his favorite comic-book heros. Way's always been obsessed with making grand, sweeping, gestures (graphic-novel disc artwork, female impowering stage banter, choregraphy at \"punk\" shows; hell, his bands publishing company is called, Blow The Doors Off Jersey Shore Music), even in the days when his band were little more than friends with Thursday. This is why MCR are loved by lots of girls and reviled by scrawny young men in homemade Propagandhi tees.\n\nHeros in morder rock 2006 are hard to find. Thats why MCR looked backward for The Black Parade, embracing rock history and giving it fresh love bites on its flabby skin. The cavalcade of Parade floats salute album-oriented classic-rock (the bouncy, Cheap Trick-inspired \"Dead\" ) , jaunty mid-70s British glam, the poodle-metal of the mid-'80s and its common signifier, the power ballad (\"I Dont Love You\" ). Rock history referance points abound, from the opening salvo (\"The End\" ) comming off like the nephew of Pink Floyds \"In The Flesh?\" to the Foghat-live-at-Columbine boogie-rock of \"Teenagers.\"\n\nVocally, Way conjures his Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge persona, while trying on vocal chords belonging to everyone from Freddie Murcury to Jack White (\"House Of Wolves\" ). Whats really engaging is that The Black Parade is a concept album about death (phsyical, emotional, psychological; take your pick), yet even the most weepy sentiments are delivered with a swagger (\"Cancer\" or the Eastern European-flecked \"Mama\" ), a blistering guitar lead (Ray Toros the rocker, Frank Ieros the punker) or a joyful, bouncy candence (supplied my Mikey Way and Bob Bryar). One gets the feeling that My Chem are men out of time, given the ease they're rejuvenated these rock idoms. (Aparently, Gang Of Four, Radiohead, and Talk Talk never did rock the Jersey Shore much.)\n\nThe Black Parade is MCRs whole raison d'etre rolled up into one mega-decibel calling card, replete with heros, villians, terror, sadness, and the unblinking conviction to put it all out there for celebration and ridicule. As one Way-worshiped rock icon once posited 30-something years ago, \"Is this real life? Is this just fantasy?\" Here's to MCR making a career out of blurring that line.\n\noceanic 815.\n\nFull of Ephedrine\n\nAge: -\n\nGender: -\n\nPosts: 43317\n\nOctober 21st, 2006 at 01:48pm\n\nhead1stforhalos:\n\nI hope I put this in the right place...\n\nIn the November Issue of Blender magazine, they named 'The Black Parade' as the Album of the Year, with 4 1/2 stars. I don't have scans, though sorry. But here's the interview they did with Frank:\n\nWhere the magic happened:\n\n\"This big-ass haunted mansion in LA called the Paramour. It belonged to the guy who was in The Creature from the Black Lagoon. His wife died in a car accident on Mulholland Drive and was buried on the propety. But I was more afraid of the rabid racoon living in my wall.\"\n\nOn a scale of 1 to 10, The Black Parade's difficulty:\n\n\"A 45. We cut ourselves open, took out our insides and saw the demons came out.\"\n\nAlbum we unbashedly ripped off:\n\n\"There were three: 'The Wall' by Pink Floyd, Queen's 'A Night at the Opera' and 'Sgt.

We heard she bought our last record and was dancing around to 'Helana' in her apartment.
