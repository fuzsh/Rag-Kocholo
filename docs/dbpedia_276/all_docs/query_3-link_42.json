        "text": "One of the most magical things about opera is that it takes advantage of the broad spectrum of the human singing voice. From vocal range to timbre, weight, and more, there is a lot that makes each opera voice unique and powerful. In order to more easily match performers to roles, systems were created over time to categorize voice types. This made it easier for composers to create roles that would broadly correspond to larger voice types instead of to individual singers.\n\nThese categories have remained central to opera over the centuries since they were first adopted. Whether you’re a newbie or an experienced opera lover, anyone can benefit from a quick refresher of the different opera voice types. Here you’ll find opera voice definitions as well as some fun facts about opera voices.\n\nSoprano Mezzo-Soprano Contralto Countertenor Tenor Baritone Bass-Baritone Bass The Castrato FAQs\n\nSoprano\n\nWhat is a soprano: A soprano is the highest female singing voice. Sopranos typically play the lead female character in an opera and many of the most famous female arias are sung by sopranos. Within the larger category of soprano, there are a number of subdivisions that let composers specify the type of voice they want for a specific role. These include soubrette or light soprano, coloratura, lyric soprano, spinto soprano, and the full-scale dramatic soprano.\n\nFamous soprano roles: The Queen of the Night from Mozart’s The Magic Flute, Lucia from Donizetti’s Lucia di Lammermoor, and Violetta from Verdi’s La Traviata\n\nFamous soprano singers: Some of the most famous soprano opera singers are Maria Callas, Renée Fleming, and Natalie Dessay.\n\nExample: Perhaps the most famous soprano aria (or at least the one that best shows off the soprano voice) is The Queen of the Night’s Act II aria \"Der Hölle Rache\" from The Magic Flute. When most people think of soprano arias, this is probably what they think of—and for good reason. Another stunning example of soprano singing is this excerpt from Lucia di Lammermoor, starring Natalie Dessay singing about an imagined future that will never come to be.\n\nA Few Bonus Fun Facts and FAQs About Opera Voices\n\nHow do you train to become an opera singer?Training to become an opera singer is a long and challenging process—more so than many people realize. Opera singers typically start training very early in life. Over the years they learn everything from healthy singing techniques to endurance. (Operas can last as long as two to five or more hours, and making sure you can sing well for the entirety takes serious work.) They also will spend a lot of time learning different languages, since singers have to sing and sound fluent in an opera’s language even if they don’t actually speak it well.\n\nThe training process to become an opera singer is often very formalized. Individuals who are serious about pursuing the art form go from regular lessons to conservatories and eventually work their way up to fellowships designed to get them ready to perform on their own. These fellowships, like the Adler Fellowship at the San Francisco Opera, offer intensive individual coaching, professional seminars, opportunities to perform, and much more. Only after all these years of work and assorted programs is an opera singer ready to start their career in earnest.\n\nHow does a composer decide what voice type a character should have?It's a question of creativity—and each composer has to decide what voice type they feel best suits each of their characters. Take opera's favorite trickster, Figaro, for example. He's a character who has been interpreted and reinterpreted by numerous composers, including Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Gioachino Rossini, Giovanni Paisiello, Darius Milhaud, and John Corigliano. While Mozart cast the role as a bass or bass-baritone in his opera The Marriage of Figaro, Rossini styled the same character as a baritone for his The Barber of Seville.\n\nCan opera voices change?\n\nThis is a tricky topic that is fiercely debated within the opera community. While some people believe that opera singers can change their voices either due to physiological changes or to conscious training, others believe that voices are fixed. While it’s unrealistic that an opera singer will have a huge shift in their voice during their careers, smaller changes over time are certainly possible.\n\nAre stereotypes about opera voices true?\n\nThere are a lot of stereotypes about opera singers out there, many of which are outdated. One stereotype? That tenors are ALWAYS the male lead. While tenors certainly often play the male lead role (especially the romantic lead), there are many exceptions to this rule and baritones and basses also have opportunities to play many male lead roles.\n\nAnother common stereotype relates to mezzo-sopranos. People often think that mezzos can’t hit high notes. While their voices do usually sit lower than sopranos, they sing quite high on a regular basis and some mezzos even sing soprano roles on occasion.\n\nAre voice types always based on gender?\n\nWhile vocal categories traditionally fall along the male-female gender binary, that isn’t always the case in real life. With more trans and non-binary opera singers entering the scene, the gender-based distinctions around vocal categories are becoming less firm (and even less relevant). These changes and trends will be fascinating to watch in the coming years as we begin to see more opportunities for fluidity and variance within vocal types that align with our new understandings of gender beyond the binary.\n\nAppreciating All of Opera’s Voice Types\n\nWhile every operatic vocal type is beautiful, it’s when the voice types come together in an opera that you can really appreciate the unique flavor that each one brings to the table. The best way to experience that magic is by seeing it for yourself.\n\nIf you’re interested in learning more about the basics of opera, you can check out our other blogs covering A Brief History of Opera, 5 Things to Know About Opera, and much more.
