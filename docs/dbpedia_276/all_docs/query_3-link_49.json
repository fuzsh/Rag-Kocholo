        "text": "One of the most famous dogs in the history of animation is, without a doubt, the White Labrador Brian Griffin. Our hero of the day is one of the core characters of the popular animated TV series Family Guy, and he is voiced by Seth MacFarlane, one of the creators of the show. Brian was found by Peter Griffin, when he was just a stray in the streets, however, throughout the years he has become one of the pillars of the Griffin family. He is quite special as well, being able to talk, drive, walk on his hind legs, enjoy a fine drink once in a while, speak French and Tagalog, and even being a member of MENSA.\n\nBrian is quite a renaissance man (or, in this case, dog). He enjoys jazz, loves the opera, and has a great singing voice. He is a struggling writer attempting to publish his screenplays, novels, and essays. He was born in Texas to Biscuit and Coco, attended Brown University and was friends with Andy Warhol. However, even though Brian possesses many anthropomorphic traits, he is, in the end, a dog. His dog characteristics are shown in his hygiene habits, being that he bathes by licking himself with his tongue, sees in black and white, and even likes certain dog foods.\n\nHis canine traits aside, Brian is still one of the most sophisticated dogs in the world. His intelligence is unmatched, and his entrepreneurial skills are out of this world. Brian has invested in the stock market and even worked as a substitute teacher in a high school, amongst his other jobs, some of which include being a waiter, a film director, a screenwriter, and a musician. He is the much-needed voice of reason who often brings Peter and the rest of the family back to the ground when they get a bit crazy. He is a realist and a rationalist, criticizing religion more than a few times (even his Twitter handle is “d0gbackwards”).\n\nHis name is also a popular choice in the English-speaking world. However, Brian’s name is also the name of a legendary singer, songwriter, and visual artist, Brian Eno. An English musician is one of the most influential figures in modern music, having started his career in the ‘70s by forming a glam rock band, Roxy Music. His experimental ventures have shaped the landscape of music we know and love today, and his collaborations with David Bowie, Talking Heads, and most importantly their front man David Byrne, have produced some of the most interesting pieces of melodic creations in the world."
