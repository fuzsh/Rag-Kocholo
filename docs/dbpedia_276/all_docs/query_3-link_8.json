        "text": "Elton John\n\nElton John - Your Song (Top Of The Pops 1971)\n\nFor all of Sir Elton John's many talents, one area that he isn't always celebrated for is his unique vocal ability.\n\nElton John's husband and children: Inside their family life and incredible love story\n\nElton John's 20 greatest ever songs, ranked\n\nThroughout his career, Elton has always had an impressive range, from a soothing falsetto to a hard-rock roar.\n\nPaul McCartney\n\nSir Paul McCartney - My Valentine (Live Kisses) ~ 1080p HD\n\nOut of all the Beatles, Sir Paul's vocals was the most easy to listen to, and like Sir Elton is often overlooked when it came to pure ability.\n\nWatch the moment Paul McCartney sang ‘Yesterday’ so tenderly even hysterical Beatles fans fell silent\n\nPaul McCartney's 15 greatest songs ever, ranked\n\nIn fact, we'd argue Sir Paul's vocals have improved with age, especially when hearing his laid back tracks on albums such as Kisses on the Bottom. He can do both quiet and raucous with ease.\n\nRod Stewart\n\nRod Stewart - Forever Young (Official Video)\n\nSure, Sir Rod's voice might be a tad on the raspy side, but that's what makes it so special.\n\nWhen Queen, the Beatles and Rod Stewart sang spectacular version of 'All You Need Is Love'\n\nRod Stewart's 15 greatest songs ever, ranked\n\nRod has proved that he can perfectly take on everything from big band swing to '80s synthpop to disco to classic rock.\n\nAndy Williams\n\nAndy Williams - Can't Take My Eyes Off You (Singing, Live! Year 1967)\n\nWe reckon Andy is the cruelly ignored classic crooner when compared to his peers like Bing, Frank or Dean.\n\nAndy had such an easy voice to listen to, and it was so silky smooth that he could sing pretty much anything and make it sound amazing.\n\nTom Jones\n\nTom Jones - Delilah 1968 (1973) (HQ Audio)\n\nWelsh icon Sir Tom Jones has been entertaining audiences for six decades, and there's a reason for that.\n\nTom Jones reveals the time he unexpectedly found Michael Jackson at his house\n\nThe 14 greatest Tom Jones songs ever, ranked\n\nSir Tom has such a powerful voice, yet manages to control it too. He can go high or low, sing ballads or go for raucous anthems. He has the only voice in the world that wins free underwear every night.\n\nMichael Bublé\n\nMichael Bublé sings Cry Me a River - X-Factor Performance - HIGH QUALITY - AMAZING !\n\nFor an artist to score such huge success with a jazz-style vocal over the past 10 years, you need to be truly gifted, and that's what Michael Bublé certainly is.\n\nHe has a fantastic tone to his voice, and similar to Andy Williams before him, makes it incredibly easy and relaxing to listen to. He has one of those voices where you assume he's lip-syncing, but nope, he's just that good.\n\nArt Garfunkel\n\nSimon & Garfunkel - Bridge over Troubled Water (from The Concert in Central Park)\n\nPaul Simon may have written the majority of Simon & Garfunkel's songs, but he needed Art around the convey them with stunning emotion.\n\nArt's voice at his peak was mesmerising and still stops you in your tracks whenever you listen to him.\n\nStevie Wonder\n\nStevie Wonder - Living For The City (live 1974) HQ 0815007\n\nStevie Wonder has so many strings to bow, it's easy to forget that he's also gifted with an amazing singing voice, too!\n\nWhitney Houston and Stevie Wonder's duet of 'We Didn't Know' is mind-blowing\n\nStevie Wonder's 20 greatest ever songs, ranked\n\nHe always has such an incredible amount of emotion in his voice, but without straying too far off the song's melody or message.\n\nBing Crosby\n\nBing Crosby - White Christmas (1950).avi\n\nBing truly stood alone for decades when popular music transferred from the airwaves and sheet music into albums and singles.\n\nAnd there's a reason for that, Bing's voice was perfect for the early days of radio, and his low and easy-going voice was incredibly soothing. He made it look like singing that well was no effort whatsoever.\n\nElvis Presley\n\nElvis Presley Unchained Melody with never seen before intro and in the best quality ever!\n\nElvis Presley really did have it all. The looks, the charisma, the showmanship. But he backed it all up with an amazing voice.\n\nIs Elvis Presley alive? All the weirdest Elvis sightings and conspiracy theories\n\nElvis Presley's 15 greatest songs ever, ranked\n\nEven when it seemed he'd lost his way, his powerful voice still shone through. Just watch the performance above as proof.\n\nLuther Vandross\n\nLuther Vandross - Never Too Much (Video)\n\nLuther's voice has been called \"flawless\" and \"as smooth as silk\" in the past, and along with Barry White is best known for creating the mood of pure romance.\n\nFrom heartfelt ballads like 'Dance With My Father' to disco classics like 'Never Too Much', Luther's voice was always nothing short of stunning.\n\nMarvin Gaye\n\nThe late, great Marvin Gaye would have the amazing ability of singing gently yet with a huge amount of power.\n\nYou really believed whatever he was singing about, whether it was social injustices or just gettin' it on.\n\nAl Green\n\nAl Green - Let's Stay Together\n\nAl Green is a true soul legend, whose voice has worked wonders on seductive ballads like 'Let's Stay Together' to his more recent passionate gospel output.\n\nHe could even give country music a run for its money. The phrase 'they could sing the phonebook' was created for people like him.\n\nSam Cooke\n\nSam Cooke - A Change Is Gonna Come (Official Lyric Video)\n\nSam Cooke was known as the King of Soul for a reason: his distinctive and super smooth voice.\n\nBiographer Bruce Eder wrote that Cooke was \"the inventor of soul music\", and possessed \"an incredible natural singing voice and a smooth, effortless delivery that has never been surpassed\".\n\nOtis Redding\n\nOtis Redding - Mr. Pitiful (Live)\n\nSoul legend Otis Redding died at cruelly young age, but in his short time he set the world alight with his impressive vocal ability.\n\nHe was such a strong and powerful man, but he also made relaxing songs sound so effortless. Just listen to 'Sittin' on the Dock of the Bay' as a perfect example.\n\nFrank Sinatra\n\nFrank Sinatra - Fly Me To The Moon (Live At The Kiel Opera House, St. Louis, MO/1965)\n\nFrank was the crooner for decades. Whether it was belting out 'New York, New York' or drowning his sorrows at a bar, no-one else had a voice like him.\n\nHe also had a particular way of phrasing and emphasising words, giving his songs a far more personal feel than his contemporaries.\n\nNat King Cole\n\nNat King Cole - When I Fall In Love (Live in HD)\n\nIf we were to pick one of the iconic jazz crooners above any other, we'd go for Nat King Cole.\n\nYou don't get much smoother than him, and his records will be forever be timeless because of it. His voice still sounds rather magical, and it's impossible not to feel totally relaxed by it.\n\nMichael Jackson\n\nMichael Jackson - Human Nature (Live At Wembley July 16, 1988 (Stereo))\n\nMichael Jackson had impeccable pitch from a very young age, and that's what made his songs so iconic and timeless.\n\nMichael Jackson's mind-blowing last performance 48 hours before his death\n\nMichael Jackson's best albums ever, ranked in order of greatness\n\nConsidering he often had to perform spellbinding dance routines while still singing live, just goes to show what a one-off talent he truly was.\n\nGeorge Michael\n\nGeorge Michael At Palais Garnier, Paris '' A Different Corner '' Symphonica Dvd\n\nNot many people could come from the world of boybands and then totally take over the pop landscape with your voice.\n\nThe powerful moment George Michael first locked eyes with ‘future soulmate’ in audience\n\nGeorge Michael's 20 greatest songs ever, ranked\n\nGeorge Michael always sounded great with Wham!, but when he went solo, people suddenly stood up and noticed just how amazing his voice was. If anything, it got better with age.\n\nFreddie Mercury\n\nQueen - We Are the Champions (Live Aid, Wembley Stadium, 1985)\n\nThe greatest frontman of all time, also just so happened to possess the greatest male voice of all time.\n\nFreddie Mercury was able to perfectly tackle rock, pop, jazz, opera, soul, folk, you name it. Even when he was fading, he still managed to blow everyone away.\n\nDoes this video of Freddie Mercury singing opera prove the Queen frontman really could perform anything?\n\nQueen's 20 greatest songs ever, ranked\n\nQueen's Brian May once said that Freddie could hardly walk when they recorded 'The Show Must Go On' in 1990. \"I said, 'Fred, I don't know if this is going to be possible to sing'. And he went, 'I'll f***ing do it, darling', vodka down, and went in and killed it, completely lacerated that vocal.\""
