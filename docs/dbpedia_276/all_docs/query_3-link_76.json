        "text": "Crossover between the music and acting worlds isn’t that uncommon, dating all the way back to the golden age of Hollywood. In more recent years, several stars who rose to fame in music later found their way onto movie screens, and some continue to do both. Lady Gaga, of course, proved she has chops for both worlds when she starred in the fourth remake of “A Star Is Born” (2014) alongside Bradley Cooper in addition to contributing original songs for the film (and winning an Oscar in the process).\n\nOther powerful singers like Jennifer Hudson, Beyoncé, Taylor Swift and Rihanna have brought their iconic looks to films on the big screen. Queen Latifah, Awkwafina, Ice Cube, Will Smith and more began their celebrity careers in rap.\n\nHere’s a list of singers who became actors and actresses:\n\nLady Gaga\n\nThe Mother Monster can put on a performance both musically and cinematically. Launching her career in music with albums like “The Fame,” “Born This Way” and “Artpop,” the “Joanne” singer eventually branded her songwriting skills with her acting skills, starring alongside Bradley Cooper in “A Star Is Born” (2019). She won an Oscar for Best Original Song for “Shallow,” which she and Cooper duet in the film’s fourth remake. She went on to portray Patrizia Reggiani in Ridley Scott’s adaptation of Sara Gay Forden’s book “House of Gucci,” about the rise and fall of the fashion dynasty. She wrote “Hold My Hand” for “Top Gun: Maverick.” We will next see her in “Joker: Folie à Deux,” the musical sequel to the 2019 film, alongside Joaquin Phoenix.\n\nRihanna\n\nRihanna can do everything, from performing pregnant at the Super Bowl or Oscars to creating a successful makeup product line to writing songs. The “Umbrella” and “Disturbia” singer has appeared as Bubble in “Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets” (2017), Nine Ball in “Ocean’s Eight” (2019) and Kovi Novia in “Guava Island” alongside Donald Glover and Letitia Wright.
