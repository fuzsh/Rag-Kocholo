        "text": "It might be a little too soon to celebrate the end of winter, but we've seen a little sunshine this week, so it's definitely time to think about spring.\n\nAnd judging by the Radio 1 Playlist, it looks like the boys are going to soundtrack things as we head into a new season, with a number of rising male stars currently getting regular spins on air.\n\nHere are six names you need to be listening to as we wait patiently for a little bit of summer.\n\nIf you need someone to soundtrack an afternoon in the park now the weather's changed for the better, then Will Joseph Cook is your man.\n\nThis teenage star hails from Kent but his laidback guitar pop is drenched in Californian sunshine vibes, just don't call him a 'singer/songwriter'.\n\n\"I ****ing hate the term singer-songwriter. Honestly. It’s the bane of my existence,\" he told DIY Magazine in 2016.\n\n\"If you’re a pop artist you can do what you want.\"\n\nMix the vocal talents of George Ezra with the attitude of Jake Bugg and you might come somewhere close to Louis Berry.\n\nHis powerful, distinct vocals can stir the heart on tracks like Restless while new single She Wants Me is a powerful, rock and roll anthem set to echo across festival fields this summer.\n\nDespite his upbeat sounds, Louis says his struggles during his younger years inspire his music and lyrics.\n\n\"I grew up in a house where my father was a heroin addict and me Mam was unable to feed me and look after me and give me an upbringing,\" he told Skiddle magazine in 2016.\n\n\"I had no brothers and sisters so I felt alone, there was nothing, there was no way out.\"\n\nDanish producer Martin Jensen is chasing Calvin Harris and The Chainsmokers for his place at the top of the tree in the dance world.\n\nHe found online fame with tropical house remixes of viral videos before channelling his talents into proper pop, like current Top 10 single, Solo Dance.\n\nMartin teamed up with singer Lene Dissing after she submitted a video to him through Facebook when he was looking for a new video to remix.\n\n\"I just had this feeling that it had potential to be a hit,\" he told EDMJoy about their 2017 hit.\n\n\"I’m so happy for all the support people are giving it worldwide.\"\n\nGhetts is no newcomer to the grime scene and has been dropping mixtapes since 2005, but 2017 is the year the mainstream is taking note.\n\nHe has teamed up with fellow rising star Shakka on his new tune Know My Ting which is currently killing it on both 1Xtra and Radio 1.\n\nBut despite wider interest in his music, Ghetts is making sure his music stays authentic and true to his roots.\n\n\"I’ve made certain mistakes in my career that I shouldn’t have. I had to understand not every collab’ is worth doing, even if it’s worth a bit of change,\" he told Clash magazine.\n\n\"That commercial crowd switches so quickly, you know?\"\n\nJon Bellion has been making waves on the US music scene with his mixtapes since 2011 but he has embraced the UK's grime scene for his breakthrough tune, teaming up with Stormzy on his current track, All Time Low.\n\nHe has also made a career as a top pop songwriter, having previously written hits for Rihanna and Jason Derulo, but now he's bidding for solo success.\n\n\"I believed I could sit down at the table and say, 'I’ve written some pretty big records for other artists, my fan base is selling out tours, I have a clear vision for my album and I want to share that with you,'\" he told Variance magazine in 2016.\n\n\"So many times when you’re the new kid, you’re laughed out of the room and the labels treat you like a product instead of a creator.\""
