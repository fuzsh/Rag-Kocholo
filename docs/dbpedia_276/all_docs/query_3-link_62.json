        "text": "23 Actors Who Began Their Careers In Music\n\nWhen, in late September, the trailer for Paul Thomas Anderson’s Licorice Pizza dropped, viewers were thrilled—if somewhat surprised—to see Alana Haim front and center, leading the new film alongside Cooper Hoffman (son of the late Philip Seymour) and Bradley Cooper. Haim—who performs alongside her sisters, Este and Danielle, in the band Haim—may be making her acting debut, but the 29-year-old musician is already being campaigned for best actress this awards season.\n\nAs we wait with bated breath to see her in action (Licorice Pizza is out at the end of the month), we can’t help but think of some of the other performers who have made the leap from song to silver-screen. Need a refresher? Scroll on for a list of singers and rappers who also act.\n\nLady Gaga\n\nFor all the attention it brought her in 2018, A Star Is Born wasn’t Lady Gaga’s first time on screen. At 15, she appeared on a 2001 episode of The Sopranos as an (uncredited) classmate of A. J. Soprano’s. Years later, after achieving pop stardom, Gaga appeared in Sin City: A Dame to Kill For in 2014 as a waitress named Bertha and later turned up in two seasons of Ryan Murphy’s American Horror Story anthology series, winning a Golden Globe for her portrayal of the Countess in American Horror Story: Hotel. Next up for her? A turn as Patrizia Reggiani in Ridley Scott’s House of Gucci.\n\nHarry Styles\n\nOne Direction heartthrob Harry Styles made his big-screen debut in Christopher Nolan’s critically lauded (and Academy Award–winning World War II epic Dunkirk in 2017. Now, among his projects in the offing are My Policeman (with The Crown’s Emma Corrin) and Olivia Wilde’s Don’t Worry, Darling (with Florence Pugh).\n\nIdris Elba\n\nBefore he was a massively successful star of television and film, Idris Elba was “Big Driis,” a DJ playing London nightclubs. Yet even as his acting career took off, Elba kept one foot in the music world, releasing his first EP, High Class Problems Vol. 1, in 2010 (Luther would debut on the BBC just months later) and doing a two-hour set at Coachella 2019.\n\nWill Smith\n\nWill Smith launched a highly successful—and famously curse-free—rap career with Jeff Townes under the moniker DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince when Smith was still a teenager. In 1986, the pair’s first single, “Girls Ain’t Nothing But Trouble,” was a hit; their 1987 debut album, Rock the House, hit the Billboard Top 200. In 1991, NBC developed a sitcom around Smith, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, on which he starred for six seasons before breaking onto the Hollywood A-list with films like 1995’s Bad Boys, 1996’s Independence Day, and 1997’s Men in Black. He went on to earn Oscar nominations for 2001’s Ali and 2006’s The Pursuit of Happyness.\n\nAwkwafina\n\nBefore she lit up the screen in Ocean’s Eight (2018), Crazy Rich Asians (2018), and The Farewell (2019), Awkwafina (née Nora Lum) made her name as a rapper, going viral on YouTube with the song “My Vag” in 2012 and releasing her debut album, Yellow Ranger, in 2014.\n\nJennifer Hudson\n\nTwo years after she placed seventh on American Idol, Jennifer Hudson won an Oscar for her portrayal of Effie in 2006’s Dreamgirls. She was also handpicked by Aretha Franklin to lead the biopic Respect, released earlier this year.\n\nBeyoncé\n\nDestiny’s Child was already a big deal by the time Beyoncé starred in her first major motion picture (not counting MTV’s made-for-TV Carmen: A Hip Hopera), playing a parody of a blaxploitation character in 2002’s Austin Powers in Goldmember. She followed that with 2003’s The Fighting Temptations and The Pink Panther in 2006 before landing one of the starring roles in the Academy Award–winning Dreamgirls from that same year. She later starred in Cadillac Records (2008), Obsessed (2009), and lended her voice to Jon Favreau’s reboot of The Lion King in 2019.\n\nRihanna\n\nMandy Patinkin is slightly out of place on this list—a graduate of Juilliard, he has always been an actor who sings—but do the people who love him in The Princess Bride, Criminal Minds, Homeland, and The Good Fight know about his musical-theater credentials? On Broadway, Patinkin originated the roles of both Che in Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Evita and Georges Seurat in Stephen Sondheim’s Sunday in the Park with George. He’s also released several studio albums over the last 30 years, most recently Children and Art in 2019.\n\nLudacris\n\nLudacris spent the late ’90s and early 2000s becoming a hit on the music charts with songs like “Rollout,” “Stand Up,” “Act a Fool,” and Missy Elliott’s “One Minute Man,” but he also started acting under his given name, Chris Bridges, in the early 2000s for projects like Law & Order: Special Victims Unit (where he played a stepson of Ice-T’s character!, 2008’s RocknRolla, and the latter half of the Fast and the Furious series.\n\nLL Cool J\n\nAs a former member of the Los Angeles–based rap group N.W.A., Ice Cube is counted among the most influential figures in hip-hop history, but his first acting role—as Doughboy in John Singleton’s Boyz n the Hood—is nearly as influential. Ice Cube followed it up with roles in the Friday series (1995, 2000, 2002), the Barbershop series (2002, 2004, 2016), 21 Jump Street (2012), 22 Jump Street (2014), and The High Note (2020).\n\nSteve Van Zandt\n\nBelieve it or not, before he played Silvio Dante on The Sopranos, Steve Van Zandt had had no formal acting experience. A singer, songwriter, guitarist, and mandolin player, he was best known until 1999 as a member of Bruce Springsteen’s E Street Band, with which he’s performed on and off since 1975.\n\nMadonna\n\nIn 1985, less than a year after she released her culture-quaking record Like A Virgin, Madonna also delivered one of her most iconic film roles, starring in Susan Seidelman’s Desperately Seeking Susan alongside Rosanna Arquette. Critical accolades would come later; there were several more musical reinventions to be had before Madonna won the Golden Globe for best actress for Evita in 1997. She also memorably played Mae Mordabito in A League of Their Own (1992), co-starred with Rupert Everett and Benjamin Bratt in a 2000 dramedy called The Next Best Thing, and had a cameo in the 2002 James Bond film Die Another Day.\n\nCher\n\nA megastar since breaking onto the folk-rock scene as one-half of Sonny & Cher in the mid-1960s; Cher’s first acting role was that same decade (she played a model in the TV series The Man from U.N.C.L.E.). Not long after, she made her Broadway debut in Robert Altman’s Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean and reprised her role in the 1982 film version, for which she garnered a Golden Globe nomination. She next starred with Meryl Streep and Kurt Russell in the 1983 film Silkwood and won the Best Actress prize at the Cannes Film Festival two years later for her role in Peter Bogdanovich’s 1985 film Mask. She’d go on to star in features like The Witches of Eastwick, Moonstruck, Mermaids, and most recently, 2018’s Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again. In 1988, after she won her first Academy Award (for Moonstruck), The New York Times wrote that she “performs the function for women moviegoers that Jack Nicholson has always fulfilled for men. Free of the burden of ever having been America’s sweetheart, she is the one who represents us [women] in our revenge fantasies, telling all the fatheads . . . exactly where they can go. You need to be more than beautiful to get away with this. You need to have been Cher for 40 years.”\n\nBarbra Streisand\n\nFor Barbra Streisand, acting was always in the cards; it just so happened that a singing career came first. She was working the New York nightclub scene when the theatre director and playwright Arthur Laurents had her audition for I Can Get It for You Wholesale, the show in which she’d make her Broadway debut (and meet her first husband, Elliott Gould) in 1962. But she’d release three studio albums before becoming Fanny Brice in Funny Girl—and another seven before its film adaptation made her a movie star.\n\nKris Kristofferson\n\nA Rhodes Scholar in his youth, Kris Kristofferson was not only an accomplished athlete when he started making films in the 1970s (Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore with Ellen Burstyn and A Star Is Born with Barbra Streisand among them), but a Grammy- and Country Music Association Award-nominated singer/songwriter, too; penning hit songs for the likes of Janis Joplin, Gladys Knight & The Pips, and Johnny Cash.\n\nFrank Sinatra\n\nHe may be best remembered as a recording artist, but Frank Sinatra built up an impressive roster of film roles in the 1950s and 1960s, appearing both in musicals—Anchors Aweigh, On the Town, Guys and Dolls, Pal Joey—and dramas like From Here to Eternity (for which he won the 1954 Oscar for best supporting actor), The Man with the Golden Arm (for which he got a best-actor nod), and Some Came Running.\n\nVogue’s Favorites\n\nWhat Gigi Hadid’s Open Letter to the Paparazzi Means for Celebrity Children\n\nThe Best Romantic Comedies of All Time\n\nWhat I’ve Learned From Dating Every Sign of the Zodiac\n\nThese Are the Best Books to Read in 2021\n\nSign up for Vogue’s shopping newsletter The Get to receive the insider’s guide to what to shop and how to wear it"
