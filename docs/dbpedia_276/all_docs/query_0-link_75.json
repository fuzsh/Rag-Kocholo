        "text": "You can use the quick search box at the top of the page to search for books by titles, authors or ISBN.\n\nIf multiple words are entered, they are treated as a phrase. Entering more words will result in more exclusive results (ie: \"king\" will return matches for \"Alan King\", \"Stephen King\", \"The King and I\", etc. whereas \"stephen king\" will only return results where Stephen King is the author, or where the phrase \"stephen king\" appears in the title. Author searches will be matched as \"Firstname Lastname\". Partial word matches are not done, so \"king\" will not match \"kingfisher\".\n\nIf we detect that the search term is a number, we will assume its an ISBN and try to match on that.\n\nYou can use the \"*\" wildcard as many times as you like. \"*ing\" will match \"king\" ping, etc."
