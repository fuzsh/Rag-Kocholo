        "text": "1. Artist Case Study – My Chemical Romance Hayat Chehab\n\n2. History and Labels  My Chemical Romance is an American alternative rock band from New Jersey, formed in 2001. The band consists of lead vocalist Gerard Way, guitarists Ray Toro and Frank Iero and bassist Mikey Way. Shortly after forming, the band signed to Eyeball Records and released their debut album I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love in 2002.  They signed with Reprise Records the next year and released their major label debut Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge in 2004; the album was a commercial success, and was awarded platinum status a little over a year later. Matt was replaced by Bob Bryar to play drums.  The band eclipsed their previous success with their 2006 concept album, The Black Parade, which gained generally favourable reviews among music critics.  Their fourth studio album, Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys, was released on November 22, 2010, to positive reviews. Michael Pedicone replaced Bob as a touring drummer  The band's final release was a series of singles, released over the course of five months, collected on the compilation Conventional Weapons. The band announced its break-up on March 22, 2013, one month after the final release in the Conventional Weapons series. A \"Greatest Hits\" collection will be released in January 2014.\n\n3. Formation  The band was formed by front-man Gerard Way and drummer Matt Pelissier soon after the September 11 attacks. Witnessing the planes crash into the World Trade Center, influenced Gerard Way to start a band. He wrote the song \"Skylines and Turnstiles\" to express his feelings about September 11 and Ray Toro joined playing lead guitar, because at the time Gerard couldn’t sing and play the guitar at the same time.  The name of the band was suggested by bass guitarist Mikey Way, younger brother of Gerard, who was working in a Barnes & Noble when he was struck by the title of a book by Irvine Welsh named Ecstasy: Three Tales of Chemical Romance. He dropped out of college and decided to join the band.  While with Eyeball Records, the band met Frank Iero, the lead vocalist and guitarist for Pencey Prep. Following Pencey Prep's split in 2002, Iero became a member of My Chemical Romance, just days before recording of the band's debut album. They recorded their debut album, I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love, just three months after the formation of the band and released it in 2002 through Eyeball Records.\n\n4. Music Style and Influences    My Chemical Romance's general style has been categorized as alternative rock, posthardcore, punk rock, pop punk and, most controversially, emo. The band's official website describes their music as simply \"rock\". Gerard Way has publicly rejected the term \"emo\", describing the genre as \"fucking garbage\". However, Way has reportedly also described the band's style as \"What-else-ya-got-emo\". Gerard and Mikey have also said in an interview that they would more classify their music as alternative or rock 'n' roll. The band's sound usually have traits from punk rock, pop music and alternative rock. Their first album had a raw sound that had guitar riffs, very energetic vocals and even some screaming. It was considered an emo album with strong influences from punk rock, emo, hardcore punk and some influences from heavy metal. The second album Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge was one of the albums that brought the emo genre into the mainstream. The band's album, The Black Parade, lacked the post-hardcore elements featured off their first two albums and featured elements of pop music with emo and punk rock. Their fourth album Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys continued their sound with a lot of pop punk elements. Gerard Way said in a Rolling Stone interview, \"we love bands like Queen, where it's huge and majestic, but also bands like Black Flag and the Misfits, who would go absolutely crazy.\" Way has stated that the band is heavily influenced by Queen, Misfits, Black Flag, Iron Maiden, The Cure, Joy Division, Bauhaus, Siouxsie and the Banshees, and The Smiths/Morrissey. Way has also said that his band patterns their career after that of The Smashing Pumpkins, another band they admire.\n\n5.
