        "text": "1. VICENTE FERNANDEZ The King of Ranchera Music and without a doubt the greatest living Mexican singer. Seven Latin Grammys, one Grammy and over 50 million records sold, he has become a cultural icon in Latin America, the quintessential charro (cowboy)\n\n2. JUAN GABRIEL One could argue that it is THIS incredible singer-songwriter that current super star Marc Anthony has to thank for his stellar career. For it is this above song that made Marc Anthony an icon. With over 100 million records sold, Juan Gabriel, a camp and delicate performer, was the opposite to charro (rumour has it that macho mariachi authorities tried to ban him from wearing Mariachi suits). But the incredible singers passion, his charity work and his catchy style won over detractors and his popularity is huge all over Latin America.\n\n3. PEDRO INFANTE One of the great actors of the Golden era of Mexican Cinema, this guy could sing too. His sudden death in a plane crash at the peak of his popularity only helped inflate the myth. Some said he faked his death (a la Elvis) and lived in hiding for the rest of his life.\n\n4. ANTONIO AGUILAR El Racho de Mexico, Aguilar was, along with many other famous Mexican singers, also an international actor. He recorded over 150 albums and appeared in more than 100 films. He is the only Latin artist to sell out the Madison Square gardens six nights in a row.\n\n5. JORGE NEGRETE One of the “Three Mexican Rosters” along with Pedro infante and Javier Solis. His rendition of “Mexico Lindo y Querido” remains, 50 years after his death, one of the most popular songs in Mexico.\n\n6. JAVIER SOLÍS The most popular Mexican singer until his death in 1966 at 34. Hi lived a short but very prolific life as a singer and actor. He remains popular in South America.\n\n7. JOSE JOSE\n\nThe Prince of Song, Jose Jose’s life has been a long soup opera of tragedy and problems: alcoholism, health issues, bankruptcy...still alive but unable to sing, he is considered one of the most influential singers in Latin America.\n\n8. ARMANDO MANZANERO\n\nArmando Manzanero was one of Mexico’s greatest romantic composers, whose ballads were performed by the likes of Elvis Presley and Christina Aguilera and, most famously, provided the tunes for Luis Miguel's best selling albums (Romances and Romances 2). He is known more for his compositions than as a singer, but he wrote many of the great songs sung by the above singers. Without him, Luis Miguel (see below) would not be what he is.\n\n9. EL CHALINO SANCHEZ\n\nChalino is one of the first and most famous musicians to sing narcocorridos. He wrote stories that resonated with his own background and experiences in Sinaloa. While he rarely mentioned the drug trade directly in his music, listeners still knew the connection and the meaning of the music. Chalino told the stories of men who overcame impossible poverty to survive and develop power, as valientes, and about the reality of dying from the violence in a corrupt system. Chalino was killed in 1992, after being pulled over at a traffic circle by a group of armed men who flashed state police identification cards. Chalino was then blindfolded, tied up and shot in the head twice. No motive was established and no suspects were arrested, though there is little doubt the murder was fueled by the drug trade. Since his death, his fame and recordings have grown in popularity. Chalino still amasses millions of streams near 3 decades after his death, he is still very popular with young Hispanic listeners.\n\n10. José Alfredo Jiménez\n\nJosé Alfredo Jiménez, was the undisputed king of rancheras, the melodramatic and sentimental singing style that originated in the cities of Mexico during the 1950s and '60s. His songs are considered part of the Mexican musical heritage and comparable, for instance, to what Woody Guthrie meant to American folk music.\n\nAND THEN...\n\nLUIS MIGUEL Of the newbies, Luis Miguel stands above the rest of his generation. The ‘Sun’ of Mexico, is the ultimate heart throb who has sold over 100 million records to date and one of his tours holds the record as the highest grossing ever by a Latino artist. A formidable voice, he is considered one of the best Hispanic singers ever.\n\nALEJANDRO FERNANDEZ: Son of Vicente Fernandez, Alejandro inherited his father’s good looks, charm and some might say talent. First and foremost a Ranchera singer, he adven- tured into the pop world to great acclaim.\n\nMARCO ANTONIO SOLÍS Singer, musician and producer, Solis was the founding member and lead singer of legendary band “Los Bukis”. In 2011, Latin Billboard awarded him The Artists of the Decade award for his popularity and quality.\n\n....Jose Alfredo Jimenez, Cristian Castro, Pedro Fernandez, Rafael Basurto Lara, El Komander,"
