        "text": "Gerard Way is one of the most introspective comic creators I’ve had the chance to speak to in recent memory… And he’s had time to think: following the dissolution of My Chemical Romance this past spring, Way has become philosophical about what’s next, after being front-man for one of the biggest bands of the last decade. Part of what’s next? ‘The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys‘: a dystopian comic which is part sci-fi adventure story, part exploration of the burden of fame and expectations.\n\n‘Killjoys,’ whose first issue is out this week from Dark Horse Comics is Way’s attempt to bring together his music and his second gig as a comic writer, something he deliberately avoided with 2007’s ‘The Umbrella Academy’ in the hopes of letting readers see Gerard Way the comic writer… And not Gerard Way the rock star comic writer. I spoke with Way recently about ‘Killjoys’ (whose name serves as the subtitle to MCR’s 2010 album “Danger Days”) and bringing together the two parts of his art, along with being a new dad, getting darker in his storytelling, and “Scorsese violence” in his latest work.\n\nPlus, see an exclusive music video teaser for ‘The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys featuring My Chemical Romance music – and a six-page preview from the debut issue:\n\nWatch: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys Comic Teaser\n\nMTV Geek: In one of your recent interviews about “The Killjoys,” you talked about deliberately creating this barrier between your work on “Umbrella Academy” and My Chemical Romance. What allowed you to bring that barrier down for “The Fabulous Killjoys” and “Danger Days?”\n\nGerard Way: It happened very organically. It was something I was extremely conscious of, especially with Dark Horse on my side. The had done a really good job of giving the work that Gabriel [Bá] and I had done a really fair shot.\n\nWe did not exploit the band–I think the band name shows up literally on the cover of “Previews,” possibly, and maybe one other print ad. It’s all I agreed to and Dark Horse also agreed with me. Let’s just put this out there so retailers know, at least, and then let the book get discovered on its own merits.\n\nI said that–I always kind of separated them–and I started to work on the album that would become “Danger Days,” the second attempt at this album. And it was like, “This is all I want to be thinking about,” being in this world.\n\nSo I called my co-creator and co-writer and I pitched him the idea, and we both thought about it for like two or three weeks, and he was like, “Well let me think about it,” and I said “Yeah, I to think about it, too.” And then we had another conversation and he said, “No, I think you’re cool, I think it’ll be great, and I think we can make it work.” And so we did. [Laughs]\n\nWould I do it again? I don’t know. I just think that maybe there’s a better way for me to join the two type of things, and maybe it’s not such a big deal. I think just from now on, I’m going to make what I make–if it just happens to overlap, it just does–and I think I’ll just put less emphasis on what it’s doing and just do it.\n\nGeek: And with the “Killjoys,” it looks like you’re really exploring some themes–it feels a lot darker than even “The Umbrella Academy.” You touch on oppression and suppression of thought, and free speech–at least based on the Free Comic Book Day preview. What were you and Shaun thinking going into this and how was that set to overlap with “Danger Days?”\n\nWay: It’s kind of funny, because Shaun and I–I think we’d gotten to about issue two–I’m so glad Shaun had said this, because I was feeling the same way. He said, “God, this book isdark!” He said “I’m actually really excited to finish this so we can move on to something that’s a little lighter.” And I was like, “Yeah, I completely agree.”\n\nAnd it was one of those things where we’re enjoying it, truth be told, but it is very dark. I think my worldview and his worldview–I think I got him a little hipper to my worldview about my worldview with the record. I mean my worldview is pretty dark.\n\nYou know, “Danger Days” is a response to the success of “Black Parade.” And that’s just a really basic statement, but there’s so much more that goes with that, it’s not just the success of an album, it’s the chaos something like that can create in your life, and the relationships that are forged and destroyed, and the alienation and all of this stuff. And then, since “Black Parade” was successful, there’s peoples’ desire to just have that again. And not really fans–and I’m not just bagging on the record labels, it’s anybody that’s dependent on you making something happen again–it’s like pulling a rabbit out of a hat. It’s like, I did this automatically, I didn’t think about how big it was going to be.\n\nSo “Danger Days” was a reaction to that and a reaction to how the band saw the world, and the comic is a reaction as well, and how Shaun and I saw the world. But it is dark.\n\nAnd the violence is, it’s almost like “Scorsese violence.” When Scorsese shoots a violent scene, it’s very uncomfortable–it’s not like watching “Rambo.” It’s funny, because we’re dealing with laser guns, but it feels so much more violent and final when somebody gets shot in this book, instead of getting shot in a movie with a handgun or something.\n\nGeek: The FCBD issue felt pretty restrained in that regard, than the book you’re describing right now–anything bad kind of happened off-panel.\n\nWay: Free Comic Book Days and sneak previews are tricky because here’s what happens (and they’re positive): you’ve already written your story, and then a really cool editor will call you and give you this amazing opportunity and say “With this Free Comic Book Day thing, can you back up a little and maybe start the story two weeks before it starts?” And that’s usually the case and you’re like, “Oh, that’s weird.”\n\nAnd then they’re hard. I mean, “Umbrella Academy” was very difficult because I’d already written the comic and you don’t want to false advertise or misrepresent your book. So Shaun and I had this really great idea to just tell a pretty unrelated story that deals with relatively deals with the themes but doesn’t deal with any of the main characters. And it was restrained intentionally because there’s a scene in the first issue with the man and the woman that I feel like it’s pretty f*****d up and uncomfortable.\n\nEven if it’s not over-the-top violence, for me it’s about what’s under the surface of these violent acts that makes them more violent. Which is why I dig Scorsese films: it’s not just about someone getting shot, it’s what under it.\n\nGeek: Looking at some of those underlying ideas, I’ve read that part of your vision from the book came from an image of a young girl that Becky Cloonan drew a few years back. To what extent does being the father of a young child factor into making the protagonist a young girl kind of wandering through this harsh world?\n\nWay: It was a huge factor on three levels: the first level being advocated by lots of people–and I’m not one of those people–that’s like “Well, I don’t want to bring a kid into this world, blah blah blah.” And it’s like, whatever–the kid will figure it out, they’ll survive with the right guidance. The world won’t deceive them if you help them become strong enough.\n\nSo there’s that element, and there’s the element which is very closely related to Shaun and I in a weird way, which is that this is your child. Your child had no choice who their parents were. Other people have opinions about who the child’s parents were and then it becomes the burden of the child to deal with that. Especially if your parents happen to be artists or semi-relevant or semi-famous, whatever it happens to be. So there’s this weird thing that happens with the character of the girl in that she’s given this burden of responsibility for people she doesn’t even remember and also this secret mission that she doesn’t care about.\n\nAnd on a third level, it really reminded me–pick any 15-year-old girl out in that audience from the last ten years, the ones that are now 25: I felt that this character represented them as well. I felt these are the challenges a woman faces, be it becoming an artist, becoming a banker, or becoming anything, you know–what the world expects out of you as a woman.\n\nAnd I see a lot of that, being out on the road and having a large female fanbase. It’s about how they’re made to feel like they’re supposed to be skinny, how they’re made to feel what the acceptable level of “pretty” is. And I put a lot of that into the character and Shaun did too.\n\nGeek: So with the band finished, with “Killjoys” out of the way it sounds like you’re at a new phase in your life–you’re a new dad. What do you feel like your mission is right now?\n\nWay: That’s an awesome question. I feel like my mission is to be honest with myself. My mission is to share my truth–share, not give. I think that’s what an artist is supposed to do: I think they share. It’s not to say you’re greedy with it, but you can’t give it. The only thing you can give somebody is your take, your perspective. You’re really sharing your art. To be really giving and sharing your art means not thinking about what it’s going to be, not thinking about the money it’s going to make for somebody else–or yourself.\n\nMy mission is just to be really honest and make the best thing that I can, constantly.\n\nAnd be an amazing dad. That, actually, is my mission. The way to do that is by spending more time with her, but really even with the time that I’m spending with her, really being there with her in my head, being present. That makes the work better, that makes me wake up and makes it purer–that I’ve gotten something out of that day, that I’ve gotten to wake up, and I’m proud of being a dad. I think a lot of people go through their whole lives waiting for that validation. You don’t wait for that validation, you just do it.\n\nSo yeah, I think my mission is to be honest–for better or worse what comes out of that.\n\nGeek: Well, Gerard, I want to thank you for sharing your truth with us and I’m really looking forward to the book.\n\nWay: Thank you too. It’s been a long journey. I just saw the last covers last night and it’s weird. I was like, “Why am I so emotional looking at this?” And Shaun sent me this email and he listed 20 things and it was like that’s why you’re emotional.\n\n“The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys” #1 is available now from Dark Horse Comics. And “Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys” is out now from Reprise Records.\n\nWatch: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys Comic Teaser\n\nVia\n\nThe band’s former frontman, Gerard Way, and series star/creator Christian Jacobs talk to THR about collaborating on the upcoming episode in which the singer’s bass-player brother Mikey guest-stars.\n\nThe Aquabats! Super Show! gets some real-life rock infusion in its upcoming second season.\n\nHub Network’s live-action kids series — which centers on a crime-fighting rock band on a never-ending quest to right wrongs, destroy boredom and seek justice for all — will feature a forthcoming episode that was co-written and co-directed by former My Chemical Romance frontman Gerard Way.\n\nThe collaboration with Aquabats! creator/executive producer/star Christian Jacobs came about after MCR — which announced its split in March — appeared in another Jacobs-created series, Nickelodeon’s Yo Gabba Gabba, in December 2011. Way and Jacobs kept in touch and decided to partner up again for an episode of his newest show, which is based on the real-life rock band that Jacobs (aka “The M.C. Bat Commander”) co-founded in 1994 with fellow Aquabat Chad Larson (aka “Crash McLarson”). (Incidentally, the series just received a Daytime Emmy nomination for outstanding children’s series.)\n\nTheir episode — which is titled “Anti-bats!” and airs June 29 — finds two competing bands who are seeking revenge on The Aquabats! uniting with evil Silver Skull to become the Anti-bats! Way’s brother and former MCR bandmate, bass player Mikey Way, guest-stars as one of the Anti-bats!\n\nAhead of the show’s season two premiere, Way and Jacobs talked to The Hollywood Reporter about their upcoming episode, their working relationship and what’s next.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter: How did this collaboration come about?\n\nGerard Way: I had done an interview at San Diego Comic-Con — we were doing comics for the band — and they asked me what I wanted to do next. I had had Bandit, my daughter, and naturally I wanted to be on Yo Gabba Gabba, so I threw it out there. The universe works in awesome ways. Christian was on a flight with Frank [Iero, guitarist for My Chemical Romance]. … And then next thing I know, Christian and I are on the phone and collaborating on a musical segment. I realized how incredibly involved he is and how much he cared about every single segment. We hit it off and met on the set and stayed in touch, and he kindly offered me the opportunity to write for Aquabats!\n\nChristian Jacobs: I saw that interview with Gerard. I thought, “That guy likes my show? Oh my gosh. That guy’s really famous and talented.” It was cool he was into our show, and it made an impression on me. And then organically I met Frank on an airplane, and we exchanged information and eventually scheduled a segment for My Chemical Romance to be on Gabba. Gerard was really the creative mind behind it; he really had a vision for what he wanted to do, and it just seemed like we hit it off. We became friends because we had so many things in common, not just influences and references but the way we are about things we like and our likes and dislikes. So a few months later, I asked if Gerard would be interested in doing [Aquabats!]. We collaborated on a few different ideas, and one script rose to the top and got shot.\n\nTHR: It sounds like you have a pretty easy working relationship.\n\nWay: It was super easy, and when you find people who are inspiring, generally the smart thing to do is [continue working with them]. It’s hard work, but it’s supposed to be fun. It’s supposed to have the illusion of being easy, and it is, but it’s also long hours. Christian and I are the type of people who are very lucky to have people who want to support us and give us resources.\n\nTHR: Where did the inspiration for the episode come from?\n\nWay: It’s not a tribute per se, but there are things [from my childhood] like Mad Max orSuperman 2. It’s the stuff that wouldn’t be so obvious to people — like the guy with the beard in Superman 2.\n\nJacobs: And we have homages to that in this episode. We put a lot of what’s called meta humor in the stuff that we do, it’s kind of a phenomenon going on right now. People are using references to tell different stories, and I think it works seamlessly in the episode we did together. It’s fun to create stuff like that; it takes real effort, but it feels effortless, and the end result is also very smooth and effortless.\n\nTHR: Gerard, your brother Mikey also guest-stars in the episode. How did that happen?\n\nWay: It was super amazing and very organic. When we were trying to cast the episode, I knew that one of the most fun things, even though it would be challenging, would be to cast the Anti-bats! One of the things I’ve always loved is stunt casting. One of my favorite [Aquabats!] cameos is the Eagle Claw! spiritual mentor played in season one by Lou Diamond Phillips. And then Rip Taylor, that was a big one for me because I used to watch The Gong Show when I was a kid. So it was like, “Let’s get a musician to play this guy.” Christian thought of Mikey, and we thought it would be perfect. He said yeah right away. It’s cool because I know he always wanted to do something like that.\n\nTHR: Gerard, what’s your directing style like?\n\nWay: Because I’m so detail oriented, I’ve always collaborated [on videos he’s directed]. I get so hung up on detail and would stand there and do a shot like 10 times. Sometimes that’s a benefit and sometimes that’s a hindrance.\n\nTHR: Do you want to pursue directing more projects?\n\nWay: Any opportunity I get to do that and work with amazing people, I’ll take it. My music is — I don’t want to say my main focus, but it’s what comes most naturally to me. At this stage in my life, if somebody gave me $10 million to make an indie, and it’s just me, I don’t think I would do that. I like working in groups.\n\nJacobs: Take the money, I’ll help you.\n\nTHR: Gerard, are you working on new music now?\n\nWay: I am working on music. I don’t quite know how to describe it or what to call it or how to put a name on it, if it’s a band or solo thing. I’m not even dealing with that. Right now, I’m trying to figure out what I want to do and what the universe needs me to do. What I’m doing is super organic and completely pure, and I’m positive the longer I continue doing it, it will stay that way. It’s connected deeply to what I was before I started My Chemical Romance and had that adventure. It’s more connected to who I really am, because who I really was in My Chemical Romance, that changed and reverted back to — I don’t know, I turned back into a pumpkin.\n\nTHR: Do the two of you have any plans to collaborate again?\n\nJacobs: Absolutely. We plan to. Hopefully we’ll be lucky enough to do some more episodes [of Aquabats!]. But beyond that as well, I’d love to keep working together and get more things going.\n\nThe Aquabats!, from Awesome Forces Productions, returns with new episodes at 1 p.m. ET/10 a.m. PT on Saturday on Hub Network. (The season one two-disc DVD was released May 21.) The second-season premiere includes a special appearance from pro skateboarder Tony Hawk. Watch a clip, which is exclusive to THR, below.\n\nComing up, The Aquabats! are set to perform July 18 during Comic-Con at San Diego’s House of Blues.\n\nThe rock ‘n’ roll kiddie TV series “The Aquabats! Super Show!” is about to rock harder than ever. For the debut of the second season, executive producer Christian Jacobs (“Yo Gabba Gabba!”) hired My Chemical Romance vocalist Gerard Way to co-direct and help bring a new element to the music.\n\nThe episode, which airs June 1 at 1 p.m. ET, co-stars My Chemical Romance bassist (and Way’s brother) Mikey Way as the frontman for a death-metal band called Asthma. The group seeks revenge against the Aquabats after losing a battle of the bands because Aquabat Ricky Fitness (Richard Folomir) develops a crush on a contestant named Rachael Moonbug and unjustly awards her the $750 grand prize.\n\n“My wife wasn’t so stoked that we had a death metal band on a kids’ show,” said Jacobs, who also plays lead Aquabat M.C. Bat Commander. “I said, ‘Honey, kids need to learn about these things early.'”\n\n“The thing is,” added Gerard Way, “for anybody who’s bugged out by it, they have to realize that Asthma are the bad guys. So they should be a little scary.”\n\nScary, but funny. The death metal song was demoed by Way, but the directors chose to go with a version of a song by “Yo Gabba Gabba!” contributor Matt Gorney. And while the song rips like Behemoth, it’s not exactly typical death metal.\n\n“The lyrics are about the mailman,” Jacobs said. “You can’t tell what they’re saying, but it goes, ‘When I’m walking down the street, you can hear the sounds of my feet. The mailman brings me mail.’ It was a winner.”\n\nThe other main song in the episode is a Jewel-style acoustic number, for which Way contributed lyrics and Gorney wrote the music. “The lyrics originally went, ‘Everybody needs somebody touching someone somewhere,’ but we had to change that,” Way said. “I did it pretty naively and Christian was cool with it, but we brought it to the network and they said, ‘Yeah… Um, I don’t know about touching.’ So we changed it to ‘hugging.'”\n\nIn addition to directing and coming up with lyrics, Way helped concoct the bizarre plot. Originally, Asthma were turned into the Antibats by the evil “Silver Skull” and sent to seek revenge on the Aquabats. The rest of the episode was pretty much a slugfest between the two bands. But when a producer at The Hub pointed out that the characters seemed to lack motivation, Way added a new plot element, involving a donated brain that the government entrusts the Aquabats to deliver to a political leader called Governor Robot.\n\n“We realized, ‘yeah, these characters are basically just beating the crap out of each other the whole time,'” Way said. “So I came up with the character Governor Robot, and the brain came from the Aquabats needing something to bring to him at the end of the show.”\n\nThere’s also a touching — if you consider poking a slimy brain to be touching — scene between Ricky Fitness and Rachael Moonbug, in which the superheroes track down the singer at an amusement park where she’s performing.\n\nThe seeds for the Antibats were planted when Way hooked up with Jacobs a couple years ago while the former was working for “Yo Gabba Gabba!” The vocalist was talking in an interview about watching “Yo Gabba Gabba!” with his young daughter; and Jacobs, who is a big fan of My Chemical Romance and Way’s award-winning comic book series “The Umbrella Academy,” decided to contact the vocalist.\n\n“I thought, ‘We gotta work together! I love this dude!'” Jacobs enthused. But it didn’t happen right away.\n\n“A year later, I was flying back from New York and [guitarist] Frank [Iero] from My Chem was on the plane. I was like, ‘Oh man, that’s Frank, I gotta talk to him!” said Jacobs. “I was sweating and nervous. I don’t know how to approach people without being a cheeseball. But I met Frank. Then Gerard and I talked on the phone and we had My Chem on the show. That was awesome and one thing led to another.”\n\n“We hit it off right away,” said Way. “We started collaborating immediately without realizing we were doing it. He would have an idea that would give me an idea to draw something, and then I’d send him the drawing. We kept giving each other ideas, and as soon as we got on the set it was easy. Christian’s a great director and a great leader. Everybody really loved working with him on set and took his direction super-well because he communicated well.”\n\nWay worked with Jacobs on four treatments, but so far “The Antibats” is the only one in which Way was involved. Yet even off the set, Way’s working harder than ever.\n\n“I’m definitely not taking a break,” he explained. “I’m usually up until a minimum of 2 a.m. writing music and I’m up at about 7 a.m. with my daughter. So I’m sleeping four to five hours a night and I work from the minute I’m up after I drop her at school until I go to bed.”\n\nWhile Way revealed that he has been tinkering in his home studio with multiple styles of music and playing different arrangements with various instrumentation, he won’t specify whether the songs are rock, punk, pop or something altogether different. “I’m just trying to figure out exactly what I’m supposed to do,” he said. “I take a cue from the universe and I think about that pretty deeply and go with my gut 100 percent.”\n\nHe did, however, deny any interest in doing a solo record. “I’ve never seen myself as a solo guy. Some of my favorite artists, like Nick Cave and Tom Waits, are so far beyond me right now and I feel that if I was going to do something like what they do, I’d have to be a lot older and I’d need a lot more life experience. So I don’t feel like doing that. It just doesn’t feel right.”\n\nThat puts Way in an uncertain position that will probably be dictated by fate or the right meeting with the right group of people — though he said that right now he’s putting no effort into forming a new band.\n\n“I really haven’t been doing anything concrete except writing tons of stuff,” he said. “I’m just having experiences. I’m playing tons of instruments, constantly writing music, and I guess I’m putting myself out there and not pushing anything away. The only way I can describe it is I don’t know who I was before I started My Chem. I know that answers nothing, but that’s the point. I’m just exploring and seeing what happens.”\n\nVia\n\nThe bad news for music fans: The rock band My Chemical Romance split up in March. The good news for comic-book fans: Singer Gerard Way potentially has a lot more time to write titles like his award-winning Umbrella Academy.\n\nComics or records? It’s a question the New Jersey native thinks about every day.\n\n“I’m trying to figure out what the universe wants me to do right now,” Way says, “and then when I figure that out, I’m just going to do it as hard as I can.”\n\nHis current project actually crosses over into both mediums: The post-apocalyptic Dark Horse Comics series The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys, set in a future California town called Battery City, has its first preview in a special Dark Horse issue on Free Comic Book Day on Saturday.\n\nKilljoys No. 1 arrives in comic shops on June 12, but the actual story began with the 2010 MCR album Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys and music videos for the singles Na Na Na and Sing.\n\nPunk-rock freedom fighters and corporate villainy came alive via guitars and film, and he was already laying out the plans for a comic back then with Killjoys series artist Becky Cloonan, who designed the logo and cover for the Danger Days album.\n\n“The Killjoys is a weird case of the comic informing the music, which was the basis for the videos, which has gone back to fill in the gaps in the comic,” she says. “I definitely use the album and the videos as a style guide, but it’s such an expansive world that I never feel restricted.\n\nShe based the characters of the Girl, Korse and Dr. Death-Defying on the people who played them in the video — so Korse looks a lot like comics icon Grant Morrison. Yet, Cloonan adds, “it’s important to put my own twist on them, too. I mean, a bunch of years have passed so it makes sense to age them a few years.”\n\nFor the true origins of Killjoys, though, one has to go all the way back to New Jersey in the early 2000s, when Way, his brother Mikey and the rest of My Chemical Romance were in their early days and were just trying to find a practice space. They bought into a place shared with MCR guitarist Frank Iero’s first band, Pencey Prep, and Way befriended the group’s keyboard player Shaun Simon, who would later be Way’sKilljoys co-writer.\n\n“He and I connected in a very special and unique way,” says Way, 36, who convinced Simon to hop in the van on MCR’s first tour to sell merch, hang out and see the country. “We forged our views on what the world was, like the little details — the truck stops, the open desert, commentary on society. We really were deeply thinking about that stuff in the van together.\n\n“In a weird way, I feel like back then we were almost writing the book, whether we knew it or not.”\n\nMusic was actually his fallback plan — he went to the New York City School of Visual Arts to be a comic artist, and the late Carmine Infantino was Way’s portfolio instructor his senior year in 1999.\n\n“I remember him saying, ‘I want you guys to make sure you also have another skill for when you get out. I’m not saying you guys can’t make it — it’s going to be hard for a while.’ And he wasn’t wrong,” Way recalls.\n\n“That era of comics was after the ’90s boom, which completely disassociated modern normal non-nerd society from comics. Everybody felt burned because they all bought The Death of Superman and they thought they were going to be rich. Granted, people were getting into comics for the wrong reason, but people were feeding them bad stuff. There were a lot of publishers not really doing things at the time to keep the new readers around — they were just slapping a hologram on a cover or something.”\n\nWhen he graduated, there was zero work in the industry.\n\n“I started a rock band because that felt more secure, let’s put it that way,” says Way, who interned at Cartoon Network before he founded My Chemical Romance soon after the 9/11 attacks in Manhattan.\n\n“It did work out for me,” he adds with a laugh. “It was harder to break into comics than it was to become a singer in a rock band.”\n\nIn the 2000s, My Chemical Romance gradually grew to become one of the biggest bands in the punk and alt-rock scenes, but here and there Way found ways to scratch his comics itch.\n\nHe created artwork for the 2006 album/rock opera The Black Parade, but did double the work creating costumes, bumper stickers and other details for the Danger Days videos.\n\nWay brings that strong sense of visuals to his writing, too, according to Simon.\n\n“Gerard is a great artist but being a great artist doesn’t necessarily mean you’re great at making comics,” says the Killjoys co-writer. “He can visualize the layout of a page and just by changing a few angles or depth of panels make the whole page work that much better.”\n\nFor two Umbrella Academy miniseries with artist Gabriel Ba, Way wrote on the road, but when the band began touring for Danger Days, it felt very different, he says — as the group became bigger on a worldwide scale, more people wanted their attention and the press and activities were tremendous, so comics took a back seat.\n\n“There were a lot more distractions, but I felt like a lot of it came from the noise in my own head,” Way says. “Maybe that had a lot to do with the battle that Danger Days was to get the message across. It felt like something I was actively working on every day.”\n\nIn 2012 and early this year, My Chemical Romance released a series of songs under the Conventional Weapons banner that were written prior to Danger Days, but took its fan base by surprise when Way posted a 2,200-word essay on March 25 saying the band was no more.\n\n“My Chemical Romance is done. But it can never die,” he wrote. “It is alive in me, in the guys, and it is alive inside all of you.”\n\nWhen the announcement went out, Way felt a mix of emotion, sadness, anguish, pain and nostalgia, all at once.\n\n“I was very upset,” he explains. “I said to myself, ‘Yeah, you’re supposed to be upset because doing the right thing is really hard.’ Anything easy usually isn’t the right thing — like to not communicate, to allow the band to become less than vital, to dislike each other, to let all that stuff happen without it being in your control, and the band either breaks up in an argument or they just wear out their welcome or then they start phoning it in and then no one really cares anymore.\n\n“It was always really important to me that My Chemical Romance had a legacy,” the singer adds. “The message, while it’s still vital, is extremely important so to get that get tarnished or misinterpreted — even from within — and to see that in jeopardy made me know that this is the right time to do this.”\n\nWay’s glad he has a little more time on his hands. He says he wants to go to more conventions, especially those for games since he’s really into Dungeons & Dragons and other role-playing games.\n\n“That’s really what I connect with so I want to get out there more,” says Way, who has kicked around the idea of penning a fantasy series. “The only way a comic like that would be really awesome and amazing is if it was something that came out literally every month and forever, like Cerebus or something.”\n\nHe’s also catching up with comics reading — he’s currently fixated on the Fantagraphics series Prison Pit, and enjoying the works of Brian K. Vaughan, Matt Fraction and his pal Morrison.\n\n“He’s a constant source of inspiration in my life, even on a personal level,” Way says. “I never thought that this would happen with somebody who was a hero of my mind but we got to become really close friends. He and his wife and I are really important in each other’s lives.”\n\nWay also wants to reteam with Ba at some point to do a third Umbrella Academy, yet he still hasn’t lost his love for music either.\n\nThe universal question lives on. Comics or records?\n\nThere happens to be a third answer: being a father.\n\n“I literally wish that at times I could divide myself in half, and one guy could stay home and write comics and a dad and the other guy could go do music,” says Way, whose daughter Bandit — his first child with wife Lindsey, bass player for the band Mindless Self Indulgence — turns 4 on May 27.\n\nReconnecting with his little girl is a huge focus for him these days.\n\n“Not making up for lost time because you can never do that but you can make the time you have now good,” Way says. “It’s like a gift — I think I’m finally proud of the dad I am, and that’s a hard thing. I think some fathers go their whole lives and then eventually ask their child for confirmation.\n\n“That feels really great to wake up and know you’re a good dad.”\n\nVia: USATODAY.com\n\nIt’s finally time for the Killjoys to make some noise.\n\nAfter five years of planning, plotting and creating, former My Chemical Romance singer Gerard Way is releasing his futuristic Dark Horse Comics series The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys. It’s a tale of freedom-fighting punks and evil corporate empires that tied into his band’s last album and was partly inspired by the birth of his daughter.\n\n“It will give closure to a part of my life, and I’m sure it will do the same for Gerard, his former band and hopefully their fans,” says Shaun Simon, a co-writer on the series with Way.\n\nFans will get their first look at Killjoys with a Free Comic Book Day special issue available on Saturday at comic shops nationwide. The first issue of the six-part miniseries, featuring artist Becky Cloonan, debuts June 12.\n\nThe writer of two Umbrella Academy comic series, Way introduced the original Killjoys — with names like Party Poison, Jet Star, Fun Ghoul and Kobra Kid — in a pair of post-apocalyptic music videos for songs from the 2010 My Chemical Romance album Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys. He then used the mini films as storyboards to create the comic-book series.\n\nThe videos and comic show a range of influences from Mad Max, Repo Man and Buckaroo Banzai to Nintendo video-game ray guns and late-1970s sci-fi shows Battlestar Galactica and Jason of Star Command.\n\n“Somebody who was on set the first day had commented that it almost looked like a ‘punk-sploitation’ film. It felt like I was doing this newer thing,” says Way, whose band broke up in March.\n\nThe Killjoys comic picks up the plot from a scrapped Chemical video: Years after the heroes died trying to protect a youngster, the Girl, she’s grown into a teenager. But she still finds herself in Battery City caught between a new rebellion inspired by the Killjoys and Better Life Industries (BLI), a conglomerate that tries to keep the populace in check.\n\nThe antagonists from BLI include masked henchman Draculoids; Scarecrows who are akin to Interpol agents; and the Darth Vader-esque Korse (played by comics luminary Grant Morrison in the videos). They came from Way’s experience in a mainstream rock band — so much so that he felt the need to explain to his record label that BLI wasn’t actually them when pitching Danger Days as a concept album.\n\n“At one point in our life, we’re either a Killjoy or we’re BLI,” Way says. “The villains appear to be very obvious in the story, but I think you might be left wondering at the end, ‘Well, who really was the bad guys? Who’s doing the right thing?’\n\n“To me, BLI just represents more of a homogenization of life, society and music, and the Killjoys represent almost the extreme opposite of that, which is so filthy and so dirty that it’s hard to understand them,” he adds. “It’s almost like they’re too punk for their own good.”\n\nWay’s cast is varied, including a colorful group called the Ultra-V’s; the DJs Agent Cherry Cola and Dr. Death-Defying; and a pair of android prostitutes named Red and Blue. For her designs for these characters and the Killjoys landscape, Cloonan was inspired by the people and good times she experienced in the late-1990s New York City punk scene.\n\n“I ended up doing a lot of flyers, T-shirts and album art for bands I became friends with, eventually getting a mohawk and a few tattoos, which might have disappointed my family,” she says. “But I met a lot of truly amazing and talented people.”\n\nThe theme of Danger Days has found its way into the book, Way says: “If everybody expects you, wants you or is trying to get you to do one thing, and you don’t want to do it, how do you handle that?”\n\nThe main character of the Girl ties very much into that as a sort of chosen one who’s manipulated and is seen as an important figure by some and a complete waste by others.\n\nShe’s also a character who is, in a strange way, designed to be Way’s daughter Bandit, who turns 4 later this May.\n\nThe singer recalls getting emotional during the filming of the Na Na Na music video, which occurred soon after Bandit was born and featured a scene with the actress playing the Girl leaning out the window of a Trans Am and yelling with sheer excitement.\n\n“That was kind of heavy for me,” Way says. “Especially in the comic, I wanted the Girl to truly identify largely with the female fan base of the band. It felt like that character was Bandit or all of them at once.\n\n“That’s why it’s so much more important to do a third part that focused on the Girl because that was the message I wanted to convey: This is basically any young woman’s story.”\n\nVia: USATODAY.com\n\nWay before My Chemical Romance quietly adjourned in late March, guitarist Frank iero and keyboardist James Dewees were already concocting abrasive electronic music under the name Death Spells. Free from obligation, Iero now finds himself in the driver’s seat with equal parts excitement, confidence, and abject terror.\n\nLast spring, during demo sessions for what was intended to be the follow-up album to Danger Days:The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys, My Chemical Romance guitarist Frank Iero flew his family from New Jersey to Los Angeles to be with him. When his kids became restless with California, the doting dad acquiesced and let everyone go back to their Jersey homestead. Iero moved out of the living space and into auxiliary keyboardist James Dewees’ dodgy apartment in North Hollywood. The complex they were living in was a non-stop bacchanal of shawties-in-waiting hoping to get a chance to do some work twerking in some rapper’s video- and the music constantly blaring reflected that.\n\n“When the days in the studio were getting shorter, we started hanging out back at the apartment with all this weird dance music being played around us,” says Iero.”James and I would go for long walks and talk about what kind of music we’d like to make for fun, and it pretty much started from there.”\n\nSo Iero and Dewees filled up their new pad with plenty of synthesizers, hard drives, software, and effects borrowed from MCR’s studio and proceeded to create their take on electronic music- a dark, over-modulated, cathartic pulse with Iero out in front, shrieking his throat raw or intoning like the creepy villain from The Silence Of The Lambs. As Death Spells, the duo have created a different beast altogether, avoiding trendy dubstep wobbling, tired electronic-flecked metalcore and faux feel-good rave fodder for some seriously ugly and mechanized post-punk you could listen to while dancing, moshing, or vandalizing a police station. They liked the noises they were making, so Iero and Dewees signed on as an opening act for a week of shows supporting Mindless Self Indulgence in early April. But shortly before Death Spells’ live debut, My Chemical Romance announced they were going their separate ways, leaving behind a bunch of songs Iero describes as “almost another Conventional Weapons situation except there wasn’t anything finished, just things in demo form.” Coincidence?\n\nNot really. Iero is adamant the pursuit of Death Spells had nothing to do with MCR deciding to adjourn. He rolls his eyes at some of the most ridiculous rumors circulating about the band’s break, especially the one positing the members are regrouping under a different name to get off of Warner Bros. ( a fallacy popular with fans and self-aggrandizing British music-mag editors who don’t understand the term “first right of refusal”). Having just arrived back from a redeye flight from Los Angeles, Iero is jet-lagged but excited to talk about his future, reflect upon MCR’s legacy, and address all the uncertainty anyone would feel when hitting the reset button on his or her career. “Be it immaturity, throwing caution to the wind or just being punk rock, we didn’t give a fuck about what anyone else thought”, he says about his former band’s decision to retire. “Unless we were happy with it, we weren’t going to do what we didn’t want to do. We played it by our own rules, for better or for worse. That’s how we started it, that’s how we ran it and that’s how we ended it.”\n\nBeing responsible for some of the more unlikely aspects of certain My Chemical romance songs , the fractured hardcore of Leathermouth and now Death Spells’ raw-nerve scree, do you think fans and critics expect a certain thing from you?\n\nFRANK IERO: I feel comfortable in awkwardness. [Laughs.] I think for some reason, people need to define, expect and pigeonhole things. This past week, I was talking to a few people about doing things for different outlets like movies and TV. A lot of them were like, “So you do this kind of thing? “ And I said, “Well, let me play you some stuff. “ And then the response was like, “Wow, Really? You do this, too?” I like catching people off-guard. I think people expect a certain thing from me and it’s not necessarily what I’m like at all. But I like that, as well; I like that people expect a certain thing from me, but very rarely get it. [Laughs.]\n\nCurrently, there are a ton of subgenres in electronic music. What was the overarching concept with Death Spells that you agreed upon?\n\nI think [James and I] were rebelling against what we were creating in the studio- the day job- and the night shift were these two dudes who still wanted to be making music 24/7. What came out was the seediness of the area we were living in, the ability to get really loud and dirty but not get kicked out of the apartment and to get as grimy as humanly possible. There was no expectation as to what it was going to turn into. James would ask, “Hey, this is pretty grimy. Does this move you?” And I’d listen to it and go, “Yeah, I can totally curse over this for three minutes.” [Laughs.]\n\nI’d assume the music sounds the way it does because you’re in a crap neighborhood, there’s all this bad music and annoying people at top volume in the building and you miss your family. But knowing Dewees, he’s like the post-emo Tony Robbins, where, “Dude! Everything is good!”\n\nAbsolutely. He is the silver lining embodied. He’d be baking stuff-cakes, soft pretzels-and bring it to the studio and make everybody happy. His demeanor is always jovial, but it’s in his musical sensibilities where he gets dark. I’m kind of the yin to his yang: He wanted Death Spells not to be his usual project. He was making music that was speaking to my dark side, and it started to work in a way we hadn’t expected to. With Reggie and the Full Effect, he wrote those parts and I just played guitar. When he was playing in Leathermouth, that stuff was written and recorded before he came in. When it came to My Chem, it was different. So Death Spells is the first time we gave birth to something.\n\nWhat are plans for Spell-binding recordings? Because your name is obviously on MCR’s Warner Bros. contract, I’d assume the label gets first dibs on Death Spells material.\n\nYeah. I’m in legal limbo with a couple of things, right now. I’m curious to see what’s going to happen. We had plans on releasing some things, but I was told that is not the best idea right now. A few months ago, I put up [online] that Christmas song and that Ronettes cover (“Be My Baby” ), just to put them up and see what happens. And then I got the phone call. [Laughs.] We’ll see what happens after this article comes out and whether or not Death Spells have a home or are free agents. But I’m ready to get more stuff out there, more than just one muddled-and-muted- song on SoundCloud.\n\nCorrect me if I’m wrong, but I always saw you as the biggest cheerleader in My Chem. You’re kind of like a shark: Sharks don’t sleep; they have to keep moving. It seems like you’re always doing something musical or working on other unnamed projects.\n\nYou’re right. I’m a huge fan of music in general. I buy new music constantly; I seek out and listen to new music; I create it- whether it’s good or not- and need for it to be out there. I like to have things that I make not just heard by myself, whether I’m 100- percent proud of it or not. I need it to live and breathe out there. And sometimes it’s my own downfall. I was very much a proponent of keeping things going [in MCR]. Sometimes you bend over until your back breaks to keep things moving because you believe in it so much. In order for me to survive, I need to live outside the My Chem walls for a little while. I think that goes for everybody in the band: You reach a point in your life when you realize, “Shit, we’re not getting younger, even if we don’t act that way.” And there are things on the bucket list you don’t want to forget about. We’re all living our lives right now. Just going off and crossing off your list is healthy for everybody.\n\nWas it a situation of ‘Kill the band,save the friendships?\n\nYeah. Listen, those guys will always have a piece of my heart.I love those guys to death.I grew up with them at my side. They are all my big brothers,and sometimes-to a fault-I will go out of my way to try to impress them or go out of my way to seek their approval on things. I have such a love for them. Second to my children,the band is the thing I am most proud of in my life. It will always hold a dear place in my heart. But I see where things needed to end in order for us to be the people we needed to be. A this point in our lives, it wasn’t in the cards. It’s hard to let go,but I know we ended it for the right reasons. Not only am I excited for my future, I can’t wait to see what those guys are going to do next.\n\nBeing a psychic cheerleader can be exhausting.\n\nYou give everything because you think it’s the right thing to do, and sometimes you’re forcing it for yourself. But I’ve always been a big proponent of “If you love doing it, well then fucking do it.” So that’s what I do. I love [playing and making music], so I’m going to do it.\n\nWhat’s interesting to me is that you’re a full-on doting father and loving husband, but then you have the capability to make some crazy antisocial music. And since you’re kind of hitting reset on your career, how do you make this kind of decidedly non- commercial music and still provide for your family? How do you reconcile that?\n\nI am a totally miserable fuck when I am not creating. I know deep down that in order for me to be the best father I want to be- the dude that my kids want to be around- I need to be creating. I can’t help it. If I’m not creatively fulfilled, I just crumble as a person. My wife understands that- she knew that from the beginning. But there are so many things that are new to me that I want to try. Things that make me think, “ I’d like to try my hand at that,” or “Man, I could totally fuck that shit up!”. Right now, I have nothing but dreams to fulfill- and that’s a scary and exciting and confusing and amazing time right now.\n\nSo then, Pencey Prep reunion this fall?\n\nHa![Laughs.] Move forward, man!\n\nAP Magazine\n\nBASS EXPO 2013: My Chemical Romance are a band that have polarised opinions, angered newspapers, formed an army of extremely loyal fans the world over and managed to keep their heads in the process. But despite their formidable live reputation, their musicianship is often overlooked in favour of whatever controversy the press has decided to attribute to the band that month.\n\nIn attempt to rectify this, we spoke to bassist Mikey Way and picked his brains about his early influences, his gear preferences and the development of his signature Squier Mustang bass.\n\nEnter our competition to win a Mikey Way Mustang Bass\n\nWhat’s your very first memory of the bass guitar?\n\n“My very first memory of the bass guitar – I was about three years old and heard Another One Bites The Dust by Queen on the radio. It was burned into my skull from that moment on, and became a benchmark for bass lines in my mind.”\n\nDo you remember the first time you made a breakthrough with your bass playing – the first time you thought ‘This is for me’?\n\n“My first breakthrough with bass playing was during one of the first MCR practices in December of 2001. Gerard [Way, frontman] and Ray Toro [lead guitar] both coached me, as I hadn’t had a great deal of bass experience up to that point. When I got the picking pattern/timing for [early MCR track] Our Lady of Sorrows down, I had a total ‘wow’ moment and knew not only did I love it, but I would play the bass forever.”\n\nWhat, for you, is the key to be being a good bass player?\n\n“In my opinion, the key to being a good bass player is rhythm and timing. Bass is what the drummer plays from mostly and everybody goes off the drummers beat.”\n\nMy Chemical Romance – Planetary (Go!), the song that Mikey says he finds the most challenging\n\nWhat MCR song has presented the biggest challenge for you as a bass player and why?\n\n“I would say the song that presented the biggest challenge for me was Planetary (Go!) [from MCR’s fourth album Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys]. That song takes a great deal of dexterity to play live, and in turn has made me a better player.”\n\nMCR has, for better or worse, had a variety of drummers in its 10 year + history. What impact has that had on your role in the band’s rhythm section?\n\n“I can honestly say it benefited me greatly. I’ve played with five drummers in MCR, either onstage or in the studio and jammed with countless others. They each had different styles and nuances, so I was able to learn a lot from each of them.”\n\nGerard has spoken before about ‘Bowie moments’ – the ‘pinch yourself’ experiences the band occasionally gets to enjoy. What have been your favourite Bowie moments with MCR?\n\n“I have been very fortunate to have had many of those moments in our career thus far. Some highlight ‘Bowie/pinch me moments’ being -the reveal of The Black Parade in London back in ’06, headlining Reading and Leeds in 2012, being the first American band in 30 something years to play Vietnam, and being the last band to play in Time Square before the ball dropped.”\n\nHave you ever met any of your bass playing heroes? Who’s inspiring you currently?\n\n“I’ve been able to meet many of my bass heroes through the years luckily! Matt Sharp’s bass playing on the first two Weezer albums never fails to inspire me.”\n\nDo you have a favourite bass line of all time? What is it and why?\n\n“Oh wow, this is a toughie! It’s so hard to pick just one, but any of Louis Johnson’s bass lines on Michael Jackson’s Thriller album take the cake. They are still stuck in my head to this day, after hearing them almost 30 years ago. They are powerful and infectious.”\n\nWhat do you look for when you’re buying a bass?\n\n“When I’m buying a bass I look for equal parts sound, playability and vibe. Not only do I want it to sound and play amazing, but its an added bonus when it has interesting “battle damage” or an interesting color pattern that I’ve never seen before.”\n\nYou recently released a signature Squier Mustang bass. How did that come about? How does it feel to have your name on a guitar?\n\n“Before, we were discussing ‘pinch yourself’ moments, and getting my own signature Squier Mustang bass is on that list. I had been sponsored by Fender through most of my time in MCR. I had contacted them about making a custom bass and they hit me back saying they wanted to give me a signature model! To me, this is one of my greatest accomplishments.\n\n“I started playing electric guitar at 14/15, and it was a Fender Stratocaster. My first bass was a Squier P Bass and I haven’t used anything but Fender onstage ever since. To say its a tremendous honour and privilege would be an understatement. At least once a day I think about it, and it makes me smile ear to ear.”\n\nWhat is it about the Mustang bass that draws you to that model? What features were you keen to incorporate?\n\nI was drawn to the Mustang because, simply put, they are a hell of a lot of fun to play – especially in a live setting [and] I’ve always really wanted a Mustang, with a humbucker, and a competition stripe (it’s classic and classy!). I’ve always been in love with flake/sparkle finishes as well; so if you stir all of that up in one – you have my signature model.”\n\nWhat other bass gear do you use? (Amps, pedals etc.) And why?\n\n“As far as other bass equipment – I use the Fender Super Bass Man. From the minute I took it out of the box I was in love, and won’t use anything else. Not only does it sound HUGE, but the range of sounds and tones you can get is uncanny. Highly recommended.\n\n“As far as pedals go, I always love the Memory Man and Bass Big Muff/regular Big Muff from Electro-Harmonix. I’ve been using a Big Muff for distortion since I started playing the electric guitar and swear by it.”\n\nDo you use your signature bass on stage?\n\n“Yes, I absolutely do. It’s my weapon of choice, badge of honor, and good luck charm all rolled into one.”\n\nEnter our competition to win a Mikey Way Mustang Bass\n\nVia: Music Radar"
