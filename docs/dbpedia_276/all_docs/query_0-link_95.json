        "text": "Hi Everyone! Welcome back to another blog. Guess what this one is about! If you guessed music, then you're right! This week I will talking about a pretty rad band. You might have heard of it, it’s called Panic! At The Disco.\n\nPanic! At the disco first started out as a punk/emo band. They started out in the early to mid years of the early 2000's. Led by frontman Brendon Urie,the band offered an almost theatrical and rustic presentation.\n\nFrom a prologue in the first album featuring synthesizers, and old-timey style to the second studio album relying heavily on violins, violas, ukuleles, and pianos. These two albums of course were titled A Fever You Can't Sweat Out and the appropriately titled Pretty. Odd. The band also has two other albums out tittled: Vices and Virtues and Too Wierd to Live, Too Rare to Die.\n\nSince then, the band has slowed down quite a bit. Though they have slowed, they have also gain a bit more popularity in the media. Whether it be the lasting memories of A Fever You Can't Sweat out, the newer sounds of songs like Miss Jackson or This Is Gospel, or even the over the top and hilarious Vine videos by Brendan. They are a band who have made an impression on lots of peoples' memories, old fan or new.\n\nThe band's roster has changed numerous times from at least 4 members, to 2 members being in the group. But, realize that they don't just do good at music. They do good in the realm of film with numerous otherwise cryptic music videos. Using symbolism to bring a higher meaning to things such as mimes, fishtanks, or even just… Weddings. All blend perfectly with the mixture of classical, techno, and hard rock elements of the music it accompanies.\n\nI’ve been listening to PATD since I was little, they are a great band and just like everyone else I write about, I recommend you take a listen.\n\nHey, welcome back. In the previous blog I said something about a band called \"All Time Low,\" I said that you'd read more about them in this blog. Well here it is.\n\nAll time low is an American Pop Punk band from Maryland. It Consists of four members; Jack, Alex, Rian, and Zack. They formed while the boys were still in high school in 2003. At first the band started out doing covers of bands, such as Blink-182. In 2004 they were signed to Emerald Moon Records. They released their first EP. In 2006 they were signed with Hopeless Records, who they are still with today.\n\nIn 2005 they released their first album, \"The Party Scene.\" They began to tour shortly after.\n\nIn 2007 they released another album called \" Its So Wrong, It's Right.\" Following this album, All Time Low became pretty popular.\n\nIn 2008 the band completed their own headlining tour. They went on several other tours between 2008 and 2009. In 2008, the band was being listened to more often and that caused them to be named band of the year.\n\nIn 2009, the album \"Nothing Personal\" was released. Also in 2009, All Time Low went on tour with Fall Out Boy. The also headlined Warped Tour in 2009.\n\nIn 2011, They released \"Dirty Work.\" They produced the song \"Painting Flowers\" for the movie \"Alice In Wonderland.\"\n\nIn 2013, They produced \"Don't Panic.\" They again played at Warped Tour in 2012. Also in 2013, All Time Low toured with A Day To Remember and Pierce The Veil.\n\nJust recently the released a new album called \"Future Hearts.\"\n\nSome of my favorite songs include; \"Therapy,\" \"The Irony Of Choking on A Lifesaver,\" \"Somewhere In Neverland,\" and \"Backseat Serenade.\" Some of the songs are very compassionate.\n\nHi Everyone! Welcome back. On this weeks blog, I will be talking about one of my favorite bands, Blink-182. Blink-182 is an American rock band from California.\n\nBlink-182, formerly called Blink had to change their band name due to copyright claims from another band called Blink. They then changed it to Blink-182\n\nThe band's first album Chesire Cat was heavily based upon the modern day Punk style of the time. This album came out in 1994. As time progressed, they converged into a more mature and serious band.\n\nAcclaimed by many, Adam's Song off of the Enema of State album was considered the first serious, suicide oriented, and controversial song of their overall career. But, with that came many hits such as All The Small Things and Dammit featured in many TV shows and Movies of the decades.\n\nMany of their songs are about being depressed, or ending your own life. They also write about getting dumped, or being in a relationship. They are very impassioned band, they don't just sing to sing. They sing their feelings and are honest. They aren't afraid to show the world and their fans how the feel.\n\nSome of my favorite songs by Blink-182 are named; Always, All The Small Things, Adams Song, I Miss You, and What's My Age Again? I enjoy the deep meaning of the songs, and the songs mean a lot to me and they describe my feelings pretty well.\n\nThere are 4 members in this band. Travis Barker, on drums; Mark Hoppus, on bass guitar; Although vocalist Tom DeLonge's position is disputed as of 2015.\n\nThe band came out with an album in 2013, called Icon. It was an album of their greatest hits. All The Small Things, Josie, Feeling This, Adam's Song, Dammit, What's My Age Again, The Rock Show, Down, First Date, Stay Together For The Kids, and I Miss You; are all the songs featured on this greatest hits album.\n\nHello everyone! Welcome back to another blog. This week I'm going to band talking about another band. This week I'm going to be talking about My Chemical Romance.\n\nMy Chemical Romance was an American rock band from New Jersey. My Chemical Romance was formed in 2001. The band broke up in 2012. All the internet knows is that Bob Bryar left the band. We have no idea why, we just know he did. Before the band broke up the had 4 studio albums.\n\n-I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love\n\n-Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\n\n-The Black Parade\n\n-Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys\n\nThe band had 5 main members. Some left but the final members were as follows:\n\nGerard Way\n\nMikey Way\n\nRay Toro\n\nFrank Iero\n\nJames Dewees\n\nThey had labels with Reprise, Warner Bros, and Eyeball.\n\nA list of my favorite songs by MCR are the following: \"Cancer,\" \"Welcome To The Black Parade,\" \"Teenagers,\" \"Sleep,\" “ Helena,” and \"Sing\". These are my favorite songs because they are some of the first songs I heard.\n\nMy Chemical Romance is one of my favorite bands because they sing a lot of inspirational music. Their songs have a lot of meaning; they have saved people lives and they make people feel better.\n\nMy Chemical Romance is also called My Chem or MCR. Fans of the band are called the MCRmy. Even though the band has broken up, we are still loyal fans and we still love the band members and the music just the same.\n\nHey there I see you came back. Well I usually talk about bands but this week I’m gonna talk about country music. I haven’t really talked about country music which is weird because I spend a lot of time listening to it.\n\nI grew up on country music; when I was little it was all my mother played. Blake Shelton, Rodney Atkins, Carrie Underwood, Luke Bryan, and Gretchen Wilson were some of the main artists I listened to when I was younger. I actually got pretty sick of it. So as I got older I stopped listening to it, but in the last 3 years or so I listen to it more and more.\n\nToday I listen to a lot of country. Some of my favorite artists are as follows: Luke Bryan, Brantley Gilbert, Florida Georgia Line, Jason Aldean, Hunter Hayes, and Scotty McCreery.\n\nSome of my favorite songs are listed: \"My Kinda Crazy\", by Brantley Gilbert \"Redneck Crazy\", by Tyler Farr \"Mine Would Be You\", by Blank Shelton \"Haunted\", by Taylor Swift \"Bottoms Up\", by Brantley Gilbert \"Burnin It Down\", by Jason Aldean \"Dirt Road Diary\", by Luke Bryan \"Bartender\", \"The Trouble With Girls\", by Scotty McCreery and \"This Is How We Roll\".\n\nI basically like all country music because most of it was my childhood. Country gives me a little piece of my childhood. The songs have meaning to me. I don't listen to old country music much. I listen to mostly the newer stuff.\n\n\"Bartender\" by Lady Antabellum \"Haunted,\" by Taylor Swift and \"This Is How Well Roll\" by Florida Georgia Line make me happy because the kinda make me wanna get up and dance. It empowers me and makes me feel better.\n\nSome country music makes me sad because it brings back a lot of memories. Like the song \"What Hurts The Most\" by Rascal Flatts and \"If Heaven Wasn't So Far Away\" by Justin Moore these songs remind me of my grandfather.\n\nCountry music has been there for me since I was little and is a big part of my life today.\n\nHi! Welcome back! So I usually write about different bands. This week I'm doing something difference. Instead of talking about bands I'm going to be talking about some songs that cheer me up or mean a lot to me. It may get personal just be warned. Lets go.\n\nWe'll start off with songs that change my mood. The first song is called \"Angel With A Shotgun\" by Nightcore. This songs cheers me up because it makes me feel empowered. The song lyrics are meaningful and there is a great beat. Another song is \"Game Over\" by Falling In Reverse. This song is amazing because every time it comes on I instantly start singing and dancing, It is a super catchy and happy song. It's upbeat and fun to listen too. Another song that makes me feel better is the song \"Tentacles\" by Ghost Town. This song makes me wanna yell out the lyrics at the top of my lungs, so I sing them loudly. This songs makes me wanna dance.\n\nSongs that help me through life, that have powerful lyrics. One song is \" I Will Not Bow\" by Breaking Benjamin. This song has suck powerful lyrics. It talks about how you need to not let the world break you. You have to survive through the pain. Another song is also by Breaking Benjamin, it's called \"Dear Agony.\" This song means so much because it takes about how they can feel the suffering crawl beneath their skin. They just want agony to let them go, and they don't want to deal with the pain anymore. Another song is \"Baby Don't Cut\" by B-Mike. This song also means so much to me because I have felt pretty low before, but my friend song me this song and it helped me through so much.\n\nThere is a lot more songs than I named in this blog. Music helps me get through whatever I'm dealing with. No matter what's going on, I can just put in music and within a little while I feel better; music is my escape. Music is like a river that flows away from the real world."
