        "text": "Born in 1965 in the Icelandic capital city of Reykjavik, the daughter of Gudmundur Gunnarsson (an electrician) and Hildur Hauksdóttir who divorced before her second birthday, Björk grew up in a hippie-type community with her mother and her seven siblings. She started to study classical music at the age of 5 and released her first album in 1977 (mainly traditional Icelandic folk songs and international hits translated to Icelandic) when she was only 11. During her teenage years Björk became involved in several bands, most of them punk: Spit & Snot (1977), Exodus (1979-80), Jam 80 (1980), Tappi Tíkarrass (1981-83) (featured the documentary Rokk í Reykjavík (1982)) and Kukl (1984-86). She then formed the pop group The Sugarcubes with Einar Örn Benediktsson and Sigtryggur Baldursson and eventually other members Þór Eldon (with whom she had a son in 1986), Margrét Örnólfsdóttir and Bragi Ólafsson. The band released its first single in 1986 and its first album, \"Life's Too Good\", in 1988, and discovered international success, especially in UK. While touring in the US with the Sugarcubes, Björk met Boris Acosta, a music connoisseur and now a film producer and director, who told her she would be very successful in the years to come. She was shocked to hear that and gracefully thanked him for his sweet words. During her Sugarcubes years, Björk also collaborated with the Icelandic jazz group Gudmundar Ingólfssonar Trio for the album \"Gling-Glo\" in 1990, and featured 808 State's \"Ooops\", which was the start of her electronic music interest. The Sugarcubes eventually split after a few albums in 1992 and in 1993. Björk released her first solo album, \"Debut\", in collaboration with producer Nellee Hooper. The worldwide success of the album (nearly 3 million copies sold) made possible her second album, \"Post\", in 1995, also with help of not only Nellee Hooper but techno gurus Graham Massey (from 808 State), Howie B. and Tricky, followed by the remix album \"Telegram\" the year after. After some problems in the UK, where she lived, she decided to go to Spain to record her third album, \"Homogenic\", released in 1997. Her main collaborators were the 'Icelandic String Octet', Mark Bell (from LFO), Mark Stent and again Howie B, and the album may be her most electronic. After Danish director Lars von Trier discovered her in the music video of \"It's Oh So Quiet\", he asked her to play the main role and to compose the music for his new movie Dancer in the Dark (2000). She won the Best Actress Prize in the Cannes Festival, and said that it would be her only cinema performance (although she'd already acted in the Icelandic movie Der Wacholderbaum (1990)) because it was too painful for her and because she considered herself a music artist and not a cinema artist. The original soundtrack was re-worked by her before being released as an album under the title \"Selmasongs\" in September 2000 (including a new version of the duet song \"I've Seen it All\" with Thom Yorke). Her fourth album, probably the most quiet, \"Vespertine\", featured a chamber orchestra, an Icelandic choir and harpist Zeena Parkins, and was also a successful collaboration with Matmos. She then successively released a book of photos and texts, series of DVD, a Greatest Hits album and two special boxes (\"Family Tree\" and \"Björk Box\"). She also took time to marry artist Matthew Barney, with whom she had a daughter in 2002. In August 2004 she composed and sang \"Oceania\" for the Opening Ceremony of the Olympic Games in Athens. This song was featured on her fifth album, \"Medúlla\", released about two weeks after the ceremony. It is mostly made with vocals and some titles are close to experimental music, featuring choirs, Inuit singer Tanya Tagaq, Japanese artist Dokaka, Robert Wyatt, Rahzel and Mike Patton, but also collaborating again with programmers Matmos, Mark Bell and Mark \"Spike\" Stent.\n\nPrince Rogers Nelson was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, to Mattie Shaw, a jazz singer and social worker, and John L. Nelson, a lyricist and pianist. His father's stage name was \"Prince Rogers\". His parents were both from African-American families from Louisiana. They separated during his youth, which lead him to move back and forth. Prince had a troubled relationship with his step-father which lead him to run away from home. Prince was adopted by a family called the Andersons. Prince soon after became friends with the Anderson's son, Andre Anderson (Cymone) together along with Charles Smith they joined a band called Grand Central. The band later renamed themselves Champagne and were a fairly successful live band, however soon diminished.\n\nPrince at the age of eighteen started working on high-quality demo tracks with Chris Moon. With these demo tracks Prince eventually ended up signing a recording contract with Warner Brothers Records and was the youngest producer associated with the label. Prince made his debut on the record label with his 1978 album, For You. It wasn't a strong successful album, however it was fair for a beginning artist and ranked 163 on the U.S. Pop Charts. Prince's next releases would tend to do much better on the charts with his singles, \"Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?\" and I Wanna Be Your Lover in 1979. This would start to introduce Prince as a person who presented sexually explicit material into the music industry. However Prince didn't begin to attract mainstream artists until he release his single, 1999. This single began to be noticed by M.T.V. viewers and this would make him a part of the main-stream music media. Prince released two more singles called Little Red Corvette and Delirious. The album featured Prince's new band, The Revolution. In 1984 Prince would release what would be seen as an admired and profound masterpiece the feature film/sound-track album, Purple Rain in 1984. Prince's father contributed to this album, by cowriting the chord sequence for a couple of his songs. Prince continued to give cowriting credit to his father on several other albums, as his famous chord sequence would be used in several of Prince's singles and albums.\n\nA lot of Prince's songs did not agree with listeners and one of his songs, Darling Nikki prompted a group of people to start a censorship organization called, Parents Music Resource Center (P.M.R.C.) as the track implemented grinding ludicrous acts such as masturbating, which stunned listeners. Prince however continued to release various other singles with the same platform his memorable releases being, Around The World In A Day, Parade, Love Sexy, and Batman.\n\nPrince released a sequel to Purple Rain in 1990 called Graffiti Bridge, a soundtrack album accompanied this movie entitled, Graffiti Bridge. The film did terrible in box-office and was nominated for several Razzie awards. Many people saw the sound-track album, as the high point of the film.\n\nIn 1991, Prince assembled a new band called, The New Power Generation with this band he would release singles such as Diamond And Pearls, Cream, and Gett Off. Prince eventually changed his stage name from Prince to a symbol, which lead people to call him, \"The Artist Formerly Known As Prince\". Prince soon took back his old stage name.\n\nIn the 1990s, Prince continued to release singles such as Came, The Gold Experience, Chaos And Disorder, and Emancipation. With the rise of the new millennium, Prince released material such as a religious album called The Rainbow Children,One Nite Alone,The Chocolate Invasion,The Slaughter House, and had a collaboration with Stevie Wonder on Stevie's single called, What The Fuss in 2005.\n\nPrince died on April 21, 2016 in Chanhassen, Minnesota, at his Paisley Park recording studio complex. He was 57.\n\nPrince will be remembered as a musician and artist who inspired millions through his music, and set an inspirational platform which others still abide by.\n\nThe Zombies were formed in 1961 by students Rod Argent, Paul Atkinson and Hugh Grundy. They later brought in bassist Paul Arnold, who in turn brought in Colin Blunstone as lead singer. They first called themselves The Mustangs, then The Sundowners, before finally settling on The Zombies. The band began its musical career performing 1950s rock standards at various clubs, dances and other venues, which was common for young rock bands at the time.\n\nArnold decided that he really didn't want a musical career (he eventually became a doctor) and left the band, to be replaced by Chris White. The band began gathering a following in mid-1962 in the St. Albans area. In 1963 they were approaching college age and began to discuss breaking up, as several members were thinking about going to university. That same year they entered a rock contest in which first prize was a recording contract with Decca Records. They made the finals and, even before the winner was chosen, they impressed Decca executives so much that they were offered a contract anyway (as it turned out, they actually did win the contest). In 1963 they began recording for Decca. The producer assigned by the label to work with them heard a song written by Argent, \"She's Not There\", and strongly pushed for it to be released as the group's first single. It became an immediate smash. It was played on a British music show, Juke Box Jury (1959)--a British version of Bandstand (1952)--and, as it happened, George Harrison of The Beatles was on the panel that week and loved the song. It wasn't long before the record shot to #1 on the US pop charts.\n\nThe next single, \"Leave Me Be\", didn't do particularly well, but their following one, \"Tell Her No\", made the Top 10 in the US (although, for some reason, it was only a minor hit in Britain). The band toured the US with such artists as Patti LaBelle, The Shirelles and Ben E. King, among others. As successful as they were in the US, they were an even bigger hit in Asia (in The Philippines they once had five records in the Top 10 at the same time).\n\nIn 1965 the band did the soundtrack for the film Bunny Lake ist verschwunden (1965), and made a brief appearance in the film as themselves. Unfortunately, the film was not successful. In addition, the records they were putting out didn't sell well. The band also began having problems with Decca, which they believed wasn't letting them do the kind of music they wanted to do, and they eventually split from the label. They were signed by CBS Records, for which they recorded the album \"Odessey and Oracle\", which was finished at The Beatles' Abbey Road Studios in 1967. After the album was done, the band broke up. Although CBS didn't want to release an album by a band that no longer existed, CBS staff producer Al Kooper--the founder of Blood Sweat & Tears--finally persuaded them to release it, and it came out in July of 1968. The first single from the album, \"Care of Cell 44\", didn't do particularly well, and neither did the next two tracks that were released as singles. The label agreed to release one more cut off the album as a single, and no more. That cut was \"Time of the Season\". It went nowhere in the UK, but a radio station DJ in the US was entranced by it and kept playing it over and over. It began to catch on, and by late 1968 it had cracked the Top Five charts in the US. Although CBS wanted the band to re-group for more albums and concert promoters offered the band enormous sums of money to re-form and tour, by this time the band had already been broken up for a year--by which time Rod Argent and Chris White had already formed the band Aster Argent and Colin Blunstone had embarked on a solo career--and the members declined. They did reunite in 1991 to record the album \"New World\", but it was never released in the US (where the band was always a bigger draw than they were in the UK). On November 25, 1997, all of the original band members reunited on stage at The Jazz Club in London and played live together for the first time in almost 30 years. Three years later Rod Argent and Bluntone began touring together. Although they used their individual names, promoters began to bill them as The Zombies, and the duo eventually went along with it.\n\nPaul Atkinson, who had retired as a performer and began a career as an A&R man, died in Santa Monica, Califonria, on April 1, 2004."
