        "text": "Allow me to begin by stating, quite plainly, that last night was an electrifying experience.\n\nAs a long time fan of Frank Iero, the former guitarist of My Chemical Romance, I jumped at the opportunity to attend his performance on August 3rd at the Paper Tiger. I expected nothing but greatness from Iero and his new cast of talented musicians, The Future Violents, who all come from various walks of life, most notably Tucker Rule, his drummer and the drummer of the legendary post-hardcore outfit, Thursday, along with Matt Armstrong on bass, Evan Nestor on guitar and backing vocals, and Kayleigh Goldsworthy on the keys and violin. My expectations were spot on.\n\nAfter a beautiful opening performance from Geoff Rickly (the lead vocalist of Thursday) complete with performances of classic Thursday tunes, Geoff’s own brooding ballads, and stories reminiscing on a tortured past that led to a few funny encounters and, later, a long road to recovery, I realized that the greatness I had expected was most certainly going to be exceeded throughout the night\n\nAfter, Rickly’s set, I chatted with the girls around me as we anticipated the Future Violents’ arrival on stage. As the lights dimmed, I could actually feel the excitement in the room building, and once the band was on stage, the rest was a whirlwind. Heads were bobbing, hands were clapping, girls were screaming, and the band’s energy was nothing short of intense.\n\nThe band performed old hits and new, including “.weighted.,” “BFF,” “Young and Doomed,” and the song from their newest music video, “Great Party,” and the crowd did not stop moving until the band was off stage for good. If you have ever been a fan of Frank Iero, punk-rock, or just an all-around good show, I suggest catching this band on one of their remaining tour dates listed here: https://frank-iero.com and if you can’t make it to one of their upcoming dates, I suggest listening to both Frank Iero and the Future Violents and Geoff Rickly on Spotify/Bandcamp and keeping up with the members on their Instagrams, listed below.\n\n-RCT, photographer\n\nMy portfolio (which will soon include more images from the show): https://rinichristinaphoto.wixsite.com/rinichristinaphoto\n\nThe amazing Geoff Rickly:\n\nMusic: https://geoffrickly.bandcamp.com/album/mixtape-1\n\nThursday (Rickly & Rule): https://open.spotify.com/artist/61awhbNK16ku1uQyXRsQj5?si=KkXzchoLSfuCwXiBBqsoaQ\n\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/geoffrickly/\n\nThe dazzling Frank Iero and the Future Violents:\n\nMusic: https://open.spotify.com/artist/75CziSb5bEWIj1m8TdMwYy?si=jt5HuPaGQoeYenP_IUJ8zw\n\nMembers:\n\nEvan Nestor (Guitar): https://www.instagram.com/tipgiblets/\n\nMatt Armstrong (Bass): https://www.instagram.com/thesituationist/\n\nTucker Rule (Drummer): https://www.instagram.com/tuckerrule/\n\nKayleigh Goldsworthy (Keys/Violin): https://www.instagram.com/kayleighgolds/\n\nFrank Iero (Lead Vocals/Guitar): https://www.instagram.com/frankieromustdie/\n\nDon’t mess with Mrs. Grey! Anastasia has two new titles – wife and editor – and has now become a force to be reckoned with. No longer the timid Anastasia, she’s determined not to loose herself. She will not allow Christian to dominate her outside of the “red room.” In this story, Ana seems to be the one “calling the shots.” She’s constantly defying Christians instructions and it’s making him crazy. She’s also fearless and will do anything to protect her family.\n\n“50 Shades Freed” is probably the best book and movie adaptation of the entire E.L. James franchise. It goes beyond being an X-rated love story and builds into a suspenseful drama. If only all of the “Fifty Shades” books had this type of story line where the sex is secondary to the plot.\n\nThis movie opens with the wedding vows, followed by various scenes from the romantic and steamy honeymoon, making some girls wish they had a man with the finances of Christian Grey! The honeymoon is cut short by the news of a break-in and fire at Christian’s business office. Jack Hyde (Ana’s former boss) is determined to make her and Christian pay for their happiness and his self-serving misery. If you haven’t read the books, I won’t spoil the plot for you, go see the movie. It is the last movie of the series, so it ends with a montage of scenes from all three movies.\n\nI was invited to screen the movie by the Sly Fox Club at the Santikos Casa Blanca Theater. The theater seats over 200 people and every seat was full; I was almost turned away. I was lucky enough to get the last of the cool gifts (shown in the photo) that were given out to various audience members. The mirror compact is really nice. Unfortunately, mine fell on the floor and cracked.\n\n“Fifty Shades Freed” opens Friday, just in time for Valentine’s Day. It goes without saying that it is for mature, adults only. If you are in the San Antonio area, I recommend seeing it at Santikos Casa Blanca Theater; the seats are really comfortable. “Fifty Shades Freed” is a perfect date night flick. You may want to go to the earlier show and plan for some alone time afterwards 😉 (I’m just saying!)\n\nEnjoy the show and come back and tell me what you think. – BMT\n\nJames Corden did a great job hosting the live broadcast on CBS of the 60th Annual Grammy Awards from Madison Square Garden in New York City.

A must see, if you haven’t, and a good one to see again if you have!\n\n“Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” – Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in a letter from Birmingham Jail, April 16, 1963.- BMT\n\nLink to Original Facebook Post\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ReviewsoftheArtsSA/posts/804739179591776\n\nOr Read it Right Here\n\nReview – Selma Movie – directed by Ava DuVernay\n\nIn one word – Powerful!\n\nFantastic performances by David Oyelowo, Oprah Winfrey Cuba Gooding, Jr.and the entire cast. The cast is a diverse group of actors that were carefully selected. Most of the actors look like the actual key players from the movement. The cinematographic use of lighting was fantastic.\n\nSpeaking for myself, a Generation Xer, I didn’t fully understand the magnitude of the oppression and the brutality that African Americans and their supporters faced during the early 60s and the “peaceful” marches lead by Dr. King. I only heard about the freedom marches in school history books, reprinted news articles, and short clips of old news footage. “Selma” gives insight into the “back stories” of the marchers and brings the characters from the history books to life. Their faith in the Lord, in Dr. King’s vision, and their passion to fully obtain their God-given rights kept them strong and fearless. After seeing this movie and understanding the lengths they went to, to be able to vote, every person who is of age to vote should exercise that right every time!\n\nThese civil rights activists can be considered modern-day martyrs – heroes. They all marched knowing the dangers they would face. Just as our Lord gave himself up, knowing he would be put on the cross and like so many others that died for their causes. I believe this is why Dr. King called for members of the clergy throughout the U.S. to march with him. As an Orthodox Christian, I heard that His Eminence Archbishop Iakovos supported Dr. King, but I didn’t realize he actually marched with him across the bridge in Selma.\n\nThe movie starts out very dark and progressively gets brighter signifying the accomplishment of their mission at the Birmingham courthouse. It was impressive to see the direct impact that Martin Luther King, Jr. and all his followers’ (black and white) march from Selma to Birmingham had on President Johnson’s effecting laws ensuring the voting rights of African Americans. Proof that violence isn’t necessary to effectuate change.\n\nYou may find these articles interesting.\n\nhttp://www.toledoblade.com/…/Unitarian-minister-recalls-nig…\n\nhttp://usa.greekreporter.com/…/black-history-month-and-the…/\n\nWhen you see the movie, look at this photo. It’s amazing how much the movie characters look just like the people in the photo!\n\nSelma Movie is definately Oscar worthy! It opens Friday, January 9 – see it! – BMT\n\nComments, Please\n\nWhat do you think? Please post your comments, memories, or favorite quotes."
