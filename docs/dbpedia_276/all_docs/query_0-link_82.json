        "text": "Category: Reviews\n\nArctic Monkeys Live at Bill Graham Civic Auditorium\n\nWords and photos by Jenna Ethridge\n\nOn Oct. 20, Arctic Monkeys performed their first of two sold-out shows at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco. Following the release of their latest album since 2013, Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino, the English rock band embarked on a world-wide tour that spanned over the course of four months.\n\nMini Mansions supported them on tour – a band from Los Angeles comprised of Zach Dawes (bassist for The Last Shadow Puppets), Tyler Parkford and Michael Shuman (bassist of Queens of the Stone Age). Arctic Monkeys and Mini Mansions have an extensive musical history together, as The Last Shadow Puppets is the alternate band of Arctic Monkeys’ frontman, Alex Turner. Mini Mansions also have a song in collaboration with Turner, “Vertigo,” which was performed, though Turner did not join them on stage to contribute vocals.\n\nTheir most recent EP, Works Every Time, was released on Sept. 28 of this year, from which they performed “Midnight in Tokyo” and the EP’s title track, “Works Every Time.” The band had an infectious energy that was reciprocated by the audience, as the auditorium erupted into applause following each song and fans screamed the names of their favorite songs, in hopes of hearing them live.\n\nAfter an incredible 40 minute set, Mini Mansions left the stage and the anticipation for Arctic Monkeys grew rapidly.\n\nArctic Monkeys took the stage shortly after, Turner sporting a recent haircut drastically different from his usual image of slicked back, long locks. The stage was elaborately decorated with large, bright light fixtures and smoke that illuminated the band’s silhouettes. The band opened with “Four Out Of Five,” a song from their most recent album that has gained tremendous media coverage, such as on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. Other new songs performed from Tranquility Base Hotel & Casino included the album’s title track, “One Point Perspective,” “American Sports” and “Star Treatment.”\n\nThe rest of their discography was also respectably represented, featuring songs from 2006’s Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not, 2007’s Favourite Worst Nightmare, 2009’s Humbug and 2013’s AM. Popular songs such as “505,” “Do I Wanna Know?” and “R U Mine?” proved their timelessness, as they evoked the most intense reactions from the audience. Arctic Monkeys’ fans are notorious for their dedication to the band, evident by the large crowd that had already gathered outside of the venue as early as six in the morning on the day of the show.\n\nAfter a much anticipated encore that was accompanied by a cubular disco ball, the band left the stage and audience wanting more. As mentioned, they returned the following night for yet another sold-out show, before concluding their tour in the Pacific Northwest. The success of this year’s album and tour prove that the Arctic Monkeys haven’t lost their touch, even despite their five-year hiatus and slight change of sound.\n\nThough Turner sings about playing “to quiet rooms like this before,” San Francisco was anything but quiet.\n\nFather John Misty Live at the Hollywood Bowl\n\nWords by Jenna Ethridge\n\nFollowing the release of his latest album, God’s Favorite Customer, Father John Misty officially commenced his current tour at the Hollywood Bowl this past Sunday. Father John Misty, also known as Grammy award-winning singer/songwriter, Josh Tillman, was accompanied by Big Thief and Gillian Welch: an artist that Tillman has personally wished to share a marquee with since his alias was “a lot less stupid.”\n\nAs the audience was subjected to an apocalyptic visual of the Hollywood Hills engulfed in flames, provided by the Pure Comedy short film released earlier last year, Tillman entered the stage adorned in all white and debuting his newest look- consisting of short hair and a trimmed beard- in stark comparison to his typical image. “Funtimes in Babylon” served as an appropriate opener to his set, as Tillman warned the audience of his arrival and presence in the venue’s location of Hollywood, which was extremely fitting considering his recent cameo in Hotel Artemis for which he also released the song “Gilded Cage”, independent from his album released the same week. Songs such as “Hollywood Forever Cemetery Sings” and “Only Son of the Ladiesman” also paid homage to his residency in Los Angeles, as Tillman sang about the Sunset Strip and of being a Dodgers fan, likely helping him win over those in the audience priorly unfamiliar with his material. Though promoting God’s Favorite Customer, the setlist included a variety of songs from all four studio albums that seemed to flow together effortlessly, providing the audience with a fair representation of Tillman and his musical thematics.\n\nThough the majority of the show lacked his usual on-stage banter and improvised commentary, Tillman still managed to make the audience laugh after shocking them with lyrics as presented in “Pure Comedy”, acknowledging its probable impression and reassuring that “it gets worse.” Evident by his performances of “Mr. Tillman” and “Date Night”, songs from God’s Favorite Customer translated extremely well live, as Tillman sauvely paraded around the stage with a sense of confidence and enjoyment similar to “The Ideal Husband”. With help from his orchestrative ensemble, Tillman was also successful in transforming his slower songs into even more brooding ballads, as he took to the piano for an intimate performance of “Just Dumb Enough to Try”. While the deprecating motif of God’s Favorite Customer is already perceptible through the studio recordings, Tillman’s vulnerability manifested even greater live, as animated images of flowers bloomed behind him during “Please Don’t Die”- symbols of fertility and revival that were reminiscent of those portrayed in the music video released earlier this month through Sub Pop and Bella Union. The stage’s dramatic lighting also contributed to the intensity of songs such as “Things It Would’ve Been Helpful to Know Before the Revolution”, as bright beams danced sporadically around the stage and the song progressed into its chorus.\n\nFor an artist with such a theatrical stage presence, the Hollywood Bowl was an ideal homecoming for Tillman’s extravagant demeanor and awe-inspiring music. Look out Hollywood, here Father John Misty comes.\n\nThe Sherlocks’ Last Night in America November 9, 2017\n\nReview and photos by Lilli Banks\n\nNovember 9, 2017\n\nDC9 Nightclub, Washington, D.C.\n\nFrom Sheffield, England, The Sherlocks took a trip to North America to promote their new album. Their indie alternative music has thousands of people shouting the lyrics to their songs and selling out venues throughout United Kingdom. Building their fanbase, they opened for bands such as Kings of Leon and The Libertines and soon to open for Liam Gallagher on his European tour in 2018.\n\nAfter seven years of being a band, the two sets of brothers released their debut album, “Live for the Moment” in mid-August of this year. The album featured singles from years prior and new tracks that hit #6 in the UK charts.\n\nWith the success of their album, they set off on a UK, European, and North American tour. They performed in the US back in March of 2016 for SWSX in Texas, but their first headline tour was this November, starting in Toronto.\n\nThe band kicked off the set with their song, “Last Night” and the crowd was immediately enticed. Although it was the last night of tour, they never let their energy falter. Their tunes “Blue” and “Will You Be There?” roared through DC9 Nightclub bringing those from the downstairs bar and staff.\n\n“Turn the Clock,” arrived on the setlist and the acoustic guitar was brought out. The crowd was thrilled to hear a slower song that showed another side of the band.\n\nKiaran, the lead singer and guitarist, took a moment to say, “We’re ending our first tour in Washington, D.C. just how we wanted it,” which made the crowd yell with happiness and cheering.\n\nAs the upbeat songs came back, pairs of friends danced in the crowd with the beer in their hands. An older adult was front and center, mesmerized by the band. Andy, the bassist, had a huge smile on his face seeing how the crowd was reacting to them.\n\nThe band knocked the night and tour out with Chasing Shadows. Soon enough, this band will be filling venues of the USA and we’re excited to see them progress!\n\nThe band will be returning to the USA in January 2018 to the West Coast. The first date on January 16th in Los Angeles at The Echo.\n\nYou can find tickets and dates for their return here.\n\nTheir debut album streams on Spotify and iTunes/Apple Music.\n\nFollow The Sherlocks on social media!\n\nInstagram\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nTropicalia 2017 Recap\n\nWords by Corynne Fernandez and photos by Kayla Fernandez\n\nSeparating itself from other California festivals, Tropicalia was a true testament to unity through diversity. From their unequivocal lineup that was composed of acts like Los Tigres Del Norte and King Krule, to their seamless-execution of the So-Cal tropic theme, and the highly sought for free-tacos, the festival was a success on all parts with minimal hiccups along the way. We had the chance to cover some of the most anticipated new acts and document their performances below. Thank you to the media team at Tropicalia for being the sweetest group of people as well!\n\nCurrent Joys:\n\nRinging in the day’s festivities, was Current Joys. While festival goers made their way in, the crowd for their set was in full force, igniting mosh pits and echoing the group’s lyrics throughout.\n\nSurf Curse:\n\nThe band comprised of Nick Rattigan, lead singer from Current Joys, and Jacob Rubeck, carried the same energy through their set. With co-singer, Rattigan, never missing a beat and Rubeck equally interacting with the frenzied crowd, the duo played hits like Doom Generation, Freaks, and Goth Babe.\n\nJorja Smith:\n\nPerhaps one of the most anticipated new artists was England native, Jorja Smith; most of the crowd at the Dia De Los Puercos stage had been waiting from the start of the festival for her set. Even with little movement, Smith and her accompanying band captured not only her audience but onlookers from other stages and the infamous taco lines, playing brand new songs from her latest EP, as well as fan favorite, Blue Lights.\n\nInner Wave:\n\nWe had the chance to catch Inner Wave—a favorite of Lucid Dreams (check out our interview here)—while they played at the Mota Stage to their largest crowd. For many, it was the first time hearing the band, while others had flown from out of state solely to see the group. Needless to say, Inner Wave did not disappoint, and elicited a retrogressive synergy with songs like Bower, Discipline, and American Spirits.\n\nThe Buttertones:\n\nAmongst all the acts, the best dressed had to be the collective Buttertones, in which they set the tone for their signature surfer-soul discography, and paid homage to the tailored looked that characterized the 50’s and 60’s. Throughout the entirety of the set, not one sun-kissed head was still, and the 5-piece thrived off what the crowd gave so enthusiastically. What set the Buttertones apart was their use of sax in combo with their unique rock, doo-wop additions, creating an ambience unlike any other.\n\nCuco:\n\nOur first introduction to the main stage also happened to be our first introduction to rising Latino-heartthrob, Cuco. His fanbase was larger than life and vocalized their appreciation during every song which varied from melodic tunes in both English and Spanish. Still coming into his own onstage, the somewhat sheepish energy added to the overall dream-filled performance with the occasional tempo shifts.\n\nYellow Days:\n\nAs the sun was setting, there was no better time for emerging UK artist, Yellow Days to come on and soundtrack the hazy sunset with his fuzzy jazz-inspired riffs and languorous gritty vocals. Being his first show in the US, he amassed a vast crowd of devoted listeners and new-comers alike, all enthralled by every raw bellow.\n\nKing Krule:\n\nAmid the stellar lineup, long-awaited act, King Krule, made his way to the center of the blue-lit main stage and delivered his characteristically violent yet tender harmonies that set the crowd aflame, which seemingly went on for miles. Despite a set delay, Archie (performing under the name King Krule) left little for the audience to yearn for, performing a variety of songs from his debut LP, 6 Feet Beneath the Moon, and his new album, The OOZ, for which he is currently touring.\n\nKali Uchis:\n\nOne of our favorites from Tropicalia, was Columbian female-artist, Kali Uchis; gracing the stage in her Selena-esque ensemble, Uchis, brought an experience unique to her performance. Looking around, there was not one person that wasn’t belting the lyrics to songs like Melting, Speed, and Loner among the diverse sea of people. Kali delivered not only with her own work, but also covered Al Green’s RnB classic, Let’s Stay Together, and sang her feature in Tyler The Creator’s, See You Again.\n\nBane’s World:\n\nClosing out the night as one of last sets, was the subdued and dream-ensuing Bane’s World. Like many of the other acts at the fest, this was the group’s first run at a festival and while their set neared midnight, that did not stop festival-goers from swarming their stage, swooning for every note. Different from their defining hazy tunes, the band also jokingly covered Radiohead’s, Creep, and fellow Long Beach natives, Sublime’s, Santeria. With playful interjections and shy lulls, Bane’s World left the crowd—certainly all the ladies—in a trance and grasping for more songs as their set was cut short. Read our interview with Shane of Bane’s World here.\n\nPhoenix: Ti Amo Tour – Show Review\n\nBy Sara Valenzuela\n\nThe Anthem opened it’s doors this year; bringing in the most legendary bands such as The Foo Fighters, LCD Soundsystem, and Phoenix as their first couple of acts in October. I had the amazing opportunity to witness French indie rockers: Phoenix take the stage. It was a show I’ve been recommending everyone I possibly can to watch since the date a couple weeks ago. The Versaille-based band always leaves me buzzing for days after their performances; they’re simply unforgettable.\n\nAs soon as Phoenix emerged onto the stage, the crowd was roaring. DC had missed the four-piece band composed by lead Thomas Mars, bassist Deck D’arcy, and guitarist Christian Mazzalai and Laurent Brancowitz, since their last bout in the city a few months ago. Introducing the night with the first beats to J-Boy, it was impossible for the audience and the band not to burst into an Italian-disco frenzy! From the light show to Mars jumping into the crowd, it was a celebration from beginning to end. They performed tracks from ‘romantic, glossy, soft-pop ode to sweet escapes and dance floors’ new album Ti Amo as well as illustrious past hits.\n\nDC thundered through every song, and the atmospheric crowd did not disappoint. I looked back from GA during their prominent track 1901, to admire the moment. I remember seeing the crowd, in the multiple-level venue, spring up and down rich with joy. Never missing a beat or an opportunity to show their appreciation, Phoenix was the hero of DC that night.\n\nKeep up with Phoenix!\n\nTheir Website\n\nTwitter\n\nFacebook\n\nInstagram\n\nListen to them on Spotify!\n\nKing Shelter at The Metro Gallery\n\nBy Sara Valenzuela\n\nKing Shelter and friends rocked the Metro Gallery, bringing Baltimore some fun on a hot friday night. King Shelter is an independent indie/alternative rock band based out of Southern California. They’re currently touring with The Frights and On Drugs on their Wet Hot Summer Tour, up to September 9th (get your tickets here). The band has been pretty busy this year with the release of their new singles ‘Gimmie Knowledge’ and ‘Gholy Host’, also touring the west coast with their friends The Frights and Hunny. Hope to see more of King Shelter in the DMV in the near future, they’ll keep us waiting till then.\n\nFollow King Shelter on Twitter!\n\nListen to King Shelter on Spotify!\n\nBuy King Shelter’s Merch!\n\nNeon Indian Live at The Teragram Ballroom\n\nPhotos and words by Kayla Fernandez\n\nHailing from Denton, Texas, Neon Indian (Alan Palomo) made his way to starry-lit downtown LA to perform a sold out gig at the Teregram Ballroom. Palomo’s endless energetic dance moves kept the crowd alive. From performing older hits like “Mind Drips” to covering Prince’s “Pop Life”, Neon Indian kept the audience on their toes. Palomo never missed a beat and carried that charisma throughout the entire set, inspiring the crowd to try and mimic his hip swaying dance moves. Having seen Neon Indian before, I can say this is the best I’ve seen him yet; he illuminated the room with laughter, cheers, and the audience’s echoes of his songs.\n\nReview + Photos: Current Joys\n\nReview and Photos by Corynne Fernandez\n\nAs the crowd poured into The Echo last night for Reno natives, Current Joys sold out show, there was an all-encompassing sense of excitement and eagerness. Prior to Current Joys taking stage, Gap Girls and Bane’s World opened up the night, both giving dreamy performances that made the audience swoon for every note.\n\nBy the time Current Joys made their way on, everyone was teeming with bottled up energy, and as soon as Nick Rattigan—lead singer and guitarist— started with one of the many songs on their diverse set list, the room transformed into a jumping frenzy. Songs like ‘New Flesh’ and ‘My Motorcycle’ ignited a mass sing-along only adding to the night’s vitality. What was really distinct about the whole evening was the understanding between the audience and the band—each one fed off what they gave the other. That notion proved to be more true as the set drew to a close, with Nick performing the last few songs solo. While the venue was already pretty intimate, everything fell into place perfectly for those final moments leaving everyone on a high.\n\nReview + Gallery: Frank Iero and the Patience\n\nReview by Lilli Banks\n\nPhotos by Sara Valenzuela\n\nA Friday night in Washington, D.C. is never a dull one. Frank Iero and the Patience (consisting of Frank Iero: Lead Singer + Guitar, Evan Nestor Guitar+ Backup Vocals, Alex Grippo: Bass, Matt Olson: Drummer + Backup Vocals) brought their sound to U Street! On their US run, they promoted sophomore album, “Parachutes” released last October. In the fall, the New Jersey based band will be heading to Europe and the UK to promote their music overseas.\n\nFrank, the lead singer and guitarist, started various projects after the breakup of the world known band, My Chemical Romance (MCR). Frank Iero and the Patience released their debut album, “Stomachaches” in 2014, still keeping the alternative rock scene that he brought to his past work.\n\nLoyal fans that reign from MCR continue to show support to his new music! The dedicated fans from DC mentioned how they saw him back in MCR and they were thrilled that he was back. The band put all their energy into their electric performance and interacting with the audience! Frank was overjoyed at the crowd and the enormous support he has received since.\n\nAfter the show, a few preview photos were released to get our readers excited for what’s to come. Frank’s fans quickly saw and the internet was ecstatic! They made sure to comment on his recent ‘hair makeover’. The first photos to debut it were the buzz on Tumblr and other social media!\n\nNeedless to say, the band put up an impressive performance and won DC over. Their fan base is strong and continuing to grow. We hope to hear great things from Frank Iero and the Patience soon. DC will definitely be waiting for their return to the local stages.\n\nKeep up with the band on Frank’s Twitter\n\nYou can find their upcoming UK and European tour dates here.\n\nGallery + Review: Broods\n\nBy Lilli Banks\n\nNew Zealand’s own BROODS stopped at Rams Head Live in Baltimore last month while on their 12 date North American Tour! BROODS are known for Georgia and Caleb Nott, brother and sister, as they started the band together.\n\nGeorgia, lead singer, mentioned how they have heard stories about Rams Head Live being a venue that many people love and are eager to play. They were more than happy to be in Baltimore.\n\nGeorgia moved along the stage with her exquisite dance moves and connecting with each side of the audience. All their fans were in awe and singing along happy as ever!\n\nA trend with Rams Head Live is that it holds the same types of people that you see: the jocks, couples, loners, fanatics. Each person is different with how they react to seeing a concert.\n\nLots of people let their hair loose and danced more than other shows I have seen, especially in Baltimore. BROODS music makes you want to dance with your friend and enjoy the night!\n\nThey took a chance to slow down the night. They wanted to connect and talk to the audience since the venue allowed that intimacy. They mentioned a little bit of how they came together. They sang “Mad World” which was a song that helped initiate the band. The crowd helped them sing and it brought such a wondrous smile to the bands faces!\n\nThey were more than thankful for the crowd that came out and put on a show that makes you want more.\n\nIf BROODS comes to a city near you, bring a group of friends, prepare to let go and enjoy yourself!\n\nListen to their second album titled, “Conscious” which was just released last year here."
