        "text": "THIS IS HOW I DISAPPEAR\n\nI started this project almost three months ago, thinking it’d be a longer series of shorter blurbs about bands that I got made fun of for liking by my hardcore friends when I was in middle and high school. I thought I would maybe get a few clicks on my previously-dead blog and perhaps find some interesting things to say about bands that people to this day don’t take quite as seriously as they should.\n\nInstead, I’ve found myself exploring what a bunch of bands have meant to me over the years, examining my own experiences with nostalgia, reckoning with mistakes that my idols have made, learning how mainstream music has changed since the early-mid 2000s, and relearning what made me fall in love with these bands in the first place. I’ve gotten tons of positive feedback, a surprising amount of traffic, and I even managed to parlay it into my first professionally published article. I feel so eternally grateful. I also learned that I can’t phone these articles in, and that I should only write about bands here that mean a lot to me.\n\nSo, for my final article in this series, I want to talk about the band of all bands that you were not allowed to like, and a band that means more to me than any band I’ve covered so far aside from Fall Out Boy: My Chemical Romance.\n\nI actually didn’t get into My Chemical Romance until long after I had gotten into DIY hardcore. I was definitely aware of Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge when it came out because “Helena (So Long & Goodnight)” and “I’m Not Okay (I Promise)” were quite literally inescapable, but everything changed for me one sleepy day in 2006 or 2007. My little brother, Ethan, came home from school and said that he had heard a song he really liked and wanted me to put it on the iPod Shuffle that our family shared. This wasn’t uncommon practice, because my dad had taught me how to pirate music when I was very young, so my brother would often ask me to download things for him. This time, the song he wanted was “Teenagers,” by My Chemical Romance. I thought I’d do him a solid and download the band’s discography for him. I didn’t think much of it at the time, but the following week, I was bored and decided to listen to the band’s first album, I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love, on a whim. Over a decade later, and my love affair with My Chemical Romance, vampire-like, refuses to die.\n\nSKYLINES & TURNSTILES\n\nMy Chemical Romance’s origins in 9/11 have been talked about to death, but in case you somehow have not heard the story: Gerard Way was a struggling New Jersey cartoonist in 2001 who took a ferry to New York to pitch a show to Adult Swim. He witnessed the fall of the Twin Towers (later writing the first My Chem song, “Skylines & Turnstiles,” about the experience) and decided to walk away from cartoons and comics (for a time, anyway) to “do something with his life,” soon forming a band with friend and drummer Matt “Otter” Pelissier. They roped in the impressively afro’d Ray Toro as guitarist when it was discovered that Gerard could not sing and play guitar at the same time. Gerard’s younger brother, Mikey, learned bass so he could be in the band once he heard some early demos that they cut in Otter’s attic; Mikey is also responsible for naming the band, after seeing Irvine Welsh’s book Ecstasy: Three Tales of Chemical Romance in the Barnes & Noble where he was working. The “My” was added later to add a personal dimension to the name– in a typically dark and tongue-in-cheek way, it could also refer to the drinking and drug habits of Gerard, which would inform much of the subject matter on the first two My Chem records.\n\nOne thing that a lot of people don’t talk about is how eclectic My Chem’s influences are, which is a large part of what made them such good songwriters. They were obviously heavily inspired by what was going on in their backyard in Jersey, as the fingerprints of Saves the Day’s fizzy, feisty pop-punk and the romantically macabre post-hardcore of Thursday are all over their early material. In fact, it was the friendship and faith of Thursday frontman Geoff Rickly that gave My Chem the early push that they needed; he produced their debut record, after all, and his co-sign gave the nascent band some much-needed credibility in the competitive and insular New Jersey punk scene.\n\nHowever, the bedrock of My Chem’s sound is a lot more varied than they often get credit for: one of their biggest influences was Philadelphian vampire-noisemakers Ink & Dagger, who made angular, synth-infused hardcore that’s hard to categorize; outside of traditional goth influences like the Cure, Bauhaus, and Siouxsie & the Banshees, they were huge fans of the Smiths and Morrissey, going so far as to cover Morrissey’s “Jack the Ripper” at early shows; there is the token influence of classic hardcore bands like the baritone horror-punk of the Misfits, the tortured, jazz-inflected chaos of Black Flag, and the strident, straightforward fury of Minor Threat; Gerard in particular was inspired by the layered, evolving melodies of 90s Britpop like Pulp and Blur; the band members taught themselves to scream by listening to the melodic death metal of At the Gates; Ray Toro took a lot from the NWOBHM, especially Iron Maiden; the majestic, classical-influenced rock of Queen and the timeless harmonies of the Beatles were seminal parts of their sound; and of course, the proto-punk and glam rock of David Bowie, T. Rex, and the Stooges permeates through much of their material and persona, and is what eventually won them the respect of mainstream music critics.\n\nTheir music had lots of non-sonic influences as well, like the pulpy comic books and cheesy horror B-movies that the band pulled a lot of its aesthetic and lyrical cues from. Altogether, My Chem truly didn’t sound like any other band in their scene, and that is what made people sit up and take notice of them. One of those people was a sickly, tiny boy named Frank Iero who, at the time, was singing and playing guitar in the post-hardcore/pop-punk/Holden Caulfield hybrid Pencey Prep, as well as the more experimental side-project I Am A Graveyard; he was also a touring guitarist for one of the greatest hardcore bands of all time, American Nightmare (who were going by the name Give Up the Ghost at the time for legal reasons). Frank had a diverse set of influences all his own, from the throat-shredding, artsy hardcore of Converge to the punchy and melodic emocore of Lifetime, and adding him to the band during the recording process of their debut was the final piece of the puzzle. He only played on two songs (opener “Honey, This Mirror Isn’t Big Enough for the Two of Us” and “Early Sunsets Over Monroeville”), but he added so much immediate weight to the band and would soon be an inextricable element of their sound and live shows.\n\nI Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love isn’t the most fully-formed My Chem album, but it is my favorite, not only because it’s the first one that I heard, but also because I love the way the band sounds when all their influences are so close to coming together: the song structures are just a little more ragged; the performances a little bit more energetic and desperate to prove themselves; the hooks just a smidge more subtle. Of course, subtlety doesn’t preclude melodrama– after the unnerving classical guitar in the intro track, “Romance,” we’re treated to the melodeath-derived riff that opens “Honey, This Mirror Isn’t Big Enough for the Two of Us” and we get Gerard’s over-the-top, near-cheesy scream of “The amount of pills I’m taking/counteracts the booze I’m drinking.” What a way to announce themselves to the world.\n\nGerard’s vocals are really the crux of My Chem’s sound. They’re extremely emotionally expressive, and they’re also malleable, making for an ability to work well with lots of varied material. However, his commitment to and passion for the material is a bit of a double-edged sword. For some people, like me, his unhinged, unguarded, and completely vulnerable performance melds perfectly with his charisma and I find his vocals to be one of the most charming aspects of their sound. For others, his near-histrionics are just too much, and they’re everything they hate about that mainstream era of emo. Fair enough, but those people are missing out, especially on the sprawling epic “Vampires Will Never Hurt You,” which rises and falls in tension until it bubbles over in an extended, nearly two-minute climax that causes the song to practically cave in on itself.\n\nElsewhere, songs like “Drowning Lessons” show what a goth Saves the Day might have sounded like, with some of the most nuanced and infectious guitar work of Ray Toro’s career– the harmonics that hover over the breakdown at the end are so interesting, and I could listen to those 40 seconds on a loop. Meanwhile, “Our Lady of Sorrows” is a breakneck fan-favorite (aside from their traditional performance of “Vampires Will Never Hurt You,” it’s the only song from this album that they played at their final show), filled with memorable moments like the two-step chorus, the ultra-melodic bridge, the “take my fucking hand” refrain, and the hair-raising scream that closes the track. “Our Lady of Sorrows” also provided me with one of my many message-board aliases back in the day (PatronSaintofSwitchbladeFights, in case you’re wondering).\n\nBefore we go any further, I do want to take a moment to talk about “Headfirst for Halos,” which is my favorite My Chemical Romance song. It’s the first song of theirs to betray their Queen influence in the towering, achingly melodic intro, and the concept of the song, musically, was “thrash Beatles,” which they pulled off exceptionally well. However, even aside from the intoxicating music, the lyrics on this song are what have stuck with me for all these years and kept me coming back to it. I didn’t understand what “the red ones make me fly and the blue ones help me fall” really meant at the time (I was straight-edge in 2007 and wouldn’t have real contact with addiction until a few years later), but “I think I’ll blow my brains against the ceiling” was a line that immediately grabbed me. I knew what that felt like for sure. For years, whenever I was in one of my lowest places, I could put this song and hear someone else articulate how it feels to be that miserable. “Think happy thoughts,” indeed.\n\n“Skylines & Turnstiles” is an interesting track, mainly because of how obvious it is that it’s their first song– the Thursday influence is palpable, the juxtaposition between the singing and screaming is just a bit more amateurish than the rest of the album, and they didn’t quite know how to end the damn thing– but also because it’s one of the most mournful, elegaic, and genuine sets of lyrics to be penned in the aftermath of 9/11. Lots of punk bands were willing to sing about the event’s political implications, but few were plaintive enough to simply ask someone to “tell me where we go from here.” Plus, it’s here that the precision and weight of Otter’s drumming becomes most strongly apparent– his fills are extremely agile and nimble. Meanwhile, for being the newest musician of the bunch, Mikey nails his bass lines. They’re simple yet catchy (and he was the only member to nail them all in one take!).\n\nThe home stretch of Bullets is where things begin to get a little more fragmented and experimental. For some people, this is where the album becomes unlistenable, but I adore it– “Early Sunsets Over Monroeville” is a song about the emotional conflict of having to shoot a loved one during a zombie apocalypse, but Gerard pitches his performance perfectly, selling the pain of the situation with authenticity despite suffering from a muffled vocal mix (he had just had surgery for a horrible toothache that made him punch his own head from the pain, which is why he sounds so garbled). Musically, this is the closest My Chem ever got to Midwest emo, full of twinkly guitars, but it builds to such an overwhelming climax, reserved yet intense, that it transcends emo.\n\n“This Is the Best Day Ever” is, correlatively, the closest they ever got to screamo, a fast-paced and short banger of a song that never lets up and also includes a nice gang vocal (which Geoff Rickly cameos in!). It’s a nice breather after the suffocating misery of “Monroeville,” and the more conventional “Cubicles” is a suitable follow-up. It’s the one song of theirs that blatantly addresses the misery of late capitalism and its subsequent alienation, but it’s also extremely catchy. It’s not my personal favorite on the record, but enough people have brought it up to me that I find myself viewing it in a much warmer light than I did previously. It’s lyrically one of the darkest moments on the record, but the dissonance in the sprightly instrumentation makes it addictive.\n\nAnd of course, we have to talk about the six-minute closer, “Demolition Lovers.” Conceptually, it’s the one track from the album that undeniably ties into their next record (the couple in the song who dies in a gunfight after an armed robbery are the protagonists of Three Cheers), but musically, it’s a piece-de-resistance, betraying the band’s more epic ambitions and sliding through multiple music movements with ease and confidence. It’s also home to one of Ray’s most reserved-yet-epic solos, the centerpiece of the song being a heart-rending instrumental performance that boils over into an emotionally exhausting vocal performance in the climax.\n\nI understand the argument that Bullets isn’t as coherent and complex as their later efforts, but this album means the world to me and every time I sit down to listen to it in full I feel completely satisfied. It doesn’t have the concise pop songwriting skills of Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge nor the high-minded conceptuality or classic-rock pretensions of The Black Parade, but it makes up for that with a scrappy, endearing aesthetic and an unflinching penchant for picking at the most upsetting scabs on the body of depression, mixing its unpleasant findings with just enough B-movie goofiness to make for an exhilarating ride into the psyche of five damaged New Jersey hardcore kids with coke and pop habits. Plus, it’s got some of their most nuanced, subtle, yet completely over-the-top songwriting. What happens when you combine obviously talented kids who just don’t quite know how to write songs yet with the resources to record a full-length album (presided over by one of their closest friends and musical idols)? You get an over-eager, endlessly fun, addictive, and fascinating listening experience. If you’ve somehow missed out on Bullets, give it a chance– even if you’re a holier-than-thou “Orchid is the only real emo band” type, it might just sucker you in and win you over. I’ve witnessed it myself many a time (hi, Eleanor!). Bullets might not be their masterpiece, but it’s my favorite.\n\nGIVE ‘EM HELL, KID\n\nOf course, despite my love of their debut, I have to acknowledge that thematically, their later records give me a lot more to chew on. Gerard’s worsening addictions to alcohol, pills, and cocaine notwithstanding, the Way family experienced a huge blow with the loss of Gerard and Mikey’s grandmother, Elena, who was an avid supporter of the band and went to many of their early shows. Her death inspired the potent “Helena (So Long & Goodnight),” of course, but it also symbolizes the disconnect that Gerard was experiencing with reality. I can’t speak definitively, but I speculate that it was easier for him to turn his grandmother’s death into a comic-booky storyline that fit into the narrative that he was crafting for Three Cheers, because at the time, he was a mess of a person, deepening his toxic relationships with substances along with his one-time-best-friend Bert McCracken of the Used. This was an extremely dark time for the band, despite their excellent performances on PureVolume and the riotous responses they were receiving on tour volleying them into a major label contract with Reprise Records, and it’s that morbid and miserable place that provided them with the emotions necessary to craft a gothic pop-punk masterpiece.\n\nEverything on Three Cheers is raw. Arguably, the punchy and dry production on Bullets was lower-fi, but the production on Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge is extremely unpolished, often pushing into the red and distorting as it gets louder (see the chorus on “The Jetset Life Is Gonna Kill You”). Meanwhile, the instrumental performances became much rowdier and more hectic (not at the expense of musicianship: the guitar dynamic between Ray and Frank became increasingly complex and intricate, while Mikey’s bass became much more integral to the band’s sound, providing hooks-a-plenty in moments like the intro to “Give ‘Em Hell, Kid”) and Gerard pushed his vocals to the point of collapse, often sounding like he was going to throw up from the intensity. Three Cheers may have been popular, but it wasn’t that accessible, and it also isn’t a far cry from the introspective, melodic hardcore and desperate, ragged vocal approach of emo’s founders, Rites of Spring. There’s octave chords and screams a-plenty on this album, they’re just more refined and well-structured than a lot of the other bands that came before them.\n\nThat, in addition to the band’s stellar image and aesthetic (playing every show in undertaker’s suits that got more gross, sweaty, and covered in fake blood as time went on) immediately endeared them to millions who wanted something just a little darker and edgier than the likes of Jimmy Eat World, and just a little more polished and propulsive than the likes of the Used. The breakthrough success of fellow goth kids AFI with 2003’s Sing the Sorrow probably paved the way, too, but My Chem were decidedly more untethered and energetic– they had true charisma and rock-star quality to them, more than any of their peers, and that made them magnetic. It helped that the core members of the band all had something to offer from an image perspective– Gerard’s upturned, pixie-like nose and adorable, sharp features made his violent vocal eruptions even more shocking, Ray Toro’s afro was extremely hard to look away from, Mikey’s small, waif-like, bespectacled appearance made him a twink ingenue, and Frank’s tiny stature and heavily tattooed frame made him the pretty-yet-approachable bad boy. Any high schooler would be head over heels for these guys.\n\nOf course, their over-emoting and their use of makeup made them the most immediate punching bag for the type of people who never understood emo’s mainstream breakthrough. It’s really with Three Cheers pushing them into the national conversation that diehard rock and metal fans grew to greatly dislike My Chem; Gerard’s heart-on-sleeve theatrics just made zero sense to them, after a decade of macho posturing by nu-metal and alt-rock bands, and even their metallic streak (seriously, the opening riff of “Thanks for the Venom” has Iron Maiden written all over it) wasn’t enough for people who prized technicality and proficiency above all else. Meanwhile, their older fans– many of whom Andy Greenwald memorably described as “hardcore hulks who hid their copy of Bullets with their secret stash of Morrissey imports” in a 2005 cover story for Spin— turned on the band, their major-label affiliation and newfound radio play (the stellar, Jimmy Eat World-meets-Queen pop classic “I’m Not Okay (I Promise)” lit up the airwaves almost instantly, while its high school-set, tongue-in-cheek, Wes Anderson-esque video made the rounds constantly on MTV2 and Fuse) meant that they were disgusting sellouts no longer worth their time. The ire set upon their new fans– often young girls who shopped at Hot Topic and were playing with their self-loathing and low self-esteem through goth fashion and self-harm– was considerable, as was the homophobia heaped upon the band due to their penchant for face-paint and gaudy red eye shadow.\n\nLuckily, the band welcomed its detractors– as the chorus of “Thanks for the Venom” evokes their hatred in addition to Gerard’s many addictions– because they fed off the negativity, and so did their fans. In embracing the darkest pits of despair (or at least, the darkest that a band could go and still remain mainstream), My Chem provided hopeless, mentally ill teenagers everywhere with rallying cries and, more than anything, a spokesperson who understood them. Gerard was known for telling fans during shows that if they were suffering from depression or suicidal impulses to get help, and in the process became much more than the wallowing stereotype of emo kids who were in love with their pain. Many years later, Gerard would come out as non-binary (he/they pronouns), and his early embrace of homoerotic imagery in his songs (pretty much the entirety of “You Know What They Do to Guys Like Us In Prison,” for example) provided lots of LGBT and questioning youth the validation that they so desperately needed.\n\nOf course, many of the issues that I brought up with Fall Out Boy’s fandom persisted in just as much, if not higher, frequency in My Chem’s– glorification of mental illness and self-harm, exploitation of gayness for the salacious pleasure of women who see gay men as spectacle, general grossness– but My Chem stood strong with their songs and with their fans, becoming a makeup-smudged oasis amid the pressures of everyday adolescent life.\n\nIt helped that Three Cheers was the tightest, most concise set of songs the band has ever put together, with some of their most inventive ideas on full display. The bizarre guitar effect in the intro of “Helena” coupled with the watery, buried vocals in the bridge was just the tip of the iceberg in a song that could have been a weepy power ballad sped up past breaking point. The choruses on this record, admittedly much moreso than Bullets, are absolutely indelible, while the songs as a whole are stacked with hooks, grabbing the listener by the neck and reeling them in whenever they start to feel bored. Even the weakest track, “The Jetset Life Is Gonna Kill You,” is saved by a massive bridge that uses AutoTune to satirical, slightly unhinged effect, and songs like the vaudeville-to-screamy-barn-burner “You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison” and the massive, chaotic “Hang ‘Em High” stand as the most breathless and exciting tunes the band has ever committed to tape. Other moments, like the way that Gerard’s wailing contrasts with the hypnotic guitar solo on the Glassjaw-esque “The Ghost of You” or the heart-pounding key change in the final chorus of the serene, bubbly showstopper “Cemetery Drive,” show the band’s grasp of dynamics at their height.\n\nThe way the album is paced makes almost every track feel like a standout, from the “whoa-oh” bridge of “To the End” to the weepy, impassioned climax of high-water-mark “It’s Not A Fashion Statement, It’s A Death Wish.” There’s barely any moments that don’t bleed with energy and passion, and guest appearances like Bert McCracken’s screaming in “You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison” and Keith Morris of the Circle Jerks’ buried yawps at the end of “Hang ‘Em High” pick up the slack when the band starts to falter (which they never really do). And of course, it closes with yet another mind-melting display of flawless song structure with “I Never Told You What I Do for a Living,” a song that turns its final two minutes into an endless bridge, chock full of tight performances, thrilling melodic turns, and the most heartfelt, singing-to-the-point-of-choking vocal performance from Gerard on the album.\n\nOut of My Chem’s golden period, Three Cheers is the album with the least emotional attachment for me, but it’s still an incredible work of songwriting, and on a sheer musical level, I might argue that it’s My Chemical Romance’s best album. Its half-baked concept (a man must take 1,000 souls from evil men in order to bring back his girlfriend from the dead, or something) doesn’t detract from the adrenaline rush of its best musical moments– the rousing chorus of “Hang ‘Em High,” the piano-induced lyrical fakeout at the end of “I’m Not Okay,” the fist-pumping guitar solo in “Thank You for the Venom”– because structurally and performatively, the band is firing on all cylinders. The weakest moment on the whole album is the cheesy way that Gerard adopts a vague Latino affect in his voice when he says “Hotel Bella Muerte” in “The Jetset Life Is Gonna Kill You,” and I think that’s a pretty impressive achievement. If there’s one track that’s superfluous, it might be the Radiohead-influenced “Interlude,” but it works so well as a dividing line between the “acts” of the album that it’s hard to argue against its placement. Three Cheers is a masterpiece of the emo-pop era, and no amount of hand-wringing from the old guard nor the snide dismissal of the cooler-than-thou set can ever take that away from them.\n\nNowhere is this clearer than on the live album, Life On the Murder Scene. Gerard’s complete and total ownership of the crowd (and his excellent vocals– he does a pretty good approximation of Bert’s unbelievable performance on “You Know What They Do…”) blends perfectly with every other member’s strengths– Mikey’s staid consistency, Otter’s perfect control of tone and atmosphere, and Ray’s loyal backing vocals and flawless (matching the album nearly note-for-note) guitar chops. For Frank’s part, he gives the whole affair a punky, weighty, hardcore energy– listen to the way the guitar chugs during the bridge of “Cemetery Drive,” or the way that gang vocals give way to audience participation in “I Never Told You What I Do for a Living” (not to mention the handclaps in “Headfirst for Halos”) and you can practically smell Geoff Rickly’s basement. More than any other band, My Chem was the one that brought the spirit of underground emo and hardcore to the mainstream, for better or for worse.\n\nLife On the Murder Scene also includes two of the best unreleased tracks in My Chemical Romance’s ouvre, “Bury Me In Black” and “Desert Song.” You can hear the roots of “Thank You for the Venom”‘s main riff in the intro of “Bury Me In Black,” but the whole song bleeds a sort of desperate, uncontrollable atmosphere, from the Gerard’s short-of-breath screams throughout to the Slayer-rip-off breakdown (just a double-bass part away from sounding exactly like an outtake from Satisfaction Is the Death of Desire). “Desert Song” is an acoustic song (albeit with some Oasis-esque electric overtones in the right channel) which features one of the most depressive and gutsy performances from Gerard– in any other band’s hands, it would be unspeakably cheesy, but here it’s absolutely heartbreaking. Alcohol-soaked miscreants they may have been, but My Chem justifiably ruled the world from 2004-2008, and Life On the Murder Scene is a pretty good document for making that point.\n\nStill, what’s a band to do after their breakthrough? Successful major-label debuts are notoriously hard to come by, and harder still to follow up. My Chem had a few choices: they could flame out in a drug-and-alcohol-fueled blaze (which Gerard seemed to be heading towards); they could double down on the sound they’d found with Three Cheers and keep releasing bland rewrites of the same song; or they could clamp down, get their shit together, embrace some of their more traditional rock influences, and create something that was both exquisitely new and hearkened back to the old days of rock. They picked the latter.\n\nTHE BLACK PARADE IS DEAD\n\nAfter barely being talked out of suicide in 2005 (immediately following an eightball and heavy drinking), Gerard got clean and sober and has mostly remained so for the entirety of his career since. The rest of the band, some of whom had almost been driven to quit (Frank Iero has said as much about that time period), rallied together and tried to create an album that could live up to monolithic expectations created by the success of Three Cheers.\n\nMy Chem are relentless perfectionists; listening to Living with Ghosts (the collection of Black Parade demos released on its 10th anniversary), it’s clear that the process of writing The Black Parade was extremely long and arduous, and you can hear bits and pieces of ideas that would be used elsewhere all over the place. “The Five of Us Are Dying” is a prehistoric version of “Welcome to the Black Parade” with almost completely different lyrics and a vastly truncated structure, while the original version of “House of Wolves” is almost completely unrecognizable when compared to what ended up on the album. Other songs, like “Emily,” “Party at the End of the World,” “My Way Home Is Through You,” and “All the Angels” got left on the cutting room floor almost entirely. There were some tracks from this period of the band that probably would have made for welcome additions to The Black Parade (“Kill All Your Friends,” with some tweaking, could have been an all-time My Chem song, while the live performance of “Somebody Out There Loves You” from this period shows what a post-The Black Parade My Chem might have sounded like if they didn’t reinvent themselves). Still other songs, like “Mama” and “Disenchanted,” were already almost fully formed, but the process of putting them back together in the studio clearly enhanced their arrangement and performance greatly.\n\nAll of this work just goes to show that The Black Parade was no accident, either in its musical accomplishments or its massive success. This album’s creation was extremely meticulous, and I have a somewhat conflicted relationship to it; on the one hand, it’s very hard to deny it’s a modern rock classic, and its story (about a cancer patient reflecting on his failings, going through the afterlife, and eventually getting another chance to redeem himself) is something that gained much greater resonance for me early this year, after I spent nine days in the hospital thinking I might die. But on the other hand, while I don’t begrudge the band itself for being calculating nor for indulging their classic rock influences, I do begrudge the music press for finally acknowledging their talent only after they decide to bring back dinosaur rock sounds and aesthetics. It’s exactly why critics fell for the theatrics (and ultimately empty politics and massaged, flat sound) of Green Day’s American Idiot; bands that Hot Topic kids enjoy are only acceptable for “adults” to like once they engage in already-established rock buffoonery. It’s not My Chem’s fault that The Black Parade canonized them, but I find myself bitter at the establishment for doing so anyway.\n\nAs for The Black Parade itself, well, it’s a near-unimpeachable record, a collection of painstakingly interwoven songs and themes that draws from post-hardcore roots, classic rock aesthetics and song structures, and unstoppably massive pop hooks to create a completely engrossing listening experience. Even newer, more “credible” bands, like New York’s rising emo-indie-pop-punk darlings Prince Daddy & the Hyena, are openly indebted to it (their newest record, the Wizard of Oz-esque concept album Cosmic Thrill Seekers, boasts influences from The Black Parade, while the band itself covered the album in full for one performance). Meanwhile, the smash success of the album continues to this day, as streaming numbers for it are still off the charts and many young people discovering it are convinced that it’s the pinnacle of emo. There’s some reservations to be had about that tag being applied to The Black Parade for sure (it’s an incredible record, but their prior material draws much more from the classical “emo” well), not least because My Chem could now no longer be any further from the DIY ideals of what “emo” originally meant, but it’s hard for me to deny that The Black Parade is, in essence, the peak of many young people’s emotional attachment to any music, and represents that intrinsic bond between performer and audience that I think emo is all about. And anyway, The Black Parade smokes.\n\nI’m actually not a huge fan of the production– I think it’s a little compressed and messy– but there’s so much going on that it’s hard to argue for a more spartan mix, anyhow. The guitar work is indescribably good– interlocking, circuitous vortexes of pop, post-hardcore, and dinosaur rock melting together and wrestling around with each other, creating some truly fantastic sonic textures throughout. Otter has left for spurious reasons, so Bob Bryar, former soundman for the Used, is manning the kit, and his playing is, for lack of a better term, more “rock” and less “punk” than Otter’s speedy-but-light drumming style. Bryar’s drumming is a lot heavier and harder-hitting, somewhat reminiscent of Dave Grohl’s work in Nirvana, giving The Black Parade‘s tones a somewhat more monolithic quality (though he still knows how to ease up on the album’s softer tracks). I don’t think Bryar does the Bullets material the same sort of snotty justice that Otter did, but I don’t think Otter could have pulled off the marching-band vibe nor the massive fill before the first proper verse in “Welcome to the Black Parade,” either.\n\nThe Ways have simply rocketed to another level of performance with The Black Parade— Mikey has developed into a solid utility player, but when he is given moments to shine, like the bridge of “The Sharpest Lives,” he shows a complete and total mastery of tone and melody on bass that proves he isn’t just there to provide the low end. Meanwhile, Gerard is an animal on this record– no longer just working with pure passion, he has evolved into a gifted and rubbery singer, mining his upper register for some of the most expressive and forceful vocal work in the genre to that point.\n\nThe change in purpose between Three Cheers and Parade is immediately noticeable when you press play; “The End” begins with ambient sound effects, acoustic guitar, and a lush piano performance in the background, while Gerard has never sounded more like a preacher speaking to his enraptured followers (when he says “nothing at all” at the end of the second verse, he actually kind of sounds like he’s having a stroke). The melody is uniquely dirgey and funereal, but doesn’t dwell in it for long before launching into the uptempo boogie “Dead!”, which is one of my personal favorite My Chem songs– an excellent solo from Ray Toro aside, the bridge and climax of the song is pure, unadulterated My Chemical Romance, cinematic and communal and intimate all at once, and the inclusions of strings, horns, and piano are shockingly welcome.\n\nThe rest of the album cycles through more straightforwardly post-hardcore-indebted tunes and songs that play with classic rock tropes and conventions. “This Is How I Disappear” boasts a monstrous, menacing bridge section, while “The Sharpest Lives” (another song about Gerard’s tumultuous relationship with Bert McCracken) stocks up on nifty vocal and guitar effects to sculpt a thick soundscape. Both songs are stacked with knockout, stadium-ready choruses– watching the band perform them live in a massive Mexico City amphitheater on the Black Parade Is Dead! DVD feels like you’re seeing the songs be played the way they were always meant. Meanwhile, other tracks play exactly the role you expect them to play in rock operas; the piano-driven ballad “Cancer” functions as the emotional and structural centerpiece and lynchpin of the record, for example (and it’s a beautiful song, as long as you focus on the soppy strings and ignore some of the more obvious AutoTune). Other tracks are more blatant about copying classic rock artists– the end of the solo in “I Don’t Love You” cops the solo from “We Are the Champions,” for example, while the pre-chorus of the rollicking standout “House of Wolves” nakedly rips off KISS’s “Detroit Rock City”– but all those tricks up their sleeves are merely ancillary to the magnum opus of the record and the most definitive moment of My Chemical Romance’s career, “Welcome to the Black Parade.”\n\n“Parade” is a perfect song– its five-minute run time slides by in mere moments, while its symphonically-derived structure throws everything at the wall, and it all sticks. From the melancholic-yet-triumphant piano intro to its punky main body and its ascendant, downright beautiful climax, the song is a three-part paean to both rock music of the past and the moment that My Chem were occupying. They were the center of attention in mainstream rock during this record cycle, and this song shows that they were more than deserving of that honor. It’s by now cliche to observe that “Welcome to the Black Parade” is the “emo generation”‘s “Bohemian Rhapsody,” but I’ll be damned if it isn’t an accurate observation; no song of the era comes close to matching its anthemic qualities nor its near-universal appeal.\n\nI’ve seen criticisms that The Black Parade doesn’t know when to stop putting its foot on the gas, but I’m inclined to disagree. There’s not one but three weepy ballads on this record, all of which slow down the energy of the record without sacrificing their strength or infectious qualities. “I Don’t Love You” is a borderline-hateful anti-love song, but Gerard’s vocal performance and the lush, sticky instrumentation make it sound completely genuine. I’ve covered “Cancer” already, but the penultimate track “Disenchanted” is an often-underrated cut from The Black Parade; I myself used to have some reservations about it, but after my aforementioned hospital stay I found myself embracing its regretful-yet-empowering energy more than anything else on the record. Plus, it’s got a solid, offhanded sex joke– the song describes the speaker’s life as a movie and says that it “started with an alright scene.”\n\n“House of Wolves” would have probably been the most straightforwardly “rock ‘n’ roll” track on the record (and it is an excellent song), but the bluesy chord progression of late-album standout “Teenagers” just barely tops it, with some jaunty piano adding to the atmosphere and Gerard’s lyrics about a school shooter terrified of his own generation speaking to a subset of disaffected, angry teenagers who otherwise might not have found a constructive or harmless outlet for their aggression.\n\nAnd lest you assume that The Black Parade has completely abandoned My Chem’s heavier inclinations for classic rock pretensions, the one-two punch of the unremittingly hard-hitting bangers “Mama” and “Sleep” puts that assumption to rest. “Mama” is a weird-as-fuck number, with a mandolin-inspired guitar intro and despairing lyrics about a war criminal reckoning with his horrible actions immediately putting the listener in discomfort, but it progresses into the best song of the album: a mean, off-kilter, disorienting bridge with woozy guitar work; a brief and memorable guest appearance from Liza Minelli; an apocalyptic shanty-like outro; what more could you want? “Sleep” is more straightforwardly hard rock, but the earth-shattering drum intro and its overwhelming, scream-infused climax make up for its structural simplicity while it boasts by far the most bleak and angry lyrics on the whole record.\n\nSo what’s keeping The Black Parade from being My Chemical Romance’s stab at perfection? That’d be the closer, “Famous Last Words,” which absolutely wastes an incredible riff from Ray Toro in favor of an unfittingly uplifting lyrical showing and a weak central structure. I mean, come on– “I am not afraid to keep on living”? I don’t doubt that this song means a lot to the kids who needed (and continue to need) it, but I can’t forgive the way that this song just goes nowhere and peters out at the end, especially after the purposeful and epic tone of the rest of the record leading up to it. I will say that the live performance of it on The Black Parade Is Dead redeems the song somewhat; it sounds much more powerful and deliberate in a live setting, rather than lumbering and heavy-handed (it’s also worth watching just to see James DeWees of Reggie & the Full Effect/formerly of the Get-Up Kids have an absolute blast playing keyboards for a band at the height of their mainstream moment). At least the hidden track, the morbidly funny “Blood,” provides some levity to such a thematically dark and heavy record.\n\nThe Black Parade marked a huge sea change for My Chemical Romance; the haters either came around to them, as in the case of music journalists, or just ignored them and accepted them as an inescapable part of the pop landscape, as in the case of the everyday neanderthals who shook their heads at the band’s success.\n\nIt also marked a shift in My Chemical Romance’s attitude to their own music– there was a relatively massive four-year gap between this record and their follow up (and we will get to that in due time), wherein the members focused on touring the record and devoting more time to their friends and families. The most notable musical export from this time of the band is Frank Iero’s hardcore band, Leathermouth, which released the bristly and bilious XO in 2009 to warm commercial and critical response and a less-than-enthusiastic response from the US government (who would have thought they wouldn’t be a fan of song titles like “I’m Going to Kill the President of the United States”?). The most notable non-music export was Gerard Way’s comic book series, The Umbrella Academy, a Doom Patrol-meets-A-Series-of-Unfortunate-Events outing that garnered a pretty large cult following and, I gather, a movie? Or something? I think something big happened with it recently, but I can’t find anything about it online.\n\nStill, it would be extremely hard to try and top the theatricality of The Black Parade‘s concept and tour performances, which featured Gerard Way being brought out on a stretcher as The Patient and the band playing the record in its entirety. Why would they even bother? It would just to lead to catastrophe.\n\nDESTROYA\n\nWell, try they did. Much in the same way as the band created an alter ego, the Black Parade, for their previous album, they created the Killjoys for 2010’s Danger Days, a group of post-apocalyptic freedom fighters who apparently love extremely boring rock music. The concept of Danger Days and its associated extended universe makes literally zero sense to me, but aside from that, the album is a horrible mess, full of downright deliberately annoying choruses (“Na Na Na [Na Na Na Na Na Na Na Na]”), weepy-even-by-My-Chem-standards ballads (“Summertime”), and ill-advised dabbling with misguided and ugly hard rock (“Destroya”). Elsewhere, there’s boring, go-nowhere songs completely void of ideas like “Bulletproof Heart” and “Sing,” and even worse, dance songs that completely forgo catchiness, like “Planetary (Go!)”. The whole record is embarrassing, but not as embarrassing as the legion of kids who somehow try to claim that it’s either better than it’s given credit for or, bafflingly, some kind of misunderstood masterpiece. I’ve seen claims that it belongs somewhere in the sass lineage, which is both confusing and offensive to me personally as a defender of all things sass. The only redeemable song on the album for me is the bitingly funny closer “Vampire Money,” a savage kiss-off that fits nowhere into the ham-fisted narrative of the record and mostly functions as a fuck-you to the band being asked to contribute a song for the Twilight movies (not that there’s anything wrong with that, right, Paramore?).\n\nIf that had been the last we’d heard of My Chemical Romance, it would have been sad, but I would have understood. The thing that was vastly more frustrating was, immediately prior to the band’s breakup, a series of five singles that comprised the record they almost made before scrapping it and making Danger Days from scratch, known as Conventional Weapons. These songs are not just really good, they make me wish that that had been the record we’d gotten instead, and furthermore, they make me really angry that My Chem broke up before fulfilling the promise that these songs so obviously showed.\n\nFor almost any doubters of My Chemical Romance, I often point to the first track released from these sessions, the extremely energetic “Boy Division,” which feels almost exactly like a Three Cheers era My Chem track, but with a bouncy, destructive breakdown near the end. All ten of these songs are worth hearing, but it’s “Boy Division” and the late-era standout “Make Room!!” that are most worth your time. Elsewhere, you’ve got the James Bond-esque groove of “Tomorrow’s Money” and the restless-yet-relaxed “Ambulance” and “Gun.” proving that My Chem could have made yet another timeless record had they had the time. The slow-burning “The World Is Ugly” and the string-driven epic “The Light Behind Your Eyes” evoke their traditional goth influences, “Kiss the Ring” is the unstoppable rocker that Green Day wish they could have been writing in 2009, and “Surrender the Night” and “Burn Bright” are both garage-y bangers that presage the direction Danger Days could have gone had they not succumbed to their impulses to top The Black Parade‘s conceptual strength and tightness. My Chemical Romance: a story of unfulfilled potential, sadly enough.\n\nFAKE YOUR DEATH\n\nAnd yet, while My Chemical Romance broke up in 2013, signifying the death of their incarnation of emo in the mainstream, they were not forgotten– they live on, both in the past members’ solo projects and the mark they made on the lost generation of millennials who called their music home.\n\nI’ve written before at length how 2013 was a major year for mainstream “emo,” not just because My Chemical Romance broke up, but because an entirely new type of emo-that-wasn’t-emo started cropping up. It could be the vacuous posturing of Twenty One Pilots, or it could be the restless DIY output of truly emo- and hardcore-influenced rappers like Bones, but just because rock music was no longer the zeitgeist didn’t mean that the emotions that made My Chemical Romance megastars went away overnight. As I said in my article on Lil Peep, the music might change, but teenagers don’t. And as the former members of My Chem continue on their path to elder statesmen of the scene– whether it be the Bright Eyes-esque rag of Frank Iero’s series of solo albums, Ray Toro’s airy, Smashing Pumpkins-influenced alt rock, or Gerard Way’s haunting and effervescently catchy post-punk– it’s never been more clear that My Chemical Romance were not a flash in the pan, latching onto a moment in youth culture that only lasted as long as there was money to be made.\n\nSay what you will about My Chem’s authenticity– their major-label work was for the most part excellent, but their indie work proved that they had the talent and work ethic to make it from the get-go– but they were pillars of a movement, one that was started in the 80s by the underground hardcore scene and one that was fostered throughout the 90s and 2000s by acts as disparate as Jawbreaker, Every Time I Die, American Nightmare, and Fall Out Boy. My Chemical Romance was not just the commercial high-water mark of that movement, they were an artistic and social high-water mark as well; for every kid in America who has been depressed, bullied, or just plain miserable at some point in their lives, My Chemical Romance might have been the band that helped them get through some truly hard times, or ushered them into a more DIY and personal scene that helped give them purpose. My Chem were never a band that made it seem cool to be miserable, at least not to anyone who was actually paying attention. They made it cool to try and fight your way through that misery.\n\nTo ask if I am embarrassed of being a fan of My Chemical Romance, a band that has meant so much to me and millions of other people, a band that made near-objectively fantastic music for most of its run, a band that provided an open door from the endless drudgery of everyday life to the freedom of DIY, punk, emo, hardcore, and making your life what you want it to be, is to insult everything that I stand for. My Chemical Romance might have been a band that you weren’t supposed to like, but I always hated being told what to do, and I resent even further being told what to think, enjoy, or listen to.\n\nFrom Las Vegas theatre kids making baroque dance-pop to straight-edge Chicago softcore to gross pop to existential pop-punk to riotous post-pop-punk to Christian metalcore to white-belted scenecore to gothic pop-hardcore to DIY Soundcloud emo rap to My Chemical Romance, everything I’ve touched on in this series is part of me, and hopefully, if you’ve followed along for everything I’ve done so far, it’s part of you, too. Even if it isn’t, hopefully you understand why it’s part of me, what it means to me, and what it means to the people who are like me.\n\nI’ve been going to DIY hardcore shows for well over a decade now, and I’ve been involved in Internet forums about hardcore, skramz, emo, hip-hop, and what-have-you for even longer, and the one thing that’s never changed is that there’s always self-righteous dickheads who are quick to assert the superiority of who and what they enjoy at the expense of people who may have needed something else to get to the same place. At the end of the day, who we are as people is constantly changing, and I’m eternally grateful for all the pieces of the puzzle that helped make me who I am today, and I’m grateful for everything that will change me in the future.\n\nSo to all the kids who are like me, the kids who needed Fall Out Boy and My Chemical Romance in their lives no matter how deep they went down the rabbit hole of obscure 90s hardcore and emo, the kids who eventually developed addictions after breaking edge and had to white-knuckle it out with the help of friends, lovers, and cigarettes, the kids who needed to hear someone else say that it was okay and normal to feel like shit and think about killing yourself as long as you got some help, the kids who have never known what the fuck to make of their gender or their sexuality or their nightmarish anxiety, the kids who keep the lessons they learned close to their hearts, this article was for you, this series was for you, and everything I write, in some form or another, is for you, and it’s for me, too. I’m not nearly self-important and arrogant enough to think that people care about what I think, or that I’m making a difference, but I truly hope that, if you identify with anything I just said, you know you aren’t alone because I’m here, too. We’ll carry on.\n\n-XO, Ellie\n\nWANNA BE\n\n(a hasty foreword)\n\nThis one’s gonna be a little different. For one thing, Lil Peep was far too prolific for me to do my usual format– not counting his two studio albums, his five mixtapes, and his eleven EPs, he also released literally countless loosies and collabs, and there’s still probably untold unreleased material– and for another, he wasn’t a band, and this column will probably not be focused solely on him. A long time ago, when my writing was much more flippant and obnoxious, I called Lil Peep’s brand of music the closest thing we would get to a crabcore revival. I’d like to walk that back a little bit– Lil Peep wasn’t so much the reincarnation of Attack Attack as much as he was an update on what “emo” meant in the early-mid 00s (ie, the focus of this recurring column).\n\nTo me, the parallels are undeniable; here was a disaffected, deeply depressed teenager making extremely emotive music with an unshakeable DIY ethic, who eventually achieved fame that was ultimately detrimental to him. Lil Peep was objectively talented, an instantly charismatic presence with a knack for constructing indelible vocal melodies. The main difference between him and the kids who, a decade earlier, were forming pop-punk bands, is that he came of age in an era where hip-hop was the most accessible and immediate form of self-expression for the youth. Not only did the advent of simple-to-use and free music software make hip-hop more viable than pop-punk (which requires knowing a whole bunch of people who can play instruments and a studio to record in), but platforms like Soundcloud made it frankly easier to produce and distribute songs than ever before. For someone like Lil Peep, who absolutely wanted to be famous, it was a no-brainer to embrace hip-hop as a dominant musical style.\n\nAnd yet, his music wasn’t pure hip-hop. Not just because Lil Peep wasn’t really a rapper (he sang more than anything), but because the influence of emo and pop-punk was palpable in everything he did, from his producers’ extensive sampling of artists like Mineral and Death Cab for Cutie to the way that he constructed his vocal hooks. His voice, whiny and youthful, was just more suited to writing blink-182 or Taking Back Sunday-caliber choruses than the mumbly auto-tuned warbling of many of his peers. It’s not that one took more talent than the other, it’s that Peep was of two worlds and fusing them made the most sense to him.\n\nBorn Gustav Ahr in 1996, in the town of Allenstown, Pennsylvania, Peep’s early life was defined by his close relationship with his mother, an elementary school teacher, and his grandfather, a Marxist scholar (Peep’s father stopped being involved in his life when he was a teenager; it’s been implied by many that he was neglectful and/or abusive towards Peep). Despite both of Peep’s parents being Harvard graduates, neither was seemingly upset by Peep’s decision to drop out of high school and get his diploma online. In fact, the support of Peep’s mother was a driving force in his public persona– she gave him the name “Peep” when he was a child, after all, and his first tattoo, at age 14, was her birthday and initials, supposedly so she couldn’t be all that mad at him for getting them.\n\nPeep is often incorrectly characterized, after the fact, as “the voice of the Soundcloud generation.” I don’t think this is necessarily accurate– although his music appeals to people across all lines because of its innate catchiness and his almost inhuman likability, Peep himself was far from an avatar of his generation. Instead, I thought of him as the most representative member of a specific subset. Most of his peers were not getting face tattoos to commit to a life of playing music, and his generation is statistically less likely to be having sex and doing drugs. Instead, Peep was part of the most modern iteration of counterculture– he grew up in Long Island and was obsessed with punk music, after all, and self-identified as a loner who made most of his friends on the Internet.\n\nInspired by the intense work ethic and output rate of acidic DIY rapper Bones and his Seshollowaterboys collective, Peep moved out to LA to start his music career in earnest. He quickly hooked up with internet friend Craig Xen, who introduced him to JGRXXN and Ghostemane, all of whom were underground rappers infatuated with both edgy metal/hardcore aesthetics and the occult-influenced, dirty lo-fi sound of Three 6 Mafia’s earliest work. After establishing those relationships, Peep became the resident singer in their rap collective, Schemaposse. His career was on an immediate upward trajectory after that, with his first solo mixtape Lil Peep Part One garnering impressive play counts and spawning two of his earliest hits, “Star Shopping” (which was not originally on the mixtape, but is included on the official Soundcloud playlist) and “The Way I See Things.” The songs were good, of course– slight, wispy, yet memorable slices of pop-punk misery and ennui clawing their way out of a miasma of 808 beats and hazy, lo-fi guitar samples– but beyond that, why was Lil Peep’s music becoming such a phenomenon? And why would he attract such vitriol from the old guard and young kids trying to suck up to them?\n\nCRYBABY\n\n(kids these days)\n\nThere are a lot of audiences who have embraced Lil Peep since his music started to make the rounds in underground hip-hop forums in 2015, but the thing that binds them all, that makes them all part of Lil Peep’s tribe, is that he spoke to the general melancholy and anxiety that has always existed in teenagers and post-adolescents– it’s just that in today’s world, those feelings are magnified and reflected back at you by the 24/7 personal news cycle of social media, and Peep’s extremely blunt lyrics and earnest delivery fit that frame of mind perfectly, while the music itself is laid-back enough to remain broadly accessible (and never, in today’s parlance, “cringe”– a word that used to mean vicarious embarrassment but now refers to anything that seems too excited or genuine). The hooks are there: take one listen to “Kiss,” one of his breakthrough singles, and you’ll see that the dreamy, effervescent, instantly irresistible vocal hooks are there in spades.\n\nThat being said, a lot of Peep’s earlier material resonated with a certain type of person (and continues to resonate with that type of person)– extremely lonely (from mostly self-imposed isolation), prone to drug abuse (especially downers like Xanax and opiates), afflicted with depression, anxiety, apathy, vague anger. In times past, these were the kids who would be forming bands of their own, but now they’re making beats in their bedrooms, furthering their own sense of loneliness. If you don’t have to even leave your room to promote or make your music, why would you? When I listen to Lil Peep and think of his fans in the early days, I see people holed up in messy bedrooms, escaping the pressures of the outside world, but also all of its joys. Headphones on and engaged in endless Soundcloud bliss, playing video games and smoking weed until it’s time to go to sleep and start the whole thing over again, wishing for sex and intimacy but never quite approaching it– and if they do, it’s in the form of sloppy and manipulative app-assisted hookups or fleeting DMs from Twitter accounts that will never be attached to a physical presence.\n\nThe music of Peep and his peers also feels suffocatingly isolating–producers like Nedarb and smokeasac specialized in making beats that didn’t have to be lo-fi, but were by choice, often muffled and warped to make for an uncomfortable, watery, claustrophobic atmosphere. Peep’s vocals were multi-tracked and then pushed to the very middle of the mix, intelligible and serving as an island among the muck of the beats. Influenced by witch house and cloud rap, as well as the blown-out sound of other underground rap pioneers like Raider Klan, Lil Ugly Mane, and Awful Records, Peep’s songs could have often disappeared into the swirl of the other Soundcloud rappers who were trafficking in similar sounds, but two things set his music apart. For one, his producers often chose specifically obscure samples in order to show how those artists had influenced their artistic sensibilities as well as to give their beats a more concrete sonic identity. And then there’s Peep’s vocals and lyrics, which I’ve already spoken on, but it bears repeating how they elide exuberance and misery, how they’re both addictive and fleeting. Lil Peep songs are best listened to, not on repeat, but in an endless playlist, alternating between him, his peers, and his influences. They’re mood-setting, at once insular and expansive, mirroring the effects of his drugs of choice all at once: the communality of ecstasy; the closed-off darkness of opiates; the drowsiness of Xanax; the easy confidence of cocaine.\n\nThere were also his music videos, often shot on grainy, deliberately degraded VHS tape– quick-edited shots of him messing around in the streets and in dilapidated Skid Row apartments, often with friends and frequent collaborators like Lil Tracy (see “Witchblades” for a representative example). They were evocative, Peep’s tattooed-yet-innocent face was pretty to look at, and the aesthetic was by turns bracing, slightly eerie, and instantly (perhaps even predictively) nostalgic. The first time I ever heard of Lil Peep, it was by snarky friends of mine who swore I would hate the kid, but I watched a few of these videos and I was instantly hooked. In fact, this aesthetic instantly reminded me of Title Fight, another act who cross genre lines and manage to evoke that same feeling of manufactured, nay, immediate, nostalgia (it doesn’t hurt that they also shot videos on VHS).\n\nWhile Lil Peep’s audience wasn’t exactly the same as Title Fight’s, he did speak to something similar, and it makes lots of sense that he could be considered a pop-punk artist, or even (deep breath) an emo revival act. He wasn’t reviving any sound as much as reinventing it– what he was reviving was the connection between artist and audience that flourished in the mainstream emo explosion of the early 2000s. Why do you think Lil Uzi Vert’s “XO Tour Lif3” was such a huge hit? Here’s a hint– Uzi tapped into those same feelings, and by his own admission, Hayley Williams is his biggest influence.\n\nLil Peep’s posses– first Schemaposse, and then GothBoiClique and a litany of assorted hangers-on– reminded me of the California hardcore band Trash Talk, who lived in similarly destroyed LA apartments, skating and writing graffiti, and associating with the rappers and artists in the Odd Future collective. However, while Trash Talk’s music and image were fundamentally alienating, even by hardcore standards (their shows are notoriously unhinged– I’m sure you’ve heard of the dude who pissed in his own mouth in a Trash Talk pit), Peep and his friends were welcoming and inclusive. Peep famously came out as bisexual in the most nonchalant way possible, and that nonchalance extended to his inclusion of a trans woman of color in the music video for his song with Horse Head, “Girls.” While his tall, gaunt frame and adorable facial features lent themselves to modeling, his fashion sense was androgynous, owing as much to the forward-thinking attire of Young Thug as it did to the sartorial flamboyance of bands like early Panic! at the Disco. Peep was also vocally outspoken about the mistreatment of women in the music industry (his posthumous, record-label-induced collaboration with the violently misogynistic and homophobic XXXTentacion would be, I’m sure, deeply distressing to him had he been alive). Fans of his who were in marginalized communities identified on a deep level with his bluntly (dashboard) confessional lyrics about suicidal impulses and drug use, both of which are afflictions that teenagers struggling with self-identity and dysphoria are often victim to. But Lil Peep’s music resonated with so many because pain is universal, and Peep’s mono-articulate straightforwardness spoke to that pain in a universal, plainspoken way. This new wave of hip-hop speaks to the same feelings as pop-punk did in its commercial heyday. Kids will always fundamentally go through the same things, and now that the Internet has been around for three generations of them, they’ll use that in the same way.\n\nExtremely important in Peep’s rise to fame was the Internet– utilizing Twitter, Instagram, and Soundcloud as fan-building tools as well as indulging in every adolescent’s self-revealing, diaristic, and flippant impulses, the Internet presence of Peep and his peers reminded me that the more social media changes, the more it stays the same. Things have become sleeker and the language has updated, but Peep’s feverish cult of personality reminded me of the MySpace scene queens who built brands and loyalty through their appearances and personas, as well as the masterful self-marketing of bands. Kids will still post Lil Peep lyrics to describe their mood on Twitter, in the exact same way that a melodramatic LiveJournal post would be titled after a Say Anything song. Tinder has made hooking up faster and more localized than the days of Makeoutclub, where you would court someone for months before flying a plane across the country to have awkward sex and then leave the next day, but the mechanics are basically the same, sloppy and youthful as they ever were, fleeting as always. The outsized emotions of hormonal teenagerdom, made even more expansive by having a constant audience and mimicking the way they express their emotions, are just as perfect for Peep and emo rap’s rise as they were for Fall Out Boy and Panic! at the Disco.\n\n“Emo rap” as a term has been around for quite some time, going as far back as 1997, when Slug of Atmosphere used it to describe the introspective and cathartic nature of his lyrics as well as his DIY work ethic (founding his own independent label, Rhymesayers, to release his own music and the music of likeminded rappers) and his melodic, hard-hitting production (courtesy of Ant). Being from the Midwest city of Minneapolis, I’m sure he was familiar with the emo coming out of his region, but it was a sight to behold a hip-hop artist associating himself with music that could clearly be derided as “soft.” As Rhymesayers grew, with highly emotive and melodically inventive hip-hop artists like Eyedea & Abilities, Brother Ali, and P.O.S. all being associated with it, “emo” exploded in the mainstream, and by 2008, Kid Cudi and Kanye West’s depressive masterwork 808s & Heartbreak were being described as emo.\n\nI think it’d be myopic of me to assign emo the same meaning in hip-hop as it has in rock music– while deeply intertwined in many ways, hip-hop and DIY/hardcore/etc. are still distinct subcultures and I think there are semantic differences between their interpretations of emo that should be respected. However, with many artists blurring the lines between the cultures and sounds– Lil Ugly Mane, Wicca Phase Springs Eternal, nothing.nowhere., SCXRLXRD, and Ghostemane chief among them, helping to popularize the hardcore and emo acts that they tour with along the way– I would point to Lil Peep as the ultimate synthesis of these disparate definitions of emo. Hip-hop and punk-derived genres are both inherently democratizing and populist forms of music, but with the ascension of Lil Peep, the fusion of these two genres finally seemed to become something more than a punchline about late 90s nü metal. It’s more than white kids appropriating black culture***, it’s cultural exchange and synthesis for a whole new milieu of teenagers. This new wave– known by emo rap, trap metal, or shadow rap– was developed by people of color like Lil Tracy, Shinigami, SCXRLXRD, Cold Hart, and Zillakami alongside their white peers, which is demonstrative of how arbitrary the division between hip-hop and rock (a division that has always been implicitly racialized) is. Mutual respect and dialogue is always a good thing, and I have greater hope in this generation of musicians than any before.\n\n***: One could absolutely still argue that black culture is being exploited by white hip-hop artists like Post Malone, who don’t have reverence for the art form or the culture. Lil Peep’s racially-diverse GothBoiClique never seemed to blink at having white members like Peep or Wicca Phase, but hip-hop culture is not a monolith. It’s predominantly rooted in stories of black struggle, but Latino culture also has deep ties to it, and hip-hop artists of all stripes have accepted white rappers like El-P, Mac Miller, and the Beastie Boys, all of whom historically showed deep respect to the culture as well as demonstrated a clear aptitude at the art form. It’s a question of integrity, respect, and talent, and it’s also, to an even greater extent, about class and power. At the end of the day, as my Jewfro indicates, I’m far too white-passing to say anything definitive on the subject– I’m just echoing what I have heard and learned from the people of color around me. Above all else, listen to and respect their voices first in these discussions.\n\nHELLBOY\n\n(the backlash)\n\nBy the same token, I feel as if a lot of the vitriol aimed towards Peep often came from older people, especially older white people, and especially the variety who prized the specificity and secrecy of the Midwest emo of their youth, who could not fathom the boundaries breaking down in this way. Around the time that Pitchfork released that infamous “The Future of Emo” article about Peep (a claim that Peep denies in the same article), the backlash reached critical mass. I moderate /r/emo, and there were daily– in fact, near-hourly— heated debates about whether or not to allow emo rap in the sub. The arguments that went further than “Peep is trash” usually boiled down to “It’s just not the same genre.” There is some implicit cognitive bias in this statement– it postulates that not only should hip-hop and emo not blend, but that people who try are committing heresy, as if one DIY art form crossing over into another was anathema to the whole enterprise.\n\nI spoke earlier about the way that “hip-hop” and “rock” as phrases– denoting fanbase– became racialized over time. Despite hip-hop being the most popular form of music in America (a majority-white country), hip-hop is still coded as “urban.” Don’t get me wrong, hip-hop is inarguably black music, but it very obviously isn’t exclusively black, and it hasn’t been for a long time, especially not now; the same goes for rock music, which also began as black music, but was co-opted by white entertainers until it became almost exclusively white, with DIY punk and hardcore music (and their derivatives) often being one of the few spaces where people of color could have a voice in the genre. While early punk and early hip-hop certainly have ties, I find that it wasn’t until the advent of hardcore, the first truly DIY-from-the-ground-up movement in punk rock, that hip-hop and punk culture began to intermingle in a way that was more than a novelty. Hardcore was a genre founded by black people (Bad Brains), and with a rich Latino lineage, so to me, this seems like a no-brainer.\n\nGraffiti– one of the four elements of hip-hop culture– and skateboarding– a sport that gained its greatest foothold in America as more than a passing fad when West Coast hardcore kids adopted it in the 80s– assisted in cross-pollination between hardcore and hip-hop throughout the 90s and early 2000s. Hardcore bands composed of graffiti writers like Downset and Spazz also flirted with hip-hop (Kool Keith even has a drop on a Spazz record, and shouted the band out on the Dr. Octagon track “I’m Destructive”). Downset, for their part, were the one band of the 90s who did Rage Against the Machine just as well, if not better, than Rage themselves (Downset’s “Anger” is a thinly-veiled criticism of Zach de la Rocha talking about a gang life that he never experienced in Rage’s “Settle for Nothing”— compare Rage’s lyric “I got a nine, a sign, a set, and now I’ve got a name” to Downset’s “Whatchu know about a set or a sign? Fake motherfucker, never even seen a nine”). Rage Against the Machine themselves, the oft-mentioned pioneers of rap-metal, were named after a scrapped song from Zach’s former hardcore band, Inside Out. Meanwhile, the massively popular video game series Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater exposed millions of skateboarding youths to underground hip-hop alongside various strains of punk. By the time of the time of the mid-late 2010s, it had become commonplace for Soundcloud rappers to rep hardcore and death metal (Lil Ugly Mane is probably the biggest influence in this regard, always wearing Jesus Piece and Obituary merch), and for rappers to experiment with a hardcore-derived screaming delivery in their tracks. Emo and screamo were simply the next logical step, and at this point the massively popular producer Nedarb is wearing a Saetia shirt on the cover of his solo album.\n\nCollectives like THRAXXHOUSE, GothBoiClique, and Misery Club aren’t just the new incarnation of hip-hop groups like Wu-Tang Clan and Hieroglyphics– they’re part of a generation of groups founded through message board culture. They met or connected musically online, just like newer collectives in the same vein, like the hardcore-affiliated OFWGKTA, Brockhampton, and Injury Reserve. They’re also the new hardcore and emo bands, eking out a whole different kind of DIY circuit, one that navigates the internet just as much if not more than tour cycles. Yes, there’s still bands making guitar-based punk/emo/hardcore music, but when they’re releasing and promoting their music in the exact same ways as these rap groups, on Bandcamp and Soundcloud and Twitter and Instagram, why do those distinctions need to exist, beyond simple categorization? More often than not, the fanbases cross over anyway, so who cares?\n\nThe obvious answer, as always, is annoying old people, which finally brings me back to Lil Peep. His track with Gab3, the smokeasac and Yung Cortex-produced “Hollywood Dreaming,” samples Mineral’s “LoveLetterTypewriter,” a seminal Midwest emo song. To me, this was an obvious and good-natured show of affection towards their influences– “showing some love,” as Peep put it. It was released for free on YouTube and Soundcloud. Mineral themselves seemed to be none too pleased that they weren’t contacted about the sample (although now that they’ve reunited and are playing to crowds of both old fans and new kids who may have been introduced to them through Lil Peep’s sample, I wonder if they’re still upset), which set off a wave of angry responses through the old-o-sphere. Much love to Tom Mullen, but when my friend Kyle and I had him on our podcast, the E Word, we got into a brief spat over the subject. His party line is none too dissimilar to most other complaints, which is why I’m using him as an example– they should have gotten the sample cleared, and otherwise they were being disrespectful. My argument then is the same as it is now. For one thing, they didn’t actually make any money off the song, and for another, the sample itself was a show of respect and acknowledgment. Laws against sampling have long been used as an attempt to hold hip-hop production back, but intellectual property is not only an inherently gross and capitalistic concept, it simply shouldn’t hold up when the sample is used in a transformative way (for example, going from one genre to another, creating an entirely new song). Could they have asked for permission for the sample, or used an interpolation? Sure, but it would have been irrelevant, because old people were just going to be angry about kids “co-opting” their culture anyway. It’s sad to see a lot of younger people falling into these arguments as well.\n\nIt does bear mention that fans of underground music are often more protective of their genres of choice than fans of mainstream music– there was no major backlash to one of Peep’s best songs, “Yesterday,” which is not only much more straightforward in its sampling of Oasis’s “Wonderwall,” but also features a reinterpreted version of the vocal melody in “Wonderwall”‘s verses (in the context of the mixtape it’s on, Crybaby, it basically functions as an “Anyway, here’s ‘Wonderwall'” joke). I said earlier that Title Fight’s fanbase was different from Peep’s, but it didn’t have to be. I think young DIY rock fans have the capability of embracing this branch of hip-hop, and some of them do, but too many of them don’t want to. For a lot of white and ostensibly well-meaning kids in the DIY scene today, hip-hop is music that they don’t need to care about, or worse, music that they only care about in a tokenizing or condescending way to legitimize their taste in music to themselves and their peers (“My last.fm chart could use a more strategically placed JPEGMAFIA album,” they mumble to themselves). I understand that there’s no accounting for taste, but in a world that is becoming increasingly genre-agnostic, there’s no need to chain yourself to a constructed persona. People are messy and you won’t always adhere to a “brand.” It’s okay.\n\nSome people took aim at Peep’s lyrics as vapid– that misses the point. They were deliberately spartan, as that was the best way of constructing the mood and conveying the feelings that Peep was aiming for. There is a valid argument to be made that his lyrics in songs like “Girls” and the somewhat-reprehensible “Driveway” were sexist. That is fair; as much as Peep, in his personal life, tried to combat the abuse of women in the music industry, his lyrics often portrayed someone who could be very vengeful against women, and that’s something that’s always been endemic in the tortured, toxic masculinity of emo in most of its incarnations. Still, by the time of his later material, Peep was showing signs of growing out of those lyrical conceits, and it’s hard to tell how else he might have matured as an artist in future years. Add to that his unblemished record– in a scene that’s often seen as a hotbed for abuse, Peep was never even thought, much less accused of, being an abuser– and it’s clear that his heart was in a much better place than people gave it credit for. As for the rest– the suicidal impulses, the drug abuse– Peep was singing about his reality, one that many people related to, and I find it hard to condemn that.\n\nThen there was a whole other contingent of gatekeeper who despised Peep (and for that matter, all Soundcloud rappers) for the most predictable reasons: alarmism and forced moral outrage. Face tattoos? Drug use? What is this world coming to? Most people are smart enough to see through this as the same type of faux-anger directed at pretty much every rising subculture once it becomes apparent that suburban children could be exposed to the nefarious and degenerate lifestyle choices of the lower class (the “culture war” narrative that refuses to die has been in existence, in its contemporary form, since at least Tipper Gore and the PMRC). I shouldn’t have to tell you that it’s nonsense, because it should be self-evident. There is a new angle here, as Peep’s death and Soundcloud rap culture as a whole is tied to the opiate epidemic, but let’s be honest, the concerns raised about that are 1. fake non-empathy and judgment directed at drug addicts and 2. the polar opposite of the apathetic and even dangerous response that was directed at the crack epidemic. However, the crack epidemic plagued the black community, while the face of the opiate epidemic is mostly white. Shocking.\n\nBEAMERBOY\n\n(and the rest)\n\nSo when you strip away the responses to Peep’s music, both positive and negative, what is left? The material reality of the situation is that Peep was an extremely talented and innovative musician, which his major label debut, Come Over When You’re Sober, Part One proved amply as it became an immediate hit. It was a trap-infused update of the emo anthems of the early 2000s– with the samples done away with, Peep and his producers composed their own beats, which were filled with dark, twisting bass lines and guitar melodies by turns mournful, melancholic, and menacing. Even the most major-key number, the pop-punk-infused banger “Awful Things,” is stacked with Peep’s anguished yowl and a music video that plays with both ironic and genuinely sad iconography. In it, Peep confronts his real feelings of betrayal when he sees the girl he likes flirting with someone else by engaging in a self-aware and over-the-top act of self-immolation (onlookers literally mouth the words “what the fuck?”). It’s a nifty balancing act of self-consciousness, both reveling in and making fun of the emotions that he’s going through, which is instantly appealing to a generation that sees irony as the baseline of contact with the world around them. And yet, Peep’s approach to the music itself is wholly non-ironic, a purging of demons that never seems to end because he’s wallowing in the emotions even as he engages in the catharsis.\n\nThere’s a nearly intangible, but extremely noticeable shift in gloss between Peep’s underground material and Come Over When You’re Sober. Call it the damnation of low expectations, but while Peep’s earlier material is infused with the likability of a dirtbag who knows he’s going to flame out and die early (On his breakthrough mixtape Hellboy, he drawls “I used to wanna kill myself/Came up, still wanna kill myself”), it’s always tempered by the fact that Peep was so clearly enamored with fame. From naming a song “Cobain” to his tireless self-promotion, Peep was self-mythologizing to a fault. He was both honest and inscrutable– lines like “I don’t wanna lie, I wanna keep it real/I don’t wanna tell you how I feel” speak to this dichotomy– but more than anything, the thing that kept me invested in the kid was hoping he would overcome his issues and make it. On Come Over When You’re Sober, Part One we’re confronted with the fact that although he had finally made it, he was still just as miserable as ever. Add to that the pressures of touring and the fact that arguably his management enabled his drug addiction, and it was immediately clear that he was going to meet the exact fate that he always sang about.\n\nWhether the music that he made and the people he associated with fueled his disregard for himself is irrelevant. There’s also a multitude of conspiracy theories surrounding his death, none of which I’m particularly interested in. Peep’s death came at an extremely weird time in my life– I was about to descend into some of the worst depths of my own bad decision-making, and the specter of his life and death hung heavy over the following few months. His music soundtracked a particularly hopeless and directionless patch of my life, and I feel like as much as it resonated with me before and after, Peep’s music never meant as much to me as it did in that immediate period. Counter as it runs to the nature of this column, I fear getting too indulgent, so I’ll spare you the details.\n\nUltimately, this column is about Lil Peep, and it’s difficult for me to think of a more representative performance of his than this video of him covering blink-182’s “Dammit.” His enthusiasm for the track is infectious, transforming what could have been little more than a karaoke performance into a transcendent moment of old and new colliding in a heartwarming and definitive way. “Dammit” occupies an extremely unique space in our cultural fabric– as the first guitar riff that most people of a certain age learn, it’s deeply embedded in our consciousness as a relic of late 90s nostalgia, and yet something about it will always feel timeless and relevant, and Peep’s choice to close his show with a cover of it speaks to both his respect for the pop-punk of years past and the way that those feelings will always remain trapped in time, frozen for angsty teenagers who hate their hometown and love their friends to discover whenever they are ready. It’s a beautiful moment of catharsis and homage.\n\nIt’s this image of Peep that I prefer to keep in my mind when I think of him, and not the shameless cash-in of the posthumous collaborations foisted upon his legacy by his record label, who have been pretty shamelessly manipulating the grief of his mother and his friends (like the producer smokeasac or rapper/possible partner iLoveMakonnen) into blatantly obvious cash grabs. “Sunlight On Your Skin” was a clear anthem about love between two men, and it was contorted into a gross mess with obfuscated lyrics and a guest spot by a man who represented everything that Lil Peep stood against, and then given the remix treatment by a desperate-to-stay-relevant Travis Barker (talk about symmetry in the worst possible way). That Fall Out Boy track is better, musically, but completely extraneous. Come Over When You’re Sober, Part Two is another mess of a record; for every strong salvaged song like “Sex with My Ex” and “Cry Alone” there’s a repackaging of a Peep song that was better served in its original form (“Life Is Beautiful” is a confused, I’m-14-and-this-is-deep reconstruction of an old Peep track from 2015, while “16 Lines” was a leaked track that stood much better in its initial incarnation). The song “Fingers” ends with the forced emotional manipulation of Peep saying “I’m not gonna last long”– how much more crude and empty can you get about an artist’s death? Peep shouldn’t be remembered as a martyr or a scapegoat. He was a goth angel sinner.\n\nAm I embarrassed to be a fan of Lil Peep? I never have been, and never will. I will defend his place in emo’s history to my dying breath, as his ascendance was the perfect counter-example to people who claim that the way that fans connected with emo bands in the past could never happen in the age of social media. If anything, social media makes the connection more palpable; for as much as we could talk about parasocial relationships, the youth of many of these performers makes them more open to their fans, makes them more real and knowable. While that may be something of a social construct, social constructs are very powerful and very real. The pain that I and others felt at Lil Peep’s loss was as real as any other relationship that people in America create with a celebrity. It may be passe, but I’d like to conclude this column with two things. First is an arguably overwrought and emotional post I wrote immediately in the aftermath of Peep’s death:\n\nThis kid needed help. He posted a video on his Instagram yesterday of himself trying and failing to get Xanax into his mouth. Interviews with him were always incredibly troubling, too. Someone should have intervened. But honestly, an intervention would have been really hard too, considering the crowd he ran with. I’m sick of this shit; we shouldn’t have to try and tell a fucking aesthetic apart from a legitimate problem. Stop romanticizing drug use.\n\nEither show people with addiction some empathy any other day of the fucking week or shut the fuck up, permanently. You’re not helping by offering your empty, hollow sympathies anytime another one of us poor junkies dies. Save that shit for your DARE presentation.\n\nTo make things even more crystal clear– Lil Peep wasn’t popping xans because his “music and lifestyle” glorified it. He was depressed as fuck and that’s immediately apparent when you read his lyrics or look at his Instagram; he was asking for help at least half the time. The blame for “glorifying” drug use isn’t on the artists themselves, it’s on the system that banks off the controversy and clicks it gets from those artists being open about their troubles. The blame is on anyone who profited off that shit without once thinking to step in to help him. The blame is on the industry folks– record execs, managers, anyone with a professional foothold in Peep’s career– who saw Lil Peep, mentally ill and killing himself daily with his drug addiction, and instead of trying to help him get clean, forced him to go on fucking tour. The fact that people are still going back to the same hoary old “rap culture” well pisses me the fuck off. Yeah, Peep was a depressed drug addicted musician who hung out with other depressed drug addict musicians… No fucking shit, Sherlock. You’re not a next-level culture critic.\n\nPerhaps a bit too much, but these feelings are still just as strong today as they were in November of 2017. And if nothing else, no one else could have said what Peep and his fans were going through during his and their darkest times than Peep himself, in his song “U Said”:\n\nSometimes life gets fucked up\n\nThat’s why we get fucked up\n\nI can still feel your touch\n\nI still do those same drugs\n\nThat we used to do\n\nI was used to you\n\n“What have you been through?” she asked me\n\nEvery fucking kind of abuse\n\nNot everyone can say they’ve been through his exact struggles, but everyone can know what it feels like to be at the bottom. And if nothing else, that’s what emo is about: articulating what it feels like to be at the bottom, and rejoicing in the relief that comes with seeing other people come together, hands clasped, shouting your words back at you, and saying, “I know. I’m here. You aren’t alone.”\n\nNEXT WEEK: This column must come to an end, my friends, and I can think of no finale more fitting than the kings of bands that you weren’t supposed to like, the culprits of distorting everything about emo and presenting it to audiences of millions, the enemy of oversensitive authenticity-fetishists everywhere: My Chemical Romance. See you soon.\n\nIf you are dealing with drug abuse or mental health problems, please, seek help. Here is a list of international helplines. If someone has a better source for these, I implore them to post it below.\n\nPRELUDE 12/21\n\nWhen I told my partner that AFI was the next band to be covered for this series, her response was, “Really? AFI? Were they a band that you weren’t supposed to like?”\n\nThat question made me stop for a moment. I have a tendency to lump a lot of the Warped Tour/Taste of Chaos/mall emo scene together, both for pragmatic purposes and because a lot of the same people listened to all of those bands. But my partner is right: AFI was a little bit different. For a certain period of time, AFI were kind of considered the same way that bands like Thursday, Taking Back Sunday, Glassjaw, and Every Time I Die were: normies were into them, but it was okay for hardcore kids to get down with them too. However, sometime after 2003’s major label breakthrough Sing the Sorrow (and certainly by the time that “Miss Murder” was destroying the airwaves in 2006), AFI crossed a line. They were not only now a band entirely for the mallrat crowd, but they were also receiving a nearly-unrivaled amount of venom, both for their music and for the androgynous, flamboyant attire of lead singer Davey Havok and guitarist Jade Puget. In particular, I remember a lot of the ire being aimed at them as transphobic in nature; Havok was regularly referred to as a “he-she” by the eternally enlightened punk traditionalists.\n\nAFI underwent another shift in public perception following 2009’s Crash Love. While their diehards were still ready and willing to go in any direction AFI was willing to take them, the record-buying public and the DIY kids both seemingly forgot about them entirely. They were now in “Oh, they’re still a band?” territory. For reasons I’ll get into later, that’s kind of a shame, because the band started pulling cues from post-punk and indie rock that manifested in unique ways, but for the purposes of this article, it’s pertinent to remind everyone that to most people, AFI are remembered for anywhere from two to four albums, but they’ve produced ten.\n\nWhile AFI may not have been as successful as many other bands in this series at adapting themselves to the changing times, they’re worth taking a look at. In many ways, their life as a band is a microcosm of the scene we’re talking about: starting life as a scrappy skate-punk band, maturing into material that took more from hardcore and pop, and eventually transcending their roots and becoming something entirely different, yet still with those hardcore roots intact.\n\nCULT STATUS\n\nThe thing about Northern California is that while places like Berkeley and San Francisco often get a lot of credit for being countercultural meccas, NorCal is still home to a metric ton of boring, borderline rural places. Ukiah, California is one of these; AFI often brightened up their roots by claiming to be an “East Bay Hardcore” band, and while that may technically be true, Ukiah is miserable. According to Wikipedia, two of their largest employers are Wal-Mart and Home Depot, which says a lot about your options there. The Bay Area is also known for a preponderance of methamphetamine addiction (even Billie Joe Armstrong was hooked on it for a while– see “Brain Stew” and “Geek Stink Breath”) and general drug usage, which is why Davey and Jade being vegan straight-edge is pretty unique for that area. All things considered, Ukiah is a pretty weird place for a band like AFI to have come from, almost as much as the Used coming from Orem. But don’t be fooled by the odd circumstances of their formation: early AFI is about as boilerplate as you can get.\n\nI’m sure Answer That and Stay Fashionable and Very Proud of Ya have their adherents (many of whom were pissed at AFI for daring to actually write, you know, hooks and memorable parts in any of their songs later on), but even when I was younger and excited about this type of music, neither album made much of an impression. The one standout track is probably “I Wanna Get A Mohawk (But My Mom Won’t Let Me Get One)”, a pretty entertaining anthem for the type of suburban mall-punkers who were starting to get into the scene in the mid-90s thanks to the success of bands like NOFX and Lagwagon.\n\nUltimately though, from their first stirrings in 1991 up until about 1997, AFI were kind of boring. They hadn’t even settled on AFI standing for A Fire Inside, instead bandying about Asking For It, Anthems For Insubordinates, and Another Fucking Initial. And while Davey Havok and drummer Adam Carson were instituted in the band from the get-go, two of the most vital parts of their sound (guitarist and primary songwriter Jade Puget and bassist Hunter Burgan) were yet to join the fray. The result is a series of extremely monochromatic punk songs that have the snotty aesthetic of a band like Screeching Weasel or Guttermouth, but without any of the personality or catchiness. The songs are also mostly jokey affairs, rarely stopping to plumb the depths of despair in the way that the band would soon make their career out of.\n\nThat changed (somewhat) with the release of Shut Your Mouth and Open Your Eyes in 1997, the first AFI album to feature Hunter Burgan on bass– I don’t know what it is about the Bay Area, but it has a consummate knack for producing agile bassists who are uniquely adept at constructing extremely catchy and engaging bass lines (see also: Klaus Flouride, Matt Freeman, and Mike Dirnt). While Jade was yet to be a full-fledged member of the band, he contributed vocals and guitar work to several songs on the album. It was also the first album to feature one of AFI’s standing traditions– the short intro track. While it wasn’t the absolute peak of their powers, it was the first AFI record that felt like a record rather than a collection of songs. In addition, the riffs were getting both more melodic and harder-edged (they were finally discovering the “hardcore” part of “hardcore punk”) and Davey was finding his voice as a frontman, evolving from a nasal yelp into a sharper timbre with lots of range (check his screams in “Three Seconds Notice,” “Today’s Lesson,” and “Let It Be Broke,” for example).\n\nMore than that, the songs were becoming much more memorable, resulting in actual, anthemic songs rather than minute-and-a-half bursts of adolescent noise (those are still there, too, though). Songs like “Third Season” and “Salt for Your Wounds” are fully formed, engaging, and dare I say, catchy, bolstered by the inclusion of gang vocals. While they’d always been a part of AFI’s sound, it’s here that they began to take on their status as a fifth member of the band, adding weight and melody to already strong songs and fostering an extremely communal and energetic atmosphere.\n\nShut Your Mouth is often unfairly lumped in with the formless mess of the first two AFI records, but there is a lot to like here, especially if you’ve already whetted your appetite with their later material and want something with a touch more hardcore-esque aggression. The twisty-turns at the beginning of “Three Seconds Notice,” the two-step dance part at the end of “The New Patron Saints and Angels,” the haunting and eerie guitar work during the verses of “Third Season,” and the generally moody bridges that pervade throughout many songs on the record throughout makes Shut Your Mouth stand out among the glut of bro-stomp moshcore and youth crew revival that made up the majority of late-90s hardcore. Plus, Davey was developing a dark and twisted charisma all his own; drawing from the machismo of Glenn Danzig, the sensitivity of Robert Smith and Morrissey, and the throaty screams of Henry Rollins and Ian MacKaye, he was a Molotov cocktail of a frontman. Known for his devilock, his unorthodox stage presence (he would often stand on the audience’s heads while singing) and wholesale commitment to the material, he made AFI stand out in a live setting when they could have easily sunk into a morass of personality-less punk.\n\nStill, there was something missing from Shut Your Mouth and Open Your Eyes, not from all the songs, but from enough of them that the album felt like it could be improved upon. When Jade Puget joined the band as a full-time member in 1998 (coinciding with the exit of previous lead guitarist Mark Stopholes), things truly came together. I can’t stress enough how much Jade’s guitar sound is AFI. Drawing from hardcore more than straight-up punk, he was also heavily influenced by goth favorites like Siouxsie and the Banshees and Sisters of Mercy, which came through both in the theatricality of his riffs as well as the out-and-out poppiness of much of his material. This blend helped give AFI a huge sound and personality, and the difference is immediately noticeable on their first release with their newly solidified lineup, 1998’s A Fire Inside EP.\n\nThe two original tracks, “3 1/2” and “Over Exposure,” are an immediate step up from Shut Your Mouth, both in songwriting and production. Davey is beginning to an experiment with a mildly sassy spoken word delivery, while Jade’s guitar sound is just harder-hitting than anything the band had ever done before. The rhythm section matches the intensity perfectly– the breakdown in “Over Exposure” sounds absolutely massive. Genre-wise, the band is still playing speedy hardcore, but there’s an intangible new sense of darkness and desperation that plays out in fascinating ways.\n\nThe band also flexes new muscles on the B-side of the EP, which features a slightly rocked-out rendition of the Cure’s “Hanging Garden” and a fairly faithful version of the Misfits’ “Demonomania.” These covers make perfect sense– when you synthesize the Misfits and the Cure and update it with a snarling 90s sensibility, you get AFI.\n\nA Fire Inside was released on Adeline Records, the vanity label that was started by Green Day’s Billie Joe Armstrong in order to help out more underground punk bands, but AFI was soon snatched up by the vanity label of a different big-league punk rocker– Nitro, which was run by Dexter Holland of the Offspring, who had recently signed to a major label and was experiencing massive success off the corny sugar-rush of Americana. With the backing of Holland, AFI doubled down on their songwriting efforts and began to experience their true creative peak.\n\nCLOVE SMOKE CATHARSIS\n\nNobody really saw Black Sails In the Sunset coming. While it was plain to see that AFI were heading in a more serious direction with their last two releases, neither were necessarily cohesive. Black Sails is meant to be listened to as an album; from front to back, it doesn’t let up (aside from the ten-minute silence between ostensible closer “God Called In Sick Today” and hidden track “Midnight Sun”). No longer were AFI simply moody, they were downright miserable. No matter how exuberant the music itself sounded (and, trust, there are double-time skank beats for days on Black Sails), the guitar tone was dark, and Davey’s lyrics and delivery were darker. Add to that his newfound range– while he still remained in the upper-register shout of Shut Your Mouth and A Fire Inside, he also introduced a low-key, sensitive singing voice– and even more macabre lyrics, Black Sails is the apotheosis of every hardcore kid’s obsession with the Smiths, a darkly addictive and unrelenting album that successfully fused hardcore with goth and pop in a way that had never been done before, not even by similarly tortured bands like Christian Death.\n\nFrom the militaristic chanting intro of “Strength Through Wounding,” it’s clear that AFI aren’t fucking around, and “Porphyria” follows through on that promise, moving from a breakneck intro to a swaggering, stomping breakdown bridge and b"
