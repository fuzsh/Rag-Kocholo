        "text": "I have a list. Actually, I have many lists. One list is my favorite songs currently. A whole nother list is my favorite bands ever… of all time. A whole nother list after that is my favorite songs ever… of all time. You get the idea. But one list I haven’t made yet, is one that has my favorite bands to see live in concert. Well that ends today. Last December, I got the brilliant idea to write about 31 songs in 31 days. It amounted to writing about one song a day for the month, from December 1st to 31st. That song a day for a month idea, translated into writing about a song a day for an entire year this year! That project is on Day 336 of 365 and is closing in the grand finale. While I don’t really have a surprise like the 31 songs in 31 days project last December, I am going to try to have a whole nother post to go along with the daily Song a Day for a Year project post.\n\nSo that’s where this post comes in… it’s a list, because everyone loves lists. As I mentioned, I do have musical artists and bands I love to go see in concert and have seen those artists and bands multiple times in concert. Keep in mind, this is subjective (clearly) and my opinion only. It’s also not a ranking nor is it a contest. Just because I have one artist/band at 1 and a whole nother at 10, means nothing. I’ll give my overall opinion on each based on a few factors (and some random voodoo bullshit advanced baseball mentions). So, without any further interruption and talk of musical philosophy, here is a list ten of my favorite musical artists/bands to see in concert.\n\n1. Arkells\n\nThe Arkells hail from the Great White North, Canada. Their sound has evolved greatly this coming on to the scene, going from early Hall and Oates to more modern Hall and Oates. Their version of blue eyed soul can only be described as “black and blue eyed soul). An Arkells concert is akin to a religious experience for some. For me, every time I’ve seen them live, it’s been a [redacted] amazing show. The energy that Max Kerman and company bring to the stage is incredible. It’s so much dynamic energy, the band could power a large American city by themselves. Max and co., definitely know how to work an audience. Whether it was the Rally Cry hotline where fans of the band could call in (toll free) and rest a song be played at a show in their city; jumping up on a bar top at Underground Arts while singing a song; leading a conga line through the crowd; having “doctor’s notes” ready to go for random fans to give to their bosses; asking fans to join them on stage to play guitar or saxophone or sing along to a song… the list goes on. While the sound varies from venue to venue, they sound amazing live, even better than they do in studio. Every show was different, extremely fun and exciting and the band made sure the atmosphere reflected that. Also in a related note, that cover of ABBA‘s Dancing Queen with The Greeting Committee was legitimately perfect.\n\nOVERALL OPINION: It’s time to join the Nondenominational Gospel Choir of Philadelphia the next time the Arkells are in Philly.\n\n2. Dave Hause and The Mermaid\n\nWhat do get when you take one of the best of Philadelphia’s hardcore punk scene and some of the best all-star musicians around? You get Philadelphia ex-pat, Dave Hause and his band, The Mermaid. Dave Hause, in my ever so humble opinion is to be considered Philadelphia Springsteen. His ability to write songs and turn them into personal experiences for the listener is second to none. That’s what his concerts are like… even giant-ass music festivals. Hause manages to make them feel, well, intimate… like we’re having a one-on-one conversation through music. And that’s just his unplugged shows. His plugged-in shows are, for lack of a better pun, electric. He ratchets the energy up to 11 and makes a weekday night seem like a Saturday night. The strange irony is, I have a whole nother artist on this list to thank for me discovering just how awesome Dave and company are live.\n\nOVERALL OPINION: Shout out to Tommy Conwell for getting me hooked on Hause’s music. That said, well worth the price of admission… and the lost voice. An intimate affair with electric guitars… even with a couple hundred strangers.\n\n3. The Wonder Years\n\nIf you are looking for a whole nother local band that bring the heat and energy, look no further than, The Wonder Years. The Wonder Years are one of the biggest names in pop punk today. Vocalist Dan “Soupy” Campbell is to be considered Philadelphia Springsteen as well, in my humble opinion. His ability to craft songs that are highly relatable to every listener is second to none. Their shows are close to that level. Every show of theirs I’ve been too has been packed… the energy level was through the roof. I’ve only seen them a few times, but every time has been an amazing experience. I’ve lost my voice every time, shouting along to the songs. My feet would ache from jumping up and down when certain songs would play. Much like the the first two bands, The Wonder Years are definitely worth seeing again (and again).\n\nOVERALL OPINION: This band comes out swinging from a South Philly basement with raw energy and power; well worth the sore vocal chords from shouting along.\n\n4. The Menzingers\n\nScranton’s native sons and Philadelphia’s adopted sons, The Menzingers are a blast to see live. If you are looking for pure badass energy and kickass music, look no further. Once again, The Menzingers are a whole nother band where I found myself no only having an awesome time, but losing my voice. Their shows are raucous and loud, but extremely fun. Much like every other band on this list, I found myself at the end of the set or show leaving with a big cheese-eating grin on my face because of how happy I was.\n\nOVERALL OPINION: One of the first bands to leave me smiling at the end of the show for how happy I was. 100% needs to be seen live for the full experience that the studio can’t reproduce.\n\n5. Kayleigh Goldsworthy\n\nIf you are looking for the true definition of a BAMF when it comes to stage presence and command, look no further than Syracuse, New York native and Philadelphia’s adopted daughter, Kayleigh Goldsworthy. I’ve seen her play with Dave Hause, Frank Iero, and other artists… and holy carp is she a badass all-star musician. I’ve never experienced a show that intimate have such energy. That said, you’re going to tired of hearing me say this by the end of this post but it needs to be said… she is definitely worth seeing live. Would’ve saw her play live in Philly earlier this year (September/October, I think) if it wasn’t for my work schedule.\n\nOVERALL OPINION: when the most Philadelphian musician in the city isn’t even from here… that’s the time of energy and ethic her shows bring to the table. You get excellent quality over quantity compared to other artists and bands.\n\n6. The Interrupters\n\nThe Interrupters are an exciting band to see live. First off, this a band that does ska right. Seriously, you can never go wrong with ska. Or ska-punk for that matter. The energy level from the band just set the stage for the rest of evening…. and that’s what I want to see, feel, and hear. I want to be energized and ready to party and hot damn did they bring the noise. This was definitely a band I lost my voice shouting and singing along to.\n\nOVERALL OPINION: This is a band to see live if you love ska and want to have a fun time cranking, skanking, and singing the night away.\n\n7. Valencia\n\nValencia is still one of my favorite local bands. They were the kings of pop punk for a time. Their music is infectious and catchy while maintaining an edge to them. Much like fellow Philly compatriots, The Wonder Years, Valencia‘s shows were (and are!) packed with energy. It’s a positive energy. I can’t begin to tell you how many times I’ve gone to see a band in concert and the energy from the band and the crowd is negative. Every time I’ve seen them play from basement shows to the TLA and elsewhere, it’s always been a blast seeing these guys live in concert.\n\nOVERALL OPINION: Long live Valencia! There’s always a place in the crowd for you with this band.\n\n8. The Gaslight Anthem\n\nThe Gaslight Anthem were always an excellent show to see in person. The energy, the lights, the sound, the crowd, it was like entering a different world. I only wish that they didn’t go on semi-permanent hiatus. Seriously, Brian Fallon‘s stage presence and command is second to none. I was fortunate enough to see a show during their last reunion tour. It was spectacular; every one was moving or bouncing along to the music and good times were being had.\n\nOVERALL OPINION: The Gaslight Anthem? More like The BOSS-LITE Anthem, amirite? Bruce Springsteen puns aside, The Gaslight Anthem was well worth traveling to New Jersey to see.\n\n9. My Chemical Romance\n\nI get that as I got older, I was “supposed” to age out of enjoying pop punk. But in reality, I never did. Guess it wasn’t just a phase, mom. That said, My Chemical Romance was always a blast to see live in concert. The energy and music just drowning out all of life’s problems for two-plus hours for a night, is an incredible feeling. It was that type of experience I had. There is something about singing along to songs that you can relate to with others in the crowd, is comforting.\n\nOVERALL OPINION: Welcome back, MCR! I expect a sold out Wells Fargo Center or Lincoln Financial Field or Citizens Bank Park.\n\n10. Tommy Conwell and The Young Rumblers\n\nI was definitely one of the youngest people in the crowd at a concert my former elementary school teacher was playing. Who is my former elementary school teacher you may ask, humble reader? None other than Tommy Conwell. The dude had a number 1 Mainstream Rock hit in the late 1980’s, as well as an album that charted on the Billboard 200, oh and two top 100 songs on the Billboard Hot 100 (four top 25 Mainstream Rock songs total). That said, his concerts are a blast and a blast from the past. It’s amazing to see people of all ages, sizes, races, genders, etc. having a damn good time. Conwell can still rock. If you’re looking for maximum fun for your dollar, you can’t go wrong seeing Tommy Conwell play live in concert.\n\nOVERALL OPINION: Everything They Say Is True, Tommy Conwell is a true rocker and showman. Never a disappointed face in the crowd at his shows.\n\nConclusion:\n\nHere are ten of my favorite bands and artists to see live in concerts. Some honorable mentions include: the Foo Fighters, Rise Against, Paramore, Coldplay, Taylor Swift (yes, you read that right… but that is a whole nother story for a whole nother time), Yours Truly, Stand Atlantic, Modern Baseball, Avenged Sevenfold, Linkin Park, Volbeat, Billy Talent, and many more. I realize that I have most local bands and artists on here, but I’ve always been a big proponent of supporting your local artists, bands, and music scene. Of course, when your favorite band from out of town comes into your town, you go and see.\n\nThat said, here’s to being able to see our favorite artists and bands in concert again! \\m/\\m/\n\nGot Social Media?

This week we have a full slate of SIX albums to go through! So here’s a mini-recap before we go into more details… starting on Monday, we heeded the rally cry of the Arkells. On Tuesday, we tried mending our battle scars and broken hearts with Darling Parade. Wednesday, we fought the good fight alongside The Interrupters. Thursday, we discovered ourselves through sister cities and The Wonder Years. Friday, was a cavalcade of music from The Flatliners. Finally, on Saturday, we broke out the Celtic punk with Sir Reg. So without further adieu…\n\nLeading off for The Sounds of Broad Street…\n\nMonday, March 11th 2019\n\nOn day five, we took a road trip up to Hamilton, Ontario, Canada to visit the Arkells and listen to their 2018 album, Rally Cry. If you were looking for the People’s Champ of alternative rock albums, this one’s it. Rally Cry is the Arkells strongest and most consistent album to date. It;s album that stays consistent throughout and stays on point with it’s message. It’s a loaded album that’s stacked with catchy hooks and infectious, sing along choruses. The band throughout the album switches up tempos and mixes genres with relative ease despite a few hiccups here and there. It’s definitely a rally cry of “Arkellian” proportions that is fresh, memorable, and exciting. Check out Rally Cry by the Arkells!\n\nTuesday, March 12th 2019\n\nDay six. We had another entrant into the “Paramore or Not Paramore” game show with Darling Parade‘s Battle Scars and Broken Hearts. Darling parade is band from Music City, USA (aka Nashville, TN), a city that is more known for producing hit country acts. While Battle Scars and Broken Hearts eschews the city’s traditional sound, it doesn’t eschew the traditional themes. It’s an album highlighted by the heavyweight vocals of frontwoman Kristin Kearns. If you are looking for some fun alt-rock that blurs the lines of pop punk and melodic punk, this is the album for you. Check out Battle Scars and Broken Hearts by Darling Parade!\n\nWednesday, March 13th 2019\n\nDay seven. We went the opposite direction of female fronted bands. We delved deep into the punk side of things with The Interrupters‘ Fight the Good Fight. This is album that is fun and brings some much needed into a genre that is mostly negative. At a half hour long, it’s good for multiple plays. The mix of positivity and ferocity that The Interrupters bring to the table with this album is incredible… and much needed. It is all too easy to see why everyone is picking up on this band and you should too. No need to get cynical about that… pick up a copy of this album and see why the hype is real. Check out Fight the Good Fight by The Interrupters!\n\nThursday, March 14th 2019\n\nDay eight. The Wonder Years have been a staple of the Philadelphia music scene for well over a decade plus now. They had/have a very recognizable pop punk sound that many grew to love. But with Sister Cities, the band doesn’t abandon that sound outright, they evolve it. They transform it into a more mature and harder sound. With Sister Cities, the band did what many in the pop punk genre refuse to do: grow up. For 45 minutes we get to share in the experience of mutual growth and experience. It’s an album that highlights a band’s growth for the better. Check out Sister Cities by The Wonder Years!\n\nFriday, March 15th 2019\n\nDay nine. The Flatliners have gone from the musical equivalent of “internet shitposters” to mature musicians with their album Cavalcade. Creating a relatable punk album that appeals to both the die hard and the casual fan is tough. But The Flatliners did that with Cavalcade. It’s a cohesive and consistent album that highlights a band’s efforts to continually develop and hone their skills as musicians. Cavalcade is an album that, quite frankly, puts some of the elder statesmen in the genre to shame. Check out Cavalcade by The Flatliners!\n\nSaturday, March 16th 2019\n\nDay 10. Sir Reg is an anomaly in a genre that is already a niche. Celtic rock/punk is already a niche subgenre. Sir Reg is an anomaly in it because they are from Sweden… well at least four of the musicians in the band are. The frontman is an expatriate from the Republic of Ireland. So I technically guess they are from Ireland as well. Sir Reg‘s 21st Century Loser isn’t it’s namesake at all. In fact, it’s a 21st Century Winner. It’s crystal clear from first listen that this is a band that prides themselves on high quality musicianship. If you are looking for an album that’s something new and don’t want to be overwhelmed, 21st Century Loser is for you. Check out 21st Century Loser by Sir Reg!\n\nAnd of course… here’s the updated playlist for this year’s project!\n\nThe Broad Street Playlist 2019\n\nGot Social Media?

The album was released on June 29th 2018 through Hellcat Records and was produced by Tim Armstrong (of Rancid). The album reached number two on Billboard‘s Independent Albums chart as well as number 141 on the Billboard 200. The track She’s Kerosene reached number four on the United States Alternative Songs chart and number 20 on the United States Hot Rock Songs chart.\n\nThoughts on the album\n\nI have a general music theory about ska and it’s this: ska without horns, is just punk without energy; punk without energy is just rock without passion; and rock without passion is just country music… boring. The Interrupters on the other eschew my theory about ska and ska bands. Especially on their 2018 album, Fight the Good Fight… and right off the bat it’s pure ska, even without the horns. It’s got the trademarked skank (ska upstroke) guitar riffs that create an amazing choppy and bouncy rhythm that is perfect to do the other kind of skanking (the dance). I gotta say, this album brings the noise and the passion. The production is slick and solid and really allows the band to showcase their talents.\n\nFight the Good Fight was produced by punk legend, Tim Armstrong, and boy does he have a magic touch on this album. He created a production that was similar to the band’s previous efforts, but only now it’s sharper and tighter. The beat and rhythm is tighter, the guitars have more bite to them, and generally speaking, the overall feel of the sound is bigger. It makes you want to start circle/mosh pits in the middle of a train car at 9 am. Of course, what good is an album that sounds good, without songs that match? There are some swings-and-misses here. The generic empowering track, Broken World is one of them. Just too generic for me. While I personally love, Got Each Other, it’s more of a “checked swing”. The melody of Got Each Other sticks and the men of Rancid each take a verse on vocals, but it just tries slightly too hard. One of my last criticisms of this album is the number of tracks: 12. Not saying that’s a lot of songs when the total time of the album is 31 minutes long. In fact, for 12 tracks that’s too short. It’s almost like the bite-sized candy you give out on Halloween. The track Leap of Faith is the longest of the album at 3 minutes 17 seconds long. Gave You Everything is second longest at 3 minutes 8 seconds long. Every other track is under three minutes long.\n\nThat said, there are some high flying and heavy hitting tracks. The biggest one of the album is, She’s Kerosene. It’s molten, that’s how incendiary it is. It contains the band’s trademarked ska sound and style with a lot more mixed in… for the better. The vocals take the biggest leap forward, especially during the chorus of this song. Taking an anthemic leap during the chorus, frontwoman Aimee Allen‘s vocals sparkle. The bass line bounces with an extremely swift and complex beat. The guitars mix and match with power chords and classic ska upstrokes that add a measure of character to the song. This is just one example of how the band upped their musicianship game on this album.\n\nBut like I said, one of my favorite things about this album is frontwoman Aimee Allen (Aimee Interrupter) and her vocals. The track Gave You Everything is where she really shines. It’s a track in which you can really hear just how wide her vocal range is. She hits her standard, upbeat and mid-range vocals during the vocals and nails the extremely high notes during the choruses. Now the track Outrage is a track that shows off what the band did right on this album. It’s a melodic and catchy song, whose musicianship is excellent and the vocals are tight. Not to mention it has one of the sickest guitar solos I’ve ever heard with slick pick slides and bends.\n\nConclusion\n\nFight the Good Fight is an incredibly strong album. The Interrupters also bring some welcome uplifting and positivity into a punk community that is almost purely about the negative. While it’s only 30/31 minutes long, it’s one of the strongest half-hours of music you can listen you. This album is so very enjoyable that it’s perfect for back-to-back repeat listens. Fight the Good Fight is a very positive album… something that is much needed in a much maligned music genre and subculture. The mix of positivity and ferocity works excellently despite some swing-and-misses and some checked swings. It’s very easy to see why everyone and their mother are starting to listen and latch on to this band… and it’s also very easy to become cynical about that. Don’t become cynical. Pick up a copy of this album see that the hype about this band is real. There is legitimately (almost) nothing wrong about Fight the Good Fight, that will bring you down.\n\n(Previous Post)\n\nGot Social Media?
