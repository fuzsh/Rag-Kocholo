According to the band’s biographer, Gerard was drunk during the recording of this song so they have a very raw quality.\n\nFrom the first verse, “Desert Song” is a call to empathy for Gerard’s struggles with his addiction and mental health. He uses religious imagery like “the sword and the faith” to describe to difficult nature of touring, recording, playing on television, and dealing with a meteoric rise to fame before closing the verse with the killer line, “And did you come to stare or wash away the blood.” He knows that rock stars’ struggles with addictions can be used for entertainment, whether that’s Behind the Music, the nascent reality television genre (E.g. The Osbournes), or supermarket tabloids.\n\nHowever, Gerard wants his fans and listeners to empathize with him and use My Chemical Romance’s music to help them with their own struggles instead of gawking and laughing at him as he falls down a lot and vomits throughout the Life on the Murder Scene documentary that this song was packaged with. He describes this journey from touring to performing to hitting rock bottom in the poetic bridge of “Desert Song” where he sings “From the lights to the pavement/From the band to the floor/From backstage to the doctor”.\n\nIt’s raw autobiography without any genre fiction or characters to garnish it even though he does comment on MCR’s purpose when he says “From the Earth to the morgue…” Even if it isn’t together, Gerard and My Chemical Romance will continue to make music or art as evidenced by their various side and solo projects since the band’s breakup from The Future Violents and Electric Century to the rad covers that Gerard does with Mikey and Ray Toro for The Umbrella Academy TV show that he consults on and continues to make comics of. There is definitely a feel in “Desert Song” that My Chemical Romance would still exist as a band even if they were just playing basements and small clubs in New Jersey because it’s both an emotional and artistic outlet for the members.\n\nAnd speaking of emotional and artistic outlet, I would like to move the spotlight from Gerard pleading with the microphone, Toro doing little runs on his clean electric guitar, and Frank Iero’s steady acoustic strumming to myself. This project has been like an emotional cleanse for myself during the conclusion of a really difficult semester and time period. Until a couple days ago, I didn’t leave the house (Except for work and essentials.), and this project helped keep me in a good routine and creative state of mind. My Chemical Romance is a really fun band to write about because they have a sound that spans genres as well as a sense of narrative in their songs.\n\nProbably, my favorite part has been doing the background research on Gerard, Mikey, Frank Iero, Ray Toro, Matt Pelissier, Bob Bryar and producers Geoff Rickly and Howard Benson, and seeing how their personalities and interests connect with MCR’s music. Life on the Murder Scene was really a valuable resource and a must-watch for any fan who wants to get insight into the band’s early days. I love how My Chemical Romance discusses topics like grief, relationships, addiction, depression, and yes, death (We’ll see more of that in Black Parade.) using metaphors from literature and pop culture.\n\nIt’s something I do in my own life whether out loud or in my own head, and I think it’s why I really start falling in love with the band around when I started my English major and later my pop culture criticism career around 2011-2013. However, it’s nice to see them drop the theatrical makeup and epic plots and just sing a song about being in a band and their feelings about this in “Desert Song”. The acoustic guitar is a rare treat and a foretaste of the sonic diversity that MCR would display in The Black Parade and Danger Days showing that they weren’t content with chugging out ten of the same kind of song each record, but finding ways to expand their audience’s palettes and even attract new fans. (Danger Days might be the fabled bridge between poptimism and rockism, but we’ll explore that in a much later essay.)\n\n“Desert Song” demonstrates that My Chemical Romance is equally skilled at rockers and ballads as well as genre fiction and personal narratives. The track features some of Gerard’s most compelling vocals and show that Frank Iero is an old hand in the mosh pit as well as as the coffee house. It’s like the old adage that I just invented, “Sometimes, you want to write about vampires, superheroes, and sexy assassins, and sometimes you want to hand your still-beating heart to the audience.”\n\nThe early history of My Chemical Romance is deeply intertwined with The Used a post-hardcore, pop punk band from Utah. The Life on the Murder Scene documentary and several interviews establish the often homoerotic friendship between MCR frontman Gerard Way and The Used lead singer Bert McCracken. My Chemical Romance’s manager Brian Schechter was The Used’s tour manager and had them tour together several times, which built the bond between Gerard and McCracken. Other than their cover of “Under Pressure” by Queen and David Bowie, their final connection was that MCR’s second drummer, Bob Bryar, did sound for The Used while the were on tour.\n\nAround this time, Bert McCracken and Gerard forged a fast, if a little crazy friendship that may have been the inspiration for the lyrics of “You Know What They Do to Guys Like Us in Prison”. McCracken sings backup vocals on that song, but he would take over co-lead vocal duties on “Under Pressure”, which started as a live cover featuring members of The Used and My Chemical Romance. It morphed into a studio recording in 2005, was a part of both the rock and Hot 100 charts, and its proceeds went to a tsunami relief fund. The song was released both as a separate single and as a bonus track of the re-release of The Used’s second, breakthrough album In Love and Death.\n\nMikey Way is relegated to tambourine during the live performance of “Under Pressure” so The Used’s Jeph Howard handles the band’s iconic bassline. Ray Toro, Frank Iero, and Quinn Allman are on guitar while Bob Bryar and Branden Steineckert are on the dueling drum kits. However, this song is really a showcase for Gerard and Bert McCraken’s complementary vocals and general chemistry that can be seen in their offstage joking, and yes, smooches. Freddie Mercury and David Bowie were rock and roll icons to queer kids, outsiders, and misfits in the 1970s and 1980s, and Gerard Way and Bert McCracken played the role in the 21st century and cemented it in “Under Pressure”, which features what producer Howard Benson said were some of Gerard’s best vocals ever.\n\nGerard definitely hits the high notes in “Under Pressure”, and his performance is soaked with emotion. Blending nicely with these vocals is McCracken, who even though The Used is classified by some as a screamo band, sings in a smooth, warm tone to match Gerard’s energy as he hits the final part of the song and starts screaming while Toro, Iero, and Allman’s guitars get epic. It really feels like Gerard and McCracken are trying to outdo each other vocally, and it captures the fun and “jamming good with Weird and Gilly” (Had to throw in a Bowie reference.) feel of the live version.\n\nMy Chemical Romance and The Used’s cover of bisexual smash hit “Under Pressure” is a worthy homage to two of MCR’s greatest influences, David Bowie and Queen, and is a set-in-wax time capsule of the relationship between Gerard Way and Bert McCracken as they supported each other in their early days of fame.\n\nThis version of “Under Pressure” is also for charity and great to sing at karaoke too! Sometimes, in the midst of crafting complex concept albums, it’s nice to just rock out to you favorite songs with your friends, who happen to be multi-platinum recording artists. Now kiss!\n\n“I took Punk to be the detonation of some slow-fused projectile buried deep in society’s flank a decade earlier, and I took it to be, somehow, a sign.”-William Gibson in A Cultural Dictionary of Punk: 1974-1982\n\nAs a rule, My Chemical Romance didn’t play a lot of covers, but when they did, they were homages to artists that were major influences on the band’s sound and lyrics. For example, in 2005, they contributed a cover of “Astro Zombies” by fellow-New Jerseyans and horror punk band Misfits to the Tony Hawk’s American Wasteland soundtrack. The cool thing about the American Wasteland soundtrack was that it featured contemporary punk bands covering classic ones like The Stooges, Black Flag, Bad Brains, The Buzzcocks, and of course, The Misfits. Also, the album cover was an homage to London Calling by The Clash, but with a skateboarder, of course, showing the timeless connection between skating and punk rock.\n\nAlso, while doing research for this essay, I found out that the first two Tony Hawk Pro Skater games (Which I pray every day will be remastered for the Nintendo Switch.) were integral to MCR building chemistry in their early days as a band and perhaps even responsible for Frank Iero joining the band. In an interview with Loudwire, Gerard Way talks about the game “connected us on a social level”, and that they had been playing Tony Hawk for several years before the formation of My Chemical Romance. At that time, they also shared a practice space with Iero’s band Pencey Prep and would play against their members. I’m definitely speculating, but without the Tony Hawk game, Frank Iero might have never joined MCR and made their punk influences more pronounced with his rhythm guitar playing and backup vocals.\n\nMy Chemical Romance’s cover of “Astro Zombies” is very faithful to the Misfits’ original from their 1982 debut album They Walk Among Us, except with cleaner production values and Ray Toro getting to bust out a mini solo during the outro. Gerard even channels the tenor part of Glenn Danzig’s vocal register. Iero’s rhythm guitar playing is very prominent during the verses and the catchy, Ramones-esque chorus of “All I want to say/And all I gotta do” while Mikey Way and new drummer Bob Bryar keeps the rhythm section, fast and loose.\n\nWhile MCR was influenced by the Misfits’ heavy, yet melodic punk sound, they were probably more influenced by the subject matter of their songs. “Astro Zombies” gets its title from a 1968 B-movie of the same title about a scientist, who was fired by the government’s space department, so he creates zombies out of murder victims, who go on a rampage. The Astro-Zombies was shot in 2 weeks on a $37,000 budget, and like all good B movies, it was panned by critics. But it achieved a kind of immortality by being the inspiration for this great 1980s punk single that became a great 2000s punk single whose lyrics are the plot of the film aka “Prime directive, exterminate the whole human race.”\n\nThrough songs, albums, and a record label named and based on their favorite horror and exploitation movies, the Misfits helped cement a template for artists to use their favorite pieces of pop culture as the subject matter of their music. My Chemical Romance would definitely follow this template with songs about vampires, zombies, assassins, bisexual prisoners, and Western gunslingers appearing in their first two records alone. Then, with Black Parade and Danger Days, they wouldn’t just sing and play as these characters, but become them.\n\nHowever, sometimes MCR would take a break from red and black formalwear or the marching band uniforms to play songs by bands that they love like “Astro Zombies” by The Misfits. Now, excuse me, I’m going to be humming this song under my breath the entire Thanksgiving dinner\n\n“The stars move still, time runs, the clock will strike/The devil will come, and Faustus must be damn’d.”-Faustus in The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus by Christopher Marlowe\n\nMy Chemical Romance wraps up their second (and breakthrough) album Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge with the ode to hitmen and doomed heroes and heroines that is “I Never Told You What I Do for a Living”. The track also concludes Three Cheers‘ story arc with the protagonist going from looking forward to a reunion with his lover to descending into Hell during a chaotic Ray Toro and Frank Iero guitar-driven breakdown part. Gerard Way screams like a bat out of hell while Matt Pelissier and Mikey Way play out his fall.\n\nWith its subject matter and even its sprawling, multi-part structure, “Living” definitely evokes shades of Bullets‘ album closer, “Demolition Lovers”. However, like the other songs on Three Cheers, Howard Benson brought discipline and focus to MCR’s initial posthardcore sound and emotionally vulnerable lyrics and makes the ending of this record very satisfying. He knows when to unleash Iero’s punk energy, when to lay back and let Ray Toro noodle a little bit in the spaces between the sounds, and matches it nicely to Gerard’s powerhouse vocals and Pelissier and Mikey’s rhythm section.\n\nFrank Iero is like the meter of a poem keeping the verses and storyline running at a steady clip. He and Mikey demonstrate good chemistry during the first post-chorus part where Gerard reveals the ending of the story and softly sings, “And never again, and never again, they gave us two shots to the back of the head, and we’re all dead now.” It’s the buildup to the crescendo as Toro’s clean strumming and Pelissier’s percussion jump into the mix as Gerard’s vocals get more raw, and the lyrics go from hook-filled to pure feeling as he yelps, “I tried”.\n\n“I tried” is definitely a callback to “Demolition Lovers”, which is all about the protagonist and his lover getting gunned down. This leads to the infamous deal with the devil for 1,000 souls so he can be reunited with her. It’s also a great way to describe the underlying theme of “Living” and Three Cheers as a whole. As evidenced by the guilt-ridden lyrics, violent imagery, and of course, heavy sound of the album, the protagonist did everything in his power to be reunited with his lover. However, he should have read Doctor Faustus or Macbeth, which this song directly references (“The kind of dirty where the water never cleans off the clothes.”), or really any vengeance-driven tragedy to know what was in store for him. (The Romans loved them.)\n\nSo, the big ending to the Three Cheers‘ storyline is that after killing 999 souls, the protagonist must kill one final evil soul: himself. This was confirmed in a 2004 interview with Gerard although he didn’t have an ending in mind while recording the album. The protagonist falls into this Atreid (The ancient Greek family, not the one from Dune, which I’ve never read or watched.) cycle of constant revenge that can only be broken with his own death and damnation. He tells himself that he is just doing it for the woman he loves, but he ends up being addicted to the “bodies he claim” so he doesn’t get a happy ending.\n\nAnd in a just, moral universe, he really shouldn’t even though it’s kind of sad that a character we’ve kind of been rooting for throughout Three Cheers doesn’t achieve happiness. Although, this concept album is ostensibly about two lovers trying to be reunited with each other, it’s really about a man’s descent from being a good, decent person into being wholly consumed by revenge like Edmond Dantes, V from V for Vendetta, or even some incarnations of Gerard’s favorite superhero, Batman. “Living’s” lyrics echo this sentiment with lines like “I fall out of grace” and the slightly more erotic “… I’m so dirty, babe”.\n\nThe protagonist has taken so many lives that he’s beyond any kind of redemption, and you can definitely feel this in Gerard’s vocals throughout “Living”. His voice howls, wails, and general flows with the squeal of Ray Toro’s lead guitar and descends into bloodcurdling screams during the aforementioned epic breakdown where Frank Iero’s rhythm playing takes center stage. Like Faustus, the protagonist pleads for another night away from damnation, either to bring even more souls to the devil or just to spend one last day with his lover before he’s in Hell for all eternity. Later, Toro starts playing the song’s melody line, which allows for extra anguish and what Genius.com calls an ad-lib part from Gerard as he wrings every ounce of emotion out from the lyrics.\n\n“I Never Told You What I Do for a Living” is a darkly poetic ending to the story and album of Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge. My Chemical Romance is totally synced up and focused with each member getting a key moment like an actor stealing a scene in an epic film. It also features an utterly tragic vocal performance from Gerard, who is free to “strut and fret his hour upon stage” and tell a heartbreaking story while Ray Toro, Frank Iero, Mikey, and Matt Pelissier shred and play their hearts out.\n\nMCR makes music for rocking out and bawling your eyes out (Sometimes at the same time.) Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge album cemented this reputation while also introducing the band to a wider audience. MCR’s sound, storyline, and visual image would only get more complex and theatrical while making damn good songs, which I will touch upon in my upcoming coverage of the legendary Black Parade album.\n\nDon’t worry, I’ll be covering a couple 2005-2006 era B-sides and rarities first so you’ll have a few days to dust off your old drums and marching band uniform.\n\n“Oh, I used to write a lot of sad ass songs.”– Dolly Parton in Dolly Parton’s America podcast\n\nContent warning: alcoholism, drug addiction, suicide, self-harm\n\nIn “Cemetery Drive”, My Chemical Romance follows the tried and true soft verse and loud chorus structure to spin a tale of grief and loss. However, they switch up the instrumentation that drives each part of the song like a superhero team comic (E.g. JLA, written by Gerard Way inspiration Grant Morrison) where the writer splits a squad into groups to give them more of a character-driven focus while solving a big crisis.\n\nSo, this song starts with a drum intro from Matt Pelissier, and his percussion along with Mikey Way’s bass and Ray Toro’s pluck-y picking drive the verses. Then, Frank Iero and Toro’s bigger, louder guitars drive chorus while Mikey gets in a little more of a groove. During the post-chorus “Way down” part, Gerard hits one of his signature wail parts like someone mourning their lover as Iero plays a downbeat rhythm riff like a grave being dug. With the raw lyrics and guitar part, the emotions bleed into the sound.\n\nPelissier’s funereal drum and Toro’s clean guitar picking plus a bonus bell sound from Howard Benson’s keyboard really focus your attention on Gerard’s vocals and “Cemetery Drive’s” lyrics. He juxtaposes the death of his lover with the grief he feels and tries to cope with by singing depressing songs and drinking by her gave. We know that he’s drinking alone because he “…walk[s] the dead in a solitary style.” Even though MCR is telling the story of Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge‘s protagonist’s internal motivation for taking 1,000 souls to be reunited with his wife, there could be a bit of autobiography in this one because Gerard had a problem with alcoholism around the time of the making of this album and the subsequent, extensive tours the band did after to promote it.\n\nAs mentioned in some earlier essays, Gerard talks about his drinking (That would later lead to cocaine use) in the documentary Life on the Murder Scene with the help of his manager Brian Schechter as well as in a frank 2005 cover story interview with Spin. To get in the mood to play such a dark character as the protagonist of Three Cheers, Gerard “…would drink from when [he] woke up until set time” and even wore his red, black, and leather costume plus the corpse paint makeup off-stage.\n\nThe interview and lots of information about Gerard cast him as a introverted comic book artist before he became My Chemical Romance’s frontman. Therefore, it makes sense that the insane stress of dealing with his grandmother’s death (The inspiration for “Helena”), the intense and theatrical nature of touring, and getting into such a dark character’s headspace wore on him. Gerard turned to drugs and booze to cope until Schechter staged a couple interventions after he had suicidal thoughts after doing cocaine at pre-fame Killers show and vomiting for 45 minutes after a bender before a big show in Japan.\n\nI’ve given these biographical details because “Cemetery Drive” seems like it’s not just Gerard and MCR sketching a character and his motivation. They’re also putting some of their own demons and inner feelings onto the track trapped in the wax like a jinn in a bottle and “singing songs that make you slit your wrists.” The verses might have a softer sounder, but they deal with some dark subject matter that could be about the protagonist facing death to take out the souls, MCR struggling while on tour (Gerard’s intro to the live version of this song alludes to this interpretation.) , and the agelong question of whether humans get what we deserve in the end.\n\nThree Cheers’ protagonist’s grief for the woman he lost soars into the chorus along with Gerard’s powerful tenor voice, Mikey’s louder-in-the-mix bass, and Frank Iero’s guitars. “Cemetery Drive’s” chorus is simple and raw: a simple “I miss you” with the lyric “the collision of your kiss” hinting at the intense and passionate relationship of the two lovers as well as the suddenness of our protagonist’s partner’s passing. Gerard really holds those notes and vocals to accentuate the feeling, and it definitely feels more like an acting performance than a rocker singing a sad ballad. There’s no distance between the character and performer, and interviews, like the aforementioned Spin one, and other during the Three Cheers seem to confirm this as Gerard’s method acting approach to recording this album and playing it live took a toll on him.\n\nReading about and watching Gerard’s addiction is super sad, and I’m glad that he got help, became sober, and is a happy, comic book writer and father now. However, “Cemetery Drive” is a marker of darker times for him, and My Chemical Romance, who underwent a lot of turmoil in this era as they went from playing basements in New Jersey to going on big domestic and international tours thanks to the commercial success of Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge. Part of that success came this catchy soft/loud Howard Benson sound that still gave a chance for Gerard, Mikey, Ray Toro, Frank Iero, and Matt Pelissier to showcase their unique skill sets as well as lyrics that anyone who has struggled with losing someone, depressions, or any kind of addiction could relate to.\n\n“Cemetery Drive” doesn’t provide any answers to these issues, but it did show that someone else was going through them too.\n\n“For some folks death is release, and for others death is an abomination, a terrible thing. But in the end, I’m there for all of them.”- Death of the Endless in Sandman, written by Neil Gaiman\n\n“It’s Not a Fashion Statement, It’s a Deathwish” is both mine and Gerard Way’s favorite track off Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge. And that monster Ray Toro intro guitar riff plus the quote from my favorite arc of Sandman, “Brief Lives” (Think American Gods with less padding and gorgeous Jill Thompson artwork.) were what got me to fall in love with it. According to Gerard on Twitter, this was one of the first songs My Chemical Romance recorded for Three Cheers. This is why (Even more so than “Hang ‘Em High”) it feels like a kind of intermediate stage of evolution between MCR’s sound in Bullets and Three Cheers. It’s like a musical Wartortle.\n\nHowever, this isn’t a bad thing as Toro and Frank Iero play heavy and loud with no time for solos or pretty instrumental breaks, and Gerard goes into the scream register of his vocals, which is why he said that this is a difficult song to play live for him. It definitely feels like he’s wrestling with the Grim Reaper and not the kind, Goth woman version of Death from Sandman, whom he quotes in the opening lines of the song and states the fact that we basically only have a single life to live so make it count. (I was so close to writing “Yolo”.)\n\nAs a Sandman and MCR fan, the harshness of the quoted line gave me pause because Death of the Endless is portrayed as sweet and kind in the comic. Throughout the series, you see her make the process of dying as natural and painless as possible unless you’re a really messed up person. However, Gerard’s vocal delivery corresponds with the storyline of Three Cheers, which is the story of a man that defies death to be with the woman he loves.\n\nThis also connects to the title of the song, which is also a cheeky jab at emo/scene style as well. (Maybe, Goth because all-black and Death of the Endless.) The protagonist of Three Cheers wears dark colors, not because he want to be a cool kid, but for stealth purposes because if he rocked florals, then his soul would be taken, not vice versa. “It’s Not A Fashion Statement, It’s a Deathwish” also connects to another theme of the record: grief and loss. Black is the color of mourning, and Gerard and Mikey Way had lost their grandma, hence, a funeral music video for “Helena” and the black and red formal wear like they’re attending one. (It also matches the color palette of the album art, but they, there’s layers to this.)\n\nThis song is about defying death and taking revenge, but there is also a weird sense of hope throughout the song from Gerard’s vow “to avenge my ghost” and the line “I’m taking back the life you stole.” He’s addressing the Death personally and saying that he can cheat them (Or her if we’re doing the Sandman.) if he kills enough evil doers. During the chill bridge part toward the end where Iero’s guitar is meditative for once, there are even lyrics about clawing out of one’s grave.\n\n“Fashion Statement” was written early in the Three Cheers so that line could have been treating like a big opening scene in a horror or revenge film. The protagonist was killed at the end of “Demolition Lovers”, but he’s back for vengeance in the sequel even if everything has changed. A parallel for me would be Buffy’s resurrection in Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Six when she gets back not quite correctly in a magic rite performed by Willow. The protagonist certainly doesn’t live a happy, normal life, but a dark, violent. However, he experiences such hardships that “paint these walls pitchfork red” for a chance to be with the person he cares most about.\n\nAll in All, “Fashion Statement” is like the angsty teenage years of My Chemical Romance before they went off to college in Three Cheers, got their doctorate in Black Parade, and published an off-beat, yet compelling monograph in Danger Days with Conventional Weapons acting as peer-reviewed articles to enhance their profile. (I work in academia so bear with me.) It has that DIY, Eyeball Records feel, but you can tell that Howard Benson directed the band to center the track around that iconic Ray Toro and Frank Iero riff before cutting them loose to do their revenge/romance/stare down Death storyline.\n\nThere is a real story arc to this song culminating in a sweet “fade-out” outro where the protagonist understands that he’ll be with his lover even if he fails his mission because he himself will be dead. Like the folks that Death visits in Sandman and her two solo comics, he relents and gives into the “sound of her wings” because he knows he will have rest and peace after his hard, dramatic life.\n\n“It’s a hell of a thing, killing a man. You take away everything he’s got, and everything he’s ever gonna have.”– Bill Munny (Played by Clint Eastwood) in Unforgiven, written by David Peoples\n\nEnnio Morricone meets I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love in “Hang ‘Em High”. This is My Chemical Romance’s take on the spaghetti Western genre and also revisits their raw posthardcore sound from their previous record with a distortion-filled guitar break from Ray Toro and Frank Iero and screamed vocals from Gerard Way. And the proverbial cherry on this punk rock sundae is that Keith Morris, the frontman of Black Flag, contributed backup screams on the bridge and outro. Iero got him to appear on the song by cornering him at a gas station, which is punk as fuck.\n\nThe sound and lyrics of “Hang ‘Em High” complement each other nicely even if the structure of the song is looser than the hookier one on Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge. Mikey Way’s bass sounds like the rumble of cattle being driven to the next, and Matt Pelissier’s drums are the plod of their hooves. Toro and Iero’s guitars are a bit faster like cowboys galloping into the sunset as the credits “fade to black”. The fuzzy noise and effects from these guitars are like the extra violence and buckets of blood in Sergio Corbucci’s (Django) Westerns. Or to use a more musical reference, Toro’s guitar is like the guitars in the music from the Dollars trilogy, but a little more heavy metal while Frank Iero contributes fast, jagged riffs.\n\nHowever, the chorus takes a clearer sound as Gerard articulates his feelings from the perspective of Three Cheers’ protagonist. (Take it from this Unforgiven fan, revenge and Westerns go together like peanut butter and jelly.) He tells his lover that if he fails to get the appropriate number of souls, it’s okay to move on with her life, bury the past, and “don’t look back”. Conversely, the protagonist is also a bit of a hypocrite because he “won’t stop” and “put it down” and will keep murdering the “shotgun sinners” and “wild-eyed jokers” that populate this album until he is reunited with her. Death is not the end for him, and he will never find peace or move on.\n\nTo circle back to Unforgiven, (“Hang ‘Em High” takes it name from a much earlier Clint Eastwood Western.) Three Cheers’ protagonist has lived a life of violence and can agree with Bill Munny that “We all have it comin’ kid.” The stylized language of “Hang ‘Em High” and anguish and venom in Gerard’s vocals definitely paint a picture of an old gunslinger, who’s made enemies, seen some shit, and is ready to take all those sons of bitches with him on the way to Hell. And when he arrives, he hopefully will be reunited with the woman he love because unlike Eastwood, MCR doesn’t shy away from the star-crossed romance goodness.\n\n“Hang ‘Em High” is a faster, louder Western that conveys the storyline of Three Cheers in under three minutes with genre trappings that fit its theme. It features some wonderful production flourishes from Howard Benson like the cinematic whistles that transition directly into Ray Toro and Frank Iero’s speed-playing and adding Morris to the vocal mix to make everything rawer and more intense. The song doesn’t have a clean outro like most of the other tracks on this record, but ends in a cacophony of gunfire, er, guitar noise.\n\n“I’m free to be whatever I choose, and I’ll sing the blues if I want.”-“Whatever” by Oasis\n\nEven though it was only released as a single in the U.K. where it charted at #71, “Thank You for the Venom” has truly become a fan favorite My Chemical Romance. Kerrang listed it at #2 on their list of best MCR songs, it was included in the setlist for their 2019 Los Angeles reunion gig, and Alt Press put it on their list of best guitar riffs of the 2000s. And that monster Ray Toro riff is one of many reasons why we’re still geeking out over this song 16 years after its release.\n\nA great guitar riff skips the brain and goes straight to your heart and soul. Hence, all the involuntary responses to one like humming along (Very badly in my case), head banging, and of course, air guitar, which is something Gerard Way has done in live performances of this song during Toro’s solo. The intro of “Thank You for the Venom” also shows the killer chemistry between Toro and rhythm guitarist Frank Iero with Toro playing the fast, melodic parts and Iero dropping the hammer with the heavy bits before Mikey Way’s bass and Matt Pelissier’s drum kit kick in. Also, this riff is so iconic that it returns for a few seconds during the outro to symmetrically round out the song.\n\nI could go on all day about Toro and Iero’s playing, but “Thank You for the Venom” also has incredible, basically band-defining lyrics for My Chemical Romance and reinforces that they both transcend the emo scene and are a life saving band. Speaking of the life saving, it’s fitting that Gerard plays with a Morrissey song lyric in this track’s first line, singing “Sister, I’m not much a poet, but a criminal.” As a member of MCR, Gerard might write poetic lyrics that you want to get tattooed on your skin forever, but playing the protagonist of Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge, he’s a murderer even if he only kills evil people and is motivated by the loss of the woman he loves. (It’s really fitting that “Jack the Ripper” by Morrissey is the B-side of this single because it’s also sung from the POV of a less sympathetic murderer.)\n\n“Thank You for the Venom” is filled with these theatrical, concept album elements, especially when My Chemical Romance continues to run with the religious imagery from “Interlude”. In the second verse, MCR throws in three, maybe four Biblical references to the curse of Cain, Mark of the Beast, the serpent in the Garden of Eden, and possibly even the crucifixion. This symbolism has been used everywhere from Beowulf and the poems of Lord Byron to Vampire the Masquerade, and of course, Iron Maiden, who were a big influence on MCR, both sonically and lyrically.\n\nThe images paint a picture of a protagonist, who has been screwed over by a higher power with the loss of the woman he loved, and now he has to “Hallelujah, lock and load” and shoot his way out of everything with his trusty handgun. (It’s fitting that the next track on the album is the Western-inspired “Hang ‘Em High”) The cracks are starting to show, and the protagonist is beginning to doubt that he will complete his mission and be reunited by his lover as evidenced by the line, “You’re running after something you’ll never kill.”\n\nThe protagonist thinks that he’ll be like Cain, the first murderer in the Old Testament, and will be forced to hopelessly wander the Earth with a mark on his forehead that protects him from harm, but reminds everyone he comes into contact with that he introduced the taking of human life into the world. Or he will be a symbol for the end of the world, like the Beast of Revelation. (And be fodder for conspiracy theories and justification for bigotry for millennia.) From what I’m saying about Three Cheers‘ protagonist and storyline, “Venom” seems like a song about hopelessness. However, when viewed in the light of the context of My Chemical Romance as a band and their impact on the rock and emo scenes, it is actually hopeful (and a bit cheeky.)\n\nMCR directly addresses the critics, “the rock establishment” (Whatever the hell that’s supposed to be.), and the bands that they’ve been lumped in with and compared to in “Thank You For the Venom”. “I won’t front the scene if you paid me” shows that despite their commercial success that they want to be something more than the “saviors of rock music” or the band that got emo on MTV. (This is explored in a 2004 interview that has great insight about My Chemical Romance’s early days.) They don’t want to make the same record every time or have the same imagery, and MCR would follow up on this promise with the vastly different sounds and looks of The Black Parade and Danger Days. (I mean, look at Gerard going from black to white to red hair color.)\n\nTheir appearances on Emo Nite playlists aside, My Chemical Romance never wanted to be a nostalgia act, but an artist like The Smiths, Queen, or hell, even Iron Maiden (See the popularity of classic metal bands in the E-girl subculture.) , who transcend scenes and boundaries and had an impact on their listeners. When “Venom” is played live, there’s kind of a call and response between Gerard and audience on the line “Give me a reason to believe.” Going back to the early days of the band and its roots in the tragedy of 9/11, MCR was formed so Gerard could really have something to live for and share that with others, and Mikey, Ray Toro, Frank Iero, and Matt Pelissier bought in to this as well. (See Toro and Iero’s backup vocals at the end of the song combined with their guitar playing to create a full, rich sound.)\n\n“Venom’s” chorus could be read to be about addiction again, and I definitely think the line about the “doctor” is about Gerard’s use of anti-depressants before he became addicted to alcohol, pills, and later cocaine. But I think it’s a more positive message with My Chemical Romance acting as a kind of “sin-eater” (Ooh, more religious imagery.) to their listeners and giving them an opportunity to feel less alone and like outsiders through their music.\n\nBecause if you can believe in My Chemical Romance and their cathartic and honestly life changing music (Plus cool guitars.), maybe one day you’ll be able to believe in yourself. (I keep telling myself that.)\n\n“How long to sing this song.”- “40” by U2 from War\n\nWhen I initially plotted out the Disenchanted series, I planned on combining “Interlude” and “Thank You for the Venom” into essay. But, then, I may have semi-collapsed under the stress of writing 19 essays in 19 days plus comic book reviews and Mandalorian recaps, and did I mention that I have a full time job as an academic librarian in the middle of a pandemic. So, for the good of everyone, I decided to split “Interlude” and “Thank You for the Venom” into two essays, vibe out, and gather my thoughts about this stripped down 57 second track of mournful Gerard Way vocals, Ray Toro picking, and darker strumming from Frank Iero.\n\nMy Chemical Romance dips back into the Catholic iconography in “Interlude”, and this song takes the form of a brief prayer. The protagonist appeals to “saints”, “angels of the Lord”, and “angels of the unknown” to protect the woman he loves while he continues on his mission to take 1,000 souls and be reunited with her like the blood-stained lovers on the cover of the Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge album. He wants some higher power to have his back while he does unconscionable deeds.\n\nIt reminds me a lot of the first present-day scene in Daredevil Season 1, Episode 1 where Matt Murdock tells his priest, “I’m not seeking penance for what I’ve done. I’m asking forgiveness for what I’m about to do. Yeah, Catholic confession doesn’t work that way, but Murdock like Three Cheers’ protagonist already knows that his actions will create grief and trauma for him. Also, Gerard is totally a Daredevil fan as evidenced by a really sad tweet from 2016 about losing a friend, who introduced the character to him.\n\nDaredevil truly is the urban vigilante with Catholic guilt. Just like MCR with “Helena”, some of his most emotional moments happen in churches. These include being nursed by his long lost mother-turned-nun Maggie in the famous Frank Miller/David Mazzucchelli (A professor at Gerard’s alma mater, School of Visual Arts) “Born Again” arc, or when he watched Bullseye kill his love, Karen Page, in Kevin Smith and Joe Quesada’s “Guardian Devil”. Ultraviolence, dead women showing up in their stories, and dark imagery are something that the Man without Fear and My Chemical Romance draw on and sometimes even poke fun of. (Bits of the Mark Waid run, “Vampire Money”)\n\nSo, “Interlude” is a kind of mental break before the main character does acts of violence as well as a chance for MCR to show their softer side before immediately launching into the speed punk of “Thank You for the Venom”. Honestly, we needed the break after tracks about the loss of a relative, being abused in prison, mass murder, addiction, and just missing someone you love. It’s like taking a drag on a cigarette (or a sip on a Diet Mountain Dew like yours truly) after a long day at work and preps listeners for the aggression (and fun genre pastiches) of the back half of Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge.\n\nI think the message of “Interlude” is that it’s okay to not always be in control, and you and call on a higher power for help even if faith is like a fuzzy spiritual connection (i.e. “unknown angel”) and not something that completely rules your life. Also, you can break down the big Homewrecker burrito of an essay into two manageable ones because with their storytelling chops and large reference pool, it’s easy to delve deep into a My Chemical Romance track even if it’s less than a minute long and only features Gerard, Ray Toro, and Frank Iero. (Honestly, that lineup sounds a lot like Gerard’s recent solo songs/covers to promote the Umbrella Academy television show.)\n\n“People think it’s all about misery and desperation and death and all that shite, which is not to be ignored. But what they forget is the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn’t do it. After all, we’re not fucking stupid.“- Mark Renton (played by Ewan McGregor) in Trainspotting, written by John Hodge\n\nContent warning: drugs, addiction, suicide\n\nAfter back-to-back hit singles, Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge takes a little break for producer Howard Shore’s Hammond organ intro and the steady buildup of Matt Pelissier’s drums in “The Jetset Life is Gonna Kill You.” With references to cocaine, “prescription”, hotels, and Russian roulette, I (and Genius.com) think this song is about My Chemical Romance members’ struggles with addictions to alcohol, cocaine, and pills, most notably, frontman Gerard Way and his brother, bassist Mikey Way. This is chronicled in the documentary Life on the Murder Scene, a book about MCR by Tom Bryant, and in various interviews over the years.\n\nAnd using the metaphor of a toxic relationship, Gerard lays it all bare in “The Jetset Life is Gonna Kill You”, whose title connects to the reason he started drinking and taking pills in the first life: to cope with the stress and anxiety of being on tour and performing on stage every night. This is why the song starts to swell with Ray Toro and Frank Iero’s guitars as he sings about buying the “last line” and then giving himself the motivational speech of “give up, get down, it’s the hardest part of living.” That chorus especially hits on the difficulty of living with an addiction and is like when Gerard almost brought no luggage on MCR’s Japanese tour because he thought he would take his own life. He drank a lot of sake, felt very sick, and had suicidal thoughts, which led to him getting help when he got back to the states.\n\nBack in New Jersey, the therapist told Gerard that his issue was differentiating his real personality from the characters he played in the songs on Bullets and Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge, who I’ve sketched in this previous essay and include vampires, zombie attack survivors, assassins, prison brawl starters, and even decadent rock stars. (There’s also the little boy who misses his grandma because “Helena” is the best.) You can definitely see these blurred lines in “The Jetset Life” like the lyric (Memorably delivered in dramatic Spanish by Gerard) about “Hotel Bella Muerte”, which could be the assassin protagonist of Three Cheers bunking up after a night of taking souls, a place to do drugs, or an image of “beautiful death”.\n\n“The Jetset Life” is filled with countless examples of imagery with double and triple meaning, all pertaining to death, addiction, and Three Cheers’ protagonist hitting yet another bump in his road to be reunited with the woman he loves. The dense lyrics complement the song’s hard-charging chorus and a musically interesting bridge with Benson’s keyboard playing layered over Toro and Iero’s guitars, Pelissier and Mikey’s stable rhythm section, and finally Gerard’s lullaby vocals.\n\nFor a second, the keyboards and Mikey’s bass are the only instruments you can hear as My Chemical Romance channels the sadness of Joy Division albeit with a less pronounced lead line. It shows that MCR is sneakily making strides with their sounds while digging into the saddest and darkest parts of their band members’ lives and personalities. They’re not to the synth sounds of Danger Days just yet, but as horror film aficionados, they know a good organ or minor piano can add tension or make the hairs stand up on the back of your neck. However, there aren’t any zombies or vampires in this song just the real life pain of addiction and the fear of withdrawal.\n\nObviously (and from its title alone), “The Jetset Life” isn’t a pro-drug. It’s also not an after school special, but it’s an almost handheld camera-documentary glimpse into plain and pleasure of addiction with some dramatic flourishes. These flourishes, whether lyrical or sonic, are similar to the glam and Brit pop needle drops in the Scottish heroin addiction film Trainspotting whose “vibe” Gerard and Mikey mentioned liking in Life on the Murder Scene. The incorporation of organ, cool Frank Iero guitar riffs, and again, the way Gerard says “Hotel Bella Muerte” add complexity to the addiction narrative as well as a release for the pain he and Mikey are feeling.\n\n“The Jetset Life is Gonna Kill You” is an intimate look at Gerard and Mikey Way’s struggles with addiction while also introducing an intriguing keyboard/bass sound to their punk-meets-classic rock repertoire. The track uses lavish metaphor to explore things like suicidal thoughts, and even though, it’s not a hopeful song per se, it is refreshing to know that your heroes have gone through similar struggles as you.\n\n“Now dry your eyes, and let’s go home.”- Dr. Manhattan in Watchmen by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons\n\nAfter the high octane energy of “I’m Not Okay”, My Chemical Romance slow things down a little bit with the track that follows it: the ballad “The Ghost of You”. “The Ghost of You” also got released as the final single from Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge and did well on the charts hitting #84 on the US Billboard Hot 100, #38 on Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks, and #9 on Alternative Songs while topping the UK’s Rock and Metal singles chart. This was also due to another ambitious music video from Marc Webb, who transposed the track’s heart-rending lyrics and swaying intro to a World War II setting and used the brotherly relationship between Gerard and Mikey Way to break viewers and listeners’ hearts over and over again.\n\n“I’m Not Okay” was all about slice of life and interpersonal relationships whereas “The Ghost of You” gets back to Three Cheers concept album storyline with a spectral, clean guitar intro from Ray Toro. In the first verse, which features a Mikey bass line that makes “The Ghost of You” the perfect slow dance, Gerard muses about reunited with the woman he loves beyond the grave. This is a theme that has been explored throughout Three Cheers, especially in “Helena”, and the protagonist takes a break from burning down hotels, escaping prison, and not feeling okay to ponder how alone he feels and if he’ll see his lost partner again.\n\nThis kind of deep thinking extends to the reference where “The Ghost of You” got its title from, which is the tag line of the Nostalgia perfume owned by Adrian Veidt aka Ozymandias from Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons seminal comic Watchmen. Gerard did a 2008 interview with MTV where he extoled his love for the comic (See, you can like Grant Morrison and Alan Moore.) and talked about making a special exception and having MCR cover “Desolation Row” for the end credits of the 2009 Watchmen film. As the “smartest man alive”, Veidt is about higher level thinking, and this extends to his business dealings where he uses folks’ feelings for the “simpler” times of the 1940s and 1950s to make them long for a perfume that helps them to escape from a time where Richard Nixon is basically president for life and (anti)heroes fall from skyscrapers. However, this ad also has a macabre side with “ghost” hinting at someone in the relationship either having died or left the other one.\n\nMy Chemical Romance paid homage to this by setting their music video for “The Ghost of You” during the 1940s, having the band play soldiers, and showing the “good old days” were actually damn sad like the implications of Adrian Veidt’s advertisement. (Gerard and Ray Toro had to cut their hair.) But crewcuts, vintage instruments, and USO shows aside, this war-themed video heightens “The Ghost of You’s” themes of loss and grief and is perfectly synced to the song’s sound and lyrics. For example, every time Gerard’s harsher vocals, Toro and Frank Iero’s heavier guitars, and Matt Pelissier’s more intense percussion, director Marc Webb cuts from the USO show to the beach landing at Normandy a la Saving Private Ryan. (Gerard, Mikey, and Toro should wave to my great grandpa.)\n\nIn a climactic moment of the video, the waves of the English Channel even wash over the dance floor, which is a win for the visual effects team. MCR and Webb use war as a metaphor for grief and having someone cut away from you prematurely, which is what happened to the protagonist of Three Cheers‘ storyline as well as Gerard and Mikey with their grandmother. It also happens in “The Ghost of You” video where Mikey is killed in front of Gerard with Ray Toro (Playing a medic) desperately trying to save him. The feeling of grief and loss is palpable in Gerard’s face, and his sad eyes while wearing his combat helmet are the last shot of the film, which is only about three minutes long, but feels like one of those two and a half our war epics that my dad is into.\n\n“The Ghost of You” shows that My Chemical Romance could convey great feeling both in their music and on the visual side with their videos. Their World War II-themed video (And honestly “Helena” and “I’m Not Okay” too) showed that the band cared a lot about image and storytelling as well as writing great songs. It would set the stage for even more ambitious work in The Black Parade where MCR would dress and pretend to be another band and Danger Days, which had multiple Gerard-penned and designed comics to flesh out that storyline. They could channel the grief, pain, and at times, angst of other emo, pop punk, and posthardcore bands, but My Chemical Romance did it while telling a story.\n\nAnd what makes a song like “The Ghost of You” so re-listenable is that it works on different levels of meaning, and you can also chill out to the smooth guitars and Mikey bass line in the verses while rocking out to the louder choruses. “The Ghost of You” is an important emotional beat in the concept album storyline of Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge, but it’s also an examination of the nature of grief and what it means to have someone ripped away unexpectedly. It’s also the inspiration for a short war film that according to a Fuse interview (Prepare for 2000s cringiness), Gerard actually wrote the treatment to.\n\n“The Ghost of You” proves once and for all that MCR were neither one hit nor one concept wonders. They could dip into other genre inspirations (War, in this case.) in their songwriting, music videos, and look as a band to connect with their listeners on a deep emotional level with both their three minute in-and-out punk songs and rock ballads like this track.\n\n“You like D&D, Audrey Hepburn, Fangoria, Harry Houdini and croquet. You can’t swim, you can’t dance and you don’t know karate. Face it, you’re never gonna make it.”- Ray Toro in the “I’m Not Okay” music video directed by Marc Webb\n\nEven though it’s the fifth track on Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge, “I’m Not Okay” was My Chemical Romance’s first big single and hit #86 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #4 on US Billboard Modern Rock Tracks. It also was #19 on the UK charts showing once and for all that British people have better taste in music than Americans. More likely, it’s that “alternative” music has more of an opportunity to reach the “top of the pops” unlike in the United States where it’s a fluke, or something like grunge or pop punk will be big, have some hits, spawn a lot of imitators, and then fade away. (Arguably, this happened with Brit Pop in the 1990s in the UK too.)\n\nI think the reason that “I’m Not Okay” hit big for My Chemical Romance and is covered by artists like All Time Low and K.K. Slider, other than Frank Iero’s incredibly catchy opening guitar riff, is the near-universality of its subject matter in both its lyrics and Marc Webb-directed music video that is arguably one of the best of the 2000s. (You could honestly say that about “Helena” and “The Ghost of You” too.) Plain and simple, it’s about how it’s okay to not feel okay sometimes, and that there’s hope even if you’re an outsider like the character that the MCR band members play in the video.\n\nIt’s okay to have weird, quirky, niche interests unless you’re an asshole or gatekeeper about them. And the guys don’t seem like those two personality types in “I’m Not Okay” as they spend their time hanging around at the library or bleachers, goofing off in the chemistry lab, or playing croquet because, of course, Webb has them play private/boarding school students in this one. The only really malicious thing that they do in this video is Iero pulling something out of a girl’s eyelashes instead of going in for a kiss. I know Marc Webb was probably trying to demonstrate Iero’s character’s “sheer” ineptitude, but it’s kind of creepy in hindsight. It doesn’t ruin the video though, which continues to hook me and make me wish there was a DeGrassi style TV show starring the members of My Chemical Romance, or at the very least a remake of Rock ‘n’ Roll High School starring them. I mean, I guess I could read some fan fiction, but the kind with real people seems really invasive and makes me uncomfortable.\n\nAnother reason I (and millions of other people) love “I’m Not Okay” and scream along to it in the car, at karaoke, at Emo Night, and (hopefully one day) at MCR’s live shows is its total emotional honesty. There are no guns, assassins, souls, vampires, or demolition lovers in this song just life in all its shitty glory. It starts in the first line of the song with Gerard Way singing, “Well, if you wanted honesty, that’s all you had to say.” to a steady Iero and Ray Toro riff plus a Mikey Way bassline. This lyric plus the straightforward pop rock with a little punk (Because Frank Iero can never not be punk.) sets up the song’s confessional tone about a relationship that is starting to “wear out” the singer.\n\nIn real life, people usually aren’t this blunt unless they’re cool with being yelled at, having a drink spilled on them, or instantly blocked on all forms on social media. But My Chemical Romance can be blunt for us while showing the tension between putting on a fake happy front (“I’m okay.”) and how we really feel (“I’m not okay.”). Gerard’s vocal delivery, whether it’s a whisper or a scream nails this dynamic. Also, as the music that denotes fakeness gets a little Howard Benson piano while realness is served up a muscular guitar riff from Frank Iero.\n\nSo, it’s no wonder we need a break from talking (or singing) with a Ray Toro guitar solo that’s like going outside for a deep breath or cigarette break before returning to tell this friend (or potential partner) that they don’t understand you with the line, “You said you read me like a book/But the pages are all torn and frayed.” Gerard’s voice even begins to break down as he sings, and the song goes into the aforementioned keyboard part or headbanging riff. The sound, or form, of “I’m Not Okay” truly matches the lyrics, or content, which makes the three minute experience of listening to it incredibly satisfying.\n\n“I’m Not Okay’s” theme of leaving everything on the table, emotionally and physical, finds its way to both music videos of the song. There’s the Greg Kaplan-directed original music video without the iconic intro dialogue that literally shows us the daily lives of My Chemical Romance’s members. It follows MCR from Gerard and Mikey’s childhood home to the tour bus and finally the venue where they meet some fans and play an energetic live show with Gerard singing on his back, crowd surfing, and Frank Iero flailing while he plays his guitar.\n\nThe Marc Webb video follows a similar throughline, but couches it in the language of the teen movie and goes more into exposé mode instead of “These are regular guys from New Jersey, who like drawing comics, wielding swords from Lord of the Rings, kissing their moms, and playing punk rock.” In between shots of My Chemical Romance playing or interacting with the high school, Webb shows this prestigious private school’s hidden underbelly from bicurious jocks to a preppy student’s prescription pill addiction and finally, two teachers having an affair. It’s real movie subplot and shows that beneath the starchy uniforms that these folks are “not o-fucking-kay” and need therapy or to get some things off their chest like the guys in MCR.\n\n“I’m Not Okay” deserved to be a huge hit because of it made listeners feel heard and less alone through a four chord Frank Iero punk riff and an immaculate, meant to screamed and sung along to hook. It carried this momentum visually into two videos and finally a platinum certification and fittingly it was the first song played by My Chemical Romance at their reunion tour. Because no matter if you’re an angsty teen or an adult in your 40s like the members of MCR, it’s okay not to feel okay all the time, especially in the middle of a global pandemic\n\nExcuse me, I have something in my eye after watching that intro to the My Chemical Romance reunion set!\n\nContent warning: sexual assault, rape\n\n“He had it comin’ “-“Cell Block Tango” from the musical, Chicago\n\nSo, from the title, it’s pretty obvious that “You Know What They Do to Guys Like Us in Prison” is about being sexually assaulted and abused in prison. It’s very dark subject matter even for a concept album about a man, who has to kill 1,000 people for the devil, for the opportunity to be reunited with his dead love. However, My Chemical Romances tonally counterbalances this with a few tricks up their sleeves including guest screamed vocals from Bert McCracken of The Used and a little cabaret style piano intro played by Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge‘s producer, Howard Benson.\n\nAnd I really want to dig into the sound of “Prison”, which has nods to their punk roots as well as their more theatrical future. Thanks to Frank Iero’s speed and energy on the rhythm guitar, MCR would never be far from punk. However, their vocals, lead guitar, and later their rhythm section with the addition of Bob Bryar on drums would be more rock opera than posthardcore. And you can see this turn in “Prison” with Gerard Way and McCracken duetting about life in prison like if John Waters directed a gender-bent version of Chicago.\n\nGerard does vocal runs and has an earnest delivery while McCracken brings the roar and swagger that made The Used the definitive screamo band as well as some of the more messed up lines about burning down hotels. In a 2013 Grantland interview, Gerard talks about his close relationship with Bert McCracken as their bands toured together that involved raiding the minibar, going on benders, and kissing each other during a game of Spin the Bottle. But there was also real companionship, and Gerard compared McCracken to a “cellmate” in an interview for a book about My Chemical Romance. MCR and The Used would even record a cover of “Under Pressure”, which will be the subject of a future essay.\n\nFrom what I’ve read, it seems like Gerard and McCracken had a deep, almost homoerotic bond that got played up by the fans (*shudders at Frerard*) thanks to the queer content on songs like this one. They were Bowie and Jagger, or Bowie and Iggy of the 2000s punk rock set. However, the gay content on “Prison” is unfortunately not consensual, especially in the post-chorus where Gerard sings, “What they ask of you will make you want to say, “‘So long'”. It’s tough, and the wall of sound created by Ray Toro and Frank Iero gives it a pained, emotional tone like some of their earlier songs for Bullets.\n\nMCR really walks a line between real pain and dark tongue-in-cheek humor, and honestly, Gerard’s vocals and the little one-liners that Bert McCracken bring the verdict down on that side. My Chemical Romance’s has a well-documented interest in “bad movies”, and there is a reference to the gun fu revenge films of John Woo in the opening of “Prison” (“Like a bullet through a flock of doves”).\n\nWith this evidence in hand, I think that this song is a bit of a gender-bent homage to the exploitation genres of women in prison and rape and revenge done through the lens of five or more men in close quarters together. Gerard sings about all the little annoying bits of touring life using the heightened metaphors of prison life like the campy line about “pushups in drag” and sharing spaces with gamblers and serial killers. And there’s also the “revenge” bit at the end about hotel arson in which the protagonist gets his agency back and plays catch up on the souls he has to kill. This is while getting vengeance against the folks that took advantage of him like the traditional third act of a rape and revenge film. (I studied this genre and vigilante films in a film elective class during college, and wow, was that a fucked up, not really nuanced semester.)\n\nAs you can tell, this song is a little uncomfortable for me to write about. I have been groped and sexually assaulted (Not raped, thankfully.) by men at gay bars and clubs in the past so this subject matter isn’t something I like to think about. However, “Prison” has a really fun intro with the piano and action movie references kicking into the guitars and Matt Pelissier and Mikey Way’s groovy rhythm section and is generally a catchy song. So, it’s not one I skip while listening to Three Cheers or My Chemical Romance’s greatest hits album May Death Never Stop You, but it is a song whose deeper implications I try not to think too hard about.\n\n“She died in one of the downstairs rooms, in a heavy walnut bed with a curtain, her gray head propped on a pillow yellow and moldy with age and lack of sunlight.”– William Faulkner in “A Rose for Emily”\n\nMy Chemical Romance is definitely a band of readers, whether that’s prose or comic books. Gerard and Mikey Way worked at a Barnes and Noble in New Jersey before the band took off, and Mikey even came up with MCR’s name from Irvine Welsh’s short story collection, Ecstasy: Three Tales of Chemical Romance. As shown from their previous tracks and the band’s visual imagery, My Chemical Romance also loves horror, the macabre, and stories of murder, mayhem, and the breaking of societal taboos. So, it’s fitting that they basically adapt William Faulkner’s 1930 short story “A Rose for Emily” in Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge’s third track, “To the End”, and it’s nice to see the five boys from Jersey appreciate the Southern Gothic genre.\n\nI read “A Rose for Emily” in either my 12th Grade American Lit class (Shout out to Mrs. Pizzino!), or 20th century American Literature class in college. So, it’s been almost ten years since I’ve read it. However, the final paragraph of the short story about a “traditional”, aristocratic Southern woman committing necrophilia has stuck with me and made me shudder endlessly. My Chemical Romance use this imagery of death and decay combined with harmonized vocal choruses, vintage guitar playing from Ray Toro, and strong punk riffs from Frank Iero to create a memorable song.\n\nThe basic plot of the story is that Emily is a reclusive woman, who is resistant to change, and her father won’t let her marry even though they are the last members of their once-wealthy family. After her father’s death, she becomes friends with a man named Homer (Who is mentioned in the song), but he is gay and not interested in marrying her. So, she kills him with arsenic (The “cyanide” in the lyrics) and keeps his body in a room in the house like he’s alive and her husband. After a long life filled with strange smells coming from her mansion and tax evasion, Emily dies. Because she’s a local curiosity,\n\nMCR keeps a lot of the best elements from “A Rose for Emily” in “To the End” like the iconic opening lines, “He calls the mansion not a house but a tomb/He’s always choking from the stench and the fume”, which is basically the townspeople’s reaction to Miss Emily’s house. Also, it is a mausoleum for both her father (Who she doesn’t bury for a while.) and Homer. However, My Chemical Romance also modernize the story a little bit with the second verse talking about the female character’s fancy car, diamonds, and driving by “Barbies and Kens”. It’s almost like they’re foreshadowing the characters that Marina Diamandis and Lana Del Rey would play on their first records in the early 2010s.\n\nMy Chemical Romance recorded Three Cheers at a studio in the San Fernando Valley and filmed the video for “Helena” at a church of Los Angeles. So, it’s a possibility that the strange and curious lives of actors, rock stars, and celebrities were on their mind while making this song and album, including their short marriages and sometimes theatrical deaths. And the protagonist of “A Rose for Emily” could easily be Howard Hughes-Southern belle edition.\n\nIn more of a penny dreadful than preachy way, MCR is showing how out of touch and selfish wealthy and famous people can be as they live insular lifestyles and don’t care about “regular people” around him. I mean, look at all the stories coming in about how Ellen DeGeneres mistreated her employees while her public persona was “progressive” and “relatable”. (Hey, I don’t trust anyone who watches football with war criminals with Hunter S. Thompson and Nixon being the single exception.) Wealthy and famous people don’t care about how many “lives they break”, and this only increases exponentially until you reach the billionaire types like Bezos, Zuckerberg, and the Kochs, who can basically influence how many people view reality.\n\nSo, “To the End” works on a number of levels: it’s a creepy Gothic story, a literary homage, and a piece of biting social satire. It’s also enjoyable on a sonic level because “To the End” has a Ray Toro guitar solo. This solo is augmented by Frank Iero’s sharp rhythm playing, Matt Pelissier’s upbeat percussion, and layered vocals from Iero, Toro, and Gerard. Producer Howard Benson gets that sweet, Brian May-esque guitar sound from Toro that he would later perfect on Black Parade. Queen meets The Misfits is a good sound for a song that’s simultaneously about decadence and depravity.\n\nContent warning: drug use, suicide, self-harm\n\nI know this essay isn’t legally binding, but I want this song played at my funeral. Seriously, My Chemical Romance takes about a million leaps forward (Especially in sound department) with the opening track of their second record, Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge. This song was truly their breakthrough hit, charting #33 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #11 on the US Alternative Songs in 2005 crossing them over from the hardcore punk/emo scene to the rock kids and finally to Americans turning their radios to the Top 40 stations everywhere. It’s a song that lots of MCR fans have an emotional connection to because it was the last song they played before they went on hiatus. I’ve also personally quoted it in a goodbye email after resigning from a job and lost my shit to it at the last Emo Night I attended that was unfortunately “long ago”. (It was the final song the DJ played.)\n\n“Helena” also has a killer video (With over 122 million views) to go with the track by then-veteran music video helmer, Marc Webb, who would go on to direct 500 Days of Summer as well as the two worst Spider-Man films. However, this doesn’t matter because all six (!) of the videos he directed for MCR are fantastic and shows the band’s creativity that was only hinted at in the videos for “Honey This Mirror Isn’t Big Enough for the Two of Us” and “Vampires Will Never Hurt You”.\n\nI mean, “Helena” has choreographed danced moves, an attempt at communicating with the dead, Mikey Way spreading incense in a church aisle, Frank Iero barely being able to carry a hearse, and Gerard Way staring longingly into the viewers eyes in the final shot of the video. Plus Tracy Phillips, who plays Helena in the video, is an icon and turns in a convincing performance as one of the living dead with her jerky, yet on-beat movements. (Random trivia fact: she is the daughter of former L.A. Rams defensive coordinator, Wade Phillips, who once shared a screenshot from “Helena” on his Twitter.)\n\nThe “Helena” music video is a whole damn funeral, a modern dance sequence, and a fashion look book for MCR rolled into one as the band would start rocking black eyeliner and formalwear during their live shows. They even reenacted the video during a gig and held a funeral procession with hearse before a double London show on Gerard Way’s birthday. If you’ve read my previous essays, you know that My Chemical Romance has done some damn good songs before this one, but now they have access to things like Pro Tools, a studio in Los Angeles, and Frank Iero to create a fuller sonic landscape to go with their boundless imaginations, punk rock energy, and passionate lyrics. Ray Toro and Iero’s guitars complement Gerard’s emotional vocals incredibly well in this song and match its mood every step of the way.\n\nSpeaking of passion, MCR taps that vein of raw feeling with “Helena’s” inspiration being Gerard and Mikey Way’s grandmother, who passed away during the recording of this record and was extremely important to their lives. She taught him to sing, draw, and bought My Chemical Romance their first touring van. In an interview with Kerrang, Gerard talks about how this song was born out of “self-hate” that he didn’t get to spend enough time with grandma, Elena, before she passed in the last year of her life. This is why the lyrics (“…just like the hearse you die to get in again…”) allude to the fact that the only time Gerard will be able to spend time with her is when he himself is dead.\n\nAnd Gerard really meant this as a large portion of the Life on the Murder Scene documentary talks about his addiction to alcohol, pills, and later cocaine, that he used to help cope with My Chemical Romance’s meteoric rise. MCR’s manager, Brian Schechter, talks extensively about Gerard’s suicidal thoughts and talking him down from the proverbial ledge so there is a sense of real pain in these lyrics. Especially once you get to the bridge where Gerard basically channels his future creation, Seance aka Klaus Hargreeves from The Umbrella Academy, and calls out to his grandmother from beyond the grave. His vocals tremble while Ray Toro, Frank Iero, and Mikey Way create a steady wall of sound that returns to the full rocking out, easy danceability of the chorus.\n\nGerard and Iero said they learned “song structure” for Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge‘s sweatpants-rocking producer Howard Benson, and it shows. The lyrics in the chorus of “Helena” are similar to “Every Breath You Take” by The Police, but a little more horror movie than creepy stalker. Instead of “every claim you stake”, they sing “Every blade you stain” alluding to the blood on the lovers on the album cover as well as (apparently) on every extra and band member in their early photoshoots. Plus it could also stand for things like the Ways’ grandmother going under the surgical knife or self-harm. Existence without Elena is painful for sure.\n\nHowever, she would have wanted the band to move on and keep playing as Ray Toro mentions in Life on the Murder Scene when he talks about her helping them purchase a van for their first tour. This seeps through in the lyric, “Things are better if I stay” as Gerard decides to not take his own life (and would later speak out against suicide during live shows) and finish out the song and later the album and various tours. “Helena” isn’t just an ending, but the beginning of a new era for the band. With its tone of finality and fade-out ending, it’s a great song to wrap up a gig or a DJ set, but it’s also a way to kickstart an album (and era) with a surefire hit and acts as motivation for a concept album protagonist that I will touch on in later essays.\n\nI would like to wrap up this essay with a shout out to my grandmas, who have helped me feel motivated, loved, and understood while also giving me the opportunity to eat my weight in baked goods or Southern cooking. While listening to this song again and researching Gerard and Mikey’s relationship with their grandmother, I realized that I’m glad that I get to spend some time with them this holiday season even though “Helena” would not be a kind of song they would like.\n\nI do think they’d both think the church in the “Helena” video is pretty, and I definitely plan on checking it out and taking shameless selfies next time I visit L.A. I’ll save the choreographed dancing for the professionals though.\n\nAlso, this song would have made an amazing 1980s prom ” slow song”.\n\n“There never was a Jack the Ripper…”- Alan Moore in From Hell\n\nBefore jumping into Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge, it’s time for a quick detour into a rare cut from My Chemical Romance’s discography. The track in question is “Jack the Ripper”, a live cover of the Morrissey B-side from his single “Certain People I Know” off his quite excellent 1992 album/glam revival Your Arsenal.\n\nThere are two versions of this song. One is from the EP Like Phantoms Forever, which featured early versions of “Vampires Will Never Hurt You” and “This Is the Best Day Ever”. The other was a B-side on the vinyl single of “Thank You For the Venom”, which featured some seriously cool James O’Barr-inspired sleeve art. The song basically acts as an homage to two of MCR’s biggest influences: the horror genre and Morrissey/The Smiths.\n\nI have a confession to make. I haven’t read Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell’s From Hell so I’m definitely not qualified to theorize on his identity and actions. (Even though, I like the theory that he was an English royal because the monarchy is a bunch of parasites.) However, he is an iconic figure of fact or fiction and a kind of boogeyman symbol of preying on marginalized folks: late 19th century sex workers in this case. So, it’s a bold (and let’s face it: fun) move to sing from his perspective.\n\nMy favorite part of My Chemical Romance’s cover of “Jack the Ripper” is how much they actually make it sound like The Smiths thanks to Mikey Way’s solid bass groove and Ray Toro channeling Johnny Marr with his jangly guitar sound until he goes full rock god at the end. Gerard Way even adds some yodels and yelps to his death screams as he channels Morrissey, who he told Blender in an interview that he aspired to be like, both in sound and lyrics. (Maybe not in political views though.) By playing a B-side instead of something obvious like “Every Day is Like Sunday”, MCR shows their knowledge of Morrissey’s music. Plus this song (With crimson lighting effects.) has been a constant sample of Morrissey’s live show so why wouldn’t MCR add it to their own repertoire.\n\nIt is truly a novelty to go from the hardcore punk of the first two tracks on Like Phantoms Forever to travel back in time sonically to the British indie music of the 1980s, but with a little rougher vocals although Morrissey and Gerard have a similar range. “Jack the Ripper” theorizes that My Chemical Romance is a versatile band, and this would be proven for a fact in their next three studio albums so this not-the-greatest live performance is a taste of things to come.\n\nOne key difference between Morrissey’s version of “Jack the Ripper” and My Chemical Romance’s cover is that MCR excises the third verse speculating on The Ripper’s identity. It also can be interpreted as Morrissey continuing to build up his own enigmatic personality as it’s really hard to get a bead on what Moz thinks or believes at any one time, much less his sexuality or interpersonal relationships. He’s definitely a bookish, introverted fellow though. My Chemical Romance may have left out this verse because they had a certain time for their set, or maybe, they’re okay with being open about what they stand for and their lives (See all the cute family pics of the band members on Instagram.) instead of being some never ending mystery.\n\n“Jack the Ripper” is My Chemical Romance just having a good time and reminding you that at the time that they were just four (and later five with Frank Iero) fans of 80s British music and genre fiction, who wanted to play punk rock and maybe inspire the world a little bit. Or scare them in this case.\n\n“They’re young. They’re in love. And they kill people.”-tagline for Bonnie and Clyde (1967)\n\n“Demolition Lovers”, which is the final track of I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love, is a damn good prequel. Like the opposite of Phantom Menace good. Even better than the First Purge good. This is because the “Demolition Lovers” are the blood-stained couple on the cover of My Chemical Romance’s follow-up album Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge. MCR gives us their backstory in this song and sets up the gun toting, soul taking action of the next record with the protagonist of “Demolition Lovers” singing a declaration of eternal love for his dead partner that nicely transitions into the funeral service of “Helena”.\n\nMy film references in the first paragraph weren’t me trying to be glib and pander to grudge-holding Star Wars fanboys. (They’re the worst.) I used them because “cinematic” is the best way to describe “Demolition Lovers”. My Chemical Romance breaks out of their B-movie roots and two to three minute punk track mold to make a longer, cooler five minute punk B-movie track. Also, this is a true love song unlike the shyness and crushes of “Cubicles” with Gerard Way spending the entire song showing how much his partner (Possibly based on his real life partner, K.) means to him and that he would get into violent, dangerous Natural Born Killers and, of course, Bonnie and Clyde situations with her. (They rob liquor stores, not banks though.)\n\nAs far as the sound of “Demolition Lovers” goes, I really think MCR and producer Geoff Rickly pulled together the strengths of previous tracks to give Bullets a fitting sendoff. I can definitely see this track engaging listeners and making them eager to see My Chemical Romance on tour and imagine what kind of album they would make when signed to a major label. It opens with a mournful Ray Toro guitar part a la “Early Sunsets Over Monroeville” and soft, confessional vocals from Gerard to go with Toro’s thoughtful picking. Mikey Way’s bass and Matt Pelissier’s drums start to kick in as Gerard describes their crime sprees and desert getaways before breaking into punk rock guitars and screaming vocals. The more violent the lyrics, the heavier the instrumentation, and the more screaming in the vocals. It’s form and content fitting like a glove.\n\nAround the halfway point on the track, it seems like “Demolition Lovers” and the Bullets record is sliding home and wrapping things up. However, it’s a false ending, and the back half of the song is even better than the beginning featuring such goodies like a bridge with some great kick drums from Pelissier and a melodic guitar line from Toro. It ends up transforming into a mission statement for the entire album with Mikey’s steady bass line and Gerard’s lyrics “All we are is bullets, I mean this” driving the point home. Then, we get an intense Ray Toro guitar solo that is like a hail of bullets (No flocks of doves just yet.) in an action flick before breaking down into his signature smooth sound as the song concludes with Gerard’s screams and growls that signify the death of his beloved.\n\n“Demolition Lovers” has it all. It’s a rocker, a ballad, makes interesting philosophical points, and also acts as a kind of “zero” chapter to the concept album that is Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge. However, the whole track and really the whole Bullets record can be stripped down to the repeated line in the interlude “All we are, all we are is bullets.” The line is a bit of an allusion to “Dust in the Wind” by Kansas so you know MCR is going to say something deep and metaphorical.\n\nThe bullet image has so many meanings, but it really boils down that despite how hard we try: humans always end up hurting each other, especially the ones we’re close to. That’s why it’s so easy to go from the literal vampires, zombies, killers, patients, and other genre movie denizens of Bullets to metaphors for breakups and difficult relationships. My Chemical Romance’s lyrics work on multiple levels of meaning, which is why their songs are so fun to listen to over and over again, and honestly, why I’m doing this essay project. Plus, like good actors, Gerard’s vocals, Toro’s guitar tone and playing speed, Mikey’s bass line (or lack of one), and Pelissier’s percussion shades the meaning of these words. For example, after the “All we are is bullets”, there’s a nice guitar solo break that provides for headbanging or rocking out with your brain out until Gerard returns with the pretty visuals of rose beds and phantoms ending the song on Gothic romance tone although he is screaming like a hardcore punk singer.\n\nAnd speaking of punk (And this might be controversial.), I would truly consider Bullets to be a punk album with its DIY production quality, speed-played guitars, aggressive percussion, just enough bass, and screamed vocals. As far as I can tell, there were no synths or keyboards on Bullets even though there were plenty of hooks and imagery that were more Bauhaus or Killing Joke than Dead Kennedys. According to Life on the Murder Scene, The Misfits’ sound and horror influences and The Smiths’ melancholy lyrics/upbeat sound were the major influences on MCR, and I’ll go into The Smiths and Morrissey connection even more in tomorrow’s essay. (Full disclosure: The Smiths are my second favorite band after My Chemical Romance.)\n\nIf you like sad songs about heartbreak as well as cool fight scenes in action movies, then “Demolition Lovers” is the track for you. Conversely, if you like big guitar riffs and solos as well as yearning vocals and picking, then “Demolition Lovers” is also the track for you. It’s MCR’s big senior project, and they’re ready to go to college, er, Three Cheers now with a pair of blood-stained lovers leading the way. I still think “Headfirst for Halos” will always be my favorite song off Bullets though.\n\n“Shyness is nice, and shyness can stop you from doing all the things in life you’d like to.”- “Ask” by The Smiths from The World Won’t Listen\n\nIf tracks like “Vampires Will Never Hurt You”, “Our Lady of Sorrows”, and “Early Sunsets over Monroeville” were genre exercises for My Chemical Romance, then “Cubicles” is their take on slice of life. It’s a story about a guy working a dead-end office, temp kind of job, and he sees a girl he likes a couple cubicles down. But instead of getting to know her or striking up a conversation, he just imagines the life they might have together until she ends up leaving the company. In the closing bridge bit, Gerard Way wails and resigns himself to dying alone while Ray Toro layers guitars over a highly catchy riff, Mikey Way adds a nice bass groove, and Matt Pelissier’s percussion cuts in and out.\n\nToro’s “Cubicles” riff is the right mix of pop and punk, and later, his steady rhythm playing gives plenty of room for Gerard to craft the story of our hapless office worker. He also gets to rock out a little bit during the instrumental break before the “You don’t work here anymore”, which is the emotional climax of the song as Gerard goes from missing the woman, who he didn’t know, but worked at his office to thinking he’ll die alone. The rhythm and lead guitars end up overlapping during this part creating a feeling of real urgency and emotion, and Toro gets to play that riff by himself one last time before Pelissier’s drums and Gerard’s vocals kick in with one final “die alone”. Finally, the song fades out.\n\nTo put it all in perspective, “Cubicles” was one of the I Brought You My Bullets songs I was really excited to write about because of this catchy riff and the highly relatable lyrics about crushes and dead end office jobs. From 2016 to 2019, I had a soul-crushing corporate office gig and could definitely identify with the lyrics, “I’ll spend my time with strangers” because I didn’t really connect with my co-workers and was even attacked, isolated, and excluded by them until I started working for another department during their busy time. Those folks (Except for the keto diet cultists) were definitely more fun to be around. Even in the other department, that whole situation sucked, and thankfully, I had creative work and fun trips to look forward to. Also, that job was the impetus for me going back to school and becoming a librarian.\n\nAs well as empathizing with the workers of what anthropologist David Graeber calls “bullshit jobs”, “Cubicles” also tackles one of the most popular subjects of emo pop and pop music in general: unrequited love. However, Gerard doesn’t even really spend time with the object of his affection calling it a “water cooler romance” and spends half of the second verse coming up with weird, yet kind of cool date ideas (Is “Kicking over blades we see” skating, or does it involve edged weapons) when he hasn’t even had any kind of substantive conversation with the woman. It comes across as a little pathetic, but hey, anxiety is a thing. Also, putting yourself out there is tough so it’s nice to get a song like “Cubicles” that unpacks these feelings.\n\nMy verdict on “Cubicles’” protagonist is that he’s not an incel, but just really shy, lonely, and introverted and has issues fitting in a hustle and bustle of an office environment. (Maybe, he should be a freelance writer or artist or play in a band.) He’s definitely open about his feelings as evidenced by him repeatedly thinking that he’ll die alone. Deep down, you know this is going to happen unless you get in a “There Is a Light That Never Goes Out” situation where you and another person get killed simultaneously and instantly by a MegaBus or something. (Imagine the little guy in the yellow hat being the last sight you see before you shuffle the mortal coil.)\n\nMy Chemical Romance was definitely channeling the lyrics of Morrissey and The Smiths in “Cubicles” with their aversion to work, melodramatic approach to love and death, and what “Nowhere Fast” described as “natural emotion”. Plus their frontmen used to be hermits with Morrissey famously holing up in his room listening to records and writing into music magazines until Johnny Marr coaxed him into joining a band. Likewise, according to Life on the Murder Scene, Gerard Way would spend all day in his room “drawing comics in his underwear” with Mikey Way being the more sociable of the two and helping bring Ray Toro and Frank Iero into the band. Maybe, Gerard thought he would die alone drawing in that room with almost no natural light…\n\nWith a hummable/air guitar-worthy main riff from Ray Toro and lyrics that cover the relatable situations of dead end jobs and having an unrequited crush, “Cubicles” is one of the standouts from Bullets and shows that My Chemical Romance can do dark romantic comedy (Or actually tragedy) as well as Gothic romance and horror. Because nine out of ten times, reality is scarier than vampires or zombies.\n\n“You wanted a hit, but maybe we don’t do hits.”- “You Wanted A Hit” by LCD Soundsystem from This Is Happening\n\nEven though I was pretty hard on “Drowning Lessons”, I think that “This Is the Best Day Ever” is my least favorite track on I Brought You My Bullets. If it wasn’t two minutes long, it would probably be the only one track that I would skip during a playthrough. “Best Day Ever” is a typical Bullets era My Chemical Romance song with screaming vocals from Gerard Way, emotionally vulnerable lyrics, and heavy guitars and percussion from Ray Toro and Matt Pelissier.\n\nNone of these are bad things, and Mikey Way has a killer bass line at the beginning of the song creating a true rhythm section with Pelissier even though he’s not Peter Hook yet. (Nor should he be with the twin guitar attack of Toro and Frank Iero.) There are also some vocal harmonies from Thursday’s Geoff Rickly, who produced Bullets, and had a real band with MCR even opening for Gerard on his one and only solo tour in the U.K. Seeing Thursday’s impact on their young fans was one reason that Gerard decided to stop doing the commercial art/animation thing and be serious about starting a band so it’s nice to see Rickly get more of a showcase on this track.\n\nThe storyline of “This Is the Best Day Ever” is fairly simple. Two patients are in a hospital after what seems like a bad accident. They form a bond of mutual hatred for their surroundings and decide to leave the place together even if this seems dramatic and like burning down the Ferris Wheel at the state fair. This song is only two minutes long and had no video so there’s not really a lot of time for characterization, but it is a foretaste of what would be a key setting in The Black Parade where the Patient was dying from cancer.\n\nThis shows that death and people’s reactions to death was a preoccupation of My Chemical Romance from day one. Staying in a hospital where you’re isolated and hooked up to all kinds of machines is a difficult situation, and no wonder Gerard and his horde of backup vocalists want to get as far away as possible. Freedom and escape is a constant theme of MCR’s music, and “Best Day Ever” is a hyper-focused, bottle episode version of it.\n\nMy big takeaway from “Best Day Ever” is that the recording background of this song is more interesting than its lyrics or sound. Unless you’re Say Anything on In Defense of the Genre, emo or posthardcore bands don’t really do “posse cuts”, but this track is an exception with every MCR band member plus Frank Iero, the aforementioned Rickly, and co-producer Alex Saavedra getting a vocals credit. Everyone in the Nada Studios at the time got do vocals except for the mixer, John Naclerio.\n\nIt’s a musical demonstration of how tight the New Jersey punk scene was at the time, and Gerard and Geoff Rickly go into it deeper in a 2015 interview with Vice where they talk about their (and their bands’) relationship as well as their connection to other artists in the scene like Taking Back Sunday. This camaraderie matches the lyrics of “Best Day Ever” about working together to escape the hospital as well as some of the road stories shared in Life on the Murder Scene where My Chemical Romance give kudos to artists like Underoath for giving them water bottles and T-shirts to wear when they ran out of clean clothes. Without these relationships, MCR might not have survived to sign with Reprise Records in 2003.\n\n“This Is the Best Day Ever” doesn’t have the catchiest hooks, best guitars and drums to head bang too, or most memorable lyrics. (It does have Mikey Way’s best bass playing of Bullets so far.) However, sometimes that’s okay, and real enjoyment can be found in seeing the true “band of brothers” vibe from MCR as everyone gets in on the vocal harmonies to speed the song’s speaker away from the hospital and to freedom. (This would happen with a much bigger budget in Black Parade.)\n\n“When there’s no more room in Hell, the dead will walk the Earth.”-tagline from Dawn of the Dead (1978)\n\nAfter a series of emotionally-rending rockers, My Chemical Romance takes a break from the loud guitars, hardcore punk riffs, and big drums and slow things down with a ballad in Track Eight of Bullets, “Early Sunsets over Monroeville.” Alternative Press describes this song as “… a love song about George A. Romero’s zombie opus Dawn of the Dead.” As I mentioned in my essay about “Romance”, I haven’t watched Dawn of the Dead and only really know about it through pop culture osmosis and random YouTube clips I watched as research for this essay. However, the references are pretty easy to catch, including the lyrics about malls, the tagline of the film “When there’s no room in Hell, the dead will walk the Earth”, and of course, the title of the song that is an allusion to the Monroeville Mall where Dawn of the Dead was filmed.\n\nIf “Vampires Will Never Hurt You” was My Chemical Romance’s take on the vampire romance, then “Early Sunsets Over Monroeville” is their take on zombie romance. Their Warm Bodies, eight years before it was published, or Shaun of the Dead, but with less platonic male friendship and more pain and aching. The lyrics’ storyline follows a couple on the run, who find shelter at a mall a la Dawn of the Dead. But then one of them gets bitten by zombies and is “changed from just one bite”. The human partner must struggle with killing the person he loves, and that creates the tension of the song between Gerard Way’s increasingly emotional vocals and the subdued instrumentation by Mikey Way, Matt Pellissier, Ray Toro, and Frank Iero, who contributes a lovely, clean guitar sound to the track. (It’s only one of two tracks he plays on in Bullets.)\n\nAs mentioned in my essay about “Vampires”, Gerard and Mikey love horror films. The evidence for this includes their lyrics, the art on My Chemical Romance’s single and album releases, the imagery and costumes in their music videos, and most importantly, the posters in their childhood bedrooms. In the Life on the Murder Scene documentary, they and Ray Toro talk about how these films were an escape for them while growing up in an area in New Jersey with a lot of crime, shootings, and murder. This touches on one of the strengths of the horror genre, which is that it can be a blood and gore metaphor for unspoken feelings or about contemporary society like Dawn of the Dead, which satirized “greed is good” American consumerism.\n\nMCR echoes this, early on in “Monroeville”, when Gerard ironically compares the humdrum elements of your typical shopping mall (Escalators, tacky fountains, vending machines, sales on shit you don’t want or need) to beautiful mountains. The song opens up with the nature imagery of “late dawns and early sunsets”, which is something you don’t think about in urban or suburban strip mall sprawl and matches the breathy sweetness of Gerard’s vocals, Toro and Iero’s guitar tone, and Mikey’s minimal bass. It sets up the romantic relationship between the speaker in the song nicely before the zombie apocalypse rips it apart.\n\nHowever, My Chemical Romance subverts what they did in earlier songs and keeps the instruments going out for a Sunday drive relaxed while relying on Gerard’s vocals to demonstrate the pain the protagonist must make in killing someone he loves because they are a zombie. Even though he was suffering from nerve damage and a tooth abscess, Gerard turns in some powerhouse vocals that demonstrates his lovely tenor range and ability to hold notes as well as scream and howl like a punk performer. Supposedly, his performance was so heartbreaking and vulnerable, that the rest of the band immediately had to take a smoke/cry break after the vocals were laid down. In the end, he sings a capella and bridges the literal zombie/lovers of the run story with the metaphor of the death of a relationship.\n\nLike several on Bullets, I think that “Early Sunsets Over Monroeville” is a breakup song. The first verse and pre-chorus idealize the speaker’s relationship with his partner and fit nicely with the ballad-y interplay of acoustic and clean electric guitar. My Chemical Romance has gone adult contemporary, or more likely, emo pop. However, when the zombie bite lyric is introduced, everything goes downhill, especially in the existential crisis-filled chorus where Gerard keeps wailing and questioning, “But does anyone notice? But does anyone care?” He’s in a situation where everyone thinks he’s in this perfect relationship when it’s really cold and dead like the zombies alluded to in the song.\n\nI don’t want to go into gory detail or name names, but I’ve been there. And this is definitely exacerbated by social media where you can create (To take a line from another great emo-adjacent band, Paramore) a “fake happy” image of your relationship and save the messy shit for offline or alt accounts where you can actually be your “real” self. Ok, rant over, but look out for your friends even if they seem to be a happy or good situation in life.\n\nIn “Early Sunsets Over Monroeville”, My Chemical Romance demonstrates the versatility of their sound even on their first album, and the tracks also acts as a coronation for Gerard Way as a god among vocalists. The song also expertly connects horror/zombie genre elements with relationship turmoil in an emotionally authentic way that listeners can relate too and without some of the misogyny of their contemporaries.\n\nTo wrap things up, I have a question for the audience. What’s your go-to MCR song to listen to after a break up?\n\n“Oh no, love, you’re not alone.”- David Bowie in “Rock ‘N’ Roll Suicide” from The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars\n\nNote for posterity: I was doing the last edits for this essay when the AP announced that Donald Trump lost the 2020 election.\n\nEven though it’s track seven on Bullets, “Skylines and Turnstiles” is the first My Chemical Romance song and was written by Gerard Way after he witnessed the World Trade Center fall on September 11, 2001 while commuting to his internship as an artist at Cartoon Network. He wrote the song, called up drummer Matt “Otter” Pelissier, and then called guitarist Ray Toro when he realized he couldn’t play guitar and sing at the same time. They added Gerard’s younger brother (and fellow Barnes and Noble employee) Mikey Way on bass, who brought the name My Chemical Romance with him, recorded the Attic Demos, played their first gig at an American Legion Hall in Creskill, New Jersey, and the rest is history.\n\nIn various interviews with Vice, on the Life on the Murder Scene documentary, and a 2012 episode of Kevin Smith’s Smodcast, Gerard (or MCR’s manager Brian Schechter) talks about how he looked up from his sketchbook and saw bodies falling out of the tower. He was even on the cover of the Newark Star-Ledger witnessing the terrorist attack and realized that it was time to make something “meaningful” instead of drawing pictures for a corporation. That was “Skylines and Turnstiles”, and by extension, My Chemical Romance.\n\nWith its earnest vocals, questioning lyrics, and vivid imagery, “Skylines and Turnstiles” definitely sounds like Gerard grappling with the emotions he felt on 9/11 with the help of Pelissier, Toro, and Mikey. He describes what he saw as “This broken city sky like butane on my skin.” and wonders if he will ever be able to move from what he witnessed. As an artist, Gerard had a great visual imagination, and he was able to apply this to lyrics and later music creating dark poetry as well as a rallying cry of “And if the world needs something better/Let’s give them one more reason now.”\n\nUnlike certain politicians at the time, Gerard Way and My Chemical Romance used the events of 9/11 not to justify the deaths of innocent people or promote violence against folks from the Middle East or followers of the Islamic faith, but to bring life and hope to suffering people, especially kids, who lost friends or relatives on that day, or knew people who did. After the 2000 US Presidential Election, 9/11 is the first major historical event that I remember. I was eight and living in Souther"
