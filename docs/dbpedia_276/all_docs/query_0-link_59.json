In this episode, it’s a fan favorite: the 2023 year-end SCENE wrap-up show featuring Jake Whalen of Pyro, Ohio!\n\nIt’s been a long time since I got to record a full show on the Scene, so I was thrilled when Jake was excited as well. We discuss the Scene in general, talk about many albums out in 2023, the best EPs (in Ian’s opinion), and much more! There’s so much to review, so this is just PART 1. In Part 2, we review the best and worst of the Scene in 2023 (and more, of course)! So don’t be surprised when you get to the end of Part 1, and it’s a Spider-Man: Across The Spider-Verse cliffhanger 🤘\n\nCorrection: Skylar is the bassist of Issues, not the guitarist, and Michael’s last name is ‘Bohn’ 🤘\n\nCheck out the exclusive conversation below (and Part 2 soon), including iTunes, Spotify, Stitcher, and more:\n\nSpotify 🤘 iTunes 🤘 Google Play Music\n\nMake sure to support Pyro, Ohio, in all they do!

This episode is a party because I welcome guitarist and vocalist Nick ‘Neeco’ Trahan, drummer Robb Barrio, bassist Travvy Thomas, and guitarist Mattie Cortopassi of New Orlean’s HourHouse!\n\nHourHouse is a newer genre-bending band to me, but I’m thrilled I got to hear their new album, ‘Gold Tooth Guru,’ that just came out recently through UNFD (that means you should check it out, too)! We talk about the new album, New Orleans, and have one of the most fun and confusing debates I’ve ever had on the show! Hahaha.\n\nIt’s a lot of fun getting to know HourHouse, and you won’t want to miss it 🤘\n\nNote: this recording was performed using a brand-new audio setup, so there were some audio issues (primarily because of the conferencing software). I did my best to smooth everything out. I hope you still enjoy it 🤘\n\nCheck out the exclusive interview below, including iTunes, Spotify, and more:\n\nSpotify 🤘 iTunes 🤘 Google Play Music\n\nBig thanks to the guys for taking the time to be on the show!

In this episode, I feature someone I’ve wanted to speak with for a long time, Chris “Cream” Ratzlaff, vocalist for Fallstar!\n\nChris is always a busy man, as he has a family with three children, not to mention fronting the unique and genre-bending metalcore band Fallstar AND being a part of two other bands, Northlander and Cobra Cobra! We focus our talk mostly on Fallstar (but make sure to check out his other projects, too), their crowdfunding ideas, the new album ‘Sacred Mirrors,’ and so much more!\n\nI don’t want to give away everything here; trust that you will enjoy this conversation…(Donnie Darko is all I’ll say right now…)\n\nCheck out the exclusive conversation below, including iTunes, Spotify, Stitcher, and more:\n\nSpotify 🤘 iTunes 🤘 Google Play Music\n\nMake sure to support Chris and Fallstar in all they do!

So, here’s the end of 2020 episode with all the scars that the real 2020 has (i.e. no editing, you get what you get). No one seems to care when shows sound like it’s two guys in a bathroom stall and not humorous whatsoever, so why would you care that Dave is halfway across the country and there’s some background noise?\n\nAnyway, I’m hanging out with the Scene ghosts right now listening to From First to Last and talking about how terrible Alt Press is. Enjoy the jokes and please stay safe and healthy this holiday season!\n\nHappy Holidays!\n\nMerry Christmas!\n\nHappy New Year!\n\nStay Scene!\n\nBuilding another brand is tough.

Yes, it didn’t happen at the beginning of 2020, it happens at the end! To celebrate this oh so special of occasions, Dave put together his list of the worst scene albums of the decade! This is a really fun conversation, so go have some fun yourself and take a listen! Really, I think that’s all the hype you need.\n\nBig shout out to Rick, who helps anytime I need a promo image!
