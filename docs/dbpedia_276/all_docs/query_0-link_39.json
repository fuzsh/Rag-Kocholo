        "text": "Buying your first ever guitar can be intimidating. There’s a lot out there to choose from, some of them are quite pricey, and it’s hard to know what it is you’re looking for, especially when you’re new to the instrument. I was there myself once, saving up my eight-grade allowance and cat sitting for my neighbors to try and afford a guitar that ended up being picked primarily based on how it looked due to my lack of actual understanding of the instrument. Once I learned a little bit more about what I wanted from a guitar, I ended up selling that guitar for about half what I paid for it in order to pay for a guitar better suited to my actual playing.\n\nSo for this piece, I’m going to write the guide that I wish I had at thirteen years old. In it, we’re going to go over some of the most affordable guitars widely available. While of course there are far more models available at comparable prices than the six we will go over in this piece, these six are all personal recommendations of mine and great choices for your first guitar.\n\nWe’re going to look and their pros as well as some cons, and help you figure out which model would make your perfect first guitar.\n\nAcoustic Or Electric?\n\nThe first thing to consider when buying your first guitar is whether you are looking for an acoustic or an electric. Acoustic guitars are often the more popular choice among complete beginners, as they do not require any additional equipment to get started and are much easier to travel with. However, many find the thinner strings and increased sensitivity of electric guitars to make them both easier and more comfortable to learn on. But despite their sonic differences, acoustic and electric guitars are played the same exact way and you’ll be able to play both regardless of which kind you initially learned on.\n\nSo with all that said, I’d advise choosing based on what sort of guitar excites you more. When you first considered taking the leap of learning the guitar, did you imagine strumming an acoustic or rocking out on an electric? I believe that what you had pictured probably answers the acoustic/electric conundrum for you. Once you feel like you’ve made the decision, feel free to jump down to either the acoustic guitar section or the electric guitar section of this piece.\n\nAcoustic Guitars\n\nAcoustic guitars primarily come in either steel-string or nylon-string varieties. While the key difference between steel string guitars and nylon string guitars is, unsurprisingly, the difference in string material that gives them their respective names, the differences do go a bit further than whatever sort of string happens to be put on them. This is because there is a significant difference in tension between a guitar strung with steel strings versus a guitar strung with nylon strings, and steel-string and nylon string guitars are constructed differently to accommodate this.\n\nSteel-string guitars were invented after their nylon-stringed counterparts, and are both considerably louder and considerably brighter-sounding. They are nowadays the more common acoustic guitar variety, and are the standard guitar for such American music genres as country, blues, bluegrass, acoustic rock, and American folk, as well as British folk. On the other hand, nylon string guitars have a gentler, darker tone and softer strings that many players find more comfortable and less taxing than steel strings. Nylon string guitars used just about exclusively among classical guitarists, and are also widely used in Latin music, jazz, and Eastern European folk music.\n\nWith that important distinction made clear, let’s look at some of the best yet most affordable acoustics currently available.\n\nYamaha F335 Acoustic Guitar\n\nAlthough Yamaha is better known for its production of pianos and motorcycles than guitars, the Yamaha F335 is among the world’s best-selling steel-string guitar models. The Yamaha F335 has a full, bassy tone with plenty of resonance, solid playability, and a list price of $159.00. The Yamaha F335 is an incredibly well-rounded guitar for its price, and is a great choice for a player looking for a solid balance tone and playability in their first guitar.\n\nRogue RA-090 Dreadnought Acoustic Guitar\n\nA common first guitar, the Rogue RA-090 Dreadnought is a steel-string acoustic that delivers a bright, snappy tone, great durability and reliable playability, all for the great list price of $99. Due to its low-price and previously mentioned durability, the Rogue RA-090 Dreadnought is also a popular travel guitar among more experienced players and has been stuffed into airport luggage compartments and heard around campfires across the world. Rogue RA-090 Dreadnought is an ideal choice for someone looking for a durable steel-string with a punchy sound at a super affordable price.\n\nYamaha Student Series CGS103AII Classical Guitar\n\nThe second Yamaha to make this list, the Yamaha Student Series CGS103AIl is one of the most common nylon string guitars out there. It’s known for its comfortable, easy-to-grip neck that can be less strenuous on your beginner’s hands than many other guitar models, and its ¾ size makes it a great choice for kids, although the guitar can be comfortably played by adults as well. Yamaha Student Series CGS103AIl is a great choice for players looking easy to play, nylon-string guitar to learn on.\n\nElectric Guitars\n\nThere are quite a few variables that go into electric guitars, and as a result electric guitars can often vary more from model to model than acoustics. If you’d like a more in-depth look at those variables, you can read about it here. That being said, electric guitars generally follow one of two build types. The first build type uses a set of variables (such as longer necks, lighter tonewoods, and often single-coil pickups) to treat a treble-heavy tone with the emphasis on the high end, while the second build type uses the opposite set of variables (shorter necks, heavier tonewoods, and humbuckers) to create a bass-heavy tone with emphasis on the low end.\n\nWhile many electric guitars fall somewhere between the two extremes of this spectrum, the vast majority of electrics on the market will lean more towards one end or the other. Generally speaking, Fender-brand guitars stick pretty strictly to the first mentioned build type, and Gibson brand guitars stick pretty strictly to the second. When buying an electric guitar, it’s all worth remembering that you will also need at least an amplifier and a cable to get started, which means that picking up an electric guitar can be slightly more of a monetary investment than picking up an acoustic.\n\nWith all that in mind, here are a few great starter level electrics.\n\nIbanez GRGR120EX\n\nA perfect first guitar for aspiring shredders, the Ibanez GRGR120EX has many of the features that players love about Ibanez’s higher-end models. These include smooth playability, high-output pickups that are great for distortion, and a whammy bar, all for $199.99. However these guitars don’t have the best clean tones in the world, so they may not be the way to go if you’re looking to play primarily without distortion. The Ibanez GRGR120EX is a great first guitar for players looking to learn to play leads and solos while getting a solid rock tone.\n\nSquier Classic Vibe ’60s Jazzmaster\n\nAlthough the Squier Classic Vibe ’60s Jazzmaster is the priciest guitar included in this list at $399.99, the extra cash is well worth the price for those willing to pay it. Squier is a division of Fender guitars that manufactures their lower-end models, and the Squier Classic Vibe ’60s Jazzmaster captures many of the things guitarists love about the Fender brand in general, and Fender Jazzmaster in particular, including crystalline high-ends and jangly tones. The Squier Classic Vibe ’60s Jazzmaster for those looking for a tone-driven electric with a distinctive, trebly sound.\n\nEpiphone Les Paul Jr.\n\nThe combination of a mahogany Les Paul-style body and a P90 pickup give the Epiphone Les Paul Jr. a great mixture of thick, meaty midrange and nasty, high-end bite for the price of $379. While not the most versatile guitar on this list the Epiphone Les Paul Jr. does what it does remarkably well, and does it when an unmistakable sound. The Epiphone Les Paul Jr. is a great first guitar for players looking for a nasty, in your face electric guitar sound that sounds great with some overdrive.\n\nIn the second edition of How Do I Get THAT Tone, we’re going to examine the gear setups of several of my favorite guitarists. We’re going to go over the guitars, amps, and pedals of some truly wonderful players and investigate how you can imitate their distinctive sound yourself. If interest continues, we may see more of these coming. I’d again like to thank Steve Barber for coming up with this idea in the first place, and if there is another guitarist’s rig you would like to see discussed in a future piece, please reach out to me at ben@nycguitarschool.com.\n\nEddie Van Halen\n\nThe recently late Eddie Van Halen was one of the most influential guitarists in rock. His dazzling taping technique, high speed picking and warbling phaser tones expanded the vocabulary of the electric guitar and the sounds we associate with rock guitar. Although Van Halen is most identified with a handmade guitar named “Frankenstrat”, which used the body and scale length of a Fender Stratocaster, but with a Gibson-style PAF bridge humbucker. While the Frankenstrat itself is obviously not commercially available, replicas are produced by Eddie’s own gear company, EVH. Towards the tail end of his career, Eddie primarily used a Wolfgang USA guitar, which was produced by EVH as well. Eddie primarily used Marshall amplifiers during his early work, but switched by the end had switched to his own brand for amps as well as for guitars.\n\nPedals were an important element to Eddie Van Halen’s iconic tones, and when it came to pedals, he was famously an MXR purist. His usage of MXR pedals was so well established then when surveyed, more than six out of ten guitar players named Eddie the single player they most associated with the brand. Although he used a variety of pedals, the single stompbox most essential to Eddie’s arsenal was the MXR Phase 90, which can be prominently heard on many of Van Halen’s biggest hits. Eddie would later switch to his own signature version of the Phase 90, and the MXR flanger was an important part of his pedalboard as well.\n\nBrittany Howard\n\nAs the frontwoman and guitarist for the soulful southern rock quartet Alabama Shakes, Brittany Howard has established herself as one of the most important figures in rock and roll right now. Her rhythmically tight yet emotionally fluid approach to rhythm guitar has helped set a new standard for bluesy rock players and has become often imitated in only a short amount of time. Her warm, earthy guitar tones are largely created by her use of Gibson SGs, often favoring a white 1963 reissue model that features a third pickup and whammy bar.\n\nHer earthy tones are further emphasized by her use of Orange-brand amplifier cabinets. Her pedal setup is simple, generating her dirtier tones with an Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Pi fuzz pedal, and enhancing her sparkling cleans with a Boss FRV-1 reverb pedal.\n\nFrank Zappa\n\nMy personal all-time favorite guitarist, Frank Zappa merged dense, complicated harmonies, virtuosic musicianship and absurdist lyrics to create some of the most challenging music to ever achieved anywhere near his degree of commercial success. Even though his songs were filled with satirical lyrics about werewolves, pimps, stinky feet and much more, they were always driven by Zappa’s remarkable guitar chops and unique sense of phrasing that borrowed as much from jazz and blues traditions as it did from rock and even avant-garde classical music. Although Zappa used a wide variety of gear throughout his long and prolific career Fender Stratocasters and Gibson SGs were consistent favorites of his, and he could be seen playing various Gibson Les Pauls fairly often as well.\n\nWhile Zappa experimented as much with his amplifier selection as he did with his guitars, the one for which he is best known was a strange little amp made by a company called Pignose. Zappa would often use a tiny Pignose amp, particularly for his work in the early 70s, to create the jagged, fifthly tones that defined his sound for much of that era. Other than Pignose, Zappa was also known to have had an affinity for Marshall amps, often using them when seeking a more conventional electric guitar tone (). Zappa never experimented with quite as many different pedals as he did guitars and amps, and a Mu-Tron wah, Electro-Harmonix Big Muff Pi, and MXR flanger were all consistent parts of his board.\n\nGreg Gonzalez\n\nAs the mastermind of the beloved dream pop band Cigarettes After Sex, Greg Gonzalez’s weightless, chime-like guitar tones have changed the way a whole slew of younger bands consider the role of electric the guitar in an ensemble. His understated, minimalist style leans into the sonic elements he utilizes to create guitar parts that perfectly service whatever it is each song may call for. His distinctive sound is due largely to his near exclusive use of Fly-model guitars, produced by the now-defunct manufacturer Parker. The Fly’s use of carbon fiber in place of traditional hardwood and piezoelectric pickups help create the airy, atypical guitar tones that are at the root of Cigarettes After Sex’s dreamy sound. The Parker Fly’s unusual sound is further exaggerated by Gonzalez’s use of Ampeg SVT amplifiers, Neunaber Stereo Wet Reverb pedal, and a Boss DD-3 Digital Delay pedal.\n\nFREE Guitar Video Course for Beginners\n\n24 Videos, 22 Page PDF, 14 Songs—All FREE.

We’re going to go over the guitars, amps, and pedals of some truly wonderful players and examine how you can imitate their distinctive sound yourself. I’d like to give a big thanks to Steve Barber for the suggestion, and if there is another guitarist’s rig you would like to see discussed in a future piece, please reach out to me at ben@nycguitarschool.com.\n\nJimi Hendrix\n\nArguably the most innovative and influential electric guitarist to ever live, Jimi Hendrix’s unmistakable guitar sound is one of the most imitated of all time. Although he occasionally played other electrics (including a distinctive, hand painted Gibson Flying V), a classic Hendrix tone is largely produced by using a Fender Stratocaster, the instrument with each he is most identified. He would typically keep his Stratocaster set to use both the neck and middle pickups at the same time (also known as position 4). While one can purchase the most recent of many Jimi Hendrix signature Stratocasters released by Fender over the years directly on their website, just about any Stratocaster with a five-way pickup switch should do the trick.\n\nHendrix would typically run his Stratocasters through Marshall amplifier stacks, creating an atypical but effective combo. His iconic fuzz tones were created by his use of Dunlop Fuzz Face pedals, although he experimented with several other fuzz pedals during his lifetime. His famous wah-wah tones, including the one heard on “Voodoo Chile”, were created with a Vox Wah-Wah, and not, as many believe, by a Crybaby Wah. Although the Fuzz Face and the Vox Wah-Wah were Hendrix’s two favorite pedals, the Univox Uni-Vibe and Roger Mayer Octavia were also frequent additions to his setup.\n\nYvette Young\n\nAs the guitarist for the instrumental band Covet, Yvette Young’s piano-like, two-handed approach to the guitar has made her one of the instrument’s key players in recent years. She has made many guitarists, myself included, rethink the way they approach the instrument and a player whom many young players have begun emulating. Her bright, chime-like tone is due in large part to her usage of Ibanez Talman guitars, although she often used Stranberg Boden guitars early in her career. Nowadays she uses her signature Ibanez Talman more or less exclusively, which has the model number YY10.\n\nShe is somewhat of a loyalist to Vox amplifiers, and they have been her main amplifier of choice throughout her career. Young has a wide variety of pedals on her board, although most are from the brands Earthquaker Devices, MXR, and Walrus Audio. Of her many pedals, particularly important ones include the MXR Carbon Copy and the Walrus Audio Julia Analog Chorus/Vibrato, both of which are essential ingredients of her shimmering, dreamy tone.\n\nJimmy Page\n\nAs the guitarist for one of the biggest bands in the universe, Jimmy Page helped define what we think of when we imagine rock guitar. His bloated, swaggering guitar tone was a core element of the sound that made Led Zeppelin who they were. Page’s signature sound was largely achieved by his use of Gibson Les Pauls, although the first Led Zeppelin album recorded entirely with a Fender Telecaster, a guitar which made occasional appearances later in his career as well, and he liked to use Gibson EDS-1275 when he wanted an electric twelve-string tone. But despite the other instruments he occasionally used, a classic two-humbucker Les Paul remains Page’s go-to guitar and the axe to use if you’re looking to mimic some classic Zeppelin tones.\n\nAlthough Page experimented with a wider range of amplifiers than he did guitars, Marshall and Hiwatt amps remained consistent choices for his live performances, both with Led Zeppelin and for his solo performances. However, in the studio he tended to favor Vox-brand amplifiers, meaning that they’re a great choice to try out if you’re more interested in Page’s studio work than his live performances. Jimmy Page didn’t use many pedals in general and hardly any with any degree of consistency, but a notable pedal he did often use was a Tone Bender Fuzz.\n\nB.B. King\n\nNicknamed “The King Of The Blues”, B.B. King’s sweet, rich guitar tone and lyrical phrasing made him one of the most successful artists to ever play the style. But perhaps even more important than his commercial success, King was both one of the most influential blues players and electric guitarists of his generation. His playing was an important inspiration to Eric Clapton, Jimi Hendrix, Billy Gibbons, Gary Clark Jr, The Edge, Carlos Santana, and too many others to list here. B.B. consistently played a Gibson ES-335 throughout his career, the chambered body and bass-oriented sounds of instrument making for an important part of his tone. King eventually collaborated with Gibson to create the Lucille model, a signature Gibson ES-335 modeled off of his beloved black ES-335 of the same name. Just like his consistency with guitars, B.B. King used Fender amplifiers throughout his career and did not use any pedals.\n\nIf you have at least a rudimentary knowledge of the guitar, then there’s a good chance then you’ll have a much easier time picking up a bass than you might think. While bass guitars have bigger frets, longer necks, deeper notes and less strings, the two instruments have much more in common than they have different. Their fretboards are navigated the same way, notes are produced in the same manner, and, perhaps most importantly, their strings are tuned to the same pitches when in standard tuning.\n\nA four string bass guitar, when in standard tuning, is tuned to E-A-D-G. These are the same notes that the bottom four strings of a guitar are typically tuned to (albeit a bass would be tuned to lower versions of those same notes), meaning that a good chunk of the things you already know on guitar can be directly applied to bass. In this piece, we’re going to walk through some simple ways of doing exactly that, as well as understanding how the roles of guitar and bass typically differ and how that can affect your playing on bass.\n\nFinding Root Notes\n\nGuitar, and especially beginner guitar, tends to be a very chord-oriented instrument. While a bass is technically capable of producing chords (any instrument with three or more strings can), the lower pitches and thicker tones of a bass tend to make chords sound pretty muddy when compared to a guitar. This doesn’t mean that bass players don’t play chords at all; in fact, players like Stanley Clarke and Flea are well known for their skilled use of bass chords. But it does mean that chords played on bass are far less common than chords on guitar, and are a significantly smaller part of the world of bass.\n\nInstead, a bassist will approach a chord progression by examining the individual pitches that make up each chord. Because of this, your average bassist will often have a bit more music theory chops than your average guitarist, but not knowing music theory doesn’t have to be any sort of barrier to picking up bass. We’re now going to examine a super simple concept that will let you play bass lines over chord progression.\n\nLet’s start with one of the most common chord progressions there is: C, F, Am, G. If you have a guitar on hand, try strumming through that progression using your common open chord shapes. If you need a refresher on what any of those shapes are, refer to the charts below.\n\nNow try playing that chord progression with the basic strum pattern, devoting exactly one whole measure to each chord. To anyone unfamiliar with the term, a basic strum is a strumming pattern consisting of one quarter note, followed by two eighth notes, which is then repeated as necessary. You can see that whole thing in notation and guitar tablature here:\n\nOnce you’ve got that pattern down, we’re now going to try deconstructing those chords a little bit. The most common thing for a bassist, and especially a beginning bassist, to do when presented with a chord progression is to play something called the root note in place of each chord. The root note is the individual note that gives any given chord its name. For most chords that you likely know, including all the chords listed above, the root note is the note on the very bottom end of the chord.\n\nThis means that in order to find the root notes for the above progression, simply find the lowest pitched note in each chord. The lowest pitched note will be whatever note you are playing on the thickest string involved in each chord. Now try and find the root notes for each chord in the progression above. Once you’ve found them, try playing through the progression, using the same rhythmic pattern as before, but only playing the root notes instead of the full chord.\n\nIf you correctly figured out the root notes, then you should be playing the following:\n\nThat above pattern is exactly how a beginning bass player would approach that chord progression. If you have a bass guitar on hand, try playing that same exact pattern, except now on an actual bass. You can see it in notation and bass tablature here:\n\nAdding Passing Tones\n\nWhile simply playing the root notes of the chords can get you through just about any progression on bass, adding something called passing tones can help flesh out your playing into fully realized bass lines. Passing tones are notes that do not actually occur in the chords you are playing over, but help your line flow melodically. Well placed passing tones can turn a merely functional bass line into a great one.\n\nPassing tones can be just about any note you can imagine outside those in the chord, which means that you have lots of freedom when picking them. While this freedom can be pretty exciting, it can also be pretty daunting at, so we’re going to learn an easy formula for adding passing tones to help get you started.\n\nFor this formula, we’re going to start with the same concept of playing root notes as described above. We are going to then add passing tones by substituting the very last root note we would play on each chord for the new passing tone. In order to find what note that passing tone is going to be, we are going to find a note called the seventh. The seventh is a relative term, as what note it is determined by the context of what we are currently playing on. Due to this, it is worth mentioning that we are going to be finding the seventh of the chord to arrive on, and not the seventh of the chord we are currently still on.\n\nTo find the seventh of a chord, first locate that chord’s root note. Then, if that chord is a major chord, count down one fret from that root note. That note that you’re currently on is that chord’s seventh. If the chord is either a minor chord or a dominant chord, do the same exact thing, but instead count down two frets. If that chord’s root note is an open string, then it’s seventh is the 4th fret on the string below it (as in the thicker string) if it’s a major chord, or the 3rd fret on the string below it if it’s either a minor or a dominant chord. If the root note is the open 6th string (as is the case for both the open E and E minor chords), then unfortunately this trick doesn’t quite work for those specific voicings of those chords.\n\nFor example, let’s go back to that open C chord that we played early. As we now know, the root note of that chord is the 3rd fret on the 5th string. So therefore, we would count down one fret from the 3rd fret on the 5th string, which would bring us to the 2nd fret on the 5th string. That note is the seventh of C. The following F chord would follow the same exact pattern as that C chord we just examined, so let’s skip ahead a little bit for this example and go to the A-minor chord.\n\nAs the root note of the A-minor chord is the open 5th string, we’ll have to go down to the 6th string to find that chord’s seventh. As it’s also a minor chord, we know that it’s root can be found on the 3rd fret of that string, so seventh of the A-minor chord can be found on the 3rd fret of the 6th string.\n\nNow that we’ve found the sevenths for the C and A-minor chords together, try applying that formula to the two remaining chords in our original progression, which are the F and G chords. It is also important to note that in the case of the example above, the G chord should be treated as a dominant chord, and not a major chord. This is because it is filling the harmonic role of a dominant chord, even if we’re not playing it as such, but we don’t need to worry about exactly why that is just yet.\n\nOnce you’ve found all four sevenths, insert them into the above tablature for that progression. Remember that we’re swapping out the very root note of each measure for the passing tones, and that we’re inserting the seventh for the upcoming chord, not the chord we just finished. This means that the passing tone used at the very end of the measure of C is going to be seventh of the F chord, not the seventh of the C chord.\n\nOnce you’ve gotten that all figured out, trying playing that full pattern on bass. If you don’t have a bass handy, try instead playing the pattern on guitar, since the concepts will still be the same. If you figured everything out correctly, you should be playing this pattern:\n\nAnd there you have it, a bassline complete with passing tones built over one of the most common chord progressions in all of music! While these simple concepts obviously just scratch the surface of both applying your guitar skills to bass and bass playing in general, they’re a great place to start jamming on bass with, and will be able to get you surprisingly far.\n\nWhile guitar amplifiers can greatly differ by individual model, most brands of amplifiers have a set of tones and capabilities associated with its name. In part three of this guide to amplifiers, we’re going to explore some of the biggest amplifier brands on the market and go over what you can expect from each one. If you are unsure about the differences between tube amps and digital amps or what different amplifier specs mean, then please feel free to check out parts one and two from this series. While of course there are more notable amplifier brands than I’m able to go over there, the following four are among the most notable and most beloved.\n\nMarshall\n\nProbably the single brand most associated with amplifiers, Marshall made a name for themselves as the first widely available amplifier with built-in overdrive capabilities. Marshall amps have a distinct sound that is full but also crisp, and are particularly known for their crunchy overdrive tones. Marshall guitarists are primarily identified with rock (and particularly hard rock) players, but also have wide usage among blues and metal guitarists.\n\nNotable Marshall players include Jimi Hendrix, Led Zeppelin’s Jimmy Page, Alice Cooper guitarist Nita Strauss, all three Iron Maiden guitarists, Code Orange guitarist Reba Meyers, Slash, Slayer guitarist Kerry King, Joe Satriani, Lita Ford, Halestorm guitarist, and frontwoman Lzzy Hale, and AC/DC’s Angus Young, among many others.\n\nIf you don’t count the nifty, micro-sized travel amps that Marshall manufacturers, then the cheapest Marshall currently on the marker is the Marshall MG10G 10W 1×6.5 Guitar Combo Amp with a price tag of $89.99. If you don’t mind spending a little more, my personal recommendation with Marshall is the Marshall DSL1HR 1W Tube Guitar Amp Head, which costs $299.99. Although just an amp head (meaning you will have to purchase the speaker cabinet separately), the Marshall DSL1HR packs plenty of classic Marshall tone for a relatively affordable price.\n\nFender\n\nAlthough Fender is most commonly identified with their iconic line of electric guitars, Fender founder Leo Fender actually began building amps before he began building guitars. Although Fender-brand guitars eventually overtook their amplifiers in terms of popularity, Fender amplifiers remain among the most popular and beloved in the guitar-playing world. Just like their electric guitars, Fender amplifiers have a sparkling high-end tone that produces a jangly, chime-like quality.\n\nBecause of their similar qualities, Fender amps pair famously well with Fender guitars, something worth considering if you’re a Fender player yourself. Fender amps are used heavily in just about all styles of guitar music, with especially common use in blues, country, and rock. Notable Fender amp users include B.B. King, Susan Tedeschi, Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards, St. Vincent, U2 guitarist The Edge, Stevie Ray Vaughn, and Heart guitarist Nancy Wilson.\n\nOther than Fender’s casual travel-oriented MINI-amp series (of which there are four currently on the market), the cheapest Fender amp currently out there is the Frontman 10G, which only costs $69.99. Although there it has a significant uptick in price from the remarkably cheap Frontman 10G, my personal recommendation for Fender amps is a small tube amp called The Blues Junior IV, which will run you $599.99 if bought directly from Fender.\n\nOrange\n\nAlthough probably best known for the bright orange outer layer that has become their signature, Orange amps just might have the highest level of devotion among their users of any brand out there. Although Orange amps are used in a wide variety of styles, their distinct fat, buzzy tone and thundering built-in distortion has made them a favorite amp among doom/sludge metal players over the world. The player most identified with Orange amps is likely Sleep and High On Fire guitarist Matt Pike, who has become famous for the massive wall of Orange amps he lugs to almost all of his performances. Other notable Orange players include Grateful Dead guitarist Bob Weir, Marcus King, Michael Jackson guitarist Orianthi, Frank Iero of My Chemical Romance, Jay Som, Mastodon guitarist Brent Hinds, Beyonce guitarist Francesca Simone, and Slipknot’s Jim Root.\n\nOrange miniature amplifiers are unusually strong when compared to other brands’ similarly-sized offerings, and are even able to hold their own against other low-end but larger amps. The cheapest of these miniature amplifiers is the Crush Mini 3W 1×4 Guitar Combo Amp at $69.00, and the cheapest Orange amp the next size up is the Crush12 12W 1×6 Guitar Combo Amp, which cost slightly a little more at $99.00. While both of those amps are very solid options for their price, my personal recommendation to those with the cash to spend is the Rocker 15 15W 1×10 Tube Guitar Combo, a compact but powerful tube amp with a price tag of $799.\n\nVox\n\nAlthough also a manufacturer of guitars, electric organs, and pedals, among other things, Vox is nowadays best known for its amplifiers. Vox amps have a similar sound to Fender, also producing treble-heavy, chime-like tones, but to a further extreme. Vox amps are particularly known for their crystal clean tones. Notable Vox players include Beatles guitarists John Lennon and George Harrison, Tom Petty, Covet guitarist Yvette Young, John Scofield, Radiohead guitarist Johnny Greenwood, Clare Dunn, Joe Walsh, Grace Potter, Elvis Costello, Hozier, Oasis guitarist Noel Gallagher, and Tame Impala mastermind Kevin Parker.\n\nThe cheapest proper Vox amp currently on the market is the Vox Pathfinder 10 Guitar Combo Amp and will only run you $89.99. My personal recommendation with Vox amps would be for the Vox Pathfinder 10 Guitar Combo Amp, a strong tube amp that costs $499.99.\n\nIf there’s another amplifier brand that you would like to see profiled here, or another guitar/music-related topic that you’d like to see featured in one of these pieces, please feel free to reach out to me at benfittsguitar@gmail.com.\n\nAlthough the main defining characteristic among amplifiers is whether they are tube or digital (a topic you can read about here in part one of this series), there are a wide variety of other factors to consider as well when purchasing an amp. In part two of this guide to amplifiers, we are going to go over what the main different specs mean and what variables might be right for you. It’s worth noting that there are many specs that we won’t go into in this piece, but that’s because most of the little specs mentioned are pretty inconsequential. Most guitar amps will mention what input they take, but you’d be hard pressed to find one other than a ¼” cable, and it won’t make a difference in your tone whether your amp’s outer layer is vinyl or tweed.\n\nCabinets vs. Combos\n\nAny amp on the market is going to either be a cabinet or a combo. A simple but important distinction, a cabinet amp is one where the speaker and the controls are sold separately while on a combo amp they come built together as a single unit. An amp cabinet allows you to mix and match combinations, thus giving you more control over your tone and often more raw power to work with. However, as both necessary parts are sold separately, buying an amp cabinet will often cost significantly more than a comparable combo amp, an element that is only magnified by the fact that most cabinets currently on the market are on the high-end of things as is.\n\nWhile combo amps lack the flexibility of creating your own cabinet, they have the advantage of being a fully functional unit in and of themselves. This means that if you buy a combo amp, it is the only purchase you’ll need to make in order to start playing right then and there (assuming that you have something to plug into it). Additionally, combo amps tend to run for far less money than amp cabinets and much more convenient to travel with.\n\nWattage\n\nA watt is a unit of measurement that quantifies power and has wide usage outside of musical equipment. Within the world of guitar amps, wattage refers to the amount of electric power that drives an amplifier’s speaker. Simply put, higher wattage means a louder maximum volume. However, it’s worth noting that tube amps can achieve significantly more power than digital amps with the same amount of electricity, and a result will have a much lower wattage than a digital amp with a comparable output.\n\nAlthough these exact parameters are a bit subjective, generally a tube amplifier up to 20 watts or a digital amplifier up to about 30 watts can be considered low wattage, a tube amplifier of about 20 to 40 watts or a digital amplifier of 30 to 100 watts can be considered medium wattage, and a tube amplifier of 40 to 100 watts or a digital amplifier of 100 to 200 watts can be considered high wattage. Although there are both tube and digital amplifiers on the market that exceed these parameters, that amount of wattage is generally unnecessary unless you’re playing to arenas.\n\nBy reading what’s written above, you may be thinking to yourself that you’d want an amp with a high wattage, and you may not necessarily be wrong. However, there is more to consider than simply high wattage versus low wattage. For starters, amps with high wattage are almost always going to be larger and will usually be more expensive. This means that when looking at wattage, the main thing to consider is what it is that you will be using this amp for.\n\nIf you’re looking for an amp to use in a live setting, particularly within the context of something along the lines of a loud rock band where volume is important, then a high wattage amp is probably what you’re looking for. However, if you are looking for a bedroom, practice, or recording amp where the ability to achieve high volumes isn’t particularly important, then it may make sense to get an amp with lower wattage. As higher wattage amps tend to be more expensive, you can often get an all-around nicer amp with lower wattage for around the same price as a higher wattage amp that doesn’t quite stack up in other ways. Additionally, as higher-wattage amps are often physically larger, lower wattage amps tend to be more convenient for such things as storage and travel.\n\nControls\n\nOne of the more self-explanatory specs we’ll be going over, controls refer to what elements of the amp’s tone can be controlled with knobs. When looking over an amplifier’s spec sheet, the controls section will generally consist of a simple list of the knob’s labels. A typical one of these lists may look like the following: Volume, Gain, Bass, Middle, Treble, Reverb. This would mean that those are knobs that could be found on this hypothetical amplifier, and thus the elements of its sound that you would be able to fiddle with.\n\nWhen looking at an amp’s controls, it is perhaps more important which controls are missing rather than which ones are present. For example, if an amp does not have reverb listed as a control, then it’s probably safe to assume that that amp does have reverb capabilities, so make sure that an amp has a control for every element you’re hoping for it to have.\n\nEffects\n\nWhile this is a bit too broad of a topic to fully do justice here, it’s worth noting some amplifiers will come with built-in effects of the sort that one can get from a pedal. Although many tube amps come with built-in analog reverb and natural overdrive effects, and some come with a built-in tremolo effect, for the most part, built-in effects are associated with digital amps. Most digital amps will have some degree of built-in digital overdrive/distortion, and some have built-in versions of less common effects, such as delay and modulators. An amp with built-in effects can be a great way to have fun and experiment with new sounds, but the sounds of built-in amps effects typically won’t stack up in terms of quality to those found in a pedal, and built-in amp effects are very rarely used among professionals.\n\nSpeakers\n\nThe final element that we are going to talk about is also one of the most important. A guitar amp’s speakers are exactly what they sound like, and I don’t think that we really need to spend time getting into what a speaker is. However, something that is less commonly known is that smaller amplifier speakers produce tones with more clarity in their treble frequencies, and larger amplifier speakers produce tones with more clarity in their bass frequencies. 10” speakers will provide sharp, treble-leaning tones while still being large to create volume required by most live music situations, while 15” are the standard size speakers for players interested in bassier tones. 12” speakers make for a happy medium between the two, and are the most common-size speakers among amps currently on the market. Smaller sized speakers (specifically 6” and 8” speakers) can also be found, but they typically aren’t powerful enough for live situations where one may have to compete with other instruments.\n\nAlthough there are a lot of factors that go into determining what amplifier is right for you, there is one specific element that arguably makes as much of a difference as all of the others combined. Is it a tube amp, or is it digital? This will affect the amp’s tone, capabilities, all-around convenience, and often price. In this piece, we’re going to go over the differences between tube amplifiers and digital amplifiers so you can figure out which one is best for you.\n\nTube Amps\n\nTube amplifiers, also known as valve amplifiers, are the original kind of guitar amplifier. Tube amplifiers use vacuum tube analog technology to create warm, rich guitar tones that are just about impossible to replicate digitally. Additionally, when turned up loud enough tube amplifiers can create a sweet-sounding, natural overdrive tone that some players prefer to anything that they can get out of a pedal. The richer tones of tube amplifiers are still generally regarded as superior to the colder tones of digital amps, although there are many out there who would passionately disagree with that statement, and have thus remained the standard choice in amplifiers among most working professionals. Tube amps are, however, still not without their drawbacks.\n\nAmong many, the main concern with tube amplifiers is their lack of ability to be played at a considerate volume. Due to their analog technology, the lowest audible volume tube amps can produce is often still rather loud. Additionally, tube amplifiers often produce different quality tones at different volumes, and need to be turned up pretty high in order to realize their full sonic potential. This issue is particularly prevalent among Fender-brand tube amps. This can make them inconvenient as practice amps, especially among people who live with others or in urban areas, as they can impede one’s ability to practice while amplified at odd hours or to play at low volumes in general.\n\nAdditionally, tube amplifiers are fragile, heavy, can require difficult and often expensive maintenance, and are often more expensive than their digital counterparts. While tube amplifiers have a great sound that digital amps are still unable to authentically reproduce, they are ultimately the less convenient option. Personally, I’d recommend a digital amplifier for live performances, recording, and other professional-oriented uses, but they can be a bit of a hassle for a bedroom/practice amp.\n\nDigital Amps\n\nDigital amplifiers, more commonly referred to as solid-state amplifiers, became a serious challenger to tube amplifiers in the mid-1970s. Their circuit-oriented construct allows them to generate the same quality tone at all volume levels, and their crisp, cold tone allows for great note clarity, which has made them a favorite among many jazz and metal players alike. Additionally, many digital amplifiers come equipped with built-in effect options, which allows players to explore different sonic qualities without necessarily having to buy any effect pedals (although it is worth noting that the quality of built-in amplifier effects typically pales when compared to a decent pedal of the same type). Furthermore, digital amplifiers tend to be sturdy, easy to travel with, and are relatively low cost.\n\nHowever, as previously alluded to, digital amplifiers have a thinner, less defined tone than tube amplifiers, which is why many guitarists still prefer the original. For all the perks and improved convenience that come with digital amps, at the end of the day, the main purpose of carefully selecting what gear you buy is to produce the best sound possible and for many players, the sound of digital amplifiers simply doesn’t cut it. The convenience of digital amplifiers makes them generally ideal for practice amps where function is more important than tone, and if you’re in the minority of players who happen to prefer the sound of digital amps to tube amps, then choosing to go digital should be a no-brainer.\n\nWhile most amplifiers currently on the market can be classified as either tube or digital, it is worth noting that hybrids do exist. These hybrids exist in different forms, but generally either involve a tube-based preamp feeding into a circuit based output, or a circuit-based preamp feeding into a tube-powered output. Hybrid amplifiers manage to combine the best of both worlds without quite managing to consistently pull off either extreme, which positions them as an odd middle-ground. Generally speaking, a good hybrid amplifier will capture some of the gusto of a tube amp and some of the convenience of a digital amp, which makes them a great choice for those who really feel torn between the two.\n\nStay tuned for more blogs about amplifiers and choosing the right one for you!\n\nWhen you first learned to play guitar, you were probably taught to strum each chord as a whole, singular unit. While that’s a perfectly valid way to approach the instrument, it can be somewhat limiting if it’s the only you ever strum. You can open yourself up to whole new worlds of playing by simply breaking your strumming pattern on chord shapes that already know. While there are many ways to go about doing this, a concept known as “bass note strumming” is both one of the most common and one of the easiest to start with. Bass note strumming is a great way to get started with a whole new approach to playing chords, and something that doesn’t take much time to learn at all.\n\nGetting Started\n\nBass note strumming is exactly what it sounds like: strumming centered around the bass note. When playing a bass note strum, you are going to alternate between picking just the bass note of any given chord (as in the lowest pitched note in that chord), then the rest of the chord. Don’t worry if that concept feels a little abstract right now, we’re about to get into a hands-on example.\n\nTry finding your basic, open C-chord shape. Once you’ve found it, pick just the bass note of the chord, which is the 3rd fret on the 5th string. Now try playing the rest of the chord, as in the entire C-chord minus the bass note that you just played. This means that when I say “rest of the chord”, I am referring to the notes played on the 4th, 3rd, 2nd, and 1st strings, but not the note played on the 5th string. Once you’ve played the rest of the chord, go back to that bass note and give it a strum. Then strum the rest of the chord again. Then go back to the bass note and so on. Once spent some time getting used to alternating between strumming just the bass note and then just the rest of the chord, trying playing it at a steady, quarter-note rhythm, strumming entirely with downstrokes.\n\nYou can see all of that written out in tab and standard notation here:\n\nAnd you’re doing it! You’re now playing a simple, bass note strumming pattern. But while this is a great start to bass note strumming, there’s still far more that one could do with the technique.\n\nMoving Bass Notes\n\nPlaying a bass note strum with moving bass notes is a common and easy way to embellish what we just learned above. Moving bass notes means that we are going to play almost exactly what we played above, except that when it becomes time to strum the bass note, we won’t necessarily always strum the same note. This will often mean having to reach a little bit outside of our conventional chord shapes. While there a lot of ways of determining which new notes to go to when playing with moving bass notes, the typical way is by using a concept called moving in fifths.\n\nMoving in fifths means that when it’s time to strum the bass note, you alternate between strumming the bass note naturally in the chord, and strumming a new note that is something called it’s fifth. Luckily we don’t need to go into the theory behind moving in fifths right now, the reason being that, on guitar, the application of the concept is a lot simpler than the theory behind it. In order to find a note’s fifth, simply play the note on the same fret as your original note, but one string thicker. This means in that are above example, where our bass note was the 3rd fret on the 5th string, that note’s fifth is the 3rd fret on the 6th string.\n\nTake a moment to go back and forth between our original bass note (the 3rd fret on the 5th string), and that notes fifth 3rd fret on (the 6th string). Now try playing those two notes in a solid, quarter note rhythm like this:\n\nIf you can do that, then you’re almost there! While you’re not quite playing a bass note strum at the moment, you are correctly moving the bass notes in fifths. Once you having the moving bass notes down, try playing the rest of that C-chord shape between each bass note, as we did earlier. Still keep a steady quarter-note rhythm, and play will all downstrokes. The only new variable from that first exercise we tried should be the introduction of the moving bass notes. Here is all of that written out in notation:\n\nNow you’re playing the full technique. However, there are obviously a lot more chords other than just C, so let’s try taking the same concept and applying to other chord shapes. Find your open F-chord shape and do to it exactly what we just did the C-chord, finding its bass note, the bass note’s fifth, and then playing the whole thing with the same pattern we just went over. If you did all of that correctly, you should be playing this:\n\nOnce you’ve got that concept down solid on the F-chord shape, try going back and forth with that pattern between the C-chord and F-chord shapes. You can see what that should look like written out here:\n\nNow with all of the being said, there is still one major caveat the concept described above. Trying applying this concept of moving fifths to a typical, open G-chord, and you’ll see what I mean. Unless you’re playing a guitar with seven or more strings, you’ll have trouble moving the bass note down a string to find the fifth. This is because on the G-chord, the starting bass note is already on the thickest string, which leaves nowhere else to go. However, there is an easy workaround to this problem.\n\nIf you find yourself trying to apply moving bass notes to a chord where your starting bass note is already on the 6th string, instead simply start with the second lowest-pitched note in the chord as your bass note. This means that on an open G-chord, your starting bass note is going to be the 2nd fret on the 5th string instead of the 3rd fret of the 6th string. Then, when it would ordinarily be time to move the bass note to the fifth, instead play the original bass note of the chord, which in this case would be the 3rd fret of the 6th string.\n\nYou can see that in notation here:\n\nWhile you are no longer technically moving in fifths when using this workaround, it will still work in most musical contexts and captures the feel of moving in fifths well enough to blend in with the rest of your chords.\n\nWhile there are far more ways to break up strumming than just bass note strumming and far more ways to play a bass note strum than just moving in fifths, the information in this piece is a great way to get started on both those concepts and to approach strumming the guitar in a whole new way.\n\nThanks for reading!
