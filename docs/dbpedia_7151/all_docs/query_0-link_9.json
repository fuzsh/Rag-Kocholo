        "text": "Some historians of mathematics have questioned the association of the â product with Kronecker's name on the grounds that there is no known evidence in the literature for Kronecker's priority in its discovery or use. Indeed, Sir Thomas Muir's authoritative history [3] calls det(AâB)det (A \\otimes B)det(AâB) the 'Zehfuss determinant' of A and B because the determinant identity\n\nâ£AâBâ£=â£Aâ£nâ£Bâ£m| A \\otimes B | = | A |^{n} | B |^{m}â£AâBâ£=â£Aâ£nâ£Bâ£m\n\nappears first in an 1858 paper of Johann Georg Zehfuss (\"Ãber eine gewisse Determinante â, Zeitschrift fÃ¼r Mathematik und Physik 3 (1858), 298-301\"). Following Muir's lead, a few later authors have called A â B the 'Zehfuss matrix' of A and B, for example \"D E Rutherford, On the Condition that two Zehfuss matrices be equal, Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 39 (1933), 801-808\", and \"A C Aitken, The normal form of compound and induced matrices, Proc. London Math. Soc 38 (2) (1935), 354-376\". However, a series of influential texts at and after the turn of the century permanently associated Kronecker's name with the â product, and this terminology is nearly universal today. For further discussion (including claims by others to independent discovery of the determinant result) and numerous references, see \"H V Henderson, F Pukelsheim and S R Searle, On the history of the Kronecker product, Linear and Multilinear Algebra 14 (2) (1983), 113-120\".\n\nOur story begins with one Johann Georg Zehfuss (1832-1901) at the University of Heidelberg who, according to biographical notes by Poggendorf (1863, 1898), published papers on determinants until at least 1868 before moving to studies in astronomy. In particular, Zehfuss (1858) contains the determinant result\n\nâ£AâBâ£=â£Aâ£bâ£Bâ£a| A \\otimes B | = | A |^{b} | B |^{a}â£AâBâ£=â£Aâ£bâ£Bâ£a\n\nfor square matrices A and B of order a and b, respectively. Zehfuss wrote in terms of determinants rather than matrices, following the then customary practice of employing the term 'determinant' both for what we now call a square matrix as well as for its determinant. ... Unfortunately, the Zehfuss (1858) determinant result seems to have been overlooked for more than fifty years, until its rediscovery by Muir (1911, reprinted in [3]) who claims it for Zehfuss and accordingly calls â£AâBâ£| A \\otimes B |â£AâBâ£ the Zehfuss determinant of A and B. Others, notably Rutherford (1933), and Aitken (1935) and his student Ledermann (1936), following Muir's lead, have gone further and called A â\\otimesâ B the Zehfuss matrix of A and B. Aitken's adoption of this name is of interest in light of Ledermann's later (1968) comment that Aitken \"was particularly fond of stressing the claims of lesser known mathematicians of former times for discoveries erroneously attributed to their more famous contemporaries. Many of his historical references were gleaned from Sir Thomas Muir's monumental work on determinants, for which Aitken had a profound admiration.\"\n\nAlthough Zehfuss is best known for his contributions to determinants, he made other contributions to mathematics in difference equations, differential and integral calculus and combinatorics. Later in his career, however, his attention turned more towards physics and astronomy. He actively participated in the annual meetings of the"
