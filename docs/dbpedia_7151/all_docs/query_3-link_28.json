        "text": "1472\n\nDuke Ludwig IX der Reiche founds the \"Hohe Schule\" (high school) in Bavaria in Ingolstadt: the Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich (LMU).\n\nThe LMU has produced 34 Nobel Prize winners, among others.\n\n1760\n\nGeorg Ludwig Claudius Rousseau, city pharmacist in Ingolstadt, teaches \"Chemistry of animal, vegetable and mineral substances\" in the pharmacy laboratory. In 1776, he was appointed full professor of chemistry and pharmaceutical science, and in 1789 he was elected rector of the university. He was succeeded in 1794 by Georg Augustin Bertele, surgeon and city pharmacist in Amberg.\n\n1800\n\nElector Max IV Joseph von Bayern (later King Maximilian I) moves the \"Hohe Schule\" from Ingolstadt to Landshut.\n\n1807\n\nThe Bavarian Academy of Sciences, founded in 1758, establishes a Chemistry Section in Munich. The physician and pharmacist Adolph Ferdinand Gehlen is appointed head. In 1815, the Academy begins building a chemical laboratory in Munich. A. F. Gehlen dies of arsenic hydrogen poisoning. The Paris-trained chemist Heinrich August Vogel becomes his successor.\n\n1808\n\nEdict on the medical profession in Bavaria: pharmacists must study for two years.\n\n1818\n\nJohann Andreas Buchner, pharmacist in Munich, is appointed Professor of Pharmacy, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science at the \"Hohe Schule\" in Landshut.\n\n1826\n\nKing Ludwig I orders the transfer of the university, later named after Duke Ludwig der Reiche and King Maximilian I, from Landshut to Munich.\n\n1826\n\nJohann Andreas Buchner is transferred from Landshut to Munich. From 1830, he teaches pharmaceutical chemistry in a privately financed institute and in 1840 moves into an institute with a laboratory and lecture hall in the main university building on Ludwigstrasse. In 1842, he is elected rector of Ludwig Maximilian University.\n\n1852\n\nJustus von Liebig, then Germany's best-known chemist, was appointed from Giessen to the chair of chemistry in Munich and was given a new institute building at Sophienstrasse and Arcisstrasse.\n\nAmong Liebig's doctoral students were:\n\nFriedrich August Kekule von Stradonitz,\n\nAugust Wilhelm von Hofmann,\n\nEmil Erlenmeyer and\n\nAdolph Strecker.\n\n1870\n\nThe chemical laboratory under the direction of Adolf von Baeyer.\n\n1875\n\nTwo years after Liebig's death, Adolf von Baeyer is appointed full professor of chemistry. The institute, which now also has an inorganic department in addition to the organic department, develops into Germany's best-known chemistry school after being expanded under Baeyer's leadership. Baeyer was ennobled in 1885 and received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1905 for work on organic dyes.\n\n1877\n\nBaeyer's large working group includes many students who are later honored as outstanding scientists, e.g.\n\nEmil Fischer (Nobel price for chemistry 1902),\n\nEduard Buchner (Nobel price for chemistry1907),\n\nRichard WillstÃ¤tter (Nobel price for chemistry 1915) and\n\nHeinrich Wieland (Nobel price for chemistry 1927).\n\n1892\n\nChemistry and pharmacy move from the medical to the philosophical faculty.\n\n1892\n\nAlbert Hilger is appointed to the chair of pharmaceutical chemistry by Erlangen and receives a new institute building in KarlstraÃe. In 1894, an \"Anstalt fÃ¼r Nahrungs- und Genussmittel\" (institute for food and beverages) is added.\n\n1893\n\nGroup picture of the members of the Chemical Institute. In addition to the two Nobel Prize winners Baeyer and WillstÃ¤tter, you can see, among others:\n\nWalter Dieckmann (\"Dieckmann condensation\"),\n\nJohannes Thiele (\"Thiele hypothesis of Partial valences\") and\n\nVictor Villiger (\"Baeyer-Villiger oxidation\").\n\n1897\n\nFollowing Baeyer's proposals, the \"Verbandsexamen\" (association examination) is introduced for all chemistry students in the German Reich.\n\n1905\n\nAdolf von Baeyer receives the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\n\n1915\n\nA. v. Baeyer resigns and Richard WillstÃ¤tter, Baeyer's student and director at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry in Berlin, is appointed full professor of chemistry and director of the \"chemical laboratory of the state. WillstÃ¤tter receives the 1915 Nobel Prize for Chemistry in the same year for research on plant dyes. The chemical institute is enlarged and modernized.\n\n1916\n\na \"Gerichtlich-Chemische Untersuchungsstelle\" (forensic chemical testing laboratory) and a \"Forschungsanstalt fÃ¼r Lebensmittelchemie\" (research institute for food chemistry) are established.\n\n1924\n\nWillstÃ¤tter resigns as director of the institute because of anti-Semitic tendencies in the university and emigrates to Switzerland in 1939.\n\n1926\n\nWillstÃ¤tter was succeeded by Heinrich Wieland, a Baeyer student and director of the Chemical Institute in Freiburg. Wieland was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1927 (for work on bile acids).\n\n1932\n\nWarsaw-born Kasimir Fajansbecomes head of the Institute for Physical Chemistry on Sophienstrasse, built with the help of the Rockefeller Foundation. In 1935 he is dismissed because he is Jewish, and in 1936 he is expatriated.\n\n1935\n\nA pharmacognostic institute (\"Institut fÃ¼r Pharmazeutische Arzneimittellehre\") is established in KarlstraÃe.\n\n1937\n\nChemistry and pharmacy move from the Faculty of Philosophy to the Faculty of Science.\n\n1938\n\nthe administration of the \"Chemical Laboratory of the Academy of Sciences\" is taken over by the University.\n\n1939\n\nEstablishment of a diploma program chemistry.\n\n1944\n\nThe chemical and pharmaceutical institutes are destroyed by bombs.\n\n1946\n\nTeaching and research are taken up on a makeshift basis.\n\n1948\n\nEugen Bamann, WillstÃ¤tter's student, is appointed head of the Institute of Pharmacy and Food Chemistry in Munich. Research and teaching are housed in makeshift quarters in various parts of the city.\n\n1950\n\nHeinrich Wieland becomes professor emeritus. By 1953, four chairs are established and filled:\n\nGeorg-Maria Schwab (Physical Chemistry),\n\nEgon Wiberg (Anorganic Chemistry),\n\nRolf Huisgen (Organic Chemistry, Wieland student, later most cited German chemist) and\n\nFeodor Lynen (Biochemistry, Nobel Prize 1964), who became director of the Max Planck Institute for Cell Chemistry in 1954.\n\n1954 - 1958\n\nfour new institutes (organic, inorganic, physical chemistry and biochemistry) are built between KarlstraÃe and SophienstraÃe.\n\n1957 - 1959\n\nNew buildings for the \"Institute of Pharmacy and Food Chemistry\" and the \"Institute of Pharmaceutical Pharmacy\" are erected between Sophienstrasse and Karlstrasse.\n\n1964\n\nFeodor Lynen receives the Nobel Prize in Medicine\n\n1973\n\nErnst Otto Fischer receives the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\n\nErnst Otto Fischer worked at the LMU from 1959 to 1964, first as an associate professor and then as a full professor.\n\n1999 - 2004\n\nRelocation of the Faculty of Chemistry and Pharmacy to the \"Campus GroÃhadern/Martinsried\" on the western edge of Munich.\n\nEstablishment of a Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry with the teaching areas of inorganic, organic, and physical chemistry as well as biochemistry.\n\nEstablishment of a Department of Pharmacy - Center for Pharmaceutical Research with the teaching areas of pharmaceutical chemistry, pharmaceutical biology, pharmaceutical technology and biopharmacy, and pharmacology for natural sciences.\n\n2004\n\nEstablish a bachelor's/master's degree program in Pharmaceutical Sciences.\n\n2020"
