        "text": "Reference: Ancestry Genealogy - SmartCopy: Jan 3 2017, 22:02:23 UTC\n\nFrom the Cleveland Jewish News Jan 14, 1977\n\nSpeakers Reminisce at Telshe Banquet\n\n100 Years of Torah Scholarship\n\nCelebrating the close of its centennial year, Telshe Yeshiva held its annual Scholarship Fund banquet last Sunday night, attracting several hundred guests, many from communities throughout the country.\n\nThe event was held at Taylor Road Synagogue, and featured as honored guests Mr. and Mrs. Adolph Beren of Marietta, Ohio.\n\nLong-time supporters of Telshe Yeshiva, the Berens were helpful in providing assistance to Rabbi E. M. Bloch when the latter arrived in the U.S. together with Rabbi Chaim M. Katz during the tragic days of World War II. In the face of devastation of the old Telshe Yeshiva in Lithuania, the two rabbinical leaders were determined to establish a new yeshiva in the U.S.\n\nAdolph Beren travelled through Southern Ohio and in neighboring Parkersburg, W. Va., to seek funds for this undertaking.\n\nSince that time the Berens have continued to be of material assistance to the yeshiva. Rabbi Abba Zalka Gewirtz, vice president of the yeshiva, made a presentation of a plaque to the Berens.\n\nAnnouncement was also made that the couple have arranged to institute a fund to be known as the Aaron Zev and Liebe Rasche Beren Scholarship Fund (named for Adolph Beren's parents) to foster and promote the development of rabbinic authorities in Torah law. The fund will be in memory of the late roshei yeshiva, Rabbi E. M. Bloch and Rabbi Chaim M. Katz.\n\nIn his response to the tribute, Adolph Beren reminisced about the dark days of 1942, when Rabbi Bloch came to the little southern Ohio town of Marietta to seek funds for the rebuilding of Telshe in the U.S. Beren contrasted the very humble beginnings at that point with the modern well-appointed campus which can now be found in Wickliffe.\n\nAdding to the reminiscent mood of the evening was the fact that the guest speaker, Rabbi Simon Schwab of K'hal Adath Jeshurun Congregation in New York, is an alumnus of the old Telshe Yeshiva in Lithuania. He commented that he, like such biblical figures as Noah, Daniel and Job, had seen a world in its prime, had lived to see that world destroyed, and at least saw it rebuilt.\n\n\"If the old gedolim (great Torah figures) would be able to come here to this beautiful campus and see the young men bred in America with the old Torah of Telshe, they would be proud,\" said Rabbi Schwab.\n\nAmong the hundreds of memories he has of the old yeshiva in Lithuania, Rabbi Schwab recalled three qualities which permeated the atmosphere there. These were chochma (wisdom), tiferes (dignity), and emes (truth). Though there was poverty in the old town of Telshe, the yeshiva fostered in its students a sense of dignity, a \"princely\" bearing which today is lost to us, he said. There was also a strict regard for \"emes\" - the love of truth, even if truth hurt.\n\nRabbi Louis Engelberg was toastmaster of the dinner. Henry Lowenthal, outgoing chairman of the Board of Sponsors, welcomed the guests. Nominating committee chairman Dr. Henry Romberg placed in nomination the name of Gerson Adler as chairman of the board for the coming year. Adler was duly elected.\n\nRabbi Mordechai Gifter, rosh hayeshiva, presented welcoming remarks."
