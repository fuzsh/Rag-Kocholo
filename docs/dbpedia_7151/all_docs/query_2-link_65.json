According to longtime MUACC attendee Carl Moore from Loyola University, the organization \"started out with Hobart Willard, an analytical chemistry professor from the University of Michigan and two of his very precocious students, G. Frederick Smith and Harvey Diehl. After Smith and Diehl earned their doctorates, the three kept a close, almost family relationship. Somehow, they got the idea to get together about once a year, visit, talk chemistry, talk about ongoing work, talk `blue sky' work, \"\" [This indicates Smith's preceptor as Willard, and gives an alternate spelling: Willard vs. Willared.] - Mainz does not include Smith, George - DisAbs shows: Smith, George Frederick|PhD|1922|U Michigan| Chemistry, Analytical|(title)| - Mathematics does not include: Smith, George - NDSU shows: George Frederick Smith|PhD|Michigan|1922|Hobart Hurd Willared - Obituary, by R.
