        "text": "The success of Family Feud has provided plenty of opportunities for various shows and movies to make parodies or have their characters make appearances on The Feud as a (sub)plot.\n\nParodies[]\n\nAmerican Dad[]\n\nIn the episode \"Old Stan in the Mountain\" Steve Smith finds his father with a knife that Stan intended to stab his son with after he believes that both he and Hailey are out to kill him at Mount Kilimanjaro. Steve misinterprets Stan's intentions and thinks he was out whittle some wood as he carves himself a totem pole of the faces of five Feud hosts who are: Richard Dawson, Ray Combs, Louie Anderson, Richard Karn and Steve Harvey but omitting John O'Hurley in the process of doing so.\n\nThe Annoying Orange[]\n\nA 2020 episode of the internet series also called Family Food (not to be confused with the Sesame Street parody from 1981 or the Burger King promotion from 2012 of the same name) hosted by a knife character named Steve Carvey (parody of current host Steve Harvey) featured the Orange, Pear, Midget Apple, Grandpa Lemon and Grapefruit as \"The Fruit\" playing against a Broccoli, a Squash, a Carrot, a Cucumber and a Red Pepper as \"The Vegetables\". The prize for this parody was a motorboat (as of which the Orange does a lot with his mouth anyway) instead of $20,000 in cash. The fruits wound up winning the game despite Orange's annoying antics. However, the giant motorboat lands on the vegetables along with Carvey once the game ends. Orange then replies \"HOLY SHIP!\" (parody of the actual curse word \"HOLY SH*T!\") and laughs much to the annoyance of his friends.\n\nArcher[]\n\nIn the episode \"Placebo Effect\" a deadly spoof of the Feud was played with Sterling Archer (voiced by H.
