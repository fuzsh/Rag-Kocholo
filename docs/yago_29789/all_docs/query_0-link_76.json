        "text": "A correction was made to this article on March 23, 2004.\n\nNEW YORK — Comedy Central has plunked down $4.5 million to buy dark comedy “Bad Santa.”\n\nDimension Pictures, the distributor, and Comedy Central declined to discuss deal points, but Comedy Central has bought an exclusive three-year license term in the network window to the title, which kicks off in April 2006. Starz owns the Starz owns the pay TV rights to “Bad Santa.”\n\nComedy Central regards “Bad Santa” as dark and offbeat, a good fit for the young male audience the network attracts.\n\nDimension has sold some previous titles to Comedy Central, including “Scary Movie 3,” “My Boss’s Daughter” and Eddie Griffin’s “DysFunctional Family.” Dimension sister company Miramax recently sold “Duplex,” with Ben Stiller and Drew Barrymore, to the cabler.\n\nRick Sands, chief operating officer of Miramax, said there’s a broadcast-cable version of “Bad Santa,” which mainly involves the deletion of four-letter words.\n\nSands negotiated the deal with Gary Perchick, VP of TV sales for Dimension. For Comedy Central, Kathryn Mitchell, senior VP of programming, and Susie Kricena, VP of acquisitions, did the honors."
