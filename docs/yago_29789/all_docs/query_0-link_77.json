        "text": "1. “Top Five” (2014)\n\nChris Rock plays Andre Allen, a comic actor experiencing an existential crisis of sorts. In search of meaning vis-à-vis his life and career, he hopes to change perceptions of who he is as a performer by delving into more “serious” fare with a film about a bloody slave rebellion in Haiti (although not the most obvious one). But fans prefer to see him as the crime-fighter dressed in a bear suit in a franchise that has made him rich and famouse. Enter Rosario Dawson as a reporter for the New York Times on a mission to uncover who the “real” Andre Allen is, as the pair spend a day together, sparring over celebrity, race, hip-hop music, and more, reliving past scandals, and suffering a very public meltdown. Throughout, he’s interrupted by a film crew as he prepares to marry reality-television star Erica Long, played by Gabrielle Union. It’s Rock’s stand-up comedy routine as cinema.\n\n2. “Blacula” (1972)\n\nLong before Eddie Murphy was a “Vampire in Brooklyn,” there was “Blacula.” A commercial hit despite mixed reviews (it even spawned “Blacula” action figures and other merchandising), it doesn’t quite hold up four decades later. But its campiness was intentional, and it does deliver some genuine scares. More notably, it was representative of the wide diversity of genres that blaxploitation offered during the period; as an early horror entry, it would inspire a wave of blaxploitation horror films. It was the first lead role for William Marshall, who’d found success mostly on stage. The 6-foot-5 thespian sinks his teeth into the role (sorry), giving his character a nobility that wasn’t in the original script. And then of course, there’s the voice. Few black actors (other than Paul Robeson) were more commanding. “Blacula” spawned the sequel “Scream Blacula Scream” in 1973.\n\n3. “Virtuosity” (1995)\n\nIt’s not Denzel Washington’s best showcase, but it’s fun. Plus, he goes up against a demented, pre-Hollywood-fame Russell Crowe. The two Oscar-winning actors would meet again 12 years later in Ridley Scott’s “American Gangster.” Directed by Brett Leonard (“The Lawnmower Man”), the futuristic “Virtuosity” stars Washington as a police lieutenant on the trail of a Crowe’s SID 6.7, a computer composite of 183 serial killers — a virtual reality reation designed to put L.A. police officers to the test. Stakes are amplified when SID 6.7 escapes the bounds of cyberspace, becoming almost unconquerable in the real world of flesh and blood. Set in 1999, it looked somewhat dated even at release, but the film’s two prodigiously talented stars provide enough gravitas to overcome its technical deficiencies. Plus there’s plenty of bass-heavy action, thanks partly to its pounding techno score.\n\n4. “Jean of the Joneses” (2016)\n\nInspired by her own family — though not explicitly biographical —writer-director Stella Meghie’s featutre debut is a fresh, endearing take on the messy lives of young aspiring writers and their dysfunctional families. It’s a work of modest ambition with some commercial appeal, starring Taylour Paige of “Zola” fame in a multigenerational ensemble cast that surrounds the chaos that ensues after the estranged patriarch of the Jones family dies on their doorstep. When the paramedic who answers their 911 call tries to win over acerbic Jean Jones, his attempts are disrupted by old conflicts that come to a boil at the funeral. The film made its world premiere at the SXSW Film Festival where it received mostly favorable reviews from critics and audiences alike, and was good enough for CAA to sign Meghie for representation in all areas. She’s still one of a tiny handfull of Black women filmmakers working at the studio level. This is the film that launched a career.\n\n5. “A Good Day to Be Black and Sexy” (2008)\n\nThis bold between-the-sheets peak at modern-day Black sexuality premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2008, where it wooed audiences via a series of ribald vignettes typically involving couples. Capturing relationship dynamics and relationship dysfunctions, in filmmaker Dennis Dortch’s insigntful comedy, what we have here is (often) a failure to communicate, to borrow from the Captain in “Cool Hand Luke.” Blending movie and musical styles to enhance the individual segments, Dortch created an entertaining glimpse into sexuality and romance from a Black POV, with realistic and identifiable characters, in large part thanks to the talented and exuberant cast of new faces.\n\n6. “Undercover Brother” (2002)\n\nIn this funny and fun Blaxloitation parody directed by Spike Lee’s cousin, Malcolm D. Lee, from a script by future Oscar winner John Ridley, Eddie Griffin stars as the title character who is an amagamation of every tough-guy ’70s blaxploitation hero rolled into one, as he takes on “The Man,” a white corporate criminal out to destroy the Black community. A blast from the past and ready to take care of business, Undercover Brother is recruited to infiltrate The Man’s sinister underground organization, with the help of the sassy, stunning Sistah Girl (Aunjanue Ellis). Our hero must first undergo the ultimate attitude adjustment and trade in his afro and bellbottoms for sweaters and loafers. Once the transformation is complete, he’s ready to take on the evil perpetrators of Operation Whitewash. But he can only stay “undercover” for so long. A pre-“Chappelle Show” Dave Chappelle co-stars in a hilarious bit as Conspiracy Brother Jones.\n\n7. “Nat Turner: A Troublesome Property” (2003)\n\nA “troublesome property” for his master, as the title indicates, Nat Turner — an enslaved man who led a rebellion of enslaved people in August 1831 — has remained the same for historians, storytellers, and others who have struggled to understand the leader of the famous bloody slave rebellion. Most recently, Nate Parker attempted to contextualize Turner’s plight with “The Birth of a Nation” (2016) — a film that didn’t quite measure up. A decade earlier, director Charles Burnett’s film “Troublesome Property” used an innovative approach that combined documentary filmmaking techniques, dramatic recreations, and historical methodology to explore the country’s reckoning with Nat Turner and the revolt, which remains critical in coming to terms with the racial history of the United States.\n\n8. “Quilombo” (1984)\n\nThis historical saga of runaway slave communities (or “quilombos”) in northern Brazil is a rousing union of mythology, politics, and bold storytelling. It chronicles the most famous of these self-governing communities, which flourished after the slave revolt of 1641, under the reign of the legendary Ganga Zumba, who escaped bondage on a sugar plantation and eventually rose to the position of highest authority within the kingdom of Palmares. It’s a captivating historical account spanning several decades, memorable for its striking use of color, and set to the infectious musical arrangements of leading Brazilian musician and activist Gilberto Gil’s score. The production values aren’t top-shelf, but the message is clear: It might be commonly believed that throughout the African Diaspora, Africans (except for a few revolts) simply accepted their lot as slaves. This is entirely untrue."
