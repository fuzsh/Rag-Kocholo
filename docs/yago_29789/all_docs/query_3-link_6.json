        "text": "#10: The Barrymores\n\nDrugs really can destroy families, can’t they? This famous Hollywood family was plagued with drug and alcohol problems, beginning with John Barrymore’s lifelong addictions. His mental health eventually deteriorated, and he passed his troubles down to his son, John Drew, who also suffered from drug and alcohol addiction, eventually became a recluse, and lived out his final days in isolation. Perhaps more famous is his daughter Drew Barrymore’s addictions, as she was smoking pot and snorting cocaine before she even became a teenager. Luckily, Drew’s story is a happier one, as she is now drug free and is a Hollywood A-lister.\n\n#9: The Hogans\n\nThe Hogans, perhaps most famous for patriarch Hulk Hogan and his successful wrestling career, have seen their fair share of catastrophes over the years. After Linda Hogan filed for divorce from the Hulkster, she dated a 19-year-old. But perhaps even more gross was when the Hulk himself came under scrutiny for dating someone who looked eerily like his daughter Brooke, drawing incestuous comments. His ex-wife was arrested for driving under the influence in 2012, and his son was even imprisoned for reckless driving when he almost killed himself and his passenger in a collision. Here’s a tip: stay off the roads when the Hogans are driving.\n\n#8: The O’Neals\n\nThe O’Neals are quite the dysfunctional bunch, as everyone seems to have had run-ins with somebody or something. Actress Tatum O’Neal was arrested for drug possession, and also claims that she was abused by her father Ryan O’Neal growing up, which stemmed from his own addictions. Not only that, she claims that her heroin use negatively impacted her relationship with her children. Ryan’s son, Tatum’s brother Redmond was arrested on suspicion of possessing meth, while another O’Neal – Griffin – was arrested for driving under the influence, proving once again that drug use is never a good thing.\n\n#7: The Phillips\n\nMackenzie Phillips, perhaps best known for her role as rebellious teenager Julie on “One Day at a Time,” alleges that she had a rough childhood. Before becoming addicted to cocaine and being fired from her show, she claims that her father injected her with drugs at a very young age and began an incestuous relationship with her that lasted over ten years – and if that’s not the definition of dysfunction, we don’t know what is. However, as John Phillips had passed away years before Mackenzie came forward with her story, the accusation’s reliability has been called into question.\n\n#6: The Gosselins\n\nThe Gosselins are known for their hit reality show “Jon & Kate Plus 8,” which chronicles the lives of the pair as they try to raise their twins and sextuplets. A difficult task in and of itself, it would soon prove to be much harder, as the Gosselins went through a difficult public divorce, severe money issues and Jon’s eventual departure. If taking care of eight children wasn’t hard enough, doing it as a single mother made it all the more strenuous. However, that didn’t stop Kate from starring in many different reality shows, including the revised “Kate Plus 8.”\n\n#5: The Thompsons\n\nYou know the Thompsons as the Honey Boo Boo family; stars of the controversial reality show “Here Comes Honey Boo Boo.” The family is infamous for their behavior both on and off-camera, with many of their hijinks making it into the show, including Mama June’s controversial Go Go Juice that she feeds Alana. However, possibly the worst of it occurs off-camera: in 2014, it came to light that June was in a relationship with Mark Anthony McDaniel, a registered sex offender who molested June’s own daughter when she was younger. Frankly, it’s no wonder TLC canceled the show.\n\n#4: The Lohans\n\nIt really is a shame what happened to Lindsay Lohan. The cute actress was once an up and coming star, starring in “Mean Girls” and other box office successes, before succumbing to the lavish lifestyle and becoming addicted to drugs and alcohol. She has since been in and out of rehab countless times, and has been served numerous hours of community service. Her father Michael is no winner either, serving jail time for suspected domestic violence when he allegedly beat his girlfriend and numerous drug arrests, including a DUI. Like father like daughter.\n\n#3: The Kardashians\n\nWith successful fathers like Olympic gold medalist Bruce Jenner and O.J. Simpson’s defense attorney Robert Kardashian, it’s a shame what these socialites have done to the family name. Kim’s sex tape and infamously quick marriage to Kris Humphries tarnished her name, and her relationship with Kanye West has only added ridicule to her reputation. “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” is a prime example of just how shallow and insincere this family really is. Either way, many critics have since called the family famous for being famous and have found humor in their attempts at relevance. We’ll let you be the judge.\n\n#2: The Duggars\n\n(Almost) nothing beats the dysfunction of a reality TV family – even if that family is comprised of devout Independent Baptists. With the kids all sporting matching “J” names, the family from “17,” “18” and “19 Kids and Counting” is all about wholesomeness, humility and the man upstairs. They don’t use birth control – hence the 19 kids and counting – homeschool their little ones and are basically all about “values.” However, the Duggars have not avoided controversy: in 2015, it came to light that eldest son Josh Duggar had allegedly molested five girls when he was a teen – four of whom were his own sisters. If that’s not dysfunction, we don’t know what is.\n\nBefore we look at our most dysfunctional family, here are a few honorable mentions:\n\n- Courtney Love & Frances Bean Cobain\n\n- The Douglases\n\n- The Smiths\n\n- The Carters\n\n- The Spears\n\n- The Osbournes\n\n#1: The Jacksons\n\nThe most famous of all dysfunctional celebrity families, the Jacksons prove to be the worst as well. Patriarch Joe Jackson is well known for his abuse towards his children, with Michael testifying that he would often whip them with a belt. He physically and emotionally traumatized Michael, leading to various problems as an adult. Michael’s infamous trial regarding child molestation didn’t help, and only sullied the Jackson name further in the media. For a family that sang such catchy songs, there was a darkness behind the stage the cameras could rarely catch.\n\nDo you agree with our list?
