I also have just about every Bill Cosby standup album ever. On vinyl\n\n-sj loves kevin spacey\n\nAnything by Billy Connelly.\n\nHe isnt as well known in the US, but damn, you'll be hard pressed to find someone funnier.\n\nBilly Connelly - He isnt as well known in the US\n\nWe just know him as the teacher on Head of the Class that replaced the guy from WKRP/Police Academy II when he left.\n\nDane Cook, Lewis Black, Denis Leary, Elvira Kurt, and some others who's names I can't remember, anything with them is good\n\nBill Hicks - Sane Man\n\nBill Hicks - Rant in E-Minor\n\nBill Hicks - HBO Special, live in London\n\nBill Hicks is by far one of the best comedians, and if you dont know about him you are missing out on something great.\n\nHe died on april 27, 1994.\n\n\"It's Only A Ride\"\n\nBrian Regan\n\nI wouldn't put this guy on top of the list but he deserves a mention. Everytime I see his material I die lauging. The guy is right on with observational comedy like Seinfeld except he is way more animated on stage.\n\n[image=http://www.brianregan.com/images/cdsalesimage_goods_animatio.gif]\n\nZak Galifinakis...I saw him on his comedy central special and he totally killed.\n\n\"My sister has multiple personalities, and that's not funny at all. But the other day, she called me and my caller ID exploded\"\n\nhysterical!!!\n\ni just wanna say first of all that i hate wanda sykes.\n\nand then i'd have to say my favorite is Jerry Seinfeld \"i'm telling you for the last time\" but that was mentioned already."
