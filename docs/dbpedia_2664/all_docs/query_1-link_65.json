Such issues may include a variety of topics such as gender equality, community building, diversity, literacy, mental health, innovation, the environment, science and our unique place in Canada and the world.\n\nTerm of Office\n\nThe Lieutenant-Governor is appointed by the Governor General, on the advice of the Prime Minister of Canada, for a period of not less than five years.
