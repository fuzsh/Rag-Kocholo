        "text": "My name is James Dinn, my friends call me Jim and I am asking for your support as the next leader of the Newfoundland & Labrador New Democratic Party.\n\nI never had political ambitions. Certainly, I never set out to be leader of a political party. I thank the many people within the party and outside, constituents, family and friends who encouraged me to drop the interim title. It’s been a long decision making process, but here I am.\n\nIf there is one reason to offer myself for the position it lies in the ability to make a difference in the lives of people. In a previous interview I stated that Jim Dinn MHA has more ability to influence decisions than Jim Dinn private citizen, and Jim Dinn as leader has more ability to influence than Jim Dinn MHA. But the ability to make change does not lie with me alone. I am only one person. I prefer to think of myself as first among equals.\n\nFolks, we have our work cut out for us if we are to make the changes needed to benefit the people of our province – if we are to implement plans that put people first.\n\nI ran for office four years ago because as a former educator, I’ve seen firsthand what it looks like when our important systems are failing. Since I was elected, I’ve heard from people every day – those who are struggling to access the healthcare they need, those who have given up on their dreams of owning a home, and find it harder and harder to put groceries on the table.\n\nIf we have seen anything from the current government is the lack of meaningful plans, whether it’s relating to climate change, just transition, affordable housing, homelessness, or healthcare.\n\nWe are cleaning up from a major winter storm. The number of people using emergency shelters has grown from 71 in 2020 to 280 as of February 2023 according to a CBC report – almost a 300% increase. The Minister of Children, Seniors, and Social Development admitted that in retrospect, the provincial government could have been more prepared. That’s not good enough.\n\nYes folks, we have much to do. We need a party committed to planning for the future of all Newfoundland & Labradorians. I believe that party is the NDP.\n\nSo, I have an ask. Get involved. Consider volunteering. Consider donating. Consider running in the next election so that we can elect more New Democrats in the legislature and increase your voice in the House of Assembly.\n\nI am working to build that team of New Democrats that will be focussed on you and fight for you.\n\nWe need strong voices in government to fight for policies, programs and laws that will make our communities safer, sustainable and prosperous.\n\nI have learned much and have been inspired by others who have mentored me, pushed me, and challenged me, to speak out and use my voice to influence change.\n\nBut change is never quiet – it’s also important to listen, to learn, and to prepare.\n\nAnd then to stand up and speak out.\n\nIt works, and especially when you are speaking out from your heart about issues that you care about.\n\nMy promise to you is I am prepared to stand up and put the same hard work, passion, energy, and commitment into being your leader.\n\nJim is a dedicated champion for workers and families in this province. Born and raised in St. John’s, father of 3, and grandfather to 2, Jim understands the challenges faced by everyday people in our province. After teaching in rural and urban classrooms for 32 years, Jim was the President of the NLTA from 2013 to 2017 when he retired that year and assumed the role of national vice president for the National Teachers Association until the following year.\n\nSince being elected as the NDP member for St. John’s Centre in 2018, Jim has been a dedicated voice for labour in this province. He has held government to account for their cuts to the public service, their use of attrition to cut jobs. He’s also been known to race to a picket line in the middle of the night when an employer leverages local enforcement to try and break up a picket line at a distribution facility in St. John’s.\n\nWithin the NL NDP Caucus Jim serves as interim leader and critic on a number of areas across government including Immigration, Skills, & Labour, Education, and the NL Housing Corporation. He is the NL NDP representative on the Basic Income Committee and other legislative committees. He is focused on giving a voice to those who go unheard. For 40 years he has been an active member of St. Vincent de Paul serving on their executive, and establishing an affordable housing program in St. John’s.\n\nJohn C. Maxwell said, “Every person has a longing to be significant; to make a contribution; to be part of something noble and purposeful.” Jim believes it is that longing which underpins the New Democratic Party."
