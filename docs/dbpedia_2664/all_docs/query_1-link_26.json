        "text": "The paper addresses more specific and concrete issues which are of common concern from a comparative perspective. After analysing the Canadian constitutional model, some more concrete issues directly linked with the form of government will be approached, such as the centrality of the Prime Minister; the supremacy of the Government over the legislature; the role of the judiciary in the light of its relation with other constitutional branches; the nature and function of parliamentary bodies, from the perspective of the due balance between accountability and representativeness; finally, the role of \"guarantee\" bodies (the Crown, Governor General and the Supreme Court) within a constitutional distribution of powers which is increasingly subject to the influence of the political will of the majority.\n\nWhen the minority government of Stephen Harper faced a non-confidence motion and likely defeat by an opposition coalition shortly after the 2008 election the Prime Minister argued that a coalition could not legitimately take power without an election. The impending defeat was staved off by prorogation and subsequent events but the so called �New Rules� of the Prime Minister were criticized by constitutional experts who saw them as infringing the established principles of responsible government which allow the Governor General to appoint a new government following an early vote of non-confidence. The Prime Minister�s later claim that the 2011 election was a choice between a Conservative majority or coalition � seemed to reject his own �New Rules� and was seen as evidence of his political expediency. This paper considers the constitutional politics concerning coalition governments that arose, first in 2008 and then again in 2011. It focuses on the question whether, and if so under wha...\n\nOn the surface, there was nothing special about the 2007 Newfoundland and Labrador general election, which saw Danny Williams re-elected for a second term as Premier. That his Progressive Conservatives would win a solid majority was never in doubt. There were no emerging issues, major gaffes or innovative campaign tactics, and few tight races. The de facto referendum on Williams’ leadership became a coronation. The only intrigue was how many Liberal or New Democratic Party candidates would form the opposition. The results illustrate that a relatively homogenous electorate can rally around a leader who decries the province’s status in the Canadian federation. Furthermore, when elected officials from all major parties have been implicated in a scandal, many electors respond by not participating in politics. Political scientists can therefore draw comparative insights, such as asymmetrical federalism reminiscent of Quebec Premier Jean Lesage in the early 1960s, political scandal similar to the Grant Devine administration of Saskatchewan in the early 1990s, or about civic engagement generally.\n\nThesis: Bowden, James W.J. “Reining in the Crown’s Authority Over Dissolution: Canada’s Fixed-Date Election Laws versus the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act of the United Kingdom.” M.A. Thesis, Carleton University, September 2018. This paper analyzes the key differences between the sources of authority of the Crown of the United Kingdom versus those of the Crown of Canada in order to compare and contrast the fixed-date election laws in Canada (at the federal and provincial levels) with the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, 2011 of the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom operates on parliamentary supremacy and an uncodified constitution; the British Parliament can therefore invoke its sovereign right to limit or put into abeyance any prerogative authority of the British Crown at will. The authority of the British Crown derives from three sources: statute, prerogative, and the Crown’s capacity as a legal person. In contrast, Canada has always operated on a system of constitutional supremacy. Currently, the authority of the Crown of Canada derives from four sources: the constitutionally entrenched executive authority, the provisions of the Constitution Act, 1867, statute, and its status as a legal person. The first two sources of authority enjoy protection from statutory encroachment under section 41(a) of the Constitution Act, 1982. This is precisely why the Canadian fixed-date elections laws have deliberately preserved the Crown’s authority over dissolution and the Prime Minister’s or Premier’s capacity to advise and take responsibility for early dissolution. In contrast, the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, 2011 puts the prerogative of dissolution of the British Crown into abeyance by removing the Queen and Prime Minister from dissolution altogether, and thus truly eliminates the possibility of so-called “snap elections” that First Ministers have called for their own perceived political gains. Finally, Canadian jurists and scholars have long misapplied the British concept of “prerogative” to the Crown of Canada. A.V. Dicey defined a prerogative as “the residue of discretionary or arbitrary authority, which at any given time is legally left in the hands of the Crown.” Dissolution therefore cannot properly be called a “prerogative” in the Dicean sense in Canada because only a formal constitutional amendment under section 41(a) of the Constitution Act, 1982, and not a statute, could eliminate the Crown’s authority over dissolution (at either the federal level or in a province) in the same manner that the Fixed-Term Parliaments Act, 2011 has put the prerogative of dissolution into abeyance in the United Kingdom. The Parliament of Canada does not enjoy the unfettered sovereignty of the Parliament of the United Kingdom."
