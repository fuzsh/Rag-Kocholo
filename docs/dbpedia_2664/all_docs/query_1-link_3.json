        "text": "A general assembly in Newfoundland\n\nThe members of the 1st General Assembly of Newfoundland were elected in the Newfoundland general election held in November 1832, the first general election for the colony.[1] The general assembly sat from January 1, 1833[2] until 1836.\n\nJohn Bingley Garland was chosen as speaker. Thomas Bennett replaced Garland as speaker in 1834.[3]\n\nThe first session of the general assembly met in a tavern and lodging house in St. John's operated by a Mary Travers; the elected assembly met on the ground floor and the appointed Board of Council met on the upper floor. A different location, the Old Court House, was used for the second and subsequent sessions.[4]\n\nIn 1833, the assembly passed a Revenue Bill which would provide much-needed funds to support the operation of the colony. The bill was subsequently rejected by the Legislative Council. The governor and British Government intervened in support of the legislation, which was submitted again and this time approved by the council.[5]\n\nSir Thomas John Cochrane, although he had been opposed to the concept of representative government in the colony, became its first civil governor and was responsible for the implementation of the new system of government. The governor's support was required on any new legislation and he had the power to prorogue the assembly. Cochrane was removed from office in 1834[6] and replaced by Sir Henry Prescott.[7]\n\nA Newfoundland general election was held in 1836 but the results were set aside by Chief Justice Henry John Boulton because the writs for the election did not bear the required Great Seal. A new election was called for the following year.[5]\n\nMembers of the Assembly\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following members were elected to the assembly in 1832:[2]\n\nMember Electoral district Affiliation[nb 1][8] First elected William Brown Bonavista Bay Conservative 1832 William Hooper Burin Conservative 1832 Robert Pack Conception Bay Liberal 1832 Peter Brown Liberal 1832 Charles Cozens Conservative 1832 James Power Liberal 1832 Robert Carter Ferryland Conservative 1832 Thomas Bennett Fogo Conservative 1832 Newman Wright Hoyles Fortune Bay Conservative 1832 Roger Forstall Sweetman Placentia and St. Mary's Liberal 1832 John Wills Martin Conservative 1832 John Kent St. John's Liberal 1832 William Thomas Conservative 1832 Patrick Kough Conservative 1832 William Carson Liberal 1833 John Bingley Garland Trinity Bay Conservative 1832 William Bickford Row 1833\n\nNotes:\n\nBy-elections\n\n[edit]\n\nBy-elections were held to replace members for various reasons:\n\nElectoral district Member elected Affiliation Election date Reason St. John's William Carson[nb 1] liberal 1833 W Thomas named to Executive Council[8] Trinity Bay William Bickford Row[nb 1] conservative 1833 JB Garland named to Executive Council[8]\n\nNotes:"
