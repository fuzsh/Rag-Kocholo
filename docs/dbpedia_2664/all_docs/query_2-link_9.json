        "text": "Of the 40 men and women elected to the House of Assembly Monday night, more than a dozen of them now face a steep learning curve, despite some being elected at municipal and federal levels before.\n\n\"It's a challenge,\" admitted John Haggie, a surgeon and past-president of the Canadian Medical Association and the Newfoundland and Labrador Medical Association, who handily won in his district of Gander.\n\n\"I have some skills, and some experience, but obviously mostly health care-related. I rely on my constituents to advise me and educate me about things not related to health care.\"\n\nHaggie was a star candidate for the Liberals, with little opposition in his district, giving him time on the campaign trail to prepare for his political future.\n\nHe is also one of the political rookies. Some other new MHAs have experience at the municipal level, and two — Liberals Gerry Byrne and Siobhan Coady — sat in Parliament.\n\nSurprise! You're an MHA\n\nFor some, Monday night's win came as a surprise victory.\n\n\"I think it'll start sinking in in the days to come,\" said Liberal Perry Trimper, who won over Tory incumbent and cabinet minister Keith Russell in Lake Melville.\n\nTrimper, an environmental scientist who left his job a year ago and dove into politics, said his constituents can expect a moral MHA that's there to serve.\n\n\"One with very high principles,\" he said. \"It's really about representing them [his constituents].\"\n\nLikewise, Neil King, the first Liberal MHA elected in Bonavista in more than 20 years, said much of being a politician is being a people person — and he has that part nailed down.\n\n\"The big thing with me is helping people. I know it's maybe cliché or whatever, but it is,\" he said.\n\n\"I genuinely enjoy meeting people, talking issues with people, helping people out. That in itself is rewarding to me,\" said King.\n\nBehind-the-scenes experience\n\nWhile some of these MHA-elects may have just won their first election, they're not all political strangers.\n\nTwo of them — Liberals Mark Browne (Placentia West-Bellevue) and Carol Anne Haley (Burin-Grand Bank) — have both worked for long-time Liberal MP Judy Foote.\n\nBrowne, at just 22 years old, has also worked as a political staffer for the Liberals in the Office of the Official Opposition in St. John's.\n\nAnd the lone brand-new PC, Barry Petten (Conception Bay South), has extensive behind-the-scenes experience with the party, spending four years on its provincial executive.\n\nPetten was also an executive assistant to the province's minister of transportation and works from 2009 and to 2014.\n\nOthers have held seats at the federal and municipal levels, in some cases, for years.\n\nHow will all their political experience, and inexperience, serve these newcomers in their elected forays?\n\nOnly time, and Question Period, will tell.\n\nThe full list of MHA newcomers, in alphabetical order by district:\n\n- Brian Warr, Liberal, Baie Verte-Green bay\n\n- Neil King, Liberal, Bonavista\n\n- Carol Anne Haley, Liberal, Burin-Grand Bank\n\n- Barry Petten, PC, Conception Bay South\n\n- Gerry Byrne, Liberal, Corner Brook\n\n- Jerry Dean, Liberal, Exploits\n\n- Derrick Bragg, Liberal, Fogo Island-Cape Freels\n\n- John Haggie, Liberal, Gander\n\n- Al Hawkins, Liberal, Grand Falls-Windsor-Buchans\n\n- Pam Parsons, Liberal, Harbour Grace-Port de Grave\n\n- Betty Parsley, Liberal, Harbour Main\n\n- Graham Letto, Liberal, Labrador West\n\n- Perry Trimper, Liberal, Lake Melville\n\n- Derek Bennett, Liberal, Lewisporte-Twillingate\n\n- Sherry Gambin-Walsh, Liberal, Placentia-St. Mary's\n\n- Mark Browne, Liberal, Placentia West-Bellevue\n\n- Siobhan Coady, Liberal, St. John's West\n\n- John Finn, Liberal, Stephenville-Port au Port\n\n- Colin Holloway, Liberal, Terra Nova\n\n- Bernard Davis, Liberal, Virginia Waters-Pleasantville"
