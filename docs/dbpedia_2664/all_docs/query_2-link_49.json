        "text": "From the Memorial Record of Alabama, Vol. II, 1893.\n\nAlthough a native of New England, Prelate Demick Barker found his political and business fortunes in Alabama, where he first settled in 1857. Barker's long residency in the \"Heart of Dixie\" saw him become one of Mobile's most honored sons, being appointed as Collector of Internal Revenue for his state and in 1890 entered into a two-decade-long tenure as U.S. Postmaster at Mobile. On the national political scene, Barker served eight years as a member of the Republican National Committee from Alabama and was an eight-time delegate from Alabama to the Republican National Convention.\n\nBorn on September 29, 1835, Prelate Demick Barker's birth occurred (depending on the source) in either North Branford, Connecticut, or New York City. The son of John Brooks Barker (a ship captain) and the former Frances J. Appell, Barker's first name is a misnomer, as \"prelate\" is actually a title given to a high ranking clergyman, such as a bishop or cardinal. While this name is certainly unusual, research has shown Barker received his name in honor of Prelate Demick (1801-1885), a resident of New Haven, Connecticut. A beloved schoolmaster in his region, Demick was also the first U.S. Postmaster at North Branford and for a time served as Grand Master for the state Odd Fellows Lodge of Connecticut.\n\nBarker's formative years were spent in New Haven, Connecticut, where he attended the common schools and later was a student at the Stratford Academy. At age seventeen Barker left his native state for New York City, where he pursued a career in law. Studying in the office of Harris Wilson, Barker left that city after two years and briefly resided in Illinois and Wisconsin.\n\nIn 1857 Barker resettled in Alabama, and after establishing roots in Claiborne County took employment with the mercantile firm of McClure and Thames. At the dawn of the Civil War Barker (despite being from the North) cast his lot with the Confederacy, being named an assistant to post quartermaster C.E. Thomas at the latter's headquarter's in Selma. Barker remained in Selma for the duration of the war, and in August 1865 married Joan Elizabeth Ferguson (1842-1910). The couple was wed for over forty years and their union produced four children, Ellis Carson (1866-1898), Florence Jane, Joan Elizabeth (died 1910), and Olive Louise (1873-1960).\n\nFollowing his war service Prelate D. Barker began plotting his business fortune, and in the same year as his marriage entered into the cottonseed oil, lumber, and petroleum business in his region, work that would extend into the 1880s. This was followed by his being tapped to serve as the secretary and treasurer of the Selma and Meridian Railroad in 1869. His time in that post extended two years, and midway during his service was elected to his first political office, that of Dallas County Superintendent of Education.\n\nFrom the Notable Men of Alabama, Volume I, 1904.\n\nBarker left the office of county superintendent in 1871 and in November 1873 entered into his first high profile political appointment, that of Collector of Internal Revenue for Alabama's 2nd district.** Appointed by President Grant, Barker succeeded Francis Widner, who had been suspended from office and died shortly thereafter. Barker's first stint in that post extended several years, and during his term saw Alabama's revenue districts consolidated into one district, thereby making him collector for the entire state. Following his resignation in the late 1870s, Barker joined with the Empire Refining Co. of New York as its secretary, serving from 1879-83.\n\nIn 1883 Prelate Barker was reappointed as Alabama's Collector of Internal Revenue by President Chester Arthur. He would relocate to Montgomery to take office and served until the inauguration of President Cleveland in March 1885. This period also saw Barker enter into the cotton compress and storage business in Montgomery, and in 1890 received the appointment of U.S. Postmaster at Mobile by President Benjamin Harrison. Barker served until 1894 when his commission expired, and in 1897 was reappointed postmaster by President McKinley. His second stint in office extended until 1914, serving through the administrations of McKinley, Roosevelt, Taft, and the first year of the Wilson presidency.\n\nBeginning in 1888 the name of Prelate D. Barker became a familiar one at the Republican National Convention. All told, Barker was elected as a delegate to every Republican National Convention held between 1888 and 1920, excepting the 1904 convention held in Chicago. The 1900 RNC Convention in Philadelphia saw Barker chair the Alabama delegation and also served on the committee to notify President McKinley of his renomination, visiting the president at his home in Canton, Ohio. In addition to his being an eight-time RNC delegate, Barker represented Alabama on the Republican National Committee for eight years, 1908-16.\n\nIn 1910 tragedy struck Barker with the death of his wife of forty-five years, Joan. He would remarry in 1914 to a woman nearly forty years his junior, Grace Salome Pettit (1873-1942). A longstanding Mason and member of the Knights Templar, Barker continued residence in Mobile until his death at home on March 29, 1928, at age 92. He was survived by his wife Grace, with both being interred at the Magnolia Cemetery in Mobile.\n\nFrom the History of Alabama and Dictionary of Alabama Biography, Vol. III, 1921.\n\n** While nearly all sources record Prelate Barker's appointment as Collector of Internal Revenue as occurring in 1871, this is incorrect. Francis Widner was revenue collector in that year and served until his suspension (and later death) in 1873. Barker was appointed by President Grant to succeed him in November 1873, as per the record of the U.S. Court of Claims case log.\n\nPortrait from the Representative Men and Old Families of Southeastern Massachusetts, 1912.\n\nAround the same time Prelate D. Barker was establishing a name for himself in Alabama, a man with a similar first name was doing the same in Massachusetts. That man was Prelet Drake Conant, a Fall River businessman who had fleeting political involvement in 1896 when he was a Prohibition Pary nominee for the Massachusetts state senate. Born in Attleboro, Massachusetts on September 22, 1822, Prelet D. Conant was the son of William and Achsah (Perry) Conant.\n\nLess than a year after he was born, Prelet suffered the death of his father and during his youth was employed as a spinner in a local cotton mill. He later learned the trade of carpenter and following his mother's death removed to Fall River, where he continued carpentry work. Conant married in Rehoboth, Massachusetts to Jane Munroe Rounds (1825-1905) in August 1843. The couple's lengthy union saw the births of a least three children, Mary Jane, Thomas Leprelet, and Minnie Ida.\n\nAfter a decade's residence in Fall River Conant removed to Tiverton, Rhode Island, where he engaged in the manufacture of sashes and blinds for several years. He removed back to Fall River sometime later and established himself in business in that town's Bowenville district. After a fire destroyed his business, Conant was forced to rebuild and by the early 1870s is recorded as operating the P.D. Conant and Co., dealing in \"Builder's Supplies, Doors, Sash, Blinds, Hardware and Cutlery.\"\n\nConant retired from business in 1886 and was active in Fall River fraternal groups, being a member of the Masonic and Odd Fellows lodges. A longtime agent for the Society For the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, Conant was also a former director of the Laurel Lake Mill, a vice president of the Citizen's Savings Bank, and a member of the Fall River Board of Trade.\n\nPrelet Conant's first entrance into politics came in 1856 when he began a long tenure as a justice of the peace, serving in both Massachusetts and Rhode Island. A leading temperance advocate in his city, Conant was called to elective office by the Prohibitionists in 1896, becoming their nominee for the Massachusetts state senate. Hoping to represent the state's 2nd senatorial district, Conant was one of four candidates vying for the seat. On election day he polled a distant fourth with 345 votes, losing out to former state representative William Moran, who triumphed with 5,289 votes.\n\nFour years following his senatorial loss, Prelet D. Conant died at his Fall River home on March 23, 1900, aged 77. He was survived by his wife Jane, and a burial location for both remains unknown at this time.\n\nPortrait from the Choctaw Plaindealer, August 5, 1932.\n\nThe son of a leading Mississippi capitalist, Norfleet Ruffin Sledge was a Senatobia County-based attorney who later served twelve years as a chancery court judge in his state. He would later resign from the bench to serve as a campaign manager for U.S. Senator Byron \"Pat\" Harrison in 1936 and died a few months after Harrison won his fourth term in the senate. Born in Como, Mississippi on June 4, 1888, Norfleet Ruffin Sledge was the son of Norfleet Ruffin (1839-1910) and Lucile Johnson (Meriwether) Sledge (1861-1950). A leading businessman in Panola County, Norfleet Sledge Sr. was a Confederate veteran who earned a fortune in the cotton industry, and in addition to owning over 7,000 acres of land also distinguished himself as a banker, railroad director, and lumber company executive.\n\nA student at the University of Mississippi, Norfleet Ruffin Sledge graduated in the class of 1909 with his bachelor of laws degree. He first established himself in practice in Sardis, Mississippi, and by 1913 relocated to Senatobia, where he was a partner in the firm of Holmes and Sledge. Sledge married in Mississippi in 1914 to Clara Wesson (1894-1927), who died in childbirth in July 1927 after delivering a son, Norfleet Ruffin (1927-2008).\n\nSledge practiced law in Senatobia until 1917 when he enlisted in the U.S. Army. After completing training he served in the intelligence department of the Judge Advocate General's office until his honorable discharge in April 1918, due to \"disability incurred in the line of duty.\" Following his return stateside he maintained memberships in several veterans organizations, being a vice commander of the Arthur Armes Post No. 127, Sardis-Como, Mississippi; the Drum Major and Bugle Corps Post. 127; the Rube Baskin Chapter 17 of the D.A.V.; and was chairman of the Legislative Committee of the American Legion, Department of the Mississippi.\n\nSledge's senior portrait from the 1909 Ole Miss yearbook.\n\nThrough the early 1920s, Sledge continued with his law partnership and in 1924 was elected to fill a vacancy on the Third Chancery District Court of Mississippi, this vacancy occurring due to the elevation of Judge M.M. McGowan to another judicial post. Sledge was elected to a full term of his own in 1926, and in the year following his election suffered the death of his wife Clara. Three years after her passing Sledge remarried to her younger sister, Obedience \"Beady\" Wesson (1897-1961), who would survive him. The couple's union was childless.\n\nIn 1930 Sledge won a third term as chancellor and in 1934 entered into his fourth term, which extended until his resignation in 1936. In 1932 he was an unsuccessful aspirant for the state supreme court, and despite \"magnificent support\" outside his district failed of election by only a few hundred votes. His twelve-year tenure as chancellor for the third district was later lauded by the Clarksdale Daily Register as one of credit, noting:\n\n\"It is said that his record showed fewer reversals by the Supreme Court for the same period and volume of business than that of any Chancellor who ever held this position in the history of Mississippi.\"\n\nA Sledge campaign notice from his 1932 Supreme Court candidacy.\n\nFollowing his 1936 resignation, Norfleet Sledge joined the campaign of friend Byron Patterson \"Pat\" Harrison, then running for reelection to the U.S. Senate from Mississippi. As Harrison's campaign manager, Sledge was also brought aboard as a member of the campaign's finance committee, a role that put his name on the federal payroll with a $3,000 salary. This fact subsequently drew the ire (and watchful eye) of fellow senator Theodore Bilbo, with whom Harrison had a checkered history, but despite Bilbo making charges of payroll corruption, Harrison won reelection that November.\n\nIn the weeks following Harrison's win, Sledge journeyed with him to Washington, D.C., where he hoped to be named to the Interstate Commerce Commission. Although he was passed over for that post, Sledge achieved some measure of consolation when he was appointed an assistant to Attorney General Homer S. Cummings for the U.S. Department of Justice's claims division. During his residency in Washington Sledge had a home at the Raleigh Apartments, and died in his room from an unexpected attack of apoplexy on March 11, 1937. Just 48 years old at the time of his death, Sledge's body was escorted back to Mississippi by Senator Patterson and Congressman Wall Doxey, with burial occurring at the Friendship Cemetery in Como.\n\nFrom the Jackson Clarion-Ledger, March 12, 1937.\n\nNorfleet Carney during his mayoralty.\n\nAnother \"Norfleet\" that made his name in the public forum was Norfleet Lynn Carney, a physician who served three terms as mayor of Clarksville, Tennessee. A lifelong Tennessean, Carney was born in Montgomery County on September 21, 1854, the son of Christopher Norfleet and Margaret (Lynn) Carney. Carney's formative years were spent on his father's plantation and in the late 1870s attended the University of Tennessee until departing in his junior year.\n\nDesiring to begin a career in medicine, Carney enrolled at the Vanderbilt University and in 1879 graduated with his medical degree. Following graduation, he had further clinical study at a Nashville hospital and in 1880 removed to Clarksville to begin his practice. Carney married in Clarksville in 1888 to Hattie Grinter (1866-1956), and the couple's forty-three-year marriage produced four sons, Edwin Lee (1889-1971) Norfleet Lynn Jr. (1890-1971), Clarence Grinter (1892-1980), and Richard Rodney (1894-1933.)\n\nIn the early 1890s Carney began to focus attention on Clarksville civic affairs, and in 1892 was elected as mayor of that city. He would be returned to that office on two more occasions, and after the completion of his third term in 1898 was acknowledged as a \"thorough student of municipal government and was one of the best posted men in the city along that line.\" Carney's final term as mayor saw him become affiliated with the Street Railway, Light and Gas Company of Clarksville, and from 1896-1909 served as its president. He retired from the practice of medicine in the early 1900s.\n\nAfter leaving office Carney's name continued to be prominent in Clarksville civic life, with his being a multi-term city alderman, and for a time served as president of the First National Bank of Clarksville. In 1911 he became an early dealer in automobiles in his region, partnering with his son Clarence to establish a Ford distributing agency. Carney's sons Norfleet and Richard would also join this concern, which later distributed Buick models.\n\nNorfleet L. Carney died at his Clarksville home on August 9, 1931, aged 76. At the time of his death, he was a councilman for the city's fifth ward, and he was survived by his wife and four sons. His wife Hattie survived her husband by a quarter-century, and following her death at age 89 in 1956 was interred alongside him at the Greenwood Cemetery in Clarksville.\n\nFrom the Nashville Tennessean, August 10, 1931.\n\nPortrait from the Biographical History of North Carolina, Vol. III, 1906.\n\nThe figure of Malbourne Addison Angier stands prominent in the history of Durham, North Carolina, a city best known to most for being the home of both Duke University and the Bull Durham Tobacco Company. As the owner and operator of one of the first mercantile establishments in Durham, Angier was a pioneer businessman in the still-young city, and by the late 1870s, had turned his attention to elective office. He would serve one term in the state house of representatives from Orange County and in 1890 was elected to the first of three terms as Durham's mayor. Born on November 30, 1820, in Orange County, Malbourne Addison Angier was the son of Matthew and Sarah (Dollar) Angier.\n\nWhile Angier's later prominence in Durham is well recorded, little information exists on his formative years or education. He married in February 1853 to Mary Jane Pearson (1830-1906), to who he was wed for nearly five decades. The couple would have four children, William Jackson (1854-1924), Sarah Pearson (1856-1936), Jonathan Cicero (1857-1911), Pride (died in infancy in 1859), and Mary Gilmore (1861-1939). Of these children, Sarah Pearson Angier would marry Benjamin Newton Duke (1855-1929), an heir to the Duke tobacco fortune, a philanthropist, and vice president of the American Tobacco Company.\n\nFollowing the establishment of a North Carolina railroad depot in the early 1850s, physician Bartlett L. Durham (later the namesake of the city) and two partners opened one of the first mercantile stores in the vicinity of what would eventually grow into the city of Durham. Angier would serve as this store's clerk, and circa 1852 he and Durham partnered to form another general store, also located near the railway. This store sold liquor and other goods, and by the beginning of the 1860s Angier was operating his own mercantile store, located at a location later known as \"Angier's Corner\"\n\nWith his name firmly established in Durham's business sector, Angier saw the city incorporated in 1869 and also made headway into other aspects of area life, being a past master of the Durham Grange and in 1865 was a charter member of the Durham Academy. Prior to his legislative service, the only political office Angier had held was justice of the peace (eventually serving for fifty years), and in 1878 he received the Democratic nomination for state representative from Orange County. After emerging triumphant at the polls, Angier took his seat in January 1879 and during the 1879-80 session was named to the committees on Finance and Propositions and Grievances. He was not a candidate for reelection in 1880 and his term was later favorably remembered by the Biographical History of North Carolina, which noted:\n\n\"His service was honorable to himself and to his constituency and valuable to the affairs of the State.\"\n\nPortrait courtesy of Angier's wikitree.com page.\n\nFollowing his term, Angier returned to his earlier business interests and later served as a member of the Board of County Commissioners for Orange County. In the late 1880s, Governor Alfred Moore Scales appointed Angier to the board of directors of the North Carolina Railroad. Representing Durham on that board, Angier would be reelected in 1892 and would continue to serve until at least 1895. For an indeterminate period, he would also hold a seat on the Durham Board of Aldermen.\n\nIn May 1890 Malbourne A. Angier was elected as Mayor of Durham, \"by a majority of 177\", defeating several other candidates. He would serve in that capacity until May 1893 and in the year after leaving office took part as a member of the credentials committee for the 5th district's Democratic congressional convention.\n\nAngier's final years saw him continue prominence in Durham, with his being a charter trustee of the Watts Hospital in that city, as well as being the president of the Fidelity Savings and Trust Company in the late 1890s. He celebrated his 80th birthday in November 1900 and died one month later on December 29th, at his home. He was survived by his wife and children and was memorialized as a \"most loyal and honored citizen, a kind neighbor and a most true friend.\" Angier was interred at the Maplewood Cemetery in Durham, and two decades following his death was honored by his daughter Sarah Angier Duke with the unveiling of a bust of his likeness on the Durham courthouse lawn. This bust still stands today and denotes Angier's political service to his community.\n\nFrom the Raleigh Farmer and Mechanic, January 1, 1901."
