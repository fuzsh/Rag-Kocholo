        "text": "This paper advances an argument that within small polities local political talk radio may be treated as a barometer of public opinion. Survey research and media monitoring spending data were collected from provincial government departments across Canada. The data indicate that larger provinces turn to opinion polls, that the Quebec government is a heavy user of media monitoring services and that, in particular, government elites in Newfoundland and Labrador pay considerable attention to local open line call-in shows.\n\nLittle is known about how elected representatives attempt to manipulate public opinion and news media through their participation on regional open line radio or media straw polls. This article examines the systematic attempts by political actors to engage these media in the small polity of Newfoundland, Canada where politics is characterized by the hyper-local nature of 590-VOCM radio programming. Our mixed-method study draws from talk radio call-in logs, online straw poll vote results, observation of the production of open line programming and insights from local media personnel. We draw attention to two clandestine media management techniques. First, we analyze call-ins by elected legislators to talk radio that were timed to coincide with the known field dates of a public opinion polling company. Second, we report that handheld communication devices were used by senior members of the governing party to mobilize legislators and party personnel to repeatedly vote on straw polls on regional media websites. Our findings show that there is a substantial and statistically significant increase in the probability that legislators will call talk radio when pollsters are in the field. Further, we document and explore the manner in which political elites mobilize to engage online media straw polls, and discover that straw poll questions which address political topics attract a disproportionately higher number of “votes” than non-political questions. This micro-level study offers perspective for interpreting macro-level knowledge about political talk radio (PTR), horserace/game and strategic media frames, and about political elites’ mobilization and media management tactics.\n\nThis paper addresses the necessity for program-specific analysis in radio research by focusing on Jon Faine&#39;s Morning Program on ABC Radio 774 (Melbourne). After establishing the present prime minister&#39;s preference for radio appearances over all other types of media, I examine the extent to which Faine&#39;s particular iteration of talkback has the capacity to enhance public sphere activity, given the view that this medium is strategically being utilised by politicians to gain virtually uncontested access to listeners. My examination occurs principally through a morning&#39;s observation of Faine&#39;s program, supported by information from recordings of a constructed week of the program from the previous two months. My findings suggest that, while a certain amount of ‘top-down’ flow of information is unavoidable, some contestation of ideas often occurs, mitigating politicians’ exploitation of at least this particular program. Faine&#39;s program does, moreover, seem to give...\n\nNever before has the two-way flow of information between the public and elected officials been easier and, paradoxically, more complex than it is now. Changes in technology and media consumption are transforming the way people communicate about politics. Are they also changing the way politicians communicate to the public? In the era of the permanent campaign, negative advertising, personalized politics, and social media, Political Communication in Canada examines the way political parties, politicians, interest groups, the media, and citizens are using new tactics, tools, and channels to disseminate information, and also investigates the implications of these changes. Drawing on recent examples, contributors review the branding of the New Democratic Party, how Stephen Harper’s image is managed, and politicians’ use of Twitter. They also discuss the evolving role of political journalism, including the struggles of the Canadian Parliamentary Press Gallery, how the media covers politics, and how Canadians use the Internet for political discussions. At a time when political communication -- from political marketing to citizen journalism -- is of vital importance to the workings of government, this volume provides insight into how key political actors in Canada are conveying their messages and raises important questions about the future of Canadian democracy."
