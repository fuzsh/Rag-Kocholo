        "text": "IOI President Chris Field PSM was very pleased to have had the opportunity to make a submission to the Review of Statutory Offices of the House of Assembly of Newfoundland and Labrador, being undertaken by the Honourable Robert A. Fowler.\n\nIn the submission, President Field notes that within its sub-national, national and supranational framework, the Ombudsman institution plays a vital role in not only providing an impartial and independent mechanism for citizens to pursue their rights regarding wrongful government action, but also acts as a vital means of promoting and protecting integrity in public institutions, good governance, the rule of law and human rights.\n\n“The Review provides a welcome opportunity to further strengthen the Office of the Citizens’ Representative for Newfoundland and Labrador (Ombudsman), such that it continues to align with the Venice Principles and the latest iteration of the UN Resolution, ‘The role of Ombudsman and mediator institutions in the promotion and protection of human rights, good governance and the rule of law'” said President Field.\n\nKindly find the President's submission in the download section below or click here to read the submission on the Review website. Kindly also find the submission of the Forum of Canadian Ombudsman (FCO) in the download section below or click here above to read the submission on the Review website.\n\nSource: The Office of the IOI President and Western Australian Ombudsman"
