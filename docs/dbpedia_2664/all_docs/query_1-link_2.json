        "text": "Video: History of the Governance of Newfoundland and Labrador\n\nRepresentative/Responsible Government\n\nAs a result of a reform movement in the 1820s, the Colony of Newfoundland was first granted representative government in 1832. The Assembly consisted of 15 Members from nine electoral districts. The Governor and Legislative Council (Upper House) were appointed by the Crown. In 1855, Newfoundland was granted responsible government. The House of Assembly was increased to 29 Members (from 15 electoral districts), and the Cabinet became responsible to the Assembly. Prior to this, the appointed Legislative Council was the Cabinet and was not responsible to the Assembly.\n\nThe Dominion's first prime minister was Philip Francis Little.\n\nPrime Ministers from 1855 to 1934\n\nNational Convention and Confederation with Canada\n\nLocations of the House of Assembly\n\nThe first House of Assembly met on January 1, 1833, at a tavern and lodging house located on Duckworth Street in St. John's. It met at three more locations (the former Court House on Duckworth Street; a building on Water Street and the former St. Patrick’s Hall on Queen’s Road) before moving to the Colonial Building in 1850, Newfoundland’s first purpose-built Legislature. The House of Assembly continued to meet there until 1960 when it moved to the 9th and 10th floors of the Confederation Building. In 1991, the House of Assembly opened for the first time in its present location, on the main floor of the Confederation Building.\n\nMap of the early locations of the House of Assembly\n\nHistory of Women in the Newfoundland and Labrador Legislature"
