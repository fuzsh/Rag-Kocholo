In addition, the committee has investigated other topics of interest and importance to the country.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Committee was first created in May 1919 as the Committee on Finance, and in 1968, was renamed the Committee on National Finance. The committee's field of interest is government spending, either directly through the estimates or indirectly through bills that provide borrowing authority or bear upon the spending proposals identified in the estimates. The committee also has a mandate to examine reports of the Auditor General.\n\nIndependent Senators Group\n\nPat Duncan\n\nIndependent Senators Group (Yukon)\n\nPat Duncan is a former premier of Yukon, with extensive experience in business and as a public servant in the community. She holds a Bachelor of Arts from Carleton University.\n\nFrom 1996 to 2006, Ms. Duncan served as a member of the Yukon Legislative Assembly in various positions, including as the first female premier of the territory from 2000 to 2002. She was involved in reaching land claims agreements with First Nations in the Yukon and the transfer of power from the federal government to the territory, giving her an in-depth understanding of territorial and federal legislative processes.\n\nBefore entering politics, Ms. Duncan worked in small business and served as the executive director of the Whitehorse Chamber of Commerce. She later became a public servant in the territorial government and the manager of claimant services for the Yukon Workers' Compensation Health and Safety Board. In 2015, she was appointed as the manager of the Yukon Workers' Advocate Office.\n\nMs. Duncan has also been an active volunteer in her community.

In 2014, he received the Jean-Paul L'Allier Award, which honours a Quebec elected official for outstanding vision, leadership and achievements in urban planning and land use planning.

The mother of Michael and Madison, she is also a nationally renowned advocate who has spent nearly 40 years working in and around the legal and penal systems of Canada, with and on behalf of some of the most marginalized, victimized, criminalized and institutionalized — particularly imprisoned youth, men and women.\n\nSenator Pate graduated from Dalhousie Law School in 1984 with honours in the Clinical Law Programme and has completed post graduate work in the area of forensic mental health. She was the Executive Director of the Canadian Association of Elizabeth Fry Societies (CAEFS) from January 1992 until her appointment to the Senate in November 2016. CAEFS is a federation of local societies who provide services and work in coalition with Aboriginal women, women with mental health issues and other disabling conditions, young women, visible minority and immigrant women, poor women and those isolated and otherwise deprived of potential sources of support. Prior to her work with CAEFS, she worked with youth and men in a number of capacities with the local John Howard Society in Calgary, as well as the national office. She has developed and taught Prison Law, Human Rights and Social Justice and Defending Battered Women on Trial courses at the Faculties of Law at the University of Ottawa, Dalhousie University and the University of Saskatchewan. She also occupied the Sallows Chair in Human Rights at the University of Saskatchewan College of Law in 2014 and 2015.\n\nKim Pate is widely credited as the driving force behind the Inquiry into Certain Events at the Prison for Women in Kingston, headed by Justice Louise Arbour. During the Inquiry, she supported women as they aired their experiences and was a critical resource and witness in the Inquiry itself. She also persuaded the Attorney General and Minister of Justice to initiate the Self-Defence Review and appoint the Honourable Madam Justice Lynn Ratushny to review the convictions and sentences of women jailed for using lethal force to defend themselves and/or their children against abusive men. She then worked tirelessly in pursuit of the implementation of the many positive recommendations from both.\n\nSenator Pate has been instrumental in building coalitions across the country with other equality-seeking women's, anti-racism, anti-poverty and human rights groups and organizations; and, in this capacity, has worked with feminist legal scholars, lawyers, other professionals and front-line advocates and activists — from Indigenous communities to transition house and rape crisis centre workers.\n\nKim Pate is a member of the Order of Canada, a recipient of the Governor General's Award in Commemoration of the Persons Case, the Canadian Bar Association's Bertha Wilson Touchstone Award, and six honourary doctorates (Law Society of Upper Canada, University of Ottawa, Carleton University, St. Thomas University, Nipissing University and Wilfrid Laurier University) and numerous other awards. Her extensive list of publications, national and international speaking engagements and her strategic intervention and advocacy for substantive equality testify to her commitment to broader social, economic and cultural change. She continues to make significant contributions to public education around the issues of women's inequality and discriminatory treatment within social, economic and criminal justice spheres.\n\nSenator Pate strongly believes that the contributions of women who have experienced marginalization, discrimination and oppression should be recognized and respected and she seeks to credit and empower women. She maintains contact with women in prison through her numerous visits to Canada's federal prisons and strongly encourages other advocates, scholars, service providers, judges and parliamentarians to ground their efforts in a similar way.\n\nConservative Senators\n\nElizabeth Marshall\n\nConservative (Newfoundland and Labrador)\n\nElizabeth Marshall was appointed to the Senate of Canada in January of 2010 having previously spent 30 years with the Newfoundland and Labrador Public Service, the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador, and the Newfoundland and Labrador House of Assembly.

Another meeting is planned for June 6, 2023, along with Treasury Board Secretariat officials, to address the Service Fees Act amendments (Part 4, Division 12).\n\nIn addition, eight other Senate committees have collectively held a total of 30 meetings studying parts of C-47 related to their mandates. Five of these committees have reported on the bill, and their findings are summarized below.\n\nGiven the diversity within the Senate there is a wide range of perspectives on C-47. Overall, the bill has been fairly well received in the Senate with no measures appearing to face significant opposition (aside from Conservative Party Senators who, like their colleagues in the House, can be expected to oppose most measures in the bill). Senators' Questions have tended to focus on technical clarifications and building their understanding of the measures.\n\nGiven the diversity within the Senate there is a wide range of perspectives on C-47. Overall, the bill has been fairly well received in the Senate with no measures appearing to face significant opposition (aside from Conservative Party Senators who, like their colleagues in the House, can be expected to oppose most measures in the bill). Senators' Questions have tended to focus on technical clarifications and building their understanding of the measures.\n\nA recurring concern expressed by a number of Senators is that many of the measures in Part 4 ('Various Measures') should not have been included in a Budget bill. Given their significant impacts, they believe they should have been in a stand-alone bill which would allow Senators to scrutinize them closer.\n\nSenate National Finance Members' Main Interests Related to C-47\n\nWhile they have not taken a particularly critical stance on any measures, Senators on NFFN have paid most attention to the GST/HST treatment of crypto asset mining, payment card clearing services and alcohol excise duty.\n\nTreatment of \"Mining\" of Crypto Assets under the GST/HST (Part 2 (c))\n\nQuestions on this topic have been primarily related to technical clarifications. Senator Moncion (ISG) asked Finance officials about how the government is tracking the individual miners within crypto asset mining pools.\n\nSenator Dagenais (CSG) asked officials for a summary of the taxes that are applicable on crypto assets and whether these represent a significant source of revenue for the government.\n\nSenators who are not members of NFFN have also asked many questions about this measure. Senator Deacon (ISG) asked stakeholders if the C-47 measures are a disincentive to providing digital service exports. Other lines of questioning focussed on whether government regulation was hindering the growth of the crypto industry in Canada, and the role cryptocurrencies have in illicit activity such as money laundering and tax avoidance.\n\nA representative of the Digital Asset Mining Coalition later appeared at NFFN, where Senator Marshall (C) asked if crypto companies would continue to leave if this measure was implemented. It was noted that no crypto companies have decided to move but investments decisions have been put on hold. Questions surrounding provincial competitiveness were also raised by Senator Yussuf (ISG) at a BANC committee.\n\nGST/HST Treatment of Payment Card Clearing Services (Part 2(d))\n\nThe Canadian Bankers Association (CBA) expressed major concerns about the payment card clearing services measures, specifically Part 2, clauses 114 to 116, which retroactively amend the Excise Tax Act. The CBA expressed concern that the retroactivity was unprecedented and criticized the Department of Finance for a lack of consultation before introducing the measures in C-47. However, in response to questions from Senator Loffreda (ISG), Finance officials explained that there had been discussions with banks regarding this measure.\n\n*Bullet redacted.*\n\nAlcohol Excise Duty (Excise Act and Excise Act, 2001) (Part 3, Division 1)\n\nQuestions on this measure centred on the impact the Excise Tax has on local and small breweries and distilleries. Senator Forest (ISG) noted that he opposes the automatic increase of the Excise Tax, and asked stakeholders if the tax contributed to any significant price difference between large scale and local spirits.\n\nOther Measures of Interest to NFFN Members\n\nReporting Rules for Platform Operators (Part 1(n))\n\nSenator Galvez (ISG) asked if the government has data on e-commerce transactions, including which platforms are used, where they are located, and tax information. Finance officials noted that with the implementation of this measure they will be able to build a database and increase compliance.\n\nCanada Growth Fund (Part 4, Division 32)\n\nSenator Marshall (C) sought clarity from Alex Gray of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce (CCC) on whether members had asked for the creation of the Canada Growth Fund (CGF), Canada Innovation Corporation, or the Strategic Innovation Fund. He responded that they had not. Mr. Gray further indicated his support for the CGF and his trust in PSP Investments, while noting the structure of the CGF seemed unusual.\n\nCanada Transportation Act – Supporting Rail Competition (Interswitching) (Division 22, Part 4)\n\nSenator Marshall (C) inquired whether there were consultations between the government and the Railway Association of Canada.\n\nSenator Forest (ISG) asked what the difference is between this pilot the one from 2014 to 2017. The representative from the Canadian Canola Growers Association (CCGA) responded that the proposed measure accounts for differences in the supply chain over the past six years and welcomed it as it could improve competition through increasing the availability of rail service.\n\nAir Travel Complaints (Division 23, Part 4)\n\nSenator Marshall (C) asked who would be responsible for the additional costs of the Air Passengers Protection ActFootnote 1. The representative from the National Airlines Council of Canada responded that it would fall to the airlines.\n\nOther Standing Senate Committees Views on C-47\n\nStanding Senate Committee on Banking, Commerce, and the Economy (BANC)\n\nIn its report on C-47, the committee noted the following concerns:\n\nTreatment of \"Mining\" of Crypto Assets under the GST/HST (Part 2 (c))\n\nThe committee is concerned that despite the consultations held by the Department of Finance Canada in 2022 on this topic, there is still ambiguity related to its implementation. The committee suggests that the department consult again with stakeholders, in particular to address concerns of the Digital Asset Mining Coalition.\n\nExternal Complaints Body (Bank Act) (Part 4, Division 1)\n\nThe committee is supportive of this measure but suggests that a deadline, such as one year after Royal Assent of the bill, be considered for the designation of the new external complaints body.\n\nStrengthening The Federal Pension Framework (Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985) (Part 4, Division 2)\n\nThe committee notes that they do not have sufficient information on this topic, particularly with respect to issues such as the expected market and scale for variable payment life annuities.\n\nLegislation to Establish the Canada Innovation Corporation (Part 4, Division 7)\n\nThe committee suggests that the government conduct an evaluation of the Canada Innovation Corporation three years after its establishment to determine whether it has been successful in meeting its mandate and that it publish the results of this in-depth evaluation in its annual report that should be tabled in Parliament.\n\nAdditionally, the committee notes its expectation that the government will consult with stakeholders, as certain stakeholders to the committee indicated previous consultations were inadequate.\n\nStanding Senate Committee on Energy, the Environment and Natural Resources (ENEV)\n\nOn the Clean Fuels Regulation FundFootnote 2 (Part 4, Division 36), Senators heard from the Canadian Fuels Association, Pembina Institute and Renewable Industries Canada. While these organizations expressed their support for this measure, they noted that it should be used as a last resort for compliance and that there are outstanding questions related to how the fund will operate.\n\nStanding Senate Committee on Fisheries and Oceans (POFO)\n\nPOFO released its report on C-47 and noted that the Oceans Protection Plan (Part 4, Division 21) measures are very technical in nature and should have been introduced through separate legislation rather than through the Budget Implementation Act. Otherwise, no substantive concerns were raised by Senators regarding Division 21.\n\nWhen appearing, the Shipping Federation of Canada noted its concerns with subdivision C of the measure:\n\nThe new obligations for Ship Masters as the consequences of these obligations are unclear.\n\nConcerns over the power given to the Minister of Transport, noting that this could be seen as an erosion of the regulatory process.\n\nSenators did not seem swayed by the witness testimony and asked if the Government consulted with the Canadian Shipping Federation. Officials stated that the organization was consulted over the last year, and that they provided comments on this proposed measure.\n\nStanding Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Trade (AEFA)\n\nThe committee notes in its report that members have no objections to the parts of the bill related to the Preferential Tariff for Developing Countries, Removal of Most-Favoured-Nation Tariff Treatment for Belarus and Russia, Economic Sanction - Special Economic Measures Act, NATO Climate Change and Security Centre of Excellence - Privileges and Immunities (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) Act, and Subdivision A of the Measures Related to Money Laundering and to Digital Assets and Other Measures.\n\nHowever, during their meetings several Senators asked questions about the Money Laundering and Digital Assets measures. Senator Coyle (ISG) asked Finance officials whether this measure will protect whistleblowers who report wrongdoing. Senator Gerba (GSP) asked officials if the Bill sufficiently addresses concerns raised by the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC) regarding the use of new technologies such as cryptocurrencies to conduct illicit activity.\n\nRegarding the Preferential Tariff for Developing Countries (Part 4, Division 4), Senator Deacon focused her questioning on the Least Developed Country Tariff (LDCT) program. She enquired about whether it would remedy the environmental and societal effects of fast fashion, notably underpaid labour, water pollution and micro plastics.\n\nStanding Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs (LCJC)\n\nSenator Simons (ISG) noted her \"delight\" that Criminal Rate of Interest, Criminal Code (Division 34, Part 4) measure would lower the rate, but she has remaining concerns that the government will need to monitor the industry to ensure that another, or more predatory institution does not emerge to work around the rules.\n\nStanding Senate Committee on National Security, Defence and Veterans Affairs (SECD)\n\nIn its C-47 report, SECD committee members outline their support for the Legislative Amendments Enabling the Canada Border Services Agency's Traveler Modernization Initiative (Customs Act) (Division 24, Part 4), noting that they recognize the benefits that this measure could bring to travelers.\n\nHowever, they outlined four areas of concern:\n\nPrivacy - The Canadian Bar Association raised privacy concerns given the authority this measure gives to CBSA to collect and store personal information.\n\nDifferential impacts on various groups of travelers, for example it is important that the technologies adopted do not have a negative impact on people with disabilities or those who choose not to use a digital device when travelling.\n\nBorder security - There is a concern that this measure may reduce the accuracy in conducting risk assessments of passengers.\n\nConsultations with CBSA officers' union - CBSA representatives noted that the union was not consulted regarding the changes made to the Customs Act.\n\nStanding Senate Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology (SOCI)\n\nSenator Seidman (C) expressed her support for Strengthening Regulatory Oversight of Natural Health Products (Food and Drugs Act) (Division 27, Part 4), noting the importance of monitoring natural health products.\n\nRegarding The Canadian Dental Care Plan – Reporting Requirements for Employer-Provided Dental Coverage (Division 29, Part 4), Senator Omidvar (ISG) asked how the government will ensure that Canadians who could benefit from the program, but don't file tax returns, will be able to access it.\n\nSenator Mégie (ISG) raised the concern that employers may no longer provide insurance benefits as a result of the Dental Care Plan.\n\nStanding Senate Committee on Transport and Communications (TRCM)\n\nIn its report on C-47, the committee expressed its support for the Bill, while noting that the Canadian Air Transport Authority (Amendments to the Air Travellers Security Charge Act) , Canada Transportation Act (Strengthening Data Sharing in Trade Corridors and Interswitching), and Strengthening Air Passenger Rights and Data Sharing (Air Travel Complaints) measures have no clear connection to the government budgetary policy, and in the future these types of measures should be included in a separate bill.\n\nTable 1 : Branch Review: Cost of Measures in Budget Implementation Act 2023, No. 1\n\nCosting Summary of Bill C-47, Budget Implementation Act, 2023, No 1\n\nThe total net fiscal impact of measures in the 2023 BIA No. 1 is $7.0 billion over six years (2022-23 to 2027-28) on an accrual basis (yellow shaded cell in attached Annex).\n\nThe largest expenditure measures in the bill are the :\n\nCanada Workers Benefit (CWB) Automatic Advance: $4.0 billion\n\nGrocery Rebate: $2.5 billion\n\nFederal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act (Canada Health Transfer): $2.0 billion\n\nThe largest revenue raising measures in the bill are:\n\nAir Travelers Security Charge: -$1.2B\n\nHedging and Short Selling by Canadian Financial Institutions: -$0.8B\n\nGST/HST Treatment of Payment Card Clearing Services: $-$0.2B\n\nAdditional information regarding the GST/HST treatment of payment card clearing services measure in C-47\n\nWhat was the tax treatment situation in 1991 as of the introduction of the GST?\n\nSupplies of financial services are generally GST/HST \"exempt\". This means GST/HST is not charged on supplies of financial services and the supplier cannot claim input tax credits (ITCs) on their inputs to these services.\n\nHowever, non-financial inputs to financial services—even if they are essential to those financial services—are taxable. These include, for example, information technology, payment processing and other administrative services where the service provider is generally not at risk.\n\nThe federal government has always been clear that payment card clearing services are taxable administrative services and not GST/HST-exempt \"financial services\". In particular, in a December 5, 1991, press release the Department of Finance announced its intention to make an amendment to the GST/HST legislation (later enacted) in order to clarify that these services are not \"financial services\" for GST/HST purposes.\n\nFor this reason, payment card network operators (e.g., Visa, Interac) have always charged GST/HST on their services (and they were therefore entitled to claim ITCs).\n\nPurchasers of these services (e.g., banks and acquirers) have always paid GST/HST on these services. And since they themselves are providing exempt financial services, they generally cannot claim ITCs to recover the tax (as was and is the policy intent).\n\nWhat has the tax treatment been since the recent court ruling. How did the law change from 1991?\n\nCIBC disagreed with the government's policy position, so they challenged it in court.\n\nIn 2018, the Tax Court of Canada agreed with the government that payment card clearing services are taxable administrative services.\n\nCIBC appealed and in January 2021 the Federal Court of Appeal held that these services are exempt \"financial services\".\n\nThis recharacterization (from taxable to exempt) entitled all purchasers of these services (e.g., banks and acquirers) to stop paying tax going forward AND to file \"tax-paid-in-error\" rebate claims with the CRA to recover tax that they had paid on these services in the past.\n\nThese rebate claims are windfall gains. They relate to transactions that had been negotiated on the basis that the services were taxable (i.e., on the basis that CIBC would pay GST/HST, and that Visa would be entitled to claim ITCs).\n\nThe government disagreed with the FCA decision but did not seek leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada *portion of sentence redacted*.\n\nInstead, Finance Canada developed legislative amendments to counteract the adverse decision, which were announced in Budget 2023.\n\nWe understand that Visa continued charging GST/HST for some months after the FCA decision on the expectation that the federal government would either seek leave to appeal or would introduce retrospective amendments.\n\nWhat is C-47 changing since the court ruling?\n\nBill C-47 reaffirms and restores the government's policy position that payment card clearing services are taxable administrative services by specifically carving payment card clearing services out of the \"financial service\" definition.\n\nTo counteract the FCA decision, the amendments must apply prospectively and retrospectively. However, they generally only apply retrospectively where the parties had treated the supplies as taxable. If the parties had entered into brand new agreements under which payment card clearing services were always treated as exempt (never taxable), the Bill C-47 amendments would not apply.\n\nRetrospective application is necessary to:\n\nPrevent significant windfall gains (e.g., rebates to banks, as noted above).\n\nProtect federal and provincial GST/HST/QST revenues. We estimate that, if the amendment were not made, Canada, and the 5 HST provinces would incur total revenue losses *portion of bullet redacted*.\n\nProtect suppliers (such as Visa and Interac), who correctly claimed ITCs in the past and were at risk of losing them because the FCA recharacterized their supplies as exempt (thus disentitling them to claim ITCs).\n\nWhat were the windfall payments to banks?\n\nWindfall gains relate to the \"tax-paid-in-error\" rebates claims made in respect of past transactions (described in the table of questions below). *Sentences redacted*.\n\n*Table redacted*\n\nAmendments to Bill C-47 (BIA 2023) Adopted by the House Standing Committee on Finance (FINA)\n\nAn Act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on March 28, 2023 – Overviews\n\nTable of Contents\n\nPart 1 -

These proposed measures would improve the Canada Revenue Agency's ability to operate digitally, resulting in faster, more convenient and accurate service, while also enhancing security.\n\nThe following changes would be made:\n\nEliminate the legislative requirement for handwritten signatures, allowing for the use of electronic signatures on specific forms. (Would come into force on January 1, 2024).\n\nAllow for an individual's Notice of Assessment (NOA) to be sent electronically only where the individual files electronically and consents to receive notices and other communications electronically. (Would come into force on January 1, 2024).\n\nLower the threshold for mandatory electronic filing of prescribed information returns from fifty to five slips. (Would apply in respect of information returns filed after 2023).\n\nAllow issuers to provide an electronic version of T4/T5 tax information slips in the electronic account of the recipient without having to also issue a paper copy, unless recipients request a paper copy for these slips, or online portals are unavailable. (Would apply in respect of information returns filed after 2021).\n\nFor tax preparers charging a fee to prepare tax returns, the threshold to file electronically and register as a tax preparer would be lowered from ten to five individual, corporate or trusts returns. The limit on the number of paper returns that can be filed by a tax preparer would be reduced to a maximum of five, rather than ten. (Would come into force on January 1, 2024).\n\nEliminate the existing mandatory electronic filing (MEF) thresholds in gross revenue for corporate income tax returns and taxable supplies for GST/HST, and require that all corporations and registrants file electronically, after a phased-in approach from paper to digital, to allow businesses to adjust and comply with the requirement. (Would apply starting in 2024).\n\nIntroduce mandatory electronic payments for remittances over $10,000 under the Income Tax Act; and lower the threshold for mandatory remittances at a financial institution from $50,000 to $10,000, in the GST/HST portion of the Excise Tax Act, the Excise Act, 2001, the Air Travellers Security Charge Act and Part 1 of the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, while also allowing such payments to be made electronically. (Would apply in respect of payments or remittances made after 2023).\n\nDoubling the Deduction for Tradespeople's Tools\n\nThe tradespeople's tool expense deduction provides tax recognition for the extraordinary cost of tools that employed tradespeople must provide as a condition of employment. Under current rules, a tradesperson can claim the amount of eligible tool expenses that exceeds the Canada Employment Credit ($1,368 in 2023), up to a maximum of $500.\n\nThe proposal would increase the maximum deduction for tradespeople's tools from $500 to $1,000, effective for the 2023 and subsequent taxation years.\n\nExtending the Residential Property Flipping Rule to Assignment Sales (Anti-Flipping Tax)\n\nThe Residential Property Flipping Rule helps ensure that profits from flipping residential real estate are taxed as business income. This rule would be extended to profits arising from the sale of a right to purchase a residential property.\n\nSpecifically, any person who realizes a gain on the sale of a right to purchase a residential property would be deemed to carry on a business with respect to this right if it was owned for less than 365 days (12-month holding period). Accordingly, this gain would be subject to full taxation as business income, which means that it would not benefit from the 50-per-cent capital gains inclusion rate. The exceptions applying to the Residential Property Flipping Rule would also apply to this extension. They include certain life-event circumstances, such as a death, disability, the birth of a child, a new job, a divorce, a threat to personal safety, and the destruction of the property.\n\nThe 12-month holding period would reset once a taxpayer secures ownership of the property. This would ensure the Residential Property Flipping Rule cannot be bypassed when selling a constructed property simply because a taxpayer held the right to purchase the property before it was constructed.\n\nThis extended rule would not change the tax treatment for an individual who is already considered to be carrying on a business under existing law. Similarly, where the rule does not apply because of a life event or because a right to purchase a property was owned for 12 months or more, whether profits from the disposition are properly taxed as business income would depend on all the relevant facts. This would be determined in accordance with existing law.\n\nThe extension of the Residential Property Flipping Rule would apply in respect of transactions occurring on or after January 1, 2023.\n\nTaxation of Veterans' and Active Members' Benefit\n\nVeterans Affairs Canada and the Department of National Defence provide a number of tax-free benefits to ill and injured veterans and service members, and their families. While these benefits have always been treated as tax-free, they are not explicitly excluded from income under the Income Tax Act. To clarify and confirm their tax-free status, the government proposes to amend the Income Tax Act to exclude the following benefits from a taxpayer's income:\n\nbenefits provided under the Veterans Health Care Regulations,\n\nrehabilitation services and vocational assistance,\n\nhome modifications benefit,\n\nhome modifications move benefit,\n\nvehicle modifications benefit,\n\nhome assistance benefit,\n\nattendant care benefit,\n\ncaregiver benefit,\n\nspousal education upgrade benefit,\n\nfuneral and burial expenses benefit,\n\nnext of kin travel benefit, and\n\neducation expense reimbursement for ill and injured members.\n\nThis measure would apply effective for the 2021 and subsequent taxation years in respect of education expense reimbursement for ill and injured members, and effective for the 2018 and subsequent taxation years in respect of all other benefits.\n\nTechnical Tax Changes - Gottfriedson Class Settlement Agreement\n\nOn January 18, 2023, the government entered into the Gottfriedson Band Class Settlement Agreement. This agreement relates to a class action proceeding on behalf of 325 Indian Act bands and Indigenous self-governments, regarding the social and cultural harm caused to Indigenous communities by the Indian Residential School system.\n\nThe Settlement Agreement, which was approved by the court in March 2023, provides for establishment of a $2.8 billion trust for the benefit of the 325 Indian Act bands and Indigenous self-governments, with a focus on promoting Indigenous languages, cultures, heritage and wellness.\n\nThe Settlement Agreement committed the government to make best efforts to exempt income earned by the trust from taxation.\n\nThis measure, therefore, would amend the Income Tax Act to exclude the income of the trust established under the Gottfriedson Band Class Settlement Agreement from taxation, in order to fulfill the tax treatment commitment of the Settlement Agreement. The amendment would apply beginning with the 2023 taxation year.\n\nGrocery Rebate\n\nThis measure provides temporary financial support for low- and modest-income Canadians through a special, one-time Grocery Rebate delivered through the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Credit system.\n\nThe Grocery Rebate would be equivalent to doubling the GST Credit for six months. It would be based on eligibility to the GST Credit in January 2023 and would automatically be delivered by the Canada Revenue Agency. The additional support would be paid as soon as possible following the passage of this Bill, using the GST Credit system.\n\nAutomatic Advance for the Canada Workers Benefit\n\nThe Canada Workers Benefit (CWB) is a refundable tax credit that supplements the earnings of low- and modest-income workers making work more rewarding and attractive for this group and providing an important source of income support. An individual claims the CWB when completing their tax return, but filers are automatically assessed by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) for eligibility if the CWB is not claimed.\n\nThis measure would automatically issue quarterly advance payments of the CWB to those who qualified for the benefit in the previous year, starting in July 2023 for the 2023 taxation year. These advance payments would generally total half of the previous year's entitlement and would represent a minimum entitlement for the year. That is, an individual may be entitled to more at the end of the year, which would be provided when filing their tax return, but their entitlement at the end of the year would not be less than their advance payment entitlement for the year.\n\nImproving Registered Education Savings Plans\n\nRegistered Education Savings Plans (RESPs) are tax-assisted savings vehicles designed to help families accumulate savings for the post-secondary education of their children. Contributions to RESPs may be eligible for government matching grants. When an RESP beneficiary is enrolled in an eligible post-secondary program, government grants and investment earnings can be withdrawn from the plan as Educational Assistance Payments.\n\nTo help ensure that Educational Assistance Payments are used to fund expenses related to post-secondary education, the Income Tax Act places limits on the maximum amount of Educational Assistance Payments that can be withdrawn under the terms of an RESP. This measure would amend the Income Tax Act to raise the limits on Educational Assistance Payment withdrawals as follows:\n\nfor beneficiaries enrolled full-time (i.e., in a program of at least three consecutive weeks' duration requiring at least ten hours per week of courses or work in the program), the withdrawal limit in the first 13 weeks of study would increase from $5,000 to $8,000; and\n\nfor beneficiaries enrolled part-time (i.e., in a program of at least three consecutive weeks' duration requiring at least 12 hours per month of courses in the program), the withdrawal limit per 13-week period would increase from $2,500 to $4,000.\n\nAdditionally, this measure would amend the Income Tax Act to enable divorced or separated parents to open joint RESPs for their child or children and to move an existing joint RESP to another promoter.\n\nThese changes would come into force on March 28, 2023.\n\nRegistered Disability Savings Plan – Qualifying Family Member Provision\n\nRegistered Disability Savings Plans (RDSPs) are tax-assisted savings vehicles for people who are eligible for the Disability Tax Credit. To encourage saving in an RDSP, the government supplements private contributions with Disability Savings Grants and Bonds.\n\nSince the assets held in an RDSP are the property of its beneficiary, the plan holder must be the beneficiary, unless they have mental disabilities and their ability to enter into an RDSP contract is in doubt, in which case the plan holder must be their legal representative for matters of property as recognized under provincial/territorial law.\n\nThe existing temporary RDSP Qualifying Family Member provision provides a way for a parent, spouse or common-law partner to open and manage an RDSP for an adult whose capacity to enter into an RDSP agreement is in doubt and who does not have a legal representative.\n\nThis proposal would amend the Income Tax Act to extend the Qualifying Family Member provision by three years, to December 31, 2026, and expand the definition of a qualifying family member to include a sibling of the beneficiary. After the expiry date, any existing qualifying family member plan holder would be allowed to remain the plan holder.\n\nThe expansion of the qualifying family member definition would apply as of royal assent.\n\nFixing Contribution Errors in Defined Contribution Pension Plans\n\nThe rules in the Income Tax Act do not currently permit pension plan administrators to accept retroactive contributions to employee accounts under a defined contribution pension plan in order to correct under-contribution errors in respect of prior years. Although in some circumstances over-contribution errors may be corrected by refunding the excess to the contributor, these rules have been found to be cumbersome.\n\nThis measure provides more flexibility to plan administrators of defined contribution pension plans to correct for both under-contributions and over-contributions. The measure permits certain types of errors to be corrected via additional contributions to an employee's account under a defined contribution pension plan to compensate for an under-contribution error made in any of the preceding 10 years, subject to a dollar limit. The measure also permits plan administrators to correct an employee's RRSP contribution limit for pension over-contribution errors in respect of an employee for any of the 10 years prior to the year in which the excess amount is refunded to the employee or employer, as the case may be, who made the contribution.\n\nTo simplify reporting requirements, the measure requires the plan administrator to file a prescribed form in respect of each affected employee, rather than to amend T4 slips for prior years. Additional contributions to correct for under-contributions would reduce the employee's RRSP contribution room for the taxation year following the year in which the retroactive contribution is made. To the extent this results in negative RRSP room, it would only impact the employee's contributions in future years. Refunds of over-contributions would generally restore the employee's RRSP contribution room for the taxation year in which the refund is made.\n\nMandatory Reporting\n\nThe Income Tax Act contains rules requiring that certain transactions related to aggressive tax planning strategies be reported to the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA). Early access to information on these transactions provides the government with the opportunity to respond quickly to tax risks through informed risk assessments, audits and changes to legislation. However, the CRA's experience with these rules since their introduction indicates that they are not sufficiently robust to address these concerns.\n\nBudget 2021 announced a consultation on proposals to enhance these mandatory disclosure rules.\n\nThis measure enacts changes resulting from the consultation, which are intended to align Canada's rules with the best practices recommended by the Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, Action 12: Final Report of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Group of 20 in relation to mandatory disclosure rules, and similar rules which have been implemented in jurisdictions with comparable tax systems.\n\nThese changes are intended to broaden the scope of reporting obligations in the case of transactions that are perceived to be aggressive or high-risk from a tax compliance perspective. These changes include:\n\nlowering the thresholds for transactions to be considered reportable transactions, which are identified through the existence of generic hallmarks in relation to fees, confidential protections and contractual protections;\n\nthe creation of a new requirement to report notifiable transactions, which are the same as (or substantially similar to) transactions designated by the Minister of National Revenue, with the concurrence of the Minister of Finance;\n\nthe creation of a new requirement for certain large corporations to report uncertain tax treatments (i.e., where there is uncertainty over whether the tax filing position will be accepted as being in accordance with tax law) that are generally reflected in their audited financial statements; and\n\nrelated rules providing for, in certain circumstances, the extension of the applicable reassessment period and the introduction of penalties.\n\nThese changes apply to transactions entered into after royal assent of this bill, except that the changes to rules for uncertain tax treatments apply to taxation years that begin after 2022.\n\nTechnical Tax Changes - Dental Program - Taxpayer Information Sharing for Canadian Dental Care Plan\n\nTo ensure that taxpayer information is safeguarded, the income tax rules limit the use and disclosure of taxpayer information by the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) to specific circumstances.\n\nTo support implementation of the Canada Dental Benefit, which is the interim dental care program for under 12-year-olds launched in 2022, the Income Tax Act and other tax statutes were amended as part of Bill C-31 to permit the CRA to use taxpayer information to administer and enforce the program and share taxpayer information with Health Canada for the evaluation or formulation of policy for the program.\n\nSince those amendments only apply to the Canada Dental Benefit Act, which is the legislation for the interim Canada Dental Benefit, similar amendments are proposed to the Income Tax Act, Excise Tax Act and the Excise Act, 2001 in order for Health Canada and Employment and Social Development Canada to access taxpayer information for the purposes of delivering the permanent Canadian Dental Care Plan.\n\nThese measures would come into force upon royal assent.\n\nHedging and Short Selling by Canadian Financial Institutions\n\nThe Income Tax Act generally permits a Canadian corporation, in computing its taxable income, to claim a deduction (the \"dividend received deduction\") for the amount of a taxable dividend received on a share (a \"Canadian share\") that it holds in another Canadian corporation.\n\nThis measure was proposed in Budget 2022 and would deny the dividend received deduction for dividends received on Canadian shares where members of a Canadian financial institution group enter into transactions that effectively eliminate the group's economic exposure to the shares through the use of a physical short sale (a \"specified hedging transaction\"). This would prevent the unintended tax consequences that result from specified hedging transactions where more than one tax deduction is be claimed in respect of the same dividend.\n\nWhere a dividend received deduction is denied in respect of the shares in a specified hedging transaction, the proposal would also allow the registered securities dealer to claim a full deduction (instead of the current two thirds deduction) for any dividend compensation payment that it makes under a securities loan facilitating the short sale. Consequently, where a Canadian financial institution group receives a $90 dividend and a registered securities dealer in the group makes a $90 dividend compensation payment (leaving the group economically flat), the new rule would result in that group having a $90 income inclusion and an offsetting $90 deduction rather than a $90 income inclusion and a $150 deduction (a $90 dividend received deduction plus a $60 dividend compensation payment deduction).\n\nThe measure would apply to dividends received on or after April 7, 2022, or to dividends received after September 2022 where the specified hedging transaction was entered into before April 7, 2022.\n\nReporting Rules for Platform Operators\n\nThis measure would implement rules for tax reporting by digital platform operators with respect to users (platform sellers) who provide goods or certain services to other users through those platforms. These rules are in line with the OECD model rules and would enhance compliance in that sector. The information reported through this measure would help platform sellers in understanding the tax implications of their activities, and also provide the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) with more tools to identify non-compliance.\n\nThe information sharing rules would fit into the OECD's information sharing framework, which is designed to minimize administrative burden by providing for the sharing of information between tax administrations. An online platform would generally need to report information to only one jurisdiction, and that jurisdiction would then share the information with partner jurisdictions based on the residence of each platform seller earning revenue through the platform (and, in the case of a rental property, the jurisdiction where the rental property is located). The exchanges would take place under the exchange of information provisions in tax treaties and similar international instruments, which provide important safeguards to protect taxpayer confidentiality and ensure that the exchanged information is not used inappropriately.\n\nThis measure would require platform operators subject to the rules (reporting platform operators) that provide support to reportable sellers for relevant activities to determine the jurisdiction of residence of their reportable sellers and report certain information on them. The conditions for qualifying as a reportable seller and relevant activity are discussed below.\n\nThe rules are targeted at online platforms of the sharing and gig economy, as well as platforms that allow third parties to sell goods to users through their platform. The rules would generally exclude pure payment processors, classified ads boards, and online aggregators.\n\nThe measure would generally apply to platform operators that are resident for tax purposes in Canada. The measure would also apply to platform operators that are not resident in Canada or a partner jurisdiction and that facilitate relevant activities by sellers resident in Canada or with respect to the rental of immovable property located in Canada. A partner jurisdiction would be a jurisdiction that has implemented similar reporting requirements on platform operators and that has agreed to exchange information with the CRA on reportable sellers.\n\nFor the purposes of this measure, relevant activities would be comprised of the sale of goods and the provision of the following services:\n\npersonal services, for example, transportation and delivery services, manual labour, tutoring, data manipulation and clerical, legal or accounting tasks;\n\nthe rental of immovable property (e.g., residential property); and\n\nthe rental of means of transportation.\n\nA reportable seller would be an active seller who is registered on a platform to provide relevant activities. Sellers that represent a limited compliance risk would not be reportable sellers. These include:\n\npublicly traded entities;\n\nlarge providers of hotel accommodation; and\n\nwith respect to the sales of goods, sellers who make less than 30 sales a year for a total of not more than $2,800.\n\nThis measure would apply as of the 2024 calendar year. This would allow the first reporting and exchange of information to take place in early 2025.\n\nSupplementary Reporting for Registered Retirement Savings Plans (RRSP) and Registered Retirement Income Funds (RRIF)\n\nFinancial institutions are currently required to report annually to the Canada Revenue Agency the payments out of, and contributions to, each registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) and registered retirement income fund (RRIF) that they administer.\n\nThe new tax measure would require financial institutions to annually report to the Canada Revenue Agency the total fair market value, determined at the end of the calendar year, of property held in each RRSP and RRIF that they administer, starting in early 2024 in respect of the 2023 calendar year.\n\nCollecting information about fair market values in all RRSPs and RRIFs in Canada will provide an important database for risk-assessment and policy purposes. Of note, this information would assist the Canada Revenue Agency in its risk-assessment activities regarding qualified investments held by RRSPs and RRIFs.\n\nBorrowing by Registered Pension Plans\n\nRegistered pension plans are generally restricted from borrowing money, with two exceptions. The first exception is borrowing money to acquire income producing real property. The second is borrowing for periods not exceeding 90 days, where plan assets are not pledged as collateral, and the borrowing is necessary to avoid the distressed sale of plan assets.\n\nThis measure would allow defined benefit registered pension plans to borrow additional money (in excess of what is permitted under the current rules) equal to 20% of the plan's net assets. Additional borrowing under this new rule would be prohibited at any time that a defined benefit plan's funded ratio (assets to liabilities) exceeds 125%. Registered pension plans could also continue to borrow pursuant to the existing two tests described above.\n\nPlan administrators would need to continue complying with the provisions of federal or provincial pension benefit standards legislation that ensure that investments are made in a reasonable and prudent manner and that the plan is funded in accordance with prescribed funding standards.\n\nThis measure would apply to amounts borrowed on or after April 7, 2022.\n\nTechnical Amendments to the Income Tax Act\n\nThis measure would implement several technical amendments to the Income Tax Act. The changes are highly technical in nature, and are generally intended to align the law with its intended policy. They generally fall into the following categories:\n\nAmendments that correct drafting errors or clarify uncertainties, including typographical errors and differences between the English and French versions of the Income Tax Act.\n\nRelieving changes that address situations where the law does not apply appropriately in a particular situation, having regard to the policy objectives of the relevant rules.\n\nIntegrity changes that address deficiencies in the wording of the legislation, and which are generally intended to prevent sophisticated taxpayers from obtaining unintended tax benefits through tax planning.\n\nThe coming into force dates for the changes in this measure vary depending on the nature of the change. In general, relieving amendments would have retroactive effect while tightening changes would apply as of the date the proposed amendments were first publicly announced.\n\nPart 2 - GST / HST Measures\n\nTreatment of \"Mining\" of Crypto Assets Under the GST/HST\n\nCryptoasset mining is generally the use of computing resources to process transactions of cryptoassets (e.g., Bitcoin).\n\nThe measure clarifies the GST/HST treatment of cryptoasset mining by providing that where a person performs mining activities—either solo or as part of a mining pool in which the miners share rewards—that person would not be required to collect tax on the provision of their mining services and also would not be entitled to recover GST/HST paid on inputs to those mining services.\n\nThe measure also provides for an exception that applies where the mining services are being provided to an identifiable recipient that is not an operator of a \"sharing\" mining pool of the miner (i.e., where the miner is not sharing in rewards). In these situations, these new rules do not apply (i.e., the normal GST rules would apply).\n\nThe measure also ensures that non-resident persons performing mining activities in Canada do not have a GST/HST advantage over Canadian residents performing the same activities.\n\nThe measure comes into force on February 5, 2022.\n\nGST/HST Treatment of Payment Card Clearing Services\n\nPayment card clearing services (e.g., payment processing and messaging services in respect of credit, debit and charge cards) are provided by payment card network operators (such as Visa or Interac), to persons such as a payment card issuer (e.g., a bank). As these services are administrative in nature, it has always been a well-understood policy that the Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax (GST/HST) applies to these services; however, a recent court decision found that GST/HST does not apply.\n\nPayment card clearing services are not be to confused with payment card-related services supplied to merchants or consumers, such as merchant \"swipe fees\" (or \"interchange fees\") and credit card annual fees charged to card holders. These other services are \"financial services\" that would remain GST/HST-exempt.\n\nThis measure clarifies that payment card clearing services are subject to GST/HST.\n\nSpecifically, the measure clarifies that payment card clearing services rendered by a payment card network operator are excluded from the GST/HST definition of \"financial service\" (which are GST/HST-exempt services) to ensure that payment card clearing services generally continue to be subject to the GST/HST.\n\nThe measure generally applies to all to supplies of payment card clearing services made (1) after March 28, 2023, the date on which the measure was announced in the Budget; and (2) on or before that date, but only generally where these supplies had previously been treated as taxable.\n\nPension Rebate Limitation Period Fix\n\nUnder the GST/HST, a pension entity of a pension plan (the trust or corporation that holds assets of the pension plan) is entitled to claim a 33-per-cent rebate (\"the pension rebate\") in respect of GST/HST that is payable by the pension entity to a supplier or that a participating employer of the pension plan is deemed to have collected in respect of the pension plan.\n\nThe measure concerns an issue where a pension entity may be denied the pension rebate following an assessment by the Canada Revenue Agency of the participating employer or the supplier and the assessment is issued after the expiry of the two-year time limit for claiming the pension rebate. A similar issue arises with the claiming of an input tax credit by the pension entity in respect of the deemed GST/HST.\n\nThe measure addresses this issue by ensuring that a pension entity is not deprived of the pension rebate or an input tax credit in these cases by allowing a pension entity to claim the pension rebate or an input tax credit after the expiry of the normal two-year limitation period.\n\nThe measure generally applies prospectively to any claim period or reporting period of a pension entity ending after August 9, 2022. However, a transitional rule allows a pension entity to benefit from these amendments in respect of the deemed tax remitted by an employer prior to the August 9, 2022 announcement of draft legislation so long as the employer notifies the pension entity of the employer's assessment and net tax adjustment in respect of deemed tax within one year after the later of (i) the date of the assessment, (ii) the date the employer remitted the deemed tax in its net tax and (iii) the date these amendments receive Royal Assent.\n\nFreight Transportation of Money (GST/HST)\n\nUnder the Goods and Services Tax/Harmonized Sales Tax (GST/HST), international freight transportation services are generally zero-rated (i.e., relieved of tax).\n\nThis relief measure is based in part on the definition of a \"freight transportation service\", which currently reads as follows:\n\n\"freight transportation service\" means a particular service of transporting tangible personal property […]\n\nCanada Revenue Agency officials have determined that this definition does not encompass a service of transporting physical forms of money, such as bank notes or cheques. This is because money is not \"property\" under the GST/HST and thus is not \"tangible personal property.\" Therefore, a service of internationally transporting physical forms of money is not zero-rated under the current rules.\n\nThe exclusion of money from the freight transportation service rules reflects an inadvertent legislative gap, as there is no policy basis for applying the GST/HST to the international transportation of money (but not to other property).\n\nTherefore, an amendment is proposed to the GST/HST freight transportation services rules that would broaden the scope of those rules to include a service of transporting money in physical form. The estimated fiscal cost of the proposed amendment is around $600,000.\n\nThe amendment would apply prospectively to supplies of freight transportation services made after August 9, 2022 (the date of announcement). It would also apply retroactively to supplies made on or before that date if tax was not charged or paid in respect of the supply.\n\nPart 3 – Amendments to the Excise Tax Act, the Excise Act, 2001 and the Air Travellers Security Charge Act\n\nAlcohol Excise Duty [Excise Act and Excise Act, 2001 (Alcohol Products)]\n\nAlcohol excise duties are automatically indexed to total Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation on April 1 of each year.\n\nThe measure temporarily caps the inflation adjustment for excise duties on beer, spirits and wine at 2 per cent, for one year only, as of April 1, 2023.\n\nCanadian Air Transport Security Authority (Amendments to the Air Travelers Security Charge Act) [Air Travellers Security Charge Act (Charge Rates)]\n\nPart 3 amends the Air Travellers Security Charge Act to implement the rate change announced in Budget 2023.\n\nThe Air Travellers Security Charge (ATSC) is paid by passengers when purchasing airline tickets. The purpose of the ATSC is to fund the air travel security system.\n\nThis measure increases the ATSC rates by 32.85 per cent. This means, for example, that the charge on a return trip within Canada would increase from $14.96 to $19.87.\n\nThis measure would apply to air travel on or after May 1, 2024, for which any payment is made on or after that date.\n\nPart 4 - Various Measures\n\nA Fairer External Complaints Handling System for Banking (External Complaints Body)\n\nTo ensure Canadians have access to a fair and impartial process to address unresolved complaints with their banks, this measure proposes legislative amendments to strengthen the external complaints handling system for banks and put in place a single, non-profit, External Complaints Body (ECB). This measure, which was first announced in Budget 2022, fulfills a mandate letter and a platform commitment.\n\nDivision 1 of Part 4 amends the Bank Act to provide for the establishment of a single, non-profit ECB and to introduce new legislative amendments to strengthen the external complaints handling system for banks. In particular, the proposed legislation includes a set of new oversight and enforcement authorities for the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada (FCAC) Commissioner that will help improve the performance and accountability of the ECB system and increase consumer trust in it. This measure will come into force upon Royal Assent. The FCAC will undertake a selection process to recommend a body corporate for the Minister of Finance's designation after which there will be a sole ECB following a transition period.\n\nStrengthening the Federal Pension Framework (Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985)\n\nDivision 2 of Part 4 amends the Pension Benefits Standards Act, 1985 (PBSA) and the Pooled Registered Pension Plans Act (PRPPA) to allow federally regulated pension plans and pooled registered pension plans to establish and offer a variable payment life annuity (VPLA) to plan members at retirement and to make technical housekeeping amendments.\n\nVPLAs are new retirement income vehicles that offer members of defined contribution pension plans and pooled registered pension plans the option of a lifetime stream of retirement income, the payments of which would be adjusted periodically, based on investment returns and changes in life expectancies of participants.\n\nVPLAs are intended to enhance the retirement security of Canadians by reducing the risk of outliving retirement savings.\n\nCombatting Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (Measures Related to Money Laundering and to Digital Assets and Other Measures)\n\nThe Government of Canada is committed to providing a strong Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Terrorist Financing (AML/ATF) Regime that protects Canadians and the financial system.\n\nBudget 2023 proposes legislative amendments to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA) and the Criminal Code to strengthen Canada's ability to combat financial crimes and emerging risks, including those stemming from foreign interference and other national security threats. The proposed measures would fulfil a commitment from Budget 2022 to strengthen AML/ATF investigations, prosecutions, and information sharing tools.\n\nImprove Investigation, Enforcement, and Information Sharing Tools\n\nBudget 2023 announces the government's intention to introduce legislative amendments to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA) and the Criminal Code to strengthen the investigative, enforcement, and information sharing tools of Canada's AML/ATF Regime.\n\nUnless noted otherwise, these provisions would come into force upon Royal Assent.\n\nThe PCMLTFA amendments would:\n\nImprove financial intelligence information sharing between law enforcement and the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC).\n\nIntroduce a new offence for structuring transactions to avoid FINTRAC reporting.\n\nStrengthen the registration framework for money service businesses to prevent their abuse. This measure would come into force on a day to be fixed by order of the Governor in Council.\n\nCriminalize the operation of unregistered money services businesses. This measure would come into force one year from Royal Assent to give businesses time to become familiar with the change.\n\nEstablish powers for FINTRAC to disseminate strategic analysis related to the financing of threats to the safety of Canada.\n\nProvide whistleblowing protections for employees who report information to FINTRAC.\n\nBroaden the use of non-compliance reports by FINTRAC in criminal investigations, allowing law enforcement and prosecutors to use these reports in a wider array of criminal investigations and prosecutions, such as money laundering.\n\nExpand the designated information that FINTRAC is allowed to disclose to law enforcement when it has reasonable grounds to believe that the information would be relevant to investigating or prosecuting a money laundering or terrorist financing offences.\n\nSet up obligations for the financial sector to report information on sanctioned assets to FINTRAC. This measure would come into force on a day to be fixed by order of the Governor in Council.\n\nThe Criminal Code amendments would:\n\nGive law enforcement the ability to seize digital assets that may be confiscated as proceeds of crime. As a result of this Criminal Code reform, related amendments would also be made to the Parliament of Canada Act, the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act, and the Seized Property Management Act.\n\nEnhance the ability of Attorneys General to obtain, through judicial authorization, disclosure of tax information from the Minister of National Revenue for the purposes of investigating offences that give rise to proceeds of crime, by expanding the number of offences for which this measure would be available.\n\nThe Criminal Code measures and its related amendments would come into force ninety days after Royal Assent.\n\nModernizing Financial Sector Oversight to Address Emerging Risks (Protect National Security and Prevent Foreign Interference)\n\nBudget 2023 also announces the government's intention to amend the financial institutions statutes (Bank Act, the Insurance Companies Act, the Trust and Loan Companies Act, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Act), and the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act to modernize the federal financial framework to address emerging risks.\n\nUnless noted otherwise, these provisions would come into force upon Royal Assent.\n\nAs it relates to the PCMLTFA, the legislative changes propose to:\n\nProvide new powers to allow the Minister of Finance to impose enhanced due diligence requirements to protect Canada's financial system from the financing of national security threats.\n\nAllow the Director of FINTRAC to share intelligence analysis with the Minister of Finance to help assess national security or financial integrity risks posed by financial entities. This measure would come into force on a day to be fixed by order of the Governor in Council.\n\nImprove the sharing of compliance information between FINTRAC, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) and the Minister of Finance.\n\nDesignate OSFI as a recipient of FINTRAC disclosures pertaining to threats to the security of Canada, where relevant to OSFI's responsibilities.\n\nTechnical Amendments (FINTRAC Funding)\n\nBudget 2023 proposes a technical amendment to the Budget Implementation Act, 2021, No. 1 to clarify that FINTRAC should not ascertain and assess its compliance program costs against the persons and entities they regulate until regulations specifying the assessment fees are published and brought into force. This amendment will allow for the launch of the assessments scheme for 2024-25.\n\nPart 4 – Division 10 - Economic Sanctions (Special Economic Measures Act)\n\nConsequential Amendment\n\nThis targeted amendment to the PCMLTFA is intended to support Global Affairs Canada's (GAC) efforts to make, administer or enforce orders or regulations under the Special Economic Measures Act and the Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act.\n\nFINTRAC would be authorized to disclose information to GAC when FINTRAC has reasonable grounds to suspect there is money laundering/terrorist financing.\n\nSupporting the Economic Growth of Developing Countries (Preferential Tariff for Developing Countries)\n\nThis measure renews Canada's non-reciprocal tariff programs for goods imported from developing countries. Specifically, this measure amends the Customs Tariff to: (1) renew the General Preferential Tariff (GPT) and the Least Developed Country Tariff (LDCT) programs from January 1, 2025 to December 31, 2034; (2) establish a new General Preferential Tariff Plus (GPTP) tariff program over the same period; and (3) simplify the direct shipment requirements under all of Canada's programs.\n\nThe new GPTP program builds on Canada's inclusive trade agenda and will incentivize countries to adhere to international standards on human rights, labour conditions, gender equality, and climate change.\n\nThe GPT and LDCT will be renewed, and the GPTP established, when this Act comes into force. The regulations on direct shipment requirements will come into force on a day to be fixed by order of the Governor in Council.\n\nIndefinite Withdrawal of Most-Favoured-Nation Status from Russia and Belarus [Removal of Most-Favoured-Nation Tariff Treatment for Belarus and Russia]\n\nThis measure amends the Customs Tariff to indefinitely extend the withdrawal of Most-Favoured-Nation (MFN) preferential tariff treatment for Russian and Belarusian imports. This measure achieves the policy objective of providing a clear market-based signal to incentivize importers to source away from imports from Russia and Belarus. The permanent withdrawal reflects the enduring nature of the conflict and aligns with similar trade and tariff measures adopted by Canada's allies.\n\nThis measure comes into force upon the expiry of the Most-Favoured-Nation Tariff Withdrawal Order (2022-2).\n\nBank of Canada Negative Equity (Non-Application of Sections 27 and 27.1 of the Bank of Canada Act)\n\nDivision 6 of Part 4 allows the Bank of Canada (Bank) to temporarily withhold remittances until negative equity associated with the Government of Canada Bond Purchase Program (GBPP) has been restored.\n\nIn response to financial market stress arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank introduced in March 2020 the GBPP, Canada's first QE program. Under the GBPP, the Bank purchased Government of Canada bonds in the secondary market and created settlement balances to pay for the purchases.\n\nAs interest rates rise, the variable interest (based on the policy rate) the Bank pays on the settlement balances it created to purchase government securities under GBPP has exceeded the fixed interest it receives on the bonds it purchased, so the Bank is now incurring net interest losses.\n\nS. 27 of the Bank of Canada Act requires the Bank to remit any surplus or profits it generates in a particular year. Division 6 of Part 4 overrides section 27 of the Bank of Canada Act, effectively allowing the Bank to retain future profits until such time as it the Bank's GBPP losses are covered, which would facilitate it to exit negative equity.\n\nThe proposed solution is similar to the one taken in Australia, where the Reserve Bank of Australia will be withholding future remittances to offset negative equity due to losses from quantitative easing. In the US, the Federal Reserve also uses future income and remittances to cover losses from quantitative easing.\n\nLegislation to Establish the Canada Innovation Corporation (Canada Innovation Corporation Act)\n\nAnnounced in Budget 2022, and reaffirmed in the 2022 Fall Economic Statement and the CIC Blueprint, the Canada Innovation Corporation's (CIC) mandate is to help solve the problem of low business investment in research and development (R&D) in Canada. Improved business investment in R&D in Canada is needed to foster economic growth, create good jobs in Canada and support Canada's transition to a net-zero economy. Guided by international best practice, the CIC will be established as a Crown corporation with a mandate to maximize Canadian businesses investment in R&D across all economic sectors and regions of Canada to promote innovation-based economic growth, including working with businesses to promote the creation and retention of intangible assets in Canada.\n\nThe CIC will be governed by a Board of Directors, and run by a Chief Executive Officer. The day-to-day operations of the CIC will be operationally independent from government, with clear accountability to Parliament through the Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry. The CIC will be a Crown corporation and serve three core functions: foresight and experimentation; provision of advisory services; and, delivery of funding support programming. The National Research Council's Industrial Research Assistance Program (IRAP) will join the CIC over time to build a national-scale platform to support business R&D for firms of all sizes. IRAP will provide a strong foundation upon which the CIC will be able to build a continuum of support, service, and strategy across all sectors and industries in the Canadian economy.\n\nThe legislation will come into force on a date to be determined by the Governor in Council. The transfer of IRAP to the CIC will occur on a separate date to be determined by the Governor in Council.\n\nCanada Health Transfer [Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act (Canada Health Transfer)]\n\nThe legislation proposes to amend the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act to authorize a $2 billion payment to the provinces and territories through the Canada Health Transfer, allocated on an equal per capita basis, to address immediate pressures on the health care system, especially in pediatric hospitals, emergency rooms and surgical and diagnostic backlogs. This authority is for cash transfers out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund.\n\nThis funding builds on $6.5 billion in previous one-time top-ups ($500 million in 2019-20, $4 billion in 2020-21 and $2 billion in 2021-22) to the Canada Health Transfer that the Government of Canada has provided to help address the extreme pressures that COVID-19 has put on provincial-territorial health systems, including backlogs of medical procedures.\n\nEqualization and Territorial Formula Financing (TFF) Renewal (Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act (Equalization and Territorial Financing Renewal and Other Amendments)\n\nThe legislation governing Equalization and Territorial Formula Financing is reviewed on a periodic basis to ensure the programs are meeting their objectives and using the most up-to-date and accurate measures in the determination of provincial and territorial entitlements. The Minister of Finance's authority to make new Equalization and Territorial Formula Financing payments is set to expire on March 31, 2024.\n\nFollowing consultations with provincial and territorial governments, Budget 2023 proposes to renew these two programs for another five-year period beginning April 1, 2024, along with technical changes to improve the accuracy and transparency of the programs.\n\nDivision 9 of Part 4 amends the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act to renew Equalization and Territorial Formula Financing for a five-year period beginning April 1, 2024.\n\nMost of the technical changes will be brought forward through the standard regulatory process. This enactment makes one technical change in respect of renewal by amending the Federal-Provincial Fiscal Arrangements Act to include miscellaneous revenues in revenues to be equalized for all relevant non-resource revenue sources (personal income taxes, business income taxes, consumption taxes and property taxes), rather than including them only with property taxes. In addition, this enactment makes a technical change to the calculation of fiscal stabilization payments.\n\nChanges to Canada's Sanctions Regime (Economic Sanctions - Special Econimic Measures Act)\n\nCanada applies autonomous sanctions against individuals and entities under the Special Economic Measures Act (SEMA), and the Justice for Victims of Corrupt Foreign Officials Act (JVCFOA).\n\nIn response to Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Canada implemented legislative changes to both SEMA and JVCFOA to authorize the Minister of Foreign Affairs to seek forfeiture of seized assets. The forfeited funds can be used in support of reconstruction of a foreign State, to restore international peace and security, and/or as compensation to victims. These amendments received Royal Assent in June 2022.\n\nOver the past year, Canada has expanded its use of sanctions to respond to the situation in Ukraine, but also to impose sanctions against targeted individuals and entities in Haiti, Iran, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar.\n\nEffective implementation of sanctions is a priority for Canada and its allies. An increase in sanctions evasion tactics has been observed over the past year. For example, in March 2023 members of the Russian Elites, Proxies, and Oligarchs (REPO) Task Force (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the European Commission) jointly issued a global advisory on Russian sanctions evasion, which includes information on tactics used to evade sanctions.\n\nAs a result of both the growing use of sanctions and the necessity to bolster their effectiveness and to counteract sanctions evasion techniques, further amendments to SEMA and JVCFOA are being put forward to clarify certain provisions, make processes more efficient, increase information sharing, and to tighten Canada's sanctions regime.\n\nThe first proposed group of amendments, in sections 2 of both SEMA and JVCFOA, aim to clarify the scope of certain sanctions measures, particularly in circumstances where a designated person owns or controls non-designated entities. The amendments clarify that, for the purposes of Canada's autonomous sanctions regimes, any property will be considered to be owned by a designated person if that property is owned or controlled by any entity, whether designated or non-designated, that is itself controlled, directly or indirectly, by a designated person.\n\nThese amendments also set out certain criteria according to which a person will be considered to control an entity, including where they own at least 50% of the company, or are able to change the composition or powers of the entity's board of directors or to direct the entity's activities.\n\nThe second proposed amendment clarifies that the scope of the Governor in Council's (GIC) authority to seize property does not extend to non-designated persons. Paragraph 4(1)(b) of SEMA and JVCFOA are modified to specify that property can be seized only where it is owned, held or controlled, directly or indirectly, by a person listed in an order or regulation made under paragraph 4(1)(a) of SEMA. For example, the GIC would only be able to seize property of a Russian person if that person was listed under the Special Economic Measures (Russia) Regulations.\n\nParagraph 4(1)(b) will be amended to "
