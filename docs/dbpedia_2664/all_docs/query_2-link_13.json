        "text": "Joan Marie Aylward, a former nurses' union president and a former Liberal cabinet minister in Newfoundland and Labrador, was named Thursday as the province's next lieutenant-governor.\n\n\"Joan Marie Aylward has spent her career caring for and serving her community and Canadians,\" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement Thursday morning.\n\n\"I am confident that she will continue to serve the people of Newfoundland and Labrador in her new role with characteristic selflessness, dedication and enthusiasm.\"\n\nAylward will be sworn in Nov. 14 at the House of Assembly.\n\nAylward will replace Judy Foote, who was the first woman to hold the post in N.L. Foote was sworn in as lieutenant-governor in May 2018.\n\nThe appointment is for a minimum of five years.\n\nAylward was first elected in 1996 and served as minister of finance and president of the Treasury Board, minister of human resources and employment, and minister of health and community services.\n\nAylward, a Memorial University graduate, recently concluded her term as vice-chair of Newfoundland and Labrador Labour Relations Board and was also the executive director of St. Patrick's Mercy Home.\n\nIn 2018 she was appointed to the National Seniors Council and chaired the aging population committee for the N.L. Health Accord, a provincial review of the health-care delivery.\n\nShe has also sat on various boards and committees, including Oxfam Canada and the Foundation for Conservation of Atlantic Salmon.\n\nIn 2002 Aylward received the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal.\n\nNDP, PCs skeptical about transparency\n\nNewfoundland and Labrador Premier Andrew Furey congratulated Aylward on her appointment in a statement on Thursday.\n\n\"I have known Ms. Aylward for many years, and can attest to her advocacy and compassion for Newfoundland and Labrador. She is a wonderful selection by the prime minister,\" the statement said. \"Her spirit will position her well as lieutenant governor.\"\n\nOpposition parties say they would have liked to see more transparency as part of the process to find a new lieutenant-governor.\n\nNDP MHA Jordan Brown told CBC News he believes the lieutenant-governor should be a non-partisan role, pointing to Aylward's political past.\n\n\"We got another Liberal, former cabinet minister, back-to-back appointed to a role that in reality should be a non-partisan role,\" Brown said. \"It's concerning, the blatant partisanship right now that we're seeing.\"\n\nBrown said he would have liked to see the position go in a different direction, citing that Newfoundland and Labrador has never had a lieutenant-governor of Indigenous descent.\n\nPC Leader David Brazil said he enjoyed working with Foote and is looking forward to conversations with her, but said he would have liked to see more transparency in the appointment.\n\n\"Nobody knows what process is used when they select a new lieutenant-governor. You know, there's a lot of political patronage that goes into the concept here, and maybe it's time that we have a look at a new fairer, open and transparent process,\" Brazil said."
