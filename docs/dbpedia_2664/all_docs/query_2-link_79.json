        "text": "In January 2021, I published an article titled “Breaking Down Family Connections In Canadian Journalism.” The guide, updated with new entries twice after publication, now includes more than 55 families and 160 journalists. After publishing this article, a few people reached out asking me to look into family connections between working journalists and politicians. I thought it was a good idea, but became caught up in other work and never got around to putting it together.\n\nA few weeks ago, a mini journalism scandal broke out. The host of TVO’s “The Agenda,” Steve Paikin, wrote an article about Mayor of Brampton Patrick Brown. Paikin failed to disclose some connections between his wife and Brown. A few journalists spoke out, TVO eventually attached a disclaimer to the article and then Paikin wrote a piece in response, where he laid out even more of his family and personal connections with active political figures. More outrage ensued.\n\nThe incident made it clear to me that there’s a public appetite for knowing if journalists are related to politicians/political staffers, or have some sort of personal connection with them (something I have long thought to be a matter of public interest). Even some of the people that loudly criticized my past article joined in on critiquing Paikin.\n\nWith that in mind, now seems like a good time to publish this article, documenting connections between working journalists and politicians/political staff. Here is my reasoning for doing so:\n\nThere is widespread agreement that having a family connection with a politician could impede a journalist’s ability to write fairly on them or their party\n\nThere is widespread agreement that journalists should either avoid writing about politicians they have a family connection with or at least disclose that connection in their work for the sake of transparency\n\nWe know this disclosure doesn’t always happen, and sometimes it takes someone else bringing up these connections for them to be made public\n\nIn order for this to happen, these connections need to be known to someone other than the family in question\n\nWhile other journalists may be aware of these connections, they often don’t bring them up, for a variety of (sometimes understandable, but not justifiable) reasons\n\nAs such, the public should be made aware of these connections.\n\nHere is a great example of what I mean. Queen’s Park reporters had known for years that Toronto Sun columnist Brian Lilley had been living with Ivana Yelich, Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s director of media relations. And yet, it took Simone Racanelli (not a journalist) tweeting this on March 26, 2021, to kick start the process of bringing the connection to light: “Enough is enough. Ivana is dating Brian Lilley. Why the hell do we continue to pretend that she’s able to perform her duties as director of media relations to the level of professionalism that Ontarians deserve? She has a clear conflict of interest.”\n\nCanadaland published an article about the connection later that day by editor Jonathan Goldsbie, who admitted Racanelli’s tweet “pushed [him] to finally finish reporting this.” The story broke widely from there. (It had also been reported by Frank magazine behind a paywall, in 2019, but the story didn’t gain much traction then.)\n\nMy article is not written to imply that any of the journalists below have reported on family members or their political party without disclosing said connection, or tried to hide it. As you’ll see, I’ve relied entirely on public sources to point out these connections. The purpose of the article is just to bring these already-public connections together in one convenient spot, much like my journalism families article did.\n\nI’ve put together a list of all the connections that I’m aware of, though I strongly suspect there are many more. With my last article, I added the majority of names post-publication, after receiving a bunch of tips. It’s possible that will happen with this one as well.\n\nIn order to make the list, a family needs to include at least one working journalist, and at least one politician or political staffer of some sort (they don’t need to currently be in that position, though many are). An asterisk next to a family name means that family also appeared in my article breaking down family connections in Canadian journalism. Unlike that article, I have decided to count marriages as a family connection for the purpose of this one.\n\nPlease email submissions@readpassage.com if you know of any connections not listed here.\n\nHere they are, listed under the family name of the working journalist, in alphabetical order…\n\nAusten | Balkissoon | Bonokoski | Coyne | Freeland | Frum | Germain | Kelley | Klein | Paikin | Radwanski | Reguly | Van Dusen | Wells | Yakabuski\n\nAusten Family\n\nIndividuals: Ian Austen, Adam Austen\n\nIan Austen is the Canada correspondent at the New York Times.

He served in these positions under Chrystia Freeland and François-Philippe Champagne. He now works as the communications manager at Mitacs, which describes itself as “an integral part of Canada’s innovation ecosystem.”\n\nIn May 2019, Norman Spector, a former journalist, diplomat and civil servant, tweeted about a New York Times article by Ian, writing, “For the most part, this is a fair piece. But IMO the @nytimes should have noted that its reporter is the son of @cafreeland’s spokesperson.” The article was titled, “A Battered but Unbowed Justin Trudeau Vows to Stay the Course in Canada.” Ian replied, writing, “I assume you intended to write that my son is her spokesman. After he took that job, I stopped writing about her and any story primarily involving her department.”\n\nBalkissoon Family\n\nIndividuals: Denise Balkissoon, Bas Balkissoon, Laura Jarrett, Valerie Jarrett\n\nDenise Balkissoon is the Ontario bureau chief at the Narwhal.

The Toronto Star published an article about their wedding, titled “Obama attends wedding of Toronto Liberal MPP’s son.” The article notes that Laura is “the daughter of Valerie Jarrett, one of Obama’s most influential advisers and a long-time friend of president who heads the White House office of public engagement.”\n\nThe article states that wedding guests included then President of the United States, Barack Obama, as well as “Obama’s Attorney General Eric Holder, who arrived in a four-SUV motorcade and Vernon Jordan, a key adviser to former president Bill Clinton, among other Democratic luminaries.” It adds, “While Bas Balkissoon was understandably coy about the event, another Liberal confided that the MPP was seen in deep conversation with both Obama and Holder.”\n\nOn Jan. 21, 2013, Denise tweeted, “The internet has thwarted me all weekend but at least I had good seats for the inauguration,” along with a photo of the event marking Obama’s electoral victory. Jonathan Goldsbie, now editor at Canadaland, replied, asking, “Okay, so what is the story here? How did you manage this?” Denise responded, “My brother married a lovely girl whose mom happens to be a mad high roller…v disappointed you missed last June’s Star story, JG.”\n\nBonokoski Family\n\nIndividuals: Mark Bonokoski, Erin Bonokoski Paulusse\n\nMark Bonokoski is a Postmedia columnist, appearing in Sun Media publications.

Journalist Bob Wakeham wrote about this connection at the time, claiming that “it’s impossible to imagine [Anthony Germain] being allowed anywhere near a Newfoundland political story, given the conflict of interest in place the minute his wife accepted her new job. It would be a no-brainer if this had happened in my day at the ‘Here and Now’ helm. Germain would be relegated to coverage of the Regatta.”\n\nDoris left the position in January.\n\nKelley Family\n\nIndividuals: Mark Kelley, Geoff Kelley, Greg Kelley\n\nMark Kelley is a journalist that has worked with the CBC for decades, in a variety of roles.

A posting on the University of Toronto website announcing that she is the recipient of an honorary degree from the school notes that, “Her first job after graduation was as a reporter at the Globe and Mail, where she kept her birth name after her 1963 marriage to Stephen Lewis, because the editors did not want it known that one of their reporters was married to a socialist politician.”\n\nAvi’s father, Stephen Lewis, served as an NDP MPP in Ontario, in the Scarborough West riding, from 1963 to 1978.
