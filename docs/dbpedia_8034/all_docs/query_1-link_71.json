        "text": "State-owned Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited, also known as BPCL, is one of the largest downstream oil companies in India. BPCL is a public-sector undertaking (PSU) owned and operated by the Petroleum and Natural Gas Ministry, Government of India. The firm is headquartered in Mumbai, Maharashtra. BPCL is a Fortune 500 oil exploration, refining and marketing giant. The company is nearly a century old. It began its journey in 1928 when Asiatic Petroleum (India) partnered with Burmah Oil Company which at that time was a prominent player in petroleum sector. The partnership led to the formation of Burmah-Shell Oil Storage and Distributing Company of India Limited which would later be known as BPCL. Initially, the company focused on importing and marketing kerosene. In the 1950, the firm took a bold step and introduced LPG as an alternative cooking fuel in India. 1952 was the year when the firm was incorporated as Burmah-Shell Refineries Limited (BSR). The company set up its first refinery in 1955 at Mahul, Chembur in Mumbai. A major change took place in 1976 when the Indian government took control of the company. 1977 was a significant year for the firm when it rebranded and changed its name to Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) and adopted a new logo, which is still in use. BPCL also became the first refinery to process the crude oil being extracted from the newly discovered oil field in the Arabian Sea called the Mumbai High. BPCL issued its Initial Public Offer (IPO) in 2002. The Indian government attempted to privatise BPCL. However, the Supreme Court blocked the government from doing so and the government could only offload a part of its stake. In 2016, the government passed a law allowing it to privatise companies it had nationalised in the 1970s. The following year, BPCL was awarded the Maharatna status by the government as it was one of the most successful PSUs. 2019 was the year when the Indian government gave its nod to the privatisation of BPCL. 2021 was the year when BPCL revealed plans to invest heavily in its non-fuel business for further growth.\n\nProducts and services\n\nExploration, production and marketing of petroleum and its products is the core business of BPCL. Petrol, Diesel, Automotive LPG and CNG are some of the products marketed by BPCL. The company operates thousands of fuel stations across the country. BPCL supplies LPG under the Bharatgas brand. At the heart of the company lie three refineries located in Mumbai, Kochi and Bina. BPCL also produces lubricants such as engine oil under the MAK Lubricants brand. The company also produces jet fuel for the aviation industry. The company caters to the fuel requirement of businesses across sectors such as defence and railways. BPCL is also in the business of proficiency testing, a first of its kind for the petroleum industry.\n\nListing\n\nShares of BPCL are listed on BSE, NSE, Madras Stock Exchange, Calcutta Stock Exchange, etc. The company is a part of multiple indices like Nifty 50, Nifty 500, S&P BSE Sensex 50 etc."
