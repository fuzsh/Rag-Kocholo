        "text": "My name is Jenifer Pais, and I am from Karkala, near the Minor Basilica of St. Lawrence, Attur. I am blessed with three wonderful children, and I would like to share a miraculous experience that strengthened my faith in Infant Jesus.\n\nWhen my second child, Dion, was just one and a half years old, we had a close brush with what could have been a tragic accident. One day, as I was reversing the car, Dion somehow slipped and fell under the vehicle. My heart raced as I realized the danger, but in that critical moment, I instinctively applied the brake. Miraculously, the car stopped just in time. If not for that split-second decision, the tire would have gone over my precious little one. Yet, by the grace of Infant Jesus, Dion was saved without even a single scratch.\n\nThis experience was nothing short of a miracle. I am eternally grateful to Infant Jesus for His protection over my child that day. Praise be to Infant Jesus for this incredible act of love and mercy.\n\nWilfred and Jenifer Pais\n\nAttur-Karkala\n\nAug 10, 2024\n\nWe are Neelan Gratian and Celestine D'Souza from Pudu-Farangipete, and we wish to share the beautiful ways in which Infant Jesus has blessed our family.\n\nYears ago, we fervently prayed to Infant Jesus, asking for the gift of a child. Our prayers were answered when we were blessed with our first son, Prinston Anto D'Souza, who is now 9 years old. His birth was a joyous occasion, and we were thankful that he came into this world through a normal delivery, healthy and strong.\n\nA few years later, we were blessed again with our second son, Joyson D'Souza. However, this time, the pregnancy was not without its challenges. There were complications that caused us great concern, and we were unsure of what the outcome would be. We turned to Infant Jesus once more, placing our fears and hopes in His hands.\n\nThrough the grace of Infant Jesus, despite the difficulties, Joyson was born safely via a C-section. We are overjoyed to have both our sons with us, healthy, and we know it is all thanks to the protection and blessings of Infant Jesus.\n\nNeelan Gratian and Celestine D'Souza\n\nPudu-Bantwal\n\nAug 15, 2024\n\nMy name is Jasmine Sandhya Pais, and I am writing to share the wonderful blessings that my husband, Rithesh Menezes, and I have received through the grace of Infant Jesus.\n\nBefore I could pursue my dream of working in Dubai, I needed to pass the DHA (Dubai Health Authority) exam, which is known to be quite challenging. My husband and I visited the shrine of Infant Jesus at Bikarnakatte, where we earnestly prayed for His guidance and blessings.\n\nWith faith in my heart and the blessings of Infant Jesus, I appeared for the exam. To my great joy and relief, I passed the DHA exam on my very first attempt! This success paved the way for me to secure a good job in Dubai, fulfilling a long-cherished dream.\n\nWe are deeply grateful to Infant Jesus for hearing our prayers and guiding us through this journey. His divine intervention made what seemed difficult, possible, and we are forever thankful.\n\nJasmine Sandhya Pais and Rithesh Menezes\n\nVittla - Dakshina Kannada\n\nAug 14, 2024\n\nMy name is Shalet, and I would like to share the wonderful ways the Lord has blessed my family. My husband Titus Monteiro has been working in Saudi Arabia for the past 20 years. Despite his hard work and dedication, he was not receiving a proper salary for many years. This situation caused us a great deal of stress and anxiety as we struggled to make ends meet.\n\nIn our distress, we turned to Infant Jesus and prayed fervently, asking for His divine intervention.\n\nTo our great joy and amazement, our prayers were answered! My husband finally received his due salary, and we felt a tremendous weight lifted off our shoulders.\n\nMoreover, after 12 long years of marriage, during which we waited and prayed for a child, we were blessed with a beautiful baby Ancita Thaniya Monteiro who is now in 4th Std. This precious gift has filled our hearts with immense joy and gratitude.\n\nWe are eternally grateful to Infant Jesus. He has answered our prayers in the most miraculous ways, and we are living proof of His love and compassion.\n\nShalet D'Souza, Titus Monteiro and Ancita Thaniya Monteiro\n\nHoige Bazar, Mangalore\n\nAug 15, 2024\n\nI am Sushma Jyoline, and I want to share my testimony of the miraculous healing I experienced, all thanks to the grace of Infant Jesus.\n\nSix months ago, I was involved in a severe accident that left my right elbow completely damaged. The doctors had little hope for a quick recovery. They suggested that I would need multiple surgeries, including bone, tissue, and plastic surgeries, to regain even partial use of my arm. The outlook was daunting, and I was filled with fear and uncertainty.\n\nHowever, in the midst of this dark time, I placed my faith in Infant Jesus and prayed fervently for His divine intervention. I asked for strength, courage, and above all, healing.\n\nMiraculously, within just two months, I began to notice a remarkable improvement. My elbow, which the doctors had predicted would take much longer to heal, was recovering at a pace that baffled them. I was able to resume my daily activities, and the pain that once seemed unbearable gradually faded away.\n\nToday, six months after the accident, I stand before you completely healed. My elbow is perfectly alright, and I have regained full use of my arm. The surgeries that were once deemed necessary are no longer needed.\n\nI am here today to offer my heartfelt thanksgiving to Infant Jesus for this incredible miracle. I know without a doubt that it was His grace that healed me. I am eternally grateful for His love, mercy, and the second chance He has given me.\n\nThank you, Infant Jesus, for this wonderful gift of healing.\n\nSushma Joyline Cornelio, Allipade-Bantwal\n\nAugust 11, 2024\n\nSebastian Rodrigues found himself in a difficult situation when he lost his passport. The document was crucial for his travel plans, and its absence caused significant stress and anxiety. In his time of need, Sebastian turned to Infant Jesus, seeking divine intervention to help him find his lost passport.\n\nWith a heart full of faith, he prayed fervently, asking Infant Jesus for assistance in locating the important document. Miraculously, Sebastian's prayers were answered, and he was able to recover his lost passport.\n\nTo express his appreciation, Sebastian visited the Infant Jesus shrine. He offered his prayers and thanksgiving, acknowledging the divine help he received in his time of need.\n\nSebastian and Sonia Rodrigues\n\nLeena Rodrigues (Mom), Vamanjoor-Mangaluru\n\nAugust 5, 2024\n\nDuring Wilma's first pregnancy, she and her husband Alwyn D'Souza were filled with a mix of excitement and apprehension. To seek divine protection and blessings for a safe delivery, they made a vow to Infant Jesus. They prayed fervently, placing their trust in Him to guide them through this important phase of their lives.\n\nThe months passed, and their faith remained strong. Wilma gave birth to Vihan Preeth who is now two years old. Grateful for the blessings they received, Wilma and Alwyn visited the Infant Jesus shrine. With hearts full of thanksgiving, they offered their prayers, thanking Him for His guidance and protection during such a crucial time in their lives. This visit marked a significant moment of faith and gratitude for the D'Souza family.\n\nWilma Priyanaka and Alwyn D'Souza with Vihan Preet D'Souza\n\nEnmadi - Uppinangady\n\nAug 4, 2024\n\nSunitha and her husband Anil had their first child five years into their marriage. Tragically, the baby, born with a deformity, passed away within five days. Despite this heartbreaking loss, they did not lose faith. After three years, they were blessed with another child, whom they named Naomi.\n\nAs Naomi's parents celebrated her birthday, they expressed their gratitude by offering a thanksgiving to Infant Jesus, sharing their testimony of hope and faith. Their story is a testament to enduring faith and the joy that followed their period of grief.\n\n- Anil and Sunitha Pinto\n\nNaomi Pinto, Neerude-Mangaluru\n\nI am writing this testimony to share the miraculous intervention of Infant Jesus in our lives. My husband had been working for a company for several years and there was some amount due for him. Despite repeated requests and follow-ups, the company was delaying the payment, causing us immense financial strain and anxiety.\n\nIn our time of need, we turned to the Infant Jesus Shrine in Mangalore. We had always heard of the miraculous deeds and blessings bestowed upon devotees by Infant Jesus, and we decided to place our trust and faith in Him. We started praying fervently, and seeking the intercession of Infant Jesus.\n\nWithin 5 months of our praying, we got a call from the compnay and got the entire amount that was due to him. We were overwhelmed with gratitude and joy. We firmly believe that it was the divine intervention of Infant Jesus that made this possible. We are eternally grateful to Infant Jesus for answering our prayers and helping us in our time of need. Praise be to Infant Jesus!\n\n- Antonya Vincent, Derebail\n\nJuly 29, 2024\n\nWe, Prasad and Anusha, are overjoyed to share our testimony of the blessings we have received from Infant Jesus.\n\nA few years ago, we were struggling with numerous obstacles in our relationship. We faced significant challenges that made us doubt whether we could ever unite in marriage. During this difficult time, we sought the divine intervention of Infant Jesus, fervently praying for His guidance and blessings.\n\nTo our great joy and relief, our prayers were answered. By the grace of Infant Jesus, we overcame all the hurdles, and our families blessed our union. Our happiness was further multiplied when we were blessed with a beautiful baby girl, Ashni. We had always dreamed of starting a family, and this precious gift from Infant Jesus brought us unparalleled joy. Ashni has been a source of light and love in our lives.\n\nAs a family, we regularly visit the Infant Jesus Shrine in Mangalore, offering our prayers and thanksgiving. We are deeply grateful for the unwavering support and love we have received for His divine hand. All glory and praise to Infant Jesus.\n\nPrasad D.L.and Anusha, Ashni\n\nNidpalli - Puttur\n\nJuly 25, 2024\n\nI am Pamela, express my gratitude and devotion to Infant Jesus. Today, on the occasion of my birthday, I am offering a dress to the Infant Jesus Statue as a token of thanksgiving for the countless blessings and graces I have received over the past year.\n\nInfant Jesus has always been a source of strength, comfort, and hope in my life. Whenever I faced challenges or needed guidance, I turned to Him in prayer, and He never failed to support me. His presence has brought peace and joy to my heart, and I have experienced numerous miracles through His intercession.\n\nThank you, Infant Jesus, for being my protector and guide.\n\n- Pamela Cordeiro, Lalbhag-Mangalore\n\nJuly 25, 2024"
