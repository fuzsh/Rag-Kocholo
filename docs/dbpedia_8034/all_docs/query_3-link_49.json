        "text": "Tirumalsetti Suman started as an opening batsman from Hyderabad and came up through the age groups and into his state's Ranji team. An aggressive batsman, Suman started playing at junior level consistently from the age of 13. After captaining Hyderabad Under-16s, he came into the Ranji probables in 2001 and, in the same year, made himself noticed with good scores against England U-19s and a run of aggressive centuries. Suman made his first-class debut in the 2003-04 season and has been in and out of the Hyderabad first-class team, while also playing one domestic season for Andhra. Given his first opportunity in IPL 2009 in South Africa, Suman was consistent if not spectacular, helping Deccan Chargers with cameos in the middle order and breaking partnerships with his tidy offspin.\n\nHe fared much better in IPL 2010 with 307 runs, but could not perform as well in subsequent domestic seasons. He was signed by Mumbai Indians for the 2011 and 2012 editions of the IPL, playing only 10 matches in the two seasons, before he switched to Pune Warriors for IPL 2013. He played only seven matches for Pune in 2013. He was not picked by any franchise for the 2014 and 2015 editions of the IPL before Sunrisers Hyderabad bought him in the 2016 auction at a base price of INR 10 lakh."
