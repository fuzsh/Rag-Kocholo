        "text": "‚Äú‡§á‡•õ‡§π‡§æ‡§∞ (izhaar)‚Äù, is a word in Urdu, sort of stands for ‚Äòexpression‚Äô. Like, to express oneself - to declare something to someone. My exposure to hindi/urdu has been largely through Indian cinema - where words such as ‚Äòizhaar‚Äô are oft used in lyrics of songs about love and care (and let us say such music is a-plenty in Indian movie sound tracks ! ). You may know people who talk a lot. Next time that happens, pause and listen: - are they talking passionately about a topic? - are they generally talking, but making scant sense? - or are they really expressing a part of their inner self to you - perhaps camouflaged in a barrage of words? Learn to really listen - care enough to pick up the cues. ‚ÄòCoz it may not be that easy for everyone to ‚Äúizhaar‚Äù (express) their views - especially when their intent and inputs are pure as they can be, but are in turn laced with their own brand of self doubt. So, if not anything else, at least, acknowledge. Ask the understated, and you‚Äôd know how valuable such ‚Äúizhaar‚Äù (expression) can be. #EconomyOfWords #PauseAndListen #FrenzyOfWordsMayCamouflagePricelessExpression\n\nI quit my high paying job in December. And I did something crazier last week. I went all out on my socials and announced that I am going to release a new song every Friday - A self imposed challenge where I compose, write, produce and release one song every week, for the next 50 weeks at least. The only hitch, I don't know music production or the music software too well and I have to learn it all on the go. ü´£ There is a proverb for this in Tamil for this behaviour: Velila pora onaanai madiyila edutthu vittukkitta maadhiri (Poor translation: Like picking up a garden lizard off the fence and putting it on your lap - you get the drift!) Back story: So I have been singing for decades now. But I never took music as my first priority. There was a booming day job and fascinating projects I worked on that took most of my time and music and dubbing was aide gigs that were planned around the 9-5 hustle. But somewhere last year, I was in a state of severe Dysphoria.It was strange. Because I had landed the job of my dreams. I was working with an amazing boss and an amazing team and the work I was getting to do was dreamy. But it just felt wrong. There was a constant itch to turn around and become a full time musician. Eventually, I had no choice but to listen. I took the leap and quit my job. I knew I wanted to become a better singer, but also a better composer. I have always worked with some phenomenal music producers like Santhosh Jayakaran, Jerin C Raj, Alvin Preslet and Prashanth Techno on my previous compositions and they really are awesome and inspirational to work with.. But there is always a little bit lost in translation, you know? How do you explain completely in words what you're hearing in your head? That can come out only if I sit and produce the music myself. Only, I am one baccha producer that has a loooong way to go before actually becoming self sufficient. That meant only one thing. I jump in and start moving towards the direction. I wanted to start this in Jan, but I had to figure out some things at the personal front and then I procrastinated and fought cold feet for a month. But on May 1st, I set myself up for a daunting challenge code named #MadrasheWeekly by my instafam. And we have hit the first Friday today. I started work on the song titled 'En Vaanam Nee' on Monday this week. And here we are, releasing the first track of the series in less than a week. Kept the song simple enough so I don‚Äôt get too bogged down in my very first attempt. But yea, I am just a tiny bit proud that I figured out how to produce a song end to end and released one today. Leaving a link below. https://lnkd.in/gPm62xvi Please do give me your feedback and support me by subscribing to the Youtube channel. And if you do like the song, Please do share it around."
