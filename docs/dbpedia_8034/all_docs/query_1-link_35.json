        "text": "St. Aloysius Gonzaga School in Mangalore has been an integral part of our family’s journey since 2019. With my children thriving within its nurturing environment, I can attest to the school's commitment to academic excellence and holistic development.\n\nFrom the outset, it has embodied values of compassion, discipline, and academic rigor, instilling in my children responsibility and a love for learning. Even during the COVID-19 pandemic, the school's dedication never wavered. Through seamless transitions to online learning and constant communication, they ensured every child received quality education and support.\n\nBeyond academics, the school fosters a vibrant community where students explore their interests, engage in extracurricular activities, and develop essential life skills. The faculty and staff go above and beyond to nurture each child's talents and strengths, empowering them to excel academically and as compassionate individuals.\n\nSt. Aloysius Gonzaga School is more than an educational institution; it's a second home where children are cherished, challenged, and inspired to reach their full potential. As a parent, I'm immensely grateful for its profound impact on my children's lives.\n\nAs an Aloysian alumni, St Aloysius Gonzaga School was always my first choice for my son Rinell. It has met all my expectations in terms of modern infrastructure, excellent management, skilled and affectionate staff and school ambience.\n\nAt the beginning of the academic year, Rinell had difficulty in adjusting to the school environment and hardly spoke or participated in the classroom activities. His teacher approached me personally to discuss this issue. After understanding the reason, she constantly encouraged him with a lot of patience and affection, leading to a drastic change in his confidence, communication and social skills within a few months. Now, he is eager to attend school and enthusiastically narrates everything after returning home.\n\nSAGS along with discipline gives equal importance to academics and co- curricular activities. It provides equal and ample opportunities to all children ensuring their intellectual, physical and social development thus contributing confident and disciplined individuals for a better society.\n\nI am grateful to the Principal, Coordinator and the teachers for grooming my child with values and confidence.\n\nAs a parent, I take this prospect to thank the principal and teachers of SAGS for their endless care, help, collaboration, and most significantly, patience. My son is gifted to be with this stunning bunch of teachers. I selected this school for my son Ruhaan with the anticipation of offering him the finest possible schooling and exposure to extra-curricular activities. The learning experiences are exceeding my expectations. I have witnessed that he has evolved to be more creative, disciplined, and inquisitive while engaging in all his activities and his confidence has remarkably enhanced. I am highly obliged to have my son studying at SAGS. Thank you, teachers, for your perseverance, quality care, willingness, diligent efforts, and passion. I wish the entire SAGS team all the best in all their future endeavours.\n\nI still remember Aiden’s first day of school when Principal, Fr Melwyn Anil Lobo SJ and the kindergarten teachers welcomed the tiny tots with warm hugs, bright smiles and handshakes. It has been 3 years since then and every morning he seems to feel the same excitement to go to school as it was his first day.\n\nThe school not only focuses on academics but also on co-scholastic areas and extra-curricular activities. The school ensures to cover portions at a comfortable speed and enough time is given for revision classes towards the exams. I want to express my sincere gratitude to Aiden’s wonderful class teachers over these years, Mrs. Sushrutha MP, Mrs. Averyl Rebello and Mrs. Deepa Sequeira for nurturing, guiding and always being there to answer all his doubts and questions. My heartfelt thanks to all his other teachers as well for making Aiden’s learning experience a wonderful one.\n\nEvery time he hears his school's name, his happiness and pride warm my heart, reassuring me we made the right choice with St. Aloysius Gonzaga.\n\nSt. Aloysius Gonzaga School is a great place where students are imparted excellent academic and extracurricular coaching. I am proud to say that my son, Julian Henry Mathias, is studying in this prestigious institution. I commend the effort put in by the teachers in advancing their own knowledge, as well as that of our children. It has been a great experience to watch my child become more independent and confident at such an early age under the able guidance of the affectionate and skilled teachers. I would like to specially mention about the “school App” which is timely updated with its new features. It is a very user friendly, fast, and convenient app. I am grateful to the Management, Principal, teaching, and support staff for providing the holistic education that has helped my child to excel both socially and academically.\n\nI chose St. Aloysius Gonzaga for its strong academic reputation and its focus on providing all-round development. There are many things I like about SAGS. It has a well-balanced academic program, awesome extracurricular activities, a clean campus, spacious classrooms, and expert teachers.\n\nSAGS is a place where my kids learn, laugh, play, and enjoy. It has great activities that continue to inspire children. The warm and nurturing academic environment has transformed our daughter into an avid and successful learner.\n\nThank you for providing such a strong foundation. I am so grateful.\n\nAs a proud parent, I can wholeheartedly attest to the institution's unwavering commitment to the holistic development of its students. St Aloysius Gonzaga is a name synonymous with quality education, renowned for its dedication to imparting knowledge and values. The school not only excels in academics but also places a strong emphasis on sports training, nurturing the physical and mental well-being of its students.\n\nThe teachers here play a pivotal role in shaping our children's future. Their dedication and commitment to each student's success are truly commendable. Enrolling your child here is a choice for a bright and promising future, where they will receive not just education but also the values and skills they need to thrive in a diverse world.\n\nSt. Aloysius Gonzaga School is fantastic, with highly practical teaching methods. My child is grasping everything well. The staff is excellent and cooperative. The school puts in sincere efforts to bring out the best in the children, whether in extracurricular activities, sports, or academics. The exposure to the outside world and the opportunities given to the children to develop their skills are truly boosting their confidence. As a parent, I am always delighted to see the vibrant work. I look forward to the same in the future.\n\nWe feel privileged to share this testimonial about St Aloysius Gonzaga School, where our son (Class 8) and daughter (Class 2) are currently studying. Our journey with this esteemed institution has been truly wonderful. This institution has given our kids a platform to explore multiple facets of their personality, both in academic and extracurricular activities. The commitment shown by the teachers, the state-of-the-art facilities, and emphasis on values have had a profound impact on our kids. We are truly grateful to St Aloysius Gonzaga School for shaping our kids into responsible and confident individuals. It is indeed an apt place for a child's holistic development\n\nAll the efforts and hard work you invested to bring out the best of all our wards can never be repaid in mere words we can only feel grateful for having teachers like you. “We still remember very clearly the first day, as we entered Gonzaga, Ms. Mabel welcomed us with a smile.\n\nThe Principal was very approachable and welcoming, when we met him. We made up our mind to enroll our children in St Aloysius Gonzaga School. Initially, we had to drop the children to school, which gave me an opportunity to meet all the teaching and non-teaching staff of Gonzaga, whom I found friendly.\n\nThe various activities organized, such as swimming, accolades (Communicative English), extra-curricular activity (ECA) and co-curricular activity (CCA) during school timings, have helped to nurture wholesome development of our children. In one of the Open House our daughter was upset with her marks. The manner in which the class teacher consoled and encouraged my daughter, I felt even I would not have been able to do so.\n\nOverall, we can say we are contented that we made a prudent decision by enrolling our children in St Aloysius Gonzaga School.\n\nSending my daughter to India from Kuwait amidst the Covid pandemic for her 9th grade was a challenging decision. However, after exploring several CBSE schools, we settled on St Aloysius Gonzaga School, and it was a decision we never regretted. The school's faculty impressed us immensely with their high qualifications and dedication. They made sure to explain concepts clearly, making it easy for the children to follow the curriculum despite the challenging circumstances. One aspect that stood out was the school's emphasis on extracurricular activities. From sports to arts and cultural events, there was something for every child, encouraging them to actively participate and explore their interests beyond academics. This holistic approach to education not only enriched my daughter's academic journey but also fostered her overall growth and development. St Aloysius Gonzaga School provided a nurturing environment where my daughter not only thrived academically but also gained valuable life skills and experiences that will undoubtedly shape her future positively.\n\nThis is the 2nd year at St. Aloysius Gonzaga School for our children and we couldn’t be more grateful for this amazing school. My children love going to school every day and they are excelling both socially and academically. It has a well-balanced academic program with an emphasis on the student. We as parents know how important part a disciplined school life plays in later years. Our children had earlier studied abroad and we always wanted them to feel comfortable and cared for, but at the same time to be in a disciplined environment. This could be only possible due to an able management and administration led by the Principal. Through all of the ups and downs of this pandemic, the teachers and school staff have worked so hard to nurture our children and keep school a positive, healthy place. The leadership and staff are incredibly caring, compassionate, and focused on each individual child. In addition the teachers are extremely skilled and professional.\n\nWe decided to enroll our daughter to Class 11 in St Aloysius Gonzaga School after her initial schooling in Madikeri, and we are happy with our decision. My daughter stays in the hostel, and although this was her first experience away from home, she has been very happy. Thanks to the experienced teachers, she has not felt the need to attend any extra classes outside school. The school maintains a very good balance between academics and extracurricular activities. This boosts the children’s confidence, teaches them to work in groups and helps them to handle winning and losing with dignity, which in turn helps them to face challenges later in life. The school’s commitment to fostering a well-rounded education is impressive.\n\nAs a parent, I am truly grateful for the exceptional experience my child receives at St. Aloysius Gonzaga School. The affectionate, student-friendly, and encouraging environment has greatly contributed to students' academic and personal growth. The teachers are incredibly supportive and caring, providing the best possible guidance and attention to each student.\n\nThe school's infrastructure is top-notch, with well-maintained facilities that create a perfect atmosphere for learning. The management is highly dedicated, ensuring that the systems in place run smoothly and efficiently. The library and other resources are excellent, offering my child ample opportunities to explore and learn.\n\nWhat sets this school apart is its learner-centric approach, focusing on the holistic development of every student. The supportive and nurturing environment has helped my child thrive not only academically but also socially and emotionally. I am very happy with the education and care my child receives at St. Aloysius Gonzaga School.\n\nSt. Aloysius Gonzaga School in Mangalore is the greatest gift we could have given to our child. It's an exemplary institution that provides a holistic education, nurturing young minds to become compassionate, intelligent, and responsible individuals. The school's dedicated faculty, state-of-the-art infrastructure, and emphasis on extracurricular activities creates a conducive learning environment. Walking through the doors of the school feels like a giant hug for the child. Children are cared for, respected, listened to, encouraged and challenged to outperform themselves. The school's values of discipline, hard work, and service to society are instilled in it's students, preparing them for a bright future. SAGS is truly creating not just people, but Individual personalities. We are so thankful to have chosen the right school for my son which has helped him shape into a well-rounded and compassionate individual."
