Suman started his career in the role of a police officer in the Tamil movie Neechal Raram (1977) produced by T.R.Rammanna. Then he appeared in Tamil film Thee (1981) where he played a sincere police officer. In more than 3 decades, he acted more than 150 films as a hero in Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Odia and English language films. He returned to acting by playing the villain in the Tamil films Sivaji and Kuruvi. He was cast as the main antagonist in the Malayalam movie Sagar alias Jacky. He won Nandi Award for Best Actor for the film Bava Bavamaridi. Suman is also starred in the Hollywood film Death And Taxis.

Early life

Born in Mangalore, to a Tuluva community, his family later moved to Chennai where he did his schooling from The Besant Theosophical High School, Chennai and B.A. in English Literature. His mother, Kesari Chandra, was the Principal of the Ethiraj College for women in Chennai. His father, Susheel Chandra, worked for I.O.C. Chennai. His mother tongue is Tulu. Suman learnt music and Sanskrit from H.A.S. Shastri.

He was one of the prominent actors of the Tamil and Telugu screens, earning Rs 5 lakh per film and completely booked up to the end of 1988.And then, suddenly, the bubble burst. On the night of 18 May, police arrived at Suman's house, seized some pornographic video tapes and arrested Suman. The charge against him, of course, was far more serious than the mere illegal possession of a few blue films.Suman was arrested on the basis of far more offensive complaints filed by three young girls claiming that he had abducted, raped and forced them to act in blue films. Overnight, the hero of the film industry became its blackest villain. Later all these allegations were proved to be false in Tamil Nadu court
