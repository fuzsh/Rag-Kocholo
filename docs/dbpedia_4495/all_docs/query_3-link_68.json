        "text": "Welcome to James Arthur Vineyards\n\nEstablished in 1996, James Arthur Vineyards is nestled amidst 400 acres of rolling hills and natural prairie grasslands minutes north of Lincoln, near Raymond, NE. The surrounding beauty creates a picturesque setting for our winery, which houses an immaculate tasting room, a gift shop, a stunning party room, and all the production facilities. Since opening its front doors, JAV has hosted thousands of visitors from all over the world. Everyone is encouraged to sample from a wide variety of wines, stroll the grounds or sit under the covered deck by the waterfall–or enjoy an intimate setting by a warm crackling fire in the tasting room during those cold winter days, all while sipping some of Nebraska’s finest. Our family’s 3rd generation has now become involved in the winery, making JAV a true family endeavor. Built on passion, dedication, and old-fashioned hard work, JAV has built a business Nebraskans can be proud of. After all, this is our home, love, and livelihood. From our family to yours!\n\n“Crushing it for 25+ years!”\n\nWhat started out as a hobby has turned into a popular Nebraska destination celebrating over 20 years of business. James Arthur Vineyards in Raymond, NE opened its doors on September 13th, 1997. Since then, the winery has hosted thousands of guests, including visitors from every state and numerous countries from around the world.Owned by James Arthur and Neenie Jeffers and Jim and Barb Ballard, JAV is Nebraska’s largest winery and is located just north of Lincoln.
