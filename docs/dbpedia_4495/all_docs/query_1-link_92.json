        "text": "While Ben Affleck’s “Argo” may have offered a comedic take on the 1979 Iranian revolution, “Septembers of Shiraz” appears, from the looks of the new trailer, to make a more serious examination of the historical events.\n\nAdapted by screenwriter Hanna Weg from Dalia Sofer’s bestselling novel, the film stars Salma Hayek-Pinault, Adrien Brody, and Shohreh Aghdashloo as a Jewish family facing an unexpected journey in the aftermath of the Iranian uprising.\n\nAccording to the film’s official synopsis, it tells “the harrowing story of a secular Jewish family in Iran as they fight for their lives immediately following the 1979 revolution. [It] illustrates the impact of political upheaval on ordinary people and gives us an incisive examination of a troubled moment in history.”\n\nScreenwriter Weg did some additional writing on the Hayek-Pinault-produced 2015 animated adaptation of Kahlil Gibran’s “The Prophet.” Hayek-Pinault also executive produced “Septembers of Shiraz.”\n\n“Septembers of Shiraz” opens in New York and Los Angeles on June 24."
