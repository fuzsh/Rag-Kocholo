        "text": "Shirazi Salad, or Salad-e Shirazi, is a simple and bright Persian cucumber and tomato salad that’s loaded with herbs and dressed in citrus and extra virgin olive oil! This quick no-lettuce salad is the perfect side to almost any entree.\n\nA few tips make all the difference, so be sure to read on.\n\nShirazi Salad, or Salad-e Shriazi, is a simple Persian cucumber and tomato salad that hails from the beautiful city of Shiraz in southwestern Iran.\n\nAt first glance, it looks a whole lot like my earlier Mediterranean cucumber and tomato salad. The similarities are definitely there!\n\nBut, think of this Shirazi salad as Mediterranean salad’s cousin, only a bit more nuanced. This salad uses a couple more ingredients. Plus, it’s a bit herbier, juicier, and has slightly more zing.\n\nYou’ll love how simple it is, yet so bright and packed with flavor! It’s the perfect addition next to almost any entree.\n\nShirazi Salad Ingredients\n\nThere are a few Persian restaurants in the Atlanta area that my family frequents. Every time we’re out for Persian food, I always order a side of Shirazi salad next to my kubideh kabobs, which are quite similar to grilled kofta. And I’ve noticed, each chef has their own take or twist on this Persian cucumber and tomato salad.\n\nTraditional Shriazi Salad, as my Persian friends pointed out, includes: cucumbers, tomatoes, and red onions. For seasoning, salt, pepper, and dried mint. And for the citrus, they use sour grape extract or juice, also called ab-e-ghooreh.\n\nThis is a slightly different version, my own modern twist with a few additions I think you’ll love!\n\nHere’s what you need to make this version of Shirazi Salad:\n\n– Tomatoes: I used 3 larger Roma tomatoes. Pick tomatoes that are firm but have a little bit of give to them. Although some recipes require you to remove tomato seeds, you do not have to. Tip: If you’re tomatoes are too juicy or extra ripe, once you dice them, throw them in a colander to get rid of excess liquid.\n\n– Cucumbers: Use 1 large English cucumber or 3 to 4 small Persian cucumbers. Tip: Both varieties are seedless, sweeter in taste, and have soft skin so you won’t need to peel them. Do not use slicing cucumbers, which have a thick, waxy skin and can be bitter in flavor.\n\n– Onions: In this recipe, I use about 1/4 to 1/2 a medium-sized red onion. Tip: Try to chop the onions as finely as possible. If you prefer to use shallots, which are less pungent, that will work also.\n\n– Green Bell Pepper. This is completely optional, but I do feel it adds some crunch and extra flavor. I used only 1/2 a green bell pepper, seeded and chopped.\n\n– Mint: This is what truly distinguishes Salad-e Shirazi. Traditionally, dried, crushed mint is what’s used here. I often use both dry mint and fresh mint, if available. Tip: if dry mint is not available to you, you can use about 1/2 cup chopped fresh mint.\n\n– Fresh Herbs: I’ve seen Shriazi salads with just mint (dry or fresh), but I’ve also tasted some that include a variety of fresh herbs, which I really like. In this version, I use about 2 tbsp each parsley, dill, and cilantro. You can use just one of the three herbs or any combination that’s available to you. This is completely optional.\n\n– Seasoning: Aside from a good pinch of kosher salt and black pepper, I like to use about 1 teaspoon of sumac. Sumac is beautiful deep red spice which comes from sumac berries. It’s ever so present on the Persian table (and is used in a variety of Mediterranean and Middle Eastern foods.) Sumac adds depth and a certain tang that is different from what you’ll find in lemon or lime juice. It’s completely optional, but I highly recommend it. You can find all-natural sumac here at our online shop.\n\n-Dressing: Shirazi salad, much like many Mediterranean salads, does not require much but citrus and quality extra virgin olive oil.\n\nBecause ab-e-ghooreh (sour grape juice), which is traditionally used, is not easily available, I used juice of 2 limes in this recipe. Then I added a generous drizzle of Early Harvest Greek extra virgin olive oil. The rich, herby undertones of Early Harvest EVOO really enhance this salad. (Find Early Harvest EVOO at our online shop here.)\n\nHow to Make Shirazi Salad (Persian Cucumber and Tomato Salad): A Few Tips\n\nA couple last tips\n\n– If you like this salad more on the crunchy side, don’t dress it with the lime juice and olive oil until you’re ready to serve.\n\n– For a juicier, bolder salad, go ahead and dress the Shirazi salad, then cover and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes or so to allow the flavors to meld.\n\nWhat to Serve with Salade Shirazi?\n\nThis salad is super bright and versatile, I love serving it with all sorts of entrees. It’s great for a simple soup and salad type lunch maybe as a strater to a bowl of warm lentil soup.\n\nA few options for you: Lemon Garlic Salmon; Pan Seared Trout; Garlic Dijon Chicken; Chicken Kabobs; or Leg of Lamb.\n\nLooking for more salads?
