        "text": "EXCLUSIVE: Here’s a glimpse of director Wayne Blair’s thriller Septembers Of Shiraz, based on the best-selling novel by Dalia Sofer. The film will debut at this year’s Toronto International Film Festival as a Gala presentation. Starring Salma Hayek, Adrien Brody, and Shohreh Aghdashloo, the film portrays the true story of a secular Jewish family and the unexpected journey they face during post-revolustionary Iran. The clip features Farnez Amin (Hayek), pleading for details on the whereabouts of her husband, who was taken into custody and accused of espionage. “It’s time you understood, sister Amin, that the times when people like you could demand things from us are over. Now, it is our turn,” forewarns a malevolent Mohsen (Alon Aboutboul). As events build toward a dangerous bid to escape, Farnez and her husband Isaac Amin (Brody) must confront their fundamental identity and what their future may hold.\n\nWatch on Deadline\n\ndeadline-logo-svg Deadline\n\nSignup for Breaking News Alerts & Newsletters\n\nYour Email\n\nBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.
