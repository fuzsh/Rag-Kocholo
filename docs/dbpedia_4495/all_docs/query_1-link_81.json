        "meta_description": "The fact that this movie takes place in Iran, and the characters are all Iranian, but they speak English, is a little annoying. But the fact that they all have Persian accents just makes it worse. At some point the accents are very accurate and impressive, but even then it's consistently distracting, and it makes the characters feel less real than they already did, thanks to the poor screenplay. It has its moments, but the majority of the dialogue is kinda bad to downright awful. The movie tries to tell an important story without showing the revolutionaries as just good",

The power dynamics at play here are actually very interesting, and exactly the type of thing I'd want to see explored in a movie about the revolution; I just wish they were explored better. There are some strong scenes here and there, but not enough to save the movie. With that said, for a movie that started so poorly, it did start to win me over a bit. Overall, not completely terrible, but definitely not good."
