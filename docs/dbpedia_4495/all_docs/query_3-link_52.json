        "text": "I had the best sangria (and patatas bravas) of my life when we went to Spain in 2013.\n\nPerhaps my recollection of that first drink is slightly biased. We’d just arrived to Barcelona from a long, tiring train ride, and then walked what seemed like miles carrying 40-pound backpacks into the city to reach our AirBnB. We were tired and hangry, to say the least.\n\nOur first thought upon dropping our bags was “tapas and sangria.” So off we went in search of sustenance, and what we found was glorious.\n\nCan we all just agree the Spanish do it well, “it” being everything?\n\nTraditionally the Spanish enjoy coffee in the morning, work a little, take an afternoon rest (or siesta), work a little more, then retire in the evening by eating tapas and drinking good wine with the people they love. Eventually, they slumber only to do it all over again the next day. If that doesn’t sound like a slice of heaven, I don’t know what does.\n\nOh, and did I mention they gifted the world with sangria? Does it get any better than this lush, fruity beverage? I think not.\n\nOrigins of Sangria\n\nThe earliest versions of sangria are believed to have originated more than 2,000 years ago when Romans, making their way through the Iberian Peninsula, planted vineyards along the way. And because drinking water was unsafe, it was often fortified with wine, spices, and herbs.\n\nThe earliest versions of what we now know as sangria were made in England and France in the 1800s, and sangria was eventually popularized after its formal arrival in the U.S. at the 1964 World’s Fair in New York.\n\nDespite its global popularity and common association with Spain, there is no official formula for sangria in Spain and locals are more often known to enjoy a drink similar to sangria known as tinto de verano. So while some Spaniards may enjoy sangria, it is a more popular drink among tourists. (source)\n\nThis recipe is my humble offering to a sangria-loving world.\n\nI’ve tasted, tested, researched, retested, and what I’ve come up with is this easy, 6-ingredient, traditional red sangria that’s got everything I’m looking for:\n\nFruit\n\nSweet\n\nDry\n\nLush\n\nSmooth\n\nRefreshing\n\n& Boozy\n\nI think I’m in love.\n\nThough there are many interpretations of what “traditional sangria” is, I’ve found that it typically requires these main components:\n\nFruit (like apples and oranges)\n\nOrange juice\n\nA sweetener (like brown sugar or cane sugar)\n\nA liquor (like brandy or rum)\n\nBold, fruity, dry Spanish red wine (like Tempranillo, Garnacha, or other Rioja wine)\n\n& Ice (for chilling)\n\nFor this version, I went with brandy because as soon as I smelled it, I immediately thought, “this smells like sangria!” But of course, if you’d rather use rum, be my guest.\n\nThis sangria is my new go-to summer drink. It’s:\n\nSimple\n\nSweet\n\nSlightly dry\n\nFruity\n\nBoozy\n\nSummery\n\nRefreshing\n\n& Simple\n\nEnjoy this recipe alongside any of your favorite summer dishes. A few of our favorite pairings include patatas bravas, stuffed peppers, veggie burgers, and salads."
