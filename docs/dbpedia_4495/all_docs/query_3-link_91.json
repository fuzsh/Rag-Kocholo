        "text": "Words by Helena Nicklin\n\nBoxed wine, also known as bag-in-box wine, was one of the industry winners during lockdown with more than one in four people aged 25-34 buying them during this period, according to a recent report from Sainsbury’s. Fewer trips to the shops might have been an initial, very real cause for this during the pandemic, but it seems that people soon realised that you can now get some pretty decent wine in boxes. Add some astonishing green credentials to the mix and it's little wonder that boxed wine / bag-in-box wine is a trend we are seeing exploding, with more and more brands available, many of them looking super swish and containing delicious, premium wine. Here are eight reasons to buy boxed wine in 2020 and eight suggestions for great ones to try:\n\n1) Tighter Technology\n\nBoxed wine no longer has to mean oxidised, vinegary wines thanks to huge leaps in quality with the technology, with many companies using special vacuum taps and collapsible bag inners that keep out oxygen properly. Oxygen after all is the killer of wine! Tip: If the tap looks like the one in the picture, you’re looking at the top of the range tech.\n\n2) Longer lasting than bottles\n\nThanks to this technology, boxed wine, once opened, can stay fresh for a month when stored upright and cool in the fridge (even the reds). Some even say six weeks but who keeps it that long anyway?!\n\n3) You can have one glass...\n\n… without feeling obliged to finish the whole bottle - or waste the rest of an opened bottle.\n\n4) Cheaper than bottle equivalents\n\nMost boxed wines now come in 2.25L sizes, the equivalent of 3 bottles of wine. Given that the packaging for boxed wine is a lot cheaper to produce than single use glass bottles AND the packaging works for three bottles worth of wine at a time, that value can be passed back the customer.\n\n5) Greener than glass\n\nA recent study has shown that the CO2 produced during the manufacture, transportation and disposing of a single use glass bottles can be up to ten times that of the infinitely more recyclable BiB wines. Producing bag-in-box wines consumes around 80% less water than glass bottles too. Many companies are now also going a step further, making sure their boxed wine packaging is as sustainably sourced and recyclable as possible. You’ll even see several boxed brands with environmental initiatives such as the BIB Wine Company, who are planting a tree for every box sold. What’s not to love? #lowcarbondrinking is real.\n\n6) Portability\n\nIt’s much easier to carry the equivalent amount of wine when it’s in a box than when in a bottle. That picnic in the park when we are allowed to see other humans again, or dinner parties, stocking up for Christmas… Imagine lugging three heavy, clinky, wine bottles around, when you could just pick up a pretty box with a hand strap.\n\n7) Quality wines\n\nIt may not have been the case in the past when bag-in box wine was known as ‘hangover juice’, but nowadays, you’ll find the same wines you’ll find in bottles inside those bags and boxes. The common misconception that it’s inferior wine needs to be rethought.\n\n8) No light strike\n\nLight strike is a phenomenon that’s becoming a bit of a buzz word this year. Generally speaking, it refers to the negative effects sunlight can have on wine, where funky, stinky aromas and flavours are produced. It doesn't take long to happen either, which is why you should avoid bottles sitting in shop windows. Wine in glass bottles are obviously much more susceptible to this than boxed wine, which is protected by the cardboard outer layer.\n\nHave we convinced you yet? Here are some boxed wines to try. Let us know what you think on Twitter @the3drinkers or Insta @thethreedrinkers:\n\nWHITE WINES\n\nMaree d’Ione Organic Fiano 2.25L\n\nFiano at its best is a great all-rounder grape, making easy-drinking, pineapple and orange scented whites. This one is exactly that with a lovely weight and balance of fruit and acidity. Very classy.\n\n£25.99 / £8.66 per bottle equivalent. Find it at Waitrose here\n\nBIB Wine Company Dry Furmint: 2.25L\n\nFurmint is one of the grapes that makes the famous Hungarian sweet wine called Tokaji. We’re seeing more dry Furmints on our shelves these days and we think it’s going to be the next big thing in wine. Crisp and refreshing, with subtle notes of honeysuckle. It’s a little bit different, versatile and very easy to love.\n\n£38 / £12.67 per bottle equivalent. Find it at bibwine.co.uk here\n\nWhen in Rome Grillo 2.25L\n\nGrillo is the Sicilian grape that will transport you back to a foreign summer holiday with warm winds and fresh seafood on the beach. Golden and tropical with a cool mineral core, this is rustic wine that’s easy going and perfect with simple weekday meals like pizza and pasta.\n\n£26.99 inc delivery / £8.99 per bottle equivalent. Find it on Amazon here\n\nClearsprings Sauvignon Blanc 2.25L\n\nA benchmark Sauvignon Blanc that’s lemon citrusy and leafy with classic grassy notes. Softer on acidity than some and for the price tag, it’s remarkably good value. Have it with goats cheese or quiche with salad and it will sing.\n\n£16 / £5.33 per bottle equivalent. Find it at Sainsbury’s here.\n\nRED WINES"
