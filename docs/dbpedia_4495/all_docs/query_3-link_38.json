We highly recommend Monarch Rentals! Or if you choose Sterling Catering or Lily Grace Catering, they also do rentals with a great price point if they are already providing catering.\n\nWhat is the capacity?\n\nThe Formal Garden and Sunset Vista can both accommodate up to 150 guests (our max guest count at Shiraz), but all the other spaces have their own guest limit you can see here.\n\nThe Formal Garden is for seated dinners with no more than 150 guests.\n\nShiraz Garden does not host events with more than 150 guests.\n\nDates available?\n\nSee Open Dates here.

We will send you the how-to details once they are ready!\n\nSchedule a tour, or can I just stop by?\n\nA tour appointment is required; fill out our tour request here to get started.\n\nWhat is the average budget of a couple getting married at Shiraz Garden?\n\nThat is a great question, and we're glad you asked! Generally, the average budget of a couple getting married at Shiraz Garden on a Saturday is between $25,000-$45,000+ for all wedding expenses (venue, food, dress, DJ, photographer, etc.). We have had some creative couples with smaller guest lists host lovely weddings in the $15,000-$25,000 range, and we have had several events here spending considerably more than the average.\n\nWill there be another wedding on the same day?\n\nWe only host one wedding each day to ensure the couple and their guests have the private and personal experience they are looking for without interruption.\n\nOvernight accommodations nearby? Where is the nearest hotel?\n\nSee the 10+ Hotels, Resorts, and cool BnBs less than 15 minutes from Shiraz Garden here, as well as activities for guests and groomsmen.\n\nHow close is Austin Bergstrom International Airport?\n\nWe are 17.4 miles away from the airport, meaning your guests don’t have to ever fight Austin traffic on their way to Shiraz Garden or lodging.\n\nDo we have to utilize your caterers?\n\nYes, you must choose from our list of amazing fire-star Catering Options. See the list of Catering Options HERE. Full-service catering includes but is not limited to full catering setup, serving food, busing tables, and trash removal (onsite dumpster).\n\nCan we bring our own alcohol? What are the rules on bar service?\n\nYou can supply your alcohol to be served by WeTendBar TABC servers. All alcohol must be behind the bar an hour before the reception and only accessible to the bar staff. See their general cost sheet here.\n\nWeTendBar is our exclusive bar-tending service with three exceptions 1) if you choose an all-inclusive package with Monarch Weddings, or 2) your catering can offer bar-tending (still requires pre-approval), 3) an additional mobile bar may be added (pre-approval needed).\n\nShots are prohibited.\n\nWhat happens in case of rain?\n\nOur Covered Ceremony area at The Formal Garden is 120 feet long and can accommodate 150 guests for your rain plan! A tent can expand that coverage or connect to the other covered spaces.\n\nOr the Indoor Space can be used for both ceremonies with guests seated at tables.\n\nSee more information and photos of this space + rain plan here.\n\nHow many cars will your parking lot accommodate?\n\nOur parking lot has 82 posts with six designated handicap spaces, is paved, and has a paved walking trail to the reception area (Formal Garden), and part of the path to Sunset Vista is crushed granite.\n\nDo you provide table linens, cups, silverware, etc.?\n\nWe do not provide linens. We encourage you to utilize your rental, floral, or caterer for this. \"Bride-to-Bride\" forms and Facebook Groups are also great places to get linens. We do not provide cups, silverware, etc.\n\nDo you allow dogs on-site?\n\nYes! We are a dog-friendly venue for ceremonies and photos only. If a professional pet attendant is employed to look after your dog post-ceremony/reception, then we can accommodate them staying on-site. Ask the director for more information and a pet agreement.\n\nWhat form of payment does Shiraz Garden accept?\n\nWe prefer checks but will accept bank transfers.\n\nWhat time will I have access to the venue to decorate?\n\nYou will have access to the venue at the time listed on your contract, not earlier. Please plan accordingly! See venue access time here.\n\nDo you include a \"wedding day coordinator?\"\n\nWe do not include a coordinator, but you can add our in-house coordinator to your package or hire a licensed and insured coordinator or planner.\n\nThe Venue Representative will stay near the duration of your big day and help your wedding party move around the property for photos via ATV, answer questions from your vendors and direct them as necessary, etc. But as far as your timeline, sending you down the aisle, etc. that is your coordinator or planner's job and specialty!\n\nVendor Questions\n\nWhat are our catering options at Shiraz Garden?\n\nSee our amazing list of fire-star Catering Options - HERE. We do not allow catering services from companies, not on our list. Full-service catering includes but is not limited to full catering setup, serving food, busing tables, and trash removal (onsite dumpster).\n\nWhat is the pre-approval process for vendors?\n\nAll vendors will need to send their contact info to us via your Wedding Workspace (here) for us to approve them and have them sign our vendor agreement, provide insurance and schedule a walkthrough.\n\nDo I have to use your preferred vendors?\n\nNo, (except catering and bartenders); however, we have personal experience with these vendors and know they provide exceptional services and are familiar with Shiraz Garden's rules and procedures. All vendors do have to be insured and approved by Shiraz Garden's Director (preferred vendors already have approval).\n\nPlanning Questions\n\nWhat time do you suggest we start the ceremony?\n\nYou are here for the views! And the sunset, of course, so we recommend having your ceremony 1.5 hrs before sunset (sunset calculator) to give you that glow plus an hour for photos. Your planner/coordinator, with the help, you get it just perfect!\n\nHow will the tables, chairs, etc. be arranged for my sized event?\n\nWe require a layout from our couples/planners 30 days before the event and provide setup of Shiraz Garden, including tables and chairs per the layout provided.\n\nCandles, Fire, Fireworks, Sparklers?\n\nFireworks are prohibited except for exit sparklers at the Formal Garden on the blacktop.\n\nCandles are not allowed; battery-operated candles are a good alternative.\n\nWe do allow contained fire specific to a religious ceremony under supervision.\n\nWe are using a rental company. Can they drop items off or pick them up outside of the rental period?\n\nYour rentals must be delivered during your rental period (Friday or Saturday) unless given written permission by Shiraz Garden Director four weeks in advance. If there are no other events, it may be possible to pick up the rentals on Monday.\n\nIs there a PA system, mic?\n\nWe do not have a PA system.

For small events at the Formal Garden, there is a built-in sound system with a phone or laptop plug-in behind the bar.\n\nRestrictions on children/kids at the wedding?\n\nIf there are 10 children between the ages of 2-10 years old going to be present couple must add on one (1) additional Shiraz Staff member to ensure child safety.\n\nIf there are 11-15 children between the ages of 2-10 years old going to be present couple must add on two (2) additional Shiraz Staff members to ensure child safety.\n\nEach additional Shiraz Staff member will be added at a flat rate of $160 (each).\n\nI see the photos of the Persian rugs. Are those included?\n\nThese incredible rugs are not included but are easily added to any package. These authentic, hand-knotted Persian Rugs will add that touch of magic, surprise, and color to your aisle, lounge areas, or dance floor. See available rugs here.\n\nIs Rehearsal Included?\n\nA complimentary 1-hour Rehearsal is included with the Friday or Saturday rental. The time is subject to other booked events, but rehearsals can start no later than 3:00 pm. Rehearsal scheduled with Shiraz Director one month before the event.\n\nBridal or Engagement Photos?\n\nWe welcome our couples who book our Recommended Photographers to come to Shiraz Garden for bridal or engagement photos. If Shiraz couples or non-Shiraz couples want to take photos here, we’d welcome you to see our pricing guide for photo sessions here.\n\nWhen can I schedule a Final Walkthrough?\n\nOutside of the initial tour, the couple and coordinator/planner are encouraged to come for a final walk-through at least 60 days before the event. This provides time to finalize details before Shiraz Online Planner is due 30 days before the event. Times and availability are subject to other booked events. Couples and Coordinators/Planners are encouraged to come to Shiraz Garden Open Houses if they need to visit the property outside of the initial tour and final walkthrough.\n\nSetup and Day-of-Event Questions\n\nAre outside snacks and trays permitted?\n\nOutside food and drink are permitted before the ceremony. It is not allowed after the start of the event. Please, no drinks in glass bottles. This means you can bring in food while you are getting ready or for brunch at one of the river pavilions or lounge area in front of the Water Garden just outside the Bridal Cottage. The same goes for Groom's Cabin.\n\nWhat is the event clean-up process?\n\nCouples are expected to return used venue spaces to as close to the condition they received them in as possible. We provide general cleaning after each event.\n\nCan we take photos around Shiraz Garden on our wedding day?\n\nAbsolutely, this is one of the best parts of Shiraz Garden! It is also why we recommend you work with our preferred photographers who know every space and when it looks its best, and better yet, how to get there! They have all taken photos and spent considerable time at Shiraz Garden to guarantee you use your time here wisely. Starting September 2020, Shiraz Garden will have a Venue Representative at all events and will provide transportation of the couple and photographer via ATV to portrait spots. See more on this here.\n\nCan we nail decorations to the walls or hang things like streamers or lanterns from the beams?\n\nNo, but command hooks are permitted.\n\nAre shuttles and buses allowed?\n\nYes, shuttles and buses are both allowed to pick up and drop off at the parking lot. Pick up and drop off at the Formal Garden is limited to smaller van-size vehicles.\n\nCan we bring golf carts?\n\nYes, with written permission from the director. We recommend Good Bull Golf Carts, a local rental company that we recommend if you want to provide transportation for your guests to and from sites.\n\nCan vehicles be left overnight?\n\nVehicles cannot be left overnight. Please advise your guests of this policy via your website, welcome bags, and throughout your planning process. The gates will be locked at midnight, and as we are also a working ranch, the gates remain locked at other times to keep the cows and horses in! We appreciate your understanding. If you have any guests staying at the Hyatt Lost Pines, it is only 5 miles away; Hampton Inn & Suites is 8 miles away, as are other next-door hotels from Shiraz Garden."
