        "text": "Shiraz truly is a city like no other – lined with endless blossoming gardens and palaces, mosques and markets, Shiraz is easily one of the most romantic places in the world. The city has given birth to some of the most famous Persian poets who wrote about love, beauty, and faith, and may as well inspire you to savor the sweet side of life. The people of Shiraz are known to be kind, laid back and particularly fond of life, and their loving attitudes are contagious. Whether you’re in a frenzy to tick sites off your bucket list or want to slow down and enjoy, Shiraz is a must for every traveler in Iran. Not to mention, the city is also the gateway to the legendary ruins of Persepolis, which by itself is a place that everyone should visit at least once.\n\nTo be very honest, I almost missed out on Shiraz during my first trip to Iran. Due to a change of plans, I found myself traveling westward from Yazd and running critically short on time, visiting Shiraz seemed like too much of a detour. However, every local I spoke to urged me to go to Shiraz, and looking back I’m beyond grateful they did. Together with my incredible experiences in Chabahar and Qom, Shiraz was definitely a highlight of my trip to Iran and I probably would not be able to forgive myself had I missed out on this amazing place (my only regret now is that I didn’t bring my fiance along :P).\n\nNo matter how long you are in Iran for, you should dedicate at the very least two days to this amazing city. I’m begging you!!! And to make the most out of your visit, I compiled this full Shiraz travel guide that tells you everything you need to know about Iran’s City of Gardens and Poets.\n\nRead more: Full Travel Guide To Persepolis, Iran\n\nPin It For Later!\n\nWhere Is Shiraz?\n\nIran’s fifth-most populous city is located in the southwest of the country and serves as the capital of Fars Province (that name alone should tell you about the importance of this region in Persian culture), and lies only 60 kilometers from Persepolis. The city is surrounded by the scenic terraces of the Zagros Mountains, which once served as vineyards in pre-Islamic times (you may be familiar with Shiraz Wine, which is now produced in Australia and South Africa). Its central location has made the city a center of culture, art, and learning since the 13th century.\n\nWeather In Shiraz\n\nShiraz has a semi-arid climate with hot summers and cool winters. It’s pleasant to visit throughout the year, although daytime temperatures in summer can get quite high. When visiting Shiraz in summer, it’s recommended to plan extended outdoor activities, such as a visit to Persepolis, early in the day to beat the heat. Gardens, on the other hand, are refreshing oases that flaunt stunning blossoms in late spring and early summer, as well as protect from excessive heat.\n\nHow To Get To Shiraz\n\nBeing one of the most important cities in Iran, there are plenty of options to get to Shiraz, including:\n\nFlights: Shiraz has one of Iran’s major airports that connects the city with other larger and smaller cities all across Iran.\n\nBuses: There is plenty of bus traffic in and out of Shiraz, making it easy to reach the city from places like Yazd, Esfahan, and Bandar Abbas.\n\nTrains: Shiraz is also part of the railway network that links it to other major cities.\n\nIs Shiraz Safe?\n\nAs a tourist and woman, I have always felt extremely safe in Shiraz. The cities is very walkable and you’ll see many women roaming around alone; scams and petty crime is rare despite of the tough financial situation that has been ravaging Iran for years; most people are very kind, welcoming, and helpful – they won’t unnecessarily bother you but if you need help, they will be ready to extend both hands. Therefore I believe Shiraz is a safe city for travelers, including solo female travelers.\n\nWhere To Stay In Shiraz\n\nBeing a large and touristic city, Shiraz has plenty of accommodations for all budgets to offer.\n\nHotels: from luxury hotels to family-friendly inns, you can find all kinds of hotels in Shiraz, although the most enticing option might be a historic boutique hotel in the old city center, such as Oscru Hotel. Unfortunately, international hotel booking platforms don’t operate in Iran, but you can always contact local tour operators such as Termeh Travel for information and booking. Keep in mind that international bank transactions don’t work in Iran and be prepared to pay for your accommodation in cash.\n\nHostels: there are many safe and budget-friendly hostel options for backpackers and solo travelers in Shiraz. Luckily, Hostel World is one of the few international platforms that operate in Iran, making it very easy to find hostels.\n\nCouchsurfing: my go-to option in Iran. The Couchsurfing community is very active in cities like Shiraz and you can easily find both male and female hosts. I personally had a very positive experience with a host in Shiraz, who accepted my request just half an hour prior to my arrival and showed me his way of life for the next two days. Do keep in mind however that you should not overstay your welcome – Iranians are very polite and will rarely let you know directly, but don’t stay for more than a few days with one person and don’t be too demanding. To access the Couchsurfing portal in Iran, you will need to use a VPN.\n\nWhat To Wear In Shiraz\n\nShiraz is socially quite relaxed for Iranian standards, in contrast to places like Qom or Balochistan. Nonetheless, the laws for modesty must still be obeyed. For men, a simple pants and shirt combination is sufficient, whereas women need to make sure to cover their curves and hair as well. Many Shirazi women are very fashionable, so if you want to blend in, you can try combos of stylish tunics and short scarves. If you are visiting in summer, opt for light fabrics that help you stay cool. There is no need to wear chador except in mosques and shrines, where visitors can borrow one for free.\n\nHow To Get Around In Shiraz\n\nGetting around Shiraz is very easy. Here are the preferred modes of transportation.\n\nMetro: Shiraz has a decent underground network and traveling by metro is a quick and reliable way to get around while avoiding rush hour traffic.\n\nTaxi: There’s no shortage of taxis in Shiraz and the fares are very affordable. I prefer to use the rideshare app Snapp! to get around safely and conveniently.\n\nOn foot: as mentioned before, Shiraz is very walkable, and with sights in virtually every block, a long walking tour is the most efficient option for a day of sightseeing. Your feet will probably hurt at the end of the day but your heart will be satisfied. 😉\n\nBest Places To Visit In Shiraz\n\nTo be honest, there are way too many places that are worth seeing in and around Shiraz. If I were to be thorough, this list would never end, but keeping in mind that most travelers have limits to their schedules, I narrowed it down to the most essential sites. Below are some of the best places to visit in Shiraz if you have around three days to spare, but if you have more time, you will encounter many more places in between.\n\nKeep in mind that most places on this list, including all gardens, tombs, and even mosques charge entry fees, which differ significantly for Iranians and foreigners. If you’re a foreigner, I strongly recommend keeping a separate budget for entry tickets as costs quickly add up but you should in no way miss out on these places.\n\nEram Garden\n\nIt should come to no surprise that the City of Gardens is, well, full of gardens, but if you had to choose just one garden, it would be Eram Garden. This UNESCO World Heritage site is believed to have been first built during the Seljuk rule but greatly enriched over the centuries. This large garden houses the most beautiful flowers and water features as well as a majestic house museum and is the best possible introduction to Shiraz.\n\nTomb of Hafez\n\nBorn in the 14th century, Hafez is widely regarded as one of the greatest Persian Sufi poets. His lyrical works artfully encapsule the spirit of Islamic mysticism and are widely studied across Asia until this date. Being native to Shiraz, it is only natural that Hafez was buried in this city. His tomb is nowadays surrounded by a relatively modern memorial structure that reflects influences of both epochs. Paying respect to this prolific poet is a must when in Shiraz, and the mausoleum is also an excellent place to study or rewind. To appreciate the works of this poet, take a look at the Divan of Hafez.\n\nTomb of Saadi\n\nLike Hafez, Saadi was another great Islamic poet native to Shiraz. His 13th century works focus largely on morality and social commentary that may still apply today. His mausoleum also consists of a modern structure with similar qualities to the Tomb of Hafez. To appreciate the work of this great poet, you may take a look at Bustan and Gulistan.\n\nDelgosha Garden\n\nDelgosha Garden is one of the many smaller gardens sprinkled across Shiraz. While the garden itself is nothing out of the ordinary, it’s a nice, less crowded version of the more popular gardens. It houses a quaint museum with (thanks to the low volume of visitors) very attentive staff and a shop that sells sweets made from the oranges harvested in the garden. I included Delgosha Garden due to its proximity to the Tomb of Hafez, but you may swap it with any other smaller garden.\n\nArg of Karim Khan\n\nThe Arg of Karim Khan is a central Zand-era citadel in the heart of old Shiraz. A few centuries ago, the fortress was used for defense and imprisonment, as well as the residence of ruler Karim Khan. Today, it represents a beautiful example of Safavid architecture that visitors can admire from outside as well as inside. Its visual prominence and central location makes it impossible to miss during any sightseeing trip.\n\nOscru Hotel\n\nAlong the vivid shopping streets near the Karim Khan Citadel, one can find many stylish cafes and boutique hotels with historic flair. Even if you are not staying in one of these hotels, you should at least consider having a cup of coffee in a place like Oscru Hotel to fully absorb the vibe of Shiraz. Most of the food served in these places is continental cuisine – not quite my taste but may be just what you’re looking for.\n\nVakil Bazaar\n\nVakil Bazaar is the historic market complex of Shiraz and it’s HUGE! Selling everything from handicrafts to textiles, Vakil Bazaar is the perfect place to shop for souvenirs, but even if you aren’t planning to buy anything, getting lost in the labyrinthesque alleys of this vast market hall is part of the essential Shiraz experience. Attached to the bazaar, you can find innumerable historic structures such as the old bathhouse and the Vakil Mosque, which are undoubtedly worth a visit.\n\nShah Cheragh Holy Shrine\n\nThe Shah Cheragh shrine houses the tomb of Ahmed bin Musa, brother of the eighth Shia Imam Reza, making it one of the holiest sites in Iran after the shrines in Mashhad and Qom. Visiting this shrine is a must not just for spiritual purposes but also to admire its impressive architecture. Being a sacred place, customs are enforced strictly and all foreign visitors will be assigned a guide who will share historical and theological knowledge. These guides tend to go deep into detail, so you should plan at least one hour for this place.\n\nNasir ul Mulk Mosque\n\nThe world famous Pink Mosque of Shiraz is easily one of the most iconic mosques in the world and reason alone to visit Shiraz. Describing the architectural details of this gorgeous mosque would require a post on its own, so I’ll let the picture tell you. To make the most out of your visit to the Nasir ul Mulk Mosque, you should keep the following things in mind:\n\nVisit in the early morning hours when the sunlight illuminates the colorful mosaic windows from the east and casts colorful reflections inside. During my visit in June, the rule was to arrive no later than 9 am. Lines to purchase entry tickets may be very long, so plan ahead.\n\nIt’s mandatory for women to wear chador while visiting the mosque. I recommend borrowing one of their pink flower print ones as they contrast more nicely with the environment than black ones. Some women also bring large white cloths to wear inside.\n\nThe administrators have a rocky relationship with photography; photoshoots are popular in this beautiful place but many believe such behavior distracts from the sanctity of the mosque, hence rules regarding photography frequently change. When I visited, it was allowed to take photos with phones and DSLRs under the supervision of a caretaker, but I was told just a few weeks prior, photography was completely prohibited.\n\nNaranjestan e Qavam\n\nMore simply known as the Qavam House, the Naranjestan e Qavam is another large, beautiful garden featuring a majestic 19th century residence that combines Persian and Victorian-style architecture. It houses the perhaps most elaborate house museum in Shiraz full of artifacts of the time. Having a sip of orange blossom drink is a must in this garden.\n\nBam e Shiraz\n\nAs mentioned before, Shiraz is surrounded by mountains that served as vineyards in ancient times. It should come to no surprise that these hills make great hiking trails and viewpoints to admire the city from above. Unfortunately, I didn’t have the chance to explore this area too much because of the hot temperatures in summer, but if I were to return at another time of the year I would certainly give it a try.\n\nMaharlu Lake\n\nIran is rich in natural wonders and one of them are salt lakes that adopt a pink color at certain times of the day. One of them can be found just outside of Shiraz with the name Maharlu Lake. I didn’t visit Maharlu Lake during my last trip since I had already seen a similar pink lake in Chabahar, but if it’s your first time visiting a salt lake you should definitely go for it.\n\nPersepolis\n\nPersepolis is one of those great architectural sites, on par with the Pyramids of Giza, that no visitor to Iran should miss at any cost! Locally known as Takht-e-Jamshid, the site served as the ceremonial capital of the Achaemenid Empire and consists of various palaces, tombs, and other structures dating back more than two-thousand years. It’s usually combined with a visit to the nearby site of Naqsh-e-Rustam, which houses more tombs of Achaemenid emperors. Persepolis is located about one hour outside of Shiraz and easily accessible by taxi.\n\nRead more about traveling to Persepolis in this post!\n\nPasargadae\n\nAnother Achaemenid-era archeological site in the vicinity is the World Heritage site of Pasargadae, which used to be the capital of the empire under its founder Cyrus the Great and houses his tomb. To be very honest, I would recommend skipping this site as it’s 90 kilometers outside of Shiraz and offers little to see apart from the tomb. However, it’s included in some tours to Persepolis and you can add it to your private day trip excursion if you have the time.\n\nConclusion\n\nIran’s City of Gardens and Poets is one of the finest places the country has to offer and in my opinion, one of the most romantic cities in the world. It’s a must-visit place for any visitor to Iran and it’s impossible to get bored in this culturally rich city.\n\nHave you ever been to Shiraz? Share your experience in the comments below!"
