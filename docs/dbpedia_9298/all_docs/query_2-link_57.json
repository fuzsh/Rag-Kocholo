        "text": "Tell us about yourself, Gordon!\n\nHello! I’m Gordon Woodworth, a South Glens Falls native now living in an apple-treed meadow on the Schroon River in Bolton. I’m a writer, journalist, news hound and sports nut. I love to fish for largemouth bass and hunt down birdies on local golf courses. I’ve warmed up for Phish (singing O Canada before the 2005 America East men’s basketball championship game at the University of Vermont before Trey and the boys sang the National Anthem), been splashed with champagne in the winning locker room after Tampa Bay’s seventh-game Stanley Cup win in 2004, golfed with a presidential candidate (U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand), guzzled morning Budweisers with George Steinbrenner in the Saratoga Race Course press box, shadow-boxed with a teenaged Mike Tyson, sipped Hungarian espresso with Pete Gogolak, the soccer-style placekicker who revolutionized pro football, and beaten the odds more than once.\n\nOn Social Distancing\n\nDuring this pandemic, I’ve been embracing the quiet, chopping firewood, dodging porcupines, walking along the river, writing, posting on Facebook and enjoying the company of my amazing parents, who are staying with me until this blows over. I’ve also been helping a dear friend launch an exciting new business after a perfectly timed reconnection. Motivation has been a challenge at times, but having recently left my job as news editor of The Chronicle, I’m thoroughly enjoying the freedom from deadlines while I mull my next path! The silver linings are plentiful: Bald Eagles flying down the river steps from my living room picture window, nightly Scrabble games and frequent FaceTime chats with family and friends. Life, while different, has never been better.\n\nOn Life in Glens Falls\n\nI was born in Glens Falls Hospital and grew up in South Glens Falls. After college, I came home and then left again, working for 16 years at the University of Vermont. Then, in 2005, I returned. And I’m not leaving. My family is rooted in this community. My connections are deep. You’re stuck with me!\n\nThe best thing about Glens Falls is its people. Yes, the downtown is great, the arts scene is vibrant, the outdoor recreational possibilities endless. But it’s the people who make Glens Falls great. The spirit of compassion and kindness is genuine, and not restricted to the city limits. It’s all over the region. The South High Marathon Dance is a perfect example. It’s the premier fund-raising event in the region, and helps regular folks who need a hand up. That’s my kind of event.\n\nA Perfect Glens Falls Day (Post-Pandemic, of course)\n\nMy ideal day starts with an early-morning workout with my personal trainer Keith Irving at ADK Fit, followed by a Very Berry smoothie from my friends at the Juicin’ Jar and a large iced tea with lemon from Spot Coffee. Lunch could be a bowl of soup at Gourmet Cafe, a salad at the Bullpen, or a couple of hot dogs with no mustard from New Way Lunch. I also love Poopie’s, and Coach’s Corner in South Glens Falls. Dinner could be pizza at Talk of the Town, or something fabulous from Doc’s or Massie’s, followed by a Thunder hockey game and post-game frivolity at the Bullpen.\n\nOn the Past\n\nAs a kid, I loved billiards, and more than once found myself shooting pool with Charlie Kaulfuss and others at the old Empire Billiards Hall downstairs on South Street. My first grown-up movie was Saturday Night Fever in the balcony of the old Paramount Theater. And in 1978, in the midst of weekly chemotherapy for leukemia (43 years remission on May 9), my Mom and I went to Saratoga Race Course to see Affirmed and Alydar battle it out in the Travers.\n\n…and On the Future\n\nThe City continues to rebound, slowly but surely. Lately, it’s two steps forward, one step back. It’s a marathon, not a sprint. Downtown needs a good deli, a neighborhood store where you can get a sandwich, a quart of milk or a New York Times. A small grocery store would be great, but I think that’s still a few years off yet. Slow and steady wins the race.\n\nI love having a voice in the community, and am thrilled to join Tom and Bri Lyons at Glens Falls Living and their growing media company! Let’s do this!"
