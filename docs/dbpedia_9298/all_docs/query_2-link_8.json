        "text": "Gordon L. Guttrich, 84, of Rye, NH and formerly of Weston, MA, died on June 3, 2024 at Newport Hospital. He was the husband of Linda (Johnson) Guttrich. Born in Chicago, IL on November 23, 1939, He was the son of the late George and Edith (Smalzried) Guttrich.\n\nGordon grew up in the Chicago suburbs and at a young age it was apparent he had the intellectual ability to pursue any interest in life. He was always fascinated with automobiles, and was close to Detroit, but he decided to further his education and moved to Boston. At MIT he pursued physics and attained his Bachelors of Science and PhD. He soon met Linda Johnson and they married in 1967. They first lived in Chelmsford, MA and then for many years in Weston, MA where they raised their daughter. Dr. Guttrich spent the majority of his career at the Mitre Corporation as a physicist. He retired as a principal scientist after a 35-year career.\n\nIn his time outside of work, he cherished their daughter Julie and her accomplishments in school and in art. He was also a longtime member of the Scottish Rite of Freemasons, the Shriners, and the Lions Club. In retirement, Gordon enjoyed many years of beautiful ocean views and sounds of the sea. He continued to feed his endless capacity for learning with travel around the world alongside Linda, including several trips to England, other trips through Europe, and cruise destinations; each trip was a learning experience. At home, he enjoyed classical music, fine wines, literature and history.\n\nGordon is survived by his wife Linda, their son-in-law Irving Barrett of Newport, RI, his cousin Dennis Guttrich of Noblesville, IN, and Linda's family, Patricia Gove and Peter Johnson. Gordon is preceded in death by his daughter Julie Barrett.\n\nA graveside service will be held on Wednesday, June 12, 2024 at 11:00am at the Island Cemetery, Warner Street, Newport.\n\nDonations in his memory may be made to the Scottish Rite of Freemasons and Shriners Organizations."
