Born in Halifax he was a son of Charles John Irving, Thelma Constance (Boyd) Irving. Charlie spent most of his years working on the sea, first for the Coast Guard, later for the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. He had lots of adventures and could tell you about so many places he had visited. He was always a prankster and kept everyone on their toes. In his younger years he liked his cars and had fun with the Atlantic Sports Car Club. Not surprisingly, Charlie loved his boats for recreation in addition to work. He cruised and sailed them and eventually started building them. Charlie and Nora lived in Hackett's Cove for almost fifty years always close to the ocean. Above everything else was Charlie's love and dedication to Nora who he loved so much till the end. He is survived by his wife, Nora Mae Irving of 56 years; brothers, Gary Irving, Brian Irving, and Paul Irving; sisters, Maralyn DeRose, and Carol Brokken. He was predeceased by, William Gordon Irving, and Arthur Irving. Special thanks to the staff at Halifax Infirmary Unit 8.2."
