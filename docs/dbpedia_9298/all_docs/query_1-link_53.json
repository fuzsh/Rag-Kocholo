        "text": ",\n\nETAuto\n\nUpdated On Dec 19, 2018 at 11:55 AM IST\n\nRead by: 100 Industry Professionals\n\nRead by 100 Industry Professionals\n\nNEW DELHI: Irv Gordon, 78, who spent a maximum of his life in a single car, died on November 15th, 2018 while traveling in a remote, mountainous region of China for promotional work. He is believed to have died of heart attack just hours after messaging his daughter that he was “having one of the best times of his life.”\n\nIrv Gordon completed 48 lakhs Kms (3 million miles) in his Volvo P1800, this is exactly equivalent to 120 laps around the world. He is the first man in the world who holds the title for most miles driven by a single owner of a non-commercial vehicle in Guinness Book of World Records.\n\nAdvt\n\nIrv Gordon was born in July 1940 to Henry and Emma Gordon. He graduated from a Massachusetts college. He worked as a science teacher at Roslyn Middle School from 1962. During his teaching days, on the recommendations one of his friends, Gordon purchased the Volvo P1800 for $4,150 on June 30, 1966.\n\nVolvo P1800 was a 2+2 front-engine, a rear-drive sports car manufactured between 1961 and 1973.\n\nIn the first two days, he drove 1,500 miles. it was a holiday weekend – and brought the car back to the dealership the following Monday for its first service.\n\nHe continued adding to the odometer with his daily commute to Roslyn. In 1987, it became the fourth car to pass the million-mile mark.\n\nIrv Gordon’s daily schedule consisted of a 125-mile (200 Kms) commute to and fro from work. He would make sure that his car was duly serviced and he kept up with the maintenance work.\n\nGordon logged 500,000 miles (8 lakh Kms) in 10 years\n\n“If a car can have a soul, this car has a soul,” Gordon told Newsday in 2002, one of many media interviews.\n\nHe has conferred the record in 1998 for completing 1.69 million miles in his 1966-model Volvo P1800. He reached 2 million miles in Times Square in 2002 and 3 million miles in Alaska in 2013.\n\nOn 18 September 2013, million-miler Irv Gordon and his 1966 Volvo 1800S finally reached their phenomenal goal of hitting the 3 million miles mark – the same distance as 120 laps around the world.\n\nAdvt\n\nThe milestone was achieved near the village of Girdwood, on the Seward Highway, south of Anchorage in the state of Alaska; one of the two remaining states where Irv and his famous car had not been together until then.\n\nOn completing the feat, Irve Gordon said, “It was all rather undramatic. We just cruised along and I kept an eye on the odometer in order not to miss the great moment”.\n\n“But it has really not been about just getting to the three million miles; it’s more about the trips that got me to the three million miles and what I have experienced getting there,” Irv continued. “I never had a goal to get to one million, to two million. I just enjoyed driving and experiencing life through my Volvo.”\n\nBy ,\n\nETAuto\n\nJoin the community of 2M+ industry professionals\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter to get latest insights & analysis.\n\nDownload ETAuto App\n\nGet Realtime updates\n\nSave your favourite articles"
