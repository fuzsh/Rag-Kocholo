        "text": "Irving Gordon was one of the lyricists who worked for the agency of Irving Mills, who was Duke Ellingtonâs manager. He and Mills wrote the lyrics for two Ellington tunes, including âPrelude to a Kissâ (1938). Gordon is credited with several songs for which he wrote both words and music: âBe Anything (But Be Mine)â (1952), âSinner or Saintâ (1952) (both recorded by Sarah Vaughan), âWhat Will I Tell My Heartâ which was a hit for Bing Crosby in 1937, and âUnforgettable,â made famous by Nat âKingâ Cole in 1931.\n\nFrank Sinatra recorded his collaboration with Lee Lester, âChristmas Dreamingâ (1947), and âUnbelievableâ (1954), which he wrote with Jerry Livingston, became another Cole recording.\n\nGordon was born in Brooklyn, where he studied violin as a child. It was while he was working at a resort in the Catskills, writing parodies, that he began writing lyrics. Fortunately, he lived long enough to see the 1991 Unforgettable album of Coleâs daughter, Natalie, win multiple Grammys. The tribute album featured her singing with her fatherâs recorded version of the song.\n\n- Sandra Burlingame"
