        "text": "Gordon Irving...\n\n\"I have painted all my life and I have produced a large number of works over many years including portraits of rock icons, poets, playwrights, family and friends. I also paint surrealist works, still life, flowers and landscapes.\n\nMy easel is rarely empty and I work in various mediums including oils, acrylics, pastels, watercolour paints and watercolour pencils.\n\nI play acoustic guitar and sing and jam regularly with other singer/guitarists. I have an eclectic taste in music and a particular love for the music of the Beatles, the Stones, Bob Dylan, James Taylor, and Leonard Cohen.\n\nI attended Newcastle College of Arts & Technology and at the University of Glasgow as part of my Joint Honours Degree in Theology, I studied History of Art gaining merit of exemption from final exams and an invitation to do an Honours Degree in History of Art.\"\n\nBill Mann's introduction: I came across the work of Scottish artist Gordon Irving on social media. I was so impressed by Gordon Irving's artwork that I decided to contact him to ask if I could help publicise his work on this website. Gordon Irving agreed, and so please enjoy some examples of the fine work of Scottish artist Gordon Irving shown below. I will also include links to Gordon's Facebook page (at the foot of this page) where you can keep up to date with many more current works FOR SALE -\n\nThere is a 'Shop Now' button on Gordon's own page on Facebook - see below...\n\nPlease note that not all works shown here are for sale because some may be sold. Again, please refer to Gordon Irving's Facebook page (at the foot of this page) for updates.\n\nAll text and descriptions of artwork are by the artist Gordon Irving - ENJOY -\n\nHANG ON TO YOURSELF by Scottish artist Gordon Irving © 2019\n\nWatercolours & gouache on pastelmat card 30 x 40cm\n\nSOLD!!!\n\nMY LATEST PORTRAIT of a man of many faces and characters who never stopped reinventing himself. David Bowie was often called a rock 'n' roll chameleon, although rather than transforming himself to blend in, his flamboyant personas were consistently ahead of the curve.\n\nSome of his best loved characters include\n\nZiggy Stardust,Thin White Duke, Major Tom, Alladin Sane and Jareth the Goblin King. In my portrait I portray him pretty much as himself - David Robert Jones.\n\n‘If you think we're gonna make it\n\nYou better hang on to yourself.’\n\n(David Bowie)\n\n'THE BIG YIN' by Scottish artist Gordon Irving\n\nWatercolours and pastels on pastelmat card 30 x 40 cm\n\nFOR SALE - See Gordon Irving's page for details.\n\nBILLY Connolly was awarded an honorary degree from Strathclyde University at a ceremony at Barony Hall in Glasgow. He jokes that the only time he came close to university as a youngster was when he was delivering coal to the University of Glasgow.\n\nConnolly grew up in the Partick area of the city and worked in the Govan shipyards before pursuing a career as a folk singer in the Humblebums alongside the late Gerry Rafferty. Upon hearing the news he was to be knighted, the comedy icon quipped he'd prefer to be known as 'Sir Lancelot', because 'Sir Billy' didn't quite have the same ring to it.\n\n\"I'm the little boy who didn't do his homework,\" he remarked. Laughing, he added: \"I think if I had got a degree I would hate me - if I was sitting there having worked my bum off, to see this lout going up to get a degree for nothing. My wife has a PhD and she frowns on these. She doesn't really approve. It's nice, I like to take it in the mood it was given to me.\"\n\nThis portrait of Billy Connolly by Scottish artist Gordon Irving has attracted well over a thousand likes and many shares. Gordon, who formerly performed at Ayr Folk Club and clubs around Ayrshire, is an honours graduate of the University of Glasgow and also a graduate of Strathclyde University. He lives in Prestwick where he paints from his studio.\n\nMICHAEL MARRA\n\nby Scottish artist Gordon Irving\n\nLarge portrait 60 x 80 cm Acrylics on board\n\nI painted this large portrait about six years ago. My preferred medium at that time was acrylics, and I worked on a much larger scale then of 60 x 80 cm. For some time now I have painted on 30 x 40 cm - half that scale. I may now revisit acrylics and the larger scale.\n\nMichael Marra (1952 - 2012) was a Scottish singer-songwriter and musician from Dundee, Scotland. Known as the Bard of Dundee, Marra was a solo performer who toured the UK and performed in arts centres, theatres, folk clubs and village halls. Mike also starred in 'The Big Man' alongside Liam Neeson, Ian Bannen and Billy Connolly. He loved the poetry and songs of Robert Burns, Scotland's national bard."
