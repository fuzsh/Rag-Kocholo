        "text": "Biography\n\nIrving Gordon (14 February 1915, Brooklyn, N.Y. – 1 December 1996, Malibu, Calif.) was an American songwriter.\n\nIrving Gordon was born as Israel Goldener but later changed his name to Irving Gordon. As a child, he studied violin. In high school he wrote a symphony piece, but his teacher laughed at it. Gordon wanted to study at Juilliard but Jews were not admitted at that time.\n\nAfter attending public schools in New York City, Gordon worked in the Catskill Mountains at some of the resort hotels in the area. While working there, he took to writing parody lyrics to some of the popular songs of the day. In the 1930s, he took a job with the music publishing firm headed by talent agent Irving Mills, at first writing only lyrics, but subsequently writing music as well.\n\nAfter Gordon was introduced to Duke Ellington in 1937, Ellington sometimes invited him to put words to his compositions. However working with Ellington was probably one of the most difficult commissions there was, since most of the Ellington songs were really instrumental pieces whose singable potential only emerged after they had been played and recorded by one or another of the soloists in the Ellington orchestra. While working as Ellington's lyricist, Gordon wrote the words to Billy Strayhorn's piece Prelude to a Kiss.\n\nIrving Gordon is perhaps best known for his song, Unforgettable. He also wrote Allentown Jail, which was played by numerous musicians and told the story of a man who stole a diamond for his girlfriend. Late in his life, Gordon won a Grammy for Song of the Year when Natalie Cole re-recorded her father Nat \"King\" Cole's earlier hit of Unforgettable.\n\nAbbott and Costello often performed a baseball comedy routine, \"Who's on First?\" which they perfected during their years in vaudeville. Gordon has been credited with writing \"Who's on first?\" although others have also claimed authorship.\n\nWorks for Winds\n\nDelaware (arr. Scheffer)\n\nUnforgettable (arr. Mashima) (1951/2006)\n\nResources"
