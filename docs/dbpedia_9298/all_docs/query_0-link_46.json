        "text": "FAIRFIELD – Laurel Lynn Vigue, 71, a cherished and vibrant presence in our lives, passed away unexpectedly at her home in Fairfield on Aug. 3, 2024.\n\nLaurel was born in Island Falls in 1953 to Auril L. Hartin and Stella M. Hartin. Laurel’s life journey was marked by dedication, compassion, and a deep love for family and friends. Her early years laid the foundation for her remarkable career in nursing. After graduating from KVCC with a degree in nursing, she devoted over 30 years to caring for others at Oak Grove Nursing Home, Mount Saint Joseph’s, and several other local nursing facilities. It was during that time that she met many amazing people and forged lifelong friendships that she deeply cherished.\n\nIn her personal life, she was a beacon of joy and laughter, known for her tremendous sense of humor and a knack for making people smile. Her direct and sassy personality was a breath of fresh air, and she was adored by all who had the privilege of knowing her. Laurel’s heart was full of love for her family.\n\nShe was married to her beloved husband, Richard Vigue, for 27 wonderful years. Laurel had three children and three grandchildren who were her pride and joy. Her grandchildren especially brought her immense happiness, and she cherished every moment she spent with them. She actively expressed an interest in their daily lives, which she demonstrated with unwavering support and involvement, such as frequent attendance at their sporting events.\n\nOutside of her professional and family life, Laurel had a passion for reading and cooking. Her delicious pies were a staple at family gatherings and holiday dinners. She also had a special place in her heart for her two cats, Hootie and Stella, as well as her grandcats, Merle and Whitney.\n\nLaurel’s family and wide circle of friends will remember her as a dynamic, caring soul who brought light into their lives. Her legacy of love, laughter, and support will continue to inspire and comfort those who knew and loved her, and her absence will forever leave a profound void in our hearts and lives.\n\nLaurel was predeceased by her first husband, Charlie Weeks; both of her parents; a sister, Bonnie Dunphy; and her father-in-law, Donald Vigue.\n\nLaurel is survived by her husband, Richard Vigue; mother-in-law, Elverine Vigue; her two brothers, Sterling Hartin and his wife Lori, and George Hartin and his wife Hayley; her son, Christopher, and his wife Julie, her daughter, Stacy, and her husband Lance, her daughter, April, and her husband Keven; her grandchildren, Alexis, Zachary, and Ashley; and numerous cousins; nieces, nephews; great-nieces, and great-nephews.\n\nA memorial service will be held on Aug. 15, at 11:30 a.m. at Wheeler Funeral Home in Oakland, followed by a burial at Lewis Cemetery in Oakland and a reception at a location to be determined.\n\nArrangements are in the care of Wheeler Funeral Home, 26 Church St., Oakland, where memories of Laurel may be shared, and an online register book can be signed by visiting http://www.vrlfuneralhome.com.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Laurel’s name to the\n\nWaterville\n\nHumane Society,\n\n100 Webb Rd.,\n\nWaterville, ME 04901"
