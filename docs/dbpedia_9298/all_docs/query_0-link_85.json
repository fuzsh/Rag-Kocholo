        "text": "Rev. Irving W. Malm\n\nAugust 22, 1921 – July 30, 2021\n\nBorn on August 22, 1921, to Edward and Julia Malm in Burns Township, MN. Irving went to be with his Lord and Savior on Friday, July 30, 2021, in Omaha, NE. He was preceded in death by his parents; stepmother, Helen Malm; wife, Alice Mae Malm; brothers: Eldon Malm, Earl Malm, David Malm; sister, Rosabel Malchuck; daughter-in-law, Judy Malm; and son-in-law, Ashton Dixon. He is survived by sister, Ruby Greenberg; children: Judith (Peter) Johnson, Ruth Malm, Marilyn Malm, Rebecca (Ashton) Dixon, Gordon (Colleen) Malm, Kenneth (Ann) Malm; grandchildren; great-grandchildren.\n\nMEMORIAL SERVICE: Saturday, August 21st at 11am at Christ Community Church, 404 South 108th Ave., Omaha, NE 68154. VISITATION: Friday, August 20th, 5:30-8pm at Christ Community Church. Family suggests memorials to Global Friends Ministry.\n\nIrving was a beloved son, brother, father, and grandfather. He was a much-loved pastor in the Christian and Missionary Alliance serving in the ministry until semi-retiring at the age of 85. Irving continued to remain active in ministry until he was 99. He served a number of pastorates in Minnesota and Nebraska. Irving also served as District Superintendent in two Alliance Districts in Montana and Nebraska, and as a senior’s pastor at Christ Community Church.\n\nIrving was born to Edward and Julia Malm on August 22, 1921, in Burns Township, Minnesota. His family moved several times prior to his high school years including a time in Wadena, Minnesota. He would grow up along with three brothers and two sisters on a farm north of what is today Nowthen, Minnesota. Irving attended St. Francis High School graduating in 1938 and enrolled in St. Paul Bible Institute in St. Paul, Minnesota. It was there he met his future wife, Alice Mae Scanlan, and their friendship blossomed into romance while they both were preparing for ministry. Both Irving and Mae graduated with Bible and Theology Degrees in 1943 and were married in Oconto, Wisconsin on September 8, 1943.\n\nFollowing their wedding they began their first pastorate in Renville, Minnesota. Their first residence was equipped with a two-burner hot plate and no refrigerator. It was at Renville that their first daughter, Judy, was born. In 1944, they moved to take the pastorate at Burns Alliance Church in Burns Township, Minnesota, the church Irving had grown up in and which later became Nowthen Alliance. Daughters Ruth and Marilyn were born during their ministry at Burns Alliance. In 1950, they accepted a call to minister at the Northfield Alliance Church, Northfield, MN and it was there that daughter Becky and son Gordy were born. In 1956, they moved to Mt. Lake, Minnesota to minister at the Mt. Lake Alliance Church where their youngest son, Ken, was born. These years were filled with ministry, family activities, church camps and retreats, and vacation travels to Canada and the Black Hills.\n\nIn 1966, Irving was asked to lead the Rocky Mountain District of the Christian and Missionary Alliance. This was a newly formed district which covered five states and had a district office in Billings, Montana. Irving and Mae had served in church ministry and outreach so following much prayer he accepted this position. Irving served as District Superintendent with the many churches and Mae worked in the district office and served as president of Alliance Women in the district. He also began serving on the board of St. Paul Bible College. After completing three terms in that district a call was accepted to lead the Mid-America District of the Alliance consisting of five states including Nebraska, with the district office in Omaha, Nebraska. Irving ministered to and served with the churches of the district for three terms ending in 1985. From 1985 to 1988 they accepted a call to serve Fremont Alliance Church as an associate pastor ministering to senior adults. Irving, with Mae at his side, finished their official ministry at Christ Community Church serving from 1992 to 2007 as Senior Adults pastor."
