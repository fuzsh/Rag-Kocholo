        "text": "\"Living with Lauder\"\n\nA reprint of an article written in 1995, by Gordon Irving, for \"The Scots Magazine\"\n\n\"Come in, come in, we're glad to see you!\" The welcome is warm, heartening and with more than a hint of the late Andy Stewart's, \"White Heather Club\" signature song, John and Betty Lauder Hamilton, welcome me to their happy home, a short distance from the centre of Ayr. they're a couple with a difference. A twosome with a proud story to tell of Betty's great-uncle Harry. the one time miner of Portobello, who put Scottish song on billions of lips, and became one of the world's first mega-stars as he packed halls and theatres from New York to London, and toured with his own private train in North America. All right ... before we get carried away, let's deal with the ultra-critical sophisticates of the neurotic Nineties and remind them that Harry Lauder, was an honest ambassador for the Scotland of his day, a humble performer who has left a happy, healthy image of his homeland. His great-niece can provide the true picture of a man with simple tastes, a love of home life. a far from parochial outlook on the world, and with hundreds of good friends in towns and cities from Melbourne to Massachusetts. \"He was my great-uncle and I knew him - and loved him - when I was a little girl living with my family in Hamilton,\" says Betty, an outgoing lady with a love of life and people. She remembers with affection the great days of the 1940's when stars such as Danny Kaye, Bob Hope, Laurel and Hardy, and Johnny Ray, visited the legendary Lauder at his ain Strathaven fireside, looking out over the Lanarkshire countryside to Tinto Hill. \"I keep in touch with artistes who knew and admired Sir Harry Lauder. Deanna Durbin, now Madame Deanna David, wife of film producer, wirties to me from her home in a village south of Paris. She loved the Lauder songs.\" \"Lauder\" says Betty, had a \"wide, wide\" circle of friends, more of them international than Scottish. \"He was as friendly with Caruso and Chaplin as he was with those on the entertainment scene at home.\" Because I loved him so much, the criticism of him as a caricature Scotsman used to annoy me greatly. As I got older, though, I realized that those who denigrated him really didn't know the man they were talking about. They never saw him; they never heard him; and they've created a false picture. \"Their picture comes out of the criticism they've read. They say he caricatured Scotland, but every sensible person know that Harry Lauder, didn't do caricatures - he did character sketches. He belonged to his own generation. \"He never denigrated anyone, and if you look for a dirty joke or reference, it wasn't there. He was far too proud of Scotland to run it down. People overseas, and I meet many of them on my travels, admire him more than many Scots.\"\n\nBetty remembers girlhood days when evacuated as a 12 year old girl to the open spaces of Lauder Ha' outside Strathaven, she took daily walks with her great-uncle in the grounds of his country home. \"There was Uncle Harry, myself, and Bruce, the golden retriever. Uncle told me about the wildlife he loved. The open air was his delight after early days of working in the mines. \"I'd been evacuated from Hamilton to Lauder Ha' as soon as the first bomb fell. Uncle Harry said I could stay as long 'as I behaved myself for the rest of the war!\" I remember there was three cars. A Ford for fishing another was a Rolls-Royce* in which I played and use to speak to the Chauffeur; and the third was a Sunbeam for Aunt Greta, Sir Harry's secretary, touring manager and companion after Lady Lauder died. \"Aunt Greta was my mother's sister and, like her, the daughter of Sir Harry's brother Alick Lauder, himself a comedian, singer and a man with a phenomenal memory - better than Uncle Harry's. \"Irving Berlin, the famous songwriter, visited us when he played the Glasgow Empire with the musical show, \"This is the Army Mr. Jones\" On the day he came we hadn't planned for visitors, and we made do with homemade soup and Lightbody's pies. he went back to his hotel raving about the food. \"The pies\" he said \"were super\" \"We enjoyed the simple things at Lauder Ha'. High tea was a favourite, and mince and tatties were popular together with fresh salmon sent always as a gift from the first catch by the Provost of Coatbridge, and - in season - the succulent strawberries grown by John Sommerville, the gardner.\" \"The Lauders\", Betty says, were all great conversationalists round the dining-table. \"Gran use to keep order amid all the chatter. \"One at a time, she would say, but Uncle was a great listener, a quiet man like many professional comedians. He had confidence in his talent, but life had never been easy for him, and he showed his humility in the inscription he put on the stained glass window in the hall of his home \" This house is God's gift\" \"My first memory of eating with him was when I was two, and Uncle Harry took me with him to Glasgow when he was hosting a lunch party in the Central Hotel, then the great place for theatre stars and their associates to meet. \"During my school days at Hamilton Academy, Uncle Harry always came to see my Gilbert and Sullivan operatic performances, and he liked to look in on my progress in tap and ballet at Jack Muir's dancing displays in The Salon of Hamilton.\" \"Later, of course, we became regular theatregoers, and used to attend first-nights and gala shows at the Empire, Alhambra, the Pavillion and the King's in Glasgow, and the Gaiety in Ayr.\" \"What kind of music was listened to in the big mansion on the Lanarkshire moors? Scottish music mainly\" Betty recalls, \"Romantic ones too, as befitted a man who gave the world love songs such as \"I Love a Lassie' and Roamin' in the Gloamin'. I don't know if Uncle had a favourite, but he use to sing \"South of the Border\" as much as anythingwhen we went out in the car. he played records of all his favourites - Caruso, Chaliapin, Melba and Kreisler.\" \"He use to sit enthralled, listening to Bing Crosby or Paul Roberson, enjoying their innate sense of rhythm and melodious voices.\" An intriguing sidelight of the great Scot is that, after breakfast in bed, he used to practice snatches of his famous choruses with his old friend, the Lauder Ha' parrot, named of course, Polly.\n\nThe two way crooning went on around ten o'clock each morning as Harry got dressed in his kilt and home-knitted stockings. Yes, he did wear the kilt as everyday dress. \"All the time Polly, would join in huskily, bobbing up and down in her cage in Harry's adjoining sitting room. The climax would be a rousing rendering of Polly's favourite, 'Stop Yer Ticklin, Jock\", with the parrot's feathers puffed out in excitement. She used to dance stiffly from one scrawny leg to the other, giving vent to ear-splitting 'hoochs' \" recalls Betty. Polly, was a superb mimic, love to give a imitation of a very large cork popping from a whiskey bottle, and equally noise imitation 'glug-glug' as Sir Harry, poured out his nightly nine o'clock nip\" The star was near to tears on the morning his beloved Polly was found dead in the bottom of her cage. \"Aunt Greta and I buried her in our pet's cemetery beside the remains of Bruce the First, Sandy the Scotch terrier, and wee Roddy, the dear naughty brindle\" The dogs and budgie were replaced , but, after being with the family for 37 years, Polly was unique.\" Another sidelight on Lauder is that he loved to read books from his extensive library. \"We use to spend hours just browsing among much prized volumns collected on his travels , but always his favourite reading was the works of Robert Burns.\" The Lauder birthday was the 4th of August, he shared that date with the Queen Mother, born 30 years later - memorable for all who lived or looked in at Lauder Ha'. The spread of goodies was lavish, though Lauder's tastes were simple. Betty Hamilton explains \"When my grandfather, Sir Harry's elder brother, died, my gran was invited to make her home at Lauder Ha' with my great-uncle and his niece Greta. That is when my close ties began.\n\n\" Gran always cooked a dumpling, and we would screw up favours, including lucky sixpenses, in greasproof paper. Uncle tossed them into the mixture and gave the final stir while wishing his birthday wish. Aunt Greta supervised the cooking of the salmon, while baking delicious butterfly cakes. Strawberries, fat green peas, tomatoes and lettuce were picked and cleaned.\" The birthday cake arrived by special delivery each year from Lightbody of Hamilton. \"There was great excitement at these birthday celebrations. Bowls of flowers would be placed in every room, and at 530 precisly, the gong sounded, and the family filled the dining table, Uncle Harry at it's head. All the time the phone was ringing incessantly and the dogs and youngsters would scamper to see who would be sending greetings - maybe Schnozzle Durante, or Sophie Tucker, or Danny Kaye. \"The postman must have regarded 4th August as his day for a marathon cycle ride as he pedalled to and fro with gifts, cars and telegrams from near and far.\" Lauder use to send his niece Betty to the wee home bakery beside Bow-backit Brigh in Strathaven to bring his favourite potato-scones and crumpets. She remembers how, once, he went into town to get a haircut, forgot to take any money with him, and had to pop in to his good friend Tom Brownlie, the butcher, to borrow sixpence to pay at Fleming's the hairdresser. The Harry Lauder songs were often sung by the British Royal Family, and not least by a little girl who was to grow up to become Queen Elizabeth. Thereby hangs the story of the princess's favourite Scottish melody of that era, as Betty Lauder Hamilton, recalls. The secret was revealed after the entertainer paid a visit to Deeside on 22nd, August, 1931, and returned very much flattered by the young Princess Elizabeth, then just five. The Queen Mother, at that time Duchess of York, had led Harry to meet the Princess. \"Don't you know him?\" she asked. \"What record do you like best?\" \"It's Nice to Get Up in the Morning, But it;s Nicer to Lie In Your Bed\", she replied, not hesitating for a second. Lauder laughed, \"I see taht princesses are just like other folk,\" he said and promised to send her a special copy. Winston Churchill won a special place in Harry Lauder's own gallery of famous people he knew and admired. Sir Harry, took it as a supreme compliment when the war leader asked if he would travel form Strathaven to the Usher Hall in Edinburgh for his Freedom Award and sing, \"The Laddies Who Fought and Won.\" John and Betty Hamilton are regular visitors these days to North America, with close connections in Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and around Ontario, where so many Scots live.\n\nJohn, a businessman, but of Lanarkshire farming stock, has built a fine detailed minature of the Lauder Ha' mansion. Paintings of Sir Harry and his niece companion Greta, and other historic memorabilia, reflect family pride in a Scot remembered evern better across the Atlantic than in his homeland. The musical and theatrical traditions of Scotland will never die as long as John and his wife Betty Lauder Hamilton are happy to tell the world about the proud exminer from Portobello - and she is now the one person in the world who knows exactly what it is like, living with Lauder."
