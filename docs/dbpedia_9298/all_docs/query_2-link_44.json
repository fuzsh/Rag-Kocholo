        "text": "Born Irving Bartley Heard on October 27, 1933 in Shreveport, Louisiana. Entered continuation of journey on October 22, 2020 in Jefferson, Texas at age 86.\n\nSurvived by Beverly Faulkner, adored wife of 38 years, and best friend he ever had, sons Gene G. Heard, a medical doctor and John A. Heard both by previous marriage to Patricia Ann Hill Rooney of California. Also survived by granddaughters Sara Anderson and Heather Heard, great grandchildren Ian, Edith and Elliot Anderson.\n\nIrv was preceded in death by his father Irving Gordon Heard, mother Marguerite Lydia Conner and sister Marguerite Millicent Martin.\n\nIrv was a graduate of Fair Park High School and a veteran of the U.S. Navy and Marines having served as a Hospital Corpsman during the Korean War. Irv continued education in California before becoming a pharmaceutical salesman. In 1975 Irv became a realtor and eventually broker of his own firm. Irv later sold homes for a builder in the Central Valley of California where he earned new home sales agent of the year.\n\nIrv and wife Bev retired in Louisiana and later to Jefferson where they settled. Irvâ€™s interest in retirement were writing and publishing books of short stories, poetry, and crossword puzzles. Irv was a singer and musician playing piano, guitar, mandolin, and harmonica. Hobbies included coin collecting and acting as a juror in the production of the Diamond Bessie Murder Trial in Jefferson.\n\nSince childhood Irv always had loving little dogs as special companions. He is thrilled to join them again as he always knew where his happy go lucky life was going.\n\nMemorial services will be held at a later date."
