        "text": "John Velis\n\nRep. John Velis, D-Westfield, talks Oct. 15 at The Republican in Springfield.\n\n(Dan Warner/Masslive.com)\n\nBy Gintautas Dumcius and Shira Schoenberg\n\nThe Massachusetts House on Wednesday unanimously passed the Stolen Valor Act, a bill proposed by State Rep. John Velis, D-Westfield, that would make it a crime to fake military service for financial gain.\n\n\"We have in front of us a bill that would once again allow Massachusetts to lead from the front in protecting the valor of our veterans and service members,\" Velis said on the House floor, before the 149-0 vote.\n\nVelis' bill would make it a misdemeanor, punishable by a year in prison or a $1,000 fine, to wear a military uniform, awards or decorations that one has not earned, to use fake military identification, or to falsely claim to be a military member or veteran for purposes of financial gain.\n\nIf enacted, the bill would give Massachusetts one of the strongest Stolen Valor laws in the country, according to Velis, a captain in the U.S. Army Reserves. A federal Stolen Valor law and similar laws in other state make it illegal to falsely claim a military medal for financial gain, but the Massachusetts law would extend that to any claim of military services.\n\n\"Some people have asked, is this bill necessary? Do we need a separate law on the books dealing with this very type of fraud?\" Velis said. \"My answer to this, simply put, is a resounding yes, for the very fundamental reason that we need to pay the highest tribute of honor to those who sacrifice so that we can do what we're doing here today freely.\"\n\nThe bill is about \"protecting and maintaining the honor and integrity of the men and women who have sacrificed so much on our behalf,\" Velis said.\n\nVelis said passage of the bill is personal for him, since when he was deployed, three of his friends were killed in action and another had his leg blown off.\n\n\"Falsely representing military status for financial gain, committing this stolen valor, is a slap in the face to the service members, veterans and their families,\" he said.\n\nThe bill had bipartisan support. State Rep. Timothy Whelan, R-Brewster, who served as a U.S. Marine, spoke in favor of the legislation, noting that Veterans Day was approaching and calling it a \"gift to our veterans for their valiant service.\"\n\nThe bill now goes to the state Senate.\n\nSenate President Stan Rosenberg, D-Amherst, said he plans to speak to Sen. Michael Rush, D-West Roxbury, who chairs the Joint Committee on Veterans and Federal Affairs, to see if Rush has vetted the bill.\n\n\"I'm assuming he'd be behind it,\" Rosenberg said. \"We'll look for his advice and suggestions on how we move forward.\"\n\nRosenberg said while he is not sure about the timing of when the bill would come up, \"Based on what I've heard, it sounds like a bill that we need to get done.\"\n\nState Sen. Eric Lesser, D-Longmeadow, is co-sponsoring the bill and plans to push for it in the Senate. Lesser's father is a doctor in the Massachusetts Army National Guard, who served a tour in Iraq.\n\n\"As the son of a veteran and as the son of someone who's made great sacrifices to put the uniform on, it's both about protecting taxpayer dollars by making sure the benefits are going to the correct people, and also it's a point of honor,\" Lesser said. \"People who have made the sacrifice are the ones who should be receiving the recognition and no one else.\"\n\nIn a legislative session a week before Veterans Day, the House also passed by unanimous vote several other bills dealing with veterans' issues.\n\nOne bill would establish a fine for the unauthorized sale or attempted sale of grave markers. Although stealing a grave marker is already a crime, this would ensure that bronze markers that have been stolen cannot easily be sold. Another bill would require the court to make someone convicted of desecrating a gravestone pay restitution, in addition to any other penalties. This would apply to all gravestones, not only veterans'. Another bill would make it illegal to steal the American flag off a veteran's grave or the grave of a police officer or firefighter."
