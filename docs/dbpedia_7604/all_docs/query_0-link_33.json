        "text": "JUDY WOODRUFF:\n\nAnd to the Supreme Court, where the question today was, when does lying cross the line and become a crime?\n\nMargaret Warner has that story.\n\nMARGARET WARNER:\n\nNone of it was true. Alvarez was charged with violating the 2006 Stolen Valor Act, which makes it a crime to lie about having received a military decoration.\n\nAlvarez was fined and sentenced to probation and community service. He appealed, arguing the law violated the First Amendment. And the Ninth Circuit ruled in his favor.\n\nAlso today, in a case widely watched in the American West, the court ruled unanimously in favor of a Montana power company in a dispute over who owns the riverbeds of three Montana rivers. The justices threw out a state court order that the PPL Montana company pay the state some $50 million for using the riverbeds for hydroelectric plants and dams.\n\nFor more on both cases, we are joined by Marcia Coyle of The National Law Journal.\n\nAnd welcome back, Marcia Coyle.\n\nMARCIA COYLE:\n\nWell, lies are speech. The First Amendment protects speech, but it doesn't protect all lies.\n\nFor example, perjury, fraud, those are crimes. The First Amendment doesn't protect defamation and libel. There are some exceptions, but it doesn't protect them. But, in all cases in which the First Amendment doesn't protect a lie, it's because there's been a requirement that there be an intent to do harm or harm has occurred.\n\nThat brings us to the problem with the Stolen Valor Act.\n\nMARCIA COYLE:\n\nRight.\n\nThe federal law doesn't have a requirement of harm. So the arguments here focus really on two issues. The justices were very focused on, one, what harm is there from someone lying about having gotten a medal, and, two, if the government can make this type of lie a crime, where does the government's police powers stop? What other lies can it make a crime?\n\nThe justices peppered the government's chief lawyer, Don Verrilli, who is the solicitor general, with a number of hypotheticals. Chief Justice Roberts said, well, what about someone who lies about having a high school diploma? Congress could say we want people to finish high school, and so makes a law that makes it a crime to lie about that.\n\nOther justices said, what about lies about extramarital affairs? Mr. Verrilli stressed that this law is narrow, it's pointed. It requires a false — a knowing false statement of fact about the person himself or herself.\n\nHe also faced a series of questions about harm. Justice Sotomayor said, you know, is this law really getting at the fact that we are upset? There's an emotional reaction when someone lies about having received a medal. She said, I get upset when someone lies to me on a date, makes a claim about something that isn't true.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nMARCIA COYLE:\n\nBut what is the harm?\n\nAnd, again, Mr. Verrilli had to respond and say, even though it's not written in the law that there be harm, the harm is that there's been a misappropriation of the esteem that goes along with these awards. He said, very bluntly, the government's saying, when we give these awards, it's a big deal. Then, if the government stands by and lets some charlatan misappropriate that, that's harm, and it's harm to the courageous men and women who have earned these medals.\n\nMARCIA COYLE:\n\nIt's fascinating that title to the riverbeds in a number of states just has not been disputed in court for, in Montana's case, over 100 years.\n\nBut this actually came up because a group of parents of schoolchildren concerned about state funding of education brought a lawsuit raising, who should really be getting rent from, for example, PPL Montana, for using these riverbeds? Up to this point, the United States was getting the rent.\n\nSo the court had to deal with, how do you determine who has title? It has to be determined at the point of statehood for Montana. That's 1889. And the state gets title to the riverbed if the river is navigable. The Supreme Court today — it was a unanimous opinion by Justice Kennedy — said the Montana Supreme Court used the wrong test.\n\nJustice Kennedy said, you've got to look at the river segment by segment. These rivers had segments that were not navigable.\n\nMARCIA COYLE:\n\nThey're very concerned about a test like this that looks at a river segment by segment.\n\nThey have, literally, thousands of leases out for public uses of their rivers. And the concern now is, if you can take a segment away from state control, it can go to private control. They lose the lease money, and they're put in the awkward position of maybe having to negotiate with private owners."
