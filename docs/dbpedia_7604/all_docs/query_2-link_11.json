        "text": "Early Life\n\nAnne was born in 1591 in Lincolnshire, England. Her father, Francis Marbury, was a Puritan minister who insisted his daughter learn to read.\n\nIn 1578, Marbury was tried for heresy by the church after making repeated critical comments and was jailed for two years. He was again prosecuted for criticizing the church and was sentenced to three years house arrest the year Anne was born.\n\nAfter her father’s death, Anne married childhood friend and cloth merchant William Hutchinson in 1612 and began to work in Alford as a midwife and herbalist. Around the same period, Anne started teaching Bible sessions in her home with other women.\n\nThe Hutchinsons became followers of Puritan minister John Cotton, who preached that mercy is preordained by God, but damnation is determined by earthly behavior.\n\nAnne Hutchinson began to vigorously spread Cotton’s message to other women, with Cotton’s approval, since more women would often enter his congregation after following Anne’s persuasiveness.\n\nPuritans Flee Persecution\n\nThe ascent of King Charles I in 1626 led to the persecution of certain Protestant sects by the Anglican Church of England. Puritans fled in large numbers beginning in 1630: One of the first of these included John Winthrop, future governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.\n\nCotton was questioned by the Court of High Commission over concerns that his preaching about church reform was causing dissent. Cotton immediately went into hiding and fled to Boston in 1633.\n\nBelieving Massachusetts was in opposition to the king, British authorities closed borders and stopped emigrants from leaving under threat of prosecution.\n\nAt the age of 43 in 1634, Hutchinson and her family, which included 10 children, dodged British authorities and joined Cotton in Boston in 1634, following her revelation to do so while reading the Bible.\n\nA Popular Preacher\n\nHer husband rose to prominence in Boston, becoming a magistrate, while Anne Hutchinson joined with a group of women who worked as healers, treating illness and assisting in childbirth.\n\nCotton immediately worked to cement his power in the New World and engineered the congregational structure of church worship, with Hutchinson in his inner circle.\n\nIt was during her involvement with the healing group that Hutchinson developed the religious philosophy that became the focus of her American preaching. She believed that heaven was attainable to anyone who worshipped God directly, through a personal connection.\n\nHutchinson also preached that behavior, and therefore sin, did not affect whether someone went to heaven. These beliefs were in direct violation of Puritan doctrine.\n\nHutchinson expanded on her ideas in sermons and people flocked to listen to her, including men. By 1636, she was holding two meetings a week with as many as 80 people at each meeting, including Henry Vane, the governor of Massachusetts.\n\nHutchinson's Dangerous Ideas\n\nAfter a year of preaching, Hutchinson started to receive negative attention from the Puritan leadership who believed preaching was only for men and thought Hutchinson’s ideas were dangerous. They also felt that her stance against sin could promote dissension in the colony and encourage people to refuse to work and act against church and colony rules.\n\nThose who rose up in opposition to her were Governor John Winthrop and John Cotton, who feared Hutchinson was becoming a church separatist. Both sent female spies to her sermons.\n\nCotton gathered with other colony clergies to pass resolutions designed to end religious dissidence. One resolution specifically forbade meetings in Hutchinson’s home – but she ignored the order.\n\nWhy Was Anne Hutchinson Banished?\n\nIn 1637, Hutchinson—several months into a pregnancy—was called to appear before the General Court, with Winthrop presiding and Cotton testifying against her.\n\nA debate over the next two days saw Hutchinson performing well before the group of men when challenged on Biblical prowess, but her final argument sealed her fate. It was a lengthy statement of her philosophy and history, an account of speaking directly with God that concluded with a prophecy of the ruin of the court and the colony in retribution for their persecution of Hutchinson.\n\nThe men saw this as a challenge to their authority, and Hutchinson was proclaimed a heretic. She and her family were banished from the Massachusetts Bay Colony, and any supporters in positions of authority were removed. All supporters were forced to surrender their arms.\n\nHutchinson remained under house arrest until winter ended. In March 1638 the Hutchinson family, along with 30 other families, left for the island of Aquidneck in the Rhode Island territory at the suggestion of Roger Williams, where they founded Portsmouth.\n\nDemon Children\n\nThe men of the Massachusetts Bay Colony didn’t stop trying to harm Hutchinson’s reputation.\n\nAfter her pregnancy ended in June with the stillbirth of a severely deformed baby, rumors were spread that Hutchinson had given birth to a demon, spurred on by Winthrop. Cotton preached that the stillbirth was her punishment from God.\n\nThe defamation went beyond her own labor. One minister claimed Hutchinson had never delivered a normal baby as a midwife, that all were monsters. Governor Winthrop offered physical descriptions of many babies supposedly born to Anne’s followers as devil-like, clawed creatures.\n\nFinal Years\n\nAfter William’s death in 1642, ministers from Massachusetts were dispatched to force her to renounce her beliefs and coerce her into believing that Massachusetts would soon take over the Rhode Island territory.\n\nWishing to escape Massachusetts’ meddling, Hutchinson and her children moved to the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam (now New York), homesteading on Long Island Sound.\n\nOne afternoon in the summer of 1643, Hutchinson’s family was attacked by Native American Siwanoy warriors at their home. Fifteen people including Hutchinson were axed to death, their bodies burned.\n\nAmerican Jezebel\n\nHearing of Hutchinson’s death, John Winthrop, who had never stopped monitoring her movements, expressed that his prayers had been answered and that an instrument of the devil had been dealt with justly.\n\nEven after her death, he held a grudge against her and later wrote a hostile essay about Hutchinson, calling her “American Jezebel.”\n\nSusan Hutchinson\n\nAt the time of the attack, Hutchinson’s nine-year-old daughter Susan was picking berries and hid within the crevice of a large boulder known locally as Split Rock. According to local lore, she was later kidnapped by the Siwanoy tribe and adopted by the chief, Wampage, who renamed himself ‘Anne-Hoeck,’ in Anne Hutchinson’s honor.\n\nSusan remained with the Siwanoy for another nine years, eventually returning to Boston and marrying a settler there.\n\nHutchinson River Parkway\n\nIn memory of Anne Hutchinson and Wampage, a neighboring parcel of land was given the name “Anne-Hoeck’s Neck.”\n\nThe adjacent river was christened the Hutchinson River, later joined by a major New York City-area highway next to it called the Hutchinson River Parkway. A plaque honoring Anne Hutchinson was installed on Split Rock in 1911 but was soon stolen.\n\nSources"
