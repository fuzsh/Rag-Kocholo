        "text": "Stolen valor is essentially a lie. It involves falsely claiming military service, rank, recognition or even someone else’s identity.\n\nWhile it’s not technically illegal to just “make things up” — for example, to impress friends at a party — stolen valor is more complicated than that, which is why it is considered a crime. (So is military impersonation, a similar offense committed willfully, wrongfully and with or without intent to defraud.)\n\nWhat makes stolen valor so complex? One example is nuance. In some cases, a service member may have received the wrong authorization and could be unknowingly wearing a medal or other decorations inappropriately, or, they may intentionally embellish their military career, such as when seeking election to a government office.\n\nThat’s right: Even active service members can commit an act of stolen valor. These acts are covered under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), while veterans and civilians answer to civilian federal law.\n\nThe Stolen Valor Act is a series of attempts to clarify these issues, balancing military service protections with free speech rules. Here’s a look at the legislative history:\n\nThis legislation made it a misdemeanor to lie about earning any kind of military medal or honor. These lies included wearing, manufacturing and selling any medal without legal authorization.\n\nThe reasoning was clear: “Fraudulent claims surrounding the receipt of [military honors] damage the reputation and meaning of such decorations and medals.” Penalties included fines and imprisonment.\n\nHowever, the legislation didn’t last long. In the United States vs. Alvarez, one of multiple stolen valor cases, state official Xavier Alvarez’s legal team argued that these rules infringed upon the First Amendment protection of free speech. In 2012, the Supreme Court declared the legislation unconstitutional.\n\nMilitary duties are rigorous and highly regulated, as any service member should know. You’d probably be able to list the specifics of your responsibilities even decades after active service. That’s why it’s often suspicious when someone has an incomplete or incorrect understanding of military duties — whether the tasks they supposedly completed or the functions of the military overall.\n\nIf you suspect someone could be committing an act of stolen valor, ask yourself this: Does it sound like they learned everything they know by watching war movies? This kind of surface-level or even flat-out wrong understanding of the military is often a giveaway that you’re not hearing the truth.\n\nOf course, if someone is truly dedicated to such lies, they may have done in-depth research. That means this red flag isn’t always applicable, and you may need to look elsewhere for signs of deception.\n\nThese days, it’s easy to look up details about particular deployments or military operations — but someone who’s falsifying their experiences won’t have the specifics. They might be purposefully vague, avoiding in-depth discussions and changing the subject, or they might make things up to fill in the gaps. While a civilian may not notice inconsistencies in such a story, service members and their families will likely be the first to suspect that something isn’t right.\n\nThis is particularly true if the person mentions a particular deployment location and date. Do other service members’ recollections line up? There’s always a chance that someone has simply forgotten a detail or had a different perspective and experience — but in general, everyone’s stories should be similar.\n\nThere are a few ways to break down someone’s language if you suspect stolen valor.\n\nFirst, consider whether they “talk like a service member.” Do they use the right terminology in the right places? Do they treat certain topics, responsibilities and fellow service members with respect? Do they speak about their experiences with familiarity? Everyone’s experiences are different, so it can be difficult to know for sure — but trust your gut on this one.\n\nIt can also be helpful to remember the context of stolen valor as a legal term. If you were to hypothetically charge someone with this crime, they would have to be getting some kind of tangible benefit from their fraudulent claim. That means they might weave certain kinds of language into their speech or writing.\n\nAre they trying to get something from you or others? Do they sound like they’re persuading you logically, emotionally or ethically? Can you link anything they’re saying or doing to a money-making opportunity, such as seeking election to a government office? You decide."
