        "text": "Travis Kelce blabbed on his weekly podcast that it was HIS idea to join girlfriend Taylor Swift onstage during one of her recent European concerts, but we just heard what he DIDN’T reveal. Travis also came up with the idea of appearing in one of Taylor’s upcoming music videos for her latest album and my source says that some of it has already been filmed. Unlike most of Taylor’s last lovers (who’ve preferred to keep things on the down low) Travis loves the spotlight and enjoys having their romance out in the open.\n\nJulia Roberts and her husband Danny Moder celebrated their 22nd wedding anniversary on July 4 with an Instagram post but I’m hearing that the couple ( who many predicted wouldn’t last) also have a secret Independence Day tradition where they renew their wedding vows to one another in private. The notoriously private couple stunned their friends and family 22 years ago when they got married during a July 4 celebration and Julia confided to a pal that they’ve repeated their wedding vow tradition almost every year (a few times they were apart working so they did it on a different date).\n\nDesperate to save his faltering presidential campaign, Joe Biden is on an interview tour as we exclusively reported. Now we are hearing that in addition to the tour, Biden is prepared to take a cognitive test and release the results regardless of how they turn out. My political source says that at this point the president is willing to try almost anything to prove to the American people that he’s capable of being president and not mentally challenged.\n\nOn the other hand we are also hearing that his presumptive Republican challenger Donald Trump is TERRIFIED that Biden will be replaced and he’ll have to run against someone younger. My source says that Donald thoroughly enjoys painting Biden as old and feeble, but he’s worried he will be the one looking frail against a younger Democratic candidate. Get this: He’s even started using his wife Melania’s skin serum and emulsion that she orders from a top plastic surgeon every month. Donald is suddenly taking his appearance seriously. In addition to the fancy potions he’s also updating his wardrobe in hopes of appearing younger than 78!\n\nFinally, Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck made headlines for spending the holiday weekend on different coasts, but still wearing their wedding rings! For a couple seemingly on the verge of divorce, it’s odd that their rings are back on. Here’s what we know. Their marriage is rife with problems, including their different lifestyles (she loves the limelight and loves to live large, while he’s private and parsimonious). The only things they seem to have in common is incredible sexual chemistry and a true love and respect for one another. So for now, they’re not throwing in the towel, but are hoping to work out some sort of arrangement to stay married but live apart. As for the rings, we heard it was a calculated move to show the public they’re still working on their union.\n\nPHOTO: New Heights podcast\n\nEmma Roberts made headlines when she remarked that Hollywood women are far more often called out as “nepo babies” than Hollywood men, while appearing on the podcast Table for Two. She pointed out George Clooney as the ultimate nepo baby. Emma had a valid point: although George is talented, his aunt was the iconic Rosemary Clooney which opened doors for him in Hollywood. Although she sort of backtracked her comments, Emma’s aunt, who just happens to also be one of George’s best friends, Julia Roberts, was miffed over the incident. Our source told us that hours after the podcast became news, Julia got on the phone to Emma and gave her quite the earful. We can reveal that Emma, at Julia’s urging, reached out to George and apologized for bringing his name up. Even though Julia was upset, good-natured George just laughed it off.\n\nAlec Baldwin made the news again for all the wrong reasons. This week his attorneys asked the New Mexico judge to dismiss the case against him over firearm evidence. The long shot move is unlikely to fly and here’s what we know. Behind very closed doors Alec’s legal eagles are trying to negotiate a plea deal which will allow him to serve any time in house arrest, pay a substantial fine, and work on legislation banning REAL guns on movie sets. Nothing has been agreed to as of yet, but secret negotiations continue.\n\nEstranged lovebirds Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez created some buzz when they were spotted in the same Beverly Hills office building. Although they arrived and left separately we are hearing that the “meeting” was actually part of a therapy session. Ben arrived first and had an individual session, and then later in the day J.Lo arrived to join him for a joint couples session. Their future together seems to change by the moment, but they want to make sure they give their marriage every chance to survive.\n\nMiranda Lambert’s handsome hubby, former NYC cop Brendan McLoughlin made news and she ain’t happy about it. Brendan was seen getting chummy with other females that weren’t his wife, and he did it at the Nashville bar, Casa Rosa, that Miranda’s OWNS! While Brendan claimed he was just being a good host (he occasionally works there) we are hearing that Miranda was nonetheless irked at his misstep, and put him on notice that he won’t be hanging out in her bar, or any other bar for that matter, unless she’s WITH him!\n\nFinally to end the week on an uplifting note, Selma Blair was spotted all over Paris this week looking great during the countless fashion shows. We know this. Selma’s trip wasn’t all pleasure. The brave MS sufferer also spent a great deal of time meeting with designers to encourage them to include canes in their accessories. Selma relies on a cane to help her with stability issues caused by the MS and she’s made no secret that it’s hard to find anything stylish. As my source puts it, Selma wants to make canes more attractive and fashionable.\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA\n\nCeline Dion made headlines with her sit down interview with NBC’s Hoda Kotb where she revealed intimate and painful details about her battle with Stiff Person Syndrome. Here’s what we know. The interview was Celine’s way of testing the water to see the public interest and reaction and it was SO positive that she’s forging ahead with plans to star in a reality show. The details are still being worked out, but it’s likely to appear on Bravo.\n\nWe continue to get updates on Leah Remini’s attempt to sell her Studio City, California home. After a number sales fell out of escrow, we are happy to share that Leah finally accepted a close-to-asking offer on her property. The buyers seemingly don’t have any connection to Scientology, so Leah is confident that this time the sale will go through.\n\nKourtney Kardashian and Travis Barker’s baby storyline was featured in this week’s episode of their Hulu series, The Kardashians. Here’s a tidbit you won’t see on the show. After a difficult pregnancy with their infant son, Rocky, Travis and Kourtney are secretly turning to surrogacy in hopes of having a daughter. It’s hush hush, but my source says the second baby could already be on the way!\n\nDonald Trump continues to make headlines- most recently because a producer on his former show, The Apprentice, revealed that during season one, Donald dropped the N-word about finalist, Kwame Jackson. Here’s what I just heard… there’s top secret speculation that the incident was caught on tape, but the only way it could be released is if there was a legal court order. This is where it gets juicy – behind closed doors some are encouraging Kwame to SUE for discrimination, and if the tape is located, a judge could decide whether or not to make it public.\n\nJennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck’s marital status continues to dominate the news cycle. One minute they’re wearing their wedding rings, and the next they’re not. In addition to our previous updates we just heard this: Jennifer’s mom, Guadalupe Rodriguez, is acting as Jennifer’s marriage counselor and SHE was the one who persuaded J.Lo to cancel her summer tour to focus on her marriage. Guadalupe and Ben share a special connection (they bonded over their love of gambling!) so even when Jen isn’t around Guadalupe and Ben have been spending time together. As my source puts it, if anyone can save this marriage it’s Guadalupe.\n\nPHOTO: NBC Today\n\nIf Diddy thinks his public apology indirectly addressed to his former girlfriend Cassie is going to be enough to resolve his problems, he’s sorely mistaken. While the statute of limitations has expired on that case, here’s what we know: The FBI has been canvassing across the nation contacting people who might have been secretly filmed in compromising positions at one of Diddy’s parties. They’re leaving cards outside of residences when they can’t make contact, and have over 1000 people as potential victims!\n\nJennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck continue to dominate the headlines as speculation about the current state of their marriage continues. Although we updated you last week, here’s the latest. The couple recently spent a night together at their Beverly Hills home after Ben snuck in to avoid the paparazzi. My source insists the couple are working through this rough spot and actually might wind up living in separate residences but staying married as a way to make their relationship work. It seems they work better when they’re not cohabitating.\n\nDonald Trump’s criminal trial is now in the hands of the jury and here’s the latest. Donald did his best to convince his wife Melania to make even a brief appearance at the trial, with my source saying he offered her a pile of cash. (remember this is a TRANSACTIONAL relationship and not a true love story) Despite the lucrative offer, Melania refused to attend the trial, but we are hearing she might join Donald when the verdict is announced if the offer is tempting enough.\n\nGraceland was almost foreclosed on and now the FBI is involved in the case, as some hanky panky is suspected. We are hearing that members of the Elvis Presley dynasty suspect that Scientology was somehow involved in the plot to take over the iconic tourist attraction. Remember, Lisa Marie Presley distanced herself from the controversial group. While this is just hearsay, my source says that is one of the angles being currently looked into.\n\nFinally, Kim Kardashian made headlines when she met with Gypsy Rose Blanchard to discuss prison reform – but we just heard that’s only half of the story. As we previously reported, Gypsy wants to pursue a career in Hollywood and now Kim’s mom and momager, Kris Jenner, wants to manage Gypsy’s blossoming career. Our source says a reality show is in the works and Kim and Kris are producing.\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA\n\nHi Readers,\n\nWe are going to try something new. As a one-woman operation, writing this website is a time-consuming task. We hear a lot of great gossip but don’t have the staff and resources of other websites like TMZ, so they occasionally break the story first. That doesn’t mean we don’t have some exclusive details, so we are going to call this weekly feature, HERE’S WHAT WE KNOW. As the title implies, we will update you on what we know about items you might read elsewhere. Just because we didn’t write it first, doesn’t mean we don’t have some good tea to share! So here we go:\n\nEveryone is talking about Tish Cyrus stealing her husband Dominic (Prison Break) Purcell from her daughter, Noah. Here’s what we know… Noah WAS casually dating Dominic before Tish hooked up with him, but the gals were already estranged before the betrayal. Noah and her mom Tish have been on the outs over Billy Ray Cyrus. Noah is a daddy’s girl and took his side when Tish finally pulled the plug on the marriage. On the other hand, Noah’s big sister Miley sided with her mom, and is now estranged from Billy Ray…\n\nKayne West is back to posting direct pleas to his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian on social media. His latest one urged her to take their kids out of what he calls “system school” (which some took to be leaning into antisemitism.) We DO know that Kim called a meeting with lawyers since the social media post apparently violated their custody agreement by naming the school where the kids are enrolled. Huge safety concern for Kim – so she’s using this an ammunition to get full custody. We will keep you posted.\n\nFinally, Stephen Baldwin raised concerns about the state of his daughter Hailey’s marriage to Justin Bieber when he asked fans and his social media followers to pray for the couple. Here’s what we know: We already told you the marriage was in trouble and that the couple were in therapy and spending time apart. This time we beat the other websites in revealing this, so we will say it again, WE TOLD YA SO!\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA Tish Cyrus and Dominic Purcell"
