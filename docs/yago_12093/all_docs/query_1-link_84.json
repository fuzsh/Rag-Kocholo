        "text": "DESCRIPTION:\n\n(from ABC's press release) In America, we rank motherhood as holy as baseball and apple pie, but in reality, the only people who understand how tough a job it is are mothers. Caregiver, chauffeur, cook, tutor, therapist, cheerleader... it's a one-woman service industry that consumes a whole life. Though her kids are all grown up, Sally's decided it's never too late to find yourself. Divorcing her cheating husband, Sally moves to a small apartment to begin the business of independence, but unfortunately, life has passed her by. A complete lack of computer skills might keep some people from applying for a job at a web design firm, but her mothering instincts get her hired. Score one for the vintage woman! There are still plenty of obstacles to overcome – from paying bills, to home security, to reentering the dating scene – but Sally will attack them all with the same confidence that allowed her to start fresh. Well, maybe she'll have her grown son sleep over a few more nights, just to be on the safe side. A writer from The Drew Carey Show creates a woman with incredible nerve in a comedy of second chances. 50 really is the new 30 because there's still a lot of living left to do."
