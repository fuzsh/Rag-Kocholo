        "text": "THE choice of Elisabeth Filarski Hasselbeck as the new co-host of “The View” yesterday gives the show “a new charge” in its seventh season, says co-creator/co-host Barbara Walters.\n\n“She’s 26 and isn’t afraid of giving her point-of-view,” says Walters. “We were looking for someone to give us that new charge.\n\n“And these women don’t mind the [younger] competition,” she said of her co-hosts. “Elisabeth is not afraid of attacking all of us. She feel differently about political and social issues.”\n\nHasselbeck, best known for her spunkiness as a final-four contestant on “Survivor: The Australian Outback,” bested Erin Hershey Presley and Rachel Campos to snare the coveted co-host’s chair opposite Walters, Joy Behar, Star Jones and Meredith Vieira on the ABC morning show.\n\nHasselbeck is married to Washington Redskins quarterback Tim Hasselbeck and wants to start a family – both pluses in the universe of “The View,” which was admittedly looking for a young-mother type in its search to replace Lisa Ling.\n\nBut, perhaps more importantly, Hasselbeck brings a conservative viewpoint to a show that’s often perceived to be liberal.\n\n“Things are going to get hot at the table and it’s great that we’re going into a political year with Elisabeth joining the show,” said Vieira.\n\n“She’s somewhat more conservative than the rest of us, although I’m an independent – I really swing both ways. But we’ve been perceived as having a liberal bent to the show. She’s someone who’s coming in as pro-Bush and I think that’s great,” Vieira said. “I’m not sure any of us are impressed by any of the presidential candidates – and I think she’ll make it very interesting.”\n\n“I’m into it when there’s conflict on a talk show – I watch ‘Crossfire’ – but it can’t be mean,” said Behar. “Plus, Elisabeth is young – and [the network] likes to get that younger audience.”\n\nHasselbeck said that she didn’t “play anything up,” including her political views, during her one-week tryout (the week of Nov. 17).\n\n“I do have conservative views, but I hope to be the one to bring a different feel to the show,” she said.\n\nWalters announced Hasselbeck as the new co-host at the top of yesterday’s show, noting that “The View” had received over 2,000 tapes from co-host wannabes looking to replace Ling, who left last December.\n\n“The three final contenders [Hasselbeck, Hershey and Campos] were far and away, the three most popular with our viewers,” said “View” co-executive producer Bill Geddie. “Our audience weighed in very heavily.”\n\nEveryone connected with the show cited the “chemistry” between Hasselbeck and the four co-hosts as the overriding factor in choosing her to join the show.\n\n“There was something about Elisabeth and her chemistry with us – we felt it right away,” said Vieira. “And then it was something of a no-brainer.”\n\n“We don’t all want to mesh together,” Jones said. “And Elisabeth fills that void.”"
