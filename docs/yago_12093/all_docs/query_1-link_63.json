Although Alison Barrington predominately starred on “PC,” the character appeared on “GH” in the early 2000′s during scenes airing on the parent series surrounding the annual Nurse’s Ball charity event, which is ironically set to return to the “GH” in the weeks and months to come.\n\nAccording to the ABC Hot Sheet sent out the thousands of fans for next weeks episodes (week of January 28 – February 1, 2013), and posted on the ABC.com website, Alison joins Lucy in her belief that John McBain (Michael Easton) is in actuality Caleb, only to find herself at a crossroads of danger by weeks end. But will John be the one paying the ultimate price? To find out what happens, tune in to “General Hospital.”\n\n__________________\n\nEJami powerful, tangible, wild & completely off the charts Choice, not chance, determined destiny.

I can't wait to see her and Lucy talk to each other and find out what is going on. I posted this in the GH thread. BUT it belongs here and her bio on imdb doesn't state all the kids names or genders only that her first born is a boy and they named him JACK. awwwwwww\n\nQuote:\n\nJPIPopular PORT CHARLES alumna Erin Hershey Presley reprises the role of Alison today on GENERAL HOSPITAL as the mystery surrounding Lucy's (Lynn Herring) vampire warnings deepens. Enthuses Lynn Herring, \"It was so wonderful to see her, so much fun catching up. I hadn't seen her socially since before she had her first baby! She's an absolute doll.\"\n\n__________________\n\nEJami powerful, tangible, wild & completely off the charts Choice, not chance, determined destiny.

Guess its no wonder they could keep it under wraps. She was hardly on and probably taped her scenes real quick in one day.\n\nI always wanted EHP on GH after PC was canceled. My heart broke today as well. I was teased. All in 6 hours, since I didn't see Wednesdays episode till this morning. (We had weather interruptions).\n\n__________________\n\nYou're here for a good time, not a long time. ~ Colin McRae\n\n- Mel\n\nAvatar by Carla\n\nObsessed Fan\n\nJoined: Mar 2001\n\nPosts: 5,084\n\nI 've missed Erin too and even a few years back when I started to watch Days I even campaigned a bit for them to find her and hire her unfortunately it didn't happen.\n\nHopefully we will get some flashbacks. Some memories from her son's eyes and maybe even Lucy's. It was wonderful to hear Kevin at least mention that he remembered Rafe was Lucy's cousin and that Alison was married to him.\n\n__________________\n\nEJami powerful, tangible, wild & completely off the charts Choice, not chance, determined destiny.

Just because her grandmother was on the show.\n\nIf not I thought she would play someone else. Perhaps a Courtney recast instead of killing her off. (She was Sonny's sister)\n\nI'm hoping for flashbacks. That would be awesome.\n\nI'm confused that Alison's son was named Rafe. What happened to Angel Rafe I wonder? Love that Rafe Jr was talking to Molly....wonder where they are going with that?\n\nKevin...I wonder if he know more then he is letting on?\n\n__________________\n\nYou're here for a good time, not a long time. ~ Colin McRae\n\n- Mel\n\nAvatar by Carla\n\nObsessed Fan\n\nJoined: Mar 2001\n\nPosts: 5,084\n\nThrottle. not sure if you will watch GH today... I will look for your post to see what you think??\n\nI think Erin didn't go to GH because she was trying for other things. She wanted primetime, movies SHE WANTED THE VIEW CO HOST SEAT!!!\n\nI will say I was only barely paying attention but if what i heard ?? and yet the ending when Lucy is praying and saying Angel Rafe???? I don't know.....just just just\n\nif what i heard was correct\n\nI am DONE. DONE WITH GH for a while ....they screwed me over today .......and I don't even want to think about it.\n\n__________________\n\nEJami powerful, tangible, wild & completely off the charts Choice, not chance, determined destiny.

I think she said that Rafe went after Caleb only for them never both to be ever heard from again. SO MAYBE the show didn't totally besmirch RALI's legacy. I heard her say that after Rafe noticed that the child couldn't be his and Ali's he left her and -that to me wasn't the Rafe of love story RALI that I loved and watched for years. He gave up heaven for Ali and knowing the baby wasn't his but still a part of her -NO, Rafe wouldn't have left her again, not after the last time.\n\n__________________\n\nEJami powerful, tangible, wild & completely off the charts Choice, not chance, determined destiny.
