        "text": "BIRTHDAY GAL: Actress Erin Hershey Presley was born in Seattle on this date in 1976. This birthday gal is probably best known for portraying Alison Barrington on the soap opera “Port Charles” from 2000-03. She also portrayed the same character on the soap “General Hospital” briefly in 2000. She’s appeared in the movies “Americanizing Shelley” and “Marsha Potter Gets a Life.” Presley is married to former “Port Charles” co-star Brian Presley.\n\nARIES (March 21-April 19): “Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me” won’t be true if you spread gossip and tell lies.\n\nTAURUS (April 20-May 20): You might make a good mediator if, and when, trouble erupts. But it is still wise to avoid situations that require you to take sides.\n\nGEMINI (May 21-June 20): Instead of knocking a chip off someone’s shoulder, give that person a pat on the back instead. It is easy to give the wrong impression.\n\nCANCER (June 21-July 22): Defensive postures invite hostility. Instead of viewing opposition as a conflict, look at it as a challenge to be handled with care.\n\nLEO (July 23-Aug. 22): It is an action-oriented day, so resting on your laurels won’t win brownie points. You need to show that you can handle jobs expediently.\n\nVIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Don’t let enthusiasms run away with you. Your creative genius might not be appreciated under these celestial conditions.\n\nLIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): Your sweet ways could hit be overcome by a sour note. Someone could be determined to win at all costs and turn the tables on you.\n\nSCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): When rams fight they charge into each other, causing a head-on collision. Avoid conflicts by remaining on your own turf.\n\nSAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): A cool head prevails no matter how hot people get. Tempers could flare under these stars and disrupt communications.\n\nCAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Someone could throw weight around, but you don’t have to react or engage in one-upmanship. Patience is a valuable trait.\n\nAQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): True wisdom consists of knowing how to make a point without making an enemy. Your desires could conflict with those of others.\n\nPISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): If executive action is necessary remember that choosing to wait on a final decision is also an action. Don’t rush projects.\n\nIF SEPTEMBER 2 IS YOUR BIRTHDAY: The year ahead offers you ample opportunity to improve your overall well-being and secure your future. People consider you to be trustworthy so are more likely to give you positions of trust between now and January, making this a fine time to go after a new job or obtain a romantic commitment from an important person. Look for myriad blessings in February and the first week of March when important doors can open that lead to long-term prosperity. Don’t be too full of yourself in late March or April when you could set off on a wild goose chase or develop unrealistic plans.\n\nText your zodiac sign (e.g. Gemini) to 484848 to start your daily horoscope alerts subscription! $4.99/mo.
