        "text": "Sonny & Carly & Angel #9 April 24 - July 12, 2001 - 8 hrs\n\nTamara arrives as Carly on the beginning of this edit, and Angel arrives early into this one as well. Carly betrays Sonny to the FBI, the betrayal love making, Sorel stabs Sonny at the cemetery, Angel takes Sonny to her Lake house. Sorel kidnaps Carly, then Alexis. This is an 8 hr original edit done from my original episodes. I included all of Sonny's scenes during this time frame and in order to follow the storyline I included all of Carly's scenes, and all of Angel's scenes (though I believe her scenes were all with either Sonny or Carly). Click here to read the full edit description.\n\nSonny & Carly #10 July 12 - August 29, 2001: 8 hr original edit\n\nI did continue to include all of Sonny's scenes in this edit. In order to follow the story all of Carlys scenes and all of Angels scenes are also included, and of course all of Sonny's scenes with Alexis are also on here. I know fans are split on the issue of what scenes to include, some would prefer a Sonny only edit but you will always find that I tend to edit to a storyline not just an actor. I find edits that only include one actor's scenes are usually pretty chopped up and it makes it difficult to follow a storyline.\n\nThis edit includes the scenes of Sonny wearing the bomb, the explosion and aftermath, Sorel's death. I included all of the aftermath in the penthouse, and much of the buildup around Sorel's death- to show different character's motives to kill him.

By this time in November, their storylines became more separate so it did become a difficult decision as to whether to continue to include all of each of their scenes. There is no right or wrong way to edit but there are many different options. I had taken a poll from my S&C email list and there was a slight majority that asked me to continue to include all of Sonny and all of Carly's scenes. Of course there was another group who asked me to please not include Sonny's scenes with Alexis but wanted everything else. Then there was another group who wanted all Sonny scenes (but not all of Carly with Zander and Jax), then others who wanted all of Carly but again no Sonny with Alexis. So I knew whatever option I chose wasn't going to work for everyone. I decided to continue editing all of Carly and all of Sonnys scenes to follow each of their storylines. This way those who want the whole storyline can access it, those who want all of Sonny will have it, and those who want all of Carly will have it (you can always ff through what you don't want to see). For those who really only want S&C together, I have never done that type of editing for their storyline.\n\nI think it is important for long term storyline preservation to see Carly's development, her plans to open the club, her friendship with Jax, the relationship with Zander especially since often they talk about Sonny. There is a lot of Sonny & Alexis together, and I really seriously debated not including the PR scenes but just couldn't leave out a section of Sonny's story line as then the collection would not be complete.\n\nThe first hour or so are the final scenes between S&C as they decide to divorce and Sonny signs the papers. Then Sonny heads to PR, and Carly is off making arrangements for her club and many of her scenes are with Jax. So for the next couple of hours they don't interact at all. Then Sonny & Alexis return from PR, and Courtney arrives and that is the majority of Sonny's storyline on this edit, includes his interaction with Janine, Mike, Courtney around her arrival. This edit also includes Christmas (there is a sweet moment as S&C celebrate Christmas morning with Michael), New year's eve, Roscoe attacking Zander, Janine arrested and released, and Sonny worried over AJ hitting on Courtney.

This is also an original 8 hr edit from my original episodes.

It ends just after Sonny has sent Michael to the island, he thinks he has sent Carly as well (for her safety from Alcazar) but she snuck off the airplane and appeared back at the penthouse. Brenda appears on the yacht at the very end of the tape in Vanessa's first scene. I included the Brenda body shots, and some of the alcazar plotting to set up the story line.

Click here to read the full edit description.\n\nLorenzo Alcazar #1 June 6 - October 14, 2003: 8 hr original edit\n\nThis edit begins with his arrival in June and contains every Lorenzo scene into Oct 14. He meets Carly, figures out Ric is holding her in the panic room, rescues her only to hold her hostage himself, Carly goes into labor and Lorenzo fights with the doctor to save her baby, and Carly is rescued from the clinic by Jason and Sonny. Back in PC, Alcazar pursues Carly with flowers, backgammon game, and literally tries to drive Sonny crazy with the appearence of Marcella (who Alcazar has given plastic surgery to make her look exactly like Sonny's dead wife, Lily). It is established that Lorenzo loaned the Cassidines money and is now looking to collect, he has Nik beat up and continues to threathen him, until Jason repays the loan to protect Emily. Stefan tries to kill Alcazar and Carly saves his life. Sonny moves out of the penthouse in order to protect Carly, after \"Lily\" has warned Sonny that Carly and the baby are in danger. Alcazar sabotages Sonny's plane, and is horrified to learn Carly has gone aboard at the last moment. The edit ends as the plane safely makes an emergency landing, Sonny leaves Carly again for her safety, and she sees Lorenzo appear out of the fog.\n\nI included additional scenes between Sonny & Carly as necessary to show the impact that Alcazar's schemes had upon their relationship but I did not include every S&C scene. I showed the confrontations between S&C after Alcazar sent her flowers, the game, after she goes to meet him, helps save his life, to show the effect Alcazar has, and when they are talking about him. This edit follows the story from Lorenzo's viewpoint and includes all of Lorenzo's scenes and includes all of his interaction with Ric, Jason, Sonny, Carly, Courtney, Faith, and Dillon is included. For anyone who wants all of the Sonny & Carly scenes, I recommend the S&C edits as those contain every Sonny & every Carly scene, and a LOT of Alcazar. Those edits are more of the whole S&C storyline (but they don't include every Alcazar scene with Dillon, Sage, ect if it doesn't pertain to the S&C storyline). Alcazar arrives towards the end of the S&C #21, so he would be on the S&C #22, 23, 24, and #25, ect. So this Alcazar edit condenses the storyline a bit to focus more just on his scenes, and the impact he has on those around him. Click here to read the full edit description.\n\nLorenzo Alcazar #2 October 14, 2003 - January 16, 2004 - 8 hours\n\nI continued to include all of Lorenzo's scenes on the Alcazar #2. Because I had already done all of the Sonny and all of the Carly storyline on the S&C edits, I did not include all of Carly's scenes with Sonny on this edit. I did include scenes between S&C on the island when she tells him about the dreams and her feelings for Alcazar, when Sonny takes off to shoot Alcazar, and takes Sam hostage, and I included scenes between S&C while they are holed up in the penthouse as the police try to arrest Sonny. Alcazar is waiting outside and I felt those scenes needed to be included to follow the storyline. While Sonny was off at the island, Carly's scenes were all about her growing feelings for Lorenzo, so from that point on I included all of Carly's scenes as she talked about Lorenzo with Courtney and Jason. This edit contains Carly falling down the stairs of the new house, going into labor during the storm, Lorenzo finding her, Sonny finding them together and shooting them both, Morgan's birth, Carly's coma dreams, Jason kidnaps Lorenzo and holds him in the panic room, Carly goes to Lorenzo in the panic room and they almost make love, up through Carly has herself committed to Shadybrook. Lorenzo overhears his guards discussing this. Click here to read the full edit description."
