        "text": "Vampires in Port Charles, since when?\n\nWell some General Hospital fans may not have heard or vaguely remember the short-lived spinoff ABC show that diverged from the traditional medical drama/soap opera format and dabbled into the supernatural with vampires, vampire slayers, angels, demons and werewolves.\n\nPort Charles, as the half-hour spinoff was called, aired on June 1, 1997 up until its last episode on October 3, 2003. The spinoff show was canceled and only lasted six seasons. The show followed established GH characters such as Lucy Coe (Lynn Herring), Kevin Collins (Jon Lindstrom), Scott Baldwin (Kin Shriner), and Karen Wexler (Marie Wilson) with new characters, many of them interns as well as residents in a medical program taking place in the fictional New York town the show is named after (and where GH is originally set).\n\nThe Supernatural\n\nREAD MORE: General Hospital fans 'heartbroken' and 'tearing up' as Blaze’s mom 'blows up her whole life'\n\nREAD MORE: General Hospital's Michael Easton 'just sat in the dark for 45 minutes' after emotional goodbye\n\nIn the later years of the series, which adapted a 13-week telenovela storyline format in 2000, the plot lines shifted with more supernatural elements and had less of emphasis on the hospital setting which was the initial focus. After the switch in format, the show had arcs called a \"book\" and there were 12 of them in total. One of the most popular arcs was called \"Tainted Love\" and that followed bloodsucker Caleb Morley (Michael Easton) and his obsession with Livvie Locke (Kelly Monaco) because Livvie looked like Caleb's deceased lover, Olivia.\n\nThe two become a supercouple for the soap. In 2008, Soap in Depth did a list of the 100 Greatest Daytime Couples in ABC soaps and Caleb and Livvie were at number 34 and Rafe Kovich (Brian Gaskill) and Alison Barrington (Erin Hershey Presley) were at number 92. Also in Soaps.com's 2024 list of the 50+ All-Time Greatest Supercouples Ranked, Caleb and Livvie may not placed but they were an honorary bonus entry in the list. The impact of them is clearly still felt after all these years.\n\nThe show's co-creator Wendy Riche (other co-creators were Richard Culliton and wife Carolyn Culliton) talked about where the inspiration to incorporate the supernatural, specifically vampires, came from.\n\n“The inspiration for a vampire storyline comes from romance,” she told We Love Soaps. “It comes from unrequited love. And that you have to be together, but you cannot get together. That’s one of the major elements of soap opera storytelling. It’s not coming from the thought, 'Let’s do something supernatural.' That is too mechanical in thinking.\"\n\n\"It comes [from] our hearts, as women, loving that kind of storytelling. Loving the kind of man who would do anything for you, even if [it] meant not being with you. That’s why Twilight was so successful. I knew there was something about vampires that was sexy and romantic if it was done right.\" Wendy continued.\n\nCancelation\n\nClick here to follow the Mirror US on Google News to stay up to date with all the latest news, sport and entertainment stories.\n\nThe show was canceled in 2023 because of low ratings and financial concerns, although the show was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Daytime Drama Series that same year.\n\n“This was an extremely difficult decision,” Brian Frons, who was the ABC Daytime president by that point, said to the press. “We were very pleased with the creative execution of the show, but the 30-minute format in this time period posed significant financial challenges, which ultimately led to this decision.”\n\nWendy also talked about the cancelation to We Love Soaps in 2010, saying: \"Port Charles was a beloved show, but it just didn’t make sense in the numbers, the dollars.\" She went on to say the show may have been big in \"30 years.\"\n\n\"But to expect a show in six years to be as big as a show that had been on for 40 years in that genre when there are fewer people watching, it’s not the right comparison,” the co-creator elaborated.\n\nCharacters such as Scott, Audrey Hardy (Rachel Ames) and Leslie Charleson (Monica Quartermaine) went back to General Hospital. Rachel and Monica were several of the veteran characters from GH who made appearances on the spinoff and were on GH still. Some of the Port Charles actors came to General Hospital as completely new characters afterward like Kelly Monaco (Sam McCall), Kiko Ellsworth (Stan Johnson), Eddie Matos (Peter Marquez), Kent King (Dr. Lainey Winters), Jay Pickett (Det. Jay Pickett) and Ian Buchanan (Duke Lavery).\n\nMichael, who played Caleb and alter ego rockstar Stephen Clay, went on to General Hospital as his character from the canceled One Life to Live, John McBain, then as Dr. Silas Clay and finally Dr. Hamilton Finn. He announced on June 26 he was leaving the soap after a decade and his final episode was on June 27 as Finn. In 2019, he spoke to Soaps In Depth about why playing the vampire was his favorite.\n\n“The vampire was such freedom,” the actor said. “It’s the biggest sandbox I’ve ever played in because there are no rules. You can’t say, ‘Vampires wouldn’t do that.’ Who knows what a vampire would do? If he wanted to walk across someone’s couch, fine. He’s a vampire! It was good fun.”\n\nGeneral Hospital decided to make a nod to Port Charles in 2013 when they revisited the vampire storyline when Lynn, who portrays Lucy, officially came back to the show and noticed familiar faces in Michael playing John and Kelly as Sam. Lucy in the show thought John and Sam were Caleb and Livvie and reverted back to her vampire slayer persona. John and Sam also thought they had met each other before. Michael even made a cheeky return as Caleb who was in disguise, not dead and dressed as a doctor in his last appearance. The show made Michael's new role as Silas connected to Caleb aka Stephen by making Silas and Stephen brothers."
