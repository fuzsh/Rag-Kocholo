        "text": "NEW YORK — Elisabeth Hasselbeck of “Survivor” fame has passed an equally discriminating test — the judgment of Barbara Walters — in winning the fifth co-host seat on ABC Daytime’s femme talkie “The View.”\n\nWalters, exec producer and co-host of “The View,” made the announcement on Monday’s show, ending a three-way competition between Hasselbeck, model-actress Rachel Campos and ABC sudser star Erin Hershey Presley.\n\n“This is like no other first day I’ve ever had,” said Hasselbeck as she walked onto the set after Walters’ introduction.\n\nWalters said in a statement: “All three of our final contestants were very special and talented young women, but Elisabeth seemed just right, and our viewers’ emails, telephone calls and letters truly supported our choice.” Hasselbeck earned national attention as a contestant on CBS’ “Survivor: The Australian Outback,” making it to the final four before being booted off. More recently, Hasselbeck signed as a host of the Style Network’s “The Look for Less,” which hunts down bargain deals for designer labels. Married to NFL quarterback Tim Hasselbeck, she also has hosted programs on MTV and done commercials.\n\nAt “The View,” the on-air search for a fifth co-host commenced earlier this year after Lisa Ling left the program in December. A number of people tried out, with the pool narrowed down to the final three.\n\nOther “View” co-hosts are moderator Meredith Vieira, comedian Joy Behar and former prosecutor Star Jones."
