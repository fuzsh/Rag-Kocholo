His boss, Margot, invites the candidates for partner to a dinner at her house, where she will ultimately make the final decision. Will, who is worried that Vince will ruin his chances of getting the promotion, is reluctant to bring him as his date. Grace also attends Margot's dinner party under the pretense that Margot has set her up on a blind date. Once there, Grace realizes the blind date is with Margot's husband.
