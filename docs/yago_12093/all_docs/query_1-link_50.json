        "text": "Fresh baked bread is about THE BEST smell to ever grace your kitchen, and it doesn’t have to be intimidating. This no knead artisan bread recipe is hands-down a crowd pleaser and super simple to make. I’ve been making it for years and it’s never failed me yet. I’ve gifted it to teachers, friends, families who need a meal, and stock-piled it in my freezer to make weeknight dinners simpler.\n\nWith four simple pantry ingredients, you can make this anytime: flour, salt, yeast, and water. That’s it friends.\n\nThis bread requires a SLOW-RISE which allows it to develop great flavor! Start the dough in the afternoon or evening and bake the next morning. This requires a little forethought, but it’s a great weekend project. It’s not a complicated dough and requires very little hands-on effort or experience. You can do this!!\n\nKitchen tools that make the job easy:\n\n6-8 quart cast-iron Dutch Oven\n\nDanish Dough Whisk\n\nThis artisan bread recipe is slightly adapted from Angela at Frugal Living NW, you can find her original recipe here. Read her post for awesome in-depth instructions.\n\nThis bread also freezes really well. Once fully cooled, wrap in plastic wrap and freeze. When ready to use, set on the counter and fully defrost, then warm for 20 minutes in a 275 degree oven. Slice it, toast it, drizzle it…. anything goes here! Check out my recipe for Homemade Strawberry Jam and you will have the perfect combo with this bread.\n\nI love to half this recipe and bake in a smaller dutch oven, then gift the loaves with a meal or just because.\n\nKids need money to go to summer camp? Have them help make/bake, then sell the loaves to family and friends. This bread costs around $1/loaf to make and your friends would gladly pay $5 for a good cause.\n\nxo, Sarah\n\nNo-Knead Artisan Bread\n\n5 from 8 votes\n\nPrep Time 30 minutes mins\n\nCook Time 50 minutes mins\n\nRising Time 18 hours hrs\n\nTotal Time 19 hours hrs 20 minutes mins\n\nServings 1 large loaf\n\nEquipment\n\n6-8qt Cast iron Dutch Oven\n\nDough Whisk\n\nIngredients\n\n6 cups All-Purpose Flour plus more for work surface\n\n1/2 tsp Instant or Active-Dry Yeast\n\n2 1/2 tsp Kosher Salt\n\n2 2/3 cup Water room temperature\n\nInstructions\n\nIn a large bowl, combine the flour, yeast, and salt. Add the water and stir until all the ingredients are well incorporated (I love my Danish Dough Whisk for this!). The dough should be a little wet and sticky. Add extra water 1 Tbsp at a time if needed. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Let the dough sit for 12-18 hours on the counter at room temperature.\n\nLightly flour a work surface. Using a spatula or your hands, scrape dough out of bowl onto the work surface and sprinkle more flour on top. Using floured hands, lightly shape dough by moving it in a circular motion until round in shape and not sticky. *You can gently tuck edges under or fold it over on itself a few times, but I try to handle it as little as possible. Remember, no-knead.\n\nSpray your bread bowl generously with cooking spray. Place dough back into bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise for about 2 hours or until dough has doubled. (I have shortened this when short on time, and it works out just fine. This bread is VERY forgiving!)\n\nAfter about 1 ½ hours, preheat your oven to 425 degrees. Place your cast-iron Dutch Oven in the oven as it preheats. When dough is fully risen, carefully remove your pot from the oven. Remove plastic wrap from bowl, then flip the bowl over allowing bread to land in pot bottom-side up. Shake pot once or twice if dough looks unevenly distributed (or don’t, it will still turn out just fine!).\n\nCover and bake for 40 minutes. Uncover and continuing baking for 10 minutes more, until the crust is deep brown. The internal temperature of bread should be about 200 degrees.\n\nRemove the pot from the oven and immediately transfer bread to a cooking rack. Let it cool completely before slicing. (Slicing too soon will leave your bread gummy, so resist the urge)\n\nNotes\n\nTip 1: This bread is super forgiving. Add too much water during mixing? Throw a little more flour in! Short on time, use the minimum rise time. Need to feed the baby or take a shower during the second shorter rise? Let it go for 2-3 hours. Tip 2: Looking to add a little pizzazz or flavor? Sprinkle Everything Bagel Seasoning in the dough during mixing or on top just before baking… or both! Roast a head of garlic and mix the cloves into the dough. Add a little sharp cheddar and chopped jalapeno. Swap 3 cups of flour with whole wheat flour. There are lots of variations … just google it!\n\nTried this recipe?Let us know how it was!"
