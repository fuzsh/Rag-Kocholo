        "text": "Talkin’ turkey (sandwich) with Roker\n\nForget about the “Today” show, cable specials and best-selling books – Al Roker really hit it big yesterday when the Stage Deli unveiled the “Al Roker Triple Decker” sandwich, pegged to “Al Roker’s Around the World in NYC” special airing June 17 (9 p.m.) on Food Network.\n\n“I could have come up with a sandwich that I would have eaten, but then my wife would have said, ‘Why are you making a sandwich like that,‘” said Roker, laughing about the sandwich’s ingredients, which include bean sprouts and avocado.\n\n“So I created a sandwich that has a little bit of something for everyone – and a gratuitous thrill with the cheese added in.”\n\nRoker joins an esteemed list of luminaries who’ve been immortalized on rye (or wheat or white or whatever) by the Stage Deli – and he seemed genuinely thrilled about the honor.\n\n“When I was a kid in high school we went up to the old Ed Sullivan Theatre to see ‘What’s My Line?,’ and we went to the Stage Deli for a sandwich,” he said. “Who would have thought a kid from Queens would someday get his own sandwich there!”\n\nThe “Al Roker Triple Decker” also includes New York-style turkey (natch), swiss cheese and honey-mustard dressing.\n\nABC: RuPaul’s ‘Port’ of call\n\nRuPaul will celebrate Independence Day on “Port Charles” July 4.\n\nRuPaul met the cast of the ABC soap at the WKTU radio breakfast the morning of the Daytime Emmys (May 18), interviewing Erin Hershey, Kiko Ellsworth, Brian Presley, Kelly Monaco and Julie Pinson with co-host Michelle Visage.\n\nAfterward, “Port Charles” producers asked RuPaul if he wanted to appear on the show as Madame Alicia, a TV psychic (shades of the TV psychic he portrayed on his VH1 show back in 1997).\n\nRuPaul tapes his “Port Charles” appearance June 7 with Lynn Herring, who plays Lucy Coe.\n\nThis just in . . .\n\nSaturday’s “Children’s Day” kickoff at the World Trade Center’s Twin Towers (9 a.m.) – featuring a “Happy Birthday” serenade to PBS kiddie hero “Arthur” – is expected to draw as many as 35,000 parents and kids, says PR maven David Salidor.\n\n“Risking Life and Limb in Sierra Leone: Bill Beutel Reports,” tonight (11:35 p.m.) on Ch. 7. Jeffrey Jolton produced the piece, which was executive-produced by Elaine Peake.\n\nMichael J. Fox hinted on last night’s “Access Hollywood” that he will appear in the season opener of ABC’s “Spin City.” “Boy, I’m saying more than I really should,” he told Pat O’Brien.\n\n“As the World Turns” star Eileen Fulton has retained celebrity dog trainer Bash Dibra to teach her older dog some new tricks, say diners at Nirvana."
