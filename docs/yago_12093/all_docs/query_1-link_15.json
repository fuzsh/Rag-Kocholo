When a murder in self-defense caused Alison to regress, her friendship with Jamal Woods carried her through and blossomed into a loving relationship. But the tragic death of Valerie has caused Jamal to push Alison away and into the arms of Rafe, an angel with an important journey that has taken him to Port Charles.\n\nPrevious television credits include Paranormal Borderline and Pandora's Clock. Ms. Hershey was also seen in the independent feature film Slaves to the Underground, a Seattle-based grunge rock comedy. Quickly becoming a fan favorite, the Daytime press has credited her with such praise as \"Best Female Newcomer,\" an honor for which she also received a Soap Opera Digest Award nomination. She was also noted in TV Guide as giving one of the great performances of 2000.\n\nBorn and raised in Seattle, Washington, Ms. Hershey enjoys fly-fishing with her father, exercising, listening to country music and watching Saturday Night Live.\n\nShe currently resides in Los Angeles, California.\n\nBrian Presley made his delicious entrance as Jack Ramsey opposite Kelly Monaco, who portrays the enticing Livvie Locke. Now, with Caleb safely out of the picture and hopefully forever, Jack is finally free to pursue his love for Livvie.\n\nA former college quarterback, Mr. Presley left the University of Arkansas to pursue a career in acting. From the time he was eight years old until the present, he has had an affinity for musical theater and sports. Following his true passion, Mr. Presley arrived in Los Angeles without any contacts and, within weeks, began auditioning. His television credits include roles on Seventh Heaven, Moesha, Any Day Now and Beverly Hills, 90210.\n\nMr. Presley has also performed in regional stage productions of A Lie of the Mind, Private Wars, A Few Good Men and Beyond Therapy. In March he returned home as a favor to his drama teacher to perform for his alma mater as Pharoah in Joseph and The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. The performance sold out each night.\n\nRaised in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Mr. Presley enjoys most athletic activities, including golf, cycling and running. He still finds the time to play guitar and frequently works with various outreach programs that help enhance the lives of disadvantaged children.\n\nHe resides in Los Angeles, California.\n\n*Bios from abc.com\n\nBack to the Main Page"
