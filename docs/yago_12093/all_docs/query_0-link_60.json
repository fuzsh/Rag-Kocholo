We are having another little girl (Ruby Rose Presley) who is due to enter the world sometime around June 15. Children are the greatest gift from God and we are very blessed to be having another child. Have a wonderful day!”\n\nRuby Rose will join six-year-old Jackson and three-year-old Emma in the family. Best wishes to the entire clan!"
