        "text": "Catching up with the former daytime actors.\n\nIn our latest column, Soaps.com has details surrounding the careers of former soap stars of daytime canceled soaps “Another World,” “As the World Turns,” “Guiding Light,” “One Life to Live” and “Port Charles.”\n\nA Hallmark movie, primetime roles, watch on-demand, plays, an engagement, probation, cleared charges, readers’ questions answered and more…\n\nAnother World roundup.\n\nSoaps.com poster w5stone asked after three former “Another World” actors. First up, Tom Eplin… He played Jake McKinnon from 1989 to 1999, crossed over with his character to “As the World Turns” in 2002 then appeared as Chad in the 2007 film “Days of Darkness.” Next, Jensen Buchanan played Marley/Vicky McKinnon from 1993 to 1999. She went on to play Vicky on “As the World Turns” from 1999 to 2001 then appeared on “Port Charles” and “General Hospital” as Melissa Bedford. However, her first daytime role came in 1987 when she played “One Life to Live’s” Sarah Gordon Buchanan until 1990. She was then spotted in primetime on “Everwood” as Roxanne Maxwell in 2002. Last but not least, Paul Michael Valley, played Ryan Harrison from 1991 to 1993. He went on to appear as Caleb on “Guiding Light” from 2006 to 2007. In recent years, he played Luan in the short film “One Last Time” and had a stint as a burly man on “Elementary” in 2012. As of now, there are no future projects for any of these mentioned actors.\n\nWhere’s Victoria Wyndham?\n\nSoaps.com Facebook friend Char J. was curious to know what Victoria Wyndham has been up to these days. The actress played Charlotte Bauer on “Guiding Light” in 1967 and 1969 then went on to star as Rachel Davis on “Another World” from 1972 to 1999. On January 2, 2007 she guest-starred on “Law & Order: SVU” as Rita Colino in the episode titled “Scheherazade” and unfortunately hasn’t been seen elsewhere since. Fans may recognize her son Christian Camargo from such series as “Haven” (Wade Crocker), “Dexter” (Rudy Cooper), “The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1 and 2 (Eleazar Denali) and “Guiding Light” (Mark Endicott) to name a few credits.\n\nColleen Zenk to Blue Bloods.\n\nBe sure to tune in on Friday October 24 at 10:00 PM to see Colleen Zenk (“As the World Turns'” ex-Barbara Ryan) on CBS’ “Blue Bloods.” Look for the actress as Joan in the episode titled “Loose Lips.” The police drama stars Tom Selleck (Frank Reagan) and Donnie Wahlberg (Danny Reagan).\n\nWatch Martha Byrne’s new movie on-demand.\n\nLast August we alerted fans that Martha Byrne (“As the World Turns'” ex-Lily Snyder, “General Hospital’s” ex-Andrea Floyd) had been working on a new movie. “Preying for Mercy” is now available on-demand to buy or rent. The movie follows LAPD Detective Frank Gates (Jayson Gladstone) and his wife Sarah (Byrne) and a buried past consumed with secrets and violence that threatens his new identity created fifteen years prior after a bust gone bad. Watch the trailer below and visit the link via Byrne’s Twitter post to check out the movie today.\n\nMatthew Morrison married.\n\nMatthew Morrison (“As the World Turns'” ex-Adam Munson, “Glee”) married Renee Puente on Saturday October 18 in Maui, Hawaii. People reported that the groom wore a Brooks Brothers tuxedo, with the bride dressed in a Gustavo Cadile gown, for the intimate ceremony. Soaps.com sends the couple our best!\n\nMick Hazen in Forever.\n\nSoaps.com poster simbleg wondered whatever happened to the actor who played “As the World Turns'” Parker Snyder. Mick Hazen just appeared as Devin Bentley in the new ABC series “Forever,” which follows a seemingly immortal New York City medical examiner. The episode titled “The Frustrating Things About Psychopaths” aired on Tuesday October 21 at 10:00 PM. After his daytime Oakdale run from 2006 to 2010, he had a guest appearance as Miles on ABC’s “Black Box” this past May. That series has since been canceled.\n\nWhat’s been going on with Brian Presley and Erin Hershey Presley?\n\nSoaps.com poster cyberjudy1 wanted us to check in to see what married soap alums Brian Presley and Erin Hershey Presley have been doing. Erin, who played Alison Barrington Kovitch on “Port Charles (2002 to 2003), brought her character back to “General Hospital” in 2013 during the vampire storyline. Throughout the 2000s the actress had roles in primetime (“Will & Grace”) and in made for television movies such as “Marcia Potter Gets a Life.” Brian, who played Jack Ramsey on both “Port Charles” and “General Hospital,” made a comeback and starred in the 2011 film “Touchback” as Scott Murphy, also starring Kurt Russell (“Fast & Furious 7”). The film was a must-see for Presley fans. Watch the trailer below… you just might want to run out and buy the DVD!\n\nDavid Gregory to NBC.\n\n“One Life to Live’s” Robert Ford set the Llanview scene on fire for three years before the soap ended its ABC run. Now fans can see David Gregory back in primetime on NBC’s new series “Constantine.” The actor will play Eddie in the episode titled “Blessed are the Damned,” as the series follows a dark exorcist/occult detective/con man named John Constantine (Matt Ryan) who tries to protect humanity while struggling with his past sins. Tune in for the premiere on Friday October 24 at 10:00 PM with Gregory to debut during episode seven thereafter. In the last few years, the former daytime star has turned up on “Gossip Girl,” “Deception,” “Elementary,” “Excuse me for Living” and will appear in 2015’s Youthful Daze, along with other soap stars including his “One Life” pals Nik Robuck (ex-James Ford), Brittany Underwood (ex-Langston Wilde) and Trevor St. John (ex-Victor Lord).
