        "text": "Model Melissa Stetten used Twitter to publicly humiliate soap-opera actor Brian Presley, a married 34-year-old, who flagrantly hit on her during a red-eye flight out of Los Angeles. Stetten live-tweeted the entire encounter and the transcript quickly went viral. But Presley is now denying that any flirting occurred.\n\nOn Wednesday, Melissa Stetten, a 22-year-old New York-based model, was seated beside Brian Presley, an actor from the soap-opera Port Charles and a devout Christian, who has been married for 10 years and has two children with wife, Erin Hershey Presley, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nBuzzFeed was the first to report on the embarrassing interaction between Melissa Stetten and Brian Presley.\n\nNo thanks, Brian, the actor sitting next to me on this flight talking about his role with Kurt Russell and his spiritual beliefs, Stetten tweeted to her 25,000 followers when the actor first began to hit on her.\n\nThroughout their conversation, Presley proceeded to come on to the model, lie about his marital status and get drunk.\n\nBrian has a wedding ring. I ask him how his wife is, he says he just wears the ring because he likes it. Right, Brian, Stetten tweeted, followed by, Brian said he was engaged to another actress but it didn't work out because they didn't mesh well together.\n\nWhen attempting to build a connection, Presley used the line, like us sitting here right now, talking about where we're from, it's like divine interception. Right, wrote Stetten, Interception.\n\nStetten said that the actor had consumed three Heineken beers and was wasted. However, Presley has previously publicly discussed his sobriety and his dedication to God. In April, he claimed to have been sober for a year and a half.\n\nDiscussing his sobriety, he told Christianity Today, I've been in recovery for a year and a half. My wife has been awesome through this, and now we'll be able to teach our kids about what addiction is. And I hope to help other people who are struggling with the same thing. Adding that he goes to weekly AA meetings with a group of awesome, godly men from [his] church.\n\nWith God and with the program, I'm able to take it one day at a time, to really put myself in right situations and surround myself with the right people, and to have a personal relationship with Jesus, because Satan's around that next corner wanting to trip us all up, he added.\n\nHowever, according to Melissa Stetten, he is off the wagon.\n\nOn Friday, Brian Presley responded to Stetten's allegations on his official Facebook page.\n\nI love that I took a red eye flight to NY, had a 10 minute friendly conversation with the person sitting next to me, had some food, and went to sleep! Presley wrote. I learned today this person has been tweeting about me drinking beer in the airplane bathroom, and trying to commit adultery with her on the airplane. Really absurd and quite funny! ... They Even took pictures of me while I was sleeping. A little WIERD! I was on a soap opera for years and never did the writers write something this good:)\n\nNone of what this person said happened is true! I guess in today's age you have to be careful who you say hello too.\n\nSobriety, God, & My Family are the most important things in my life! My Wife Rocks, My Kids Rock, and Sobriety Rocks!!! I will pay this no more attention and I encourage all of you to do the same. God Bless all of you and thank you all for all your support! - Brian.\n\nStetten responded in turn with a tweet and link back to his Facebook page for her followers: Now THIS is funny...\n\nBelow is the entire dialogue as written by Melissa Stetten via Twitter:\n\nNo thanks, Brian, the actor sitting next to me on this flight talking about his role with Kurt Russell and his spiritual beliefs\n\nBrian is now talking about how he is an artist and believes everything happens for a reason, like how we're brought together on this flight'\n\nApparently Brian is a straightforward guy from Oklahoma who booked a McDonalds commercial when he was 19 and then God took over from there\n\nBrian hates closed minded people but loves artists in the industry, and just called this one-sided conversation a 'collabo' between us\n\nOh wow, Brian grew up on a ranch with uber conservative parents but his stance on gay marriage is ZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzz....\n\nBrian just said 'like us sitting here right now, talking about where we're from, it's like divine interception.' right, interception\n\nBrian asked what I do for a living. I said model. He said oh I love meeting other artists like myself\n\nBrian just finished working on a movie with Matthew McConaughey who inspired his 'craft' immensely being a small town boy like himself\n\nYes, this is BRIAN! RT @Pat_Healy: @MelissaStetten Is this him by any chance? http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0696169/\n\nHe said he was engaged for 6 months but broke it off! RT @Pat_Healy: @MelissaStetten Ask him how his wife Erin and son Jackson are\n\nBrian likes going back home to Oklahoma to inspire the less fortunate to become 'artists' like himself\n\nBrian just took his Heineken in a plastic cup into the bathroom. Will report back shortly\n\nHoly s***, Brian came out of the bathroom WITHOUT his wedding ring on. Watch out Virgin America, you've got a real charmer on board.\n\nBrian is back, he just ordered the chicken salad sandwich\n\nBrian's been looking for the headphone jack for 10 minutes\n\nBrian asked if I saw Book of Mormon. I said yes. He said he wanted to get into theater when he was a rodeo boy back in 'Homa (oklahoma)\n\nBrian said he was engaged to another actress but it didn't work out because they didn't 'mesh well' together\n\nHoly s**t. He's had 3 heinekens and is wasted. Sober? Hardly. RT @PlaidMcPlatypus: did you say he was drinking beer?\n\nDid I just ruin Brian Presley's life via twitter?\n\nWho opens the windows on a redeye flight? Brian does. F***ing Brian"
