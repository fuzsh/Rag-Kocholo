        "text": "Once upon a time Erin Hershey Presley was a finalist to be a View co-host, competing with Rachel Campos & Elisabeth Hasselbeck to be the \"Conservative\" voice on The View\n\nElisabeth beat Erin - and now all these years later Erin Hershey Presley has called Joe Biden a \"criminal\"\n\nErin Hershey Presley (ex-Amanda Barrington) was shooting off emails to fellow parents about her daughter’s teacher’s plan to give their class the opportunity to skip in order to watch the 59th presidential inauguration.\n\nAccording to TMZ, which first reported the news, Hershey Presley stated in an email that she didn’t want her daughter watching the inauguration because she’d never let them “watch a criminal.”\n\nAdditional comments from the email chain, obtained by TMZ, include Hershey Presley saying to the teacher and other parents, “Why watch a criminal on television? I’d never do that to my children. But thank you.”\n\nA fellow parent thanked the teacher for their consideration and told Hershey Presley “no matter the person taking office, we are lucky to be able to watch moments like this,” to which Hershey Presley responded, “I don’t think we are lucky at all to watch a flat out joke.”\n\nIn an unquoted statement released to TMZ, Hershey Presley told the publication that she stood by what she said in her emails and has no regrets in sending them.\n\nR5, Alanis Stewart comes to mind when it comes to hypocritical shitheads. She's not \"Christian Christian,\" but she's one of these assholes who thinks the Trumps restored \"real American values\" to the WH. Ya know, after that filthy black family who were a friggin Norman Rockwell painting left.\n\nThis is a woman who's been married/divorced a couple of times, raised drug addicts who get married/divorced in 5 minutes and who get impregnated after a one night stand.\n\nFace it, these dirtbags think simply being white makes them the best of America, meanwhile, you have tons of non-white, immigrant families who actually have stable families with morality."
