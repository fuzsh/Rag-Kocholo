        "text": "Now that she’s heir to Graceland, Riley Keough is thinking about changing her name. The actress is still mourning the shocking death of her mom, Lisa Marie Presley, but through her grief she’s decided to honor her mom and grandfather, Elvis, by taking the Presley last name. Riley is leaning towards changing her name to Presley-Keough but insiders say it might become Keough-Presley. While still working out the specifics, she’s pretty confident that adding Presley is the right decision. (We agree) The Presley name could open many doors…\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA\n\nIt’s a sad day for Elvis Presley’s family. Lisa Marie Presley’s daughter, actress Riley Keough, posted this photo as a tribute to her brother Benjamin on July 12, the day he died by suicide at the age of 27. (two years ago) She wrote: Not an hour goes by that I don’t think of you and miss you. Benjamin looked a LOT like his grandfather Elvis and was even offered a record contract by Universal at the age of 17. Nothing came of it, and he struggled with drugs, alcohol, and depression. (Apparently the subject of higher education never came up in that Scientology family.) Ben actually BLAMED Scientology for many of his problems. He said it “messes you up.” After he died, his devastated mother Lisa Marie and the rest of his family split from Scientology. He was buried at Graceland.\n\nPhoto: Instagram\n\nIt had to happen. All the women in the Presley family were completely taken by Austin Butler’s swoonworthy performance in the movie Elvis. Priscilla Presley declared that Austin was “outstanding” at the Cannes film Festival. Elvis’s granddaughter Riley Keough was at Cannes with her own film, and said she was “overwhelmed” by Austin as Elvis. Her mother Lisa Marie Presley declared that she was “moved to tears” by Austin and the film is “exquisite. “ So it’s no surprise that they invited Austin to visit Graceland and even allowed him to play Elvis’s own guitar. Riley, still overwhelmed, posted this photo online…\n\n(Omigosh- that DECOR!)\n\nPhoto: Instagram\n\nWho would have guessed that Elvis’s pretty granddaughter Riley Keough would become a film director? Granted, she’s an established actress, but we didn’t realize that Elvis’s offspring would turn out to be so ambitious. Actually, Riley co-directed her first film War Pony with partner Gina Gammell -and their first try got them to the Cannes Film Festival! The young directors were floored when they got a huge ovation from their audience. The film is a glimpse into the life of a young 23 year old Native American growing up on a reservation. Coincidentally, Baz Luhrmann’s film Elvis, about Riley’s grandfather, is premiering at Cannes in a few days – fortunately Riley already saw it and loves it, so she will probably stick around for that…\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA\n\nDid NOT recognize Riley Keough in this photo of her leaving the Chanel Film Benefit Gala at the MoMa in New York because she looks so skinny! It seems her fans have been chatting incessantly online about her 25 pound weight loss. Some say Elvis’s granddaughter started losing weight because she was devastated after her brother Benjamin Keough’s suicide last year. Others have decided that she’s anorexic. Since most people would be thrilled to lose weight, we hope she’s happy with herself. Certainly she can indulge over the holidays more than the rest of us!\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA\n\nWe can’t stop thinking about Lisa Marie Presley’s new book – she’s writing her autobiography (“to set the record straight”) which will cover her childhood with her father Elvis, as well as her four marriages. She was married to Michael Jackson for two years, Nicolas Cage after that, as well as two Scientologists. She obviously has some hot scoop to spill about Elvis and Michael Jackson, because the publisher gave her over three million dollars up front. Timing couldn’t be better after the Finding Neverland documentary. Lisa has insisted she and Michael had a “normal” sex life, but she did allude to his drug abuse and flakey “entourage.” Lisa has always seemed rather spoiled and ill-tempered, but we were impressed when she left Scientology in 2016. Will she have the courage to criticize the cult? Sadly, her daughter, actress Riley Keough, above, is still a Scientologist.\n\nPhoto Credit: BACKGRID-USA\n\nRiley(The Girlfriend Experience) Keough, 26, is in Paris and she’s looking quite sophisticated and self-assured. In case you’ve forgotten, she comes from a unique background – her mother Lisa Marie Presley was raised a Scientologist and Michael Jackson became her stepfather when Riley was 6. Her mother divorced Michael after 2 years and fortunately she eventually left Scientology. In the past, Riley modeled (Dolce & Gabbana) but for the past few years she’s been making movies non-stop. She has 3 (besides Logan Lucky) being released this year, and 5 next year.\n\n(Above Riley’s in Paris for Fashion Week. She’s wearing black shorts with that outfit)\n\nIt’s been a big year for Elvis Presley’s beautiful granddaughter Riley Keough, 26. She married an Australian stuntman, Ben Smith-Peterson, and she just finished starring in an anthology series for Starz called The Girlfriend Experience. Riley plays a successful NY career girl who becomes fascinated when a friend introduces her to the world of transactional relationships – where men PAY to spend time with attractive women. Almost like a real girlfriend, but money changes hands. Hence, the business is called “The Girlfriend Experience.” In the photo above, Riley is promoting the series at Cannes. A few days ago she walked the runway in the Balenciaga show during Paris Fashion Week.\n\nPhoto Credit: Pacific Coast News\n\nMad Max: Fury Road star and more importantly, Elvis’s granddaughter, Riley Keough, enjoyed good timing with her wedding this week. She had a normal, non-Scientology wedding! This wouldn’t have been possible a few years back because her mother was a strident Scientologist. Lisa Marie moved to England a few years ago where she came to her senses and dropped out of Scientology. Riley met her stuntman groom, Ben Smith-Peterson, when she filmed Mad Max a few years ago. This guy must feel like he hit the lottery.\n\n(Above, Rilay and Ben at Coachella)\n\nPhoto Credit: Pacific Coast News"
