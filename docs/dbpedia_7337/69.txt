Museo Jumex is the first building in Latin America designed by British architect Sir David Chipperfield for Eugenio López Alonso, a Grupo Jumex heir.

Mounted on 14 columns allows the building ground floor open to a surrounding public plaza.

The museum has five floors, three dedicated to temporary exhibition space.

Non-permanent exhibitions change regularly and typically feature just one or two artists at a time.

There are also levels for educational and academic programs, a bookstore, a café and the foundation’s headquarters.

Founded by an heir to the Jumex juice fortune Eugenio López, the contemporary art museum opened in 2013 across the street from the Museo Soumaya,

The subdued travertine Jumex is not as eye-popping as Carlos Slim's shiny silver cloud next door but the exhibition design of the Jumex is arguably superior.

Shows draw from the museum's 2,700-strong collection that includes boldfaced names like Jeff Koons, Damien Hirst, and Andy Warhol, as well as temporary exhibitions of work by international contemporary artists.
