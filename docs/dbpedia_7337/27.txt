1961... Our beginnings

Jumex Group was founded on April 27th of 1961 with the creation of Packing of fruits and juices. With only 20 employees, this packing company began extracting and producing juices and nectars with the best fruit production in the country.

In 1964 came the 350ml little blue can, trademarked under the Jumex name, and it was quickly identified as the best beverage among all juices and nectars in Mexico.

1970s... A cutting-edge technology company

In 1974, the plant acquired an evaporating machine, whose function was to produce a juice concentrate to be packed in containers for storage.This was a big technological progress in the conservation of the perishable products and it helped enormously to the following steps in packing technology.

1980s... First exports

In 1982, be exported to the United States in the canned nectar format. By then, Jumex already had distribution centers in the most important states of Mexico, covering the most remote territories of our country.

1984–1989... Innovations

In 1984, Jumex Group launched a new 1-liter glass bottle. Two years later in 1986, that same technique gave rise to the new 250ml bottle. Both bottle sizes debuted in the market in apple, grape, orange and grapefruit flavors, apart from tomato concentrate.

In 1985, the Aseptic Production Plant was built, and the 250ml Chupi Frut was introduced, a product for children, manufactured with an innovative process. Its success spawned the development of new products for children and the young, such as Bida (1987) and Amí (1988), both in 250ml cans. In 1989, a new children’s beverage in a plastic (250ml) pack was introduced: Pau-Pau, which currently remains as popular among children as it was back then.

1990s... Quick growth

In 1992, the Master Distribution Center was built, in addition to several new distribution centers throughout Mexico, covering more regions of the country.

In 1995, the Jumex 130ml can made its debut in stores.

In 1998, Jumex created its first isotonic drink: Vigor Sport, in a 350ml presentation.

In 2000…

In 2000, the Juicer Plant (Planta Juguera) started its operations with cutting-edge technology that enabled production of sweeteners (sugar syrup). A year later, the plant managed to produce the “frugomizado” and “oromizado” (concentrate for juices and nectars).

Also that year, Jumex Mexicalli started its operations. Currently the plant has several production lines, and it launched two novel products: Jumex 8 vegetables and Jumex 8 fruits, both in 280ml can format.

In 2001, Mi desayuno came along (in a 250ml carton presentation), a fruit milkshake enriched with cereals, milk protein, vitamins and minerals.
