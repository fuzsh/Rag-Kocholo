Museo Jumex is the principal platform of the foundation and the space of action for Colección Jumex. The building, designed by British architect David Chipperfield, was conceived as a unique space to promote discovery, reflection, criticism and learning through contemporary art through a critical program that questions the paradigms of thought and the great themes of our time.
