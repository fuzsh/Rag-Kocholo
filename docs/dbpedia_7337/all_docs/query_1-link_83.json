        "text": "Last weekend in Mexico City, the sleek doors of the highly anticipated Museo Jumex finally opened. The museum, which began construction in September 2010, was designed by British architect David Chipperfield and reveals the largest private modern and contemporary art collection in Latin America. The unique architecture uses a mix of travertine and concrete, with unique geometric lines. The Jumex collection is the beautifully eccentric product of 46-year old founder Eugenio Lopez, who introduced and celebrated the four debuting exhibitions among artists, curators, collectors, and celebrities.\n\nCommencing the weekend Friday with a welcome dinner, guests dined at the breathtaking mansion, Casa de la Bola. Attendance included Lopez, Chipperfield, Museo Jumex director Patrick Charpenel, Eva Longoria, Will Ferrell, and many more. The next afternoon began with a private preview of the exhibitions, conjugating curators and artists alike. Following the preview, Saturday evening hosted the official opening. The debuting exhibitions include “A Space in Two Dimensions: A selection from the Jumex Collection and Fred Sandback,” “Cosmogonía doméstica by Damián Ortega,” “Jamie Lee Byars: ½ an autobiography,” and “Las Ideas de Gamboa.” In attendance included artists Gabriel Orozco, Damián Ortega, Dan Colen, Jose Parla among many others."
