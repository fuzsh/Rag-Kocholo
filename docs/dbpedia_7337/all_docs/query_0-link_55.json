        "text": "The exhibition Tierra Blanca Joven at the Brooklyn Museum, draws from the artist’s own experiences as an undocumented immigrant and cancer survivor to weave together themes of displacement, illness, recovery, and healing in new and existing works; objects from the Museum’s Maya art collection; and a Healing Room.\n\nTate Modern and Hyundai Motor announced that Chilean artist and poet Cecilia Vicuña will create the next annual Hyundai Commission.

A prolific multi-disciplinary artist, Vicuña explores the pressing concerns of ecology, community, and social justice. Her new site-specific work for the Turbine Hall will inaugurate on October 11th 2022.\n\nIn this 59th International Art Exhibition – La Biennale di Venezia, the largest contemporary art event in the world, the artist selected to represent Argentina is Mónica Heller, who will show in the Argentine pavilion the video installation entitled The Origin of Substance Will Matter the Importance of Origin.

Curated by El Museo’s chief curator, Rodrigo Moura, and guest curator Julieta González, the exhibition spans several decades of his production, from the 1950s to the early 2020s, in different media such as film, painting, photography, video installations, documents, and assemblages. This is the largest exhibition-to-date dedicated to the artist.\n\nWhile the Storm Arrives is a project for our tumultuous times in which mounir fatmi assesses the sheer weight of accounts and commentaries we increasingly have to bear—physically and intellectually violent narratives that have marked our past and are now shaping our future.\n\nFor the Austrian Pavilion in Venice in 2022, Jakob Lena Knebl and Ashley Hans Scheirl have conceived stage-like installations, entitled Invitation of the Soft Machine and Her Angry Body Parts, in which they unfurl their entire artistic cosmos – from paintings, sculptures, textile works, photographs, text and video to a fashion collection and a publication in the form of a magazine. These “spaces of desire” upset conventional notions of museum presentations and subvert the hierarchies of art and design, of high and low.\n\nFollowing its highly acclaimed debut at the 2019 Biennale, Ghana will present the exhibition Black Star—The Museum as Freedom for the Ghana Pavilion at the 59th International Art Exhibition—la Biennale di Venezia in 2022.

Through the practice of these artists -Ad Minoliti, Marina González Guerreiro, Eva Kot'átková and Korakrit Arunanondchai-, the curator Rafa Barber Cortell invites us to think about the imaginary that has been created around the \"inner world\".\n\nMexican artist, Teresa Margolles, transfers the space of death to the sphere of art, a metaphor par excellence of the border, of a limit that paradoxically is reached only when we are no longer and, therefore, we will no longer be able to tell it. An attempt to counter addiction and impotence in the face of daily tragedies such as gender violence or the exploitation of illegal immigration, caused by the inaction of governments and by a melodramatic or sensationalistic media exploitation.\n\nLexus, official partner of ARCOmadrid 2022, awarded for the second year the Prize for the Best Stand and Artistic Content of the edition with a prize of 10,000 euros. The purpose of the award is to highlight not only the great work that all the artists do in their galleries, but also those who stand out for their great presentation.\n\nAmarantus is the first retrospective in Mexico of Mariana Castillo Deball's art, who has created a vast body of work in the space between science, narrative, fiction and the visual arts, as well as their relationship with the ways in which Mexico’s precolonial history has been appropriated and investigated at different times.\n\nAlmost 51 years after the inauguration of an artwork that extolled communication and symbiosis between non-human living beings, science has now come to reinforce and update artistic concepts, with the reversion of an exhibition by the renowned Argentine artist Carlos Ginzburg. The conceptual and theoretical artist returned to Buenos Aires with the exhibition \"MYCORHIZES: Trees communicate with each other through an ecological internet formed by the root-fungus symbiosis\".

A series of twenty-five new drawings created expressly for this exhibition meld a wide variety of images into arresting abstractions of pulsing color and form, while still occasionally revealing their representational sources.\n\nEs Baluard Museu d'Art Contemporani de Palma exhibits “The Archive of Dust: An Ongoing Project”, an exhaustive overview of the fundamental lines that characterize Elena del Rivero’s (Valencia, 1949) work gravitating around the attacks of the World Trade Center on September 11th, 2001, in New York. The project deals with loss, the collective memory and pain, as well as with the construction of the existential pillars that make up the beliefs and values ​​of society to rethink the future.\n\nThe work of Carola Zech, Argentinian artist of German descent, arrived, starting September 25th, at the German Embassy in Buenos Aires.
