        "text": "“There was such a lack of support in Mexico for young artists,” says Mexican fruit-juice heir Eugenio López, explaining why he founded the Fundación/Colección Jumex, in 2001. “If a young artist came to a potential sponsor and said, ‘Listen, I’m going to fill up a Volkswagen with water and cut it in half, and I need $10,000,’ they would have said, ‘Get this crazy person out of here!’ But then I came along and said, ‘Come to me!’” A decade or so later, the museum has amassed the largest private art collection in Latin America, with some 2,000 pieces, including many by American and European masters ranging from Cy Twombly and Robert Rauschenberg to Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst. After transforming one of his father’s factories on the outskirts of Mexico City into an exhibition space that became among the liveliest in the Western Hemisphere, López decided to build a permanent home for his collection. Thus the opening November 19 of the Museo Jumex, in the heart of Mexico City’s fashionable Polanco district (just next door to billionaire Carlos Slim Helú’s Museo Soumaya). Designed by British architect David Chipperfield, the striking new museum, with 40,000 square feet of exhibition space, will showcase the Jumex collection and mount world-class exhibitions, such as Latin America’s first Twombly show, opening this coming spring. López, a dashing and hyper-energetic 46-year-old, instructed Chipperfield, who has just been awarded the Praemium Imperiale, the world’s most prestigious cultural prize, to cut no corners in construction. “It was built with the same quality as any top museum in London or Berlin,” he says. “We went all over the world to get the best components.” López has also emerged as one of Los Angeles’s leading arts patrons. This August, MOCA, where he has been a trustee since 2004, elected him a vice-chair. “Eugenio is one of the great patrons and collectors of our time,” says former director Jeffrey Deitch. “He’s had a transformative effect on MOCA and a profound effect on the whole world of contemporary art.” López’s parents looked askance two decades ago when he moved to Los Angeles and began collecting contemporary art. Today, his glamorous midcentury house in Beverly Hills—the scene of many a memorable party—showcases a superlative collection of paintings and sculpture that has ballooned in scope and worth. “Now my parents say, ‘Eugenio, what a vision you have! You’re a genius!’ I never thought I would hear them say that,” he says with a laugh.\n\nEugenio López on Amassing the Largest Private Art Collection in Latin America\n\n1 / 5\n\nHollywood\n\nThe Real Reason Matt Damon Loves Working With Casey Affleck\n\n“You need to get every idea out,” says the star of The Instigators, in a joint interview with Affleck. “You get there a lot faster if you’re not worried about people’s feelings.
