        "text": "This is a book about objects. Stones, ruins, bones, mummies, mannequins, statues, photographs, fakes, instruments, and natural history specimens all formed part of Mexico’s National Museum complex at different moments across two centuries of collecting and display. Museum Matters traces the emergence, consolidation, and dispersal of this national museum complex by telling the stories of its objects. Objects that have been separated over time are brought back together in this book in order to shed light on the interactions and processes that have forged things into symbols of science, aesthetics, and politics. The contributors to this volume illuminate how collections came into being or ceased to exist over time, or how objects moved in and out of collections and museum spaces. They explore what it means to move things physically and spatially, as well as conceptually and symbolically. Museum Matters unravels the concept of the national museum. By unmaking the spaces, frameworks, and structures that form the complicated landscape of national museums, this volume brings a new way to understand the storage, displays, and claims about the Mexican nation’s collections today.\n\nThis article explores the \"agency of display\" by analyzing key moments in the exhibition of popular art in Mexico's museums from the immediate post-revolutionary period through the neoliberal dismantling of the welfare state. It explores how the consumption of popular cart has been rationalized in and through exhibitions to track the shift in state discourses regarding what constitutes citizenship at different historical moments. Situated within contemporary debates over the citizen-consumer, this article shows that popular citizenship and the consumption of popular art have always been linked while also acknowledging that the advent of social liberalism marks a distinct and highly paradoxical transformation of relations of state, society, and economy in Mexico. To that end, the article concludes by analyzing displays of popular art in the revised ethnographic galleries, a temporary exhibition by the Fondo Nacional de Fomento a las Artesanias, and the gift store at the National Museum of Anthropology.\n\nIn the past two decades the industrial decline of many western economies has forced them to turn towards the tertiary sector in order to diversify their infrastructure and find new sources of income. One of the characteristics of this process was the development of urban regeneration plans, which recognised the potential of the cultural sector for economic development. Central to this approach was the use of modern art museums as magnets for tourism and inward investment. This practice has produced a number of examples, the most famous being the Guggenheim Bilbao. The phenomenal success of this museum has caused it to become a model and this is why it ought to be examined critically. The creation of the museum is initially considered in the framework of particular historical and political circumstances. It is then placed in the context of the local cultural policy, a combination of theory and local political aspirations. The involvement of the external factor – the Guggenheim Foundation – is considered next, followed by an assessment of the museum in both quantifiable and non-quantifiable terms. Lastly, the preference shown in modern art museums to play this role is discussed. It is concluded that the Gug-genheim Bilbao is the outcome of special political and socioeconomic circumstances, which renders it a unique case that should not be replicated uncritically.\n\nThis paper analyses the process by which intangible heritage has gradually been integrated into the conservationists’ awareness. Intangible heritage, whose creative products are expressed in skills, knowledge, and representations, constitutes a challenge for museums, which were conceived, from their start, around the value of objects. Even when these spaces have previously acknowledged the importance of intangible cultural expressions, they have rarely performed the tasks of collecting, conserving, or displaying this kind of heritage. The prevailing perspective in Mexican museums is, to this day, to present them only as part of a ‘glorious past’ –before the Spaniards’ arrival to the continent–so that only recently have museum professionals become interested in the vast amount of traditional knowledge, skills, and activities that indigenous peoples still keep alive, more than 500 years after the Conquest. The conservation of cultural diversity implies not only the sampling of a few c...\n\nThe history and analysis of the development of El Museo del Barrio in New York City clarifies the part that community museums play in the experience of political marginalization. In 2009, El Museo underwent a multi-million dollar renovation. It now seeks to represent the culture of all of Latin Americans and to compete with mainstream museums in the area. However, since El Museo’s original mission was to give a voice to the Puerto Rican and Latin American community in New York, the fact that its mandate is shifting towards global acceptance means that it must reevaluate its role in the community and the community’s needs. This paper argues that El Museo performs an ongoing tactical process of responding to the community’s needs. It suggests that the greatest threat to El Museo’s professional development, now that it has initiated a dialogue with the mainstream, is a loss of authority brought about by forcing a reconsideration of the terms of its foundational identity."
