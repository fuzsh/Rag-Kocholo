        "text": "Jumex is the most popular producer of juice and nectar in Mexico (and within the market of hispanic consumers in the USA). Founded in 1961, Jumex prides itself in being a 100% Mexican company and boasts 10 brands of juices and nectars in different flavors, all targeting specific demographics.\n\nJumex started out with 20 employees, focusing on creating delicious juices and nectars from the best fruit available in the country. Just three years later, in 1964, Jumex launched its first product under the brand Frugo: A 350 ml tin package that rapidly gained popularity as “la latita azul” (the little blue can).In 1973 Grupo Jumex established BOTEMEX, its own manufacturing can facility and launched “Vigor” a can of juice with red typography aimed at the children market. BOTEMEX gave the company the opportunity to innovate in the packaging design process.\n\nIn 1974 Jumex acquired the first evaporating machine in Mexico, marking a major technological breakthrough in the preservation of perishable products by producing juice concentrate that could be stored in containers. Jumex also contributed greatly in other packaging technologies… such as the process of electro sealing using copper."
