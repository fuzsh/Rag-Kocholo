        "text": "Alexander Calder\n\n(1898-1976)\n\nBorn in 1898, Lawnton, Pennsylvania, US\n\nFor a comprehensive chronology, see www.calder.org\n\n22 July or August 1898\n\nCalder is born in Lawnton, Pennsylvania, to Nanette Lederer Calder, a painter, and Alexander Stirling Calder, a sculptor. I always thought I was born—at least my mother always told me so—on August 22, 1898. But my grandfather Milne’s birthday was on August 23, so there might have been a little confusion. In 1942, when I wrote the Philadelphia City Hall for a birth certificate, I sent them a dollar and they told me I was born on the twenty-second of July, 1898. So I sent them another dollar and told them, “Look again.” They corroborated the first statement.\n\nDecember 1909\n\nFor Christmas, Calder presents his parents with a dog and a duck that he trimmed from a brass sheet and bent into formation. The duck is kinetic, rocking back and forth when tapped.\n\nOctober–December 1923\n\nCalder begins classes at the Art Students League of New York, studying life and pictorial composition with John Sloan and portrait painting with George Luks. He studies at the League through December 1925.\n\nWinter 1925\n\nCalder makes hundreds of brush drawings of animals at the Bronx Zoo and the Central Park Zoo. The following year, Animal Sketching, a drawing manual written by Calder with reproductions of 141 of his brush drawings, is published by Bridgman Publishers in New York.\n\nFall 1926\n\nCalder begins creating Cirque Calder, a complex and unique body of art. Fashioned from wire, fabric, leather, rubber, cork, and other materials, Cirque Calder is designed to be performed for an audience by Calder. It develops into a multi-act articulated series of mechanized sculpture in miniature scale, a distillation of the natural circus. Calder is able to travel with his easily transportable circus and hold performances on both continents. Over the next five years, Calder continues to develop and expand this work of performance art to fill five large suitcases.\n\nFall 1926\n\nCalder makes his first formal wire sculptures, Josephine Baker I and Struttin’ His Stuff.\n\nOctober 1930\n\nAccompanied by another American artist, William “Binks” Einstein, Calder visits Mondrian’s studio at 26 rue du Départ. Already familiar with Mondrian’s geometric abstractions, Calder is deeply impressed by the studio environment. It was a very exciting room. Light came in from the left and from the right, and on the solid wall between the windows there were experimental stunts with colored rectangles of cardboard tacked on. Even the victrola, which had been some muddy color, was painted red. I suggested to Mondrian that perhaps it would be fun to make these rectangles oscillate. And he, with a very serious countenance, said: “No, it is not necessary, my painting is already very fast.” This one visit gave me a shock that started things. Though I had heard the word “modern” before, I did not consciously know or feel the term “abstract.” So now, at thirty-two, I wanted to paint and work in the abstract. And for two weeks or so, I painted very modest abstractions. At the end of this, I reverted to plastic work which was still abstract.\n\n27 April–9 May 1931\n\nCalder’s abstract work is presented for the first time in the exhibition “Alexandre Calder: Volumes–Vecteurs–Densités/Dessins–Portraits,” at Galerie Percier, Paris.\n\nFall 1931\n\nMarcel Duchamp visits the studio at 14 rue de la Colonie again and sees Calder’s latest works. There was one motor-driven thing, with three elements. The thing had just been painted and was not quite dry yet. Marcel said, “Do you mind?” When he put his hands on it, the object seemed to please him, so he arranged for me to show in Marie Cuttoli’s Galerie Vignon, close to the Madeleine. I asked him what sort of a name I could give these things and he at once produced “Mobile.” In addition to something that moves, in French it also means motive. Duchamp also suggested that on my invitation card I make a drawing of the motor-driven object and print: CALDER/SES MOBILES.\n\nAfter 12 February 1932\n\nIn response to Duchamp’s term “mobile,” Arp asks sarcastically, Well, what were those things you did last year [for Percier’s]—stabiles? Calder adopts “stabile” to refer to his static works.\n\nAugust 1933\n\nThe Calders visit a real-estate agency in Danbury, Connecticut. After viewing several properties, they discover a dilapidated eighteenth-century farmhouse in Roxbury, Connecticut; both Louisa and Calder claim to have been the first to exclaim, “That’s it!”\n\n23 February–13 March 1937\n\nCalder’s first large-scale bolted stabiles, Devil Fish and Big Bird, are on view in “Calder: Stabiles & Mobiles” at the Pierre Matisse Gallery, New York.\n\nMay 1937\n\nCalder and Miró visit the Spanish pavilion under construction at the 1937 World’s Fair site in Paris. Calder meets the pavilion’s architects, Josép Lluís Sert and Luis Lacasa. Sert eventually commissions Calder to make Mercury Fountain for the Spanish pavilion. Mined in Almadén in Spain, the mercury symbolizes Republican resistance to fascism.\n\n3–25 December 1940\n\n“Calder Jewelry” is presented at Willard Gallery, New York. In her press release for the show, Willard writes, These works of art are savage and deliberate and self-confidently sophisticated . . . This is a master modern artist’s contribution to the history of fashion. For a world already in chains it is superb stuff.\n\n29 September 1943–16 January 1944\n\nThe Museum of Modern Art, New York, presents “Alexander Calder: Sculptures and Constructions,” curated by Sweeney and Duchamp. Calder writes, Simplicity of equipment and an adventurous spirit in attacking the unfamiliar or unknown are apt to result in a primitive and vigorous art. Somehow the primitive is usually much stronger than art in which technique and flourish abound. Originally scheduled to close on 28 November 1943, the exhibition is extended to 16 January 1944 due to public demand.\n\nBefore 3 July 1945\n\nCalder produces a series of small-scale works, many from scraps trimmed during the making of other objects. Let’s mail these little objects to [Louis] Carré, in Paris, and have a show, Duchamp suggests when he sees them; by taking advantage of the newly available international airmail system, Duchamp’s action predates “mail art” by nearly two decades. Carré responds to Duchamp’s proposal. Interested show Calder miniatures would also gladly exhibit mobile sculptures available all sizes and colours.\n\n14–19 June 1952\n\nCalder represents the United States in the XXVI Biennale di Venezia. Sweeney installs the exhibition and writes a short text for the exhibition catalogue. Calder wins the Grand Prize for sculpture.\n\n28 June 1952\n\nCalder accepts the commission from Carlos Raúl Villanueva, whom he met through Sert in 1951, to design an acoustic ceiling for Aula Magna, the auditorium of the Universidad Central de Venezuela. He collaborates with the engineering firm Bolt, Beranek, and Newman, Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\n11 November 1953\n\nThe Calders visit Jean to see his renovated mill house in Saché. Calder agrees to a trade of three mobiles for François Premier, a dilapidated seventeenth-century stone house built adjoining a cliff on Jean’s property.\n\n15 March 1957\n\nThe Committee of Art Advisors at UNESCO approves Calder’s maquette for a standing mobile. Titled Spirale, the mobile top is made by Calder at Segré’s Iron Works in Connecticut and the stabile bottom is made with the collaboration of Jean Prouvé in France.\n\n27 March 1962\n\nIn a letter to Giovanni Carandente, Calder agrees to a proposal to make a sculpture for the Spoleto Festival in Italy. He decides to make “a stabile, which will stand on the ground, + arch the roadway.” His work results in Teodelapio, a monumental stabile, which is completed in August 1962.\n\n6 November 1964–31 January 1965\n\nSolomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York, exhibits “Alexander Calder: A Retrospective Exhibition.” Thomas M. Messer curates the exhibition, which travels to St. Louis, Toronto, Milwaukee, and Des Moines.\n\n14 June 1969\n\nCalder attends the dedication ceremony for La Grande vitesse, a monumental stabile commissioned by the city of Grand Rapids, Michigan, in August 1967. This is the first sculpture to be funded by the public art program of the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA).\n\n14 October 1976–6 February 1977\n\nThe Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, with Jean Lipman as curator, exhibits “Calder’s Universe,” a major retrospective. The exhibition travels to fifteen cities throughout the United States and Japan.\n\n11 November 1976\n\nCalder dies in New York City at the home of his daughter Mary.\n\nSelected Solo Exhibitions\n\nFor a comprehensive list of exhibitions and publications, see www.calder.org\n\n2021\n\nAlexander Calder: Modern from the Start, The Museum of Modern Art, New York, US\n\n2018\n\nAlexander Calder: Theater of Encounters, Fundación Proa, Buenos Aires, Argentina\n\nAlexander Calder: Radical Inventor, Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, Quebec, Canada\n\n2017\n\nCalder: Hypermobility, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, US\n\nCalder: Forgeron des géantes libellules, Musée Soulages, Rodez, France\n\n2015\n\nCalder: Discipline of the Dance, Museo Jumex, Mexico City, Mexico\n\nAlexander Calder: Retrospective, Pushkin Museum, Moscow, Russia\n\nAlexander Calder: Performing Sculpture, Tate Modern, London, UK\n\n2014\n\nAlexander Calder at the Rijksmuseum, Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, The Netherlands\n\nCalder: Jewelry, Kukje Gallery, Seoul, Korea\n\n2013\n\nCalder, Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art, Seoul, Korea\n\nAlexander Calder: Avant-Garde in Motion, Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen, Düsseldorf, Germany\n\nCalder and Abstraction: From Avant-Garde to Iconic, Los Angeles County Museum of Art, California, US\n\n2012\n\nAlexander Calder: De grote ontdekking, Gemeentemuseum, The Hague, The Netherlands\n\nCalder Noir, Kukje Gallery, Seoul, Korea\n\n2011\n\nCalder's Portraits: A New Language, National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution, Washington, D.C., US\n\n2009\n\nAlexander Calder: A Balancing Act, Seattle Art Museum, Washington, US\n\nCalder: Sculptor of Air, Palazzo delle Esposizioni, Rome, Italy\n\n2008\n\nCalder Jewelry, Norton Museum of Art, West Palm Beach, Florida, US\n\nAlexandre Calder en Touraine, Château de Tours, France\n\nAlexander Calder: The Paris Years, 1926–1933, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, US\n\n2006\n\nCalder no Brasil, Pinacoteca do Estato de São Paulo, Brazil\n\n2005\n\nThe Surreal Calder, Menil Collection, Houston, US\n\n2004\n\nCalder: Poetry in Motion, Kukje Gallery, Seoul, Korea\n\n2003\n\nCalder: Gravedad y la Gracia, Fundación del Museo Guggenheim Bilbao, Spain\n\n2001\n\nGrand Intuitions: Calder’s Monumental Sculpture, Storm King Art Center, Mountainville, New York, US\n\n2000\n\nCalder in Connecticut, Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, Connecticut, US\n\nAlexander Calder: Motion and Color, Iwaki City Art Museum, Japan\n\n1998\n\nAlexander Calder: 1898–1976, National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., US\n\n1997\n\nFlying Colors: The Innovation and Artistry of Alexander Calder, San Jose Museum of Art, California, US\n\nCalder, Fundacío Joan Miró, Barcelona, Spain\n\n1995\n\nAlexander Calder: Retrospective, Louisiana Museum of Modern Art, Humlebaek, Denmark\n\n1993\n\nCalder: Mobiles, stabiles, gouaches, bijoux . . ., Musée Picasso, Château Grimaldi, Antibes, France\n\n1991\n\nCelebrating Calder, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, US\n\n1989\n\nCalder Intime, Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris, France\n\n1986\n\nAlexander Calder: An American Invention, Sheldon Memorial Art Gallery, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, US\n\n1983\n\nCalder: Mostra retrospettiva, Palazzo a Vela, Turin, Italy\n\n1976\n\nCalder's Universe, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, US\n\n1975\n\nCalder, Haus der Kunst, Munich, Germany\n\n1974\n\nAlexander Calder: A Retrospective Exhibition, Work from 1925–1974, Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago, Illinois, US\n\n1973\n\nAlexander Calder: Retrospektive, Galerie Maeght, Zurich, Switzerland\n\n1972\n\nCalder's Circus, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, US\n\n1970\n\nA Salute to Alexander Calder, The Museum of Modern Art, New York, US\n\n1969\n\nCalder, Fondation Maeght, Saint-Paul-de-Vence, France\n\n1967\n\nCalder: 19 Gifts from the Artist, The Museum of Modern Art, New York, US\n\n1964\n\nAlexander Calder: A Retrospective Exhibition, Solomon R.
