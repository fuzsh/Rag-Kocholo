All rights reserved, DACS/Artimage 2024. Courtesy of Museo Jumex.\n\nMuseo Jumex Hosts Damien Hirst’s First Retrospective Exhibition in Mexico and Latin America\n\nDamien Hirst’s exhibition “To Live Forever (For a While)” at the Museo Jumex in Mexico City is the artist’s first full retrospective in Mexico and Latin America. The exhibition features over 50 artworks from the renowned British artist and explores life, death, beliefs, matter, and time.\n\nIn March, the Museo Jumex located in Mexico City, Mexico, inaugurated a museum-wide exhibition by the world-renowned British artist Damien Hirst. The exhibit, “ To Live Forever (For A While), ” is Hirst’s first full retrospective both in Mexico and Latin America, and it is on until August 25 in the museum’s plaza and galleries 1, 2, and 3.\n\nThe exhibit dives deeply into Hirst’s works produced from 1986 to 2019. It explores the themes of life, death, beliefs, matter, and time through more than fifty artworks in a wide, varied selection of mediums. “To Live Forever (For A While)” was set to celebrate Museo Jumex’s tenth anniversary.\n\nDamien Hirst photographed by Prudence Cuming Associates Ltd © Damien Hirst and Science Ltd.

Courtesy of Museo Jumex.\n\nAccording to Kit Hammonds, the Museo Jumex’s Chief Curator, Hirst’s retrospective reaffirms the museum’s mission of hosting major exhibitions of some of the world’s major artists who have shaped contemporary art within their own practice and beyond it.\n\n“You could say that Damien Hirst’s exhibition, in particular, follows a series of exhibitions we’ve presented here. I think there’s a lineage you could imagine between Andy Warhol, Jeff Koons, and then Damien Hirst, which are all exhibitions we’ve presented over the past six or seven years,” Hammonds told ArtRKL over a video call.\n\nWithin that series of exhibitions, the museum wants to open up contemporary arts to a broader public that can enjoy the artists and arts’ value. The museum seeks to be as welcoming as possible by creating a more accessible environment for its audience. According to Hammonds, seventy-five percent of the public are first-time visitors to art museums.\n\n“We’re a museum that is free all the time and that’s for the same intention to be welcoming to the public regardless of their background and be able to introduce them to contemporary art,” Hammonds said.\n\nInstallation view, Damien Hirst: To Live Forever (For a While), Museo Jumex, 2024.

Courtesy of Museo Jumex.\n\nWorld Elite Art for Everyone\n\nThe Museo Jumex is a private museum and philanthropic enterprise completely funded independently by its founder, funder, and president, Eugenio López Alonso. López Alonso is a pioneer in the field of contemporary art collection in Mexico and has been recognized for his ongoing support for museums throughout the country.\n\nWhen López Alonso founded the Museo Jumex in November 2013, one of his goals was to offer the broader public an opportunity to visit the museum and discover world-elite art in an accessible manner. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Museo Jumex’s team decided to remove the entrance fee, which used to cost $1.50. They wanted people to actually have something to do and for arts and culture to become an important part of society's welfare.\n\nAfter the COVID-19 pandemic, they continued with the free entrance and created an opportunity for people to enjoy world-elite art from artists like Hirst for no cost. They’ve allowed the audience to see Hirst’s masterpieces as easily as possible.\n\nInstallation view, Damien Hirst: To Live Forever (For a While), Museo Jumex, 2024.

Courtesy of Museo Jumex.\n\nHowever, hosting Hirst’s full and rich retrospective exhibit entailed a long collaborative process between the museum and the artist. According to Hammonds, it implied several years of discussion between Hirst and López Alonso.\n\n“When the founder built this museum, which is about ten years old, he had certain artists in his mind that he wanted to see here in Mexico. I think that was one of the founding ideas. That the museum was built to facilitate exhibitions by these major artists that otherwise are unlikely to be seen here in Mexico. Damien Hirst was amongst those artists,” Hammonds said.\n\nThe Exhibition’s Collaborative Process\n\nThe actual collaboration for the exhibition began two and a half years ago. The museum took an artist-led approach and invited Hirst to propose the main content of the exhibition. There was no curator in the traditional sense. Hirst played a major part, along with the museum’s team made up of Hammond, Begoña Cano, Adriana Kuri Alamillo, and the curatorial advisor Ann Gallagher.\n\nGallagher was invited by the museum as a key person in the exhibition’s creation. For the museum, it was very important to bring in someone who had worked closely with Hirst and had an in-depth understanding of his practice. She curated Hirst’s retrospective at Tate Modern in 2012 and worked with him over many years in different settings.\n\n“And this is in some ways, the first full retrospective of his practice since then. I think the earliest work is from ‘86, which was his student works and following through the most recent works of this exhibition from 2019,” Hammonds said.\n\nGallagher’s in-depth knowledge of Hirst’s work helped the museum’s team provide a broader narrative of his art and how it plays a role within the world’s art history. The exhibition’s creation process implied practical and curatorial considerations.\n\nInstallation view, Damien Hirst: To Live Forever (For a While), Museo Jumex, 2024.

According to Hammonds, it also meant restricting the number of the works because the museum receives a large number of visitors. So, they had to calculate their weight as well.\n\nThe curatorial ones meant selecting the iconic works they wanted exhibited and how they’d speak to each other throughout the museum’s four floors.\n\n“Each floor says when the work comes together. This was very much Damien’s idea. The first floor you enter, which is the largest one, speaks to direct bodily experiences. The second to more institution and spiritual ideas of life. The process that sustains us in life such as religion, family, and also, economy, in some respect,” Hammonds said. “The final main floor has this very specific juxtaposition of the diamond skull, For the Love of God, with a sweet of cherry blossoms. They’re normally not associated with each other, but there’s some very particular relationship.”\n\nInstallation view, Damien Hirst: To Live Forever (For a While), Museo Jumex, 2024.

Courtesy of Museo Jumex.\n\nHirst’s Deeper Relationship With Mexico\n\nCreating new associations between Hirst’s works was part of the experience the museum wanted to generate for the audience. They took advantage of being the first museum in Mexico to host a full and rich retrospective on Hirst as an opportunity to have historical references to his art in a Mexican context.\n\nHirst’s work is often focused around the idea of death. Hammonds stated Hirst speaks of death as a way to look at what our life means because it’s the unimaginable other and that interest is naturally in tune with a tendency in Mexican culture.\n\nHammonds also noted that Hirst’s pieces exhibited in Mexico create an interesting contrast between the view on death in European and Mexican cultures.\n\n“Mexican culture traditionally is kind of open about that; sees it as a continuity of life. Quite distinct from history of the image of death in European culture, which is like a foreboding end,” Hammonds said. “It’s interesting to present the work here because it’s seen in a different association. There’s more of a sense of fascination in those cultural images [in Mexico]. Damien Hirst himself has an interest in Mexican culture for that reason. He’s had a home in Mexico for more than ten years.”\n\nHammond mentioned Hirst’s “Self Portrait X-Ray” artwork directly touches on that subject. It’s a series of x-rays depicting his self-portrait. It touches on Hirst’s interests in medicine and who he is as an artist with a different perspective. The x-rays were made in Mexico, which generate a greater connection with the country.\n\n“Although it’s quite a work off the main body of his practice, it shows that the relationship is just kind of: oh, there are some skulls here and Mexico likes skulls. There’s actually a deeper relationship and understanding between the two cultures,” Hammonds said.\n\nInstallation view, Damien Hirst: To Live Forever (For a While), Museo Jumex, 2024. Photographed by Prudence Cuming Associates Ltd. © Damien Hirst and Science Ltd. All rights reserved, DACS/Artimage 2024. Courtesy of Museo Jumex.\n\nHirst’s piece “For the Love of God,” a sculpture made of a platinum cast of an 18th-century human skull with 8,601 encrusted diamonds, also addresses this theme. It was inspired in part by the turquoise Aztec skull at the British Museum. Hammond said these straightforward connections with death speak directly to Hirst’s interest in Mexican culture, which provided a different entry point to his work in the exhibition.\n\nLight, Life, and Death\n\nThe Mexican cultural references are evident, and the museum’s space also plays a vital role in creating a contrast between the light, Hirst’s colorful artwork, and the themes of life and death. Hammonds noted he was unsure if the bright space and lights were considered to illustrate the themes, but the museum’s natural light generates a new sensation with the artworks.\n\nThe natural light casts the work physically in a different way. You can see the natural light passing through “Mother and Child (Divided),” which, according to Tate, is a “floor-based sculpture comprising four glass-walled tanks, containing the two halves of a cow and calf, each bisected and preserved in formaldehyde solution.” Hammonds mentioned this piece doesn’t have natural light passing through at all times in the spaces in which it has been exhibited.\n\nAnother example Hammonds noted was the diamond skull presented in a different light setting in the Museo Jumex.\n\n“Normally, it’s presented in a dark space as a very iconic object. Very carefully illuminated. Here, it’s within a space with natural light. It’s almost entirely lit by natural light surrounded by the cherry blossom paintings,” Hammonds said. “I think it gives it a strangely humble image. Rather than being a reverential object, it becomes really much closer to a skull than the diamonds. It’s a slightly more human object, which is kind of more interesting.”\n\nInstallation view, Damien Hirst: To Live Forever (For a While), Museo Jumex, 2024.

They let Hirst choose the iconic works for the retrospective. The museum’s team included less well-known pieces to the public and tried not to mediate too much the audience’s experience while providing alternative perspectives about the art.\n\nThey created a sense of wonder and surprise for the visitor to enjoy.\n\n“We tried to create surprises with the pieces that the public would associate directly with Damien Hirst, but also other series or pieces that really haven’t been seen very often and might surprise the public when they get to see the exhibition,” Hammonds said.\n\nIf you want to immerse yourself in Damien Hirst’s iconic artworks such as the spot paintings, the diamond skull, and formaldehyde sculptures, or you simply want to discover his lesser-known works, visit Museo Jumex in Mexico City.
