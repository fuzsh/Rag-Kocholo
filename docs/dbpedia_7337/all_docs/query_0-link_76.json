Spanning rarely seen early works from the 1980s through recent projects, the publication covers Tiravanija’s experimentations with installation, film, works on paper, ephemera, sculpture and participatory works. Designed by Tiffany Malakooti, the publication features more than 600 images—many of which are published for the first time—as well as 23 newly commissioned texts. Longform essays by exhibition curators Ruba Katrib and Yasmil Raymond, as well as scholars Jörn Schafaff, David Teh and Mi You, dive into key aspects of Tiravanija’s work, providing historical context. These texts are complemented by 18 short reflections from artists, thinkers and collaborators who have been key interlocutors with Tiravanija over the years.Edited by Ruba Katrib and Yasmil Raymond, with Jody Graf and Kari Rittenbach.

The buyers of the book become part of a process of value and value generation: Do they choose the bargain with the evaluative addition \"cheap\" on the cover, do they buy the book at the (subsidised) market price, or do they pay the honest price of its socially and ecologically fair production? The unusual and also radical concept follows the interest of the Danish artist group SUPERFLEX in value systems and the emergence shifting of valuations.The exhibition Sometimes As A Fog, Sometimes As A Tsunami by SUPERFLEX at Kunsthaus Graz is focusing on the instability of capitalism inherent in the speculative nature of financial markets and instruments and is examining the dissolving factor of capitalist-oriented action on society. The illustrated book places the works on display in a larger discursive context and locates them in SUPERFLEX's artistic practice from its earliest works to the present.With texts by Barbara Steiner, Martin Grabner, Dirk Raith and Steven Zultanski.Edited by Barbara SteinerPublished by VfmK Verlag für Moderne KunstLanguages: English and GermanISBN: 978-3-903572-78-2 (Cheap price) / 978-3-903572-79-9 (Market price) / 978-3-903572-80-5 (Honest price)152 pagesPrices: € 9.00 / € 28.00 / € 150.00 €Available from 23.02.2022\n\nCracked Actor: Works 2013-2018Jonny NiescheCracked Actor: Works 2013-2018Jonny Niesche’s fascination with colors, mirrors and glitter began back in his childhood in the early 1980s when he and his mother visited the cosmetics section of a department store in Sydney. In the geometrically abstract works by the Australian artist created from 2013 to 2018 and documented in this publication, the aesthetic aspect of the materials used plays a major role. Niesche works with flat, polished, mirrored surfaces, welded steel fittings, fabrics in soft pastel tones, and creates meditative image-objects in which sculptural and pictorial tendencies are combined. In his works based on color and light, the artist experiments with processes of visual perception. Through the glittering and mirroring surfaces, the works involve the viewer? and in this regard Niesche’s objects and installations are reminiscent of American Minimal Art and artists such as Larry Bell, Donald Judd and John McCracken. Furthermore, Niesche’s artistic production is rich in references to the Glam Rock of the 1970s, most notably David Bowie or Debbie Harry.Author: Magdalena ZellerEditor: Magdalena ZellerPublisher: Verlag für Moderne Kunst, 2018ISBN: 3903269379, 9783903269378Length: 136 pages\n\nAnn Veronica JanssensAnn Veronica JanssensAnn Veronica JanssensDistinctive, precise and systematic, the art of Ann Veronica Janssens is unparalleled in contemporary art history. The Belgian artist represents a post-minimalist generation of artists who employ various media of expression to process their perceptions of the world. Working primarily with light, she has created an interwoven oeuvre of installations comprising elements such as fog, sound and moving images, as well as projections, urban interventions and lyrical sculptural pieces. In the history of Light Art, Janssens falls somewhere between foregoing generations of artists such as James Turrell and Carlos Cruz-Diez and successors such as Olafur Eliasson and Haroon Mirza.

This collection—the world’s largest collection of Romanesque sculpture—is unique for its coherence with its well-preserved ensembles of capitals.

This book includes an introduction to the collection of Romanesque sculptures at the museum, an illustrated history of its ever-changing presentation since 1830, an extensive survey of Jorge Pardo’s specific works for museums as well as a brief history of remarkable exhibition designs for museum collections throughout the 20th century.With an interview between Stephen Prina and Jorge Pardo.Published by Hatje CantzHardcover, 160 pages, 171 ills.ISBN 9783775744621\n\nSUPERFLEX - We Are All In The Same BoatSUPERFLEX: We Are All In The Same BoatSUPERFLEXThe catalog to first museum survey of the critically acclaimed Danish collective SUPERFLEX in the United States, this exhibition focuses on the group’s humorous and playfully subversive installations and films, which address the economy, financial crisis, corruption, migration, and the possible consequences of global warming.

This revised, updated edition spotlights the extraordinary evolution of her career, and examines the pivotal role she has played in shaping some of the most fundamental ideas around which contemporary sculpture and painting revolve today.Authors include: Jessica Stockholder, Lynne Tillman, Barry Schwabsky, Lynne Cooke, & Germano CelantPublished by PhaidonHardback, 240 pagesISBN 9780714872070\n\nPaul Winstanley - 59 PaintingsPaul Winstanley59 PaintingsWhat does a painter think about when he or she sets out to make a work? Where do their ideas and inspirations come from? How do they begin to translate those thoughts into a painted image? Taking his own works as a starting-point, award-winning artist Paul Winstanley presents a series of texts that together reveal what it means to conceive, make and think about paintings. Among the varied subjects that he considers are how a painter seeks out and finds inspiration in life and the world; the relationship between observed and depicted realities; what constitutes ‘truth’ in a painting; how to approach conceptual and technical challenges; the role of the viewer in the transaction at the heart of painting; and the various belief systems that lie behind the business of creating and looking at paintings. The result, a rare monograph on the work of an artist written by the artist himself, is an exquisite personal account of the art and craft of making painted images today.

After much time delving into the archive, Banner observed a lack of images relating to conflict in the here and now. In a reversal of roles, Banner commissioned Paolo Pellegrin, a conflict photographer who has worked extensively in the Congo, to observe the City of London – its streets and trading floors, its costume and strip-clubs – through Conrad's Heart of Darkness. The resulting photographs were first exhibited at Peer, London under the title Mistah Kurtz – He Not Dead.A selection of these images now form part of the Archive, they can be found filed under 'Heart of Darkness, 2014'. They also form the illustrations for this new publication of Conrad's novella, which takes the form of a luxury magazine.Heart of Darkness (first published in 1899) is a story of trade and corruption, and of our own conflicts and desires. From a boat moored on the banks of the Thames, Marlow narrates his story in which he travels to the heart of the Congo in search of renegade ivory trader Kurtz, who has mesmerised and enslaved his workers. Like many artists of her generation Banner has lived just outside the boundaries of London's financial district since the early 90s observed the area's close proximity to the Square Mile and its apparent separation from it. This publication links with Banner's first artist book The Nam (1997) that references Apocalypse Now, a film that uses Conrad's text as its narrative template.\n\nFiona Banner - Scroll Down And Keep ScrollingFiona BannerScroll Down Keep ScrollingPublished by The Vanity Press in association with Ikon, Birmingham and Kunsthalle NurembergThis book considers the relevance of the publication in the Internet age.Known or exhibited works are adequately represented on the web, here Banner's work is represented through the ephemera surrounding it, the stuff that is not exhibited. It does not seek to present the work formally or as finite, but as a process.The title 'Scroll Down And Keep Scrolling' refers to the act of looking back historically, but also to something endless. Scrolling down the page is how we read digitally; at the same time it refers to a time before books.The book focuses on informal photographs and related material from an archive spanning the last 30 years. It takes the material form of a large directory, over 800 pages long and typeset in a font designed especially for this project, titled Font. The font is an amalgamation of typefaces Banner has worked with previously, through full stop sculptures and typeset and published works: \"It's a family tree arrangement where the child of Avant Garde and Courier mates with Peanuts and Didot's child. Bookman and Onyx mate; their child mates with Capitalist and Klang's offspring – the final font is an unpredictable bastardisation of styles and behaviours.\"ISBN: 978-1907631573Softcover, 832 pages\n\nJan Albers - cOlOny cOlOrJan Albers cOlOny cOlOrThis catalog accompanies the exhibition \"cOlOny cOlOr\" at Von der Heydt-Museum Wuppertal and Kunstpalais ErlangenPublished by Verlag Kettler, Dortmund 2015ISBN: 978-3-86206-455-7Hardcover, 176 pages\n\nFiona Banner - Wp Wp WpFiona BannerWp Wp Wp, 2014Published by the Vanity Press, London and Yorkshire Sculpture ParkISBN: 978-1-907631-55-9Softcover, 160 pages\n\nSUPERFLEX - The Corrupt Show and the Speculative MachineSUPERFLEXThe Corrupt Show and the Speculative MachineThis catalogue was published on the occasion of The Corrupt Show and the Speculative Machine, a survey exhibition of SUPERFLEX curated by Patrick Charpenel and Daniel McClean at Fundacion/Coleccion Jumex.Book No. 1: The Corrupt Show (360 pages) Book No. 2: The Speculative Machine (Archive), Insert No. 1: Contracts (8 pages), Insert No. 2: Supergas (12 pages).

The wedge (in Danish: kilen) is structured along three spatial zones (red, black and green) and populated by 108 objects and 11 trees from all over the world.Since its inception, Superkilen has been widely and controversially debated. The book invites readers behind the scenes of its making through the reflections of its main protagonists. It discusses the implications of the project in relation to changes in conception of public space and to conflicts, and discusses the possibilities of a shared, yet heterogeneous space. By providing first hand and background information about Superkilen, the artists hope to further stimulate public discourse on the project.Publisher: Arvinius + Orfeus Publishing, Stockholm / OsloISBN 9789187543029Softcover, 224 pages\n\nAnn Veronica Janssens - SerendipityAnn Veronica Janssens SerendipityThis publication derives from Ann Veronica Janssens' solo exhibition at WIELS, entitled Serendipity, constructed around a set of works outlining her artistic research over the last few decades.

During the late 1970s, Jack Goldstein helped initiate an avant-garde art movement informally known as the \"Pictures Generation.\" Along with fellow artists such as Sherrie Levine, Robert Longo, and Troy Brauntuch, Goldstein merged the concerns of Conceptual art with media issues raised by Pop art and helped initiate a paradigm shift in art that focused on the critical examination of images. Goldstein's films of the mid-1970s, among his most recognized achievements, appropriated and restaged imagery that referenced its media sources. This companion volume to a new retrospective of Goldstein's work, organized by the Orange County Museum of Art, includes stills from these films as well as reproductions of sculptures, records, installations, paintings, and text-based works to show the breadth of his artistic production.

For this book, Charline von Heyl has assembled paintings made on the old and the new continent: in Germany at the beginning of the 1990s and in New York since 1996.The book of lined up paintings, spread just about chronologically, is the first to really hold forth since it observes the paintings from a dual point of view: the rather objective colour reproduction with margins vis-à-vis the more determining and selective extract (far more than a detail) which is magnified, in black and white, and manipulated by the artist revealing the graphic structure of the paintings.What happens when colours fall off the next page and a large starkly black and white surface only reveals a perfectly cropped extract? Suddendly the paintings are stripped to the bones, in uncomfortable close-ups, they unveil their structure. This becomes inevitably graphic but as it is followed through systematically throughout the entire body of work, it creates a syntax which highlights the process (without removing the pleasure) of the face to face confrontation with the actual painting.Edited by Charline von Heyl and Franck Gautherot.Texts by Franck Gautherot, Mark von Schlegell, Diedrich Diederichsen, Allison Katz.

The exhibition and catalogue feature the new work Sea Beast (2010), which was commissioned by The Power Plant as a part of our Annual Commissioning Program begun in 2006. Sea Beast is a large-scale tapestry featuring an image of a found macrame wall hanging, which signals a new visual direction in her work - its source is a three-dimensional scan of a woven form that includes mussel shells, a price tag and tassels. Blown up and transformed, its own weave interpreted within another, the macrame simultaneously escapes and retains the sub-cultural associations that previously defined it. This eighty-page hardcover catalogue is designed by White and Juliette Bellocq who previously collaborated with the artist on her catalogue, Pae White: Lisa Bright and Dark. The catalogue features an overview of White's exhibition with a specific focus on Sea Beast. Along with high-resolution images of this and past exhibitions, this catalogue includes a visual overview of White's ever-evolving practice, and a cloth cover with a foil treatment that reflects the pattern White produced for her piece, Future Fabric (2010). Alongside the unique cover and stunning images is an insightful essay by German professor, art historian, art critic, and curator Oliver Zybok, as well as an incisive and frenetic take on White's tapestries by writer Susan Emerling.

Edition of 1000 of which 20 signed and numbered deluxe editions plus 4 artist's proofs, include an original drawing and collage of Jessica Stockholder's \"Sex Poem\", Rubber up Behind the Eye Balls. ISBN: 978-2-9533912-2-0 ABC TASTE, The Perfect Guest is a multivalent romp through an adult's ABC primer at speed. Taste is an expansive concept that evokes thoughts on decorum, olfactory sensations, flavor and likability. For the cover, Stockholder prints a photomontage in mauve onto the tactile surface of \"Skinplast\" - a rubbery substance that invites touch. The armatures that pull Taste together are the alphabet, the inventive repetitive of a cut-out hole, and the attendant artist's word poem, The Perfect Guest. Taste is built on a pretext of overlapping systems. Poetry, alphabet and word play jockey with the languages of collage, wax crayons, and fluorescent colors. Within the tangle of entry points, there lies a nonchalant precision, the coherence of Stockholder's exacting working process, and a gutsy beauty\n\nRirkrit Tiravanija - Cook BookBorn in Buenos Aires in 1961, contemporary artist Rirkrit Tiravanija resides in New York, Berlin and Chiang Mai, Thailand. His installations often take the form of stages or rooms for sharing meals, cooking, reading or playing music; architecture or structures for living and socialising are a core element in his work. The Cook Book contains 23 recipes, previously performed in museums and galleries throughout the world. All were cooked once more in his Chiang Mai kitchen and documented in the photographs by Antoinette Aurell. In addition, an essay by Thomas Kellein of the Kunsthalle Bielefeld and an extended interview between him and the artist shed additional light on Rirkrit's work. Through this book the reader will understand more of what moves the artist as well as being able to cook such Thai staples from Pad Thai to Flaming Morning Glory, as well as new interpretations of Swedish, German and Spanish classics such as meatballs, Fladlesoup and Paella.

Each of the new works which make up Dead Star Light takes shape using different technology - 16mm film, reel-to-reel audio and video - and each considers its material form from a structural standpoint. The works build on one another, and a number of common themes emerge (flight, alienation, erasure) which gain resonance when the projects are taken together as a whole.

Elsa Longhauser's forward sets the stage for Diana Thater and Pernilla Holmes' enlightened discussion in 'These Tricks Are Not Easy'. Thater and Holmes' expansive conversation on the elusion of making art, cinema and magic creates a rich understanding of the artists practice. Helen Varola's essay 'Rabbit As If In a Hat' examines the origin of \"pulling a rabbit out of a hat\" and it cultural meaning today. The color illustrations through out chronicle Diana Thater's making of Between Science and Magic from the original shot with magician Greg Wilson and Josephine to the stunning French rococo movie palace of Los Angeles Theatre and finally the presentation of Between Science and Magic at the Santa Monica Museum of Art and David Zwirner.

It looks simple enough. [...] There are so many routes into the image, so many points of recognition within the composition, and yet you do not know where to begin and, for that matter, where to close off or frame your reading. In Paul Winstanley s work the image is defined according to a frame of perception, where the image exists both to represent a scene witnessed, and to convey a position for the viewer within that.

While public protests and mass demonstrations are often associated with the politics of the 1960s, Tiravanija's ongoing project reconsiders their relevance in today's political climate. The Demonstration Drawings provide a perspectival view of collective actions, political protests, and popular sovereignty movements worldwide turning ephemeral images of strife and social conflict into documents of political aspiration.

Her photographs take the complete opposite approach to the famous Dusseldorf school of photographers which include Thomas Struth and Andreas Gursky. While they record their subjects in sharply objective archival detail, Barth's images of interiors, buildings, suburban roads or natural environments are often out of focus, perversely cropped and apparently empty of any foreground subject. Yet what emerges from this reduction and abstraction of subject matter is a body of photographs of extraordinary, haunting beauty, evocative of great moments in the history of painting, from Vermeer to Whistler, or of a cinematic ambience such as the fume-laden neon haze of Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver.

They are taken from sources as disparate as: parking restrictions, the Ten Commandments, the standing order of the House of Commons, hankie colour codes, Birkenstock care tips and the detoxification diet. By displacing these rules from their social and political context Bulloch reveals their 'man-made structure' as well as a society that, in order to maintain a stable social structure, imposes regulations and controls on every conceivable form of activity. As such, the book forms an intriguing snapshot of society at the close of the twentieth century.

Around half were drawn by people who actually live in Southern California. These tend to trace commutes, diagram neighborhoods, and mark the locations of events and environments significant in the lives of their makers. The rest were made by visitors from all over the world - Australia, Mexico, Hungary, New Jersey. These start to picture the idea of a Los Angeles that precedes it: palm trees and traffic, surfers and freeways, Baywatch, money and grids. Taken together these chance encounters begin to describe a place at once real and imagined. And in drawing from the generosity of strangers at LAX, the project hopes to disturb the instrumental logic of the airport, itself a non-place, where the only reason you visit is to get yourself somewhere else.

Winstanley works with a range of subtle effects taken from photographic technologies. Particularly notable are the digital-like shifts in saturation that play out over a number of the works, where it sometimes feels, when walking from one canvas to the next, as though the brightness has been turned up on the world. Drained of colour, the artificial light from fluorescent lamps travels across the steel and glass construction, drawing our eyes along the empty passage.

It is in this space that Barth begins her investigation into the very nature of perception, where the epistemological importance of such formal qualities as lighting and composition becomes astoundingly evident. Uta Barth: In Between Spaces is the first comprehensive book on Barth's oeuvre, presenting a carefully selected survey of her works, and as such is a must-have for viewers, collectors and students attracted to contemporary art and photography. The poetic resonance, radical intelligence and sheer beauty of Barth's pictures are given perfect illustration in this book, designed with the artist herself. Uta Barth's work is represented in numerous public and private collections worldwide, including the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Guggenheim Museum, and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York; the Tate Gallery, London; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago; and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles.

This book, also entitled Disappearing, examines the theme of disappearance in the works of Burden and his contemporaries, Bas Jan Ader and Jack Goldstein, in 1970s Southern California. Loosely affiliated, these three artists shared an interest in themes of disappearance and self-effacement. In 1972, Goldstein buried himself alive during a performance, while during Ader's tragic last work, In search of the miraculous (1975), the artist vanished crossing the Atlantic. Responding to cultural pressures like the Vietnam War and the nascent field of feminist art, the artists used \"disappearing\" as a response to the masculine anxiety of the 1970s. This book reveals a fascinating intersection between major figures at a critical turning point for Californian art. 2019\n\nFiona Banner - The NamThe Nam is a 1000 page all text flick book.

Creating a new all–embracing installation that aims to undermines the traditional conventions that usually dictate how objects are displayed and presented into museums, Stockholder picked a series of pieces from the Museum’s collection and mixed them with her own works, exploring how the meaning of things can shift depending on context, and inviting the juxtaposition of others’ work to inflect the meaning of her own. As for Stockholder’s previous works, Stuff Matters is the result of a playful process through which the artist collected things and then assembled them, rewriting new meanings and directions. As a result of a sincere, open and non–hierarchical attitude towards the world, Stuff Matters raises questions about the different relationships that tie objects that belong to different contexts, and ends to stimulate imagination and fantasy life. 2019\n\nAnn Veronica Janssens - Hot Pink Turquoise Ann Veronica JanssensHOT PINK TURQUOISEThe exhibition introduces the work of Belgian artist Ann Veronica Janssens.

A tie-in catalog to a major exhibition at Paris’s Centre Pompidou, this volume explores the fundamental role women artists played in the development of abstract art in the twentieth century. In this rich, sweeping collection, editors Christine Macel and Karolina Lewandowska bring together more than one hundred artists in painting, sculpture, dance, applied arts, photography, film, and performing arts.Understanding that abstract art must be looked at in the light of the artists’ political and personal surroundings, this volume dives into the creation and reception of these artworks over time. From the symbolist abstraction of Hilma af Klint, now widely regarded as the first abstract artist, and the sensual abstraction of Huguette Caland, to the purist non-objective approach of Verena Loewensberg, each artist’s relationship to abstraction is examined. These artworks are presented with thought- provoking essays by esteemed critics, contextualizing and exploring the subjects and themes of the movement.Ultimately, this volume questions the legitimacy of the notion of “female artists” and presents this group as simply artists, full of complexities and paradoxes.”ISBN-10: 0500094373344 pages, Hardcover\n\nPetra Cortright Petra CortrightKnown for her video works available on YouTube and in galleries, and for her leading role in the creation of “Net art,” Los Angeles-based artist Petra Cortright (born 1986) experiments with the imagery of physical bodies in digital spaces, exploiting the main formal properties of video software. Her videos have at times proved controversial (such as her works with strippers in VirtuaGirl), at times heralded and lauded.Cortright is also known for her paintings created with digital software, mixing concrete and abstract elements and printed on a wide variety of material. Such works are the product of an experimentation with Photoshop layers on a so-called “mother file,” enriched with the use of digital tools and then manipulated through industrial printing techniques.This first monograph on her work includes writings on Cortright by fellow artists Martine Syms and Paul Chan, and by MoMA curatorial assistant Giampaolo Bianconi.

This sort of clearing – as in the clearing of land for development – seeks to eradicate the messy variety of that which already exists in order to impose order and progress.In this book – produced by Stolon Press in association with the Art Gallery of New South Wales as part of Simryn Gill’s commission for the Sydney Modern Project – an alternative type of clearing is presented, one that does not seek to contain and erase, but rather to unfold and unwrap.This mode of clearing is enacted through words and images. The words take the form of undisciplined anecdotes, just-so stories, and silly questions. The images are rough impressions, rubbings, and a swirling mass of photographs, drawings and photocopies. Their contents are the discarded objects of daily life in the Australian colony – decaying paperwork, fallen date palms, ibises.\n\nBecoming Palm is the outcome of a conversation between two friends, artist Simryn Gill and anthropologist Michael Taussig, addressing the complexities of palm oil and “the enormous transformations, human, and ecological, that this crop engenders” (Taussig) in two disparate geographical locations, Southeast Asia and South America.\n\nPublisher: MER. Paper Kunsthalle104 pages19cm × 24cmFormat: Paperback2016ISBN: 9789492321374On the occasion of the exhibition The (Hemi)Cycle of Leaves and Paper at the Ghent Museum of Fine Arts, Malaysian artist Simryn Gill brings out an artist book entitled \"Wormholes\". At its core are subtle black and white photographs that trace the delicate remains of life in a building that slowy and gradually turns into ruin. Textual interventions by the artist guide the reader towards an atmosphere that is filled with subtle impressions.\n\nHere art grows on trees features Simryn Gill’s latest works commissioned for the Australian Pavilion at the 55th Venice Biennale. Edited by the exhibition curator, Catherine de Zegher, this limited edition monograph includes more than 100 artwork plates printed on different paper stocks that demonstrate the generative and cyclic nature in Gill’s remarkable oeuvre of quotidian beauty. The essays by leading international thinkers and writers include: Catherine de Zegher (On Line. Drawing Through the Twentieth Century, MoMA); Carol Armstrong (Scenes in a Library, MIT Press); Lilian Chee (Conserving Domesticity, ORO Editions); Ross Gibson (26 Views of a Starburst World, UWA Press); Kajri Jain (Gods in the Bazaar, DUP Books); Brian Massumi (Semblance and Event, MIT Press); and Michael Taussig (What Color is The Sacred? UCP).Contributors: Catherine de Zegher, Carol Armstrong, Lilian Chee, Ross Gibson, Kajri Jain, Brian Massumi, Michael Taussig,\n\nAuthors: Jessica Morgan, Russell Storer, Michael TaussigPublisher: Walther KoenigSimryn Gill is interested in how we understand our place in the world, and each other, through things. Since the early 1990s, she has translated a wide array of materials, objects and sites into artworks that question time, history, place and the micropolitics of daily life.By photographing, casting, collecting, tearing and arranging things she has found, bought, and been given, Gill opens up the operations of material culture and explores the ways that meaning transforms and translates into different contexts. This publication is the first monograph to be published on this significant artist, whose subtle, humorous and powerful works have been exhibited around the world.Published in collaboration with the Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney, this catalogue features writing by curators Jessica Morgan and Russell Storer and anthropologist Michael Taussig, as well as three visual essays featuring a selection of images from the past two decades, providing a richly textured, idiosyncratic overview of Gill’s practice.\n\nPearls is a full colour photographic record of Simryn Gill’s ongoing bead-making project which she began in 1999. The book brings together over sixty sets of beads, each hand-rolled from torn pages of books given to the artist by friends and acquaintances from titles such as Gandhi’s autobiography, Freud’s essay on Anxiety and the manual Ikebana for Beginners. The compelling beauty of Pearls wrestles with the disturbing reality that each set of beads exists at the expense of a book’s destruction. The transformation of books into beads ponders what is gained and what is lost when objects or bodies of knowledge are traded, exchanged and circulated. Gill gifts each set of beads back to the person who gave her the book, completing, in her words, a ‘transaction’ that lies at the heart of the Pearls project. Whether or not these hand rolled beads are curious artefacts, items of jewellery, artworks or paper garlands, Gill's book project ultimately makes us think about where these categories begin and end."
