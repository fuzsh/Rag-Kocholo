        "text": "Designed by British practice David Chipperfield Architects, the highly anticipated Museo Jumex threw open its doors in Mexico City this week. The museum is a new home for one of the most significant private contemporary art collections in Latin America today, Colecci칩n Jumex. Neatly positioned within the city's upscale Polanco neighbourhood, the building sits opposite the Fernando Romero-designed Soumaya Museum and the recently unveiled Telcel Theatre.\n\nChipperfield's firm is said to have conceived the museum with 'distinctive shapes and materials that honour its origin and surroundings'. Vast floor-to-ceiling windows, framed in stainless steel, open the interior up towards the city, while travertine coatings and columns have been inserted with indigenous traditions in mind.\n\nThe museum features generous amounts of public space as well as a careful consideration for light: plenty of natural daylight enhances the primary exhibition spaces on the top floors. Social spaces, meanwhile, are located on lower levels in the building.\n\nFounded by Eugenio L칩pez Alonso, the collection of seasoned contemporary art includes international art stars like Paul McCarthy, Doug Aitken, Jeff Koons and Francis Alys, as well as local names like Gabriel Kuri. Working with these great pieces is a pair of renowned international curators, Patrick Charpenel and Rosario Nadal, who will serve as director and deputy director of Fundaci칩n Jumex, respectively.\n\nThe museum opens with a trio of inaugurating shows: a major exhibition from the permanent Jumex collection; a James Lee Byars retrospective co-curated by Peter Eleey of MoMA PS1; and a major outdoor installation by celebrated Mexican artist Damian Ortega.\n\nADDRESS\n\nMuseo Jumex\n\nMiguel De Cervantes Saavedra 303\n\nColonia Ampliacion Granada\n\n11529 Mexico City"
