Organized by Patricia Marshall, who has played an influential role in the formation of the collection, the exhibition brings together works within four thematic sections: migration and liberty; the human body; its environment; and the irrepressible and forever incomplete passage of time.\n\nThrough the works of more than 40 international artists, On the Razor’s Edge approaches these urgent issues faced in the contemporary world and the precariousness of life within it. Together, On the Razor’s Edge acts as a meditation on these struggles as individual, a society, and as part of the world and time in which we live together.\n\nAmong the artists included are Carlos Amorales, Mark Dion, Isa Genzken, Dan Graham, Damien Hirst, Alfredo Jaar, Danh Vo, whose practices that explore psychological and physical conditions of life in these uncertain times, where manmade and natural forces are in constant tension.\n\nFounded in 2001, la Colección Jumex is one of the most significant private collections of contemporary art in Latin America with more than 3000 works. The exhibition provides a reading of the collection that represents its breadth, currency, and international perspective."
