        "text": "About\n\nBritish Labour Party politician who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1997 to 2007 and was a staunch U.S. ally during the War on Terror. Forty-three years old when he was elected, he was the youngest Prime Minister of the UK since 1812. He was also the Labour Party's longest-serving Prime Minister.\n\nBefore Fame\n\nHe lived in Australia for a few years while his father was a professor there.\n\nTrivia\n\nHe resigned from office in 2007 after his popularity dropped significantly because of public disapproval of the Iraq War, which many feel he misled Parliament about.\n\nFamily Life\n\nHis father, Leo Blair, was a law lecturer at the University of Durham. He married Cherie Blair in 1980 and he has three sons named Euan, Nicky, and Leo and a daughter named Kathryn.\n\nAssociated With"
