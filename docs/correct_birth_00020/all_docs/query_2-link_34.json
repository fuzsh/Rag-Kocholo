        "text": "Nevertheless, he also garnered plenty of criticism, especially over his handling of the Iraq war, and therefore his legacy is hotly debated to this day.\n\nTony Blair Background\n\nTony Blair, born Anthony Charles Lynton Blair, was born in 1958 to Scottish parents. After studying law at Oxford University, Blair became active in politics during the mid-1970s. In 1983, he was elected the Labour MP for Sedgefield, a constituency near Durham, north England.\n\nBlair became leader of the Labour Party in 1994, after the sudden death of the previous leader John Smith. As leader, Blair very successfully modernised the Labour Party, his own youth and lively character making the Labour Party appealing to a public who were tired of a Conservative government.\n\nTony Blair became Prime Minister in 1997, defeating the Conservatives in a landslide victory. He remained Prime Minister until his resignation in 2007.\n\nTony Blair Labour\n\nWhen Tony Blair became the leader of the Labour Party in 1997, it marked the dawn of a new era for the movement. Through a process of modernisation, Tony Blair transformed the party into 'New Labour' - a dynamic, youthful party that promised to change Britain.\n\n'New Labour'\n\nThese were the key focus points of the Labour Party's ideological shift:\n\nNationalisation, formerly a key Labour policy, was to be abandoned as a main focus for the party.\n\nMPs were to avoid mentioning socialism in connection with the Labour Party so as not to scare people away.\n\nLabour adopted a business-centric politics.\n\nLegal restrictions on trade unions were maintained.\n\nLabour would stop presenting their policies in terms of a class struggle.\n\nLabour would form closer ties with Europe and maintain Britain's 'special relationship' with the USA.\n\nAfter 18 years of a Conservative government, this new Labour ideology appealed not only to their traditional voter base in the working classes, but also tempted those who were disillusioned with the Conservative party after Margaret Thatcher and the scandals under John Major.\n\nThe 1997 General Election\n\nWith an expanded voter base and a more appealing ideology, Labour defeated the Conservatives in a landslide victory in the 1997 general election. Around 10% of voters changed their votes from Conservative to Labour, and the Labour Party gained more votes in almost every demographic.\n\nIt was a huge victory for the Labour Party and, crucially, proved that Tony Blair's modernisation programme had worked.\n\nCharacter and Popularity\n\nAlthough his programme of modernisation helped market 'New Labour' to the British public, Tony Blair himself was one of the main selling points for the party.\n\nJohn Major, the current Prime Minister, was seen as a competent but thoroughly dull man. Blair, on the other hand, was relatively young and had a charming, lively personality, making him far more appealing. This helped sell the image of a tired, old Conservative party in need of replacement by a vibrant, reformed Labour Party.\n\nSpin Doctors\n\nA key feature of Tony Blair's style of government was his use of spin doctors. Essentially, their job was to make sure government policies were presented to the public in the best possible light - 'spinning' the story to make the government look good. However, they differed from a regular press team because they could influence and shape government policy.\n\nThe most prominent spin doctors were Alistair Campbell and Peter Mandelson - they both worked in Tony Blair's election campaign and helped promote his image to the public. Campbell, in particular, was so influential in Blair's government that he was nicknamed 'the real Deputy Prime Minister'.\n\nHowever, the use of spin doctors was controversial. They used manipulative and deceptive tactics to force good press coverage of the government and its policies, leading to a rise in distrust of politicians and the media.\n\nTony Blair Prime Minister\n\nTony Blair's era as Prime Minister spanned ten years, and included several key policies and global crises.\n\nTony Blair Policies\n\nTony Blair was fortunate in that he had been left a decently strong economy by the Conservatives. This meant he was able to focus on delivering the promises he made during the election campaign, rather than solving a financial crisis. On the whole, Labour's economic policies were successful.\n\nLabour's aims were to spend more money improving public services and the welfare state; this was very popular, but came at a cost. Equally, the Chancellor Gordon Brown made some blunders, especially when dealing with the international economy, that had serious implications. It is also debated whether Gordon Brown could have been so successful if he had not inherited a strong economy from the Conservatives.\n\nWho was Gordon Brown?\n\nGordon Brown was the Chancellor in Tony Blair's government. Initially, he and Blair had been rivals in the Labour leadership contest, but worked well together in Blair's government. After Tony Blair resigned in 2007, Gordon Brown became the new leader of the Labour Party and the next Prime Minister.\n\nExpenditure and Borrowing\n\nDuring the first term of Tony Blair's leadership, Gordon Brown made very prudent financial decisions in order to make Britain wealthier and stop the rise of inflation.\n\nAfter a few years of this, Brown turned around and increased government expenditure through investing into health, education and social care services. This was something that Labour had promised to do, was certainly needed and had many benefits for the country - however, it also had the effect of increasing inflation.\n\nGordon Brown also borrowed a lot of money from foreign bankers to pay for Labour policies. This was not so much of an issue until 2007, when it was clear and economic recession was coming. If a country's industry is propped up on foreign loans, then they will be affected when that funding is taken away as other countries shore up their own finances to protect themselves during the recession. This meant the UK's economic growth and revenue would fall in the period where it needed to rise more than ever.\n\nPensions\n\nOne of the ways that Gordon Brown built up Britain's financial reserves was through taxing the pension system. He raised the tax on the money people received from the government for their pension - this meant that the value of people's pension fell rapidly. By the end of Tony Blair's leadership in 2007, the amount pensioners lost through the tax totalled £8 billion.\n\nThis was not easily forgotten by the public, and contributed to the downturn in Labour's popularity towards the end of Tony Blair's leadership.\n\nEmployment\n\nOne of the proudest achievements of the Blair government was that it had increased employment, with 2.9 million more people in work in 2007 than in 1997. However, this was a rather superficial achievement. Employment growth had not happened where it was most needed, amongst unskilled workers and young people. By 2007, there were still 5.4 million people who were unemployed and relying on benefits to survive.\n\nIn addition, many of the jobs created in this period were in the public sector - this meant these were jobs in the government or government-controlled institutions. This led to accusations that Labour was trying to create a client state in which so many people depended on the Labour government for their jobs that they would not vote against it.\n\n'Golden Brown'\n\nGordon Brown also took the controversial decision to sell off a large portion of the UK's gold reserves, since the price of gold had fallen between 1999 and 2002. Other countries, China in particular, bought up millions of ounces of gold for their own reserves in this period.\n\nBy 2005, gold prices were well on the way to recovery. The outcome of Brown's actions was that the UK lost around £3 billion in assets, whereas countries like China had made a tidy profit. Brown was widely criticised for his actions, the tabloids giving him the nickname 'Golden Brown' in memory of his failure - The Scotsman, a newspaper, described Brown's actions as a 'disastrous foray into international asset management'.\n\nConstitutional Issues\n\nSeveral issues concerning the structure of the UK as well as the UK government were raised during Tony Blair's leadership.\n\nDevolution\n\nIn their election manifesto, Labour had committed themselves to Devolution for Wales and Scotland. Devolution is the delegation of power from a country's central government to smaller states within the country.\n\nThe Scottish Parliament was created in 1999 to serve as a devolved government for Scotland, and the Welsh Assembly was also created in 1999 to serve as the devolved government for Wales.\n\nWhile Devolution gave Scotland and Wales more control over their own countries, it was not a sign that Tony Blair or his government supported full independence for either of them. Breaking up the union was a step too far for the Labour Party - both Scotland and Wales were Labour strongholds. If they were no longer part of the UK, there was no chance of Labour ever holding power again.\n\nReforming the House of Lords\n\nTony Blair had also committed to reforming the House of Lords, in order to ensure that unelected hereditary peers could not hold seats in the House.\n\nHouse of Lords\n\nThe upper legislative house of the UK parliament. It consists of peers, who hold noble titles. It can scrutinise and debate bills from the House of Commons, but it cannot prevent them from passing.\n\nTony Blair wanted to end the right of unelected hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords - instead ensuring that the House would be filled with people appointed by the government who had a diverse range of expertise to help scrutinise bills and offer advice. The House of Lords Reform Bill passed in 1999, leading to the expulsion of all but 92 hereditary peers from the House. Tony Blair then began appointing new peers who supported New Labour - this was criticised as an attempt to flood the House with people who would support him in order to consolidate Labour's power.\n\nDid you know? Tony Blair created more peers during 4 years of his leadership than the Conservatives had in the 18 years they were in power!\n\nTony Blair and Europe\n\nThe debate about the UK's place in Europe and the European Union had been a hot topic since Britain's entry in 1973, and Tony Blair's leadership was no different. There were multiple issues that Blair faced concerning Europe, and many of them were left unsolved.\n\nThe 'Third Way'\n\nConcerning the EU, British politicians were divided into two camps - one side wanted closer ties with Europe as they thought that would be beneficial for Britain; the other side wanted to stay away from Europe for fear of Britain losing its sovereignty and becoming part of an EU 'superstate'.\n\nIn a speech in Warsaw, Tony Blair made the argument that a 'third way' could be found - one in which EU member states kept their sovereignty, but came together over matters of international security, trade and diplomacy.\n\nBlair's vision was idealistic, but fated to never come to be. The leaders of other EU member states were not very swayed by his idea - in reality, they were simply waiting for Britain to 'fall in line' and accept the rules that had been laid out.\n\nPressures from the EU\n\nThere were several other crisis points concerning the EU that Blair faced. The table below gives a brief overview of the issues and their impact.\n\nIssueExplanationActionImpactThe rebateThe rebate was the amount of Britain's EU membership fee that Britain was paid back by the EU annually. This was not popular with other EU states.When the EU expanded to include some Eastern European states in 2004, Tony Blair said that Britain would pay its share to help expand, but would not give up Britain's rebate to do so. However, the other member states banded together to demand that Britain pay more. Eventually in 2006, Blair relented and agreed to their demands. After Blair's re-negotiation of the rebate, Britain's annual contribution to the EU rose to £7 billion. This angered many, who argued that such a huge sum of money could be put to better use in Britain, building schools, hospitals and improving infrastructure.The EuroIn 2002, all but 3 EU states adopted the Euro as a common currency. Tony Blair believed that Britain should adopt the euro, as it would help give Britain more power in Europe. Tony Blair was so certain that the Euro would be good for Britain that he wanted to hold a referendum, so the people could give their opinion. However, the Chancellor Gordon Brown decreed that the Euro did not pass the economic tests, so it would not work for Britain.Those who opposed Britain having closer ties with the EU really disliked Blair's strong desire to join the Euro. It also stopped Blair's hopes of Britain gaining more power in the EU.\n\nTony Blair War\n\nTony Blair kept to his pledge of maintaining the special relationship between Britain and the USA. He got on very well with the US President at the time, George W. Bush - they grew even closer after the September 11 terrorist attacks.\n\nThe Special Relationship is a term used to describe the political, diplomatic, economic and legal relations between the United Kingdom and the United States of America.\n\nAfterwards, Blair pledged that Britain would play a key role in the 'War on Terror\". Blair committed his government to drive out the Taliban in Afghanistan and, in March 2003, he involved British troops in the US-Iraqi War.\n\nThe War on Terror\n\nThe military campaign led by the USA, UK and their allies against organisations identified by them as terrorists, after the September 11 attacks in New York. This phrase is primarily used to refer to the fight against so-called 'Islamic' terrorist organisation\n\nTony Blair Iraq\n\nOn the 20 of March 2003, American and British forces began the invasion of Iraq without formal UN sanction and, for Tony Blair, without the majority support of his government, the opposition party or the British people. This invasion was justified by a report which presented evidence that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. Many protests erupted over Blair's decision and some of his cabinet even resigned.\n\nDuring Blair's leadership, many questions began to emerge about the justifications for this war, as the physical evidence of Iraq's weapons programme failed to appear. The main question came in July 2003, following the suicide of Dr David Kelly. Dr Kelly had worked as an expert in the Ministry of Defence and was one of the main proponents who argued that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. His sudden death led to a virulent cry for answers.\n\nThe British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa.'\n\n- President George W. Bush, State of the Union address, January 2003.1\n\nBlair soon found himself in the hot seat, as before Kelly took his life he admitted to a British journalist that he thought the government had exaggerated the claim's about Hussein's weapons programme in order to justify an invasion. Indeed, the Iraq dossier that was supposed to have evidence of weapons of mass destruction, was clearly faked.\n\nImpact of the Iraq War\n\nTony Blair's eagerness to follow the USA into battle came with severe reprisals for his popularity and perception. Although he had some supporters, Blair's decision was controversial with the British public, the Conservative party and even with many in his own party.\n\nThe campaign was, in part, successful, and Saddam Hussein was removed from power and captured for good in September 2003. However, thanks to poor planning for the aftermath, it did not bring peace. With Hussein gone, rival factions within Iraq began jostling for power, essentially beginning a civil war and the UK and USA were forced to remain in Iraq to try and quell the fighting. The war continued until 2011, claiming the lives of countless innocent civilians.\n\nImpact on the UK\n\nThe London Bombings on 7 July 2005 brought the reality of terrorism to the British public, when four explosions in London killed 54 people. However, it was argued that the Iraq War had only helped increase extremism and hatred of the West amongst radical groups, leading to an increase in terrorist attacks.\n\nThe involvement of the UK in the Iraq War also caused serious issues within British society. The war led to increased animosity towards British Muslims, who felt targeted and alienated by the government's actions.\n\nTony Blair's Legacy\n\nOn 10 May 2007, Tony Blair announced his intention to resign as Prime Minister and leader of the Labour Party. His successor was Gordon Brown, who became Prime Minister a month later.\n\nWhy did he resign?\n\nAlthough Blair won his third election in 2005, Labour's majority was reduced from 167 to 66 seats, and won only 35% of the popular vote. This made it clear that Blair's time had come, and he faced calls from within his own party to step down sooner, rather than later.\n\nHere is an overview of why Tony Blair resigned:\n\nReason ExplanationIraqhe big cause of his resignation was the controversial Iraq war. His eagerness to follow the USA, the length of the war and the falsification of the documents which justified the invasion had critically damaged Blair's reputatioEconomyAlthough many of Labour's economic policies had succeeded, the issues concerning pensions, employment and borrowing were too big to ignore and had caused a lot of outrage amongst the British public.Blair-Brown PactThe fact that Gordon Brown had agreed to let Tony Blair become leader in 1994 came back to bite Blair. When the party started losing confidence in Blair, they had a perfect alternative whom many would have preferred to become leader in the first place. Therefore, it didn't take long for support to rally around Gordon Brown, further destabilising Blair's position\n\nNeedless to say, opinion on Tony Blair is thoroughly divided - a 2021 YouGov poll of Labour Party members showed that 54% of members had a favourable view of Blair, whilst 45% had an unfavourable one.2 The split opinions within the Labour Party demonstrate what a controversial figure Tony Blair is.\n\nHis supporters cite improvements to health and education services, employment and Northern Ireland as just some of Tony Blair's achievements. On the other hand, his critics refer to the Iraq war, issues with Europe and parts of Blair's economic policy as a counter.\n\nIt is simply not plausible to cast Blair and New Labour as either, and unconditionally, the betrayer or saviour of the Labour Party. Failures, successes, and all things in between, can be found in different forms at different times during Blair’s time as Labour leader.'\n\n- Andrew Hindmoor and Karl Pike, 'Past, Present and Future: Tony Blair and the Political Legacy of New Labour'.3\n\nTony Blair - Key takeaways\n\nTony Blair became leader of the Labour Party in 1994 and Prime Minister in 1997, following a very successful election campaign in which he helped promote the image of 'New Labour' - a reformed Labour Party that was rejuvenated and modern.\n\nHis successes included employment, expanding health and education services, committing to the devolution of Scotland and Wales and finding a resolution to the conflict in Northern Ireland.\n\nHe is particularly criticised for his handling of the Iraq war, mainly over his eagerness to support the USA and the falsification of documents about Iraq's nuclear weapons program.\n\nBlair also ran into many issues concerning the EU and Britain's place in Europe.\n\nHe announced he would resign on 10 May 2007, exactly 10 years after his landslide victory against the Conservatives in 1997. He was succeeded by Gordon Brown.\n\nReferences\n\nG.W. Bush 'State of the Union' address, Jan. 2003.
