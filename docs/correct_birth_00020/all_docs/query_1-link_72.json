        "text": "If you have been reading or watching the news in the last few days, you might have formed the impression that the deputy prime minister is Sir Tony Blair.\n\nOn Sunday, he was sharing his thoughts on immigration and wokeism. On Monday, he was talking about £50 billion of tax rises. Tuesday saw him host the grandly titled Future of Britain Conference, where two Cabinet ministers were among the speakers.\n\nMight Blair be angling for a return to public life under Sir Keir Starmer? At the age of 71, Blair’s craving for the spotlight remains undimmed, and he certainly has the experience and the contacts to make himself useful to the new Labour Government, both at home and abroad.\n\nHe was in regular contact with Sir Keir in the run-up to the election, dispensing advice that the Labour leader described as “very helpful”. He was, after all, the last Labour leader to go from opposition to Number 10, and was uniquely placed to help the now Prime Minister navigate that difficult transition.\n\nSo are we witnessing a second coming of the most electorally successful Labour politician of all time? Or will Blair be the spectre at the feast, dumped by Starmer now that he has served his purpose?\n\nLance Price, who was Alastair Campbell’s deputy in Blair’s Downing Street and now works for the Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, says: “I’m absolutely certain there will be no formal role.\n\n“[Blair] knows well enough himself that it would not be helpful for him to be suggesting in any way that he had a formal role or that he was a mastermind giving advice.\n\n“He is big enough to know how he would feel if the roles were reversed.”\n\nStarmer, meanwhile, has insisted: “I will do it my way, with my team, rather than sort of running backwards in history to hug someone.”\n\nWhile Blair may have to shelve any hopes of being a tsar, a guru, an envoy or an ambassador, his influence will still be brought to bear on this Government, whether directly or indirectly.\n\nMatthew Doyle, Starmer’s director of communications, spent years working for Blair after he left Downing Street, and Peter Hyman, Blair’s former speechwriter, is now a senior adviser to the new Prime Minister.\n\nHalf a dozen Blairite ministers have been given or are being tipped for jobs under Starmer, all of whom are likely to turn to their old boss for inspiration and advice.\n\n‘Tony regretted not being bolder’\n\nAlan Milburn is to be given a role in helping Wes Streeting to reform the NHS; Jacqui Smith will become the higher education minister once her peerage has been formalised; the returning MP Douglas Alexander is a business minister and David Miliband and Lord Mandelson are being tipped for the role of US ambassador.\n\nPat McFadden, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the man who ran the election campaign, is another former Blair minister. In his role in the Cabinet Office he will be in charge of making sure Starmer’s instructions are carried out by government departments, filling the same sort of role that Willie Whitelaw did for Margaret Thatcher.\n\nSo while Morgan McSweeney, Starmer’s head of political strategy, is reported to have discouraged formal meetings with Blair, who is still synonymous with the Iraq War for many Labour supporters, it seems certain his voice will still be heard.\n\nOne former Blair adviser says: “I don’t think you will see him turn up at the party conference or anything like that, but I’m sure he will still be giving advice in the background.\n\n“He will be able to help Keir to navigate some of the foreign policy issues, as Tony had an awful lot of experience of foreign policy one way and another, and will be able to give advice on how to handle world leaders who are not from the same political family as you.”\n\nIndeed, Blair is reported to have spoken to Benjamin Netanyahu about Starmer, reassuring Israel’s prime minister that the current Labour leader, despite serving in his predecessor’s top team, is a long way away from Jeremy Corbyn.\n\n“When Blair’s New Labour came to power we ran a mile from anyone who had worked for Wilson or Callaghan,” says the former Blair adviser, “but Keir seems much more comfortable bringing people in from the previous Labour government. One of the things they and Tony will want to impress on Keir is to be bold in his first couple of years when he has maximum political capital.\n\n“Tony regretted not being bolder, earlier, on things like public service reform, the NHS and using technology for economic growth. There was a focus on public spending but not a radical enough economic agenda and it took nearly 10 years to have a proper industrial policy.”\n\nPrice agrees. “They talk a lot, they have a very good professional relationship,” he says. “I think he will continue doing what he does, which is generating ideas.” As Blair himself has put it: “I don’t really offer advice but if he wants to talk about things, we talk about things.”\n\n‘We’ve got a curious relation with our past’\n\nJohn McTernan, who was Blair’s director of political operations in Number 10, says the fact that the former Labour prime minister, like Gordon Brown and John Major, had declined to take a peerage was a clear indication that he sees his future as an informal, rather than a formal part of the government machine.\n\nHe points out that the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, which advises leaders around the world, employs 800 people and is more than enough work to keep Blair occupied.\n\nHe says: “The summit this week showed that he has great convening power, bringing people like Will.I.Am and William Hague together, to generate a bank of progressive ideas. Some of the ideas I don’t agree with, like putting too much faith in generative AI, but there are other ideas, like using digital twins to simulate competing policy ideas, which are good.”\n\nMcTernan says that “throughout the dark days of Jeremy Corbyn” Sir Tony was supporting people who are now in the Cabinet, including Sir Keir. He adds: “When they get together you can see there is chemistry between them. When you are prime minister you don’t really have a peer group. Ministers and advisers are not your peers, so Tony is one of only three people alive who know what it’s like to be a Labour prime minister.\n\n“Having said that, the key thing to understand is that Keir is not a Blairite, and that’s a good thing because he needs to be his own prime minister. Tony started governing in the 20th century, and we are about to go into the second quarter of the 21st century.”\n\nAt the Future of Britain Conference on Tuesday, Blair was interviewed by Demis Hassabis, the British co-founder and chief executive of the world leading AI laboratory Google DeepMind. Blair told Hassabis he was “advising the new Government to talk to you”.\n\nLast year, Starmer was among those who spoke at the Future of Britain Conference, when he thanked Blair personally “for all the support you’ve given me since I’ve been Labour leader”.\n\nHe was absent this year, off to Washington for the Nato summit, but Wes Streeting, the Health Secretary, made an appearance, describing Blair as his “joint second-favourite Labour prime minister” with Gordon Brown. McFadden also showed up at this year’s conference, saying: “We owe Tony Blair a great debt, we’re grateful to him for the support he gave us during the campaign and advice he gave me.\n\n“We’ve got a curious relation with our past. One of the big mistakes we made since 2010 was distancing ourselves from the [previous] Labour government … a real category error. We wanted to correct that, and to Keir Starmer’s great credit he did correct that.”\n\nDespite the warm words of thanks for Blair’s help in getting Starmer elected, Labour has been quick to publicly reject some of the ideas he has come up with in the few days they have been in government. Blair is a big fan of identity cards, which he believes would help solve the problem of illegal immigration, but Yvette Cooper, the Home Secretary, said: “That’s not our approach.”\n\nBlair also advised Starmer in a Sunday Times article to “avoid any vulnerability on wokeism”, which seemed to have the opposite effect as the Prime Minister appointed Anneliese Dodds as joint women and equalities secretary, a woman who has said there are “different definitions legally around what a woman actually is”.\n\nIn September, Blair will publish his latest book, titled On Leadership: Lessons for the 21st Century. It is described as a handbook for leaders, advising them on everything from dealing with bureaucracy to reforming healthcare to harnessing technology.\n\nIt could almost have been written specifically for Starmer. Just don’t be surprised if he takes delivery of his copy in a brown paper parcel.\n\nAdditional reporting by Lauren Shirreff"
