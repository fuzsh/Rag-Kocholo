He joined the Labour Party in 1975 and was elected as the Member of Parliament for the safe seat of Sedgefield, County Durham, in 1983. Tony was appointed as Shadow Home Secretary in 1992. Two years later the Labour leader, John Smith, died suddenly, and Blair won the leadership contest that followed.\n\n\"Tony Blair was seen as a new kind of politician with enormous charisma, arguably the finest opposition leader of modern times – even succeeding in reforming ‘Clause IV’ of the Labour constitution. It was of little surprise when Labour won the 1997 general election by a landslide majority of 179.\" [6]\n\nAs British Prime Minister\n\nBlair became Prime Minister on 2 May 1997 and appointed his friend, Gordon Brown, as Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Blair government made important constitutional changes, such as devolving powers to the Scottish and Welsh parliaments, the Human Rights Act, reforming the House of Lords and passing the Freedom of Information Act. In 1998 the Good Friday Agreement ended most of the violence in Northern Ireland.[6]\n\nControversy ensued when British forces joined America in bombing Iraq in 1998, but Labour won the next general election in 2001 with another landslide, taking 167 seats. The 9/11 attacks led to further military action in Afghanistan and then Iraq. In the UK the case for war was based on the belief that Saddam Hussein had \"weapons of mass destruction\", and the subsequent unravelling of this evidence meant that Blair became a divisive figure.[6]\n\nTony Blair resigned as Prime Minister on 27 June 2007 and was succeeded by Gordon Brown.[6]\n\nPersonal life\n\nBlair married in 1980.[7]\n\nSources\n\n↑ Wikipedia: Wikipedia contributors, \"Tony Blair,\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tony_Blair&oldid=1108857596 (accessed September 12, 2022).\n\n↑ Birth Registration: \"Statutory Register of Births\"\n\nNational Records of Scotland, Ref: 685/5/1402\n\nScotlandsPeople (accessed 9 March 2023)\n\nAnthony Charles Blair birth registered 1953 in George Square.\n\n↑ Website: Alumni Spotlight: Tony Blair.
