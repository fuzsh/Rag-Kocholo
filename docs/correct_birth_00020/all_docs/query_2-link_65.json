        "text": "Tony Blair is a British politician who served as one of the youngest and longest-serving prime ministers of Britain. He was the leader of the ‘Labour Party’ from 1994 to 2007. Like many of his predecessors, Blair’s tenure as prime minister was marked with controversies. During his tenure, he was even accused of war crimes. He rebuked the conventional style of politics, which was followed by his party at that time. Under his leadership, his party came to be known as the ‘New Labour Party.’ He implemented several socio-economic reforms to alleviate poverty and bring down unemployment, while focusing on elevating the living standards of people. He also showed great concern for environmental hazards, such as global warming, which his predecessors had overlooked. However, his decisions that led Britain to several wars, especially the ‘War on Terror’ declared by the U.S., put him at odds with his party as well as his countrymen. He was also criticized for extending unconditional support to the invasions carried out by the US in the Middle East. His party members and the public were enraged by his decision to involve England in wars. According to his party members and the public, his decisions not only violated human rights and disrupted peace, but also exhausted a substantial amount of Britain’s financial reserves."
