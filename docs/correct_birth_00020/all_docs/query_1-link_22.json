        "text": "Profession: British Prime Minister\n\nBiography: Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1997 to 2007 and the Leader of the Labour Party from 1994 to 2007.\n\nBlair's doctrine of \"third way\" politics tried to carve a new ideology between socialism and capitalism and initially proved popular with the British electorate allowing the Labour Party to win three consecutive general elections.\n\nBlair's government devolved power to the newly created Scottish Parliament, National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly. He was also heavily involved in bringing peace to Northern Ireland, chiefly via the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.\n\nInternationally he supported the foreign policy of US Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, committing British forces to battle five times including the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The last is highly controversial, after he falsely claimed that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.\n\nBorn: May 6, 1953\n\nBirthplace: Edinburgh,, Scotland, United Kingdom\n\nAge: 71 years old"
