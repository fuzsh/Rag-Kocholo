        "text": "The Ghost's Adam Lang is at least the 20th version of Tony Blair to hit the big and small screen. The stage has also given life to a troupe of Tonys – many fathered by David Hare – and there's a legion of literary equivalents, most memorably Sue Townsend's transvestite Tony. He must be the most fictionalised prime minister in British history. I don't know what the collective noun for Tony Blairs might be – an Iraq? a grin? – but we clearly need one.\n\nSome of these screen versions are Actual Tonys and appear in the kind of dramas that claim to be based on fact but admit that some things have been made up. They are often played by Michael Sheen, who is set to do his third Tony in The Special Relationship. Others are not called \"Tony\" but share many of what we think are the man's real characteristics. These Coy Tonys have central roles in My Dad's the Prime Minister, Love, Actually, and of course, The Ghost. Then, finally, there are Maybe Tonys. Perhaps the most notable one is Harold Saxon, the prime ministerial identity assumed by the Master in the Doctor Who episode The Sound of Drums, transmitted in June 2007, just days before Blair finally resigned. By then, all the misty-eyed hopes of May 1997 had evaporated and Blair had become one of the most unpopular prime ministers, ever. Like Blair, Saxon is elected on a landslide, promising radical reform. Everyone thinks Saxon is a great guy but no one can recall why they voted for him – because they had been brainwashed.\n\nAll these fictional Tonys have some kind of relationship with the real Blair – but what is it? Some claim Richard Nixon never escaped the shifty, five o'clock shadow persona constructed by the cartoonist Herblock: Nixon became Herblock's Nixon. In the same way, these different Tonys generally depict him in a hostile way – media-obsessed, superficial, unprincipled, insincere, a liar and/or dupe. Even Hugh Grant's nice Tony from Love, Actually served to reproach the real Tony – for in the year of the Iraq invasion Grant tells President Billy Bob Thornton where to get off, something that at the time many in the audience wished Blair would do to George Bush.\n\nOf course, Nixon was shifty: Herblock merely exaggerated reality. Similarly, Blair's fictional image has some basis in reality: scriptwriters didn't make up the Iraq war. The Ghost is consistent with the overwhelmingly critical depictions of Blair. For Robert Harris wrote the novel on which the movie is based filled with \"a sort of disillusion and a sort of anger that Britain went along with something which seemed so, even at the time, to be a bridge too far and rather illogical\". An entertaining thriller, The Ghost – spoiler alert – explains this \"illogicality\" through Lang being under the thumb of a wife who, it transpires, is a long-time CIA agent. Of course we can all have a good laugh at Cherie as a kind of Lady MacBeth and titter at the depiction of a hen-pecked Blair. We will all feel so much better about ourselves and superior to the silly, nasty Blairs – and I am sure The Ghost was good therapy for Harris.\n\nBut while these fictional Tonys seem to say a lot about the real Blair – though not having met the man myself I don't know how accurate they are – what do they say about us? If Blair was as awful as these screen fictions suggest, how come he was one of Britain's most electorally successful prime ministers of recent decades. How did that happen? Were we all brainwashed?"
