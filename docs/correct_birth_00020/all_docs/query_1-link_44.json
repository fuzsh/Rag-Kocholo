        "text": "The President’s Guest House\n\nAN ELEGANT SETTING REFLECTING OUR COUNTRY’S HISTORY\n\nFurnished with fine antique furniture, objects, and art, Blair House is carefully curated to portray the history, values, and hospitality of the nation. The home is maintained by the U.S. Department of State and the General Services Administration. Interior décor, furnishings, and heritage collections are supported through financial and in-kind contributions to the Blair House Foundation.\n\nA storied political history\n\nBuilt as a private home in 1824, Blair House has played an important role in nearly 190 years of American political, diplomatic and cultural history—from Andrew Jackson’s “Kitchen Cabinet,” to private chats with Abraham Lincoln, to Harry S. Truman’s crucial leadership as World War II ended and the Cold War began. Now, as then, U.S. Presidents continue to rely on Blair House as a significant foreign policy tool.\n\nDiplomacy In Action\n\nLocated across from the White House on Pennsylvania Avenue, Blair House has served as the President’s Guest House since its purchase by the U.S. government during World War II. Under the stewardship of the Department of State, it welcomes visiting heads of state, ambassadors, and other notables in gracious, secure surroundings in the heart of the nation’s capital.\n\nGeneral Charles De Gaulle | President Harry S.
