        "text": "I. The Pitch\n\nThe citizens of Kazakhstan celebrated the 20th anniversary of independence from the Soviet Union, which had been achieved in 1991, in a variety of ways. In December 2011, the country’s president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, unveiled a model of the Arc de Triomphe in the Kazakh capital, Astana. At around the same time, but in a different spirit, oil workers occupied the central square in the western city of Zhanaozen, where they had been on strike for months to protest for higher wages and better working conditions. Kazakh police fired on the unarmed demonstrators, killing at least 15 and injuring scores of others.\n\nNazarbayev, with his authoritarian tastes, has been the president of Kazakhstan for as long as his country has been a country. His un-interrupted run has much to do with the fact that he has never held an election that met even the most forgiving international standards. To memorialize Kazakhstan’s independence, in 2012 Nazarbayev appeared in a documentary. The 67-minute video, In the Stirrups of Time, opens with shots of Nazarbayev greeting his people interspersed with scenes of the sun rising over iconic Kazakh locales. Harp and piano play in the background.\n\nThe first recognizable person to appear on-camera, after Nazar­bayev, is, to the uninitiated, an unlikely one. Two minutes into the documentary, former British prime minister Tony Blair materializes on the screen in suit and tie, against the backdrop of a white fireplace. Blair had been hired as a consultant to Nazarbayev two months before the Zhanaozen massacre, and during the first two years of his contract, according to the Kazakh media, he would be paid $40 million. The British press speculated that part of Blair’s role was to help the Kazakh president secure the Nobel Peace Prize—an unlikely prospect. Blair’s office has denied that Blair was involved in an attempt to secure a Nobel Prize for Nazarbayev; it has also said that the contract figures were wrong, and that the fees were used to fund Blair’s charities. In the documentary, in what are clearly cherry-picked sound bites, Blair says that Kazakhstan “is almost unique, I would say, in its cultural diversity, in the way it brings different faiths together and cultures together.” He finds the people of Kazakhstan to be “smart” and “capable” and “very proud” of their country. Other politicians appear in the film, but the camera returns to Blair again and again.\n\nIn the years since his movie appearance, Blair has continued to work for Nazarbayev. To help with the work, Blair hired Portland Communications, a firm run by his former media adviser, Tim Allan. Alastair Campbell, Blair’s former press secretary, works for Portland as an adviser. Blair also facilitated a meeting in the summer of 2013 between Nazarbayev and the current British prime minister, David Cameron.\n\nWatching Blair in Nazarbayev’s documentary, one is reminded of a pitchman in a late-night infomercial. “If you look back over 20 years,” Blair says at one point, “you have to say the progress is remarkable.” Looking back over the past few years, you have to wonder how Blair the pitchman would assess his own progress. Various former associates cited a famous observation by the British politician Enoch Powell, that “all political lives, unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture, end in failure, because that is the nature of politics and of human affairs.” It’s hard to imagine a politician who personifies Powell’s statement more acutely than Tony Blair, who has gone from being one of the most popular prime ministers in Great Britain’s history to being one of the most reviled figures in British public life. A man with aspirations to global leadership—even to global moral leadership—is now regarded by many of his countrymen as a shill for big corporations and deep-pocketed and dubious regimes. In terms of personal wealth, Blair is said to be worth an estimated £100 million ($150 million), a figure he denies. Today, Blair rarely makes public appearances in London. In 2010, he canceled a book party to celebrate the publication of his memoir, A Journey: My Political Life, to avoid the inevitable protests. Blair wasn’t invited to the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton in 2011. Last January, a London waiter attempted a citizen’s arrest of Blair for alleged war crimes arising from the invasion of Iraq.\n\nTony Blair was the youngest prime minister since Lord Liverpool in 1812. Unlike in America, where ex-presidents such as Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton have pursued prominent second acts after leaving office, in Britain, former prime ministers are expected to recede quietly into history. Margaret Thatcher and John Major both profited from consulting and speaking tours after they stepped down as prime minister, but neither made repeated pronouncements about public policy, as Blair routinely does. After he left office, Winston Churchill remained in Parliament as an ordinary backbencher until a year before his death, in 1965. Blair sees himself as pioneering something new: being the first prime minister who behaves like an American-style ex-president. In his pursuit of this role he has continued to weigh in on topics such as global terrorism and Iraqi politics. He has established a variety of philanthropic foundations. And, like Bill Clinton, he has set out to make some money, in his case aggressively pursuing business deals with autocratic governments around the world. Blair’s view of this is that one must be pragmatic—better to engage with unsavory regimes, and maybe improve them a little, than not to do so at all. Better to take whatever money you can get with one hand, as long as you do good with the other. If you believe his motivations are pure, then he is trying to save the world by playing the role of a geopolitical Robin Hood.\n\nIt is an understatement to say that not everyone believes his motivations are pure. One man who does, however, is Tony Blair. I recently met with him in his office overlooking London’s Grosvenor Square. The brick-and-stone town house is the same building John Adams occupied when he served as the first American ambassador to the Court of St. James’s. When Blair introduced himself to me, his blue eyes and wide smile seemed to precede the rest of him. Everything else about the man has faded with age: the hair, the skin, and probably even the fabled torso, which once, while he was in office, was featured in a British magazine.\n\nBlair wanted to put his years since leaving office into perspective, starting with what it’s like to be suddenly out on the street. “You leave with nothing,” he said. “The first thing you miss, I always say to leaders who are going out of office, the first thing you miss is the infrastructure.... You have to build it. You have to build that network of connections, and you have to work at it very, very hard. But then you have to have money to support it.”\n\nBut support what? How would he sum up the current purpose of his life? He was silent for a full 10 seconds. Then he said, “Essentially, I’m trying to build an organization that is able to make a difference on the issues I care about.” Those issues are faith and religious tolerance, plus good governance, particularly in developing countries in Africa. “Radical Islam is the key challenge we face today,” Blair said, “and we don’t yet understand its breadth and its depth and how dangerous it is. And one vital aspect of countering this threat is to educate people at an early age to respect the Other.” He went on to talk about his Faith Foundation, and his Africa Governance Initiative. He said he spent roughly two-thirds of his time on his charities and on his work involving the so-called Quartet, which is a joint effort by the U.S., the European Union, Russia, and the U.N. to ease tensions between Israel and Palestine. The rest of his time was spent making money to pay for it all.\n\nI asked Blair about the litany of criticism he faces, particularly in his own country, and especially about his business deals. Our conversation took place just a month before The Sunday Times in a front-page story revealed the details of a secret Blair contract with the oil company PetroSaudi International, prompting even more criticism. Blair responded with a sigh that was meant to suggest resigned amusement and didn’t quite succeed. “First of all, you know, I actually did win three elections, not lose them. I won the last election with a majority, even after Iraq.” The criticisms of him, he said, are overstated by British newspapers. He observed that what he had long felt to be one of his positive qualities had often led to a negative result: “I have always been a centrist politician and I remain a centrist politician. And the center, in my view, still has the true governing constituency of the country but not the governing constituency of the media. The right don’t like it because you used to win elections, and the left don’t like it because they think you sold out.... It’s multiplied because of the legacy of Iraq.” He has heard all the criticisms before. If they bother him, as some of his former associates have said is the case, he betrayed no sign of it in our meeting. He was personable and without airs. As he threw one arm around the back of an armchair, settling in, he was clearly unapologetic. “Whatever criticisms people have of me,” he said, “they’ve seldom thought of me as politically stupid.”\n\nII. “Now, Darling . . . ”\n\nRobert Harris lives in a Victorian vicarage in the town of Kintbury, in Berkshire. In the early 19th century, the vicarage was owned by a man whose son was engaged to Jane Austen’s sister. A former journalist, Harris is now a best-selling novelist and something of an expert on empires. He is at work on the third novel of a trilogy about ancient Rome. He is also something of an expert on Tony Blair and would agree that Blair is not stupid. Harris is one of the best-known of Blair’s former friends—a circle of disaffection that is quite large, and whose ranks include his former chancellor of the Exchequer and successor as prime minister, Gordon Brown; his former deputy prime minister, John Prescott; and the chairman of News Corp., Rupert Murdoch, whose newspapers helped deliver Blair to 10 Downing Street in the first place. Harris had written favorably about Blair in the years leading up to the 1997 campaign, during which he was given unique, behind-the-scenes access, but then he broke with Blair over his handling of—his enabling of, some would say—the Iraq war. Harris’s novel The Ghost was made into the Roman Polanski film The Ghost Writer. It depicts a British prime minister—a thinly veiled Tony Blair—after he leaves office and hires a ghostwriter to collaborate on his memoirs. In due course, it is revealed that a covert C.I.A. spy in the household had manipulated the prime minister into doing the American government’s bidding while in power. Of Blair’s overall career trajectory, Harris says, “I have a sense of tragedy about the whole thing—almost in a classic Greek sense of someone who is brought down in a way by their own talents, their own quality, that subtly sets in process their destruction.”\n\nIn 1997, Tony Blair, then 43, was swept into No. 10 Downing Street in an election landslide by winning the largest majority of any party since 1935. In his 2010 memoir, Blair characterized his time in office as a love affair between himself and the British electorate. In those years Bill Clinton was always calling. The Murdoch papers adored him. The young “New Labour” leader, with his lawyer wife, Cherie, ushered in the era of Cool Britannia. It was Blair in 2003 who made the case for war in Iraq with an eloquence that a tongue-tied President George W. Bush could not muster. A Time magazine story called Blair “the American Prime Minister.”\n\nAs Iraq collapsed, so did Blair’s stature. He had become known as “Bush’s poodle” and, owing to statements by Blair that were at variance with what the truth turned out to be, “Bliar.” He has already faced one inquiry, the Butler Review, which looked into the intelligence used to justify the Iraq war. (The review found some of the intelligence “seriously flawed.”) Another, more thorough investigation, the Chilcot Inquiry, named after its chairman, the Right Honorable Sir John Chilcot, has been under way since Gordon Brown authorized it in 2009. Its much-delayed report, already called a “whitewash” by critics, will likely be released in 2015.\n\nHarris told me that he got the idea for The Ghost while at a dinner at No. 10 in 2003 as he listened to Cherie Blair complain that Jacques Chirac, then the president of France, was behaving abysmally by not supporting the invasion of Iraq with sufficient enthusiasm. “Tony cut in and said, ‘Now, darling, don’t let’s talk about the war.’ ” Harris says he later learned that Cherie had been calling members of Parliament, urging them to vote for the pro-war resolution. She was “potentially more belligerent” on the topic than Harris had realized, and she was quite influential with her husband. What finished Blair off with respect to his own party, Harris said, was the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, in 2006, when Bush and Blair were the only prominent international voices supporting Israel’s actions.\n\nHarris credits Cherie with boosting Blair’s rise in the Labour Party: “He would never have become Labour Party leader without her.” Cherie’s father, Tony Booth, was a well-known actor, whose first wife, Gale Howard, was Cherie’s mother. After their divorce, Tony’s longtime companion was Pat Phoenix, the star of the British soap opera Coronation Street. Booth and Phoenix were both royalty in the Labour Party. “When Tony the son-in-law came looking for a seat, that certainly helped him a lot,” Harris explained. Blair’s own father, by contrast, was very much on the other side of the political divide. “One of the key things about Tony is that, in essence, he’s a conservative,” Harris observed. He ticked off the evidence: Blair’s religious conversion (to Catholicism); his views of the role of the state (limited); his belief in interventionism (the Iraq war).\n\nThe 1999 NATO action against then Yugoslav president Slobodan Milošević’s Serb forces in Kosovo, which Blair supported, made him a hero among ethnic Albanians, many of whom were being forced from their homes and even killed en masse. Blair was the most outspoken advocate of NATO action, even as then president Bill Clinton, along with other world leaders, remained reluctant to commit troops. (Albanian women did not forget, and in 2010, on a trip to Kosovo, Blair met a group of youngsters who had all been given the name “Tonibler.”) Blair’s support for Bush and the American effort in Iraq won him a Congressional Gold Medal—and he delivered what was effectively an acceptance speech before a joint session of Congress in July 2003. He received a standing ovation.\n\nBut that was in Washington. In 2004, Blair traveled to Libya for his famous “deal in the desert” with the country’s longtime dictator, Muammar Qaddafi. The deal sparked outrage among the families of victims of the 1988 Lockerbie bombing, perpetrated by a Libyan terrorist who placed explosives on a commercial airliner and blew it up over Scotland, killing all 259 people aboard and 11 people on the ground. Following Qaddafi’s renouncing weapons of mass destruction and support for terrorism, Blair agreed to normalize relations between the two countries. The negotiations eventually led to the release back to Libya of the man convicted for complicity in the Lockerbie bombing.\n\nAs the 2005 election in Britain approached, and with Blair’s popularity declining, he and Cherie granted an exclusive interview to The Sun, arguably the most influential among Rupert Murdoch’s publications there. Murdoch’s support had always been crucial to Blair, but this interview in particular was seen as a bald attempt to help Blair shore up votes. The three-page feature prompted derision for its discussion of the Blairs’ personal lives. Cherie Blair at one point told her husband to “strip off” to demonstrate his upper physique. When asked by The Sun photographer if he was in good shape, Blair responded, “Very!” The photographer asked, “What, five times a night?” And Blair said, “At least.” He added, “I can do it more depending how I feel.”\n\nBlair won a third term in office in 2005, albeit with his smallest majority. Shortly after he was elected, Blair acknowledged that Iraq had been “deeply divisive” but said that he felt Britain was ready to move on. The country did move on, very quickly—to the “cash for honours” scandal. (Several Labour supporters had been nominated to life peerages in the House of Lords, allegedly in return for large donations or loans to the Labour Party. No evidence was found to file charges.) It was a good time to depart and maybe try that ex-president thing. Blair resigned in June 2007 and left the government in the hands of Gordon Brown.\n\nHe did not return to Parliament, as most 20th-century prime ministers have. “One of the great paradoxes about Tony,” Jack Straw, who served as Blair’s home secretary until 2001 and then as his foreign secretary, told me, “is that he was extremely effective in the House of Commons, but never much liked the place. He was always clear that the moment he ceased to be prime minister, he’d cease to be in the House of Commons.”\n\nIII. Complexity and Secrecy\n\nA Sunday Telegraph analysis of Tony Blair’s travels, compiled from public accounts of his movements and published in 2012, showed that, during a single 12-month period, Blair made 61 overseas trips totaling almost 224,000 miles—the equivalent, the newspaper noted, of traveling to the moon. In addition to working for Kazakhstan, Blair has reportedly established working relationships in Mongolia, China, the United Arab Emirates, Vietnam, Kuwait, Colombia, Brazil, Albania, Peru, South Korea, and Azerbaijan.\n\n“Politicians are people who crave relevance,” a former Blair associate told me. “You can’t be a global superstar without money.” Still, several former associates told me that it isn’t an obsession with money per se that drives Blair. Rather, one said, his motivation is a compulsion for “doing stuff.” Since leaving office, Blair has set up a formidable array of business and philanthropic ventures. Tony Blair Associates, housed in that Grosvenor Square office, handles a wide variety of government advisory contracts and investment deals. As noted, Blair also runs a number of charities. The Africa Governance Initiative—which receives funding from the Gates Foundation—and the Faith Foundation are both based in Marble Arch Tower, overlooking Hyde Park. The smaller and humbler Tony Blair Sports Foundation is based in Newcastle. Blair has also helped establish an organization focused on global warming, called Breaking the Climate Deadlock.\n\nBlair’s for-profit businesses exist under eight separate corporate entities, linked together in ways that require little disclosure about basic matters such as how much money they generate and how much money they spend. His for-profit work, which occurs largely through Tony Blair Associates, is financed through two main umbrella entities: Windrush Ventures and Firerush Ventures. Within those there are a total of six “structures,” many of which do not report any meaningful financial information. From 2007 to early 2013, according to Bloomberg, these businesses took in about $90 million. But because of patchy disclosure requirements, these figures likely don’t come close to encompassing the full revenue picture.\n\nSince the Blairs moved out of Downing Street, their London residence has been a dark-brick town house with a mews house in back, on Connaught Square. Armed guards were milling around outside the day I walked by, as in fact they do every day. One neighbor joked, after the Blairs moved in, that the good news was that, given the security patrol, no one in the neighborhood would ever be mugged again; the bad news was that they might get bombed. The Blairs’ country house, South Pavilion, a Queen Anne mansion in Buckinghamshire, was once the home of Sir John Gielgud.\n\nThe sources and extent of Blair’s income are impossible to nail down. The directors’ reports and financial accounts published on his Web site show only the financial statements of the two umbrella companies through which the operating costs of his global activities are paid. “They do not represent his earnings or the earnings or the profit of his businesses and are not referable to them,” the Web site states. “They do not represent either the accounts of his charities or his donations to them.” Blair recently told a gathering of supporters in London that “reports of my wealth have been greatly exaggerated. Just for the record, I read that I’m supposed to be worth £100 million. Cherie is asking where it is,” he said, to warm laughter. He added that he wasn’t worth “a half of that, a third of that, a quarter of that, a fifth of that. I could go on.” This is a surprising claim, since the Blair family’s real-estate holdings alone are reportedly worth about $47 million and encompass at least nine homes, including one each for Blair’s three adult children. (A Blair spokesperson says that Blair’s net worth is “roughly equal to what he has given away”: about $15 million.)\n\nThe corporate structure of Blair, Inc., is complicated by design. Blair set it up with the help of KPMG, a tax-and-auditing firm, and of Robert Barnett, his Washington, D.C., lawyer and literary agent. Blair wanted confidentiality from certain forms of scrutiny—specifically from the media. The complex structure of the limited partnerships that house Blair’s various for-profit businesses is “clearly not intended by British law, but it is possible under British law,” according to Richard Murphy, an influential tax-and-accounting expert who runs his own consultancy, Tax Research LLP, in Norfolk, England. Blair’s structure achieves “close to the secrecy he would have achieved if he was outside the U.K. in a tax haven.” As a result of these arrangements, no baseline public accounting exists that would outline how much money Blair’s for-profit work generates. It is known that, taken as a whole, Blair’s various operations employ roughly 200 people.\n\nHis most significant client is JPMorgan Chase, which reportedly pays Blair about $3 million a year. Blair appears at multiple corporate events for JPMorgan and acts as the head of the company’s International Council, which means that he is essentially on call for high-level advice about global affairs wherever JPMorgan does business. “He will drop anything for them,” one former Blair associate says. Blair does consulting work for Zurich Insurance Group, for which he receives an estimated $750,000 a year. He is also an adviser to Abu Dhabi’s investment fund, Mubadala Development Company, which reportedly pays him about $1.5 million a year. Blair is currently looking to open an office in Abu Dhabi.\n\nBlair had proved himself a skilled broker before leaving office. In 2007, when he was still prime minister, he made a trip to Libya in the company of Peter Sutherland, then the chairman of BP. At the time, officials traveling with Blair explained that BP had signed a nearly $900 million agreement to drill 17 oil wells in Libya. In advance of another of Blair’s trips to Libya, in 2009, according to an e-mail obtained by The Telegraph, JPMorgan vice-chairman Lord Renwick, attempting to broker a deal between the Libyan Investment Authority and a Russian aluminum provider, encouraged an L.I.A. vice-chairman to come to London for a meeting “before Mr. Blair’s visit to Tripoli.”\n\nBlair has repeatedly said that, upon leaving office, all he had were three employees and a few cell phones. The Blair political machine at 10 Downing Street had been feared and formidable. But the most talented and experienced members of that team did not join Blair in his new ventures. His famous spin doctor, Alastair Campbell, and his chief of staff, Jonathan Powell, struck out on their own.\n\nFor his first big consulting job, Blair turned to Kuwait. Blair had met the emir of Kuwait in 2007 and received him as a guest at 10 Downing Street. In 2009, Tony Blair Associates won a four-year contract with the Kuwaiti government worth a reported $40 million—this according to Jonathan Cook, a British journalist who has published a lengthy analysis of Blair’s Middle East dealings in the Journal of Palestine Studies. The firm’s government advisory work is to consult on “political and economic trends and governmental reform.” Blair hired a team of consultants to live and work in Kuwait. They produced a report called Kuwait Vision 2035, outlining basic goals in areas such as health and education. But the price tag (which Blair’s office said was overstated, without providing details) drew criticism in Kuwait from opposition ministers, academics, and newspapers. So did a report that Blair earned $1.5 million advising the royal family on various private matters.\n\nBlair made headlines in the business press in 2012 for joining Qatari prime minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, a major shareholder in the mining giant Xsastra, and Glencore chief executive Ivan Glasenberg in an emergency meeting less than 24 hours ahead of a crucial shareholder vote that paved the way for a $66 billion merger between the two companies. Al Thani’s vote of his Xsastra shares was crucial in allowing the deal to move forward. Blair reportedly made $1 million for three hours’ work. Blair also tried to intervene on the Qatari prime minister’s behalf to make a deal with Paddy McKillen, the Irish property developer, to buy the hotel group that owns Claridge’s. The Barclay brothers, who own the Telegraph Media Group, eventually won control of the hotels.\n\nBlair signed on in July 2014 to be a member of the Southern Corridor Advisory Panel, which includes onetime German foreign minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Peter Sutherland, formerly of BP and now the chairman of Goldman Sachs International. The panel’s purpose is to facilitate the expansion of a vast natural-gas field in the Caspian Sea and the building of two pipelines across Europe. The $45 billion enterprise, championed by the Azerbaijani president, Ilham Aliyev, has been called by critics “the Blair Rich Project.” According to the Financial Times, Blair was hired for his experience in dealing with E.U. institutions, given the numerous hurdles the pipelines will encounter as they make their way through seven national jurisdictions.\n\nBlair’s government advisory work is “bespoke,” according to a spokesman. He can, as in the case of Kuwait, offer basic general advice. Increasingly, he has sought to be a conduit for outside investments in the various countries where he does work, such as Mozambique and East Timor. Blair has helped set up oil investments in the Middle East for the China Investment Corporation. He has acted as a matchmaker, linking businessmen looking to invest with governments seeking capital. In those instances, Blair essentially introduces two parties from his vast global Rolodex.\n\nFor Blair, this kind of business is booming. If some of the governments that Blair advises are somewhat blemished, it’s also true, as Jack Straw pointed out, that “those governments need advice.” Straw said it is impossible to know how to assess Blair’s work in a given country without understanding the specific advice he is giving and the nature of the work. But, he added, “unless we should never have dealings with people whose governments don’t tick every box, I’m not sure what the criticism is.”\n\nIV. “A Pretty Straight Sort of Guy”\n\nAnd then there is his work for the Quartet, which even Tony Blair finds hard to describe.\n\nOne of the few venues in contested East Jerusalem where people on all sides are willing to gather is the American Colony Hotel, established at the turn of the last century by a devoutly Christian American family who took over this Ottoman compound, originally built for a pasha and his four wives. Blair moved into the elegant stone building, its courtyard shaded by mulberry trees, when he took over as the representative of the Office of the Quartet—a somewhat ad hoc position created in 2002 to provide an official point of contact between the international community and the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. The Quartet representative is its official voice in Israel. The organization is symbolically important but in practice often ignored. On the day Blair left Downing Street, he took up his new role with the Quartet. President Bush had pushed for Blair’s appointment, over the objections of then secretary of state Condoleezza Rice. “Bush said, ‘This guy ruined his career to help me,’ ” a former Blair associate told me. Blair worked out of the fourth floor of the American Colony and eventually hired its banquet manager as his personal chef.\n\nFor Blair, obtaining a somewhat official role in the peace process has both a public and a personal dimension. In British politics, religious conviction is tolerated, but only as a private eccentricity. Blair is unusual in the public way he discusses his faith. As a young M.P., Blair had become friendly with a fellow parliamentarian, Lord Levy, who is Jewish. In 1995, when Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated, Levy and Blair, who was by then the leader of the opposition party, attended the funeral together. Levy introduced Blair to a number of local dignitaries. “That is all part of what gave Blair the bug of seeing the Israeli-Palestinian problem as solvable,” says Toby Greene, a British academic living in Israel and the author of a book, Blair, Labour, and Palestine, about Blair’s involvement in the Middle East peace process.\n\nBefore Blair, the position of representative to the Quartet had been held by James Wolfensohn, the Australian-born American investment banker and former president of the World Bank. Wolfensohn took the position in 2005. He stayed in the job for 11 months, lived in Jerusalem nearly full-time, and chafed at the limited scope of his influence, which was confined to strictly economic projects designed to help the Palestinian economy. “I was stupid for not reading the small print,” he said in an interview with Haaretz a year after he stepped down. Wolfensohn said he felt he was a “nuisance” to Elliott Abrams, the neocon senior director of the National Security Council, and was as a result sidelined in any discussions. “My worry for Tony Blair is that if you read the mandate he has—it’s exactly the same as mine. It talks about helping both sides, helping the Palestinians, but there’s nothing there about negotiating peace.” In 2007, when Blair took the job, 10 European foreign ministers wrote an open letter urging him to expand his role. Blair shows no signs of having done so.\n\nIn some ways, Blair has become the personification of the “peace economy,” made up of people who give speeches, hold seminars, write papers, work on side projects, and in general have found a niche in the endless process of brokering peace between Israel and the Palestinians. It is a notion that Ian Lustick, a political-science professor at the University of Pennsylvania, explored in a New York Times op-ed column last year. The phrase surfaced frequently as I made my way through Jerusalem and asked people about Blair. There is little sense that he has made a lasting contribution. A prominent Israeli lawyer with deep diplomatic connections told me, “He has trivialized the institution he purports to lead.” Mahmoud Labadi, a onetime spokesperson for the Palestine Liberation Organization and later the director general of the Palestinian Legislative Council, says of Blair that his longevity at the Quartet is a sign of his ineffectuality: “He can stay as long as he’s not helpful.” Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, says, “He is extremely friendly and affable, but that’s not the issue.”\n\n“What they most want to be is still relevant in politics,” a former business associate of Blair’s told me, referring to public figures in general but also specifically to Blair. “His Quartet role is very important to him. But if you are doing business there, too, it gets a bit muddy.” In fact, it gets very muddy. As noted, for a period of time Blair facilitated discussions on Gaza between Israel’s Netanyahu and Egypt’s al-Sisi. Al-Sisi also happens to be getting professional advice from Blair. In collaboration with the United Arab Emirates, Blair has been recommending communication advisers to work with him.\n\nIn 2009, in his role as the Quartet representative, Blair helped persuade Israel to open up radio frequencies so that a cell-phone provider, Wataniya Mobile, a Kuwaiti- and Qatari-backed telecom company, could operate in the West Bank. He also promoted the development of a major gas field off the coast of Gaza, operated by British Gas. Later it emerged that both Wataniya and British Gas were clients of JPMorgan. Blair maintained that he had no knowledge of JPMorgan’s relationship with either company.\n\nA year earlier, as the representative for the Quartet, Blair wrote to Libya’s Qaddafi on official Quartet stationery, saying that he was “very interested to hear from you of the progress that is being made and the great opportunities there are for the future,” adding that he was “particularly interested in what you said about the funds that will be dedicated to projects in Africa, as I am doing a lot of work there and know of good, worthwhile projects for investments.”\n\nIn response to criticism about his multiple and possibly conflicting roles—as outspoken diplomat and relentless wheeler-dealer—Blair often adopts the attitude he articulated in the first year of his tenure as prime minister. “I think most people who have dealt with me think I am a pretty straight sort of guy,” he said in a televised apology after his first political scandal. Blair had been accused of lifting a tobacco-advertising ban for Formula One racing as a favor to the organ­iza­tion’s head, Bernie Ecclestone, a major donor to his campaign. In retrospect, Blair seems to have obfuscated almost every aspect of the affair. He denied for years that Ecclestone’s donations to his campaign had any effect on his decision. But documents revealed by a Telegraph investigation later showed that he appeared to have lied about the date when he decided to push for an exemption. He asked for it just hours after he had met with Ecclestone.\n\nV. If Putin Called\n\nDuring our conversation in London, Blair sat in a wing chair next to the marble fireplace in his office. He wore an open-necked blue dress shirt and a brown suit. On a table nearby were bottles of wine and liquor and a stack of copies of his autobiography, all apparently intended as gifts (and one of the cards bearing the name Ed Milliband, the current leader of the Labour Party). Across the room stood a wooden desk covered with a jumble of papers, along with a large computer and an open laptop. An inscribed photograph of John Kerry sat on the desk. Next to it was the 30th-anniversary issue of Gay Times, which had named Blair as one of the magazine’s 30 “gay icons”—not for the abs that Cherie admired but for the Blair government’s recognition of gay civil partnerships, for its making homophobia a hate crime, and for its repeal of a particularly discriminatory piece of legislation called Section 28.\n\nBlair appeared initially wary—“I’m playing for the long term here, I’m not playing for the next day’s newspapers”—but as we spoke, he warmed to the topic of his work. It occurred to me that his multiple spheres in a variety of countries around the world leave him without a core social circle. Influential as he was in British public life, he is now both physically and emotionally removed from it. The allegation of an affair with Wendi Murdoch only hastened that isolation, taking away the array of Murdoch allies who had surrounded him while he was in office. Blair was willing to talk about any subject that might come up, including the full range of criticisms he has been subjected to. He was sometimes defensive, often eloquent, never at a loss for words.\n\nHowever stoutly he defended his decisions on Iraq and Afghanistan, Blair clearly resented the fact that they have damaged his reputation irrevocably. In a sense, he passed the buck to the legacy of history. “The reason it was tough in Iraq and tough in Afghanistan is the reason it is tough today. At some point, people will understand that it’s not because of something we’ve done. It’s tough because the terrorism is deep-rooted and it’s got very strong causes within the religion of Islam. This is going to last beyond this president and beyond the next president. All the choices are ugly and tough. So, we went into Iraq, we put in ground troops there. We ended up fighting these people, and we ended up pinning them down there, by the way. But it was long and hard and brutal and bloody and much more difficult than anybody expected.”\n\nHe went on: “In the end, the most sensible thing is to realize that this problem is huge. It’s not something that we’ve created. It is something we’re dealing with, and we are going to have to deal with it for a long time.”\n\nI started to ask a further question, but Blair interrupted. “People say, ‘Why should you listen to him?’—because of Iraq. And I keep saying, that’s why you should listen to me. Because I’ve been through this in government, and since leaving office I’ve been studying it the whole time.\n\n“One thing that is quite interesting to me is how poor Western governments are at the moment—and I don’t exempt mine from this—how poor they are at understanding what’s going on in the world. I mean, I find my own understanding of the Middle East, but also further afield, just so much more sophisticated and deep [now] than the understanding I had in government, even with all that infrastructure”—the intelligence services and foreign office and so on. Understanding the developing world in particular, Blair said, is something that eludes governments in Europe and America.\n\nBlair mentioned Egypt, and the toppling of Hosni Mubarak and the coming to power of the Muslim Brotherhood. “People were saying, ‘Maybe they’ll turn out all right.’ I was saying, they’re not going to turn out all right. Look, I took a view right at the outset that the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt was a disaster. I supported the street movement to get [Morsi] out of power and put Sisi in office. That doesn’t mean I don’t criticize them for some of the things that happened in Egypt.” But, Blair says, “I helped him. I have been very happy to help. But I’m not some sort of adviser to Sisi. The U.A.E. supports him and helps him with people, and at a certain point we suggested people that he could go and get to help them.” Because of that relationship, “I was able to help in ensuring that Egypt was involved and was in the pole position in negotiating a cease-fire. There is going to be no peace between Israelis and Palestinians without the effective participation of Egypt.”\n\nOne area Blair can’t speak about very freely is his role at the Quartet. When I told him that not many Americans have much awareness of the organization, he responded under his breath, “Or anyone else.” When I asked what he felt he might accomplish, he actually sighed. “The Quartet,” he said, “was constructed in the time of the Bush administration really to manage the international community. My mandate is basically on the economy and preparing Palestinians for statehood.” But, he added, “if the politics break down it’s very hard to do that.” And since 2011 “the process has broken down.” The work of the Quartet, as a result, is “deeply frustrating and extremely difficult.”\n\nBlair maintained that his government advisory work isn’t nearly as lucrative as people think it is. He described it not as work for hire but as work that can change the character of countries. “The question you have to ask yourself is: Why is it that in the 1960s—take Singapore, South Korea, Sierra Leone, and Iraq—why is it that they all had the same G.D.P. and today two of them are First World and two of them manifestly aren’t? And the answer to that is the quality of government and the decisions made.”\n\nI asked if he has ever run into troubling conflicts because he wears so many hats. Referring to Tony Blair Associates, his first response was to say what any public figure might say: “We have incredibly strict rules we apply.” Then he went on to argue that, to a certain extent, strict rules don’t really apply to him. “I am a private-sector individual,” he said. “So, I will go and meet with some people connected with the Africa foundation, and some people connected with the Quartet, and I’m also chairman of the JPMorgan advisory council. I’m a private individual. I’m not a government department! One of the things people are going to have to get used to is: you are going to get leaders leaving office in their early 50s. I have a lot of energy. I feel extremely fit. There’s no way I’m going to retire and play golf.” Blair shifted in his chair. “You look at someone like Henry,” he said, referring to Henry Kissinger. “He’s 91 and he’s still going strong. I love that. Or Shimon Peres! These are my role models.”\n\nAnd is there anyone he wouldn’t work for? For instance, would he serve as a consultant to Vladimir Putin if Putin called asking for advice? Blair smiled, and switched the topic to Kazakhstan. He said, “I choose the people that I’m working with because I know we are trying to do good things with them. Right? So, to give you an example: Kazakhstan is the size of Western Europe, sandwiched between Russia and China. It has to be and is a partner with Russia; it’s making sure it is also an independent country. And it is a majority Muslim country that has welcomed the building of a synagogue in the last few years. So it is a strategically important country for the West. I am not oblivious to the challenges these countries have—the evolution they should have on democracy and human rights.”\n\nHe paused and then added, “I’m not holding my breath for the call from Putin.” But if it came?, I asked. “It won’t come, so let me not either praise or insult.”\n\nVI. “Torture in a Tin”\n\nIn late July, in the midst of the war in Gaza, Blair threw a 60th-birthday party for his wife, Cherie, with 150 people at their Buckinghamshire country house, with dinner, dancing, and a comedy routine—performed for free—by the British comedian Bobby Davro. The Daily Mail covered the event, scathingly, noting that the Blairs enjoyed “foie gras and a freebie show” even as the “death toll in Gaza passed 1,050.” The reference to a freebie show was a dig at Cherie, whose propensity for accepting complimentary services and favors while at Downing Street was widely mocked in the British press. The article noted that PETA had put out a statement in response to the news that the party had served foie gras: “The Blairs are out of touch with many things, including the majority of the British public, who rightly want nothing to do with this torture in a tin.”\n\nIt is not only Blair’s lifestyle that draws negative attention. There is also his continuing participation in public debate. “He wants to be taken seriously—from David Geffen’s yacht—admonishing people for not bombing Syria,” a former associate told me, referring to Blair’s comments last year as the West was contemplating military action against Bashar al-Assad’s regime. “People wince at the thought of intervention,” Blair wrote in The Times of London, “but contemplate the future consequence of inaction and shudder.” Around the same time he traveled to Sardinia and was spotted by reporters on the smaller of David Geffen’s yachts, the Pelorus.\n\n“He’s a very curious individual,” Robert Harris told me. “The truth is whatever he perceives it to be at a given moment. I don’t think he’s ever really—I mean, lying. I think he becomes convinced at the moment he’s saying something that it’s true.” In the end, Harris has come to see Blair as fundamentally perplexing, a cipher. The appealing thing about young Tony Blair, he recalled, was that he was “completely natural, pragmatic, sensible, funny, self-deprecating—a pricker of pomposity, and very informal. He seemed the kind of guy you’d go on holiday with, or you’d live next door to and become good friends with.” Which made Blair’s subsequent transformation all the more jarring.\n\nThe most haunting thing about listening to Harris speak about Blair, to my ear, was that his tone wasn’t angry. The most haunting thing was that it was wistful about what might have been.\n\nThe Which Blair Project\n\n1 / 6"
