        "text": "In freedom’s cause\n\nA name that has been present in Scotland from earliest times, Blair and its popular spelling variants that include Blare and Blaire, is derived from the Gaelic blar, indicating a field, normally a field of battle, or an open plain.\n\nIt is through this that it lends its name to several locations in Scotland that include Blair Atholl, Blairduff, Blairgowrie and Blairmore.\n\nAlthough now found in large numbers throughout Scotland in particular and the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, North America, Australia and New Zealand in general, Ayrshire and Perthshire are recognised as being the earliest territorial homes of two separate Scottish families of the name.\n\nIt was in what is now East Ayrshire, near the village of Darvel, that the Blairs flourished for centuries as the Blairs of Blair, while they also prospered in Perthshire as the Blairs of Balthayock.\n\nThe barony of Blair in Ayrshire was granted in the early years of the twelfth century, while the Barony of the Blairs of Balthayock, near Kinnoull, was granted during the same period.\n\nBlair House in Ayrshire, also known as Blair Castle, survives to this day as the highly impressive venue for functions ranging from weddings to both corporate and private hospitality.\n\nSet within 400 acres of gardens and parklands and now owned by Luke and Caroline Borthwick, who trace a descent from the original Blairs of Blair, the castle has played host over the centuries to iconic historical figures that include Mary, Queen of Scots.\n\nIn Perthshire, Balthayock Castle remained the seat of the Blairs of Balthayock for almost 500 years, and its still hauntingly beautiful ruins dominate the local landscape to this day.\n\nIt was as staunch defenders of Scotland’s freedom and independence that proud bearers of the Blair name first stamped their mark on the bloody tapestry that is the nation’s early history.\n\nKnighted during the reign from 1249 to 1286 of Alexander III, Sir Bryce de Blare was one of 18 Scottish nobles who were treacherously killed in June of 1296 after an English army under the command of Edward I, known as ‘the Hammer of the Scots’, invaded the northern kingdom and seized control of key strategic points.\n\nThese included the west coast port of Ayr and its castle – and it was here that Sir Bryce and his fellow noblemen were lured under the impression they had been invited to take part in negotiations.\n\nIn what has become known as the shameful ‘Barns of Ayr’ incident, they were overpowered by the English garrison of the castle and unceremoniously hanged from the rafters of one of its barns.\n\nIn May of the following year, the great freedom fighter William Wallace raised the banner of revolt against the English occupation of his homeland after slaying Sir William Heselrig, Sheriff of Lanark, in revenge for the killing of his young wife, Marion.\n\nProving an expert in the tactics of guerrilla warfare, Wallace and his hardened band of freedom fighters inflicted stunning defeats on the English garrisons.\n\nThis culminated in the liberation of practically all of Scotland following the battle of Stirling Bridge, on September 11, 1297.\n\nThe forces of Wallace and his able commander Sir William Murray had earlier met up and prepared to face yet another mighty English invasion force that had been hurriedly despatched north by Edward.\n\nDespite having a force of only thirty-six cavalry and 8,000 foot soldiers, compared to an army under the Earl of Surrey that boasted no less than 200 knights and 10,000 foot soldiers, the Scots held a strategic advantage that they exploited to the full.\n\nPositioning their forces on the heights of the Abbey Craig, on the outskirts of Stirling, and where the imposing Wallace Monument now stands, Wallace and Murray waited patiently as Essex’s force slowly made its way across a narrow wooden bridge that spanned the waters of the Forth.\n\nAs the bulk of the English army crossed onto the marshy ground at the foot of the Abbey Craig, the piercing blast of a hunting horn signalled a ferocious charge down the hillside of massed ranks of Scottish spearmen.\n\nTrapped on the boggy ground, the English were incapable of putting up any effective resistance.\n\nThey were hacked to death in their hundreds, while many others drowned in the fast-flowing waters of the Forth in their heavy armour as they attempted to make their way back across the narrow bridge.\n\nDefeated at the battle of Falkirk on July 22, 1298, after earlier being appointed Guardian of Scotland, Sir William Wallace was eventually betrayed and captured in August of 1305.\n\nOn the black day for Scotland of August 23 of that year, he was brutally executed in London on the orders of a vengeful Edward.\n\nOne important chronicler of the life and times of Wallace was his chaplain, John Blair, the Benedictine monk born near Fife.\n\nAs Wallace’s chaplain, Blair was a first-hand observer of both the freedom fighter’s defeats and victories – and his chronicle is thought to have provided the main source material for the bard Blind Harry’s epic poem Blind Harry’s Wallace, written about 172 years after the freedom fighter’s execution.\n\nBoth the date of Blair’s birth and death are not known with certainty, but what is known is that he died some years after Wallace at the Benedictine monastery in Dunfermline.\n\nBearers of the Blair name were also prominent, as the Wars of Independence continued, in their support of the warrior king Robert the Bruce.\n\nNoted among these was Roger de Blare, a nephew of Sir Bryce de Blare, and who was knighted by Bruce for his part in the king’s victory at the battle of Bannockburn, when a 20,000-strong English army under Edward II was defeated by a Scots army less than half this strength.\n\nIronically, it was through a misguided sense of chivalry that the battle occurred in the first place.\n\nBy midsummer of 1313 the mighty fortress of Stirling Castle was occupied by an English garrison under the command of Sir Philip Mowbray.\n\nBruce’s brother, Edward, agreed to a pledge by Mowbray that if the castle was not relieved by battle by midsummer of the following year, then he would surrender.\n\nThis made battle inevitable, and by June 23 of 1314 the two armies faced one another at Bannockburn, in sight of the castle.\n\nIt was on this day that Bruce slew the English knight Sir Henry de Bohun in single combat, but the battle proper was not fought until the following day, shortly after the rise of the midsummer sun.\n\nThe English cavalry launched a desperate but futile charge on the densely packed ranks of Scottish spearmen known as schiltrons, and by the time the sun had sank slowly in the west the English army had been totally routed, with Edward himself only narrowly managing to make his escape from the carnage of the battlefield.\n\nScotland’s independence had been secured, to the glory of Bruce and his loyal army and supporters such as Roger de Blare and at terrible cost to the English.\n\nIn the seventeenth century, bearers of the Blair name became embroiled in the bitter religious controversies of their time.\n\nBorn in 1593 in Irvine, Ayrshire, Robert Blair went through many trials, including excommunication for his Presbyterian views, before serving for a time as Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.\n\nHe was a supporter of the National Covenant – which renounced Catholic belief, pledged to uphold the Presbyterian religion, and called for free parliaments and assemblies.\n\nSigned at Edinburgh’s Greyfriars Church on February 28, 1638 by Scotland’s nobles, barons, burgesses and ministers such as Blair, it was subscribed to the following day by hundreds of ordinary people.\n\nCopies were made and dispatched around Scotland and signed by thousands more.\n\nThose who adhered to the Covenant were known as Covenanters, and many such as Blair, hounded by the merciless authorities, literally took to the hills of south and southwest Scotland to worship at what were known as open-air conventicles.\n\nElected Moderator of the General Assembly in 1646, he fell foul of the authorities following the Restoration of Charles II in 1660 – and it was then that he took to the hills for a time as a Covenanter; he died in 1666.\n\nPolitics and the pen\n\nIn rather more peaceful times, one of the Covenanting Robert Blair’s grandsons was his namesake, the Scottish poet Robert Blair, born in Edinburgh in 1699 and whose best known work is the blank verse poem The Grave, published three years before his death in 1746.\n\nHe was the father of the eminent Scottish advocate and judge Robert Blair, Lord Avontoun, who was born in Edinburgh in 1741.\n\nSolicitor General for Scotland from 1789 to 1806 and Dean of the Faculty of Advocates from 1801 to 1808, he also served as Lord President of the Court of Session from 1808 until his death three years later.\n\nAnother distinguished bearer of the name was the Church of Scotland minister Hugh Blair, who came to the fore during the great flowering of creative talent known as the Scottish Enlightenment.\n\nBorn in 1718 in Edinburgh, the son of a merchant, before his death in 1800 he became noted as the author of a number of religious discourses and also for his Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles Lettres and A Critical Dissertation on the Poems of Ossian, Son of Fingal.\n\nBorn in Banffshire in 1656, James Blair was the Scottish clergyman who, after being ordained as a minister in the Church of Scotland, was later ordained in the Church of England.\n\nAppointed Commissary in the Virginia Colony in 1687, he later became instrumental in the foundation of what remains to this day the centre of educational excellence known as the College of William and Mary, in Williamsburg, Virginia; he died in 1743.\n\nWilliamsburg was also the birthplace in 1732 of John Blair, recognised as one of the Founding Fathers of the United States.\n\nA delegate from Virginia to the Constitutional Convention, in September of 1789 he was appointed by George Washington to the Supreme Court of the United States; he died in 1800, while Blair Street, in Madison, Wisconsin, was later named in his honour.\n\nA controversial figure to this day over his support of, and British participation in, former U.S. President George W. Bush’s invasion of Afghanistan in 2001 and the invasion of Saddam Hussein’s Iraq two years later, Tony Blair is the former Labour Party politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from May of 1997 to June of 2007.\n\nBorn Anthony Charles Lynton Blair in Edinburgh in 1953, he went on after education at Fettes College, Edinburgh, and Oxford University, to become a lawyer before entering politics in 1983 as Member of Parliament (MP) for the English seat of Sedgefield West.\n\nHe was selected as leader of the Labour Party eleven years later, and in a landslide General Election victory in 1997 became the youngest British Prime Minister to hold the post since 1812 – while it was also under his leadership of the Labour Party that the term ‘New Labour’ was coined.\n\nDespite criticism of his policy on Afghanistan and Iraq, he is recognised as having played a key role in the Northern Ireland peace process and for his successful interventions in war-torn Kosovo in 1999 and Sierra Leone in 2001.\n\nA recipient of the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom in addition to a number of other honours, he has also held the post of Middle East Peace Envoy, while his autobiography, A Journey, was published in 2010.\n\nThe former Prime Minister’s father, Leo Blair, born in 1923 in Filey, Yorkshire, the son of travelling entertainers, is the retired lecturer in law who was raised by adoptive parents in the Govan area of Glasgow.\n\nTony Blair’s brother, Sir William Blair, born in 1950, is the prominent lawyer who was appointed a British High Court judge in 2008.\n\nKnown also by her professional name of Cherie Booth, Cherie Blair is the lawyer who married Tony Blair in 1980.\n\nBorn in 1954 in Bury, Lancashire, a daughter of the actor Tony Booth and the actress Gale Howard, she is now patron of the charitable Cherie Blair Foundation and author of the 2008 autobiography Speaking for Myself.\n\nA contemporary of Tony Blair during part of his tenure as Prime Minister, Ian Blair served as Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, London, from 2005 to 2008.\n\nBorn in 1953 in Cheshire, the former police officer was appointed a life peer in the House of Lords in 2010 as Baron Blair of Boughton, in the County of Cheshire.\n\nCombining both music and politics, Harold Blair was the Australian tenor and activist on behalf of Aboriginal rights who was born in 1924 on the Cherbourg Aboriginal Reserve, Queensland.\n\nIt was after entering a radio talent show in 1945 that he was able to formally study music, including at the famed Julliard School, New York.\n\nHe was offered a three-year singing contract by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in 1951, but tragedy struck when he lost his voice.\n\nWith his music career now seemingly at an end, he took on a number of other jobs, including working in a hardware store, before being appointed a teacher of music at the Conservatorium in Melbourne.\n\nAlso serving on the Aboriginal Arts Board as a passionate advocate of Aboriginal rights, he died in 1976 – after being appointed a member of the Order of Australia.\n\nThe Australian electoral division of Blair, in Queensland, was named in his honour in 1998."
