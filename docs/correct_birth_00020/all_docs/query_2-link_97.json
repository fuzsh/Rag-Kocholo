        "text": "WHEN Sir Tony Blair swept to victory in May 1997, he became the youngest Prime Minister in a century.\n\nThe former PM remains an active voice in UK politics, but how old is he, and what's his net worth?\n\nWhat is Tony Blair's background?\n\nSir Tony was Labour's longest serving PM, and lead the party to three consecutive general election victories.\n\nBut before his meteoric rise to the top of politics, he had other ambitions.\n\nMr Blair went to Fettes public school in Edinburgh with dreams of becoming a rock music producer.\n\nHowever, he chose to study law at Oxford, then trained as a barrister.\n\nHe then became an MP for Sedgefield in 1983, working his way up through the Labour Party to become Leader in 1994.\n\nAt the age of 43, just days before his birthday in May 1997, he became the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\n\nHe held the position in Downing Street for ten years.\n\nHow old is Tony Blair?\n\nAnthony Charles Lynton Blair was born in Edinburgh on May 6, 1953.\n\nIt makes the politician 69 years old.\n\nWho is Tony Blair's wife Cherie and do they have children?\n\nCherie Blair, who was born Cherie Booth, is a British barrister, judge and lecturer who grew up in Liverpool.\n\nShe is the daughter of the actor Tony Booth, best known as Alf Garnett's son-in-law.\n\nTony and Cherie met when they were both pupil barristers.\n\nThey have four children.\n\nTheir son Euan worked at banking giant Morgan Stanley before founding a start-up, White Hat.\n\nThe company - which is now called Multiverse - was valued at £1.36 billion in a funding round in June 2022, The Times reported.\n\nThey also have football agent son, Nicky, a daughter Kathryn who is a lawyer, and their youngest son Leo.\n\nCherie is a QC who has appeared in a number of high profile court cases, and also worked as a patron of Breast Cancer Care.\n\nIn the 2013 New Year's Honours, she was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for her services to women's issues and charity.\n\nShe was accused of being greedy in the property market, amid claims of rent-hiking at a block of flats owned by her family.\n\nWhat is Tony Blair's net worth?\n\nAccounts of Blair's wealth vary, with some estimates placing it as high as £100m.\n\nHowever a Telegraph investigation discovered in 2015 that his personal fortune amounted to £60m.\n\nThe Blair family reportedly jumped on the property gravy train, snapping up more than two dozen flats in Manchester and amassing £27m worth of property, The Guardian reported.\n\nSome commentators have noted that the property boom which made homes unaffordable for under 40s - but a cash cow for buy-to-let landlords - began accelerating during his time in office.\n\nTheir real estate portfolio included a house in London’s Connaught Square that cost them £3.65 in 2004 - now worth £8.4m.\n\nWhat is Tony Blair doing now?\n\nBlair is currently executive chairman of the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, which states that since leaving office he has been \"supporting governments to deliver effectively for their people, working for peace in the Middle East and countering extremism\".\n\nA decade after he relinquished his role as PM, Blair announced a political comeback, saying he was motivated by Brexit.\n\nHe also hinted at starting up his own party and has taken an active role in a consultancy business, as well as running a foundation in his own name - the Tony Blair Faith Foundation.\n\nHe reportedly charges as much as £200,000 from a single speaking gig.\n\nHe has also made a series of digs at the ex-Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn.\n\nIn 2018 he said Mr Corbyn was alienating both sides of the Brexit debate with his muddled EU strategy.\n\nSir Tony was vocal during the Covid pandemic and was one of the first to advocate prioritising giving one jab rather than two doses of the vaccine.\n\nIn 2022 he was appointed a Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter.\n\nYou can find out more about the honour he received here."
