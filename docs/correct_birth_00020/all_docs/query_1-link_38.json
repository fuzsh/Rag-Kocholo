        "text": "Present: Leadership\n\nAnthony Charles Lynton (Tony) Blair, former British Prime Minister, is one of the most outstanding statesmen of our era.\n\nFrom the time he assumed leadership of the British Labor Party in 1994 until he stepped down as prime minister in 2007, Blair showed exceptional intelligence and foresight and demonstrated moral courage and leadership.\n\nHe has consistently asked the important questions and thought deeply about the interconnected world of the 21st century. Soon after being elected prime minister, Blair came to two beliefs that guide him to this day: It is a mistake to wait for the U.S. to solve all of the world’s tough challenges, and some things that a state may do within its borders justify intervention – even if the actions do not directly threaten another nation’s interests.\n\nUpon stepping down as prime minister in 2007, Blair was appointed Middle East envoy for the United Nations, European Union, United States, and Russia, also known as the Middle East Quartet, with the goal of bringing stability and peace to the region. He held this post until his resignation in 2015.\n\nThroughout his career, Tony Blair has acted on the basis of what he believes to be right, a hallmark of strong leadership."
