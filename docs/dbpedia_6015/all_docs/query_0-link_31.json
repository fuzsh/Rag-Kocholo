        "text": "When you hear the giraffe yelling ''Mayday!'' at the start of Zookeeper, take heed; it's a signal you are about to witness a disaster.\n\nA gorilla slow dancing with a pretty blonde in a bar, a monkey ordering pizza by phone and an elephant using hypnotic powers swinging its trunk saying ''You remember nothing'' are a few forgettable moments in this inane, charmless comedy that is embarrassing, not funny. In keeping with the film's theme, answer this: if there was a pile of dung in your path, would you step into it or avoid it? Then avoid this.\n\nThe script (credited to five screenwriters including Kevin James) pits blonde, leggy bimbo Stephanie (Bibb) and intelligent, beautiful brunette Kate (Dawson) with clumsy, fat, animal-loving dude Griffin (James), whose pratfalls and attempts at humour are equally clumsy.\n\nThe notion is that the animals in the zoo where Griffin works as zookeeper finally discard their code of silence and speak to him, to show him how to get the girl - by snorting, roaring, digging, being predatory and peeing against a tree (or in a pot plant). Swinging on curtains and smashing into an ice carving at a wedding are also on the cards. Most of the humour falls painfully flat.\n\nI did laugh, however, when Griffin takes the gorilla from the zoo (wearing a T-shirt) to a diner. He covers by saying they've come from a fancy dress party and the waitress, impressed by the realism, asks if she could try on the gorilla head.\n\nThe lively banter between the two bears is also mildly amusing.\n\nIt's a waste of the strong line-up of voice talent that includes Cher, Adam Sandler, Sylvester Stallone, Nick Nolte, Judd Apatow and Jon Favreau, while director Frank Coraci (The Wedding Singer) obviously got lost in the jungle.\n\nSTARRING: KEVIN JAMES, ROSARIO DAWSON, LESLIE BIBB\n\nRATED PG"
