        "text": "Movie Theme Night: The Zookeeper\n\nEvery Saturday we will be sharing with you our ideas for family movie nights. Movie reviews and fun theme night ideas.\n\nOur Super-Cool-Fab Review Team...\n\nOur crack team of expert Movie Reviewers are this week reviewing The Zookeeper, a kid-friendly comedy with a side-dish of romance.\n\nThis is not actually a kids movie, it's more of a slapstick rom-com, but our kids really enjoyed it. They particularly liked the physical humour and the talking animals. Animal antics are always a guaranteed crowd-pleaser around here.\n\nMovie Plot Summary: After proposing marriage in spectacular fashion to his super-hot girlfriend and being shot down in flames, Griffin (the Zookeeper) is left rather gun-shy of romance. Six years later the ex-girlfriend turns up on the scene and wants him back - but only if he'll leave his job as a Zookeeper (which she consider a bit naff) and become a high-flying businessman. The animals at the zoo (who can secretly speak English with a New York accent) don't want to lose their favourite zookeeper so they break their code of silence and begin to coach him in the ways of love.\n\nOK it sounds completely ridiculous, but it's kinda funny, and the kids loved it. It's gotta be better than watching the Wiggles at least!\n\nHere's what our experts have to say about The Zookeeper\n\nDash. B. Cool: \"I liked the movie it was cool and funny. It's good for family movies, I think everyone would enjoy it. The funniest creatures in the movie were the monkey, the zookeeper (Griffin) the bears and the wolf. It's like every movie when animals talk, it kind of makes it funny.\"\n\nDash scores this movie's \"coolness\" as: ♥♥♥♥♥\n\nFoxy Fab:\"I liked the Zookeeper because it was funny. I liked when the monkey said he was so blessed, that as my favourite part. And also because it was romantic. My other favourite part was when the gorilla was happy again and they were reunited at the zoo.\"\n\nFoxy rates this movie's \"fabness\" as: ♥♥♥♥♥\n\nSuper Scrag: \"It was cool, I liked the man and the girl and I like the part where the girl says she's not gonna marry him. My favourite animal was the gorilla. I liked when he pretended he was a man wearing a gorilla suit; it was funny.\"\n\nSuperScrag scores this movie's \"super-ness\" as: ♥♥♥♥♥\n\n..............\n\nThis movie is rated (PG) but I am struggling to recall any scenes that would be considered dodgey? There's nothing scary in the movie, no sex scenes and little (if any) bad language. I'm really not sure why this movie isn't actually rated (G). Perhaps because it's mainly about the Zookeeper finding love and that may need some explaining to younger children.\n\nIdeas to Make Your \"Zookeeper\" Movie Night even more Super-Cool-Fab...\n\nIt's so easy to make a zoo-themed dinner and food. On the menu you can have all kinds of fruit and veges, meat, fish nuts... anything animals eat. Kids can dress up as their favourite animal; if you're really keen you can make some cute animal cupcakes for dessert.\n\n(you also borrow some Jungle Party ideas for your theme night)\n\nWhat are your best Movie Night Ideas? Send me an email with your ideas (include a picture or link to a blog post if you can) so I can feature it here on Saturday Night at the Movies.\n\nHave a great Saturday!\n\n♥"
