        "text": "Kevin James has found his ultimate screen partner: an unconvincing animatronic gorilla.\n\nVoiced by gravel throated Nick Nolte, Bernie the Gorilla is at least as complex and expressive as his human co-star in \"Zookeeper.\" The object of poor treatment at the hands of a meanie zookeeper played by Donnie Wahlberg, Bernie is bummed, stuck in an enclosure with only cement as scenery. He yearns to one day get out and visit a classy good-time foodrinkery such as T.G.I. Friday's. Did I mention that Bernie can speak? English?\n\nYep. Same goes for the rest of the animals in the zoo. It’s a secret, kept until the animals learn that their beloved zookeeper Griffin (James) is considering a career change. Like Bernie, Griffin is in a funk, the result of his being dumped by his girlfriend in the middle of his elaborately staged marriage proposal. So he and the ape become buddies, bonding over their depression, and they hit it off, hooting and rapping and hitting on secretaries together.\n\nBernie, who resembles a moldering castoff robot from a Showbiz Pizza Place stage, has one note: sad eyes. James, too, has one note: schmuckiness. At least Bernie has the self-respect to not pratfall at every available opportunity like James, who so desperately milks his fat-guy-fall-down shtick, it makes a body yearn for the nuance he displayed in “Paul Blart: Mall Cop.”\n\nFILM REVIEW 'Zookeeper'\n\n1 1/2 stars (out of 4)\n\nRated: PG for some rude and suggestive humor, language\n\nCast: Kevin James, Rosario Dawson, Leslie Bibb, the voice of Nick Nolte\n\nDirector: Frank Coraci\n\nRun time: 104 minutes\n\nGriffin inevitably gives up his beloved animals and the cute veterinarian (Rosario Dawson) who calls him “The Hippo Whisperer” and inexplicably makes goo-goo eyes at him. He leaves them for an icky superficial woman (Leslie Bibb, shrill) and a job as a salesman of expensive imported sports cars. In one scene, he must force his mildly blubbery frame behind the wheel of a Lamborghini. This moment provides not only a “joke,” but what passes for symbolic character detail. Is it not obvious that he DOES NOT FIT in this new life?\n\nMiddle-schoolers, the primary audience for “Zookeeper,” will find little interest in the peabrained rom-com crapola director Frank Coraci and a legion of writers wedge between the talking-animal stuff. The movie is populated with a real giraffe (voice of Maya Rudolph), lion couple (Sylvester Stallone and Cher), monkey (Adam Sandler, channeling Gilbert Gottfried) and elephant (Judd Apatow) with constantly chattering CGI mouths. The monkey gets all the reaction shots, of course.\n\nMost of these creatures surely must be difficult to wrangle on a movie set, and therefore remain largely static, leaving all the physical comedy to the humans. As it is, the only species the Humane Society will allow to be tripped and pummeled on camera is homo sapiens, so James fills the need repeatedly.\n\nHere, the deathless, sacred idea of a monkey throwing feces is only referenced, never fulfilled. Which leaves Dawson flinging a viscous wad of lion saliva in James’ face. And the resident wolf (Bas Rutten) teaching Griffin that “it’s all about the pee-pee” when it comes to capturing a desired female. Griffin therefore whizzes in the potted plants at a wedding reception to mark his territory.\n\nThere is only one reason movies like “Zookeeper” exist: So everybody gets paid. Sandler and James are credited producers, and the production company is Happy Madison, Sandler’s imprint, notorious for churning out cheap slapdash comedies for maximum profit. Did I mention there’s a scene set in a T.G.I. Friday’s, where apes and men have riotous fun, delicious food and tasty beverages? As for the always-appealing Dawson - work is work, I guess.\n\nJames isn’t imminently unlikeable in this, or anything really, but if he were any more middle-of-the-road, the city would paint a yellow stripe on him. He’s a roly-poly cross between the Pillsbury Doughboy and, I dunno, Tim Allen. He certainly must be thrilled that his paychecks are large, and his pre-production workout regime requires eating doughnuts and denting the sofa. He mugs and hits the turf so often, he’s practically a cartoon character, which makes him the perfect character complement for a mechanical primate."
