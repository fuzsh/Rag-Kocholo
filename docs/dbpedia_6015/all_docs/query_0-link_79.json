        "text": "Kevin James blends blue-collar bravado with animal magnetism in \"Zookeeper.\"\n\nThe result is sometimes quite charming, even if the PG-rated picture is so simplistically structured that just about every audience member will know all of the punch lines and plot twists.\n\nIn this broad $80 million comedy, Griffin Keyes (James), an unlucky-in-love zoo employee, needs help in the romance department when it comes to winning back the heart of a status-seeking woman (Leslie Bibb of \"Iron Man\") who rejected his marriage proposal. The animals he cares for so carefully and lovingly reward him by revealing they have the gift of speech and impart various observations - including encouraging him to notice a fellow zoo employee (talented Rosario Dawson of \"Seven Pounds\") - when it comes to matters of the heart.\n\nThey mean well, of course, but sometimes their words of wisdom cause the sweet-natured Griffin to endure painful slapstick silliness.\n\nFor the voices, director Frank Coraci (\"The Wedding Singer\") hired talents such as Sylvester Stallone (lion), Cher (lioness), Don Rickles (frog) and Maya Rudolph (giraffe). Adam Sandler steals much of the film by voicing hilarious lines as Donald the Capuchin Monkey, an energetic creature who constantly brags to fellow animals that he's superior due to having thumbs like humans.\n\nMuch of the heart of \"Zookeeper,\" which stresses a theme about not having to embrace a materialistic lifestyle to be happy, is developed via Bernie the Gorilla (voice by Nick Nolte) and James' character. The depressed gorilla, who was abused in secret by a sadistic zoo employee who claims Bernie attacked him, wants more out of life than to be kept in solitary confinement in a dark, concrete holding area. (It's highly disappointing that the evil zoo worker receives only a slapstick comeuppance for his harsh treatment of the gorilla.)\n\nThe kindly Griffin takes Bernie out for a night on the town that's both hilarious and heartfelt.\n\nThe 46-year-old James made his fortune on the funny sitcom \"The King of Queens\" and enjoyed big-screen success in \"Hitch\" with Will Smith, \"I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry\" with Adam Sandler, and \"Grown Ups,\" an ensemble headed by Sandler. His bland but successful solo favorite \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop\" (2009) grossed an astronomical $183.2 million worldwide.\n\nRather than taking a step forward with something even mildly challenging, James decided to stay in his comfort zone with \"Zookeeper.\" Family viewers may be very happy about that.\n\nFILM REVIEW\n\n\"Zookeeper\"\n\nGrade: B-\n\nStarring: Kevin James, Rosario Dawson and Leslie Bibb and voice talents Sylvester Stallone, Nick Nolte, Adam Sandler, Don Rickles and Cher; screenplay by Nick Bakay, Rock Reuben, Kevin James, Jay Scherick and David Ronn; directed by Frank Coraci.\n\nRunning Time: 104 minutes.\n\nParental Guide: PG rating (some rude and suggestive humor, language."
