        "text": "Zookeepers-wife.jpg\n\nJessica Chastain stars in \"The Zookeeper's Wife.\"\n\n(Courtesy of Focus Features)\n\nCLEVELAND, Ohio -- I was so looking forward to seeing a lion devour a member of the Gestapo in \"The Zookeeper's Wife.\" But it was not to be.\n\nThe movie is based on the true World War II story of Dr. Jan and Antonina Zabinski, a Polish couple who owned a zoo in Warsaw and saved the lives of 300 Jewish people who were hiding out from Nazi persecution.\n\nSince the movie is based on a true story and the book of the same name written by best-selling author Diane Ackerman, it's kind of a head-scratcher that the movie is so vague and often downright confusing.\n\nIt doesn't get anything in the story wildly wrong; it just leaves a lot of questions about the main characters' motivations -- about their actions regarding the invading Nazis and the underground Polish resistance -- unanswered.\n\nAs the movie opens in 1939, life at the Warsaw Zoo seems idyllic. The zoo owners, played by Jessica Chastain and Johan Heldenbergh, have a young son and an ark-load of exotic animals. Antonina is especially close to the elephants, and she successfully midwifes the troublesome birth of an elephant cub.\n\nThen the war and invasion begin, with the German bombing of the town and the animals scampering free through Warsaw after their cages and encampments are destroyed.\n\nAntonina has begun a relationship with a Nazi zoo owner from Berlin. He promises her he can shelter her animals safely at his zoo until the war has ended.\n\nMeanwhile, as her critters are running amok through Warsaw, she and her husband vow to hide Jews who are being sought after by the German occupiers.\n\nClearly, the couple is not Jewish, which is why they are not persecuted by the Nazis who have taken over the town. But their religious identity is never revealed. The audience is never given any insight into their courageous, selfless behavior, other than that they are kind.\n\nOne might assume from the title of the movie and the fact that the couple owns and operates a zoo that the care and feeding of these animals will somehow work its way into the story. But it really doesn't.\n\nEarly in the film, it's humorous to see camels, monkeys and zebras wandering the 1930s Polish city after the Nazis inadvertently bomb the zoo. But the presence of the animals only figures in the narrative as a way to show the cruelty of the Nazis when they occasionally execute the odd cantankerous elephant.\n\nAntonina develops a flirtatious relationship with the Nazi zoo owner from Berlin, but it is never made clear whether she actually has feelings for him or is merely stringing him along to distract him from the Jewish refugees who are hiding in her basement.\n\nIt's curious that a movie based on a well-documented true story -- the main characters were later honored in Israel for their efforts -- would be so fuzzy about the particulars of the main characters and their heroic, altruistic behavior.\n\nREVIEW\n\nThe Zookeeper's Wife\n\nWho: With Jessica Chastain, Johan Heldenbergh, Michael McElhatton, Daniel Bruhl, Anna Rust and Efrat Dor. Directed by Niki Caro.\n\nRated: PG-13.\n\nRunning time: 124 minutes.\n\nWhen: Opens Friday.\n\nWhere: Area theaters."
