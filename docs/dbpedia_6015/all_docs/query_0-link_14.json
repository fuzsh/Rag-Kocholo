        "text": "Love Of His Life\n\nFive years ago, Griffin (Kevin James) proposed to Stephanie, the love of his life. But Stephanie couldn’t get over the fact that Griffin was just a zookeeper. She always thought he’d grow into the man of her dreams - a big-wig with cash to spare who could keep up with her and her modeling career.\n\nFive Years Later\n\nNow, Griffin has been promoted to Lead Zookeeper and he enjoys his job at the zoo. But when Stephanie shows up at Griffin’s brother’s engagement party, Griffin’s feelings for her come flooding back. Even though Stephanie has an on-again, off-again jerk-of-a-boyfriend, Griffin is determined to win her back.\n\nTalking Animals\n\nWhen the zoo animals overhear Stephanie saying that she still has feelings for Griffin, they try to help him. But when their first attempts don’t work, the animals are left with no other choice but to reveal themselves - they can talk! At first, Griffin thinks he’s going crazy. But soon he develops friendships with the animals and takes their dating advice.\n\nJealousy & Sparks\n\nAt his brother’s wedding, Griffin invites Kate (Rosario Dawson), the animal doctor at the zoo, as his date. Their plan to make Stephanie jealous works perfectly. But over the course of the night, Kate and Griffin realize that they might have feelings for each other. Griffin must choose between the girl he always thought he wanted, and the perfect girl for him.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nZookeeper offers classic Kevin James comedy that will have you laughing every few minutes. The movie is heartfelt and hilarious. And the talking animals are extremely realistic. If you’re looking for a good laugh for the entire family, this is the perfect movie for you.\n\nZookeeper Movie Trailer\n\nZookeeper Rating:\n\nRelated Stories"
