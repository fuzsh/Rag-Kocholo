        "text": "Earlier this week, I wrote about how the red-carpet premiere of the movie Zookeeper would be in St. Louis, Missouri!\n\nThe St. Louis Zoo, which is one of America’s #1 Zoo by Zagat Survey and Parenting Magazine and one of the few free zoos in the nation, was the ONLY Zoo in the country that was chose to host a premiere of the movie!\n\nHeath and I were definitely excited to see this movie. We are huge fans of Kevin James and I thought Hayden would like the movie also, because he loves animals!\n\nWe got to the St. Louis Zoo early so I could stand by the red carpet to get some good photos! It was definitely exciting for our city to have Kevin James at the red carpet premiere of Zookeeper!\n\nThe crowds lined up to see local St. Louis athletes and of course, Kevin James!\n\nAfter pictures, I hurried into the theater to meet Heath and Hayden, who had snagged seats for the movie! They were asking people that had arrived to see Kevin James if they wanted to go see the movie, so I thought that was really nice!\n\nThey were also giving out popcorn and animal crackers, which Hayden loved! I was happy for the soda they were giving out (Hey, we got there at 8:30am, I needed the caffeine!).\n\nKevin James came out on the stage before the movie and thanked everyone for coming and talked about how awesome the St. Louis Zoo is (of course!).\n\nThen, it was movie time!\n\nHere’s a synopsis of Zookeeper:\n\nIn Zookeeper, the animals at the Franklin Park Zoo love their kindhearted caretaker, Griffin Keyes (Kevin James). Finding himself more comfortable with a lion than a lady, Griffin decides the only way to get a girl in his life is to leave the zoo and find a more glamorous job. The animals, in a panic, decide to break their time-honored code of silence and reveal their biggest secret: they can talk! To keep Griffin from leaving, they decide to teach him the rules of courtship – animal style. The film also stars Rosario Dawson and Leslie Bibb and features the voices of Cher, Nick Nolte, Adam Sandler, and Sylvester Stallone.\n\nI thought it was a great movie! Kevin James was hilarious, and it was a lot of physical comedy. The whole plot is that the animals are trying to give Kevin James tips on how to get his ex-girlfriend back (So think Hitch, but instead of Will Smith, there are animals! ). So while the overall plot was geared more for adults, the physical comedy and of course the talking animals held my son’s interest. Surprisingly, much more so than Cars 2!\n\nI highly recommend checking out Zookeeper! I f I had to describe it, I’d say it’s a mix of Hitch meets Night at the Museum with Kevin James hilarity thrown in!\n\nDisclosure: I was provided with a Press Pass for taking pictures at the event. The zoo and movie was free to the public."
