        "text": "Zookeeper\n\nThis topic contains:\n\noverall comments and recommendations\n\ndetails of classification and consumer advice lines for Zookeeper\n\na review of Zookeeper completed by the Australian Council on Children and the Media (ACCM) on 5 September 2011.\n\nOverall comments and recommendations\n\nAbout the movie\n\nThis section contains details about the movie, including its classification by the Australian Government Classification Board and the associated consumer advice lines. Other classification advice (OC) is provided where the Australian film classification is not available.\n\nACCM review\n\nThis review of the movie contains the following information:\n\na synopsis of the story\n\nthemes\n\nuse of violence\n\nmaterial that may scare or disturb children\n\nproduct placement\n\nsexual references\n\nnudity and sexual activity\n\nuse of substances\n\ncoarse language\n\nthe movie’s message\n\nA synopsis of the story\n\nFollowing a humiliating marriage proposal rejection by Stephanie (Leslie Bibb), Griffin Keyes (Kevin James) dedicates himself to bringing happiness to the lives of the animals in his charge. Years later, he unexpectedly meets up with Stephanie again and this rekindles his unrequited feelings towards her.\n\nGriffin decides that the only way to win Stephanie’s affection is to change into the kind of man she wants. For this reason, Griffin considers leaving the zoo to take up a higher paid, more prestigious job in his brother Dave’s car dealership. In an effort to prevent this move, the zoo animals work together to help Griffin win Stephanie back. The animals involved in this plot include Joe the lion (voice of Sylvester Stallone), his partner Janet (voice of Cher), Jerome the bear (voice of Jon Favreau) and his friend Bruce the bear (voice of Faizon Love), Bernie the gorilla (voice of Nick Nolte), Donald the monkey (voice of Adam Sandler), and Sebastian the wolf (voice of Bas Rutten).\n\nSeparation from loved ones; betrayal; adult relationships\n\nThere is a great deal of cartoon-style violence which does not depict realistic consequences. Examples include:\n\nBruce and Jerome the bears yell at each other and then begin slapping and wrestling one another;\n\nGriffin kicks Gale and tries to force him off the road while they are both cycling;\n\nGale repeatedly hits Griffin over the head and shoulders with a flexible plastic bicycle flag post.\n\nThere are also some more realistic depictions of verbal, physical and emotional violence, such as when:\n\nStephanie screams at Griffin;\n\nAn unidentified boy taunts, and throws things at, Jerome and Bruce the bears;\n\nGriffin kicks Shane with force in the groin, leaving him bent over and screaming;\n\nShane taunts Bernie the gorilla, and then throws an apple so that it hits a wall above, and shatters into pieces all over him. This is clearly done as an act of bullying and humiliation.\n\nBernie the gorilla describes the physically and emotionally abusive actions of zoo worker Shane;\n\nGriffin threatens to beat up Shane in front of his mother.\n\nMaterial that may scare or disturb children\n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned violent scenes, there are some scenes in this movie that could scare or disturb children under the age of five, including:\n\nClose-up shots of wild animals displaying aggression, such as Joe the lion roaring, Sebastian the wolf growling and baring his sharp teeth, and Bernie the gorilla screaming and thumping his chest.\n\nSeveral scenes depicting zoo animals escaping their cages and running loose among adults and children.\n\nAn unidentified boy falls into the bear enclosure and it appears that he will be attacked;\n\nAccidents involving Griffin being injured by animals, falling over, falling from heights, and hitting his head.\n\nGriffin clings to Bernie the gorilla’s back as he scales a very tall bridge, and it appears that either one or both will fall to their death.\n\nJanet the lion is rushed in to the zoo’s medical centre, with reports that she is not breathing and it initially appears that she will die.\n\nChildren in this age group may also be disturbed by some of the scenes described above.\n\nYounger children in this age group may also be disturbed by some of the scenes described above.\n\nChildren in this age group are unlikely to be disturbed by anything in this film\n\nProduct placement\n\nThere is some product placement, including\n\nVarious car brands\n\nRed Bull\n\nSexual references\n\nThere are a number of sexual references in this movie including:\n\nZoo worker Venom (Ken Jeong) greets Dave’s fiancé with an inappropriately long hug, and follows this with the suggestive comment, “you’re not married yet, right…”\n\nJerome the bear, giving advice to Griffin comments, “when I take down a female…”. He follows this up with a discussion about a female bear he once knew, who was, “born with an extra claw, and let me tell you, she knows how to use it…Canadian bears are wild!”\n\nSebastian the wolf discusses the behaviours that he feels, “attracts the ladies”;\n\nGale and Stephanie perform a sexually suggestive dance together;\n\nGriffin and Kate perform a sexually suggestive dance together;\n\nGriffin is forced to reach into both of male co-worker Venom’s front trouser pockets to find a car key. There is an unspoken suggestion that Venom has engineered this for his own perverse pleasure;\n\nGale says of himself and Stephanie, “we make out, hard”;\n\nGriffin says, “Robin is bendy”, with raised eyebrows, to which Dave adds, “yeah, agile”, while making a suggestive facial expression.\n\nNudity and sexual activity\n\nGriffin is shown taking a bath. Only his top half is visible.\n\nThere are also some scenes that imply inappropriate bodily exposure, such as when Griffin urinates against a tree in the zoo, and then again inside a restaurant. Whilst viewers are not able to see anything, on both occasions, it is implied that other characters see Griffin’s penis. There are also discussions about the sexual attractiveness of public urination.\n\nA passionate kiss between Kate and Griffin.\n\nUse of substances\n\nThere is some use of substances in this movie, including:\n\nsocial drinking of alcohol\n\nCoarse language\n\nThere are some coarse language, putdowns and toilet humour in this movie, including:\n\n“Freakin”; “Friggin”; “Fuuuu” (unfinished);\n\n“Jesus”; “God”; “Oh God”;\n\n“Hell”; “What the hell”;\n\n“It sucks”;\n\n“Awh crap”\n\n“That’s a stinkin’ pile”;\n\n“Sick freak”;\n\n“Willie Wonka” (said as a put-down);\n\n“Grandma hair”;\n\n“You come here, and I’ll use you as a loofah” (said as a threat).\n\nIn a nutshell\n\nZookeeper is a reasonably entertaining comedy, which may appeal to a cross-section of age groups, although it is not recommended for the under 8s. Much of the humour is derived from either sexual references or depictions of accidents involving physical discomfort or injury to the main character.\n\nThe film’s predominant message is that people cannot be happy or satisfied with life until they are able to be true to themselves. Unfortunately, there are some problematic subtexts, such as the notion that violence is an appropriate means of resolving conflict and therefore, those with the most power are likely to come out on top. Divorced or separated parents may be concerned about the film’s idealised depiction of “true” love as singular and life-long. In addition, the movie contains numerous discussions of the best ways to “get” a female, which could be interpreted as promoting a view of women as objects or possessions.\n\nValues in this movie that parents may wish to reinforce with their children include:\n\nloyalty;\n\nhonesty and integrity;\n\nteam work\n\nThis movie could also give parents the opportunity to discuss with their children attitudes and behaviours, and their real-life consequences, such as:"
