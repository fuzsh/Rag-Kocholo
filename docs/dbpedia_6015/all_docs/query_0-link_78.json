        "text": "VOICE OVER: Lisa Yang\n\nGet ready for a tearjerker. Here are 5 Facts about the film that you should know! Did you know that real animals were used and that there are no CG animals at all? That Antonina Żabińska inspired the source material? That Daniel Brühl was in another WWII movie, Inglourious Basterds.\n\nThey gave all they had to save all they could. Welcome to MsMojo and today we’re counting down our picks for the Top 5 Facts About “The Zookeeper’s Wife.”\n\n#5: It’s Not a Sequel to “Zookeeper”\n\nLet’s start off by acknowledging the elephant in the room: “The Zookeeper’s Wife” is in no way connected to the 2011 movie, “Zookeeper.” There’s no Kevin James, no wisecracking animals, and no shameless product placement for T.G.I. Friday’s. Rather, this true story centers on Antonina Żabińska and Jan Żabiński, a married couple that saved hundreds of human lives, as well as animal lives, during the Nazi regime in Poland. The only thing these two movies really have in common is that they both take place in a zoo. So if you were planning on taking the kids to see a lighthearted comedy, prepare to be caught off-guard.\n\n#4: The Trailer Song Has a Deeper Meaning\n\n“Varúð” by the Icelandic group Sigur Rós can be prominently heard throughout the trailer for this film. And the song actually has a deeper meaning that ties into the film’s themes. The English translation for “Varúð” is “Caution.” Most zoos have various caution signs to prevent visitors from falling into the animal pits. But of course, the animals are far from the greatest threat in this story. When our protagonists get involved in the Polish underground resistance, they risk their lives for the cause. As a result, the main characters must always remain cautious, as the Nazis could discover them at any time. Sometimes, it’s the subtlest of details that make a trailer a true work of art.\n\n#3: Daniel Brühl Was in Another WWII Movie\n\nIn one of the film’s most significant supporting roles, Golden Globe nominee Daniel Brühl plays Lutz Heck, a German zoologist who stole the most prized animals from the Warsaw Zoo. As for the animals he deemed to be of insignificant value, Heck allowed the soldiers to slaughter them for fun. This isn’t the first time Brühl has played a Nazi in a World War II movie: Brühl previously earned acclaim for his work in Quentin Tarantino’s “Inglourious Basterds.” He starred as Private First Class Fredrick Zoller, a German sniper who appears in a Nazi propaganda film. Given how chillingly effective Brühl was in that movie, this seems like a strong casting choice.\n\n#2: Real Animals Were Used\n\nComputer-generated animals have come a long way in recent years. Regardless, the filmmakers behind “The Zookeeper’s Wife” insisted on a more authentic approach. Before committing to the project, director Niki Caro made it clear that there would be no CG animals in her film. Cara stated in a DGA interview, “I wanted nothing I couldn’t film in-camera.” Thus, star Jessica Chastain got to cuddle with real lion cubs on the film’s set. Chastain even shot a scene with two real elephants, as her character helps the mother elephant give birth. While some actors probably would’ve found this intimidating, Chastain – a vegan, animal lover and rescue dog owner – apparently had no problem getting up close and personal with her four-legged co-stars.\n\n#1: Antonina Żabińska Inspired the Source Material\n\nAlthough Jan Żabiński was the director of the Warsaw Zoo, Antonina Żabińska is the primary focus in this true story. This is largely because she provided the inspiration for Diane Ackerman’s non-fiction book. While writing the book, Ackerman drew heavily from Antonina’s unpublished diary. In her journal, Antonina discusses how she worked alongside her husband to help save over 300 Jews during World War II. Since the diary was told from Antonina’s perspective, it only made sense that she should be the protagonist of Ackerman’s book, and the subsequent film adaptation. Published in 2007, “The Zookeeper’s Wife” went on to become an international best seller, reaching number 13 on the New York Times Nonfiction list.\n\nSo are you ready for a tearjerker? Which “Zookeeper’s Wife” fact do you find the most interesting? For more fascinating Top 10s and engaging Top 5s, be sure to subscribe to MsMojo.\n\nComments ∧"
