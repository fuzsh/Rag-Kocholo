        "text": "Mike Blakesley\n\nFilm God\n\nPosts: 12767\n\nFrom: Forsyth, Montana\n\nRegistered: Jun 99\n\nposted 03-31-2011 06:53 PM This was screened at CinemaCon.\n\nFirst I will have to say that the claim that there are \"no bad seats\" in the Colliseum at Caesers Palace might be true for concerts, but it's not true for movies. We arrived at this screening at the last minute due to a meeting that ran long, and wound up sitting quite far to one side. The picture was compromised, but the sound was still great.\n\nThe movie is OK. Kids'll like it a lot. The plot is typical Kevin James: Pudgy nerd wants the most beautiful woman in town, but when he finally bags her against all odds, she turns out to be a brainless ditz, so he winds up settling for the other woman who in real life would still be WAY out of his league, who always loved him from the start. The only difference between this and \"Paul Blart\" is that here, the animals of the zoo where he works try to help him along by passing along their \"mating tips\" which have the predictable consequences (poop humor, etc).\n\nThe animal effects are pretty good, but there are a few parts of the movie that were downright stupid. That said, it's good mindless family fun. 2.5 out of five stars from me.\n\nKudos also to the Sony marketing people, who managed to transform the lobby of the Colliseum into a real zoo for this event. The baby bear who peed all over the movie's director during his intro was pretty cool as well.\n\n| IP: Logged"
