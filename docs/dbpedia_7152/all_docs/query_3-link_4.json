        "text": "Medlands Hainaut webpage states:\n\n\"m ---. No reference has been found to the name or origin of the wife of Comte Reginar [II]. However, the introduction of the name Lietard into the Hainaut family after this marriage suggests that she may have been related to the family of the comtes de Huy (see Lower Lotharingian Nobility: Huy). If this is correct, she was --- [de Huy], daughter of ---. This would also explain why her grandson became comte de Louvain, which formed part of the territories relinquished by Ansfrid [II] Comte de Huy when he was appointed bishop of Utrecht in 995.\n\n\"Dhondt suggests that the wife of Reginar [III] was the sister of Comte Ansfrid [II], whose father was named Lambert, the name given by Reginar [III] to his younger son. In addition to the onomastic arguments, Dhondt comments that the voogdij of Gembloux abbey passed from Ansfrid [II] to Lambert [I] de Hainaut[32]. This provides an additional argument for a family relationship between the comtes de Huy and the comtes de Hainaut. However, Dhondt’s suggestion does not explain the introduction of the name Lietard into the Hainaut family. >On balance, it appears more likely that such a family connection was through the wife of Reginar [II] rather than the wife of Reginar [III]. If this is correct, it is possible that the wife of Reginar [II] was the paternal aunt of Ansfrid [II].\" — (5 Oct 2022)"
