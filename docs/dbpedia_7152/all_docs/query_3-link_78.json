Edward was born on 17 Jun 1239 in Palace of Westminster London Middlesex England and died on 7 Jul 1307 in Burgh by Sands Cumberland England at age 68.\n\nGeneral Notes: Wikipedia says, along with much, much more,\n\nEdward I (17/18 June 1239 \\endash 7 July 1307), also known as Edward Longshanks and the Hammer of the Scots (Latin: Malleus Scotorum), was King of England from 1272 to 1307. Before his accession to the throne, he was commonly referred to as The Lord Edward.[1] The first son of Henry III, Edward was involved from an early age in the political intrigues of his father's reign, which included an outright rebellion by the English barons. In 1259 he briefly sided with a baronial reform movement, supporting the Provisions of Oxford. After reconciliation with his father, however, he remained loyal throughout the subsequent armed conflict, known as the Second Barons' War. After the Battle of Lewes, Edward was hostage to the rebellious barons, but escaped after a few months and defeated the baronial leader Simon de Montfort at the Battle of Evesham in 1265. Within two years the rebellion was extinguished and, with England pacified, Edward joined the Ninth Crusade to the Holy Land. He was on his way home in 1272 when he was informed that his father had died. Making a slow return, he reached England in 1274 and was crowned at Westminster Abbey.\n\nEdward spent much of his reign reforming royal administration and common law. Through an extensive legal inquiry, he investigated the tenure of various feudal liberties, while the law was reformed through a series of statutes regulating criminal and property law. Increasingly, however, Edward's attention was drawn towards military affairs. After suppressing a minor rebellion in Wales in 1276\\endash 77, Edward responded to a second rebellion in 1282\\endash 83 with a full-scale war of conquest. After a successful campaign, he subjected Wales to English rule, built a series of castles and towns in the countryside and settled them with English people. Next, his efforts were directed towards the Kingdom of Scotland. Initially invited to arbitrate a succession dispute, Edward claimed feudal suzerainty over Scotland. The war that followed continued after Edward's death, even though the English seemed victorious at several points. Simultaneously, Edward found himself at war with France (a Scottish ally) after King Philip IV of France had confiscated the Duchy of Gascony, which until then had been held in personal union with the Kingdom of England. Although Edward recovered his duchy, this conflict relieved English military pressure against Scotland. At the same time there were problems at home. In the mid-1290s, extensive military campaigns required high levels of taxation, and Edward met with both lay and ecclesiastical opposition. These crises were initially averted, but issues remained unsettled. When the King died in 1307, he left to his son Edward II an ongoing war with Scotland and many financial and political problems.\n\nEdward I was a tall man for his era, at 6 ft 2 in (1.88 m), hence the nickname \"Longshanks\". He was temperamental, and this, along with his height, made him an intimidating man, and he often instilled fear in his contemporaries. Nevertheless, he held the respect of his subjects for the way he embodied the medieval ideal of kingship, as a soldier, an administrator and a man of faith. Modern historians are divided on their assessment of Edward: while some have praised him for his contribution to the law and administration, others have criticised him for his uncompromising attitude towards his nobility. Currently, Edward I is credited with many accomplishments during his reign, including restoring royal authority after the reign of Henry III, establishing Parliament as a permanent institution and thereby also a functional system for raising taxes, and reforming the law through statutes. At the same time, he is also often criticised for other actions, such as his brutal conduct towards the Welsh and Scots, and issuing the Edict of Expulsion in 1290, by which the Jews were expelled from England. The Edict remained in effect for the rest of the Middle Ages, and it was over 350 years until it was formally overturned under Oliver Cromwell in 1657.\n\n(Duplicate Line. See Person 155)\n\n190.

Another name for Elizabeth was Elizabeth PLANTAGENET.\n\nElizabeth married Count John I of Holland [120234] in 1297.\n\nElizabeth next married Earl [4th] Humphrey VII de BOHUN of Hereford [81793] in 1302. Humphrey was born in 1276 in Pleshy Castle Essex England and died on 16 Mar 1322 in Boroughbridge Yorkshire England at age 46.\n\nGeneral Notes: Wikipedia has much to say about this Humphrey, as small Selection is,\n\nHumphrey (VII) de Bohun succeeded his father in 1298 as Earl of Hereford and Earl of Essex, and Constable of England (later called Lord High Constable). Humphrey held the title of Bearer of the Swan Badge, a heraldic device passed down in the Bohun family. This device did not appear on their coat of arms, (az, a bend ar cotised or, between 6 lioncels or) nor their crest (gu, doubled erm, a lion gardant crowned), but it does appear on Humphrey's personal seal.\n\nHumphrey was one of several earls and barons under Edward I who laid siege to Caerlaverock Castle in Scotland in 1300 and later took part in many campaigns in Scotland. He also loved tourneying and gained a reputation as an \"elegant\" fop. In one of the campaigns in Scotland Humphrey evidently grew bored and departed for England to take part in a tournament along with Piers Gaveston and other young barons and knights. On return all of them fell under Edward I's wrath for desertion, but were forgiven. It is probable that Gaveston's friend, the future Edward II, had given them permission to depart. Later Humphrey became one of Gaveston's and Edward II's bitterest opponents.\n\nHe would also have been associating with young Robert Bruce during the early campaigns in Scotland, since Bruce, like many other Scots and Border men, he eventually submitted to English allegiance. Robert Bruce is closely connected to the Bohuns. Between the time that he swore his last fealty to Edward I in 1302 and his defection four years later, Bruce stayed for the most part in Annandale, rebuilding his castle of Lochmaben in stone, making use of its natural moat. Rebelling and taking the crown of Scotland in February 1306, Bruce was fighting a war against England which went poorly for him at first, and he was forced into hiding. By 1307, the war had begun to turn in his favor. His properties in England and Scotland were confiscated and three of his brothers were executed.\n\nHumphrey de Bohun received many of Robert Bruce's forfeited properties. It is unknown whether Humphrey was a long-time friend or enemy of Robert Bruce, but they were nearly the same age and the lands of the two families in Essex and Middlesex lay very close to each other. After Bruce's defeats, Humphrey took Lochmaben, and Edward I awarded him Annandale and the castle. Lochmaben was retaken by the Scots in 1312 and remained in Scottish hands until 1333 when it was once more seized by the English. It remained in the hands of Humphrey's son William, Earl of Northampton, who held and defended it until his death in 1360. Scots retook Lochmaben in 1385. Some de Bohuns remained in Scotland, where they became known as the Bounds.\n\nChildren from this marriage were:\n\n243 i. Margaret de BOHUN [120235] was born in 1302 and died on 7 Feb 1304 at age 2.\n\n244 ii. Humphrey de BOHUN [120236] was born in Oct 1303 and died in Oct 1304 at age 1.\n\n+ 245 iii.

King Edward II PLANTAGENET Of England [35176] (Princess Eleanor of CASTILE & LEON149, Jeanne de DAMMARTIN114, Countess Marie PONTHIEU87, Alice Adelaide Princess of FRANCE65, King Louis VII CAPET of France45, Adelaide de SAVOIE de Maurienne34, Comte Humbert II de SAVOIE de Savoy25, Comte Amadeus II de SAVOIE de Savoy19, Marchionesse Adelaide de ARDUINICI de Turin16, Ulric Manfred II de Turin & Susa (Marquis)10, Manfredo I di Turino (Margravio)4, Arduin II di Torino (Margravio)2, Roger d´Auriate (Conte)1) was born on 25 Apr 1284 in Caernarton Castle Gwynedd Wales and died on 21 Sep 1327 in Berkeley Castle Gloucestershire England at age 43.\n\nEdward married Isabella of France [122467] in 1308. Isabella was born about 1295 in Paris Isle-de-France France, died on 22 Aug 1258 in Hertford Hertfordshire England aged about -37, and was buried on 27 Nov 1358 in Grey Friar's Church Newgate London Middlesex.\n\nGeneral Notes: Isabella was knows as \"The She-Wolf of France\".\n\nWikipedia says, amongst much more, that,\n\nIsabella of France (c. 1295 \\endash 22 August 1358), sometimes described as the She-Wolf of France (French: Louve de France), was Queen of England as the wife of King Edward II, and regent of England from 1327 until 1330. She was the youngest surviving child and only surviving daughter of Philip IV of France and Joan I of Navarre. Isabella was notable in her lifetime for her diplomatic skills, intelligence, and beauty. She became a \"femme fatale\" figure in plays and literature over the years, usually portrayed as a beautiful but cruel and manipulative figure.\n\nIsabella arrived in England at the age of 12[2] during a period of growing conflict between the king and the powerful baronial factions. Her new husband was notorious for the patronage he lavished on his favourite, Piers Gaveston, but the queen supported Edward during these early years, forming a working relationship with Piers and using her relationship with the French monarchy to bolster her own authority and power. After the death of Gaveston at the hands of the barons in 1312, however, Edward later turned to a new favourite, Hugh Despenser the Younger, and attempted to take revenge on the barons, resulting in the Despenser War and a period of internal repression across England. Isabella could not tolerate Hugh Despenser and by 1325 her marriage to Edward was at a breaking point.\n\nTravelling to France on a diplomatic mission, Isabella may have begun an affair with Roger Mortimer, and the two may possibly have agreed at this point to depose Edward and oust the Despenser family. The Queen returned to England with a small mercenary army in 1326, moving rapidly across England. The King's forces deserted him. Isabella deposed Edward, becoming regent on behalf of her son, Edward III. Some believe that Isabella then arranged the murder of Edward II. Isabella and Mortimer's regime began to crumble, partly because of her lavish spending, but also because the Queen successfully, but unpopularly, resolved long-running problems such as the wars with Scotland.\n\nIn 1330, aged 18, Edward III forcibly asserted his authority, and Mortimer was executed. Isabella lost her regency and was put under arrest for two years,[3] but afterwards she lived for many years in considerable style; though she did not reside at court, she often visited to see her grandchildren.\n\nNoted events in her life were:\n\n Death: at Hertford Castle, 22 Aug 1258, Hertford Hertfordshire England.\n\nChildren from this marriage were:\n\n+ 254 i. King Edward III PLANTAGENET Of England [35181] was born on 13 Nov 1312 in Windsor Castle Berkshire England and died on 21 Jun 1377 in Sheen Palace Richmond Surrey England at age 64.\n\n255 ii. 1st Earl John PLANTAGENET of Cornwall [122468] was born on 15 Aug 1316 in Eltham Kent England, died on 13 Sep 1336 in Perth Perthshire Scotland at age 20, and was buried on 15 Jan 1337 in Westminster Abbey London Middlesex.\n\n256 iii.

Phillip was born on 1 May 1245 in Poissy Isle-de-France France and died on 5 Oct 1285 in Perpignan France at age 40.\n\nGeneral Notes: Wikipedia says, amongst other Things,\n\nPhilip III (1 May 1245 \\endash 5 October 1285), called the Bold[a][b] (French: le Hardi), was king of France from 1270 until his death in 1285. His father, Louis IX, died in Tunis during the Eighth Crusade. Philip, who was accompanying him, returned to France and was anointed king at Reims in 1271.\n\nPhilip inherited numerous territorial lands during his reign, the most notable being the County of Toulouse, which was returned to the royal domain in 1271. With the Treaty of Orléans, he expanded French influence into the Kingdom of Navarre and following the death of his brother Peter during the Sicilian Vespers, the County of Alençon was returned to the crown lands.\n\nFollowing the Sicilian Vespers, Philip led the Aragonese Crusade in support of his uncle. Initially successful, Philip, his army racked with sickness, was forced to retreat and died from dysentery in Perpignan in 1285. He was succeeded by his son Philip IV.\n\n(Duplicate Line.

He added Alnwick to the family estates in England, founding a dynasty of northern warlords. He rebelled against King Edward II over the issue of Piers Gaveston and was imprisoned for a few months.
