Almost his entire reign was spent in subduing the robber barons, who preyed on the environs of Paris but were finally forced to yield to royal authority. For some 20 years during the period from 1109-1135, Louis waged war against Henry I, the Norman king of England, and against Henry's son-in-law, Holy Roman Emperor Henry V; he successfully repelled an invasion by Henry V in 1124. Louis greatly strengthed the royal power in France, granted benefactions to the church and privileges to towns, and became known as the protector of the peasants and as a fearless military leader. He was succeeded on the throne by his son Louis VII."
