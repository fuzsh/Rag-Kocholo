So far as I know no work of this kind exists at home or abroad. The object of this treatise is A Digitized by v^ooQie Digitized by t^oosle INTRODUCTION. ALTHOUGH the present volume is published indepen- dently, and a large portion of its contents has been in MS. for a considerable time, it may yet be considered as in some sort a continuation of, or supplement to, “ A Treatise on Heraldry, British and Foreign,” published in 1892. The reader will not therefore expect to find in it information which is already fully supplied in the larger work, and the present book is in no sense an introduction to Heraldry in general. On the contrary as it deals only with a limited but very interesting branch of Armorial Science it presupposes the posses- sion of a certain knowledge of Heraldry on the part of its readers ; and though it is hoped that others who are as yet without that special knowledge may find in the pages of the work many matters of interest, it is obvious that a full appreciation of its information can only be made by those who have a fair acquaintance with the general subject. Manuals of, and Introductions to, Heraldry have been sufficiently abundant. For the most part compilations from their predecessors, and showing very little original investigation or research, the cratnbe repetita has been dished up ad nauseam ; but more advanced treatises, or books like the present, dealing more fully with particular branches of the subject than is possible in a general work, have been very few and far between. So far as I know no work of this kind exists at home or abroad. The object of this treatise is A Digitized by t^oosle to deal with the science of Heraldry from an Ecclesi- astical point of view: to give information as to the Armorial Insignia of Episcopal Sees, Abbeys, Religious Foundations, and Communities at home and abroad ; to indicate the various manners in which Ecclesiastics of different grades have borne their arms, and combined their personal with their official insignia ; and fully to describe those ornaments and external additions to the shield by which Ecclesiastical ranks and offices have been, and are, distinguished. Accordingly the work consists of Two Parts. The First deals with the general use of Armorial Insignia by the Ecclesiastics of the Western Church from the earliest times to the present. This portion contains much curious and out of the way information on subjects which have never yet been fully treated by an English writer. Its information and illustrations have been gathered not only from collections of coins, medals, and seals, and from many scarce works, unknown to the general reader, which are only accessible in Public Libraries of the first class, but are also largely derived from the extensive notes made by me in a lengthened experience of over thirty years’ travel in Italy, Germany, France, Spain, etc. In the course of that time I have always had in mind a work on the present lines, and consequently have amassed, in an area which extends from the Peninsula to Poland and from Sicily to Sweden, the information which I have now the pleasure to make accessible. It is confidently hoped that the artist, and the collector of books, plate, seals, china, bookplates, etc., as well as the antiquary and student of Heraldry, will find here much that is useful and interesting. The Second Part contains an enlargement and correc- tion of the “ Notice of the Arms of the Episcopates of Great Britain and Ireland, with Heraldic Notes,” written Digitized by t^oosle ( i” ) by me in illustration of a series of illuminated coats of arms, published by A. Warren in 1868. This book (of which Her Majesty the Queen was pleased to accept the dedication) has been long out of print, and repeated requests have been made to me that its letterpress should be reprinted. This is now done, with much additional historical information, with some corrections, and a new series of plates. This portion of the work also includes the arms of the numerous colonial Sees, and those of the chief Abbeys and Religious Houses, the Deaneries, and other ancient Ecclesiastical Foundations in England. The Continental portion of this section contains the blazon of the arms of the Popes from 1 144 to the present time ; an account of the great Religious Principalities of the Holy Roman Empire ; and much historical and heraldic information with regard to the principal Sees, Religious Houses and Chapters in Germany, Italy, France, Poland, and the Low Countries ; as well as the arms and devices of the most important religious Orders and communities ; and of the British and some foreign Universities. The number of coats of arms blazoned in the work exceeds a thousand. In the Appendices will be found much curious matter in the essays “ On the use of Supporters by Ecclesiastics,” and “ On the Continental Chapters, with their Preuves de Noblesse and I venture here to direct the special attention of my readers to them, because considerations of space have required that they should be printed in smaller type than the rest of the work, and they are thus in some danger of escaping notice. As much of the subject matter of the book should be of interest to others besides those who belong to my own branch of the Catholic Church, I have been careful in the statement of facts to avoid any expression which might jar upon Digitized by CjOOQle the sensibilities of those who differ from me on some theological matters ; I trust that the confidence in my fairness, which induced Ecclesiastics (and others) of high position in another communion to take an interest in the progress of the work, has been fully justified. While I have been careful by the use of abundant references in the pages of the book to give the sources of my information with regard to matters which had not come under my personal observation, I think it right also to express here, in general terms, an acknowledge- ment of my obligations to the published works on general heraldry of the great German armorial writers, Spener and Siebmacher. The outlines of some of the illustrations have been taken from TRIERS, Ein - leitung zu der Wapen-Kunst ; and from MAGNENEY, Recueil des A nnes . In some portions of the work I have been frequently indebted to POTTHAST’s invaluable Wegweiser durch die Geschichtswerke des Europdischen Mittelalters , and to JANAUSCHEK’S book Originum Cisterciensium . My thanks are due to PERCEVAL Landon, Esquire, of Hertford College, Oxford, for placing at my service the interesting and valuable notes on the Heraldry of the Oxford Colleges which he is now printing in the A rchceologia Oxoniensis . The excellent Index, which adds so greatly to the value of a book of this description, and which has been a work of more than usual difficulty, has been compiled by George Harvey Johnston, Esquire, who rendered the like service in the previous volumes. In a work which deals so largely with names of persons and places, as well as with technicalities, errors (and not merely orthographical ones) will sometimes escape that which has appeared to be the closest and most careful vigilance. While I can hardly hope that my experience in this respect will be entirely different Digitized by C^ooQle ( V ) from that of my predecessors, or render this preliminary apology altogether unnecessary, I may yet say that I have done what I could to make it so. And in this con- nection I desire to express my thanks to my friend the Rev. J. Myers Danson, D.D., of Aberdeen, who has obligingly revised most of the proof sheets, and has thus been of very considerable assistance to me and to my readers. “ Feci quod potui, melius alter faciat opus.’’ JOHN WOODWARD.

It is sufficient to say here that &rms as at present used are distinctly of military origin, and arose from the necessity of there being some means by which individuals, though sheathed in armour which concealed the visage, might be readily distinguished by their followers, in warfare, or in those military exercises which were its preparation and rehearsal. Anna sunt distinguendi causd. The devices adopted for this purpose, at first of a simple character, emblazoned upon the shield, and then spreading to the banner, the surcoat, and the caparisons of the horses, were of such evident utility for Digitized by t^ooQle the purpose above indicated, that their use soon became general in civilised Europe ; and we may probably find in the gatherings of the princes and nobles of all nation- alities for the Crusades the motive for the adoption of a more definite system to regulate the use of armorial bearings than had prevailed in earlier times, before they had become fixed and hereditary. But armorial bearings were not only of value from a military point of view, they became of hardly less importance in civil life. The custom of authenticating legal documents by seals bearing the personal devices of the contracting parties, led the way to the adoption of heraldic insignia even by those to whom they were not necessary for military purposes. Shields of arms thus came to be adopted for Ecclesiastical dignitaries, for Bishoprics, Abbeys, and Religious Communities ; not merely because it often happened that, under the feudal system, they had to furnish for the military necessities of the state their quota of armed men whom it was needful to distinguish from others by the military insignia of banner or shield ; but because the adoption of a definite device was found both by Religious and Civil dignitaries and communities a very convenient way for indicating their status upon the seals attesting the authenticity of the charters and other documents to which they were appended. Not only this, but the use of seals became compulsory by law. The Statutuin de apportis religiosorum (35. Edward I., 1307) enacts that every religious House should have a common-seal, which should be in the custody not of the abbot only, as had been the case before, but of four others, “de dignioribus et discreti- oribus,” of the convent ; and that every grant to which this seal was not affixed should be null and void. This was not, as some have thought, because so few people in those times could write ; on the contrary. Digitized by CjOOQle the majority of ecclesiastics and members of religious houses were at least equal to a formal signature ; but rather because, while signatures could be forged with- out great difficulty, the engraving of a seal demanded both time and special ability of a kind not generally found. Not that frauds were altogether precluded. Sometimes the matrices of metal were stolen to provide the means of authenticating forged documents. In 1318, for example, some clerics excommunicated by the Arch- deacon of Poissy, treacherously attacked and mortally wounded the sigillifer of that ecclesiastic, robbed him of the “ seel aux causes ” ( v . p. 9) of his master, and used it in the fabrication of letters of absolution. (Quoted by Lecoy de la Marche from the Registre du Parlement , cited in the Collection des Sceaux of DOUET d’Arcq.) At other times, the same writer tells us, authentic seals were removed from the documents to which they be- longed, and attached to others of more importance. A cleric of the Diocese of Narbonne was in 1282 cited into the Bishop’s court at Carcassonne for a fraud of this kind. Here the authentic seal had been, by means of a heated blade of thin steel, removed from its document, and ingeniously attached to another. Actual forgeries sometimes took place, as when in the eleventh century a goldsmith of Limoges counterfeited the seal of Pope URBAN II. for Hu MBAUD, Bishop of that See (at the instigation of his archdeacon H£lie DE Gimel), in order apparently to authenticate certain forged letters of the Pope. URBAN himself detected the fraud on his visit to Limoges. He instantly deposed the Bishop, and declared the very name of the Arch- deacon to be infamous. The fate of the forger is left to our imagination — perhaps he had wisely decamped ! But to return ; — seals early became armorial. Moreover, the applicability of heraldic insignia to decorative pur- poses was soon perceived. Digitized by t^ooQle Whether carved in stone or wood for the adornment of the church, or glowing in their proper colours in the stained glass, or woven into the hangings, or embroidered on the vestments, or even enamelled on the sacred vessels to preserve the memory of a pious donor, the use of armorial insignia soon assumed very considerable importance from an Ecclesiastical point of view. It is in this aspect then that we purpose now to regard them, and it is the object of this book to give somewhat fuller information than exists in the treatises which deal with the general subject of Heraldry, with regard to the armorial insignia adopted by Religious Foundations, in Britain and on the continent of Europe ; — to describe the various external ornaments by which the various grades and offices in the ecclesiastical hierarchy have been distinguished both at home and abroad, and to indicate the various manners in which these official insignia were combined with the personal arms of the user. The examination of a good collection of mediaeval seals will show us that at first the seals of Ecclesias- tics were usually engraved with their personal effigy, within a band containing an inscription indicative of the name and rank of the person represented. These seals were usually, but not invariably, vesica shaped, or en ogive. Li£hert, Bishop of Cambray in 1057 ; and the Chapter of Notre Dame of Noyon, in 1 174, used seals in the shape of a pear. (Demay, Le Costume au Moyeti Age cfapres les Sceaux , p. 23, fig. 14. Paris, 1880.) As early as the commencement of the eleventh century the Bishops of France had adopted great seals bearing their effigies. ARNOULI) DE LlSIEUX in 1130 (being then only Archdeacon of Seez) reproaches the prelates for this mark of ostentation, as he esteemed it. On the early seals only the bust of the bishop, or his figure at half- length, at first appeared (as was also the case on the early Digitized by C^ooQle seals of the kings of France), and this custom continued in some dioceses up to the close of the century. In 1253 a seal of the officiality or episcopal court, of Paris still bears a mitred bust, apparently the image of the diocesan. (Plate VIII., fig. 1 1.) Nevertheless the custom of repre- senting the bishop at full length, standing or seated, had been adopted concurrently with the former usage, at least as early as the twelfth century. (Lecoy de LA Marche, Les Sceaux , pp. 254, 255.) Many early ecclesiastical seals, especially the counter-seals of Abbeys, and the personal seals of the Abbots, bear only a representation of the arm of the abbot issuing from the flank (usually the dexter flank) of the seal and holding a pastoral staff paleways. A good example, that of an Abbot of Melrose, is engraved in LAING, Catalogue of Scottish Seals , ii., No. 1 164. The seal of oval shape bears the arm of the abbot, vested in the sleeve of his habit, and holding his crosier, or pastoral staff, in pale. The back ground is diapered with a reticulated pattern, and the legend is “ MANUS Abbatis DE MELROS.” With this we may compare the small round secretum of the Capitular Seal of Melrose in 1292, which has a similar device with the addition of an estoile at the sinister side of the staff. The legend is “Contra Sigill. de Melros.” (Laing, Scottish Seals , i., 1077.) It ,s somewhat curious that this bearing is found, generally but not exclusively, on the seals of abbots and monasteries belonging, like Melrose, to the Cistercian Order. Thus the seal of the Abbots of Byland in 1186 (. British Museum Catalogue of Seals , No. 2822) ; of Build was, twelfth century ( B . Mus.y No. 2753) ; of Sibton in 1193 ( B . Mus., No. 4020); of Tintern, twelfth and thirteenth century (B. Mus.f No. 4194); of Vale Royal, twelfth century (B. Mus.t No. 4233); and of many other Cistercian foundations, are charged with the hand and pastoral staff. The seal of the Abbot of Holywood has the same bearings, but the crosier is backed by a Digitized by CjOOQle tree. (Laing, Scottish Seals , i., 1043.) The seals of the Benedictine Abbot of Eynsham, in the twelfth century; of Richard, Abbot of the Austin Canons at Grimsby in 1203; and of William de LewknoRj Precentor of Chi- chester, circa 1216 (B. Mus. Cat., Nos. 3144, 3232, and 1484), all have the hand and crosier ; and it also appears, rather curiously, on the seal ad causas of the Chapter of Perugia, sede vacant e. (Glafey, Specimen decadent Sigillorum , p. 25, Lipsiae, 4to 1849.) The Benedictine Abbey of Saint Seyne had, in the eighteenth century, as its arms : d Azur a un dextrochere de carnation , habille cf une matiche large cf argent et tenant une crosse cf or postfe en pal ( Armorial General de France. Bourgogne, i., p. 152, No. 46). It may be noticed the same device appears on the tombstone of Abbot SUTTON, at Dorchester; and in several other instances (BOUTELL, Christian Monuments , pp. 53-55). In course of time, as the convenience of Heraldic devices became generally recognised, a shield bearing the personal arms of the ecclesiastic was introduced, and it filled up conveniently the angle beneath the foot of the effigy in the base of the vesica. Mr W. H. St. John Hope, Assistant Secretary of the Society of Antiquaries, says that “ the earliest seal on which a shield occurs is that of William de Luda, Bishop of Ely in 1290, who has the three crowns of the See of Ely beneath his feet. David Martyn (St Davids, 1296) also has a shield under his feet, but it is charged with his own arms. (. Proceedings of Society of Antiquaries , Feb. 3, 1887.) The Basset arms, however, appear on the seal of Fulk Basset, Bishop of London, 1244-1259 ( B . Mus . Cat., No. 1909). I may here borrow from Mr W. H. St. John Hope’s paper on the “ Seals of English Bishops ” the following useful information : “ Episcopal Seals are divisible into : — (1) Seals of dignity, with (2) their counter-seals ; with which must be included (3) private seals, or secreta ; (4) Digitized by Google Seals ad causas ; (5) Seals made for special purposes, such as the palatinate seals of the Bishop of Durham. And he appends the following note by C. S. PERCEVAL, Esq. LL.D., Treasurer of the Society of Antiquaries, as to the uses of these various seals : — “ While the Seal of Dignity, as we have called it, or Great Seal, was used for charters, and other instruments affecting the property or rights of the See ; or to authenticate copies ( vidimus or inspeximus ) of important documents such as Papal Bulls ; the secretum, ox sigillum privatum , was for deeds concerning the private estate of the Bishop himself, the signet for sealing his private correspondence, both being occasionally used as counter- seals to the Great Seal. The seal ad causas was appended to copies of Acts of Court, letters of Orders, probates (where no special official seal was in use), marriage licences, testimonials, and similar instruments of a minor and transitory interest.” ( Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries , 2nd S., xi., 271, et seq.). The counter-seal of Richard, Bishop of Winchester in 1174 (not in B. Mus. Collection) bears the words “Sum custos et testis sigillir It is worthy of notice that as the earliest seals used in Christian times had been antique gems, usually set as finger rings, the use of these long continued as secreta , or counter-seals. It is no uncommon thing to find a pagan or a Gnostic gem used as a secretum by a Christian prelate. The secretum of GUILLAUME DE Champagne, Archbishop of Sens in the twelfth century, is a gem bearing a remarkably beautiful bust of Venus. (Lecoy de la Marche, Sceaux , fig. 8, p. 25.) This author remarks that these gems were sometimes Christianised by the addition of a legend. Thus the counter-seal of Nicolas, Abbot of St. Etienne at Caen, bore a winged Victory which was converted into an angel by the legend — “ Ecce mitto angelum meum.” Digitized by CjOOQle ( i° ) Warriors become St. GEORGES by the addition of a lance and a dragon. The unmistakably pagan head of CARACALLA becomes that of the Prince of the Apostles by the simple addition of the words o iHrpot ! The Monks of Durham turned the head of Jupiter into that of St. Oswald by a like process ; “ Caput Sancti Cswaldi.” ( Vetusta Monumenta% i., pi. xlix.) Mr Porter gives an even more remarkable instance. The Monks of Selby converted the head of the Emperor Honorius into that of the Blessed Saviour, by the addition of the legend “ Caput Nostrum Christus est !” These gems are sometimes set upon the face of early seals. (This is so on the seal of Boniface of Savoy, Archbishop of Canterbury in 1266, where four antique gems are set, two on either side of the Archbishops standing effigy. This is engraved in Mr Hope’s paper ; see also Archceologia C anti ana, vi., 215 ; and Mr PORTER’S excellent paper on the “ Seals of the Arch- bishops of York,” in Proceedings of the Society of Anti- quaries, 2nd S., xiii., pp. 45, et seq.) As seal engravers progressed in artistic skill more elaborate compositions were employed. The ecclesiastic was represented standing, or seated, under an archi- tectural canopy which was often adorned with figures of patronal saints, and in addition to the shield of his personal arms others were introduced bearing the Royal Arms, or those of the Abbey, or See, over which he presided. Walter Reynolds, Bishop of Worcester, 1308, is said to have been the first to place on either side of his effigy shields bearing the arms of England. Sir HENRY Ellis considered that the use of the Royal Arms on ecclesiastical seals might refer to some high secular office held by the ecclesiastic, but as the custom is not confined to such cases, it is evident that this sup- position is unfounded. Later, when the effigy of the Digitized by t^oosle ( II ) bishop was moved into a subordinate position in the base of the shield, the shields of arms accompanied him thither. The arms of Bishoprics, Abbeys, etc,, were often a composition containing the effigies, or the conventional symbols, of the saints to whose honour they were dedi- cated. Thus the Cathedral Church of SALISBURY is dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, and so the shield of arms assumed for the See, bears : Azure , the effigy of the Blessed Virgin holding in her arms the Holy Child or . (Plate XXV., fig. i.) The Arms of the See of London are : Gules , two swords in saltire proper the hilts in base or. (Plate XX., fig. 4.) The sword is the emblem of the Apostle St. Paul to whom the Cathedral is dedicated. The ancient dedication of the Cathedral of Exeter was to SS. PETER and PAUL, and the symbols of both these Apostles are therefore combined in the arms of the See : Gules , a sword in pale argent , the hilt in base or , surmounted by tivo keys endorsed in saltire of the last. (Plate XXII., fig. 2.) The arms of the City and See of LISBON contain a boat on the prow and stern of which are perched two ravens. “ Tem por armas . . . huma Naocom douscorvos discorrendo de poupa a proa.” (Nobiliarchia Portugueza , p. 352, 1754.) These bearings commemorate the legend that the body of St. Vincent, exposed in an open boat, was guarded by ravens as it drifted on the sea to Lisbon from the Cape which now bears his name. The Church of COMTOSTELLA in Spain has for its arms the tomb of Santiago, the Apostle St. James, whose body is said to have been buried there, having floated from Joppa to Padron, twelve miles below Santiago, to be discovered eight centuries later. The Abbey of S. Etienne at Dijon bore : Gules , a palm branch in pale or , between three flint-stones argent. Here the martyr’s palm is combined with the instru- ments of the martyrdom of the saint whose relics were preserved in the abbey. The arms of the Digitized by CjOOQle ( 12 ) Cathedral of S. Etienne at Auxerre are: Azure, three stones ok The arms of Abbeys, and other religious foundations, were often a composition from the Armorial bearings of their founders. Thus the arms of the monastery of S. Aggas, or Agatha, founded by Lord SCROPE of BOLTON, were those of that nobleman {Azure, a bend or), with the addition of a pastoral staff of the last in bend sinister . (Plate I., fig. 8.) The arms of the Charter-House were ; Or, three chevrons sable, the arms of its founder DE Manny. The Abbey of RlEVAULX bore the arms of DE ROOS : Gules , three water bougets, arge?it, over all a pastoral staff in pale or. It may be well to mention here that the pastoral staff, a staff with a head curved in imitation of a shepherd’s crook, and originally of very simple formation {see Plate VIII.) is with equal propriety, and in full accordance with ancient English use, termed a crosier, or crozier. In this book both terms will be used. The modern use by which the term crosier is applied to designate the cross borne, not by, but, before a Papal Legate or an Archbishop in his province, is an entirely mistaken and misleading one. (This cross will be spoken of in a future chapter.) The French term crosse denotes, not the archi-episcopal cross, but the ordinary crook-headed pastoral staff ; and the word crosier has not, as is some- times erroneously asserted, any connection with the French word croix or the English cross. Its real con- nection is with the word crook. In the contemporary narrative of the coronation of Richard III. (printed in Excerpta Historica, pp. 379 et seq.) we find the following passage : — “ And then comyng the Crosse wt. a ryall procession, fyrst Prcsts wt. grey Amyses and then Abotts and Bushopes wt. meters on ther hedds & crosers in there hands, and the Bushope of Rochester bare the Cross Digitized by C^ooQle ( i3 ) before the Cardinall.” Here in one sentence we have the processional cross borne before the Clergy ; the Bishops who bore their own crosiers (as they ought to do still unless infirm in mind or body) and the archi- episcopal cross borne before the Cardinal-Archbishop. The Rev. J. T. Fowler, M. A., F.S.A., of Durham, who is a careful philologer and ecclesiologist, has shown that the terms “ pastoral staff** and “ crosier ’* are both rightly applicable to a bishop’s crook, and that the term “ crosier *’ does not, as is often imagined, properly belong to an archbishop’s cross. “ Crosier,” he says, “ in the form croce, crosse, croche, cruche, crocere, etc., may be shown by quotations to have been the proper English name of a bishop’s staff from very early times. Pastoral staff is the English translation of the usual Latin term Baculus Pastoralis , used in the Pontificals, etc. And it may be rightly usecj, no doubt, by any who prefer four syllables to two, and a new term to an old one. The use of it in England appears to date from about the time when an archbishop’s cross began to be called a crosier. The earliest example of this wrong application which I have hitherto found is in Hook’s Church Dictionary (1842), where a crozier is said to be an archbishop’s cross.” Mr Fowler has printed in Archceologia , vol. Hi., a most curious and interesting series of quotations and references in early writers, from 1330 downwards, which abundantly prove his case. He shows that the usual old English word for a bishop’s (or abbot’s) crook was croce, croche, or crosse. That when it was borne by another person for the bishop such person was called his crocer, croyser, or crosier ; as was also the archbishop’s or pope’s cross-bearer. Next, that the bishop’s staff was called in the fifteenth and later centuries a “croyser staff, crosiers staff, crosier’s staff, or crosier staff, as if people connected it more closely with the clerk who commonly carried it than with the bishop himself.” Digitized by t^oosle ( *4 ) Then the second member of the term, viz., “ staff,” was gradually dropped, and what had at first been called a croce, and then a crosier staff, was called simply a crosier, which use has continued to the present time. The application of the term crosier to the cross borne before an archbishop or legate is a modern error. An archbishop does not bear his cross himself, and when he pontificates he holds his crosier, or crooked pastoral staff, though it is quite true that on mediaeval seals and stained glass he is often represented holding his cross. “ The blunder, once started, all at once sprang into astonishing vitality, as I find it adopted by even such writers as Webb, Haines, Boutell, Lee, Blunt (in 1 8 66, but corrected in 1884), Shipley, Marriott, Mackenzie Walcott, Mrs Jameson, Fairholt, and others, also in several standard dictionaries, though not in that of SKEAT, who knows that crosier is not derived from cross, and that the word has always been used of a bishop’s crook. The false derivation, plausible enough to those who have not gone into the matter, has no doubt had much to do with the propagation of the error. Is it too late to amend it? An archbishop’s cross has been called a cross from 1460 to the present time, and the minister who carried it before the archbishop, while the prelate himself held his ‘croce’ or ‘ crosier,’ was called the ‘crossier’ or ‘croyscr.’ It is interesting to note that Roman Catholic writers of the old school, unaffected by the Anglican ecclesiological revival, such, for example, as Bishop John Milner, always used the terms in the old English way. But Dr Rock and the younger Pugin, while rightly calling the archi-cpiscopal cross a ‘cross,’ are shy of calling a bishop’s staff a ‘ crosier,’ and use the term ‘ pastoral staff’ Dr Husenbeth in 1859 says of the latter, ‘ some have lately affected to call it the pastoral staff,’ but expresses his decided preference for crosier, as hallowed by long usage. In 1866 he is ‘aware that in Digitized by C^ooQle PLATE I. 1. Abp. de Turey. 2. Jean de Flandre. Harcourt. 4. Card. Altieri. 5. Card. Rappaciolo. 0. Card. Lugo. 7. Card. Barbarini. 8. S. Aggaa. 11. Calder Abbew Digitized by Google Digitized by t^oosle ( i5 ) strictness the term crosier belongs to a cross, but that by long usage it is applied to a Bishop’s crook/ He is aware, that is, he has been led astray by Anglican ecclesiologists.” Hugo de S. Victor admonishes us that in this staff three things are to be noted ; — the crook, the rod, the point, whose signification is thus given : — Attraho peccantes, justos rogo, pungo vagantes ; Officio triplici servio pontifici. Or, as set out in the following distich : — Attrahe per curvum, medio rege, punge per imum ; Curva trahit quos virga regit, pars ultima pungit. ( Vide SPENER, Opus Heraldicum , pars, gen., cap. vii., P- 333-) To return : — a singular example of monastic arms formed from the bearings of the founder is afforded by the coat of Calder Abbey, which is composed of the bearings of the three families which contributed to its aggrandisement: Argent, three escucheons : i. Or, a fess between two chevrons gules, for FlTZWALTER. 2. Gules, three lucies hauriant argent , for LUCY. 3. Sable , a fret argent , for FLEMYNG. (Plate I., fig. 1 1.) The Monastery of Kirkham bore the arms of Roos, As given above for RlEVAULX, but substituted a bourdon, prior’s staff, or crutch, for the crozier. A modern instance of the same usage is to be seen in the arms assumed for the modern foundation of the Abbey of Mount St. Bernard in Leicestershire. They are : Or, a crosier in pale , with a sudarium sable ; on a chief Azure, three lions rampant or ; the latter being the arms of the founder, DE Lisle. Many other English examples will be found by the student in the list of the arms of Abbeys and Religious Houses in Great Britain, in Part II., of this book. The arms of the Abbey of St. Etienne of Caen are a composition from the arms of England Digitized by C^ooQLe ( 16 ) and those of the Duchy of NORMANDY ; they form an interesting example of the curious heraldic arrangement known as dimidiation. The dexter half of the shield of the arms of ENGLAND {Gules, three lions passant gardant in pale or ) is conjoined with the sinister half of the arms of the Duchy {Gules, two lions passant gardant in pale or), thus three of the lions’ fore-quarters appear, but only two of the hind-quarters. (Plate II., fig. i.) In France, the Sees and Abbeys of Royal foundation often have as the “ field ” of their arms, the old Royal bearings of the Kings of France : Azure, sem^ of fleurs- de-lis or. Thus, the Cathedral of Notre Dame at Paris bears the above coat, known briefly as France-ancient, and Over all the effigy of the Blessed Virgin, supporting in her arms the Holy Child proper. (SEGOING, Armorial Universel , planche 1 8 1 . Paris 1679). The Canons of “la Sainte Chapelle DU Roi” at Dijon bore: FRANCE-ANCIENT, Over all a palm branch in pale or ; the emblem of the proto-martyr St. Stephen {vide supra, and see also PIOZIER, Armorial Gt'ntral de France, G£n£ralite de Bourgogne, i., No. 88). The Collegiate Church of St. ANDOCHE in the town of Saulieu used : FRANCE- ANCIENT, Over all a crosier and sword in saltire argent. (The arms of the Sees of Reims, LANGRES, Laon, and NOYON, similarly composed, will be found later on, at Plate X.) The Cathedral Church of St. Vincent at Macon bears: France- ancient {Azure, fleury or) thereon the figure of St. Vincent, vested in a white, alb , and a dalmatic gules semt( de fleurs-de-lis or, holding in his dexter hand a palm branch, and in the sinister the open Evangelistarium, proper. The Cathedral Church of St. Vincent at Ch&lons bears : FRANCE-ANCIENT, over all a sceptre gules with a flory head (Hozier, Armorial GMral de France, Gene- rality de Bourgogne, tome ii., 225).

By the Chapter of Limoges the semi of France-ancient is reduced to five fleurs-de-lis or , 3 and 2 ; which coat still appears in the old stained glass of the north aisle of the Cathedral of Limoges. There are examples in which appear the later arms of France (as borne since Charles V. reduced the fleurs-de-lis to three in honour of the Ever Blessed Trinity) : Azure , a passion nail between three fleurs-de-lis or, are the arms of the famous Abbey of St. Denis near Paris ; the burying place of the Kings of France. The Abbaye de St. Germain des Pr£s similarly used : Azure, on an escucheon argent between three fleurs-de-lis or, as many torteaux . The ancient arms of the Dues d*Orl£ans : France- ANCIENT, a label argent in chief, are the field of the arms borne by the CHARTREUSE d’OrlEans, charged with a figure of Lazarus rising from the tomb argent (HoziER, Arm.

Many, perhaps most, of the French Sees have no official arms as distinct from those borne by the Cathe- dral Chapters ; whereas in Germany, and in England (so far at least as concerns the Cathedrals of the “ Old Foundation,” i.e., those which were in existence as such before the Reformation), the arms of the Deaneries or Cathedral Chapter are different from, though often formed upon, those of the See ( see the arms of these Sees and Deaneries in Part II. of this work). The arms of the Chapter of Poitiers appear to be Azure, a long cross botonny argent ; upon this the Bishop places an escucheon, Barry of eight argent and gules . Both coats occur with some frequency in the stained glass of the aisles of the Cathedral of Poitiers. The official arms of the early Bishops of Albi also, were identical with those which are still used by the Cathedral Chapter, viz. : Gules, a cross pommetty or, adorned with pendant chains and precious stones. It is c Digitized by CjOOQle ( i8 ) said that this coat originated in the dedication of the ancient cathedral to the Holy Cross. But Bernard de Castanet (1275-1308), who laid the foundation- stone of the present grand cathedral, dedicated to SAINTE CfiCILE, bore : Gules , a tower argent , surmounted by a double cross ; and, after the secularisation of the Chapter, he and his successors took this personal coat as the arms of the See. In Italy many, perhaps most, of the Sees have arms, but they are not (so far as my pretty wide experience goes) frequently in use. While the arms of the Pope, and the personal arms of the Bishop or Archbishop are placed upon the facade, or are suspended within the church, the arms of the See are seldom or never seen. The curious inquirer may puzzle out at least some of them in the Italia Sacra of UGHELLI, and kindred works, but unless he has a special interest in the matter he is little likely to learn of their existence. I give just one or two here. TUSCULUM bears : Gules, two keys in saltire tied by a cord in base or. ANAGNI bears : Gules , in chief an eagle displayed and in base a lion passant or. The arms of Sabina are : Gules , three sets of interlaced annulets between two bendlets or ; of Aquilani , Argent, an eagle displayed sable, crowned or (UGHELLI, Italia Sacra, t. i.). In Germany, as formerly in England and Scotland, it was the custom for high Ecclesiastics to use indifferently their official arms, or their personal arms if they pos- sessed any. It was then an easy step when seals became more elaborate, to represent both the official and the personal arms on the same seal, though upon different shields. In Italy when any official arms were used they were often made to occupy the chief or upper part of a shield divided per fess ; the personal arms of the Prelate being placed in the lower part, or base, of the shield. Digitized by C^ooQle ( 19 ) In England it has been long the custom for Arch- bishops, Bishops, and Abbots to impale their personal with their official arms, just as a wife impaled the arms of her husband with her own ; the ecclesiastic being considered maritus eccle sice, and the official arms have assigned to them the dexter side, that being accounted the more honourable portion, of the shield. In later times Archdeacons and Chancellors impaled the arms of the See with their personal arms upon their official seals. As will be shown more fully hereafter the arms of the Irish Sees date only from post-Reformation times. In Scotland, also, Bishops for the most part used only their personal arms, with of course the mitre and other external insignia pertaining to their ecclesiastical rank. This is still usually the case in the majority of the Sees of France, Belgium, and Southern Europe. In a few cases the personal arms of an illustrious Prelate were adopted by later Bishops as the bearings of the See : — of this we have examples in Part II. in the arms of Mainz, Hereford, and Worcester. In France the six great ecclesiastical Peers sometimes impaled, and other times quartered, the official arms of their Sees with their personal ones ( vide infra , Plates IX. and X.). In Germany these arms were more frequently duartere^» the official coat of the See or Abbey being generally placed in the first and last quarters, especially when the Bishop held but one Sec, and possessed no temporal lordships. But, when, as was in modern times frequently the case, several Sees with their dependent lordships were united under the rule of one Prelate, it was the custom to quarter all these official arms in the shield, and to place the personal arms of the Prelate in an escucheon en surtout. These customs will be fully exemplified as we proceed. Of course many Prelates had by birth no right to bear Digitized by t^oosle ( 20 ) arms at all. Many of those who have filled the highest places in the hierarchy have risen from the very humblest origin, by their personal merit, just as NICOLAS Break- speare, the Anglo-Saxon thrall, attained to the Ponti- fical throne as Adrian IV. As it was then, so is it still. The late Celestine, Cardinal Ganglbauer, Arch- bishop of Vienna, was a Benedictine monk, of peasant birth ; and on the occasion of his funeral, in 1889, the Emperor Francis Joseph walked by the side of the Cardinal’s peasant brothers and nephews. Mgr. Kopp, Prince-Bishop of Breslau, was the son of a cotton weaver at Duderstaat. Mgr. Dinder, Archbishop of Posen and Gnesen, was the son of a cobbler at ROSSEL. Mgr. Krementz, Archbishop of Cologne, was the son of a COBLENTZ butcher, and his brother kept on the old butcher’s shop. Cardinal SlMOR, late Archbishop of Gran, and Prince-Primate of Hungary, was the son of a petty shoemaker at STUHLWEISSENBERG. Not long ago an infidel Belgian paper thought fit to sneer at Mgr. Lambrecht, Bishop of Ghent, as “only a peasant’s son,” and the instances noted above were, with others, contained in an article in reply published by a Catholic paper which gloried, and rightly gloried, in the facts stated. But although it has always been one of the boasts of the Catholic Church that persons of the lowest condition in life might aspire to the highest ecclesias- tical dignities, there were yet some exceptions. For admission into many Chapters ; and into the semi- military, semi-religious, Orders of Knighthood, such as the Order of St.John of Jerusalem, or theTEUTONic Order, it was essential that the candidate should be of noble birth ; not necessarily titled, or of a Peerage family according to the improperly restricted use of the term noble which in modern times obtains among English- speaking people only, but noble as descended from ancestors who were nobiles ; that is, who were entitled to Digitized by C^ooQle ( 21 ) use armorial bearings which distinguished them from the ignobilesy or unknown. “Nobiles,” said Lord -Chief- Justice COKE, “ sunt qui arma antecessorum suorum proferre possunt” (quoted in Sir James Lawrence’s Nobility of the British Gentry , p. 17, London, 1840). On the Continent many Sees and Abbacies could only be held by persons who were able to prove this nobility of descent for several generations. Thus, no person could formerly be consecrated Archbishop of CoLN, or Trier, or Bishop of Basel, until he had publicly exposed for examination on the front of his future Cathedral the emblazonment of his thirty-two quarterings ; that is a shield combining the arms borne by all his ancestors, both male and female, for five generations. The thirty- two quarters of JOHN Hugh ORSBECK, Archbishop and Prince-Elector of Trier (1676-1711) are given for example in Menetrier’s treatise on Les Preuves de Noblesse , p. 97. Similar requirements, but varying in the number of generations, were made in Germany in most cases in which the Bishop or Abbot became invested in right of his ecclesiastical position with the temporal lordships which formed the endowment of the See or Abbey which he ruled. The nobles who sat in the Diets of Germany were much too haughty to permit that Bishops and Abbots should sit and vote with them in their assemblies on a footing of equality, still less preside over them, and regulate their action, unless these Prelates were them- selves of noble blood. Such requirements as those I have referred to above, originated therefore, not as is sometimes ignorantly asserted, in the pride of the clergy, but in the haughtiness of the lay nobles. It must, how*- ever, be confessed that the clergy wrere often infected by the spirit of the age, and were, unhappily, only too often not unwilling to “ better the example ” of their lay Digitized by Google ( 22 ) brethren. Pope Nicholas IV. excommunicated the whole Chapter of Trier for refusing to admit to a pre- bend a person of ignoble extraction who had been nomi- nated by him to that dignity. So early as 1227, Pope GREGORY IX. was called in to decide a dispute between the Bishop of Porto who was his Legate in Germany, and the Chapter of STRASSBURG, who had refused to admit to a prebend the nominee of the Legate, on the ground that the person proposed was deficient in the requisite degrees of nobility. The papal decision went against the Chapter. (The decree is given in Baron Von Lowhen’s Analysis of Nobility , pp. 170, 171. London 1754.) In our own country men of all ranks have always been eligible for the highest ecclesiastical positions, and on attaining them have often, down to the present day, assumed armorial bearings for use upon their seals, etc., though frequently the connection of the Prelate with the family whose arms were adopted was, to say the least, extremely difficult of proof. Occasionally permission to use their arms was sought by the Prelate from the head and other members of the family to which he desired to attach himself. In France, and probably in other countries, it is usual for a Bishop to invent for himself a coat of arms, if he is not entitled by birth to bear one. “ Anciennement les prelats non nobles ^taient anoblis personellement par leur charge, et pouvaient se choisir des armes. Cet usage s’est conserve, ct actuellement tous les prelats, en prenant possession de leurs sieges adoptent un ecusson, et une devise quand ils n’en ont pas de naissance.” {La Noblesse en France , par BarthElemy, p. 321, Paris 1858.) Thus the present Bishop of Limoges bears: Argent , on a cross sable the monogram of the labamm X P or. Usually the arms thus assumed have a distinctly religious savour. WALTER REYNOLDS, Bishop of WORCESTER, Digitized by CjOOQle ( 23 ) and afterwards Archbishop of CANTERBURY, assumed : Azure , on a cross or, between the symbols of the four Evangelists , five lions rampant gules armed and langued azure ( Catalogue of Seals in British Museum , No. 1217). Other examples will be found later in Chapter IV. But though these assumptions were very general, there were exceptions even among high Ecclesiastics. Cardinal Francois Tolet of the Order of Jesus, “ Pr£dicateur du Palais Apostolique ” under seven suc- cessive Popes, never used any arms but the sacred name of JESUS in cypher, Within an orle of five estoiles , all of gold in an azure field. SARMIENTO DE Mendoza, Bishop of JAEN, laid aside his illustrious paternal coat to take a simple Calvary cross, surrounded by a bordure charged with the words, “ Anna militice nostra*!' On the other hand, GEORGE DA COSTA, Archbishop of Lisbon and Braga, on his elevation to the Cardinalate assumed : Azure , a wheel of St. Catharine or, in memory of the Infanta Catharina (daughter of Edward, and sister of Affonso V., Kings of PORTUGAL), to whose favour he owed the commencement of his great fortune. This coat he impaled with his paternal arms : Gules , six rib bones , in pairs, fessw ays in pale argent . The use of brisures, or marks of cadency, seems never to have been general in the case of Ecclesiastics. Even the illegitimate sons of Royal and Noble Houses often used the full paternal arms without any of the ordinary distinguishing marks of bastardy. It seemed as if admission into Holy Orders entirely obliterated any stain which might have been supposed to attach to their birth. “Si illegitimus sacris fuerit initiatus, non est opus transversam dictam lineam paternis insigniis addere, cum propter sacri ordinis dignitatem legitimus censeatur, imo ante susceptum ordinem numero sit Iegitimandus, quare quoq : nuptiis exinde inidoneus ac inter steriles numeratur.” (Spener, Opus Heraldicum , Digitized by CjOOQle ( 24 ) p. gen., p. 359.) Thus Alexander Stuart, Arch- bishop of St. Andrews (1509-1513), natural son of James IV., bore on his seal the full Royal Arms sans brisure supported by the Royal unicorns, and having the archi-episcopal cross behind the escucheon. Another Archbishop of St. Andrews, John Hamil- ton (1549-1571), natural son of James, Earl of Arran, bore the quartered arms of Hamilton and Arran, without any brisure. His cross is placed, according to custom, in pale behind the shield ( ScoticJironicon , ii., p. 284). Similarly James, a natural son of James, Lord Hamilton (elected to Glasgow in 1547, and translated to Argyll in 1558) bore on his seal in 1556 the quartered arms of HAMILTON and Arran, sans brisure . (Laing, Scottish Seals , ii., 1101.) JAMES, Earl of MORAY, Prior of St. Andrews, and Regent of Scotland, natural son of James V., bears on his seal the full Royal Arms, with a pastoral staff behind the shield {ibid, ii., p. 156). The seal of George Douglas (natural son of Archibald, Earl of Angus) consecrated Bishop of Moray, 15 bears his paternal shield, mitred, but without any brisure {ibid., ii., No. 1044.) So also, Andrew, Bishop of Argyll, (1613-1636) natural son of Thomas, Lord Boyd, bears on his seal in 1629 the full paternal arms {ibid., ii., No. 1 102). On the otherhand Pierre CHARLOT, Bishop of NOYON, natural son of King Philip Augustus, bore the Royal Arms of France-ancient (Azure, sem/ de fleurs-de-lis d'or), debruised by a bend sinister argent. JEAN, Bishop of LifcGE, Chancellor of Flanders, natural son of Gui, Count of Flanders, bore on his seal in 1280 the arms of that County {Or, a lion rampant sable) debruised by a crozier in bend argent (Plate I., fig. 2, and see Vr£e, GtW- alogie des Comtes de Flandre, Plate 74). David, B&tard de Bourgogne, son of Philip, Duke of Burgundy, was made Bishop of TEROUENNE, in 1451, and of Digitized by CjOOQle ( 25 ) Utrecht in 1455. He used the paternal arms sans brisure , with the coronet of a French Prince. His book- stamp is in GUIGARD .Armorial du Bibliophile, tome i.,p.29. Similarly, LOUIS DE NOGARET, Bishop of MlRfePOlX (d. 1679), and his sister, LOUISE, Abbess of St. GLOSME DE Metz (d. 1647), illegitimate children of JEAN Louis DE NOGARET, Due D’EPERNON, bore on their book- stamps the full arms of NOGARET, without any mark of bastardy. (GUIGARD, Armorial du Bibliophile , ii., 149, 150.) Louis de Bassompierre, Bishop of Saintes, (d. 1676), son of Marshal de Bassompierre, used no brisure to denote his illegitimacy. REYNAUD, bdtard de Bourbon, Archbishop of NARBONNE in 1472, bore: Argent , a bend 0/TRANCE-ANCIENT thereon a fillet gules, supported by two angels (the usual Royal Supporters of France) holding palms. (PfcRE Anselme, i., p. 310.) The angels which support the Royal Arms of France have however azure dalmatics charged with the three golden fleurs-de- lis, and not the alb only. Henri de BOURBON, Bishop of Metz (son of Henri IV. by Henriette de Balzac D’ENTRAGUES, bore : France a baton piri en barre d argent, with the fleur-de-lis coronet of a French Prince. (GUIGARD, Armorial du Bibliophile, i., 31.) The arms of Charles, B&tard d’OrlEans, Bishop of Laon, and Pair de France, are given under Cambray. Thomas Stuart, Archdeacon of St. Andrews, 1443, natural son of King ROBERT II., bore the Royal Arms {Or, a lion rampant within a double tressure flory counterfiory gules) debruised by a bend counter-componi argent and azure . The shield is supported by two dragons sejant, as well as by an angel which stands behind it (LAING, ii., No. 931). I recently noticed a fine boss in the Musee des Antiques, in the cloister of the Augustins at TOULOUSE which bears the arms : Quarterly, I. and IV. ; quarterly, 1 and 4. Or, three pallets gules (County of Foix) ; 2 and 3. Or, two cows gules, darings azure (the Digitized by Google ( 26 ) County of B£arn); II. and III. ( . . . ) on a chief (...) three lozenges (...). The whole shield is debruised by a very narrow fillet in bend, which crosses the I. and IV. grand - quarters. The shield has the adjuncts of a crozier in pale behind its centre, on the dexter side of the head of the staff is a mitre ; it appears doubtful if there was ever anything on the other side of the head for the sake of symmetry, but if there was it has now disappeared. The book-stamp of Gabriel de Beauveau de Rivarennes, Bishop of Nantes (1636-1667) shows that he bore the arms of Beauveau (Argent, four lions rampant two and two gules crowned ', and armed, or), debruised by a baton pt'ri en bande. (GUIGARD, Armorial du Bibliophile, tome i., p. 81.) Among a clergy bound to celibacy the ordinary marks of cadency were not imperatively needful ; the external ornaments which indicated their ecclesiastical dignity sufficiently distinguished their arms from those borne by other members of their families. In England since the Reformation marks of cadency have been used and omitted indifferently, but the arms of many Bishops have been differenced by the introduction of small mitres as charges within the shield. This is, indeed, no modern custom. John pe Grandison, Bishop of Exeter (1327-1369) bore : Paly of six argent and azure, on a bend gules a mitre between two eagles displayed or ; instead of the three eagles which appeared on his paternal coat (Plate II., fig. 4.) William Courtenay, Arch- bishop of Canterbury (1381-1396) bore: Or, three torteaux, a label throughout azure , on each of its points a mitre (sometimes three mitres) argent (Plate II., fig- 5)- In one of the windows on the south side of the choir in YORK-MlNSTER are represented the arms of Cardinal BEAUFORT: the Royal Arms (France and England, Digitized by Google ( 27 ) quarterly) within a bordure com pone azure and ermine , each of the azure cotnpons being charged with a mitre argent. (See The Heraldry of York- Minster, by Dean PUREY-CUST, plate x., p. 389, 4to, 1890.) I have not met with any instance of this use of the mitre in other examples of the Cardinal’s arms. Mitres also appear as differencing charges in the arms of Bishops Bekington (Bath and Wells), Alcock (Ely), Burghill and Hales (Lichfield), de l’Isle (Durham), Peploe (Chester), Lumley (Lincoln), Grey and Lyhert (Norwich), and Carpenter (Worcester). They also form the charge of the bordures which were used as differences in the arms of Bishops Marshall and Stafford (Exeter), Hei- worth (Lichfield), Blundeville and Despenser (NORWICH). The azure bordiire of the DESPENSER arms (< Quarterly , argent , and gules fretty or , over all a bend sable') is charged with eight , but sometimes with fifteen , golden mitres by Bishop DESPENSER. (Plate II., fig. 6.) The arms of John Innes, Bishop of Moray, 1407- 1410, still remain sculptured in the Cathedral at Elgin. The coat ( Argent , three estoiles azure) is differenced by the insertion of the head of a crozier between the estoiles. The series of seals of the great Benedictine Abbey of Molk, or Melk, on the Danube in Lower Austria, which are engraved in Huber’s Austria Illustrata , afford good illustrations of the practices which prevailed from the thirteenth to the eighteenth century with regard to the disposition of arms upon the seals of Ecclesiastics. The seals of Abbots Walter (1232), Gerung (1277), Friedrich (1292), and Ulric (1312), bear simply their own seated effigies. That of Abbot Ottakar (1327) is the earliest which shows a shield of arms ; it is placed in the lower angle of the vesica, beneath the figure of the Abbot, and bears the arms of the Abbey: Azure , a key with double wards , or rather two keys united in one Digitized by Google ( ^8 ) handle or bow, argent . The dedication of the Abbey is to SS. PETER and PAUL. Probably the coat originally con- tained two keys with their wards interlaced (see examples under the Sees of Engla?td in Part II.). The arms do not appear on the seal of Abbot Heinrich (1330), but are engraved on the secretum of Abbot Ludwig (1358). Per- sonal arms are first added on the seal of Abbot Gotts- chalk (1385). This bears the effigy of St. Benedict ; the arms of the Abbey appear on a shield on the right hand, while one charged with the attire of a stag is placed on the left. Abbot Ludwig II. (1392) and Leonard (1432) use the double key as a device, beneath the feet of the effigy, but not enclosed in a shield. Abbots John (1414), Nicolas (1420), Christian (1447), and JOHN II. (1458), use the shield with the Abbey arms. By Abbots Wolfgang (1485), and John Schonberg (1551) the effigy of St. Benedict is placed between shields containing their personal arms on the dexter, and those of the Abbey on the sinister. Abbots Michael Grien (1563) and Urban (1568) yield the place of honour, on the dexter side, to the Abbey arms. Abbot Kaspar Hoffman (1590) quarters the arms of the Abbey in the first and fourth with those of his family in the second and third, and surmounts the shield with a mitre. The five succeeding Abbots, whose seals close the series, Reiner Landau (1630), Valentine Embalner (1639), Edmond Luger (1677), Gregory Muller (1680), and Berthold Dietmair (1701), all place the arms of the Abbey in an escucheon upon the quartered shield of their personal arms, and surmount the whole with a mitre enfiling a pastoral staff. In modern times the Abbots of Melk bear in the 1st and 4th quarters, Or, an eagle displayed and dimidiated sable armed gules issuing from the palar line ; in the 2nd and 3rd are the personal arms ; and over all an escu- cheon of the arms of the Abbey, Azure, the double key. Digitized by v^ooQle ( 29 ) Besides their constant use on seals, and monumental memorials, either of glass or of stone, armorial bearings are frequently found embroidered on ancient ecclesiasti- cal vestments, and abroad this custom has never died out. Shields of arms thus appear embroidered upon the ends of the vittce , or fanotis , of the mitres ; on the orphreys of the cope and chasuble ; on the lower parts of the dalmatic and tunicle ; and on the stole, where they appear on each side at the level of the breast. The stole worn by the Pope is of red silk, thus embroidered on each breast with his personal arms with their usual accompaniments, the tiara and keys. The arms of the donor are often embroidered on the vestments and altar fittings presented to churches. Even the corporals in CORPUS CHRISTI COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE, were embroidered with armorial bearings (see Report of the Historical MSS. Commission , vol. i., p. 72). A chasuble given by St. LOUIS of France to Thomas DE BlVlLLE, is of silk, embroidered with gold thread, and is composed entirely of lozenge-shaped compartments containing heraldic charges — the fleur-de-lis of FRANCE, the castle of Castile, the lion of Leon, and the eagle displayed of Savoy - MAURIENNE (see De Caumont AbMdaire (T A rcJiceologie Religieuse , where it is engraved at pp. 448-450). In the celebrated case of ScROPE versus GROSVENOR {temp. Richard II.), the poet Chaucer gave evidence of the use of the arms of ScROPE upon vestments, among other things. On the seal of Anthony Bek, Bishop of Durham (1283-1310) his effigy is represented wearing a chasuble, on the breast of which appears the large cross moline of his arms {Gules, a cross fer-de-moline ermine). The Church of Durham inherited from him seven vestments, “ cum una cruce de armis ejusdem quae dicuntur ferrum molendini.” Similarly the effigy of LOUIS DE Beau- Digitized by Google ( 30 ) MONT, Bishop of Durham (1318), as represented on his seal, wears a chasuble embroidered with his arms : Azure, fleury and a lion rampant argent ( Catalogue of Seals in the British Museum , Nos. 2452 and 2459). The orphreys of the celebrated Lyon House Cope, now at South Kensington, are heraldic, and contain the arms of England, Ferrers, Newburgh, Castile and Leon, Clifford, Despenser, Geneville, Gran- dison, Percy, Mortimer, Bassingborne, etc. A curious reference to armorial bearings was made on the tomb of the Cardinal de PALUD, who was buried in the Abbey of TOURNUS. His arms were: Gules , a cross ermine . Accordingly on his tomb the Cardinal is vested as a priest ; the stole, maniple, and the cross of the chasuble, are all of ermine ; we may fairly conjecture that the colour of the vestment was red (MENESTRIER, L'Art du Blason justify pp. 81, 82). On the celebrated Percy shrine at Beverley one of the sepulchral effigies represents a priest of that family, probablyabout the fourteenth century. On it the chasuble, alb, and maniple are ornamented with a series of twenty different shields of arms. (See Mr Longstaffe’s “Old Heraldry of the Percies,’* in Archceologia Ailiana , i860; pp. 157, 192, etc.) Cole mentions an altar cloth at St. Edward’s Church at CAMBRIDGE, which had on it a coat of arms : Or, a chevron nebuU argent and azure , between three choughs proper (probably for the family of Cromer). We may refer also to the Inventory of the Goods of the Guild of the Blessed Virgin in BOSTON, taken in 1334. “Item, an altar cloth of tawny damaske wl Egles standyng on bookes, wl this l’re, crowned, of the gift of mr John Robynson esquyer, wl the armes of the said mr ROBYNSON in the myddes of the altar cloth, wl a frontell of the same therto belonginge havynge the seide armes at every end of the seide Digitized by CjOOQle ( 3i ) frontell.” Other gifts of altar furnishing were made by the same person, and were all embroidered with the arms of the donor. (See English Church Furniture at the Period of the Reformation , edited by Edw. PEACOCK, F.S.A., Herald and Genealogist , iv., 169.) In Italy and Spain I have seen many sets of vestments, both for the officiants and for the altar, on each piece of which the arms of the pious donor are represented. At Wadstena in Sweden a set bears the arms of the great family of STURE (Or, three nenuphar leaves in bend sable). Digitized by Google CHAPTER II. External Heraldic Ornaments, Spiritual and Temporal — The Coronet, its use on the Continent— The Temporal Sword — Helmets and Crests used by Ecclesiastics — Military Fiefs held by Ecclesiastics — The Church Militant — The Ecclesiastical Hat, etc. We have now to consider the several ornaments, external to the shield of arms, which have been in use to distin- guish the different grades and offices of ecclesiastics. They are of two kinds : those which indicate spiritual authority, and those which denote temporal rank or jurisdiction. Of the former class are : — the Papal Tiara, and the Keys ; the Pallium ; the Mitre ; the Patriarchal, Archi-episcopal, and Legatine Crosses ; the Crozier, or Pastoral Staff ; the Bourdon ; and the Ecclesiastical Hat. To the latter class belong the Coronet ; the Princely and Electoral Hats ; the Mantlings ; the Helmet and Crest; the Temporal Sword; and the Crosses and Badges of Knighthood ; or of Chapteral Rank. The ensigns of spiritual authority which compose the first class fall naturally for consideration under the respective ecclesiastical ranks which they serve to dis- tinguish ; and it will only be needful to offer in this place a few remarks upon the use by ecclesiastics of those external insignia which are by custom joined to the shield of arms as indications of secular rank or temporal jurisdiction. Of these the most common is the coronet. This, though only used by ecclesiastics in our own country in the very rare cases in which they happen to be peers of Digitized by t^oosle ( 33 ) the realm by descent, is in frequent use by foreign ecclesiastics for various reasons. We may remark here, that on the continent the use of coronets as heraldic ornaments is much more general than in these realms, where they are used only by princes and princesses of the Royal House; by peers and peeresses; and (according to modern usage but in violation of strict heraldic propriety) by the eldest sons (and their wives) of peers of the three highest grades. But upon the continent all the children of counts and barons use their father’s coronet, and usually one of his titles also ; while in Italy even the remote cadets of great families often use their coronets ; add to their names such words as “ dei Conti de . . . and have by general courtesy the title of the head of the family. The following extract will suffice to indicate the modern usage in France. “ L’ordonnance du 25 aotit 1817 £tablit la hi£rarchie des pairs, reglant que les fils ain£s prendraient le titre immediatement inferieur a celui du p£re, et les fils puines les autres titres pareille- ment inferieurs entre eux.” ( La Noblesse de France , p. 75.) Thus the eldest son of the Due DES Cars, has the title of Marquis des Cars, but his uncles, the brothers of the Due, had respectively the titles of Comte, and Vicomte DES Cars. Similarly the eldest son of the Due de Levis is Marquis de Levis ; his uncles bearing the title of Count, and Vicomte DE Levis. (Though the regu- lation applied only to pairs de France , the custom was soon adopted by other nobles who had not that dignity. There is not, however, uniformity of practice.) Again, on the continent members of ancient noble and knightly families very generally use a coronet to indicate their descent, even though they may not have the right to use the specific title of baron, count, etc. ; this is seldom understood by us, where a title is, wrongly’, thought essential to nobility. As this is so in civil life, D Digitized by Google ( 34 ) it is consequently general for members of noble families to retain the coronet as an external ornament of their arms after they have been admitted into the ecclesiastical state. Again, abroad coronets are used by ecclesiastics whether they are of noble families or not, when, as is frequently the case in Germany and elsewhere, temporal lordships are attached as endowments to ecclesiastical dignities held by them. Again, in Germany and France, the dignity of Count, or Countess, was by Imperial or Royal grant, used by members of many noble - chapters in right of their canonries. And lastly the dignity of “ Comte-Romaine ” is still occasionally conferred by the Pope on ecclesiastics of eminence. Examples of the use of coronets, both as indicative of noble descent, and as denoting the possession of temporal rank and jurisdiction acquired along with the ecclesiastical dignity, will be given in abundance as we proceed. Temporal jurisdiction, the jus gladii \\ is very frequently indicated by a naked sword, placed in saltire with the pastoral staff of the ecclesiastical dignity, behind the coroneted shield. ( See Plates V., XV., XVI.) Sometimes the crosier and sword, instead of being in saltire behind the shield, are placed paleways on cither side of it. ( See Plate XIII., fig. 4.) Not unfrequently one finds a person whose knowledge of Foreign Armory is probably derived from a French elementary book on Heraldry, and who will dogmati- cally insist that ecclesiastics have no right at all to use helmets and crests, though he seldom is consistent enough to suggest their return to the use of the “ Popish ” ecclesiastical hat. To such it is sufficient to say that a wider knowledge of Foreign Heraldry would have had the inevitable effect of modifying his statement as to “ right,” though he might retain, if he desired, his views as to Digitized by Google ( 35 ) propriety. But, after all, it is custom that determines the matter. In many countries the helmet and crest are not used by ecclesiastics in general, but our own country and Germany form exceptions to the rule. The great German herald Spener, who discusses the propriety of the use of the helm by ecclesiastics, approves, but says that in any case, with or against propriety, practice has settled the matter so far as Germany is concerned. In Germany the use of helmets and crests by ecclesiastics has always been general as a result of that frequent union of temporal rank with spiritual dignity to which I have already made allusion. Abbots, abbesses, bishops, and archbishops were very frequently also secular princes, counts, or barons, holding the lands of their Sees or Abbeys immediately from the Crown ; and bound con- sequently to furnish their feudal contingent of troops to their Royal or Imperial Superior, so that the use of military insignia to denote this fact was retained by clerics. (On the military fiefs held by ecclesiastics in Germany and on their forms of investiture, see the curious treatise of SCHILTER, de Feudo Nobili, 1696. Extracts therefrom are given in BURGERMEISTER, Bibliotheca Equestris , ii., 990- 1015, Ulm, 1720. See also PRAUN, von des Adels Heerschilden, etc.) Again, the temporal power and possessions belong- ing to the Spiritual Princes : — the Elector- Archbishops of Mainz, COln, and Trier; and to the numerous Prince-Bishops, and Abbots of the Empire, — were so great that these dignities were eagerly sought, and con- tinually filled by churchmen who were already by inheritance in possession of military fiefs ; while the custom of placing above the escucheon a crested helm for $ach fief which conferred on its possessor the right to a vote in the Circles of the Empire, naturally contributed to the retention of these military insignia by ecclesiastics. It must also be remembered that in Germany the crested Digitized by Google ( 36 ) helm is not looked upon, as among us, as a subordinate accessory to shields of arms, but is considered as being of at least equal importance with them! In our own country helmets and crests are gene- rally used by ecclesiastics below Episcopal rank, but the custom, which has not the same excuse as in Germany, has often, and not unreasonably, been denounced as a violation of strict heraldic propriety. Helmets and crests were intended for use in war and martial exercises, and there is consequently some incon- gruity in their employment either by ecclesiastics, or by ladies. Instances may indeed be found in which the heralds of the gospel of peace have been lee} to take a very active part in offensive warfare, from the times of the Crusading Prelates, to our own day when, in the American War of Secession, Bishop Leonidas Polk led to battle the forces of the Confederate States. Even before the Crusades military ecclesiastics were found in the armies of the Frankish kings. GREGORY OF Tours (lib. iv\\, cap. xliii., says) — “ Fuerunt in hoc pradio Salonius et Sagittarius, fratres atque episcopi, qui non cruce ccelesti muniti, sed galea aut lorica saeculari armati, multos manibus propriis, quod pejus est, interfecisse referuntur.” Charlemagne, in conjunction with the Church, endea- voured to reform these abuses (see les Capitulaires , lib. vi. et vii.). An old French Historian, Guil. de Breton, mentions Philip de Dreux, Bishop of Beauvais, who at the battle of Bou VINES, in 1244, unhorsed, and beat out the brains of several of the enemy with a mace, so as not to break the letter of the law which forbade the use of the sword by ecclesiastics {v. /., p. 95). Jean de Montaigu, Archbishop of Sens, was slain in battle in 1416. Another well-known story is that of the Pope who sent to demand the release of one of these martial prelates — styling him his beloved son. The King is said Digitized by CjOOQle ( 37 ) to have returned the coat of mail worn by the Bishop, with the text — “ Know now, whether this be thy son’s coat or no!” (Gen. xxxvii., 32). ( See VON Lowhen’s Analysis of Nobility , p. 164.) So in Italy GUIDO Tarlatti, Bishop of Arezzo, was so eminent a warrior that his tomb erected in 1330 is richly sculptured with sixteen bas-reliefs of his battles and sieges. At the battle of Bouvines the Abbot of S. M£dard at SOISSONS himself led to battle a hundred and fifty of his vassals. In England, Henry LE Despenser, the warlike Bishop of NORWICH (1370-1406), used on his secretum the shield of his personal arms, timbred with a mitre from which rises the crest, a dragon’s head between a pair of wings. In the Armorial de Gelre , the arms and crest are given, but a helmet is inter- posed between the shield and the mitre. ( See Plate V., figs. 1 and 3.) The seal of Bishop Richard Courtenay, also of Norwich (1413-15), bears a couche shield timbred with a crested helm. ( Cata- logue of Seals in the British Museum , No. 2050.) The use by the Bishops of DURHAM of crested and plumed helmets on their palatinate seals will be referred to hereafter. Although an ecclesiastic may if he choose use helmet and crest, yet it is not necessary that he should do so. On the continent many ecclesiastics have contented themselves with bearing the arms of their family in a simple oval escucheon or cartouche. In most countries the use of the helmet and crest has been supplanted by the adoption for all grades of ecclesiastics of a flat, broad-brimmed, low-crowned hat, varying for each rank in its colour, and in the number of the houppes , or tassels, with which the ends of its cords or strings are adorned. The use of the ecclesiastical hat does not seem ever to have been general in this country to any great extent, or in Germany. Accordingly, when it is Digitized by Google ( 3« ) met with in this country on a book-cover, an engraving, or some work of art, it is (in accordance with the pre- valent ignorance of foreign heraldic matters) nearly always taken to be indicative of the rank of cardinal, and is not unfrequently so described with an amount of positiveness corresponding to that of the assertors ignorance.

Thus Louis CLOQUET, “ chanoine diacre ” of the Church of Reims at the com- mencement of the eighteenth century used for his book- stamp an oval cartouche, encircled by a branch of olive, and another of palm, and bearing the armes parlantes : Azure , a chevron between three bells, in chief a crescent (?for difference) all argent . ( Armorial du Bibliophile , i., 161.) The library of Jean des Cordes, Canon of LIMOGES, who died in 1643, was acquired by Cardinal Mazarin, and the books bear the arms of the Canon (Azure, two lions rampant addorsed or) in an oval escucheon without any mark of ecclesiastical dignity. NICOLAS Doinet, Canon of Reims in 1722, bore: Gules, on a fess or, three canettes sable, in an oval escucheon encircled by palm branches. (Guigard, tome i., 184-185.) The book-stamp used by Jean de Sainte AndrE, Digitized by C^ooQle ( 40 ) Canon of Notre Dame at Paris, at the close of the sixteenth century, bears his arms (. Azure, a castle triple- towered argent , masoned sable , in chief three estoiles of five points or) on an escucheon surmounted by a full-faced helmet with grilles, above which is placed a biretta , or four-cornered ecclesiastical cap. (Plate III., fig. 2.) There are several other examples of the use of the biretta, but I know no other where it is used thus to surmount a helmet. One where it surmounts a coronet is given later on at p. 48. Pierre le Jeune, Canon, bore: Gules , a chevron between in chief a sun in splendour , and in base a rose issuing from a hearty all or , the shield timbred with a biretta. (GuiGARD, Armorial du Bibliophile , ii., 51.) Francois Robert Secousse, Doctor in Theology, Cure of St. Eustache in Paris, about 1750, used the biretta alone above the escucheon of his arms (Azure, a chevron between two pierced mullets , and a garb ; in chief a crescent , all or . (The crescent was here not a mark of cadency but a regular charge — his brother, Denis Francois, who died in 1754, used the same arms.) Melchior B. M. Cochet du Magny (d. 1791), Canon of the Royal Chapel (la Saintc Chapelle) at Dijon, used the biretta alone, above the shield of his arms (Argent, a cock gules. (GUIGARD, i., 16 1.) Much more general was the use of the ecclesiastical hat. The common priest’s hat is flat, broad-brimmed, of a black- colour, and had originally on either side a cord, or string, terminating in a single tassel. In later times, when ecclesi- astics generally seem to have claimed and used something more than they were legally entitled to, the single tassel was replaced by a double one. This hat was represented above the shield, or oval cartouche containing the arms. Members of a Regular Order often impaled its armorial bearings, or its device, with their personal arms, giving the place of honour on the dexter side of the shield to the bearings so assumed. Thus, the book- Digitized by C^ooQle Digitized by t^oosle Digitized by t^oosle Canons, Em PLATE III . 1. Henri Bandeau, Canon of Paris. 2. Jean de Si. Andrt, Canon of Paris. 3.

Protonotaries and Chanters were frequently, per- haps ordinarily, chosen from among the Canons. The Chanters, or Precentors, denoted their office by placing behind the shield of arms the baton with which they led the choral music, and which they are often represented as holding on early seals. The seal of HENRI, Chantre de Troyes in 1227, shows his standing effigy, holding in one hand a baton the head of which is a fleur-de-lis , and in the other a song book. (Demay, Le Costume du Moyen Age apres les Sceaux , p. 293.) On the seal of Guillaume, Chanter of Evreux in 1236, his effigy is similarly represented, but the baton is not floriated. On that of Gautier, Chanter of le Mans, the figure holds a baton only. The counter-seal of"
