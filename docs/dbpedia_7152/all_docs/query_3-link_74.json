        "text": "In article <KmW8a.190132$K71....@news1.central.cox.net>,\n\n\"Phil Moody\" <moody...@cox.net> quoted an earlier message from Peter\n\nStewart:\n\n>Date: Wed, 11 Apr 2001 14:11:23 +1000\n\n>From: \"Stewart, Peter\" <Peter....@crsrehab.gov.au>\n\n>To: GEN-MED...@rootsweb.com\n\n>Subject: RE: Guy I de Ponthieu\n\n>\n\n>By the way, a later edition of the *Carmen de Hastingae Proelio* by Frank\n\n>Barlow (Oxford, 1999) ... reverts to the earlier general opinion that Judith,\n\n>the wife of Earl Waltheof, was her daughter by a second marriage to Lambert\n\n>of Lens rather than a posthumous daughter of her first husband Enguerrand of\n\n>Ponthieu, as argued by Morton & Muntz [p 127, note 2]...\n\nJust to follow this up, I looked at Barlow. This is briefly covered at\n\np. xlv of his introduction, note 128 (and in the chart opposite, on p.\n\nxliv). He notes that Adelaide \"may have married, secondly, Lambert\n\ncount of Lens,\" but then goes on to point out that Judith \"is expressly\n\nidentified\" in the 12th-century _Vita et passio Waldevi comitis_ as\n\nLambert's daughter. While admittedly not quite contemporary, this\n\naccount certainly drew on a fund of familial knowledge of Earl Waltheof\n\nand his family, and should not be rejected out of hand if there does not\n\nseem to have been any reason to funge the parentage of Judith, or if\n\nthere are no aspersions cast on the Vita's general veracity.\n\nThe apparent chronological difficulty with Lambert is that Adelaide's\n\nfirst husband, Enguerrand II, count of Ponthieu, died 25 October 1053,\n\nwhile Lambert of Lens died in the following summer of 1054. I can't\n\nremember in detail, but wasn't this tight chronology the basis for\n\nMorton & Muntz's doubt that Adelaide could have married Lambert and had\n\nJudith by him in this period? I don't remember if Morton & Muntz even\n\ndiscussed the _Vita et passio Waldevi comitis_. The remaining problem\n\nthat Morton & Muntz dwell on is that there doesn't seem to be any\n\nindependent confirmation that Adelaide ever was actually married to\n\nLambert, and Barlow still begins his note with \"Adelaide... *may* have\n\nmarried ... Lambert.\"\n\nBarlow illuminates us on one apparent solution to the tight chronology:\n\nAdelaide's and Enguerrand's marriage had been condemned in October 1049\n\nat the Council of Rheims, so she could have been married to Lambert\n\nbefore Enguerrand's death (i.e. anytime from the end of 1049 onward),\n\nwhich gives a larger window of opportunity. Barlow also seems to be\n\nsuggesting that Adelaide and Lambert need not have been *married* for\n\nher to have had a child by Lambert. If her marriage to Enguerrand had\n\nbeen dissolved in such a high-profile council, there would have been\n\nless stigma attached to this than one would otherwise expect:\n\nfornication was little commented on, while adultery would be beyond the\n\npale (though in 11th-century aristocratic France, we see it all).\n\nEither way, Lambert's paternity seems perfectly plausible.\n\nBTW, I know from other contexts that the council of Rheims is famous as\n\nthe premiere stage of the papal reforms of Leo IX, and there is a vivid\n\nnarrative account in the _Historia dedicationis ecclesiae Sancti\n\nRemigii_ (PL 142:1417-40), retold by Southern in _The Making of the\n\nMiddle Ages_ (pp. 125-127): a passage I like to have students read. I'd\n\nlike to check this narrative as well as Mansi & Bouquet (cited by Barlow\n\nfor the council) to see what detail exists on the specific condemnation.\n\nAnd finally, if someone has Morton & Muntz's _Carmen_ handy and I have\n\nmisrepresented their arguments against Lambert's paternity, by all means\n\nspeak up.\n\nNat Taylor\n\nhttp://home.earthlink.net/~nathanieltaylor/\n\nTwaddle.\n\nRichardson proves yet again that his knowledge of English Mediaeval History is\n\nnon-existent.\n\nMatilda, daughter of King Henry I of England, *was* her father's heiress.\n\nHenry had 22-24 bastards and a legitimate son, William The Aetheling, who was\n\ndrowned in the Wreck of the White Ship on 25 November 1125 ---- ten years\n\nbefore Henry's death.\n\nSo, Henry I had no surviving legitimate son to succeed to the throne.\n\nMatilda, his legitimate daughter, had married Henry V, The Holy Roman Emperor\n\nand was styled as The Empress Matilda in English, as she preferred. Her\n\nhusband, Henry V died in 1125 of cancer. The couple had no issue.\n\nMatilda returned to England after the death of her husband and Henry I began\n\nto groom her for succession to the throne. She was widowed and childless as\n\nwell as pretty well Germanised [read arrogant and pretentious, in English\n\neyes], having first gone to the Continent when she was eight years old and\n\nhaving married Henry V when she was 11.\n\nThe British nobles and bishops did not particularly cotton to this\n\nJennie-foreigner as their future queen ---- but Henry I did his best to secure\n\ntheir oaths of support that they would loyally defend her claims if she\n\noutlived her father and he left no legitimate son.\n\nMatilda married Geoffrey 'le Bel' comte d'Anjou, Touraine et Maine in 1127.\n\nNow she was Brunhilde with a frog husband in the minds of many of the stalwart\n\nBritish nobles and bishops.\n\nHenry I died in 1135 without fathering a legitimate son. His death led to a\n\ndisputed succession just as had the deaths of the two previous Norman kings of\n\nEngland, William I 'The Conqueror' and William II 'Rufus'.\n\nWhen Henry I died on 1 Dec 1135, of a surfeit of lampreys as some say, Matilda\n\nwas out of pocket on the Continent.\n\nStephen, a grandson of William The Conqueror, quickly seized the initiative\n\nand crossed to England to seize the crown where he was accepted as King by the\n\nworthies of London, whose trading connections with Stephen's lands in Boulogne\n\nhelped to win them to his side.\n\nStephen pressed on to Winchester, where his brother, Bishop Henry of\n\nWinchester, persuaded an initially reluctant Archbishop of Canterbury to crown\n\nStephen as King, the custodian of the treasure to hand over the keys, and the\n\nmagnates who were present to accept him as monarch.\n\nSome of the nobles and clerics seem to have abandoned Matilda because they\n\nconstrued their oath to Henry I to have held only if Henry did not give his\n\ndaughter Matilda in marriage to anyone outside the Kingdom without consulting\n\nthem.\n\nA Great Civil War ensued when Matilda tried to fight back and reclaim the\n\nthrone in 1139. This Civil War lasted until 1153 when Stephen finally agreed\n\nto allow Matilda's son Henry to succeed him on the throne as Henry II\n\n'Curtmantle'. Yes, the one who was married to Eleanor of Aquitaine,\n\nRichardson. Henry II also inherited his father Geoffrey's lands and titles.\n\nGeoffrey was quite a dashing figure, the Antonio Banderas of his day.\n\nSo, once again, we see that Richardson is simply grossly ignorant of the\n\nhistorical and biographical facts and is no more fit to write this book that\n\nhe is attempting, PA3, than would be an eager pimply-faced, ignorant, naïve\n\nadolescent boy ---- presented with the excellent Faris manuscript for PA2.\n\nMost Amusing....\n\nRichardson does not know even the most BASIC facts about the period ---- and\n\nconsistently falls into error and pratfall:\n\nKAWHOMP!!!\n\nKERSPLAT!!!\n\nFURTHER, Richardson makes three ADDITIONAL outrageous gaffes:\n\n1. Matilda DID inherit some of Henry I's lands. Richardson demonstrates he\n\ndoes NOT even know what they were.\n\n2. Stephen never had firm control as Duke of Normandy. He completely lost\n\ncontrol in 1144 when Geoffrey captured Rouen.\n\n3. Richardson has ignorantly misread the passage I quoted from Morton &\n\nMuntz.\n\nKAWHOMP!!!\n\nKERSPLAT!!!\n\nDeus Vult.\n\n\"I pass with relief from the tossing sea of Cause and Theory to the firm\n\nground of Result and Fact.\"\n\nSir Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill [1874-1965] ---- The Malakand Field\n\nForce [1898]\n\nAll replies to the newsgroup please.

They present stronger arguments than Nat\n\n>Taylor gives them credit for.\n\nThis on-topic and useful contribution (!) corrects my recollection of\n\nMorton and Muntz; and I will pull Morton & Muntz off the shelf this week\n\nto look it over again. Since they do discuss the _Vita_ and claim it to\n\nbe untrustworthy, it is disappointing that Barlow simply cites the text,\n\nwithout any defense of it or refutation of Morton & Muntz: this is the\n\nlazy historian indulging in bad genealogy.\n\n> One point they make is that \"Lambert's lands passed to his older brother,\n\n> Eustace II of Boulogne, and none were assigned to Judith, although an heiress\n\n> normally inherited at least a portion of her father's property, (as Adelaide\n\n> the younger did, if not the whole (as Agnes/Anna of Ponthieu and Matilda of\n\n> Boulogne did).\"\n\nI am not sure how strongly to weigh this point. If the 'assignment' is\n\nmade prescriptively (in some sort of testament, for example), then that\n\nmakes it considerably less likely that Judith is Lambert's legitimate\n\ndaughter. If this statement of M&M is based only on the known\n\nreabsorbtion of the Lens appanage by Eustace II, and not by some\n\nprescriptive assignment, then it is certainly possible that we are\n\ndealing with an uncle usurping his niece's rights.\n\nThe bottom line is that the question appears still unresolved. Barlow\n\nneglected to defend the text he offers as evidence but which had\n\npreviously been impugned; nor does he respond to this negative argument\n\nabout the descent of property. I would like to know more about the\n\n_Vita Waldevi_ and about the documentation of Eustace II being successor\n\nto his brother (and about that Melrose pedigree, though I doubt it has\n\nindependent probative value here). I am inclined to applaud Dave\n\nGreene's caution in only following maternal ancestry for Judith when\n\npresenting the most proximal royal descent for her in the TG piece.\n\nNat Taylor\n\nhttp://home.earthlink.net/~nathanieltaylor/\n\n\"Nathaniel Taylor\" wrote:\n\n> BTW, I know from other contexts that the council of Rheims is famous as\n\n> the premiere stage of the papal reforms of Leo IX, and there is a vivid\n\n> narrative account in the _Historia dedicationis ecclesiae Sancti\n\n> Remigii_ (PL 142:1417-40), retold by Southern in _The Making of the\n\n> Middle Ages_ (pp. 125-127): a passage I like to have students read.

If someone more knowledgeable can\n\nillustrate a consanguineous relationship between the Dukes of Normandy, and\n\nthe Counts of Ponthieu, I would appreciate the clarification.\n\nI think you are judging Barlow to harshly, when you compare his effort to\n\nother genealogical works. I have never seen a copy of CP, but I do have the\n\nentry for AUMALE from the condensed edition; so lets see what a genealogist\n\nhas to say about the matter at hand, shall we:-)\n\n\"1. Adelaide (a) or Adeliz, sister of William the Conqueror,(b) being\n\nillegit. da. of Robert, Duke of the Normans, by Herleve or Harlotte, da. of\n\nFulbert or Robert, a pelliparius of Falaise, is mentioned in Domesday as\n\nComitissa de Albamarla, and as holding some manors in Essex and Suffolk. In\n\n1082, William, King of the English, and Maud, his wife, gave to the Abbey of\n\nLa Trinité at Caen the bourg of Le Homme (de Hulmo) in the Côtentin, \"sed et\n\nComitissa A. de Albamarla concedente eo videlicet pacto ut ipsa teneret in\n\nvita sua.\"(c) Adelaide m., 1stly, Enguerrand II, Count of Ponthieu, who d.\n\ns.p.m., being slain in 1053.(d)\n\n(a) For some discussion on mediæval English names, see vol. iii, Appendix C.\n\nV.G.\n\n(b) The pedigree of the earlier possessors of Aumale has been investigated\n\nby T. Stapleton in _Archaeologia_, vol. xxvi, pp. 349-360. There he supposed\n\nhe had proved that Orderic was wrong in stating that the wife of Count Eudes\n\nof Champagne was da. Of Duke Robert, and, that she was really the Duke's\n\ngrand-daughter. Later on, he discovered his own error. His amended\n\nconclusions are in _Coll. Top. et Gen._, vol. Vi, p. 265, and, at greater\n\nlength, in _Rot. Scacc. Norm._, vol. ii, pp. xxix-xxxi. He had, however, in\n\nthe mean time misled Poulson (_Holderness_, vol. i, p. 24 sqq.).\n\n(c) _Gallia Christ._, vol. xi, instr., c. 68-72. Stapleton always misdates\n\nthis charter.\n\n(d) A charter of the Church of St. Martin, at Auchy (now Aumale), narrates\n\nits foundation \"a viro quodam videlicet Guerinfrido qui condidit castellum\n\nquod Albamarla nuncupatur in externis partibus Normannie super flumen quod\n\nAugus dicitur,\" this charter being drawn up \"jussu Enguerrani consulis qui\n\nfilius fuit Berte supradicti Guerinfridi filie et Adelidis comitisse uxoris\n\nsue sororis scilicet Willelmi Regis Anglorum,\" and mentioning \"Addelidis\n\ncomitissa supradicti Engueranni et supradicte Adelidis filia que post obitum\n\nillorum in imperio successit,\" and also \"Judita comitissa domine supradicte\n\nfilia.\" (Archaeologia, ibid., pp. 358-360). As to Judith, in the _Vita et\n\npassio venerabilis viri Gualdevi comitis Huntendonie et Norhantonie_ (an MS.\n\nof the 13th century in the Douai library), printed by F. Michel, _Chron.\n\nAnglo-Normandes_, vol. ii. It is stated, p. 112, that King William gave to\n\nWaltheof \"in uxorem neptem suam Ivettam, filliam comitis Lamberti de Lens,\n\nsororem nobilis viri Stephani comitis de Albemarlia.\" EQ\n\nThe passeo is the sole reference CP uses to assert that Judith is the\n\ndaughter of Lambert of Lens. I would be very interested in reading Thomas\n\nStapleton's (1805-1849) article in Archaeologia, but I have had no luck\n\nsearching the web sources. Perhaps someone with CP can provide a fuller\n\ncitation?\n\nI have located the _Magni rotuli scaccarii Normannie sub regibus Angliæ_\n\nopera T. Stapleton, published London 1840, 1844, but it will do little good\n\nwithout the fuller Archaeologia piece.\n\nBest Wishes,\n\nPhil\n\n\"Nathaniel Taylor\" <nta...@post.harvard.edu> wrote in message\n\nnews:ntaylor-0ED69F...@nnrp02.earthlink.net...\n\n\n\nIn article <sMSaa.17583$WA....@news1.central.cox.net>,\n\n\"Phil Moody\" <moody...@cox.net> wrote:\n\n>\"Nathaniel Taylor\" wrote:\n\n>\n\n>> BTW, I know from other contexts that the council of Rheims is famous as\n\n>> the premiere stage of the papal reforms of Leo IX, and there is a vivid\n\n>> narrative account in the _Historia dedicationis ecclesiae Sancti\n\n>> Remigii_ (PL 142:1417-40), retold by Southern in _The Making of the\n\n>> Middle Ages_ (pp. 125-127): a passage I like to have students read.

Stapleton says of the former\n\nthat \"she did not long survive her br., King William\", but there is nothing\n\ndefinite\n\nknown beyond that she was living in 1082 and dead in 1090. There seems to be\n\nno charter in which the younger Adelaide is called Countess. The charter of\n\nher\n\nhalf-brother, Stephen, dated 14 July 1096, is \"consensu simul et\n\ncorroboratione\n\nsororis mee Adelidis,\" showing that she had some rights on Aumale. It is not\n\nvery clear\n\nwhat they were, though she is said in the charter quoted above to have\n\nsucceeded\n\n\"in imperio.\" Nothing further seems to be known about her, but Count Stephen\n\nhad eventually the whole inheritance.\"\n\nFrom what's said there, it does seem to be the younger Adelaide who had\n\ninherited rights of some sort to Aumale, not Judith. It seems odd to\n\nquestion - as apparently Morton and Muntz did - whether Judith was Lambert's\n\ndaughter on the basis that she inherited nothing from him, and to suggest\n\nthat she was Enguerrand's daughter instead - in which case the same\n\ndifficulty would apply.\n\nI was surprised to find an online paper (in French) by Elisabeth van Houts\n\nwhich includes an extended discussion of the succession to the county of\n\nAumale about this time, in which she suggests - on the basis of the St\n\nmartin of Auchy charters - that the younger Adelaide not only claimed the\n\ncounty as her father's heir, but may actually have made her claim good\n\nduring her half-brother Stephen's absence on the first crusade:\n\nhttp://www.unicaen.fr/mrsh/crahm/revue/tabularia/vanhoutst2.html#pgfId-70013\n\n6\n\n(Incidentally, this is on the website of \"Tabularia\", an online journal\n\nfocusing on medieval written sources of Normandy. It looks as though there\n\nmay be a lot more useful information there, but I haven't cracked the\n\nnavigation system yet.)\n\nVan Houts points out that the younger Adelaide is called countess in the\n\ncharter quoted by CP - \"Addelidis comitissa supradicti Engueranni et\n\nsupradicte Adelidis filia, que post obitum illorum in inperio successit\"\n\n(despite the odd statement by CP, quoted above, that there is no charter in\n\nwhich she is called countess).\n\nAll this does seem to suggest that Judith was not Enguerrand's daughter,\n\nalthough van Houts acknowledges that the only evidence for the identity of\n\nthe elder Adelaide's second husband is the Vita Waldevi.\n\nIncidentally, van Houts also believes that the elder Adelaide was a paternal\n\nhalf-sister of William I, quoting the evidence that's already been discussed\n\nhere, but oddly interpreting Robert de Torigny's description of her as his\n\n\"uterine sister\" to mean \"paternal half-sister\" - \"Elle a été identifiée\n\ncomme sour utérine ( soror uterina ) - dans le sens de demi-sour\n\npaternelle - par Robert de Torigni ( GND , II, p. 272). \"\n\n(She backs this up, if I've understood correctly, by reference to a use of\n\nthe same phrase by the same author to describe William of Eu - \"Cf. aussi\n\nRobert de Torigni sur Guillaume d'Eu, frère utérin de Richard II par leur\n\npère, Richard I ( GND , II, p. 128).\" But I'm confused by that - am I wrong\n\nin thinking that William was a full brother of Richard II?)\n\nChris Phillips\n\n\"Nathaniel Taylor\" wrote:\n\n> The conflict was apparently over a prior affinity, not consanguinity:\n\n> Barlow states that it was because Enguerrand's sister (whose name is not\n\n> known) was married to Adelaide's uncle, William of Talou.

Would\n\nthis condemnation for affinity have the same force as an annulment, and\n\nwould Enguerrand and Adelaide be obliged to seperate? What effect would this\n\nhave on the legitamacy of their daughter Adelaide? I feel certain that all\n\nparties knew this affinity was present prior to the marriage; so why would a\n\npriest complete a marriage ceremony, that he knew was not going to be\n\nsanctioned by the church.\n\nIt is curious you mention William of Talou, because until two days ago, I\n\ndid not know William I and Adelaide had an Uncle named William:-) In C. T.\n\nClay's _The Origins of Some Anglo-Norman Families_, while refreshing my\n\nreading of Aumale, I came across the entry for Arques. Knowing Enguerrand\n\ndied at the battle of Arques, I read the entry and was instructed not to\n\nconfuse the English Arques family with that of William, Count of Arques, the\n\nUncle of William the Conqueror. This left me perplexed, but it seems you\n\nhave solved that problem for me. So, did the Uncle of William the Conqueror\n\nalso die at the battle of Arques, along with his brother-in-law Enguerrand?\n\nAumale was on the northern boundary of Normandy, and Mr. Clay asserts that\n\npart of the Comte lay outside the territory of Normandy, and therefore it\n\nmay not have been a comte of Normandy, strictly speaking. Ponthieu being the\n\nterritory on the north, Hugh II's marriage to Bertha de Aumale gave Ponthieu\n\na legitimate claim to territory within Normandy itself, and this potential\n\nthreat to Normandy appears to have been nullified with mariage alliances.\n\nNote (d) has this quote, which I sent yesterday; which I'm curious about:\n\n\"a viro quodam videlicet Guerinfrido qui condidit castellum quod Albamarla\n\nnuncupatur in externis partibus Normannie super flumen quod Augus dicitur,\"\n\ni.)

The marriage took place after the death of her\n\nfirst husband, Drogo in 1035. It is uncertain if she was the same wife as\n\nEustace had in 1049. In that year, Pope Leo IX excommunicated Counts\n\nEustace and Engelrand for incest (\"Excommunicavit etiam Comites Angelrai et\n\nEustacium proptrer incestum\"), and these are usually taken to be Eustace II\n\nof Boulogne and Engelrand II of Ponthieu. Now, curiously, if this was\n\nGodgifu, then the wives of both would be descended from Richard I of\n\nNormandy (Godgifu granddaughter, Adelaide great-granddaughter), and if (and\n\nI know this has just been\n\n> questioned) Engelrand and Eustace are half first cousins through their\n\npaternal grandmother, then perhaps that woman was kin to the Norman house,\n\nto Gunnora, or to Sprota's Ivry descendants.Murray even suggests the\n\npossibility that the divorce that certainly followed may have rendered\n\nillegitimate a possible son of the couple, Geoffrey, the Domesday tennant.\n\nPLM: Mike Ashley had written that it was Eustace II that married Godgifu,\n\nbut he also had Eustace dead in 1093, and due to the chronology, I assumed\n\nAshley had confused Eustace I with his son:-) He adds that Eustace II may of\n\nhad a daughter by Godgifu, for what it's worth. However, there may be a\n\nblood relationship between them all.\n\nAfter trawling the archives, I noted Hines was curious ES had to say about\n\nHugh I's wife Gisela's descent from Hugh Capet; so I went to Paul Theroff's\n\nsite, because I know he relies heavily on ES, and I downloaded his zip file\n\non the Capetians and printed it out.

After displaying all the dat, I will the edit the\n\nmaterial to eliminate the nonessential offspring, and flesh this out from my\n\ngleanings of the archived material, with a few comments.\n\nKing Robert I of France (866-k.a.nr Soissons 15 Jun 923); m.1st Aelis ___;\n\nm.2d ca 890 Beatrix (d.after Mar 931) dau.of Cte Heribert de Vermandois\n\n1.)

Emma, b.ca 943, d.after 19 Mar 968; m.Duke Richard I of Normandy\n\n(d.996) [As we saw in the fuller genealogy by Theroff, Duke Hugh did have a\n\nsister named Emma (Queen of France), and it would be logical that he named\n\none of his children after his sister. Furthermore, Richard I did have a\n\ndaughter named Emma, and this is consistent with the onamastics and the\n\nchronology. Additionally , if this relationship is reasonable, then Richard\n\nII of Normandy and Robert II of France would have been 1st cousins, and this\n\ncould very well be why Richard II named a son Robert, the 1st Norman Duke to\n\nbear this name].\n\n1.1.1) King Robert II (Orléans 27 Mar 972-Melun 20 Jul 1031, bur St.Denis);\n\nm.3d Constance (ca 986-Melun 25 Jul 1032, bur St.Denis) dau. of William II\n\nof Provence.\n\n1.1.1.1) Adelaide (ca 1009-Messines 8 Jan 1079); m.1st Jan 1027 Duke Richard\n\nIII of Normandy (d.1027); m.2d Paris 1028 Ct Baldwin V of Flanders (d.1067).\n\n1.1.2.)

He may have\n\nmarried Adelvie (Adelaide) of Guines (The mother of Eustace I of Boulogne d.\n\n1047).\n\n1.1.2.1.1.) Hugh II (c.1013-1052), Ct. of Ponthieu, m. Bertha, dau of\n\nGeurenfroi of Aumale.\n\n1.1.2.1.1.1.) Enguerrand II (c. 1033-1053), Ct. of Ponthieu. He married\n\nAdelaide, the daughter of Robert I of Normandy. She married 2ndly, Lambert\n\nof Lens, and this marriage should have been prohibited if Lambert and\n\nEnguerrand II share a common descent from Adelvie of Guines.\n\n1.1.2.1.1.1.1.) Adelaide, Countess of Aumale, and perhaps Judith.\n\n1.1.2.1.2.) Gui, Bishop of Amiens, ( c. 1014 - 1074/5) and presumably Ct. of\n\nPonthieu after the death of Enguerrand II in 1053, and believed author of\n\nthe ( _The Carmen de Hastingae Proelio of Guy Bishop of Amiens_, Frank\n\nBarlow, Oxford, 1999). He may have married Ade d'Amiens. [I am finding\n\nconflicting information on the identity of Guy, some name him son of Hugh\n\nII, and others Enguerrand I. The chronology of Guy, the Bishop of Amiens\n\nsupports Enguerrand I being his father; so if Hugh II had a son named Guy,\n\nCount of Ponthieu, then I believe we have two distinct Guy's of Ponthieu (no\n\npun intended).]\n\n1.1.2.1.3.) ?Beatrix married William of Arques, son of Richard II of\n\nNormandy. [This may be the daughter of Hugh II; instead of sister. I have\n\nplaced her here because I am following one of your old posts Todd from 2001\n\n[Message-ID: <3AADEB16...@interfold.com>].\n\nI would chart these lines out, but I'm afraid it would not get through as\n\nwritten; so I will leave it to your power to visualize these possible common\n\nlines.\n\nBest Wishes,\n\nPhil\n\n----- Original Message -----\n\nFrom: \"Todd A.
