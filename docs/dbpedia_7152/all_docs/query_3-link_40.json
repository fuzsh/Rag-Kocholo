I worked for a beginning producer in the late 90's, he wore a ring with a family crest on it & he said it was from his mother's side. I pressured him about his history & he was very secretive. We traveled a lot and I knew he had come from serious money. The most I could get out of him was that he had roots in France, he was Roman Catholic & his mother had died. He would be in his middle to late 40's today. I've searched & searched for his name & I can't find a thing. I don't think he used his \"real\" name although the name I knew him by is listed on IMDB. Just in case somebody reading this can think of something or will want a little more, I can say his first name (which is probably his true first name) is Michael. He divides his time between LA & NY. (And Europe?) Any ideas? TIA.\n\nSent from my iPhone using The Royals Community mobile app\n\nAre there any ancestors alive today?
