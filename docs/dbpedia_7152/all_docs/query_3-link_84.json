We are planning a trip to Fontevraud in the near future. St. Denis is fascinating, even including the desecration - the memorial where the bones were reinterred is one of the most moving places I've ever seen, really lingered there. But the mana of the royals still cling to those amazing tombs (there are royal/aristocratic tombs in the Louvre, too).\n\nHard to wrap my head around tomb desecration and that level of discontent with one's monarchs - but it happened, so people were indeed extremely unhappy with their government during the Revolution. (Beheading royals to make sure they did not rule again makes more sense, politically, than tomb desecration - although I suppose people were looting, right?)\n\nBoth practices (beheading, looting tombs) sound so...medieval, but not sure the Middle Ages had an event as bloody as the French Revolution. They sure had their share of mass executions in the Middle Ages, of course - but sheer population numbers weren't enough to compete with the late 18th century.\n\nLooting of royal tombs, though, is not unheard of - I just have to remember there are people who will do that sort of thing. I find it hard to call them persons.\n\nGrandduchess24\n\nSerene Highness\n\nJoined\n\nMar 17, 2011\n\nMessages\n\n1,313\n\nCity\n\nCambridge\n\nCountry\n\nUnited States\n\nThe french monarchy also had the tradition of keeping the heart of a king on display except the only one to not have his heart out was King Louis XV and even the son of King Louis XVI, Louis Charles the proclaimed Louis XVII heart in a Case like that of his ancestors, to me it's weird but it's their tradition.\n\nHere is the heart of Louis XVII\n\nAttachments\n\nimage-1609859480.png\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\nAn Ard Ri\n\nSuper Moderator\n\nJoined\n\nJun 30, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n43,311\n\nCity\n\nAn Iarmhí\n\nCountry\n\nIreland\n\nAren't some French royals buried in cathedrals like King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette whom are buried at the basilica St Denis where their statues kneel side by side in a prayer.\n\nMost French Monarchs & Consorts as well as other royal Prince & Princesses were originally buried at the Royal Abbey (now Basilca/Cathedral) of St. Denis outside Paris.\n\nIn 1793,following the abolition of the Monarchy the royal tombs at St Denis & other churches were desecrated by revolutionary mobs.Tombs were smashed,coffins broken open & plundered.Most of the royal remains were dragged from their coffins & dumped into a mass pit outside the Abbey.The remains of some Kings & Queens miraculously survived or escaped the attention of the revolutionaries (Louise of Lorraine,Clementia of Hungary,Isabelle de Hainaut & Philippe I of France).\n\nmdjay\n\nNewbie\n\nJoined\n\nFeb 21, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n1\n\nCity\n\nGaithersburg\n\nCountry\n\nUnited States\n\nSt Denis\n\nA few years ago when I visited St Denis, I noticed that there were three rooms in the crypt.

Does anyone know for certain why they would be in this room and to whom did they belong?\n\nYou're right. When Louis XVIII ascended the throne in 1815, he had the remains that had been dumped in the pit in 1793 brought back to the crypt and sealed behind the black walls with their names carved in them. The third room contains the caskets of Louis-Philippe d'Orléans' children and grandchildren.\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\nAn Ard Ri\n\nSuper Moderator\n\nJoined\n\nJun 30, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n43,311\n\nCity\n\nAn Iarmhí\n\nCountry\n\nIreland\n\nThat 3rd room also contains the coffins/remains of Louis XV 's daughters,the Princesses Marie Adélaïde de France and Victoire de France.Both of them escaped from France in 1791 and died in exile.Louis XVIII later had their remains brought back to France and buried in the Bourbon vault of St Denis.\n\nLeah2016\n\nCommoner\n\nJoined\n\nMay 28, 2012\n\nMessages\n\n19\n\nCity\n\nUSA\n\nCountry\n\nUnited States\n\nThe french monarchy also had the tradition of keeping the heart of a king on display except the only one to not have his heart out was King Louis XV and even the son of King Louis XVI, Louis Charles the proclaimed Louis XVII heart in a Case like that of his ancestors, to me it's weird but it's their tradition.\n\nHere is the heart of Louis XVII\n\nDid all the French monarchs have their hearts preserved?\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\nAn Ard Ri\n\nSuper Moderator\n\nJoined\n\nJun 30, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n43,311\n\nCity\n\nAn Iarmhí\n\nCountry\n\nIreland\n\nDid all the French monarchs have their hearts preserved?\n\nThe majority of French King and Queen's remains were buried at Saint Denis outside Paris,whilst their hearts and entrails were buried at another Abbey or Church with a separate monument.\n\nExample : Heart Monument of Henri II of France,commissioned in 1561 by his widow,Queen-Regent of France Catherine de Médicis.It was originally housed at the now destroyed l'église des Célestins de Paris.\n\nhttp://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQ2J0-2N327wP38QU8tZoyFclmwTomM_Uq-KxJegqT8AUIs3Fy9\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\nAn Ard Ri\n\nSuper Moderator\n\nJoined\n\nJun 30, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n43,311\n\nCity\n\nAn Iarmhí\n\nCountry\n\nIreland\n\nCharles IV King of France/Charles I King of Navarre (3 January 1322 – 1 February 1328)\n\nBuried at Saint Denis Basilica outside Paris\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\nAn Ard Ri\n\nSuper Moderator\n\nJoined\n\nJun 30, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n43,311\n\nCity\n\nAn Iarmhí\n\nCountry\n\nIreland\n\nPhilippe VI,King of France and Count of Anjou, Maine, and Valois (1 April 1328 – 22 August 1350).\n\nBuried at Saint Denis Basilica outside Paris\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\nAn Ard Ri\n\nSuper Moderator\n\nJoined\n\nJun 30, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n43,311\n\nCity\n\nAn Iarmhí\n\nCountry\n\nIreland\n\nJean II,King of France and Count of Auvergne and Boulogne (22 August 1350 – 8 April 1364).\n\nBuried at Saint Denis Basilica outside Paris\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\nAn Ard Ri\n\nSuper Moderator\n\nJoined\n\nJun 30, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n43,311\n\nCity\n\nAn Iarmhí\n\nCountry\n\nIreland\n\nCharles V,King of France (8 April 1364 – 16 September 1380).\n\nBuried at Saint Denis Basilica outside Paris\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\nAn Ard Ri\n\nSuper Moderator\n\nJoined\n\nJun 30, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n43,311\n\nCity\n\nAn Iarmhí\n\nCountry\n\nIreland\n\nCharles VI,King of France (16 September 1380 – 21 October 1422)\n\nBuried at Saint Denis Basilica outside Paris\n\nTomb of Charles VI of France.\n\nLast edited: Jul 2, 2012\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\nAn Ard Ri\n\nSuper Moderator\n\nJoined\n\nJun 30, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n43,311\n\nCity\n\nAn Iarmhí\n\nCountry\n\nIreland\n\nCharles VII,King of France (21 October 1422 – 22 July 1461)\n\nCharles was buried at Saint Denis Basilica outside Paris,however his tomb was ransacked and destroyed in August 1793 during the French Revolution.\n\nNow lost tomb of Charles VII and Marie d'Anjou.\n\nOP\n\nOP\n\nAn Ard Ri\n\nSuper Moderator\n\nJoined\n\nJun 30, 2009\n\nMessages\n\n43,311\n\nCity\n\nAn Iarmhí\n\nCountry\n\nIreland\n\nLouis XI,King of France (22 July 1461 - 30 August 1483)\n\nUnlike other French Monarchs and Consorts,Louis XI was not buried at Saint Denis.He was buried at the Basilique Notre-Dame de Cléry-Saint-André near Orléans.His tomb suffered damaged in 1562 when the church was sacked by the Huguenots and again during the French Revolution."
