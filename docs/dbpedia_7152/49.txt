Biography

Name

Alice of Normandy, Countess consort of Burgundy [1]

Adelais "Judith" [2]

Alice or Adeliza, Adelaide or Aelis [3]

Disambiguation: Judith

Judith -- "Iudid comitisse" is assumed in traditional genealogies to have been the same person as Adelais. [2] Judith appears in some genealogies, without further citation, as born in Normandy April 22, 1003.

Cawley suggests that Judith, rather than being an alternate named for Adelaide, may be the name of a later wife of Comte Renaud.[2]

"Raginaldus comes comitis Guillelmi filius" donated property to the abbey of Flavigny by charter dated 18 May 1037 subscribed by "Iudid comitisse uxoris eius, Guillelmi filii eius, Hugonis filii eius…" [2]

1000 Birth

Guillaume of Jumièges names “Adeliz” as the first daughter of “dux Richardus” and his wife. [2]

Estimates of her birth year differ. Cawley estimates her birth about 1000, placing Adelaide as the first child; [2]

Other sources suggest a birth year of 1002. [3]

She was the daughter of Richard II, Duke of Normandy (972–1026) and Judith of Brittany. [3]

1016 Marriage

Adélaide married Renaud I [4] or Reginald I, Count of Burgundy [5]

Cawley states that the marriage to Renaud I de Mâcon, Comte de Bougogne (990 - 03/04 Sep 1057) took place before 01 Sep 1016. Renaud's parents were Othon Guillaume, Come de Mâcon and Ermentrude de Roucy ([990]-3/4 Sep 1057, bur Besançon). [2]

Adelaide married (before 1 Sep 1016) [as his first wife,] RENAUD de Mâcon, son of OTHON GUILLAUME Comte de Mâcon [Bourgogne-Comté] & his first wife Ermentrude de Roucy ([990]-3/4 Sep 1057, bur Besançon). [2] Renaud succeeded his father in 1026 as RENAUD I Comte de Bourgogne. [2]

Issue

Adélaide and Renaud had the following children.

Guillaume or William I, Count of Burgundy [1]

Gui de Brionne or Guy of Burgundy (c. 1025–1069), educated at the court of Normandy, who would lead a revolt for control of the Duchy of Normandy against his cousin William of Normandy (later William the Conqueror). He had to leave his county of Brionne and Vernon in Normandy, after being at the head of the coalition of the barons of Normandy, which was defeated at the Battle of Val-ès-Dunes in 1047. Guy found refuge with his uncle Geoffrey II, Count of Anjou. He later attempted to take over the county of Burgundy from his brother William.[1]

Hugh (c. 1037 – c. 1086), Viscount of Lons-le-Saunier, sire Montmorot, Navilly and Scey married to Aldeberge Scey. They had a son Montmorot Thibert, founder of the house Montmorot (or Montmoret).[1]
