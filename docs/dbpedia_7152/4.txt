From the Wikipedia page on Adelaide, Countess of Vermandois:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide,_Countess_of_Vermandois

Adelaide of Vermandois (1062 - 1122) was suo jure Countess of Vermandois and Valois and the last member of the Carolingian dynasty.

Adelaide was the daughter of Herbert IV, Count of Vermandois, and Alice, Countess of Valois. Her younger brother Odo became Count of Vermandois upon their father's death in 1080. However, five years later, he was disinherited by the council of Barons of France because of his mental illness. Thus, Adelaide and her husband succeeded to the Counties of Vermandois and Valois.

Adelaide married firstly Hugh Magnus, son of King Henry I of France. By this marriage she had nine children:

1. Matilda(1080-1130), married Ralph I of Beaugency

2. Beatrice (1082-after1144), married Hugh III of Gournay

3. Ralph I (1085-1152)

4. Elizabeth of Vermandois, Countess of Leicester (1085-1131)

5. Constance (1086-??), married Godfrey de la Ferté-Gaucher

6. Agnes (1090-1125), married Boniface of Savone

7. Henry (1091-1130), Lord of Chaumont en Vexin

8. Simon (1093-1148)

9. William, possibly married to Isabella, illegitimate daughter of King Louis VI of France

In 1104, she married secondly Renaud II, Count of Clermont. By this marriage she had one daughter, Margaret, who married Charles I, Count of Flanders.

In 1102, Adelaide was succeeded by her son, Ralph I. Adelaide died in 1122 and the Carolingian dynasty died out with her.

From Medlands (by the Foundation for Medieval Genealogy):

http://fmg.ac/Projects/MedLands/CENTRAL%20FRANCE.htm#ThibautIIIdied1089B

THIBAUT de Blois, son of EUDES II Comte de Blois & his second wife Ermengarde d'Auvergne ([1010]-29/30 Sep 1089, bur Epernay). The Liber Modernorum Regum Francorum names "Tetbaudus et Stephanus" as the two sons of Comte Eudes, specifying that Thibaut succeeded in "Carnotensem et Turonensem"[131]. The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines names "Theobaldi filii Odonis Campaniensis" when recording that he lost Tours in 1041[132]. "Odo comes filius [Odonis comitis]" confirmed a donation of his father by charter dated to [1032/37], subscribed by "Tetbaldi filii eius, matris eius Ermengardis…Hervei vicecomitis"[133]. He succeeded his father in 1037 as THIBAUT III Comte de Blois, de Chartres, de Châteaudun, de Meaux, de Sancerre et de Troyes. He lost Beauvais some time after 1037. Guillaume de Jumièges records that "comte Thibaut" was captured by Geoffroy Comte d'Anjou who extorted the town of Tours from him by force[134]. The Chronica Rainaldi records that "Tetbaldus, filius Odonis comitis" was captured by "Goffrido comite Andecavorum" in 1044 after which the city of Tours surrendered[135]. The necrology of Saint-Père-en-Vallée records the death "II Kal Oct" of "Tebaldus comes Carnotensium"[136]. The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines records that "comes Theobaldus [filius Odonis]" was buried "apud Spernacum"[137].

m firstly (repudiated 1048) as her first husband, GERSENDE du Maine, daughter of HERIBERT [I] "Euigilans Canis/Eveille-chien" Comte du Maine & his wife ---([1025/35]-). The Actus pontificum Cenomannis records that "Atho marchisius" left Maine in the hands of "Gaufridi de Meduana", also naming "uxor eiusdem marchisii Garcendis…filia Herberti Cenomannorum…comitis…Evigila Canem" and specifying that she had married firstly "Theobaldo duci Campanie" and that he had repudiated her[138]. She married secondly as his second wife, Alberto Azzo II d'Este. Her second marriage is also mentioned by Orderic Vitalis, who incorrectly says that she was the daughter of Comte Hugues IV[139].

[m secondly ([1050/55]) GUNDRADA, daughter of --- (-[1055/60]). Her marriage is confirmed by the charter dated 1089 under which “Stephanus comes” donated property to the abbey of Pontlevoy, for the souls of “Theobaldi comitis patris mei et matris meæ Gundreæ…”[140]. It is assumed that she died soon after giving birth to her son. Another possibility is that “Gundreæ” in this charter is in fact a distorted transcription of “Gersendæ”, the name of Thibaut´s known first wife. This cannot be verified unless another charter emerges which names the mother of Comte Etienne.]

m [secondly/thirdly] (before 1061) ADELA [Alix] de Valois, daughter of RAOUL de Crépy Comte du Vexin et de Valois & his first wife Aelis de Bar-sur-Aube (-12 May [1093/1100], bur Saint-Faron). The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines names "Alaydis soror sancti Symonis" as wife of "comiti Campanie Theobaldo" but confuses her with her niece Adelais, daughter of Héribert [IV] Comte de Vermandois, saying that she married "Hugoni fratri regis Philippi" after the death of her husband[141]. "Teobaudus comes palatinus…cum mulierum Adelaide" donated property to Montiérender by charter dated [1077/81] which names "bone memorie predecessorum…patris sui Odonis comitis et Heriberto cognomento senioris…comes Rodulfus predecessor suus et propinquus"[142], the latter presumably referring to the father-in-law of Comte Thibaut III. "Adeladis comitisse" subscribed the donation to Cluny by "Rotrocus castri Mauritanie comes atque Dunensis castri vicecomes" dated 11 Jan 1078, immediately after "Tetbaldi comitis, Stephani comitis"[143], it being assumed that she was the wife of the former not the latter. The necrology of Saint-Loup, Troyes records the death "XII Mai" of "Aalais uxor Theobaudi comitis Campaniæ" and her burial "in monasterio Sancti Faronis"[144].

Comte Thibaut III & his [first/second] wife had one child:

1. ETIENNE [Henri] de Blois (-killed in battle Ramleh 19 May 1102). The Liber Modernorum Regum Francorum names (in order) "Stephanus et Hugo" as sons of "comes Tetbaudus", specifying that Etienne "factus est Blesensium Carnotensium atque Meldensium comes" on their father's death[145]. “Stephanus comes” donated property to the abbey of Pontlevoy, for the souls of “Theobaldi comitis patris mei et matris meæ Gundreæ…” by charter dated 1089[146]. As noted above, it is possible that “Gundreæ” in this charter is in fact a distorted transcription of “Gersendæ”, the name of Thibaut´s known first wife. This cannot be verified unless another charter emerges which names the mother of Comte Etienne. He succeeded his father in 1089 as ETIENNE Comte de Blois, de Chartres, de Châteaudun, de Sancerre et de Meaux. Comte Thibaut III & his [third] wife had three children.

2. EUDES de Blois (-1093). The Genealogica ex Stirpe Sancti Arnulfi names (in order) "Stephanum, Othonem, Hugonem fratres comites" as sons of "Theobaldus comes"[147]. Brother of Comte Etienne according to Orderic Vitalis[148]. The fact that he was the son of his father's third marriage is confirmed by "Odonis filius eius" subscribing the donation to Cluny by "Rotrocus castri Mauritanie comes atque Dunensis castri vicecomes" dated 11 Jan 1078, immediately after "Adeladis comitisse"[149]. He succeeded as EUDES IV Comte de Troyes. "Hugo comes Campanie Teotbaldi comitis filius" donated property to the abbey of Molesme by charter dated 2 Apr 1104, which names "frater meus Odo comes…"[150]. [m BERTHE, daughter of ---. "Berte comitisse" subscribed the donation to Cluny by "Rotrocus castri Mauritanie comes atque Dunensis castri vicecomes" dated 11 Jan 1078, immediately after "Odonis filius eius [Adeladis]"[151]. There is no proof that Berthe was the wife of Eudes, although the proximity of the two names in the list of subscribers suggests that this may be the case. Eudes is not described as "comes" in the charter, but it is possible that this was an oversight as his half-brother Etienne was accorded the title. No other contemporary "Berte comitisse" has so far been identified. Neither has any other reference to any wife of Eudes been found.]

3. PHILIPPE de Blois (-1100). The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines names (in order) "Philippum episcopum Cathalauensem et Hugonem Campanie comitem" as the two sons of "comiti Campanie Theobaldo" and his wife Adela[152]. Bishop of Chalon-sur-Marne 1093. "Hugo…comes Trecasinus cum Philippo fratre meo Catalaunensium episcopo" renounced rights over the village of Rouilly-Saint-Loup by charter dated [1100 or before] which names "patrem meum Theobaudum comitem"[153].

4. HUGUES de Blois (-Palestine 14 Jun 1126). The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines names (in order) "Philippum episcopum Cathalauensem et Hugonem Campanie comitem" as the two sons of "comiti Campanie Theobaldo" and his wife Adela[154]. The Liber Modernorum Regum Francorum names (in order) "Stephanus et Hugo" sons of "comes Tetbaudus", specifying that Hugues "factus est …Trecassinorum comes" on their father's death[155]. Brother of Comte Etienne according to Orderic Vitalis[156]. He succeeded his brother in 1093 as Comte de Troyes.
