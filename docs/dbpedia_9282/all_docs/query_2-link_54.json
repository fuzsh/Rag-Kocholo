Just as The Laura once forged intrepidly ahead, navigating waters once thought impassable, our hotel will help to take Downtown Houston into a brave new future filled with culinary excellence, inspiring creativity, and opportunities for both business and pleasure too numerous to count.\n\nAt Hull&Oak, cuisine from around the corner and around the world is equally at home. Texas is a melting pot, and here its far-flung flavors are highlighted in unique dishes suiting all tastes. Meanwhile, The Laura Bar pairs fresh ingredients and the finest liquors to create libations more likely to be remembered than to simply help one forget."
