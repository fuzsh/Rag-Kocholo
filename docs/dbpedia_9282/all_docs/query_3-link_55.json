        "text": "Our Houston office is our fastest growing office since being established in 2001. What started as three attorneys has grown to more than 75, and what began as an extension of the firmâ€™s well recognized insurance practice now includes legal excellence in a diverse field of practices. The Houston office handles a wide variety of litigation and non-litigation matters at the trial and appellate level across the state and nationwide including claims and lawsuits involving insurance coverage, product liability, transportation, construction defects, legal malpractice, labor and employment, natural disasters, maritime, and commercial disputes.\n\nWhile it has built a reputation as a Texas insurance powerhouse, Thompson Coe has broadened its offerings to meet the complex business litigation needs of its Fortune 500 clients. Building on the vision of its founding partners, Thompson Coe continues to meet the demands of the ever-changing legal landscape."
