        "text": "On December 27, 1839, Austin was founded as the capital of the Republic of Texas, which existed from 1836 to 1846, the year the Lone Star State came to be. From the national capital to the seat of state government, Austin was born to lead Texas. One way to understand Austin's history as a capital (the city of government) is through its Capitol (the building in which the government meets). There have been three Capitols in Austin, discussed below. Find Library resources on Texas Capitols and capitals."
