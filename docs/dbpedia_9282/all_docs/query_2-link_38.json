        "text": "Houston's high concentration of energy expertise and experience has meant a large number of relocations to the Houston region in recent decades. The region offers access to 3 million workers and more engineers than any other U.S. metro. With more than 600 exploration and production firms, 1,100 oilfield service companies and more than 180 pipeline transportation establishments, Houston truly is the Energy Capital of the World.\n\nAdditionally, new energy technologies such as hydraulic fracturing and deep-water offshore technology began or are centered in Houston. On top of this, Houston's petrochemical sector is experiencing record level growth with $50 billion in dollars of facility construction underway.\n\nAs the brain trust of the global energy industry, Houston’s ecosystem offers a competitive advantage to energy companies working in solar, wind, biomass and other renewables activities. The region has a growing base of solar energy sources and is home to more than 100 solar related companies.\n\nTexas and Houston are well-positioned as leaders in developing large scale renewable energy projects in both wind and solar. The state continues to pave the way by leading the nation in installed wind capacity.\n\nAs Houston continues to leverage its unique strengths with expertise, talent, and ability to scale, the region is creating an environment that naturally fosters emerging digital technology companies and their R&D work.\n\nAt least 21 of the Houston’s 40 corporate R&D centers are focused on energy technology and innovation. You can find a healthy mix of innovative startups to experienced and evolved tech companies focusing on a range of activity, including blockchain, data analytics and AI.\n\nEnergy startups represent 15% of Houston’s digital tech startups, employing more than 2,000 tech-savvy entrepreneurs and professionals.\n\nThe Greater Houston Partnership is dedicated to strengthening Houston’s position as the Energy Capital of the World. The economic vitality and growth of our region’s economy is inextricably tied to the energy industry, and the industry is changing rapidly. In 2020, the Partnership prioritized efforts that will position Houston to lead the global energy transition to a more efficient and sustainable, low-carbon future and to accommodate global demand growth. In summer 2021, the organization released a strategy for how Houston can leverage its energy leadership to accelerate global solutions for an energy-abundant, low-carbon future and launched the Houston Energy Transition Initiative (HETI).\n\nThe Greater Houston Partnership's Energy Committee works together to spur and support the regional growth and development of the greater Houston region's Energy Industry. The committee's 90+ members aim to harness Houston's industry leadership in accelerating sustainable solutions for an energy-abundant, low-carbon future.\n\nContact Sara Muhammad Malik to learn more."
