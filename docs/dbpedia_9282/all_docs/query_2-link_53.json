        "text": "Capital IDEA Houston was born out of the political will and organizing efforts of The Metropolitan Organization (TMO). TMO is a part of a larger network of organizations known as the Industrial Areas Foundation (IAF), a nationwide network of broad-based organizations building power to revitalize our democracy for constructive social and economic change. In 2008, TMO launched a workforce strategy to create a Labor Market Intermediary organization that would provide education opportunities leading to living wage employment for the Greater Houston residents; this is how Capital IDEA Houston was started.\n\nSince sponsoring our first fully funded cohort in 2010, Capital IDEA Houston has acted as a bridge connecting committed, yet underemployed adults to employers in need of highly skilled workers. Capital IDEA Houston serves lower-income earning individuals ages 18 and up, and are trapped in the secondary labor market.\n\nCapital IDEA Houston became an independent 501(C)(3) non-profit in 2015, and since then, we have been consistently recognized by the Houston community, including former Mayor Anise Parker, whose support helped us launch our short-term vocational training program with City of Houston General Funds.\n\nThe pride and joy seen across all of our more than 1000+ graduates and their families is a testament to the power Capital IDEA Houston has to affect change in our local community. Funded by national entities such as the NBA Foundation, ECMC, Bank of America, and city, county, and state governments, we push for innovation in the workforce sector. Our transformative work gives hope to communities who have historically been passed over by large structures of power. We make real change happen right here, right now. That is our vision. That is our justice work."
