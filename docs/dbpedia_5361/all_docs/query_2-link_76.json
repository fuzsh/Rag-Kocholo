Russian names for babies are no exception, and the cultural significance of each name begins with the organization of an individual's designation.\n\nFirst, Middle, and Last Names\n\nNaming traditions in Russia include three names for each individual: a first name, patronymic (middle) name, and a surname. The surname is handed down from one generation to the next, as are the surnames in many other cultures. The first name is referred to as the baby's given name. However, the patronymic name is a derivative of the father's first name.\n\nRussian First Names\n\nParents name their babies soon after birth. Russian law allows children to change their first names when they have reached maturity. Russian first names have different forms that are used during various situations.\n\nThe full form is formal and is appropriate for official documents.\n\nThe short form is familiar and used by family and close friends.\n\nThe affectionate form is typically used by grandparents and parents.\n\nThe rude form is an uncouth derivative of the name.\n\nPatronymic or Middle Russian Names for Girls\n\nThe Russian middle names for a girl are unique. Why? Because Russia uses patronymic names. As the name suggests, patronymic names are derivatives of the father's name. Parents add 'evna' or 'ovna' to their daughter's name to create the middle name from her father's first name.\n\nMikhail - Mikhailevna or Mikhailovna\n\nIvan - Ivanevna or Ivanovna\n\nVladimir - Vladimirevna or Vladimirovna\n\nOleg - Olegevna or Olegovna\n\nAleksandr - Aleksandrevna or Aleksandrovna\n\nThe Perfect Russian Name\n\nRussians use the first and patronymic names in formal situations. For example, a niece would address her aunt using the name combination. Whether you just like old Russian female names or you want to pay homage to your ancestry, you have a lot of choices when it comes to Russian names for girls. Now the hard part is selecting the perfect, unique Russian name for your daughter.\n\n© 2024 LoveToKnow Media. All rights reserved."
