        "text": "​\n\nShe was a fashion designer… Originally, Marie thought designing would be very\n\ncreative. But she found out that above all, it's a business, and a pretty hectic, cold-\n\nblooded one at that. She made a lot of money, but her work wasn't particularly\n\nappreciated. Now, …she rarely even sketches or draws any more. She does all her own\n\nsewing... and makes all her clothes. They're terrific -- people are always coming up to\n\nher and asking where she bought this or that. But she'd never be tempted to go back to\n\nthe grind of turning designs out for money. ...Being a designer, she has wonderful color\n\nsense and a flair for drama.\n\n​\n\n~ Jack Lord (i)\n\n​\n\n​\n\n~ ~ ~ ~ ~\n\n​\n\n​\n\nMarie was born on August 16, 1905, in St. Louis, Missouri, to Gennaro Cepparulo (born in 1871 in Italy) and Elsie DeNarde Cepparulo (born in 1883 in Italy). She had two brothers, Silvius Andrew, born in 1902, and Alfred Florian, born in 1907. All three were born in St. Louis, Missouri.\n\n​\n\nGennaro Cepparulo manufactured artificial flowers for floral arrangements, millinery, weddings, and other uses. He received his first training at the age of six from his father and grandfather in Italy and worked in their factory after school.(1) Both he and Mrs. Cepparulo emigrated to the United States.\n\n​\n\nAfter moving to St. Louis, Mr. Cepparulo continued to ply his trade and soon earned favor with jobbing houses and department stores. In 1908, his plant was located at 26, 27 Washington Avenue. That year, he took a trip to New York to purchase materials and to research flower novelties for that fall’s fashions. The growth of his business required him to move to larger facilities several times through the years.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nIn 1923, Marie graduated from high school and sailed to France to study fashion design and art. In 1925, her mother took her brother, Florian, and moved to Cleveland, Ohio, to live with her parents in their home at 10723 Orville Avenue.(2) It is unclear what happened between Elsie and Gennaro Cepparulo to warrant the move. Silvius Andrew either remained in or returned to St. Louis, where he worked with his father. Both brothers changed their surname to DeNarde.(3)\n\n​\n\nIn the summer of 1927, Marie completed her studies in France and returned home, sailing to New York from Boulogne sur Mer, France.(4) Upon her arrival, she changed her name legally from Cepparulo to DeNarde.(5) Later that year, she moved to 145 East 49th Street in New York City and went to work as a fashion designer on Seventh Avenue.\n\nOn September 28, 1928, Mr. Cepparulo succumbed to double pneumonia aggravated by a pre-existing heart condition.(6) He is buried in the Calvary Cemetery, a Roman Catholic cemetery that dates to 1854.(7)\n\nUpon his father's death, Silvius Andrew took over leadership of Cepparulo Manufacturing Company. His leadership was short-lived, for a year later, the stock market collapsed, marking the start of the Great Depression. Over the ensuing three years, the demand for flowers dropped off, and Cepparulo Manufacturing lost much of its clientele.\n\nOn January 7, 1938, Elsie DeNarde passed away of unspecified cause.(8)\n\nIt is interesting to note that the 1940 census report shows Marie was living in Paris, France in 1935. Twice before the outbreak of World War II, Marie sailed to Havana, Cuba.(9) In those pre-Castro years, Havana was the “in” place for successful people to vacation, much like Honolulu came to be. At this point, Marie lived at 212 East 48th Street in New York City, where, she would continue to live until she and Jack moved to California in 1957.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the Columbia University Catalogue (1943/1944 and 1944/1945) shows Marie's name and her East 48th Street address in its Directory of Students. It does not tell what she studied.\n\n​\n\nJack and Marie were married on January 17, 1949. He was studying acting and trying to break into the profession. Until Jack became established in the field, Marie continued to work. Then, following both the lessons of her upbringing and the traditions of her day, she gave up her career. When people seemed unable to understand her decision, she would tell them that many wives did the same thing and that what made her experience unique was that Jack showed appreciation for all that she did for him. Marie fully encouraged him in the pursuit of his dream and served as his stabilizing force. She taught him to control his temper, managed his business affairs, and kept home a warm and inviting place to come after a tedious day at work.\n\n​\n\nMarie was an excellent cook. Although she claimed Frank Sinatra taught her how to cook, it seems more likely that she learned the art through her traditional upbringing. Jack once said that Marie kept large files of recipes, some being different ways of preparing the same dish, and that she made the best matzo ball soup he’d ever tasted. Some sources say Marie made the best cacciatore in the islands, while others say that Jack did.\n\nMarie liked a well-ordered kitchen, yet one that was not bland or sterile. Her kitchen in Honolulu had pumpkin-colored cabinets. She had a stainless steel cart on which she placed dinner to be rolled into the dining room. Similarly, Marie enjoyed planning dinner parties. Contrary to rumor, Jack and Marie entertained. They preferred small, intimate gatherings of their closest friends.\n\nLife really does play games with people. Today, Jack and I have everything we’ve been\n\nstriving for... Yet nothing is ever perfect. In the old days, Jack and I would dream\n\nabout someday reaching this point. Back then, we were convinced that if things went\n\nwell all our problems would suddenly disappear. Well, let me assure you, it never quite\n\nhappens that way. The hardest thing to be is a success! ...the truth is, when success\n\ncomes, the irritations don’t go away–they multiply. The higher you go the bigger the\n\nproblems become ... and, along the way, you acquire a whole new set of problems as well.\n\n​\n\n~ Marie Lord (10)\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nWhat was Marie like as a person?\n\nShe was stylish. Wayne Harada of the Honolulu Advertiser wrote, “Always with a hat on. Always immaculately dressed. Always stylish... She had a fashion model’s aura, her 19-inch waist was legendary as her thing about her hair – which she almost never displayed in public, concealed beneath wide-brimmed or furry hats. It was an event of note when she let her hair down after a poolside visit at the old Kuilima resort (now Turtle Bay).\"(11)\n\nShe was gracious. As James MacArthur said, “…Marie was always…very pleasant to everyone. Marie was a nice lady.”(12) Jimmy Borges echoed this when he called Marie “a wonderful, sweet, giving lady.”(13) Jim Nabors said, “Marie was a very lovely, beautiful lady...”(14) Alicia Antonio said, “When they came in to dinner [at the Maile Room at the Kahala Hilton], they were both very particular about certain things; they had their favorite wine, and they always started their meals with fresh fruit” and “…she was always gracious.”(15) For years after Jack’s death, MacArthur and others took Marie to lunch at the Kahala.(16)\n\nShe was strong. As Tim Ryan wrote in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin, “Marie was ‘described by friends as the classic strong woman behind the successful [man].’”(17) Alicia Antonio said, “She was very protective of Jack.”(18) James MacArthur took it a step further when he said that nothing and no one prevented her from looking after Jack.(19) Eddie Sherman took it still further when he called Marie “the rock behind Jack Lord.”(20) Wayne Harada gave a good example when he wrote, “[Marie] once told The Advertiser that she had to fire domestic help because they were ‘selling’ information to tabloid reporters and paparazzi who were intent on getting details of their lives.”(21)\n\nShe was a pragmatist. Although this is related to Marie being a strong person, it should be mentioned separately. Jack mentioned that Marie reminded him of something he said he had forgotten: “It’s not what happens in life – but how one responds to what happens that counts.”(22) Being reminded of that “served to direct [Jack's] thinking...”(23)\n\nShe was generous. Marie was very charitable. Wayne Harada wrote, “Few knew of Marie Lord’s charitable side. When the downtown Hawai‘i Theatre restoration project needed funds to erect the marquee after interior renovation, Marie Lord donated the money in Jack’s name. In her memory, the marquee lights were dimmed [the night she died].”(24)\n\nNote: Read more about the restoration and see pictures at\n\nhttp://www.hawaiiforvisitors.com/oahu/attractions/hawaii-theatre.htm.\n\nThe article mentions Marie's generous donation.\n\nJeannette Paulson Hereniko, founder of the Hawaii International Film Festival, said, “She was a very private person; both she and Jack were very supportive of the film festival at a time when many people were cynical; they gave money, time and support – which I’ll never forget.”(25)\n\nShe was sentimental. Marie said, the lack of children led her to “adopt and shower too much love on younger people.”(26) Tim Ryan wrote in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin, “[In their later years], she’s showering that affection on a cat, Kitty Boy” to which Marie said, “Jack really loves Kitty Boy…he just hugs him…”(27)\n\n​\n\nMarie's Fashion Sense\n\nIt is easy to have the impression that Marie's fashion sense was inspired at least in part by the French fashion designer, Coco Chanel. If any of Ms. Chanel's quotations best describe Marie's approach to fashion, it would have to be this: \"In order to be irreplaceable, one must be different.\"(28) Of course, the following quotation might describe Marie just as well: \"Simplicity is the keynote of all true elegance.\"(29) Ms. Chanel opened her first shop in 1910, when Marie was five years old. It is easy to imagine Marie following her career as she introduced the still best-selling perfume, Chanel No. 5, her ever popular tweed Chanel suit, and the timeless little black dress.\n\nOf course, Marie had her own, distinctive tastes. In the 1960s, she followed the trend of wearing a cloche. The feathery hats passed out of vogue and out of Marie's wardrobe. By the 1970s, she had moved toward large, wide-brimmed hats. Of course, she would in the hot Hawaiian sunshine.\n\nFrom the late-1960s and throughout the 1970s, Marie made the high mandarin collar her trademark and applied it to long, slim-fitting dresses. Marie designed and made many dresses of very similar design. All were based on the Japanese Cheongsam dress. Unlike the dresses of origin, which were either sleeveless or had cap sleeves, were fitted at the waist, and were street length, Marie's designs incorporated either fitted lines or a-line dresses with long sleeves. They reached to the floor. She adapted them for either formal or casual wear, depending on the color and quality of the fabric. She invariably wore hats with her dresses. It is interesting to note that Jack's tie was often color coordinated with Marie's dress.\n\nBy the 1980s, Marie was opting for slacks with turtleneck pullovers and jackets. Always, her hats matched the jacket. You can see her in one of her latter-day ensembles in Emme Tommimbang's Emme's Island Moments / \"Memories of Hawaii Five-0\" at the end of the Season 1 DVDs. There, she is wearing black pullover, slacks, and shoes with a warm pink jacket and a matching wide-brimmed hat.\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nMarie's Culinary Talents\n\nIn Hawaii Five-0, McGarrett claimed to make the best lasagna and cacciatore in the Islands (\"My Friend, the Enemy,\" Season 10). In actual fact, the culinary expert was Marie! From her pumpkin-colored kitchen, she turned out meals from many countries around the world. She cooked French and Italian dishes, of course, but she also cooked Jewish food and Asian dishes and others. She claimed to have learned Italian cooking from Frank Sinatra. Marie became very health-food conscious over time. Less cacciatore came from her kitchen than did the low-fat offerings from Asia and even from papaya trees. The focus shifted from keeping Jack camera-ready to protecting his heart.\n\nEven though Marie was serious about cuisine, she said she did not like the cold, sterile kitchens usually associated with the culinary arts. Her kitchen in Kahala featured stainless steel appliances; cabinets the color of pumpkins; and a kappa shell vinyl floor. She kept potatoes in a wire basket, feeling that exposure improved the quality of potatoes. She had an aluminum cart on which she placed the serving platters and rolled the cart into the adjoining dining room to serve dinner.(30)\n\nMarie collects cookbooks and recipes. She has several file cabinets filled with recipes\n\nand all kinds of information about food. For example, she doesn't just have one\n\nrecipe for soufflé. She has dozens. And she'll have a whole section devoted only to egg\n\nwhites, for instance -- how to separate them, how to beat them and things to do with\n\nthem. She has a whole card catalog that she devised. The whole thing's perfectly\n\norganized. Once, I remember, I just happened to say something about matzo ball soup.\n\nBefore I knew it, Marie had boned up on the subject, read everything she could find on\n\nit, and we were eating the most fantastic matzo ball soup I'd ever tasted.\n\n~ Jack Lord (31)\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nMarie's Brother, Florian\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\nFlorian DeNarde in 1963\n\n(Brazil travel visa)\n\n​\n\n​\n\nIn 1965, Florian DeNarde sent a letter to Jack along with a book about A. J. Balaban, who with Sam Katz, owned a chain of theaters across the country. The chain was known as Balaban & Katz Theatres and was based in Chicago. A. J. Balaban and his wife, Carrie, worshipped in the same church as Florian DeNarde and his wife. All were Christian Scientists. The book was written by Carrie Balaban about her husband. It is interesting to note that Jack did not return Florian's book to him, as Florian requested in his letter . Rather, the book was sold on Ebay from Jack's estate auction. I wonder what Florian would have to say about that!"
