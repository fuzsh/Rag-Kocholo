        "text": "Imposing, barrel-chested and often silver-haired Brian Dennehy was a prolific US actor, well respected on both screen and stage over many decades. He was born in July 1938 in Bridgeport, CT, and attended Columbia University in New York City on a football scholarship. Brian majored in history, before moving on to Yale to study dramatic arts. He first appeared in minor screen roles in such fare as Auf der Suche nach Mr. Goodbar (1977), Zwei ausgebuffte Profis (1977) and Eine ganz krumme Tour (1978) and proved popular with casting directors, leading to regular work. However, he really got himself noticed by movie audiences in the box-office hit Rambo (1982) as the bigoted sheriff determined to run Vietnam veteran \"John Rambo\" (played by Sylvester Stallone) out of his town. Dennehy quickly escalated to stronger supporting or co-starring roles in films including the Cold War thriller Gorky Park (1983), as a benevolent alien in Cocoon (1985), a corrupt sheriff in the western Silverado (1985), a tough but smart cop in F/X - Tödliche Tricks (1986) and a cop-turned-writer alongside hit man James Woods in Bestseller (1987). In 1987, Dennehy turned in one of his finest performances as cancer-ridden architect \"Stourley Kracklite\" in Peter Greenaway's superb Der Bauch des Architekten (1987), for which he won the Best Actor Award at the 1987 Chicago Film Festival. More strong performances followed. He reprised prior roles for Cocoon II - Die Rückkehr (1988) and F/X 2 - Die tödliche Illusion (1991), and turned in gripping performances in three made-for-TV films: a sadistic small-town bully who gets his grisly comeuppance in Tag der Angst (1991), real-life serial killer John Wayne Gacy in the chilling Jagt den Killer (1992) and a corrupt union boss in Teamster Boss: The Jackie Presser Story (1992). In 1993, Dennehy appeared in the role of police \"Sgt. Jack Reed\" in the telemovie Jack Reed: Unter Mordverdacht (1993), and reprised the role in four sequels, which saw him for the first time become involved in co-producing, directing and writing screen productions! Demand for his services showed no signs of abating, and he put in further memorable performances in William Shakespeares Romeo & Julia (1996), as bad-luck-ridden \"Willy Loman\" in Death of a Salesman (2000) (which earned him a Golden Globe Award), he popped up in the uneven Spike Lee film She Hate Me (2004) and appears in the remake Das Ende - Assault on Precinct 13 (2005). The multi-talented Dennehy also had a rich theatrical career and appeared both in the United States and internationally in dynamic stage productions including \"Death of a Salesman\" (for which he picked up the 1999 Best Actor Tony Award and a Drama Desk Award), \"A Touch of the Poet\", \"Long Day's Journey into Night\" (for which he picked up another Tony Award in 2003) and in Eugene O'Neill's heart-wrenching \"The Iceman Cometh.\"\n\nA bold, blunt instrument of hatred and violence at the onset of his film career, Peter Boyle recoiled from that repugnant, politically incorrect \"working class\" image to eventually play gruff, gentler bears and even comedy monsters in a career that lasted four decades.\n\nHe was born on October 18, 1935, in Norristown, Pennsylvania, to Alice (Lewis) and Francis Xavier Boyle. He eventually moved to Philadelphia, where his father was a sought-after local TV personality and children's show host. His paternal grandparents were Irish immigrants, and his mother was of mostly French and British Isles descent. Following a solid Catholic upbringing (he attended a Catholic high school), Peter was a sensitive youth and joined the Christian Brothers religious order at one point while attending La Salle University in Philadelphia. He left the monastery after only a few years when he \"lost\" his calling.\n\nBent on an acting career, Boyle initially studied with guru Uta Hagen in New York. The tall (6' 2\"), hulking, prematurely bald actor wannabe struggled through a variety of odd jobs (postal worker, waiter, bouncer) while simultaneously building up his credits on stage and waiting for that first big break. Things started progressing for him after appearing in the national company of \"The Odd Couple\" in 1965 and landing TV commercials on the sly. In the late 60s he joined Chicago's Second City improv group and made his Broadway debut as a replacement for Peter Bonerz in Paul Sills' \"Story Theatre\" (1971) (Sills was the founder of Second City). Peter's breakout film role did not come without controversy as the hateful, hardhat-donning bigot-turned-murderer Joe - Rache für Amerika (1970) in a tense, violence-prone film directed by John G. Avildsen. The role led to major notoriety, however, and some daunting supporting parts in Tanja Baskin - Anruf genügt (1971), Schleuderpartie (1973) and as Robert Redford's calculating campaign manager in Bill McKay - Der Kandidat (1972). During this time his political radicalism found a visible platform after joining Jane Fonda and Donald Sutherland on anti-war crusades, which would include the anti-establishment picture Ganoven auf Abwegen (1973). This period also saw the forging of a strong friendship with former Beatle John Lennon.\n\nDestined to be cast as monstrous undesirables throughout much of his career, he played a monster of another sort in his early film days, and thus avoided a complete stereotype as a film abhorrent. His hilarious, sexually potent Frankenstein's Monster in the cult Mel Brooks spoof Frankenstein Junior (1974) saw him in a sympathetic and certainly more humorous vein. His creature's first public viewing, in which Boyle shares an adroit tap-dancing scene with \"creator\" Gene Wilder in full Fred Astaire regalia, was a show-stopping audience pleaser. Late 70s filmgoers continued to witness Boyle in seamy, urban settings with brutish roles in Taxi Driver (1976) and Hardcore - Ein Vater Sieht Rot (1979). At the same time he addressed several TV mini-movie roles with the same brilliant darkness such as his Senator Joe McCarthy in Tail Gunner Joe (1977), for which he received an Emmy nomination, and his murderous, knife-wielding Fatso in the miniseries remake of Verdammt in alle Ewigkeit (1979).\n\nWhile the following decade found Peter in predominantly less noteworthy filming and a short-lived TV series lead as remote cop Joe Bash (1986), the 90s brought him Emmy glory (for a guest episode on Akte X: Die unheimlichen Fälle des FBI (1993)). Despite a blood clot-induced stroke in 1990 that impaired his speech for six months, he ventured on and capped his enviable career on TV wielding funny but crass one-liners in the \"Archie Bunker\" mold on the long-running sitcom Alle lieben Raymond (1996). A major Emmy blunder had Boyle earning seven nominations for his Frank Barrone character without a win, the only prime player on the show unhonored. He survived a heart attack while on the set of \"Everybody Loves Raymond\" in 1999, but managed to return full time for the remainder of the series' run through 2005.\n\nFollowing a superb turn as Billy Bob Thornton's unrepentantly racist father in the sobering Oscar-winner Monster's Ball (2001), the remainder of his films were primarily situated in frivolous comedy fare such as Pluto Nash - Im Kampf gegen die Mondmafia (2002), Santa Clause 2 - Eine noch schönere Bescherung (2002), Scooby-Doo 2 - Die Monster sind los (2004), and Santa Clause 3 - Eine frostige Bescherung (2006), typically playing cranky curmudgeons. Boyle died of multiple myeloma (bone-marrow cancer) and heart disease at New York Presbyterian Hospital in 2006, and was survived by his wife Lorraine and two children. He was 71.\n\nStephen Root, one of today's most prolific character actors, is currently starring in HBO's hit series Barry, for which he received a Best Supporting Actor Emmy Nomination. Barry has been nominated for multiple Emmy's and Golden Globes, and has been renewed through season four. Stephen recently starred in Amazon's drama Uncle Frank (2020) and plays a role in the Michael Morris feature directorial debut To Leslie (2020).\n\nStephen starred opposite of Nicole Kidman in the Roger Ailes, Fox News sexual harassment scandal, Bombshell (2019). Stephen a pivotal role in the AFI Film Festival winner On the Basis Sex (2018), the Ruth Bader Ginsberg biopic and starred opposite Melissa McCarthy in the New Line hit comedy Life of the Party (2018). Stephen was also part of the talented ensemble in Netflix's The Ballad of Buster Scruggs (2018), reuniting with directors Joel & Ethan Coen. Stephen was part of Jordan Peele's box office hit Get Out (2017). Aside from his feature films, Stephen can be seen in his recurring role on HBO's drama Perry Mason (2020), also renewed for a second season, and Amazon's hit drama series The Man in the High Castle (2015).\n\nRoot has earned rave reviews for bringing a variety of characters to life in such films as O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000), Selma (2014), No Country for Old Men (2007), Leatherheads (2008), J. Edgar (2011), Cedar Rapids (2011), and Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story (2004). He was catapulted into the realm of cult hero when he starred as the put-upon Milton Waddams in Mike Judge's Office Space (1999). His animated features include Rango (2011), Finding Nemo (2003), Finding Dory (2016), Ice Age (2002) & Ice Age: The Melt Down (2006), and The Country Bears (2002).\n\nRoot starred as the eccentric station owner, Jimmy James, for five seasons on NBC's NewsRadio (1995-99). Stephen has also recurred on FX's Justified (2010), Boardwalk Empire (2010), Turn: Washington's Spies (2014), Idiotsitter (2016), True Blood (2008), 24 (2001), West Wing (1999) and Pushing Daisies (2007). His many memorable guest appearances include Veep (2012), Brooklyn Nine-Nine (2017), Big Bang Theory (2018), Angie Tribeca (2016), Fringe (2008), Raising Hope (2010), Children's Hospital (2010), CSI (2000), and Louie (2010).\n\nRoot was the voice of Bill Dauterieve and Mr. Strickland on FOX's Emmy-winning hit animated series King of the Hill (1997) for an impressive 13 seasons. He has also lent his voice to several animated series including Kevin Smith's revival of Masters of the Universe (2021), Amphibia (2019), BoJack Horseman (2019), Adventure Time (2010), Gravity Falls (2012), American Dad (2005), The Cleveland Show (2009), DreamWorks' Dragons: Riders of Berk (2012), Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness (2011), The X's (2005), and SyFy's Tripping the Rift (2004).\n\nBorn in Sarasota, Root received his initial training in the BFA program at the University of Florida and remains a die-hard Gators fan. After three years of touring the U.S. and Canada with the National Shakespeare Company, Root settled in New York, honing his craft in many regional theaters and starring off-Broadway in Journey's End and The Au Pair Man. His Broadway debut came in So Long on Lonely Street, which was followed by the Tony award-winning production of All My Sons, with Richard Kiley. A starring role as Boolie in the Broadway national touring company of Driving Miss Daisy with Julie Harris, brought Root to Los Angeles where he currently resides.\n\nGeorge Segal was born on February 13, 1934 in New York City, New York, to Fannie Blanche (Bodkin) and George Segal Sr., a malt and hop agent. All of his grandparents were Russian Jewish immigrants. After a stint in the military, he made his bones as a stage actor before being cast in his first meaty film role in Chefarzt Dr. Pearson (1961). His turns in Das Narrenschiff (1965) and the eponymous Sie nannten ihn King (1965) heralded the arrival of a major talent. He followed this up with his Oscar-nominated performance in Wer hat Angst vor Virginia Woolf? (1966), in which he more than held his own against Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. Wer hat Angst vor Virginia Woolf? (1966) was a cultural phenomenon, the film that wrecked the MPDDA censorship code that had been in place since 1934, and a huge box office success to boot.\n\nBy the early 1970s, appearances in such films as Die Eule und das Kätzchen (1970), Heirat ausgeschlossen (1973), Born to Win (1971) and Vier schräge Vögel (1972) had made him a major star with an enviable reputation, just under the heights of the superstar status enjoyed by the likes of Paul Newman. He followed up Mann, bist du Klasse! (1973) (a hit film for which his co-star Glenda Jackson won an Oscar) with his brilliant performance as the out-of-control gambler in Robert Altman's California Split (1974).\n\nAt one time in the early 1970s, it seemed like George Segal would have a career like that enjoyed by his contemporary Jack Nicholson, that of an actor's actor equally adept at comedy and drama. Segal never made the leap to superstar status, and surprisingly, has never won a major acting award, the latter phenomenon being particularly surprising when viewed from the period 1973-74, when he reached the height of his career. It was at this point that Segal's career went awry, when he priced himself as a superstar with a seven-figure salary, but failed to come through at the box office. For example, Die Jagd nach dem Malteser Falken (1975) was a failure, although his subsequent starring turn opposite Jane Fonda in Das Geld liegt auf der Straße (1977) was a big hit that revitalized her career.\n\nThe thriller Achterbahn (1977) became a modest hit even during a summer which saw it competing with Star Wars: Episode IV - Eine neue Hoffnung (1977), and he gave a adroit comic performance in Die Schlemmerorgie (1978) with Jacqueline Bisset and Robert Morley, which proved another box office success. For all practical purposes, even after the failures of Die Jagd nach dem Malteser Falken (1975), and Wer schluckt schon gerne blaue Bohnen? (1976), it seemed like Segal, with a few deft career choices, could reorient his career and deliver on the promise of his early period.\n\nAt the end of the decade, he dropped out of a movie that would have burnished his tarnished lustre as a star: Blake Edwards' 10 - Die Traumfrau (1979). 10 - Die Traumfrau (1979) made Dudley Moore a star, while Arthur - Kein Kind von Traurigkeit (1981) made him a superstar in the 1980s, a lost decade for Segal. It was an example of a career burnout usually associated with the \"Oscar curse\" (his Bizarre Morde (1968) co-star Rod Steiger, for example, was a great character actor whose career was run off the rails by the expectations raised by the Academy Award). George Segal has never won an Oscar, but more surprisingly, has only been nominated once, for Best Supporting Actor of 1966 for his role as Nick in Wer hat Angst vor Virginia Woolf? (1966).\n\nThat he didn't return to the promise of the early 1970s may be the unintended consequence of his focusing on comedy to the detriment of drama. The comedy Mann, bist du Klasse! (1973) made him a million dollar-per-film movie star, and that's what he concentrated on. Segal began relying on his considerable charm to pull off movies that had little going for them other than their star, and it backfired on him. These films weren't infused with the outrageously funny, subversive comedy of Wo is' Papa? (1970), a success from his first period that he enjoyed along with co-star Ruth Gordon and director Carl Reiner.\n\nWhen Segal first made it in the mid-1960s, he established his serious actor bona fides with a deal he cut with ABC-TV that featured him in TV adaptations of Broadway plays. He also played a very memorable Biff Loman in Death of a Salesman (1966), shining in performance in counterpoint to the vital presence that was Lee J. Cobb's Willy Loman. It was a good life for an actor, and he took time to show off his banjo-playing skills by fronting the Beverly Hills Unlisted Jazz Band, with which he cut several records.\n\nWhile the 1980s were mostly a career wasteland for Segal, with no starring roles in hit films, he remained a popular figure on television, and appeared regularly on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson (1962), where he would routinely sing and play the banjo during interviews. After a major role in the surprise hit Kuck' mal wer da spricht! (1989), he co-starred with Bette Midler and James Caan in For the Boys - Tage des Ruhms, Tage der Liebe (1991), leading to a career revival in the 1990s, using his flair for comedy as part of the ensemble cast of Just Shoot Me - Redaktion durchgeknipst (1997). In the 2010s, he co-starred as the eccentric but lovable grandfather on the hit sitcom Die Goldbergs (2013). On February 14, 2017, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for Television on his 83rd birthday. George Segal died at age 87 of complication from bypass surgery on March 23, 2021 in Santa Rosa, California.\n\nDanny Aiello was an American actor of Italian descent, and enjoyed a lengthy career in film. He was once nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, for his role as Salvatore \"Sal\" Frangione in the comedy-drama film \"Do the Right Thing\" (1989).\n\nAiello was born in Manhattan, New York City on June 20, 1933. His parents were laborer Daniel Louis Aiello and seamstress Frances Pietrocova. Frances eventually lost her eyesight, and became legally blind.. In response, Daniel abandoned his wife and six children. Danny resented his father's actions and would later refuse relations with him for decades. The two reconciled in 1993, when Danny was 60-years-old.\n\nIn 1940, Aiello moved to South Bronx. He was educated at James Monroe High School, located in the Soundview section of the Bronx. In 1949, Aiello dropped out of school and joined the United States Army. He was only 16-years-old, and lied about his age in order to enlist. Aiello served in the army for 3 years, and he was discharged in 1952. He returned to New York City, where he supported himself through various jobs.\n\nIn 1955, Aiello married Sandy Cohen. They had four children, including actor Danny Aiello III (1957-2010). In the 1960s, Aiello worked for Greyhound Lines, an intercity bus common carrier. He served as president of New York Local 1202 of the Amalgamated Transit Union, a labor organization representing the company's workers.\n\nIn 1967, Greyhound Lines changed its bus driver schedules, and Aiello led the workers to protest in a wildcat strike. The strike lasted for a single day. It lacked the authorization by the parent labor union, and Aiello was suspended for his actions.\n\nAiello eventually pursued an acting career, and started appearing in films during the early 1970s. His earliest credited role was playing baseball player Horse in the sports drama \"Bang the Drum Slowly\" (1973), at the age of 40. He worked alongside up-and-coming actor Robert De Niro (1943-), who gained acclaim for his performance in the film.\n\nAiello had a minor role as small-time gangster Tony Rosato in the crime film \"The Godfather Part II\" (1974). His one scene had him performing a hit on high-ranking gangster Francesco \"Frank\" Pentangeli (played by Michael V. Gazzo), who had betrayed the Corleone family. Aiello ad-libbed the line \"Michael Corleone says hello!\"\n\nAiello eventually had a co-lead role in the neo-noir \"Defiance\" (1980), as one of of several people who join forces against a powerful gang. Also in 1980, he played Dominic Ginetti in \"A Family Of Strangers\", an ABC Afterschool Special.

He played a corrupt police chief in the crime drama \"Once Upon a Time in America\" (1984), and the character was named after him as \"Vincent Aiello\". In this role, Aiello performer along Robert De Niro again, as De Niro was the film's lead actor.\n\nAiello performed in two films directed by Woody Allen (1935-). The first was the fantasy comedy \"The Purple Rose of Cairo\" (1985), where Aiello played the abusive husband Monk. The second was the comedy-drama \"Radio Days\" (1987).\n\nAiello gained a supporting role in the detective television series \"Lady Blue\" (1985-1986). He played police lieutenant Terry McNichols, a leading member of the Violent Crimes Division of the Chicago Police Department, and the boss of protagonist Katy Mahoney (played by Jamie Rose). McNichols was portrayed as a boss appreciative of Mahoney's unorthodox methods of investigation, but concerned by her overly violent behavior.\n\nThe series initially received high-ratings, but was considered as too violent for television. It attracted protests by watchdog organization, such as the National Coalition on Television Violence. When ratings fell, the series was canceled. The series lasted for a single season, and 14 episodes. Aiello would not gain a recurring television role again until the late 1990s.\n\nAiello played the protagonist's father in the video clip \"Papa Don't Preach\" (1986), based on a hit song by Madonna (1958-). He then recorded his own answer song, called , \"Papa Wants the Best for You\".\n\nIn 1987, Aiello played the protagonist's fiance Johnny Cammareri in the romantic comedy \"Moonstruck. It was a then-rare sympathetic role for him. His role was critically well-received.\n\nAiello gained his most acclaimed role when cast as pizzeria owner Salvatore \"Sal\" Fragione in the comedy-drama film \"Do the Right Thing\" (1989), concerning racial tensions in Brooklyn,. He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, but the award was won by rival actor Denzel Washington (1954-).

He played nightclub owner and assassin Jack Ruby (1911-1967) in the biographical film \"Ruby\" (1992). He played film director Harry Stone in the film \"The Pickle\", a satire of big-budget Hollywood films. He appeared dressed in drag in \"Prêt-à-Porter\", a satire of the fashion industry.\n\nHe next had the lead roe of Joe Lieberman in the award-winning short film \"Lieberman in Love\" (1995), and politician Frank Anselmo in the thriller \"City Hall\" (1996),\n\nAiello had a notable television role as crime lord Don Domenico Clericuzio in the mini-series \"The Last Don\" (1997), an adaptation of a 1996 crime novel by Mario Puzo. The series depicts Domenico as an aging mafia leader, who oversees plans for his succession. Aiello returned to the role in the sequel miniseries \"The Last Don II\", where Domenico dies and is succeeded by a much younger relative.\n\nAiello remained active as an actor through the 2000s and 2010s, although this period had few highlights for his career. He died in December 2019 at hospital, following a short illness. He was 86-years-old. His funeral was held at the Riverside Memorial Chapel on the Upper West Side. Director Spike Lee (1957-) delivered an eulogy at the funeral, remarking on his love for Aiello despite their political differences.\n\nMichael Parks is known as an actor's actor by his peers with a breadth of astonishing range that has allowed him to portray stunning contrasts--sometimes in the same film, like in Tusk (2014), starring in dual roles as an erudite serial killer opposite Justin Long, and as a feeble rube opposite Johnny Depp. In Kill Bill - Vol. 1 (2003) and Kill Bill: Vol. 2 (2004). Parks portrayed spot-on contrasting roles as Texas Ranger Earl McGraw and the heavily accented Esteban Vihaio opposite Uma Thurman. Writers/directors, including Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino, wrote roles specifically for Parks, claiming all they need to do is \"turn on the camera\" to elicit a masterful performance.\n\nParks has played in more than 100 films and TV shows over a 50-year career. He started as a contract player in 1961 with the portrayal of the nephew of the character George MacMichael on the ABC sitcom The Real McCoys (1957). He played Adam in John Huston's 1966 movie Die Bibel (1966). His other early roles includes appearances in two NBC series: Too Many Strangers (1962) as \"Larry Wilcox\" and as \"Dr. Mark Reynolds\" in Pressure Breakdown (1963). He also starred in Killing Cop (1990) and Blackout (1994), playing a police officer in both.\n\nFrom 1969-70 he starred in the series Then Came Bronson (1969), in which he was the only recurring character. He sang the theme song for the show, \"Long Lonesome Highway\", which became a #20 Billboard Hot 100 and #41 Hot Country Songs hit. Albums he recorded under MGM Records (the label of the studio which produced the series) include \"Closing The Gap\" (1969),\" Long Lonesome Highway\" (1970) and \"Blue\". He also had various records of songs included on these albums. He played Philip Colby during the second season (1986-87) of ABC's Der Denver-Clan (1981) spin-off series Die Colbys - Das Imperium (1985). He played the antagonist Irish mob boss Tommy O'Shea in Death Wish V: Antlitz des Todes (1994) (1994), French-Canadian drug runner Jean Renault in the ABC television series Das Geheimnis von Twin Peaks (1990), Dr. Banyard in Liar - Scharfe Täuschung (1997), Texas Ranger Earl McGraw in From Dusk Till Dawn (1996) and Ambrose Bierce in From Dusk Till Dawn 3: The Hangman's Daughter (1999). After playing Earl McGraw in the \"Kill Bill\" film series he reprised the role in both segments of the film Grindhouse (2007). In Red State (2011) as villain Abin Cooper, quoting the Bible and issuing homicidal directives in the same gently insinuating voice, Parks plays a disturbingly soft-spoken psycho making the talk all the more convincing and scary with his brilliant delivery affecting a folksy \"down-home\" accent , knowing just how to modulate his remarks for maximum effect; most reviewers agreed with \"Hollywood Reporter\" writer Todd McCarthy that he is mesmerizing as he spews Cooper's hate in a way that brooks no argument . In \"Tusk\" as Howard Howe, a real-life ancient mariner (a role Kevin Smith tailor-made for him), \"Parks has such light in his eyes, fire in his belly and a mellifluous purr in his voice\" that \"Variety\" wrote, \"it would probably be a pleasure to watch him recite the Manitoba phone book\".\n\nJack Warden was born John Warden Lebzelter, Jr. on September 18, 1920 in Newark, New Jersey, to Laura M. (Costello) and John Warden Lebzelter. His father was of German and Irish descent, and his mother was of Irish ancestry. Raised in Louisville, Kentucky, at the age of seventeen, young Jack Lebzelter was expelled from Louisville's DuPont Manual High School for repeatedly fighting. Good with his fists, he turned professional, boxing as a welterweight under the name \"Johnny Costello\", adopting his mother's maiden name. The purses were poor, so he soon left the ring and worked as a bouncer at a night club. He also worked as a lifeguard before signing up with the U.S. Navy in 1938. He served in China with the Yangtze River Patrol for the best part of his three-year hitch before joining the Merchant Marine in 1941.\n\nThough the Merchant Marine paid better than the Navy, Warden was dissatisfied with his life aboard ship on the long convoy runs and quit in 1942 in order to enlist in the U.S. Army. He became a paratrooper with the elite 101st Airborne Division, and missed the June 1944 invasion of Normandy due to a leg badly broken by landing on a fence during a nighttime practice jump shortly before D-Day. Many of his comrades lost their lives during the Normandy invasion, but the future Jack Warden was spared that ordeal. Recuperating from his injuries, he read a play by Clifford Odets given to him by a fellow soldier who was an actor in civilian life. He was so moved by the play, he decided to become an actor after the war. After recovering from his badly shattered leg, Warden saw action at the Battle of the Bulge, Nazi Germany's last major offensive. He was demobilized with the rank of sergeant and decided to pursue an acting career on the G.I. Bill. He moved to New York City to attend acting school, then joined the company of Theatre '47 in Dallas in 1947 as a professional actor, taking his middle name as his surname. This repertory company, run by Margo Jones, became famous in the 1940s and '50s for producing Tennessee Williams's plays. The experience gave him a valuable grounding in both classic and contemporary drama, and he shuttled between Texas and New York for five years as he was in demand as an actor. Warden made his television debut in 1948, though he continued to perform on stage (he appeared in a stage production in Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman (1966)). After several years in small, local productions, he made both his Broadway debut in the 1952 Broadway revival of Odets' \"Golden Boy\" and, three years later, originated the role of \"Marco\" in the original Broadway production of Miller's \"A View From the Bridge\". On film, he and fellow World War II veteran, Lee Marvin (Marine Corps, South Pacific), made their debut in You're in the Navy Now (1951) (a.k.a. \"U.S.S. Teakettle\"), uncredited, along with fellow vet Charles Bronson, then billed as \"Charles Buchinsky\".\n\nWith his athletic physique, he was routinely cast in bit parts as soldiers (including the sympathetic barracks-mate of Montgomery Clift and Frank Sinatra in the Oscar-winning Verdammt in alle Ewigkeit (1953). He played the coach on TV's Mister Peepers (1952) with Wally Cox.\n\nAside from Verdammt in alle Ewigkeit (1953) (The Best Picture Oscar winner for 1953), other famous roles in the 1950s included Juror #7 (a disinterested salesman who wants a quick conviction to get the trial over with) in Die zwölf Geschworenen (1957) - a film that proved to be his career breakthrough - the bigoted foreman in Ein Mann besiegt die Angst (1957) and one of the submariners commended by Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster in the World War II drama, U 23 - Tödliche Tiefen (1958). In 1959, Warden capped off the decade with a memorable appearance in Unwahrscheinliche Geschichten (1959) episode, The Lonely (1959), in the series premier year of 1959. As \"James Corry\", Warden created a sensitive portrayal of a convicted felon marooned on an asteroid, sentenced to serve a lifetime sentence, who falls in love with a robot. It was a character quite different from his role as Juror #7.\n\nIn the 1960s and early 70s, his most memorable work was on television, playing a detective in Asphaltdschungel (1961), The Wackiest Ship in the Army (1965) and Heiße Spuren (1967). He opened up the decade of the 1970s by winning an Emmy Award playing football coach \"George Halas\" in Freunde bis in den Tod (1971), the highly-rated and acclaimed TV movie based on Gale Sayers's memoir, \"I Am Third\". He appeared again as a detective in the TV series, Jigsaw John (1976), in the mid-1970s, Die Bären sind los (1979) and appeared in a pilot for a planned revival of Das blonde Gespenst (1937) in 1979.\n\nHis collaboration with Warren Beatty in two 1970s films brought him to the summit of his career as he displayed a flair for comedy in both Shampoo (1975) and Der Himmel soll warten (1978). As the faintly sinister businessman \"Lester\" and as the perpetually befuddled football trainer \"Max Corkle\", Warden received Academy Award nominations as Best Supporting Actor. Other memorable roles in the period were as the metro news editor of the \"Washington Post\" in Alle Männer des Präsidenten (1976), the German doctor in Tod auf dem Nil (1978), the senile, gun-toting judge in ... und Gerechtigkeit für alle (1979), the President of the United States in Willkommen, Mr. Chance (1979), the twin car salesmen in Mit einem Bein im Kittchen (1980) and Paul Newman's law partner in The Verdict - Die Wahrheit und nichts als die Wahrheit (1982).\n\nThis was the peak of Warden's career, as he entered his early sixties. He single-handedly made Andrew Bergman's Der ausgeflippte Professor (1981) watchable, but after that film, the quality of his roles declined. He made a third stab at TV, again appearing as a detective in Die Fälle des Harry Fox (1984) in the mid-1980s. He played the shifty convenience store owner \"Big Ben\" in So ein Satansbraten (1990) and its two sequels, a role unworthy of his talent, but he shone again as the Broadway high-roller \"Julian Marx\" in Woody Allen's Bullets Over Broadway (1994). After appearing in Warren Beatty's Bulworth (1998), Warden's last film was Helden aus der zweiten Reihe (2000) in 2000. He then lived in retirement in New York City with his girlfriend, Marucha Hinds. He was married to French stage actress Wanda Ottoni, best known for her role as the object of Joe Besser's desire in The Three Stooges short, Fifi Blows Her Top (1958). She gave up her career after her marriage. They had one son, Christopher, but had been separated for many years.\n\nThe son of a Lancashire bookmaker, Albert Finney came to motion pictures via the theatre. In 1956, he won a scholarship to RADA where his fellow alumni included Peter O'Toole and Alan Bates. He joined the Birmingham Repertory where he excelled in plays by William Shakespeare. A member of the Royal Shakespeare Company, Finney understudied Laurence Olivier at Stratford-upon-Avon, eventually acquiring a reputation as 'the new Olivier'. He first came to critical attention by creating the title role in Keith Waterhouse's \"Billy Liar\" on the London stage. His film debut soon followed with Der Komödiant (1960) by Tony Richardson with whom had earlier worked in the theatre. With the changing emphasis in 60s British cinema towards gritty realism and working-class milieus, Finney's typical screen personae became good-looking, often brooding proletarian types and rebellious anti-heroes as personified by his Arthur Seaton in Karel Reisz's Sonnabendnacht und Sonntagmorgen (1960). His exuberant defining role, however, was in the bawdy period romp Tom Jones (1963) in which Finney revealed a substantial talent for comedy. In the same vein, he scored another hit opposite Audrey Hepburn in the charming marital comedy Zwei auf gleichem Weg (1967).\n\nBy 1965, Finney had branched out into production, setting up Memorial Enterprises in conjunction with Michael Medwin. In 1968, he directed himself in Ein erfolgreicher Blindgänger (1968) and three years later produced the Chandleresque homage Auf leisen Sohlen (1971), in which he also starred as Eddie Ginley, a bingo-caller with delusions of becoming a private eye. From 1972 to 1975, Finney served as artistic director of the Royal Court Theatre. His intermittent forays to the screen confirmed him as a versatile international actor of note, though not what one might describe as a mainstream star. His roles have ranged from Ebenezer Scrooge in the musical version of Scrooge (1970) to Daddy Warbucks in Annie (1982) and (in flamboyant over-the-top make-up) Hercule Poirot in Mord im Orient-Express (1974). He appeared as Minister of Police Joseph Fouché in Ridley Scott's superb period drama Die Duellisten (1977) and as a grandiloquent Shakespearean actor in Ein ungleiches Paar - The Dresser (1983) for which he received an Oscar nomination. For the small screen Finney essayed Johannes Paul II - Sein Weg nach Rom (1984) and was a totally believable Winston Churchill in the acclaimed Churchill - The Gathering Storm (2002). His final movie credit was in the James Bond thriller Skyfall (2012).\n\nFinney was five-times nominated for Academy Awards in 1964, 1975, 1984, 1985 and 2001. He won two BAFTA Awards in 1961 and 2004. True to his working-class roots, he spurned a CBE in 1980 and a knighthood in 2000, later explaining his decision by stating that the 'Sir thing' \"slightly perpetuates one of our diseases in England, which is snobbery\". Albert Finney was diagnosed with kidney cancer in 2011. He died on February 7 2019 at a London hospital from a chest infection at the age of 82. Upon his death, John Cleese described him as \"the best\" and \"our greatest actor\".\n\nRip Torn was born Elmore Rual Torn Jr. on February 6, 1931 in Temple, Texas, the son of Thelma Mary (Spacek) and Elmore Rudolph Torn, who was an agriculturalist and economist, credited with popularizing the custom of eating black-eyed peas on New Year's Day. \"Rip\" is a family name, taken by generations of Torn men and bestowed on Elmore by his father, who was also called \"Rip.\" He was of German, Austrian, Bohemian, and Moravian descent. His mother was an elder sister of actress Sissy Spacek's father, Edwin Spacek.\n\nTorn attended Texas A&M and the University of Texas, where he joined Sigma Chi Fraternity. He majored in animal husbandry. Extremely naïve when he was young, Torn hitchhiked to Hollywood with the idea of becoming a movie star; he wanted to make enough money in order to buy a ranch. Success did not come overnight, as he had hoped, and Torn had to work many odd jobs while occasionally being cast in television roles. He made his feature film debut in Elia Kazan's Baby Doll - Begehre nicht des anderen Weib (1956) in a small part.\n\nSerious about learning his craft, he moved to New York City where he studied under Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio. Torn also studied dance with Martha Graham. His serious acting career began on the small screen, where he made a name for himself in the Golden Age of Television; between 1957 and 1960, he appeared regularly on such prestigious live shows as Omnibus (1952) and Playhouse 90 (1956).\n\nTorn made his Broadway debut in Kazan's staging of Tennessee Williams' \"Sweet Bird of Youth\" on March 10, 1959, in support of Paul Newman, Sidney Blackmer and Geraldine Page, who would become his second wife. The play was a hit, closing on January 30, 1960 after 375 performances. He won a 1960 Tony Award nomination as Best Featured Actor in a Play and a Theater World award for his role as \"Tom, Jr.\", a role he recreated in the 1962 film. (Torn also starred as \"Boss Finley\" in a later television adaptation of the play).\n\nTorn earned a reputation as an actor's actor on stage, both Broadway and off-Broadway, as well as on screen. He continued to work in the New York theater despite his demanding TV and movie schedule as both an actor and director. He won two Obie awards for his work off-Broadway, for Distinguished Performance in Norman Mailer's \"The Deer Park\" (for the 1966-67 season), and for Distinguished Direction for \"The Beard\" (1967-68). He had his own stage company, and directed his daughter Angelica Page (by Geraldine Page) in John Paul Alexander's \"Strangers in the Land of Canaan\" at the Actors Studio. Torn made his feature film directorial debut with Telefon Terror (1988).\n\nHe was constantly in demand as a character actor, in supporting, second lead and occasional lead roles. Arguably his best performance on film came in Zahltag (1973), and he was nominated for a best supporting actor Oscar for Cross Creek - Ich kämpfe um meine Freiheit (1983). Most of Torn's roles were in drama, though he was adept at comedy. His role in Albert Brooks' comedy Rendezvous im Jenseits (1991) led to his being cast in Die Larry Sanders Show (1992), on which he played talk show producer \"Artie.\" Torn won six consecutive Emmy nominations for the role, winning once for Best Supporting Actor in a comedy series in 1996.\n\nTorn was married to actress Ann Wedgeworth from 1956-61, whom he divorced to marry Geraldine Page. They remained married until her death in 1987. He was married to Amy Wright until his death. Torn helped his first cousin, Oscar-winner Sissy Spacek, to make her way as an actress, seeing to it that she was accepted by the Lee Strasberg's Actors Studio and then the Lee Strasberg Institute.\n\nRip Torn died in on July 9, 2019 in Lakeville, Connecticut, aged 88."
