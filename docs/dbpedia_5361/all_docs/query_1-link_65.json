        "text": "Invariably, some literary or cinematic source quirkily lurks beneath the original screenplays of the Coen Brothers, Ethan and Joel. Miller's Crossing, for instance, is a conflation of Dashiel Hammett's The Glass Key and Red Harvest; the central character of Barton Fink is based on playwright Clifford Odets and the film's plot derives from Deadline at Dawn, a movie Odets scripted in 1946; their previous film, The Big Lebowski, reworks Chandler's The Big Sleep.\n\nTheir new movie, O Brother, Where Art Thou? has several sources which are part of the film's meaning. On the surface, it's a picaresque comedy set in the Deep South in 1937 and stars George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Blake Nelson as three convicts who escape from a Mississippi chain-gang. Clooney is the charming, loquacious shyster-lawyer Everett, with a Clark Gable moustache and the kind of flat cap and bib-front overalls Henry Fonda wore in The Grapes of Wrath. Turturro is Pete, a surly redneck with a mean streak. Nelson is kind-hearted Delmar, the simple-minded hick. They're a splendid comic trio.\n\nEverett has smart-talked them into joining his quest to find the loot he's allegedly buried beneath a shack that will in four days time be submerged to create a dam. His real purpose, however, is to reach his ex-wife Penny (Holly Hunter) before she re-marries.\n\nAlong the way, they meet a black musician and cut a gramophone record at a remote radio station run by a blind manager. This blue-grass song makes them accidental radio stars, and they get involved in the re-election campaign of a corrupt state governor (Charles Durning), who's being challenged by an equally corrupt racist. As photographed by British cinematographer Roger Deakins, the bleached summer landscapes look a treat.\n\nBut the film announces at the start that it's based on The Odyssey and is prefaced by the opening lines of Robert Fitzgerald's translation: 'Sing in me, Muse, and through me tell the story of that man skilled in all ways of contending, the wanderer.'\n\nLike Joyce's Ulysses, O Brother is a mock epic with a somewhat shorter time span than Homer's, and the classical allusions are fairly jocular. The Clooney character's full name is Ulysses Everett McGill; his wife Penny is, of course, Penelope, and on their journey the convicts meet a variety of Homeric figures. A blind railroad worker warning of trouble with cows is presumably Tiresias; the lotus eaters are Baptists having their past obliterated by full immersion in a swamp; three sirens lure the travellers and appear to destroy Pete; the Cyclops turns up as a massive, one-eyed preacher (John Goodman), who first robs them and is later confronted at a nocturnal Ku Klux Klan rally, a brilliantly choreographed sequence that moves from funny to frightening to fantastic.\n\nIn addition to Homer, the film wittily invokes twentieth-century American legends. Tommy Johnson, the musician the wanderers play with, is based on Robert Johnson, the black blues composer who allegedly sold his soul to the Devil. While being pursued by the police, they're given a lift by a manic-depressive Baby Face Nelson, the gun-happy gangster who succeeded Dillinger as the FBI's Public Enemy Number One, though in fact (not that this is important) Nelson had been dead three years by 1937.\n\nHovering quietly ready for the film's climax is the epic of the Tennessee Valley Authority, Roosevelt's project to transform the rural South by providing cheap electricity, an event celebrated by grandiose poetic documentaries sponsored by the New Deal.\n\nMost significantly, however, the Coens celebrate the ideas and films of the great Preston Sturges, who after a decade writing screenplays emerged as the writer-director of the political satire The Great McGinty in 1940.\n\nThe surname of their protagonist, McGill, is presumably intended to echo that of Sturges's anti-hero, McGinty, who threw in his lot with crooked politicians the way Clooney does. But a more important reference is to Sturges's dazzling meditation on his craft, Sullivan's Travels , in which a successful comedy director demands that he be allowed to make a film that 'teaches a moral lesson, has social insight'.\n\nSullivan's film is to be called Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?, but his exploratory odyssey through Depression America, which gets him sent to jail and put on a chain gang, convinces him that he's better employed combating human misery by making people laugh.\n\nMoreover, Sullivan concludes: 'I never will have suffered enough to make Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? Besides it's already been done, they made it a couple of thousand years ago and I don't believe in remakes.'\n\nWas Sullivan thinking of Homer when he said that? And are the Coens engaged in the delightfully postmodern activity of remaking a famous movie that never existed?"
