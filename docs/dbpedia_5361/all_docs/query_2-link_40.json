        "text": "It would seem that 2004, the year of her 18th birthday, will be remembered as pivotal for Emmy Rossum due to her appearance in two very different films, The Day After Tomorrow (2004) and Das Phantom der Oper (2004). Emmy's performance in the latter film gained her a Golden Globe nomination.\n\nEmmanuelle Grey Rossum was born in New York City, where she was raised by her single mother, Cheryl Rossum, a corporate photographer (she has only met her father a few times). Her mother is of Russian Jewish descent and her father has English and Dutch ancestry. After passing an audition at the Metropolitan Opera when she was 7 years old, Rossum performed in more than 20 operas in six different languages at Lincoln Center, alongside such figures as Plácido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti. She was directed by Franco Zeffirelli in \"Carmen.\" She left the opera when she entered her teenage years, as she had grown too tall to perform as a child. Emmy also appeared in a Carnegie Hall presentation of \"The Damnation of Faust.\" She graduated from the Spence School, a private institution in Manhattan, in 1996 and then earned a high school diploma when 15 years old by taking online extension courses offered by Stanford University (Education Program for Gifted Youth). She later enrolled at Columbia University and studied art history and French.\n\nIn a change of venue, Emmy created the role of Abigail Williams in the daytime soap opera Jung und Leidenschaftlich - Wie das Leben so spielt (1956) in 1997 and branched out in performances in the made-for-television movies Das einsame Genie (1999) and The Audrey Hepburn Story (2000), in which she played the title character as a young teenager. Other television work included Snoops - Charmant und brandgefährlich (1999), Law & Order (1990), and Practice: Die Anwälte (1997).\n\nEmmy made her theatrical feature debut in the indie film Songcatcher (2000), with her good friend Rhoda Griffis, which won the Special Jury Award for Outstanding Ensemble Performance at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2000. Rossum received an Independent Spirit Award nomination in the category of Best Debut Performance for her performance as an Appalachian orphan. She played an aspiring songwriter (the title character) in the romantic comedy Nola (2003). Cast as the ill-fated daughter of a small-business owner in Clint Eastwood's Mystic River (2003), she projected an aura of innocence that made her character's tragic death memorable and heartbreaking. This was her first major studio film.\n\nAfter six months of filming her role as the fresh-faced but highly intelligent teenage damsel in distress The Day After Tomorrow (2004) in Montreal, she returned to New York and screen-tested for the role of Christine in Das Phantom der Oper (2004) in full costume and makeup, and was finally selected for the part by Andrew Lloyd Webber after singing for him at his home. Although she was surprised to be chosen ahead of many better-known and older actresses considered for the part, the combination of her vulnerable, fragile beauty and fine, classically trained singing voice ultimately proved that she was perfectly cast. In preparation for the role, she took ballet classes for two months and started polishing her singing. Emmy has commented that, in her approach to acting, she draws heavily upon her own experiences, so she visited locations in Paris and conjured up what she terms \"past memories\" to draw upon in making her performance emotionally realistic. She stood on the roof of the Opéra Garnier, where Christine sings \"All I Ask of You,\" and went underneath the opera house, where there is actually a gloomy, dark lake. She studied Degas's paintings of ballerinas in the Musée d'Orsay to learn how to stand like one.\n\nHer next project Poseidon (2006) was a mainstream effort, but since its release, she has been more true to advice she obtained from Sean Penn when making Mystic River (2003), that she should be picky and only accept roles that are fun to do, such as Dragonball Evolution (2009).\n\nEmmy Award-winning television host/actor Jai Rodriguez began his career at age 18 when he was cast in the role of Angel in the critically acclaimed Broadway musical RENT. Jai continued his Broadway career, appearing in shows like The Producers and Spinning Into Butter, and he created and performed the title role of Zanna in the Off-Broadway sensation Zanna, Don't!. In tandem with his Broadway career, Jai became a star in the firmament of New York City nightlife when he created his long-running Twisted Cabaret, a concert series that ran for three consecutive years at one of New York City's most notable hot-spots - Club XL.\n\nMost recognized for his role in Bravo's culturally groundbreaking series Queer Eye For The Straight Guy, Jai created a niche role on the Emmy Award-winning series as the 'Culture Vulture,' a youthfully savvy addition to the show's already dynamic cast. Working regularly as an authority in culture and style, Jai has hosted for a veritable grab-bag of lifestyle entertainment programming including Styleyes Miami (SiTv), America's Prom Queen (ABC Family), Ultimate Style (Style Network), two consecutive season's of Groomer Has It (Animal Planet), and Model Latina (SiTv). He was also an ABC official pre-show host for the 2009 American Music Awards.\n\nIn the past few years Jai returned to TV in dramatic roles on NBCs Harrys Law, ABCs Detroit 187, and Days Of Our Lives. He also plays Wayne Bradys husband Tom on CBS hit How I Met Your Mother. Other roles include guest star appearances on NBCs Are You There Chelsea?, FOXs Bones, and as a transgender woman Amanda Knott on NBCs Harrys Law.\n\nJai stared as \"Geoffrey\" on ABCs comedy Malibu Country opposite Reba McEntire and Lily Tomlin making him the first male to garner fame from a reality series to become a series regular on Network TV. This past Christmas Jai stared opposite Kelly Clarkson in her NBC Christmas Special; Kelly Clarksons Cautionary Christmas Tale.\n\nA dynamic vocalist, Jai has had the honor of sharing the stage singing duets with musical legends like Gladys Knight, Patti Labelle, Brian McKnight, Taylor Dayne and Michelle Williams. Jai was featured in Lady Gaga's video \"Telephone\" featuring Beyoncé.\n\nJai has done regular acting work, guest-starring on LOGO'S series Rick and Steve, FX's Nip/Tuck, and Teen Nick's Gigantic. He played the role of Angelo Ferraro, a leading cast member in the 2009 feature film Oy Vey! My Son Is Gay!! (2009) alongside Carmen Electra and Lainie Kazan. The film was an Official Selection at film festivals worldwide and garnered critical praise, winning several awards in various categories.\n\nJai continues to develop his professional musical endeavors both in and out of the recording studio and has performed his one-man shows Xposed, My Truth, and Dirty Little Secrets in Los Angeles, Miami, San Diego and New York. In addition, Jai currently serves as the Co-Creator and Co-Executive Producer for LOGO's much anticipated new series Bad Sex.\n\nOn December 11, 2013 at 10 pm on NBC Jai stars opposite Kelly Clarkson in her one hour holiday movie: Kelly Clarkson's Cautionary Christmas Music Tale (2013).\n\nJai continues to be an advocate for issues he is passionate about, working with organizations like the NOH8 Campaign, Aids Walk, Project Angel Food, the Trevor Project and Love is Louder campaign which fights bullying.\n\nBlonde-haired, blue-eyed with an effervescent personality, Meg Ryan was born Margaret Mary Emily Anne Hyra in Fairfield, Connecticut, to Susan (Duggan), an English teacher and one-time actress, and Harry Hyra, a math teacher.

Ever by Debra Jo's side are her loyal Yorkies, Olive and Martini, who have both had all their knees replaced and are looking forward to their impending move to the west coast where \"That '90s Show\" will film.\n\nIncisive, intense, multi-talented American actor Lance Solomon Reddick was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the younger of two sons, to Solomon Reddick and public schoolteacher Dorothy Gee. Having opted initially for a career in music, he attended first the Peabody Preparatory Institute and the Walden School before studying classical composition at the University of Rochester's Eastman School of Music, qualifying with a Bachelor's Degree. By the early '90s, however, Reddick was forced to re-evaluate his career plans because of a severe back injury suffered while pulling a double shift waiting on tables and delivering newspapers. A pressing need to make ends meet made him enroll at the Yale School of Drama, from where he went on to graduate in 1994 with a Master of Fine Arts Degree. He derived much inspiration from his classmate Paul Giamatti and came to regard Daniel Day-Lewis as his quintessential acting role model.\n\nPossessed of an athletic build and a deep, resonant voice, Reddick also had a self-declared affinity for accents. Preparing himself for his roles, he immersed himself fully into his characters as a \"transformational performer\", often rehearsing his lines in front of a mirror. He made his television debut in an episode of New York Undercover (1994). Though he played a couple of drug addicts early on, he soon found himself much in demand-- and ultimately typecast -- as powerful authority figures, from police detectives (Johnny Basil in Oz - Hölle hinter Gittern (1997)) to FBI agents (Law & Order (1990)) to senior police officer (Cedric Daniels in The Wire (2002)). One of his best known roles on the big screen was as the mysterious Mr. Charon, concierge at the Continental Hotel, scene of much of the action in the John Wick (2014) franchise.\n\nArguably, his most memorable character was that of Phillip Broyles, special agent-in-charge with the Department of Homeland Security, heading a team of experts investigating paranormal events in the outstanding science fiction drama series Fringe: Grenzfälle des FBI (2008). Broyles was a no-nonsense tough guy, who, nevertheless, remained steadfastly loyal in defense of his team against insidious forces from within and without. Unlike Broyles, Reddick's other important recurring TV character, Chief Irving in Bosch (2014), was a morally ambiguous man motivated chiefly by political ambition. Both were flawless performances.\n\nPrior to his sad and untimely passing in March 2023 at the age of 60, Reddick was much sought-after as a voice actor for animations and video games. He also never lost his lifelong passion for music, and, in 2007, released an album of his compositions entitled \"Contemplations & Remembrances\". In private life, the twice-married Reddick was said to have been very much devoted to his three dogs."
