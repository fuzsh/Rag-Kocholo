        "meta_description": "The surname Akins is a Scottish and Northern Irish family name\nhaving several possible origins, although it is generally\nconsidered to be a variant of Aikens which is assumed to be a\npatronymic form of the Scottish name Aiken It is thought that these\nsurnames may derive from the personal name Aitken, which is the\nScots form of Atkin, a northern British variant of the English name\nAdkin, which is a diminutive form of the Biblical name Adam.\nAnother possible derivation of the Akins surname is suggested by\nH. Amanda Robb and Andrew Chesler, authors of ''The Encyclopedia of\nAmerican Family names'' who state \"the name was given to those who\nwere from the area near Kyle Akin, a strait in Scotland named for\nKing Haakon IV of Norway of Norway.\" This place name is known in\nScottish Gaelic as ''Caol Acain'', and means \"Haakon's Sound\", or\n\"Haakon Narrows\". George Fraser Black, author of ''The Surnames of\nScotland'' noted that, according to John Paterson (in 1867), the\nsurname ''Aiken'' was an old name in the parish of Ballantrae,\nAyrshire; and that \"in Orkney it is believed to have replaced the\nOld Norse name Haakon and its derivative Hakonson.\" Black cites the\nname of Magnus Attkinsone, a tacksman of Garth in Harray in 1492,\nwhich he states \"may be a misreading of Awkinsone (= Hakon's son,\nHauquinus was the Latinized form of Hakon). According to an account\nof the origin of the name given in ''The Baronage of Angus and\nMearns'' an officer \"who had command of the troops who besieged the\nusurper Macbeth of Scotland in Dunsinane Castle, ordered all his\nsoldiers to march to the attack with branches of oak taken from\nBirnam Wood, near Dunkeld, and on that account got the name of\nAikman. He is said to have been the progenitor of all the Aikmans\nand Aikens in Scotland.\" William Cutter, in his ''Genealogical and\nPersonal Memoirs Relating to the Families of Boston and Eastern\nMassachusetts,'' states \"History ascribes to this family an ancient\nScotch origin and antiquarians inform us that the surname Aikens is\nderived from the word aik - an oak, or oaken - indicative of\nstrength and firmness. It is said too that the Aikens of Scotland\nprevious to the emigration to the north of Ireland were a sturdy\nrace, among them famous clansmen in feudal times and later when\ncompelled to depart into the country of the Celts because of\nreligious persecution they were a devout Protestant people and with\nmany others turned from the land of their forefathers rather than\nengage in strife in defense of their religious liberties.\"\nAccording to Robert A. Bell, author of ''The Book of Ulster\nSurnames,'' in Ireland this surname is common only in Ulster.\n\"Aiken is of Scottish origin. It is the Scottish form of the\nEnglish name Atkin, which comes from Adkin, a pet form of Adam. The\nname was very common in the parish of Ballantrae in Ayrshire and\nmany of our Aikens may stem from there. There are many variant\nspellings. It was recorded as being used interchangeably with\nEakins in Belfast, Ekin in counties Derry and Donegal, Ekin in Co.\nDonegal and Egan in Co. Down. Some of the Irish sept of O'Hagan may\nhave further anglicised their name to Aiken. In Co. Antrim, where\nit is most popular, it was found to be most concentrated in the\narea northwest of Ballymena in the mid-nineteenth century.\" Michael\nC. O'Laughlin includes ''Aiken'' as a variant form of the Irish\nsurname ''O'hAodhagain'' (frequently Anglicised as ''O'Hagan'').\nEdward MacLysaght also associates the name ''Aiken'' with that of\n''O'Hagan'', saying \"In Irish it is O'hAodhagain, descendant of\nAodhagan (diminutive of Aodh or Hugh). There are many variants of\nthe name in English such as Hegan, Aiken, etc. The sept was located\nin Co. Tyrone with the seat of its chief at Tullahogue, where he\nexcercised the hereditary right of inaugurating O'Neill as King or\nOverlord of Ulster.\"\nAccording to William and Mary Durning, authors of ''The\nScotch-Irish'' the names Aiken, Akins, and Eakin came to Ireland\nfrom Scotland during the Plantation of Ulster in the 1600's where\nthey were transplanted to the Irish counties of Antrim, Monaghan,\nand Down respectively. In another work by the same authors,\nentitled ''A Guide to Irish Roots'', they consider the name Akin\nfrom the standpoint of an Anglicization of the Irish name O'Eakin\n[O'hOgain], a family which descends from the Irish Ui Tuirtre, who\nwere descended from Fiach Tort, son of Colla Uais of the Oirghialla\nwhich were comprised of the descendants of Eochaid Doiml√©n, son of\nCairbre Lifechair, son of Cormac mac Airt and his wife Etaine,\nwhose ancestry goes back another forty-nine generations in Ireland\nto its earliest Gaelic founders, the Milesians.\nAs a surname, the first recorded appearance of its use occurs in\nthe year 1405 in the court records of a Scottish sea merchant named\n\"John of Akyne\" who sought restitution for having been kidnapped by\nLaurence Tuttebury of Hull, England, who pirated his ship and\ngoods. Other instances of its use occur in the early records of\nScotland and Ireland where the surname is seen to have undergone a\nvariety of transformations in spelling, accounting for the many\nvariant forms of the name still seen today.\nIncluded among these early records are William Ackin, who was a\nwitness in the parish of Brechin in the year 1476. George Aczin\nappears in Lanarkshire in 1498. John Eckin was a tenant under the\nBishop of Aberdeen in 1511. John Ackyne served as bailie of\nStirling in 1520. Robert Aykkyne was admitted to the burgess of\nAberdeen in 1529. Bessie Aiken of Leith was found guilty of\nWitchcraft in 1597, narrowly escaping execution. William Ekyn was a\nlessee on the Cunningham estate in Ulster in 1613. Robert Aickeene\nis listed in a muster roll of the Duke of Lennox's men in Raphoe,\nCounty Donegal, Ireland in 1630. John Aekin was a passenger to\nWarwick County, Virginia, in 1645. David Akin of Aberdeen was an\nearly settler of Newport, Rhode Island arriving by 1662. A\nCovenanter named John Aiken fought in the Battle of Bothwell Bridge\nin 1679. Alexander Aiken of Glasgow was listed as a pipe-maker in\nHearth Tax rolls for 1690. Alexander Aiken of Bo'ness, West\nLothian, was among the Scots colonists who took part in the\nill-fated Darien expedition in 1699. Edward Acken, a Scots-Irish\nimmigrant, was among the founders of the town of Londonderry, New\nHampshire in 1720. ''The William Akins'' a brigantine cargo ship\nsailing from the port of Belfast to the River Clyde ran aground on\nthe rocks north of the ferry at Kyleakin, Scotland, on 18 October\n1872.",
