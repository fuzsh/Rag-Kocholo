The guidance has been updated to reflect changes to the Immigration Rules coming into effect on 4 April 2024 (as set out in Statement of Changes HC 590, published on 14 March 2024) and to make some other minor amendments and clarifications.\n\nDetails of the changes are set out below. Paragraph numbers in brackets refer to the previous version of this guidance where the number was different:\n\nAbout this guidance: references to predecessor routes in list of routes deleted\n\nGlossary: new definitions of ‘occupation code’, ‘SOC 2010 occupation code’ and ‘SOC 2020 occupation code’ added\n\nS1.13: minor clarifications and examples added\n\nS1.22, S4.1, S4.8: list of routes updated to reflect the existing minimum salary requirement for Seasonal Workers\n\nS1.24 to S1.26: paragraphs moved from section SK2 of Sponsor a Skilled Worker as this guidance is cross-cutting; subsequent paragraphs in this section renumbered accordingly\n\nS2.15: clarification added that the same considerations apply to applications for Defined Certificates of Sponsorship (CoS)\n\nS2.22: final bullet point (referring to CoS allocations expiring before 24 June 2023) deleted\n\n(S2.24, S2.27): paragraphs deleted; subsequent paragraphs in this section renumbered accordingly\n\nS3.5 to S3.8: new paragraphs clarifying restrictions on who can assign a CoS; subsequent paragraphs in this section renumbered accordingly\n\nS3.29 to S3.37 (S3.25 to S3.29): updated to reflect the transition from SOC 2010 occupation codes to SOC 2020 occupation for CoS assigned on or after 4 April 2024; subsequent paragraphs in this section renumbered accordingly\n\n(S4.19): deleted; subsequent paragraphs in this section renumbered accordingly\n\nS4.15 (S4.16): example updated\n\nS5.8: occupation codes in second bullet point updated to reflect the transition from SOC 2010 occupation codes to SOC 2020 occupation for CoS assigned on or after 4 April 2024\n\nS5.8: sub-bullet point added to final bullet point to clarify that where the sponsor is relying on the EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement exemption from the Immigration Skills Charge, the worker must have worked for the sponsor group for at least one year\n\nS5.28 to S5.30: new paragraphs clarifying how TUPE affects liability for the Immigration Skills Charge\n\nS7.16 to S7.18: new paragraphs on permission to work while a switching application is pending; subsequent paragraphs in this section renumbered accordingly\n\nS8.12: paragraph on conditions of supplementary employment updated to reflect revised definition in paragraph 6.2 of the Immigration Rules for CoS assigned on or after 4 April 2024\n\nS8.12A: paragraph deleted as the supplementary work concession for Health and Care workers ended on 27 August 2023\n\n(S9.5): empty paragraph deleted; subsequent paragraphs in this section renumbered accordingly\n\nS9.6: new paragraph clarifying that ‘same occupation code’ includes where a worker changes occupation code as a result of the transition from SOC 2010 to SOC 2020 occupation codes for CoS assigned on or after 4 April 2024; similar clarifications added to S9.10, S9.13, S9.17 and S9.18\n\nAnnex S1: list of occupation codes updated to reflect the transition from SOC 2010 to SOC 2020 occupation codes for CoS assigned on or after 4 April 2024\n\n(Annex S2): annex on how changes to Immigration Rules on 4 April 2024 will affect CoS deleted\n\nthroughout: various minor clarifications, drafting amendments and housekeeping changes\n\nContent in this section:\n\nWho needs to be sponsored (including a definition of ‘settled worker’)\n\nWho can sponsor workers\n\nHow you sponsor a worker\n\nEmployment relationship between sponsor and worker\n\nWorking on a contract basis\n\nRight to work checks\n\nUnderstand your sponsorship duties\n\nWho needs to be sponsored\n\nS1.1. You will need to sponsor any overseas worker you wish to employ or engage if they:\n\nare not a settled worker (as defined below); or\n\ndo not have other immigration permission allowing them to work for you\n\nDefinition of ‘settled worker’\n\nS1.2. A ‘settled worker’ is any one of the following:\n\na British citizen\n\nan Irish citizen (with limited exceptions – see ‘Employing Irish citizens’)\n\na person who has been granted limited leave to enter or remain (‘pre-settled status’) or indefinite leave to enter or remain (‘settled status’) under Appendix EU to the Immigration Rules (also known as the EU Settlement Scheme (EUSS))\n\na person who has made a valid application under the EUSS and is awaiting a decision on that application\n\nan EU, an EEA or a Swiss national who started working for you on or before 30 June 2021, if you carried out the relevant right to work checks in force at that time\n\na British overseas territories citizen, except for those from sovereign base areas in Cyprus\n\na Commonwealth citizen who can prove they have the right of abode in the UK – ‘Commonwealth citizen’ means:\n\na British Overseas Territories citizen\n\na British National (Overseas)\n\na British Overseas citizen\n\na British subject; or\n\na citizen of a country listed in Schedule 3 to the British Nationality Act 1981\n\na Commonwealth citizen (as defined above) who has been granted permission on the UK Ancestry route on the basis they have a grandparent born in the UK or Islands\n\nanyone who has indefinite leave to enter or remain (settlement) in the UK\n\nS1.3. A settled worker can work in the UK without restrictions and you therefore do not need to sponsor them. You must still, however, carry out the appropriate right to work checks before employing the worker, and make any necessary follow-up checks if they have time-limited permission.\n\nWorkers awaiting a decision on an EUSS application\n\nS1.4. You can employ a worker without sponsoring them if they can show they:\n\nhave made a valid application under the EUSS; and\n\nare awaiting a decision on that application (or the outcome of any administrative review of, or appeal against, that decision)\n\nS1.5. A person who makes a valid application under the EUSS will be issued with a ‘Certificate of Application’ (CoA). A CoA should be used to evidence their right to work until their application (and any administrative review or appeal) is finally determined. For detailed guidance on how to carry out a right to work check on individuals who have been issued with a CoA, see Right to work checks: an employer’s guide.\n\nS1.6. You must stop employing the person if you become aware that their EUSS application has been refused and any application for an administrative review of, or an appeal against, that decision is unsuccessful (and they are otherwise unable to evidence their right to work).\n\nEU, EEA and Swiss nationals who started working for you before 1 July 2021\n\nS1.7. You can continue to employ an EU, an EEA or a Swiss national without sponsoring them if they started working for you on or before 30 June 2021, have been employed by you continuously since then and you carried out a right to work check before that date in line with the legislation and published guidance in force at the time you made the check.\n\nS1.8. You do not have to carry out a retrospective right to work check on such individuals. You will maintain a continuous statutory excuse against liability for a civil penalty if the initial checks were undertaken in line with the guidance that applied at the time you made the check.\n\nS1.9. If, however, you subsequently become aware that a person you are employing in the above circumstances has not yet applied for status under the EUSS, and does not otherwise have the appropriate immigration permission to work for you, you should advise them to apply as soon as possible. If they do not, they may lose their right to live and work in the UK and you may become liable for a civil penalty or prosecution for employing an illegal worker. Detailed information on what you should do in these circumstances is available under the heading ‘EEA Citizens and non-EEA family members without lawful immigration status’ in Right to work checks: an employer’s guide.\n\nEmploying Irish citizens\n\nS1.10. Irish citizens do not need permission to enter, live or work in the UK, unless they are subject to a deportation order, an exclusion decision or an international travel ban. You can therefore employ, or continue to employ, Irish citizens (including those who arrived in the UK after 31 December 2020) without needing to sponsor them. They are not required to apply for status under the EUSS (although they can do so if they wish).\n\nS1.11. Irish citizens can prove their right to work in the UK with an Irish passport or a passport card (current or expired), or other documents specified in Right to work checks: an employer’s guide.\n\nS1.12. For further information on the immigration status of Irish citizens, see the Common Travel Area guidance on GOV.UK.\n\nPeople with other immigration permission allowing them to work\n\nS1.13. You do not need to sponsor a worker who:\n\nhas immigration permission to be in the UK which does not prevent them from doing the work in question – examples include, but are not limited to:\n\na person with permission under Appendix FM to the Immigration Rules as the partner of a British citizen or settled person can take any kind of employment\n\na person with permission as a dependant of a Skilled Worker can take any kind of work, except as a professional sportsperson or coach\n\na person with permission as a Student may be allowed to work for 10 or 20 hours per week during term-time and full-time outside of term time (with restrictions on the type of work they can do), depending on the type of course they are following – see ‘Work conditions’ in the Student and Child Student caseworker guidance for further information\n\na person with leave to enter or remain under Appendix Service Providers from Switzerland can work in relation to an eligible contract between a Swiss employer or company and a UK employer or company, for a maximum of 90 days in any year\n\nhas a valid application registration card (ARC) and this says they have permission to work – in most cases, where permission to work is granted, the worker will only be allowed work in a job listed in Appendix Immigration Salary List (or the former Appendix Shortage Occupation List) and this will be clearly stated on the ARC (see Permission to work and volunteering for asylum seekers for further information)\n\nis exempt from requiring permission – for example:\n\na diplomat or senior official of an international organisation who is exempt from immigration control\n\nan EU, EEA or a Swiss national who qualifies as a frontier worker\n\nS1.14. You must check the person has the right to work before you employ them and carefully check for any restrictions on the type of work they can do. If the worker has time-limited permission, you will need to carry out follow-up checks. For guidance, see Right to work checks: an employer’s guide.\n\nS1.15. To sponsor a worker, you must hold a valid sponsor licence for the route on which you intend to sponsor them. If you do not already hold the relevant licence, you must apply for, and be granted, one before you can sponsor the worker. See:\n\nPart 1: Apply for a licence\n\nthe relevant route-specific guidance\n\nS1.16. You must assign a valid Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) to the worker so they can make a successful application for permission to enter or stay in the UK. You will have to pay a fee for each CoS you assign. If you are sponsoring a Skilled Worker or a Senior or Specialist Worker, you will normally need to pay the Immigration Skills Charge for each worker you sponsor. For further information, see:\n\nsections S2, S3, S5 and S6 of this guidance\n\nthe relevant route-specific guidance\n\nS1.17. Before you assign a CoS, you must:\n\ncheck the role is eligible\n\nensure you will pay the worker appropriately\n\ncheck the worker is eligible\n\nmeet any other route-specific requirements\n\nCheck the role is eligible\n\nS1.18. You must check the role in which you wish to sponsor the worker is eligible for the relevant route. For example, if you wish to sponsor a Skilled Worker, Global Business Mobility worker, Government Authorised Exchange worker or Scale-up Worker, the job must meet the skill-level requirement for the relevant route. In most cases, this means the job must be listed as eligible in the relevant table of Appendix Skilled Occupations but there are some exceptions to this – see the relevant route-specific guidance for details.\n\nS1.19. For some routes, you will need to take additional steps before you can sponsor a worker. For example:\n\nbefore you can sponsor a Religious Worker, you may have to carry out a ‘resident labour consideration’ to give settled workers a chance to apply\n\nbefore you can sponsor a Creative Worker, you may have to follow a ‘code of practice’ for the specific sector in which you wish to sponsor the worker\n\nbefore you can sponsor an International Sportsperson, you will need to obtain an endorsement from the relevant sports governing body for the worker\n\nif you have a Provisional rating on the UK Expansion Worker route, you must make a successful request to have your rating changed to an A-rating before you can sponsor any workers other than the Authorising Officer\n\nbefore you can sponsor a Service Supplier or Secondment Worker, you must have registered (via your sponsorship management (SMS) account) the relevant contract on which the sponsored individual will be working\n\nS1.20. Refer to the relevant route-specific guidance for further information.\n\nS1.21. There are additional rules you will need to follow if the person you wish to sponsor will be working on a contract basis.\n\nPay and conditions\n\nS1.22. If you are sponsoring a Skilled Worker, Senior or Specialist Worker, Graduate Trainee, UK Expansion Worker, Scale-up Worker or Seasonal Worker, you must pay them at least the minimum salary specified for that route. For all routes, you must ensure the role you are sponsoring the worker for complies with both the National Minimum Wage and the Working Time Regulations. We will check you are meeting these requirements through regular HMRC checks and, if appropriate, compliance visits. For further information, see:\n\nsection S4 of this guidance\n\nthe relevant route-specific guidance\n\nCheck the worker is eligible\n\nS1.23. You must satisfy yourself that the worker you wish to sponsor will be able to make a successful immigration application under the Worker or Temporary Worker routes and, if granted, will comply with their conditions of stay. For further information, see:\n\nsections S7 to S9 of this guidance\n\nthe relevant route-specific guidance\n\nEmployment relationship between sponsor and worker\n\nS1.24. As the sponsor, you will normally be the sponsored worker’s employer and responsible for their duties, functions, and outcomes or outputs, and for paying the worker. We recognise, however, there are certain circumstances where there is no direct employer-employee relationship. In such cases, the worker must still have a sponsor that is able and willing to accept all of the responsibilities and duties associated with being their sponsor.\n\nS1.25. There will also be circumstances where there is a clear statutory relationship between the employing body and a publicly funded body, where the publicly funded body can intervene in the running or funding of the employing or paying body. In these cases, the publicly funded body can be the sponsor. Below are 2 examples of this.\n\nExample 1\n\nA local authority has powers of control and direction over self-governing schools, so the local authority can sponsor teachers in these schools.\n\nExample 2\n\nA Strategic Health Authority, through its Deanery, Local Education and Training Board (LETB), provider, or commissioning organisation, has funding control of training posts for doctors and dentists within NHS Trusts, even though it is not the paying body. In this case, the Deanery or LETB can be the sponsor.\n\nS1.26. Where a worker is not your direct employee, we will look closely at the arrangement to make sure you can meet your sponsor duties and we will take action against you if we find you are not. See also ‘Working on a contract basis below’.\n\nS1.27. Where a person is, or will be, working on a contract basis (being supplied as labour by one organisation to another), the sponsor must be whoever has full responsibility for all of the duties, functions and outcomes or outputs of the job the worker will be doing.\n\nS1.28. If you are the sponsor, and the worker is employed by you to do work for a third party to fulfil a contractual obligation on your behalf, they must be contracted by you to provide a service or project within a certain period of time. This means a service or project which has a specific end date, after which it will have been completed or the service provided will no longer be operated by you or anyone else, as explained in the example below:\n\nExample\n\nCompany A has a contractual obligation with a client Company Z to deliver an IT solution within an agreed period of time.\n\nA worker who is sponsored by Company A to do a job on the IT project may be sent to work for the length of the contract at Company Z’s premises, but they remain employed by Company A throughout the whole period of the contract.\n\nAs Company A is fully responsible for all the worker’s duties, functions, outputs or outcomes, Company A can be the worker’s sponsor and therefore assign the CoS.\n\nS1.29. You cannot sponsor a worker if you will not have full responsibility for all the duties, functions and outcomes or outputs of the job they will be doing, or if either:\n\nthe job amounts to the hiring out of the worker to another organisation (third party) who is not the sponsor to fill a position with them, whether temporary or permanent, regardless of any genuine contract between you and the third party\n\nthe worker will be contracted to undertake an ongoing routine role or to provide an ongoing routine service for a third party who is not the sponsor, regardless of the nature or length of any arrangement between you and the third party\n\nS1.30. Where we think you are, or will be, hiring a worker to a third party as routine labour, we may ask for confirmation from the other organisation that the worker:\n\nworks, or will work, independently from them, and that you, as the sponsor, have full control over all their duties, functions, outputs or outcomes\n\nis not being supplied to them to undertake a routine role\n\nS1.31. If we find you are supplying the worker, or workers, as labour to another organisation to undertake a routine role or you do not have full responsibility for their duties, functions and outcomes or outputs, we will revoke your licence.\n\nS1.32. If the worker is self-employed, there must be a genuine contract for employment or services between you and the worker. This contract must show:\n\nthe names and signatures of all involved (which must include you and the worker)\n\nthe start and end dates of the contract\n\ndetails of the job, or piece of work, the worker has been contracted to do\n\nhow much the worker will be paid\n\nRight to work checks\n\nS1.33. You must check that any worker you wish to employ has permission to enter or stay in the UK and can do the work in question before they start working for you. This applies even if the worker is, or appears to be, a British citizen or other settled worker. If you fail to carry out a right to work check, or any necessary follow-up checks, you may be liable for a civil penalty under illegal working legislation. If you are issued with a civil penalty, we will normally revoke your licence. For guidance on how to carry out the relevant checks, and the evidence you must keep, see:\n\nRight to work checks: an employer’s guide\n\nAppendix D to the sponsor guidance\n\nS1.34. You are responsible for checking that your sponsored workers carry out the role for which they are being sponsored and for monitoring their attendance. You must tell us if they don’t turn up for work, are absent without permission, or there are significant changes to their employment or to your organisation. For further information on your reporting and other sponsorship duties, see section C1 of Part 3: Sponsor duties and compliance.\n\nS1.35. You must also keep records for each worker you sponsor – see Appendix D. This includes evidence of any recruitment activity you have undertaken to fill the role, even if you were not required to carry out a formal resident labour market test.\n\nS1.36. If you fail to comply with your reporting and record-keeping duties, we may take compliance action against you – this could include revoking your licence.\n\nContent in this section:\n\nWhat is a Certificate of Sponsorship?\n\nTypes of CoS\n\nCoS fees\n\nYour CoS allocation\n\nWhat is a Certificate of Sponsorship?\n\nS2.1. Before a worker can make a successful immigration application, you must assign them a valid Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS).\n\nS2.2. A CoS is not a paper certificate or document, but a database record which confirms details of the worker you intend to sponsor and the job they will do. You assign one using your sponsorship management system (SMS) account. This involves working through a short online form where you give us the relevant information. All of the information you enter will be stored and can be viewed by us.\n\nS2.3. A CoS is confirmation from you, as a licensed sponsor, that you:\n\nwish to sponsor the worker\n\nare satisfied the worker can meet the relevant immigration requirements\n\nare eligible to sponsor the worker on the relevant route\n\nagree to abide by the terms and conditions as stated on the SMS\n\nS2.4. A CoS can only be assigned by a person who has access to the SMS as a Level 1 or Level 2 user – see section L4 of Part 1: Apply for a licence for information on Level 1 and Level 2 users.\n\nS2.5. Assigning a CoS does not guarantee the worker will be granted entry clearance or permission – they must meet all of the immigration requirements of the route on which they are applying.\n\nS2.6. Before you assign a CoS, you should talk to the worker about their current immigration status, as this may affect any application they make because of the rules on ‘switching’ (changing from one immigration route to another) or maximum time limits for the route on which they are applying.\n\nS2.7. You must follow the rules set out in the sponsor guidance when assigning or applying for a CoS. We can revoke, suspend or downgrade your licence, or reduce or remove the number of CoS you can assign, if you do not comply with these rules. See Part 3: Sponsor duties and compliance for further information on the action we can take.\n\nTypes of CoS\n\nS2.8. There are 2 types of CoS:\n\n‘Defined’ CoS: these are for Skilled Workers applying for entry clearance (a visa) from outside the UK\n\n‘Undefined’ CoS: these are:\n\nCoS assigned to Skilled Workers applying for permission to stay from within the UK\n\nCoS assigned to workers on all other routes, whether applying for entry clearance, permission to enter or permission to stay\n\nS2.9. You must assign Undefined CoS from your annual allocation.\n\nS2.10. You cannot have an annual allocation of Defined CoS – you must apply for one, using a separate process, each time you need one. For guidance on the process, see section SK12 of Sponsor a Skilled Worker.\n\nS2.11. If you are sponsoring Skilled Workers, you must ensure you understand the difference between Defined and Undefined CoS and assign the correct type. We will normally revoke your licence if you assign:\n\na Defined CoS for a job other than the one described in the application for that CoS\n\nan Undefined CoS where a Defined one is required\n\nCoS fees\n\nS2.12. You must pay a fee for each CoS you assign. If you fail to pay the correct fee, we may cancel the CoS. This may result in any application which relies on that CoS being rejected or refused. For information on current CoS fees, see the UK visa fees page on GOV.UK.\n\nS2.13. If you are sponsoring a Skilled Worker or a Senior or Specialist Worker, you may also have to pay the Immigration Skills Charge each time you assign a CoS.\n\nYour CoS allocation\n\nS2.14. When you apply for a licence, we ask you for an estimate of the number of Undefined CoS you may wish to assign in your first year in each route in which you are applying to be licensed. You must justify your request and we may ask you for further information before we make a decision.\n\nDeciding your allocation\n\nS2.15. If we approve your licence application, we will notify you of your CoS allocation for the year. In setting your CoS allocation, we may consider relevant factors including, but not limited to, the following:\n\nany agents you will use to recruit workers and whether they have been linked to immigration abuse in the past\n\nyour previous record in dealing with us, including under the current sponsorship arrangements, the previous Tier 2 and Tier 5 arrangements, or the work permit arrangements that were in place before the introduction of Tier 2 and Tier 5\n\nthe number of workers employed at your organisation\n\nthe kind of business you conduct\n\nthe extent of the business you conduct\n\nthe length of time you have been trading\n\nif you are applying on the UK Expansion Worker route, whether the Authorising Officer named in your sponsor licence application is based in the UK or overseas – see section GBM3 of Sponsor a Global Business Mobility worker for further information\n\nWe will apply the same considerations when deciding any applications for Defined CoS under the Skilled Worker route. See section SK12 of Sponsor a Skilled Worker for further information.\n\nS2.16. If we allocate fewer CoS than you requested, or set your allocation to zero, this could be for reasons including, but not limited to:\n\nyou have a history of non-compliance\n\nyou cannot justify your need for the number you have requested\n\nwe do not consider your need to be credible, based on your current circumstances\n\nwe are not satisfied you can offer genuine employment that meets the skill-level or salary requirements of the route (where relevant)\n\nyou are unsure whether or when you may need to recruit any workers in the future\n\nYour CoS year\n\nS2.17. Once we have decided your CoS allocation, we will allocate them (if any) to your SMS account. You will then have up to 12 months to use them. This is known as your ‘CoS year’ (or ‘allocation year’). Your CoS year runs as follows:\n\nif you held a valid Tier 2 (General) or Tier 2 (Intra-Company Transfer) licence on 30 November 2020 and this was converted into a Skilled Worker or Intra-Company routes licence on 1 December 2020 and your allocation renewal has been automated: from 6 April in one year to 5 April the following year\n\nif you held a valid Tier 2 (General) or Tier 2 (Intra-Company Transfer) licence on 30 November 2020 and this was converted into a Skilled Worker or Intra-Company routes licence on 1 December 2020 and your allocation renewal has not been automated: 12 months from the date your allocation renewal request was granted in 2021 and, in subsequent years, 12 months from the date your allocation renewal request is granted\n\nin all other cases: 12 months from the date your licence was granted and, in subsequent years, 12 months from the date an allocation renewal request is granted\n\nReducing your allocation\n\nS2.18. We may reduce your allocation (or set it to zero) if your circumstances change. This could be if you downsize, or if we believe you pose a threat to immigration control – for example, if, after your original CoS allocation has been decided, we take compliance action against you.\n\nIncreasing your allocation during the CoS year\n\nS2.19. If, part way through your CoS year, you think you will not have enough CoS to last until the end of the year, or if your allocation was previously set to zero, you can apply to increase your allocation via your SMS account. You must give reasons for doing so and we may ask for evidence. For guidance on increasing your allocation, see guide 7 in SMS Manual 2: managing your licence.\n\nRenewing your annual CoS allocation\n\nS2.20. Your CoS allocation will need to be renewed each year while your licence is valid. Any CoS that remain unused at the end of your CoS year will be removed from your SMS account. You cannot carry over any unused CoS to the next CoS year.\n\nS2.21. At the end of your CoS year, you will either:\n\nreceive an automatic allocation for the following CoS year equal to the number of CoS you assigned during the previous CoS year\n\nhave to make a ‘manual’ request via your SMS account for a further allocation (also known as a ‘follow-on’ allocation)\n\nS2.22. You will receive an automatic annual allocation if all of the following are true:\n\nyour licence is A-rated\n\nyour current annual CoS allocation is marked as ‘active’ in your SMS account\n\nyou are licensed on an eligible route, or routes\n\nS2.23. An ‘eligible route’ is any Worker or Temporary Worker route, except for the following routes (which are ineligible for automatic renewal):\n\nSeasonal Worker\n\nSecondment Worker\n\nService Supplier\n\nUK Expansion Worker\n\nS2.24. If you are eligible for automatic renewal, you will receive an annual allocation equal to the number of CoS you assigned during the previous CoS year. For example, if your allocation for CoS year 2023 to 2024 was 15, and you assigned 10 of those CoS, you will receive an allocation of 10 for 2024 to 2025. If you need any more CoS, you will have to make a manual request to increase your allocation.\n\nS2.25. If you are licensed on the Skilled Worker route, you will only receive an automatic allocation of Undefined CoS – you will need to continue to request Defined CoS as and when you need them, using the process set out in section SK12 of Sponsor a Skilled Worker.\n\nS2.26. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria for automatic renewal, you will need to submit a manual request via your SMS account (which will be considered by a UKVI caseworker). You can submit your request up to 3 months before the end of your CoS year.\n\nS2.27. For further guidance on how to renew and manage your CoS allocation, see guide 8 in SMS Manual 2: managing your licence.\n\nS3. Assigning a CoS\n\nContent in this section:\n\nTechnical guidance on completing a CoS\n\nYour sponsor rating (how this may affect whether you can assign a CoS)\n\nRestrictions on who a CoS can be assigned to\n\nInformation you must include on the CoS (including start and end dates, what to do if either of those change, and occupation codes)\n\nAmending or updating a CoS\n\nTechnical guidance on completing a CoS\n\nS3.1. Detailed information on how to assign a CoS, including how to complete an application for a Defined CoS for a Skilled Worker, or report changes to the details on the CoS, can be found in the Sponsorship management system (SMS) manuals – see, in particular, Manuals 8, 9, 11 and 12.\n\nS3.2. Sponsors are rated either A or B (except for sponsors on the UK Expansion Worker route where the Authorising Officer is based overseas, who will be given a ‘Provisional’ rating initially). We will not grant you a licence unless you are able to achieve an A-rating (or, in the case of UK Expansion Worker, at least a Provisional rating). In some cases, after your licence has been granted, we may downgrade you to a B rating if you are not meeting all of your sponsor duties or we have other concerns about you. For further information, see:\n\n‘Sponsor ratings’ in section L8 of Part 1: Apply for a licence\n\nsection C8 of Part 3: Sponsor duties and compliance\n\nfor UK Expansion Worker sponsors, section GBM3 of Sponsor a Global Business Mobility worker\n\nS3.3. If you are sponsoring a Scale-up Worker or a Seasonal Worker, you can only assign a CoS if you have an A-rating. For all other routes, you must be an A-rated sponsor, unless either of the following exceptions applies:\n\nyou are a B-rated sponsor and all of the following are true:\n\nthe worker is applying for permission to stay (from within the UK) on the same route as in their last grant of permission\n\nyou assigned the CoS which led to the worker’s last grant of permission\n\nyou are continuing to sponsor the worker\n\nyou are licensed on the UK Expansion Worker route, you have a Provisional rating, and the person you assigned a CoS to is your Authorising Officer\n\nS3.4. You cannot assign a CoS if your licence is suspended, made dormant, or revoked.\n\nRestrictions on who a CoS can be assigned to\n\nS3.5. An SMS User must not assign a CoS to themselves, to their partner or to a close relative of theirs. We will revoke your sponsor licence if we find out this has happened.\n\nS3.6. A partner or close relative means any of the following:\n\na spouse or civil partner\n\nan unmarried or a same-sex partner\n\na parent or step-parent\n\na son or step-son\n\na daughter or step-daughter\n\na brother, step-brother or half-brother\n\na sister, step-sister or half-sister\n\na nephew, niece, or cousin\n\nan aunt or uncle\n\na father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, son-in-law or daughter-in-law\n\nS3.7. The only exception to this is if you have a Provisional rating on the UK Expansion Worker route, in which case your Authorising Officer (who must also be the Level 1 User) must assign their own CoS to make an application for entry clearance. See section GBM3 of Sponsor a Global Business Mobility worker for more information.\n\nS3.8. An SMS User must add a sponsor note to the CoS if they are aware (or can reasonably be expected to be aware) they have assigned a CoS to a partner or close relative of somebody else who is working for the sponsor.\n\nInformation you must include on the CoS\n\nS3.9. When you assign a CoS, there is certain information you must include on it for it to be valid. This includes:\n\nthe route on which you are sponsoring the worker\n\npersonal details of the worker, such as their name, nationality, date of birth, passport details, contact address\n\nusual work address or addresses\n\ntotal weekly hours of work – if this varies, you should enter an average figure\n\ndetails of the worker’s job, including job title, job description, start date, end date, salary (unless applying as a Charity Worker) and occupation code\n\nwhether you used an agent (such as a recruitment agency, employment business or other intermediary) to find the worker and, if so, details of that agent\n\nwhether you (the sponsor) wish to certify that the worker meets the financial requirement\n\nfor some routes, whether the worker needs an Academic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS) certificate\n\nany other information required for the specific route in which you are sponsoring the worker – see the relevant route-specific guidance for details\n\nS3.10. You must enter a start date on the CoS. This should be the date you expect the worker to start working for you if their application is granted. If the worker is making an extension of permission to stay application, we recommend the start date is the day after the worker’s current permission ends.\n\nS3.11. The worker must use the CoS in an application for entry clearance or permission no more than 3 months after the date it was assigned to them. However, they cannot apply for entry clearance or permission more than 3 months in advance of their employment start date, as stated on their CoS. You must make sure the timing of your recruitment and the date you assign the CoS does not put the worker in a situation where they cannot make a successful application for entry clearance or permission.\n\nS3.12. If the start date (or end date) changes before the worker has applied for entry clearance or permission, or before a decision has been made on their application, you should report this, as this may affect the period of entry clearance or permission that can be granted. You can do this by:\n\nadding a sponsor note to the CoS, if the worker has not yet applied for entry clearance or permission\n\nusing the ‘Report migrant activity’ function in the SMS, if the worker has already submitted their application for entry clearance or permission\n\nS3.13. A worker can start working in their sponsored employment as soon as they have permission to enter or stay in the UK, even if this is before the start date recorded on their CoS. You do not have tell us if the worker’s start date has been brought forward after they have been granted permission.\n\nS3.14. Once a worker has been granted permission, they should normally start working in their sponsored employment no later than 28 days after whichever is the latest of:\n\nthe start date on their CoS (taking into account any changes to that date reported by you before their application for entry clearance or permission was decided)\n\nthe “valid from” date on the worker’s entry clearance vignette (visa)\n\nthe date the worker is granted permission to enter, if they entered the UK without entry clearance under the Creative Worker visa concession (see section CRW6 of Sponsor a Creative Worker for details of this concession)\n\nthe date the worker is notified of a grant of entry clearance or permission to stay\n\nS3.15. If the worker does not start employment by the end of this period, you must either:\n\ntell us the worker’s new start date and the reasons for the delayed start, if you wish to continue sponsoring them\n\nstop sponsoring the worker\n\nS3.16. In either case, you must report this by the end of 10 working days after the 28-day period using the ‘Report migrant activity’ function in the SMS.\n\nS3.17. If you wish to continue sponsoring the worker, you should be aware that UKVI may cancel the worker’s permission if they do not consider there is a valid reason for the delayed start. You must therefore ensure you carry out a right to work check before they start their employment, and any follow-up checks as required. If the worker tells you their permission has been cancelled, you must stop sponsoring them and report this within 10 working days via your SMS account.\n\nS3.18. Acceptable reasons for a delayed start may include:\n\ntravel disruption due to a natural disaster, military conflict or pandemic\n\nthe worker is required to work out a contractual notice period for their previous employer – if the worker is in the UK, their conditions of stay must allow them to do this\n\nthe worker requires an exit visa from their home country and there have been administrative delays in processing this\n\nillness, bereavement or other compelling family or personal circumstances\n\nS3.19. This is not a comprehensive list and each case will be judged on its merits.\n\nS3.20. You do not have to report a change to start date (where the worker has been granted permission) if it is delayed by no more than 28 days (as defined in paragraph S3.14 above).\n\nS3.21. If you are sponsoring a Scale-up Worker and they are granted entry clearance or permission to stay, you must also tell us the date the worker actually starts working for you via the ‘Report migrant activity’ function in the SMS. You must do this within 10 working days of the actual start date.\n\nS3.22. Unless you are sponsoring a Scale-up Worker, you must enter an end date on the CoS. This should cover the period you intend to sponsor the worker, up to the maximum period permitted for the route on which you are sponsoring them.\n\nS3.23. ‘Maximum period’ means the maximum period of entry clearance or permission that can be granted on the relevant route if the worker’s application is successful (excluding any additional period that may be granted beyond the work end date). For example, if you are sponsoring a Skilled Worker, you can assign a CoS for up to 5 years.\n\nS3.24. In some cases, the SMS will prevent you from assigning a CoS beyond the maximum period. However, there may be other restrictions on how long you should assign a CoS on a particular route or to a particular type of worker. For example:\n\nif you are sponsoring an International Sportsperson, you must not assign a CoS beyond the period stated on the worker’s sports governing body endorsement letter\n\nif you are sponsoring a Skilled Worker who intends to claim points for being a ‘new entrant’, the longest you can assign the CoS is 4 years (less any time the worker has already spent in the UK as a new entrant on the Skilled Worker or Tier 2 (General) routes, or on the Graduate route)\n\nmost routes have a maximum cumulative period for which a worker can be granted (including time they’ve already spent in the UK on that route) – for example, a Charity Worker cannot be granted beyond 12 months in total\n\nS3.25. If you assign a CoS for longer than the maximum period permitted on the route, we will do one of the following:\n\nlimit the amount of permission we will grant to the worker if they make a successful application for entry clearance or permission\n\nrefuse the application, if the worker has already spent the maximum period permitted on that route\n\nif you are sponsoring a Government Authorised Exchange worker or Seasonal Worker, report you to the relevant endorsing government department – if they then withdraw their endorsement, we will revoke your sponsor licence\n\nS3.26. Read the relevant route-specific guidance for further information on maximum periods.\n\nS3.27. You do not have to enter an end date if you are sponsoring a Scale-up Worker but you must confirm (when you complete the CoS declaration) that the worker is expected to work for you for at least the first 6 months of their permission.\n\nOccupation code\n\nS3.28. When you assign a CoS to a worker, you must specify the 4-digit occupation code (also known as the ‘standard occupational classification (SOC)’ code) relevant to the job. The SOC is a common classification of occupations developed by the Office for National Statistics.\n\nS3.29. For CoS assigned on or after 4 April 2024, you must specify the relevant SOC 2020 occupation code from Appendix Skilled Occupations. The SOC 2020 system has replaced the SOC 2010 system previously in use. SOC 2010 occupation codes remain valid for CoS assigned on or before 3 April 2024.\n\nS3.30. Appendix Skilled Occupations contains information about each occupation code, including example job titles that fit within each code, whether the code is eligible for PhD points on the Skilled Worker route, or whether it is eligible for the Global Business Mobility (GBM) or Scale-up routes. Tables 1 to 5 also include information about the applicable salary ‘going rates’ for the Skilled Worker, GBM and Scale-up routes.\n\nS3.31. If you are sponsoring a Skilled Worker, the job must be in an occupation code (or an eligible job within an occupation code) listed in Table 1, 2, 2a or 3 of Appendix Skilled Occupations, depending on the option the worker is claiming salary points under. Occupations in Table 2a are only eligible if the worker had permission under the Immigration Rules in force before 4 April 2024 and you are continuing to sponsor that worker. See section SK6 of Sponsor a Skilled Worker for further information.\n\nS3.32. If you are sponsoring a worker on any of the GBM routes, the job must be in an occupation code listed as eligible for the GBM routes in Table 2, 2b or 3 of Appendix Skilled Occupations. Occupations in Table 2b are only eligible under a transitional provision. There is an exception for Service Suppliers, who may satisfy the skill-level requirement if they have a degree or other eligible qualification and relevant professional experience. In all other cases, if the job is not listed as eligible for the GBM routes, it is not eligible to be sponsored. See section GBM6 of Sponsor a Global Business Mobility worker for further information.\n\nS3.33. If you are sponsoring a Scale-up Worker, the job must be in an occupation code listed as eligible for the Scale-up route in either Table 2 or Table 3 of Appendix Skilled Occupations. For further information, see section SC4 of Sponsor a Scale-up Worker.\n\nS3.34. If you are sponsoring a worker on the Government Authorised Exchange route, the job must be in an occupation code in Table 1, 2 or 3 of Appendix Skilled Occupations. For further information, see section GA3 of Sponsor a Government Authorised Exchange worker.\n\nS3.35. Table 6 of Appendix Skilled Occupations lists occupations which are not eligible for the Skilled Worker, GBM (other than Service Suppliers in specified circumstances) or Scale-up routes. They are also ineligible for the Government Authorised Exchange route.\n\nS3.36. For routes other than those listed above, the job can be in any table of Appendix Skilled Occupations (including Table 6) but it must meet the relevant eligibility criteria for the particular route. For further information, see the relevant route-specific guidance.\n\nS3.37. You are responsible for choosing the correct occupation code – we cannot help you with this. If you are unsure which code to select, there is detailed guidance on the SOC 2020 system on the Office for National Statistics website. The University of Warwick has also developed a Computer Assisted Structured Coding Tool (CASCOT) which can help you choose the correct SOC 2020 code.\n\nS3.38. It is essential that you select the correct occupation code. If you use the wrong occupation code when assigning a CoS or applying for a Skilled Worker Defined CoS, this could lead to an application being delayed or refused. If you have provided false, misleading or otherwise incorrect information about the skill or salary level of the job on a CoS – for example, to enable the worker to score points on the Skilled Worker or GBM routes – we will take compliance action against you. This could include revoking your sponsor licence. For further information, see Part 3: Sponsor duties and compliance.\n\n‘Multiple-entry’ CoS\n\nS3.39. If a worker is likely to need to travel abroad regularly in connection with their job, you may choose to tick the ‘multiple-entry’ option on the CoS, although you do not have to. For further information, see Leaving and returning to the UK.\n\nGroup CoS for Creative Workers\n\nS3.40. If you are sponsoring a group of people (for example, all members of a musical group or dance troupe, or a creative worker and their entourage) on the Creative Worker route, you can assign a ‘group CoS’ to all members of the group. See Sponsor a Creative Worker for information on this.\n\nAmending or updating a CoS\n\nif the CoS is for a Skilled Worker applying for a Health and Care visa, you can use the sponsor note field to explain how the worker is eligible for that visa\n\nif the CoS is for a Religious Worker, you must explain how the resident labour consideration has been met by adding a sponsor note\n\nS3.42. You can only add a sponsor note to a CoS that is showing in your SMS account with the status of ‘Assigned’. If you need to report any changes after a CoS has been used, you must use the ‘Report migrant activity’ function in the SMS. For further information, see SMS Manual 9: Reporting worker activity.\n\nCorrecting a minor error on a CoS\n\nS3.43. You can use the sponsor note feature to amend a minor error on a CoS with the status of ‘assigned’, such as a mistyped name or date of birth. However, if you make more than one error in the worker’s personal details, you will normally need to assign a new CoS (see below).\n\nSignificant error on the CoS\n\nS3.44. You must withdraw a CoS and assign a new one if you’ve made a significant error such as:\n\nyou’ve entered the wrong occupation code\n\nyou’ve assigned the CoS on the wrong route, or in the wrong sub-category\n\nyou’ve given incorrect details for more than one of the following:\n\nthe worker’s nationality\n\nthe worker’s date of birth\n\nthe worker’s surname\n\nS4. Pay and conditions for sponsored workers\n\nContent in this section:\n\nHow much you have to pay your workers\n\nCompliance with National Minimum Wage and the Working Time Regulations\n\nSalary information you must include on a CoS\n\nHow you can pay your workers\n\nAbsence from work without pay or on reduced pay\n\nSalary otherwise reduced\n\nHow much you have to pay your workers\n\nS4.1. If you are sponsoring a Skilled Worker, Senior or Specialist Worker, Graduate Trainee, UK Expansion Worker, Scale-up Worker or Seasonal Worker, you must ensure the worker’s salary meets or exceeds the relevant salary thresholds for those routes, as set out in the Immigration Rules and route-specific guidance. We will refuse any application for entry clearance or permission, and reject any application for a Skilled Worker Defined CoS, if we are not satisfied the worker will be paid the appropriate salary.\n\nS4.2. In all cases (even if the Rules or this guidance do not specify a minimum salary threshold for a particular route), you must ensure the worker will be paid in accordance with National Minimum Wage legislation and the role will comply with the Working Time Regulations.\n\nS4.3. There are limited circumstances in which a worker can be paid less than the relevant salary threshold, or the amount stated on their CoS. You will normally need to report any salary reductions to us and the worker may need to make a new application for permission – see:\n\nAbsence from work without pay or on reduced pay\n\nSalary otherwise reduced\n\nS4.4. We will make regular checks with HMRC (and, where necessary, compliance checks) to ensure you are paying your sponsored workers the amount you said you would. Unless an exception applies, if we find you are paying them less, and the new amount would not be eligible for a grant of permission on the relevant route, we will cancel the worker’s permission and take compliance action against you – this could include revoking your licence.\n\nS4.5. For more information on the salary requirements for the route in which you are sponsoring the worker, refer to the relevant route-specific guidance.\n\nCompliance with National Minimum Wage and the Working Time Regulations\n\nS4.6. The role you are sponsoring the worker for must always comply with both the:\n\nNational Minimum Wage Regulations 2015\n\nWorking Time Regulations 1998\n\nS4.7. We will refuse an application for entry clearance or permission, or reject an application for a Skilled Worker Defined CoS, if we have reasonable grounds to believe the role does not comply with these regulations. We will also normally revoke your licence if we find you are breaching these regulations.\n\nNational Minimum Wage\n\nS4.8. The worker’s pay must always comply with National Minimum Wage legislation. If you are sponsoring a worker on a route with a minimum salary threshold (Skilled Worker, Senior or Specialist Worker, Graduate Trainee, UK Expansion Worker, Scale-up, or Seasonal Worker), and their salary meets or exceeds the relevant threshold, it is likely to be compliant with National Minimum Wage. However, National Minimum Wage legislation is complex and contains provisions not expressly covered by the Immigration Rules or sponsor guidance. It is your responsibility to ensure you are compliant with these.\n\nS4.9. If you will not be paying National Minimum Wage to a worker because an exemption in the legislation applies, you must explain this when you assign a CoS. You can do this either in the salary details box or by adding a sponsor note.\n\nS4.10. For guidance on National Minimum Wage, how to calculate it, and exceptions, see:\n\nThe National Minimum Wage and Living Wage\n\nMinimum wage for different types of work\n\nCalculating the minimum wage – Department for Business and Trade guidance\n\nNational Minimum Wage – HMRC technical guidance\n\nWorking Time Regulations\n\nS4.11. The Working Time Regulations provide a number of important protections for workers on things like maximum weekly working hours, holiday entitlement and rest breaks. You must ensure the role you are sponsoring the worker for complies with these.\n\nS4.12. For example, a worker aged 18 or over can choose to work more than 48 hours per week but, unless an exception in the Working Time Regulations applies, you cannot force them to do this.\n\nS4.13. For detailed guidance on the Working Time Regulations, see:\n\nMaximum weekly working hours\n\nHoliday entitlement\n\nRest breaks at work\n\nNight working hours\n\nSalary information you must include on a CoS\n\nS4.14. When you assign a CoS to a worker, you must give the following information about the salary package:\n\nthe gross salary figure, which must:\n\nrepresent the total amount paid to the worker, gross of any tax paid, whether paid in the UK or overseas\n\nif the worker is being sponsored on the Skilled Worker route, not include any allowances, unless an exception applies – see Sponsor a Skilled Worker for information\n\nfor routes other than Skilled Worker, include any permitted allowances and guaranteed bonuses\n\na separate figure for the total of all allowances and guaranteed bonuses (where these are permitted by the route)\n\na detailed breakdown of each allowance and each guaranteed bonus showing their value (where these are permitted by the route)\n\nif you are sponsoring a Skilled Worker, Senior or Specialist Worker, Graduate Trainee, UK Expansion Worker, or Scale-up Worker, the PAYE scheme reference number through which the worker will pay tax and national insurance – if you are not required to operate PAYE on that worker’s earnings, you must explain this (you cannot sponsor a Scale-up Worker who will not be paid through PAYE)\n\nS4.15. The figure you give for the gross salary must not be inflated in expectation of any tax relief, such as relief on expenditure related to the employment, or tax incurred by the employment of a settled worker, but not incurred for a sponsored worker. For example, if the gross salary package is £34,500 per year, but the sponsored worker will have the same net package after tax as a settled worker who is paid £40,000 per year before tax, the CoS must show that the salary package is £34,500, not £40,000.\n\nPeriod the salary must cover\n\nS4.16. When you assign a CoS to a worker, or apply for a defined CoS for them, the gross salary figure you enter can cover any of the following time periods:\n\nhour\n\nday\n\nweek\n\nmonth\n\nyear (this option is not available for Seasonal Workers)\n\ncontract (this option is not available for Skilled Workers or Scale-up Workers)\n\nperformance (International Sportsperson and Creative Worker only)\n\nHow you can pay your workers\n\nS4.17. Salary may be paid in the UK or abroad. Where the worker will be paid from abroad in a currency other than pounds sterling, the salary entered on the CoS must be based on the exchange rate for the relevant currency on the day the CoS is assigned, taken from the rates published on OANDA. If you are applying for a Defined CoS for a Skilled Worker, the amount must reflect the exchange rate on the date you requested that CoS. You should update this, by adding a ‘sponsor note’, when you assign the CoS to a worker.\n\nS4.18. All payments to sponsored workers must be made into their own bank account in the UK or overseas. You must not pay them in cash – if you do, we are likely to revoke your licence. Pre-paid cards such as FOREX are acceptable, but you must be able to give evidence that you have made payments onto the worker’s card. If you pay the worker by cheque, this must be paid into the worker’s own bank account.\n\nAbsence from work without pay or on reduced pay\n\nS4.19. Unless a valid exception reason applies, you must normally stop sponsoring a worker who is absent from their sponsored work without pay, or is absent on reduced pay, for more than 4 weeks in total during either:\n\nif the worker is a Scale-up Worker, the period you have sponsorship responsibility for that worker\n\nin all other cases, in any calendar year (1 January to 31 December)\n\nS4.20. This applies whether the worker is absent from work for a single period of more than 4 weeks, or if they have a number of absences which cumulatively total more than 4 weeks.\n\nS4.21. The 4 weeks is calculated according to the sponsored worker’s normal working pattern. For example, if the worker normally works 5 days per week, this would be 20 working days (5 (days) x 4 (weeks)). If they normally work 3 days per week, this would be 12 working days (3 (days) x 4 (weeks)).\n\nS4.22. If a worker has been, or will be, absent from work without pay, or on reduced pay, for more than 4 weeks in total (as defined above), you must either:\n\nstop sponsoring the worker and report this via your SMS account\n\nif the period of absence is due to a valid exception reason, or you believe there are compelling reasons for you to continue sponsoring the worker, report the period of absence (including reasons, duration and any changes to salary) via your SMS account\n\nS4.23. You must also tell us if a sponsored worker has been absent from work for more than 10 working days without your permission (‘unauthorised absence’), whether or not you make any salary reductions for the period of unauthorised absence.\n\nS4.24. You do not have to report shorter absences without pay, or on reduced pay. However, you may find doing so will help you monitor whether a sponsored worker has exceeded, or is likely to exceed, the permitted periods of absence.\n\nS4.25. For more information on your reporting duties, including time limits for reporting changes, see section C1 of Part 3: Sponsor duties and compliance.\n\nValid exception reasons: permissible absences\n\nS4.26. The following are permissible absences. You do not have to stop sponsoring a worker if they are absent without pay, or on reduced pay, for any of the reasons listed below (and they would not otherwise have been absent without pay, or on reduced pay, for more than 4 weeks):\n\nstatutory maternity leave\n\nstatutory paternity leave\n\nstatutory parental leave\n\nstatutory shared parental leave\n\nstatutory adoption leave\n\nsick leave\n\nassisting with a national or an international humanitarian or environmental crisis, provided you agreed to the absence for that purpose\n\ntaking part in legally organised industrial action\n\njury service\n\nattending court as a witness\n\nS4.27. However, you should still report the period of absence via your SMS account, as outlined above.\n\nS4.28. If a valid exception reason does not apply but you believe there are compelling reasons for you to continue sponsoring a worker who has been absent from work without pay, or on reduced pay, for more than 4 weeks, you must report the absence and reasons via your SMS account for UKVI to consider. You should be aware that UKVI may cancel the worker’s permission if they are not satisfied there is a satisfactory reason for continuing to sponsor the worker. If this happens, you must stop sponsoring the worker.\n\nSalary otherwise reduced\n\nS4.29. You must tell us via your SMS account if a worker’s salary is reduced for a reason not related to absence after you have assigned a CoS (including after they have been granted entry clearance or permission). If you are sponsoring a Skilled Worker or Tier 2 (General) Migrant, you must check if you will need to assign a new CoS (and if the worker will need to apply for new permission) before you can reduce their salary. See section SK8 of Sponsor a Skilled Worker for further information.\n\nS4.30. You must stop sponsoring the worker if their revised salary no longer meets any salary, hourly or going rate requirement for the job or the route on which they are being sponsored, or the change is otherwise not permitted by the Immigration Rules or sponsor guidance. You must tell us you have stopped sponsoring the worker via your SMS account.\n\nSalary reductions: exceptions\n\nS4.31. You do not have to stop sponsoring a worker if you reduce their salary and any of the following exceptions apply (although you must tell us via your SMS account that you have reduced the worker’s salary):\n\nthe reduction coincides with a temporary reduction in the worker’s hours, or a phased return to work, for individual health reasons, provided:\n\nthis is supported by an occupational health assessment; and\n\nthe reduction does not result in the hourly rate falling below any hourly rate requirement which applied when the person obtained their most recent grant of permission\n\nthe worker is on a GBM route and a temporary reduction in salary coincides with working for the sponsor group or linked overseas business while the worker is not physically present in the UK\n\nthe person is a Skilled Worker, GBM worker or Scale-up Worker and, after the change in salary, would continue to be eligible for points for salary, as set out in Sponsor a Skilled Worker, Sponsor a Global Business Mobility worker, or Sponsor a Scale-up Worker\n\nthe person is a Skilled Worker and the reduction in salary has been authorised as a result of a grant of new entry clearance or permission to stay\n\nthe worker otherwise continues to meet the salary requirements on the route on which they are being sponsored\n\nS5. Immigration Skills Charge\n\nThis section tells you about the Immigration Skills Charge you may have to pay to sponsor a Skilled Worker or a Senior or Specialist worker.\n\nContent in this section:\n\nAbout the charge\n\nWhen you have to pay\n\nWhen you don’t have to pay\n\nConsequences of non-payment\n\nRefunds and ‘top-up’ charges\n\nHow TUPE or similar protection affects the Immigration Skills Charge\n\nAbout the charge\n\nS5.1. You may have to pay the Immigration Skills Charge each time you assign a Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) to a Skilled Worker or a Senior or Specialist Worker.\n\nS5.2. The amount you have to pay is specified in the Schedule to the Immigration Skills Charge Regulations 2017 and depends on:\n\nthe size and type of your organisation on the date you assign the worker’s CoS\n\nthe length of employment stated on the CoS\n\nS5.3. If you are a small or charitable sponsor, as defined in regulation 2 of the Immigration Skills Charge Regulations, you will pay the ‘small’ charge:\n\n£364 for any stated period of employment up to 12 months\n\nan additional £182 for each subsequent 6-month period stated on the CoS\n\nS5.4. In all other cases, you must pay the ‘large’ charge:\n\n£1,000 for any stated period of employment up to 12 months\n\nan additional £500 for each subsequent 6-month period stated on the CoS\n\nS5.5. When you apply for a licence, it is essential that you select the correct size or type for your organisation, as this will determine not only the licence fee you will pay, but also the level of Immigration Skills Charge you will pay throughout the life of your licence, or until you tell us of a change of circumstances through the sponsorship management system (SMS) and this has been processed and accepted by UKVI.\n\nS5.6. To comply with your reporting duties, you must tell us as soon as possible – and in any case within 20 working days – if the size or type of your organisation changes. This will ensure you pay the correct Immigration Skills Charge for each CoS you assign. If you fail to inform us within 20 working days, we may take compliance action against you. This could include downgrading, suspending or revoking your licence. For further information on reporting changes to your organisation, see section C2 of Part 3: Sponsor duties and compliance.\n\nS5.7. You must not pass on any of the charge to, or attempt to recoup it from, the sponsored worker. If we find out that you have done so, we will normally revoke your licence.\n\nWhen you have to pay\n\nS5.8. Unless an exception applies, you must pay the charge each time you assign a CoS to a Skilled Worker or a Senior or Specialist Worker and the worker is either:\n\napplying from outside the UK for entry clearance (a visa) to work in the UK for 6 months or more\n\napplying from within the UK for permission to stay of any duration, including for less than 6 months\n\nWhen you don’t have to pay\n\nS5.9. You do not have to pay the charge if you assign a CoS to any of the following:\n\na worker who is applying for entry clearance from outside the UK for a period of less than 6 months\n\na worker who is being sponsored for any of the following occupations:\n\n2111 Chemical scientists\n\n2112 Biological scientists\n\n2113 Biochemists and biomedical scientists\n\n2114 Physical scientists\n\n2115 Social and humanities scientists\n\n2119 Natural and social science professionals not elsewhere classified\n\n2161 Research and development (R&D) managers\n\n2162 Other researchers, unspecified discipline\n\n2311 Higher education teaching professionals\n\na worker you have previously assigned a CoS to (or who has transferred to you under TUPE or similar protection) where:\n\nyou assign them a new CoS to work for you; and\n\nthe new period of permission they are seeking will not exceed their current period of permission – if the application would result in a longer grant of permission, you must pay a charge for the additional period that would be granted, unless another exemption applies\n\na worker who has valid permission for the purpose of study (see below for an explanation of what we mean by ‘valid permission for the purpose of study’)\n\na worker who had valid permission for the purpose of study when you previously sponsored them (and you therefore did not have to pay the charge), and you assign a new CoS to that worker to continue sponsoring them in the same role (see also How TUPE or similar protection affects the Immigration Skills Charge below)\n\na worker who was assigned a CoS under Tier 2 (General) or Tier 2 (ICT) Long-term Staff before 6 April 2017 and all of the following are true:\n\nthat CoS resulted in a grant of entry clearance or permission to stay\n\nthe worker undertook the role for which that CoS was assigned\n\nthe worker has not since ceased to have permission under Skilled Worker (or its predecessor route, Tier 2 (General)) or Senior or Specialist Worker (or its predecessor routes, Intra-Company Transfer, or the Long-term Staff sub-category of Tier 2 (Intra-Company Transfer))\n\na Senior or Specialist Worker who benefits from the ‘EU-UK Trade and Co-operation Agreement’ exemption – this applies if all of the following requirements are met:\n\nyou assign the CoS to the worker on or after 1 January 2023\n\nthe worker is a national of an EU country or is a Latvian non-citizen (this concession does not apply if the worker is a national of Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein or Switzerland)\n\nthe worker has been assigned to the UK by a business established in the EU, and which forms part of the same “sponsor group”, as defined in Sponsor a Global Business Mobility Worker\n\nthe worker has worked for the sponsor group for at least one year before the CoS was assigned\n\nthe end date of the assignment, as specified on the CoS, is no more than 36 months after the start date\n\nS5.10. You do not have to pay the charge for any of the worker’s family members (dependants) who are not themselves sponsored workers on the Skilled Worker or Senior or Specialist Worker routes. The charge does not apply to any other Worker or Temporary Worker route.\n\n‘Valid permission for the purpose of study’\n\nS5.11. This exemption applies if the worker you are assigning a CoS to has current permission on one of the following routes:\n\nStudent\n\nChild Student\n\nTier 4 (General)\n\nTier 4 (Child)\n\nShort-term Student (English Language)\n\nS5.12. The exemption applies whether or not the worker is in the UK, provided they have current permission on one of the above routes on the date you assign the CoS. However, where the person has permission as a Short-term Student, they must make their application from outside the UK, as they will not normally be allowed to ‘switch’ to either the Skilled Worker route or the Senior or Specialist Worker route from within the UK.\n\nS5.13. This exemption does not apply if the worker’s permission:\n\nhas already expired by the time you assign the CoS\n\nis on any route not listed above – for the avoidance of doubt, you will not be exempt from paying the charge if the worker’s permission is as a Graduate or as a dependant of someone on one of the study routes listed above\n\nS5.14. If this exemption applies, you will continue to be exempt if you later assign a new CoS to the same worker to continue working in the same role. See also How TUPE or similar protection affects the Immigration Skills Charge below.\n\nConsequences of non-payment\n\nS5.15. Any CoS you have assigned which requires the charge to be paid will become and remain invalid until the outstanding charge is paid in full. This means any application for entry clearance or permission to stay made on the basis of that CoS will be delayed until the charge is paid in full.\n\nS5.16. UKVI will contact you if you have not paid the charge or have not paid the full amount when you assigned the CoS.\n\nS5.17. The worker’s entry clearance or permission to stay application will be refused if you fail to pay the full amount within 10 working days of the first formal reminder to make the payment.\n\nRefunds and ‘top-up’ charges\n\nS5.18. The Secretary of State may refund all or part of the charge. A refund will be paid to the debit or credit card the charge was paid with, unless you advise us of different payment arrangements. In some cases, we may need to request a ‘top-up’ charge (an additional amount from you) if you have not paid the full amount you owe.\n\nPartial refund\n\nS5.19. A partial refund will be made for all whole unused 6-month periods of permission after the first year of employment where the worker:\n\nis granted permission for less than the period requested on the CoS – for example, if a 5-year visa was applied for, but a 3-year visa is granted, the difference between the period requested and the period granted will be refunded (in this example, £2,000 for a large sponsor or £728 for a small sponsor or charity)\n\nstarts work for one sponsor, but then voluntarily changes to another sponsor – the first sponsor will be paid the difference between the charge paid and the charge payable for the length of time the individual has worked for the first sponsor\n\nleaves their post early – for example, if they return home due to ill health, are made redundant or dismissed, fail their probation, or fail to secure a necessary professional qualification\n\nPartial refund due to change in size or charitable status\n\nS5.20. A partial refund will also be made if both of the following are true:\n\nyou assign a CoS to a worker and pay the large fee\n\nbefore you assigned that CoS, you had notified us that your company had changed from large to small, or gained charitable status, and we have verified this information\n\nS5.21. In these circumstances, we will refund the difference between the large fee and the small fee once we have verified the information you have provided. We will only issue refunds for CoS issued on or after the date you notified us of your change in status. It is therefore important you tell us of any change in status as soon as possible.\n\nFull refund\n\nS5.22. A full refund will be paid where the worker’s application for entry clearance or permission to stay is:\n\nrefused\n\nwithdrawn; or\n\ngranted but the worker does not travel to the UK or start work for the sponsor\n\nS5.23. A full refund will also be made if the relevant CoS is not used to make a valid application for entry clearance or permission to stay.\n\nHow soon decisions on refunds are made\n\nS5.24. Decisions on refunds are made within 90 days of the relevant event:\n\nthe date you notified UKVI via the SMS that the worker didn’t come to the UK to start work or has left the relevant employment early\n\nthe CoS expiry date, if no valid visa application is made by the worker – a CoS expires if not used within 3 months of the date it was assigned\n\nthe date you notified UKVI that you had withdrawn the CoS\n\nthe deadline date for making an administrative review application, if the worker’s visa application has been refused and they have not applied for an administrative review\n\nthe worker’s administrative review being dismissed\n\nthe date you notified us of the change in your organisation’s size or charitable status\n\nContact UKVI if your refund hasn’t been paid within 90 days of the relevant date.\n\nCircumstances in which no refund will be made\n\nS5.25. We will not refund any of the Immigration Skills Charge in the following circumstances:\n\nthe worker changes job but remains working for the same employer\n\nthe worker changes (‘switches’) from the Skilled Worker or Senior or Specialist Worker route to another immigration route but remains employed in the same job\n\nyour licence is made ‘dormant’ (for example, following a takeover of your company)\n\nyour licence is revoked\n\nthe worker’s permission is cancelled (unless the reason for cancellation is because the worker failed to start the relevant employment or finished the employment early – a full or partial refund may be paid in these circumstances)\n\nTop-up charges\n\nS5.26. We will request additional funds (a top-up charge) if both of the following are true:\n\nyou assign a CoS to a worker and pay the small fee\n\nbefore you assigned that CoS, you had notified us that you no longer qualify as a small or charitable sponsor, and we have verified this information\n\nS5.27. In these circumstances, we will request a top-up charge (the difference between the small fee and the large fee) for any CoS you have assigned on or after the date you notified us of your change in status.\n\nS5.28. We will also request a top-up charge in any case where you do not pay the full charge (or any charge) for any other reason. See ‘Consequences of non-payment’ above for what happens if you fail to pay the charge in full.\n\nHow TUPE or similar protection affects the Immigration Skills Charge\n\nS5.29. If a sponsored worker transfers to you under the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) (TUPE) Regulations or similar protection, you do not have to pay the Immigration Skills Charge if the worker still has valid permission and is not changing role.\n\nS5.30. You will need to pay the charge if you later assign a CoS to sponsor an application by that worker for further permission, unless an exemption applies. You will not have to pay the charge if the previous sponsor was exempt from paying it and either of the following is true:\n\nthe new CoS will not result in the worker’s permission being longer than their existing permission\n\nthe previous sponsor was exempt because the worker had valid permission for the purpose of study when they were originally sponsored and you are continuing to sponsor that worker in the same role\n\nS5.31. For further information on TUPE and similar protection, see section C4 of Part 3: Sponsor duties and compliance.\n\nS6. After you have assigned a CoS\n\nContent in this section:\n\nUsing the CoS in an immigration application\n\nCancelling or withdrawing a CoS\n\nProviding immigration advice or immigration services to your sponsored workers or students\n\nUsing the CoS in an immigration application\n\nS6.1. Once you have assigned a valid CoS to a worker, and you have paid any Immigration Skills Charge, if required, they can use it to make an application for entry clearance, permission to enter or permission to stay.\n\nS6.2. When you assign a CoS, a reference number is generated and you must give this number to the worker you wish to sponsor. They must then include the reference number in their application for entry clearance, permission to enter or permission to stay. When you give the CoS reference number to the worker, you should treat it as secure and confidential information.\n\nS6.3. You can give the worker a copy of their CoS if they ask for it (although they do not need it to make an immigration application). There is a function within your SMS account to print any CoS you have assigned. You can do this by using the ‘View CoS’ function, where you can open the CoS and choose ‘Print’. The SMS user guide has more information on how to use this function.\n\nS6.4. When a CoS you have assigned has been used to support an application, it will show in your SMS account as ‘used’. This means it cannot be used again in another application. The only exception is where the CoS has been assigned to and used by a worker to enter the UK under the Creative Worker visa concession. These workers can use the same CoS each time they re-enter the UK under this concession, provided the CoS is still valid and they continue to qualify for entry under the concession.\n\nS6.5. If a worker’s application is refused and they wish to re-apply, you must assign a new CoS to them before they can make a new application.\n\nS6.6. If the worker’s application is rejected or withdrawn (but not refused), the CoS will still show in your SMS account as ‘assigned’. It can be used again to support a further application by the same individual, provided it has not expired (see next paragraph).\n\nS6.7. Once you have assigned a CoS, the worker must use it in an application for entry clearance or permission no later than 3 months after the date you assigned it. If the worker does not use the CoS within this 3-month period to make an application, it will expire and will show as ‘expired’ in your SMS account. If the worker still wishes to make an application, you will need to assign them a new CoS.\n\nHow to make an immigration application\n\nS6.8. Once the worker is ready to make an application for entry clearance or permission to stay, they must:\n\ncomplete the relevant online application form – the relevant forms can be found in the Work visas section of the GOV.UK website\n\npay the application fee – see the UK visa fees page on GOV.UK\n\npay the immigration health charge, if required\n\nprove their identity (and provide any required biometrics) by either:\n\nattending a biometric appointment at a visa application centre\n\nif eligible, using the ‘UK Immigration: ID Check’ app\n\nin some cases, take a tuberculosis test\n\nprovide all relevant documents and information with their application, as specified in the application form or guidance notes\n\nS6.9. Different arrangements are in place for people eligible to enter the UK without entry clearance under the Creative Worker visa concession.\n\nS6.10. All applications for entry clearance or permission to stay must now be made online. As the sponsor, you should be prepared to give the worker any assistance they need to complete the online application. This could include allowing them to access a computer on your premises if the person would not otherwise have access to a computer or the internet, or by offering technical support to those who do not have the ability or confidence to use online services on their own.\n\nS6.11. You may also, subject to certain restrictions, provide immigration advice or immigration services to individuals you are sponsoring.\n\nCancelling or withdrawing a CoS\n\nS6.12. We can cancel a CoS assigned by you if we find it should not have been assigned – for example, if it was assigned through misrepresentation or fraud, or if you have not paid the correct CoS fee in full.\n\nS6.13. You can withdraw a CoS assigned to an individual which has not yet been used to support an application for entry clearance, permission to enter or permission to stay. This can be done through your SMS account.\n\nS6.14. A worker can normally only have one CoS assigned to them for use in an application at any given time. The only exception to this is where the worker is undertaking ‘consecutive engagements’ with more than one sponsor on the Creative Worker route.\n\nS6.15. If you have assigned a CoS to a person who intended to start working for you, but they then decided to take up a job offer with a different sponsor, they must contact you to arrange the withdrawal of their CoS. This is because the sponsor they want to start work with will not be able to assign a CoS to them until you have withdrawn the one you assigned. They must request this in writing or by email and give you 5 working days to withdraw the CoS. If you do not carry out their request, they must send a reminder, after which you will have a further 5 working days to withdraw it.\n\nS6.16. If you refuse or fail to withdraw the CoS within this time, the individual can ask us to cancel it. We will not cancel it until we have talked to you about why you have not withdrawn the CoS as requested by the individual. We may take compliance action against you if you fail to withdraw a CoS when requested within the specified time limit.\n\nS6.17. If a CoS is cancelled or withdrawn, we will not refund your CoS fee and we will refuse any application that is supported by that CoS.\n\nS6.18. If a worker is in the UK with entry clearance or permission, we will cancel or shorten their permission if we find the CoS which supported their application was improperly assigned. If this happens, their permission will be cancelled or shortened in one of the following ways:\n\nif they were not actively involved in the CoS being improperly assigned, permission will normally be shortened so they have 60 days’ permission remaining to give them a chance to find a new sponsor, apply on another immigration route or make arrangements to leave the UK (we will not shorten their permission if they already have no more than 60 days’ permission remaining)\n\nif they were actively involved in the CoS being improperly assigned, their permission will be cancelled completely so that they have no permission remaining and will be required to leave the UK immediately.\n\nProviding immigration advice or immigration services to your sponsored workers or students\n\nS6.19. It is prohibited under section 84(1) of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, and a criminal offence under section 91(1) of that Act, to provide immigration advice or immigration services if you are not one of the following:\n\nregistered with the Office of the Immigration Services Commissioner (OISC)\n\nauthorised by either a designated professional body or a designated qualifying regulator\n\nacting on behalf of and under the supervision of a person who meets either of the above requirements\n\notherwise exempt\n\nS6.20. Licensed sponsors are exempt from the general prohibition, although this will apply only in specified circumstances. As a licensed sponsor, you can provide immigration advice and immigration services, free of charge, to individuals you are sponsoring (and, where relevant, their eligible family members), within the limits set out in the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (Part 5 Exemption: Licensed Sponsors) Order 2022 (‘the 2022 Order’).\n\nS6.21. This Order has replaced the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (Part V Exemption: Licensed Sponsors Tiers 2 and 4) Order 2009 from 11 April 2022. Whereas the exemption created by that Order applied only to Worker and Student sponsors, the exemption in the 2022 Order applies to all licensed sponsors, including Temporary Worker sponsors.\n\nS6.22. If you provide immigration advice or services in accordance with the 2022 Order, you must comply with the Code of Standards issued by OISC.\n\nWhat you can do\n\nS6.23. Under the 2022 Order, you can only provide immigration advice and immigration services if they are given:\n\nfree of charge\n\nin relation to an individual you are sponsoring (‘the main applicant’) or an ‘eligible family member’ of the main applicant\n\nin connection with a ‘relevant application’\n\nS6.24. In this section, a ‘relevant application’ is an application:\n\nby the main applicant for entry clearance or permission for the purpose of work or study in the UK (where you are the main applicant’s sponsor in relation to that work or study); or\n\nby a family member of the main applicant for entry clearance or permission as their ‘eligible family member’\n\nS6.25. This includes an application the individual is proposing to make, has made and is awaiting a decision on, or which has already been determined.\n\nS6.26. Advice and services you can provide in connection with a relevant application include:\n\nadvising the individual how to make an application and of the immigration requirements for the route on which they’re applying\n\nmaking enquiries with the Home Office on behalf of the individual about the progress of the application\n\nadvising the individual of the length of permission they have been granted and the conditions attached to it\n\nassisting the individual in an administrative review application if their application for entry clearance or permission has been refused, or their permission has been cancelled –however, the exemption does not extend to the provision of immigration advice or immigration services in relation to an appeal or judicial review proceedings\n\nS6.27. You can only provide immigration advice and immigration services to the main applicant (and, where relevant, their eligible family members) during the period for which you have sponsorship responsibility for the main applicant – see paragraph C1.8 of Part 3: Sponsor duties and compliance for a definition of when this period begins and ends.\n\nS6.28. If you are sponsoring a person with permission as a Scale-up Worker, you will only sponsor them for the first 6 months of their permission – you cannot provide immigration advice or immigration services to the worker (or their family members) after this period, unless you are otherwise authorised or exempt. The 6-month period is calculated from the date the worker’s entry clearance as a Scale-up Worker becomes effective (the ‘valid from’ date on their visa) or the date they are notified of a grant of permission to stay as a Scale-up Worker.\n\nImmigration advice or services provided to eligible family members\n\nS6.29. You can provide immigration advice and immigration services in relation to an individual other than the person you are sponsoring (the main applicant) in connection with their application for entry clearance or permission but only if you reasonably believe both of the following:\n\nthe application will be, or was, made as an eligible family member of the main applicant\n\nthe outcome of that application is, or was, dependent on the outcome of the main applicant’s application\n\nS6.30. This includes where the individual is applying, or has applied, as an eligible family member at the same time as the main applicant, or after the main applicant has already been granted permission.\n\nS6.31. The 2022 Order also covers the situation where the individual has existing permission as an eligible family member, and the main applicant subsequently applies to vary their permission (for example, to work for another sponsor, or to do a different job or course of study). In such situations, the eligible family member may not necessarily need to apply to vary their own permission in line with the main applicant (for example, if they already have sufficient existing permission) but they may need advice on (for example) their conditions of stay or whether they need to make a further application.\n\nS6.32. In all cases, to be eligible to provide immigration advice or services, you must be the sponsor of the main applicant. Where the main applicant has more than one sponsor (for example, if they’re doing secondary employment), each sponsor can provide immigration advice and services to both the main applicant and their eligible family members, if the requirements in this section are met.\n\nMeaning of ‘eligible family member’\n\nS6.33. For routes other than Child Student and Seasonal Worker, eligible family members are the main applicant’s:\n\npartner (spouse, civil partner or unmarried partner)\n\ndependent children aged under 18\n\ndependent children aged 18 or over if they have previously been granted permission as a dependent child of the main applicant or of their partner\n\nS6.34. A Child Student can be accompanied or joined by one parent (on the Parent of a Child Student route) if the child is aged between 4 and 11 and is attending an independent fee-paying school. The Seasonal Worker route does not permit any family members.\n\nS6.35. The exemption in the 2022 Order does not cover immigration advice or services provided to family members other than those listed above.\n\nWhat you cannot do\n\nS6.36. You must not provide immigration advice or immigration services if they are not covered by the 2022 Order. For example, you are not permitted to:\n\ncharge any fee to the main applicant (or their eligible family members) for providing immigration advice or services to them\n\nprovide immigration advice or services if this is not in connection with a relevant application – for example, you cannot provide advice in connection with an application for settlement, an appeal, a judicial review or other litigation, or on wider immigration issues\n\nprovide immigration advice or services to individuals you are not currently sponsoring (other than their eligible family members) – this applies even if you have previously sponsored them\n\nS6.37. If you wish to undertake any of the above activities (or provide any other immigration advice or services not covered by the 2022 Order), you must register with OISC, or be otherwise qualified or exempt. If you are unsure whether you can provide such advice or services, you should contact OISC for assistance.\n\nS7. Immigration requirements\n\nThis section tells you about the main immigration requirements a Worker or Temporary Worker must meet to qualify for entry clearance or permission.\n\nIt is not a complete statement of the requirements and you must refer to the relevant Immigration Rules and route-specific guidance for further details.\n\nContent in this section:\n\nRelevant Immigration Rules\n\nApplying from outside the UK: entry clearance\n\nApplying from inside the UK: permission to stay\n\nFormer government-sponsored students\n\nGenuineness requirement\n\nFinancial requirement\n\nAcademic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS) requirement\n\nEnglish language requirement\n\nAge requirement\n\nDecision on application: proof of immigration status\n\nLeaving and returning to the UK\n\nFurther information on immigration requirements\n\nRelevant Immigration Rules\n\nS7.1. You must be satisfied that any workers you wish to sponsor can meet the relevant Immigration Rules. The fact that you have assigned a valid Certificate of Sponsorship (CoS) does not guarantee they will be granted entry clearance or permission – UKVI will make the final decision on this.\n\nS7.2. The relevant requirements are contained in the following parts of the Immigration Rules:\n\nAppendix Skilled Worker\n\nAppendix Global Business Mobility – Senior or Specialist Worker\n\nAppendix Global Business Mobility – Graduate Trainee\n\nAppendix Global Business Mobility – UK Expansion Worker\n\nAppendix Global Business Mobility – Service Supplier\n\nAppendix Global Business Mobility – Secondment Worker\n\nAppendix Skilled Occupations\n\nAppendix Immigration Salary List\n\nAppendix T2 Minister of Religion\n\nAppendix Scale-up\n\nAppendix International Sportsperson\n\nAppendix Sports Governing Bodies\n\nAppendix Temporary Work – Seasonal Worker\n\nAppendix Temporary Work – Creative Worker\n\nAppendix Creative Worker Codes of Practice\n\nAppendix Temporary Work – Religious Worker\n\nAppendix Temporary Work – Charity Worker\n\nAppendix Temporary Work – International Agreement\n\nAppendix Temporary Work – Government Authorised Exchange\n\nAppendix Government Authorised Exchange schemes\n\nS7.3. Even if the worker meets all of the relevant Rules and you have met all of your sponsorship duties, the worker can still be refused permission to enter or stay in the UK, or have their permission cancelled, under the grounds for refusal in Part 9 of the Immigration Rules. This could be, for example, if the worker has used deception in their application, has previously breached their conditions of stay, or has a criminal record.\n\nApplying from outside the UK: entry clearance\n\nS7.4. If the worker you wish to sponsor is outside the UK, they must obtain entry clearance (a visa) on the relevant route before they come to the UK. The only exception to this is where the worker is eligible to enter the UK under the Creative Worker visa concession. See section CRW6 of Sponsor a Creative Worker for information on this concession.\n\nS7.5. If a worker tries to enter the UK without the required entry clearance, they will be refused entry, even if they meet all of the other requirements of the Rules.\n\nS7.6. Some applicants applying for entry clearance may need to undergo a test for pulmonary tuberculosis in order to get their visa – for further information, see Tuberculosis test for visa applicants on GOV.UK.\n\nApplying from inside the UK: permission to stay\n\nS7.7. If the worker you wish to sponsor is already in the UK, they must apply for ‘permission to stay’ (also known as ‘leave to remain’). This could be to:\n\nextend their existing Worker or Temporary Worker permission, either to continue working in the same job or to change employment – see Extensions, change of employment and settlement\n\n‘switch’ from a different immigration route where the Rules allow this\n\nS7.8. Applicants applying from within the UK must not be either:\n\nin the UK without permission (subject to limited exceptions in paragraph 39E of the Immigration Rules)\n\non immigration bail\n\nSwitching immigration route while in the UK\n\nS7.9. Switching is the term we use when a person who is already legally in the UK changes from one immigration route to another, where the Rules allow this.\n\nS7.10. People can switch to, or between, the Worker, Global Business Mobility or Scale-up routes, provided they:\n\nwere not last granted permission:\n\nas a Visitor (there is a limited exception to this for some people on the International Sportsperson route – see section SPT3 of Sponsor an International Sportsperson for details)\n\nas a Student, unless they meet the additional rules for people switching from the Student route (as set out below)\n\nas a Short-term Student\n\nas a Parent of a Child Student\n\nas a Seasonal Worker\n\nas a Domestic Worker in a Private Household; or\n\noutside the Immigration Rules; and\n\nmeet all of the requirements of the route they are applying to switch to\n\nS7.11. Switching to, or between, the Temporary Worker routes (other than the Global Business Mobility routes or the Scale-up route) is not generally permitted. There is an exception which allows some students to switch to the Government Authorised Exchange route (see section GA4 of Sponsor a Government Authorised Exchange worker).\n\nS7.12. If you want to sponsor a person who is already in the UK on another immigration route, you should check that their current immigration status allows them to switch. This is important because if the individual is in the UK on a route that does not allow them to switch, we will normally reject their application. If they are not in the UK on a route that allows them to switch, they must leave the UK and apply for entry clearance.\n\nSwitching from the Student route\n\nS7.13. If the person you wish to sponsor will be applying for permission to stay on the Worker, Global Business Mobility or Scale-up routes, and they have, or last had, permission as a Student (including as a Tier 4 (General) Migrant), they must meet one of the conditions below on the date they make their application to be allowed to switch:\n\nthey must have completed the course of study for which they were being sponsored as a Student\n\nthey must be studying a full-time course of study at degree level or above with a higher education provider which has a track record of compliance, and the start date on their CoS must be no earlier than the course completion date\n\nthey must be studying a full-time course of study leading to the award of a PhD with a higher education provider which has a track record of compliance, and the start date on their CoS must be no earlier than 24 months after the start date of their PhD\n\nS7.14. A ‘higher education provider with a track record of compliance’ will be shown on the Register of student sponsors with the type ‘Higher Education Institution (HEI)’ and with the status ‘Student Sponsor – Track Record’.\n\nS7.15. If you wish to sponsor a worker who has, or last had, permission as a Student, you must carefully check they can meet one of the above conditions before you assign a CoS to them. If they do not meet one of these conditions, they will not be permitted to switch.\n\nPermission to work while a switching application is pending\n\nS7.16. A person who has made an application to switch to a sponsored work route must not start working for you until their application has been granted, unless, on the date of application, they already have a type of immigration permission which allows them to do the work in question (for example, if they have permission as a dependant of a Skilled Worker and a right to work check confirms they are not prohibited from doing the work in question).\n\nS7.17. Where a person is allowed to work in these circumstances, you must stop sponsoring them if their application to switch is eventually refused (and any administrative review is finally dismissed), and must not continue t"
