        "text": "Nefertari Vivi[10] is the princess of the Arabasta Kingdom.[2] She is the daughter of Nefertari Cobra and Titi, and along with the rest of her family, she bears the initial D. in her name.[11] During her childhood, Vivi was part of the Sand-Sand Clan, being the vice-leader of the group led by her friend Koza.\n\nVivi debuted as one of the main antagonists of the Reverse Mountain Arc as a Bounty Hunter, under the Baroque Works codename Miss Wednesday.[1] During this time, she was partnered with fellow Frontier Agent, Mr. 9. However, after the events of the Whisky Peak Arc, Vivi and her pet duck Karoo ended up joining the Straw Hat Pirates for most of the Arabasta Saga once she was discovered to be a spy plotting against Baroque Works.\n\nVivi left the Straw Hats after defeating Baroque Works to stay in her home country,[12] but is still considered a member of the crew and has been keeping track of their progress throughout the series.[13] After attending the most recent Levely, she became a fugitive and was forced to flee Mary Geoise and take shelter alongside Wapol aboard Morgans' airship.\n\nAppearance[]\n\nVivi is a young woman of medium height with long wavy light blue hair, with two locks hanging down, one on either side of her head, which started out at about chin-length but were past her shoulders by her last appearance before the timeskip. According to her father, Vivi holds a strong resemblance to her mother.[14] She most often wears her hair pulled back into a ponytail, and brown eyes. She has a slender body but tends to wear less-revealing clothing than Nami and Robin do. Vivi has been seen wearing several different high heeled shoes, including white high heel boots, white high heel sandals, and blue wedges.\n\nThough she is a princess, she rarely wore clothing that would suggest her royal status while traveling with the Straw Hats, although she started to do so more regularly after her coming-of-age speech.\n\nAfter the timeskip, she wears her hair down but held back by a clip, and it seems a bit shorter than before. Like most female characters since the timeskip, her hourglass figure has become more pronounced.\n\nA notable facet of her appearance is that when she was a member of Baroque Works, she seemed to have been drawn in a slightly different way. While playing the role of Miss Wednesday, she looked older, and her facial features were much more angular. She wore her ponytail in a very high position until she was attacked by Miss Valentine, where a few strands of her hair were slashed off with her hair bead. It was only after her true identity was revealed that she was drawn to look more like a teenage girl, with slightly bigger/rounder facial features and a less shapely body. This was more noticeable in the anime than the manga, as the animators drew her in such a different way that she could almost be mistaken for another character.\n\nAs a child, she had shoulder-length hair tied in a ponytail.\n\nDuring the Reverse Mountain and Whisky Peak Arcs, she wears a shirt with dark blue and white circles (light blue and dark blue stripes in the anime), shorts fastened with a belt, and a white coat.\n\nDuring the Little Garden Arc, she wears a light green long-sleeve shirt with blue lines, white shorts, and white boots.\n\nAt the beginning of the Drum Island Arc, she exchanges the shirt she wore in Little Garden for a maroon sweatshirt. Once they arrive in a cold climate zone, she begins to wear warm clothing, wearing a white coat with pink shoulder pads, long blue pants, and yellow gloves.\n\nDuring the Arabasta Arc, Vivi had several different outfits:\n\nAfter leaving Drum Island, she wore a tank-top with dark green straps and light green squared pattern, short, white pants, and white Chukka boots.\n\nShe later wore a light blue tank-top with dark blue dots and a frilly neckline, and light colored pants.\n\nIn the anime, the frills and light blue and the pants are peach colored. In the Digitally Colored Manga, the frills are yellow and the pants are white.\n\nAs the crew approached Arabasta, she wears a pink short-sleeved shirt with blue shoulders and a drawing of three X on a line, short blue pants, and white Chukka boots. Starting this point she had bandage on her left forearm.\n\nDuring the Straw Hats brief stay at Nanohana, she wore a dancer outfit with a green and yellow top and long skirt, a light blue cover-up, a golden neckless, and a gold armband on her right forearm.\n\nIn the anime, the outfit is blue and pink, the cover-up is white, and the neckless has red gems.\n\nDuring the Straw Hats mission to stop Crocodile's Operation Utopia, she wore a dark blue desert outfit, with a tan colored jellabiya.\n\nWhile recovering from the fights, she wore a pink, long sleeved night gown.\n\nShe later wore a purple shirt, with a white and green pattern dress.\n\nAt the end of the arc, she wore a princess outfit, with a white and pink dress with suspenders, and white high-heeled sandals with gold ornaments and accessories. She began wearing her hair down.\n\nDuring the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, she wears a light pink shirt with dark pink lines and figures, a white skirt, and purple high-heeled sandals.\n\nDurning the Post-War Arc, she wears a white dress.\n\nTwo years later, when she attends the Levely, she wears a long-sleeved pink dress, with gold accessories at the waist and arms, a cape, red on the outside and dark blue on the inside, and white high heel pumps. When she arrived at Levely, she took off her cape.\n\nDuring the Egghead Arc, after being taken in by Morgans, she wears clothes lent to her by Iyan'eno Chinode, consisting of a sleeveless ruffle top, a long skirt and high-heeled sandals.\n\nGallery[]\n\nMain Series (Pre-Timeskip)[]\n\nMain Series (Post-Timeskip)[]\n\nMiss Wednesday[]\n\nNon-Canon[]\n\nVideo Games[]\n\nOther[]\n\nPersonality[]\n\nVivi does not fit the stereotype of a needy and authoritative princess, never demanding any special attention or prioritizing herself above others. In fact, she usually puts the needs of others far above her own and is hesitant to rely on others or ask for help with her own problems. In particular, she places an enormous value on the citizens of her country and the lives of her friends. Vivi's selfless nature could be seen especially when she asked the Straw Hats to make a detour to get medical help for Nami instead of continuing straight to Arabasta, even though she knew her country was in a state of emergency. This selflessness applies to herself as shown when in a precarious of being kidnapped by CP0 and possibly made into a slave, Vivi was more worried for her friend Shirahoshi who was being targeted by a World Noble.\n\nShe is also extremely brave and determined, going up against powerful enemies for her friends' sake, even when clearly outmatched. Her selflessness and sense of responsibility push her to carry her country's burden. She is slow to anger and quick to forgive but fiercely loyal to her friends, her family, and her country. Because of this loyalty and bravery, she is willing to make virtually any sacrifice, such as when she was willing to allow her feet to be cut off to escape Mr. 3's candle prison. Vivi can stay calm in bad situation and act quickly when she sees a way out.\n\nAs a child, her father often worried that her heart was too soft, with Igaram reassuring him that it would be good for Arabasta when she took the throne. She is also inclined to find non-violent ways whenever possible, begging Luffy not to fight Crocodile, thus this was largely out of concern for Luffy. Throughout the Arabasta Arc, she wanted to stop Crocodile's plans with words over violence, wanting to save everyone. Both Luffy and Crocodile pointed out Vivi was too naïve, as she didn't want anyone to die and was unwilling to risk the lives of others despite being willing to risk her own. Crocodile further mocked her for trying so hard to save everyone she end up endangering everyone.[15]\n\nAs a member of Arabasta's royal family, she loves her country and is willing to do anything to protect it, even infiltrating a vast criminal organization. She does not mind doing tasks that seem unsuitable for a princess, such as washing dishes.\n\nVivi grew up knowing that she was responsible for the well-being of her country. As such, she developed impressive skills as a diplomat. Even as a child, she understood what being a princess meant and acted with wisdom beyond her years: when slapped by Wapol, she apologized for being in his way and held back her tears until he was out of earshot, all for the sake of preventing an international incident. When they reached Drum Island, she was able to persuade Luffy to not attack the villagers and even put on a brave face after being shot in the arm. Her courage convinced the villagers to allow them into the village peacefully.\n\nDuring arguments, Vivi has a hard time coming up with insults and usually ends up saying something of little offense. She has a habit of giving people nicknames, calling Zoro \"Mr. Bushido\", for example.[16] She also has a habit of biting her bottom lip when she is worried. Despite her kind and earnest nature, she can be deceptive when necessary. At age fourteen, she was able to infiltrate Baroque Works and, over the course of two years, quickly rose to frontier agent status without anybody realizing her true identity.\n\nA running gag throughout much of the Arabasta Arc was that Vivi constantly forgot to warn the Straw Hats about various dangers of the desert, such as giant scorpions and lizards, until after they appeared. Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji quickly dispatched any threatening creatures but berated her for her inability to remember such things beforehand.\n\nVivi is also self-conscious about her lack of physical strength. After being nearly eaten alive by one Bananawani, she witnessed Luffy and Zoro defeated a group of them easily, causing Vivi to wail to Usopp about not being able to handle even one.\n\nAfter the timeskip, it is shown that her time with the Straw Hats have changed her, as Vivi's adventurous side from her times as a pirate showed itself when she was about to head to Mary Geoise for Levely. She apparently misses her time on the sea, as she felt reminiscent from the breeze from the salty ocean. She even jumped down from the mast of the ship, worrying those around her who were not with her during her time as a pirate.\n\nVivi will not hesitate to stand up for someone whom she just befriended as she spoke out against Charlos' attempt to enslave Shirahoshi. When Neptune expressed his disgust at the World Noble's actions and went on to attack him, saying he would never bring his kind to the surface again, Vivi was brought to tears, saying that not all humans are like the World Nobles.\n\nBeing fair-minded and honest person, Vivi expressed her dislike of the World Economy News Paper due to their lack of journalistic integrity, especially when the president, Morgans, falsified a story where Luffy took Vegapunk hostage while waging war against the Marines, which Vivi knew Luffy would never do.[17]\n\nRelationships[]\n\nStraw Hat Pirates[]\n\nVivi traveled with and assisted the Straw Hat Pirates for almost the entire Arabasta Saga and strongly considered joining their crew after Crocodile's defeat. Though she ultimately declined their offer in favor of working to restore her country, she remains closer to the Straw Hats than anyone else outside of their crew.[12] She and Karoo are now regarded as honorary members of the Straw Hat Pirates, at least by Luffy and the others. Her close relationship with the Straw Hats were further emphasized when she was one of the few people who realized Luffy had a message for the crew during his second appearance at Marineford, but she did not understand the message since she had no context. Upon learning of what the Straw Hats did at Dressrosa, she immediately knew what they were doing. When it was reported that Vivi went missing in Mary Geoise, most of the members who knew her panicked and wanted to go save her, with only Zoro and Robin maintaining their calm to keep the crew in check.\n\nMonkey D. Luffy[]\n\nWhen traveling with the Straw Hats, Vivi had a great amount of respect for Monkey D. Luffy, both as a captain and as her friend, openly showing both amazement and disbelief at his great strength and fighting abilities, which would sometimes make her doubt her own fighting skills and feel the need to show that she can handle herself despite the clear difference in fighting capabilities. Despite this, she also openly showed concern for his reckless behavior and fearlessness during their travels, feeling the need to watch over him from time to time. Whenever she saw Luffy doing something that might compromise the crew's safety, even when he meant to help, she reminded him of a leader's responsibilities. When they reached Drum Island, she was able to persuade Luffy not to attack the villagers, showing how much trust he had in her. At Arabasta, Luffy forced her to admit she needed help in taking down Crocodile and asked her to let him and the crew carry some of her burden. That confrontation cemented their relationship of strong mutual trust. Her high opinion of Luffy did not change when she learned that his father was the world's worst criminal. Instead, she was concerned for his safety. During the Levely Arc, she openly stated her friendship with Luffy to Rebecca and Shirahoshi. Like many who knew him, she believes that Luffy will be the King of the Pirates. She also trusted Luffy's grandfather over Rob Lucci for protection.[18]\n\nTwo years later when Morgans was plotting to write a headline that Luffy was going to kidnap Vegapunk to make the World Government look bad, which offended Vivi, as she stated that Luffy would never do such a thing.[17] Although she was shocked when the headline came true.[19]\n\nRoronoa Zoro[]\n\nVivi was originally antagonistic towards Zoro when she was still undercover as a bounty hunter and Baroque Works agent. At Whisky Peak, she boldly tried to kill him and greatly underestimated him in the process. This quickly changed after her failed attempts to attack him and after she witnessed him effortlessly defeating dozens of bounty hunters, including her fellow agents. After her identity was revealed and she began to travel with the crew, Zoro got along well with Vivi, who in turn nicknamed him \"Mr. Bushido\".[16] However, as the Straw Hats departed from Arabasta, he seemed unperturbed that they had to leave her behind. When the rest of the crew was depressed because of her absence, he commented that they should have taken her by force if they wanted her to stay that badly.[20]\n\nAfter learning about what happen at Levely after leaving Wano Country, Zoro was the only Straw Hat who knew her that didn't panic, as he trusted Vivi could take care of herself, as oppose to the rest who wanted to find her.[21]\n\nNami[]\n\nShe and Nami also became very good friends. Their personalities seem to be opposites. Nami has a hot-tempered disposition, while Vivi is calmer and more collected. They switch personalities when something worrisome happens: Nami is the one to calm down while Vivi panics. The two formed a quick bond and worked together in most situations. During Nami's fight with Miss Double Finger, Nami said that being stabbed in the foot could not compare to the pain Vivi felt for her country. Initially, Nami wanted Vivi to pay 1,000,000,000 for the Straw Hats' assistance. However, because of the bond that they made throughout the journey, Nami decided to give up on the demands for the sake of her friendship with Vivi.\n\nUsopp[]\n\nVivi and Usopp worked well together on more than one occasion and were concerned for each other's well-being. After seeing Luffy dragging Usopp by the nose, she developed a tendency to also grab his nose, using it as a means of getting his attention or a handle by which he could be dragged.[22]\n\nSanji[]\n\nAside from Sanji's fighting skills and strength, Vivi was also greatly impressed by his cooking skills. In turn, Sanji immediately warmed up to her and greatly showed his attraction towards her on multiple occasions. However, Vivi showed mostly confusion from Sanji's actions towards her. She quickly became one of his three main affections, and he defended her to the same degree as he did Nami (and later Robin). Two years later, Sanji showed great delight in seeing Vivi's picture in the newspaper.\n\nTony Tony Chopper[]\n\nShe finds Chopper adorable and calls him Tony-kun, which always launches him into one of his happy dances.\n\nNico Robin[]\n\nShe was not upset when she learned that Luffy took Nico Robin, the former Miss All Sunday and their one-time enemy, into his crew. Rather than questioning his motives, she decided to trust Luffy's judgement on the matter.[13]\n\nFamily[]\n\nCobra[]\n\nKing Cobra has great faith in his daughter's strong determination and will. He shows nearly same level of paranoia about Vivi's safety as Igaram and was relieved to learn of her safety after her time with Baroque Works. Vivi has also described Cobra as a worrywart for this reason.\n\nVivi seemingly cried for days when she learned about the death of her father, having been unaware about it while stowing away from the Levely.\n\nTiti[]\n\nVivi's mother, Queen Titi, died many years before the current storyline. The duration and nature of their relationship are unknown.[14]\n\nSubjects[]\n\nChaka and Pell[]\n\nThe two great warriors of Arabasta, Chaka and Pell, have always watched over Vivi. Pell is especially fond of her, even taking her for a ride despite the king having forbidden it.\n\nSuper Spot-Billed Duck Troops[]\n\nLike Karoo, Vivi has accepted the entire Super Spot-Billed Duck Troops as her pets as well as a means of transportation. The troops in turn are very loyal to Vivi and Karoo, so much so that they assisted them and the Straw Hats in traveling through the desert, and later in the fight against Baroque Works. The newest member, Matsuge, also helped in the fight against Baroque Works and has been very close with the princess ever since, even sometimes seen shopping with her and Karoo.\n\nIgaram[]\n\nLikewise, Igaram was fond of the Princess and often acted with such deep concern for her well-being that it bordered on paranoia. He also willingly risked his life to protect her when their infiltration of Baroque Works was discovered.[23]\n\nFriends[]\n\nKaroo[]\n\nVivi is also very close with her pet, Karoo the spot-billed duck. She cares deeply for him, as shown when she refused to leave with the Straw Hats without him. Whenever he is put in danger without good reason, she immediately and vehemently berates the person who did so. As they have been together since childhood, the two have an exceptionally strong bond, and he is willing to do most anything for her, though this bond does not stop Vivi from scolding him when he disobeys or misunderstands her simplest orders. Despite this, she knows she can count on him and entrusts him with very important tasks.\n\nKoza[]\n\nKoza, the leader of the rebellion, has been a close personal friend of Vivi's for 11 years. Though they originally met on bad terms, there soon came to be a level of respect between them. The two became close childhood friends, even co-leading a large childhood group called the Sand-Sand Clan. Vivi owes her life to him for saving her from some kidnappers as a child. Her friendship with him led Baroque Works to fear the repercussions of the pair meeting up again, and they did everything possible to prevent the two from seeing each other.\n\nDalton[]\n\nVivi originally met Dalton years ago as a little girl when they attended the Levely, with Dalton as Wapol's escort, and Vivi accompanying her father, Cobra. Though Wapol intentionally tried to stir up trouble due to a disagreement with Cobra, Vivi ignored his rude act to avoid a conflict, something that would impress and eventually inspire Dalton to turn against Wapol.\n\nLater when she and the Straw Hats landed on Drum Island to find a doctor for Nami, Dalton saw Vivi working towards preventing a conflict between the crew and the townspeople and allowed them onto the island, feeling he could trust them. Though Vivi chose not to disclose her true identity to him during their time on Drum Island even after she reacted upon remembering Wapol, Dalton was capable of figuring out her identity on his own and was glad she was traveling with the Straw Hats when they were departing from Drum Island.\n\nThey would later meet again and get reacquainted two years later when they both attended the current Levely to which she greets both him and Dr. Kureha. When Wapol approached Vivi and started insulting her, Dalton stood up for her by intimidating Wapol into backing off.[24]\n\nFriends of the Straw Hats[]\n\nAt Mary Geoise, Vivi was quick to bond with Rebecca, Leo, and Shirahoshi due to having a mutual friend that they are indebted to. When Charlos tried to make Shirahoshi his slave, Vivi was outraged and protested against the World Noble's actions to which Shirahoshi's father Neptune thanked Vivi for her efforts just as he was preparing to take action. Later Vivi was still worried about Shirahoshi's safety after hearing of Charlos' second attempt to kidnap her, only to learn from CP0 about Shirahoshi being saved by Sai and Leo.\n\nMr. 9 and Miss Monday[]\n\nIn Baroque Works, Mr. 9 and Miss Monday had become close friends with Vivi (as Miss Wednesday) and Igaram (as Mr. 8). Their friendship was so strong that both of them were prepared to give their lives to save her when she is attacked by Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine.[25][26]\n\nEnemies[]\n\nCrocodile[]\n\nVivi truly hates Crocodile, the secret boss of Baroque Works, for the chaos and ruin he caused in her country. On multiple occasions, she has openly wished for his death or voiced her desire to kill him.\n\nBaroque Works Agents[]\n\nAfter she infiltrated the organization, her true identity was discovered, and she was attacked by Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine at Whiskey Peak. Then they had a second meeting in Little Garden, where she also had to face Mr. 3 and Miss Goldenweek.\n\nMr. 7 and Miss Father's Day were apparently friends with her at some point. However, by the time they meet at Arabasta, the sniper pair already knew that she was a spy.\n\nWorld Government[]\n\nFollowing the most recent Levely, Vivi has become an enemy of the World Government due to both Imu and the Five Elders learning about her connection to the Will of D. and the fact that she was imprisoned by CP0 where they intended for her to \"disappear\" and ultimately become a slave to a World Noble, to which she stated in disgust \"over my dead body\". As a result of her and Wapol knowing the truth behind her father's murder, the two became fugitives and are currently in hiding from the World Government. Imu ordered the Five Elders to find Vivi and bring her to them.\n\nRob Lucci[]\n\nVivi holds nothing but hostility towards Rob Lucci, in part of his participation in Charlos's attempted enslavement of Shirahoshi during the Levely. Despite being a member of CP0, Vivi was unafraid of him, going far as to physically confront him and demand he and his agents release her friend. Later when Vivi found Lucci following her to Red Port, claiming he was there to protect her, she sardonically rejected his help, still in contempt for his previous actions. Her distrust in Lucci was later to be well founded as the princess soon was kidnapped and held temporarily captive by his colleagues.\n\nOther[]\n\nWapol[]\n\nWapol is a former enemy of Vivi, now a forced traveling companion. At a young age, Vivi first crossed paths with the then king of Drum Kingdom during a previous Levely, and due to the latter's confrontation with Cobra, the meeting ended with Wapol shoving her, and wounding her. Thanks to Vivi's nobility however, the event was calmed instead of becoming an incident between the kingdoms.[27] Afterward, during Vivi's time with the Straw Hats, the two encounter each other again, and while Vivi recognized him,[28] it was only after Dalton revealed the history of Drum, and the attack by the Blackbeard Pirates, that she fully remembered him, and became angry with his actions despite being the king.[29] By the time of their third meeting in another Levely, they remained hostile toward each other.[30] In a twist of fate, Wapol would unintentionally save Vivi from CP0 while running away after witnessing her father's murder.\n\nFollowing the events of the recent Levely, due to knowing the truth about the death of Vivi's father Cobra, the two were forced into hiding together from the World Government aboard Morgans' airship.[17]\n\nMorgans[]\n\nOn the run from the World Government, Vivi found herself tagging along with Wapol, and seeking asylum in the airship belonging to the head of the World Economy News Paper. Despite being taken in by Morgans, Vivi is not shy about voicing her disdain of the journalist in creating a fake story and using Luffy to sensationalize it even if it could possibly result in him retracting his protection over her. She even called Morgans a liar when written a fake article of Luffy's murdering Vegapunk.\n\nThe following events are Non-Canon and therefore not considered part of the Canon story.\n\nNon-Canon[]\n\nRasa[]\n\nVivi met Rasa when they were children, during a royal tour around the country along with her father. Rasa is seen giving the princess a wreath. After Melias was abandoned by its people, she stayed in the village, waiting for the king to return, feeling that the king and the princess abandoned them. When they meet again in the present, Barbarossa sends Rasa and Zaba to accompany Luffy and Vivi as they go to look for wood. While traveling to Yuba, she sends Vivi and Luffy's Sand Sled towards a sandpit, on vain of her unkept promise from when she was a child. Vivi would later apologize for her father's mistake and promised to make things right. She eventually forgives Vivi and is seen smiling hoping for a bright future. She waves goodbye to Vivi and the Straw Hats as they head towards Ido.[31]\n\nFata[]\n\nFata developed a crush on Vivi and decided to write a love letter to her. He was embarrassed when it was found, and when Vivi learned about it, she was sad to cause one of her subjects pain unintentionally.[32]\n\nConcludes non-canon section.\n\nAbilities and Powers[]\n\nAs a princess, Vivi has a great deal of authority in her country. With the death of her father, she is currently the highest authority of the Arabasta Kingdom.\n\nShe has a natural skill in diplomacy. This was clear even as a child, as Vivi understood what being a princess meant and acted with wisdom beyond her years during her childhood trip to the Levely. When she was slapped by Wapol, she quickly apologized for being in his way and held back her tears until he was out of earshot, all for the sake of preventing an international incident. When meeting the Straw Hats, she managed to persuade Zoro and Nami into protecting her from the Baroque Works agents after her cover was blown, and even persuaded Nami against charging her for their protection. When traveling with the Straw Hats, she even showed an impressive, and almost comedic amount of skill in keeping the more childish members of the crew (Luffy, Usopp, and Chopper) as well as Karoo, focused, calm, and motivated during their travels together. When they reached Drum Island, she was able to persuade Luffy not to attack the villagers back and even put on a brave face after being shot in the arm. Her courage convinced the villagers to allow them into the village peacefully. In the aftermath of the battle against Baroque Works, Vivi even managed to persuade the royal guards and rebels of her country to ultimately stop fighting and killing one another, effectively ending the needless civil war that was started by Crocodile.\n\nVivi has proven herself to be a very capable spy and has shown great skill in stealth and other clandestine skills as well. This was proven clearly as Vivi was extremely good at moving about undetected, having established herself as a single digit member of Baroque Works for two years before her identity was compromised and she returned to Arabasta completely unnoticed by the citizens. Her actions as a spy were completely unnoticed by the Marines, the World Government, and even the Warlord of the Sea Crocodile for more than two years until her cover was finally blown by Miss All Sunday. Since leaving the Straw Hats, she seems to have managed to maintain her role as a princess, all the while successfully keeping both her past as a Baroque Works agent and a companion of a pirate crew secret from the Marines and the World Government.\n\nPhysical Abilities[]\n\nDespite her lack of combat experience compared to the Straw Hats, Vivi has proven herself more than capable of being able to hold her own in battle. When infiltrating Baroque Works, she held her own within the organization, and quickly rose up the ranks within two years. As a Baroque Works frontier agent, she and her partner surpassed three other pairs in skill, and was experienced as both agents and bounty hunters, as they were the pair tasked with killing Laboon. Her confidence in her own fighting abilities were so great that she even openly tried to attack Roronoa Zoro, till she realized the clear difference in strength between the two of them. Vivi can also make use of Karoo, in spite of his frequent incompetence, to gain more mobility in battle. She was able to hold her own against a group of Billions, although she was eventually overwhelmed by their sheer numbers and had to be saved by Pell.\n\nOn her own, she has surprising natural agility, often dodging attacks gracefully and almost mindlessly, often appearing surprised after it happens. Her instinct seems to be to tackle her opponent and hold them down, as seen during her confrontations with Luffy and Koza. Her time as a Baroque Works agent also seems to have given her a preference for surprise attacks and ambushes, as seen during her confrontations with Zoro and Crocodile. However, since both her attempts failed, her actual ability in these skills is currently unknown.\n\nVivi is resilient and able to endure a lot of pain, such as a bullet wound to the arm and a skinned knee caused when she fell due to her wedges falling apart, slowing her down momentarily. Her feet are also tough enough that she can go barefoot with ease, as she was able to trek through Alubarna unhindered after her wedges fell apart, run across cobblestone streets without any visible pain, and stand perched steadily atop a narrow ledge on the city's clock tower. After all this, she only suffered minor scrapes and tarnishes to her feet and needed no bandages on them afterwards. After the timeskip, Vivi has seemingly become much more physically agile and resilient, as evidenced by her deftly jumping from a crow's nest hundreds of feet high and landing on her feet in front of her father and guards.[33]\n\nIn terms of physical strength, she is highly outmatched by other members of the Straw Hat Pirates. This was made very evident when she struggled against a single Bananawani while Luffy and Zoro could defeat a group of them effortlessly. This huge difference in strength briefly made Vivi comically depressed, as she even had trouble with just running from one.\n\nWeapons[]\n\nFurther information: Peacock Slashers\n\nVivi's weapons of choice are her twirling \"Kujakki (Peacock) Slashers,\" which are small, sharp discs attached to her fingers by wires. She is left-handed but capable of dual wielding the slashers.\n\nAt Arabasta, she started using the longer range Kujakki String Slashers, which carry enough power to behead someone with a single slash. If her Peacock Slashers miss the target, as seen when she was fighting Miss Father's Day and Mr. 7, she can use a special backup move she has dubbed Run Back. This technique has been proven to be extremely useful, as it defeated the two frontier agents of Baroque Works.\n\nBefore joining the Straw Hats, she had another attack, first seen being used on Zoro: the Miwaku no Memaii Dansu, in which she performs a hypnotic dance utilizing the concentric patterns on her outfit. The effect immobilizes her opponent and creates an opening for her final attack. In the anime (where the design of her outfit is altered), this attack is changed to the Miwaku no Kousui Dansu and relies on a special perfume for effect.\n\nShe and Mr. 9 briefly wielded bazookas during their attempt to kill Laboon.\n\nVivi was once seen hitting Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji with a large mace, after which the weapon was never seen again.[34] It was replaced with a broom in the anime.[35]\n\nMajor Battles[]\n\nVivi vs. Koza (as children, twice)\n\nVivi (as Miss Wednesday), Mr. 8, Mr. 9, and Miss Monday vs. Roronoa Zoro\n\nVivi vs. Miss Valentine\n\nVivi and Usopp vs. Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine\n\nVivi and Nami vs. Miss Valentine\n\nVivi and Pell vs. Miss All-Sunday\n\nVivi vs. Crocodile\n\nVivi vs. Bananawani\n\nVivi and Karoo vs. Mr. 2 Bon Kurei\n\nVivi vs. Mr. 7 and Miss Father's Day\n\nAnime and Manga Differences[]\n\nIn the manga, when Vivi is still a member of Baroque Works, her top is different than that of the anime. The reason why the anime changed it is unknown, but it is most probably because of how the circles on her chest resemble nipples.\n\nThis difference in the outfit caused one of her attacks, Miwaku no Memai Dance, to change in the anime, as explained in the article Peacock Slashers.\n\nShe does have her original outfit design in some other media formats, such as Movie 2 end credits, Set Sail Pirate Crew! and One Piece: Treasure Battle! video games, and the extended version of Movie 8.\n\nTranslation and Dub Issues[]\n\nThe Funimation dub of Movie 8 calls her by this name, but it is written as \"Nefertari\" in the subtitles for the Japanese language track. Her name was later changed to \"Nefertari\" for the Funimation uncut TV series. However, a strange situation with her naming scheme was used. Despite Funimation using Japanese name order (surname before given name) for all other characters like Luffy, Zoro, and Robin, Vivi and her father's names are inexplicably flipped into Western name order (given name before surname), so she is referred to as \"Vivi Nefertari\" in this dub, causing a strange inconsistency.\n\nAdditionally, in the 4Kids dub, the first I in Vivi's given name is pronounced with a short I sound and emphasis is placed on the second syllable, being said something like \"vih-VEE\". In Funimation and Odex's dubs, no emphasis is placed on either syllable and both I's are pronounced with a long I sound as \"VEE-VEE\".\n\nAlso in the 4Kids dub, she suffered the same treatment as other female characters, mainly how her cleavage was often edited over.\n\nDespite being translated by VIZ and typically using the VIZ translation when referencing One Piece (such as using \"Neptunian\" when referencing Sea Kings at the end of volume 2), chapter 27 of Me & Roboco instead references Vivi as \"Nefertari Vivi\", a name previously only used officially in English by One Piece: Unlimited Adventure.\n\nMerchandise[]\n\nVivi has been shown in many forms of merchandise. She has been featured in the series of models Portrait of Pirates. She was also featured alongside Sanji in the One Piece Desert Kingdom Mascot Keychain/Cellphone Strap collection.\n\nSongs[]\n\nArabasta no Suna, Oasis no Shizuku\n\nWish Upon a Star\n\nGirls ni Kubittake (Sanji with Nami and Vivi as backup singers)\n\nIrodori no Kuni\n\nFurusato no Tame Ni (with Igaram)\n\nVideo Games[]\n\nPlayable Appearances[]\n\nEnemy Appearances[]\n\nLegend of the Rainbow Island\n\nOne Piece Treasure Cruise\n\nSupport Appearances[]\n\nOne Piece: Pirates Carnival\n\nOne Piece: Gigant Battle\n\nOne Piece: Dance Battle\n\nOne Piece: Burning Blood\n\nOne Piece: Great Pirate Colosseum\n\nNon-Playable Appearances[]\n\nOne Piece: Great Hidden Treasure of the Nanatsu Islands\n\nGrand Battle!

However, Cobra makes a promise with Luffy that if Class 1-1 wins first place in the cultural festival, he will not force Vivi to change schools. The class succeeds and Vivi is allowed to stay at New World Middle School.\n\nChapter 15: Vivi is able to prove Luffy's innocence using a Tone Dial of Lucci admitting to his fake police report. She also makes use of her Peacock Slashers.\n\nOther Media[]\n\nA drama CD titled The Great Adventure of Vivi the Pirate was released in 2002, featuring a what-if scenario of Vivi becoming a pirate with the Straw Hats instead of remaining in the Arabasta Kingdom. In the story, Vivi's connection to the Straw Hat Pirates is uncovered and she is branded a pirate with a bounty of 50,000,000. She reunites with the Straw Hats at sea and decides to become a proper crew member. However, a while later, the crew is shipwrecked on a jungle island and an adventure ensues. At the end, however, the story is revealed to be a dream of Luffy.\n\nIn One Piece Premier Show 2018, Vivi plays a significant role. The show reviews the events of the Arabasta Arc and features Vivi at the Levely as one of the targets of the Bounties Pirates.\n\nVivi is the main character of the third One Piece-themed Hungry Days commercial, \"Vivi Saga\". In this alternate universe, Vivi is a high school student who is going to transfer schools and part with her friends, the student-versions of the Straw Hat Pirates. Their goodbye is a recreation of the \"mark of friendship\" ending of the Arabasta Arc, with each member of the group also holding a cup of Nissin Foods Cup Noodles.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nVivi has her own personal Jolly Roger. This was first seen on the hat she was wearing in Igaram's nightmare when he feared that Vivi would run off to become a pirate with the Straw Hat Pirates.[36]\n\nIn the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th fan polls of most popular characters, Vivi was ranked 10th, 15th, 14th, 24th, 24th again, and 21st, respectively, making her one of the most popular female characters.\n\nThe Mr. 9 pair had a \"performing\" theme, with dancing and acrobatics.\n\nDespite her long absence from the series and her separation from ties to the Straw Hat crew, Vivi and Karoo have been featured on the cover pages of several chapters.[37]\n\nVivi's surname was most likely taken from Nefertari Meritmut, the wife of famed pharaoh Ramesses the Great.\n\nAccording to the 21st Log, Vivi's role as princess of Arabasta was actually a late minute decision from Eiichiro Oda, who already had the Arabasta Arc planned in mind and thought Miss Wednesday could fit as a representative of the country, since she looked princess-like with her hair down.\n\nSBS-Based Trivia[]\n\nVivi's birthday, February 2, comes from her name since 2-2 can be derived from vi-vi.[7]\n\nVivi's surname, Nefertari, is an ancient Egyptian name meaning \"the most beautiful\" or \"most wonderful\". It was a word often used to describe Egyptian queens and princesses. Oda admitted the Arabasta Arc was based around ancient Egypt but apparently had no clue on what the word meant when he chose the name for Vivi.[38]\n\nVivi's favorite foods are curry, custard pudding, and mulukhiyah,[8] and her least favorite food is dried squid.[9]\n\nVivi's specific number is 5.5.[9]\n\nVivi's specific color is white (gold).[9]\n\nVivi's animal resemblance is a dove (discussed with her Japanese voice actress: Misa Watanabe).[9]\n\nReferences[]\n\nSite Navigation[]\n\nRoyal Family:Palace Staff:Sand-Sand Clan and Rebels:Rainbase:Other Citizens:Citizens (Non-Canon):\n\nAbilitiesDevil Fruit Based:Weapons Based:Support:\n\nRelated ArticlesLocations:Groups:Story Arcs:Cover Stories:Movies:Specials:Others:\n\nMonkey Family:Gol/Portgas Family:Nefertari Family:\n\nNefertari Vivi\n\nNefertari Cobra (Deceased)†\n\nNefertari D.
