        "text": "On 2 Nov 1972, HR announced that Playboy Productions and Max L. Raab Productions had purchased the feature film rights to actor-playwright Jason Miller’s 1972 play, That Championship Season. Production was scheduled to begin shortly after Miller completed work as an actor in The Exorcist (1973, see entry). The 13 Feb 1973 Var reported the involvement of producer William M. McCutchen and Warner Bros. Pictures, and named Playboy Productions founder Hugh Hefner as executive producer. The 14 May 1973 DV stated that Robert Mulligan had been hired to direct for another Playboy producer, Edward Rissien. The following year, a 10 Apr 1974 HR news item indicated that Warner Bros. was no longer involved in the project, and was instead replaced by Columbia Pictures.\n\nAfter more than four years of delayed production, however, the 15 Oct 1979 HR reported that rights to the property had reverted to Miller, along with the original $500,000 paid by Playboy and Raab. At the time, Miller was reportedly negotiating a financing deal with an unidentified producer from Tokyo, Japan. On 23 Apr 1980, Var confirmed that Miller had secured Japanese financing and announced that he would make his feature filmmaking debut by directing his own screenplay. Jack Lemmon was rumored for the role of “Coach Delaney,” while Paul Sorvino and Charles Durning were expected to reprise their characters from the stage production; however, only Sorvino appeared in the final film. Principal photography was scheduled for Jun 1980. During script rewrites, Miller considered adding additional characters and multiple exterior scenes. Later that summer, the 21 Aug 1980 DV stated that the picture’s $5.6 cost million was now being financed by former Chicago, IL, attorney and first-time executive producer Jay Freedman and his wife, Nancy Freedman. The property was purchased for $300,000 by The Peterson Co., which would partner with Broken Bow Productions. Along with Sorvino and Durning, Jason Robards, Ed Flanders, and Mike McGuire were listed among the cast. 10 Oct 1980 DV production charts reported an anticipated production start date of 29 Oct 1980 in Scranton, PA.\n\nHowever, the following summer, a 24 Jun 1981 LAT article named William Friedkin as the project’s new director and producer, while Miller was allowed to retain complete control over the use of his screenplay, which had been revised to a second draft. Friedkin planned two weeks of rehearsals to precede a six-week shoot in Oct 1981, hoping to begin before the anticipated Directors Guild of America (DGA) strike. Miller was expected to star alongside George C. Scott, Nick Nolte, and Martin Sheen. The 31 Jul 1981 DV later reported that Scott had dropped out of the picture, a decision which a 7 Jul 1982 Var article attributed to unmet salary demands. A 27 Aug 1981 DV brief also included Jackie Gleason among the actors who had been considered to play Coach Delaney, but William Holden was cast after he re-read the script and dismissed his initial reservations about playing a leading role. The actor planned to travel to LaCosta, CA, that week to “get in shape” before rehearsals began 1 Oct 1981.\n\nAccording to a 6 Jul 1981 NYT news item, Friedkin and Miller had been scouting locations in Scranton for both exterior and interior filming. A 26 Aug 1981 Var article reported that the planned Sep 1981 casting sessions and 6 Oct 1981 production start date had been delayed until spring 1982. However, PA Bureau of Film Promotion employee Amy Woods stated that plans to film in Harrisburg, PA, remained indefinite, and Scranton businessman Ralph Lomma, who donated his office to be used for production facilities, learned that the project would not move forward due to Friedkin’s upcoming commitment to direct a Broadway stage play titled Duet for One later that year. Miller blamed the delay on salary negotiations with two of the actors, whose agents demanded $750,000 upfront payment, instead of the agreed-upon deal for $250,000 and share of box-office profits. The total budget had been adjusted to $5.3 million.\n\nA 17 Nov 1981 DV article claimed that the film was rescheduled to begin production in May 1982, but noted that Holden was no longer involved, due to his recent death on 12 Nov 1981. A 1 Aug 1982 NYT story stated that Miller then decided to indefinitely postpone production until he could negotiate a deal that would allow him to make the film the way he wanted. After many financiers expressed concern about the subject of American basketball not performing well in overseas markets, producers Mehem Golan and Yoram Globus agreed to finance the picture with a strict budget, but allowed Miller to add eleven additional speaking roles to the film. The 2 Jun 1982 Var listed Robert Mitchum as Holden’s replacement, with Sorvino, Sheen, Bruce Dern, and Stacy Keach completing the confirmed principal cast. Four of the actors accepted reduced upfront salaries in exchange for twelve percent of box-office profits. Final production was financed and distributed by Golan and Globus’ Cannon Group, Inc., also known as Cannon Films, Inc. According to a 9 Aug 1982 Newsweek article, production was preceded by rehearsal in Los Angeles, CA.\n\n13 Jul 1982 HR production charts confirmed that principal photography began 7 Jul 1982 in Scranton, for Hollywood European Productions, Inc. The 7 Jul 1982 Var stated that exteriors would be shot in PA over a three-week period, with 800 Scranton residents hired as minor characters and background actors. Mitchum was scheduled to begin work there 15 Jul 1982. The 1 Aug 1982 NYT reported that the production schedule consisted of twelve-hour days and six-day weeks, and Newsweek reported that Scranton Mayor James B. McNulty frequently visited the set. The article claimed that an unpaid extra named Mary Trischetta was given a speaking role opposite Sheen in the Jermyn Hotel, but her scene is not included in the final film and Trischetta is not credited onscreen. A scene featuring background actors at a local shopping mall was also omitted from the picture. In addition, the 19 Jul 1982 DV reported that the NY Photographers Local 644 union agreed to allow Hollywood Local 659 cinematographers to work without PA Local 644 supervision. After filming was completed in PA, the 2 Jun 1982 Var stated that production would move to Zoetrope Studios in Hollywood, CA, for interior filming.\n\nA 1 Sep 1982 HR advertisement announced the completion of principal photography and listed the film’s world premieres on 10 Dec 1982 in New York City and Los Angeles, CA. A 7 Jul 1982 Var brief indicated that Cannon Films planned to release the film exclusively at New York City’s Twin Theater and Los Angeles’s Crest Theatre. The 16 Dec 1982 Beverly Hills Post reported that That Championship Season was honored at AFI’s Filmex Society’s annual Winter Benefit at the AMPAS Samuel Goldwyn Theater in Beverly Hills, CA, with proceeds funding the spring 1983 Los Angeles International Film Exposition.\n\nOn 5 Feb 1999, Screen International announced that Paul Sorvino planned to direct and star in a television remake of the film for Showtime and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Worldwide Television, with Vincent D’Onofrio, Tony Shalhoub, Gary Sinise, and Terry Kinney also among the cast.\n\nEnd credits include “Special Thanks to the City of Scranton, Mayor James B. McNulty and his Administration, Michele Casale and the Pennsylvania Film Board, the Scranton Times, the Scranton Tribune, the Scranton Public Theater, WDAU Ch. 22, Joseph Flannery, Ellen Langan, Jim Langan, John Churilla, and Walter McGinn, with fondest memory.” Credits also note that Jason Miller’s original 1972 play was previously “Presented on the stage by the New York Shakespeare Festival, Produced by Joseph Papp.”\n\nLess\n\nOne month before the mayoral election in Scranton, Pennsylvania, citizens attend an outdoor fundraising picnic to support the campaign of incumbent candidate George Sitkowski. George gives a speech and unveils an elephant named Tilly, which he purchased as a gift for the city. A week later, George and his campaign manager, school principal James Daley, learn that Tilly died of an unknown illness. They attend an emergency city council meeting to discuss how to discreetly dispose of the elephant’s corpse, jokingly proposing multiple outlandish suggestions. That afternoon, James’s younger brother, Tom, arrives in Scranton for the first time in three years, and is greeted by their friend, Italian American strip mining millionaire Phil Romano. Meanwhile, James schedules a conference between the candidate and the town newspaper editor, Eddie. During the meeting, George threatens to blackmail Eddie to prevent him from publishing photographs of the dead elephant, but Eddie refuses. The next day, Phil and Tom oversee the transport of Tilly’s corpse until a television news reporter arrives, and the crane accidentally drops the elephant. Later, Phil and James see a billboard of George’s opponent, Norman Sharmen, whom they criticize for changing his Jewish surname, “Sharmawitz.” Tom walks through town, looking into several vacant storefronts. Later, George asks Tom to be his speechwriter and reveals that Sharmen plans to break an underhanded lease agreement he made to maintain the mining properties that earned Phil’s fortune. George also says he intends to promote James to school superintendent after his re-election. As the two friends laugh about high school memories, James and Phil arrive, followed by their former basketball instructor, Coach Delaney, who is surprised by Tom’s presence. While visiting the now-vacant high school, the men enter the gymnasium and re-enact their 1957 state championship game. Afterward, they drink a toast to an absent teammate named Martin. When George mentions that Sharmen has accused him of corruption, Phil complains that tax increases and massive economic depression have hurt the candidate’s image. In response, George boasts about the city’s low rape and murder numbers since he took office. Suddenly, Coach Delaney doubles over in pain and asks to return home. While the coach rests, George insists he only broke a few stitches from a recent surgery, but Tom worries that he is ill. On the porch, Phil expresses his reservations about George’s ability to win the election, comparing his public persona to the cartoon character Bugs Bunny. James reveals he knows that Phil has been having an affair with George’s wife, Marion. Regardless of the election outcome, Phil maintains that he will still negotiate with rival candidate Sharmen about his existing lease agreement in order to keep his property. George joins them and announces he hopes to win the election after exposing one of Sharmen’s relatives as a Communist who was blacklisted in the 1950s. James becomes annoyed that George did not share the information with him previously, and Phil insists the public will not find the information as scandalous as George believes. Later, James jealously criticizes Phil’s wealthy lifestyle and reveals his teammate’s affair with Marion. Upset, George raises a shotgun at Phil, but Coach Delaney takes the weapon away. Once Phil provides details explaining the affair, Coach Delaney speaks about his past as a member of the Jesuit order, and encourages the men to stay together in order to help George get re-elected. Intoxicated, Tom leaves to sit on the porch swing, but listens to the conversation through the open window. As Coach Delaney urges James to highlight Sharmen’s weaknesses in the race, Tom drunkenly clambers upstairs. George turns on the television to watch Sharmen’s campaign advertisement, which refers to Phil and George as greedy, corrupt businessmen. Phil then telephones Sharmen, threatening to reveal the information about his Communist relative, while James wonders if attacking Sharmen’s Jewish heritage will appear anti-Semitic. Tom reappears and falls down the staircase, but remains unharmed. James forbids his brother from drinking and cries while he recollects caring for their abusive, alcoholic father. He then pressures George to accept Phil’s campaign money despite his deception. Coach Delaney also encourages the candidate not to divorce his wife. At the dining room table, Tom ignores James’s orders and continues to drink, later excusing himself to go outside, where he finds Phil snorting cocaine in the garage. After Phil cleans up the residue, James joins them and proposes that he run for mayor. Before he can elaborate, however, George summons James inside to speak with Coach Delaney. A few minutes later, James storms out of the living room after learning that Phil wants George to fire him as campaign manager. Phil reveals James’s idea to run for office, causing a fight to erupt. Once the men regain their composure, George announces that he telephoned Marion, who insists she only instigated the affair to ensure Phil would contribute money to her husband’s campaign. As Tom prepares to leave, he confronts Coach Delaney about their absent teammate, Martin, who despises the coach for encouraging him to hurt an opposing player on the court. Tom raises his fists to fight, the older man responds by shoving him out the front door. As Tom trudges away, Coach Delaney, James, George, and Phil listen to the radio broadcast of their winning game. Phil tearfully apologizes to George, and they embrace. George accepts James as his campaign manager, and Tom returns to the house to retrieve his basketball jersey. His friends welcome him back, and George insists he stay to work as his speechwriter. Together, the five men pose in front of a tripod camera to take a photograph with their championship trophy.\n\nLess"
