        "text": "You will find that there are quite a few Hosies in Scotland, for which the name can be traced back to the 11th century. There are 2 lines of thinking: 1. that it?s a Scots misspelling of the Spanish Jose, decedents of Spanish sailors. 2. That the name is a Scots misspelling of Huzzey, a family which came to fight with William the Conqueror in 1066 (Norman invasion of England) some of the family settled Leicestershire and migrated North to Scotland over years.Here is a specific historical example, such a place exists and I live less than 20 miles from it. In 1411 the lands on the north side of the River Urie and between Bennachie and Inverurie were the setting for the Battle of Harlaw - a bloody conflict between Donald, Lord of the Isles, and Alexander, Earl of Mar (who was supported by the Provost and Baillies of Aberdeen). The battle coincided with the marriage of a young man called Hosie and his betrothed. As news arrived that a band of Highlanders were approaching Harlaw, Hosie left the side of his bride and joined in the fight. Although Hosie was on the victorious side he made the mistake of pursuing the defeated Highlanders too ardently and was captured and was imprisoned in a dungeon in the Hebrides. Some years later he managed to escape and returned home, intending to take the hand of his waiting bride to be - unfortunately it had been assumed that Hosie had died and she married another. The forlorn Hosie died of a broken heart and his kinsmen buried him next to the Rushmill Burn on the northern slope of Bennachie close to a well. From that time on it was known as Hosie?s Well and the waters that rise in it are said to be tears of the broken hearted HosieI have travelled about a bit (Americas, Europe, Asia) and have never really came across many Hosies, but I am aware that there are some in USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, all countries founded on migration. There are a few in other regions of the UK but for density per head of population you will find most in Scotland.\n\nWow, this page is still going even from my original post in 2004. I see a lot of Hosey's out there. One of my favorites is from W hosie from Scotland. But there is a miss representation there. The story of a spainish sailor is false. The line of Hosey from Scotland and Ulster or the Irish are decendant of the Normans.First found in Kent where they were seated from very early times and were granted lands by Duke William of Normandy, their liege Lord, for their distinguished assistance at the Battle of Hastings in 1066 A.D.Search the Internet and you will find refrence to Hosey Hill in Kent.The line went north and was also granted tracks in Irealand.Durning the 1600's there was a rebelion with James II and we immigrated to a few diffrent contries. Now this line went to the hills of West Virginia because it looked much like the native lands of Scotland. There were a few other families that went with and today the high school is named the Highlanders in the central hills of West Virginia.While there are no paper trails and just the coats of Hearaldry and legend to point in the correct direction.Now with DNA we can trace the roots back further and my brother has started a Hosey DNA project. We have learned that my families origins are of what was said above. And that the Alabama family is the same with a diffrent root father 900 years ago (about). The Hosey's in the States from Tenn are traced to Pakistan. Search the internet and you will find pages from Pakistan that has Hosey on it. I truly forget what it was and don't read aribic but there is a connection. For other parts like Australia and New Zealand and I would bet South Africa you will probably find parts of our very distant clan that can be traced back to the Vikings and Normandy. Wich in a sense came from Germany and Netherlands.Also look I was told by my brother that National Geographic has published papers on the Hosey family and has used DNA to trace this family from the States to the UK to Normandy to Germany to Turkey and the middle east to Afrika. Should be an interesting paper.Although I would have to disagree with the most populous being in Scottland. At last check there were just under 5000 in the States. But like above there are three family clans if you will that use this name. Two of wich are probably one but the DNA is not refined to go back this far but says that we are from the same area.On a second part I am married to a gal that her maiden name is McCourt and here Mom was a Gregory. My mother a Gilles. Well you can't get much more Scotch Irish than that now can you. Also blended in were some German for good measure. LOLToday I am sitting in North Walsham, England trying to listen to a Scotsman and asking him to repeat. I suppose the language has turned and we have had to change to a slower pace for speaking beacause of letting all the other nationalities hear us clearly and slowly that we now just speak slowly. A by product really.Have a good day to all.\n\nI am a Hosie. I have three sons and a daughter...and, of course, a wife. (Couldn't manage the kids without the wife.) My oldest is John William Hosie IV. My daughter is Katherine. Next is Josiah Bernhard Hosie. (His first name is from our ancestor, Josiah Bartlett, signer of the Declaration of Independence, and his middle name from Bernard Nilssen, my wife's grandfather.)The youngest is Jeremiah Daniel Hosie. He was named from the Bible, (Jeremiah) and my brother, Daniel. And he claims that some day he will change his last name to Hosea so he can be named entirely for biblical prophets.My boys are in the process of putting together a Hosies web page. It will eventually be displayed on our web site at http://www.todaysgnus.com. But the site is up and down, so don't expect anything soon.I'm looking for a Hosie Coat of Arms and a Hosie plaid for the background on the web site. (See below for anecdote about the coat of arms.) Any help in finding them would be appreciated.I was born and raised in Huntington township on Long Island in New York. Most of my youth was spent living on Eaton's Neck. My father, John William Hosie, was born and raised in the state of Wisconson and East Aurora, New York.My father's father, John William Hosie, was raised near Buffalo, NY. His father, John William Hosie, was born in Canada. And his father, Andrew Hosie, came to Canada from Scotland.Now, those of you who can count may have noticed that I am John William Hosie III, and that there are at least 3 other John William Hosie's who were my ancestors. One might think it unusual that I am known as III. But the truth is that family tradition had it that the eldest Hosie of a given name was Senior, next in line was Junior, and so on. When Senior passed away, Junior was promoted, etc.I broke that tradtion. (Sacre Bleu)I'm in the hunt for the Hosie Coat of Arms. About 10 years ago I found (and later lost) a coat of arms on the internet. It was on the web page of a Robin Hosie, who was at a university in Australia. I have the impression that she played saxaphone, and may have studied marine biology. She also may have been originally from New Zealand. In any case, she had it on her web page.It was a photo of a carved and painted coat of arms that was on the web page of a James Hosie, who was a councilman somewhere in or around Orange County, New York. It was made from a photo taken by his father (I believe) who had found a sign post at a crossroads with the Hosie Coat of Arms on it when he was in Scotland during WWII. There was a cross in the upper left, and alternating red and white stripes on the remainder, with fleur de lis here and there on the white stripes. I'd know it if I saw it again. And I did see it again a couple of years ago on another web page from upstate New York, in the arms of a young bride, who was given it by an uncle or inlaw. It was the same design. But she had her arm across part of it, so it wasn't the type of thing I could put on a web page.But I have been asking for a while and the most I have come up with is someone telling me of a green and yellow one, and someone else sending me a blue and white one. Neither is close to the one I remember. So I am still looking.As for the rest of my family, I have 3 sisters and a brother. My brother passed away several years ago.My father has two brothers and a sister. The brothers are twins. One of them had 5 boys and a girl. The other had two girls and a boy. And my father's sister had two sons and a daughter. I will leave it to all of them to post their own details if they like. It is a matter of privacy.One other item to note is a piece of family legend. My grandfater was raised by his mother alone. His own father went off to the state of Maine to find work, and died there after eating bad shellfish, I am told. So my grandfather was raised from the age of 4 by his mother. To survive, she worked as a cook at a farm in upstate New York. My grandfather had the job of collecting eggs from the chicken house. He had a problem with a particularly nasty chicken. It kept pecking at his hand every time he tried to get an egg from the nest. And as any inventive 4 year old might, he decided to get even with the chicken. So the next time it happened, he pulled out his matches and lit the chicken's nest on fire with the chicken still in it. As you might imagine, this was not the brightest thing a young man might do. And after the chicken coop had burned down, he was never in the good graces of the farmer again.\n\nMy name is Hosie Williams.I am 89.As you may know, I have been on this pitiful excuse for a planet for a very long time.I have seen many great things in my day and heard of many names, but I have never heard of a name more beautiful than Hosie.I had a brother named Owzie and a cousin named Ottis...but mother always said that my name was special.Back in the war, I had my two feet removed and replaced with pegs.I also have to walk with two canes to balance myself.My great-nephew Alexander makes fun of me because he is very jealous of me and my beautiful name.He also hates me because I am as handsome as the elephant man and he is stuck with the tall, skiny body and face of Guy Pearce {you know, the australain actor} and that's the truth.I know this may sound strange to some of you, but as a Hosie I felt it was my place to post this little story about myself and who I am! I was born and raised in Boston and later moved to New York City with my brother who married and had a lovely daughter named Anne.When Anne grew up, she married a man named Alexander Edward Hartdegen and had a daughter named Susan and then that little brat Alex came along.I can't stand him.I never married because I felt it was a waste of my time.I did not want the burdon of a wife and children after seeing how miserable my brother was.I decided to take my sneaky cousin's advice and live the life of freedom.But ever since my nephew, Alex brought home that gorgeous 20 year old foxy lady, Jane I've been having second thoughts about that.I know she wishes she was my girlfriend.But who can blame the poor girl?Especially when your boyfriend looks like Guy Pearce...that little worm!I also know a young man named Hector.He's 35 a little older than Alex.I hate him.He's not like us Hosies.We're very social and fun creatures.We are loving, tempting and extrordinary.A Hosie is not just someone with a beautiful name, there is just something about us that's special.Well, I hope you all enjoyed my little post.Yes, it's all true!I have to go...I think I wet my diaper again.Wish me luck with getting Alex to help me clean myself up.That's the way it is when you're an old man.You have to go all the time and you have no control at all!Remimber...If you're a Hosie, BE PROUD!\n\nI'd like this forwarded to Dan Hosea, who posted the following comment:\"Posted by Dan HoseaFebruary 27, 2007 04:50 PM:Any known connection between Hosie-Hosey-and Hosea. Hosea's seem to be common to eastern Scotland around 1750.\"According to \"North Carolina: Rebuilding an Ancient Commonwealth,\" Volume IV, by the American Historical Society, Inc. 1928 (page 147): Daniel Hosea was born in eastern North Carolina and died in Wayne County, where his entire life was spent after he had reached young manhood, and where he was long engagedin farming. He married Harriet Bell, who was born in the rural regions of Wayne County, and dide near Pikeville (NC).It continues: The Hosea family was founded in North Carolina by Robert Hosea, who came here from England, having been granted 600 acres of land by the Crown that was located in Perquimans County (also in NC), and on it he located permanently. Two of his sons served in the American Revolution.My father was the Rt. Reverend Addison Hosea, the 4th Episcopal Bishop of the Diocese of Lexington, born 1914, deceased 1985. My brother is Addison Hosea III. My dad's father was Addison (1882-1929), the son of William H. Hosea, and grandson of Daniel Hosea. William H. (for Herbert) Hosea lived from 1831 to 1892.I have a letter dated 1939 to my father indicating \"Daniel Hosea, of unknown connection, made a deed (signed) in Pasquitanck County on September 13, 1777: for 370 pounds proclamation money, to Joseph Davis certain land S.W. of the Pasquotank River, part of a plantation on which Abraham Davis lived and died (Deed Book K, p. 180).\"The earliest mention of the Hosea family I've found (via the 1939 letter to my father) is a mention of Robert Hosea who made his will in Perquimans County on December 17, 1742, probated in January Court, 1743; the source cited was Grimes, ABSTRACT OF NORTH CAROLINA WILLS, p. 172.I have a memory that the Hosea's came through Boston in the early 1700's; I recalling hering of two Hosea's: one was a doctor and one was illiterate. I'll continue to review papers and see if I find any more specific information.My family understood the name \"Hosea\" was Welsh, because the people of Wales took their last names from the Bible during the \"Great Survey\" of 1086 (i.e., the Domesday Book).Thanks."
