        "text": "Jerome Kass, who wrote the Tony-nominated book for the 1978 Broadway musical “Ballroom,” which was adapted from his own Emmy-nominated teleplay about older people who salve their loneliness on the dance floor, died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was 78.\n\nThe cause was prostate cancer, said his wife, the writer Delia Ephron.\n\nMr. Kass was the author of a handful of Off Broadway works, and among his other television credits is the mini-series “Evergreen” (1985), which was based on a best-selling novel by Belva Plain and, starring Lesley Ann Warren, followed a half-century or so in the New York life of a Jewish immigrant from Poland.\n\nHis best-known work was “Queen of the Stardust Ballroom” (1975), an effective and adventurous melodrama focusing on, as John J. O’Connor wrote in his review in The New York Times, “people who are generally ignored by the conspicuous-consumer pursuits of television programming.”\n\nThe story of a Bronx widow who finds companionship and more in the arms of a married mailman she meets at a local dance hall, the movie starred Maureen Stapleton and Charles Durning. In addition to the script — which was “liberally dusted with compassionate insights,” Mr. O’Connor wrote — it included original music by Billy Goldenberg and lyrics by Marilyn and Alan Bergman, who also collaborated on the score for the stage show, as well as choreography by Marge Champion."
