Donnison is of Irish origin. It is believed to be derived from the Irish name Donnghaile which means ‘unlucky’.

It is believed that the Donnery family were initially Viking settlers and later intermarried with the local Gaelic families, thus creating unique variants and spellings that are still used to this day.\n\nNo matter how it is spelt, the Donnison surname will always be linked to Irish origins, giving it a unique sense of origin and history.\n\nFamous people with the name Donnison\n\nThomas Donnison: The eldest of six children of Col.
