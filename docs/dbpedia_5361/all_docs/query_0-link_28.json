The experimental work carried out there was secret but bombs were dropped into the Bay and retrieved when the tide went out, and taken to the laboratory for examination --or so the story went. One of the Americans was Charlie Lane, the husband of Helen Durning. Helen was a nurse at the VG Hospital in Halifax, perhaps just in training. Charlie had the use of a navy Jeep to come to Halifax to see her. I don't have his obituary as it wasn't published here to my knowledge but he died in New York, and was living in Pawtucket, R.I. at the time of his death on May 23, year unknown. His name was Charles Leith Lane.\n\nMargaret\n\n----- Original Message -----\n\nFrom: David Winter <mailto:davidwinter@...>\n\nTo: nscumber <mailto:nscumber@yahoogroups.com>\n\nSent: Wednesday, October 30, 2013 7:55 AM\n\nSubject: [nscumber] Obit: Lane, Helen Rose [nee Durning]\n\nLane (Durning), Helen Rose\n\nHelen Rose (Durning) Lane, 89, of Florence, S.C., died Thursday, October 24, 2013, in McLeod Hospice House.
