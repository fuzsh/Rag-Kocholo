        "text": "Our early American families on many occasions used the name Ashbald,the early English name. However, it was also spelled Ashball,Asball, Ashbal, Asbille,Asbill, ect. As time went on, Ashbald became Asbald,Ashbell,Aeschbald,Asbal,Asbell,Asbel,\n\nAsbill,Archbal,Azbell,Azbill,Azbil,Ayersbaland in a few cases Ashburn,ect.Today the most populas spelling is Asbill, Asbell, Azbill,and Azbell.\n\nWe find numerous misspellings such as Ashall, Ashbee,Ashbie and Asbitt.Many mistakes were made in copying the early hand written records.We find several cases of miscoping the letter \"b\" making it an \"h\".In our early record of George Asball and his family who lived in Linhaven Parish, Lower Norfork County, Virginia (1652), now North Carolina, his name on several occasions was copied \"Ashall\" in place of the correct name \"Asball\".\n\nAlong with the record of George Asball, we find that of Adam Asball (1652) spelled Aspull many times. This probably was due to miscopying the written record or to the spelling of the name as it sounded to those who recorded it. (Handbook of American Genoalopy, Book 47, year 1893.)\n\nIn the volume \"Immigrants to America before 1750\", Book 9, we find John Ashbel spelled John Ashbee.It is easy to understand that the last \"l\" was taken for an \"e\".In the case of Solomas Asbill, one of our Tennessee pioneers, we find his name copied \"Asbie\" in place of Asbil.The \"l\" in this case was mistaken for an \"e\".His Revolutionary and Military records were so mis-copied.\n\nDurning the Revolution, many of the Asbill's thought that there was a possibility of England's winning the war, therfore, they were cautious of giving their correct names in the Army records.James Asbill, son of Joseph of this period, signed his name \"Asbitt\" with a flourish over the two \"l's\" thus making the name appear Asbitt in place of Asbill.This could also be blamed to the copying or writing of the records by Army Officials or others.Enanuel Asbill, also a Revolutionary soldier and perhaps a son of James, had his name on the Army records spelled the same way.\n\nAlthough we find Isbills (Isbals) in early times along the Eastern Carolina coast, later in Surry County,North Carolina, still later in Madison County, Kentucky and finally in Macon County, Missouri living at the same time and in the same communities\n\nwith the Asbills, we doubt if these families are of immidiate kin.The same is true of\n\nAswells and Azwells.It is quite possible that the family differed in choosing between the English King, Charles 1, and Oliver Cromwell during the civil war in England.Since the names are so much alike it is reasonable to believe those favoring one side took the name of Asbill, while those favoringthe other took the name of Isbill or Aswell.Feeling ran very high during this time and this could have well been the case.\n\nIn later times we know that our ancestors did differ in the spelling of the family name.Some retained the orininal Asbill spelling, , while otheradopted \"Asbell\", \"Azbill\", and \"Azbell\".From our records we know that all of these three groups were of the same families.Old Uncle Billy (son of William of Revolutionary times) spelled his name Azbill.Old Uncle Billy had a falling out with his brotherJoseph over the spelling but admitted that the correct spelling should be Asbill.We find that the descendents of the William Azbill and Malinda Ross (Idian) marriage used the \"Azbill\" name while the descendents of the William Asbill and Elizabeth Moore marriage followed the \"Asbill\" name."
