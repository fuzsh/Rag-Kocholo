        "text": "LOS ANGELES — On Oscar night everyone is dying — sometimes literally — to win something.\n\nSince March 21, 1994, when the first regular obituary segment was dropped into an Academy Awards show, a spot on the yearly scroll of recently deceased movie luminaries has become one of the evening’s most hotly contested honors. And as in most Oscar races it is the focus of sometimes ferocious campaigning.\n\nThis time around it is a safe bet that Ernest Borgnine, Charles Durning, Nora Ephron, Tony Scott, Richard Zanuck and Marvin Hamlisch will get their few seconds in a roughly three-minute remembrance.\n\nBeloved figures all. But who fills the next 30 or so spots in the memorial for this year’s show, which takes place on Feb. 24 at the Dolby Theater, is open to debate. And that debate is under way at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, where a committee of members whose names are discreetly concealed from other members and the public are measuring celebrity, weighing achievement and trying to ward off entreaties from those who believe a loved one, friend or former client should have a last moment in the limelight.\n\n“Unfortunately, my calls to the Academy were not returned,” Sheldon Roskin, a longtime publicist, said in an e-mail this week, of his efforts to lobby for the inclusion of Tommy Culla, a public relations colleague unknown to moviegoers.\n\n“Of all the committees, it’s the hardest one to do,” said Tom Sherak, whose three years as president of the Academy ended last year.\n\n“The committee’s names are never mentioned, ever,” Mr. Sherak added.\n\nHe and others spoke of a process that has shifted responsibility for the obituary roll call from a narrow group that once mainly included the Oscar show producer and both the president and the executive director of the Academy to a slightly broader group of insiders who now must choose a few dozen peers from this year’s especially large group of about 500 candidates.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
