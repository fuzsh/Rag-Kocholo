My 2nd great grandfather was Charles Mallory. He was born somewhere in New York state between 1835 and 1845. At some point around 1868-1869 he married to Harriette Belle Silloway. She was born 26 Nov 1847 at China (now Arcade), Wyoming Co., N.Y. the daughter of William and Grace Prudence (Davis) Silloway. In 1870, I can locate Charles Mallory, his wife Harriette and their son, Carl Clayton Mallory bn. 31 May 1870 in Missouri, residing at Jasper Twp., Jasper Co., Mo. listed as post office Carthage, Mo. Charles has given his occupation as carpenter and painter. On 13 Nov 1876, Harriette Belle Mallory marries second at Eaton Rapids, Eaton Co., Mi. to Albert C. Darling. In the History of Eaton Co., a brief biography of Albert states that the husband of his second wife, Belle was Charles Mallory and that he had died in Missouri. Two sisters and a brother of Belle were already living in Michigan. No death record can be found for Charles at Jasper Co. Missouri as records were not kept there that early. After scouring the census records between 1850 and 1880 for the state of NY and coming up with many Charles Mallorys that fit the age criteria for my Charles; I can eliminate most because they either died before 1870 or are still in the various town in 1880 or were married to someone else in 1870. There is a Charles W. Mallory, bn 1843 in Hamden, Delaware Co., the son of William and Frances Mallory. In 1850, this father gives his occupation as a carpenter. In 1860, he is now a farmer and Charles is listed as a student. In 1870, Charles is gone. I have perused the Delaware Co. site and see no record of Charles showing up after 1860. Is it possible that this is my Charles? The distance between Delaware and Wyoning Counties seems to be a great ways and I have no explaination as to how these two young people would have met; but so far, this Charles seems to be my best bet.

His family came from Delaware Co., which is where many lived and died. He, however, moved to Elmira, Chemung Co., NY in the early part of the century. His name was Lorin William McCumber, son of John Y. and Emma (Van Deusen) McCumber. He was divorced and living with his son in Elmira by the 1920 and 1930 census. However, the city directory indicates that both he and his son, my grandfather Leon, left the area prior to the printing of the 1930 city directory. There is no record of them at all. In the 1939 city directory, however, my grandfather reappears WITHOUT my great grandfather, which leads me to believe he died before that. Requests to Chemung Co. Vital Records, as well as all cemeteries in Chemung Co., have revealed no record of my great grandfather as having died there. I suspect that he and my grandfather may have returned to the Delaware Co. area after 1929, until my great grandfather died, and then my grandfather returned to Elmira. The areas where Lorin's family lived are: Andes, Margaretville, and Bovina. He definitely died before the mid-40's, as his sister's (Cora) obituary (in Kansas) did not list him among her surviving siblings. Any help in finding information on Lorin W.

However, I recently received information written in 1890 by William's grandson, Edward More Seacord, that lists Edward's paternal grandmother as Anna Nichols and that she was born in Bedford, NY. I am wondering if Anna was born to Samuel and Mary Orr McCune and was married to a Nichols before marrying William Seacord? But where does Bedford, NY fit in? Anna and William had a son, my gggrandfather, James McCune Seacord. In Mr. Hoy's work, there is listed James McCune, son of Samuel and Mary, who married Phoebe Ann Nichols.

He may have been married three times - Anna Eliza Wells, Sarah Wells, and Julia Faulkner. I'm specifically looking for the three marriages and any baptisms of their children - Joel C., Anna Eliza, Levi, Almond, etc.\n\nJoel's obituary in the Kingston Daily Freeman states that he died November 28, 1915 in Franklin and was the son of George and Eliza Wells Metcalf. Horace Metcalf's death certificate shows that he was the son of George Metcalf and Anna E. Wells. He was born February 28, 1839 in Delaware County, NY, and I specifically believe in Masonville. The death certificate for Levi Metcalf shows him as the son of George Metcalf and Sarah Wells. There is an Almond G. Metcalf buried in Ouelout Valley Cemetery with dates 1833 - 1855. The Bloomville Mirror states his death as March 6, 1855.\n\nGeorge is documented as having seat rents in Masonville Presbyterian in 1825 and 1826. He is in Masonville in the 1830 census and in Davenport in the 1840 census. I am hoping to be able to help me track down a Wells family with both Sarah and Anna E. as the pattern has been with some in that time frame to marry a sister or other female close relation when there where children to raise. I still firmly believe that the Analiza buried in Davenport Cemetery is the Anna E. on Horace's death certificate. Additionally, I am given to believe, as of today's new information, that Sarah was George's first wife and Anna Eliza the second. I am at a loss as how to find any more information and could use some local assistance from church records.

I believe he is the same Frederick that was one of the first settlers in the area. Frederick and one of his brothers joined a few of the Shavers on their journey up the Delaware River eventually they came across some land they thought would make a good homestead. They settled down and built one house for the Shavers and Millers could live in durning the up and coming winter. The Millers were experienced trappers and good at it. After getting some animal skins tougher Frederick and one of the Shaver men ventured into town to sell their goods to get food and items they needed. They learned a few things from the local Indians such as what berries are good to eat and what trees make the best for shelter. I don't have much information on Frederick or his brothers but this is what I have:\n\nFrederick's 2 brothers were Pieter married Margareet Chesiham, christened Hendrik in Colchester 1764 and Samuel married Rebecca Schafer they also christened their son Schephert in Colchester 1796.\n\n*Frederick Miller that was born in about 1753 married Maria Elizabet Lang, they had 5 boys and 3 girls. I have the names of the boys but not the girls. *Frederick; *Jacob; *Peter Miller was born in 1787 and christened 14 Feb 1796 in Delaware county. He married Phoebe Effie Rose. Peter was my 4th great grandpa; *David; *John\n\nIf anyone can help me with my research I would greatly appreciate it. Jodi A.
