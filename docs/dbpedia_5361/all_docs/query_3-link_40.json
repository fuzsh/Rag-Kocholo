        "text": "Louden\n\nLooking for information on James George Louden. DOB around 1870-1880. His descendants are known as follows, his son, Lawrence Leroy Louden born 1903, grandson, Alfred Lawrence Louden born 1941?, great grandson, Alfred Lawrence Louden II born 1969. Information stops at James George Louden. I found this information on the deceased's social security card applications. Lawrence Leroy has listed James George as his father. I can find no information on him. All are from the Illinois/Pennsylvania area. I have recently come across information on the original Loudens. I was hoping someone could place the originals in the family tree I already have begun. I do not know if they are related in any way but, that is what I need to find out. The original story is as follows --- The Louden family originally came from Ireland and the first recorded marriage in the Parish books is that of George Louden and Elizabeth Cuttbertson in September 1655. Their descendants, John (born 1659), George (born 1680), and William (born ??) apparently led peaceful and useful lives in as much their names appear in the Parish records and not in the police records. John's sons were restless. Robert (John's son) as a young lad made a trip to Scotland to visit relatives. He didn't care for Scotland nor his relatives but lost his heart to Rebecca Jane Scott (who was the sister of Walter Scott the writer) and promptly slept with her. In those days in Scotland that constituted a legal marriage. Rebecca and Robert were promptly disowned by the Scott family so they returned to Ireland and were also disowned by the Louden family. Marrying out of the Parish in those days was considered worse than high treason. The youngsters traipsed off to America and settled in Philadelphia. For several years, Robert worked as a weaver in the daytime and at night he helped increase the population. It might be interesting to relate that Rebecca and Walter would never have been born had it not been for some thieves who dug up Rebecca's mother for the jewels buried with her. Apparently Scottish doctors didn't use stethoscopes in those days and Rebecca's mother had been buried alive. The thieves attempted to cut a ring from her finger and she sat up, screamed, and scared ten years off the thieves happy lives. She crawled home, scratched on the door at dawn, and scared her father into a heart attack. This story is not heresay but was authenticated by \"Ripley's Believe It or Not\". Robert and Rebecca were displeased by Philadelphia so Bob took a boat trip to New Orleans and up the Mississippi River, landed in St Louis, and headed over to French Village on the Illinois side. There he met Hiram Blake and decided to settle there. He hitchhiked back to Philadelphia over pioneer trails, sold out his weaving business, bought a covered wagon, loaded his family and household effects and traveled by Oxen over the Appalachians to Illinois. When he arrived in Trenton, he found his old friend Hiram who had left the French Village, took out a homestead, rolled up his sleeves, felled trees, made a clearing, built a log cabin, and became a prosperous farmer. He reared thirteen legitimate children and countless others. He died May 4th 1880at the age of 82 years. He was the first male Louden for over 200 years to live beyond 50 years of age. One of his daughters, Mary, who was steeped in family tradition and tales handed down said that many years ago a magistrate by the name of Louden sent an innocent man to the gallows and the victim screamed a curse on all male descendants that they would not live beyond fifty, his own age which was cut short unjustly. the last few years of Bob's life his spine became so curved that when he walked on the street he always had a grandchild hanging on for dear life to his coattails to keep him from falling flat on his face. It is debatable as to whether hard work caused it or his rabbit like propensities. Shortly before his death he and Rebecca sat for two days to have daugerotypes made for all thirteen children. Each exposure lasted for about thirty minutes with their necks braced with iron collars to keep from moving. The existing daugerotypes look as though both of them were angry fugitives from the monkey cage but old timers in Trenton affirm that they were both lovable and cheerful creatures. One of their greatest crosses was that one of their sons, Benjamin Franklin Louden, married Hiram Blakes daughter Charity. Hiram was a great friend of theirs but his daughter was half Indian and in those days a \"mixed breed\" was considered a very low and unsavory type of person. Robert had become a great friend of Abraham Lincoln when he was a young lawyer and the friendship strengthened as the years advanced. During the Civil War, Robert refused to join the Army and paid for a substitute and was jeered and hated in Trenton. For apparent spy activities and interest in the cause of the Confederacy he was arrested and sentenced to death at Jefferson Barracks in Saint Louis. Two times he was reprieved and finally pardoned by Lincoln. After his death it was discovered he was working all the time as a confidential agent for Lincoln and a novel later appeared written around his activities--\"The Copperhead\". At the time of his death Robert was considered one of the wealthiest farmers in southern Illinois and saw to it that all of his children were provided for. He made it so easy for them that none of them knew or appreciated the value of money. (Quite a bit longer than we usually allow as an entry, but so fascinating we made an exception - Editor)"
