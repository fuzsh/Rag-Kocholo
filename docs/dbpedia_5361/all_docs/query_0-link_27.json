It was ok. 5 out of 10\n\nTime Lapse - Very well done. 1/2 way through the movie and I was hooked. I love getting hooked wanting to know what happens next. Not a time travel movie but about time. A camera is found that can take pictures 1 day into the future. I give it 7 out of 10.\n\nSometimes we live no particular way but our own - Grateful Dead \"Eyes of the World\"\n\nzippyboy\n\nMember since: Oct 24, 2012\n\nThreads: 2\n\nPosts: 665\n\nQuote: Pacomartin\n\nFive years ago Melissa McCarthy was a low key supporting actress with many bit parts (mostly in TV) to her credit. Who would have picked her to be one of the most reliable money making movie star today?\n\nAs Americans get fatter and fatter, why wouldn't they elevate a funny fat actress to superstardom? I've read recently that for the first time ever, whites are not the majority in America. Hispanics have edges out whites by .1% point. So look in the near future for a fat Hispanic funny actress to take over superstar status.\n\nPacomartin\n\nMember since: Oct 24, 2012\n\nThreads: 1068\n\nPosts: 12569\n\nQuote: zippyboy\n\nI've read recently that for the first time ever, whites are not the majority in America.

Precision. reality. I'm not sure that a slide rule approach is appropriate for this. what is believed in the market place is perhaps more appropriate than what is reality. If everyone trying to become a tv news person adopts a latino sounding surname to get an edge, does the marketing statistical almanac have to be accurate? Is \"everyone\" an acceptable term for a tonight show joke or should a sliderule guy be consulted?\n\nIf Hollywood like sequels for financial reasons, do myths about the market demographics not qualify as equally valid reasons for choosing the don't Pass line on a movie script?\n\nOf course you can segment a market by census data but I imagine movie producers are more interested in segmenting it by spendable cash which means census data will be skewed by the uncountable money that doesn't make a bank account but still gets invested in the local economy.\n\nI've not seen many films recently but I think some of the series on tv such as breaking bad, complications, Mr.robot, have better writers and perhaps better actors, because movie makers want to hire stars and tv-series seem willing to spend money on unknowns or at least on lesser knowns. I only saw a few segments of the HbO? series about espionage in cold war germany. I don't know its budget but it seemed more interesting than any mega-budget movie about vampires, werewolves and Kryptonite.\n\nPacomartin\n\nMember since: Oct 24, 2012\n\nThreads: 1068\n\nPosts: 12569\n\nQuote: zippyboy\n\nAs Americans get fatter and fatter, why wouldn't they elevate a funny fat actress to superstardom?\n\nAs people get fatter and fatter, they still want their mega stars to be skinny. Melissa was always heavy, even when she was on a popular TV show in her early 30's.\n\nCharles Durning in his mid 50's was just a little overweight. He went on to become huge.\n\nBut most heavy actors, like Charles Durning , played character roles their whole life. I got the feeling that MM played the heavy girlfriend with a heart of gold, a kind of typical character. She become famous as a pushy vulgar loud character.\n\nVery few actors make the jump from supporting actor to lead actor in their 40's. They usually get those roles very young in life. George Clooney was in his early 30's when he became a lead actor in films. But he had a lead role in the TV series ER, and people were always trying to make him a lead actor because he was so handsome."
