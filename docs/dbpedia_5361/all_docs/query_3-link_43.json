Compare Broeder.4: Jewish (Ashkenazic): Yiddish variant of Brodsky.2: English: variant of Brother.3: Irish (Limerick): from Ó Bruadair a name of an ancient Donegal sept. Derivation from Irish bruadar ‘dream reverie’ has been suggested probably wrongly. It is more likely to be from an Irish form of the Old Norse personal name Bróthir. See Broderick.\n\nBrogan : Irish (Donegal and Mayo): Anglicized form of Gaelic Ó Brógáin ‘descendant of Brógán’ a personal name of unexplained etymology though it has been suggested that it is a diminutive of bróg ‘shoe’.\n\nBrouder : Irish: from Ó Bruadair the name of an ancient Donegal sept.

Occasionally and in the Isle of Man the surname derives from Mac Canann ‘son of Cano or Canán’ which in Ireland was Anglicized McCann or McConnon. See also Connon. The personal name is from Gaelic cano ‘wolf cub’ of which Canán is a diminutive. In Ulster Cannon may also be shortened from Ó Canannáin ‘descendant of Canannán’ a pet form (double diminutive) of the personal name. This was a cheiftan family in Donegal and the name was particularly common there.2: English: from Middle English canun ‘canon’ (Old Norman French canonie canoine from Late Latin canonicus).

The name was taken to Ulster in the 17th century.2: Manx: if not identical with 1 perhaps from the Old Norse personal name Kolbeinn with /v/ substituted for /b/.3: English: from the rare Middle English personal name Colwin Colvin which may be a borrowing into English of a Welsh name whose modern form is Collwyn ‘white’ or of colwyn ‘doe puppy pet dog’ or of the placename Colwyn (Denbighshire Radnorshire).\n\nConaghan : Scottish (Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire) Irish (Donegal): from Ó Connacháin a variant of Ó Connagáin see Cunningham.\n\nConolly : Irish (Donegal): shortened Anglicized form of Ó Conghaile or Ó Conghalaigh see Connolly.\n\nConwell : Irish (Donegal): shortened and altered form of McConville.\n\nCrossan : Irish (Donegal): shortened form of McCrossen an Anglicized form of Gaelic Mac an Chrosáin ‘son of the satirist’.\n\nCrossen : Irish (Ulster especially Donegal): shortened form of McCrossen.\n\nCrosson : Irish (Donegal): shortened and altered form of McCrossen.\n\nCrumlish : Irish (Donegal): Anglicized form of Gaelic Ó Cromruisc ‘descendant of Cromrosc’ from a byname meaning ‘squint-eyed’.\n\nCunnigham : Scottish and Irish (Donegal): variant of Cunningham.\n\nCunningham : 1: Scottish: habitational name from the province of Cunningham in Ayrshire first recorded in 1153 in the form Cunegan a Celtic name of uncertain origin.

This name is also adopted for Ó Connacháin a variant of Ó Connagáin ‘descendant of Connagán’ from a diminutive of the personal name Conn.\n\nDabo : 1: French: habitational name from a place called Dabo in Moselle.2: Croatian: from a short form of the old South Slavic personal name Dabiživ composed of the elements da bi ‘would be’ + živ ‘alive’.3: West African (mainly Senegal Mali and Guinea): from the name of the Dabo clan of the Soninke and the closely related Mandinka peoples of unexplained etymology.\n\nDanso : 1: West African (Ghana): Akan name of unexplained etymology.2: West African (Gambia and Senegal): name found among the Mandinka people of unexplained etymology.\n\nDatt : 1: German: probably from a short form of an ancient Germanic personal name formed with diot ‘people nation’ (for example Dietrich) or from tāt ‘deed’.2: Indian: Mohyal Brahmin name originally from the Gandhara region now mainly found in Gurdaspur in Punjab. Sanskrit datt or dutt ‘given bestowed or giver’ also means ‘generous’ by extension. See also Datta; compare Dutt.3: West African (Mauritania and Senegal): Tukulor name of unexplained etymology.\n\nDeath : apparently from Middle English deeth deth Old English dēaþ ‘death’ perhaps for someone who played the part of Death in a local pageant.The figure of Death occurs for example in the Chester mystery cycle. The traditional pronunciation of this surname in modern times is /di:θ/ (Deeth) which would be a normal development of Old English dēaþ besides the usual modern pronunciation of the word as /dɛθ/. In Middle English Kent dialect the word is also found as diath. The spellings with an apostrophe de'Ath de Ath D'Eath De Aeth etc. are modern introduced perhaps to dissociate the name from the negative connotations of the word and to give it an appearance of gentry status. Sir Thomas D'eath 1723 in TNA was MP for Canterbury and Sandwich and 1st Baronet D'Aeth of Knowlton (Kent). He is perhaps descended from the Death family that is recorded in the Farnborough and Dartford area since the 16th century. Such re-spellings became more popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Sampson Death aged 30 miller in Census 1841 (Roydon Essex) appears as Sampson De'Ath aged 71 born in Roydon (Essex) in Census 1881 (Bishop Stortford Herts). Martha Ann Death born in Great Waldingfield Suffolk in Census 1841 (Alpheton Suffolk) appears as Martha A. De'ath in Census 1881 (Buckingham Bucks).\n\nDeeney : Irish (Donegal): Anglicized form of Gaelic Ó Duibhne ‘descendant of Duibhne’ a byname from duibhne ‘disagreeable ill-tempered’.

Alternatively the name may be from Middle English diri a nonsense word.3: English: in Devon and Cornwall alternatively a variant of Dear from the Old English personal name Dēora where the unstressed final vowel developed to -y in local dialect.5: Irish: Anglicized form of Gaelic Ó Doiridh the name of an eccesiastical family from Donegal meaning ‘descendant of Doireadh’.

This surname is also found among the Soninke and Tukulor peoples. Compare Diao and Jah.2: Muslim: from a personal name based on Arabic ḍiyā’ ‘light glow illumination’ (see Zia). It is found e.g. in Iraq.\n\nDiaby : West African (mainly Guinea Ivory Coast Mali and Senegal): from the name of the Diaby clan of the Jakhanke or Diakhanké people of the Senegambia region which are a subgroup of the Soninke people.

Compare Jawara.\n\nDieng : 1: West African (mainly Senegal also Guinea and Mauritania): Wolof name of unexplained etymology. It is also found among the Serer and Tukulor peoples.

The name is attested much earlier as a surname in the adjacent parish of Wadhurst (Sussex) and in the neighbouring hundred of Brenchley (Kent); Brenchley itself is only six miles from Wadhurst. Downgate House in Wadhurst is recorded as Dungates in 1679 and may have been named from the family that lived there. An alternative source in eastern Kent is Dungate in Rodmersham but this is not recorded until 1591 as Dongate and one cannot altogether rule out the possibility that it was named from a branch of the Wadhurst family that had migrated there. The surname Dungate is recorded in the adjacent parish of Lynsted in 1578. The place-name derives from Middle English doun (Old English dūn) ‘hill down upland expanse’ + Middle English gate (Old English geat) ‘gateway)’.
