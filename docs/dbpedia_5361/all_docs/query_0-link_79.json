        "text": "In the 1660s the foundation of any woman’s outfit remained her linen chemise or shift, on top of which she would either wear a boned bodice or a separate pair of stays. Stays were a sort of stiff corset that originally sought to create a smooth surface to prevent the wrinkling of expensive dress textiles, but came to be appreciated for their ability to shape the woman’s body to the desired silhouette of the period. A beautiful pink 1660s pair of stays and busk survives in the Victoria & Albert Museum collection (Fig. 1). The museum explains its construction:\n\n“The stays are made by hand-stitching the watered silk to a layer of linen in long narrow pockets. Thin strips of whalebone are inserted into the pockets to give the stays their shape. Whalebone is in fact not bone, but cartilage from the mouth of the baleen whale. It grows in large sheets in the mouth of the whale and serves as a kind of sieve to filter out tiny krill, the whale’s primary source of food, from the seawater.”\n\nA 1663 painting by Jan Steen (Figs. 2-3) allows a rare glimpse of stays on a 17th-century body. This unknown woman at her toilette wears stays beneath her unfastened pink silk jacket, which is edged in white fur. As this outfit makes clear, the jacket is separate from the petticoat/skirt worn below. The white edge of her chemise is just visible beneath the gold silk petticoat; she is pulling on her stockings, which would have been held up by garters above the knee. We also see her high-heeled mules discarded at her feet—another rare glimpse as 1660s skirts were typically floor-length.\n\nGerard ter Borch the Younger’s early 1660s painting Curiosity (Fig. 4) gives a fuller picture of different styles of dressing popular in the decade. The seated woman wears a blue velvet jacket trimmed in white fur like that seen in the Steen image, though now she’s fully dressed. Opposite her, the woman in a pink bodice has pink ribbon ties attaching her sleeves like those on the stays (Fig. 1) discussed above. As the Cunningtons explain in their Handbook of English Costume in the Seventeenth Century (1972):\n\n“Close fitting and boned the bodice became again long-waisted, sloping to a deep point in front [1650-1675] some finished with short tabs flaring out over the hips (similar to the corset). Were mainly in vogue from 1660 to 1675.” (170)\n\nThe pink bodice comes to a very deep point and has a very low, off-the-shoulder neckline as was typical. As Daniel Delis Hill explains in The History of World Costume and Fashion (2011): “Necklines widened to encircle the shoulders and the sleeve armscye seam dropped onto the upper arm. Sleeves remained short.” (411)\n\nHer white satin petticoat features many cartridge pleats at the natural waistline to create a very full skirt, supported by a bum roll.\n\nCartridge pleats were sometimes also used on bodice sleeves to create the desired fullness in the elbow-length sleeves of the period. The blue silk bodice in ter Borch’s Letter (Fig. 5) features just such pleats and has yellow ribbons at the back. A green silk bodice in the Museum of London’s collection (Fig. 6) gives a sense of what these boned bodices looked like when off the body; it has a low, oval neckline and off-the-shoulder sleeves, as well as the characteristic deep point in the front and tabs at the waist. It laces up the back, which likely what the yellow ribbons in the Letter were used for (though in the painting no back-lacing is visible).\n\nTer Borch’s Lady at her Toilette (Fig. 7) actually shows a maid lacing up her mistress’s bodice. This sort of bodice would have been worn without stays. The applied silver bobbin lace trim was a popular decorative choice in the 1660s. The same sort of metallic lace can be seen edging the skirts in figures 4, 5 and 7. A rare surviving bodice and petticoat ensemble in the Fashion Museum Bath’s collection (Fig. 8) also features applied metallic lace vertically down the center front of the bodice and skirt and at its edges. Silver and silver-gilt decorations were extremely popular and are even seen adorning gloves in the period (Fig. 9) as well, as the Victoria & Albert Museum explains:\n\n“As the 17th century progressed, the shape of gloves changed. The gauntlets became smaller and the length of the fingers shortened to more natural proportions. The embroidery is much denser than at the beginning of the 17th century, with a preference for metal thread over coloured silks… The precious metals have been applied in a variety of forms: strip (broad, flat length of metal), purl (a tube of densely coiled metal), thread (a thin strip of metal wrapped around a linen or silk thread) and spangles (known now as sequins).”\n\nA 1660s bodice also in the V&A’s collection (Fig. 10) summarizes well the decade’s key trends:\n\n“Typical of 1660s fashion are the long waist, off-the-shoulder neckline and short, full, cartridge-pleated sleeves. The bodice fastening took the form of a lacing through the eyelets at the back. It has a complex understructure of boned channels and layers of linen, with a channel for a separate busk at the front. A petticoat of matching satin, with a padded roll underneath, would have been worn with the bodice, as part of a formal ensemble. The bodice is decorated with a two-coloured silk cord in mushroom and cream, and a silk bobbin lace with silk-wrapped parchment, in green, pink, yellow, black, cream and tan.”\n\nFrom a strongly Royalist family, Barbara Villiers (Fig. 1) met Charles II in 1660 while he was living in exile in The Hague. They soon became lovers and she would go on to have six children by him—five of whom were recognized by the surname Fitzroy. She was painted many times and her image became well-known and frequently reproduced.\n\nIn the 1660s, she was:\n\n“arguably the most influential woman in Britain at the time. She used her beauty to gain wealth and considerable political power, receiving from the king a generous pension, land grants, and aristocratic titles. Lely’s portrait of Villiers helped establish his reputation as well as her image as the preeminent court beauty.” (North Carolina Museum)\n\nLely claimed that “it was beyond the compass of art to give this lady her due, as to her sweetness and exquisite beauty” (Ashelford 98). Lely painted portraits of fashionable women at the royal court of which figure 1 is a part; the series became known as the “Windsor Beauties” (NC Museum). She wears a brown satin bodice that appears to be boned, with a matching petticoat as well as Lely’s signature drapery. Notable are the immense numbers of pearls worn at the neck, ears, wrist, center front of the bodice and woven into her hair—presumably gifts from Charles II.\n\nHer every move at court was closely followed and recorded, as Jane Ashelford notes in The Art of Dress: Clothes and Society, 1500-1914 (1996):\n\n“An experienced and discerning judge of female beauty, Pepys accepted that the King’s mistresses were the undisputed leaders of fashion. Barbara Villiers, Countess of Castlemaine, later Duchess of Cleveland – from 1670, was Pepys’s favourite, and his diary is full of details of his sightings of her, even keeping a record of those occasions on which he had seen her underwear laid out to dry in the Privy Garden at Whitehall Palace.” (98)\n\nA miniature of Villiers by Samuel Cooper (Fig. 2) shows her wearing a daringly low-cut bodice with open seams on the sleeves allowing her chemise to peek out. Her hair is arranged in the hurluberlu hairstyle and she wears only a single strand of pearls. Her fashion influence seems to have extended perhaps even to Charles II’s new wife, Catherine of Braganza, daughter of the King of Portugal who arrived at the court in 1662 and who appears nearly identically dressed to Villiers in a Cooper miniature (Fig. 3). Against Catherine’s wishes, Charles made Villiers one of the Queen’s ladies-of-the-bedchamber (Historic UK).\n\nShe seemed to enjoy playing different roles as she commissioned portraits in various guises, including as the goddess Minerva, as a shepherdess, as Mary Magdalene (Fig. 4) and in perhaps the most daring role, as the Madonna, with her son Charles Fitzroy as the Christ child (Fig. 5). In 1670 she was made Duchess of Cleveland.\n\nThe interview of Louis XIV and Philip IV (Fig. 3) also shows the adoption of cannons, wide ruffles at the knees that typically were fastened to the tops of the stockings (Davenport 518). Louis XIV wears a white set, while the courtier behind him has a tier of pink cannons; the Cunningtons explain: “Canons were usually attached as decorative additions to the stockings, and when worn almost always accompanied petticoat or open breeches, and were never worn with closed breeches” (161).\n\nIt was at this time that hose definitely switched from being a term for breeches to being associated with stockings (Cunningtons 158). Boots were worn less frequently, typically only for riding, but the stocking plus cannons effect resembled the earlier favored boot hose of the 1640s.\n\nFrench styles met resistance in other countries as well, but remained popular. A portrait of an unknown Dutch young man by Gerard ter Borch ca. 1663 shows him in an all-black version of the shrunken doublet, full petticoat breeches, with ample cannons at the knees and a wide expanse of white shirt and shirt cuff ruffles visible. The National Gallery comments:\n\n“Such ostentatious dressing was not universally approved of in the Netherlands at the time. Stricter Calvinists (who followed Calvinism, a branch of Protestantism) would certainly have raised their eyebrows at what one contemporary writer referred to as ‘immoderately loose and long garments… redolent of over-abundance and profligacy’.”\n\nThe young man also models a popular Dutch hat style of the 1660s, the tall sugarloaf or steeple crown hat that featured a truncated conical shape (Hill 405).\n\nA surviving silk doublet in the Victoria and Albert Museum’s collection (Fig. 8) shows very similar truncated proportions and ample volume of visible shirt. The very full matching petticoat breeches are too fragile to display but have been faithfully reproduced, giving a good idea of the total look.\n\nAs for grooming and hair styles of the day, James, Duke of York (Fig. 9) provides a good example:\n\n“men’s hair is now longer and fuller than was fashionable earlier in the seventeenth century. It is coaxed here into soft waves and ringlets, arranged carefully to fall in symmetrical locks over the chest and back.” (Cumming 93)\n\nMen also favored thin mustaches, which were worn by both Charles II and Louis XIV (Fig. 10). See another example on painter William Bruce (Fig. 13). Natural-looking wigs were also beginning to be worn; initially styled like normal hair, wigs will become increasingly artificial as the century progresses. As Diana de Marly explains in Fashion for Men: An Illustrated History (1985):\n\n“The early periwigs were very curly around 1660, but those of the 1670s had ringlets. Their introduction was gradual. The naval administrator Samuel Pepys took the plunge in 1663, James Duke of York did so in February 1664 and Charles II not until April when he was going grey. Louis XIV, for once, took even longer, sporting his own abundant locks, of which he was very proud, into the next decade. Wigs proved an excellent illustration of rank, for they cost several pounds, so the peasantry could not copy them.” (55)\n\nWhile Louis XIV may have lagged in adopting a wig, he did popularize a new silhouette at court, by adopting the justaucorps, which was a type of loose overcoat that had already been worn in military costume; it “had short sleeves and was long and slightly flared at the bottom” (Boucher 258). As Boucher explains: “In 1662, according to Bussy-Rabutin, Louis XIV granted first a dozen, then about forty of his familiars permission to wear clothes similar to his own – a blue justaucorps lined with red ornaments, and a red veste or jacket – when staying at Saint-Germain or Versailles… first example of a codified form of Court costume.” (258)\n\nThe courtier at far left in the scene of Louis XIV and Philip IV meeting (Fig. 3) seems to be wearing a long blue justaucorps-style garment. The justaucorps supplanted the doublet, which slowly evolved toward a collarless, sleeveless vest. The justaucorps was very plain in cut as it hung loosely in this decade and was not yet tailored to the body. Duke Maximilian Philipp of Bavaria (Fig. 11) wears a short-sleeved, long, loose-cut justaucorps-style outer garment, which he pairs with a truly impressive amount of ribbon trim and pleated lace cannons. An early Dutch fashion print also features two men in long, loose justaucorps.\n\nCharles II introduced a version of the justaucorps to the English court, where he called it a vest. Like the justaucorps it was a long, collarless coat which hung so low that the petticoat breeches were no longer visible; their invisibility eventually resulted in a simplification of their style (Ashelford 92). Cravats, long strips of linen tied at the neck often with lace at the ends, became fashionable as these collarless coats were adopted. The name for the cravat “is said to be derived from Croat as such neckcloths were first seen on Louis XIV’s regiment of Croat mercenaries” (Waugh Men plate 7). The men in figures 12 and 13 all wear cravats. As the men in figures 4, 7, 9, and 11 especially demonstrate, the long hairstyles favored in the period mostly obscured the fine lace collars that men wore previously over their shoulders. The cravat concentrated the collar/lace at the center front where it wasn’t obscured by the hair or increasingly the periwig. Boucher explains more about the cravat’s adoption:\n\n“it was already worn by soldiers, simply knotted and hanging loosely. Civilian costume gave it greater variety and imagination, with panels of rich lace and a fairly full butterfly bow of ribbon under the chin. Cravats were made ready-tied, mounted on a ribbon which was fastened at the back of the neck.” (265)\n\nThe portrait of William Bruce (Fig. 13) shows one other fashionable style of informal dress in this period, namely the dressing gown. While Bruce’s gown may be silk, in the 1660s Indian cottons also become fashionable for dressing gowns:\n\n“In the 1660s the East India Company had introduced the English to chintz, a painted or printed cotton cloth made in India which was used as a furnishing fabric and for the loose informal gowns worn at home. Its brilliant colours, the fastness of the dyes used and the adaptation of native designs to suit English taste ensure the popularity of the materials.” (Ashelford 110)\n\nA rival calico (white or unbleached cotton) printing industry soon developed in England and “by 1700 calico printing was flourishing” (110)."
