        "text": "Examining Melungen History and Genealogy\n\nOld Thomas Collins of Flatt River\n\nHistory of Logan County, West Virginia\n\nEarly History of Old Orange County\n\nThe Graysville Melungeons\n\nThe Melungeon Tree and It’s Four Branches\n\nJarvis Interview – 1903\n\nEXAMINING MELUNGEON HISTORY AND GENEALOGY\n\nBy: JACK GOINS\n\nHaving the advantage of living in and near the homeland of the Melungeons has helped me considerably in my search for the true history of the Melungeons and their kinfolks. I first became interested in the Melungeons when told that some authors and historians listed two of my Great Grandparents as Melungeon. My Grandfather Goins denied these allegations and personally told me “My grandma Minor was about 3/4 Indian and Grandpa Goins was about ˝”. This heritage has not been established as a fact, but Grandpa believed it. His Grandma Susan Minor’s mother was Aggy Sizemore and most of these families filed Cherokee Indian Application beginning in 1905.\n\nIn my research journey I backtracked the Melungeons from the Clinch River to the New River, to the Flat River and the Pamunkey. After locating the places where they lived before arriving on the Clinch, my wife and I traveled to those places. This factual research of the historical Melungeons helped me to personally dismiss many fables about the Melungeons. One major discovery was that they migrated with the other pioneer settlers and they owned land in all these places. They lived next door to white settlers and had adjoining farms. They went to the same churches and schools, intermarried with all their neighbors, fought in the same wars, including Lord Dunmore’s War; 1774 Militia of Fincastle County, Virginia. These men were to fight in the battle of Point Pleasant against the Shawnee Indians. John Collins served 35 days; Micager Bunch served 29 days (1774. Soldiers of Fincastle County, Virginia by Kegley).\n\nAlso, I have found no record where they were driven from their land, or driven to the mountains, etc., etc. This rumor may have started from the outdoor drama “Walk Toward the Sunset.” I also discovered that most of the story Calloway Collins told the reporter Will Allen Dromgoole in the 1890 interview on Newman Ridge was true. “The Collins and Gibsons were living as Indians in Virginia before they migrated to North Carolina.” The Indian tribe was not named and has not been factually proven, but the important part, moving from Virginia to North Carolina has been proven by deeds from all these areas, beginning on the Pamunkey River in Louisa County, Virginia.\n\nOrange County, Virginia Order Book 3 record 1741-43 “Alexander Machartoon, John Bowling, Manincassa, Capt Tom, Isaac, Harry, blind tom, Foolish Jack, Charles Griffin, John Collins, Little Jack, Indians being bought before the court for stealing Hogs. , Ordered that their Guns be taken away from them till they are ready to depart of this county, they having declared their intentions to depart this colony within a week.”. On pages 309-312 of Court Record book the above named men individually put up security.4\n\nThis party of Saponia ( Monasukapanough) Indians left that county and some of these may have been the same group that formed the settlement near Hillsborough, North Carolina in 1750. It appears from Granville and Orange County tax records that a John Collins arrived in the area about this time. John Collins lived on the Flat River for about 17 years then moved to the New River circa 1767. Land and court records reveal they settled land on Peach Bottom Creek. This area became Grayson County, Virginia in 1793. Tax records from Grayson County, Virginia reveals that Lewis and James Collins were likely sons of John Collins.“James Collins, John Bolin, and Mike Bolin Indians from Blackwater, Newman Ridge, were named by Sneedville attorney Lewis M. Jarvis in 1903, as quite full blooded who fought in the War of 1812-1814″. 5 Another Indian family Moses and Mary , Ridley, Riddle are on these same Granville and Orange County, North Carolina tax lists, identified as mulattoes on the 1755 tax list in Orange County, North Carolina. Moses was closely associated with Charles Gibson, Thomas Gibson Sr & Jr, Thomas Collins and Joseph Collins. Several Collins, Bolling and others with related Melungeon names still live in this area today which is Person County, North Carolina.\n\nTheir migration journey began in the 1740’s and ended on Newman Ridge about 1790. I can only document a very small number of them who lived to make this complete journey. They were Thomas and Mary Gibson , their sons Charles and Thomas Gibson. Charles was the oldest living Melungeon on Newman Ridge when he filed his Revolutionary War Pension Application in 1839 stating that he was born in Louisa County, Virginia. He enlisted near Salisbury, North Carolina. Benjamin Collins, Jonathan Gibson and Jordan Gibson testified that Charles Gibson was reputed to be a Revolutionary War Soldier in their neighborhood. Charles Gibson was the son of Thomas Sr. and Mary Gibson. They sold their land on the Pamunkey River in 1749 to Thomas Mooreman. This land was located on the south side of the Pamunkey River adjoining Gilbert Gibson’s land. Gilbert was the father of Gedion, Jordan, and George Gibson. [Louisa County, Va., deeds and wills]\n\nAs previously noted my research journey includes actually locating and going to these above-mentioned areas. Several photos of these Rivers and Landmarks are in my book “Melungeons And Other Pioneer Families.” One of my most memorable discoveries was the Flat River Primitive Baptist Church established in 1750. The present church that stands in the same location was built circa 1930’s. The earliest minutes found to date begin in 1770. Unfortunately most of the Melungeons left that area for the New River beginning in 1767.\n\nLiving in the neighborhood also created a mystery for me concerning the Melungeons and has left me with two troubling questions, which I have not been able to solve, but one of the most important things I have learned from this research was the words, “perhaps and maybe.”\n\nMystery problem #1- Did the 1700 Melungeon forefathers refer to themselves as Melungeons? If the answer to this question is yes, no records have been found that actually call them by the name Melungeon. Also, to my knowledge no Melungeon tribe has been documented prior to the record in Tennessee.\n\nMystery problem #2- Was this name Melungeon coined by the local people? If the answer to this question is yes the name would only apply to those people. This is the message I got from living in the land of the Melungeons because during the early years of my life time no person in that neighborhood was actually identified as a Melungeon until after the Article “Sons of the Legend” was printed in the Oct 14, 1947 Saturday Evening Post. Those people in this time period told their children; “If you don’t be quiet the Melungeons will get you.” They would tell you the Melungeons lived somewhere else, or over on the next ridge, etc.\n\nIn conversations with several old-timers including two who’s pictures are in the Melungeon story Sons of the Legend they did not realize until the story was published in the Saturday Evening Post that they were the Melungeons the author was writing about.\n\nWilliam L. Warden, author of this Saturday Evening Post story, asked Asa Gibson who was then 75 years old if his ancestors were Welsh Warriors, Phoenicians or survivors of Roanoke his answer, “an Indian.”\n\nOne person in the Post story told me the whole Melungeon thing was a myth and laughed about it. She assured me there was no such thing as a Melungeon, but like Grandpa Goins, they also claimed to be of Indian descent. In conversations and letter from Melungeon descendants, including the Collins, Gibson and Bolin families they also claimed Indian descent.\n\nSeveral authors have suggested that the Melungeons were lying about their Indian nationality just to hide their known African ancestors. I am convinced that old Asa Gibson told the author William Warden, (Saturday Evening Post 1947) story what he believed was the truth, that his ancestors were Indian. This does not exclude Asa from the possibility of having both white, and or black genes. Example; In colonial days if an indentured servant, regardless of their nationality married a Saponia Indian and was accepted in their said Indian tribe, their children would be recognized as Indians. In a few generations their original nationality would be lost to history if they remained in the tribe. If these children married whites, mulattoes, or other free blacks they would eventually lose their Indian identity and would not have a clue as to their original nationality.\n\nLet us examine the historical Melungeons. The first known records that specifically identifies a group of people historically known as the (Melungins) and living in Tennessee. These records also pinpoint their location. Let us examine some of these written records.\n\nSome of the Tennessee State Senators first denied that there was such a race living in Tennessee according to the reporter Will Allen Dromgoole who keep asking and was told by another senator (not named), that the (Malungeons) live in his district. “Only upon the records of the State of Tennessee does the name appear.”\n\nThis author discovered the word Melungin written in the 1813 Minutes of Stony Creek Church, which was from an accusation that a lady in the church was housing them “Melungins”, There is not enough written about this incident to actually determine anything factual. Some of the first Melungeon families migrated circa 1790’s from the New River area of Wilkes County, North Carolina to Fort Blackmore and joined the Stony Creek Church 1801-1802. The majority of these were from the old Thomas and Mary Gibson family who originally migrated from Louisa County, Virginia beginning in 1749. Most of these families were gone by 1810.\n\nThis term “Malungeons” sprang up again in “The Wig” a Jonesboro, Tennessee newspaper. This may have been during a political campaign October 7, 1840. (3) And again in the celebrated 1872 Chattanooga Melungeon trial of a Bolton girl represented by Attorney Lewis Shepard, of Chattanooga, Tennessee “She is related to a group of people living in the mountains of East Tennessee known as (Malungeons)” 1. This statement was made by attorney Lewis Shepard, describing his Melungeon client whose mother was a Bolton. Shepard presented the following argument; “The term “Melungeon” is an East Tennessee provincialism; it was coined by the people of that county to apply to these people and is derived from the word, melange, meaning mixture and has gotten into most modern dictionaries”. The argument presented in this trial was that this family was not Negro, but pure-blooded Carthaginians (2). In his personal memoirs Judge Lewis Shepard wrote, “this mysterious racial group descended from the Phoenicians of Ancient Carthage”. [2- Memoirs of Judge Lewis Shepard, Chattanooga, 1915 p, 88.] also [2-3-4-5-6 Melungeons: And Other Pioneer Families]\n\nSeveral racial clans that existed in the Eastern United States in the 1940-50’s have been recognized. Some of these were the Redbones, Croatans, Brass Ankles, Ramps and Melungeons. According to my research of known Melungeon families, the Ramps of Fort Blackmore were related to the families that became known as Melungeons. Oddly the term Melungeon may have also began in Fort Blackmore and later the term Ramps were placed on their kinfolks who remained in Fort Blackmore. Ramptown, known by the locals is located between Fort Blackmore and Dungannon, in Scott County, Virginia.\n\nAbout The Author:\n\nJack Goins Lives in Rogersville, Tennessee, Retired from AFG Industries, began family research at an early age.\n\n(1)Articles includes; Zephaniah Goins Fought In Yorktown Campaign [Gowen Research Foundation Newsletter, Volume 5 number 3, 1993.]\n\n(2)Melungeon Families-Sizemore, Minor, Goins, Fisher and Riddle Article in [1994 Families Of Hawkins County, Tennessee page 537 to 540]\n\n(3 and 4)Arrington Family page 88 and co-authored Henry Fisher family page 126.[Hancock County, Tennessee And It’s People Volume II 1994]\n\n(5)Sizemore Family, Jan 1999 Distant Crossroads Volume XVI, Number 1\n\n(6)May 2000, Published a book “Melungeon And Other Pioneer Families” price $17.95\n\n(7) Descendants of William F. And Margaret McCullough 1776-1781 (Distant Crossroads Volume 18, Number 3, 2001.)\n\nOLD THOMAS COLLINS OF FLATT RIVER\n\nThomas Collins Sr. born 1710 & his descendants According to documented family research old Thomas Collins Sr. born before 1710 was the father and or grandfather of the historical Tennessee Melungeon Collins. At least one of Thomas Collins parents (unknown) was probably full blood Saponi Indian.\n\nCollins family history handed down from father to son was; “The Collins were living in Virginia as Indians before they migrated to North Carolina, and they stole the name Collins from white settlers” ( Will Allen Dromgoole’s 1890 interview with Calloway Collins, (Melungeons And Other Pioneer Families.)\n\nOther Collins men who were associated with Thomas Collins Sr. in New Kent, later Louisa County, Va. were probably his brothers. They were Samuel Collins, John Collins and William Collins.\n\n25 Jan 1745 Louisa County, Virginia Court: William Hall, Samuel Collins, William Collins, Samuel Bunch, George Gibson, Benjamin Brannum, Thomas Gibson, & William Donothan appear to answer an indictment for concealing tithables. Plead not guilty, Case continued. (Louisa County, Va., Tithables and Census)\n\nAlthough this John Collins may, or may not be a brother to Thomas the court record below establishes that some Collins were Saponia Indians. “Alexander Machartoon, John Bowling, Manincassa, Capt Tom, Isaac, Harry, blind tom, Foolish Jack, Charles Griffin, John Collins, Little Jack, Indians being bought before the court for stealing Hogs. , Ordered that their Guns be taken away from them till they are ready to depart of this county, they having declared their intentions to depart this colony within a week.”.11 On pages 309-312 of Orange County Court Record book the above named men individually put up security.11\n\nThis party of Saponia ( Monasukapanough) Indians left that county and some of these may have been the same group that formed the settlement near Hillsborough, North Carolina in 1750. Which was the same neck of the woods where old Thomas Collins migrated, as we follow him through land transactions.(Ref in Melungeons And other pioneer Families).\n\nOld Thomas Collins land joined other families who were later to become known as the Melungeons of Newman Ridge, located in present day Hancock County, Tennessee.\n\n1743 Saint Fredrick’s Parish Register (Published) Procession Gilbert Gibson, Thomas Gibson and 200 acres for Thomas Collings. (Louisa County, Virginia)\n\nThe following source Melungeon families lived in the same area of Virginia around 1730. John Bunch, Gilbert Gibson, Thomas Gibson and Thomas Collins. They begin selling their land in Louisa County. VA in 1747 and migrated to the Flatt River area of then Granville County, North Carolina this area became Orange County in 1753. 1747 Thomas Collins sells 184 acres of land on the south side of the Pamunkey River on Turkey Run Creek to John Dowell for 25 Ibs.

John Brown-Warrants 26 Dec 1760, 700 acres on the Flatt River, includes Bolins, Riddles and Collins Improvements. Surveyed 13 April 1761, deed 14 Oct 1761.\n\nWherever these people who’s children became known as Melungeons migrated, they always left a few behind. Although those left behind were never labeled Melungeon they were “kin to the people who later became known as the Melungeons of Newman Ridge”. A few stayed on the Flatt River, some migrated to the territory that became South Carolina, some to Pittsylvania County, Virginia. A Collins family along with Moses Riddle and some of the Bolen’s moved to Pittyslvania County, Virginia before 1767 and had land entries on the Sandy River. The 1767 Tax list of John Wilson, Pittsylvania County, Va. records: Moses Ridle (an Indian), William Ridle, Peter Perkins List records; Christopher Bowlin, and son William, Christopher Bowlin Jr. James Bowlin, Joseph Bowlin.\n\nCaswell County was formed from the northern part of Orange County, North Carolina in 1777 it included part of the Flatt River and part of that river remained in Orange County. 1777 tax list. Paul Collins 1 tithe, Martin Collins 1 tithe, Middleston Collins 1 tithe, Obadiah Collins 1 tithe, John collins 1 tithe.\n\nThomas Collins Sr. may have died in Orange County around 1770 but, most of his children migrated to the New River area of Virginia and North Carolina. The Collins and Gibsons began selling their land on the Flatt River in 1767-70 and moved to the back woods sections of the New River where some were listed on tax records in Fincastle County, Va., as “living on Indian Lands”\n\nThe deed records of Thomas Gibson land sale in Orange County, establishes him as the same Thomas who sold his land on the Pamunkey River in Louisa County in 1749 when he made his mark “T”.\n\n1770-Thomas Gibson to James Williams. Land on the Flatt River. Signed Thomas Gibson (his “T”mark), (Orange Co., N.C.. Deed Book 3, page 468.)\n\nThomas Gibson made a land entry on 9 June 1780 on Cranberry Path in Wilkes Co., N.C. This land was near the South Fork of New River in present day Ashe Co., N.C., entry # 1858.(Wilkes County, North Carolina, Land Entry Book 1778-1781) Thomas Gibson’s family migrated to Fort Blackmore before 1800. And Joined the Stony Creek Baptist Church beginning in 1801. Most of this family moved to Newman Ridge in Hawkins County, Tn.,beginning in 1804 and most were gone by 1808. The Church Minutes records them coming back for meetings and some were brought before the church for drinking and fighting, such as Charles Gibson. The first written record of the word Melungin is recorded in the 1813 Minutes of Stoney Creek Church.\n\n“Then came forward sister Kitchens and complained to the church against Susanna Stallard for saying she harbored them Melungins”\n\nAccording to the Stony Creek Church Minutes most of the Melungeons had left by 1813 and joined Blackwater and Mulberry Churches in Hawkins County, Tn. The minutes also records a few Gibson’s coming back and causing a disturbance by drinking and fighting. The Stony Creek Church again removed Gibson and wrote that the Mulberry church had also dismissed him, and they had been notified. It is most likely that one of these ladies was accusing the other of an affair with a Melungin and the church clerks choose these words to record this motion. Melungeons staying with other church members would not have been considered a sin; it would be the appearance of a given situation. She may have been letting some Melungeons from the Blackwater or Mulberry Church room at her home on Friday before the meeting, or on Saturday night. Church meetings were during the day and usually once a month on the 1st Saturday. The Melungeons were recorded white on tax records of lower Russell County and later Scott County, Virginia, when they were living in the Stony Creek area.(Melungeon and Other pioneer families)\n\n1802 Tax List for the Lower District of Russell County, VA that became Scott County in 1815 and number of males 16 or over Collins, Valentine 1- Charles Gibson, 1- David Gibson 1- James Gibson 2- James Gibson 0 – Martin Gibson 1- Molly Gibson 2- Ruben Gibson 1- Samuel Gibson 1-Sharud Gibson 1- Thomas Gibson 1-William Gibson 1-Willis Gibson 1-Benjamin Bolin 1- William Bolin 1. Jesse Bolin became pastor of Stony Creek in 1802.\n\nCharles Gibson son of Thomas and Mary filed a Revolutionary War Pension Application (R3995 Applied in Hawkins County, Tennessee 19 Jan 1839. He gave his age as 92 but, was 100 years old if 16 when he was listed as a tithe of Thomas on a Granville County, NC tax list. He gave his place of birth as Louisa County, Virginia, entered the service near Salisbury, North Carolina. Benjamin Collins, Jonothan Gibson, and Jordan Gibson swear that he is reputed to be a Revolutionary Soldier in their neighborhood..\n\nThe Thomas Collins children settled in what is today Grayson County, Va., and Ashe County, NC. George Collins testified in a land dispute in Grayson County, Virginia in 1808 that he settled on the land in 1767.\n\nTheir arrival on the New River is documented by a Botetourt County, Virginia tax list. (Kegleys Early adventures on Western Waters) Number of males over 16. Charles Collins 1, John Collins 4, Samuel Collins 2, Charles Sexton 1, Mckegar Bunch 1, William Sexton 1.\n\nFincastle County was formed from Botetourt in 1772, 1773 tax list includes: David Collins (Indian Lands), Ambrose Collins, John Collins, John Collins Jr., Charles Collins (Indian Land), Elisha Collins, Samuel Collins (Indian Land), Lewis Collins, George Collins (Indian Land), Micajer Bunch (Indian Land)\n\nA 1778 tax list of the area of Wilkes County that became Ashe in 1778; Ambrose Collins, Charles Collins, Samuel Collins, David Gibson, Micajer Bunch, David Collins, George Collins, Julius Bunch. You may note some of these same people were on the Ficastle list, The reason for this is they may have been next door neighbors because they were in the area that became Ashe North Carolina and Grayson County, Virginia in 1790.\n\nMontgomery County was formed from Fincastle in 1777.. 1782 tax list includes; Martin Collins 1, John Collins Sr. 1, John Collins Jr. 1, Lewis Collins 1, Milton Collins 1, Ambrose Collins 1, David Collins 1, David Gibson 1. The 1782 list of Wilkes County is the same as the 1778 list except for Thomas Gibson.\n\nLewis Collins above was the son of John Collins Sr. He Applied for a Rev. War Pension in Hawkins County, Tennessee while living in Granger County, Tn. on 16 Aug 1834 # (S2142). “First entered the service in 1778 while living on the Broad River in South Carolina. Moved back to the new River in Montgomery County, Virginia where his Father lived and enlisted there in 1780. Lewis did not tell the whole story, he was actually a Tory in 1780 and probably in William Riddle’s gang. According to the affidavit below he escaped, but his name is included with the group of Tories who raided Capt. John Cox home on the new River, some of these took the Oath of Allegiance to escape punishment. This affidavit by Joseph Collins was included in Selethiah Martin wife’s application “Was a small boy in 1780 when Captain Martin came to the New River in Virginia and captured a group of Tories camped at a Rock House on the river, two of those captured escaped the next night: David Gibson and Lewis Collins, I am intimately acquainted with both men and have heard them tell how they made their escape. John Speltz in his Revolutionary Pension Application told this almost identical event. He said there were nine captured and two Nichols and Riddle were hung on our return. William Riddle and his brother in-law William Nichols were both hung but not together, so this man Speltz was telling about an event that happened after these nine were captured, thus the hanging of Nichols and Riddle.\n\nThe majority of the Melungeon source families began to migrate to Hawkins County, Tennessee in the 1790’s, Vardy Collins was still in Ashe County, North Carolina as the 1800 census reveals. Thus the colony on Newman Ridge was established around 1800, the first recorded Melungeon settlers in the area were on the Lee County, Virginia Tax list 1795,97 but some had land entries in Hawkins County, they were Micajer Bunch, Isreal Bunch, Solomon Bunch, Claiborn Bunch, Jessee Bowlin and Zachariah Goins. The first Collins on the tax record 1798 was Daniel Collins with 4 titables.By 1801 a host of Collins, plus James Mullins. In this time frame, most settlers on the North Side of the Clinch River were listed in Lee County, Va., This was before the dividing line between Virginia and Tennessee was fully established. . Vardeman “Vardy” Collins one of the more famous Melungeons, according to tax records was perhaps the son of Samuel, who was the son of Thomas Collins Sr. According to a n outstanding research in the Vardeman family, Vardy Collins mother was the daughter of John Vardeman, Vardiman.. John Vardeman and Samuel Collins are both recorded on the 1771 Bontetourt County, VA tax list (William Herberts list)\n\nWho were the Melungeons? Their fore parents were part of the original pioneer settlers. Living on Indian lands, this is as pioneer as it gets. Some where in the battle at Point Pleasant including Thomas Collin’s son John Collins who served 35 days. Their rifles were heard at Kings Mountain and in Yorktown, at the surrender of Cornwallis. Some made the 52 + year journey from the Pamunkey River in Virginia to Newman Ridge, such as Charles Gibson. Charles lived to be at least 110 years old. He was probably present when they first heard the word, “Melungin”.\n\nSneedville attorney Lewis M. Jarvis (born 1829) knew many of the first Melungeons including Vardy Collins. In an interview with Hancock County Times in 1902. Jarvis named James Collins, John Bolin and Mike Bolin as quite full-blooded Indians. Jarvis said the Melungeons were originally the friendly Indians who came with the whites as they moved west. They came from the Cumberland County and New River in VA, stopping at various points west of the Blue Ridge. Some of them stopped on Stony Creek, Scott Co, Virginia (Ref in Melungeons and Other Pioneer Families. from 1994 Hancock Co.,Tn..And It’s People Volume 2) What makes Lewis Jarvis testimony of more value than most, is because his migration pattern for the Melungeons can be and has been proven correct in Church, Land, Tax and Military Records.

The territory of Logan, as it exists today, was part of Fincastle from 1738 to 1776, then a part of Montgomery until 1790, a part of Wythe until 1792, a part of Kanawha until 1809, when it became a part of Cabell and remained as such until it was organized into a county in 1823.\n\nUpon the passage of the law in 1792, referred to in our last chapter, the owners of grants made before that time, saw the necessity of seeding and cultivating the lands which had been patented to them before the expiration of the period to which that right had been extended (1799), and at once went to work to get some one to take charge of their lands. In the company of John Breckenridge, at the time of the battle of the Islands, was one James Workman, who in addition to being a gallant soldier, was in every respect a trustworthy gentleman. Breckenridge, as soon as possible, employed him to take charge of his survey at the Islands (Logan C.H.) and in 1794, James Workman with his brothers Joseph and Nimrod, built a cabin on the Island and planted a few acres of corn. They planted the same land again in 1795 and 1796, and in the fall of the latter year. James Workman, who was a man of family, moved his wife and children from their old home in Wythe (now Tazewell), and settled on the Island, where the three brothers continued to live until the year 1800, when they moved upon the farm now occupied by Henry Mitchell. More will be said of this family in a future chapter.\n\nThe first permanent settlement of which we have any record was commenced by William Dingess, a son of Peter Dingess, a Montgomery county [?], in the year 1799. Peter Dingess was a German, but just when or under what circumstances he came to America, is shrouded in doubt, which will never be dispelled. One account given us by one of his prominent descendants, is, that he came to this country before the War of the Revolution and settled in Montgomery County, and in evidence of this, furniture etc., brought with him from the “Fader Land,” is pointed out; especially a finely finished bureau, which was, for a long time, an heirloom in the family, and a peculiar shaped gourd which was grown in Germany, and used by his son John Dingess as a powder gourd, within the memory of the present generation. Another account given us by William A. Dingess, one of his grandsons, is, that some time between the years 1750 and 1760, that his parents with their family embarked for America, that fell disease carried off his parents on the voyage, that he and a sister landed at Baltimore, neither of whom could speak a word of English, that from some cause they became separated, and that he never saw her or heard of her again. That wandering about the streets, homeless and alone, a merchant from Montgomery County, Virginia, took charge of him and brought him to Montgomery, where he grew up and married a wife, and afterwards served in the War of the Revolution. It is impossible to say which story is correct, but of one thing we are assured, and that is, that he lived in Montgomery County, Virginia, and raised a family of eleven children, four boys and seven girls and died there in 1800. The names of his sons were William, Peter, John and Charles A., and his daughters, Harriet, Betsy, Susan, Nancy, Sallie, Peggy and Polly, who intermarried with Sam Peck, John McClaugherty, William Henderson, David French, (who was, for a long while Clerk of the Courts of Giles County), Ezekiel Smith, William Smith and James Bright, who emigrated to Tennessee, and was the father of John Morgan Bright, who for twelve years represented Tennessee in Congress. Charles A., died unmarried in Mercer County, Col. Napoleon B. French, a son of David French, is still living in Mercer County, aged 96 years.\n\nWilliam Dingess, the oldest of the family, was born in Montgomery County in 1776, and married Nancy McNeeley, and purchasing of John Breckenridge the survey of 300 acres which covers the present site of Logan Courthouse, and a portion of the farm across the river where Mrs. J. W. Desking now lives, moved upon it in 1799, and built a residence where J. S. Miller now lives; the old chimney of which is still standing. John Dempsey came with him and build a cabin on the little island, but afterwards moved to Island Creek, near where Sam Jackson now lives. William Dingess was said to be almost a giant in strength, but so peaceable that no one could induce him to fight. While he was born at too late a date to engage in the Indian warfare on the border, he, on one occasion, joined in the pursuit of a band of Indian marauders and followed them as far as the Falls of Guyan, where, killing an Indian, he took off a part of his hide, out of which he made a razor strap, and kept it during his lifetime. He had no children by his wife, but was the reputed father of a child born to Katie McComas, who was always known as Peter Dingess, and was for a long time regarded as the best physician in Logan County. Katie McComas was also the mother of the late John Garrett, of Big Creek, one of the most highly esteemed citizens of Logan County.\n\nIn the year 1800, Peter Dingess and John Dingess, brothers of William Dingess, joined him and became permanent settlers, of whom more will be said hereafter.\n\nSome time in the next year or two Captain Henry Farley, of Montgomery County, who had served with distinction in the War of the Revolution, and who has been heretofore mentioned as the leader of the whites in the pursuit of the Indians in 1792; with Garland Conley, who had married his eldest daughter, Bettie, settled at the mouth of Peach Creek. He brought with him three stalwart sons and five marriageable daughters, and as might have been expected, the big house at the mouth of Peach Creek, and it was said to have been the largest house in the country, was always full.\n\nOf what tales that never grow old were told, we have no record, and the man in the moon has never divulged the vows which he witnessed, yet we know that enough was said to divide the happiness of Captain Farley’s home among five families.\n\nThe blushing Sallie became the wife of Peter Dingess during the year 1806, and they set up housekeeping just across the river where Mrs. John W. Deskins now lives, and to the happy couple there was born, on the 30th day of October 1806, William Anderson Dingess, who, during a long and useful life (dying December 13th, 1893, in his eighty-eighth year) bore the proud distinction of being the first white child born in Logan County. The other children born to this marriage were John, who intermarried with Sallie Moore; Guy, who married Rhoda Toney; Charles F., who married Betty Toney, both of these were the daughters of William and Polly (Caperton) Toney; Polly, who married Lewis Lawson; Matilda, who married James Lawson, both sons of Anthony Lawson; Julyantes, who married Charles Smoot; Minerva, who married W. W. McDonald; and Hattlett [Harriett?], who married John Justice.\n\nPeter Dingess was a prominent citizen and was for a long while one of the justices of Cabell County.\n\nAnother one of the blooming daughters of Capt. Farley, (Chloe), intermarried with John Dingess, who then settled near his father-in-law, at the mouth of Peach Creek. His children were William, who married a daughter of Josiah Stollings; Julius, who married a daughter of Ben Smith; Harvey, who married a daughter of Joseph Adams; Henderson, who married a daughter of Joseph Adams; John and Peter, both of whom married daughters of Washington Adams; Sallie, who married James Butcher; Peggy, who married John Gore; and Nancy, who married William Chapman, all of whom are dead except Sallie and Henderson. All of them except David had a large off-spring.\n\nThe daughters of Captain Henry Farley were Judith, who married Thomas Thompson, and, who, after the death of Thompson, married Robert Hensley; Matilda, who married Carter T. Clark; and Mary, who first married Stephen Hensley, and afterwards married Pryyhus McGinnis. Of his three sons, John and Thomas, both married Miss Pinsons of Kentucky, and William was married four times, first marrying Bettie Phillips, second Phoebe Muncy, third Polly Williams, and fourth, Jane Jones. All of them left large families, and with the Dingesses constituted one of the largest family connections in Logan County, and more will be said of them hereafter.\n\nAt about the same time that Captain Farley settled at the mouth of Peach Creek, Richard Kezee, another hero of the Revolution, built a cabin near the present residence of Major William Stratton and the branch which flowed past the old homestead still bears the euphonious name of Kezee. His descendants all moved to the State of Kentucky, and many of them are now living in Pike County, of that state.\n\nAbout the same time David McNeeley settled where Floyd Buchanan now lives, and afterwards moved upon the farm now owned by J. E. Robertson. For some reason he was nick-named “Jagger,” and the place, to which he removed on Robertson’s farm was called “Jaggerstown.” His descendants are quite numerous, and the name is familiar not only in Logan, but in all the surrounding counties, and many of them at an early day went with the “Course of Empire” westward. Among his descentants is Rev. John Green McNeeley, the present pastor of the Desciples Church of Aracoma.\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nJohn Dempsey, who is referred to as having come here with William Dingess, in 1799, was the father of seven sons and three daughters. His sons were William, who married Nancy, a daughter of John Vannatter, who, with his sons and daughters, came from the south branch of the Potomac about 1811; Jack, who married Minerva Vance; Thomas, who married Dicey Lucas; Joseph, who married Sena Vance; Andrew, who married Martha Starr; Mark, who married Lucinda Ward; and Lewis, who married Nancy Stepp. His daughters were Poll, who married John McNeely; Jane, who married Jerry Vernatter [sic], and Rachel, who married James Vannatter.\n\nRichard Elkins, of Montgomery, also came with William Dingess and settled near the big island on Island Creek. The island was covered with a heavy growth of cane, and Elkins leased it from Dingess and cleared it out, and the first year that he cultivated it in corn he raised three thousand bushels, or about one hundred bushels to the acre. (a few acres of the Island had been cleared before that time by the Workman brothers heretofore mentioned, and cultivated in corn.) He was also the father of a large family his wife being a Miss Maguire, of Montgomery. His sons were Archibald, who married a Miss Gillaspie, of Tazewell, James, who married his cousin – a daughter of Zach Elkins, of Hewett; Robert, who married the widow of Edward McDonald and who was formerly a Miss Harvey; Israel, who married a daughter of William Browning; Richard, Jr., who married a Miss May, and Eddie and Harvey, whose wives are unknown. His daughters were Lucretia, who married James White; Martha, who married Elijah Elkins (son of Wm. Elkins, of Newett); Nancy, who married William Walls; Susannah, who married John White, (son of Jack), and Hannah, who married William Moore, of Tazewell. This last mentioned couple joined the Mormons and were with Joe Smith at Nauvoo. Zach and William Elkins, brothers of Richard Elkins, settled on Hewett and, like Richard, had numerous descendants, but we are unable to give their names. From these three brothers, however, are descended the Elkins family of Logan and adjoining counties.\n\nDavid McNeely, who has been heretofore mentioned as sthe progenitor of the large McNeely family, was the father of four sons – John, who went to Illinois; Sam, Joe and William – and one daughter, who married Ben Cary, who is the progenitor of our Cary family in Logan and Mingo. No doubt there were other sons and daughters of David McNeely, but we have been unable to ascertain their names. The family is a large one and is scattered over several counties.\n\nIsaac Cole, a native of England, who came to Montgomery County, just before the War of the Revolution, who was a gallant soldier for our independence and who was with the Clay brothers in following the Indians down Cole river as heretofore mentioned, settled near where Major Straton now lives, about the year 1800, where he lived for about one year, and buried one of his daughters; and then moved to Island Creek, and settled near the mouth of what is now known as Cole Branch. His wife was Kate Thompson, of Montgomery County, (Now Giles County) Virginia. After remaining on Island Creek for a year his family became tired of frontier life, and he returned to his old home near Pearlsburg where he died at an advanced age. Isaac Cole was a noted scout and a man of great force of character and will power. Hon. L. D. Chambers, of Rum Creek, is his grandson.\n\nThomas Childress, another Revolutionary soldier of Goochland County, and who married a Miss Parrish of the same county, settled about the same time near the forks of Island Creek, but after remaining a few years, went further down the river, and settled near the present site of Susenberry’s mill. The Childresses of Cabell County are his descendants.\n\nRobert Lilly, of Fluvanna County, came to Montgomery while a boy, and married Miss Bridget Conley, a sister of Garland Conley, heretofore mentioned as a son-in-law of Henry Farley. In 1800 he purchased of William Ward ne [one?] of his surveys in the lower end of this county, and settled on it at or near the place where Andy Fowler now lives, near Chapmanville, in 1801. It is said that an Indian chief accompanied him from his old home in Montgomery to his new home in Logan and remained with him for some time. Lilly was the father of twelve children, six sons and six daughters. Of his sons, Thomas went wouth when a boy; Robert married married a daughter of Garland Conley; William was never married; John married a daughter of John Adkins of Kanawha and move to that county; James married a daughter of James Ferrell, and settled near the mouth of Big Creek; and Edward Bailey, who is still living, married Susan Butcher, a daughter of Joshua Butcher. Of his daughters, Elizabeth married William Thompson; Sarah married Garland B. Conley; Polly married Patton Thompson; Fannie married Simeon Payne of Cabell County; Dolly married Joseph Myer, and moved to Missouri; and Nancy died unmarried.\n\nGarland Conley, who has been mentioned as a son-in-law of Henry Farley, first settled on Island Creek near where Mrs. J. W. Deskins now lives. He was the father of five sons and three daughters. His sons were Col. Henry Conley, who was born in Montgomery County, Virginia, and who first married a Miss Thompson, and after her death a widow named Dingess, who was the daughter of Washington Adams; Thomas Conley, Jr., who married a daughter of Thomas Conley; Garland B., who married a daughter of Robert Lilly, and afterward a daughter of William Farley (Hopping Bill); John, who married a Miss Ward, of Kentucky; and James, who married a Miss Cumby. The Thomas Conley mentioned above as the father of the wife of Thomas Conley, Jr., was a cousin of Garland Conley, and was better known as Thomas Hackett. He had one son – Gordon, who went to Ohio – he was also the reputed father of Manum Brumfield. Of the daughters of Garland Conley, Juliet, the oldest, who was born in Island Creek on the 25th day of December, 1806, and said to be the first white girl born in the limits of Logan County, married Robert Chambers. She is still living and is the mother of Rev. B. S. Chambers, one of the most eloquent divines of the M. E. Church, South. Judy, the second daughter, married Rob Lilly, Jr., and after his death, married George Hensley; and Dolly, the third daughter, married Wesley Stollings. She is still living.\n\nJacob Stollings, who settled on the farm now owned by W. F. Butcher, opposite the mouth of Crawley Creek, was the father of four sons and one daughter. His sons were Josiah, the father of Wesley, William, Nelson, Lorenzo, and Griffin, and two daughters, one whom married William Dingess, and the other James Hill; Griffin, who is the father of Col. J. E. Stollings, a prominent attorney of Boone county, and twice a member of the Senate of West Virginia; Isaac, who is the father of Granville Stollings, of Coal River; and Jacob, who went to the interior of the State. His daughter married William Hinchman, of Rich Creek.\n\nEdward Chapman, who settled at the present site of Chapmanville, married Mary Godby, a daughter of William Godby of Big Creek, and was the father of three sons – Burgess S., who married a daughter of Henry Farley, of Pigeon; William B., who married a daughter of John Dingess, of Peach Creek; and John R., who married a daughter of Washington Adams of Crawley. John Stone, who settled at the old Stone farm in 1809 was also represented in the county. He was from Pittsylvania County, where he married a Miss Jennie Shelton. Among his sons are Crispin I., who was born in Pittsylvania County in 1807. He married Miss Mildred Workman and died in January, 1892, in the 85th year of his age. He was one of the best and most useful men in Logan County, and during a long and honorable life, served the people well and faithfully in several official positions among which were Justice of the Peace, Surveyor, Clerk of the Circuit Court and County Superintendent of Free Schools. He left three sons, Edwion, Charles I., amd M. Dyke, and several daughters. Samuel S., another son of John Stone, married a Miss Hatfield, of Cabell; he also left a large family of sons and daughters. John Stone’s daughters were Dolly, who married Isaac Morgan, for a long time a member of a member of the County Court of Logan County, and for one term a member of the Virginia Legislature; Mary, who married Dr. Peter Dingess, who was also a member of the Virginia Legislature; and Chloe, who married Edwin Robertson, who was, up to the time of his death, Clerk of the Courts of Logan County. Of the children of Edwin Robertson, John Edwin and Chloe, who married Dr. George W. Lawson, and Sidney B. Robertson, are still living. We will have more to say of this family in another chapter.\n\nTranscribed by Tom Steele, June 30, 1998\n\nEarly History of Old Orange County\n\nThe source of this information is Orange County – 1752-1952 edited by Hugh Lefler and Paul Wager, published in 1953, copied with permission.\n\nBefore Orange County – The Indians\n\nWhen the curtain rose for the drama of history to begin, the land\n\nthat is now Orange county was occupied by small tribes of Siouan origin.\n\nThe great Trading Path from Virginia to the Catawba nation led through\n\nthe region of present Hillsboro and Mebane to Haw river. The first\n\ndescription of this famous Indian trail was given by John LEDERER, a\n\nGerman doctor, in June, 1670. He told of his visit to the Eno Indians\n\nalong the Eno river near present Hillsboro. His narrative read:\n\n*****Dr. Lederer’s comments****\n\nThe county here, by the industry of these Indians, is very open and clear\n\nof wood. Their town is built round a field where in their sports they\n\nexercise with so much labour and violence, and in so great numbers that\n\nI have seen the ground wet with sweat that dropped from their bodies:\n\ntheir chief recreation is slinging of stones. They are of mean stature and\n\ncourage, covetous and thievish, industrious to earn a penny; and therefore\n\nhire themselves out to their neighbours, who employ them as carryers or\n\nporters. They plant abundance of grain, reap three crops in a summer,\n\nand out of their granary supply all the adjacent parts. These and the\n\nmountain-Indians build not their houses of bark, but of watling and\n\nplaister. . . .Some houses they have of reed or bark; they build them\n\ngenerally round: to each house belongs a little hovel made like an oven,\n\nwhere they lay up their corn and mast, and keep it dry. They parch their\n\nnuts and acorns over a fire, to take away their rank oyliness; which\n\nafterwards pressed, yield a milky liquor, and the acorns an amber-colour’d\n\noyl. In these, mingled together, they dip their cakes at great\n\nentertainments, and so serve them up to their guests as an extraordinary\n\ndainty. Their government is democratick; and the sentences of their old\n\nmen are received as laws, or rather oracles, by them.\n\n****end of Dr. Lederer’s comments****\n\nThe author goes on to say that more than two centuries later the following\n\ncomment was written. He does not say who wrote this comment.\n\n**********************\n\nNot far from Eno Town the young braves of North Carolina and Duke\n\nuniversities still carry on their ball play with much labour and violence,\n\nthe government of the county is still democratic, and the three crops a\n\nyear are possible for farmers who space their corn plantings properly.\n\n**********************\n\nFourteen miles west-southwest from his visit to the Eno Village Lederer\n\nfound the Shackory Indians dwelling upon a rich soil. These seem to tally\n\nwith the Shakori (Shoccoree), or Saxapahaw, sometimes called Sissipihaw,\n\ndwelling Haw river in the neighborhood of Haw fields.\n\nAnother traveler, John LAWSON, came along the trading path from\n\nthe south in 1701. The trail was followed across “three Great Rivers”,\n\nidentified as Little and Big Alamance rivers and Haw river. The Haw\n\nriver ford, which was crossed “with great Difficulty, (by God’s Assistance),”\n\nwas in the neighborhood of the present village of Swepsonville, and bordered\n\nlands which Lawson described as “extraordinary Rich”.\n\nAs he traveled through Haw fields, he met a trading caravan of\n\nthirty horses led by several horsemen. The leader, a man named MASSEY,\n\nfrom Leeds in Yorkshire, England, advised Lawson to secure ENO-WILL, a\n\nfaithful Indian guide, who was to be found at one of the villages in the\n\nOcconeechee neighborhood. This Indian was a Shakori by birth, whose people\n\nhad been met by Lederer at Haw river and who had since joined the Eno and\n\nanother tribe known as Adshusheer.\n\nThe Occoneechee Indians had fled from their island home at the\n\nconfluence of Dan and Staunton rivers and were then n the region of the\n\nEno river, where they left their name in the “Occoneechee Hills”, not far\n\nfrom present Hillsboro.\n\nThe Occoneechee (Occaneechee) Indians provided Lawson with a feast of\n\n“good fat Bear, and Venison.” The Indians’ cabins, or lodges, were\n\nfestooned with dried bear and dear meat, “a good sort of Tapestry,” which\n\ncaused Lawson to declare that the Indians possessed “the Flower of Carolina;\n\nthe English enjoying only the Fag-end of that fine Country.”\n\nEno-Will agreed to guide Lawson to eastern Carolina. A halt was\n\nmade at Eno town, located on a “Pretty Rivulet”, fourteen miles east of\n\nthe Occoneechee, and northwest of the present city of Durham. Here Lawson\n\nwrote this character sketch of his Indian friend:\n\n****Lawson’s sketch****\n\nOur Guide and Landlord, Enoe-Will, was of the best and most agreeable Temper\n\nthat I ever met with in an Indian, being always ready to serve the English,\n\nnot out of Gain, but real Affection; which makes him apprehensive of being\n\npoisoned by some wicked Indians, and was therefore very earnest with me,\n\nto promise him to avenge his Death if it should so happen. He brought some\n\nof his chief Men into his Cabin, and two of them having a Drum and Rattle,\n\nsung by us as we lay in Bed, and struck up their Music to serenade and welcome\n\nus into their Town. And though at last, we fell asleep, yet they continued\n\ntheir Concert till Morning.\n\n****End of Lawson’s sketch****\n\nSoon after this visit of John Lawson, the Siouan tribes of the\n\nPiedmont departed for eastern Carolina. Apparently all of the Indians in\n\nthe region later included in Orange county had disappeared by the time that the\n\nwhite settlement of the area began.\n\nThe First Settlers\n\nThere were few white families in the 1740’s in the area that was to\n\nbecome Orange County. But, by 1751 Governor Gabriel JOHNSTON reported\n\nthat settlers were flocking in, mostly from PA. At the time it was\n\nformed Orange County had an estimated population of 4,000. By 1767 it\n\nhad the largest population of any county in NC.\n\nThe migration along the “Great Wagon Road” from PA through Shenandoah\n\nvalley to Carolina was made up largely of Scotch-Irish and German\n\nimmigrants. “Scotch-Irish” is the term used in the\n\nreference book. German refers to the area that was later to become\n\nGermany.\n\nThe most distinctly Scotch-Irish settlement in the county was Eno, about\n\n7 miles north of Hillsborough. They also settled in the area east of\n\nthe Haw river adn in the Little river and New Hope creek sections. The\n\nScotch-Irish, in what is now Guilford County, organized Buffalo\n\nPresbyterian Church in 1756. The Scotch were said to have been most prevelant\n\nin Cumberland County, but there were some that settled in southern Orange\n\nin the area that is now Chatham County.\n\nGermans held the land west of the Haw River. There were Lutherans\n\nand German Reformed. Ludwig CLAPP had a grant of 640 acres on the\n\nAlamance. Michael HOLT had large acreage along the Great and Little\n\nAlamance. John FAUST had land on Cain Creek. Adam TROLINGER had land\n\non the west bank of the Haw River, near the present railroad crossing.\n\nOther German pioneers were Christian FAUST, Jacob ALBRIGHT, Peter SHARP,\n\nPhilip SNOTHERLY and David EFLAND. Quoting from the book: “By 1773\n\nthere were so many Germans in western Orange that J.F.D. SMYTHE, an\n\nEnglish traveler, experienced difficulty in finding anyone who\n\nunderstood his language in some areas west of Hillsboro.”\n\nSome of the names of these early German settlers include:\n\nALBRECHT/ALBRIGHT, BASON, KLAPP/CLAPP, EPHLAND/EFLAND, FAUST/FOUST,\n\nGERHARD, GOERTNER/COURTNER/CURTNER, GRAFF/GRAVES, HOLT/HOLD,\n\nKIMBRO/KIMBROUGH, LEINBERGER/LINEBERRY, LONG, LOY, MAY, MOSER,\n\nNEASE/NEESE/NEESE, RICH/RIDGE, SCHADE/SHADDIE,\n\nSCHEAFER/SHAVER/SHEPHERD, SCHWENCK/SWING, SHARP/SHAEBE, TROLLINGER,\n\nSTEINER/STONER, WEITZEL/WHITESELL,\n\nEnglish immigrants from VA settled in northern Orange along the Hico\n\nRiver and County Line Creek. There was a settlement of Irish near Stoney\n\nCreek in what is now Alamance County. The Welsh, including Thomas LLOYD\n\nsettled between Hillsborough and what is now Chatham County.\n\nQuakers were very prominent in early Orange County. There were some\n\nnorth of Hillsborough. There were more in the Cain Creek and Stinking\n\nQuarter Creek areas that are now part of Alamance, Chatham and\n\nRandolph. Two prominent Quaker pioneers were Jonathan LINDLEY of the\n\nCain Creek section and William COURTNEY of Hillsborough..\n\nLand Ownership in Orange County\n\nFrom its beginning Orange County was the home of farmers. It has\n\nbeen said that in 18th century Orange county more than 75% of the land\n\nowners owned between 100 and 500 acres. This was at a time that large land\n\ngrants were common, but only 5% of the land owners had 1,000 acres or more.\n\nThe three largest landowners in 1800 were William CAIN who had 4,417\n\nacres, Richard BENNEHAN with 4,065 acres, and William STRUDWICK with 4,000.\n\nBy 1860 77% of the land owners had 100 acres or less with only about 1%\n\nhaving 1,000 acres or more.\n\nSlavery in Orange County\n\nSlavery was well established in the colony of North Carolina long\n\nbefore Orange County came into being. Slavery was not as important an\n\ninstitution in Orange County as other places. At no time did slaves\n\nconstitute more than 31 percent of the total population of the county.\n\nIn 1755 (3 years after its founding) only 8 percent of the families\n\nowned slaves. The largest slaveholder at that time, Mark MORGAN, had only 6\n\nslaves. By 1780, however, 3 percent of Orange Co slaveholders had more than\n\n20 slaves.\n\nThe 1790 census showed 10,055 whites, 2,060 Negro slaves, and 101\n\nother free persons. At that time there were 14 slaveholders who had 10\n\nslaves or more. 4 of these 14 lived in Hillsboro. William COOPER was the\n\nlargest slaveholder in Hillsboro with 22 and Richard BENNEHAN, a planter,\n\nwas the largest slaveholder in the county with 24. Others who had 10 or\n\nmore were George ALLEN, John TAYLOR, Matthew McCAULEY, John HOGAN, Thomas H\n\nPERKINS with 10 each; Walter ALVES with 11; William SHEPPARD and William\n\nO’NEAL with 12 each; Hardy MORGAN with 14; Alexander MEBANE with 16; and a\n\nperson whose name is not known with 20.\n\nIn 1860 less than half of all landowners in the county had slaves.\n\nOver 40 percent of those had only one slave. The following is a direct\n\nquote: “Most slaveholders owned a small number of slaves, hence the\n\nrelationship between master and slave was very close. The master knew his\n\nslaves by name, took a personal interest in them individually, and looked\n\nupon them almost as members of his family”\n\nIn 1860 the 3 largest slaveholders were I. N. PATTERSON with 106,\n\nPaul CAMERON with 98, and Henry WHITTED with 78.\n\nYou can send your comments to Larry Noah\n\nCopyright 1998 by Larry Noah. All rights reserved.

Field work in the community conducted in conjunction with archival research demonstrates that the Melungeons, who now compose more than half of the local population, came from Hamilton County durning the latter half of the nineteenth century. Census records and other archival sources indicate that prior to comming to Hamilton County they had lived in Virginia and North Carolina. In Graysville, theMelungeons strongly deney their Black heritage andexplain their genetic differences by claiming to have Cherokee grandmothers. Many of the local Whites also claim Cherokee ancestry and apper to accept the Melungeon claim.The recist discrimination common in Hancock County and in other Melungeon communities is absent in Graysville. Here, the Melungeons interact in all phases of mommunity life,and exogamy with local Whites is common practice.- Goins- and the term “Melungeon” is not used by the people or by their neighbors. Recent field observations of the Graysville Melungeons differ in no way from that of any other small\n\nsouthern Appalachian community.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nNo people in Tennessee havebeen subjected to more romantic speculation than have the so-call “Melungeons” These dark-skinned people, living in a White world,strongly denied their Black ancestry and attempted to explain their color by saying they were of Portuguese decent (Burnett 1889:347-349) Popular writters have elaborated on this theme (c.f.Willis 1971:2-8;Zuber n.d.)They have been claimed to be descendants of the “Lost Tribes of Isreal(Bible1975:74-80),old world Gypsies(Bell1975:21),mythical “Welsh Indians”(Bible 1975:81-82; Willia 1971: 5) or Arabs ( Ball 1945: 5-7;1975 22) others\n\nhave attempted to link their origin with established historical events. Raleigh’s “Lost Colony” and the DeSoto expedition are two examples(c.f.Peters 1970) In what is possibly the least plausible claim, it is a matter of legal record that the Tennessee courts have excepted “proof” that Melungeons are descendants of settlers from ancient Carthage(Shepherd 1915)\n\nThe actual ethnic background of the Melungeons and their place of origin is far less dramic.Modern genetic studies (c.f.Gilbert 1946:438-477; Pollitzer and Brown 1969:388-400;Pollitzer 1972: 719-734 ) have demonstrated that Melungeons are a tri-racial people with Indian,African,and European ancestry. Similarly, there is no mystry as to their origin.In a momumental study of tri-racial peoples of eastern United States,(Price 1950a:182-190) has used census records and other archival sources to demonstrate that the Melungeons are but one of many groups of loose societies of marginal mixed- bloods which came into being durning the latter part of the eighteenth century.Far from beingunique, the Melungeons are but one of the some of two hundred documentedtri-racial peoples (Beal1957:187-196;Berry 1963: 15)\n\nIn Tennessee, public attention has usually focused on the Melungeon communities of the upper East Tennessee. In particular, Hancock and Hawkins Counties are usually reguarded as the Melungeon homeland. There are, however, well documented Melungeon communities in Virginia(Bell1975) and Kentucky (Price1950) as well as other parts of Tennessee (Walraven n.d.);Brazelton.Roan County,Tennessee; in the Bell’s Bend area of the Cummberland River west of Nashville(Price1950; and in Werner 1973:44-45)\n\nRegarding the Graysville community, a recent researcher (Bible 1975:29)has observed:”The Graysville aggregate is probably one of the most stable of all Melungeon communities today.” This community is the subject of the present study. The purpose of this paper is not to perpetuate the popular myth of an exotic Melungeon race, but rather to provide an ethnographic description of the culture background and contemporary lifeof the Graysville Melungeons.The term”Melungeon” is used solely for the purpose of defining the study group and is not intended asa negitive reflection onthe ethnic background of any member of the community. The data presented herein were obtained by the author durning an extended study of the community from November 1976 through August 1977, and are based on personal observations,83 informal interviews with 36 residents of the community and surrounding areas, and a review of available documentry and published material.\n\nGEOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND\n\nGraysville is a small semi-urban community similar to the hundreds of other country towns characteristic of the Appalachian area. As is often the case in thesouthern Appalachians, Graysville has no clearly defined boundary between the urban and therural. There are no paved streets and there is no real busness district. Sprinkled haphazardly among the fading frame dwelling houses are two general purpose “grocery” stores, a TV repair shop, a small communitylibrary, a barber shop, three automotive repair shops, and oneservice station. The cummunity has a school and eightprotestantchurches—-four of which are Baptist.There is no local industry. The economy of the area is geared toward small scale farming, minning, and pulp-wood cutting, supplemented with sporadic industrial employment outside the area.\n\nThe community is located in the southern part of Rhea County, Tennessee approximately twomiles north of Hamilton County line and one mile west of US Highway 27, rugged ridges, typical of eastern Tennessee Valley(Burchard 1913:16-17) surround the town.Lone Mountain in the north, and Black Oak Ridge to the east from two sides of a rough triangle in which Graysville is located. The third side of the triangle is formed by Walden’s Ridge on the west.The Cumberland escarpment, which forms the eastern edge of the ridge , is cut by many streams heading directly against the rim(Nelson1925:18). One of these, Roaring Creek, flows along the southwestern side of Graysville.The central portionof the community sprawls between the base of Walden’s Ridge on the west and the tracks of the Cincinnati, New Orleans, and Texas Railroad to the east.\n\nThe town takes it’s name from William GRAY, one of it’s earliest and best known residents, who arrived there after the Civil War.The real beginning of the community was marked when by the comming of the railroad.It then experienced an influx of population from all directions. The post officewas established in 1875 with William Gray as the postmaster. In 1884 Henry and William FOX organized the Fox Coal Company, which opened it;s mines in the side of Walden’s Ridge west of town.In addition to coal, a large deposit of tile clay was also mined from an adjoining range of hills and shipped to markets in other areas.A bank was organized and two hotels were established (c.f.Campbell 1940:78-79)In 1835 , an additional demandfor coal wascreated in the areaby the establishment the Dayton Coal and Iron Company a few miles to the north. Funded by European investors, the Dayton Coal and Iron operated 375 coke ovens in which coke was made from coal to fuel two large blast furnaces with an annualproduction capacity of 90,000 tons of foundry and forge pig iron.(anonymous 1889:46) After 1900 the Fox Coal Company at Graysville was acquired and expanded by the Durham Coal and Iron Company, and a large coke oven complex was established near Roaring Creek. After an\n\ninitial period of intense prosperity, the industrial development of Graysville entered a decline following World War 1 and wascompletely crushed by the economic depression of the 1930’s. Most of the mines wereclosed. The bank was consolidated with the Dayton Bank, the hotels were closed, and the people began to leave.The present population is less than one thousand persons.\n\nEthnicly, wit the exception of the Melungeons component, the community is largly composed of persons of Anglo-Scotch-Irish-descent who have lived in the area for at least three generations. There are no Blacks in the community,and most of theresidents, including the Melungeons, tend to expressstrong racist attitudes in their conversation.\n\nSocial cleavage is alongreligious rather than ethnic lines in Graysville. In 1891, several families of Seventh Day Adventists settled in Graysville. A year later a relogious academy was established by the group. A sanitarium was also set up and enjoyed a wide patronage.While these facilities were later moved to Collegedale in Hamilton County, Tennessee, many of the people remain in Graysville and still tend to hold themselves apart of the rest of the community.\n\nThe most common surname among the Graysville Melungeons is Goins, being prevalent that the Whites in the surrounding area call all the Graysville Melungeons “Goinses”.rather than Melungeons. In fact, the term “Melungeons”is rarely used anywhere in lower East Tennessee.(c.f.Fort 1971) The Goins family are so well known in Rhes County that any darkskinned person, not reguarded as Black ,issaid to look like a Goins. Researcher has demonstrated that Goins is also the most common surname found among many tri-racial groups other than Melungeons.(Price1951: 263 and 1953 : 150 )has observed.\n\nThe name Goins seems to be a peculiar marker of these mixed-bloods.\n\nIt has already been mentioned in connection with the Melungeons and\n\ncertain strains in North Carolins. It is prominent among the mixed-bloods\n\nof Darke Co. Ohio, and was associated with the Redbones in what is\n\nnow Calcasieu Parish. It is a monor name among the Croatans and is the\n\nchief name among a mixed -blood group with a special school in Williams-\n\nburg County South,Carolina.Further, Goins is a unusual name;though many\n\nwhites are named Goins, it occurred with much greater frequencyamong\n\n“free persons of Color” on 1830 than among the population at large in\n\n1790 in six populous Southern and middle states..Over a hundred free\n\ncolored families named Goins were well scattered in 1830 through the\n\nSouth and southern parts of the Northern border states. The two greatest\n\nconcentrations occured in the Melungeon area and the north Carolina-\n\nVirginia Piedmont where so many are found today.\n\nDromgoole (1891:749) states that among the Hancock/Hawkins County Melungeons\n\nthe “African branch” of ancestry was introduced by a man named Goins who entered\n\nthe area shortly after the formation of the state of Tennessee. While she called him a “negro”, it is more likely that he was of mixed black/white ancestry and termed in the language of the day a “mulatto”This contention is somewhat substantiated by early land records (Werner 1970: 60). Dromgoole indicates that the Goins mentioned came from North Carolina. Both North Carolina and Virginia had several mullatto’s named Goins (spelled Gowen and Goin) , who were vetrans of the American Revolution, and it is possible that the individual in question came to Tennessee as the recipient of a land grant for his military service. Colonial records show three men named Gowen serving in a mullato militia unit in 1754, and land records from 1718 show Mihill Gowen as a property owner in James County , Virginia. The same unusual name, Mihill Gowen, was born by a color servant who gained his freedom in 1657 (Price1953:151) Going back futher, we find the first person named Goins/Gowen is a Thomas Gowne, arriving in Virginia as a passenger on the “Globe” in 1635 ( Hotten:1953:151) The spelling of the name suggests that Thomas probably was of Welch origin . Presumably he founded the Goins family in the new world by fathering children with a Black slave or bond servant.\n\nHISTORICAL BACKGROUND\n\nBoth local tradition and documentry sources agree that the Graysville Melungeons entered\n\nthe community from Hamilton County, Tennessee sometime after 1880. Census reords showthat priot to 1880 there were no perons with Melungeon surnames living in Rhea County(Price1950:183). There were, however, such persons among the earliest non-Indiansettlers in Hamilton County. In 1830, when Hamilton County reported less than 400 families total in the census records, there were four Goins(spelled Gowan,Gowin,or Goens) families present. Each of these families listed colored members (total of 13) and three of them also had white members(totalof 6) The most prominent of these first Melungeon settlers in Hamilton County was David Goens, a vetran of the American Revolution. David Goens was born in Hanover County, Virginia. Durning the war he served in the company commanded by acaptain Rodgers of Halifax County ,Virginia.After moving to Grainger Co. Tennessee. From Grainger County he moved to Hamilton County Tennesseewhere he died in 1834. His younger brother, Laban Goesn, came to Hamilton County with him(c.f.Armstrong1931:195-196).\n\nThe Hamilton County census of 1840 listed 13 “free Persons of Color” families as residents of the county,8 of which were named Gowin with a total of 53 persons. in 1850 , there were 16 “Mullatto”families named Goins( spelled Goins,Gozen,or Gowens) Of this group two members were bornin Virginiaand one in North Carolina. The rest ,some as old as 50 , were born in Tennessee.\n\nAfter the 1850 census the Melungeons in Hamilton County are no longer listed as :free persons of color” or “mullato’s”. A few were reguarded as Black but most were listed as white. Other Melungeon surnames present in the early records are Bolden,Bolin,or Bolton\n\nand Collins. Following 1880 there is a decrease in Melungeon names listed for Hamilton County,accompanied by the appearance of them on list from Rhea CountY(Price1950:\n\n182-183)\n\nWith the exception of David and Leban Goens, there is no record of where the individual Melungeons who moved to Hamilton County originated. It is probable, however, thatmost of them came from the upper East Tennessee area where Melungeons were numerousby the end of the eighteenth century. While unable to directly trace individuals,(Price 1850: 190) has established that the Melungeons came into being around that time as one of several loose societies of marginal mixed bloods, with most of their members entering Tennessee from the Virginia-North Carolina Piedmont area.\n\nThere is no record that the early Melungeon settlers in Hamilton County formed a separate community or reguarded themselves as a distinct ethnic group. Many of them settled in the northern end of the county in the Sale Creek area, only about 5 miles from the present town of Graysville. Here there was some intermarriage with the HICKS and FIELDS families who were a European-Cherokee mixed blood group(Werner1973:39-41) Today Sale Creek has few families who call themselves “Black Cherokee” but are reguarded as Blacks by their White neighbors. The Graysville Melungeons emphatically deny any relationship withthis group, but it is probable that such a relationship does, in fact , exist.\n\nSome of the Hamilton County Melungeons seem to have been reported as Indians. A newspaper article, appearing in the Chattanooga Times, March 31, 1894, relates to a man names William Bowlin described in the sub-heading as a “half witted Melungeon” and in the text as a ” half witted Indian”. Further in the text he is reffered to as “belonging to that peculiar people called the Melungeons”.\n\nAlso in Chattanooga, in 1872, there was a widely publicized court case involving a Melungeon. The case involved a lawsuit challenging the inheritance of some property by a girl whose mother had been a Melungeon named Bolton. The contention was that the girl could not legally inherit the land due to the fact, asshe was a Melungeon, her mother had been part Black and since interracial marriages was illegal in Tennessee, the girl was therefore illegitimate.Her attorney, S.L.Shepherd,won the case by convincing the court that Melungeons have no Black ancestry,but arerather derived from ancient Carthaginians\n\nwho come from North America by way of Pourtugal(Shepheard1915: 89-90;Rodgers\n\n1936 and 1941; Mynder 1945)\n\nThe first Melungeon to settle in the Graysville Community was George Goins who has\n\nchildren still living in the area . He was born in Hamilton County around 1865. His wife,Cordie, was born in 1876. Her maiden name and place of birth are not known, but her children recall that she claimed to be Cherokee. The children of George and Cordie Goins, Alvin(also known as Albert) and Gracie Goins Patton are the oldest Melungeons living in the community today. Alvin was born in 1903 and his sister was born a few years earlier.\n\nIn Graysville, the Melungeons are fully accepted and participate fully in all phases of community life. When schools were segregated, their children attended White schools without question. Intermarriage between Melungeon and White non Melungeons individuals in the community is a common pattern.\n\nA less tolerant attitude was reported by an earlier observer (Price 1950: 157-158, who states:\n\nThe Melungeons here are characterized by a single surname, GOINS, though several others have been aquired, apparently by intermarriage with the Goins. The group consists mostly of miners and farm laborers and form 30-40 percent of the population of the town.\n\nThese people are grouped under the general term “the Goins” and the better known term “Melungeon” is applied by the relatively few who link them with the broader group. Some of these people are distinctly dark in skin and claim to be Cherokee Indian ancestry; probably more appear White and belong tothe sort of hereditary proletariat elsewhere described. The fiinges of Graysville are frayed with small painted and unpainted houses and shacks which are occupied by this class of people.\n\nThe Graysville residents make it clear that the Goins people are shiftless and thriftless, slow and unambitious, but not objectionable. If they fight, they fight with each other; when they are put in jail, it is usually for drunkeness, never for serious social crimes. They form a rather docile laboring group, never making trouble or trying to push their own cause. This lack of interest, noticeable even in the children, irritates their teachers, and their lack to thrift, as usual, justifies those who would say”You can’t do anything to help people like that.”\n\nOccasional familiesare found in Dayton ir in otherparts of the county.Their residence in Graysville goes back as far as anyone can remember. There is no obvious reason for this concentraction, though some of the Goins have given the local welfare office the report that they moved from Hamilton County because they were excluded from white schools there. Right to attend white schools in Rhea County is said to have been established in a lawsuit of the 1890’s when a Melungeon ancestry was shown not to be negro. Some have been employed on farms for a long time, and some of the older people remember certain Goinges as mountain-dwellers and expert hunters.\n\nAdditional observations on the Graysville community were made by Warner 1973:44-45\n\nas followed:\n\nOral tradition in Rhea County holds that the Melungeons first came there because in Hamilton County they were classified as non – White and were not allowed to attend white schools. Another story, which may variation of this one, states that they came there,not from Hamilton County but from North Carolina and South Carolina,because they were not allowed to vote. The first of these stories is partly supported by the fact that the town of Graysville, which once had a very large Melungeon population (30-40 percent at the time of E.T.Price’s writting) is extremely close to the county line dividing Hamilton from Rhea County,as if the people had moved no farther than absolutely necessary. The dates,however, are inconsistant. If the Goins in Hamilton County ceased to be classified as non whitein 1850, that would not give them a reason to move to Rhea County shortly before 1880. A possible explanation is that the census classification did not conform to every day practice, or that Melungeons were present in Rhea County before 1850 but for some reason were not recorded in the census.\n\nThe most resent researcher to comment on the community (Bible 1975:29-30)\n\nStill others settled in Hamilton County, Tennessee, but mainly today have intermingled with the non Melungeon population to such extent that theycan no longer be identified. A sizable number moved from there several generations ago to Graysville, a small village in Rhea County at the foot of Walden Ridge, reportedly because they did not want their children to go to school with negroes.\n\nLargely Goinses sprinkled through with a few additional names from intermarriage, they are generally considered Melungeons, although they do not refer to themselves by the name. Usually they speak of their mixed Indian and white ancestry. Even though smaller than it formerly was, the Graysville aggregate is probably one of the mosy stable of all Melungeon communities today. While a number go from time to time to the North and East in search of better paying jobs in industry, quite a few have returned to Graysville to settle down when they reashed retirment age.\n\nEacvh of the above quoted writters included the comment onthe Graysville Melungeons as a part of their broad study on Melungeons, or Triracial groups in general. While they briefly visited the community, they derived most of their data from non white Melungeons, many of whom were not residents of the community and whose personal contact with Melungeons was limited to social work, teaching, etc. This over reliance on indirect sources has resulted in a few misconceptions which will be considered below.\n\nWhile the Goins families, as noted by Price, do in fact make up the majority of the easily recognized Melungeons in the community, they do not have the single traditional Melungeon surname. In addition to the Goins families, well established Melungeon surnames gained through exogamous marriage include HAMBRICK LEFFEW PATTON\n\nand HENDERSON\n\nAlthogh Price and Bible appear to feel that the Graysville Melungeons are declining in numbers through migeration and assimilation, this is not altogether an accurate picture. While the community is affected by out-migration, largely for economic reasons, the numbers of people leaving are consistent with that found in any other Appalachian group.Furthermore, most of those who leave Graysville eventually return. Neither does the well established practice of exgamy diminish the population.If, for emample, a Goins brother and sister each have children, the off-spring of both will be equally Melungeon even tho her’s will have a non-Melungeon surname, while his retain the name Goins. This being the case, it is presently estimated that approximately two-thirds ofthe populationof Graysville have some degree of Melungeon ancestry, or are related to the Melungeons through marriage.\n\nThe physocal characteristics noted among the Graysville Melungeons vary greatly. While precise ethnic categorization isbeyound the capabilities of theauthor, a few general observationsmay be noted. Based on appearance, it appears that the strongest genetic factor in the background of the Graysville Melungeonsis northernEuropean. About half of them havevery fair skin, with light brown hair or blond hair. Some have blue eyes. This is particularly true of the younger members of the community. Some have dark skin, but no more so than many non Melungeonswho spend much of their time outdoors. There are a few with slight negroid features such as wide nose,thick lips, etc., and some who have a somewhat similar appearance to Cherokee-White mixed bloods. Two women in the community exhibit Cherokee-like features. As a general statement, however, it may be said that fewof the Graysville Melungeons would be noticably different from residents of any Appalachian community.\n\nThe Graysville Melungeons apparently feel no special kinship with other Mlungeon communities in the state. When asked directly if they had relatives in Hancock or Hawkins Counties most responded that they did not. One, however, did state that she had heard of some people up thar with the same name as us, Goins but was unaware of the degree of relationship. None of the people in the surrounding area associate the Graysville Melungeonswith any other older Melungeon communities.\n\nMost of the Graysville Melungeons interviewed by the author, including those who are currently “on the welfare” , have preformed exceedingly hard manual labor most of their lives. Furthermore, they ususally express a willingness to do so again if job opportunities\n\nwith decent pay present themselves. those who are currently employed in regular jobs in instudtry have a remarkable record of low absenteeism. One man interviewed remarked he had worked at a particular manufactoring plant in Chattanooga for more than ten years without missing a single schuduled workday,and had been late for work only two times. This record is made even more remarkable by the fact that this man did not own a car and depended on” hitching a ride or walking” to make the daily round trip of sixty miles.\n\nRegardless of their source of income, most Melungeons are unable to follow any form of savings program. Food is a major expense item. Food items purchased on a routine basis include such staples as flour, meal, diied beans of the pinto variety, chunks of pork fat called “sowbelly”or “fat back” processed animal fats called lard, potatoes, and commercially canned foods –ususally corn and beans. In season they grow numerous vegetables and mellons for their own consumption and also supplement purchased foods with a variety of wild plants.\n\nThrer are three other types of regulary purchased items which, while not food, are reguarded as essential by most Melungeons. These are Tobacco, coffee, and alcoholic beverages.In the nineteenth century it was noted that they were addicated to “their filty habit of chewing tobacco” Dramgoole 1891: 474) and a more recent writter Varbough 1972) quoted a melungeon woman as saying” We both chew tobacco. I do because I don’t what to smell his(her husband’s) breath.” Among the Melungeons the use of tobacco is almost universal. One one occasion, while visiting a family, the author was asked for a cigarette by a nine year old child. Both parents were present and assured me it was alright, adding that he had been smoking for two to three years. While the younger melungeons smoke cigaretts, the older people prefer to take theor tobacco orally. Powered tobacco called “snuff” is favored by most women, and is considered to be more refinded and “lady-like” Men usually use chewing tobaccowhich has been pressed into a compact, rectangular cake called a “plug”, or a few leaves of tobacco twisted together called a\n\ntwist”. Most homes have an assh-filled containter for spitting location in the room where guests are recieved It is also a common practice for individuals to carry a small tin can\n\nfilled with ashes with them for the same purpose. It is a sure sign of social acceptance when a Melungeon man produces his “plug” or “Twist” and ask” Wud ye keer fer a chew?”\n\nAll Melungeons regardless of sex or age are fond of coffee.(Dramgoole 1891: 476) observed that:”Coffee is quite common among the Melungeons, they drink it without sweetening, and drink ir cold at all hours of the day or night. “In Graysville is is still the case. Every home has a large coffee pot which is filled in the morning and kept on the stove all day. Neither cream or sugar is used.\n\nMany earlier writters have stressed the Melungeons fondness for alcholic beverages(c.f.Dromgoole 1891:474;Ball1975:68;Cole and Looney 1934:25;Peters 1970) and they are frequently described as being involved in the distilling or selling of illegal whiskey commonly refered to as “moonshine”(c.f.Hale and Merritt 1913:182; Dabney 1974 :138-139; Price 1951:258;Ivey 1975:1-8) In the Graysville community the use of alchol has somewhat ambiguous position.On the other hand, most of the melungeons are members of religious sects which strongly damn any use of alchol as a heinous “sin” , and the term “drunkard” or “sot” is considered hightly derogatory\n\nIn the purchase of clothing the Melungeons patronize the lower priced discount stores that specialize in cheap material or factory seconds. The most common costume for a woman is a cotton print dress. The men prefer trousers made of denim material or bibed overalls\n\nwith a brightly colored shirt. Woman and children frequently do not wear shoes, especially in their home areas durning summer.\n\nMajor electric items such as stoves, refrigators, wash machines and television sets are usually gotten used.Automobiles are usually used when purchased. Most Melungeons have learned to be fix-er-upers\n\nFor understandable reason few melungeons have bank accounts and even fewer are eligible for conventional loans.Nevertheless, most have a charge account at the local store for grocerys. On several occasions after becoming familiar with the community, the author was asked for the loan of a dollar er two. On each of these occasions a particular date was suggested for repayment and in every instance the loan was repayed.\n\nFAMILY STRUCTURE\n\nMelungeon families, as have been observed in other areas, are commonly rather large. In Hancock County it has been said that Melungeons start having sexual relations as soon as they are old enough, regardless of blood kinship, marry at an early age, bring into the world as children as nature allowes, then in the end to die no better off than their parents who lived before them .\n\nMelungeons are extremely fond of children and there is no such thing as an unwanted child among them. Many regard their children as their hope for security when they grow old. One Melungeon woman has been quoted as saying” I have 6 living children and I had ten mishaps….It don’t hurt me much anymore. Well. a body just has to have children and say nothin about it. Why I don’t care if I have that many more. If you have a lot of children when you get old you have somebody to take care of you.” (Cole and Looney 1934:22-23)\n\nRelationships between extended family members and in-laws are friendly. A typical house-\n\nhold may contain the husband and wife with 5-6 children, the the husbands mother; the wife’s younger sister with two illegitimate children, and one to two of the wife’s brothers who stay from time to time.\n\nThe Melungeon male is quick to announce that he is the “boss” of his household. He is customarily served first at meal times and frequently has a special chair which otherfamily members relinguish when he is present.Im most cases, however, when it comes to practical matters, it is the wife who primarily controls the family.\n\nMelungeon children recieve little to no encouragement from their parents in reguard to their school work. The parents ate functionallu illiterate in many cases. Fre home subscribe to publications of any kind, and in most homes the only book will be the ever-present bible,and it is reguarded more as a cult object than an example of literature. The young\n\nchild is praised when he learns to count toone hundred and write his name, but beyond\n\nthat theparents show little interest.This lack of interest in deucation is similar to that mentioned by other observers of mother Melungeon communityies (c.f.Ball 1975:68; Dromgoole 1891:477)\n\nPopular writters like to dwell on the gross sexual immorlity of the Melungeons. In a typical example,Cole and Looney (1934:24) state: “Euraka, the oldest daughter of Amos Gibson is pregrant. Her brother who is a year older than she is is supposely the father of the child.” Similar stories are told reguarding some of the Graysville Melungeons by persons outside the community. However, none of the stories can be substantiated. A check with the county authorities in Dayton reveals the fact that in the past five years there have been five criminal prosecutions for incest in the county. None of these cases involved the Melungeons and none occured in Graysville.\n\nThere is ,hovever, a somewhat casual attitude toward marriage on the part of some of the Melungeons, and illegitimate births are fairly common.In these incidents there is no social stigma attached to either the mother or child. As she grows older, it is customery for the neighbors of the woman with a illegitimate children to call her a “widow” without reguard to wheather or not she has been previously married. In addition to the universal reason for extra-marital sex. The sisuation in Graysville is further complicated by the fact that in the past years many males were forced to spend a great deal of time outside the comminity for economic reasons . The great love Melungeon women have for children is another factor.\n\n(Cole and Looney 1934:23) quotethe neighbors of one such woman as saying” she never had no husband–she had to get her young’ums the best way she could.”\n\nTRANDITION TO ORAL CULTURE\n\nVOCAL TRAITS…..The eariliest writer to publish personal observations on Melungeon speech(Dromgoole1891:475) remarks that “they do not drawl like the mountaineers but , on the contrary, speak rapidly and talk a great deal” she futher added”the laugh of the Melungeon women is most exquisitely musical jingle, a perfect ripple of sweet sound”.\n\nThese traits are present, at least to a degree, in the Graysville Melungeons.There is considerable difference in vocal habits used by indiv idual Melungeons– in particular those who have lived in other parts of the country.Most have a tendency to be somewhat laconic in the presence of strangers. However, when this natural reserve is broken down, or when the individual becomes excited or emotional, the speech becomes very rapid.The “musicial” quality of female laughter as noted by\n\nDromgoole is also present among the Melungeons of Graysville Melungeons. It is , however, more usually found among the younger women. The laughter of some of the older ones could better be described as a harsh ceckle.\n\nPRONOUNCIATION\n\nIn Melungeon folkspeech vowel substitution is common. This trait has been noted among the upper TennesseeMelungeons by a resent writer ( Davis 1976:172) who observed:\n\nThey was always three in her vocabulary, and yonder was Yander. Patatoes was taters, and Maryland, where one of her daughters lives was Murland.\n\nThese, as well as numberous other examples of vowel substitution, are to be found among the Graysville Melungons. Thus far”Fer” or”Fur” , while fire becomes “far”. Had is pronounced “hed”; Just becomes “jist”; itch becomes “eetch” , come is “cum”; iron is “arn”;whip is “whup”; brush is “brash”; etc.\n\nWhen two vowels sound are joined in a single syllable to form what is called a diphthong, the Melungeons will usually drop one of the sounds all together.Thus pronouncing hair as “hear”; bear as “bar”; boil as”bile”; chair as “cheer”; etc\n\nWhile not as common as vowel substitution, consonant sounds are also frequently interchangedwith others. For some reason the “th”sound is occasionally replaced with “f”. Thus, thunder becomes “funder”; teeth is teef”; three is “free”etc.\n\nThe dialect of the Melungeon is a cross between that of the mountaineer and the negro–a corruption, perhaps of both. The letter R occupies but small space in their speech, and they have a pecular habit of omitting the last letter, sometimes the last syllable of their words. For instance “good night is ” goo night” give is “gi” ect. Their dialect is exceedingly difficult to write, owning to their habit of curtailing their words.\n\nIn addition to this obmission of final sounds in words, the Graysville Melungeons are also prone to omitting the beginning sounds. For example despise is ofen pronounced “spise”;\n\nexcept becomes “cept” ; examine becomes “zamine: etc.\n\nIt should be emphasized that the above peculiarities in pronounciation are uniformally used by the Graysville Melungeons. In fact, most melungeons are perfectly aware of the conventional pronounciation of any given word. It is possible to hear the same individual, at different times, pronounce the word “just” as “jest”, “jus”, “jist” or correctly as “just” There is an apparent unconcious attempt to modify one’s speech to conform to that of a particular listener, in much the same manner that an American-born child of Italian parents will speak correctly in English in school, mixed Italian and English slang in the streets, and broken English with many Italians words in the home.\n\nGRAMMER\n\nThe grammer of the Melungeon folksspeech is especially rich in verbs. Many of these are created directly from nouns or adjectives. Thus, when a man is going hunting he will frequently announce that he is going “squirrelin”. A girl who is developing promiscuous habits is said to be “manin”, and when a man puts away his money , he “pockets ” it. When a man takes a woman to bed , it may be said that he has “beded “her. Going to shop for food is called “marketin”.\n\nMany verbs taken on an unusual form in the past tense. Thus drank becomes “drunk”; stank is “stunk”; swan is “swum”; dropped is “drapt”etc.\n\nThe use of double negatives or triple negatives are very common. When one is short of funds, he would say”I ain’t got no money” A girl who is chaste is said to be one who “ain’t never done nothin yet”\n\nVOCABULARY\n\nThe claim has been made that the Melungeons speak with Elizabethian English (Ball1975:70), and while this is an obvious exaggeration, there are numerous archaisms to be found in Melungeon speech. Some of these are recognizable as Elizabethian or Chaucerian ir even pre-Chaucertain words or terms. For example the pronound “hit”(it) dates English itself, being defined as early Anglo-Saxon neuter of “he” ( Kephart 1976:\n\n687). Other early English words include “ax” (ask) and “Kag” (keg). A few additional words or expressions in everyday life of the Graysville Melungeons that were also used by Chaucer are “afore”(before), “atwixt” (between), “awar”(aware) , “heap” ( large quanity)\n\n“peart”( lively) and “stout” (strong).\n\nThe author encountered only two words in use among the Graysville Melungeons which are of non English origin. Both of these words relate to foods. The first of these is “Kraut” which is German and applies to a concoction made from cabbage. The second one os “okra” which is the name of a vetable and is of African in origin.\n\nSome common words take on a different meaning when used by Melungeons, as “ruin” for injure, “sorry” for bad, “favor” for resemble, or “stump” for stumble. When a Melungeon ask to be “carried” somewhere, a ride in your car is what he desires.\n\nTRADITIONAL MATERIAL CULTURE\n\nMelungeons are a very practical people, and as such see no value in preserving traditional crafts when there is an easier way to obtain the desired results. The home making of clothing is an excellent example to make all of her clothing in the home. This was usually done entirely by hand with nothing but needle, thread, and scissors. It was necessary to purchase the cloth, since even among the oldest women now living there is no tradition for spinning and weaving. A favorable source of cloth was “flour sacks”. It seems that at that time a company which processed four sold their products in bags made of brightly colored\n\n“print”material designed for the use of clothing.\n\nIn making the dresses, formal patterns were not used. The woman simply estimated the desire size as she cut the material and sewed it together. Then additional folds were adjusted and sewed to make it fit snugly. In addition to dresses for herself and her daughters, the woman frequently made shirts for the men of the family out of the same material. As sewing accessories, every woman kept a button-box and a cloth -box for future use.The larger cloth box contained discarded clothing, scraps left over from dress makingand any other bits and pieces that could be found. This also served the women as sources of rags to be used for towels, wash cloths, and sanitary napkins. In another respect of home crafts, the scraps from the c"
