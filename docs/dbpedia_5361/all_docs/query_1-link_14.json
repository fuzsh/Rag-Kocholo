        "text": "This article is about the given name. For the family name, see Charles (surname). For other uses, see Charles (disambiguation).\n\nCharlesPronunciation\n\nFrench: [ʃaʁl]GenderMaleName dayNovember 4OriginWord/nameFrench, from GermanicMeaningFree manOther namesVariant form(s)Carl, Karl, Carlo, Carlos, CarolusRelated namesFeminine: Caroline, Charlotte, Charlene\n\nCharles is a masculine given name predominantly found in English and French speaking countries.[1] It is from the French form Charles of the Proto-Germanic name ᚲᚨᚱᛁᛚᚨᛉ (in runic alphabet) or *karilaz (in Latin alphabet), whose meaning was \"free man\". The Old English descendant of this word was Ċearl or Ċeorl, as the name of King Cearl of Mercia, that disappeared after the Norman conquest of England.\n\nThe name was notably borne by Charlemagne (Charles the Great), and was at the time Latinized as Karolus (as in Vita Karoli Magni), later also as Carolus.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name's etymology is a Common Germanic noun *karilaz meaning \"free man\", which survives in English as churl (< Old English ċeorl),[2] which developed its deprecating sense in the Middle English period.\n\nSome Germanic languages, for example Dutch and German, have retained the word in two separate senses. In the particular case of Dutch, Karel refers to the given name, whereas the noun kerel means \"a bloke, fellow, man\".[citation needed]\n\nIn the form Charles, the initial spelling ch- corresponds to the palatalization of the Latin group ca- to [tʃa] in Central Old French (Francien) and the final -s to the former subjective case (cas sujet) of masculine names in Old French like in Giles or James (< Latin -us, see Spanish/ Portuguese Carlos).\n\nAccording to Julius Pokorny, the historical linguist and Indo-Europeanist, the root meaning of Charles is \"old man\", from Indo-European *ĝer-, where the ĝ is a palatal consonant, meaning \"to rub; to be old; grain.\" An old man has been worn away and is now grey with age.[clarification needed][3]\n\nIn some Slavic languages, the name Drago (and variants: Dragomir, Dragoslav, etc., all based on the root drag 'dear') has been used as an equivalent for Charles (Karel, etc.). This is based on the false etymology deriving Carl from Latin carus 'dear'.[4] Examples are the Slovene politician Karel Dežman (1821–1889), also known as Dragotin Dežman, and the Slovene historian Dragotin Lončar (1876–1954), baptized Carl.[5]\n\nHistory\n\nEarly Middle Ages\n\nThe name is atypical for Germanic names as it is not composed of two elements, but simply a noun meaning \"(free) man\". This meaning of ceorl contrasts with eorl (Old Norse jarl) \"nobleman\" on one hand and with þeow (Old Norse þræll) \"bondsman, slave\" on the other. As such it would not seem a likely candidate for the name of a Germanic king, but it is attested as such with Cearl of Mercia (fl. 620), the first Mercian king mentioned by Bede in his Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum. It is a peculiarity of the Anglo-Saxon royal names that many of the rulers of the earliest period (6th to 7th centuries) have monothematic (simplex) names, while the standard dithematic (compounded) names become almost universal from the 8th century. Compare the name of King Mul of Kent (7th century) which simply translates to \"mule\".\n\nCharles Martel, the son of Pepin of Herstal and Alpaida, was either illegitimate or the product of a bigamous marriage, and therefore indeed a \"free man\", but not of noble rank. After his victory at the Battle of Soissons (718), Charles Martel styled himself Duke of the Franks. Charles' eldest son was named Carloman (c. 710 – 754), a rare example of the element carl- occurring in a compound name. The Chronicle of Fredegar names an earlier Carloman as the father of Pepin of Landen, and thus the great-great-grandfather of the Charles Martel. This would place the name Carloman in the 6th century, and open the possibility that the Frankish name Carl may originate as a short form of Carloman. The only other compound name with the Carl- prefix is Carlofred (Carlefred), attested in the 7th century; as a suffix, it occurs in the rare names Altcarl and Gundecarl (9th and 11th centuries, respectively).[6]\n\nCharlemagne (742–814) was Charles Martel's grandson. After Charlemagne's reign, the name became irrevocably connected with him and his Carolingian dynasty. After Charlemagne, the name Charles (Karol) became even the standard word for \"king\" in Slavic (Czech and Slovak král, Polish król; South Slavic kral крал, krȃlj краљ; Russian король), Baltic (Latvian karalis, Lithuanian karalius) and Hungarian (király).\n\nCharlemagne's son Charles the Younger died without issue, but the name resurfaces repeatedly within the 9th-century Carolingian family tree, so with Charles the Bald (823–877), Charles the Fat (839–888) Charles of Provence (845–863), Charles the Child (847/848–866) and Charles the Simple (879–929).\n\nLater Middle Ages and Early Modern history\n\nThe name survives into the High Middle Ages (Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine; Charles, Count of Valois; Charles I, Count of Flanders (Charles the Good, beatified in 1882); Charles I of Naples; Charles I of Hungary). Karl Sverkersson was a king of Sweden in the 12th century, counted as \"Charles VII\" due to a genealogical fiction of the 17th century by Charles \"IX\", but actually the first king of Sweden with this name.\n\nCharles resurfaces as a royal name in Germany with Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor (1316–1378, counted as \"the fourth\" after Charlemagne, Charles the Bald and Charles the Fat) and in France with Charles IV of France (1294–1328, \"the fourth\" after Charlemagne, Charles the Bald and Charles the Simple), and becomes comparatively widespread in the Late Middle Ages (Charles I, Duke of Savoy, Charles III, Duke of Savoy).\n\nCharles V, Holy Roman Emperor (1500–1558) gives rise to a tradition of Charlses in Habsburg Spain (Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, Charles II of Spain, Charles III of Spain, Charles IV of Spain).\n\nThe numbering scheme for the kings of Sweden was continued in modern times with Charles X, Charles XI, Charles XII, Charles XIII, Charles XIV and Charles XV.\n\nCharles I of England (1600–1649) is followed by Charles II of England (1630–1685). The Province of Carolina is named during the rule of Charles II, after Charles I.\n\nCharles III Philip, Elector Palatine (1661–1742).\n\nModern history\n\nCarlism is a political movement in Spain seeking the establishment of a separate line of the Bourbon family on the Spanish throne. This line descended from Infante Carlos, Count of Molina (1788–1855), and was founded due to dispute over the succession laws and widespread dissatisfaction with the Alfonsine line of the House of Bourbon. The movement was at its strongest in the 1830s, causing the Carlist Wars, and had a revival following Spain's defeat in the Spanish–American War in 1898, and lasted until the end of the Franco regime in 1975 as a social and political force\n\nCharles Floyd (1782–1804) was the only casualty in the Lewis and Clark Expedition. Charles DeRudio (1832–1910) was an Italian aristocrat, would-be assassin of Napoleon III, and later a career U.S. Army officer who fought in the 7th U.S. Cavalry at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Charles Albert Varnum (1849–1936) was the commander of the scouts in the Little Bighorn Campaign and received the Medal of Honor for his actions in a conflict following the Battle of Wounded Knee. \"Lonesome\" Charley Reynolds (1842–1876) was a scout in the U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment who was killed at the Battle of the Little Bighorn.\n\nCarl has been a very popular male given name in the United States during the late 19th to early 20th centuries, consistently ranking in the top 30 male given names in the US from 1887 to 1938, and remaining among the top 100 until the 1980s, but since declining below rank 500. Charles has always been among the top 100 names in the U.S. since records started in 1880.[7] In addition, it is among the top 100 names given in England and Wales; the current King of the United Kingdom and the other Commonwealth realms, Charles III, is a notable bearer of the name.\n\nDerived feminine names\n\nCaroline and Charlotte are feminine given names derived from Carl.[8][9][10]\n\nCharlotte is late medieval, e.g. Charlotte of Savoy (1441–1483), Charlotte of Cyprus (1444–1487). It was introduced to Britain in the 17th century, and gave rise to hypocorisms such as Lottie, Tottie, Totty.\n\nCaroline is early modern, e.g. Caroline of Ansbach (1683–1737). It has given rise to numerous variations, such as Carlyn, Carolina, Carolyn, Karolyn, Carolin, Karolina, Karoline, Karolina, Carolien, as well as hypocorisms, such as Callie, Carol, Carrie, etc.\n\nAnother derived feminine name is Carla (Bulgarian, Catalan, Dutch, English, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish), a name which dates from early Italy.[11]\n\nRegional forms:\n\nCarolina (Italian, Indonesian, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish, Bulgarian)\n\nCaroline (English, French, Indonesian, Swedish, Danish, Dutch)\n\nCarolyn (English)\n\nCarlijn (Dutch)\n\nKaroliina (Finnish)\n\nKarolina (Bulgarian, Indonesian, Polish, Swedish)\n\nKarolína (Czech)\n\nKaroline (Danish, Indonesian, Norwegian, Swedish)\n\nKarolina (Каролина) (Russian)\n\nKeraleyn (קעראַליין) (Yiddish)\n\nCarly (American)\n\nCarol (English)\n\nCarola (German, Swedish)\n\nCarole (English, French, Portuguese)\n\nKarol (קאַראָל) (Yiddish)\n\nKyārōla (क्यारोल) (Nepali)\n\nKerol (Керол) (Serbian), (Russian)\n\nCharlotte (English, French, German, Swedish, Danish, Dutch)\n\nCarlota (Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan)\n\nCarlotta (Italian)\n\nCharlotta (Swedish)\n\nCarla\n\nCharla (English)\n\nKarla (Bulgarian, German, Indonesian, Scandinavian, Serbian, Czech, Croatian)\n\nКарла (Bulgarian, Russian, Serbian)\n\nCharlene (given name), Charlène\n\nRegional forms of the name\n\nLanguage Formal name Informal name Armenian Կարլոս (Karlos) Basque Karlos Bulgarian Карл (Karl) Belarusian Чарльз (Čarĺz) Catalan Carles Chinese 查尔斯 (simplified), 查爾斯 (traditional) (Chá'ěrsī) Croatian Karlo Czech Karel Danish Karl, Carl Dutch Karel English Charles Charlie/Charley, Chuck, Chucky, Chaz/Chas, Chad, Chip Estonian Kaarel, Kaarli, Kaaro, Kalle Faroese Karl Finnish Kaarlo, Kaarle, Kalle, Karl French Charles Charlot German Karl, Carl Georgian კარლო (Karlo) Greek Κάρολος (Károlos) Hungarian Károly Karcsi Hawaiian Kale Icelandic Karl Indonesian Charles, Carolus Irish Carlus, Séarlas, Cathal Italian Carlo Japanese チャールズ (Chāruzu) Korean 찰스 (chalseu) Latin Carolus Latvian Kārlis Limburgish Sjarel Lithuanian Karolis Norwegian Karl, Carl Polish Karol Portuguese Carlos Carlinhos Romanian Carol Russian Карл (Karl) Scottish Gaelic Teàrlach Serbian Карло (Karlo) Slovak Karol Slovene Karel Spanish Carlos Carlito, Carlitos, Caloy (Philippines) Swedish Karl, Carl, Kalle Welsh Siarl\n\nList of notable people\n\nMedia, arts and entertainment\n\nIn literature\n\nName Description Charles Baudelaire French poet Charles Bukowski American poet and novelist Charles Dickens English novelist Charles Dodgson (pen-name Lewis Carroll) English clergyman, writer and mathematician Charles Edwards Canadian journalist and news agency executive Charles Henri Ford American poet, photographer and writer Charles Fort American writer and researcher into anomalous phenomena Charles L.

In the context of English and British history, \"Saint Charles\" is typically Charles I of England, recognized as a saint in the Anglican confession only. In Roman Catholicism, the best known Saint Charles is Charles Borromeo (1538–1584), an Italian cardinal, canonized by Pope Paul V in 1606. Charles, Duke of Brittany (1319–1364) had been canonized after his death, but Pope Gregory XI annulled this. Charles the Good (died 1127) is sometimes referred to as a saint, but while he was beatified in 1904, he has not been canonized.\n\nOther Saints of the Roman Catholic Church, canonized after 1900:\n\n1904: Saint Charles Garnier (1606–1649), French Jesuit missionary and martyr\n\n1959: Saint Charles of Sezze (1616–1670), Franciscan lay brother\n\n1964: Saint Charles Lwanga (1860 or 1865–1886), Ugandan Catholic martyr\n\n1995: Saint Charles-Joseph-Eugène de Mazenod (1782–1861), French Catholic clergyman\n\n2007: Saint Charles of Mount Argus (1821–1818), Passionist Dutch priest who worked in Ireland\n\nBeatified:\n\n1867: Blessed Charles Spinola (1564–1622), Genoese nobleman\n\n2004: Blessed Charles I of Austria (1887–1922), last emperor of Austria, king of Hungary, Bohemia, etc\n\nChurch leaders\n\nCharles Wesley (1707–1788), co-founder of the Methodist movement and writer of thousands of hymns\n\nCharles Grandison Finney (1792–1875), a leader of the Second Great Awakening in America\n\nCharles W.
