Crayon Shin-chan is a Japanese animated television series, which is otherwise known as Shin Chan in much of the world, as designated by owner TV Asahi. In proper Japanese, the title should be "Shin-chan," but the spelling has eliminated the hyphen for unknown reasons. Shin chan has enjoyed success on multiple continents, including Latin America, parts of Europe, continental Asia, and the United States. The show, which has been in production since 1992, is based on Yoshito Usui's manga series. In Japan, the series is aired in 15 minute, or 30 minute timeslots, which are each made of up smaller vignettes.

History of English adaptation

Around 1996, TV Asahi began an effort to market Crayon Shin-chan to the international market outside of Asia. Unfortunately, this would take a few years, as many countries would not see it til the new millennium hit. The network, along with US representative Lacey Entertainment, commissioned California based Vitello Productions to supervise the localization of the series for the English speaking market. From this version, other versions of the show would be adapted into other languages for Latin America and parts of Europe. The cast of this English adaptation included actors like Kath Soucie, Andi McAfee, Grey Delisle, and Patrick Fraley. This version aired in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Australia, but never managed to air in North America. In 2003, the show's license changed hands again, and then changed studios to Universal City's phuuz entertainment inc. This company re-cast the entire show with experienced ADR actors, and retained all the character names. One of the networks the series was pitched to was Adult Swim, whose VP of production Keith Crofford was revealed to be a fan of the series. Unfortunately, the network passed on phuuz's adaptation, feeling it was more appropriate for a kid audience. Despite no presence in North America, the show gained a lot of attention in other parts of the western world and Europe to make Crayon Shin-chan a larger success worldwide. Most of the networks that aired the series were part of the Fox Kids and later Jetix chain. The license agreement between Lacey Entertainment and TV Asahi expired at the end of 2005.

TV Asahi wasn't ready to throw in the towel for the American market yet. In 2006, Crayon Shin-chan was co-licensed in North America by FUNimation Entertainment alongside TV Asahi. Already aware of the Adult Swim connection, the show was pitched once again to the network, but this time with the intent to re-write the show's dialog for an older audience. Adult Swim accepted, but because of their hesitation with comedy anime, they decided not to go with a full season order and instead go with a 6 episode temporary lease. To ensure better success, FUNimation asked Adult Swim to recommend some Williams Street writers, or former writers, to help them with the English adaptation. FUNimation settled on the writing duo of Evan Dorkin and Sarah Dyer in addition to their own writing talent, which was a Los Angeles based group of comedy television writers hired by Jared Hedges, the show's head writer. The network aired the show in a limited "test run" from August 19th through September 9th.

Due to the success of the test run on Adult Swim, the series was picked up for more episodes due to be released in season boxsets. The first official season of the English adaptation began broadcasting on April 18, 2007, with the notable exception of Dorkin and Dyer, who were cut from punch-up work for unknown reasons. Dorkin speculated in his LiveJournal that it may have been a combination of lateness in his scripts and a cost cutting measure.

History of the Spanish adaptation

The Mexican dub, one of the Spanish-language exports, was a translation of the Vitello dub. Conversely, the dub in Spain which is a translation of the original Japanese version, most notably in the Castile or Castella region, enjoyed a great deal of popularity. Spain is the only country outside of Japan to have a Shin Chan video game released domestically. The series creator has occasionally visited the country because of the success there.

Writing Process of the Funimation dub

One of Shin Chan's full time writers of the Funimation dub, going under the handle Shincowriter, informed animation news site Toonzone.net how the show's ADR writing process occurs. Unlike traditional ADR writing, which is merely adapting overtly literal translations into proper English, Shin Chan's process is more intensive and requires a larger staff.

Step 1: The original series is translated to English. These translations are extremely literal, which is par for the course when it comes to translating for ADR writing.

Step 2: Head writer Jared Hedges gives the individual vignettes to the episode writers. The writers adapt the show and intentionally insert their own comedic dialogue.

Step 3: The head writer double-checks and approves the scripts with the director, Zach Bolton.

Step 4: No longer used - Scripts are sent for a re-write to the punch-up script writers, who proceed to add their own dialogue to the show. The punch-up writers also add alternative improvisational dialogue to the already added lines from the initial writers.

Step 5: The head writer receives the re-write and chooses what lines to use and what not to use. He may also add his own lines. He hands the final copy to the director.

Step 6: The director modifies the script in the booth for mouth movements and lip-synch; a common practice for any ADR work. Actors are also encouraged to improvise while in the booth for Shin Chan's dub. (Principal Ench was given his accent while in the booth by his actor, Jason Liebrecht.)
