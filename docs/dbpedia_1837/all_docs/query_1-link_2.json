        "text": "The subject on this page is intended for mature audiences.\n\nFunimation acquired the Shin-chan US license in 2005. Funimation's dub takes many liberties with the source material and was heavily Americanized. Many sexual references, dark humor, and references to then-current popular American culture were added, including many jokes about subjects such as Jews, terrorism, and Viagra. Characters were given significantly different personalities and new, previously non-existent backstories.\n\nFor instance, Shin is refused an allowance, on he basis that he could use it to buy drugs (crystal meth), his schoolmate Kazama ('Georgie Herbert Walker Prescott III' in this dub) was an absurdly hawkish ultra-conservative Republican, the unseen father of Nene (known in the dub as \"Penny\") was suggested to be physically abusive towards both his wife and daughter, Principal Enchou was rewritten as a half Romani, half Peruvian man with a complicated, checkered backstory that includes a stint as an accident-prone magician, The kids' teacher: Yoshinaga-sensei (known in the dub as \"Miss Polly\"), was rewritten as a kinky and often domineering nymphomaniac,\n\nGeneral[]\n\nFunimation's version features a Texas-based cast of voice actors. Funimation's dub takes many liberties with the source material and was heavily Americanized. Similar to the Vitello dub, episodes of the series were dubbed out of their original order, and segments were reordered. Additionally, many characters had their names changed to American-sounding ones. Many sexual references, dark humor and references to current popular American culture were added. For example, in one scene, Ai and Penny argue over which one of them is Jessica Simpson (whose first album was not released until 1999) and which one is Ashlee Simpson (whose first album was not released until 2004), which is very different from the original Japanese script that dealt with many social issues within Japan at the time. At least two episodes reference Rudy Giuliani and his unsuccessful bid for President.\n\nNew, previously non-existent backstories were created, as well as significantly different personalities for the characters. For instance, the unseen father of Nene (known in the dub as \"Penny\") was suggested to be physically abusive toward both his wife and daughter, and this was used as a source of black humor. Playing on his conservative manner Kazama is portrayed as the privileged son of a die-hard Republican family. The school Shinchan and his friends attend to is called Super Happy Fun Time American School. Principal Enchou was rewritten as a half Peruvian, half Gypsy man with a complicated prior life that includes a stint as a magician, in which he accidentally injured scores of audience members. Ageo-sensei (known in the dub as \"Miss Polly\"), Shinnosuke's teacher, was rewritten as a kinky nymphomaniac, while Shin's schoolmate, Kazama, (known in the dub as \"Georgie\") was portrayed as a hawkish conservative. Nene's stuffed bunny came to life three times during lunar eclipse to take revenge on the ones who used him as a punch bag. During the regeneration the bunny was voiced by actor Jerry Jewell.\n\nThe first 52 episodes of the dub aired on Adult Swim, the final 26 episodes premiered on DVD. The first two seasons, 26 episodes per season, have also been released on DVD. The blue logo and white font that was used throughout the series was first used by Vitello in 2002 and by Phuuz in 2003. Spanish and Indian dubs (which were not based on Vitello's and Phuuz's) also used the logo temporarily.\n\nFunimation actors[]\n\nLaura Bailey: Shinchan\n\nCynthia Cranz: Mitzi\n\nChuck Huber: Hiro\n\nColleen Clinkenbeard: Hima\n\nCarrie Savage: Penny\n\nBrina Palencia: Georgie\n\nChris Cason: Boo\n\nCaitlin Glass: Polly\n\nClarine Harp: Rachel\n\nJason Liebrecht: Ench\n\nTroy Baker: Action Bastard\n\nKate Oxley: Loli Pop\n\nFunimation names[]\n\nShinnosuke: Shinchan Nohara\n\nMisae: Mitzi Nohara\n\nHiroshi: Hiro Nohara\n\nHimawari: Hima Nohara\n\nShiro: Whitey\n\nNene: Penny Milfer\n\nKazama: Georgie Herbert Walker Prescott III\n\nMasao: Maso Sato\n\nBo: Boo\n\nMidori: Polly Anderson\n\nUme: Rachel Katz\n\nEnchou: Bernoulli Ench\n\nAction Kamen: Action Bastard\n\nMimiko: Loli Pop\n\nMrs. Sakurada: Patty Milfer\n\nMr. Sakurada: Bill Milfer\n\nMrs. Kazama: Barbara Walker\n\nKuroiso: Mr. K.\n\nFunimation DVDs[]\n\nEpisode list per part set[]\n\nCover Title Season 1, Part 1\n\nContains: Pee Strike!, To Be A Man, Safe as a Dry Hump, Get Your Hands Off My Happy Cake!, Gigantic One-Eyed Monster, Gum is a Good Food to Eat, A Mutha Fucking Bunny!, The Shin Must Poop On, Shady Real Estate Office, Ho!, Can't Abort Them When They're Not Yours, Irregular Tampons on Sale!, Get Yours, or Die, Swimming, Diving, and Scuba Team\n\nSeason 1, Part 2\n\nContains: More of a \"Snug\" than a \"Magmum\", In the Interest of Increased Ratings..., Sticky's My Favorite Flavor, OK, But I'm a Power Bottom, The Girls of 34C, The Herpes Effect, Gratuitous Child Nudity, At Least They Pay For The Ouchie, Damn You, Telepathy!, Your IQ's Like 10, Right?, Stop Referencing the Show!, Condescending Spanish for Heiresses, Gratuitous Grandparent Nudity\n\nSeason 2, Part 1\n\nContains: Shin Wars, The Stalker Song, Double Fried Flavor, Miscarriage Return Policy, Lucky Bastard Fever!, It's Actually Better For Anal, Tummy Clock Says It's Three, Green Like Good Boy Pills, AIDS is Hilarious, How To Bury a Smack-Addict Clown, The Emperor's Love, Her Little Gang-Bang Miracles, Childrens Were Our Future\n\nSeason 2, Part 2\n\nContains: Shin Chan: The High School Years, Tell the Cops She Looked Eighteen!, I Can't Find Your %*#&ing Legs, An Angel Gets Its Period, Unlicensed Therapy, A Total Jack Barnes Move, Gonna Need More Fingers, Sexy-A$$ Wild Fartin' Cowboy, Morning Vacuuming, Unfortunately for You, I Had Ribs, Domestic Abuse Isn't That Funny, Box for Hire?, The Epicish Battle Commenceth!\n\nSeason 3, Part 1\n\nContains: The After-Breakfast Enema, The Balls Have Left The Crotchy, Hecilopter Hurts My Brain Part, I Will Not Let You Hurt Hitler, Mockery Is So Coastal Elitist, Running Out Of Adult Diapers, Vaginoplasty and a Stepladder, Hold Still While I Glamour You, Food Sex Is Not Your Friend, The Boring Kind of Wet, The Upside of Prison Showers, One, Two, Bunny's Comin for You, Losing Your Three Card\n\nSeason 3, Part 2\n\nContains: If You Could Abort Obama, Would You?, A Blend of Nylon and Panda, Rubber Gutter Bumpers, Bind, Torture, Make Into Apple Dumplings, Tiny C*ck Ring (For Baby C*cks), Don't Mind the Damp Spot, Nork Humor, Tell the Stork to Give Me a Fetus, Monumental Douchebag, Hardcore Flirting, Meanwhile, On the Planet Niptune..., Two Corn Dogs at Once, This Show Just Jumped the Kappa\n\nTotal recap[]\n\nSeason 1 DVD releases[]\n\nSeason 1, Part 1 Set Details Special Features\n\n13 episodes\n\n2 disc set\n\n1.33:1 aspect ratio\n\nLanguages:\n\nEnglish\n\n\"From the Bowels of the Booth\", and 11-minute short featuring deleted scenes\n\nAudio commentary on Get Your Hands Off My Happy Cake!\n\nOriginal Japanese episode\n\nCast auditions\n\nOriginal storyboard\n\nTrailers\n\nRegion 1\n\nSeason 1, Part 2 Set Details Special Features\n\n13 episodes\n\n2 disc set\n\n1.33:1 aspect ratio\n\nLanguages:\n\nEnglish\n\nAudio commentary on OK, But I'm a Power Bottom\n\n\"From the Bowels of the Booth\"\n\nTrailers\n\nRegion 1\n\nSeason 2 DVD releases[]\n\nSeason 2, Part 1 Set Details Special Features\n\n13 episodes\n\n2 disc set\n\n1.33:1 aspect ratio\n\nLanguages:\n\nEnglish\n\nAudio commentary on \"The Stalker Song\"\n\n\"From the Bowels of the Booth\"\n\n\"Shin Wars\" storyboards\n\nKaraoke and Sing-along versions of \"Party!
