        "text": "The fourth-generation K-pop boy group \"Tomorrow by Together\" (TXT) will collaborate with the popular character \"Crayon Shin-chan.\"\n\nAccording to the agency Big Hit Music on the 21st, TOMORROW X TOGETHER will present a collaboration with \"Crayon Shin-chan\" titled \"Can't Stop.\"\n\nTOMORROW X TOGETHER will appear as a character in the special episode \"TOMORROW X TOGETHER is Here,\" which will air on Japanese TV Asahi on the 28th, and teach the choreography of the team's 5th mini-album \"Happy Pool (feat. Coi Lay)\" challenge to the Shin-chan family. This song is a song in which Yeonjun created the melody and all the members participated in the lyrics, adding to the speciality of the dance that will be on the air, especially because it is a section created by Yeonjun himself.\n\nThis episode will be aired in Korea later, and for this purpose, TOMORROW X TOGETHER recorded (dubbed) it in Korean and Japanese. TOMORROW X TOGETHER said, \"It was our first time recording an animation, and it was a fresh and special experience. It was really fun because it was a collaboration with Crayon Shin-chan that we used to see when we were young. In addition to animation, there are many things prepared. Please look forward to it,\" they asked.\n\nStarting with animation, TOMORROW X TOGETHER will conduct a wide range of collaborations based on artist IP (intellectual property rights) such as publishing, cartoons, and collaboration products. \"Crayon Shin-chan\" is Japan's longest-running TV series animation loved across generations for 31 years since its first airing in 1992, and has been exported to more than 40 countries and regions around the world, including Asia, Europe, and the United States.\n\nMeanwhile, TOMORROW X TOGETHER released its third full-length album 'The Name Chapter: FREEFALL' on the 13th. They will continue their activities by appearing on SBS TV's 'Inkigayo' on the 22nd.\n\nSource"
