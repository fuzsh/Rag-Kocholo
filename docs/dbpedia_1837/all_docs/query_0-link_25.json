        "text": "Shin megami tensei: Persona 4 or Persona 4 in the west is a Japanese turn based JRPG released in the year 2008 for the PlayStation 2 by Atlus, and eventually it got an enhanced version in 2012 named “Persona 4: Golden”, WARNING: this is going to contain big spoilers of the game and Chie’s Social link (This game is a work of art, PLS JUST PLAY THE GAME)\n\nThis time well be discussing one of the main cast and playable character, Chie Satonaka one of your classmates and the first who properly introduce herself to you, if you played the game (I INSIST sorry not sorry) you have used her in your party because she is the third character to join your party, but let’s introduce her again nonetheless.\n\nWho is Satonaka Chie?\n\nWhen describing Chie, first her color pallet is always tones of greens with yellow accents, she has short brown hair and there is an emphasis with her legs, because this is her weapon of choice, yes, while the other characters use sharp weapons, blunt objects, and a literal gun, Chie uses an arrangement of martial arts kicks.\n\nSecond, when talking about Satonaka-san, we can say that she has a notorious tomboyish personality which influences her general demeanor, of her personality traits we can tell she is positive, protective, brave, tenacious, easy going, and she is very straight forward person, but sometimes she can be insensitive, self-deprecating and usually her style of going head-first without a second thought puts herself in danger, and leads to disproportionate reactions when facing the actions of others. Her personal interests are action and kung-fu movies, Meat (her love for food and Meat specifically, awarded her the title of “The Carnivore Who’s Discarded Womanhood” nop I didn’t just invent that, if you played P4 arena u know) and working out.\n\nWhat is her Character arc like?\n\nChie struggles with low self-esteem because her general demeanor and attitude wasn’t like the stereotypical Japanese beauty. This leads to people always preferring her best friend Yukiko Amagi over her, the girls admired her, and the boys often talked to Chie just to get closer to Yukiko.\n\nChie and Yukiko are really close, they become inseparable at a young age, when Yukiko took home a homeless puppy her parents told her that she wouldn’t be allowed to keep it, so Chie tried to cheer her up, and ended up adopting her the dog. They constantly rely on each other and have probably the closest bond between party members, this is most notably seen at the moment in which Yukiko falls in Danger, and Chie is desperate to save her.\n\nWhen our protagonist arrives at town, and the cases of people been push on inside the TV world start, Yukiko becomes the third victim (kinda) our protagonists go to this world and enter the first dungeon Yukiko’s Castle (I am not explaining this in detail here for brevity) Chie even when she doesn’t have a persona, enters just to save her friend (or does she?). At the moment our heroes enter a room and hear Yumiko inner self talking about how worthless she feels, and how she needs Chie, and how she is jealous of Chie’s capabilities, The Shadow of Satonaka comes into the scene (Chie curiously, is the 2nd of 3 characters who doesn’t have their own dungeon). This shadow speaks of how the one who really needs Yukiko is Chie, the shadow go on of how pretty is Yukiko and how good it feels that someone like Yukiko is actually jealous of her, the dynamic between the two of them worked in a way that granted Chie this satisfaction, the shy Yukiko needed Chie to look the world outside. The shadow keeps talking about that this is the reason Chie needs Yukiko, to validate her, she does not feel worthy enough, she feels ashamed of her personality, of her looks, and the world’s most of the time give her reason to feel this way, through the smile she puts, she thinks if she protects people, they will need her, this is the reason (remember this is Shadow Chie talking) why she is afraid of losing Yukiko, this is where Chie snaps and the battle begins. After the battle, Chie accepts that this were part of her thoughts.\n\nIn Chie’s Social Link (SL), we learn about her and her insecurities, Chie gradually learns of not to be shy of who she is, that she is smarter and pretty that she think she is. Chie here confronts her relation with Yukiko, whereas long Yukiko depended on her, and recognized her, she wouldn’t be needed to change and grow, she vows to find what is good in her, and what is that makes her worth in her own eyes. Chie discovers that she in fact cannot stand seeing injustice and others in need, her desire of protecting was always honest, and she found that the strength to protect what’s dear to her, was already in her.\n\nLast notes and personal thoughts\n\nChie Satonaka, as her fellow teammates, is in the search of Truth, the discovery of one self-worth. One of the main appeals of Persona 4 is the way in which they make flawed characters, it humanizes them, it is common to sometimes feels that you are not enough, and people around you are so shiny compared to you, that it just validates you when they show that they need you, it isn’t a bad thing to help others, but emotional dependency is not a good thing, is a harmful behavior not just for you, but it can harm others. The story of Chie ends in a more open note compared to others of her friends, because one must never stop growing and learning about ourselves. How are you feeling right now is not who you are, there’s always a tomorrow, no matter how hard it looks like it, I think that Chie’s story try to convey this.\n\nHere is, again, Personally I will say that Chie reads as probably bisexual??(I think there is a giant gray area on this case) based on how she is a romantic interest to the player, how in one SL appeared a boy who Chie hints she was interested, but even considering the obvious emotional dependency between Chie and Yukiko their interaction to me reads as a little more than just close friends.\n\nHowever, thanks if you really read all of this.\n\n-Jorge Baquedano\n\nI remember watching Howl’s Moving Castle for the first time at a very young age (my father raised me and my brother watching Ghibli’s films religiously) and immediately feeling some kind of understanding of the character in a way I’ve never did before. I have struggled with emotional disregulation all my life, being called dramatic and even hysterical since I was a child. So, the first time I saw Howl having the “temper tantrum” moment over a small inconvenience was something that made me think “he’s like me” really quickly. Obviously, as an eight year old, the thought wasn’t really developed much further, and my attention was more drawn to the beautiful scenery and this idea of everlasting love that many young girls dream about. However, as I grew up re watching the film over and over again, things started to click.\n\nThe first time I received a pre diagnosis for BPD I was around 14 years old, although my first official diagnosis wasn’t until I was 19, since you can’t be diagnosed with a personality disorder before you are an adult.\n\nAccording to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), Borderline Personality Disorder is a a “pervasive pattern of instability of interpersonal relationships, self-image, and affects, and marked impulsivity, beginning in early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts”. To receive a diagnosis, one should typically meet at least five out of nine symptoms.\n\nCluster B personality disorders are some of the most stigmatized mental illnesses, especially by their depictions in popular media. You get characters that fall under the “unstable villain” category, or somewhere closer to the “manic pixie dream girl” trope, both harmful stereotypes that affect the way people perceive patients that have BPD. One should also take into account that mental health issues are just starting to become more normalized topics of discussion, so most people in the past only had films and TV shows to form a mental image of what mental disorders look like in real life.\n\nPlease note that further on, I will be discussing mostly headcanons, as this character has never been confirmed to be neurodivergent and probably never will. So, this is just my opinion as an anime fan and a person with BPD, and you’re totally entitled to disagreeing with me.\n\nGoing back to my personal experience, I remember watching the film in 2019, shortly after receiving my official BPD diagnosis, so the topic was really present in my mind at the time. I found that the way I related to this character was heavily linked with his emotional complexities, but I also felt a sense of comfort by watching him develop as a human being in a supportive environment. I quickly realized that the thing that made Howl different from other characters I related to was, precisely, that he was mostly presented in a really positive light. He was, after all, charming, loving and protective of his found family. He was complex and nuanced, but genuinely loved as well. This solidified him as one of my all time favorite characters, and now I’d like to discuss his personality traits linked to BPD criteria.\n\nChronic feelings of emptiness.\n\nHowl exhibits this one frequently during the film. From his constant questioning about his role in the war that he’s forced to participate in, to the depressive-like state in which he is portrayed while laying in his bedroom, with Sophie trying to get him out of bed. A lot of people with this disorder often feel like life has no inherent meaning when they’re not engaged in risky behavior, not being able to really explain the source of this lethargy that prevents them from doing things or even be excited about daily life events. This emptiness comes from deep within and can be the reason why they seek filling the void with all sort of what could be considered as harmful behavior patterns.\n\nFeelings of dissociation, such as feeling cut off from oneself, observing oneself from outside one’s body, or feelings of unreality. Transient, stress-related paranoid idealization or severe dissociative symptoms.\n\nSomewhat linked to the first symptom, Howl does fluctuate between complete disconnection from himself and his body, and high paranoia about losing himself to the horrors of war, and also being harmed by the queen and her curse. This might be a reach, but I also see it in the way his heart is physically separate from his body in the form of Calcifer. One can feel as if their emotions are so out of control that they seem to be someone else’s, or that they act separately from one’s will. This dissociative state also prevents patients from actually realizing how harmful their decisions and actions can actually be.\n\nEmotional instability in reaction to day-to-day events (e.g., intense episodic sadness, irritability, or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days).\n\nThis is one of the most obvious throughout the film. He can appear completely numb in one scene, then frantic in the next one, then happy and loving towards others, then enraged. As emotional disregulation happens very often to people with BPD, these intense and changing emotions drains us of our energy, and is extremely hard to manage without proper medical aid such as behavioral therapy. Some people do look at some sort of bright side of this experience, where we feel happiness and joy just as profoundly as other emotions.\n\nFrantic efforts to avoid real or perceived abandonment, such as plunging headfirst into relationships—or ending them just as quickly.\n\nThis one doesn’t need a lot of explaining. Howl constantly seeks Sophie’s reassurance and is totally willing to change his lifestyle and his home just to make her comfortable enough so she doesn’t leave. This can come across as sweet, genuine displays of his love for her, but in real life, a person with BPD can lose themselves in the process of avoiding their loved ones leaving. The constant gifts and changes with only Sophie’s well being in mind wouldn’t be sustainable in a world without Howl’s magical powers, after all.\n\nIdentity disturbance with markedly or persistently unstable self-image or sense of self.\n\nHere we have the iconic green slime meltdown scene. He, quite literally, cannot cope with the idea of his hair changing without his control. This comes across as his vanity coming to life, but I feel like there’s a deeper sense to it. When he says he sees “no point in living if he can’t be beautiful” he means it: he has built a great part of his identity around being perceived as pretty. This is really common among people with BPD, where the lack of a stability in identity can be overcompensated via physical appearance and presenting oneself as desirable. He acts like the world is ending because for him it is, not because he cares more about his looks than anything else.\n\nImpulsive behavior in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging (e.g., spending, sex, substance abuse, reckless driving, binge eating).\n\nRecurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, threats, or self-harming behavior.\n\nI’m including this two symptoms together because the way they’re portrayed overlaps a lot. The way Howl acts around participating in the war comes across as just a way to endanger himself, as he explicitly says that he’s not interested in the political implications of the conflict. However he keeps going into battle, transformed into the monster-like shape which Calcifer keeps pointing out as dangerous and that it could be potentially irreversible. His sense of duty towards a country is also absent (he, quite literally, plays a part in both sides) so one can only speculate what are his true motives to expose himself to deathly situations. To me, it is just the idea of danger that is appealing, these impulses to self harm whenever the opportunity arises.\n\nInappropriate, intense anger or difficulty controlling anger (e.g., frequent displays of temper, constant anger, recurrent physical fights).\n\nThis one I also see in his monster shape: full of wrath and estrangement from everything he holds dear. When the transformation is complete, he’s no longer himself, just a terrifying form of anger. People with BPD sometimes do feel like their emotions, especially rage, makes them a completely different person, harmful to themselves and others as well.\n\nA pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by extremes between idealization and devaluation (also known as “splitting”).\n\nFor this one, you have to read a bit between the lines. At the start of the film, Sophie talks with her sister about Howl and his desire to “eat beautiful women’s hearts”. A lot of people with BPD jump from one relationship right into a new one, partly because of this seeking of filling the emotional void they feel, partly because of their impulsiveness. Earliest versions of the DSM referred to this as being promiscuous, and although this can have quite misogynistic undertones (as a majority of people diagnosed with BPD are women or assigned female at birth), risky sexual behavior is also a part of the symptoms that can be present in the disorder. Of course, this film is rated PG and I’m only analyzing the character through my own experience with the disorder, but this is a subtextual hint that I can see.\n\nEven though the following two topics aren’t considered diagnostic criteria, it seems important to mention them as they are commonly shared experiences among people with BPD.\n\nFirst, a complex relationship with family and the idea of it. People with BPD often grow up in dysfunctional or hostile environments, one of the speculated causes of the disorder. As they navigate towards adulthood, the once neglected or abused child develops somewhat of a mixed-feelings type of relationship with families, some of us reject the concept as it brings up painful memories, and some of us become especially protective of or likely to “adopt” vulnerable children in our environments, as we see ourselves in them, and we’re offered the chance to be the adult we needed but didn’t have.\n\nWe know that Howl comes from a background that is, to say the least, neglectful. He raises himself in his uncle’s cottage, and then he’s placed under Madame Sulliman’s care, a woman that is exploitative towards him in many ways. We know little else about his family background, at least in the film. However, as he becomes an adult, he quite literally adopts Markl, a young boy, as his apprentice. Towards the ending of the film we see that they have a bond that can only be described as familiar, he’s protective towards Mark, and in the final scenes we see the characters acting like a happy family. This is one of the more positive aspects that can stem from the disorder, and that the film portrays in a really positive, wholesome way.\n\nSecond, the concept of a “favorite person” or FP. A FP is a person who someone with BPD relies heavily on for emotional support, seeks attention and validation from, and looks up to or idealizes. This is very different from having a best friend or a partner you love deeply, as FPs become the center of the person’s life and directly influences their mood, their behavior, even their sense of self. One feels as if they simply cannot live without this person, not in the romantic sense, but quite literally. This leads to an intensification of symptoms such as impulsive behavior and fear of abandonment.\n\nSophie is, by all means, Howl’s favorite person. Taking the whole time travel trope aside, he falls really quickly and deeply for her, and as I’ve mentioned before, changes his whole perspective in life because of this love. He tells her that the new most important thing in the world for him is now to protect her, and goes to war a last time just to fulfill this purpose. Sophie also has the ability to directly influence Howl’s mood in a way no other character can. The important detail to note here is that, where this can be a toxic or obsessive behavior pattern to people with unmanaged BPD, here Howl learns how to navigate this newly found love and all his other emotions in a healthy way, after his heart is back on his chest. This is not automatic, he expresses the burden of this new heart, but he will gradually become accustomed to it, and this leaves you with the feeling that he’s actually growing and evolving as a character, rather than things magically solving themselves when the star-crossed lovers get together.\n\nSo, why does any of this matter? Well, to me it does because of a few reasons. But this is the main one: I’m not the only person that has noticed this similarities between Howl’s character arc and this disorder. Many neurodivergent and mentally ill people tend to look at characters that act similarly to them and think to themselves “hey, that’s me”. This innocent gesture of identifying oneself in media is really common, but for groups of people that are often marginalized, stigmatized or isolated, it becomes a sort of coping mechanism. Our experiences don’t appear in your regular happy coming of age film, and we’re too often forced to identify with either the villain or the really, really morally questionable characters. So, to see yourself in a character that is as loved as Howl (one of the anime community’s official heartthrobs) can be really healing. After all, he’s one of the good guys, and he gets his happy ending.\n\nTo conclude, I really recommend you go watch this film if you haven’t already, and if you happen to watch it again in the future after you read this post, I hope I was able to give you a new perspective.\n\nSources used in this post:\n\nhttps://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/borderline-personality-disorder#:~:text=A%20pattern%20of%20intense%20and,reckless%20driving%2C%20and%20binge%20eating.\n\nhttps://www.borderlinepersonalitydisorder.org/what-is-bpd/bpd-overview/\n\nhttps://www.theravive.com/therapedia/borderline-personality-disorder-dsm–5-301.83-(f60.3)#:~:text=The%20DSM%2D5%20describes%20Borderline,American%20Psychiatric%20Association%2C%202013).\n\nhttps://www.nhs.uk/mental-health/conditions/borderline-personality-disorder/symptoms/\n\nhttps://www.verywellmind.com/borderline-personality-disorder-diagnosis-42517\n\nMelián Trujillo.\n\nBy the time, I had already seen a crazy amount of anime. However, it was not until I saw Bakuman that I realized the existence of a (sub)genre that, without knowing it, had caught my attention: the non-battle-battle series.\n\nIn short, they are series where the characters battle, fight among themselves, but they don’t actually fight. Not physically at least, but mentally. C’mon, let’s just look at the non-battle-battle anime par excellence: Death Note. Yeah, that sums it up pretty well, doesn’t it? A psychological battle, a real “battle of the wits”, where words are heavier than any punch and the one that’s impacted is not the body, but the mind. From Kaiji to Kaguya-Sama. Kakegurui, Tomodachi Game, Classroom of the Elite and even Dr. Stone.\n\nMy young self didn’t make the connection, but now I see that what attracted me to these stories was what I call “mental chess”. Shakespeare already said it: “All the world’s a stage.” “But the play is badly cast,” added Oscar Wilde. Personally, I stick with the first quote. The world is a stage, we all act and wear masks. Masks that protect us or protect others, that isolate us, hurt us, give us a role to play, connect us and allow us to live in society. And yet… it is so difficult to understand people, and even more difficult to connect with the unknown, with someone who is unknown to you (even yourself).\n\nMaybe that’s why I liked “puppeteer” characters so much, manipulators if you will. Those who seem to have understood the rules of society’s game, who know how to wear their masks without dying in the attempt. It is here, among all the mental chess players, that my favorite appears: Lelouch.\n\nI know, I’m cheating. Code Geass (Death Note’s rival due to various similarities) is not exactly a non-battle anime. It has brutal combats between mechas, with guns and explosions. However, to me that has always been the least interesting (and important) part of Code Geass. Because ultimately, it’s a series about mental battles, psychology, strategy, politics and morality. All elements where masks are crucial, and above all, heavy.\n\nBecause, while Kira feels flat, lacking the passions, dilemmas, and contradictions of the human condition (treating his “Light” mask as a mere decoration, a costume that you put on and take off with ease), the masks Lelouch uses have real weight. Lelouch Lamperouge, Zero, and Lelouch vi Britannia. Those are the 3 masks that he shows during the series. One is a simple student of Britannia, another a rebel against the empire, and the last, a prince of the imperial royal family. He reminds me a lot of the Japanese proverb of the 3 masks: “Every person has three faces. The first face is the one you show to the world, the second face is the one you show to your close friends and family. The third face is the one you never show to anyone, that is the faithful reflection of what you really are”. In the series, how different they can be (and who you show these masks to) can be seen in the love interests. Shirley loves Lelouch Lamperouge, Kallen loves Zero, and CC loves Lelouch vi Britannia.\n\nIn fact, those masks, those “lies” are the center of the conflict. When the protagonist confronts his father, Charles, he reproaches him for how he has always hidden behind masks, behind lies. For him, the whole world is full of lies and that’s why he plans to destroy them. He wants to modify the fabric of reality to destroy the barriers that separate all beings. Mashing every person together into a single entity. A single consciousness embodying all of humanity. Basically his own version of the Human Instrumentality Project from Evangelion. He believes that humanity is actually one being, that people are fundamentally the same, and that the only way to stop the world from lying is to destroy the greatest lie itself: the lie of separation.\n\nAnd so, masks are present in one way or another in this type of series, even in its most everyday expression such as Kaguya-Sama, where the protagonists use these masks to project an image to others while protecting themselves from their own insecurities.\n\nTo a greater or lesser extent, this type of series shaped me as a person. For much of my life I considered myself a mental chess player, someone who overthought interactions with others, who was relentless in hiding facets of himself, and yet was confused in this game of masks. Who is the real me? Who are the real others? Do we live deceiving ourselves? Why? Is it even possible to connect this way? But eventually I learned to accept the masks, I managed to be at peace with them, and above all, I learned to appreciate people. Because in my experience, every aspect of a person can contain genuine and immeasurable beauty, and as such, it is a treasure that should not be underestimated. Accepting the truth within lies and lies within truth. Ultimately, being honest with that should be enough.\n\nRaimundo Gumucio"
