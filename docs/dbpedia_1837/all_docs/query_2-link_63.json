        "text": "Reviews\n\n“Shin-chan: Me and the Professor on Summer Vacation -The Endless Seven-Day Journey- is a refreshing adventure seen through the eyes of a 5-year-old with an incredibly active imagination. Be it normal interactions with family or friends or some of the wackier story elements further in, there is enough to keep any player satisfied. If you’re looking to escape on a whimsical trip, Shin-chan: Me and the Professor on Summer Vacation -The Endless Seven-Day Journey- is a fantastic choice.”\n\n9/10 – But Why Tho?\n\n“Apart from mashing together two classic Japanese IPs, Shin chan: The Endless Seven-Day Journey mashes together some quite contradictory concepts and comes up with something special. You have the directionless, simple adventures of a child’s curiosity on a rural holiday, but they’re interrupted quite suddenly by a tightly directed (and completely absurd) plot. Wacky sitcom energy quickly becomes the drive and purpose in a game that could have been merely a wholesome meander-em-up. So there is the soothing magic of endless days running round fields and just seeing what catches the imagination, but also a heavy steer to play a story from end to end, packaging the never-ending summer into a punchy and dynamic 15-20 hours. Knowing now what Kureshin and Bokunatsu are, if you think you like the idea of mixing the two, this game is very easy to recommend.”\n\n8/10 – Nintendo Life\n\n“Fans of Shin-chan, Bokunatsu, Attack of the Friday Monsters, or those who just enjoy a bit of slow-life low-pressure adventure will likely appreciate Shin chan: Me and the Professor on Summer Vacation. It could be a little fuller, and I don’t know how to feel about how it wraps up its story, but it’s unique, silly, and nostalgic in all the right ways.”\n\n8/10 – TouchArcade"
