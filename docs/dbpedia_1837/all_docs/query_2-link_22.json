Shin-chan is a 5 years old boy that disturbs every one, he's obviously and logically childish, he's pervert, addicted to television, his mother is really incredible to stand this impossibly irritating little boy. The show is full of under-the-belt jokes as well as troubles between adults because of Shin's way ... of telling stories to others et cetera.\n\nIt's simple fun, and manages to stay fun. It is a long-running anime full of fun.\n\nNote for those who read the manga but hadn't seen the anime, they are totally similar.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 8\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nIt slightly saddens me that Crayon Shin-Chan does not get very many reviews because this is my childhood ( although this series is quite inappropriate for young children in certain aspects... ). And many people in the American community think it's stupid ( which isn't wrong, because there are rather... strange parts to this series that just makes this \"Crayon Shin-Chan\" ).\n\nHowever, there is a strange charm to this series which drag the audience in. It merely seems like a weird children's show at first glance, but it is actually an adult show with many adult-targeted humor. However, there are still an aspect of childhood ... innocence left in certain ways. Either way, it can be a light show for pretty much any range. Even without being able to relate to adult humor, Crayon Shin-chan is hilarious within itself. The characters are all very unique, and all deeply plotted.\n\nAlso, the movies are something to take note of. The Shin-chan movies are focused on the fantasy adventure aspect of the series which is not very often encountered in the original series, creating that excitement out of the everyday life humor. Nevertheless, many of them also show a heartwarming connection within the Nohara family and often brings me to a gross sobbing. The movies seems to fill in the lack of excitement and portrayal of touching feelings in the original series.\n\nDespite its weirdness and occasional fantasy aspect, I find this series very down to earth. The characters are not perfect or \"cool\", and they are very human. But when watching the movies, it feels as if I'm watching Gintama, another random comedy which hints at the touching back story of the characters from time to time.\n\nOverall, I personally enjoy Crayon Shin-chan any day, and feel like it is something anyone can really get into when watching it alongside of the movies.\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nThis is by far one of the most fun special anime show,it doesn't feature the kind of a story and animation you usually see in other anime shows, even tho the story is repetitive, and it might seem that the subject is mostly about a 5-year-old showing his buttocks to everybody, it isn't that way, it has it's own humour, slapstick jokes, and antics from a quirky little boy who can twist and turn any other's opinions and make them say what they don't intend to. Shin-Chan doesn't seem to behave even after his mother, Misae, spanks his behind and stretches his cheeks at a ... daily basis, which makes this anime even more fun, he also has some moments where his sensitive nature reveals, of course, not missing his silly remarks in the end.\n\nCould have been rated to 10 if the animation would be better at times ^_^\n\nIf you are interested about this anime show, see my fansub group (the link is in my profile~)\n\nReviewer’s Rating: 9\n\nWhat did you think of this review?\n\nNice 0\n\nLove it 0\n\nFunny 0\n\nConfusing 0\n\nInformative 0\n\nWell-written 0\n\nCreative 0\n\nShow all\n\nInterest Stacks\n\nRecommendations\n\nRecent News\n\nNew Author To Succeed to Crayon Shin-chan Manga\n\nAccording to Nikkan Sports, the serialization of manga Crayon Shin-chan will be resumed next summer.
