        "text": "Summary\n\nShin’s pet dog, Shiro, may look normal but he’s actually a superhero who protects the world.\n\nThe enduringly popular Japanese cartoon franchise “Crayon Shin-chan” has inspired a new animated TV series, “Super Shiro.” “Crayon Shin-chan” has been on air since 1992 and inspired 26 feature films.\n\n“Super Shiro” is a fast-paced chase series, for kids, based on original IP by Yoshito Usui and scripted by on Kimiko Ueno. The series is to be directed by Tomohisa Shimoyama, with Masaaki Yuasa as executive director.\n\nIt will be produced by Shin-ei Animation, known for both “Doraemon” and “Crayon Shin Chan,” and Science Saru, a Tokyo-based animation studio.The series is backed by Turner Asia Pacific and TV Asahi. Their partnership was announced last week at the Kidscreen Summit conference in Miami. The agreement includes broadcast rights across Asia Pacific (ex-China). This is the first regional deal between the two parties and includes “a sizeable investment” from Turner.\n\nTags : SUPER SHIRO anime, Watch SUPER SHIRO, Watch SUPER SHIRO Online, Watch SUPER SHIRO English Sub, Download SUPER SHIRO English Sub, Stream SUPER SHIRO, SUPER SHIRO English Sub, SUPER SHIRO Episode 1 , SUPER SHIRO Anime Free English Sub, Watch SUPER SHIRO Ep 1, Watch SUPER SHIRO, Watch SUPER SHIRO Crunchyroll, Watch SUPER SHIRO funimation,\n\nLink Click S2 – Shiguang Dailiren 2Link Click Season 2 , Link Click 2nd Season , 时光代理人 第二季 , Shiguang Dailiren II Link Click Season 2\n\nCurrently viewing: 14744\n\nSecond season of Shiguang Dailiren. It appears that Link Click season 2 will lose the episodic nature of its previous season. For half of the show, it followed Cheng Xiaoshi and Lu Guang solving their clients’ cases, with some hints here and there of the broader story. However, it looks like season 2 will revolve almost entirely around the red-eyed culprit...\n\nRating IMDb: 7.50 (15 users) Thanks to: Support"
