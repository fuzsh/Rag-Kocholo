        "text": "n. Home\n\nI was watching Crayon Shin-chan yesterday.\n\nIn the episode, Shin-chan switched on the lighter when his house was filled with gas, and BOOM!\n\nThe house exploded. Because this is an anime, the human beings were fine, but the house was totaled.\n\nIn the scene above, Shin’s dad is crying over the lost house, all the memories he had with his family — playing with his kids, bathing them, eating together as a family, sleeping together in the common bedroom — and also crying for the even longer road of paying off the housing loan he has ahead of him. They only had the house for 3 years, and there are still 32 more years of housing loan to be paid, on top of the repair fees for the house.\n\nTough life.\n\nLife is hard for the poor and salaried class.\n\nBesides that, I also see how the house had provided security and comfort by watching how they have to hole up at their neighbour’s house and their desperate search for a new temporary place. I see how having a nice place to stay in is a blessing too, from how their new place is small and cramp and old and not as good as their previous house. Although having even a small and cramp house provides that feeling of comfort and safety compared to not having a house at all.\n\nHaving a place to call one’s own is really important, psychologically. I remember feeling extremely happy at having my own room during my Japan trip, because I had thought that I will be living in a dorm. Instead, I get my own room with my own bed, desk, closet and clothing rack. I was overjoyed, and I loved hanging out in my room, and I loved having a place to go back to after a long day.\n\nI love my room in Singapore too, and my house as well. No matter what shitty happens outside of home, home is a place where I can totally relax when I get back. I would throw everything down, change into comfortable clothes, and lounge on the sofa.\n\nHome is bliss.\n\nHome is also where you get to feel the best Chrysalism – that feeling of amniotic tranquility of being indoors during a thunderstorm.\n\nThat feeling of being protected from the elements, and also from everything else.\n\nAnd these brought my thoughts to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs.\n\nMaslow’s theory is illustrated in the pyramidal model below:\n\nThe most basic interpretation of his theory is that human beings have basic needs, and we will be driven to fulfill them. The lower level needs have to be satisfied first before moving onto the higher order needs.\n\nSo in essence, physiological needs is the most important, and if a person is hungry it will be hard to care about anything else. Satisfying the hunger comes first. Of course, it is not as simple as that and I’m sure you can think of many exceptions, but the basic idea is that.\n\nHousing falls under the safety goal (second tier from the bottom), although it provides much more than that — it also provides drinkable water, food, a place to sleep, a place for family. It is a place that allows the fundamental needs to be satisfied so that a person can move on to the higher order needs of self-esteem and self-actualization.\n\nSo in a sense, housing should be a basic human right.\n\nAlthough many still don’t have one. Especially in disaster places. And refugees.\n\nAnd now my thoughts go in another direction. Are there some people who do not need homes? Perhaps due to their extraordinary capabilities?\n\nPerson in mind — Jack Reacher, ex-military police, now with a sense of justice.\n\nI’m reading 61 Hours, book #i-do-not-know of the Jack Reacher series. The action is good, very fast pace, and the dialogue is good too. The traditional Chinese lettering makes it a bit harder to read, but can’t complain since I don’t see the English version of this title lying around in the library. Perks of being bilingual hahaha.\n\nSo anyways, back to Reacher. Does he not need a home perhaps? He doesn’t like owning a home. He does not want to be tied down. But then again, people like him are very very rare. And he is a fictional character. And according to Lee Child (the author): “I thought that I would do a book that’s not the same as everybody else’s. Everybody else had their guy working: a private guy in Boston or a police lieutenant in L.A., or wherever. I thought, ‘Well, he won’t be working, and he won’t live anywhere, and let’s just take it from there.’”.\n\nSo I guess most people do need a roof over their heads.\n\nI definitely need a roof over my head. Even when travelling. Preferably a secure one, even though I would not mind going budget.\n\nAnyway, a few more takeaways I have from watching the series are\n\nHappiness is in the little things\n\nScarcity makes things more valuable\n\nThe life depicted in Crayon Shin-chan is very simple, but it seems very blissful. 每天就快快乐乐平平淡淡地过日子，内子负责家里事务，老公就努力做工赚钱。虽然薪水不多，但妻子也很会理财，点算着用。\n\n不富裕，但也很幸福。\n\n(Note: The above are Chinese words. Just had a mood to write these words, but the understanding of this article will not be affected even if you skip them, as the paragraph below is a paraphrase.)\n\nLooking at Shin-chan and his family, and them being happy at the simple joys of life – of eating dinner together, of bathing and playing with the kids, of chilling on the weekends, I see their joy despite the mundane-ness of it all. And even though they are not rich, even though they still have 32 more years of housing loan to pay, they still are happy. Of course, they sometimes take it for granted and didn’t realised it either, until something big happens — such as the lost of their house — and then they realised that actually, they had many many happy moments in the past. But still, even in their new, smaller house, they are happy, at the simple things in life.\n\nVery often it is only when things are lost, only when there is the contrast do we realise the importance of something. Only when it comes to crunch time do we realise how important things are to us, and how good it has been.\n\nWhich brings me to my second point: when there is scarcity, there is a bigger contrast between the periods of have and have-not. That contrast can let us see the value of things, it can help us discover what is truly important to us.\n\n短暂的幸福是最可贵的。\n\nTranslation: The fleeting happiness is the best.\n\nI’ve realised that.\n\nBecause you only have 1 hours of free time, as compared to 1 whole day of free time, that 1 hour is more precious.\n\nBecause you spent so long saving up for that dream item you want, it is more precious.\n\nBecause you are so hungry, that bite of bread is heavenly.\n\nContrast can help us see. Experiencing both ends of the spectrum gives us clearer sight.\n\nHave you heard of that method that appears quite often in self-help books?\n\nImagine your funeral.\n\nImagine you only have one year to live.\n\nWhat do you want to do? What legacy do you want to leave behind?\n\nThey use the principle of crunch time, of scarcity. When time is limited, what is the most important thing to you?\n\nThink about that, and whatever you think it is, spend the rest of your life doing it.\n\nTHAT is what you should be doing.\n\nBe it to love your love ones as fiercely as you can, solve world poverty, become president, become a chef, become a driver.\n\nWhatever brings you joy; REAL joy, not that surge of dopamine as you click on that new notification or email. Discover it, and then\n\nGo live your life."
