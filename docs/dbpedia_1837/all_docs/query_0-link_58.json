        "text": "Synopsis: As teenagers, Yae Noguchi and Harumichi Namiki would avidly talk to each other about their dreams and plans for the future. Fast forward a few years and these once bright-eyed and bushy-tailed ‘90s kids have grown into full-fledged adults whose lives are a little different from the ones they imagined having.\n\nYae’s plans for a career as a jet-setting flight attendant get upturned after she suffers an accident and Harumichi, who grew up wanting to be a pilot, ends up quitting his job in the Japan Air Self-Defense Force to pursue a different path. As Yae and Harumichi think about where to go next in life, they can’t help but look back on their first relationship with each other when they were young, naive and full of aspirations.\n\nOverview: We’re used to seeing new shows and movies that have come from popular books or manga, but this new Netflix original series is unique in that it’s inspired by two songs – ‘First Love’ and ‘Hatsukoi’ – from Japanese pop icon Hikaru Utada. Like the two hit singles, which were released in 1999 and 2018 respectively, this love story starring Hikari Mitsushima and Takeru Satoh is a wistful, heart-tugging saga spanning three decades from the late 90s to now.\n\nSynopsis: Two modern teenagers leave their hometown in Aomori prefecture and move to Kyoto to chase their dreams of becoming maiko (apprentice geisha). Though Sumire thrives in her traditional Japanese dance classes, her childhood friend Kiyo struggles to keep up with her training and is frequently chastised by her teachers. Discouraged by her inability to perform like Sumire, a crestfallen Kiyo contemplates abandoning her dreams and leaving the maiko house, but soon finds purpose in cooking elaborate meals for her fellow housemates.\n\nOverview: Closed to outsiders, the coveted world of maiko and geiko (the Kyoto term for geisha) is shrouded in intrigue and mystery. In this charming series directed by master storyteller Hirokazu Kore-eda, however, viewers worldwide can get a glimpse into the everyday life and customs observed in a maiko house in modern-day Kyoto. Nana Mori plays the part of Kiyo, while Natsuki Deguchi takes the role of Sumire in this inspiring series about forging your own path in life and delicious home cooking.\n\nSynopsis: After a series of personal and professional setbacks, including an unexpected breakup with her boyfriend of over six years, Haru decides to embark on a new chapter in her life. She lands a job at the front desk of an unusual tropical resort catering to Pokémon who need to rest and recuperate after a long season of battles and training. This role, while slightly chaotic, proves to be far more fun and gratifying than she ever imagined.\n\nOverview: This charming new stop-motion animation diverges from the typical battle-centric theme of the Pokémon franchise, focusing instead on a tranquil haven for its hard-working characters to unwind. Tailored for everyone from toddlers to adults who grew up watching Pokémon, the series is light in complexity but crafted with evident love and care.\n\nSynopsis: In a dystopian future, a street kid called David Martinez is fighting to escape from a technological society marred by corruption and an obsession with cybernetic body modifications. In an attempt to take control of his destiny, David retreats to the fringes of the city and joins a faction of cyberpunk outlaws known as edgerunners.\n\nOverview: From Studio Trigger comes a brand new standalone anime series based on the 'Cyberpunk 2077' comics. The series is decidedly NSFW. The adrenaline-filled trailer alone is chock full of gun fights, gore and eroticism, but the psychedelic neon imagery combined with no-holds-barred character depictions has us hooked.\n\nSynopsis: After leaving her job as a sex worker, a young woman named Chihiro decides to make a living by selling bento boxes in a small seaside town. Chihiro, who is unapologetically herself, initially comes across as a little unusual to some of the local residents, but makes a lasting impression on everyone who buys bentos from her.\n\nOverview:Adapted from the popular manga 'Chihiro-san', this feature co-produced by Netflix and Asmik Ace made its world premiere on Netflix in February 2023. The film stars Kasumi Arimura as Chihiro and is directed by Rikiya Imaizumi ('By the Window'), who is regarded as one of the most influential filmmakers of his generation.\n\nSynopsis:This series documents the captivating journey of preschoolers on their first outing without a parent or guardian to guide them. For their maiden solo adventure, the barely waist-high youngsters are given a short list of errands to run by their mothers, which would take an ordinary adult half an hour to complete. For these plucky youngsters, however, picking up a couple of things at the local corner shop proves to be a daunting mission that can quickly turn into a tailspin adventure.\n\nOverview: Japan has a society where it's common for young children to take public transport to school without being accompanied by a teacher or guardian, so the country's adolescents are admirably independent. Of course, it’s always nerve wracking to send your child off into the world where they could get up to virtually anything.\n\nSynopsis: Two 20-year-old women called Nana Osaki and Nana Komatsu meet for the first time on a bullet train to Tokyo. While they have the same name, the pair couldn’t be more different in their personalities. The excitable Nana Osaki is a bubbly character who envisions moving in with her boyfriend in the city and living happily ever after, while tomboy Nana Komtasu is a calm and collected musician with big aspirations for her rock band.\n\nDespite being polar opposites, the two Nanas become friends based on their mutual ambition of forging their own paths to happiness in a big city and support each other through heartbreak, workplace challenges and wardrobe malfunctions.\n\nOverview: This 2000s anime is based on the eponymous manga series by Ai Yazawa. Though it's been almost two decades since the series was released, this touching and brilliantly executed story continues to enrapture audiences with the amusing contrast of its two protagonists and a narrative that millions of twenty-somethings can strongly relate to.\n\nSynopsis: Akio is perplexed when his hardworking father Hakutaro suddenly decides to quit his desk job one day without any explanation. As Hakutaro was usually preoccupied with work for most of Akio’s life, the father and son duo never had much time to spend with each other.\n\nIn an effort to get to know his father and understand him better, Akio re-introduces his father to Final Fantasy – a video game the pair once bonded over when Akio was just a young boy. Now that he doesn’t have the job eating into his free time, Hakutaro finds himself becoming increasingly invested in the game. Meanwhile, Akio has been secretly logging onto the game as an anonymous player to get his father to open up to him through an RPG.\n\nOverview: This criminally underrated gem, based on a true story, is divided into a mini-series of eight episodes. Starring Ren Osugi as Hakutaro and Yudai Chiba as Akio, it will have you reaching for tissues and contemplating picking up the latest edition of Final Fantasy.\n\nSynopsis: Tattoo-clad mafia boss Tatsu has abandoned his position in the yakuza to become a full-time homemaker. While other members of the yakuza still talk about Tatsu’s fearsome disposition that earned him the nickname ‘Immortal Dragon’, Tatsu now spends all his energy going on grocery runs and crafting cutesy bento to please his beloved career wife, Miku.\n\nOverview: We first fell in love with the slick-haired Tatsu in the original manga series, but now the unconventional home life of an ex-yakuza boss has been turned into an anime. While fans were dubious as to whether the small-screen adaptation would have the same weight as its source material, the show reveals that the strong cast of voice actors including Kenjiro Tsuda (‘One Punch Man’) and Shizuka Ito (‘Nodame Cantabile’) are more than capable of putting on a delightfully funny and touching performance that's sure to appease all the skeptics.\n\nSynopsis: In this bite-sized series, a professional voice actor takes advantage of his downtime to tackle various chores around the house. With kitchen knives to sharpen, freshly washed linen to hang and scuffed baseballs to polish, he finds unconventional ways to approach everyday tasks.\n\nOverview: If you liked ‘The Way of the Househusband’, you'll love these live-action five-minute episodes starring voice actor Kenjiro Tsuda, the man behind the main character Tatsu in the anime. In this series that is part performance art, part how-to guide on polishing mirrors and making udon, we see a glimpse of how Tsuda goes about his everyday routine when he’s not in the recording studio.\n\nSynopsis: The film is about a group of children who decide to explore an abandoned residential building and accidentally find themselves in a strange new reality where they are stranded in the middle of the ocean. With no adults to save them, the friends gather their courage to work together as they brave choppy waves and look for a way to get back to their normal world.\n\nOverview: Directed by Hiroyasu Ishida, ‘Drifting Home’ is the third full-length film to come from Studio Colorido, which was also behind the anime adaptation of ‘Penguin Highway’ and Mari Okada’s 2020 film ‘A Whisker Away’.\n\nSynopsis: Gudetama is a lazy egg who feels untroubled by the prospect of ending up on someone’s plate and is happy to spend the rest of their existence lounging around, doing nothing in particular. Gudetama’s hatchling companion Shakipiyo, on the other hand, is determined to take control of their fate and leave the fridge in search of something more meaningful. Together, Shakipiyo and the reluctant Gudetama set out on a quest around Tokyo to find their mother, meeting an eccentric band of characters along the way.\n\nOverview:When Sanrio first introduced the world to Gudetama in 2013, the masses instantly fell in love with the absurd depiction of an egg with well-defined buttocks and a comically slothful disposition – a trait that millennials declared to be refreshingly relatable. This new series promises to show fans a new side of Gudetama, with an inspiring adventure that’s sure to lead to some character development.\n\nSynopsis: Disenchanted with life and struggling with feelings of worthlessness, high school student Shoya Ishida is on the verge of ending his life. While Shoya feels there is little he can do to make his own life better, he decides to take care of unfinished business to undo some of the damage that he’s caused in the past. As a way of redeeming his past actions, Shoya resolves to befriend Shoko – a former classmate who Shoya bullied relentlessly in middle school for being deaf.\n\nOverview: The popularity of anime films seem to weigh on how emotional they make you, and ‘A Silent Voice’ doesn’t let us down on that front. Grab your tissues – this heart-tugging masterpiece is one that’ll hit you where it counts.\n\nSynopsis: Light Yagami is a fiercely intelligent high school student who feels bored and under-stimulated with his student life.

There’s lots to love about the aforementioned productions, but it’s high time the mellower, slice of life titles get their time in the spotlight, too. This popular manga adaptation, starring Seiyo Uchino and Hidetoshi Nishijima, is a welcome change of pace chronicling the domestic life of an everyday couple – along with some mouthwatering scenes of home cooking.\n\nSynopsis:Though he has a good heart, fifth-grader Nobita struggles to fit in with his peers and consistently receives poor marks at school.

Through power struggles and fierce battles between samurai, the ensuing decades of 16th-century Japan become a pivotal time in history for the country and its rulers.\n\nOverview: This particular time in history doesn’t have to be presented as a period drama to be shocking, action-packed and full of high stakes – the true sequence of events are dramatic enough as they are. In this documentary series, the end of Japan’s Warring States period is chronicled by expert historians with re-enactments of events involving legendary rulers such as Toyotomi Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu. Commentary is in both English and Japanese, and re-enactments feature notable actors including Masayoshi Haneda (‘West World’, ‘The Last Samurai’) and Hideaki Ito (‘Memoirs of a Murderer’).\n\nSynopsis: Kaoru, an office worker in her twenties, lives with her pet chick and two bears. While Kaoru may not have too much in common with her fluffy roommates, the animals try their best to cheer her up when she’s down and help out around the house, even if they don’t always see eye to eye.\n\nOverview: This stop-motion animation is a heart-warming tribute to one of Japan’s most beloved characters, Rilakkuma. In this delightful series, we see the bear try earnestly to host a hanami, save money and lose weight alongside Kaoru, who is sometimes surprised at the lengths Rillakuma and his friends will go to be included, but nonetheless charmed by their good intentions. Whatever mood you’re in, it’s impossible not to fall in love with these innocent characters who’ll do anything for a friend.\n\nSynopsis: At this elite private school, gambling is part of the curriculum and the students’ positions in the hierarchy depend on their ability to swindle their peers over poker instead of their academic grades. Students who come away with all the winnings are heralded as the world’s future leaders, while those who lose and end up in debt are forced into servitude and become the ‘pets’ of their more competent classmates.\n\nOverview: The teenagers in Gossip Girl don’t hold a candle to the cut-throat ruthlessness of Hyakkaou Private Academy students. The anime series, which is adapted from a manga, is every bit as twisted as it sounds, leaving you with a similar sense of dread to what you felt when you thought about the villains who invented the ‘games’ of 'Squid Game'.\n\nSynopsis: Natsume Hyakuta is an aspiring actress trying to break into Tokyo’s competitive entertainment industry. While she determinedly juggles auditions with part-time jobs, she is finding it increasingly difficult to fight her insecurities and self-doubt.

A vibrant and visually stunning series with scenes shot in some of Tokyo’s trendiest hot spots, the series paints an intriguing yet realistic narrative of modern women in showbusiness that is also reliably feel-good for nights when you want something light-hearted.\n\nSynopsis: Doctor Atsuko Chiba and her team of scientists have developed a device that allows the user to enter people’s dreams. The device was invented as part of a treatment plan for psychiatric patients, but could cause imponderable damage in the wrong hands. When the device prototype is stolen, it is up to Chiba and her dream persona, Paprika, to save the real world and put things right.\n\nOverview: If you thought Christopher Nolan’s ‘Inception’ was trippy, you probably aren’t ready for the parade of dancing objects and dolls that come to life in the dream world of ‘Paprika’. Director Satoshi Kon brilliantly captures the bizarre and impalpable characteristics of a dream, conveying them through stunning animations that exceed anything that could be done in a live action film. You’d better strap yourself in and hold on extra tight, this is one wild carnival ride you won’t want to miss.\n\nSynopsis: A number of devastating earthquakes cause the islands of Japan to start sliding into the sea. The series follows the Murata family of four and their desperate bid for survival as the country is deluged by seawater.\n\nOverview: This anime series is directed by Masaaki Yuasa, known for 'Devilman Crybaby', 'Ride Your Wave' and 'Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken'. The ten-episode drama is based on the best-selling 1973 disaster novel by Sakyo Komatsu, in which major earthquakes strike Japan and cause it to sink into the ocean.

During the day, she gets pushed around by her boss and colleagues at the office, but at night, she hits a karaoke parlour and unleashes all her rage with death metal.\n\nOverview: The contrast of Retsuko’s cutesy daytime demeanour with her ferocious after-dark alter-ego is endlessly entertaining, but beyond her unusual way of letting off steam, Retsuko represents the everywoman of 21st century Japan. From her difficult coworkers to her overbearing mother who won't drop the subject of Retsuko's relationship status, Retsuko's everyday struggles are something that everyone can empathise with and it's Retsuko's relatability that makes this show binge-worthy.\n\nSynopsis:Haruto is a keen photographer who falls in love at first sight with a hair stylist called Misaki. Though it takes some time for Haruto to build up the courage to confess his feelings for her, Misaki happily agrees to go out with him. The relationship goes smoothly and Haruto is happier than he could have ever imagined – until his world is turned upside down when Misaki is diagnosed with a rare disease that causes her to age rapidly before his eyes.\n\nOverview:‘Love Like the Falling Petals’ is a long-awaited adaptation of a best-selling novel by Keisuke Uyama. Starring Kento Nakajima and Honoka Matsumoto, this sweet and wistful love story is one that allegorises the fleeting yet beautiful nature of cherry blossoms in full bloom.\n\nSynopsis:Shin-chan and his family take a day trip to a ‘nostalgia theme park’ where parents can revisit the joys of their childhood. The next morning, Shin-chan and his baby sister, Himawari, find themselves in a bizarre situation where their parents are behaving like children. Shin-chan’s friends reveal the same thing happened to their parents and the children resolve to investigate.\n\nOverview: While the Crayon Shin-chan franchise is geared towards children, the titular character’s hilarious antics and juvenile worldview will crack you up regardless of your age. Besides providing a strangely satisfying throwback to the bygone days of 20th-century Japan, the film’s underlying themes make for a riotously funny comedy, while the heartwarming conclusion is just pure chicken soup for the soul.\n\nSynopsis: A group of young strangers share a house where the camera captures some of their most intimate moments. As the days and weeks go by, the members form friendships, take on different roles around the house and even fall in love, all while juggling their personal and professional pursuits. Once a member feels they have made enough personal growth during their time at the house, they return to their previous life, making room for a new housemate.\n\nOverview: It’s not quite Big Brother, but the members of ‘Terrace House’ are sometimes followed by the camera as they leave the home for their various jobs, dates or outings with friends. Most of the new arrivals are single, giving plenty of opportunity to become romantically attached to other members. Unsurprisingly, this also leads to bitter rivalry, heartbreak and messy love triangles that viewers can’t help but get invested in.\n\nWhile watching each member navigating their careers, life with their housemates and romantic pursuits is entertaining on its own, what really makes the show is the commentary provided by the panel of Japanese comedians and TV personalities who make sidesplitting remarks about the characters’ interactions in the house.\n\nSynopsis: An unsuccessful salesman, Toru Muranishi tries his luck in the porn industry after getting fired from his job and discovering his wife is having an affair. Despite his lack of experience, Muranishi quickly learns the rising potential of the VHS and goes on to build an empire for himself while revolutionising the porn industry in Japan.\n\nOverview: It’s the show everybody is talking about. This full-frontal biopic series is loosely based on the true story of adult film director Toru Muranishi. The show is a provocative narrative of his eccentric, often bizarre adult film career that blossomed at the height of the economic boom in the ‘80s. Netflix has already confirmed the show is being renewed for a second season.\n\nSynopsis:Japan's oldest sport, sumo, is one where women are still barred from entering the dohyo wrestling ring. Although sumo is not officially recognised as a women's sport in Japan, aspiring sumo wrestler, Hiyori Kon, pursues it anyway, with the goal of becoming the world's best female sumo wrestler.\n\nOverview: When two women were ushered out of the dohyo ring after rushing to aid a Japanese mayor who was suffering from a stroke in 2018, the Japan Sumo Association was heavily criticised for allowing outdated gender biases to perpetuate in modern society. While the JSA apologised for an inappropriate response to an urgent situation, no changes in policy were made. This short yet stunning documentary takes a balanced look at the sport, exploring the beautiful traditions of sumo as well as the ugly prejudices behind it.\n\nSynopsis: A man who is only known to those around him as ‘Master’ runs a small restaurant from midnight to 7am daily. The restaurant welcomes a mixed group of clientele every night who dish up their fascinating personal stories as the chef serves them dinner. During these hours, the Master becomes a trusted confidant as well as a cook while his diners contemplate their personal dilemmas over a soulful dish.\n\nOverview: List this under the ‘Don’t Watch Hungry’ category. 'Midnight Diner' features a host of scenes with mouthwatering home-style dishes that’ll have you craving whatever Master is dishing up that night. Be heartwarmed as you join these lone diners – from seasoned lawyers to forlorn gamblers – at the table while they connect with each other in this intimate eatery during the wee hours of the night.\n\nSynopsis: In order to complete a mission, a secret agent sets out to find a wife and adopt a child in order to build a cover as an ordinary family man.

Though each member of the trio is on their own mission, they soon settle into their new dynamic, eventually becoming more like a real family to each other than initially anticipated.\n\nOverview:Who knew that a series about a cutthroat assassin and a serious spy could prove to be so heartwarming? Beyond the ironic humour and stunning artwork, this 2022 anime series is packed with feel-good content that we all desperately need.\n\nSynopsis: It’s been years since the war ended, but former soldier Violet Evergarden is still reeling from the loss of her beloved mentor and longtime friend Major Gilbert.

All the while, she searches for the meaning behind Gilbert’s final words to her.\n\nOverview:This film is a sequel to the 13-episode anime series, so if you haven’t been following along, you might want to start there to get yourself up to speed. The first full-length feature produced by Kyoto Animation since the studio’s arson attack in 2019, the ‘Violet Evergarden: The Movie’ holds extra significance for film lovers as well as fans of the franchise.\n\nSynopsis: A paranormal researcher looks into the sinister history of a house where a mother’s body was found with no sign of her child. People claim that the house is cursed, but no one seems to know the truth of the terrible events surrounding it.\n\nOverview: Also known as 'The Grudge', the 'Ju-On' franchise became such a hit in Japan that it sparked a number of American adaptations. Though reboots seldom live up to the original material, 'Ju-On''s first series adaptation holds spine-chilling potential, with ghoulish scenes of that awful eye peeping out from a curtain of black hair, and not to mention the ominous sound of footsteps at night\n\nSynopsis: Recently retired Takeshi Kasumi struggles to find a new routine for himself after years of being a salaryman. While his wife carries on with her usual day-to-day activities, Kasumi goes out looking for a bite to eat, whereupon he discovers his inner samurai who encourages him to live each day (or each meal) to the fullest without any inhibitions.\n\nOverview: Have you ever stopped yourself from eating that second helping of curry rice because you were worried about your waistline? Or shied away from a restaurant you were interested in because the queue was too long? Perhaps you need to get in touch with your inner samurai to help you enjoy your food the way it’s meant to be. Starring Naoto Takenaka as Takeshi Kasumi and Tetsuji Tamayama from 'Naked Director' as the samurai, Samurai Gourmet is a series that’ll have you taking to the streets in earnest search of your next epiphany-inducing meal.\n\nSynopsis: Five women appear at the house of a struggling novelist, Shin Michima. They proceed to pay him a monthly sum of a million yen, in exchange for rent and living expenses, but Michima doesn’t know why these women are here ⁠— and the women won’t let him ask them any questions about it either.\n\nOverview: This series was adapted from the manga of the same name by Shunju Aono. While it’s the kind of story that could only ever come out of a seinen manga (manga marketed for young men), each of the women have distinct personality traits and their refusal to provide Michima with any details regarding who they are and why they’re there creates an interesting dynamic that’ll have you baffled and probably bingeing the series in one go.\n\nSynopsis: After his mother is murdered in their own home, Satoru Fujinuma is thrown back in time by 18 years, before a number of life-threatening incidents have taken place.

This 2017 series is the only version with English subtitles. Purists will argue that neither of the adaptations live up to the original anime, but the story translates well to its real-life representation on screen and does the original material fair justice.\n\nSynopsis: An ancient race of evil demons disguise themselves as humans as they begin reclaiming the planet for themselves. Akira Fudo is told by his best friend that the only way to defeat the demons is by harnessing their powers. Akira gains the powers of a demon through an infernal ritual, thereby becoming Devilman. Despite his powers, Akira still possesses his pure human soul, and gets pulled into a diabolical war between demons and humans.\n\nOverview: This animated masterpiece demonstrates the versatility of the art form and the wide spectrum of genres in anime. It’s violent, crude and shockingly explicit, but this intense rollercoaster of a show is one of Netflix’s best Japanese productions to date. Not for kids.\n\nSynopsis: Five experts take on Japan for the first time and help a few local heroes rediscover themselves by sharing their individual flair and skill sets. They are joined by two of Japan's most prominent TV personalities, Naomi Watanabe and Kiko Mizuhara, as they set out to transform lives together.\n\nOverview: Queer Eye was rebooted in 2018 and is already gearing up to release its fifth season. The show has seen overwhelming success and captured the hearts of thousands worldwide for its inspiring message of self worth. This highly anticipated mini-series, filmed in Japan, is expected to highlight some of Japan's most exciting cultural aspects along with plenty of tear-jerking moments.

With a heart-tugging premise and a host of loveable mythical beings, Toshinari Shinohe and Takana Shirai’s directorial debut is a strong one."
