        "text": "I have 100% this game, AMA / Tips\n\nTips if you're looking for a single playthrough:\n\n1. Set Time to Slowest\n\nTime works by changing scenes/areas. You can see this clearly if you set the time to fastest. So you need to get a solid grasp of where things are and their shortcuts relative to your map.\n\n2. Talk to everyone twice (Day and Night) because this is the only way to get orders to take back to the restaurants (orders usually done around lunch time or noon up until nighttime with the exception of the trainstation guy who goes home at night). Also, I would do this first thing every day and every night before you do anything else. and make sure to pick up herbs/fish/etc. on the screen with the NPC since that doesn't take up any time from your clock.\n\n3. Idk what the DJ \"game\" does or how it works. You don't need to know either, you just need to talk to the juice bar owner a few times to get all the songs. You may need to actually play the game a few times. I don't know.\n\n4. One of the final parts is opened up by winning the Rock/Paper/Scissor tournament. I hope you enjoy pain and suffering. The only advice is to start off with your weakest attack every time. maybe 1/20 times they'll not bite. Only exception is the kid with the brontosaurus (long neck dino) which is played at no.2 in the tourney iirc. However, it's still not worth ever picking your strongest attack out of the gate from my experience. either weakest or next weakest.\n\n5. Load up on Vegetables at the supermarket, you make a few yen but you can also get the 300 yen bonus multiple times per day by completing 5 tasks. Near the end everyone has more than 5 tasks so you can make easy money that way.\n\n6. Almost everything else is unlocked during the story at some point. It may seem like you need to solve some kind of puzzle to open something. Nope, just wait. As long as you're talking to everyone.\n\n7. Every area/scene change resets fish and bugs but not plants and I believe that some fish and bugs don't show up until week 2 and week 3 so you can't get them all in week 1. Ideally, you want to make a (mental) note of each area and then spend some time in the morning (prior to noon), some time Noon and after, and finally some time at dusk (when the sky turns orange) for grinding out fish and bugs. A few bugs you are going to struggle to see but using your net around trees is a good idea. Some VIP bugs will have special animations where they'll fly off and come back. The one you'll notice is next to your house. I don't think you can get that one because it never comes back from what I've seen. but keep an eye out because some of the rare bugs will show up pretty prominently in other areas that you can see from the area you're at. If you notice a bug off in the distance, that's probably a special one.\n\n8. I found all but 2 bugs and 2 fish just being a dogged but I couldn't figure out some. There's a japanese guide I found with everything on it but google translate won't seem to translate the page for whatever reason. So I had to manually click around and figure it out. The have pictures of exactly the places to go but the names are often different so check the images.\n\nhttps://h1g.jp/crayon_natsu/?%E9%87%8E%E8%8F%9C"
