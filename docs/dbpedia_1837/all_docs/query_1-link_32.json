        "text": "Crayon Shin-chan is a Japanese animated television series, which is otherwise known as Shin Chan in much of the world, as designated by owner TV Asahi. In proper Japanese, the title should be \"Shin-chan,\" but the spelling has eliminated the hyphen for unknown reasons. Shin chan has enjoyed success on multiple continents, including Latin America, parts of Europe, continental Asia, and the United States. The show, which has been in production since 1992, is based on Yoshito Usui's manga series. In Japan, the series is aired in 15 minute, or 30 minute timeslots, which are each made of up smaller vignettes.\n\nContents\n\n1 History of English adaptation\n\n2 History of the Spanish adaptation\n\n3 Writing Process of the Funimation dub\n\n4 Cast\n\n5 Seasons\n\n6 Feature Films\n\n7 DVD Releases\n\n7.1 Vitello\n\n7.1.1 Australia\n\n7.1.2 United Kingdom\n\n7.2 Funimation\n\n8 In-Depth\n\n9 External links\n\nHistory of English adaptation\n\nAround 1996, TV Asahi began an effort to market Crayon Shin-chan to the international market outside of Asia. Unfortunately, this would take a few years, as many countries would not see it til the new millennium hit. The network, along with US representative Lacey Entertainment, commissioned California based Vitello Productions to supervise the localization of the series for the English speaking market. From this version, other versions of the show would be adapted into other languages for Latin America and parts of Europe. The cast of this English adaptation included actors like Kath Soucie, Andi McAfee, Grey Delisle, and Patrick Fraley. This version aired in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Australia, but never managed to air in North America. In 2003, the show's license changed hands again, and then changed studios to Universal City's phuuz entertainment inc. This company re-cast the entire show with experienced ADR actors, and retained all the character names. One of the networks the series was pitched to was Adult Swim, whose VP of production Keith Crofford was revealed to be a fan of the series. Unfortunately, the network passed on phuuz's adaptation, feeling it was more appropriate for a kid audience. Despite no presence in North America, the show gained a lot of attention in other parts of the western world and Europe to make Crayon Shin-chan a larger success worldwide. Most of the networks that aired the series were part of the Fox Kids and later Jetix chain. The license agreement between Lacey Entertainment and TV Asahi expired at the end of 2005.\n\nTV Asahi wasn't ready to throw in the towel for the American market yet. In 2006, Crayon Shin-chan was co-licensed in North America by FUNimation Entertainment alongside TV Asahi. Already aware of the Adult Swim connection, the show was pitched once again to the network, but this time with the intent to re-write the show's dialog for an older audience. Adult Swim accepted, but because of their hesitation with comedy anime, they decided not to go with a full season order and instead go with a 6 episode temporary lease. To ensure better success, FUNimation asked Adult Swim to recommend some Williams Street writers, or former writers, to help them with the English adaptation. FUNimation settled on the writing duo of Evan Dorkin and Sarah Dyer in addition to their own writing talent, which was a Los Angeles based group of comedy television writers hired by Jared Hedges, the show's head writer. The network aired the show in a limited \"test run\" from August 19th through September 9th.\n\nDue to the success of the test run on Adult Swim, the series was picked up for more episodes due to be released in season boxsets. The first official season of the English adaptation began broadcasting on April 18, 2007, with the notable exception of Dorkin and Dyer, who were cut from punch-up work for unknown reasons. Dorkin speculated in his LiveJournal that it may have been a combination of lateness in his scripts and a cost cutting measure.\n\nHistory of the Spanish adaptation\n\nThe Mexican dub, one of the Spanish-language exports, was a translation of the Vitello dub. Conversely, the dub in Spain which is a translation of the original Japanese version, most notably in the Castile or Castella region, enjoyed a great deal of popularity. Spain is the only country outside of Japan to have a Shin Chan video game released domestically. The series creator has occasionally visited the country because of the success there.\n\nWriting Process of the Funimation dub\n\nOne of Shin Chan's full time writers of the Funimation dub, going under the handle Shincowriter, informed animation news site Toonzone.net how the show's ADR writing process occurs. Unlike traditional ADR writing, which is merely adapting overtly literal translations into proper English, Shin Chan's process is more intensive and requires a larger staff.\n\nStep 1: The original series is translated to English. These translations are extremely literal, which is par for the course when it comes to translating for ADR writing.\n\nStep 2: Head writer Jared Hedges gives the individual vignettes to the episode writers. The writers adapt the show and intentionally insert their own comedic dialogue.\n\nStep 3: The head writer double-checks and approves the scripts with the director, Zach Bolton.\n\nStep 4: No longer used - Scripts are sent for a re-write to the punch-up script writers, who proceed to add their own dialogue to the show. The punch-up writers also add alternative improvisational dialogue to the already added lines from the initial writers.\n\nStep 5: The head writer receives the re-write and chooses what lines to use and what not to use. He may also add his own lines. He hands the final copy to the director.\n\nStep 6: The director modifies the script in the booth for mouth movements and lip-synch; a common practice for any ADR work. Actors are also encouraged to improvise while in the booth for Shin Chan's dub. (Principal Ench was given his accent while in the booth by his actor, Jason Liebrecht.)\n\nCast\n\nJapanese Voices Character Dub Name(s) English Voices\n\n(Vitello/Phuuz) English Voices\n\n(FUNi) Main Cast Akiko Yajima Shinnosuke \"Shin\" Nohara Kath Soucie (1)\n\nDiane Michelle (2) Laura Bailey Keiji Fujiwara Hiroshi Nohara Harry,\n\nHiro Eric Loomis (1)\n\nPeter Doyle (2) Chuck Huber Miki Narahashi Misae Nohara Mitsy,\n\nMitzi Kath Soucie (1)\n\nJulie Maddalena (2) Cynthia Cranz Satomi Koorogi Himawari Nohara Daisy,\n\nHima Russi Taylor Colleen Clinkenbeard Mari Mashiba Shiro Lucky,\n\nSnowy,\n\nWhitey,\n\nNevado,\n\nNevat Michael Sorich (2) Chris Cason Secondary Cast Mari Mashiba Tooru Kazama Cosmo,\n\nGeorgie Prescott III Grey DeLisle (1)\n\nHope Levy (2) Brina Palencia Tamao Hayashi Nene Sakurada Nini,\n\nPenny Milfer Anndi McAfee (1)\n\nMichelle Ruff (2) Carrie Savage Teiyū Ichiryūsai Masao Sato Max Russi Taylor (1)\n\nBarbara Goodson (2) Colleen Clinkenbeard Chie Satō Boo Bo\n\nSuzuki Eric Loomis (2)\n\nRichard Cansino (2) Chris Cason Miki Narahashi Ai Suotome Sally Monica Rial Satomi Koorogi Bunta Takakura Principal Enzo,\n\nPrincipal Bernoulli Ench,\n\nGang Leader Sir Patrick Fraley Jason Liebrecht Yumi Takada Midori Ishizaka Miss Dori,\n\nMiss Anderson Anndi McAfee Caitlin Glass Michie Tomizawa Ume Matsuzaka Miss Uma,\n\nMiss Katz Grey DeLisle Clarine Harp TBA Masumi Ageo Miss Polly, Miss Agnes Jamie Marchi Tesshō Genda Action Kamen Masked Muchacho,\n\nAction Bastard Patrick Fraley Troy Baker\n\nSeasons\n\nShow Season Premiere Finale # TV Asahi (Japanese) Crayon Shin-chan Season One April 19, 1992 December 21, 1992 33 Crayon Shin-chan Season Two January 11, 1993 December 27, 1993 47 Crayon Shin-chan Season Three January 10, 1994 December 19, 1994 48 Crayon Shin-chan Season Four January 9, 1995 December 18, 1995 44 Crayon Shin-chan Season Five January 8, 1996 December 20, 1996 42 Crayon Shin-chan Season Six January 10, 1997 December 19, 1997 45 Crayon Shin-chan Season Seven January 9, 1998 December 11, 1998 43 Crayon Shin-chan Season Eight January 8, 1999 December 10, 1999 43 Crayon Shin-chan Season Nine January 28, 2000 December 15, 2000 37 Crayon Shin-chan Season Ten January 12, 2001 December 14, 2001 40 Crayon Shin-chan Season Eleven January 25, 2002 December 7, 2002 33 Crayon Shin-chan Season Twelve January 11, 2003 December 6, 2003 31 Crayon Shin-chan Season Thirteen January 10, 2004 December 17, 2004 28 Crayon Shin-chan Season Fourteen January 7, 2005 December 9, 2005 36 Crayon Shin-chan Season Fifteen January 13, 2006 December 8, 2006 35 Crayon Shin-chan Season Sixteen January 12, 2007 - 17 Fox Kids/Jetix (Vitello/Phuuz)[1] Shin Chan Vitello 2002 — 52 Shin Chan Phuuz 2003 — 78 [adult swim] (FUNimation)[1] Shin Chan Test Run August 19, 2006 August 29, 2006 6 Shin Chan Season One April 18, 2007 December 17, 2007 20 Shin Chan Season Two April 25, 2008 December 14, 2008 26 Shin Chan Season Three July 26, 2011 September 27, 2011 26\n\n↑ 1.0 1.1 Due to the re-organizing of episodes, and unique dialog adaptation, FUNimation and Vitello/phuuz episodes are listed under different show titles in consideration for the proper series.\n\nFeature Films\n\nTitle Release Date Action Kamen vs Leotard Devil July 24, 1993 The Secret Treasure of Buri Buri Kingdom April 23, 1994 Unkokusai's Ambition April 15, 1995 Adventure in Henderland April 13, 1996 Pursuit of the Balls of Darkness April 19, 1997 Blitzkrieg!
