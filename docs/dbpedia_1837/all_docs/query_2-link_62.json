Like pulling on his mom's skirt & looking at her undies or showing off his weaner in public, really this kid's got Cartman's number ;D\n\nI only see similarities in how they both act out a lot and cause a lot of trouble. Cartman has definitely proven to be a lot smarter than Shin.\n\nRegardless it's one of my favorite shows as I always find myself asking \"How is this in a kid's show?\"\n\nWell that's because Cartman is 10 & Shin is just 5 or 6, but look at it this way, in 4, 5 years, Shin will become Cartman ;D\n\nI have watched every episode of Shin Chan so far and I love its style of humor. Its no family guy or south park but it is definitely special in its own way."
