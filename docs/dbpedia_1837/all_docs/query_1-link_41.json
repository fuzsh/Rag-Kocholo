        "text": "Alternate versions are not allowed and are considered as duplicates.\n\nAs such, this English dub isn't allowed as a separate entry.\n\nYou can use an episode group on the original entry to accomodate a different episode order.\n\nHey, thanks. Wasn't aware of that mechanism.\n\nI began to make an honest attempt at creating an episode group for the funimation dub, but I ran into a snag.\n\nIt seems that more than just the episode order are different; One episode of the funimation dub consists of 3 or 4 mixed and matched short episodes from various episodes of the original series.\n\nI.e., S01E02 of the funimation dub consists of episodes 374b, 379b, and 456c of the Japenese series, and the overall episode has one name. Add'l context:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Crayon_Shin-chan_episodes#Funimation_dub\n\nSorry if I'm over-complicating this, but understanding this, do you have a recommendation on how reconcile these discrepancies? Whether via episode groups or another means\n\nThe Funimation release of Crayon Shin-chan is neither a dub nor gag dub it is a complete re-imagination. The episode title, plot, and voice acting do not correspond to any original episode. There is no way to use the original episodes to create an episode group without knowing the specific animation of a scene that it corresponds to in an original episode. The 1st episode of the release is called \"Pee Strike\" by the studio but the title screen in the animation is called \"Shin's Allowance\" I could find neither using the original episode list. Are re-imaginations supported?\n\nTitle screen screenshot: https://ibb.co/KzDw876 Wiki: https://crayonshinchan.fandom.com/wiki/English_Funimation_dub\n\nFwiw, I gave up on trying to use tmdb for this show and ended up scraping prime video to make nfo files I didnt find a way to make this work with segments and it didn't make sense with the way these were put together anyway"
