        "text": "Amazon Original CRAYON SHIN-CHAN SPINOFF Season 4 to Stream Exclusively Starting May 31st Source: Amazon Prime Video, Wright Film Inc. press releases Special Thanks to Richard Jeffery and Ayame Yamamoto\n\nA SCIFI JAPAN EXCLUSIVE\n\nAmazon announced the latest installment in its CRAYON SHIN-CHAN SPINOFF (???????????, Kureyon Shinchan Gaiden) series which is highly rated on Amazon Prime Video. CRAYON SHIN-CHAN: O-O-O-NO SHINNOSUKE (??????????? ????????????, Kureyon Shinchan Gaiden o o o no Shinnosuke) will start streaming exclusively with unlimited viewing on Amazon Prime Video from May 31, 2017. The fourth spinoff depicts a small country town overrun by yokai monsters and is complete in 13 seven-minute episodes, with new episodes streaming every Wednesday. Amazon Prime members can watch and download the programs via the free Amazon Prime Video app for iOS and Android mobile devices, Amazon Fire TV, Fire TV Stick, Fire tablets, game consoles, smart TVs and online at amazon.co.jp/primevideo.\n\n“Children love dinosaurs, robots, aliens, idol singers and yokai monsters,” commented director Akira Shigino. “Will the yokai-packed O-O-O-NO SHINNOSUKE be really popular with kids? I’m both a little nervous and a little relaxed. Shin-chan appears as a yokai and uses their battle techniques. His dignified figure is different from usual. Shin-chan is a lonely yokai looking for his mother. He meets a girl. She tells him her dreams. Their thoughts intersect in the port town.” “He’s a yokai, everyone. Shinnosuke becomes a yokai in Season 4,” commented series showrunner Wataru Takahashi. “Even though he’s just a kindergartner who can call up storms, he’s still a yokai. It’s scary. And funny. In a peaceful port town. Strange things happen all the time. Everyday there’s something surprising. Shinnosuke arrives looking for his mother and meets Fumie, a girl who loves money. They form a tag team to solve the case. How? I can’t reveal that here. Only Prime members can find out. So, go get Prime!” Amazon Prime members can currently watch every episode from all three CRAYON SHIN-CHAN SPINOFF series. In Season 1, ALIEN VS. SHINNOSUKE (????????? ???????vs.?????, Kureyon Shinchan Gaiden Eirian vs. Shinnosuke, 2016), Shin-chan encountered an alien in a drifting spaceship in his first locked-room thriller. In Season 2, TOY WARS (??????????? ????????, Kureyon Shinchan Gaiden Omocha Uoozu, 2016), Shinnosuke joins the Kasukabe Defense Force to fight toys that came to life burning for revenge against the humans who discarded them. In Season 3, LONE WOLF AND FAMILY (??????????? ?????, Kureyon Shinchan Gaiden Kazokuzure Ookami, 2017), Hiroshinosuke takes his family on a journey to spread the Nohara style of butt-swordplay. Each series can also be enjoyed as a 91-minute theatrical version (seven-minute x 13 episodes). ? CRAYON SHIN-CHAN: O-O-O-NO SHINNOSUKE Synopsis A small country town. Recently, the town has witnessed many strange incidents. A yokai kindergartner O-O-O-No Shinnosuke and his yokai father Tamatama Dad arrive in town.

When an elementary school girl Fumie Sakura is suddenly attacked by the mysterious Fuzzy Wuzzy, a superfluous-hair yokai, Shinnosuke goes to her aid.
