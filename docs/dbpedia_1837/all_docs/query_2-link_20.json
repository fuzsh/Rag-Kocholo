        "text": "Hello everyone…. Today my blog is about Shin-Chan. Mostly everyone know who is Shin-Chan. In this blog you will read some unknown secrets and the true life of Shin-Chan.\n\nMostly as everyone thought even I thought that these cartoons are just fictional but when I researched about Shin-chan I came to know that this cartoon is based on a 5year-old Japanese boy . Now let’s get into the blog.\n\nCrayon Shin-Chan\n\nCrayon Shin-chan (or more simply known as Shin-chan) is a manga series written and drawn by Yoshito Usui, which originally ran from August 1990 to February 2010 until a new series titled New Crayon Shin-chan began in August 2010. The series primarily focuses on the crude, comedic, and raunchy situations of a 5-year-old boy named Shinnosuke Nohara (who often goes by “Shin”) alongside his parents, baby sister, dog, and friends from school. An anime series based on the manga was produced by Shin-Ei Animation in April 1992 and is still currently airing with over 900 episodes. Several animated films based off the anime were also produced and have been released annually since July 1993.\n\nThe untold story of our favorite cartoon Shin-Chan\n\nShin Chan is inspired by real person named Sinnosuke Nohara who died trying to save his little sister from a Car Accident. His mother was so shocked and depressed because she lost her both children. She started portraying a happy story and drew on a book everyday. This sad story inspired Yoshita Usui to create Anime by the name of Shin-Chan.\n\nThe Last Episode did not air on television because it was about Shin Chan trying to save his sister and got killed In car accident.\n\nI love this cartoon a lot and always this cartoon was my first choice. This cartoon has been my fav cartoon from past 5 or 6 years but I never realized that Shin-Chan’s mom went through these. In this cartoon Shin-Chan is soo funny but in real he is soo caring and He is so great that he sacrificed his life to save his sister. The best brother ever."
