A bolt of lightning strikes one of these toys one day, and gives it life. Alongside other toys thrown away by people, Oban swears revenge on humans, and attacks. At the same time, Oban's sworn enemy Chūkōnen Kamen is also given life. Chūkōnen Kamen, normally a middle-aged, overweight, and depressed man, powers up by eating cup noodles. Alongside Shinnosuke, he will fight to reclaim peace for the world."
