        "text": "Long time ago, I had this perception (assumption, rather) that Level E was going to be some sort of sci-fi horror. Without reading the synopsis and just taking a quick swipe at the promotional poster, sure there’s this hot handsome naked blond on it. But he looked creepy. Could be some sort of body snatcher alien that preys on unsuspecting humans. Uh huh. Quite the imagination there, huh? Can’t believe I actually jumped to that conclusion without even f*cking reading the synopsis. The ultimate judging a book by its cover! And that was like over a decade ago. Yup, this show came out in 2011. Feeling old? I know I do. And now at this point in time, an accidental stumbling on this series again, this time I read the premise. So, you mean it wasn’t sci-fi horror but comedy?! An idiotic alien prince playing pranks and making life hell to others just for his own amusement?! OMG. This I must have a look! Yeah, the real horror is my sadistic nature…\n\nEpisode 1\n\nYukitaka Tsutsui moves from Tokyo to Yamagata to attend a school that offers baseball scholarship. As he enters his apartment, he sees some of his stuffs unpacked. Did mom do it? Well, there is this blonde guy sitting here in his clothes! No matter how much Yukitaka shows him out, he gets back in! Blondie then reveals he is an alien and the crash in the mountains recently wasn’t just a comet but an escape pod he was in. Yes, it is all over the news as the site is being investigated. Yukitaka demands proof but being amnesiac, alien dude gives him a strange controller. Pressing around, something at the crash site goes boom! Alien guy mocks him for being a killer! Yukitaka not impressed but a short distraction as next door neighbour, Miho Edogawa is here to greet him. Seems she goes to his same school and her father, Ranzo is a researcher working on that alien crash. Hope he isn’t killed! After that, alien guy continues mocking him, replaying his conversation with Miho but being a killer at the same time! He wants Yukitaka to let him stay here. Or else what? He will reveal he is the killer! Okay, okay. You win. Soon the news reports there were no casualties. Now Yukitaka hits back at him and dares him to announce it even though it is undisputed he caused the bomb. Surprisingly, alien guy doesn’t do his usual mocking and leaves. Yukitaka has a change of heart and lets him stay for tonight. However the news soon show a strange alien artefact. Upon seeing it, alien guy instantly needs to get it and jumps off the balcony! Damn, did a car crash into him? Blue blood. Yukitaka helps him and realizes he was helping to save a kitten. As he rests under the tree, Yukitaka soon believes he is an alien and a good one because he starts to heal all those around him. Meanwhile Ranzo seems to have seen a projection from the artefact. Next day, a couple of cops knock on Yukitaka’s door asking if he has seen this blondie. No, why? He is a murderer. So Yukitaka asks alien dude about it and he reveals he stole the artefact although he was attacked first and got shot. So he had no choice but to get aggressive. This artefact reveals alien guy’s true identity. It might not be pleasant but Yukitaka is in for the ride. Oh man, so this hideous mother fluidic organism from the planet Jacqueline Ess is his true form???!!!\n\nEpisode 2\n\nYukitaka accepts his true form so alien guy thanks him. Then it is revealed this ugly thing is his pet! Yeah, owning a pet defines who he truly is! And yes, he still has amnesia! A group of aliens lands in the nearby forest. Craft, Sado and Colin are going to find a certain person. Miho hears strange laughing sounds coming from Yukitaka room. But she isn’t surprised this dude is an alien. What her father does again? Anyway, she is willing to help Yukitaka hide alien guy as protest against her father’s forceful methods. Alien guy gives them the slip and escapes despite being told to stay put as many are looking for him. At first Yukitaka doesn’t give a damn but Miho warns if he gets found, he may be killed. You gonna take responsibility? Craft and his men see the local shrine master and it seems living among them on this planet are various alien races. Despite being enemies, they manage to live together. Craft soon learns the person he is seeking is living in an apartment due to the tracing of some distress signal. Yukitaka and Miho find alien dude enjoying his drink at a café. First thing, Yukitaka beats him up! All the trouble they’ve gone through looking for him! However he soon confides with them if he has done a good or bad deed. You see earlier, he stumbled upon a gang trying to harass a poor girl. He approached them and was told off. But he didn’t back down and they gang up and beat him. After the girl escaped, alien guy then forcefully beats one down! The rest fled. Yukitaka and Miho claim he did a good deed and so he is relieved. But what to do with the dead body he stuffed in the dustbin! DAAAAAAMN!!! So as they return home, looks like Craft and co are waiting for him. Craft is not impressed and gets angry at this prince. Alien dude is a prince?! Prince Baka Ki El Dogra! While Baka doesn’t remember a thing, Craft continues to get rough with him. So Yukitaka steps in and demands answers. Both have a petty schoolboy showdown as Craft reveals they were escorting Baka to an intergalactic conference when the crash happened. This conference is important because with meeting with many races and if this prince is missing, there will be war! Many planets destroyed! To their horror, Baka brought back that body! Need to hide it, right? Worse, further analysis shows this corpse isn’t human to begin with but a Disckonian alien! Those hot headed aliens will not hesitate to kill those who mess with them, right?!\n\nEpisode 3\n\nThe Disckonian is still alive. He vows revenge on Baka and then flees. They talk about the Disckonian personality that faking death is shameful and it proves you are weak. That is why they eliminate the cause of their embarrassment. Then all the Disckonian aliens start surrounding outside the apartment. The shrine master calls Craft and warns him to hand over the culprit by sundown or else. Baka is willing to go along but Craft won’t allow it since he is important. In fact, Craft and his men are trying to concoct a plan using humans as shields as they escape this planet. Of course this doesn’t sit well with Yukitaka and they get into an argument. Time is running out so they remember Baka was amassing data on various life forms before the conference. Craft thinks of using force to bring back his memories. Yeah, he beats down the prince! Looks like he is enjoying it! The other men explain Baka is a smart person but he always plays pranks rather than using his talents to support the nation. So yeah, Craft was one of his many guinea pigs. Well, Baka is out conscious now and time is up. The mob marches in. Maybe there is some data on Disckonian’s weakness in the artefact? Good news, there is! So as they look through, it seems they stumble into something scary. The truth? When the Disckonian mob is here, Yukitaka stands up and will defend his friend. If they want him, they must go through him. That is when Craft starts acting strange because he has seen the truth. The mob then goes meek. They realize they have been busted! What gives? You see, this whole thing was a setup by Baka from the start! The secret info is actually a very elaborated trailer made by Baka to test the loyalty of Craft’s men as well as to spy on the upcoming baseball ace AKA Yukitaka. Hence all the Disckonian including Ranzo were actually in on this! The cat had a hidden camera! Yes, everything from the moment Yukitaka first met Baka in his room, all were premeditated and calculated! Greatest candid camera act ever! Feel like killing him? Oh well, here goes crazy Craft as he tries to shoot the prince down but he manages to escape. The Disckonian are now impressed with Yukitaka. Seems they are fans of baseball! The reason why warring aliens here don’t fight is because of baseball! They want his autograph! 3 months later, it seems Yukitaka is chosen to be part of some tournament. He and Miho get a letter from Baka. Yeah, he was strictly guarded during his duration at the conference. It was a success. Also, it was agreed Earth is now under Baka’s observation and domain. As such, he will be staying on it since he is appointed as of the newly formed task force for it. Uh huh. You know what this means, right?\n\nEpisode 4\n\n4 friends are hanging out at some hidden place when they realize a hot classmate chick comes in. Too bad she is dead! And her murderer then eats her! OMFG! Soon the news reports of her went missing. But the friends know it too well. They know the perpetrator is from their school but they do not know who. After asking about, they downsize the suspects to 3 people. They won’t probe further as they vow at least not to get close to them. But the next day, 1 of the friends go missing. The rest go to see this trippy Jesus Christ dude for answers so he recommends them to some clinic. The doctor learns what happens but if they want further preventive measures, they must pay. And expensive too. He then explains about certain parasitic aliens living among humans and prey on humans. Of course this was never made public. It is a price to pay for their safety, right? A few days later, another friend goes missing. The remaining friends panic and go see the doctor again. This time they are willing to pay so the doctor will start his investigation. For now, they will be provided a place to stay for a week. Food will be provided. As the duo enter a room, they get locked in. Hey, their missing friends are here too! So apparently when they got worried and split up, they went to the same Jesus and he recommended the same doctor. Of course the doctor never said a thing due to patient confidentiality. But in the next room, they find various alien specimens. The doctor then returns with his investigation. He shows them a video interviewing a parasitic alien kid whose planet was destroyed due to war. It seems their kind, men eat women to have children. Some more alien sci-fi mumbo jumbo I don’t get. So apparently this alien kid has a brother in school and he too ate a classmate. Both brothers are now having regrets eating the female victim as they have developed romantic feelings for them. The friends are freed. The case remains unsolved, blah, blah, blah… Turns out all this is just a brainstorming session by Baka to his men to come up with some plan to convey a message to Earthlings about extra-terrestrial life via fiction. And Yukitaka is not happy they are using his place for this. Get out!\n\nEpisode 5\n\n5 young boys are minding their own business when Baka suddenly kidnaps Taiyo Akagawa, Yoshiki Shimizu, Osamu Momochi, Mayo Mayuzumi and Kunimitsu Yokota to his spaceship! It seems they have been chosen to protect Earth as Colour Rangers! Yeah, the boys want to screw that and return to their boring lives. So, is that more important than saving the world?! No choice, they play along with this charade and before they know it, he slaps irremovable wristbands on them. Then they are whisked back to their homes and they test out their transformation. Definitely they are Colour Rangers now. In class, they discuss about this whole thing when their teacher, Tachibana comes in. Because of their special goggles, they are shocked to see her true form as an alien! They hide in the toilet but looks like Tachibana is on to them and wants them to see her after school. The boys continue to deliberate if they don’t expose her identity, maybe they’ll be safe. Perhaps even talk to her and she might understand. However Baka of course dispels all that and explains Tachibana is actually an alien assassin who even kills babies! Hence it is Colour Rangers’ duty to defeat her! He even throws them a manual on how to use their powers but be warn of its caveats. Then here comes Tachibana. Is it time to panic? She notices their wristbands and thought it was only a toy. She gets them to spill the beans and realizing Baka is behind this, she laughs hard. She simply puts it that prince is a terrible person who makes trouble for others to keep himself from getting bored! While it is true that she is an assassin, she only does so to make a living so she can save up and travel the universe! The boys come up with a brilliant solution: How much is she willing to be paid to kill that prince! Of course being the nice teacher, she wants them to build their character and hence they must do it themselves first before asking for help. And to put a rest if she kills babies: Yes she does. But the price is so high nobody can afford. Smart. Now the boys call out to Baka who is the real villain. In that case, he will become the baddie. For them to be freed of their wristband, they must get a key whom he has entrusted with Craft. Yes, defeat him! But first they must level up!\n\nEpisode 6\n\nNerdy leader, Akagawa levels up and brags to his friends. Guess what? Then he can defeat Craft on his own! So the boys take a train all the way to Yamagata just to see Craft. He understands the situation but if they really want the key, they have to defeat him. Of course Craft is only acting. Knowing that Baka can hear what they say, he types in his laptop his true feelings. So the kids pretend to fight him and he feigns defeat as he hands over the key. But, how to use it? Craft has no idea. They call Tachibana and she too is lost. Craft can’t stand this farce anymore and proclaims he is going to defect. So he calls his men back to help. One of them knows how but the final password is the girl you like? Oh yeah. Momochi with so many girlfriends… Good luck naming them all! Oh, just missed one out… Akagawa would like to keep it on so the kids return home. You might think it is the end of it but it’s not. Next day in school, the boys can’t bring themselves to throw away their wristbands. That is when they suddenly disappear. Courtesy of Baka again as he teleports them to a world he created solely for playing RPG! Demon Lord Quest VII! So like in any RPG, they walk around town and talk to NPCs until a flag is triggered. Demon Lord’s armies are abound and so they must head to the castle to defeat him. But first, they need to level up. The kids cast away their seriousness and enjoy all the silly powers that come with it. Once they have level up high enough (in fact, too high), it’s time to head to the castle. And can Baka stop singing this Colour Ranger theme song already!\n\nEpisode 7\n\nTachibana knows the quintet are missing because of Baka. If they don’t come back tomorrow, the prince will know what’s coming for him. So the boys now see the king who tells them his problem. A Demon Lord’s general, Luci has fallen in love with his daughter. He wants them to protect his princess and if they so wish, can marry her. Guess who is the princess? Baka cross-dressed! Can’t blame the kids for beating him up. However he explains that they cannot leave this planet unless they clear this game or at least the console is within the Demon Lord’s castle. With Luci here to take his bride, the kids put up a brave front as instructed by Baka. If they are strong and worthy enough, Luci will back down. However he displays his terrifying power. Baka realizes something is wrong and only the Demon Lord has modified this. Baka agrees to go with Luci as he tells the kids to head to the shrine. As the boys fight their way there, Baka tries to stall for time by confusing Luci. He also relays some game info to them and an important one being the Demon Lord fears the game ending more than they do since it will be the end of this world. Once Baka gives Luci the slip, he rendezvous with the boys at the shrine. At this time all the monsters have surround it although they cannot enter. But a strange figure soon enters. He is the Demon Lord! OMG, is this a child version of Baka?! Though, he is weak as f*ck. Surprisingly, Baka hands over the console for with a choice to end this game. However he wants them to hear him out and in hops they won’t end it. He starts off explaining he has no memories except being the Demon Lord when he was born. He studied and read lots of books and soon came to learn Baka is his creator. Yes, a despicable person. Because he doesn’t wish to become like him, thus this action of his. He wants to make this world where monsters can freely do as they wish. The boys believe in him and won’t end the game. However only Baka disagrees because this won’t achieve his true objective of being entertained! As he continues ranting about all the juicy stuffs that includes some hidden weapon, the boys summon that golden hammer and send him flying into the sky! The boys say goodbye to the Demon Lord as they return home. Don’t worry, Baka is their driver to send them back. Better pay the immense toll to cut short 11.6 billion years to just 3 hours back to Earth! You think the boys’ lives are back to normal but they did not realize if they all gather in class, they will be warp back again to RPG planet! Here we go again. F*ck, Demon Lord Quest IX has Baka taken over as the Demon Lord!\n\nEpisode 8\n\nCraft and his men welcome Princess Saki of Macbac. Looks like it is mating season as it is explained how this race has only females. As the queen can only reproduce, she will set off to find another species to breed. Once she does, she will bear a child and live with her spouse until he dies. But that will also mean the end of the world. In fact, the other species will be wiped out in a few generations. It is most probably a virus transmission and airborne too. It will soon envelope the entire planet and castrate all males! What a way to avoid cheating, huh? Hence Craft and his men are here to do some match-unmaking and convince Saki that this planet is trash. So as they take her and her entourage to the hotel, Craft tries to paint a bad picture of Earth. She’s not fazed. Even when he tries to mention Earthlings can have multiple partners and they cheat often, Saki vows to work hard to achieve her goal. Yeah, nothing is going to stop this woman. Nearby, Satomi breaks up with Mikihisa seeing the latter wants to have sex but the former can’t go through with it. When Mikihisa and Saki cross each other’s path, suddenly they fall in love with each other! Oh no. End of the world? Craft tries to mediate between them as they both don’t speak the same language. Even if he lies and tells the other a different story, Mikihisa and Saki are adamant to be with each other. Eventually the duo give Craft and co the slip. They make a run as the MIBs are hot on their heels. Yup, Mikihisa is even willing to let the world be destroyed than be separated from Saki! You sure about that? Finally the farcical chase ends when Craft has got an important detail on Mikihisa. From a document that Mikihisa dropped, it is revealed that Mikihisa is actually a girl! Kyouko Mikihisa!\n\nEpisode 9\n\nLook at Saki’s disappointed face as she runs away. Flashback shows Mikihisa was always into girls but too bad those girls aren’t bi so they reject her. Craft sees off Saki who will be returning home earlier than scheduled. No hard feelings, it was just all bad luck. Yeah, Craft seems happy to have saved Earth. While it could be a life and death situation for Macbac, not his problem! When they return home, looks like Baka has returned from his South East Asian trip. He knows Craft is hiding something from him and then busts him for not telling him about Saki. Yeah, he bugged the hotel phone and that’s how he knew. Baka knows this is not over yet because as a woman, Saki will not give up so easily. Then he exposes a bugging device on Colin. They’ve been had. But Mikihisa is proven to be a girl, it still won’t solve their breeding woes. Baka then talks some biological mumbo jumbo about Mikihisa’s brain being wired as a man. From what I understand, Macbac is going to turn Mikihisa into a man to erase this blunder. And looks like Craft is too late to stop Mikihisa as he has been lured into the Macbac’s ship. Looks like Saki is doing some surgery to Mikihisa’s body too. More Mikihisa flashback as we see her adamantly telling others she is a guy but they laugh it off or don’t believe. Now we see her back in her apartment, no recollections of anything as she goes about her daily life. Baka and co are spying observing her. Mikihisa may look like a woman now as the surgery will take some time to come into effect. The reason they altered Mikihisa’s memories is so that Saki can redo that love at first sight encounter, something that Macbac all believe in. One day, Baka and co kidnap Mikihisa to administer some vaccine. Luckily they run simulation and it seems doing so will further propagate the virus. You wouldn’t think Macbac would be so dumb to confidently release Mikihisa back on Earth, right? So they return Mikihisa back to his normal life. A few months later, Mikihisa and Saki cross paths. They fall in love and begin their dating. Baka and co are cool about it. As explained, this Mikihisa is a clone they made! It even has some anti-virus programmed in it. The real Mikihisa was swapped out and moved to a faraway city. Win-win situation as Saki gets to mate while the real Mikihisa gets to live to be a real man but with modified memories. Only Craft is agonizing over it because doing this is illegal on so many levels. He is further enraged Baka has an alternative but it’s not really a nice one. Because of the pollution and wastes humans created, one day the human genes will change themselves into something else.\n\nEpisode 10\n\nSome unscrupulous guy wants to get his way with this mermaid. Because he lied, suddenly he gets killed. Colour Rangers in the spotlight again? Well, Tachibana announces that Shimizu will be transferring since his family is moving to America. His friends are sad but because Shimizu brushes off like nothing, they develop bad blood. When Shimizu goes home alone, he stumbled an injured Mermaid in the woods. He is not fazed since Tachibana is an alien. Mermaid knows he is telling the truth because if he lied, her tongue will instantly pierce and kill him. Instead of accepting his help, she tells him to go back and make up with his friends. He does so but pleads to his friend to help Mermaid since she has this lonely look. When they return, she is gone. The friends continue to argue until Akagawa blows his top that they should remain friends until they part. With the quintet reconciled, they go find Mermaid and her trail of blood leads them to a shady place. It seems she is working with poachers who make a living selling other living creatures. However they can’t be lying to her otherwise they would be dead by her tongue now. It seems Mermaid’s species were already close to extinct by other poachers. Only 5 of them left. So when this group approached her, Mermaid would gladly do her part in exchange for her friends to be left alone. And so she has been making money for them to earn enough to return home. Of course they can’t earn if they kill her so they plead for her to return to them. Sensing no lies, Mermaid goes to them. However the boys instantly fight back. Don’t need her tongue to detect a lie because these jerks are shady as hell! The poachers transform into their true alien form. If the boys are having a hard time fighting but come out tops, it is thanks to Tachibana in the shadows providing assistance. Eventually the poachers are defeated and the cat is out of the bag. They were using fake voices and that’s why Mermaid couldn’t recognize them. Asking about her brethren, they tell the truth that they have sold them off and are most probably dead. Mermaid kills them. A sad Mermaid thinks she is all alone but the boys don’t think so. They introduce themselves before Mermaid returns to the sea. Good news, her fellow mermaids still alive. Shimizu reveals his true feelings that he doesn’t want to go to USA. How will he let his parents know? Well, good news too. As some higher up jerk in the company got killed, thus those relocation won’t be happening. What’s so refreshing about this episode? Not a nose of Baka!\n\nEpisode 11\n\nYoshitaka and his baseball team are on a bus to the koshien stadium. But suddenly, they find themselves in an empty one. Twilight zone? A Disckonian alien reports to Craft that he was following the bus and saw it vanish before it eyes. So they went to another dimension? The baseball members look around the stadium and are confused some facilities are from the stadium but others are from another ballpark. Baka is here to say that they are trapped in someone’s mind. Wait. BAKA IS HERE?! Yeah, he stowed away in the bus trying to be some element of surprise or something. This better not be his doing! As Craft and his men do their investigation, their explanation is also the same as Baka. As far as I understand this confusing analysis, it seems that there was such a similar situation in 1920 when an Englishman and his wife were arguing, the daughter was so tense that she unconsciously absorbed him into her mind. Not until he repented only she let him out. Hence this is some paranormal space created by extreme stress. So yeah, Baka tells everyone to suspect everyone but obviously Yoshitaka knows this is part of his thrill to see everyone turn against each other. The rest thinks whoever the coward was that ran away from this stress, it would be over and would’ve gone home if they had played the game but seeing they are trapped here, they can’t do that. Then it seems the opposing team comes in so our players take to the field. So we see snippets of the game as Baka continues more of his psychological analysis that I don’t get. Miho explains to Craft that when she joins swimming tournaments, she does image training to clear her mind. So that isn’t stress but concentration. F*ck, don’t understand this consciousness and stimuli thingy! Baka coming up with some evil solutions to get out so Yoshitaka bats him away. Next thing we know, we see his team back in the real world and playing their game. A great ending for everybody and Craft can’t help he is so much relieved. Did he forget something? Ah yes, Baka somehow still trapped in that dream world…\n\nEpisode 12\n\nLook who has come to visit Earth now? Why, it is Baka’s younger brother, Mohan and Baka’s fiancée, Princess Luna Mi Mad Magra. You bet they are here to bring Baka back for him to get married. Obviously that prince is now seeking refuge at Yukitaka’s place. You see, during the conference, Baka put in a secret bill and the congress passed it. This means Mohan will inherit the throne instead of Baka. Obviously the congress doesn’t want Baka to be the next king but Mohan doesn’t get it as he believes his role is to support the king. With only a month left before Baka becomes an adult, Mohan plans to make Baka go through the wedding ceremony before the throne falls on Mohan. Hence Baka is confident Craft and his men are on his side. Baka is doing this because he wants his freedom and not bound by royalty duties. He didn’t expect Mohan and Luna to fly up to this place to make their announcement for him to get married. Baka flees as Mohan gives chase but eventually gives up. Luna requests to stay at Yukitaka’s place in hopes Baka will return here. Can Yukitaka host a princess? Don’t worry, Mohan will stay here too. Yukitaka realizes both brothers are the same. Baka’s side rendezvous with Ranzo as Craft suggests fleeing in their escape pod. However Baka notes doing so means it will be easier for him to catch. He suspects something amiss. Why didn’t Mohan use his military and it’s like it is clearing the way for him to escape. Baka then reveals the entire Earth is covered with some barrier as the clouds remain the same. Through some device, it reveals tons of spaceships hovering outside Earth’s orbit! Mohan has found him and reveals those spaceships are guests of the wedding. Mohan hopes Baka would come back as Luna is waiting for him as she believes in him. It is then Baka throws the question if Mohan likes Luna. Meanwhile Luna talks to Yukitaka and Miho about the political relationship between both nations. She also explains how she was betrothed to Baka at a very young age. She never heard his voice until one day she solved some hard question that got his attention. It was then she wanted to stay with him forever. Despite all the nasty rumours, she still wants to be with him because if she had given up, then he would give up on all that too. Back home, Yukitaka trying to get Baka to reciprocate Luna’s feelings since he heard it all. Baka trying to be funny that Yukitaka might have fallen for her! With Miho suspecting they have been bugged, Baka then discovers tons of spying equipment all over the place. The spy for Luna is Colin.\n\nEpisode 13\n\nThe gang realizes Luna could be a psycho for Baka. There is a thick envelope of documents that may look like weird and bad Japanese writings but Baka deciphers a secret code from Luna to meet up. As they talk about the weird royalty customs of not seeing each other’s siblings for many years, then it hit Baka. This Luna and Mohan are imposters! There is a resistance group on Magra called Magra Freedom Alliance that aims for a bloodless revolution to be freed from Dogra’s rule. So what has this got to do with Baka’s marriage? By marrying the fake, the wife would then request her husband to free Magra, something he cannot refuse. We see the fake Luna eavesdropping on them. She purposely let them find some of the bugging devices but can’t believe Baka figured out so quickly. Baka shows Yukitaka and Miho the alien spaceships all hovering outside Earth’s orbit. Baka then realizes why he managed to escape from his ship so easily. Why was he placed to observe Earth at the conference. This was all to lock him down on Earth because had he gone back to Dogra, it will be hard to get him. Besides there are other races like Disckonian and Macbac who dislike Dogra too. Speaking of which, those Disckonian have captured Craft and Sado. Craft thinks they are on board with Baka and this is just an act! Sorry, you’re so wrong this time. Although they get locked in, they manage to escape and then free the real Luna and Mohan held captive within the ship. Baka’s plan is now to lure out and expose the imposter. Meeting up, Baka wants to know if she is the real deal because Luna has 2 moles on her right shoulder. There it is. He instantly knows she is fake because Luna actually has 3 moles. Knowing she was eavesdropping, he fed her fake info. Mohan loses his cool and decides to attack Baka, against Luna’s advice. However Baka easily dodges it all and claims he is weaker than Craft. With all the gang here, the imposters are captured. However there is one issue now: The imposter has put on the wedding ring that cannot be taken off. How? Well, Baka will just marry the imposter and puts on his wedding ring! His plan is to have a revolution in his kingdom and leave the state affairs to Mohan. However there is a real twist to all this: The imposters are actually the real ones! You see, when the imposters hijacked the ship, Mohan and Luna easily beat up their asses! To make this more interesting, the real Luna suggested this plan and played her psycho part to perfection. Hence Baka actually married the real princess. With that, aliens all over show themselves and Earthlings are going to be awed by all those motherships.\n\nLevel E-diot! Jokes On Yous!\n\nOh wow. Did Baka for the first time get outsmarted?! Or was he pretending to be so because we’ve been conditioned that it is him who will always get the last laugh no matter what. Well, he seems pretty cool about it but we’re still waiting for him to spring that last minute surprise that he knew the imposter was actually the real princess all along! Still waiting… So I guess that calm demeanour means he really got pranked this time, eh? Oh wow. Feeling conflicted now. On one hand, good to see the idiot prince get his just desserts but on the other hand, it just feels so strange that Baka got pranked! Now I know how Craft feels!\n\nAs you can see, there isn’t much of a coherent plot. Most of the episodes are episodic in nature and standalone random fillers. Or at least mini arcs divided into a few episodes at most. Imagine if the entire season was one long prank (to play an impractical joke on Yukitaka), I wonder if that would be distasteful and no longer funny. So by the third episode, the punch line was revealed, thus setting the pace of what the rest of the series should be. In retrospect, I think this format is good for this series as once the gag is over, we can move on to the next without having so much to worry about bringing forward whatever happened in that arc. Which is also good as in many cases, there will be scientific and long mumbo jumbo explanations about some sci-fi or psychological stuffs which I don’t get. Uh huh. Perhaps to make the punch line to the prank look more creditable and believable, they can even fool us with some fake details and we wouldn’t know! All I know is that at the end of the day, the prince got us good. Heh.\n\nI wanted to draw comparisons of this series with Gintama. However, that similarity is only because aliens are living among humans on Earth. Unlike Gintama, a big majority of humans are unaware of aliens walking among them. Just like in MIB (the Hollywood movie). Furthermore, trying to compare Baka with Gintoki of Gintama is like comparing apples to oranges. Same category of fruit but different type. Yes, both are idiots and clowns but other than that, they are so vastly different. Oh sorry, apple is technically not a fruit if you want to go by its strictest definition… Sorry folks, Baka isn’t your handsome blond prince on a white steed but a cheeky alien from outer space!\n\nSo the prince thinks he can always get away with it in the end because he is so smart. Yeah well, we have only ourselves to blame since we are too stupid to get the hint. Like as though he has a script in hand since he seems like he knows everything when he explains his stuffs without breaking into a sweat and so confidently. I won’t be surprised if it is actually the case! But if it’s not, oh well, being a genius is lonely and that is why he has to resort to such pranks to keep himself entertained. To us, those pranks may look childish and dumb but remember, I guess we’re all not intelligent enough or at his level to comprehend him. He isn’t a bad person per se. Just a whole lot mischievous. He is like playing both the hero and the villain all at once. I am sure we have asked why he doesn’t use his exceptional intelligence for the sake of the universe. Maybe he did. We just didn’t see it. After all, how much do we understand the protocols and other stuffs that royalties need to adhere to? So if you put yourself in Baka’s shoes, perhaps it is only right to take out a little bit of stress and having some fun in his own way. Okay, maybe he is just a total (but intelligent) idiot to begin with. Hope he is entertained! Yeah, with Earth as his personal playground, I see no reason for him to hold back. Even if he does, he won’t. It’s Baka we’re talking about.\n\nAnd to think that he is aptly named so in Japanese but I guess at the end of the day, we are the baka ones and the jokes are on us. Is it because he is named so and that he is only trying to live up to it! Thank goodness he doesn’t have a brother named Aho! I can see the mayhem that comes after! Imagine what is worse than having an idiotic prankish prince? Why, having 2 of them! The universe won’t be enough to handle them! I don’t think God can even handle them, let alone Baka. I can’t fathom to think Baka will outwit God! So a note to aliens, next time you want to name your prince or princess, please enlighten yourself with the cultures of others first. Especially Japanese. Yeah.\n\nYukitaka looks like a tortured soul ever since Baka came into his life but from the looks of it, his character feels a lot secondary as we see him in the initial and last arcs. His torment is nothing compared to what Craft has gone through. It is evident that without seeing the kind of pranks Craft gets on his end, we know how much Craft has suffered under his highness. More than often, a visibly frustrated Craft does not hesitate to blow his top and grab Baka by the collar or the likes. Proof that he has had it with all the shenanigans. We can sometimes see his dark thoughts of Baka seep through and it is like he is caught between the dilemma of serving him as well as wanting to see him receive his just desserts. Most probably the latter for the good of everybody. The whole universe can use one less of a prankish jokester, right? But then again, the universe would be one prankish jokester less and boring. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Hang in there, Craft. You’re doing a fine job for all our sakes as Baka’s punching bag! But for his colleagues, I don’t see them as tormented as him. Sado is just a biological freak while Colin looks like some naïve nice guy. Still waters run deep. Will Yukitaka become the next Craft if Baka overstays his welcome? Only time will tell.\n\nOddly, a bunch of Colour Ranger kids in the fray, I wonder what kind of relevance they have to the whole series. Perhaps none at all actually. Maybe they’re just to fill in some extra time? You see, this series was based on a very short manga that only has 3 volumes. I believe all (if not most of) the manga chapters have been adapted into the anime. Without these kids, the whole story could have been a lot shorter. But yeah, the irony that these kids are a lot mature compared to Baka and that Dogra prince is like a kid stuck in an adult’s body. Don’t laugh. It is true for many of us who refuse to grow up. Uh huh. There is always a kid in all of us. Miho is just like Yukitaka, not really relevant to the story. Jumped to the conclusion there would be some sort of romance going on but nothing. Nothing is going to take away the spotlight on Baka, right?\n\nLast but not least, Luna. As we have seen, she is the person who understands Baka the most and is most suited for him. After all, it takes a genius or a crazy person to understand each other, right? It proves that she wasn’t a sheltered princess and that she is a very dedicated person. Uh huh. If this turned out the wrong way, we would have called her some psycho b*tch stalker or something. In the end, the only person who could live up to Baka’s expectations or keep up with his shenanigans. The best person to also keep him in check? But I fear one day they will take their pranks and outdo each other to a whole new galactic level. In the sense, the Mr & Mrs Smith (the Hollywood movie) of the universe!\n\nArt and animation are rather okay although it reeks the style of the last decade. Which is probably better than the quality of some animes in today’s time! That is saying a lot. Although I have to point out that there are CGI effects. Well, they definitely look like crap! I don’t know if it was done on purpose or it was actually technology limitations at that time. I won’t go so far as to say they really look as bad as recent animes like Kaminaki Sekai No Kamisama Katsudou but they still look cheap. Like those alien spaceships or those smoke effects when a character disappears. Laughable and cringe at times, so much so I got paranoid and thought Baka was behind this! Sorry, rather Pierrot (Naruto, Bleach, Black Clover, Tokyo Ghoul, GTO) and David Production (the Jojo series, Undead Unluck, Hataraku Saibou) did this series.\n\nFor the voice acting, got to hand it to Takehito Koyasu as Craft. He really makes his character sound like a tortured and pent up soul. Poor guy. But kudos and great voice acting. Too bad he didn’t turn into a Jojo badass and beat up that silly prince. Daisuke Namikawa as Baka, he sounds gay at times… Some seiyuus I recognized are Sayaka Ohara making her cameo as Mermaid, Yuu Kobayashi as Mikihisa, Fumihiko Tachiki as the narrator and Satoshi Hino as Mohan. The other casts are Yoshimasa Hosoya as Yukitaka (Reiner in Shingeki No Kyojin), Satomi Akesaka as Miho (Esdeath in Akame Ga Kill), Shouko Nakagawa as Luna (Risa in Akiba’s Trip The Animation), Masaya Takatsuka as Sado (Vetto in Black Clover), Takumi Asahina as Colin (Etsuji Kainuma in The Fable), Ao Takahashi as Saki (Riko in Minami-ke) and Sayaka Kinoshita as Tachibana (Mirko in Boku No Hero Academia).\n\nThe opening theme is Cold Finger Girl by Chiaki Kuriyama. This song is weird. Or should I say a mess. I’m not sure if it is trying to parody James Bond’s Goldfinger. I think not. However this rock piece starts to get noisy, chaotic and at some points, the singer sounds off. If that isn’t weird enough, there’ll soon be some gay guy’s soft voice singing as her accompaniment. Sounds like Baka. Is it him?! And did she say, “Sh*t’s down” at the end?! Oh… Oh… It is, “Sit down”… F*ck… Oh well, if you want some hard rock, then the ending theme is Yume ~Mugen No Kanata~ by Vivid is your cup of tea. Not so much for me, though. Still too noisy-cum-generic for my liking.\n\nOverall, a pretty entertaining series in its own right. Well, if you can laugh at the sci-fi jokes and pranks this series has to offer. Sort of. Nowhere near a masterpiece and sometimes it is infuriating as well as annoying when you have a handsome main character who is both a joker and an intelligent being. A wise guy? Yeah, I guess that is because we peasants don’t really understand him. After all, life is too short to take things way seriously. Always have fun. Okay, maybe way too much fun here. Lots of people here have been toyed around for Baka’s and our amusement. Are you not entertained?! I know I am and still laughing since my whole life is a big fat joke! HAHAHA!!! Oh dear, that’s not funny. It’s just sad… :’(.\n\nWill this season be it? The season whereby Ichikawa finally kills Yamada and mutilates her body into many parts before dumping it into the sea! Fulfilling his lifelong dream of seeing her face writhe in pain before ending her life! F*ck what?! Holy OMFG sh*t, what alternative timeline did I go too?! Sorry folks and (un)fortunately, Boku No Kokoro No Yabai Yatsu S2 no longer has the premise of Ichikawa having that inner bloodthirsty drive in wanting to kill our popular tall model girl in his class. Such a shame. And because of that, what we are going to expect most out of this sequel is how much closer they will bond together and realizing the feelings for each other is actually love. Time to turn fantasy into reality. But with a whole load of awkwardness.\n\nEpisode 13\n\nThe teacher thinks Yamada should help Ichikawa with stuffs since she sits next to him considering he broke his arm. Ichikawa dismisses they are that close and can do everything himself. Only, Yamada heard it! Oh boy, does she look mad? At the end of the day, he goes to apologize to her. She makes him say what he is apologizing for! He does so but she already knew. And just like that, she’s back to normal. Yamada continues to help Ichikawa in everything. The boys notice Yamada in the magazine. Or maybe someone who looks like her? Ichikawa tries to show off that he knows she also appears in other media but realizes he should shut his big mouth. Then at the convenience story with Yamada, they open that same magazine and she pretends that’s not her. He tries to compliment her but it comes out weird. She believes the person he knows is probably at her best condition. As Hara suspects Ichikawa and Yamada an item, she tries to ask Yamada about it but gets trapped revealing about her time spent with Kanzaki. But eventually observing them, she is getting the hint. Especially the matching doggie keychain souvenir. Ichikawa also believes Hara knows about them but brushes it off that girls talk about such stuffs. With Yamada guilty for not doing a good job looking after him, he tries to distract her with a pic of Kana. Showing other pics, this leads to accidentally revealing how he broke his arm and this makes Yamada feel guilty that she was the cause of it. It gets worse when she loses her keychain. Now she is in despair. So Ichikawa is going to search through the snow?! Where to even start?! Until Sekine points out the path Yamada often takes home. The duo bump into each other. She is really distressed about it as he assures he will find it. As luck would have it, he spots it on a nearby tree branch. Yamada so happy. Yamada invites him to her place to warm up.\n\nEpisode 14\n\nSo yes, Ichikawa getting conscious he is butt naked in Yamada’s place and in her bath. Try not to overthink. Once he is done, she lends him her jersey to wear but he has to go commando. You don’t expect him to wear her pantsu, DO YOU???!!! It gets worse since Yamada is dressing like a slut so a few clumsy moments there for some close proximity. Then as she cooks nabe, she talks about her younger days. All the lessons she took, she quit after a while and she got bothered everyone else got better than her. It took her a while to realize everyone was being nice and she was a burden. She starts crying that she might make these people she scare to hate her. Especially that day Ichikawa was absent for a couple of days from the library, she thought that was it. Ichikawa quickly hugs her as she continues crying. He admits he did that because he didn’t want to be hurt or get hated. In the end, they are very much alike. Yamada soon realizes mom will be home since she got texted. Ichikawa is left to hide in her room and even pretend to be Sekine since mom thinks her friend is over. Once the coast is clear, Ichikawa leaves but on the way out meets a giant guy who looks like a serial killer! Better run! Ichikawa hands wash the jersey back home since he doesn’t want to get caught washing Yamada’s jersey via washing machine. At school, Ichikawa realizes something wrong with his voice. He can’t fully speak and it’s like changing. During judo class, Yamada is offended her uniform stinks like hell. Ichikawa and Yamada end up as sparring partners for some awkward grappling moments. Ichikawa notes his voice is changing and wonders if his relationship with Yamada will remain the same if it does. So when he tells her about his cracking voice, she is all excited instead because it is a sign he is growing up. She hopes he will call her name often when his voice sounds deeper. At the same time, he too notices some parts of Yamada really growing. Guess!\n\nEpisode 15\n\nValentine’s Day is coming up. Sekine suggests doing a dry run to make chocolates at her home. Yamada suggests doing it at her place. So why is she hinting at Ichikawa? What’s it got to do with him? Oh right. Looks like he has to come and he is feeling really awkward about it. The only guy among girls. So when they arrive, Yamada’s mom seems suspicious a boy is among them. What is his relation to her daughter? That is when Sekine claims he is her boyfriend. Mom is a bit startled but lets it pass. But I guess Yamada is not happy. Yeah, Ichikawa looking over his shoulders all the time. Yamada is not impressed seeing Sekine has to keep up with this couple thingy and gets real close to him at times. So as Ichikawa excuses himself to the toilet. He thinks of leaving but his inner self tells him not to run because a miracle might happen. Like he might end up dating Yamada. Ichikawa rubbishes that fairytale and leaves. At that point he apologizes to mom for lying. Mom isn’t mad but then realizes he is Ichikawa since her daughter often talked about him. With Yamada taking over, Ichikawa changes his mind and returns. But now all the girls are scared! Oh man, it’s that giant guy making chocolates with them! Scary. Yup, he is Yamada’s dad and works as a French chef. Looks like he wants to be friends with Ichikawa and play video games? Yeah, hard to be the only male around. Don’t judge a book by its cover. When he ties his hair up, he is handsome as f*ck! Yamada lets Ichikawa taste her sample. Good. She is glad he came. Back home, Yamada calls Ichikawa for his opinion on his parents. Good people. She thinks it’s the same because her parents also gave the same boring answer about Ichikawa. Kana learns her brother got a harem. Cheekily asking if he is going to ask Yamada out. Almost choke on his drink. Ichikawa talks basically comparing his nobody self to a big important person like Yamada who lives in a bigger world. He likes her but feels he can’t keep up with it. After Kana gives him some advice, Ichikawa says he wants to be Yamada’s boyfriend. This embarrassment causes both siblings to cringe hard.\n\nEpisode 16\n\nSekine gives everyone her chocolates. Including Ichikawa. However Yamada snatches and eats it. She claims she is a boy today! Oh well, better than being Adachi who is acting like a country bumpkin after receiving a single chocolate. And to think he was calling for the banning of obligatory chocolates… Later Yamada and Ichikawa play shogi using their chocolates. Winner takes it all. Then at the store, they talk about chocolates and all. Yamada shares her bun with him but spots a filling on his face. Sorry, not going to lick it off like we expected. Or perhaps she chickened out and used her finger. She leaves and fails to give her chocolates to him. But then he buys one for her, claiming she is a guy today. Back home he is squirming over this embarrassing move. Later that night Yamada calls him to join her walking her dog. After a while and a few awkward moments, Ichikawa hinting he doesn’t hate sweet stuffs as claimed. And then some talk about obligatory chocolates before Yamada shares half her chocolate muffin with him. Since he finds it good, it brings her to tears because she thought she couldn’t get it right. She wants another one and that means he has to hug her. Ichikawa returns home and realizes Yamada could be in love with him. Would you like to know? Next day in class, Adachi making a big fuss on what to return for White Day. Wow. This guy is thinking about lingerie?! Sekine passing by and giving hints and she wants. Expensive… To Adachi’s surprise, he learns Ichikawa has gotten real chocolates from a girl. Jealous guy thinks that girl is ugly! Adachi is even asking Nanjou for his opinion for White Day. Lingerie? Is he joking? Ichikawa trying to claim he doesn’t understand girls and that’s why boys and girls can never know each other well. As they part, Yamada waves at Ichikawa. Then she sees Nanjou with him and stops. Nanjou is about to wave back but Ichikawa stops him and waves on his behalf? Before Ichikawa could tell Nanjou he likes Yamada, the girl rushes down to take him away. I hope Nanjou gets the picture now.\n\nEpisode 17\n\nYamada trying to ask Ichikawa to go see a movie that a fellow actress in the same agency is in. Lots of awkward moments between them and eventually he agrees to go. Before the movie, to go grab something to eat. Well, well, didn’t know Kana is working at this takoyaki shop! Definitely looking like a date! And for some reason they go in and eat?! Couldn’t they just pick somewhere else? Yamada being a noob eating a takoyaki so Ichikawa has to teach her. Once done, Kana gladly covers their bill. Maybe she wants to hear his story later… As they watch the movie, this reminds Ichikawa he saw one similar over the internet. It was only because Yamada had a cameo in it. Then there’s a long kissing scene. Ichikawa is in shock but he notices Yamada in awe. Since Yamada gave him the permission, he wakes up early to go see her in work. When he sees her talking to a hot colleague, he runs away?! Yeah, all the stuffs Yamada gets must be so high quality. Think of throwing this low quality convenience store gift? Not so fast. His inner self is stopping him. Surprisingly Yamada comes to get him. Yamada claims she is having a hard time since she’s always facing trouble. She doesn’t know how she keeps up with it. Ichikawa notes if she is happy, so would he. But why does this hurt so much? He theorizes if Yamada was just an ordinary high school girl and had none of this, then perhaps he wouldn’t have fallen for her. It’s a lame excuse but whatever. He grabs her hand and rushes back to the shooting area. Hot colleague not impressed seeing them holding hands as Yamada introduces Ichikawa. Turns out this hot colleague is her manager, Yuuki Suwa. Ichikawa also meets some of the other staffs. Yeah, their real character is so different. When Yamada returns to shooting, Suwa talks to Ichikawa. He is like Yamada’s guardian and knows a lot of her. Yamada being the honest girl, tells everything including Ichikawa. That’s why he knows he is her pride and joy. However he cautious that she is now at an important stage. Get the hint when he claims how relationship will hinder her work? That is when Ichikawa holds the horses. He clears the air they are not dating as he just admires her. Suwa feeling embarrassed because he thought he knew! Ichikawa is surprised this is what they look like to others. He also notes this childishness is precisely why he hates himself. When shooting is over, Ichikawa shows Yamada a pic he secretly took of her. She thinks he should’ve taken a better shot but he claims she is beautiful in this one. Uhm. What? Oh.\n\nEpisode 18\n\nThe teacher asks Ichikawa to represent the grade and give a farewell speech for the seniors. Well, he is somewhat the top of his grade. Seeing there is no one to take that place for rehearsal, Ichikawa agrees to do it just for practice. So when he takes to the stage, suddenly he gets stage fright and mumbles his way through. And he blames the sound system has problems! Later Yamada tries to help him practice give his speech since it’s part of her job. But it is soon cut short when they hear a girl trying to confess to Nanjou nearby. He rejects her and claims he likes somebody else. This gives Ichikawa the resolve that he will do the speech to make everyone see that he can stand proud. Well, his practice run before his mom at him is pathetic. Even Kana is roped in to help. As part of it all, he even gets a new haircut. Then his speech seems better. Hey, mom is crying so it must be good, right?! With his new haircut, Yamada and her pals try to give his new look a new makeover. Maybe the old style is still the best. This brings up the topic that they may be in separate classes for next year. On graduation day, looks like Ichikawa forgot his script! Had to call Kana to rush all the way down. If she knows the way to his school! So it’s time for his speech. How will he do it without a script? It is his inner self then who likes him the most and all this time is him! So look at him! With that, suddenly Ichikawa becomes a pro and delivers a flawless speech about moving on and to love yourself! OMG! Don’t even need a script! After that he collapses and needs to rest in the infirmary. Yamada comes to see him but Nanjou too. It seems he want to talk with Yamada. Basically to confess he loves her but she rejects him seeing there is someone else she likes. Ichikawa realizing Yamada loves him. We figured it out ages ago! And so that is graduation for Nanjou as he tries to tell a little lie as he leaves but Yamada won’t be falling for it. He did so because he doesn’t want Yamada to fall for him out of pity. It gets strange and confusing because an embarrassed Ichikawa and Yamada both leave the infirmary and go separate ways.\n\nEpisode 19\n\nIchikawa’s speech video may just go viral. Kana now teasing him if he has got the guts to say I love you to the girl he likes! The class seems to be having some karaoke outing. Not sure if Ichikawa is left out but he gets concerned since Yamada is joining. So he tails them and even eavesdrops next door? Some girls spot him and usher him in but he baulks and runs back. This is when Yamada comes to join him. Awkward but she asks if he heard her saying she likes someone. Both acting shy but the gig is up when they notice others are watching. And so Ichikawa is ushered in as the VIP and being made to sing. Cheers to his speech! At school, Hara asks Yamada and Ichikawa if they are free to go out this weekend. Ichikawa may not want to join until she hints it is White Day. Yeah, time to repay. Strangely, this request was made by Kanzaki. Ichikawa meets up with Hara on that day and seeing they have time, they shop around for stuffs. Hara puts on a hat and asks his opinion. He notes she is cute but damn, Yamada and Kanzaki are here! Oh sh*t! Yamada not too happy. Worse, Kanzaki having jealous and wants to kill him! It’s tough being in Ichikawa’s position. Kanzaki wants him to acknowledge Hara’s cuteness but not. Hara seems to be mindful of what she eats. The reason Kanzaki called the duo out so with Yamada around, Hara won’t be conscious. It doesn’t matter if she is thin or fat, he will still love her! Wow. He said that aloud. Yamada greatly hinting at Ichikawa! With that, Hara doesn’t hold back and returns to her normal self after Kanzaki hands her a cutlery set he bought with Yamada. Oh, now Ichikawa’s turn to be jealous and tell him to lay off Yamada? Because she belongs to him. Oh Yamada, you heard that? On the way back, Hara lets Ichikawa and Yamada be alone. Lots of awkward moment and hesitation until Ichikawa decides to finally man up and just think of Yamada. He gives her a muffin. She is so happy she starts eating it right away! Woah! Slow down! Because there is a bracelet accessory inside. Yamada wants him to put it on. Lovely. So cute he could die. Oh, you just made her cry.\n\nEpisode 20\n\nAdachi feels so reluctant to give his White Day chocolates to Sekine. He just nonchalantly tosses it into her shoebox and leaves. It falls out and Ichikawa is forced to put it back. Of course Yamada and Sekine walk in at the right time to see this. He tries to explain himself but it seems Adachi’s mom is here and forces her son to actually give the chocolates with proper manners. While that is settled, unfortunately Ichikawa couldn’t explain in time the letter inside it. So when Yamada reads the flirty letter, she thought it was from Ichikawa instead of Adachi. Kobayashi fears that the next school term they will be in different classes. So she feigns by not being friends with her friends. Not sure if that will work out… After class, Ichikawa and Yamada play a little basketball. He will confess to her if he nails it in. He misses. Although Yamada assists and scores her own, an excuse that doesn’t count. Yamada tries to get permission to call him Kyo. Back home, Ichikawa’s mind is all over the place because of this. Thinking of having sex with her while she calls him by that name?! Even his inner ego is trying to convince him to accept it! On Ichikawa’s birthday, Yamada hangs out with him. However she doesn’t realize it is his birthday until they stumble into Ichikawa’s dad on his way home. Care to join? And so Yamada joins his family over dinner. Kana doesn’t want to hand over his present now but he insists. Oh well. It’s some playboy bunny figurine! After the birthday cake and he blows the candles, Yamada whispers Kyo in his ear and it instantly kills him! Since it is getting late, Kana suggests she stays here. Both their moms give the approval so yeah, Ichikawa gonna panic since Yamada will be using the bath first. Kana lending her clothes and even pantsu. Yamada asking for rubber meant the band to tie her hair! Not the condom! Awkward moments as Ichikawa gives it to her in the bath. So the sleepover, Yamada not sleeping with Kana but in the living room? Oh well. Ichikawa checks on her studying her acting script. They talk for a while and she gives him a little hug. When she is asleep, Ichikawa thinking of doing something? Too bad he got no balls so he just covers her blanket and leaves.\n\nEpisode 21\n\nYamada is away at Hiroshima for a film shoot. Meanwhile Ichikawa notices the pics Yamada uploaded to her social media. Some are pics at his place! His worst fears comes true since the sharp fans start to nit-pick and question about it. Then there is poster called pigman who is literally like some obsessed stalker. Hence Ichikawa creates a fake alias to post on pigman’s comment to delete the post but got instantly blocked. In between breaks, Yamada manages to contact and talk to Ichikawa but usually the calls end abruptly since her mom comes in so she had to put away the phone. At one point, this made her drop her phone into the water. With the sudden cut off, this made Ichikawa very worried. So worried that he makes an excuse to go to Yamada’s place just to see what his dad would say! Of course dad gets a call from Yamada about her dropped phone. She then draws a map in what seems to be Ichikawa’s place. Dad then passes the phone for Ichikawa to talk to Yamada. Surprised to hear his voice? Once the conversation ends, Ichikawa tells Yamada’s dad that he is in love with Yamada. Likewise, Yamada tells her mom she loves Ichikawa. The parents seem cool with it. Yamada’s dad giving Ichikawa his gamer code. When Yamada is back, Ichikawa realizes she is not out of danger because the pigman strikes again by posting he is close to Yamada now. Ichikawa rushes over only to see her with a model colleague, Nico Kouda. As Ichikawa joins them in this ramen store, based on Nico’s interactions and her reactions, he realizes she is pigman! So basically she admires Yamada a lot but Ichikawa warns her to stop uploading Yamada’s private info online. Though, she claims she doesn’t know what he is talking about. As Yamada apologizes for the phone incident that made Ichikawa worried, he is more concerned about the photos she take and hopes she will be mindful when taking them because there are lots of people who want to bring her down. Yamada assures him that she wants to become more adult-like. Ichikawa’s inner mind teasing him about becoming an adult.\n\nEpisode 22\n\nA new school year. Seniors now. Are the gang going to be in separate classes? Well, good news for Ichikawa and Yamada. Same class. They’re so happy and being so class, others are staring at them. She tries to pass off being close to Sekine instead but nobody is buying it. But Kobayashi is in despair. Her name is not in this class list but not on any class! Did she transfer out?! So they consult the teacher. Some error made, she is in the same class with them. Phew! There are also some new faces like Yurine Hanzawa and Kanna Andou. I bet Adachi is frustrated since he and other Ichikawa’s guy pals aren’t in this class with all the beauties! Ichikawa and Yamada are fooling around in class and had to hide underneath the teacher’s desk when Sekine came in with Hanzawa and Andou. They talk about some couple breaking up. After they leave, as Ichikawa tries to leave, the cramp space has Yamada accidentally pull down his pants! Sekine returns! She’s done trying to cover for them! Later there’s this weird friendship blossoming between Yamada and Andou and how they want to address each other. Ichikawa and Yamada measure their heights using the library shelves. Uhm, is this legal? Marking with a permanent marker. Ichikawa then mentions some romantic-like stuffs to make her blush as he wants to get close to her. Physically. He meant stature. Oh. Then they huddle close behind the curtains. Something steamy going on. Ichikawa wants to confess to her but it seems Hanzawa has seen all this. She leaves in shock that she becomes clumsy and drops her stuff. When the class shuffles their seats, Hanzawa purposely switches places with Yamada so she can be with Ichikawa at the back. After class, Ichikawa sees a letter in Hanzawa’s book. It is written by Yamada trying to explain she isn’t dating Ichikawa but a shy person. They spent a lot of time together so he’s important to her. Hence she shouldn’t worry about them and let them be. Later Hanzawa talks to Yamada about love since she is interested to know what it’s like. Yamada will teach her all about it but she gets embarrassed and runs away.\n\nEpisode 23\n\nTime for the sports festival. Ichikawa is being invited to be the knight for the kibasen. Is it because he is puny? Anyway, he turns him down. Adachi is bragging to Ichikawa about how cool Yamada was during last year’s sports but he isn’t listening. Yamada checks Ichikawa’s arm and it seems last year’s scar is still there. Seeing how close they are, Adachi gets jealous and wants Ichikawa to join the kibasen and go head to head with each other. Ichikawa agrees. So we see Ichikawa doing some training at Yamada’s place. Knowing Adachi likes Yamada, he knows this is a challenge over her. But of course Ichikawa doesn’t want to lose this either. The sports day gets underway as we see snippets of the event. One of the highlights include Andou needing a pair of lovers for the scavenger race so she picks Yamada’s parents (because Yamada doesn’t want to be picked and suggested them)?! Embarrassing. She got disqualified. Then there’s some net crawling game that just protrudes all of Yamada’s delicious parts. Adachi breathing hard! When it is time for the kibasen, it starts to rain. As the teachers deliberate to whether it should continue, Adachi and Ichikawa vouch for it to go on since the boys are only participating. So we see Ichikawa and Adachi go head to head with each other. Adachi admitting he likes Yamada but is soon shot down by Ichikawa who tells him off not to claim he likes Yamada when he doesn’t know a damn thing about her. She is more grown up than them. You can’t like someone who is just cute. That is now what love is all about. Adachi knows it and admits his loss. He wants to go down like a man but Ichikawa won’t let him take the easy way out since he started this fight. If he is serious about Yamada, fight for it! Because Ichikawa screams he loves Yamada. Thank goodness the rain drowned out the sound, eh? In the end, both guys go down hard. Yamada sees Ichikawa in the infirmary. Adachi knows he lost so he leaves. A little consolation as Sekine gives him a towel. A wet one. Ultimate loser because he tries to hit on Kana but she’s not impressed. Yamada talks to Ichikawa about disappointment and moving on. He realizes this is what he has been hiding all the time. She gives him eat her lunch. Tastes great. Then she notes how cool he was.\n\nEpisode 24\n\nTime for the school field trip to Kyoto and Nara. Kanzaki hinting to Ichikawa about joining in with their friends so Ichikawa goes to talk to Yamada about it and she is glad to have him. But her friends point out, they’re choosing for roommates. Uhm? What? Yeah, Kanzaki meant this other male buddy. Embarrassing! Back home as Ichikawa thinks about this trip, his inner self comes to mess with him about kissing Yamada! Yamada calls him about the trip but upon realizing something, she cuts it short. During the train trip there, Hanzawa warns Ichikawa about Andou as she is planning to pair some couples during the trip. She has made confetti and already taught her pals to do a flash mob. Yamada x Ichikawa pair is her top target. At the famous deer park, all the deer almost rape Yamada. Sorry, Ichikawa can’t help you. Ichikawa then notices Kobayashi a bit serious. Something about Yamada making the choice so there is nothing much she can do. This confuses Ichikawa but he would like to know how Yamada feels. During bath time, WTF Adachi wants to have a dick showdown?! But what about the girls? Yeah, everyone is afraid of Yamada. Don’t deserve to be in the same room, let’s get out! When Yamada and Ichikawa meet after bath, Andou sees this the perfect opportunity but luckily with Adachi walking in, they are saved. Ichikawa notes the final volume for Kimi-iro Octave comes out the day after tomorrow. Bugging inner self tells him to kiss Yamada like as per one of the volumes. Just focus on how to make the kiss happen! As the girls are staying a level below the boys, Ichikawa outside his balcony notices Yamada practising lines from that manga. It is only then it hit him hard. She has been practising for an audition since that manga is going to be adapted into anime. This trip coincided with her audition. Ichikawa realizes his dumb ass that she came on this trip because of him. He rushes down the floor below. Luckily Yamada is also there as she quickly takes him to hide in her room and under her covers. Oh man, what’s the only guy doing in a room full of girls?!\n\nEpisode 25\n\nYou believe God is testing you, huh?! The girls start talking about love stories as they try to get Yamada to reveal whom she is crushing. When it is time to sleep, Yamada lies close to him and he is trying to stave off his temptations of his dirty mind. No sex, please! When she tries to kiss him, he notes he wants to talk to her tomorrow. This makes her panic and soon the other girls suspect her blanket is bigger than usual. Luckily, WTF Kanzaki doing Tarzan boy outside???!!! The girls panic and during this chaos, Yamada leads Ichikawa to escape. Next day as Ichikawa wonders how to bring about the talk of her audition, she asks if he is happy. Of course. She is happy to hear it. But why is she putting up this sad face? Then he talks about the audition. She then bursts into tears. She wanted to enjoy this trip with him but can’t help think about the audition. So she thought if he had fun, she would too. She thinks she is self-centred. Ichikawa feels relieved but replies before this, he was a pathetic loner who was never interested in the world until she showed up. Now he has friends he can easily talk to. Now he likes school. It is only so because of her. She showed him this world and helped him see how beautiful it is. And it is beautiful because she is in it! Cue for him to confess he loves her. They have to run since Andou has found them and wants to flash mob. Luckily Kanzaki x Hara pair is there for distraction. Ichikawa brings Yamada to the train station and tells her to go. He will handle how to tell the teachers. Kobayashi is also here to give her final push. Ichikawa returns to see the dumb flash mob over Kanzaki x Hara. Hara not amused and tells them to stop this sh*t! Once the trip is over, Ichikawa returns and wants to see Yamada. Their usual place? It’s the school library of course. Yamada hints the audition didn’t go well and all this exposed her weaknesses and jealousy. However everything around her is so special and thanks to him, he made her realize who she is. Because of that, he is more special than anyone as she too confesses she loves him. Better, will he go out with her? Of course! Can we kiss now? Just Yamada giving a peck on his cheek. Enough to kill him.\n\nCrazy, Stupid, Love… It’s Complicated!\n\nAnd so that is how they finally admit and fall in love with each other. Oh well, it took them long enough. 2 seasons spanning over 25 episodes but I guess that is better than never admitting it and letting it hang forever, right? So with this confession from both sides, the mutual feeling that they’ve been very special people in each other’s life, can they now move on to bigger things? Like kissing and sex? Holy sh*t! Too fast! Don’t rush. Take your time and be your usual selves like always. So I guess this means no season 3?\n\nI know how the flow of the story for this season would turn out. Even so, somehow I was just not impressed by it. I don’t know, I felt this whole season is one long draggy affair of trying to put Ichikawa and Yamada closer. My guts 99.99% tell me how this will end up. But I suppose that is the charm of the series. Ichikawa and Yamada interacting with each other and building up their relationship with a whole lot of awkwardness that comes along. See them fluster greatly each time. That is proof that they are one step closer than before. Now isn’t that sweet? Isn’t that cute? I don’t know, my heart is so numb, I don’t feel anything. But had they rushed everything and suddenly make Ichikawa and Yamada and official couple, I would be b*tching they skipped a lot of materials instead. So yeah, to make their relationship more believable that would lead to the inevitable, thus all these awkward moments of close proximities that perhaps would make some of our hearts go ~kyun. Yeah.\n\nThus it was also confusing and in a way annoying that we hear mostly Ichikawa’s monologue about his feelings and that trolled me to think that he is in love with Yamada already. So much so I thought this would be it that they are now officially dating. But nope. They’re still making cringe excuses that it is not love but it is still love. WTF did I just say but yes, that is how confusing I found this. So it’s like Ichikawa knows he is in love with Yamada for the longest time but dares not want to admit it because reasons. And therefore we have a confused kid doing some confused stuffs and at the same time trolling us. Like as though if he actually makes it official and public his confession, he would lose something. That’s why he continues to remain stubborn and make excuses. Then he feels guilty or stupid by trying to make it up but short of letting his true feelings known. Rinse and repeat this each time they interact. Now isn’t that annoying? This has become the staple of this season that I bet we’ve all but forgotten about Ichikawa’s initial desire to just f*cking murder Yamada and mutilate her body! Somewhere deep in the back of the recess of my mind, I was hoping such sick twist would take place… Thank goodness it did not?\n\nSo I surmise that all these hesitations are because they are also afraid of the new and unknown. It is pretty normal for people in love to be such. Because things are fine now the way it is so what happens when they start to actually go out for real? Things start to change and they might not do what they enjoy doing together right now. That is why status quo is the best. That is why all the shyness and flustering. Is this love? Is this not love? Yes, this supposed unknown factor that makes their heart beat each time they are this close, perhaps they are hooked to it and that’s why they continue to do this. Imagine if they are now official, the thrill is gone. The cat is out of the bag. Everyone knows. Sure, they can advance their relationship and love but only assuming it turns out that way. Anything can happen in the game of love. So I think for the most part, they’re not ready to wade into uncharted territories yet until they are when everything is out of the bag. With out of excuse cards to play, what else is there left? Just take the plunge! See, it worked out all fine.\n\nWith the big focus on Ichikawa and Yamada, the rest of the other characters don’t really make much of an impact and I may go as far as to say that they are close to forgettable. Just like last season, huh? Like Kobayashi… Uhm… Dang, I don’t even know what to say about her. Can’t remember a memorable thing she did for this season. If Ichikawa x Yamada romance is being too draggy, we have Kanzaki and Hara in full swing. Ah yes, their romance is so believable but unfortunately they are not the main characters. So will this help motivate Ichikawa and Yamada? It’s going to take a while. There’s some hint between Sekine and Adachi but nothing conclusive. After all, Adachi is a pervert and Sekine is just cheeky. Too bad for Nanjou. It ended before any love triangle would blossom. Was there ever potential for one? He lost out so I guess this means it is all clear for Ichikawa and Yamada, right? Yeah, why is it still taking so long?\n\nAnd Kana, I think she really wants to vouch for her little brother to be a man of his own. More amusing than Ichikawa himself, his inner self I find him funnier since he is trying to egg Ichikawa to be a man to get closer to Yamada but the little chicken often brushes him. Well, if he doesn’t listen to his own self, what more can I say? Even the new characters aren’t memorable although they bring a bit more variety as both Andou and Hanzawa are quirky in their own ways despite their characters are polar opposites. Another amusing character is Yamada’s father since he really looks eccentric. Don’t judge a book by its cover. Even Yamada’s mom isn’t as bad as I thought she would be. Imagine if she was the bad guy and became the stumbling block in Yamada and Ichikawa’s romance, this would’ve been a whole different ball game.\n\nThis season’s opening theme, Boku Wa… by Atarayo sounds livelier than the first season. But again, doesn’t appeal to me and it sounds generic. Weirdly, a short segment in the opening credits animation whereby Ichikawa and Yamada doing some dance. While Yamada is lively and cute, imagine seeing Ichikawa doing them with his dead fish eyes! Funny? Kohana Lam who sang the ending theme for the first season, does the same for this sequel. However something in Koishiteru Jibun Sura Aiseru N Da doesn’t sound quite right. Well, I think that the singer at some points almost sound off key. Like as though she found that line funny and was going to break into a laughter but managed to hold back and hold her note. Not sure if it is intentional or not. Anyway, the song itself is strange and certainly I find it bland and boring since it sounds somewhat flat throughout the duration. The new casts this season are Yuka Iguchi as Andou (OMG is it really her?! I didn’t notice!), Reina Ueda as Hanzawa, Mitsuki Saiga as Suwa, Rio Tsuchiya as Nico and Yoshimasa Hosoya as Yamada’s dad.\n\nOverall, I find this season to be boring and I am not charmed at all with all the flustering and awkwardness between our lovebirds who are not yet really a couple but actually are and in the end became one. I guess I have graduated from appreciating such simple and heart-warming and cute romcom shows, huh? Contrary to my tastes, there are a lot of positive comments and reviews out there who love this show. Definitely it is just me. Could it be my bitterness that there were no dead bodies in this series?! Looks like I could not graduate from this initial premise. And this season still proves that the dangers in my mind are more profound than the dangers in my heart. Or maybe I just don’t have a cute girlfriend to open up and show me the beauty of the world. On second thought, maybe I’ll stick with 2D chicks after all…\n\nThis was the farcical deliberation within myself when I was deciding whether or not to watch Undead Girl Murder Farce:\n\n-Meh. This is a supernatural detective series. Not my cup of tea. Going to pass this one.\n\n-But there’s a maid character in it.\n\n-True, but she’s only a side character.\n\n-But it’s still a maid character. Don’t you love maids?\n\n-Yes, but that can’t be the only reason to watch this series, right?\n\n-Oh, so you hate maids now?\n\n-No, I don’t. Besides, the show even has a silly title. Like as though a Japanese author plucked random English words just because it sounds cool.\n\n-Even so, you can’t miss the maid.\n\n-Certainly. However this might be horror genre. Main character is just a head.\n\n-But still, there is a maid character. A Victorian maid. A maid with a rifle.\n\n-I know, I’m saying that the show might be of the kind that needs to use your grey matter to think. Something that is not my strongest point at the moment that will impede my enjoyment.\n\n-I thought you enjoyed maid characters?\n\n-I still do. But the show is still not for me.\n\n-So I see. You’ve lost your love for maids.\n\n-For the last time, I do not!\n\n-Yes you do. Otherwise you wouldn’t be ignoring her.\n\n-Wait. What?! Why?!\n\n-Japanese anime maids are the best.\n\n-True, but I…\n\n-Banzai and viva Japanese anime maids forever!\n\n-Okay, maybe…\n\n-Japanese maids are the true rulers of the world (and your heart)!\n\n-Sighs… Oh well… F*ck it…\n\nEpisode 1\n\nIn an alternate reality where the Meiji era is different than we know, Tsugaru Shinuchi is some sort of MMA warrior. However he fights and kills monsters in the ring, much to the audience’s delight. However he is still some circus property so he is treated like sh*t. One day, he notices a maid, Shizuku Hasei carrying a golden birdcage, following him around. Because of his curiosity and touching the birdcage, Shizuku attacks him with intention to kill. Tsugaru is skilled enough and Shizuku is impressed. He knows that he is half oni and will die soon because of that blood that flows inside. While it gives him to power to kill any monsters, it will soon consume him. It is revealed the one talking is the severed head in the birdcage, Aya Rindou. She is here to make a deal with him. She can extend his life if he kills her. Aya claims she is an immortal for 947 years. However, 6 months ago, an old foreigner fool took her body. However, an immortal is supposed to regenerate its body so why can’t she? Ah yes, the oni power. It can nullify powers and she was cut by one. But that oni was incomplete and since its power was halved, that’s why this talking severed head. Aya poses the baffling question that despite he wants to die, yet he wants to live. Long story short, despite knowing he will die, he wants to die in the best possible way. That is, he wants to turn into an oni and kill everyone who views him as a tool for entertainment. That is why he declines her plan since it will extend his life. But she still wants him to do so since it is no fun without a body. Even if he accepts extending his life, he won’t kill her. He notes she wants to get her body back and that means she has a plan to return to normal. It also means she knows where her body is. Very far away. In Europe. Tsugaru asks if this guy has a cane engraved with an “M” on it. Yes. Because this is the same person who captured him and took away his humanity. Since Aya is the brains and Tsugaru has the body to move about, their goals are aligned. Let’s go to Europe. To seal the deal, she needs to let him consume a body part to extend his life. Of course she won’t let him eat her physical parts as even bodily fluids like her saliva can do the job. So yeah, the strange scene of an oni guy kissing a severed head.\n\nEpisode 2\n\nWe’re in France now. Jean Duchet Godard is a vampire as he goes hunting with his son, Raoulf. He tells him about the need to do things that would make them closer to be associated with humans. Everyone must learn to deal with humans, like it or not. When he returns home, he finds the storeroom padlock is broken. He inspects and sees a silver stake covered in blood. He calls for his family and servants. Then to his horror, he finds his wife, Hannah dead in her chair. Soon, this is all over the news and as such, rumours swirling about regarding withdrawals from pro human allies and those against it. The reporters try to get Godard say a word but he ignores them until a young journalist, Annie Kerber asks for his opinion. Godard views this as social discrimination and is displeased at how the police is handling this case. Thus he has already called a pair of famed supernatural private detectives to aid in this case. That lights up Annie since they are quite famous pair known as Cage User and has solved supernatural cases in Norway and Belgium. Our detectives arrive and meet Godard and his family. Obviously the family is stumped when Tsugaru seems to be making strange verbal communication spats with the maid. Then the cat is out of the bag (or rather out of the cage) when they realize Aya is only a head. How can she still be alive?! Well, because I’m not dead. Oh Aya! You jest! But so true! Aya has Godard explain what happened and bring them to the crime scene. It is true a silver stake killed Hannah in her sleep and there is also a bottle of holy water left behind. While vampires can heal, holy waters make their healing take weeks. Vampires are also weak against silver since going near without touching them has them feel a scalding effect. Of course this has Aya poses a few questions that make the murder look strange. This includes leaving the holy water bottle behind, why the culprit chose to attack at night instead of the day (where vampires are considerably weakened) and bother putting back the stake in the storeroom.\n\nEpisode 3\n\nAs they stay and have dinner with the family, Aya soon shows her observation skills and describes the coachman’s current family household based on the clothes he is wearing, etc. Then she questions Godard and his family as well as his servants for their alibi. So basically the murder happened an hour after all had their lunch (or was it dinner?). Hannah retired to her room to rest while Claude the eldest son discussed town operations with father before tending to Charlotte (the youngest daughter) and then handing her over to the maid, Giselle. Raoulf thinks Aya suspects one of the family members but she remains her professionalism. In the end, those without a strong alibi are Claude and Alfred (the butler). Godard opposes that Claude would have any intention to kill his own mother. This ‘interrogation’ is stopped wen Charlotte becomes upset. Later Claude gets rough with Tsugaru and warns him he could easily snap his neck if he steps out of line. However Aya can tell he isn’t the killer because his hands were clean. She was also observing everyone’s hands during the meal. Obviously all clean as f*ck. She orders Shizuku to keep an eye on the servants, to not let them out of their sight since they are the prime suspects. The detectives go hunting with Godard (to search for something) as the latter is adamant none of his family members are the killers. He is steadfast on this because he doesn’t want to lose more family as he has already lost 3 before coming to this city. Aya talks about the oni that could kill the undead. Ironically they are not strong, can be easily brought down and have low intelligence. Thanks to mankind’s purge, there are no oni in their complete form today. Godard is shot by an arrow of a vampire hunter. This doesn’t even hurt him so he hunts him down to teach this bugger a lesson and accuses him of killing Hannah. Aya won’t let him be killed and asks a series of questions. She is sure he cannot be the killer since he just arrived in town. Apparently Joseph is here to avenge his friend, Hugo who was killed by Godard although Godard claimed he was attacked first. He also noted Hugo always had a stake but is unsure if it’s silver or not, that he refused to let anyone see. Aya lets him go seeing this guy is not strong enough to kill a vampire. Now she has all the pieces put together and wants the family to gather so she can make the ultimate revelation. Time to bring this murder farce to a close.\n\nEpisode 4\n\nAya begins her explanation. The most important factor she brings to her argument: Sound. Even if Hannah didn’t scream, driving a stake into her would’ve produced a loud sound louder than hammering a nail. And those inside the mansion then didn’t hear a thing. Then she brings up that there might be accomplices and they have been in cohorts to fake their alibis. Aya then reveals the stake that killed Hannah isn’t made of silver but something else. This has her bring the bottle issue as the culprit left it there deliberately. So it goes, the culprit used the stake to kill Hannah and then poured holy water over to melt it, then collected Hannah’s blood to put on the silver stake that was in the storeroom to make it look like a vampire hunter killed her. Hence the murder was committed before Godard when hunting. Aya points out Raoulf as the killer. Despite using the stake and having burns on his finger, he then used a sword to cut it off. This eliminates the evidence as well as he could regenerate a new hand immediately. Raoulf immediately attacks Aya but Tsugaru jumps in to fight. While they both duke it out, Aya continues explains about Raoulf using the coldness of the forest to freeze the holy water. At this point, Godard is in shock that his son is the culprit. Aya adds they can find plenty of evidence in Raoulf’s room. We hear Raoulf rant how he is against this pro human allies thingy. Since mother was once human before turning into a vampire, he killed her to make it look like a human did it and make dad change his mind. Since he is still deluded, he is going to kill everybody! Tsugaru beats this arrogant kid up as he explains about himself being part of the oni slaying group in Japan. So he is like one strong motherf*cker, right? Your puny vampire ass can’t even beat him as Tsugaru finishes him off. With the case closed, the detectives leave just as Annie arrive to get the scoop on the case. Although Tsugaru’s experience and advice is that humans and monsters cannot coexist, Aya paints a more positive note. Even if Godard’s reputation is ruined, he can start again. They are after all immortal monsters. Aya then asks if he has seen a man with a fake right leg and a cane bearing “M”. In fact, he (nicknamed Professor) did visited Godard recently and invited him to come along to London. Godard refused due to family issues.\n\nEpisode 5\n\nArsene Lupin kidnaps the Erik AKA Phantom of the Opera because he is shorthanded. He needs help to steal a valuable diamond from Phileas Fogg (of Around the World in 80 Days fame) in London. Because of Lupin’s letter, Fogg has hired renowned detectives and paid them to help protect his gem. This means our Cage User detectives are also here. After getting some customer list in some shop, they stumble into Sherlock Holmes and John H. Watson. Not sure what shady things they were about to do in the alley but the policemen apprehended them. Once they know who they are, they are swiftly brought to Fogg’s mansion. Along with inspector Lestrade, they are greeted by Fogg’s servant, Passepartout who shows them around his extensive museum, artefacts and items he collected while travelling around the world. Meeting Fogg himself, he explains the diamond is so valuable, it is not displayed for public and kept safe in an underground vault. Joining this case are a pair of staffs from Lloyd’s security department, Reinhold Stingheart and Fatima Doubledarts. Lloyd’s is a powerful insurance company with a massive history and whatever incidents happen, they always give their word to protect their clients’ insured property with absolute power. Fogg takes them to the vault and goes through a series of complex security measures to show them the diamond. It even has some supernatural legend. A fight between dwarves and werewolves? The dwarves used their technology to create this unbreakable gem and this pure silver safe. Holmes tries to take the lead as he analyses the layout, possible entrances and exits here and even the possibility that Lupin has already infiltrated among one of them. Investigation ends here as they leave. Aya believes she has a plan but wonders if it will work because it seems stupid.\n\nEpisode 6\n\nWhen Watson wants to discuss plans with Holmes, his brother Mycroft can tell he is a fake because of his nails. With the real Holmes entering, the imposter reveals himself to be Lupin. This is just courtesy to demonstrate that Lupin can unlock any lock and after that Lupin escapes on Phantom’s car. But soon they bump into Shizuku and pick her up. It seems she is looking for Aya. Earlier in the day, a careless mistake has the birdcage being swapped. Yeah, Tsugaru is now holding one with a parrot. Mycroft discusses with Holmes about the Lloyd’s duo. It is believed that they have no qualms in letting Lupin steal the jewel as their main goal is to destroy the monster. They want to use the gem to find the werewolf and then pin the blame on Lupin. Holmes is certain he can wrest the diamond back if that happens. The innocent guy with the swapped cage is in shock to see a head, drops it off as Aya gets run over by a car! The delinquent twins want to sell her. Shizuku spots Aya’s head in the car and a strange and short car chase until the twins crash. With Aya back in safe hands, Shizuku thanks the gentlemen. However Aya can tell they are Lupin and Phantom and they too recognize the Cage Users. Since Tsugaru claims he is stronger than Lupin, the latter tests him out. Using his marble trickery, Tsugaru loses. Lupin then warns Aya not to get involved but of course she knows it was all just a play. Time to head back to Fogg’s house. Holmes meets Ganimard who is the Paris’ chief police officer hired by Fogg. Just to be sure he isn’t an imposter, he pulls his moustache! The real deal. Fogg, Passepartout, Holmes, Watson, Lestrade and Ganimard stay in the safe while the Lloyd’s duo protect from the top. Holmes shoots all the locks. This is to prevent Lupin from picking. Hey, can’t pick that is not of a lock, right? They may be trapped here for a while and it might even take hours for a locksmith to get them out but they won’t die. At least all the exits are sealed and this has made security fool proof. However that will soon be their downfall as an explosion is heard and water from the moat start flooding in from the vent above. Looks like Lupin really got them this time.\n\nEpisode 7\n\nThe water rises nearly to the ceiling. A policeman seeks Lloyd’s help but Reinhold only sends Fatima. She destroys the door to let the water out. Once it is done, everyone notices the safe is gone. As everyone goes back up to dry themselves, Holmes then arrests Ganimard and reveals he is Lupin in disguise (because of his lighter footsteps?!). It is revealed that when the water was gushing in, a rope was hidden in it to pull up the safe. However Holmes note had he stolen the safe, he wouldn’t have gotten the diamond. Because it was left in Watson’s pocket. Lupin has the last laugh since he has already stolen it and escapes. The whole place now scrambles to contain Lupin. Lupin meets Phantom in the greenhouse. They have both the gem and the safe. However opening the safe, Aya is inside! She gives the signal as Tsugaru jumps in. Lupin seems to be shock at Aya and this proves he thought Annie who was with them at that time, to be Aya. Also, it was Aya’s instruction for Tsugaru to lose to him and for her to be put in the safe. Though, she didn’t anticipate the water part. It becomes a 3 way fight for the diamond as Lupin, Tsugaru and Reinhold tussle for this little piece. Aya orders Shizuku to go after Phantom but she got lost and it is Fatima who hunts him down. Holmes and Watson arrive as they tell Aya the situation has changed. It seems Professor and his merry team of Aleister Crowley, Carmilla, Victor and Jack the Ripper are here to cause havoc. Many policemen dead and viciously killed off. Holmes, Watson and Aya return to the main house and are faced with Aleister. Lestrade finds himself in Carmilla’s company. He realizes she is a vampire but is saved thanks to Shizuku dropping in. She is not interested in this fight and is only looking for Phantom. However Carmilla won’t let any b*tch dirty kick her and get away with it. After all, Professor also gave them the orders to kill anyone that gets in their way.\n\nEpisode 8\n\nLupin and Tsugaru work together to take down Reinhold. Dropping the organ enough to kill him? Fatima is having trouble fighting Phantom as he is used to the dark. Carmilla finds Shizuku formidable but soon the latter gets poisoned by her aphrodisiac and is about to succumb to be her meal. Holmes and Watson are hiding as they have run out of bullets and tricks against Aleister. Aya asks him about wanting the gem so he hints that it reveals the clue of finding the werewolves. Talk is cut short when the big man Professor shows up. Holmes knows him as James Moriarty. The tide turns as Jack kills off the Lloyd’s duo and the fights Tsugaru. Lupin and Phantom escape and are willing to abandon the diamond. This monster is not worth their lives. Moriarty confirms that he has Aya’s body but won’t give it back because it’s a valuable sample. Moriarty is making a comeback and rebuilding his organization after a young man approached him to have a strong body. He is Jack and that body he wants also needs to be incorporated with monsters. Hence Moriarty went to do surgery on him. In order to get a monster with intelligence, physical strength and regenerative ability, they went to Japan and got a hold of few before they go extinct. He extracted cells and injected them into humans who willingly became their samples. However many died as the concentration of demons in a human’s body was too high. Moriarty tweaked and balanced this on Jack’s body. Finally, to get an undead for an immortal body, there was only 1 in Japan. Guess who? Aya admits she was experimented by a sicko 950 years ago and turned into an immortal. To further strengthen Jack’s body, he caught Azelin Von Kuradoka a vampire. The cells implanted into Jack were perfect because not only it strengthens his body and senses but eliminates all vampires’ weaknesses. And now they set their eyes on werewolves and if they are successful, they will become pioneers in creating the first chimera. Tsugaru gets beaten by Jack as Jack remembers him as one of the experiments. Seeing he now has the stone, he ends the fight and signals to the rest. Just in time before resisting Shizuku gets raped by Carmilla. Moriarty leaves and lets them know the name of his new organization: Banquet. When everyone gathers and think they lost big this time, Tsugaru shows them otherwise. Because as a pickpocket, he cut a hole in Jack’s pocket and the diamond is in his hands. Yeah, Jack screaming in despair. Looking at the inscription on the diamond, some light angle ultraviolet thingy reveals the location of the werewolves.\n\nEpisode 9\n\n8 years ago, a werewolf seems to be protecting a young girl but as they hide in a tower, the mob of villagers burn it all down. Now we see Cage Users making their way to a remote village in Germany. Tsugaru is excited to see a werewolf as he has never seen one. Aya did see one but it was about 150 years ago when Gennai Hiraga brought in several creatures to experiment and see which one could harm her. They soon stumble into Dr Heinemann who pleads for their help as a young girl named Louise has been kidnapped by werewolves. He mentions it all started a year ago when the village chief’s granddaughter was kidnapped and her body was found with bruise and marks all over in the forest, almost beyond recognition. The same cycle repeats every 4 months as a young girl in this village will meet a gruesome fate. Last night, a commotion was heard from Louise’s room but by the time her father, Gustav broke down the door, the room was a mess and it is believed the werewolf fled via window. Heinemann is not surprised at this insanity as 8 years ago there was a werewolf that took refuge in this village. They go see the other townspeople arguing with themselves. You bet they will be in further shock to see a talking head. Gustav wants to kill this monster but Aya assures she can help solve this case. So they visit the crime scene as Aya asks questions for alibis and conducts a few series of experiments like dropping something from the chimney. She comes to a conclusion the perpetrator purposely made a mess of the room. As there were bloodstains here but none of such outside the window, she believes the culprit brought along something to kidnap Louise in (as nothing was stolen from the room). Aya paints a grim picture that Louise is no longer alive. They go visit the village chief who tells them about the legend mentioning a hidden village at the bottom of the waterfall, Wolfenheile. He isn’t confident they can find any werewolves there because they need some keys like the diamond to find it. Oh, you mean this gem! He hints there is no place called Forest of Teeth but to find the werewolves’ village, they must find the Forest of Teeth. Aya makes a deal that she will solve this case in 2 days and he will tell them how to find that village. Meanwhile a pair of cowboy freaks just entered town, Alice Rapidshot and Kyle Chaintail. Oh, they’re from Lloyd’s, huh?\n\nEpisode 10\n\nAya believes the werewolf is killing not just "
