Shinnosuke returns home and while he is distracted, his sister Himawari swallows the ball. That night, the Nohara family is attacked by the same man accompanied by his brothers. They introduce themselves as Rose, Lavender and Lemon and reveal themselves to be searching for the ball picked up by Shinnosuke. After discovering that Himawari swallowed the ball, they forcefully take the Nohara family with them to their dance-bar. On the way, the brothers explain to the Noharas that they are the descendants of the Tamayura tribe of Ainu shamans.\n\nIn the past, an Ainu shaman from the Tamayumi tribe had awakened a powerful dark entity called Jack to gain magical abilities and rule the world but was defeated by the Tamayuras' ancestor. In order to prevent Jack from reawakening, the Tamayura shaman divided Jack's powers into two balls and a statue. Both balls were in the possession of the Tamayuras, until they sold off one due to financial constraints. The statue was buried deep underground but had been recently unearthed and kept in a museum, from where it was stolen by the 3 daughters of Tamao Nakamura, a descendant of the Tamayumi shaman, aiming to revive Jack. Nakamura had also got into the group a man called Hexon who achieved psychic powers from meditating in Tibet and was also in possession of the ball which had been sold off by the Tamayuras. But the Tamayuras had managed to steal that ball from Hexon at the Tokyo airport. The Noharas agree to travel alongside the Tamayuras after they explain that the Tamayumis already know through Hexon the location of the other ball and are seeking to kidnap Himawari in order to extract it.\n\nAt the dance-bar, the group is ambushed by the Tamayumis and a bodybuilder named Satake but are able to escape. The group then stops at a bathhouse to take some rest, where they are joined by Yone Higashimatsuyama, a female cop from Chiba city who was investigating into the ruckus created at the airport by the 3 brothers & after hearing their story, she joins them in an attempt to seek glory for herself. However, they are again ambushed by the Tamayumis but are able escape them. But this time, Yone and Hiroshi get separated from the rest of the group. Hexon however, uses his psychic abilities to locate the group.\n\nThe next morning, the Tamayumis once again attack the group at a grocery store where they had rtopped to buy essentials and succeed in capturing Lemon and Lavender. Rose leads the Nohara family to his home near Mt Osore as Yone and Hiroshi rejoin the group. Rose informs his mother (who is in possession of the other ball) about the situation as she orders her soldiers to defend Himawari at all costs. She also reveals Rose, Lemon and Lavender's real names to be Takeshi, Kiyoshi and Tsuyoshi. This time, only Hexon comes from the Tamayumis but succeeds in capturing Himawari & the other ball despite the best efforts of Takeshi, Takeshi's mother, Takeshi's mother's sword-wielding troops, Yone, Shinnosuke, Hiroshi and Misae. In the next morning using her own psychic abilities, Takeshi's mother discovers the Tamayumis to be hiding in a high-rise building by the Rainbow Bridge.\n\nShinnosuke, Shiro, Hiroshi, Misae, Yone and Takeshi head straight away to save Himawari. The Tamayumis insist on keeping Himawari hostage (in spite of having extracted the ball from her) in order to prevent Noharas from interfering in their plans, to which Satake disagrees, so he leaves them and returns Himawari back to the Nohara family. A fight ensues between the group and Tamao's daughters, and in midst of the chaos, Tamao and Hexon escape. Tamao and Hexon try to insert the two balls in Jack's statue. Tamao attempts to betray Hexon but to no avail. The group arrives to retrieve Jack's statue as a fight ensues, where Shinnosuke uses his humor to overcome Hexon's abilities and ultimately succeeds. However, Shinnosuke and Himawari accidentally awaken Jack by inserting the two balls into the statue, but Jack reveals that he had died many years ago and is now just an ordinary human being and no longer wields dark powers. A furious Hexon tries to kill Himawari by throwing her off the top of the high-rise building, but Shinnosuke and the rest of the group save them. As Yone arrests the Tamayumis and Hexon on charges of kidnapping and attempted murder, the Nohara family return home, while Jack & Satake join the Tamayuras at their dance-bar.\n\nAkiko Yajima as Shinnosuke Nohara\n\nMiki Narahashi as Misae Nohara\n\nKeiji Fujiwara as Hiroshi Nohara\n\nSatomi Kōrogi as Himawari Nohara\n\nDaisuke Gōri as Rose\n\nKaneto Shiozawa as Lavender\n\nShinya Ōtaki as Lemon\n\nYuriko Yamamoto as Yone Higashimatsuyama\n\nSuwon Rin as Tamayura's mother\n\nKeiko Yamamoto as Tamao Nakamura\n\nJun Hazumi as Hexon\n\nSaeko Shimazu as Chimama Maho\n\nFumihiko Tachiki as Satake\n\nMari Mashiba as Shiro\n\nShin Aomori as Jack\n\nYoshito Usui as Cartoonist\n\nRokurō Naya as Bunta Takakura (principal)\n\nYumi Takada as Midori Yoshinaga\n\nMichie Tomizawa as Ume Matsuzaka\n\nTamao Hayashi as Nene Sakurada\n\nTeiyū Ichiryūsai as Masao Sato\n\nChie Satō as Bo Suzuki\n\nApart from possessing remarkable physical strength, he has the psychic power to read the minds of his opponents obtained through training in Tibet.
