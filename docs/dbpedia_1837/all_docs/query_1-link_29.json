        "text": "There was a little bit of a discussion about the old English Shin-Chan dub in the Pilot Day thread, so I decided to make topic specifically comparing and contrasting the two.\n\nThe first English dub came from Phuuz Entertainment in 1994. It was made for the international market, as it never aired here in America. It had VA's from American cartoons such as Kath Soucie, Pat Fraley, Grey DeLisle, and others. It aired on Fox Kids UK(now Jetix UK), and some other European countries.\n\nHere is a clip from the dub: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hWIWBROwqUU\n\nAs you can see, they changed the music and added some scene transitions. However, it was pretty funny and even some of the jokes were a little bit adult in nature. I think this was the dub that WS rejected a couple years back. Does this dub still air on Jetix UK and how many episodes were dubbed?\n\nI still prefer Funimation's dub, but this one is alright.\n\nI -thought- the music sounded quite different from what I've seen from FUNi's dub so far. I didn't know if it was due to new music being made for the Phuuz version or if it was from a different season and the original Japanese soundtrack just had different BGM in that season. But it sounds like there was new music added.\n\nAnyway, I agree with Niko in the other thread that I'm not fond of Kath's voice for the Phuuz version. In almost every show I've seen her in (with the exception of Fifi), she uses one of the two voices- Phil or Lil, and it was certainly true here. Her delivery was OK and it fit Shin well, but I'm just sick of her overuse of those intonations.\n\nA couple of the jokes were good, though. I'd probably have to see more of the Phuuz dub before I make a more accurate critique but for now I definitely prefer the FUNi version.\n\nI -thought- the music sounded quite different from what I've seen from FUNi's dub so far.

Also, the principal says \"Hell\" near the end of the episode.\n\nApparently, Phuuz did another dub around 2003 which features an all-new cast and uses anime VA staples. Maybe that was the dub WS rejected.\n\nEdit: Which is what lfv said above me.\n\nHere's a comparison of the original Japanese episode to the Phuuz version:\n\nThis is the original.\n\nThis is the dub, also mentioned above.\n\nI'm not going to judge the Phuuz version because I've only seen the three episodes in that arc and one other. But it's definitely geared more to kids than any other version. Even the title theme is has a very Saturday morning feel. Despite that, though, I think there are still some subtly sexual jokes in some episodes still. I'm just used to FUNimation's very naughty Shin Chan. I -think- that this version is available on DVD (plus you can clearly see a DVD menu in the title theme link), but I dunno if I'd pick it up. I will, however, pick up Adult Swim's DVD in August.\n\nThe first English dub came from Phuuz Entertainment in 1994. It was made for the international market, as it never aired here in America. It had VA's from American cartoons such as Kath Soucie, Pat Fraley, Grey DeLisle, and others. It aired on Fox Kids UK(now Jetix UK), and some other European countries.\n\nThat's pretty strange that this had a dub way back in 1994.\n\nMaybe this ended up getting dubbed in the first place because some licensor got it for cheap. I'm surprised this didn't end up on Canadian TV since their standards would probably allow it.\n\nHere's a comparison of the original Japanese episode to the Phuuz version:\n\nThis is the original.\n\nThis is the dub, also mentioned above.\n\nI'm not going to judge the Phuuz version because I've only seen the three episodes in that arc and one other.

Or was it from the Japanese original, and it was already in English?\n\nShin-chan is marketed to kids in Europe? FUNi's VA for Shin sounds very close to the original.\n\nOriginally Posted By NikoAnesti\n\nOh, yeah, I caught that too. The obligatory Dexter's Mom's voice. I really don't think any of the main voices fit too well. \"Cosmo's\" fit's alright, and so do the other friends. But I just can't feel any of the others.\n\nCosmo's voice BTW is Grey Desile in one of her first roles. It should be also noted that she apparently hated working on the dub version claiming they had endless sessions working on the show and pretty base humor.\n\nI do think it's interesting that this \"base humor\" even if not as adult as the Shin Chan now was still allowed to pass. Seriously what is it about Shin Chan that makes the dub team want to add so many pop culture and more adult refrences to it, even when they're aiming for kids? Guess that's part of Shin's charm or something."
