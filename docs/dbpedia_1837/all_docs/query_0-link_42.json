        "text": "Sony kicked off this week of gaming in Japan with the worldwide playable debut of Tourist Trophy: The Real Riding Simulator. The new motorbike game from Polyphony Digital (makers of the Gran Turismo series) was the focus of Sony's small booth off the main show floor of the Tokyo Motor Show, which opened to the press this past Wednesday and is gearing up for full public opening (and, eventually, over a million visitors) starting Saturday at the Makuhari Messe in Chiba.\n\nPolyphony and Sony have been a part of the Tokyo Motor Show for some time now, but this is the first time the subject matter hasn't been Gran Turismo. IGN got to sample Tourist Trophy at the show and came away impressed with the bike handling, trueness to the sport and feel of speed, although we were hoping for original tracks. Our full report is on IGNPS2.\n\nThe main part of any gaming week in Japan is Thursday, and Nintendo rose to the occasion with yet another killer lineup of titles. Pokemon Torouze, Where do Babies Come From (Akadoko), Tendou Dokuta 2 and Super Princess Peach all arrived on the same day, and are sure to bring in another flood of DS system purchasers. Peach and Akadoko look like they could attract non-gamer types, and Pokemon Torouze ought to grab the Pokemoners who've been holding out (especially with all the press Nintendo's been getting for Pokemon Mysterious Dungeon and Rangers).\n\nOf these games, Pokemon and Peach were heavily advertised with ubiquitous television commercials (see last week's ad section for downloads). Akadoko's predecessor, Feel the Magic, did respectable numbers when it launched with the DS last year, but probably not enough to warrent a huge advertising campaign. Sega, instead, placed all its advertising on its PSP Brain Trainer game. Akadoko's press campaign seems to be a more grass-roots affair, with in-store displays and upcoming demo events.\n\nAkadoko also has one of the coolest official websites ever! Go there for a couple of hilarious songs (they're funny even if you don't understand Japanese!) and a bunch of wall papers. The ads that we've provided in this week's ad section a few pages down are all available in clear wallpaper form at the site. While the DS and PS2 are looking set to take over Japanese retail later this year with unbeatable lineups (we've written about the absurdity of the PS2's December lineup in this space before), Microsoft is still hoping to make a dent with its Xbox 360. The system's release is about a month and a half away, and things have started to heat up both at retail and in advertisements. For more on the Xbox 360 launch hype machine, turn down a few pages to our new weekly launch watch feature.\n\nThis week's Gaming Life in Japan is inspired in part by things that make you go Boing.\n\nWe'll admit that the Spam Burger from burger chain Freshness Burger definitely makes us go Boing. We would have also accepted this, from the Tokyo Motor Show:\n\nTurn the page for the past week in review.\n\nTHIS WEEK'S TOPICS\n\nIn this section, we list all our Japanese content from the week prior. Many of the stories we post from Japan get buried beneath stories about wrestling, football and other stuff of concern to American gamers.

From Famitsu to Dengeki to smaller publications like Dori Maga, Japan has lots of videogame magazines. While we tend to put up all the news and game info revealed in the magazines on the main pages of IGN, this section gives you a closer look just so you can be sure that you're not missing out on anything.\n\nBe sure and click on the covers of each magazine for larger versions. Print them out and hold them in your hand as you read!\n\nFAMITSU -- NO. 881\n\nA Square Enix lover's dream for the cover of this latest issue of Famitsu. The magazine has a look at the Final Fantasy series as a whole, with the cover taking characters from all the games and putting them in one glorious image, with the Famitsu fox as a mage. Good stuff!\n\nThe FF feature spans 20 pages and discusses the new Game Boy Advance ports, Final Fantasy XII, final Fantasy XI, the compilation of Final Fantasy VII projects and even Kingdom Hearts II (which features Final Fantasy characters). The FFXII coverage is just full of what American gamers would call spoilers, so we'll keep from writing about it. The Kingdom Hearts story shows Leon from Final Fantasy VIII and animal forms for Sora, Goofy and Donald to go with their appearance in Lion King. Alas, there are no new Crisis Core details in this feature.\n\nFamitsu keeps on getting the Nintendo scoops. This week, the magazine has the full word on Seiken Densetsu DS: Children of Mana, Mario Basket 3on3, Xenosaga I&II and Tenchu DS. Outside of the DS, the magazine touches upon such games as Kyou Kara Ma-Ou and Ninkyouden for the PS2 as well as the latest PSP pachinko simulation. Zettai Zetsumai Toushi 2 (Disaster Report 2 in America) makes a return with a couple of pages of coverage and word that a release is still planned for 2005.\n\nA section buried deep within the magazine looks at a few rumors and the possibility of them coming true. Some of the rumors are already known to be true, including FFXI coming with the Xbox 360 and a new game system in development in China (The Shanda Station). Word of the PS3 coming out at 70,000 yen on 3/21 is flagged with a 45% truth rating (70,000 yen is just a bit too high, the magazine says, although the 3/21 date is possible). A 10% truth mark is given to the idea of Microsoft releasing a budget priced Xbox 360 minus the hard disk, with 1% given to the Xbox 360 being able to play Sega's new Lindberg arcade games. Mario 128 may be in development for Revolution (60% truth) and 90% says that Revolution will have the cheapest game development for all next generation gaming consoles.\n\nThe magazine's news section includes a survey on the Nintendo WiFi Connection, as answered by readers of the Famitsu.com website. Of the 508 responders, 61.8% said that they'd like to try out the WiFi service, with only 15.4% stating that they're not interested. Most expect to use the WiFi service at home, with 63.8% planning on using Nintendo's USB Connector, 51.7% expecting to use their own WiFi router (okay... there has to be some overlap in there), 31.0% expecting to use a Freespot connection and 23.3% planning on holing up at a store to use the Nintendo WiFi stations.\n\nIt's not exactly related to the WiFi experience, but Famitsu also asked readers to select their top ten DS most wanted DS games. Mario Kart takes top honors amongst Famitsu.com readers followed by Final Fantasy III, Animal Crossing DS, Gyakuten Saiban 4 (the next Phoenix Wright game), ASH, New Super Mario Brothers, Children of Mana, Motto Nou wo Kitaeru Otona no DS Training (sequel to that brain training game that everyone's buying), Mario & Luigi RPG 2 and Nintendo's new English training software.\n\nNintendo also chimed in for a quick question and answer session regarding the WiFi Connection. The company expects up to four people to be able to play together with WiFi compatible games, although it states that it can't give a final count. When you get disconnected from your WiFi connection, an error message appears on the screen, although the behavior after this is dependent on the game that you're playing. In the case of Mario Kart DS, the game lets the player that got disconnected go back to the menu screen. The other three players can continue playing as if nothing happened.\n\nAlso included in the news section is an interview session with three developers: Tetsuya Mizuguchi, Chief Creative Officer of Q Entertainment, Reo Yonaga, Senior Game Designer at Q Entertainment and Kanta Matsuhisa, a 22-year-old third year college student from Nagoya who makes games on his own. The Q Entertainment guys are turning Every Extend Extra, one of Matsuhisa's games, into a PSP title, which was announced back at TGS.\n\nMizuguchi reveals that the decision to make Every Extend Extra into a PSP title was made in June of 2004, during the development of Lumines. Staffers at Q Entertainment were totally hooked on the freeware PC version of Every Extend Extra, and Mizuguchi decided to go to Nagoya to discuss the game with Matsuhisa. Yonaga first sent an e-mail to Matsuhisa, asking if he'd be able to discuss the future of Every Extend Extra with them, which surprised Matsuhisa because it was such a strange question, and Q Entertainment hadn't yet taken to the public eye at that point.\n\nGoing over a bit of his past, Matsuhisa reveals that he first started making games during his third or fourth year of elementary school, and spent eight hours of his vacation days on the hobby. For Every Extend Extra, he states that he took some inspiration from, surprisingly, Mizuguchi's own Rez. Matsuhisa says that it would be great if he could work as a game designer in the future. He's actually willing to do anything that relates to computers, although games are at the top of his list.\n\nThis week's review list is quite long, leading up to the end of month rush.\n\nGAMESYSTEMPUBSCOREUltimate Pro PinballPS2Taito6,5,6,5Eureka Seven -- TR1: New WavePS2Bandai7,6,7,6Yoshitsune Eiyuuden ShuraPS2From Software8,8,8,7Wanda to Kyozou [Shadow of the Colossus]PS2Sony Computer Entertainment10,9,8,10Ultraman Fighting Evolution RebirthPS2Banpresto9,7,7,8Konneko -- Keep a Memory GreenPS2Yeti6,6,6,5Memories Off #5 Togireta FilmPS2Kid7,7,7,6Kill ZonePS2Sega7,9,8,7Batallion WarsGCNNintendo8,8,8,7Zoid Full Metal CrushGCNTomy7,6,6,7Call of Duty -- Finest HourPS2Capcom8,8,8,8Call of Duty -- Finest HourXBOXCapcom8,8,8,9Frontier StoriesGBAMarvelous Interactive8,7,8,8Shinki Gensou SSII -- Unlimited SidePSPIdea Factory7,6,7,8Simple DS Series Vol. 4: The Block KuzushiNDSNintendo7,5,5,6Tsubasa ChronicleNDSArika6,6,6,8\n\nDENGEKI PS2 -- 11/25\n\nDengeki PS2 is a DVD magazine published every other month by Dengeki. Unlike Famitsu Wave, another DVD magazine, this one occasionally includes a PS2 game disk, with demos of upcoming titles.\n\nThe November 25th issue includes a playable demo of Genki's Ikusagami, the hack and slash action title that features over 65,000 enemies on the battle field. While this same demo was handed out at the Tokyo Game Show, those who couldn't attend can get their hands on it here.\n\nEven better is the magazine's movie footage. Dengeki managed to get first footage of Suikoden V and Xenosaga III. Also included are games like Tales of the Abyss, Ace Combat Zero, Onimusha Dawn of Dreams and Rouge Galaxy III. That big PS3 on the cover is only a partial truth, as the magazine only includes footage of three Koei games all of which were made public on the internet a ways back.\n\nDengeki PS2 costs 1150 yen. Both the DVD and PS2 require Japanese units, so make sure you have the right equipment before you go about importing it.\n\nDENGEKI GC -- DEC\n\nDengeki GameCube got real excited in time for its December issue and decided to fill the cover with Nintendo characters -- so much so that the \"GameCube\" part of the title is covered up!\n\nThe all-Nintendo magazine from the Dengeki group focuses on seven big series and characters: Mario, Pokemon, Rockman, Powerful Pro Pocket, Animal Crossing, Mushi King and Harvest Moon. The Mario family gets the most coverage. Mario Kart DS has a huge ten page preview. Also covered is Super Mario Strikers, complete with some of the coolest Nintendo character artwork you've ever seen! Other Mario-related games include Super Princess Peach and the upcoming Mario & Luigi RPG 2.\n\nFor the Pokemon series, the focus is on Pokemon Mysterious Dungeon, which we've already covered on the DS and Game Boy Advance channels. Pokemon Ranger slips in with a couple of screenshots and two pieces of character artwork. Nintendo is clearly being shy with the details on this one at the moment, which raises our hype meters up a few nothces.\n\nThis week's piece of Dengeki bonus swag is a thin notebook/scheduler featuring artwork from Pokemon, Power Pro Kun Pocket and Rockman EXE 6.\n\nDengeki doesn't have any reviews in this issue.\n\nAny questions or thoughts on these magazines? Send your comments to the IGN Japan mailbag and you may get published in the Gaming Life in Japan letters column (which will reappear once you punks send some letters our way!).\n\nTurn the page for a look at the latest releases from Japan.\n\nNOW PLAYING\n\nThis section recaps the games that made their way onto store shelves over the course of the previous week. If you're having trouble keeping up with what's new in the Japanese market, turn to this section every week.\n\nYou may have noticed that this section can also be found on the regular channels. Yes, even outsiders need to keep up with what's new in the import scene.\n\nThe following games were released between 10.16.05 and 10.22.05. Click on the name to see all of IGN's current coverage and media for the game.\n\nPlayStation 2\n\nBurnout Revenge\n\nPublisher: Electronic Arts\n\nGenre: Racing, Action\n\nRelease: 10.20.2005\n\nPrice: 6090\n\nAlready out in America, this entry in Electronic Art's destructive racing series adds all sorts of new possibilities for crashing, from jumping spots on the race way to the ability to blow yourself up in order to get your rival into a messy situation. The game's World Tour mode includes a number of events, from competing to get the greatest number of innocent bystander cars involved in your crashes throughout the course of a race, to attempting to get the most damage possible in a single crash. Split screen competitive and cooperative multiplayer play and a course set in Tokyo complete the package.\n\nD1 Grand Prix 2005\n\nPublisher: Yukes\n\nGenre: Racing\n\nRelease: 10.20.2005\n\nPrice: 7140\n\nA year 2005 follow up to Yukes' first D1 Grand Prix title, the focus of D1 Grand Prix 2005 remains on drifting and on presenting the world of D1 racing to players, complete with real course and racer names.

The game recreates the \"Bousou Mode\" from the original machine and adds a gallery mode where you can view classic scenes from the original anime.\n\nShuffle! On the Stage\n\nPublisher: Kadokawa Shoten\n\nGenre: Adventure\n\nTheme: Love\n\nRelease: 10.20.2005\n\nPrice: 7140\n\nShuffle! on the Stage takes place in a world where demons, gods and humans exist together.

In addition to a couple of single player quiz modes, the game lets up to eight players get together for multiplayer play using the multitap. The game includes four unique types of quizzes.\n\nNintendo DS\n\nAkachan ha Doko\n\nKara Kuruno?\n\nPublisher: Sega\n\nGenre: Action\n\nTheme: Love\n\nRelease: 10.20.2005\n\nPrice: 5040\n\nAkachan ha Doko Kara Kur no (rough translation to \"Where do Babies Come From\") is a sequel to Sega's DS launch title, Feel the Magic. The game offers similar mini-game play, but powered up with new games and modes. In all, seven modes of play are included, among them modes where you can customize your girlfriend and make a baby to your liking.\n\nKenshuui Tendou\n\nDokuta 2: Inochi\n\nno Tenbin\n\nPublisher: Spike\n\nGenre: Adventure\n\nRelease: 10.20.2005\n\nPrice: 5040\n\nTendo Dokuta returns in a sequel, less than a year after the DS original hailed the birth of the surgery genre. You play as Dokuta, a young medical intern. Now in his second year, Dokuta will serve not only at a major hospital, but on a tropical island to the south as well. Like the original, the game mixes conversation sequences with surgery sequences where you use the touch pen to make precise cuts. Between chapters of the story, you can try out mini games, including games where you fry octopus (takoyaki) and go fishing.\n\nPokemon Torouze\n\nPublisher: Pokemon\n\nGenre: Action, Puzzle\n\nTheme: Anime\n\nRelease: 10.20.2005\n\nPrice: 3800\n\nThe second DS Pokemon game is a falling blocks puzzle game with over 380 Pokemon faces used for the pieces.

The game includes support for download play and wireless battle.\n\nSuper Princess Peach\n\nPublisher: Nintendo\n\nGenre: Action, Adventure\n\nRelease: 10.20.2005\n\nPrice: 4800\n\nThe roles are reversed in this \"Mario\" title. This time around, Mario's the one who's been kidnapped by Koopa, and Peach sets out to rescue him. While the top screen looks like a traditional platformer, the bottom screen shows a closeup of Peach's face along with four \"emotion\" icons. By tapping the icons, you make Peach assume the associated state of mind, resulting in attacks and other effects. The game also includes mini games.\n\nUrusei Yatsura Endless Summer\n\nPublisher: Taito\n\nGenre: Adventure\n\nTheme: Comic\n\nRelease: 10.20.2005\n\nPrice: 5040\n\nThis game is based off the famous comic and anime of the same name.

Depending on the race, the type of patrol car changes. The game also includes game sharing, allowing for multi player play with just one cartridge.\n\nFuku Fuku no Shima\n\nPublisher: SCE\n\nGenre: Other\n\nRelease: 10.20.2005\n\nPrice: 5040\n\nFuku Fuku Shima takes place on an island that exists in the space between reality and your dreams.

Send your comments to the IGN Japan mailbag.\n\nTurn the page for a look at the Xbox 360 launch.\n\nLAUNCH WATCH\n\nLast year, when the PSP and DS launches took place right on top of one another, Gaming Life in Japan provided you with weekly updates on the state of both system's launch programs. We're certain that Microsoft Japan will be pushing the Xbox 360 just as hard as Sony and Nintendo pushed their systems last year, so we've resurrected our Launch Watch feature for the Xbox 360 launch Every week, we'll let you in on what's going down in Xbox 360 launch land over in Japan.\n\nThe start of this feature coincides nicely with a recent update on the Xbox 360 launch in Famitsu -- the main Famitsu, not Famitsu Xbox 360 (the next Famitsu Xbox 360 should make it out in time for next week's Gaming Life in Japan). Famitsu reveals a few big plans cooking over at Microsoft's Shinjuku Japanese office. Here's a little time-line:\n\n10/26 - 10/29: WPC EXPO 2005\n\nMr. Maruyama from Microsoft mentioned in previous interviews that Microsoft would be unveiling some new Xbox 360 feature at this event. The feature is supposedly meant to be for Japan what Media Center compatibility is for America, as Media Center isn't all that big in Japan.\n\n10/30: HUMAN FESTA 2005\n\nXbox 360 will be at this event, which takes place at a college in Japan's far southern Fukuoka region. We probably won't go there as a result of the distance, but if you happen to be in Fukuoka, send us pics!\n\n11/1: IT BEGINS\n\nOn the first of November, Microsoft will open the doors to its Xbox 360 lounge in Tokyo's chic Omotesando shopping district (IGN passed by the shop recently -- it's nearing completion and has at last started to take its final form). On the same day, MS will begin its official Xbox 360 television ad campaign. We've been told to expect commercials that focus on the games and the system and don't make use of celebrities.\n\n11/5: JINDAI FESTIVAL\n\nAnother college festival, this one at the Yokohama campus of Kanagawa University (aka \"Jindai\"). We may take a look, although our real reason for being there will be to look for hot college girls.\n\n11/12, 11/13: GAMES JAPAN FESTA IN OSAKA\n\nThe fourth Osaka games festival will see a big presence from Microsoft.\n\n11/20: XBOX 360 RETAIL KIOSKS\n\nMicrosoft will be shipping out 2000 Xbox 360 demo units to retail for display starting 11/20. Each unit will include a 23-inch high definition monitor.\n\n11/26: DESIGN FESTA VOL.22\n\nTaking place in Tokyo Big Site, this will be the last major event before the Xbox 360 launch.\n\n12/10: XBOX 360 LAUNCH\n\nWe've already pre-ordered (see below).\n\n12/17, 12/18: JUMP FESTA 2006\n\nThe annual Jump Festa is usually reserved for anime properties and Square Enix games. It's possible that Microsoft will show off Blue Dragon here, as the Mistwalker title was first unveiled in Weekly Jump magazine.\n\nThe fun has actually already begun. A few retails have started taking pre-orders for the Xbox 360, requiring that interested parties put down 1,000 yen.\n\nFor the record, Bic is selling the 360 at a price point of 38,800 yen, 1,000 yen less than the official price. Currently, the store is taking pre-orders only for the system and peripherals. Game pre-orders will start in the near future, we were told.\n\nMicrosoft has also started sending out box images to websites. Here are a few that we were able to find. Some of these can be clicked on to enlarge:\n\nAnd, of course, the print ads have been going on for some time now. Turn the page for the ad section, where you'll find the latest batch of Xbox 360 ads.\n\nHOUKOKU CORNER\n\nWelcome to the Gaming Life in Japan ad section, where you'll find the latest game advertisements, commercials and pamphlet scans from Japan. Every week, we'll be bringing you commercials, ads and pamphlets that we've spotted on TV, in magazines and at retailers or trade shows. Also be sure and check out the back issues section for previous installments.\n\nCommercials were somewhat light this week, so we instead put the IGN Japan scanner to work to get you a bunch of print ads, including some hot ads for Akadoko.

Send them to the IGN Japan mailbag.\n\nTurn the page for the latest release dates from Japan.\n\nRELEASE DATES\n\nThis section of Gaming Life in Japan provides you with an up-to-date release list of games coming out in Japan. We list pretty much everything that's been announced, including games that currently have just vague TBA release dates and even games that don't have final names (hence the abundance of \"Title TBA\" games).\n\nAs a source for these dates, we use a strange combination of retailers, magazines, store pamphlets and official websites. Wherever possible, we try to keep the dates official, so if it's just a rumor, you won't find it here.\n\nBe sure and check back every week to keep up with the myriad of releases set for Japan. And if you encounter an error, please tell us.\n\nPlayStation 2\n\nRELEASEGAMEPUBYEN10.27.05Atelier Marie + Elie: Zarlburg no Renkinjutsushi 1&2Gust714010.27.05Atelier Marie + Elie: Zarlburg no Renkinjutsushi 1&2 (Premium Box)Gust1029010.27.05Call of Duty: Finest HourCapcom714010.27.05CloverHearts looking for happiness (Best Version)Interchannel304510.27.05Desire (Best Version)Interchannel304510.27.05Eureka Seven TR1: New WaveBandai732910.27.05Golden Eye Dark Agent (EA Best Hits)Electronic Arts312910.27.05Kill ZoneSega714010.27.05Konneko ~ Keep a Memory Green ~Yeti714010.27.05Konneko ~ Keep a Memory Green ~ (Limited First Press Version)Yeti871510.27.05Langrisser IIITaito609010.27.05Memories Off #5: Togireta FilmKid714010.27.05Memories Off #5: Togireta Film (Limited Edition)Kid924010.27.05Oretachi Gesen Zoku: Burger TimeHamster200010.27.05Oretachi Gesen Zoku: Super VolleyballHamster200010.27.05Oretachi Gesen Zoku: Terra CrestaHamster200010.27.05Oretachi Gesen Zoku: Yie Ar Kung FuHamster200010.27.05Pachinko Suido Oumon Pachitte Chonmage Tatsujin 9Huckberry588010.27.05Sega Ages 2500 Series Vol. 20 Space Harrier II ~ Space Harrier Complete CollectionSega262510.27.05Sega Ages 2500 Series Vol. 21 SDI & Quartet: Sega System 16 CollectionSega262510.27.05SuperLite 2000 Adventure AkaiitoSuccess210010.27.05Ultimate Pro PinballTaito504010.27.05Ultraman Fighting Evolution RebirthBanpresto714010.27.05Wanda to KyozouSony Computer Entertainment714010.27.05Yoshitsune Eiyuuden ShuraFrom Software522911.02.05Another Century's Episode (PlayStation 2 the Best)Banpresto380011.02.05Beat DownCapcom714011.02.05Bokujou Monogatari Oh!
