        "text": "Bunta Takakura is a character from the Japanese animated series, Crayon Shin-chan.\n\nContents\n\n1 Basic Information\n\n2 Foreign Language Differences\n\n2.1 Europe/South America\n\n2.2 North America\n\n2.3 India\n\n3 Trivia\n\n4 Quotes\n\nBasic Information\n\nBunta Takakura is the principal of the Futaba Kindergarten. He can be very stressed out by the kids at times, but he is kind hearted. His wife is the vice principal.\n\nTakakura is usually referred to as Encho, meaning principal. Shin sometimes refers to him as Kumicho, meaning the Yakuza boss, due to his Yakuza-like appearance. Others in the neighborhood misunderstand him because of this.\n\nForeign Language Differences\n\nEurope/South America\n\nVitello and Phuuz's versions takes a hint from the Encho title and renames Bunta Takakura to Principal Enzo.\n\nNorth America\n\nFUNimation's version also takes a hint from the Encho title and renames the character to Principal Bernoulli Ench. He also has a Hispanic accent, given to him by actor Jason Liebrecht.\n\nIndia\n\nIndia's version renames the character to Gang Leader Sir, due to Shin Chan usually calling him 'Kumicho' in the original series.\n\nTrivia\n\nFor a few episodes, Takakura masqueraded himself as a superhero named Enchoman, but Shin discovered his true identity rather easily. Enchoman was forced to let Shin join to keep the secret, but as others find out, it becomes more than it's worth, and Takakura quits the charade."
