The manga follows the adventures of the five-year-old kid Shinnosuke Nohara with his family and friends in Kasukabe, Saitama Prefecture. Shin-chan is mostly known for dancing while shaking his butt and yelling \"Buri Buri!\" and by drawing an elephant on his penis and start moving his hips while saying \"Zō-san, Zō-san!\" (\"Mr. Elephant, Mr. Elephant!\"). He also hates green peppers.\n\nCrayon Shin-chan gained popularity among adults and even kids in Japan, despite it being a seinen manga. The anime and manga were a success with 20+ movies and a lot of merchandise being made.\n\nIn September 11th, 2009, Yoshito Usui disappeared when going hiking in nearby Gunma Prefecture. On September 19th, 2009, his body was found dead at the bottom of a cliff at Mount Arafune. After this event the last volume of the manga was released in 2010, but members of the Yoshito Usui Team made a new manga on the same year titled New Crayon Shin-chan (新クレヨンしんちゃん Shin Kureyon Shin-chan).\n\nCrayon Shin-chan had many guest characters, one of the most remarkable being Kyary Pamyu Pamyu, singer and protagonist of PONPONPON.\n\nAn spin-off series called Crayon Shin-chan Gaiden consisting of three seasons is exclusively streaming on Amazon Prime Video worldwide.

These dubs aired in the UK, Australia and in the Republic of Ireland. A translations of these dubs aired in some European countries and Latin America.\n\nThe third dub was made in 2005 by Funimation , this one being more like a parody, taking many liberties, using a lot of adult-jokes, making non-existent backstories of some characters and it wasn't censored. This dub was the only one released in the US, airing on Adult Swim with 3 seasons made and 5 DVD releases.\n\nThe fourth dub was produced in 2015 in Hong Kong and was commissioned by LUK Internacional. The dub was released in the European Nintendo 3DS eShop on December 22, 2016, consisting of 14 episodes.\n\nOnline Relevance\n\nShin-chan has received a lot of fanart from sites like pixiv (over 7000 results), especially beloved characters from movies and special episodes like Topemma, Buriburizaemon, Tsubaki-chan, Mari-chan, Action Kamen, Kantam Robo, Moepi and Robot Dad.
