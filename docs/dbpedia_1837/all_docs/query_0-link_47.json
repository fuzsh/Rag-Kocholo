No Game No Life No Game, No Life ノーゲーム・ノーライフ [Madhouse] (Finished 12/12)\n\nTags: Isekai, Strategy Game Comedy, Fantasy, Ecchi\n\nSixteen sentient races inhabit Disboard, a world overseen by Tet, the One True God. The lowest of the sixteen—Imanity—consists of humans, a race with no affinity for magic. In a place where everything is decided through simple games, humankind seems to have no way out of their predicament—but the arrival of two outsiders poses a change.\n\nOn Earth, stepsiblings Sora and Shiro are two inseparable shut-ins who dominate various online games under the username \"Blank.\" While notorious on the internet, the pair believe that life is merely another dull game. However, after responding to a message from an unknown user, they are suddenly transported to Disboard. The mysterious sender turns out to be Tet, who informs them about the world's absolute rules. After Tet leaves, Sora and Shiro begin their search for more information and a place to stay, taking them to Elkia—Imanity's only remaining kingdom.\n\nThere, the duo encounters Stephanie Dola, an emotional girl vying for the kingdom's sovereignty. In desperation, she attempts to regain her father's throne, but her foolhardiness makes her goal unachievable. Inspired by the girl's motivation and passion, Sora and Shiro decide to aid Stephanie in getting Elkia back on its feet, ultimately aiming to become the new rulers of the enigmatic realm.\n\nIt's definitely an enjoyable piece of art, but it's not finished and can't compared it to genius masterpieces in enjoyment. But can call it thought-provoking, so it deserves a 9..\n\nOverall Rating: 9/10\n\n2.Haikyuu!! ハイキュー!! [Production I.G] (Finished 1/25)\n\nTags: Shounen School, Team Sports\n\nEver since having witnessed the \"Little Giant\" and his astonishing skills on the volleyball court, Shouyou Hinata has been bewitched by the dynamic nature of the sport. Even though his attempt to make his debut as a volleyball regular during a middle school tournament went up in flames, he longs to prove that his less-than-impressive height ceases to be a hindrance in the face of his sheer will and perseverance.\n\nWhen Hinata enrolls in Karasuno High School, the Little Giant's alma mater, he believes that he is one step closer to his goal of becoming a professional volleyball player. Although the school only retains a shadow of its former glory, Hinata's conviction isn't shaken until he learns that Tobio Kageyama—the prodigy who humiliated Hinata's middle school volleyball team in a crushing defeat—is now his teammate.\n\nTo fulfill his desire of leaving a mark on the realm of volleyball—so often regarded as the domain of the tall and the strong—Hinata must smooth out his differences with Kageyama. Only when Hinata learns what it takes to be a part of a team will he be able to join the race to the top in earnest.\n\nI'm surprised to learn that there is such a popular anime about volleyball. But all I see is better than usually done shounen spokon with characters that I don't like, nothing really exceptional.\n\nOverall Rating: 6/10\n\n3.JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken Part 3: Stardust Crusaders JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders ジョジョの奇妙な冒険 スターダストクルセイダース [David Production] (Finished 1/24)\n\nTags: Shounen Action, Adventure, Supernatural\n\nYears after an ancient evil was salvaged from the depths of the sea, Joutarou Kuujou sits peacefully within a Japanese jail cell. He's committed no crime yet demands he not be released, believing he's been possessed by an evil spirit capable of harming those around him. Concerned for her son, Holy Kuujou asks her father, Joseph Joestar, to convince Joutarou to leave the prison. Joseph informs his grandson that the \"evil spirit\" is in fact something called a \"Stand,\" the physical manifestation of one's fighting spirit which can adopt a variety of deadly forms. After a fiery brawl with Joseph's friend Muhammad Avdol, Joutarou is forced out of his cell and begins learning how to control the power of his Stand.\n\nHowever, when a Stand awakens within Holy and threatens to consume her in 50 days, Joutarou, his grandfather, and their allies must seek out and destroy the immortal vampire responsible for her condition. They must travel halfway across the world to Cairo, Egypt and along the way, do battle with ferocious Stand users set on thwarting them. If Joutarou and his allies fail in their mission, humanity is destined for a grim fate.\n\nSequel.\n\nOverall Rating: 6/10\n\n4.Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei The Irregular at Magic High School 魔法科高校の劣等生 [Madhouse] (Finished 8/26)\n\nTags: School Action, Fantasy, Romance, Sci-Fi\n\nIn the dawn of the 21st century, magic, long thought to be folklore and fairy tales, has become a systematized technology and is taught as a technical skill. In First High School, the institution for magicians, students are segregated into two groups based on their entrance exam scores: \"Blooms,\" those who receive high scores, are assigned to the First Course, while \"Weeds\" are reserve students assigned to the Second Course.\n\nMahouka Koukou no Rettousei follows the siblings, Tatsuya and Miyuki Shiba, who are enrolled in First High School. Upon taking the exam, the prodigious Miyuki is placed in the First Course, while Tatsuya is relegated to the Second Course. Though his practical test scores and status as a \"Weed\" show him to be magically inept, he possesses extraordinary technical knowledge, physical combat capabilities, and unique magic techniques—making Tatsuya the irregular at a magical high school.\n\nI remember liking the beginning and characters, but it got stale and boring eventually as interest in the possible story developments got lost. It seemed to have all the right cards, but it did not work out for me.\n\nOverall Rating: 6/10\n\n5.Fairy Tail (2014) Fairy Tail Series 2 FAIRY TAIL（フェアリーテイル） [A-1 Pictures, Bridge] (Finished 1/102)\n\nTags: Shounen Action, Adventure, Fantasy\n\nThe Grand Magic Games reaches its climax following Natsu Dragneel and Gajeel Redfox's stunning victory over Sting Eucliffe and Rogue Cheney of the Sabertooth guild. This success pushes the Fairy Tail guild closer to being crowned the overall champions, but obtaining victory isn't the only challenge they face. A mystery still surrounds a hooded stranger and the ominous Eclipse Gate, leaving more questions than answers.\n\nMore crazy adventures are on the horizon for Fairy Tail as their destructive antics and joyful rowdiness continue unabated. Their greatest trial is quickly approaching, but united as a family, the guild will always be ready to face any threat that comes their way.\n\nSequel.\n\nOverall Rating: 6/10\n\n6.Black Bullet ブラック・ブレット BLACK BULLET ［黒の銃弾］ [Kinema Citrus, Orange] (Finished 3/13)\n\nTags: Action, Mystery, Sci-Fi\n\nIn the year 2021, a parasitic virus known as \"Gastrea\" infects humans and turns them into monsters. What is left of mankind now lives within the Monolith walls, walls that are made of Varanium, the only material that can hurt Gastrea.\n\nTo counter the threat that the Gastrea pose, \"Cursed Children\"—female children whose bodies contain trace amounts of the virus which grant them superhuman abilities—officially called Initiators by the Tendo Civil Security, are given partners called Promoters, people who work to guide and protect the young Initiators. These teams of two are sent out on missions to fight the monsters created by the Gastrea virus and keep them at bay.\n\nBlack Bullet revolves around the team of Enju Aihara, an Initiator, and Satomi Rentaro, a Promoter, as they go on missions to fight the growing threat of Gastrea in their hometown of Tokyo.\n\nI remember dropping it, because it was too unserious and ridiculous to my taste. It just does not live up to expectations and disappoints on the way.\n\nOverall Rating: 6/10\n\n7.Date A Live II デート・ア・ライブⅡ [Production IMS] (Finished 1/10)\n\nTags: Harem, Mecha, School Action, Romance, Sci-Fi\n\nSpirits are otherworldly entities with immense power, capable of creating spatial quakes whenever they appear. One way of dealing with them is through brute force and killing them... or making them fall in love and sealing their powers.\n\nHaving sealed three Spirits, Shidou Itsuka continues his mission with Ratatoskr in locating more spirits and dating them, to ensure the world's safety from further destruction. However, this time around, their problems will not be limited to Spirits as a more imposing threat seems to have noticed their activities.\n\nSequel.\n\nOverall Rating: 6/10\n\n8.Mekakucity Actors メカクシティアクターズ [Shaft] (Finished 2/12)\n\nTags: Super Power Sci-Fi, Supernatural\n\nOn the hot summer day of August 14, Shintarou Kisaragi is forced to leave his room for the first time in two years. While arguing with the cyber girl Ene who lives in his computer, Shintarou Kisaragi accidentally spills soda all over his keyboard. Though they try to find a replacement online, most stores are closed due to the Obon festival, leaving them with no other choice but to visit the local department store. Venturing outside makes Shintarou extremely anxious, but the thought of living without his computer is even worse. It's just his luck that on the day he finally goes out, he's caught in a terrifying hostage situation.\n\nLuckily, a group of teenagers with mysterious eye powers, who call themselves the \"Mekakushi Dan,\" assist Shintarou in resolving the situation. As a result, he is forced to join their group, along with Ene. Their abilities seem to be like pieces of a puzzle, connecting one another, and as each member's past is unveiled, the secret that ties them together is slowly brought to light.\n\nIt's abstract and pretentious, plus each episode has different characters who probably meet by the end in some combined story. Basically, I just don't care about these characters and these stories - they are plainly not interesting.\n\nOverall Rating: 6/10\n\n9.Ping Pong the Animation ピンポン THE ANIMATION [Tatsunoko Production] (Finished 11/11)\n\nTags: Seinen Award Winning, Drama, Sports\n\nDespite being polar opposites, Makoto \"Smile\" Tsukimoto and Yutaka \"Peco\" Hoshino have been best friends since childhood. Although the overly confident Peco strives to be the best ping-pong player in the world, he often skips practice, earning the ire of his fellow teammates on the Katase High School ping-pong team. Meanwhile, Smile—in spite of his innate talent for the sport—cannot help but hold back his full strength when playing against others. Through their mutual love for ping-pong, the two have developed a bond that is seemingly unbreakable.\n\nWhen Peco hears that an ex-national team player from China is coming to Japan, he drags Smile over to rival Tsujido High School to observe them. The subsequent trip leads to a clash between Peco and Kong Wenge, who overwhelmingly defeats the former in one game. Stunned by such a comprehensive loss, Peco finds himself questioning why he plays to begin with. Seeing his potential as a player, Katase's coach begins to train Smile to overcome his hesitation, but he is reluctant to play if it is not for enjoyment.\n\nAs the two struggle to find meaning in the sport, a plethora of stronger players—each with their own internal strifes—await them at the inter-high tournament, where only the very best can persevere. But when these young athletes let their unbridled ambition go unchecked, the hardships they face paint a somber reality as they pursue glory.\n\nI skipped it before thinking it's another spokon, but I heard in podcasts that it's not usual spokon and that it's unique in what it does, so here I am. It's more about backgrounds and motivations and paths and relations, but I keep comparing it with old The Ping-Pong club anime which seem to have a lot of roots for this one. Anyway, it's short and meaningful, it deserves a honorary masterpiece.\n\nOverall Rating: 7/10\n\n10.Bokura wa Minna Kawai-sou The Kawai Complex Guide to Manors and Hostel Behavior 僕らはみんな河合荘 [Brain's Base] (Finished 12/12)\n\nTags: Seinen Romantic Subtext, School Slice of Life\n\nKazunari Usa is a high school freshman who will start living alone due to his parents now working in a different area. Excited for his new independent life, he hopes to go about his teenage days without the worry of dealing with any strange people, but as he soon discovers, his new boarding house Kawai Complex is far from ordinary.\n\nThe various tenants at Kawai Complex are all quite eccentric characters. Shirosaki, Kazunari's roommate, is a pervert and masochist; Mayumi Nishikino, a borderline alcoholic office lady, hates couples because of her unfortunate luck with men; and Sayaka Watanabe, a seemingly innocent college student, enjoys leading men on. Shocked with the lack of decent individuals at his new residence, Kazunari is about to leave when he runs into shy senior student Ritsu Kawai and finds himself slowly falling in love with her.\n\nMaison Ikkoku is a pretty good setting, so it was only a matter of time till it inspired a similar work. I probably dropped it on the way, but don't remember where or why, so it's time to finish it. And now I get the reasons - this show is slow, aimless. repetitive and somewhat immature. Protagonists in modern anime are much more realistic and complex.\n\nOverall Rating: 6/10\n\n11.Hitsugi no Chaika Chaika -The Coffin Princess- 棺姫のチャイカ [Bones] (Finished 3/12)\n\nTags: Action, Adventure, Fantasy, Romance\n\nFor 500 years, the Taboo Emperor, Arthur Gaz, ruled the Gaz Empire with an iron fist and conducted inhumane experiments on his own people. But his reign came to an end five years ago, when mighty warriors—later known as the Eight Heroes—defeated him in a battle for the capital. His death ended the 300-yearlong war between the Gaz Empire and the alliance of six nations.\n\nIn the present day, Tooru Acura is a former saboteur from the war who has difficulty settling into the peaceful world, as he cannot find a job where he can put his fighting skills to use. An opportunity appears before him, however, when he meets a white-haired Wizard named Chaika Trabant. With a coffin on her back, she is searching for the scattered remains of her father in order to give him a proper burial, and she hires Tooru and his adoptive sister Akari to help her. However, the six nations alliance, which have now formed the Council of Six Nations, dispatches Albéric Gillette and his men from the Kleeman Agency to pursue and apprehend the late Emperor Gaz's daughter—Chaika.\n\nWith the shocking revelation of Chaika's identity, the Acura siblings must choose between helping her gather the remains of the tyrannical emperor and upholding the peace the continent strives to maintain.\n\nI remember dropping it after first episode, because pilot is disastrous. But it gets to be just above average fantasy travel anime. With such story and quite bland characters there's not much to expect or enjoy.\n\nOverall Rating: 6/10\n\n12.Gokukoku no Brynhildr Brynhildr in the Darkness 極黒のブリュンヒルデ [Arms] (Finished 4/13)\n\nTags: Seinen Super Power Drama, Mystery, Sci-Fi\n\nVenturing into the wilderness, the skeptical Ryouta Murakami and the ambitious Kuroneko were on a quest to prove the existence of extraterrestrial life when a tragic accident occurred, reaping Kuroneko of her life and leaving Ryouta in a critically injured state.\n\nTen years have passed since the disaster, and Ryouta is now living a normal life in high school. He vows to prove that aliens are real in honor of his late friend. A transfer student named Neko Kuroha unexpectedly arrives one day, bearing a striking resemblance to the late Kuroneko—even sharing a similar name. Most mysteriously, she seems to possess supernatural powers.\n\nAs Ryouta takes more interest in Neko, he is drawn into a deadly world where dangerous scientists hunt magic-wielding witches that have escaped from their secret research laboratory. Neko is one of these escapees, but there are many others who are in similar situations, and it's up to Ryouta to protect them from their would-be captors.\n\nThis time mystery is about runaway magician girls who can foresee future. My old self dropped it early, but can't find anything worthwhile in it to go on either .\n\nOverall Rating: 6/10\n\n13.Isshuukan Friends. One Week Friends 一週間フレンズ。 [Brain's Base] (Finished 3/12)\n\nTags: Shounen School Comedy\n\nSixteen-year-old Yuuki Hase finally finds the courage to speak to his crush and ask her if she wants to become friends. The object of his affection, Kaori Fujimiya, is a quiet and reserved girl who cuts herself off from everyone and does not spare him the same blunt rejection she gives everybody else.\n\nSome time after, Yuuki finds her eating lunch on the roof where she secludes herself during break. He decides to start meeting with Kaori every day in the hopes of beginning to understand her better. The more time they spend together, the more she begins to open up to him. However, nearing the end of the week, she starts to push him away once more. It is then revealed to him the reason for Kaori's cold front: at the end of the week, her memories of those close to her, excluding her family, are forgotten, as they are reset every Monday. The result of an accident in middle school, the once popular and kind Kaori is now unable to make friends in fear of hurting the people dear to her.\n\nDetermined to become more than just one week friends, Yuuki asks her the exact same question each Monday: \"Would you like to be friends?\" Because he knows that deep down, Kaori wishes for that more than anything.\n\nCycled amnesia is super bad and cheesy way to execute romance ... I could never understand the appeal and never liked such works .\n\nOverall Rating: 6/10\n\n14.Soredemo Sekai wa Utsukushii The World is Still Beautiful それでも世界は美しい [Pierrot] (Finished 3/12)\n\nTags: Shoujo Adventure, Fantasy, Romance\n\nIn the Sun Kingdom, sunshine is part of its citizens' everyday lives, and rain is something that they have never even heard of. However, in a faraway land called the Rain Dukedom, the weather is reversed, and everybody has the power to create rain with their voices.\n\nLivius Ifrikia has conquered the entire world and expanded the Sun Kingdom's influence in the three short years since he was crowned king. Upon learning about the powers to create rain, Livius decides to marry Nike Remercier, one of the princesses of the Rain Dukedom. However, those outside the Sun Kingdom have spread a rumor that Livius is a cruel, ruthless, and tyrannical ruler, and as word reaches the princess, she begins to prepare herself for the worst. But when she finally meets her fiancé, Nike discovers that he is an entirely different person from what she originally expected.\n\nOf course I dumped it before, because it's just fantasy romance in artificial kingdoms. I require something more substantial.\n\nOverall Rating: 6/10\n\n15.Mushishi Zoku Shou Mushi-shi: Next Passage Part 1 蟲師 続章 [Artland] (Finished 1/10)\n\nTags: Seinen Adult Cast, Historical, Iyashikei Adventure, Mystery, Slice of Life, Supernatural\n\nPerceived as strange and feared by man, over time the misshapen ones came to be known as Mushi. Although they harbor no ill intentions towards humans, many suffer from the side effects of their existence and strange nature; exploiting the Mushi without understanding them, even unintentionally, can lead to disaster and strife for any involved. Mushishi Zoku Shou continues the story of Mushishi Ginko on his journey to help the visible world to coexist with the Mushi.\n\nDuring his travels, Ginko discovers various gifted individuals—those cursed by circumstance and those maintaining a fragile symbiosis with the Mushi—inevitably confronting the question of whether humanity, talented and tortured alike, can manage the responsibility of the unseen.

Being surrounded by numerous female assistants, he is constantly asking to use them as references for the manga he draws.\n\nAlthough Aito has an extremely degenerate mind, he can also be a very kind, generous, and helpful person. The duality of his behavior confuses his assistants—do they love the considerate side of him that he rarely displays, or do they hate him for the perverted thoughts he has most of the time?\n\nIt's half-length episodic silly comedy, but I have really positive recollections, probably because I like the theme and characters here.

But there's a catch: she, along with 11 of her fellow students in Class Black, is an assassin taking part in the challenge to kill their sweet-natured classmate, Haru Ichinose. Whoever succeeds will be granted their deepest desire, no matter the difficulty or cost. However, each assassin only gets one chance; if they fail to kill her, they will be expelled.\n\nDespite the extraordinary reward, Tokaku decides to take a different course of action. Though Haru is her target, the young assassin soon finds herself drawn to the very girl she is supposed to kill. With the entire class out for Haru, Tokaku refuses to let her friend die, vowing to protect her from a growing bloodlust.\n\nIt's pretty straightforward - 11 assassins are enough to fill 10 episodes, plus two for intro. I require some special mood to enjoy such assassin action. But just comparing to other battle royales, it does not stand out much.\n\nOverall Rating: 6/10\n\n18.Love Live!

However, this new change was a dark conspiracy hatched by “Chichi Yure Doumei (The Association of Fathers)” to create a strong father figure for all the fathers in Japan. Soon, many dads in the whole nation go out of control, and the Nohara family (Shinnosuke's family) and Kasukabe start falling apart. Before the near-collapse of Kasukabe, Shinnosuke and Hiroshi i.e. Robot dad stand up to save the day. Featuring the most intense battle of middle-aged men, the movie brings a touching story that makes all fathers and families in Japan cry.\n\nI'm not enojying these thematic adventures, not sure why I keep watching them, probably because there aren't many left.\n\nOverall Rating: 6/10\n\n47.Nemure Omoigo, Sora no Shitone ni ねむれ思い子 空のしとねに [Hand to Mouse.] (Finished 1/1)\n\nTags: Space Adventure, Drama\n\nA family was riding a car on their way home from a maternity hospital.
