        "text": "Crayon Shin-chan (クレヨンしんちゃん Kureyon Shin-chan), also known as Shin Chan, is a Japanese anime based on the manga series written and illustrated by Yoshito Usui. The show first began airing on TV Asahi in 1992, and is ongoing as of 2022, with over 1,200 episodes.\n\nThe series has had various localization attempts for English-speaking viewers, with the most well known being a gag-dub by FUNimation that aired on Adult Swim.\n\nDubbing History[]\n\nGloman Co., Ltd.[]\n\nThe first known English dub was made in South Korea and was intended to teach South Korean kids English. Episodes were released on VCD in South Korea by the company Gloman Co., Ltd. (글로만) from early 2001 until about late 2003 (when the company's websites shut down) as part of its \"TV Ani•POPS English 21\" monthly subscription learning program. Licensing was handled by Animation International. Gloman was in charge of planning, editing, and publishing, and manufacturing was done by Sangrok Multimedia. The first six volumes credit educational company Samsungdang Media (삼성당미디어) instead of Gloman. English was taught by the multimedia program through magazines and VCD videos, acting as the textbooks. Each volume included a booklet, alongside three audio cassette tapes and a VCD, containing English dubbed episodes to watch or to read and follow along with. The bilingual booklets contained episode scripts with screenshots, and each VCD was subtitled in English and Korean. A VHS option was also available, chosen upon subscription. Initaial volumes were dubbed by Hanbit Video Production Co., Ltd. and later ones by Toy Production Co., Ltd., with some changes in voice roles.\n\nLacey Entertainment[]\n\nThe series was dubbed into English by Vitello Productions in Burbank, California through 2001–2002, when TV Asahi and Lacey Entertainment decided to market the series worldwide. The dub featured veteran voice actors such as Kath Soucie, Russi Taylor, Grey DeLisle, Pat Fraley, Eric Loomis and Anndi McAfee playing the characters. During the early 2000s, it ran on Fox Kids (and later Jetix) in the United Kingdom, on Fox Kids in Australia and on RTÉ Two in Ireland.\n\nMany characters had their names changed to American-sounding ones, the original background music was completely replaced with new background music, and scenes with nudity were edited to remove any signs of indecent exposure. Most adult jokes were re-made into family-friendly jokes, and the profanity was edited out. However, the frequent appearance of Shinnosuke's naked buttocks, as well as humor relating to breast-size and sexual themes, remained in the finished product. Some episodes that displayed adult material and mature content were not dubbed at all. Additionally, the episodes were dubbed out of their original order which created continuity errors. For example, episode 29 shows Shin bringing his classmates to visit his newborn sister, episode 30 shows his sister coming home from her birth in the hospital and in episode 52 it was revealed that Shin was going to have a sister.\n\nIn 2003, Phuuz Entertainment (formerly Media Concepts) was commissioned by Lacey Entertainment to continue the dub in similar style as the Vitello dub. However, the Phuuz dub contained none of the original voice cast from Vitello's, with all the characters voices being replaced with a different talent pool.\n\n52 episodes have been produced by Vitello and another 52 episodes by Phuuz, with the total of episodes being 104. The episodes lasted on an average 21 minutes and contained three segments of 5 to 7 minutes. As both dubs have never been released in the US and had limited release in other countries, they are very difficult to find, with the Phuuz dub being near-impossible to find.\n\nFUNimation[]\n\nFUNimation Entertainment acquired the Shin-chan North America license in 2006. As per all international licenses for the series, TV Asahi remained a licensing partner for North America.\n\nFUNimation's dub features their Texas-based cast of voice actors. FUNimation's dub was in a comedic gag-dub style, similar to ADV Films' dub of Ghost Stories, and takes many liberties with the source material and was heavily Americanized. Similar to the Vitello dub, episodes of the series were dubbed out of their original order, and segments were reordered. Additionally, many characters had their names changed to American-sounding ones (though much less compared to the previous attempts, most name changes were for comedic purposes). Many sexual references, dark humor, and references to current popular American culture were added.\n\nNew, previously non-existent backstories were created, as well as significantly different personalities for the characters. For instance, the unseen father of Nene (known in the dub as \"Penny\") was suggested to be physically abusive toward both his wife and daughter, and this was used as a source of black humor. Principal Ench was rewritten as a half Cuban, half Gypsy man with a complicated prior life that includes a stint as a magician, in which he accidentally injured scores of audience members. Masumi Ageo (known in the dub as \"Miss Polly\"), Shinnosuke's teacher, was rewritten as a kinky nymphomaniac, while Shin's schoolmate, Kazama, (known in the dub as \"Georgie\") was portrayed as a hawkish conservative.\n\nThe first 52 episodes of the dub aired on Adult Swim. All three seasons, 26 episodes per season, have also been released on DVD. Season 3, released in 2011, culminated in the official finale, effectively ending the Funimation series. Netflix streamed the series in the United States from April 6, 2011 until November 13, 2012. Seasons 1, 2, and 3 were once available for streaming on the US version of Hulu, they were also temporarily available for streaming in the US on the streaming service of Funimation. The series is currently unavailable for streaming.\n\nLUK Internacional[]\n\nA fourth English dub of Crayon Shin-chan was produced in Hong Kong by Red Angel Media in 2015 and was commissioned by LUK Internacional, the company that produces the Spanish, Portuguese, the second Italian and the second French dubs of Crayon Shin-chan and commissioned the Doraemon dub that aired on Boomerang UK. The dub was translated from LUK Internacional's Spanish dub, which is close to the Japanese original and has no censorship. The first three volumes of the dub were released in the European and South African Nintendo 3DS eShop on December 22, 2016, and the fourth and fifth volumes were released on December 29, 2016.\n\nWision DVD Production[]\n\nIn South Korea, 12 segments of the anime were dubbed into English and released on learn English VCDs and DVDs under the title “English with Jjanggu”, across 4 volumes. Wision DVD Production and later Daekyung DVD served as distributors. In this dub, Shin-chan's name is changed into \"Shin Jjanggu\" (신짱구), which is coined by his original Japanese name and the Korean word \"jjanggu\" (짱구) for \"protruding forehead.\" In Korea, the animated version is severely censored compared to the original Japanese version. The voice cast for the South Korean English dub is currently unknown, being different between the first two volumes released in 2004 by Wision and the last two volumes released in 2006 by Daekyung.\n\nCast[]\n\nImage Character Seiyū Vitello Dub\n\n(Lacey Entertainment Episodes 1-52) Phuuz Dub\n\n(Lacey Entertainment Episodes 53-104) FUNimation Dub\n\n(78 Episodes) Main Characters Nohara Family Shinnosuke Nohara Akiko Yajima\n\n(eps. 1-969) Kath Soucie Diane Michelle Laura Bailey Yumiko Kobayashi\n\n(eps. 970-on) Misae Nohara Miki Narahashi Julie Maddalena Cynthia Cranz Hiroshi Nohara Keiji Fujiwara\n\n(eps. 1-905) Eric Loomis Peter Doyle Chuck Huber Toshiyuki Morikawa\n\n(eps. 906-on) Himawari Nohara Satomi Kōrogi Russi Taylor Colleen Clinkenbeard Secondary Characters Misae's Family Yoshiji Koyama Kenichi Sakaguchi John Swasey Hisae Koyama Noriko Uemura Russi Taylor Wendy Powell Musae Koyama Michiko Neya Carli Mosier Hiro's Family Ginnosuke Nohara Ginzō Matsuo\n\n(eps. 1-428) Pat Fraley Sonny Strait Chō\n\n(eps. 429-on) Tsuru Nohara Chie Kitagawa Russi Taylor Futaba Kindergarten Sunflower Class Tōru Kazama Mari Mashiba Grey DeLisle Hope Levy Brina Palencia Bo Suzuki Chie Satō Eric Loomis Richard Cansino Chris Cason Nene Sakurada Tamao Hayashi Anndi McAfee Michelle Ruff Carrie Savage Masao Sato Teiyū Ichiryūsai Russi Taylor Barbara Goodson Colleen Clinkenbeard Ai Suotome Ayako Kawasumi Monica Rial Rose Class Yasuo Kawamura Tomoko Ōtsuka Russi Taylor Trina Nishimura Kindergarden Staff Ume Matsuzaka Michie Tomizawa Grey DeLisle Clarine Harp Midori Ishizaka Yumi Takada\n\n(first voice) Anndi McAfee Cindy Robinson Caitlin Glass Haruhi Nanao\n\n(second voice) Masumi Ageo Kotono Mitsuishi Jamie Marchi Bunta Takakura Rokurō Naya\n\n(first voice) Pat Fraley Jason Liebrecht Junpei Morita\n\n(second voice) Shiizou Atsukuru Kazunari Tanaka Todd Haberkorn Kindergarden Students & Staff Relatives Junichi Ishizaka Naoki Bandō Kevin M.

Soucie said that had the contract not expired, she would have quit herself, as she found the characters unlikable and wasn't pleased with the show's humor. DeLisle has admitted that she only did the dub for money, saying that the show was awful and its humor didn't translate well into English, with her even saying \"I'm going to go to hell for this. This is, like, really bad for my soul.\"\n\nIn contrast to DeLisle and Soucie, Cynthia Cranz (Misae's voice actress in Funimation's dub) on the other hand has admitted that Shin-chan was one of her favourite shows to work on and she admitted that she really misses voicing her. [2]\n\nCynthia Cranz was told the reason why FUNimation chose not to continue dubbing Shin-chan was due to conflicts with TV Asahi as they found some of the jokes in their dub offensive. [3]\n\nFUNimation originally intended to release their first Shin-chan DVD with an accompanying Japanese audio track and English subtitles, but wound up unable to clear the rights. Considering the dub consisted of cut and spliced skits from different episodes (many having aired many years apart), it may have also been difficult to have the rights to each original segment's audio cleared.\n\nThe oldest vignette featured in FUNimation's dub is from 1995.\n\nTransmission[]\n\nDate(s) Channel Dub Country 2002-2003 Fox Kids Vitello & Phuuz United Kingdom 2004-2005 Jetix 2006-2009 Cartoon Network\n\n(Adult Swim) FUNimation United States\n\nVideo Releases[]\n\nDistributor Year Format Contents Dub Region Country Magna Pacific 2004-2005 20 Episodes Vitello 4\n\nPAL Australia 5 Volumes FUNimation Entertainment 2008-2011 The Complete Dub FUNimation 1\n\nNTSC United States 6 Volumes 2010-2013 The Complete Dub 3 Volumes\n\nSee Also[]\n\nSuper Shiro\n\nCrayon Shin-chan Spin-off\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
