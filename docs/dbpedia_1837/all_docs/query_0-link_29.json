        "text": "roundup on all the shit i've been watching. i'm a few weeks behind since i've been focusing on my backlog more but i still figured i'd talk about what i've been enjoying.\n\nDororo\n\nit's good. not really a lot to say just didn't want you to think i dropped it.\n\nEkoda-chan\n\nnot the best thing i'm watching right now but it's so low commitment that there's no real reason for me to drop it. some of the interviews are pretty insightful too, although i'm not sure they had to be 6x the length of the actual episode.\n\nKaguya-sama\n\nomata is trying so hard to ape shaft's style without really understanding what makes it tick. he'll just do something retarded like make half the screen red and the other half a kaleidoscope and all the people who think itamura's monogatari looks good will clap their hands and eagerly reach for their wallets to buy the bds. rakugo shinjuu wasn't really my cup of tea but the direction was super tight so when i saw omata would be doing kaguya-sama i might have gotten my hopes up to high. needless to say i'll be sticking to the manga from now on.\n\nKemurikusa\n\nwasn't expecting to enjoy this show as much as i did based on my initial reaction to it but i've been catching up on it and it's honestly not too shabby. is it incredible? no, far from but it's still a fun watch if you pace yourself. i'm not a duty-bound tatsuki shill so you can trust my opinion on this.\n\nMob\n\ni'll be honest i'm not as into this season as everyone else but it's still good enough that i don't really mind watching an episode every week. none of the episodes have left that big of an impression on me so far but i'm still holding out for the finale.\n\nPrecure\n\nnothing's really grabbing me about this season but i don't really mind, it's just plain entertaining and kappard is frankly badass, hope we see more of him.\n\nUeno-san\n\nthe only show along with precure that i insta-watch each week. you might be sleeping on ueno-san just because it's a fetishbait flash cartoon but i assure you that it's a fetishbait flash cartoon of the absolute highest caliber. in all honesty this will probably end up snagging the title of aots for me.\n\nWataTen\n\nsurprisingly enjoyable all things considered. it's basically diet ichigo mashimaro but i'll be damned if i don't love that show too.\n\nthat's all. everything else was dropped within three episodes. kind of wanted to check out egao no daika and the new moriwaki but i cba.\n\nNot too sure who still reads things like Tower of God but if you haven't started yet or had apprehensions I would without a doubt start reading it here (support the developer please!) Tower of God just finished its hiatus and break for seasons 2 and 3, with season 3 started this Monday. It is hands down my favorite series ever, I rank it above things like Gurren Lagann, Hunter x Hunter, even things I've read like One Piece or Berserk in terms of Shonen capabilites. It takes some inspiration from things like Hunter x Hunter with how fights are often set up with unique ways to beat things, strategy wise, and a lot of the fights aren't just who has the biggest blast.\n\nI find the artwork to be absolutely amazing if you're into that although admittedly it is not amazing in the first season (roughly the first 70 chapters) but picks up to be absolutely mindboggling detailed in later chapters. The character designs are usually unique enough that everyone finds some favorites, with my personal favorite being the Slayer, White. Other ones I really like are Koon Aguero Agnis and Hwa Ryun. Below are some screencaps of my favorite depictions of these characters (of White, the greatest character of them all).\n\nThe thing I love most about Tower of God is the foreshadowing and worldbuilding behind it. If you know me you know that my favorite games are things like Dark Souls, Hollow Knight, etc, and in part you also know that I like those games with the amount of lore hidden in the background for people to discover. Tower of God is the same way, although much more intentional and laid out for the average reader. To start with the series focuses on Baam, an otherwise ordinary dude who enters a \"tower\" to compete, albeit unwillingly. The tower is a place where there are 134 floors (possibly more though the highest anyone has gotten is 134) with each floor requiring a test of some kind to progress, usually where you compete against other test candidates, often to the death. It's a grueling place where teammates are often disposable, outright power isn't the only thing that will allow you to win the fight, and with clearly defined \"winners and losers.' By that I mean that from the start the author foreshadows these giants in the world to exist and influence world events, and the vast majority of people you meet are just no name \"fishes.\" You can read Hunter x Hunter, for example, and learn about Ging from episode 1, but he's never actually shown until like 140 episodes in, or Naruto and the \"big names\" like Hashirama or Madara aren't even mentioned or shown until way later. Tower of God does this idea so much better imo, with mentioning a lot of the bigger names outright either in lore backstories from the author or directly in the story from the beginning, then slowly teasing the people in and out of the story. The scale of the power levels is really exciting to watch, with these big names often being asleep or otherwise uninterested in the comings and goings of the world but often having to get involved with the story in some way, so its cool to see certain powers or techniques way ahead of time and then figuring out through training arcs how the stuff actually happens. Honestly the best way to describe the series is just epic\n\nplease read this series so i have someone else to talk to about it thank you\n\nI really cannot stress how good this series is. I read a lot of manga and webtoons and manwha and if you're looking for a shonen to get into that's not just dudes yelling at each other then you should get into reading it. I also have a discord i can link people if theyre interested in talking about the story or speculation and stuff.\n\nHi, so someone just introduced me to a taste representation format and it seemed interesting enough for me to give it a shot.\n\nSo basically the gist of it is you choose your favorite show that starts with each letter in your name. This can be your real name (full or otherwise) your internet name, a nickname, a pet name etc., and the rules for what qualifies for each character are as follows:\n\nOnly one show may be chosen for each letter of your name.\n\nE.G. if your name is John you can only pick one 'H' title\n\nHowever, if your name is Hannah you can pick up to two 'H' titles\n\nThe letter can be taken from either the original name or an official localised name of a show\n\nE.G. Madoka qualifies for the following:\n\nMahou Shoujo Madoka Magica (Japanese)\n\nPuella Magi Madoka Magica (English)\n\nEvangelion qualifies for the following:\n\nShin Seiki Evangelion (Japanese)\n\nNeon Genesis Evangelion (English)\n\nE.G. Gunbuster qualifies for the following:\n\nTop wo Narae! Gunbuster (Japanese)\n\nGunbuster (English)\n\nIf the title starts with a number, both written and numeral forms of the title qualify\n\nE.G. 3-gatsu no Lion qualifies for all of the following:\n\n3-gatsu no Lion\n\nSan-gatsu no Lion\n\nMarch Comes in like a Lion\n\nHowever, the number MUST be read in the language of the title UNLESS it is implied that it is supposed to read in a different language (e.g. English language Japanese title on a show set in the west), in which case it is reversed\n\nThree-gatsu no Lion would not qualify\n\nNinety-One Days would qualify\n\nKyuu-Juu-Ichi Days would not qualify\n\nIf a kanji character at the beginning of the title can be interpreted in multiple contextually valid ways, both interpretations are valid\n\nE.G. A Place Further than the Universe qualifies for all of the following:\n\nSora Yori mo Tooi Basho\n\nUchuu Yori mo Tooi Basho\n\nA Place Further than the Universe\n\nShortened \"fan titles\" do not qualify.\n\nE.G. A Place Further Than the Universe does not qualify for the following:\n\nYoriMoi\n\nE.G. Neon Genesis Evangelion does not qualify for the following:\n\nEvangelion\n\nR and L are largely interchangeable provided it's not obviously intended to be one or the other\n\nThis is kinda a given, but you don't omit stuff like \"A\", \"The\" etc.\n\nIf you haven't seen any shows that match a letter, you can treat it as a \"semi-free\" space; only shows that are eligible under other letters are allowed, and you must indicate clearly that it is treated as a \"semi-free\" space\n\nIf you have seen one or more shows for the letter, you must list one of them regardless of how much you like/dislike it\n\nMaking this list was honestly incredibly difficult; while it wasn't very hard to come up with a shortlist for most letters (with one obvious exception), actually narrowing it down presented me with some pretty difficult decisions.\n\nKey:\n\n\"Semi-free\" space\n\nCompromise choice (explained below)\n\nMajo no Takyuubin (Kiki's Delivery Service)\n\nAno Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai (AnoHana)\n\nRurouni Kenshin: Tsuioku-hen (Rurouni Kenshin: Trust and Betrayal)\n\nThe Tatami Galaxy\n\nInazuma Eleven\n\nNoein: Mou Hitori no Kimi e (Noein: to your other self)\n\nERASED\n\nV -- Re: Cutie Honey\n\nAmanchu Advance\n\nNHK ni Youkoso\n\nShe and Her Cat ~Everything Flows~\n\nThe slots that were the hardest to decide on were probably R, the two As and S; R was kinda saved by the free space, but A leaves YoriMoi without representation which was a really difficult thing to do. I also had to do a do a lot of compromising to make S viable for this, and I've explained my thought process below.\n\nAll of the particularly difficult clashes outside of S were:\n\nM: Kiki's Delivery Service and Madoka Magica\n\nA1+2: AnoHana, Amanchu Advance, and YoriMoi\n\nR: Trust and Betrayal, Re Cutie Honey and ReLIFE\n\nN2: NHK and New Cutie Honey\n\nV (semi-free): YoriMoi, Re Cutie Honey\n\nS presented a unique challenge for me in that the shortlist contained seven shows that are either on my 3x3 already or which have been on my 3x3 in the past twelve months. These shows are as follows:\n\nShinsekai Yori (From the New World)\n\nShe and Her Cat ~Everything Flows~\n\nSamurai X: Trust and Betrayal\n\nSerial Experiments Lain\n\nShouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu\n\nSora Yori mo Tooi Basho (Uchuu Yori mo Tooi Basho, A Place Further than the Universe)\n\nScrapped Princess\n\nAs such, trying to choose a single show out of these to get representation was difficult, as there were multiple different criteria that I had to choose between when selecting one:\n\nPure favoritism (mood dependent, but probably Shinsekai Yori in the highest % of moods)\n\nThe show I think is technically the best (a three way toss-up between 'Samurai X: Trust and Betrayal', 'Serial Experiments Lain' and 'She and Her Cat: Everything Flows')\n\nThe show that I think best represents the a broad picture of my taste (there are convincing arguments for all of 'She and Her Cat ~Everything Flows~', 'Scrapped Princess', 'Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu' and 'Serial Experiments Lain')\n\nThe shows that extracted the most noteworthy emotional reactions ('Sora Yori mo Tooi Basho', 'She and Her Cat ~Everything Flows~' and 'Shouwa Genroku Rakugo Shinjuu'\n\nThe level of respect I hold the show to (A tossup between She and Her Cat, Trust and Betrayal, Shouwa Genroku and Lain )\n\nChoosing any one of these is honestly a fools errand; no matter how much I looked at the list, I couldn't decide on any one criterion to use. As such, I did it as a sorta qualitative amalgamation of criteria 3 and 4 that took 1, 2 and 5 loosely into consideration. I also looked at how the list interacted with other letters to try and cut it down, removing Trust and Betrayal from the equation.\n\nEven after all of this it was still a toss-up between Lain and She and Her Cat, but I ultimately settled on She and Her Cat because it resonated with me more on a personal level.\n\nBrackets = The show appears on multiple distinct letters\n\nM - Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica / Majo no Takyuubin / Mob Psycho 100 / Mouretsu Pirates\n\nA - Amanchu Advance / (A Place Further than the Universe) / Assassination Classroom / Ano Hi Mita Hana no Namae wo Bokutachi wa Mada Shiranai / Ajin / (A Lull in the Sea)\n\nR - (Rurouni Kenshin) / (Rurouni Kenshin: Trust and Betrayal) / ReLIFE / Re: Cutie Honey / Rakudai Kishi no Cavalry\n\nT - Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagaan / Toradora / Tsuki ga Kirei / Top wo Narae!

It also showed me some interesting pointless statistics: the disparities in the number of shows I've seen on different letters in the alphabet, namely:\n\n2/3 of the 'I' shows I've completed are different series of Inazuma Eleven, and all the other ones suck ass to the point that there are only really two Inazuma Eleven series in contention for the slot\n\nThe only two 'E' shows I've completed are ERASED and Eromanga Sensei\n\n(Obviously) I've not seen any V shows\n\nI've seen an obscene number of shows that start with the letter S.\n\nI might try and doing these for a few other combinations of letters in the future (gamer boy, A-Z+a number, and maybe even one for my full name that's restricted to Japanese phonetics if I can be arsed) but I've already spent a few hours too long on this so I'll leave it there; those will be totally separate challenges and I don't even know if I'll be able to come close to completing them.\n\nThis is very difficult. I give up.\n\nNot too sure who still reads things like Tower of God but if you haven't started yet or had apprehensions I would without a doubt start reading it here (support the developer please!) Tower of God just finished its hiatus and break for seasons 2 and 3, with season 3 started this Monday. It is hands down my favorite series ever, I rank it above things like Gurren Lagann, Hunter x Hunter, even things I've read like One Piece or Berserk in terms of Shonen capabilites. It takes some inspiration from things like Hunter x Hunter with how fights are often set up with unique ways to beat things, strategy wise, and a lot of the fights aren't just who has the biggest blast.\n\nI find the artwork to be absolutely amazing if you're into that although admittedly it is not amazing in the first season (roughly the first 70 chapters) but picks up to be absolutely mindboggling detailed in later chapters. The character designs are usually unique enough that everyone finds some favorites, with my personal favorite being the Slayer, White. Other ones I really like are Koon Aguero Agnis and Hwa Ryun. Below are some screencaps of my favorite depictions of these characters (of White, the greatest character of them all).\n\nThe thing I love most about Tower of God is the foreshadowing and worldbuilding behind it. If you know me you know that my favorite games are things like Dark Souls, Hollow Knight, etc, and in part you also know that I like those games with the amount of lore hidden in the background for people to discover. Tower of God is the same way, although much more intentional and laid out for the average reader. To start with the series focuses on Baam, an otherwise ordinary dude who enters a \"tower\" to compete, albeit unwillingly. The tower is a place where there are 134 floors (possibly more though the highest anyone has gotten is 134) with each floor requiring a test of some kind to progress, usually where you compete against other test candidates, often to the death. It's a grueling place where teammates are often disposable, outright power isn't the only thing that will allow you to win the fight, and with clearly defined \"winners and losers.' By that I mean that from the start the author foreshadows these giants in the world to exist and influence world events, and the vast majority of people you meet are just no name \"fishes.\" You can read Hunter x Hunter, for example, and learn about Ging from episode 1, but he's never actually shown until like 140 episodes in, or Naruto and the \"big names\" like Hashirama or Madara aren't even mentioned or shown until way later. Tower of God does this idea so much better imo, with mentioning a lot of the bigger names outright either in lore backstories from the author or directly in the story from the beginning, then slowly teasing the people in and out of the story. The scale of the power levels is really exciting to watch, with these big names often being asleep or otherwise uninterested in the comings and goings of the world but often having to get involved with the story in some way, so its cool to see certain powers or techniques way ahead of time and then figuring out through training arcs how the stuff actually happens. Honestly the best way to describe the series is just epic\n\nplease read this series so i have someone else to talk to about it thank you\n\nI really cannot stress how good this series is. I read a lot of manga and webtoons and manwha and if you're looking for a shonen to get into that's not just dudes yelling at each other then you should get into reading it. I also have a discord i can link people if theyre interested in talking about the story or speculation and stuff.\n\nYou're not alone. I promise. However, I will have to admit I stopped reading it around the time one of the first hiatuses hit and this mostly due to the series being removed from my favorite manga app on my tablet (which is where I almost exclusively consume manga/manhwa). I plan to get into it again once I get a better grasp of Hangeul. I'm currently studying Hangeul while teaching English here in Korea and so I want to read ToG from the OG language :)\n\nBut yeah ToG is GOAT, though I sometimes feel like it's rather easy to lose track of who's who and why they're important because of the literal multitude of characters the writer/artist juggles."
