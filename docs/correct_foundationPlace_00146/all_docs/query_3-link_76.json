CISA will update this Alert with more information as it becomes available.\n\nCISA publishes a supplementary ‘how-to’ guide to assist stakeholders in executing the planning approach laid out in our Infrastructure Resilience Planning Framework (IRPF).\n\nIn response to recent well-publicized threat actor campaigns that exploited OS command injection defects in network edge devices, we published this alert urging software manufacturers to employ Secure by Design practices.\n\nAPT40 has repeatedly targeted Australian networks as well as government and private sector networks in the region, and the threat they pose to our networks is ongoing.\n\nCISA published a blog on the agency’s work across the federal government to secure Open Source Software (OSS) since it held its first Summit on OSS Security\n\nCISA’s Federal Cyber Defense Skilling Academy provides full-time federal employees an opportunity to focus on professional growth through an intense, full-time, three-month accelerated training program.\n\nCISA hosts and participates in events throughout the year to engage stakeholders, seek research partners, and communicate with the public to help protect the homeland.\n\nA single resource that provides you with access to information on services across CISA’s mission areas."
