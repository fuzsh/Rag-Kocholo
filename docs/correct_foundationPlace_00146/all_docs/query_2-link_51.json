        "text": "Founded in 1911 as a Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company, International Business Machines (IBM) needs to keep its finger on the pulse of the development of information technology not to be ousted by younger tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon.\n\nWith the advent of the internet, IBM needed to widen the spectrum of its products and services to retain its strong position in the tech field. Although the company lost its dominance, having only a 5% market share in 2021, as opposed to 68% shared by Microsoft, Amazon, and Google, it has many spectacular achievements to its credit.\n\nIBM holds more patents than any other technology company and takes pride in employees who have earned five Nobel Prizes, four Turing Awards, five National Medals of Technology, and five National Medals of Science. And it had been the top tech company for longer than any of the titans dominating the market now.\n\nAlso called ‚ÄúBig Blue,‚Äù IBM indeed has an impressive pedigree. After starting to produce hardware at the beginning of the last century, it thrived in this business for decades and became the leading supplier of mainframe computers worldwide.\n\nIBM‚Äôs gross income had inexorably grown in the last part of the twentieth century, expanding from $14.450 billion earned in 1975 to $71.940 billion made in 1995. The company‚Äôs revenue skyrocketed to the record level of $106.9 billion in 2011, after which it has steadily been declining amidst its transition into new technologies and lines of business.\n\nTo move with the times and survive the competition from other tech titans, IBM gradually shifted its focus from hardware to software and services. It began to devote more energy and money to cloud-based services and cognitive computing. IBM focuses now on offering primarily network services, application services, cloud services, digital workplace services, business processes and operations, technology consulting services, and AI services.\n\nIBM Watson, a cognitive system capable of answering questions posed in natural language, has become the company‚Äôs high-visibility offering in the technology field. IBM has a strong faith in Watson, promoting the system as a benevolent digital assistant that would help hospitals, offices, factories, and farms. The company‚Äôs white paper referred to Watson as ‚Äúthe future of knowing.‚Äù\n\nTo see how well IBM has prepared for, what it calls, the new age of understanding, study the statistical data presented below.\n\nSources: IBM, Wikipedia\n\nIBM Earnings üí∞üíπ\n\nInterested to see how IBM is currently performing? Check out the latest IBM earnings data.\n\nIBM‚Äôs Outstanding Achievements\n\nCopied Copy To Clipboard\n\nIn 1891, IBM, then called CTR, invented the computing scale that could show both the weight and the proportionate price of the product simultaneously.\n\nIn 1888, the company invented the Time Clock, a device that records start and end times for hourly employees. Then, it designed the punch card base data processing machines. IBM is also responsible for inventing the magnetic stripe technology and the Universal Product Code.\n\nIBM designed and developed the first smartphone in the world, launching it in November 1992. Designed by IBM and manufactured by Mitsubishi Electric, the device had a touchscreen, a calculator app, email capability, 2 MB RAM, and 2 MB internal storage. There were about 50,000 of these smartphones sold for $899 a unit.\n\nIBM also revolutionized the computer industry, inventing DRAM, floppy disk, SQL programming language, ATMs, and hard disk drives.\n\nIBM also invented the first personal computer, known as the IBM PC. It was launched in August 1981 and acquired by many companies before PCs were commercialized.\n\nSince 1920, IBM has received 151,302 US patents. In 2019, the company received a staggering amount of 9,262 US patents. A year later, IBM beat the record of most US patents received by a business for 27 consecutive years. In 2021, IBM had 1,811 patents granted, while this year it has so far received 492 patents.\n\nIBM has long worked with NASA. Although IBM contributed to many missions, the most memorable is landing on the Moon in 1969. IBM‚Äôs responsibility was to develop the software and various programs, build computers, and streamline the mission for NASA.\n\nOne of the fascinating inventions of IBM is the Scanning Tunnelling Microscope developed in 1981 for imaging at the atomic level. Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer received the Noble Prize in Physics in 1986 for the invention.\n\nIBM developed several chess computers, the most popular of which is Deep Blue. In 1996, Deep Blue beat the chess world champion, Garry Kasparov, who accused IBM of cheating. IBM declined Kasparov‚Äôs offer of a rematch.\n\nIBM invented the ASME (The Anatomic and Symbolic Mapper Engine) that offers a 3D interactive avatar of the human body to doctors in real-time, helping them visualize patients‚Äô medical records.\n\nBig Blue made LASIK eye surgery mainstream.\n\nThe company invented the IBM 2990 Blood Cell Separator, designed to harvest white blood cells from blood donors to support patients with leukemia. Later, IBM engineers improved the device, introducing its more sophisticated version, IBM 2997.\n\nIBM offers the IBM LinuxONE for cloud computing solutions. This powerful computer system can manage the work of 1000√ó86 servers simultaneously on a single platform.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIBM Statistics in 2022\n\nCopied Copy To Clipboard\n\nOver 90% of credit card transactions are processed by IBM mainframes.\n\nAbout 80% of global retailers use IBM retail solutions in their stores and for online sales.\n\nOver 80% of travel reservations are processed through an IBM product.\n\nNearly 97% of banks worldwide use IBM products.\n\nThere are 245,000 IBM employees worldwide in 2022.\n\nIBM employees live in 170 countries.\n\nThere are 130,000 IBM employees in India.\n\n3,000 researchers are working in IBM‚Äôs fifteen laboratories around the world.\n\nDuring the pandemic, between 2020 and 2021, IBM reduced the number of its employees by around 0.24%.\n\nOver 29% of IBM managers are women.\n\nThere are an average of 108 applications per available job position at the company.\n\nEvery day, IBM handles 70 billion security events.\n\nEvery second, it manages 8.18 million security events.\n\nOver 27.3 million people use the IBM website every month.\n\nThe IBM website has a bounce rate of 52.66%.\n\nIn 2020, IBM‚Äôs earnings hit about $73 billion.\n\nIn 2021, its global revenue diminished by 22%.\n\nAlmost half of IBM‚Äôs revenue is generated in the North American market.\n\nIBM bought Red Hat for $33.4 billion.\n\nCognos was purchased by IBM for $4.9 billion in 2008.\n\nBig Blue acquired SoftLayer Technologies in 2013 reportedly for $2 billion.\n\nTo date, IBM has acquired more than 183 companies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFacts about IBM‚Äôs Incumbent CEO, Arvind Krishna\n\nCopied Copy To Clipboard\n\nArvind Krishna became IBM‚Äôs CEO in 2020, arriving with the mission to reverse the company‚Äôs decline. He is expected to create a new line of business that would rediscover IBM‚Äôs former glory.\n\nBefore becoming the company‚Äôs CEO, Krishna worked as the Senior Vice President for IBM‚Äôs cloud and cognitive software. He developed IBM‚Äôs security software business.\n\nKrishna was the general manager of IBM Systems and Technology Group‚Äôs development and manufacturing organization. He also managed IBM‚Äôs acquisition of Red Hat and supervised its synergy with IBM.\n\nKrishna is the co-author of 15 patents and has been the editor of IEEE and ACM journals. He has received distinguished alumni awards from IITK and the University of Illinois, where he completed his PhD. His scholarly articles appear in numerous journals.\n\nKrishna leads the IBM business unit that provides the cloud and data platform.

He also owns over 21,803 units of International Business Machines stock worth over $23,629,581.\n\nSource: Fortune\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIBM‚Äôs Annual Revenue from 2000 to 2022\n\nCopied Copy To Clipboard\n\nOnce an unparalleled tech giant, IBM has been struggling for the last decade. It had to adjust to the changing world by selling its low-margin businesses and investing in high-margin ones. To implement its strategies, Big Blue sold IBM WebSphere Commerce to HCL Technologies in 2018 and a part of the Watson Health business at the beginning of this year. Although IBM‚Äôs earnings are still high, they do not reach the levels hit between 2006 and 2012. The company‚Äôs annual revenue skyrocketed to $106.9 billion in 2011, whereas it was only $57 billion last year. In the third quarter of 2022, IBM reported earnings of $14.11 billion, which exceeded analysts‚Äô prognosis of $13.51 billion. In the second quarter of 2022, IBM‚Äôs earnings dropped below expectations. IBM‚Äôs falling fortune is reflected in the table below:\n\nIBM‚Äôs Annual Revenue since 2000 (in $US Billion)\n\nSource: Statista; IBM\n\nWant to buy IBM stock? üë©‚Äçüíªüìà\n\nInvest in IBM shares quickly and without hidden charges by checking out our list of top-rated brokers and best trading platforms.

While this year proved to be the worst for the Nasdaq since 2008, IBM outshined other tech giants. Having soared 11%, IBM became one of only two US companies valued at $50 billion or more to make gains in 2022. It exceeded analysts‚Äô estimates in every sector, boosted by higher-than-expected growth in its software and infrastructure divisions. Contrary to analysts‚Äô prediction of a decline in IBM‚Äôs revenue, the company posted surprisingly high numbers in the fourth quarter and proved them wrong. The fourth quarter brought the company $16.7 billion in revenue versus $16.4 billion expected by analysts.\n\nNearly all segments gained in Q4. IBM‚Äôs software division boasted $7.29 billion, which amounts to 3% growth, and thus beat analysts‚Äô estimates of $7.12 billion. Consulting brought IBM $4.77 billion in revenue, up 0.5% and slightly lower than the expected $4.8 billion. IBM picked up $4.48 billion in revenue in the fourth quarter in its infrastructure segment. This figure is higher than the $4.18 billion anticipated by analysts, registering a 2% growth. Revenue from IBM‚Äôs Z Systems line of mainframe computers surged a whopping 16% after the Z16 model became available in May 2022.\n\nIBM‚Äôs net income rose 16% to $2.71 billion, allowing it to sound a note of optimism about its future in 2023. Unlike other companies complaining about a slowdown in business, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said IBM did not follow the general downward trend noticeable in the tech sector. Krishna told the press that IBM‚Äôs clients want to do new development in 2023. To accommodate its clients, IBM plans to lengthen the useful life of servers and networking equipment in 2023. This move is believed to be also financially beneficial to the company. It might push IBM‚Äôs pre-tax income up by over $200 million.\n\nIBM also intends to invest $20 billion in New York‚Äôs Hudson Valley area to make it the center of the future of quantum computing. It will spend money on research, development, and manufacturing of semiconductors, mainframe technology, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing. IBM‚Äôs next-generation quantum computer ‚Äì Osprey ‚Äì will feature 433 qubits. It will have the largest qubit count of any of IBM‚Äôs quantum computers and triple the qubits of the IBM Eagle processor unveiled in 2021.\n\nDespite these grandiose plans for 2023 and success in 2022, IBM is cautious about its guidance concerning 2023 revenue growth. It expects it to be on the low end of its model for mid-single-digit revenue growth and around $10.5 billion in free cash flow. In 2022, its free cash flow amounted to $9.29 billion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIBM‚Äôs Annual Revenue by Segment for 2020-2021\n\nCopied Copy To Clipboard\n\nBig Blue has repeatedly changed the segment reporting to reflect its move away from being hardware, software, and service company towards becoming a cognitive solutions and cloud platform company. It changed its segment reporting in 2016, 2019, and 2021. The last change was dictated by IBM‚Äôs need to align its segment reporting with its platform-centric approach to hybrid cloud and AI. There are presently six segments in IBM‚Äôs business: Technology Services and Cloud Platforms, Infrastructure, Software, Consulting, Financing, and Other. In 2021, IBM‚Äôs software segment generated $24.14 billion of its global revenue of $57.35 billion. In 2022 so far, the Software division earned $5.77 billion and $6.2 billion, in the first and second quarters, respectively. The Consulting sector brought the company $4.83 billion in Q1 and $4.8 billion in Q2 of the current year. The revenue earned by the Infrastructure segment amounted to $3.22 billion in the first quarter and $4.0 billion in the second quarter. Revenues generated by IBM‚Äôs segments in the last two years are shown in the table below:\n\nIBM‚Äôs Annual Revenue by Segment for 2020-2021 (in $US billion)\n\nSource: Statista\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIBM Q4 2023 Earnings\n\nCopied Copy To Clipboard\n\nIBM reported its 2023 fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday, January 24, with EPS of $3.87, $0.10 better than the analyst estimate of $3.77. Revenue for the quarter came in at $17.38B versus the consensus estimate of $17.23B.\n\n‚ÄúDespite the uncertain macro environment, IBM delivered impressive earnings as well as solid guidance as it continues to make progress on its massive multiyear restructuring,‚Äù said Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com. ‚ÄúIBM is poised to continue to benefit from its turnaround efforts, while taking advantage of strong demand for its hybrid cloud offerings, which will help power future earnings growth and allow it to focus on increasing shareholder returns. The IT giant‚Äôs solid numbers and outlook set an encouraging tone for enterprise software and tech companies reporting next week.‚Äù\n\nJesse Cohen, Senior Analyst at Investing.com\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorldwide Market Share of Cloud Infrastructure Providers in Q2 2022\n\nCopied Copy To Clipboard\n\nIn the second quarter of 2022, IBM‚Äôs Cloud Infrastructure had only a 4% share of the worldwide market, lagging behind Amazon, Azure, and Google Cloud. The spending on global cloud infrastructure services soared to $55 billion and thus brought the industry‚Äôs total for the twelve months to more than $203.5 billion. Outshining IBM, Amazon and Microsoft together accounted for more than half of cloud infrastructure revenues in the three months that ended on June 30.\n\nThese figures show how much Big Blue fell from grace because, in the past, it used to enjoy the leading position. In 2017, IBM reported cloud revenue growth of 33% year-over-year in its first quarter earnings. In that quarter, its cloud revenue jumped to $3.5 billion. IBM‚Äôs total cloud revenue over the past 12 months that year hit $41.6 billion and catapulted IBM to the top of the list in the field of enterprise cloud. In the first quarter of 2017, today‚Äôs winners were obliged only to trail behind with lower earnings: Microsoft with $14 billion, Amazon with $12.20 billion, and Google with $10 billion. The latest market share of the main providers of cloud infrastructure can be seen in the table below:\n\nWorldwide Market Share of Cloud Infrastructure Providers in Q2 2022\n\nSources: Statista, IBM\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIBM‚Äôs Annual Net Income since 2009\n\nCopied Copy To Clipboard\n\nNet income is defined as a company‚Äôs net profit or loss after it has accounted for all its revenues, income items, and expenses. IBM‚Äôs net income for the quarter ending on June 30, 2022, was $1.292 billion, which constituted a 5.06% jump year-over-year. The company‚Äôs net profit for the 12 months ending on June 30, 2022, was $5.588 billion, demonstrating an increase of 4.76% year-over-year. Last year, IBM‚Äôs annual net income reached $5.743 billion, a 2.74% surge from 2020. The first year of the pandemic brought IBM a net income of $5.59 billion, which was a whopping 40.73% drop from 2019. In 2019, IBM‚Äôs annual net profit was $9.431 billion, an 8.05% advance from 2018. The uneven trajectory of IBM‚Äôs annual net income is drawn in the table below:\n\nIBM‚Äôs Annual Net Income since 2009 (in $US Billion)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIBM‚Äôs Number of Employees Worldwide from 2000 to 2022\n\nCopied Copy To Clipboard\n\nIBM is the fifth largest employer in the United States. In 2021, the company employed 282,000 people worldwide. This year, the number of people working for Big Blue dipped to 245,000. As the company has lately been struggling, experiencing drops in its revenues, it is trying to restructure its business and be on par with such tech giants as Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and Apple. Hence the decline in the number of its employees in 2022.\n\nIn January 2023, IBM announced that it expected to cut about 3,900 jobs, representing 1.5% of IBM‚Äôs workforce. These cuts are related solely to reorganizing the company‚Äôs business units. They are related to neither IBM‚Äôs performance in 2022 nor its plans for 2023. The units affected are Kyndryl, an IT infrastructure services business, and IBM‚Äôs healthcare analytics business, an investment firm in the acquisition process.\n\nThe table below shows how the number of IBM‚Äôs employees has changed over the years:\n\nIBM‚Äôs Number of Employees Worldwide from 2000 to 2022 (in 1,000s)\n\nSource: Statista\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConclusion\n\nCopied Copy To Clipboard\n\nAs the world is facing a probable recession, analysts believe that the enterprise tech sector will still continue going strong. People who are tech-savvy will turn to IBM in these unpleasant times to help them survive in a tighter economic environment and use the company‚Äôs software, consulting, and infrastructure to work productively during an economic decline. Big Blue can definitely provide the products and services people will need in the near future. IBM‚Äôs Q2 2022 results signify that technology spending in such spheres as AI, cloud, automation and networking is steady. The company beat anticipated results in the second quarter and boasted its first double-digit quarterly revenue growth in more than a decade. Automatic calculations conducted at Coinpriceforecast.com inspire faith in the company‚Äôs future and the cost of its stock. At the beginning of the year, IBM‚Äôs stock price was $116.92. At the time of writing, IBM is trading at $118.81, thus demonstrating a 2% jump from January 2022. Coinpriceforecast.com foresees that by Christmas, IBM will surge to $138. In the first half of 2023, the price of the stock might advance to $145 and end the next year at $155, adding 30% to today‚Äôs price. Whether or not these predictions prove to be correct, IBM will surely continue pushing technology and innovation forward, as it has spectacularly done since the beginning of the twentieth century.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInvestingPro: Unlock Additional IBM Data\n\nCopied Copy To Clipboard\n\nUnlock Premium Data With InvestingPro+ üìàüí∏\n\nCompare the performance of IBM against industry leaders, access vital financial stats and make smarter investment moves.\n\nSay goodbye to inefficiency ‚Äì choose InvestingPro for swift IBM insights and more profitable decisions within minutes of signing up.\n\nAdvertisement"
