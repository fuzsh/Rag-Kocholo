If you're new to IT, take a look at these beginner IT certifications and certificates.\n\nCost: Getting certified typically costs several hundred dollars (or more), plus the additional fees to maintain it. The right certification can open up better job prospects or higher salaries, but itâs important to invest wisely.\n\nArea of focus: If youâre just getting started in cybersecurity or want to move into a managerial role, a more general certification might be a good choice. As you advance in your career, you might decide to specialize. A certification in your concentration area can validate your skills to potential employers.\n\nPotential employers: Check some job listings of employers you may want to work for (or job titles you plan to apply for) to see what certifications are commonly required.\n\nHow to get into cybersecurity: First steps\n\nMany of the most coveted certifications require (or at least recommend) some previous experience in cybersecurity or IT. If your career goals include a job in this in-demand industry, there are some steps you can take now to start gaining the experience you need.\n\nGet a degree in computer science.\n\nWhile you donât need a degree to enjoy a successful career in cybersecurityâeight percent of surveyed professionals only reported a high school diplomaâit can help you build a strong foundation [2]. Many of the most prestigious certifications will waive some of the work experience requirements if youâve earned a bachelorâs or masterâs degree in computer science or a related field.Â\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania offers an Ivy League Master of Computer and Information Technology degree designed especially for students without a computer science background. Try a course before you apply to see if this program is a good fit.\n\nStart with an entry-level job in IT.Â\n\nHands-on experience is often the most effective way to prepare for certification exams. Start accumulating work experience with an entry-level role as a cybersecurity analyst. Many cybersecurity professionals start off in more general IT roles.Â\n\nLearn more: How to Get a Job in IT: 7 Steps\n\nGet an entry-level IT certification.\n\nReady to develop both technical and workplace skills for a career in cybersecurity?
