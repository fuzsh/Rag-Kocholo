        "text": "Save up to 50% discount on VMware Cloud Foundation as a Service with a 1 or 3 year contract and get up to 200K USD in VMware workload migration credits. Contact your IBM Representative or read more about the offer.\n\n*Migration credits are only applicable to new VMware Cloud Foundation offerings (VMware solutions on IBM Cloud) clients only. This migration credit offer is valid now through September 30, 2024.\n\nMigration credits are available to IBM Cloud Paygo, Subscription, and Enterprise saving plan account types.\n\nOn-demand consumption for IBM Cloud for VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) as a Service, inclusive of built-in VCF licenses, with a single virtual machine including 1 vCPU, 1 GB RAM, 20 GB vSAN storage, and an Efficiency Network Edge server is priced at USD 123.32/month across all IBM Cloud Single and Multizone Regions, excluding Dallas, TX IBM Cloud Data Centers, which costs USD 127.00/month.\n\nEach of the IBM Cloud for VMware Solutions is available with an array of deployment options, as well as self-managed or managed options. Infrastructure, software, and support for these bundles are all included in the monthly subscription price. No contracts are necessary, and you can scale up or down at any time. In the self-managed option, you can rent VMware licenses on a monthly subscription basis. Licenses rented from IBM Cloud are offered on a monthly subscription and metered per physical CPU for extremely advantageous pricing.\n\nIn the managed option, VMware licenses are baked into the price of the solution. The solution runs on multi-tenant infrastructure and can be consumed in a highly scalable hourly model.\n\nIC4V Shared is offered in two consumption models: On-Demand and Reserved. With “On-Demand,” compute resources are made available to users on an as-needed basis and billed hourly. This model is a best fit for VMs that are consumed for a short period of time or for fluctuating-capacity needs such as cloud bursting and running non-critical DR workloads.\n\nWith \"Reserved,\" clients can reserve their compute capacity needs with an up-front reservation in a monthly billing model, guaranteeing the availability of resources. Other than compute, all resources such as storage and egress are charged as per actual usage for both \"On-Demand\" and \"Reserved\" consumption models."
