        "text": "In the broadest sense, a zero trust security posture works by continuously verifying and authenticating connections between users, applications, devices and data.\n\nImplementing a zero trust strategy across an organization can be a complex undertaking. It isn’t a matter of installing a single zero trust solution. Zero trust requires planning and executing across a broad range of functional areas, including identity and access policies, security solutions and workflows, automation, operations and network infrastructure.\n\nMany organizations follow specific zero trust frameworks to build zero trust architectures. Established models include Forrester’s Zero Trust framework, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-2073 and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Zero Trust Maturity Model (ZTMM).4\n\nWhile organizations can choose from various frameworks, most zero trust strategies share these key concepts: the three principles of zero trust, the five pillars of zero trust and zero trust network access (ZTNA).\n\nOne of the primary technologies for implementing a zero trust strategy is zero trust network access or ZTNA. Like a virtual private network (VPN), ZTNA provides remote access to applications and services. Unlike a VPN, a ZTNA connects users only to the resources they have permission to access rather than connecting them to the whole network.\n\nZTNA is a key part of the secure access service edge (SASE) model, which enables companies to provide direct, secure, low-latency connections between users and resources."
