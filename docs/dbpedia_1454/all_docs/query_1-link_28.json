The splashy party that was the 2008 Olympics is yesterday’s news, but one-party rule in China remains. New China is still, in significant ways, Old China. The obvious question is: What comes next? To help answer it, Asia Society asks a different, equally timely post-Olympics question: What came before? This exhibition of paintings, drawings, posters and Maoist souvenirs produced in the years leading up to and during the Cultural Revolution gives complicated answers. It lays out the conflicted loyalties that have shaped contemporary China, and finds them in the work of artists who anticipated the current art boom and are part of it. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org.\n\n(Holland Cotter)\n\n* ASIA SOCIETY AND MUSEUM: ‘TRACES OF THE CALLIGRAPHER: ISLAMIC CALLIGRAPHY IN PRACTICE, CIRCA 1600-1900’ AND ‘WRITING THE WORD OF GOD: CALLIGRAPHY AND THE QUR’AN,’ through Feb. 8. These side-by-side exhibitions, perfect in size and carefully thought out, approach Islamic calligraphy from two perspectives. The first show is basically a manual in techniques of fine penmanship and luxury book-making, illustrated by superb examples of tools of the trade and finished products. The second is an array of hand-written Koran pages for total-immersion contemplation. Gorgeous.(See above.)\n\n(Cotter)\n\n★BRONX MUSEUM OF THE ARTS: ‘STREET ART STREET LIFE: FROM THE 1950S TO NOW,’ through Jan. 25. If to you “street life” means noise-lights-action, you’ll find this show a surprise. With its immaculate, stripped-down installation, the exhibition is clearly devoted not to recreating the feel of art on the street, but to recording it, from Robert Frank’s unvarnished photographic views of post-World War II America to digital montages by Fatimah Tuggar uniting today’s streets of New York and Lagos, Nigeria. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org.\n\n(Cotter)\n\nBROOKLYN MUSEUM: ‘GILBERT & GEORGE,’ through Jan. 11. Dynamic duo, gruesome twosome or just plain geeks in ties and tweeds, the British artists Gilbert & George don’t seem to care what you call them as long as you pay attention, which you couldn’t avoid doing if you tried in their suffocating and disordered wraparound survey at the Brooklyn Museum. In no particular sequence, we see the shadowy early black-and-white photographic pieces they did while living in a falling-down section of London in the 1970s, and the huge Pop colored murals filled with flowers and crowds of dishy young men, which decrease in number during the most devastating years of the AIDS epidemic. The newest work in the show, from 2005 and 2006, is crazy, end-of-time stuff. Terrorism and religious fundamentalism are the themes, and Gilbert and George themselves, partners in art as in life, are in the picture, mugging, moralizing, unembarrassed and all but unendurable, in art that’s right for right now. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)\n\n★ BROOKLYN MUSEUM: ‘JESPER JUST: ROMANTIC DELUSIONS,’ through Jan. 4. An enchanting show of four short films exhibits most of the qualities for which Mr. Just has become known since completing his studies at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 2003. Melodramatic but never campy or over the top and made with Hollywood-quality production values, his brief musicals explore vulnerable, ordinarily well-armored zones of the masculine psyche, like grief, same-sex love, Oedipal conflict and spiritual desire. The singing is wonderful. (See above.)\n\n(Ken Johnson)\n\nCOOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: ‘HOUSE PROUD: 19-CENTURY WATERCOLOR INTERIORS FROM THE THAW COLLECTION,’ through Jan. 25. The 70 or so jewel-like renderings of rooms and their furnishings here are delightful, mordantly signifying artifacts. They track the domestic effects of exoticism and nostalgia (chinoiserie, Gothic Revival); uncover glimmers of modernity (Biedermeier, smaller rooms); and witness the birth of the contemporary genre known as shelter porn. Accompanied by relevant examples of furniture, decorative objects and books, they also reveal that rooms seen whole, with light and space as well as décor carefully depicted, are among painting’s most appealing subjects. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Roberta Smith)\n\n★ GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: ‘CATHERINE OPIE: AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHER,’ through Jan. 7. Catherine Opie is many artists in one. Best known in the 1990s for her striking portraits of gay, lesbian and transgendered men and women drawn from a circle of friends and intimates, she is also a photographer of landscapes, cityscapes, architecture, still lifes and lifestyles. She is an insider and an outsider: a documentarian and a provocateur, a classicist and a maverick; a trekker and a stay-at-home; a lesbian feminist mother who resists the gay mainstream. It’s all here in a fine retrospective. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org.\n\n(Cotter)\n\nINTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: ‘AMERICA AND THE TINTYPE,’ through Jan. 4. This show about the tintype, an early form of photograph made by exposing a lacquered iron plate to light, includes some 200 examples from the museum’s collection. Most of the artists, and subjects, are unidentified. These works form a group portrait of Americans, mostly working- and middle-class, struggling to adapt to the rapidly shifting social and economic conditions during the four decades after the Civil War. The exhibition makes the most of the tintype’s range of subject matter and emotion, from postmortem shots to vaudevillian caricatures, freedmen to minstrels. It does not dispute the daguerreotype’s superior potentials for artistry but simply asserts that tintypes have been unfairly overlooked because of their ubiquity, affordability and anonymity. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Karen Rosenberg)\n\nINTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: ‘SUSAN MEISELAS: IN HISTORY,’ through Jan. 4. A certain moral quandary runs throughout this fascinatingly problematic exhibition: how do you reconcile the demands of professionalism and those of human compassion? To her credit, Ms. Meiselas  whose coverage of the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua in 1978-79 made her one of the world’s most celebrated and criticized war correspondents  does not duck the question. Tension between opportunism and conscience emerges as the show’s main interest  to the point that it trumps its ostensible subjects, which include strippers in traveling carnivals and forensic investigations of Saddam Hussein’s campaign against the Kurds in northern Iraq. (See above.)\n\n(Johnson)\n\nTHE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: ‘THE ESSENTIAL ART OF AFRICAN TEXTILES,’ through March 22. This show presents 19th-century African textiles, many lent by the British Museum, alongside relevant contemporary artworks from the Met’s collection. One of the most spectacular pairings matches El Anatsui’s “Between Earth and Heaven,” a recent acquisition, with a kente prestige cloth from Ghana. The Met’s 2005 exhibition “Matisse: The Fabric of Dreams” hinted that textiles had been undervalued in the Western canon; while the current show may not have the same blockbuster appeal, it goes deeper into the techniques and traditions that make the fabrics so striking and seductive. A related show, “The Poetics of Cloth: African Textiles/Recent Art,” is at the Grey Art Gallery at New York University. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)\n\nTHE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: ‘EARLY BUDDHIST MANUSCRIPT PAINTING: THE PALM-LEAF TRADITION,’ through March 22. Practical features like resilience and portability help explain why books written on dried palm leaves were popular with Buddhists in eastern India between the 10th and 13th centuries. But another factor, surely, was the quality of the illustrations that accompanied the texts: exquisite figures of divinities or scenes from the Buddha’s life. And few of these are as finely done and pristinely preserved as the examples in this small selection. (See above.) (Holland Cotter)\n\n★ THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: ‘GIORGIO MORANDI, 1890-1964,’ through Dec. 14. Aspirants to the role of painter as poet are many. Giorgio Morandi (1890-1964) was the real thing. And this Morandi retrospective at the Metropolitan Museum of Art is something that anyone who loves painting and its very specific poetry will want to see. Morandi’s still lifes are beautiful, but with a distinctive kind of beauty. And despite their small size and plain components  bottles, jars, boxes, pots, seashells, vases  they are emotionally audacious. This isn’t because of what they say outright, but because of what they don’t say; because they are so evidently shaped by self-restraint, and the passions that produced it. (See above.) (Holland Cotter)\n\nTHE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: ‘JEFF KOONS ON THE ROOF,’ through Oct. 26. Panoramic views of Central Park and the Manhattan skyline from the Cantor Roof Garden are distracting, but the three sculptures now on display there are well worth visiting. Each is a greatly enlarged, glossily lacquered, stainless-steel representation of something small: a toy dog made of twisted-together balloons; a Valentine heart wrapped in red foil; and the silhouette of Piglet from a Winnie the Pooh coloring book randomly colored, as if by a young child. (See above.) (Johnson)\n\n★ THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: ‘LANDSCAPES CLEAR AND RADIANT: THE ART OF WANG HUI (1632-1717),’ through Jan. 4. The Met’s first solo show devoted to a Chinese master is gorgeous and revelatory; its focus is the landscape virtuoso Wang Hui, star of the 17th-century Chinese art scene. Wang could do anything and did, synthesizing and transforming disparate strands of almost a millennium of Chinese painting, but also making exact copies of earlier masterpieces. Distinguished by a Mozart-like ease and perfection, his work unsettles Western notions of copy, original and originality. It is aided in this by displays of works by 16 earlier artists dating to the 10th-century  his mentors, his mentors’ mentors and the artists they all revered  which form a dazzling introduction to Chinese painting in general.(See above.) (Smith)\n\nTHE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: ‘RHYTHMS OF MODERN LIFE: BRITISH PRINTS 1914-1939,’ through Dec. 7. This interesting but confusingly organized exhibition considers the impact of modernity and machine-age idealism on 13 progressive British printmakers. Much of the show is given over to a group of artists active in the 1920s and ’30s  including Claude Flight, Cyril E. Power and Sybil Andrews  who created colorful linocuts in a lively synthesis of Cubism, Futurism and Art Deco. (See above.) (Johnson)\n\nMUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: ‘SECOND LIVES: REMIXING THE ORDINARY,’ through Feb. 15. The inaugural show in the Museum of Arts and Design’s jewel-box-like building continues its haphazard segue from a concentration on craft to a hipper, more wide-ranging program. Unfortunately, the focus is a strategy that is epidemic in the larger art world: the massing of something small (plastic spoons, ladies pumps, spools of thread, dangling eyeglasses) into something large (a pyramid, a loveseat, a view of the “Mona Lisa,” a chandelier). It is Surrealism 101, descended from Meret Oppenheim’s beloved and far too influential fur-lined teacup. Basically, you see the thing. You see the things it is made of. Something in the way of a punch line follows. 2 Columbus Circle, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org.\n\n(Roberta Smith)\n\nMUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: ‘PARIS/NEW YORK: DESIGN FASHION CULTURE, 1925-1940,’ through Feb. 22. This compact yet kaleidoscopic exhibition celebrates the romance that flourished between New York and Paris in the 1920s and ‘30s, when French Art Deco was the style, American jazz was the music, and skyscrapers and sumptuous ocean liners were among the symbols of the age. Selected and installed to extract maximum wattage from every juxtaposition, object and image (including many surprisingly effective digital reproductions), it tracks the exchange of goods as much as of ideas, and the roles played by both department stores and museums, knock-offs and originals, businessmen (especially developers) and designers and artists. Most memorably, it clarifies a golden age of design and building, when New York became the world capital of Art Deco architecture. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Smith)\n\nMUSEUM OF MODERN ART: ‘KIRCHNER AND THE BERLIN STREET,’ through Nov. 10. Focusing on seven paintings produced between 1913 and 1915 by the German Expressionist Ernst Ludwig Kirchner (1880-1938), this exhibition delivers a terrific visual wallop at the start and then continues to reverberate. Vigorously realized in jagged brush strokes of lurid pinks, greens and yellows and shades of charcoal black, the paintings depict stylishly dressed female streetwalkers and furtive, darkly cloaked men on the nocturnal, vertiginously tilted streets of an infernal city on the brink of a world-destroying war. (212) 708-9400, moma.org.\n\n(Johnson)\n\nMUSEUM OF MODERN ART: ‘LOOKING AT MUSIC,’ through Jan. 5. This exhibition of about 40 works from the museum’s collection emphasizes the experimental nature of both art and music in the late 1960s and early ‘70s. The lines dividing art, music and film were blurry enough to allow Laurie Anderson, Bruce Nauman and Yoko Ono, among others, to shift from object making to performance and back again. The show, which includes audio recordings and small-press publications alongside more conventional mediums, is accompanied by an extensive film and video program. (See above.)\n\n(Rosenberg)\n\nMUSEUM OF MODERN ART: ‘NEW PHOTOGRAPHY 2008: JOSEPHINE MECKSEPER AND MIKHAEL SUBOTZKY,’ through Jan. 5. Josephine Meckseper, a German-born artist in her 40s who was trained at the California Institute of the Arts, makes sleek-looking installations that mix photography and film  often scenes of political protest  with consumer objects. The South African artist Mikhael Subotzky, who at 26 is the youngest photographer to have been invited to join the Magnum Group, explores his country’s prison system in vivid color and unflinching detail. If Ms. Meckseper finds glossy, consumerist fantasy infiltrating our political consciousness, Mr. Subotzky reminds us that some people don’t yet have the luxury of fretting about the commodification of dissent. (See above.)\n\n(Rosenberg) MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: ‘PIPE, GLASS, BOTTLE OF RUM: THE ART OF APPROPRIATION,’ through Nov. 10. More than 100 works, mostly from the museum’s drawing collection, represent many different ways of importing nontraditional images, materials, forms and techniques into the realm of art. The exhibition ranges from early Cubist collages by Picasso, Braques and Gris that have newsprint and faux-wood grain paper in them to the suave, agit-prop montages of Barbara Kruger printed on matchbooks and a shopping bag. Other artists include John Baldessari, Hannah Höch, Sigmar Polke, Sherrie Levine and Richard Prince. (See above.) (Johnson)\n\nMUSEUM OF MODERN ART: ‘VAN GOGH AND THE COLORS OF THE NIGHT,’ through Jan. 5. This small, anomalous exhibition is a Van Gogh antiblockbuster with a seemingly counterintuitive theme, given the importance of the brilliant light of southern France to his art. It explores Van Gogh’s special relationship with darkness, where his interests in perception, color and symbolism fuse with unexpected intensity. And seeing a manageable number of Van Goghs  including masterpieces like “The Potato Eaters,” “The Starry Night” and “Night Café”  in intimate galleries is thrilling. (See above.) ( Smith)\n\nMUSEUM OF MODERN ART: ‘WUNDERKAMMER: A CENTURY OF CURIOSITIES,’ through Nov. 10. This exhibition of mostly prints and illustrated books gives too much space to artists in the Modern’s pantheon or to predictable midmarket bench warmers. But it is inspired by a very un-Modern idea: the Renaissance wunderkammer, or cabinet of curiosities, a free-form collection of all things rare and marvelous, natural and man-made. Sensitively installed and rife with images of living, often grotesque creatures, it has the buzz of an aberrant ark and enough fresh material to sustain interest. The addition of a few objects from the museum’s design collection is especially smart and effective; ignoring MoMA’s departmental divisions is a good thing. (See above.) (Smith)\n\n★ NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: ‘GEORGE TOOKER: A RETROSPECTIVE,’ through Jan. 4. George Tooker has painted some of the 20th century’s most memorable images of angst. With its lost souls haunting the New York underground, “Subway” (1950) envisions modernity as a spiritual prison system. The Kafkaesque “Government Bureau” (1956) pictures an office of seemingly infinite dimensions, where people wait like penitents at the windows of terminally unresponsive bureaucrats. Both paintings are included in this richly affecting five-decade career retrospective. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Johnson)\n\nNEW MUSEUM: ‘LIVE FOREVER: ELIZABETH PEYTON,’ through Jan. 11. This lush midcareer survey pays tribute to an artist whose diminutive, irony-free, boldly colored portraits of friends, artists, rock stars and other historic figures, living and dead, have exerted considerable influence over the last 16 years. The reason is a complex, highly effective fusion of the painterly, the personal and the Conceptual, as well as a kind of reverse appropriation, wherein photographs and snapshots are given a new permanence, substance and most of all feeling by being re-engineered into unique art objects. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Smith)\n\nSCHOMBURG CENTER FOR RESEARCH IN BLACK CULTURE: ‘AARON DOUGLAS: AFRICAN-AMERICAN MODERNIST,’ through Nov. 30. In 1920s New York a great flowering of black culture emerged that came to be known as the Harlem Renaissance. No visual artist expressed that movement’s euphoric sense of possibility with greater verve than the subject of this valuable exhibition, the painter, illustrator and muralist Aaron Douglas. His major works feature semitransparent silhouettes of black people in heroic poses overlaid by concentric, circular bands of light. Rendered in muted, luminous colors, they project visionary romanticism in a suave, Art Deco-like style. 515 Malcolm X Boulevard, at 135th Street, Harlem, (212) 491-2200, nypl.org/research/sc.\n\n(Johnson)\n\nTHE STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: ‘NEW INTUITIONS: LESLIE HEWITT, TANEA RICHARDSON AND SAYA WOOLFALK,’ through Oct. 26. The contrasting artistic sensibilities of the latest participants in the Studio Museum’s artists-in-residence program maintain its impressive record. Leslie Hewitt, the most accomplished, extends the image-text combination of Conceptual Art in photographs and sculpture. Tanea Richardson, less mature but in some ways more complete, gives found fabrics and abstract form a special vehemence. Saya Woolfalk, a whiz in several mediums (starting with sewing), contributes a video, “Ethnography of No Place,” that drags a bit, but is a tour de force of performance, animation, born-again Pattern and Decoration, soft sculpture and anthropological satire. In each case race and ethnicity are among many other issues tackled. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Smith)THE STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: ‘KEHINDE WILEY, THE WORLD STAGE: AFRICA, LAGOS-DAKAR,’ through Oct. 26. In 10 recent works Kehinde Wiley shifts the focus of his big, flashy pictures of young African-American men recast as the kings, dandies, and saints of European painting to young African men in the poses of African sculpture. The show reveals a young artist who, despite several years of hotness, is only now beginning to make paintings that don’t feel mostly like campy, gaudy illustrations. The compositions are calmer, the details less fussy, and the figures are painted with a new solidity and emotional directness.144 West 125th Street, (See above.) (Smith)\n\nGalleries: Uptown\n\nSIMON LINKE Twenty years ago this London artist made a name for himself with his hand-painted copies of Artforum magazine ads. With the small, square paintings in this exhibition he has resumed that project. Almost all represent ads for famous artists, including Andy Warhol, Chris Ofili and Damien Hirst. Made with thick, buttery paint, they prompt meditation on the sacred and profane values of art. Mireille Mosler Ltd., 35 East 67th Street, (212) 249-4195, mireillemoslerltd.com, through Oct. 25. (Johnson)\n\nLIZA LOU It’s no coincidence that Liza Lou’s first New York appearance since a 2002 solo in SoHo takes place in an uptown town house and a Park Avenue lobby. Ms. Lou, a sculptor who makes hand-beaded versions of everyday objects and environments, has shifted from immersive installations (like the “Kitchen” and “Back Yard” exhibited at the New Museum in the mid-’90s) to highly marketable sculptures and relief paintings. The transition isn’t all bad. Ms. Lou’s beadwork is still dazzling, and she is certainly experimenting with different genres. The showstopper is “Security Fence” (2005-7), a shimmering 10-foot-square enclosure of barbed wire and chain-link steel completely covered with silver beads. (A similar sculpture, “Maximum Security Fence,” is on view in the lobby of Lever House, 390 Park Avenue, at 54th Street, through Nov. 29.) L & M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020, lmgallery.com; through Nov. 15 (Rosenberg).\n\nGalleries: 57th Street\n\nJOHN ALTOON Mr. Altoon (1925-1969), who made his name in the Los Angeles art scene of the 1950s and ‘60s and suffered a fatal heart attack shortly thereafter, is the latest West Coast artist to be exhumed by the contemporary market. In this exhibition of paintings and works on paper, organized by Klaus Kertess, Mr. Altoon’s well-chronicled personal demons  thrill seeking, womanizing, depression, paranoia  are on full display. His drawings, in ink, watercolor, graphite and pastel on board, show men, women and animals engaged in explicitly violent and sexual interactions. Mary Boone, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 752-2929, maryboonegallery.com, through Oct. 25. (Rosenberg)\n\nGalleries: SoHo\n\n★ RIRKRIT TIRAVANIJA: ‘DEMONSTRATION DRAWINGS’ This ambitious conceptual show by Rirkrit Tiravanija is made up of some 200 small, highly detailed graphite drawings of political protests and demonstrations from around the world. Most of the images were derived from newspaper photographs and have the on-the-spot look of reportage. All were done by artists in Thailand working on generous commissions from Mr. Tiravanija, with proceeds from the sale of the pictures going to the Land Foundation, a sustainable housing community in Thailand. The results in the show: drawing, the sine qua non of “real” art, meets the real world, and paradoxes unroll. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org, through Nov. 6. (Cotter)\n\nGalleries: Chelsea\n\nJOSEF KOUDELKA: ‘INVASION 68, PRAGUE’ During a few days in August 1968, Josef Koudelka had his first experience as a street photographer, taking pictures inside history as it unfolded. He gave a firsthand account of life, death and resistance on the streets of Prague, as the mostly Soviet tanks of the Warsaw Pact crushed the lenient Communist government led by Alexander Dubcek. Although a few negatives were smuggled to the West immediately after the occupation, this throat-catching show is the largest yet devoted to them. Aperture Gallery, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 505-5555, aperture.org, through Oct. 30. (Smith)\n\n★ DANIEL MCDONALD Daniel McDonald has been so important a part of the New York art scene since he arrived from California in 1989 that it’s hard to believe that “Bohemian Monsters” is his first local solo show. This group of painstakingly made miniature environments, detailing the struggles of impoverished artists played by yesterday’s B-movie horror film heroes, has been worth the wait. Broadway 1602, 1182 Broadway, at 28th Street, Apartment 1602 , (212) 481-0362, through Oct. 25. (Cotter)\n\nJEFF WHETSTONE: ‘POST-PLEISTOCENE’ The human urge to leave a mark has developed extensively, but caves  the first canvases  have never been left behind. Proof positive are 10 large, haunting color photographs in this engrossing New York debut. They record the accumulated drawings, signatures, messages and graffiti in caves in Tennessee and Alabama. The tools range from rocks and charcoal (such as the original cave painters used) to fluorescent spray paint; the mark makers range from slaves to contemporary teen-agers. The result is an inadvertent cultural cross-section that is sometimes beautiful and always eerie. Julie Saul Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-2410, saulgallery.com, through Oct. 25. (Smith)\n\nSUE WILLIAMS: ‘PROJECT FOR THE NEW AMERICAN CENTURY’ In this bifurcated show the artist starts to recapture the energy and fury of the crudely painted, scathingly feminist cartoon paintings that established her reputation in the first place in a series of small, messy, politically motivated works on acetate. The larger and more expensive items have a new level of visual nastiness, but they are also more drawn than painted  in fact, their mechanical, textilelike exquisiteness is exactly the problem that the smaller efforts avoid. David Zwirner, 525 West 19th Street, (212) 727-2070, through Oct. 25. (Smith)\n\nGalleries: Other\n\n‘ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM: A WORLD ELSEWHERE’ A gallery chain based in London and owned by an auction house opens in New York in an overdone, chopped-up space with a shapeless, absurdly unnecessary exhibition of paintings and sculptures by those mythic market stalwarts, the leaders of the New York School. Under crowded (auction-house-like) conditions await exceptional works by Clyfford Still, Franz Kline, Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, David Smith and more, often lent by museums. That nothing is for sale is meant to impress, but it doesn’t do much to reduce the aura of commercial savvy, or the sense that a history recounted often and better elsewhereright?/lg//yes/lb is being told yet again for all the wrong reasons. Haunch of Venison, 1230 Avenue of the Americas, near 49th Street, Manhattan, (212) 636-2034, haunchofvenison.com, through Nov. 12. (Smith)\n\n’BEGIN AGAIN RIGHT BACK HERE’ With a small, early Sol LeWitt grid sculpture as touchstone, the curatorial debut of the artist B. Wurtz proves that less can be anything. The modest efforts of 14 artists, 3 designers and 1 writer  including Vincent Fecteau, Sterling Ruby, Taylor Davis, Jessica Jackson Hutchins, Fawn Krieger, Anna Castelli and Wayne Koestenbaum  variously mix aspects of sculpture, design object, architectural model, clothing or book. Their delicate mood is nicely confirmed or disrupted by smaller displays of Mark Barrow’s texture-obsessed paintings; the raucous quilts of Violette Alby; and a 25-year survey of work by the talented Dan Asher, whose irresistible musical video “Moonscape” should not be missed. White Columns, 320 West 13th Street (entrance on Horatio Street), West Village, (212) 924-4212, whitecolumns.org, through Oct. 25. (Smith)\n\n’IMPLANT’ Organized by a curator at the Horticultural Society of New York, “Implant” takes inspiration from Michael Pollan’s 2001 book, “The Botany of Desire,” which suggests that plants are using us for evolutionary purposes just as much as we are using them. Musicians entertain the foliage in Peter Coffin’s greenhouse; a tree in a digital animation by Hiraki Sawa trots on human legs through a Dalíesque landscape. Roughly 100 works by 45 contemporary artists add to our sense of a gradual shift in the artist-plant relationship, from sublime awe in the face of nature to something more reciprocal. UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, between 51st and 52nd Streets; (212) 713-2885, hsny.org, through Oct. 31.\n\n(Rosenberg)\n\n‘OUT NOW!’ The artist Anton Vidokle organized this exhibition to protest both the war in Iraq and the tepid response of American art institutions to that war. The work is tightly installed, text-intensive and hot with information. Among the contributors are the Irish journalist Patrick Cockburn; the peace activist Kathy Kelly; the writer Jalal Toufic; the artists Natasha Sadr Haghighian, Trevor Paglen and Martha Rosler; and the artist collective Friends of William Blake. E-Flux, 41 Essex Street, Lower East Side, (212) 619-3356, e-flux.com, through Nov 8.

One of the show’s discoveries, Grace Ndiritu, uses printed fabrics in an evocative four-screen video installation  allowing her bare limbs to peek out from behind curtains or posing as a mummified Olympia. A related show, “The Essential Art of African Textiles: Design Without End,” is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart, through Dec. 6. (Rosenberg)\n\n* ‘SCULPTING TIME’ This exceptionally beautiful exhibition features four painters who are famous for repeating themselves over many years: Josef Albers, On Kawara, Giorgio Morandi and Roman Opalka. (A fifth, Andrew Grassi, who creates small, technically impressive Photorealist paintings, seems to have wandered in from another exhibition.) Sparely installed in a warren of eight intimate rooms, the show turns the gallery into a numinous aesthetic funhouse. Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 999-7337, speronewestwater.com, through Nov. 1. (Johnson)\n\nTADASKY In the 1960s Tadasky (Tadasuke Kuwayama) painted optically captivating compositions of concentric rings on square canvases. Excellent examples are included in a retrospective exhibition at Sideshow and in D. Wigmore’s “Four Optic Visionaries,” which also features works by Richard Anuszkiewicz, Sue Fuller and Mon Levinson, who were all included, along with Tadasky, in the Museum of Modern Art’s famous 1965 exhibition “The Responsive Eye.” Sideshow, 319 Bedford Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 486-8180, sideshowgallery.com; through Oct. 19. D. Wigmore Fine Art, 730 Fifth Avenue, near 57th Street, (212) 581-1657, dwigmore.com, through Nov. 15. (Johnson)\n\nLast Chance\n\n★ GUILD HALL MUSEUM: ‘LARRY RIVERS: MAJOR EARLY WORKS’ Tracking Larry Rivers’s rapid evolution from figurative realism at the start of his career in the early 1950s to Pop-style history painting in the mid-’60s, this show reveals a terrifically fertile, energetic and daring talent discovering itself and lunging into the future. His 1955 painting of his corpulent mother-in-law, Berdie Burger  who appears in the painting twice, both times nude  is one of the great miracles of 20th-century American art. 158 Main Street, East Hampton, N.Y., (631) 324-0806, guildhall.org; closes on Sunday.{cq} (Johnson)\n\n7DAVID HARRISON: ‘GREEN AND PLEASANT LAND’ The force of the New York debut of this London artist is somewhat muffled by the current profusion of retro, awkward and/or small-scale figurative painting and drawing (to which this gallery has certainly contributed). The best works merge goth suggestion, visionary light and Edwardian comportment, usually in landscapes with mysterious houses. Colors are rich; styles, subjects and paint handling vary; robust chunks of collage sometimes enter the pictures, as does an owl or two. Enough is happening to bode well for the future. Daniel Reich Gallery, 537A West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-4949, danielreichgallery.com; closes on Saturday.{cq} (Smith)\n\nEUNICE KIM: ‘MOON THE MAGIC LOSER’ In her first gallery show Eunice Kim has created something like a walk-in Cornell box, only more ephemeral and overtly recycled. After lining the gallery’s two exhibition spaces with sheets of newspaper, she populated it sparsely with sculptures and mobiles, all made of found materials and objects. Some are better than others, but the low-tech, light-touch transformation of the white cube is hard to beat. Canada, 55 Chrystie Street, near Hester Street, Lower East Side, (212) 925-4631, canadanewyork.com; closes on Sunday. (Smith)\n\nTHE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: ‘PHOTOGRAPHY ON PHOTOGRAPHY: REFLECTIONS ON THE MEDIUM SINCE 1960’ This second installation in the Met’s new modern photography galleries is much better than the first, largely because of its variety of works (by artists male and female, young and old, American and European, famous and fledgling). Thomas Ruff and Hiroshi Sugimoto are here, but so are Janice Guy, an artist turned dealer who is benefiting from a sudden interest in her early self-portraits, and Mark Wyse, a young photographer who is also active as a curator. The show is also an excellent epilogue to the historical survey “Framing a Century: Master Photographers 1840-1940,” just across the hall in the Howard Gilman Gallery. If “Framing a Century” presents a hallowed history of photography, “Photography on Photography” gleefully violates that sanctity. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes on Sunday.{cq} (Rosenberg)\n\n★ STAN VANDERBEEK Stan VanDerBeek (1927-1984) was an experimental filmmaker, animator, computer graphics pioneer, painter, photographer, collagist and poet who was ahead of his time. He was globalist in his thinking, believed that aesthetics and science could fruitfully merge, and nurtured an avid faith  one lost at present  in the potential of art to change, for the better, the way people everywhere felt, acted and thought. Guild & Greyshkul, 28 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 625-9224; closes on Saturday. (Cotter)"
