Death” with sad figure\n\n78I-29A\n\n“Reliance … A Hopeful Child”\n\n78I-31A\n\nKeywords: Gravestone, feature.\n\nLocation: Montague, Massachusetts.\n\nFor interesting images of graveyards, it is hard to beat this one near Montague center.\n\nWith pine limbs bending down\n\n79E-07\n\nKeywords: View, cemetary.\n\nLocation: Montague, Massachusetts.\n\nThis shot seems to be the best of a half dozen similar images.\n\nThomas L. Butte/rfield\n\n79E-24\n\nKeywords: Gravestone, name.\n\nLocation: Sunderland, Massachusetts.\n\nA surprising number of old New England gravestones have text that is weirdly split between lines. There are other examples in this collection.\n\n“Tryphosa Gunn, a lovely child…”\n\n79E-26\n\nKeywords: Gravestone, name.\n\nLocation: Sunderland, Massachusetts.\n\nGunn is a common name (but not Tryphosa) in Sunderland and Montague. I recently (2006) tried to find this stone for old times sake, but couldn’t locate it.\n\nShed skin of a boa constrictor\n\n80A-33A\n\nKeywords: Animal, snake.\n\nLocation: Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nFor some years I had a pet boa. In my care, she grew from about a half inch in diameter to about four inches in diameter (and six feet long). She was very docile except when she was hungry, so I kept her well fed, mostly with mice.\n\nBeech Fern at 160 Gray St.\n\n80B-20\n\nKeywords: Plant, fern.\n\nLocation: Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nThis fern (just a sprig or two) originally came from the side of Mt. Toby. It absolutely loves my back yard where I grow about 20 native fern species.\n\nTobacco leaves (Jekanowski farm)\n\n80F-22\n\nKeywords: Plant, crop.\n\nLocation: Hadley, Massachusetts.\n\nAs with several other images, this one stemmed from years when our kids picked cucumbers and tobacco. Although tobacco is still profitably grown in the Pioneer Valley (for cigar wrappers, I am told), cucumbers are grown less since a farmers’ cooperative (previously Oxford Pickle) closed its processing plant in South Deerfield.\n\nTobacco barn end on, Jekanowski farm\n\n80I-13\n\nKeywords: Building, farm.\n\nLocation: Hadley, Massachusetts.\n\nThis symmetry is striking in this very popular image.\n\nHarvesting tobacco\n\n80I-23\n\nKeywords: Plant, crop.\n\nLocation: Hadley, Massachusetts.\n\nMy teenage son, Steven, at the Jekanowski Farm on Roosevelt Road. After a single axe cut, the stalks are spiked and hung upside down in barns for drying. This tobacco is used for cigars, I think.\n\nChopping tobacco with UMass beyond\n\n80I-29\n\nKeywords: View, farm.\n\nLocation: Hadley, Massachusetts.\n\nThe hard-working tobacco chopper is our son, Steven.\n\nGrass weeds against clapboards\n\n81A-18\n\nKeywords: Plant, grass.\n\nLocation: Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nThe building was the offices of the USDA on Triangle Street. The building is now doctors’ offices. A similar composition is 09C-27\n\nStones under large maple tree\n\n81F-10\n\nKeywords: View, cemetary.\n\nLocation: Hadley, Massachusetts.\n\nCemetery Road in Hadley is one of our favorite views in the valley. Acres and acres of flat, fertile land west of the cemetery with the Berkshire foothills to the west and the Holyoke Range to the south gives us a thrill every time we go to Northampton. Some of the parcels are in danger of being developed and the Kestrel Trust is in the forefront of preservation efforts.\n\n“Brand S” lumber, and mirrored image\n\n81F-27\n\nKeywords: Sign, playful.\n\nLocation: Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nI think the workers who labeled this lumber inadvertently reversed the stencil – or maybe not. I have a large collection of whimsical signs. My policy is to avoid signs that are deliberately cute; this one is border-line.\n\nCrabgrass in asphalt crack\n\n81F-29\n\nKeywords: Plant, weed.\n\nLocation: Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nIn the parking lot behind the stores on Triangle Street. Crabgrass is very hardy.\n\nFine Arts Center, bike and reflecting pool\n\n81F-35\n\nKeywords: Building, UMass.\n\nLocation: Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nSome of my photography friends also have a picture like this. As some viewers know, the reflecting pool is gone. Too bad.\n\nUnused Library with weeds\n\n81G-03\n\nKeywords: Building, UMass\n\nLocation: Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nWhen the library bricks from high up were chipping off and threatening pedestrians below, the University put a fence around the base, but neglected to cut the weeds inside the fence for a long time. The day after I took this picture while wandering around, the weeds were cut. Your guess as to why is as good as mine.\n\n“University Gallery”\n\n81G-04\n\nKeywords: Sign, door.\n\nLocation: Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nNice shadows; they have changed since the Fine Arts Center foyer has been built.\n\nFine Arts Center, reader on steps\n\n81G-07\n\nKeywords: Pattern, steps.\n\nLocation: Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nThe reader consented to having his pleasant day interrupted. I don’t know who he was.\n\nSkid marks on high school lot\n\n81G-15\n\nKeywords: Pattern, skids.\n\nLocation: Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nI used a ladder to get a better view of high school students “art” work.\n\n“Samuel Phillips Porter” axed\n\n81G-25\n\nKeywords: Gravestone, story.\n\nLocation: Hadley, Massachusetts.\n\nWhy would the family put this sentiment on a gravestone? This stone is no longer there. Where is it?\n\nThree young Montague children\n\n81G-29\n\nKeywords: Gravestone, name.\n\nLocation: Hadley, Massachusetts.\n\nThe Montague graveyard has a lot of photogenic images. (See also 79D-19 and 79E-07.)\n\n“Daniel Marsh”\n\n81G-31\n\nKeywords: Gravestone, name.\n\nLocation: Hadley, Massachusetts.\n\nApparently hand-carved on a tight budget. When photographing gravestones I often use a door mirror mounted on a tripod so I can glance sunlight off the stone to better read the inscription. Note that the stone in the background has a dark side toward the viewer; the Marsh stone would too except for the mirror off the picture to the right.\n\nSarah Hopkins Williams\n\n81G-32\n\nKeywords: Gravestone, name.\n\nLocation: Hadley, Massachusetts.\n\nThe previous and the next negative are also in this collection. A good photo day.\n\nChester Williams\n\n81G-33\n\nKeywords: Gravestone, name.\n\nLocation: Hadley, Massachusetts.\n\nAn upstanding citizen.\n\nGirl in UMass chain link maze\n\n81H-02\n\nKeywords: Pattern, fence.\n\nLocation: Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nThe maze no longer exists. It was fun but fell into disrepair. Its place has been taken by the astronomical Stonehenge-like array.\n\nAmherst dog pound (since moved)\n\n81H-09\n\nKeywords: Building, run-down.\n\nLocation: Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nThere was a dog there (just one), but it did not want its picture taken.\n\nGas pumps boarded up [now dental office]\n\n81I-12\n\nKeywords: Building, run-down.\n\nLocation: Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nSince the 1960’s, an auto mechanic garage on this spot, and then just a gas station both folded. Funny, its location on Triangle Street with its traffic seems ideal. It is now a dental office. (Some viewers will know that there was plenty of opposition to the building of Triangle Street in the early 1800’s, and at night protestors would dig up what was put down during the day.)\n\n“Emily Dickinson, Called Back”\n\n81I-16\n\nKeywords: Gravestone, name.\n\nLocation: Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nI have seen several versions of this difficult-to-take picture. (Check it out.) Mine is pretty good.\n\nLibrary with student and swans\n\n81K-09\n\nKeywords: Building, UMass\n\nLocation: Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nHow’s this for a post card?\n\nFine Arts Center, strollers and dog\n\n81K-17\n\nKeywords: Building, UMass\n\nLocation: Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nIt’s too bad that the dog doesn’t look very dog-like.\n\nFive school buses in a row – Junior High\n\n81L-30\n\nKeywords: Vehicle, buses.\n\nLocation: Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nBuses line up at the (now) Amherst Middle School. When I look at this picture I always ask myself why it is “buses” rather than “busses.”\n\nPost Office and Tax Collector\n\n82A-12\n\nKeywords: Building, official.\n\nLocation: New Salem, Massachusetts.\n\nThis building is no longer there. The picture was taken a not long before sunset.\n\n“Mary Ann” with fence and shadow\n\n82A-19\n\nKeywords: Gravestone, name.\n\nLocation: New Salem, Massachusetts.\n\nNear the Post Office (82A-12) even closer to sunset. At last check, Mary Ann’s stone is still there.\n\nRoad to Greenwood Music Camp\n\n82B-04\n\nKeywords: View, woods.\n\nLocation: Cummington, Massachusetts.\n\nThis shot was used for the advertising poster for my first photo show, “Across the Valley; from Cummington to New Salem,” at the Burnett Gallery in 1983. The Burnett Gallery was relocated (to its current quarters) when the Jones Library addition was built in the early 1990’s.\n\nSmall stone embraced by tree trunk\n\n82B-08\n\nKeywords: Gravestone, feature.\n\nLocation: Cummington, Massachusetts.\n\nIt’s clear that both the stone and the tree have a long history in this spot.\n\nClapboards and window\n\n82B-30\n\nKeywords: Buildingm run-down.\n\nLocation: Cummington, Massachusetts.\n\nI think the structure seen in the window is a bed. Note that you can see through the small house.\n\nLarge cut leaf beech, Main and Triangle\n\n82C-05\n\nKeywords: Plant, tree.\n\nLocation: Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nThe tree is still there and healthy (but needs trimming) just south of the Woman’s Club building.\n\n“Tillson Farm Boiler Plant” – sort of\n\n82D-01\n\nKeywords: Sign, playful.\n\nLocation: Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nI think this is a true whimsical sign in that it occurred without plan – the letters just fell off. Some viewers will know that the multi-million-dollar power plant never operated because it was incorrectly designed and/or constructed. It is still there (with its tall stack, 82D-14), although the oil tank (82D-11) for fuel storage has been dismantled.\n\nSteps wrapped around oil tank, UMass\n\n82D-11\n\nKeywords: Pattern, steps.\n\nLocation: Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nThis tank was built for fuel for the faulty power plant (82D-01). I love the subtle shifting patterns of the steps and their shadows.\n\nSmokestack on inoperable power plant\n\n82D-14\n\nKeywords: Building, UMass.\n\nLocation: Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nAn impressive symbol of things gone awry.\n\nMarijuana in flagstone crack, UMass\n\n82F-09\n\nKeywords: Plants, weeds.\n\nLocation: Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nWhile wandering around campus I snapped this small marijuana plant in a flagstone crack at the campus center, most likely from a discarded butt. I spent a lot of time with composition. As with the weeds around the library (81G-03), the next day the plant was not there. I think a university employee saw me and thought I was about to write a newspaper expose of campus life.\n\nParking garage and smoke stacks\n\n82F-13\n\nKeywords: Buildings, UMass.\n\nLocation: Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nA big still life.\n\nGoatsbeard under Elder Lumber\n\n82G-05\n\nKeywords: Plant, flower.\n\nLocation: Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nA lovely flower in an inauspicious spot. All it takes sometimes is one flower to grace a scene.\n\nThree Raggedy Anns in wagon\n\n82G-09\n\nKeywords: Arts, fair.\n\nLocation: Deerfield, Massachusetts.\n\nFor what it’s worth, my mother (then age 81) really liked this picture. Since viewers filter images through their own unique experiences of a lifetime, it is often unpredictable what will appeal to different people.\n\nFamily of grotesques stuffed in silk\n\n82G-14\n\nKeywords: Arts, fair.\n\nLocation: Deerfield, Massachusetts.\n\nMy friend, Alex Page (English Department), was taken with this and similar images of grotesques at the Old Deerfield Crafts Fair. He is a skilled humorist and I appreciate his support.\n\nWindsor Dam\n\n82H-08\n\nKeywords: Climate, fog.\n\nLocation: Quabbin, Massachusetts.\n\nThis image is one of my personal favorites and has long hung on my own wall. I have always printed it small – 5×7″ — although it is a very large object — a viewer takes it in all at once. And it reminds me of the personal sacrifices of many regular folk who were called on to relieve the thirst of faraway but powerful people.\n\nLion in window of Quincy Market store\n\n82I-10\n\nKeywords: Arts, store.\n\nLocation: Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nSee my wife, Elaine, in the window?\n\nQuincy Market band and strollers\n\n82I-19\n\nKeywords: People, street.\n\nLocation: Boston, Massachusetts.\n\nTaken from a Faneuil Hall window.\n\nTwo Mary Persons stones\n\n82J-16\n\nKeywords: Gravestones, names.\n\nLocation: Northampton, Massachusetts.\n\nGravestones reveal that old New England families sometimes reused the name of a dead child.\n\nPrize apples at Cummington Fair\n\n82K-05A\n\nKeywords: Plant, fruit.\n\nLocation: Cummington, Massachusetts.\n\nWe go to the Cummington Fair almost every year. It’s down-to-earth New England at its best.\n\nElijah Bordwell – thrown from horse\n\n82L-08\n\nKeywords: Gravestone, story.\n\nLocation: Montague, Massachusetts.\n\nGravestones sometimes tell a story – not always a short story.\n\n“Our birth is nothing”\n\n82L-10\n\nKeywords: Gravestone, phrase.\n\nLocation: Montague, Massachusetts.\n\nI get a tear every time.\n\n“ALMYS”\n\n82L-21\n\nKeywords: Sign, run-down.\n\nLocation: Hadley, Massachusetts.\n\nThe malls in Hadley passed through some tough times, and Almys didn’t last too long. Here it is defunct.\n\nPickle vat “379”\n\n82M-25\n\nKeywords: Sign, number\n\nLocation: South Deerfield, Massachusetts.\n\nThis is one of hundreds (you see) of vats at the Oxford Pickle processing plant. Elaine and I wandered in, and, although we wondered whether we should be there, nobody stopped us. We climbed a ladder to view the cucumber contents and (we say) could have spat in the vat. After perhaps 15 minutes, someone politely suggested that we leave.\n\n“MSC” banister ironwork, UMass\n\n83B-18\n\nKeywords: Sign, run-down.\n\nLocation: Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nThat is, Massachusetts State College (one stage in University evolution) on the President’s hill path.\n\nCarved “Lisa+Steve” Durfee beech tree\n\n83B-31\n\nKeywords: Sign, graffiti.\n\nLocation: Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nThis is one of many Girl + Boy signs in my collection.\n\nMe taking a picture of a hornet’s nest\n\n83C-32\n\nKeywords: Arthur, age 52.\n\nLocation: Leverett, Massachusetts.\n\nThis picture was taken by my wife, Elaine, at Moore’s Corner. I think the building is the Leverett Historical Society.\n\nMarble bank facade within museum\n\n83D-32\n\nKeywords: Building, museum.\n\nLocation: New York, New York.\n\nThis bank, Branch of the United States Bank, stood on Wall Street, 1822-1824. The facade was preserved and reconstructed inside the museum in 1924. The roof latticework is seen from the outside in picture 83E-04.\n\nCleopatra and viewer – Metropolitan\n\n83D-36\n\nKeywords: Arts, museum.\n\nLocation: New York, New York.\n\nI have to go look at this statue every time we visit the MET, to see is anyone else is staring at Cleopatra’s breast.\n\nCouple outside Metropolitan glass facade\n\n83E-04\n\nKeywords: Arts, museum.\n\nLocation: New York, New York.\n\nMy hip young friends tell me that the Led Zeppellins are still in business.\n\nLooking out my Aunt Nata’s window.\n\n83E-30\n\nKeywords: View, city.\n\nLocation: New York, New York.\n\nMy aunt lived in an apartment at 72nd Street and 3rd Avenue. The view is northwest toward Central Park (unseen). The picture shows where people live, but no people are seen. The viewer can find four wooden water tanks, which are all over New York, even on top of the fanciest places.\n\nStrollers and manikins, 3rd Avenue\n\n83E-34\n\nKeywords: People, street.\n\nLocation: New York, New York.\n\nWe used to visit my Aunt Nata on the upper East Side once in a while. She had the world’s most uncomfortable pull-out sofa, probably to discourage visitors.\n\nGear & Flask, Museum of Modern Art\n\n83F-11\n\nKeywords: Arts, museum.\n\nLocation: New York, New York.\n\nI’d like to say this was a carefully arranged image, but, in fact, it just happened.\n\nEast 53rd with Citibank Building\n\n83F-15\n\nKeywords: View, city.\n\nLocation: New York, New York.\n\nI am reminded that my favorite painter, Edward Hopper, lived almost all his entire life in New York City and never painted a skyscraper (except maybe for the bottoms). He was into things horizontal.\n\n“How do I love thee…”\n\n83F-22\n\nKeywords: Sign, playful.\n\nLocation: New York, New York.\n\nA vase in the window of the Steuben Glass store. It struck my funny bone that love was worth exactly $250.\n\nSteuben kingfisher – 5th Avenue store\n\n83F-25\n\nKeywords: Arts, store.\n\nLocation: New York, New York.\n\nThere is no more lighting here than the store arranged. They did a superb job.\n\nMerry-go-round horses [circular]\n\n83H-08\n\nKeywords: Arts, fair.\n\nLocation: Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nI have many times tried to get good images of carousel horses (which are often artful). This is the best I can do.\n\n“Reserved for Masse’s Fish”\n\n83H-25\n\nKeywords: Sign, playful.\n\nLocation: Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nThis sign really struck my funny bone. The store is no longer there – it is now Bruegger’s Bagels. But Masse’s still has a store in Chicopee, and I occasionally see their truck in Amherst.\n\nTed Sargent’s dobros\n\n83K-06\n\nKeywords: Arts, music.\n\nLocation: Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nMy colleague, Ted Sargent, is an internationally known lepidopterist, but also a musician, among yet other callings.\n\nPun buttons at Crafts Fair\n\n83P-17\n\nKeywords: Sign, playful.\n\nLocation: Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nLots of cute puns here; choose your favorite.\n\nEmily Dickinson’s steps, Main St.\n\n83Q-09\n\nKeywords: Pattern, steps.\n\nLocation: Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nOne of my popular images. The shadow is no longer there, being interrupted by the hemlock trees along the street. Come back when the hemlock trees get chopped down.\n\n“Stop, Stop, Stop” – Laguardia Airport\n\n83Q-36\n\nKeywords: Sign, command.\n\nLocation: New York, New York.\n\nI like this three-level command. I have several different angles on them.\n\n“STOP, STOP, STOP”\n\n83R-04\n\nKeywords: Sign, command.\n\nLocation: New York, New York.\n\nThree floors of exiting roundabouts in the parking garage at LaGuardia Airport.\n\nFacade with broken windows\n\n83R-19\n\nKeywords: Building, run-down.\n\nLocation: Springfield, Massachusetts.\n\nTaken from the platform of the Amtrak Station\n\nTwo Holsteins, Roaring Brook Rd.\n\n83S-17\n\nKeywords: Animal, cows.\n\nLocation: Conway, Massachusetts.\n\nCows are traditional photo subjects and I’m not immune. See also 84B-08. Like tombstones, cows just stand there without waving in the breeze.\n\n“Trespassing Forbidden” at State School\n\n83T-24\n\nKeywords: Sign, command.\n\nLocation: Belchertown, Massachusetts.\n\nThe Belchertown State School had been closed for several years, its citizens dispersed, and its buildings quick to disintegrate.\n\nFour Holsteins, South East St.\n\n84B-08\n\nKeywords: Animal, cows.\n\nLocation: Amherst, Massachusetts.\n\nThis shot is near the confluence of Hop Brook and the Mill River (where beavers abound) near the bike path bridge over South East Street.

A few hundred feet further is “Two Lights,” a scene that was painted several times by Edward Hopper (see 00D-32). Along this stretch of Maine coast, I have repeatedly tried to take wave pictures that might measure up to the paintings of Winslow Homer. I have never come close.\n\nBoats and squiggly reflections\n\n95K-08\n\nKeywords: View, harbor.\n\nLocation: Camde, Maine.\n\nOur friends (see 95G-02) were negotiating here to buy a small boat (but did not).

A man was raking smooth the gravel paths. I asked him the name of the flowers that graced a fence, and he told me (a Clematis species). Then I said that I loved the layout (and whimsical stone decorations), but was put off by the pink plastic-covered poles. He said, “That’s funny; I designed this garden.” So said Dean Cardasis of the Landscape Architecture Department (filling in for the maintenance person, who had broken his shoulder).\n\nWeed & shadow & wall crack\n\n97M-05\n\nKeywords: Plant, weed.\n\nLocation: Northport, New York\n\nWe are lucky to have relatives who live here in Northport, on the north shore of Long Island not far from the City.

The answer is that I find enough to do in black and white, and sometimes color is a distraction. Occasionally, I say to myself, wouldn’t this be a nice image in color, and I either take it anyway, or I don’t take it at all. I can say this would be a nice color picture. So be it.\n\nDoll game, vendor, misspelling\n\n00N-09A\n\nKeywords: Sign, information.\n\nLocation: Cummington, Massachusetts.\n\nAs I said before, I am less and less interested in misspellings.
