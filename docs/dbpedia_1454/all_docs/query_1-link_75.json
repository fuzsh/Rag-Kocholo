        "text": "For other uses, see Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace (disambiguation).\n\nStar Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace is a 1999 film written and directed by George Lucas, produced by Rick McCallum and starring Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman, Jake Lloyd, and Ian McDiarmid. It is the first chapter of the Star Wars prequel trilogy, the fourth theatrical Star Wars release overall, and chronologically the first film in the Star Wars saga.\n\nThe Phantom Menace was released in theaters on May 19, 1999, becoming the first Star Wars film since Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, which was released sixteen years earlier. The release was accompanied by extensive media coverage and great fan anticipation. Despite mixed reviews from critics and fans, the film grossed $924.3 million worldwide, making it the second-highest-grossing Star Wars film when unadjusted for inflation. It was released on Blu-ray in September 2011, and was re-released in theaters in 3D on February 10, 2012.\n\nThe film was the catalyst for fifteen years of Star Wars storytelling that would primarily take place around the time of the prequel storyline. The success of the film allowed for the next two chapters of the prequel trilogy, as well as the Star Wars: The Clone Wars film and television series.\n\nOpening crawl[]\n\nPlot summary[]\n\nThirty-two years before the events of Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope (thirteen years before the formation of the Galactic Empire), there is a trade dispute between the Trade Federation and the outlying systems of the Galactic Republic, which has led to a blockade of the Mid-Rim planet of Naboo. Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum, leader of the Galactic Senate, has secretly dispatched two Jedi, Master Qui-Gon Jinn and his Padawan, Obi-Wan Kenobi, to serve as \"the ambassadors\" to the Federation flagship, in order to meet with Viceroy Nute Gunray and resolve the dispute. Unknown to them, the Trade Federation is in league with the mysterious Darth Sidious, Dark Lord of the Sith, who secretly orders Gunray to invade Naboo and kill the two Jedi upon their arrival. When Gunray asked if that would be legal, Sidious says that he would ensure that it was.\n\nThe Viceroy locks the Jedi in the meeting room and attempts to kill them with poison gas while having their ship, the Radiant VII, destroyed in the hangar, but they escape. After battling through squads of battle droids, Jinn and Kenobi make their way to the command deck where Gunray is located, shielding himself behind blast doors. The Jedi are forced to flee upon the arrival of two Destroyer Droids and stow away aboard two separate Federation landing craft leaving for the surface of Naboo to begin the invasion.\n\nBack in the command deck, Queen Amidala contacts Gunray to express her disapproval of their blockade, with Gunray explaining that they wouldn't have done it without the approval of the Senate. When she asks about the ambassadors sent by the Chancellor, Gunray claims that they have received no such ambassadors, leaving Amidala startled and suspicious. Gunray ends communications with her and informs his aide that they should disable all communications on the planet.\n\nMeanwhile, Amidala is conversing with Senator Sheev Palpatine regarding the recent attempt at negotiations and how Gunray claimed that they did not receive any ambassadors. Surprised, Palpatine states that he had assurances from the Chancellor that his ambassadors did arrive. However, Palpatine is unable to finish his sentence as his hologram flickers out. Naboo Governor Sio Bibble suspects that an interruption of communications is a sign that an invasion from the Trade Federation is imminent.\n\nOn the planet's surface, Qui-Gon saves native outcast Jar Jar Binks from being crushed by a Trade Federation MTT. Kenobi appears, pursued by STAPs, which are destroyed by Qui-Gon. Jar Jar Binks shows the two Jedi the way to an underwater Gungan settlement, Otoh Gunga. Meanwhile, the Trade Federation occupies Theed, the capital city of Naboo, and captures Queen Amidala along with the rest of the government. In Otoh Gunga, the Jedi meet the Gungan leader, Boss Nass, and ask him to help the people of Naboo, but Nass refuses due to hate of the people of Naboo and sends them off in a bongo submarine. They are attacked by an opee sea killer and a colo claw fish but both fish are eaten by a sando aqua monster. The Jedi, with Binks in tow, arrive in Theed and rescue Queen Amidala. They depart for Coruscant, the Galactic Republic's capital planet, to ask for help from the Senate. As they attempt to run the blockade, the queen's starship is damaged by Federation battleships, but an astromech droid named R2-D2 manages to repair it and they narrowly escape.\n\nDue to the damage to the ship's hyperdrive sustained in the attack, the Jedi decide to land on the nearby planet Tatooine for repairs. While searching for a new hyperdrive generator, they befriend young Anakin Skywalker, a slave boy, whose master is Watto, a Toydarian junk dealer. Watto has the required parts in stock, but Qui-Gon is unable to purchase them, as Republic credits are worthless on Tatooine.\n\nAnakin is gifted with piloting and mechanical abilities, and has built an almost-complete droid named C-3PO. Qui-Gon senses a strong presence of the Force in Anakin, and feels that he may be the Chosen One—the one who will fulfill a prophecy by bringing balance to the Force. By entering Anakin into a podrace, Qui-Gon orchestrates a gamble with Watto's chance cube in which \"fate\" decided that the boy (alone, since Qui-Gon was unable to include the youth's mother in the bargain) will be released from slavery while also acquiring the parts needed for their ship. The night before the race, Qui-Gon does a blood test on Anakin and discovers that the boy's midi-chlorian reading is off the chart.\n\nAnakin wins the race (defeating his rival, Sebulba) and joins the team as they prepare to leave for Coruscant, where Qui-Gon plans to seek permission from the Jedi High Council to train Anakin to be a Jedi. Meanwhile, Darth Sidious sends his apprentice, Darth Maul, to kill the two Jedi and capture the queen. Maul appears just as the group is leaving the planet, and duels with Qui-Gon. The fight is cut short when Qui-Gon escapes his black-robed assailant by jumping on board the Naboo Royal Starship as it takes off.\n\nOn Coruscant, Qui-Gon informs the Jedi Council of the mysterious attacker he encountered on Tatooine, coming to the conclusion that his attacker is a Sith, the latter being a religious order who were followers of the dark side of the Force and thought to have been extinct for over a millennium, much to the shock of the Jedi Council. Qui-Gon also informs the Council about Anakin, hoping that he can be trained as a Jedi. After testing the boy and deliberating with one another, the Council refuses, deeming him too old for training according to the Jedi Code. They are also concerned that they sense much fear in the boy, and that he has a clouded future.\n\nMeanwhile, Senator Palpatine meets with Queen Amidala to warn of corruption in the Senate and advises that she may have to call for a Vote of No Confidence in Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum. When their petition to the Senate is refused, Amidala sees no alternative but to do just that. Palpatine is among the candidates to become the new Supreme Chancellor. The queen later announces to Palpatine that she will return to their home planet to repel the invasion of her people by herself. She is frustrated by the Senate's deliberation and lack of action, and feels that even if Palpatine is elected Chancellor, it will be too late. The Jedi Council sends the two Jedi to accompany the queen back to Naboo, hoping to shed light on any Sith involvement.\n\nAmidala, back on Naboo, attempts to locate the Gungans at Otoh Gunga, but Jar-Jar, after searching the city, informs them that it has been abandoned. He then leads them to the Gungan Sacred Place, where he is certain the Gungans will be. The Gungans are initially distrustful, until the \"handmaiden\" Padmé reveals herself as the true queen and humbly begs for their help. She negotiates with Boss Nass to form an alliance and unite their peoples in battle against the Trade Federation. Captain Quarsh Panaka and several other security forces were also dispatched to rescue anyone imprisoned in the Trade Federation's prison camps, although they were only able to successfully extract a handful.\n\nNext, Amidala informs Qui-Gon and Nass of her battle strategy: with the Grand Gungan Army acting as a distraction to the bulk of the main Trade Federation forces, the Naboo resistance led by herself, Captain Panaka and the Jedi will infiltrate Theed via a secret entrance located inside one of the waterfalls. Nute Gunray, hearing reports of the Grand Army's assembly, informs Darth Sidious; Sidious orders Gunray to wipe out both the Gungans and the Naboo as the Trade Federation prepares for battle.\n\nCaptain Roos Tarpals orders the Gungan Grand Army to activate their shield, which protects them from ranged attack. OOM-9 has his tanks fire first, but seeing them fail to penetrate the powerful shield, orders them to cease fire. Daultay Dofine gives the command to activate the battle droids. These droids march through the shield and open fire on the Grand Army, soon destroying the shield generator. As the tanks cause heavy casualties among the Gungans, defeat for the alliance seems imminent.\n\nHowever, victory comes when young Anakin Skywalker accidentally takes control of an N-1 starfighter and goes on to destroy the Federation's Droid Control Ship from the inside, killing Daultay Dofine and rendering the droid army useless. Meanwhile, Amidala and her force fight their way back into the royal palace and capture Nute Gunray.\n\nAt the same time, in a Theed hangar bay, Darth Maul engages in combat with the two Jedi, using his double-bladed lightsaber. The battle moves from the hangar, across a series of catwalks, to the Theed Generator Complex. During the fight, Obi-Wan is separated from his master by being kicked off of a catwalk. He grabs the edge of another catwalk below and jumps back up to where Qui-Gon and Maul continue to fight. By this time, Qui-Gon and Maul have become separated by a force field in the entrance to the Generator Room. Obi-Wan catches up to them, but is divided from his master by four force fields. When the force fields deactivate, Jinn and Maul continue their battle while Kenobi remains divided from the battle by one force field when they all reactivate.\n\nAfter a lengthy duel, Maul suddenly stuns Qui-Gon by hitting him on the chin with his lightsaber handle, then rams his blade straight into Qui-Gon's torso, mortally wounding him. Devastated and angered, Obi-Wan redoubles his assault upon Maul and chops the Sith's lightsaber in half, but Maul eventually overpowers and nearly kills Kenobi by Force pushing him over the edge of a seemingly bottomless reactor shaft. Obi-Wan saves himself from falling when he manages to grab onto a pipe protruding from the wall of the shaft. Maul kicks the Jedi's lightsaber into the pit and prepares to finish him off. After Obi-Wan calms himself, he uses the Force to leap out of the shaft and over Maul's head while summoning his fallen master's lightsaber to his hand. He lands behind the surprised Maul and cuts him in half; Maul's upper and lower body fall into the shaft.\n\nObi-Wan reaches Qui-Gon moments before he dies, as Qui-Gon instructs Obi-Wan to train Anakin to become a Jedi, reiterating that Anakin is the Chosen One. Obi-Wan gives his word that he will. Qui-Gon dies, leading to Obi-Wan to grieve for his deceased master. The newly elected Chancellor Palpatine arrives to congratulate Queen Amidala on her victory, as Nute Gunray is sent to stand trial for his crimes.\n\nLater, in a room in the queen's palace, Yoda confers upon Obi-Wan the rank of Jedi Knight. Kenobi argues with Yoda about his promise to Qui-Gon regarding Anakin's training. Yoda is convinced it is dangerous to train the boy, but tells Kenobi the Jedi Council has allowed Skywalker to become Kenobi's apprentice. Later that evening, in a temple in Theed, Qui-Gon's body is cremated, and Mace Windu and Yoda agree that the Sith are definitely to blame for the tragedy. As there are only ever two Sith at any given time (a Master and an apprentice), both Masters believe that one must still remain.\n\nThe Naboo and Gungans organize a great victory celebration on the streets of Theed, in front on the palace. Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker are present, the younger now wearing formal Jedi attire, and in his hair is a special braid: the mark of a Jedi Padawan. Palpatine meets Anakin personally assuring the kid that he will be watching his career with 'great interest'. The film ends with Queen Amidala presenting a gift of appreciation and friendship to Boss Nass and the Gungan people.\n\nDevelopment[]\n\nAlong the lines of The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, all three prequel films were originally intended to be written and shot as one large production, and released back to back.[4] The first draft of the script was begun November 1994.[5]\n\nThe role of director was offered to Steven Spielberg, Ron Howard, and Robert Zemeckis. According to Howard, Lucas didn't necessarily want to direct Episode I. He further commented that all three directors turned down the position as the film was Lucas's \"baby.\"[6] The budget of Menace was estimated $115 million. Shooting took place from June 26 to September 30, 1997. As with Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, Episode I's main exterior filming locations were in Tunisia. The podrace was filmed in a canyon near Sidi Bouhlel and Oung Jmel. A set was built near Oung Jmel to represent Mos Espa on Tatooine. The Slave Quarters Row were filmed in ksour's near Tataouine and Ksar Medenine. Small parts were filmed in Royal Caserta Palace in Italy and Whippendell Woods in the United Kingdom, but Hever Castle was later cut. Studio work was mainly done at Leavesden Studios in the United Kingdom.[7]\n\nUnlike the latter two films in the series which were shot on digital video, most of this film was shot in 35 mm, with a few scenes shot in digital video.[5]\n\nThis episode was also the first of the saga to be referred to primarily by its number (Episode One) by media and fans, in contrast to the original trilogy the public already knew.[source?]\n\nRelease[]\n\nThe Phantom Menace was the first Star Wars film in 16 years. As a result, there was almost unprecedented interest amongst both fans and the wider public in the revival of the franchise. The film received enormous media-created hype, which made Lucasfilm's $20 million advertising campaign—with the distinctive artwork of Star Wars series artist Drew Struzan gracing the movie poster and other advertising—seem modest and almost unnecessary. Few film studios released films during the same week as the release of The Phantom Menace; among the more courageous were DreamWorks and Universal Studios, with the releases of The Love Letter and Notting Hill respectively. The Love Letter was a box-office flop, whereas Notting Hill fared rather well and followed The Phantom Menace closely in second place.[8] Challenger, Grey & Christmas of Chicago, a work-issues consulting firm, estimated that 2.2 million full-time employees did not appear for work to attend the film, resulting in $293 million in lost productivity. The Wall Street Journal reported that such a large number of workers announced plans to view premiere screenings that many companies shut down on the premiere day.[9] Many fans began waiting outside cinema theaters as early as a month in advance of ticket sales.[10]\n\nMore theatre lines appeared when it was announced that cinemas were not allowed to sell tickets in advance until two weeks into the release. This was done out of fear that family theatre-goers would either be unable to receive tickets or would be forced to pay higher prices. Tickets were instead to be sold on a traditional first-come-first-serve basis.[11] However, after meetings with the National Association of Theatre Owners, Lucasfilm agreed to allow advance ticket sales on May 12, 1999, provided that there be a 12-ticket limit per customer.[12] As a result, however, some advance tickets were sold by \"scalpers\" as high as $100 apiece, which a distribution chief called \"horrible,\" stating it was exactly what they wanted to avoid.[13] Daily Variety reported that theatre owners received strict instructions from Lucasfilm that the film could only play in the cinema's largest auditorium for the first 8–12 weeks; no honor passes were allowed for the first eight weeks, and they were obligated to send their payments to distributor 20th Century Fox within seven days.[14] Servers at the film's official website became gridlocked soon after the release of the first teaser trailer,[15] and many fans of the series paid full admission to see Meet Joe Black only to leave after the trailer had run. The same tradition followed months later when the theatrical trailer was featured in front of Wing Commander.[16] The theatrical trailer caused even more notable media hype, because it not only premiered in theaters, but screened at the ShoWest Convention in Las Vegas, and was aired on television on Entertainment Tonight and Access Hollywood.[17] An unusual marketing scheme was pursued across the United Kingdom, where the teaser trailer was released on December 2, 1998 and then pulled from theaters six weeks later.[18]\n\nDespite worries about whether the film would be finished in time, two weeks prior to its debut Lucasfilm pushed the release date up from May 21 to May 19 of 1999. At the ShoWest Convention, Lucas stated that the change was to give the fans a \"head start\" by allowing them to view it over the week and allowing families the chance to view on the weekends. In a nod toward his future with digital technology, Lucas stated that the film would be released on four digital projectors on June 18, 1999.[19] Eleven charity premieres were staged across the United States on May 16, 1999; proceeds from the Los Angeles event were given to the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation with corporate packages available for $5,000–$25,000.[20] Other charity premieres included the Dallas premiere for Children's Medical Center, the Aubrey Fund for Pediatric Cancer Research at the Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York, the Big Brother/Sister Assn. of the Philadelphia premiere, and the Children's National Medical Centre in Washington D.C. A statement said that tickets were sold at $500 apiece and that certain sections were set aside for disadvantaged children.[21]\n\nMerchandise[]\n\nSoundtrack[]\n\nTwo separate soundtracks were released for The Phantom Menace. One, a traditional soundtrack, contained seventeen tracks of selections from the score. The second, an Ultimate Collector's Edition Soundtrack, compiled the score as it was presented in the film (with several minor alterations) in sixty-eight tracks.\n\nMajor musical themes and leitmotifs were introduced in the film, including the droid march, \"Duel of the Fates,\" Qui-Gon's Theme, \"The Adventures of Jar Jar,\" Darth Maul's Motif, Anakin's Theme, Shmi's motif, \"The Flag Parade,\" \"Escape from Naboo,\" and the \"Symponik Nabooalla.\"\n\nDuring the credits at the end of the film, young Anakin's theme is heard playing, but during the last moments of the film, this theme morphs into the first few notes of the Darth Vader theme during the Imperial March, and, as the last logos of THX are scrolling by, three rasping breaths from Vader's respirator can be heard, referencing Anakin's eventual change into Darth Vader.\n\nNovelization[]\n\nA novelization of the movie was written by Terry Brooks. It includes three entire chapters of material created by Brooks and unique to the novel. The first two chapters of the book concern Anakin's next-to-last podrace and its aftermath, while a later chapter describes an encounter between Anakin and a wounded Tusken Raider in the desert.\n\nBrooks met with Lucas before writing the book and received his approval and guidance, including information about developments to come in Episodes II and III. This can be seen in such passages as the Tusken Raider scene, which ironically foreshadows the death of Anakin's mother in Episode II, and the passage leading up to Anakin's fight with the Rodian child Greedo, indicating that Anakin's anger derives from his anguish at Padmé's impending departure (foreshadowing the plot of Episode III).\n\nThe novelization is especially well known for a passage describing the history of the Sith, including Darth Bane. According to Terry Brooks' memoir, Sometimes the Magic Works, Lucas spent an hour on the telephone with him discussing the history of the Jedi and the Sith. Therefore, the information on this subject provided in Brooks' novelization might derive from Lucas himself. The novelization is also the first mention of the Stark Hyperspace War.\n\nBrooks devotes an entire chapter of Sometimes the Magic Works to the writing of the Episode I novelization, which he claims to have been an extremely happy and fulfilling experience.\n\nHome video[]\n\nThe film was first released on VHS on April 4, 2000. There was a normal fullscreen release, and a widescreen collector's box set. The widescreen VHS contains an exclusive documentary titled \"Filmmaking Has Turned A Corner.\" In addition the collector's set contains an excerpted version of The Art of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace and a set of film cells from a scene in the film.\n\nStar Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace was the first Star Wars film to be officially released on DVD. This two-disc DVD was released on October 16, 2001.\n\nThe DVD features a commentary track by Lucas, producer Rick McCallum, editor Ben Burtt, animation director Rob Coleman, and visual effects supervisors John Knoll, Dennis Muren, and Scott Squires. It includes seven deleted scenes completed specifically for the DVD, and The Beginning: Making Episode I, an hour-long documentary film drawn from more than 600 hours of footage, including an insider's look at Lucasfilm and ILM during the production. The viewer can access a multi-angle storyboard-to-animatic-to-film segment featuring the submarine and podrace lap 1 sequences. The DVD includes two documentary sources, five featurettes exploring the storyline, design, costumes, visual effects, and fight sequences in the film, and an award-winning twelve-part web documentary series chronicling the production. The Duel of the Fates music video featuring John Williams was included on the DVD as well. The final special features included are a never-before-seen production photo gallery with a special caption feature, theatrical posters and print campaigns from around the world, a theatrical teaser and launch trailers, seven TV spots, Star Wars: Starfighter - The Making of a Game featurette from LucasArts, and a DVD-ROM weblink to exclusive Star Wars content.\n\nThe DVD became the fastest-selling DVD ever in the US, after 2.2 million copies were sold in its first week after release.[22] However, some reviewers criticized the DVD for the excessive use of edge enhancement that degraded the DVD's picture quality.[23]\n\nAt the DVD press conference for Revenge of the Sith, prequel trilogy animation director Rob Coleman confirmed that the animation department at Lucasfilm had replaced the Yoda puppet from the original version of the film with a digital Yoda. This was done to better match up the look of the Yoda from The Phantom Menace with that of the other two films of the prequel trilogy, as well as with the Yoda from the original trilogy. This change has been, for the most part, welcomed by fans, in contrast to the original puppet Yoda as seen in The Phantom Menace.\n\nA preview of these changes can be viewed on the Revenge of the Sith DVD that was released on November 1, 2005. The clip is included as part of \"The Chosen One\" featurette. However, when Coleman announced the change, he didn't specify when the revised version of The Phantom Menace would be released.[24]\n\nThe Phantom Menace was re-released along with Episodes II–VI on Blu-ray in September 2011.[25] For this release, the film went through a restoration process which restored the picture to its full frame (offering around 8% more picture than its DVD release). The Blu-ray release was also marked by the replacement of the puppet for the CGI model of Yoda used in Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, as well as a few corrections of visual effects and technical errors.\n\nOn April 7, 2015, the Walt Disney Studios, 20th Century Fox, and Lucasfilm jointly announced the digital releases of the six released Star Wars films. As Lucasfilm had retained digital distribution rights to Episodes I thru III and V thru VI, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment released The Phantom Menace for digital download on April 10, 2015.[26]\n\nDespite the Walt Disney Company's 2012 purchase of Lucasfilm Ltd. and the release rights to all future Star Wars films, Fox was to retain original distribution rights to Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope, which they co-produced and co-financed, in perpetuity in all media worldwide. Fox was also to retain theatrical, nontheatrical, and home video rights worldwide for the franchise's five subsequent films, which Lucasfilm produced and financed independently, through May 2020, at which time ownership was to transfer to Disney. This complex relationship between Fox and Disney, particularly in regards to Fox's perpetual rights to Episode IV, was to create an obstacle for any future boxed set comprising all nine films.[27] On December 14, 2017, The Walt Disney Company announced that it was acquiring most of Fox's parent company, 21st Century Fox, including the film studio and all distribution rights to A New Hope.[28] On March 20, 2019, the deal was officially completed.[29] On April 12, 2019, a Blu-ray box set containing the nine main instalments of the Star Wars saga remastered in 4K was reportedly announced to be in development for a 2020 release.[30]\n\n3D re-release[]\n\nOn September 28, 2010, StarWars.com and Lucasfilm announced that the entire Star Wars saga would be converted to stereoscopic 3D and re-released in theaters and IMAX 3D, beginning with Episode I. John Knoll and Industrial Light & Magic are supervising the conversion.[31] The stereo conversion process has been in the works for several years, however, with George Lucas showing tests of the Episode II speeder chase scene and a reel from Episode IV in 3D during 2005's ShoWest in Las Vegas, and the speeder chase scene was demoed again by Texas Instruments as an emerging technology at SIGGRAPH 2007 in San Diego.\n\nEpisode I's 3D release date, as announced by Lucasfilm on March 3, 2011, was February 10, 2012.\n\nOn January 28, 2013, Lucasfilm announced that the 3D releases of Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones and Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith were postponed.[33]\n\n25th anniversary re-release[]\n\nThe Phantom Menace received a theatrical re-release on the weekend of May 4, 2024, in commemoration of the film's 25th anniversary. This release also promoted the then upcoming series The Acolyte, set to be released on Disney+ in June 2024.[34]\n\nReception[]\n\nCritical and fan reaction ranged from high praise to outright derision. The much-hyped special effects, while generally viewed as groundbreaking in their sheer scope, were perhaps less impressive than anticipated simply because of high expectations. This attitude was confirmed with the rival film, The Matrix, winning the visual effects Academy Award for that year over The Phantom Menace. It was the first time a Star Wars film lost in that Oscar competition category. Many critics heavily criticized the acting of Natalie Portman and especially Jake Lloyd as the young Anakin Skywalker. Some aspects of the scripting and direction were also criticized. Extra venom was directed at the character of Jar Jar Binks, who was regarded by some fans as purely a merchandising opportunity rather than a serious character in the film. Fan reaction was mixed too, with some fans praising the film while others having a negative opinion of it.\n\nHowever, despite some of the negative criticisms leveled at the film, many others gave praise to The Phantom Menace. William Arnold, of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, commented that the massive of hype of the film may have caused much of the negative reaction to the film, saying \"it built expectations that can't possibly be matched and scuttled element of storytelling surprise.\" He also felt \"it's well made and entertaining\" and believed it was much better than similar box-office fare released around that time period, such as The Mummy and The Matrix.[36] David Cornelius of efilmcritic.com remarked that the better moments of the film \"don't merely balance out the weaker ones- they topple them.\"[37] Roger Ebert gave the film three and half out of four stars, calling it \"an astonishing achievement in imaginative filmmaking,\" and stating that \"Lucas tells a good story.\" Ebert comments that it was perfectly fine for the characters to be a bit less compelling, seeing that they were just being introduced, and stating to \"give me transparent underwater cities and vast hollow senatorial spheres any day.\"[38] Mark Dinning labels The Phantom Menace \"A great work from a great director, and a blockbuster of quite the most swashbuckling kind.\" Many fans and critics also agree that the lightsaber duel between Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan, and Darth Maul—showcasing astounding choreography and Ray Park's martial arts skills—is a high point, and one of the best lightsaber duels in the Star Wars saga.[39]\n\nThe film was nominated for three Academy Awards—Best Visual Effects, Best Sound, and Best Sound Effects; however, it lost to The Matrix in all three categories. The film won Best Motion Picture at the People's Choice Awards. It was also nominated for the Saturn Awards on the categories of Best Science Fiction Film, Best Director (George Lucas), Best Actor (Liam Neeson), Best Supporting Actor (Ewan McGregor), Best Young Actor (Jake Lloyd), Best Young Actress (Natalie Portman), Best Supporting Actress (Pernilla August), Best Screenplay (George Lucas), Best Music (John Williams), Best Special Effects and Best Makeup. It won on the categories of Best Costume Design (Trisha Biggar) and Best Special Effects.[40]\n\nDeleted scenes[]\n\nThe Waterfall Sequence—As Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan and Jar Jar arrive in the waterways of Theed, in the bongo, they surface just in front of a huge waterfall and have to vacate the vehicle in a hurry.\n\nDawn Before the Podrace—Anakin gets up early to prepare the pod for the race and has a brief chat with Padmé.\n\nComplete Podrace Grid Sequence—This scene shows more of the participating racers and creatures in the crowd, later added on DVD.\n\nExtended Podrace Lap Two—This lap shows some more of Sebulba's \"creative interpretation of the rules\" and further proof of just how special Anakin is, later added on DVD.\n\nAnakin's Scuffle With Greedo—This was due to follow the podrace, to show Anakin's potential for aggression, but George Lucas cut it because he wanted Anakin to be shown as a genuinely good character who turns evil later in adulthood.\n\nFarewell to Jira—This occurs as Qui-Gon and Anakin are leaving Mos Espa and Anakin stops briefly to say goodbye to Jira. One of Darth Maul's probe droids follows them for some time until Qui-Gon finally notices and destroys it before passing by the Dusty Duck.\n\nThe Air Taxi Sequence—The taxi ride shows us about ten more seconds of Coruscant, later added on DVD.\n\nMedia[]\n\nPoster gallery[]\n\nCredits[]\n\nAppearances[]\n\nSources[]\n\nNotes and references[]\n\n[]\n\nStar Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace on Wikipedia\n\nStar Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace on Box Office Mojo (archived from the original on June 30, 2020)\n\nStar Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace on Rotten Tomatoes (archived from the original on August 10, 2020)\n\nStar Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace on the Aurebesh Wiki\n\nStar Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace\n\nBooks Full adaptations\n\nNovel · Junior novelization · French junior novel · The Film Novel · Mighty Chronicles · Movie Storybook\n\n3D Storybook · Shakespeare · Little Golden Book · Epic Adventures\n\nBook-and-record · Read-Along Storybook and CD · The Prequel Trilogy Stories\n\nPartial adaptations\n\nJournal · Anakin Skywalker · Darth Maul · Queen Amidala\n\nEpisode I Adventures · 13: Danger on Naboo (Game Book) · 14: Podrace to Freedom (Game Book)\n\n15: The Final Battle (Game Book) Adventures: 11: Danger on Naboo (Game Book) · 12: Podrace to Freedom (Game Book)\n\nAnakin's Pit Droid · Anakin Skywalker · Anakin's Race for Freedom · Dangers of the Core · Darth Maul's Revenge\n\nDroid to the Rescue · Droids Everywhere! · General Jar Jar · Gungan Trouble! · Jar Jar Binks · Jar Jar's Mistake\n\nJedi Escape · Meet the Jedi High Council · Obi-Wan's Bongo Adventure · Podrace! · A Queen's Diary · Ready, Set, Podrace!\n\nSave Naboo! · Sith Attack · Watch Out, Jar Jar! · 5-Minute Star Wars Stories · 5-Minute Star Wars Stories Strike Back Comics Comic series: 1 · 2 · 3 · 4 · 1999 HC · 2016 HC\n\nAdventures: Obi-Wan Kenobi · Queen Amidala · Qui-Gon Jinn · Anakin Skywalker · ½ · Trade paperback\n\nManga: 1 · 2\n\nPhotoComic · The Prequel Trilogy – A Graphic Novel · Graphic Novel Adaptation Video games Battle for Naboo · The Gungan Frontier · Jedi Power Battles · Obi-Wan\n\nObi-Wan's Adventures · Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace video game\n\nRacer · Racer Arcade · Starfighter · Super Bombad Racing\n\nJourneys: The Phantom Menace · Journeys: Beginnings Activity books Battles to Color · Heroes and Villains Coloring Book · I Am a Droid · I Am a Jedi · I Am a Pilot · I Am a Queen\n\nGreat Big Flap Book · Micro-Vehicle Punch-Outs · Queen Amidala Paper Doll Book · The Ultimate Sticker Book Behind the scenes The Art of · Illustrated Screenplay · The Making of · The Official Souvenir Magazine · Script facsimile\n\nStar Wars Chronicles: The Prequels · Star Wars Storyboards: The Prequel Trilogy · A Visual Archive · Cinematic Classics Guide and reference books The Data File · The Gungan Frontier: Prima's Official Strategy Guide · Incredible Cross-Sections · Inside the Worlds of\n\nJedi Power Battles: Prima's Official Strategy Guide · Obi-Wan: Prima's Official Strategy Guide · Portfolio\n\nPrima's Official Strategy Guide · Racer Official Nintendo Player's Guide · Racer: Prima's Official Strategy Guide\n\nSecrets of the Sith · Scrapbook · Starfighter: Prima's Official Strategy Guide · The Complete Saga\n\nStar Wars in 100 Scenes · The Visual Dictionary (Expanded)\n\nWho's Who: A Pocket Guide to the Characters of · What's What · Collector Edition 2013 · Anniversary Special Other material and merchandise Star Wars Customizable Card Game: Coruscant Limited · Tatooine Limited · Theed Palace Limited\n\nTrading Card Game\n\nInsider's Guide · Soundtrack · Toy line\n\n[edit]\n\nStar Wars saga Prequels: The Phantom Menace · Attack of the Clones · Revenge of the Sith\n\nOriginals: A New Hope · The Empire Strikes Back · Return of the Jedi\n\nSequels: The Force Awakens · The Last Jedi · The Rise of Skywalker Spin-off films Canon: The Clone Wars · Rogue One · Solo · The Mandalorian and Grogu\n\nSharmeen Obaid-Chinoy · December 2026 · 2027 · James Mangold · Shawn Levy · Dave Filoni\n\nLando · A Droid Story · Taika Waititi · Rogue Squadron · Rian Johnson\n\nLegends: Holiday Special · Caravan of Courage · The Battle for Endor Live-action series The Mandalorian · The Book of Boba Fett · Obi-Wan Kenobi\n\nAndor · Ahsoka · The Acolyte · Skeleton Crew Animated series Canon: The Clone Wars · Rebels · Resistance · The Bad Batch\n\nTales · Young Jedi Adventures\n\nNon-Canon: Visions\n\nLegends: Droids · Ewoks · Clone Wars Animated micro-web series Forces of Destiny · Galaxy of Adventures · Galaxy of Creatures · Galactic Pals Other media Audio dramas · Books · Comics · Multimedia projects · Parodies\n\nRoleplaying games · Theme park attractions · Video games\n\n[edit]"
