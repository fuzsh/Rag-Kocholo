        "text": "Jessica Marie Alba was born on April 28, 1981, in Pomona, CA, to Catherine (Jensen) and Mark David Alba, who served in the US Air Force. Her father is of Mexican descent (including Spanish and Indigenous Mexican roots), and her mother has Danish, Welsh, English, and French ancestry. Her family moved to Biloxi, MS, when she was an infant. Three years later her father's career brought the family back to California, then to Del Rio, TX, before finally settling in Southern California when Jessica was nine. In love with the idea of becoming an actress from the age of five, she was 12 before she took her first acting class. Nine months later she was signed by an agent. She studied at the Atlantic Theatre Company with founders William H. Macy and David Mamet.\n\nA gifted young actress, Jessica has played a variety of roles ranging from light comedy to gritty drama since beginning her career. She made her feature film debut in 1993 in Hollywood Pictures' comedy Ferien total verrückt (1994). Originally hired for two weeks, she got her break when an actress in a principal role suddenly dropped out. Jessica cheerfully admits it wasn't her prodigious talent or charm that inspired the director to tap her to take over the part--it was her hair, which matched the original performer's. The two-week job stretched to two months, and Jessica ended the film with an impressive first credit. Two national TV commercials for Nintendo and J.C. Penney quickly followed before Jessica was featured in several independent films. She branched out into TV in 1994 with a recurring role in Nickelodeon's popular comedy series Was ist los mit Alex Mack? (1994). She played an insufferable young snob, devoted to making life miserable for the the title character, played by Larisa Oleynik. That same year, she won the role of \"Maya\" in Flipper (1995) and filmed the pilot for the series. She spent 1995 shooting the first season's episodes in Australia. An avid swimmer and PADI-certified SCUBA diver, Jessica was delighted to be doing a show that allowed her to play with dolphins. The show's success guaranteed it a second season, which she also starred in. Her involvement in the show lasted from 1995 to 1997.\n\nIn 1996 she appeared in Venus Rising (1995) as \"Young Eve.\" The next year she appeared on The Dini Petty Show (1989), a Canadian talk show, and spoke about her role in \"Flipper\" and her general acting career. She began working on P.U.N.K.S. (1998), featuring Randy Quaid, in 1998. In early 1998 she appeared in Brooklyn South (1997) as \"Melissa.\" That same year she was in two episodes of Beverly Hills, 90210 (1990) as \"Leanne\" and in two episodes of Love Boat: The Next Wave (1998).\n\nShe appeared in \"Teen Magazine\" in 1995 and various European magazines over the following years. More importantly, she was featured in the February 1999 issue of \"Vanity Fair\" magazine. She also had major roles in two movies that year: Ungeküsst (1999) and Die Killerhand (1999). In 2000 she had roles in Paranoid - 48 Stunden in seiner Gewalt (2000) and starred in the sci-fi TV series Dark Angel (2000), gaining worldwide recognition.\n\nHer first starring role in a major studio film was the Honey (2003), Universal Pictures' contemporary urban drama that grossed over $60 million worldwide. She has since made over 25 feature films that have earned a combined box-office total of over $800 million, including comedies and dramas, from gritty independents to major studio blockbusters. In 2005 she starred opposite Bruce Willis and an all-star cast in the provocative and critically acclaimed Sin City (2005), directed by Robert Rodriguez and Frank Miller. She next starred as Sue Storm--\"The Invisible Girl\"--in Marvel's action-franchise blockbuster Fantastic Four (2005), which was released by 20th Century-Fox in July 2005 and became a worldwide box-office success with over $300 million in revenue.\n\nJessica was part of Garry Marshall's all-star ensemble romantic comedy, Valentinstag (2010), which broke box-office records with the largest opening on a four-day President's Day weekend in history. She starred opposite Casey Affleck and Kate Hudson in director Michael Winterbottom's controversial screen adaptation of The Killer Inside Me (2010), based on Jim Thompson's novel, as well as Robert Rodriquez's Machete (2010). She co-starred in the third installment of the hit \"Meet the Parents\" franchise Meine Frau, unsere Kinder und ich (2010), as well as the 4D family adventure Spy Kids - Alle Zeit der Welt (2011), marking her third of five collaborations with Robert Rodriguez. Jessica was part of an all-star voice cast for The Weinstein Company's animated adventure, Nix wie weg - vom Planeten Erde (2012), also featuring Sarah Jessica Parker, Brendan Fraser and James Gandolfini.\n\nShe appeared in the comedy Scheidungsschaden inklusive (2013), which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and starred Adam Scott, Jane Lynch and Amy Poehler. She made a cameo appearance in Machete Kills (2013) and co-starred in Robert Rodriquez's highly-anticipated, star-studded sequel Sin City 2: A Dame to Kill For (2014). That year she had a full slate of acting projects, including the period drama Dear Eleanor (2016), The Englishman opposite Pierce Brosnan and Salma Hayek; the IFC parody mini-series The Spoils of Babylon (2014), produced by Funny or Die, with a stellar cast including Will Ferrell, Kristen Wiig, Tobey Maguire, Michael Sheen and Tim Robbins; and Stretch (2014), co-starring Patrick Wilson, Chris Pine, Ray Liotta, Ed Helms and Brooklyn Decker.\n\nJessica has received Golden Globe and People's Choice Award nominations, was voted TV Guide readers' Breakout Star of the Year, and won Favorite TV Actress at the 2001 Teen Choice Awards for \"Dark Angel.\" She won the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Award for Favorite Female Actress for her performance in \"Fantastic Four\" and an MTV Movie Award for Sexiest Performance in \"Sin City.\" She received another Teen Choice Award for Choice Movie Actress in a Horror/Thriller for The Eye (2008) and was honored by the Young Hollywood Awards as Superstar of Tomorrow in 2005. She has received ALMA Awards for her performances in \"Dark Angel\" and \"Machete,\" as well as a Fashion Icon in 2009.\n\nJensen Ross Ackles, better known as simply Jensen Ackles, was born on March 1, 1978, in Dallas, Texas, to Donna Joan (Shaffer) and actor Alan Ackles. He has English, German, and Scottish ancestry. Jensen grew up in Richardson, Texas, together with his older brother, Joshua, and a younger sister, Mackenzie. Jensen graduated from Dartmouth Elementary School in 1990, he graduated from Apollo Junior High School in 1993, and LV Berkner High School in 1996.\n\nJensen is a sports junkie. He loves football, lacrosse, baseball and basketball. He even played on the baseball and lacrosse teams in high school. The 6' 1\" actor first started modeling when he was just 2 years old. When he turned 4, he started appearing in TV commercials for Nabisco, RadioShack and Wal-Mart. He caught the acting bug because he was mostly influenced by his father, who was an actor in Dallas. He used to watch his father study scripts, and that taught him a few things about the industry. During his later years in high school, he started taking theater classes, where he claimed he was the only \"jock\" in that department. When he was just a sophomore, a friend of Jensen had asked him to attend a local acting seminar. Two guys, Craig Wargo, and an agent, 'Michael Einfeld', were interested in Jensen's talent and wanted him to go to Los Angeles with them.\n\nJensen had to say no to the offer and admitted at one point, he thought they would forget about him but, eventually, when he went to Los Angeles, he still managed to get help from them. Prior to that, Jensen actually planned to study sports medicine at Texas Tech University and become a physical therapist, before he decided to move to Los Angeles to give acting a try. In 1996, he managed to secure guest roles on several TV shows, which included Wishbone (1995), Mr. Rhodes (1996) and Sweet Valley High (1994). Jensen's big break came when he was cast in the NBC soap opera, Zeit der Sehnsucht (1965), as Eric Brady in 1997. He won a Soap Opera Digest Award for Best Male Newcomer in 1998, and was nominated three times in 1998, 1999, and 2000 for a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actor in a Drama Series for his work on Zeit der Sehnsucht (1965). After spending about three years on a soap set, he left Zeit der Sehnsucht (1965) and went on to appear in the mini-series Blond (2001), which was about the life of Marilyn Monroe, playing Eddie G. He also auditioned for the role of Clark Kent on Smallville (2001), but lost the part to Tom Welling, instead.\n\nNot giving up hope, he went for a few auditions and managed to secure a guest role on the popular James Cameron TV series, Dark Angel (2000), as serial killer Ben/X5-493, the brother of main character Max/X5-452, who was played by Jessica Alba. His character died in the episode, but Jensen eventually returned to the show as a regular in the second season as Ben's clone, Alec/X5-494 and continued on until the show's cancellation in 2002. In 2003, he joined the cast of Dawsons Creek (1998), playing the role of C.J., Jen Lindley's lover. He also filmed episodes of the TV series, Still Life (2003), playing the role of Max Morgan, not knowing that the series was actually dropped. He also had a small role in the short film, The Plight of Clownana (2004), playing the role of Jensen. That same year, he was offered the part of Eliza Dushku's love interest on the second season of Tru Calling: Schicksal reloaded! (2003). Jensen, however, turned down the role which was later offered to another actor, Eric Christian Olsen. He was subsequently cast on Smallville (2001), as Assistant football coach Jason Teague, the new love interest of Lana Lang. In 2005, Jensen managed to earn a lead role in the movie, Devour - Der schwarze Pfad (2005), playing the role of Jake Gray. Jensen also earned the opportunity to work his father, actor Alan Ackles, who happened to play his character's father, Paul Kilton. The movie, however, received mixed reviews from the public.\n\nThat same year, Jensen joined the cast of the CW series, Supernatural: Zur Hölle mit dem Bösen (2005), where he plays the role of Dean Winchester. Dean and his brother Sam, who is played by Jared Padalecki, are brothers who drive throughout the United States hunting paranormal predators, sometimes with their father, John Winchester, played by Jeffrey Dean Morgan. It was reported that the creator of the show, Eric Kripke, mentioned that the show will last for a maximum of five seasons. In 2006, Jensen took on a role in the Independently filmed comedy/drama movie, Ten Inch Hero (2007), which explores the theme of honesty and the flaw of judging by appearances. In 2007 the film began a limited run at number of film festivals including the Newport Beach Film Festival, Phoenix Film Festival and the Santa Cruz Film Festival but never made it into major mainstream theatrical release. In the Spring of 2008 Ten Inch Hero was released onto DVD exclusively through Blockbuster. Jensen however, received high praise for his work as Priestly, who one of the movie's more quirky characters.\n\nFrom June 5-10 in 2007 Jensen had his professional stage debut as Lt. Daniel Kaffee in \"A Few Good Men\" at Casa Manana Theatre in Fort Worth, Texas, working along side Lou Diamond Phillips. This proved to be another successful acting venture for Jensen, as critics were impressed with his work in this role. During his free time, Jensen enjoys golfing, horseback riding, scuba diving and photography. He is also a big fan of country music. His favorite musician is Garth Brooks. He even sang back-up vocals on good friend Steve Carlson's albums \"Spot in the Corner\" and \"Rollin' On.\" In the summer of 2008 Jensen traveled to Kittaning, PA to film the horror/thriller movie, My Bloody Valentine 3D (2009), which was filmed in the cutting edge Real D technology, Jensen played the lead role of Tom Hanniger and starred alongside Jaime King and Kerr Smith.\n\nJensen splits his time between Vancouver, British Columbia where he films Supernatural (2005) and his home in Austin, Texas.\n\nNew York Times Best Selling author of \"Confessions of A Prairie Bitch: How I Survived Nellie Oleson and Learned to Love Being Hated\", Alison Arngrim is best known to viewers world-wide for her portrayal of the incredibly nasty \"Nellie Oleson\" on the much loved, long running hit television series \"Little House On The Prairie,\" and continues to amuse audiences through her many film, television, stage and multi-media appearances.\n\nHer one woman show \"Confessions of a Prairie Bitch\", which started at Club Fez in New York in 2002, has now become a world-wide phenomenon, having been performed to packed houses in New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago, Philadelphia, Green Bay, San Francisco, Seattle, and in France, where Alison performs entirely in French to standing room only crowds in her all French version titled: \"Confessions d'une Garce de La Prairie\" and \"La Malle aux Tresors de Nellie Oleson.\"\n\nAs a stand-up comedian, Alison has headlined at nightclubs such as the Laugh Factory, the Comedy Store and the Improv in Los Angeles; as well as the Laurie Beechman Theatre in New York and assorted comedy venues all across the United States and Canada.\n\nShe is currently starring in two comedy series pilots: \"Life Interrupted\", as the ex-wife of commercial child star Mason Reese, with Erin Murphy, (\"Bewitched\") as her new wife and Dawn Wells, (\"Gilligan's Island), as her mother, as well as, \"C.P.R. - Child Performers Resurrection Talent Agency\", as an ex-child star gone wrong, trying to save herself and her assorted misfit cohorts by opening a talent agency.\n\nShe recently fulfilled a childhood dream to be in a horror movie, with her role as \"Leeza\", the somewhat ambivalent Satanic high priestess in the new supernatural web series \"The Mephisto Box\".\n\nAlison has mocked her status as an \"ex-child star\" on Jay Leno's Tonight Show, during their month long parody, \"Hollywood Survivor\" and continues to be a frequent interview subject on everything from \"A&E\", \"E! Entertainment\", \"TV Land\" and \"VH-1\", to CNN and the Travel Channel. The TV Land network honored her undying image as TV's worst bitch, by declaring her the winner of their 2006 award for, \"Character Most Desperately In Need Of A Time Out\".\n\nShe starred in the heartwarming, gay, Christmas cult classic, \"Make the Yuletide Gay\", as the overbearing \"Heather Mancuso\". Her other television and film appearances include, \"Livin' the Dream\", \"Tinder & Grinder\", \"The Bilderberg Club\", \"For the Love of May\" with Ru Paul and Patricia Neal, and \"The Last Place On Earth\" with Billy Dee Williams and Phyllis Diller. In 2007, she began her foray into French cinema with the role of \"Edith\" in the French detective comedy, Jean Pierre Mocky's \"Le Deal\".\n\nAlison's stage work includes, \"The Vagina Monologs\", \"Sirena: Queen of the Tango\", \"Dear Brutus\", \"The Wool Gatherer\", the French bedroom farce, \"In One Bed And Out The Other\", Michael Kearns' \"AIDS/US II\", \"Rita\" in the 2005 GLAAD Award nominated production of \"Last Summer At Bluefish Cove\", \", the somewhat off kilter \"Reverend Pat Miass\" in \"Joni and Gina's Wedding\", and the Ovation Award Nominated musical-drama, \"Flirting with Morty\", as the abusive, trashy and tragic Ray Lee.\n\nIn her spare time, she takes tourists on the rollicking comedy outing, \"Nasty Nellie's Tour of Hollywood\", (featured at Dearly Departed Tours), where she simultaneously enlightens and amuses passengers with behind the scenes tales from both Hollywood history and her own life.\n\nNever one to forget her \"Prairie\" roots, Alison enjoys making appearances several times a year at various \"Little House on the Prairie\" historical sites for educational events and gatherings of fans. She has been a frequent visitor to the Laura Ingalls Wilder Museum in the real life Walnut Grove, Minnesota as well as Green Bay, Wisconsin's Heritage Hills, Mumford's Genesee Country Village, Laura Ingalls Wilder Historic Home and Museum in Mansfield, Missouri and many, many others.\n\nAlison has a long history of activism. In 1986 when her friend and \"Little House husband\" co-star, Steve Tracy, passed away due to complications of HIV/AIDS, Alison immediately began volunteering at AIDS Project Los Angeles. Her duties ranged from working on the Southern California AIDS Hotline and the APLA food bank, (APLA's Necessities of Life Program,) to chairing the steering committee of the volunteer speakers bureau and developing \"Safer Sex\" workshops. She has provided AIDS education to doctors, nurses, prison inmates, service clubs, churches, department stores and schools, written AIDS education articles for the magazines \"Frontiers\" and \"Designers West\", and spent seven years hosting the APLA educational cable television show, \"AIDS Vision\". In 1992, Joel Wachs presented Alison with a resolution by the Los Angeles City Council commending her on her work on behalf of people living with HIV and AIDS.\n\nFrom 1989 through 1993 she served as Program Manager at Tuesday's Child, an organization assisting children and families affected by HIV and AIDS. From 1989 through 2003 she served as both hostess and producer for the comedy stage at the AIDS Project Los Angeles Annual Summer Party, (on the back-lot of Universal Studios), where through an evening of raucous entertainment, featuring name comedians, she helped to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for people living with HIV.\n\nShe currently serves as California Chair, National Spokesperson and Founding Board Member on the National Advisory Board of The National Association to Protect Children, or PROTECT.org, fighting to give children a legal and political voice in the war against child abuse. As an activist for the improvement of child protection laws, she has spoken before the California Senate and worked on legislative and political campaigns in several states, including Virginia and New York, in addition to PROTECT's work on federal legislation in Washington, D.C.\n\nShe has appeared on numerous television news programs discussing the legal and political issues surrounding child sexual abuse and exploitation. She came forward to tell the world about the sexual abuse she suffered in her own life, during her 2004 interview on Larry King Live.\n\nShe continues to be interviewed on this and other topics on Nancy Grace, CNN's Showbiz Tonight, The Insider, Court TV, and Bill O'Reilly's The Factor. Alison currently lives somewhere in the wilds of Tujunga with her husband of over twenty years, musician Bob Schoonover, (from the rock and roll band \"Catahoula\") and their evil cat, Clarice. She takes pride in the fact that so many people enjoyed hating her as a girl and is more than happy to give them the opportunity to do so in the future.\n\nCourteney Cox was born on June 15th, 1964 in Birmingham, Alabama, into an affluent Southern family. She is the daughter of Courteney (Bass) and Richard Lewis Cox (1930-2001), a businessman. She was the baby of the family with two older sisters (Virginia and Dottie) and an older brother, Richard, Jr. She was raised in an exclusive society town, Mountain Brook, Alabama. Courteney was the archetypal daddy's girl, and therefore was understandably devastated when, in 1974, her parents divorced, and her father moved to Florida.\n\nShe became a rebellious teen, and did not make things easy for her mother, and new stepfather, New York businessman Hunter Copeland. Now, she is great friends with both. She attended Mountain Brook High School, where she was a cheerleader, tennis player and swimmer. In her final year, she received her first taste of modeling. She appeared in an advert for the store, Parisians. Upon graduation, she left Alabama to study architecture and interior design at Mount Vernon College. After one year she dropped out to a pursue a modeling career in New York, after being signed by the prestigious Ford Modelling Agency. She appeared on the covers of teen magazines such as Tiger Beat and Little Miss, plus numerous romance novels. She then moved on to commercials for Maybeline, Noxema, New York Telephone Company and Tampax.\n\nWhile modeling, she attended acting classes, as her real dream and ambition was to be an actress. In 1984, she landed herself a small part in one episode of Jung und Leidenschaftlich - Wie das Leben so spielt (1956) as a young débutante named Bunny. Her first big break, however, was being cast by Brian De Palma in the Bruce Springsteen video \"Dancing in The Dark\". In 1985, she moved to LA to star alongside Dean Paul Martin in Die Spezialisten unterwegs (1985). It was a flop, but a few years later, she was chosen out of thousands of hopefuls to play Michael J. Fox's girlfriend, psychology major Lauren Miller in Familienbande (1982).\n\nIn 1989, Familienbande (1982) ended, and Cox went through a lean spell in her career, featuring in unmemorable movies such as Mr. Destiny (1990) with Michael Caine. Fortunes changed dramatically for Cox, when in 1994, she starred alongside Jim Carrey in the unexpected hit Ace Ventura - Ein tierischer Detektiv (1994), and a year later she was cast as Monica Geller on the hugely successful sitcom Friends (1994). It was this part that turned her into an international superstar and led to an American Comedy Award nomination. In 1996 Cox starred in Wes Craven's horror/comedy Scream - Schrei! (1996) . This movie grossed over $100 million at the box office, and won Cox rave reviews for her standout performance as the wickedly bitchy and smug TV reporter Gale Weathers. She went on to play this character again in each of the three sequels. Not only did her involvement in this movie lead to critical acclaim, but it also led to her meeting actor husband David Arquette. He played her on-screen love interest Dewey, and life imitated art as the two fell in love for real. Their wedding took place in San Francisco, at the historic Grace Cathedral atop Nob Hill, on June 12th, 1999. Joined by 200 guests, including Cox's film star friends Liam Neeson and Kevin Spacey, the happy couple finally became Mr. and Mrs. Arquette.\n\nMajandra Delfino rose to fame in her role as Maria DeLuca on Roswell. Born in Caracas, Venezuela to a Cuban mother and Venezuelan father, Majandra lived between Caracas and Miami before permanently moving to Los Angeles in her late teens.\n\nAt 4 years old Majandra's parents reached a fork in the road when they discovered she could read music from a beat-up Schubert book yet practiced multiplication drills with just a rudimentary understanding of math. Majandra's parents chose the scholastic side and enrolled her in an academically focused school. Still, between the ages of 4 to 13 Majandra danced with the Miami Ballet, with acceptance to the junior company by age 9, while studying classical piano throughout. Majandra's parents hoped this would be enough. Only, by age 11, Majandra and her best friend Alana Chirino (daughter of famed Cuban salsa singer Willy Chirino) snuck out of the house to be two of the four hundred girls auditioning for an all-girls pop group. They, along with Alana's sister Nicole and good friend Samantha Gibb (daughter of Bee Gees Maurice Gibb) ended up getting chosen - forming the music group 'China Dolls' a soul-styled pop group under the Sony label. After opening for the Bee Gees at a benefit concert and other local shows, the girls enjoyed small success, resulting in an audition for Columbia Pictures' The Baby-Sitters Club. Of the 800 plus cattle call of young girls, Majandra was among the few to get a callback. Fueled by this encouragement, Majandra decided to pursue an acting career in addition to her music responsibilities - again, doing so by sneaking out of the house. Dismayed by her daughter's latest \"non-academic\" aspiration, Majandra's parents gave her a 6-month deadline to succeed. Within 2 months she was cast as a lead in MGM's major motion picture Zeus & Roxanne - and within three months she landed the coveted role of Tony Dana's daughter on NBC straight to series multi-camera sitcom The Tony Danza Show. But it wasn't until Roswell's breakout success that Majandra rose to fan-magazine fame. Her role as the sarcastic Maria DeLuca has sparked many fans all around the world and its cult following continues to grow today. While on her second season of Roswell Majandra was cast as Vanessa in Steven Soderbergh's Traffic for which she won an Alma Award. Despite her successes as an actor, Majandra stayed true to her musical roots, releasing The Sicks and TARTE, two self-produced albums in which she wrote, performed, produced and engineered. Other notable credits include the Warner Bros feature Life As We Know It and the critically acclaimed drama Don't Come Knocking, directed by Wim Wenders. Starring in a string of comedies from State of Georgia where Majandra played the Laverne to Raven Simone's Shirley, then The Office spin-off The Farm, where Majandra played the third of the trio entrusted to run the family business, as Rainn Wilson and Thomas Middleditch's little sister, to CBS' multi-cam comedy Friends with Better Lives that found Majandra playing a pregnant wife and friend to Kevin Connolly, Brooklyn Decker and Zoe Lister-Jones, Delfino found herself back on the comedy side of things. Under a development deal for two self-scribed shows, Majandra Delfino continues to produce and create her own material, only this time for the screen and not just music. Delfino is married to actor David Walton with whom she has two small children, Cecilia Delphine and Louis Augustus. Majandra will next be seen in the directorial debut of Zoe Lister-Jones' self-scribed Sundance contender, Band-Aid. Rumors of a third album continue to abound but there has been no concrete word from Majandra or her representation yet.\n\nRobert Forster was born Robert Wallace Foster, Jr. in Rochester, New York, to Grace Dorothy (Montanarella) and Robert Wallace Foster, Sr., who worked as an elephant trainer and baking supply company executive. He was of English, Irish, and Italian descent. Forster first became interested in acting while attending Rochester's Madison High School, where he performed as a song-and-dance man in musical revues. After graduating in 1959, Forster attended Heidelberg College, Alfred University and the University of Rochester on football scholarships and continued to perform in student theatrical revues.\n\nAfter earning a BA in Psychology from Rochester in 1963, Forster took an apprenticeship at an East Rochester theater where he performed in such plays as \"West Side Story\". He moved to New York City in 1965, where his first big break came when he landed the lead in the two-character play \"Mrs. Dally Has a Lover\", opposite Arlene Francis. However, after the play ran its course work was hard to find in the theater. Forster returned to Rochester, where he worked as a substitute teacher and construction worker until an agent from 20th Century-Fox offered him a five-picture deal. His movie debut was a small part in the drama Spiegelbild im goldenen Auge (1967), which starred Elizabeth Taylor and Marlon Brando. Forster went on to appear in small and minor roles alongside some top Hollywood actors in films like Der große Schweiger (1968) and Medium Cool (1969), and a large part in Alexandria - Treibhaus der Sünde (1969). Although he continued to act in feature films, he took the part of a hard-boiled detective in the short-lived TV series Los Angeles 1937 (1971).\n\nForster also appeared in notable parts in Das schwarze Loch (1979), Avalanche (1978) and as the lead in the cult horror flick Der Horror-Alligator (1980), and played the part of a factory worker-turned-vigilante in the thriller Streetfighters (1982). Forster also took the lead as a taxi driver in The Hard Way (1985) by director Norbert Meisel. A series of action flicks followed, the most notable being Delta Force (1986), starring Chuck Norris. By the late 1980s Forster's acting career had begun to slide, and he was getting less and less work; if there was any, he would be cast in small parts playing villains. Forster then began to work as a motivational speaker and an acting coach in Hollywood film schools.\n\nHowever, in the mid-1990s, his career was resurrected by writer-director Quentin Tarantino, a big fan of Forster's early work, who offered him an audition for a part in his latest movie. After a seven-hour audition, Tarantino cast Forster as the tough but sympathetic bail bondsman Max Cherry in Jackie Brown (1997), which netted him an Academy Award nomination and a measure of recognition, both nationwide and within his own profession, landing him more high-profile roles in such films as Rage - Irrsinnige Gewalt (1999), Gus Van Sant's Psycho (1998)--a remake of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film--and Supernova (2000). Forster continued to act in many big-budget Hollywood productions for the next two decades.\n\nForster died on October 11, 2019, in Los Angeles, California, aged 78. His last film, El Camino: Ein Breaking Bad Film (2019), was released on the day of his death. He is survived by four children (Bobby, Elizabeth, Kate and Maeghen), four grandchildren (Tess, Liam, Jack and Olivia), and his long-time partner, Denise Grayson. Denise has been Robert's long-time partner and they had been together for 16 years till Robert passed away at home in Los Angeles surrounded by family."
