        "text": "A Massachusetts Senate president who has stepped aside due to allegations against a spouse. An acting president who has pledged to only stay for the duration of an investigation. And a former state senator indicted and arrested by the FBI on charges that include getting hundreds of pounds of free coffee without disclosure.\n\nThe Massachusetts state Senate is in uncharted territory, as Stan Rosenberg remains a senator while investigations are underway into alleged behavior by his husband Bryon Hefner. Harriette Chandler, Rosenberg's deputy, is in the chair as acting president. And their fellow Democrat and former colleague, Brian Joyce, is pleading not guilty to federal charges.\n\n\"I have never seen a situation where a spouse has had such an impact on the operations of the Senate,\" Thomas Birmingham, who once led the Senate himself, told MassLive. \"I've never seen anything that even approaches that.\"\n\nBut Rosenberg, D-Amherst, has survived, still a senator as Chandler serves as acting president. That's a \"victory\" for him, according to Birmingham, who served as Senate president for six years before leaving in 2002.\n\n\"He still has a chance to come back,\" Birmingham, now a senior fellow in education at the Pioneer Institute, said in a phone interview. \"But it is kind of a steep climb once you are out of the presidency to get it back.\"\n\nFour potential candidates are interested in replacing Rosenberg: Sens. Sal DiDomenico, of Everett; Linda Dorcena Forry, of Dorchester; Karen Spilka, of Ashland; and Eileen Donoghue, of Lowell.\n\nBirmingham said the longer the process plays out - the investigation and the jockeying - the more \"perilous\" the situation becomes for Rosenberg.\n\n\"I think he has a reservoir of goodwill because he has that respect and friendship. But that isn't infinite,\" said Birmingham, who served with Rosenberg in the Senate.\n\nThe Senate presidency is a powerful post: The head of the Senate is one member of the \"Big 3\" at the Massachusetts State House, playing a key role in statewide policy and politics. The other two figures are the governor and the House speaker.\n\nBirmingham said he has met Hefner, Rosenberg's husband, just in a social context and he doesn't know him well.\n\n\"It seems completely out of control if the allegations are true,\" Birmingham said, of allegations against Hefner.\n\nRosenberg and Hefner both expressed shock at the allegations when they were first reported in the Boston Globe. The newspaper reported four men accused Hefner of sexual misconduct, with three of them saying Hefner groped them and the fourth saying he was kissed against his will.\n\nThe news came days after Rosenberg, who ascended to the presidency in 2015, said he would seek a third term as Senate president.\n\nSeparately, MassLive reported that Hefner sent a picture of male genitalia to a state political player.\n\n\"I hope my name will be cleared and I don't want to say anything more beyond that,\" Rosenberg told the State House News Service last week.\n\nIn the meantime, the investigation and jockeying for the job continue.\n\nBut for now, Chandler serving as acting president gives Rosenberg \"some life and some room to maneuver,\" Birmingham said. \"I just wonder how long that will last.\""
