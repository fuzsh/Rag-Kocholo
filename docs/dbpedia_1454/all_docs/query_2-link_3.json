        "text": "stanman.JPG\n\nSen. Stanley C. Rosenberg is shown speaking at a press conference at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst in June. Rosenberg is set to become the next president of the Massachusetts Senate, most likely in January of 2015.\n\n(Diane Lederman/The Republican)\n\nBOSTON -- Leaders in Western Massachusetts are eager to see Sen. Stan Rosenberg take his seat as the next president of the Massachusetts Senate, saying his ascension will give the region new clout and influence on Beacon Hill.\n\nKnown as one of the top liberal voices on Beacon Hill, Rosenberg, 63, an Amherst Democrat, declared at the end of July that he has secured enough votes of his colleagues in the Senate to be elected by the 40-member chamber as the next Senate president when Senate President Therese Murray steps down. The transition is most likely to occur in January of 2015.\n\nIn a behind-the-scenes contest to succeed Murray as Senate president, Rosenberg, who is Senate majority leader, defeated Sen. Stephen Brewer, a Barre Democrat and chairman of the Senate Ways and Means Committee.\n\nFormer Senate Minority Leader Brian P. Lees, of East Longmeadow, said Rosenberg's expected election as the next Senate president is great for Western Massachusetts. It will give the region it's greatest influence over the state's $34 billion budget and over daily operations at the Statehouse since the days when Republican Jane M. Swift was acting governor in 2001 and 2002, Lees said.\n\n\"It's very, very important for us in Western Mass.,\" Lees said. \"I could not be more excited for Senator Rosenberg.\"\n\nIn an interview, Rosenberg, who first took office as a House member on Beacon Hill in 1987 and was elected to the Senate in 1991, said he did not want to discuss his possible priorities as Senate president.\n\nBut the in the past, he has championed education at all levels, including the flagship Amherst campus of the University of Massachusetts, arts and culture, the environment and recycling, social and economic justice and efforts to control global warming.\n\n\"I'll have to step up my game on things relating to economic develop and jobs,\" Rosenberg conceded.\n\nRobert Caret, president of the University of Massachusetts, said that Rosenberg offered strong support and optimism when the university's budget hung in balance during negotiations among leading legislators in June.\n\n\"It's always good to have someone you feel understands your issues,\" Caret said about Rosenberg's expected election as next Senate president.\n\nCaret also cited Rosenberg's extensive experience in the state Legislature and his ability to give the university access on Beacon Hill.\n\n\"We're very, very pleased from all of those perspectives and look forward to working with him,\" Caret said.\n\nRosenberg, a 1977 graduate of the UMass Amherst campus, was tested during the budget process, when the House approved $478.9 million for the university for the fiscal year starting July 1, while the Senate approved a lower amount, or $454.8 million.\n\nThe lower Senate amount for the university initially raised doubts about Rosenberg's influence over the budget process.\n\nBut Rosenberg kept pressing for the House's higher amount and in the end, he and others prevailed when the final compromise budget was approved at the House number for the university. That gave the university a 9 percent increase, or enough to freeze student fees and tuition for this academic year.\n\nRosenberg is recognized for being open and inclusive and a policy enthusiast. He received high praise when he was Senate chairman of redistricting and the Senate's point man for the state's 2011 casino law.\n\nOne indication of his popularity among colleagues occurred in 2003 when Rosenberg ran against Boston Sen. Robert E. Travaglini for Senate president. When Travaglini won, Travaglini created a new leadership position of Senate president pro tempore and appointed Rosenberg, his former adversary, to the post.\n\nRosenberg said his style as Senate president will evolve over time, but added, \"I don't think you can change your stripes as easily as your socks.\"\n\nBecause his elevation to Senate president is still about 16 months away, he said he did not want to speculate about his agenda, issues or process.\n\nRosenberg said Western Massachusetts has a very powerful and effective state legislative delegation, including members of the Senate and the state House of Representatives who serve as leaders and chairs of important committees.\n\nRosenberg said the more legislative leaders and power brokers in Western Massachusetts, the harder it is for eastern Massachusetts - which has more people and more votes - to ignore the interests of Western Massachusetts.\n\n\"It will give us a stronger role in setting the agenda and working with the governor and the speaker to achieve what we hope will advance the interests of the whole commonwealth including Western Mass.,\" Rosenberg said.\n\nSen. Benjamin B. Downing, a Pittsfield Democrat, said he did not want to make any predictions, but it can't do anything but help to have Rosenberg as Senate president.\n\n\"Stan will do a great job,\" Downing said. \"It's great news for Western Mass. He knows our issues. He knows our priorities. They will be heard in the leadership of the Senate.\"\n\nMary Clare Higgins, former mayor of Northampton and currently executive director of Community Action of the Franklin, Hampshire and North Quabbin Regions, an anti-poverty agency, said Rosenberg is \"extremely dedicated\" in helping people who need help from state government.\n\nAs Senate president, Rosenberg will help the entire state and in particular, Western Massachusetts, she said. \"Stan is very thoughtful,\" said Higgins, who worked with Rosenberg when she was mayor from 2000 to 2011. \"He has a real grasp of how state government needs to interact with local government and the private sector.\"\n\nRosenberg will become the first Western Massachusetts legislator to be chief of either chamber at the Statehouse since Maurice A. Donahue, of Holyoke, was Senate president from 1964 to 1970 and since David M. Bartley, a Holyoke Democrat served in the speaker's post from 1969 to 1975.\n\nHe would be the first openly gay person to lead either chamber in the state Legislature.\n\nRosenberg, who was raised in foster care, also has bounced back from a bout with a form of skin cancer. In 2011, he underwent radiation and chemotherapy and missed several months of work on Beacon Hill. Rosenberg said his health is \"excellent\" and all his checkups have been great."
