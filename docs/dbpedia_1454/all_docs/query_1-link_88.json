        "text": "The fountain of youth\n\nU.S. Rep. Richard E. Neal’s name is in the mix in talk about the chairmanship of the House Ways and Means Committee.\n\nU.S. Rep. Richard E. Neal’s name is in the mix in talk about the chairmanship of the House Ways and Means Committee. Among potential pluses for the former Springfield mayor: his age. Neal is 61.\n\nCharles B. Rangel, who just stepped down as chairman – at least temporarily – as he struggles with ethics woes, is 79. His temporary replacement, Pete Stark of California is 78.\n\nOf course, there are some who think 61 is too young.\n\nWatch your mouth\n\nRep. Ellen Story was smiling after receiving the appropriately named “Watch Your Mouth” award during a Statehouse event. The Amherst Democrat thought the award was apt for elected officials such as herself.\n\n“It can be taken in so many ways,” she said after picking up the award. “It’s good for politicians.”\n\nHealth Care for All, an advocacy group, and the Watch Your Mouth Coalition named Story and Sen. Steven Panagiotakos, D-Lowell, “oral health heroes” for their support and leadership in advocating for funding for dental care.\n\nEver try Tums?\n\nJoseph A. Santos, 55, who has served on the Ludlow School Committee for the past 12 years, commenting on his chances of re-election in the March 22 town election, said, “If I win, I win, ... if I lose, my wife, Maria, will be happy, I think.”\n\nSantos said he is running for re-election because, “I still have the fire in my belly.”\n\nHonest Abe at school\n\nContinuing her long tradition as dressing up for certain special occasions, Ware School Superintendent Mary-Elizabeth Beach had a top hat, beard and suit on in honor of the birthday of Abraham Lincoln on Feb. 12.\n\n“I’m 201 years old today,” Beach told a visitor to her office on that day.\n\nBeach, who has previously appeared as Captain Hook and the Cat in the Hat, visited the schools and the Senior Center in the outfit, with her only mishap being a section of beard that didn’t want to stick to her face.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nWild and crazy musicians\n\nSteve Martin calls Craig Eastman is \"a true genius on the fiddle.\"\n\nWild and crazy musicians\n\nFor the past year Northampton native and world-class fiddle player Craig Eastman has been touring the United States with comic and banjo-playing enthusiast Steve Martin. Yes. That Steve Martin.\n\nThe Steve Martin who was once a “wild and crazy guy.” The Steve Martin who co-hosted the Academy Awards. Who won a Grammy for his bluegrass album, “The Crow: New Songs for a Five-String Banjo.” The album Craig Eastman played fiddle on. The same Craig Eastman who will be playing with Bo Fitzgerald and The YankCelt Band this week all over the Pioneer Valley.\n\nMartin has said of his fiddle player: “Craig Eastman is a true genius on the fiddle and its cousins. It was a joy for me to have him play on my album. He’s an innovator and melodist on one of the great instruments.”\n\nThe band plays the Black Moon in Belchertown tonight; the Majestic in West Springfield Tuesday. On St. Patrick’s Day, the Hu Ke Lau in Chicopee hosts the band. Next Sunday, Parade Day, The YankCelt Band will make Irish music with an American accent at O’Driscoll’s in Wilbraham.\n\nA dogged city clerk\n\nChicopee City Cerk Keith W. Rattell, who is waging an aggressive campaign to ensure all the city’s estimated 5,000 dogs are licensed, got some good-natured ribbing at a recent City Council meeting.\n\nRattell attended the mayoral briefing prior to the City Council meeting because he had an order on the agenda for $4,000 to purchase 2010/2011 dog licenses and for associated costs.\n\nAs Mayor Michael D. Bissonnette read the order, he made a comment about the 700 scofflaws who have not licensed their dogs. Rattell said these dogs apparently don’t read the paper, referring to two recent stories in The Republican.\n\nWhen Rattell took office, only 1,758 dogs were licensed, and the city was losing approximately $32,400 worth of revenue annually from residents who didn’t license their dogs.\n\nWhen the mayor has his briefing, he sits in front of the Council Chambers in the seat Rattell occupies during the regular meeting. As Bissonnette was leaving the chambers after his briefing, Rattell went to take his seat as the regular meeting was set to begin. The mayor then quipped, “I feel like the opening act to Sinatra.”\n\nDon’t mess with the councilor\n\nHis face is not on a Wheaties box yet, but West Springfield Town Councilor Robert M. Mancini is the Celebrity Boxing Federation’s “Politician Champion.”\n\nMancini, a Democrat, won a unanimous decision in a boxing match against Kevin J. DeJoinville, an Agawam Republican, on March 6 at the Sturbridge Host Hotel & Conference Center in Sturbridge.\n\nThe bout was hyped as both a border battle and a political party slugfest.\n\nThe fight card included audience appearances by actress Lindsay Lohan’s father, Michael Lohan, and VH1 reality show star David “12-Pack” Amerman.\n\nThe nine-seat West Springfield Town Council almost had a quorum at ringside, as Mancini’s supporters included council colleagues Michael J. Finn, Brian J. Griffin and John R. Sweeney. State Rep. James T. Welch, D-West Springfield, also was present\n\nHigh school quiz show cloned\n\nIf imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, “As Schools Match Wits” has reason to be very proud. For nearly 50 years, Western Massachusetts high school students have gone head-to-head on “As Schools Match Wits.” The quiz show is produced by Westfield State College and WGBY-TV, Channel 57.\n\nIts success has inspired Boston’s WGBH-TV, Channel 2, to launch “High School Quiz Show,” which will premiere on March 28.\n\nSince “Wits” is the longest-running high school quiz show in the country, “High School Quiz Show’s” producers sent staff here to watch tapings of “Wits.” They have worked with Westfield State and WGBY to assure a good fit between the two programs since some crossover is expected and the new show will air locally.\n\n“In an age when network shows are being pulled off the air after one episode, the presence of another high school quiz show indicates this is genre that has a place and ‘As Schools Match Wits’ is doing something right,” said Elizabeth Preston, Westfield State College Dean of Faculty.\n\nChatting with Dave\n\nState Rep. Angelo J. Puppolo Jr., D-Springfield, has rubbed elbows with many VIPs during his time with the House of Representatives and previously as a city councilor in Springfield.\n\nBut he particularly enjoyed chatting it up recently with one of the biggest names in entertainment. No, not Oprah. No, not Angelina or Brad. Not even some celebrities that are seen now and then in Western Massachusetts, such as Bill Cosby and James Taylor. For Puppolo, it was a chance meeting with CBS-TV “Late Show” host David Letterman as both were skiing at Ski Butternut in Great Barrington.\n\n“We talked Massachusetts politics briefly and the recent special election,” Puppolo said, referring to the upset victory by U.S. Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass. So what were Puppolo’s thoughts about Letterman, who is engaged in a ratings war with returned “Tonight Show” host Jay Leno? “He was really nice and very pleasant to speak with,” Puppolo said. Apparently pleasant enough to pose for a quick photo with Angelo before skiing off.\n\nDon’t miss The Republican tomorrow for Cries & Whispers on Amanda Plante’s debut on the “Martha Stewart” show, corned beef and corny jokes at the annual St. Patrick’s party hosted by Donald E. Ashe, school closing in Wilbraham and other items too interesting to ignore. Reach us at cries@repub.com\n\n↧\n\nMaking it to Martha\n\nAmanda Plante, a graduate of Minnechaug Regional High School and the University of Massachusetts, was a featured model on the \"Martha Stewart\" show.\n\nAmanda Plante, a graduate of Minnechaug Regional High School in Wilbraham and the University of Massachusetts, was a featured model on ABC’s “Martha Stewart” show this month.\n\nPlante is a public relations executive in Manhattan, N.Y., for Laforce & Stevens.\n\nShe modeled spring fashions by Liz Lange, one of her clients, on the March 8 episode.\n\nShe is the daughter of Deborah Anderson, of Wilbraham, and Dan Plante, of East Longmeadow.\n\nSchool closing is tough\n\nM. Martin O’Shea, superintendent of the Hampden-Wilbraham Regional School District, said he is not relishing closing Memorial Elementary School in Wilbraham, although he sees some advantages to the proposed configuration where all fifth grades, for example, will be housed in one building.\n\nIf the school district offers an enriched program, all classes will benefit, he said.\n\nO’Shea added, “I didn’t get into teaching to close a school. I didn’t become a superintendent to close a school.”\n\nO’Shea said he wishes he could “roll out” his proposal to close Memorial School more slowly, but he said next year’s budget constraints do not allow that.\n\n“I will welcome questions and comments in the days ahead,” he said.\n\nCorned beef, corny jokes\n\nWednesday night was a busy and Irish-themed night for state Rep. Angelo J. Puppolo Jr. of Springfield. The representative attended the annual St. Patrick’s party hosted by Hampden County Register of Deeds Donald E. Ashe. There, corned beef sandwiches, were offered. Later, Puppolo was scheduled to go to an Elks’ dinner – corned beef and cabbage.\n\n“They’re mouth-watering,” Puppolo said of the sandwiches. He then added: “The Elks always has a good meal.”\n\nBut praise for corned beef coming from a man with the surname Puppolo? “I am O’Puppolo for the week,” the representative said.\n\nVision trumps budgets\n\nWestfield residents are apparently more interested in learning Mayor Daniel M. Knapik’s vision for the city’s future rather than help him draft its fiscal 2011 budget.\n\nMore than 30 residents crowded the Elizabeth Reed Room at the Athenaeum on March 3 to hear the mayor talk about public works projects, a new senior center and municipal services. That turnout was more than double the combined attendance at the first two of Knapik’s public budget workshops.\n\nThe Athenaeum forum offered a living-room style atmosphere, and Knapik spent more than an hour discussing what he sees as goals for the city.\n\nResidents were told the mayor plans to “find” $1.4 million annually during the next several years to earmark for road improvements. He also said he is committed to identifying a site for a new senior center this year and will seek City Council approval for funding its construction next year.\n\n↧\n\nFor $5 we'll give her directions\n\nWill the registry be setting up any of its new self-service kiosks in Western Mass?\n\nIs the registrar geographically challenged?\n\nThere might just be a reason why the Registry of Motor Vehicles is having problems with long lines at its branch in Springfield. Lines they thought they could control by that ill-fated $5 fee to speak to a human. It seems that Registrar Rachel Kaprielian doesn’t know where the boundaries of Western Massachusetts are.\n\nShe was being interviewed by Bo Sullivan on the Morning Show at WHYN-AM in Springfield recently when she was asked about the new self-serve kiosk the registry set up at the branch in Kaprielian’s hometown of Watertown.\n\nWill the registry be setting up any of those kiosks in Western Mass., Sullivan wanted to know.\n\nSure, Kaprielian replied, in a number of places like “Worcester, Wilmington, Plymouth ... and Worcester.”\n\n“Now Rachel,” Sullivan began to chide Kaprielian.\n\n“Worcester is in Western Mass., isn’t it?” she said.\n\nEventually, she said, such a kiosk will be set up in Springfield.\n\n“I can’t believe she said it,” Sullivan said to colleague Brad Shepard after Kaprielian had gone off the air.\n\n“The state does not end at Worcester,” Shepard added.\n\nSoccer and singing family tradition\n\nIrish eyes were smiling all around and it was a family affair at last week’s YankCelt concert at the social hall of St. Anthony’s Maronite Church on Island Pond Road.\n\nRobert Emmet “Bo” Fitzgerald, lead singer of the band, was in fine voice – and fine form wearing a custom-made soccer shirt given to him by his nephew, former Revolution soccer star Jay Heaps.\n\nSporting Heaps’ No. 6 jersey with the name “Fitzie” on the back, Fitzgerald, formerly of the Dustmen, wowed a crowd of 500 that spanned the generations – from newborns to senior citizens.\n\nThe recently retired Heaps, formerly of Longmeadow, was front and center with his family, including his dad, John Heaps, president of Florence Savings Bank. The elder Heaps and Fitzgerald were soccer teammates at Cathedral High School.\n\nFriendship floats along\n\nYears ago, Holyoke St. Patrick’s Parade float genius and designer of many first-prize winners, Dan Tierney, offered directions to Holyoke Community College students if any were interested in the art of decorating floats.\n\nThrough the years, many young men and women have learned much and treasured the friendship made with Dan and his wife, Marion.\n\nC & W knows thousands of people come from across the country to watch the Holyoke parade, but there is one person in particular who intrigues us: Holyoke Community College grad Don Delano.\n\nDelano, one of Tierney’s float decorating “pupils,” is now a successful businessman in Chicago. We hear he flies in every year a few days before the parade to work with Tierney, an occasion he says he wouldn’t miss for the world!\n\nNo hard feelings, now\n\nNow, there will certainly be more than a few New England Patriots fans attending this year’s St. Patrick’s Parade in Holyoke. To those fans: Remember, this year’s John F. Kennedy National Award recipient, Daniel M. Rooney, is the U.S. ambassador to Ireland. He is also a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Applause, please. Don’t hold it against him that he is also owner and chairman emeritus of the Pittsburgh Steelers, a six-time Super Bowl winner and a team Pats fans love to hate.\n\nPopulation like the tides\n\nHampden-Wilbraham Regional School Committee member William Bickley said the School Committee has closed and reopened schools in the past as population booms have moved through the school system.\n\nBoth the baby boomers and their children created waves of students which moved through the school system, Bickley – himself a baby boomer –said.\n\nThe baby boomers’ children have now largely graduated from high school, so the School Committee needs to close Memorial School to operate more efficiently, he argued.\n\n“We can take the school back, later,” Bickley said.\n\nPrincipal might need a pillow\n\nThat was Quarry Hill Community School Principal Neil G. Gile on Rollerblades at the school on March 10.\n\nGile explained that once a month, the Monson school hosts a Rollerblading and roller-skating event in the gymnasium for students and their parents. He said it’s an opportunity to work on building community, while providing entertainment at the same time.\n\nThe next one will be April 14 from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m.\n\nSo is Gile a pro on roller blades?\n\n“I am awful,” Gile said. “I’ve been known to take a tumble.” Gile, who said he’s brought his daughter to the event, said it gives him and Assistant Principal Jennifer C. Beaudry a chance “to be a kid with the kids.”\n\n↧\n\nSchool seeds the system\n\nAccording to Hampden-Wilbraham School Superintendent M. Martin O’Shea, the proposed closure of Memorial Elementary School is needed to avoid the loss of teaching positions.\n\nMarguerite Myers-Killeen, who is scheduled to retire next year as principal of Memorial Elementary School, said that if the Hampden-Wilbraham Regional School Committee makes a decision to close Memorial School next fall because of budget constraints and declining enrollment, then there will be “a little bit of Memorial in all the other schools,” according to School Superintendent M. Martin O’Shea. O’Shea said the move is needed -- otherwise, up to 22 teaching positions will have to be cut next year. If Memorial Elementary School is closed, 10 teaching positions will be cut, O’Shea said. He said the recommendation to close the school is not related to Myers-Killeen’s plans to retire.\n\nA Peter Pan wedding\n\nU.S. Sen. John F. Kerry took a hands on-approach to helping his daughter, Dr. Vanessa Bradford Kerry, plan her wedding last October in Boston, to the point where he even visited a Peter Pan Bus Lines depot to check out the buses that would ferry guests from ceremony to reception.\n\n“There were even chocolate chip cookies, so thank you for that,” Kerry said this week at a meeting of young business executives hosted, in part, by Peter Pan and its president Peter A. Picknelly. Kerry also took time out to tour a clean diesel Peter Pan bus.\n\nHow many fingers is that?\n\nMarch 10 was a special day for Kathy Cardinale, owner of Cardinale Design. It wasn’t just because of the opportunity to spend her morning producing artwork with preschoolers enrolled at Square One’s King Street Children’s Center in Springfield, but it just so happened to be her birthday!\n\nThe artwork Cardinale was helping the children create will be used in a children’s storybook which Square One will present to noted children’s author Irene Smalls during the organization’s upcoming spring tea on May 12 at the Colony Club.\n\nWhen the children asked how old Cardinale is, one young preschooler responded, “Oh, that’s a lot of fingers!”\n\nA man of letters\n\nSometimes, it takes a specialist.\n\n“Letter racks,” said Robert Davis, a New York City-based theater renovation consultant. “Racks for the marquee letters.”\n\nDavis was among the renovation specialists on a recent tour of the old Victory Theatre in Holyoke when he stepped down the stairs from the mezzanine lobby and detoured into a darkened side room. The small room had a grid of shelves into the spaces of which were stored letters to be hung on the sign outside.\n\nThe dust-caked beauty of a theater is in line for what its (overly?) optimistic owners say is a $27 million renovation with a reopening set for Dec. 30, 2012. The theater, which opened in 1919 and closed in 1979, was built like a piece of art with devotion to fine detail and interesting touches like the letter racks.\n\nSeparated at birth?\n\nSouth Hadley’s Department of Public Works Superintendent James M. Reidy has a sense of humor so big he even makes fun of himself.\n\nDuring a recent Selectboard meeting, his reach extended to Steven Reno, the town’s building commissioner. Reidy said they look alike to most people because they are both “short, chubby white guys, and that the two of them showed up at the meeting at the same time to let people know they are two different people.\n\n“You’d be amazed how often I am asked for a building permit,” Reidy said.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nCaught in the crowd\n\nU.S. Sen. Scott Brown made a point to shake as many hands and speak to as many people as he could.\n\nWhen East Longmeadow Selectman Jack Villamaino arrived to march in the Holyoke St. Patrick’s Parade, he was caught up in the wake of his friend, newly elected U.S. Sen. Scott Brown.\n\n“It was unusual; Scott had this ring of people surrounding him wherever he went. When he pulled me aside to talk for a minute, this ring of supporters followed right along. It was like he had his own gravitational pull.” Villamaino added that Brown made a point to shake as many hands and speak to as many people as he could.\n\n“At first, people acted as if he was unapproachable because of his newfound status, but he’s a regular guy. To himself, Scott’s still pretty much a selectman from Wrentham, and he doesn’t see what all the fuss is about.”\n\nNew kind of American idol\n\nThere are some members of the Holyoke City Council who should stop eating before reading this:\n\nPolice Chief Anthony R. Scott is a finalist in the “America’s Most Wanted” television show’s All-Star First Responder contest. And Scott, who courts headlines with almost as much gusto as he fights what he likes to call “dirt-bags” and other criminals, is unabashedly asking for votes.\n\n“I am proud that my efforts in the city of Holyoke have been recognized nationally and I am honored to be nominated to participate in this program. I hope that the citizens of Massachusetts support me by voting online,” Scott said on Tuesday.\n\nScott has battled with city councilors over funding, grant and deployment issues, even bringing his personal lawyer to advise him at council meetings.\n\nAccording to the “America’s Most Wanted” Web site – amw.com, where voting can be done – the voting period starts at midnight on April 15 and ends at 11:59 p.m. on May 3.\n\nFirst prize includes $10,000, two tickets to the NASCAR SPRINT Cup Series All-Star Challenge sometime in May in Charlotte, N.C., round-trip coach airfare for two, hotel accommodations and transportation.\n\nNot everyone agrees\n\nWhile school administrators in Ludlow and Wilbraham say that doing away with neighborhood schools is educationally sound, a Wilbraham parent said that parents in Ludlow don’t like the new arrangement and parents in Wilbraham won’t either.\n\nTo even out class size and reduce costs, administrators in both communities say they favor placing all students in a single grade in one building and having the students change buildings every two years.\n\nLinda Peters, who has three children at Memorial School in Wilbraham, which is slated to be closed next year, said, “Two-year schools are more like factories, pushing students from one grade to the next.\n\n“Ludlow parents don’t like the system and Wilbraham parents won’t like it either,” she predicted.\n\nThe fact that the incumbent school committee folks in Ludlow were voted out of office last week might back her argument.\n\nWhat about Barney and Betty?\n\nThe things one learns at middle school science fairs.\n\nQuick! Who was the first television “couple” to be depicted sharing the same bed?\n\nWilliam Z. Nardi, a seventh-grader at Van Sickle Middle School in Springfield, revealed that surprising factoid in his prize-winning project in which he scientifically determined that some commercials are louder and brighter than the programming that they interrupt.\n\nIn a write-up accompanying his findings, Nardi touched on various aspects of television and its advertising. Included is his discovery that Fred and Wilma of “The Flintstones” fame were the first-ever television couple shown to be sharing the same bed.\n\nYabba-dabba-doo indeed...\n\nWedding and election season\n\nAgawam Town Clerk Richard M. Theroux’s decision about whether to run for the state Legislature is competing for attention with an impending state of marriage. Theroux, a former Agawam city councilor, is among those who have been pondering runs for the 3rd Hampden District House seat and the Hampden District Senate seat.\n\nThe posts currently are held, respectively, by state Rep. Rosemary Sandlin, D-Agawam, and state Sen. Stephen J. Buoniconti, D-West Springfield. Theroux, who noted that he wants his family to be part of any political planning, said that there are only two topics lately in his household.\n\n“My daughter’s wedding and whether I should run for the Legislature,” he said.\n\nC&W reminds the town clerk that nominating signatures for legislative candidates are due by 5 p.m. on April 27. We hope that if he decides to run, he makes it to the church, er, office on time.\n\nWorse than a hanging chad\n\nTalk about looking out for your opponent. At a recent Ware Board of Selectmen meeting, Gerald L. Matta, who is challenging incumbent Selectman Richard A. Norton in the April 12 election, sat quietly through most of the short meeting.\n\nBut toward the end of the meeting, Matta asked to speak.\n\n“Both (Town Manager) Mary (Tzambazakis) and I noticed the danger over Richard’s head,” Matta said, pointing up.\n\nAll eyes went to the ceiling where a ceiling tile could be seen dangling above Norton’s head.\n\n“I want you in the race with me,” Matta said.\n\n“It’s gotten worse since we last looked at it,” Tzambazakis said.\n\nMayor all wrapped up\n\nThis year’s president of the Holyoke St. Patrick’s Parade Committee presented Mayor Elaine A. Pluta with a scarf before a recent City Council meeting. But not just any scarf.\n\nPluta, a former 14-year councilor who became mayor on Jan. 4, received the Parade Committee’s official tartan scarf. City Councilor James M. Leahy, the parade committee president, explained the meaning of the colors used in the handsome wrap:\n\nRed, white and blue for the American flag.\n\nGreen, white and gold from the Irish flag and the flag of the Parade Committee.\n\nGreen and white from Holyoke Community College.\n\nPurple and white from Holyoke High School.\n\nGreen and gold from Holyoke Catholic High School.\n\nBlack and gold from Dean Vocational High School.\n\nPluta said she had planned on buying one of the scarves.\n\n“Now I don’t have to,” she said.\n\nGood thing, because they aren’t cheap: They go for $55.\n\nDon’t miss The Republican tomorrow for Cries & Whispers on a win-win situation in Ludlow, a Red Cross ask-and-you-shall-receive moment, a quiet exit for a Springfield assistant district attorney, and other items too interesting to ignore.

The new members are Charles T. Mullin and Michael J. Kelliher.\n\n“Welcome to being part of the problem,” Harrington said. “As soon as you win, you’re part of the problem.”\n\nHarrington said he intends to stay on the School Committee “as long as the voters let me stay\n\nAsk and you shall receive\n\nIt works, says the Pioneer Valley Chapter of the American Red Cross.\n\nIt was a simple “ask” from Red Cross disaster staff member Paula Wilke, of East Longmeadow, who asked Kevin Hinkamper, of Hampden, owner of VanPool in Wilbraham, if he would consider donating a used vehicle to help with the chapter’s disaster response efforts in Hampden, Hampshire and Franklin counties.\n\nHinkamper not only said yes, but then had the recently retired mini-bus refurbished, painted and decaled with the help of the Pease family who own 1812 Paint and Body in Northampton. The vehicle make-over was donated by the Peases in memory of their son, Todd Pease, who died in 1991.\n\nThe addition to the fleet means the chapter now has an emergency response vehicle stationed in each of its three counties, according to Mary Nathan, director of disaster services. The new one will be used primarily in Hampshire County to transport volunteers to meetings and trainings, and to haul cots, blankets and other relief items and gear.\n\nA quiet exit\n\nLongtime Assistant District Attorney Corinne A. Rock quietly slipped into retirement recently. Rock, never one to seek publicity and certainly not looking old enough to retire, used the old trick of telling many people her last day was March 17, when it was actually two days earlier.\n\nA few confidants who knew the truth managed some balloons and a small celebration in a room adjacent to Courtroom One in District Court, where Rock has handled arraignments and other matters for the Hampden District Attorney’s Office for years.\n\nA self-made deselection\n\nIf there was any doubt that Gerald S. Weiss was vacating his post as Amherst Select Board member, one needed only to glance at his T-shirt.\n\nMade by his son’s girlfriend, the shirt had two words, “selectman” and “deselectman” with an arrow highlighting the latter. Weiss wore his shirt to a reception held in his honor before his final meeting March 15. The annual Town Election was held March 23 and he did not seek re-election.\n\nMadness in Springfield\n\nAs occurs annually, there is talk from coast to coast now about the March Madness of NCAA basketball. There are men’s and women’s Division I titles to be decided, and this year Indianapolis and San Antonio are the sites for the Final Four. The men will play in Indiana, the women in Texas. Next year, the men’s Final Four will be in Houston and the women will play in Indianapolis.\n\nWell, this past week brought the Elight Eight of Division II men’s hoops to Springfield for a fifth consecutive year. And 2011 will, again, bring the Elite Eight to the birthplace of hoops. A nice run for Pioneer Valley residents.\n\n↧\n\n'Diamond' shines on Hungry Hill\n\nWillie Nile debuted “Hungry Hill,” a song he wrote in memory Springfield's John T. “The Diamond” Shea.\n\nRepublican columnist Tommy Shea has been a fan of rock’n’roller Willie Nile for 30 years, going back to the release of the Buffalo, N.Y., native’s first album in 1980.\n\nThey’ve become friends over the years, with Nile playing “house concerts” several years ago at the home that Shea shares with his wife, novelist Suzanne Strempek Shea, in the Bondsville section of Palmer.\n\nYou might think nothing could top the night that Nile, who now calls Greenwich Village home, invited Shea to join him on stage at the Iron Horse in Northampton last year to sing a cover of the Ramones’ punk anthem, “I Wanna Be Sedated.”\n\nIf so, you would be wrong.\n\nPlaying before a full house on March 27 at the Iron Horse, Nile debuted a song he wrote, “Hungry Hill,” in memory of Shea’s father, John T. “The Diamond” Shea, a native of Ireland and longtime resident of the Springfield neighborhood known as Hungry Hill who passed away at age 85 on Jan. 24.\n\n“I knew he had written a song – he had sent the lyrics – but I didn’t know he was going to play it,” Shea said later.\n\nThe performance can be viewed at www.masslive.com/videos\n\nShea’s reaction to the song? “I’m glad it was dark where I was sitting,” he said.\n\nIt doesn’t get any better\n\nChicopee City Engineer Steven J. Frederick recently told The Republican about an unprecedented 11 significant road, sewer, paving, streetscape, canal path and water main construction projects set to kick off shortly.\n\nSome are new and others are continuing during the 2010 construction season.\n\nFrederick said, “Although these projects will strain the combined staffs from Engineering, Wastewater and DPW, we are excited to take on the challenge. Personally, for me as a civil engineer, it is additionally exciting.”\n\nHe said, “I recall sitting in the computer lab in college and seeing a poster of a bridge and the caption, “Civil Engineers – They build the quality of life.”\n\nFrederick saw the poster at the University of Massachusetts in Dartmouth.\n\n“And with these 11 projects under way there is no doubt that we are improving the quality of life in Chicopee. It has been a team effort to get the projects ready and pushed through the funding door.”\n\nRemember when?\n\nIt looks like the April 8 dinner and fund-raiser for Holyoke’s Friends of the Council on Aging will be filled with a lot of laughs – and a few recipes from the files of the “old” Log Cabin’s consummate hostess, Edna Williams.\n\nThe emcee for the reunion of guests and staff will be attorney John J. Driscoll, who worked there parking cars and as a busboy and bartender back in the day.\n\nAnother speaker will be Frank MacAvin, who for years was the general manager of the landmark Holyoke restaurant on the shoulder of Mount Tom that’s since been transformed to today’s Log Cabin Banquet & Meeting House.\n\nWhen the two met at a recent meeting, C & W is told that MacAvin said to Driscoll, “John, you’ve come far since I fired you.” It prompted the chairperson, Marion Tierney, to ask if anyone else in the room had ever been fired.\n\nMacAvin’s wife Judy responded, “He fired me, and I went to work elsewhere.\n\nBut, then he asked me to come back, and so I did and now we’re married.”\n\nWe hear today’s owner, Peter C. Rosskothen, is paying his typical attention to detail for the event, including things like Williams’ famed popovers and pecan pie on the menu.\n\nThe best part may well be the fact that the “Log Cabin Reunion Celebrating the Edna Williams Years” is open to all.\n\nA real balancing act\n\nAt the Women’s Fund of Western Massachusetts’ kickoff celebration for its Leadership Institute for Political Impact in Holyoke on March 27, veteran politicians state Rep. Cheryl A. Coakley-Rivera, D-Springfield, and Ann L. Hamilton, president of the Franklin County Chamber of Commerce, used a little humor to get their messages across.\n\nThey were asked, “How do you balance work and family?” Coakley-Rivera quipped, “I have a dog.” Hamilton said when her children were young she would come home so often with a name tag on that she would joke that they “wouldn’t forget who I was.”\n\nAsked what the biggest surprises they had were, Coakley-Rivera replied, “The friends you thought you had.” Coakley-Rivera said friends could sometimes be the most jealous or envious, and it was the people she didn’t know as well who were the most supportive.\n\nCoakley-Rivera said she avoided “going negative,” and that has helped her in the long run, although she joked that she has tendency to want to respond, being “Puerto Rican and Irish,” which prompted laughter from the audience.\n\nMaria L. Salgado, of Holyoke, called Coakley-Rivera the “epitome of health to Latino women; you look great.” Coakley-Rivera revealed that while she has always struggled with her weight, she has lost 55 pounds.\n\nLunch on the mayor\n\nAgawam Mayor Richard A. Cohen pledged to be cautious with taxpayers’ money when voters returned him to office in 2009. But apparently that didn’t mean being stingy with his own paycheck.\n\nOn March 31, Cohen took Agawam’s 2010 Colleen Brianna M. Newton and her court – Shannon E. Foley, Elizabeth A. Gloster, Kyleigh K. Oliveira and Jenna L. Roy – to lunch at Storrowton Tavern in West Springfield. The mayor issued municipal citations to the young ladies for their achievements.\n\nCohen also inserted some levity into the March 23 meeting of the School Committee, where he serves as chairman, and Newton, a senior at Agawam High School, is student representative. A total of 29 students, from grades three through eight, were saluted for “perfect” scores on the MCAS tests in either mathematics or English language arts.\n\nMath teacher Nancy M. Farrell said that the 29 students were an increase of 93 percent above the 15, who had perfect scores in 2009. Superintendent Mary A. Czajkowski asked them to step forward to receive recognition certificates, noting that shaking hands with a lineup, including herself, Cohen, Newton and the School Committee, would be good practice for their future high school graduations.\n\n“I think we should just award them all their doctorates,” Cohen quipped.\n\nWhere was Petro?\n\nDuring a recent campaign stop at the Metaus Restaurant in Ludlow hosted by the town Democratic Committee, Gov. Deval L. Patrick received largely a warm welcome – except from Ludlow’s signature Dem, state Rep. Thomas Petrolati.\n\nThe speaker pro tempore was notably absent from the event. State Sen. Gale D. Candaras, D-Wilbraham, introduced Patrick at the event instead.\n\nIt’s no secret the governor hasn’t exactly had a warm and fuzzy relationship with House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo, and even less so with former Speaker Salvatore DiMasi, who resiged last year and is now under indictment.\n\nWhen asked why he thought “Petro” was a no-show, Patrick quipped: “ I dunno? School vacation, maybe?”\n\nDon’t miss The Republican tomorrow for Cries & Whispers on an 11-year-old runner up in East Longmeadow, thoughts of Corvettes past in West Springfield, U.S. Sen.

Gibson took a witty walk down memory lane when called upon to speak at the grand opening on March 25 of Balise Honda’s new facility at 400 Riverdale St.\n\nHe said that he was no stranger to Balise operations, having bought his second car, a 1979 Chevrolet Corvette, at a former Balise Chevrolet location around 1981.\n\nGibson, who was in his mid-20s and an Agawam resident at the time, said that he was fortunate to have had his older brother, Charles R. Gibson, of Longmeadow, with him. The Corvette had a standard transmission.\n\n“My brother had to drive the car off the lot,” the mayor noted. “I couldn’t drive a standard. I learned on that ¤’Vette.”\n\nTake a seat\n\nThere is, for those who want to get a little more comfortable, the chance to get what is being described as a custom seat cushion. A donation of $20 will fetch a white seat cushion. “The People’s Seat” and “January 19, 2010” are printed on the cushion – a reminder of U.S. Sen. Scott Brown and his win to take the late Edward M. Kennedy’s seat.\n\nBrown keeps on truckin’\n\nU.S. Sen. Scott P. Brown is still getting mileage, literally, out of his dark green GMC pickup. He made the truck famous during his campaign and took it to Washington with him where the four-wheel drive came in handy during a string of February snowstorms that paralyzed the Capital.\n\n“I was powering through snowdrifts,” Brown said during a visit to Dielectrics, a medical-device manufacturer in Chicopee.\n\nNot a health-care issue\n\nDonald F. Pion, owner of Bob Pion Buick-GMC in Chicopee had to calm surprise last week as an ambulance pulled into the car lot as he talked with reporters.\n\n“We fix them,” Pion said. “Nothing’s the matter.”\n\nPion then had a news conference with U.S. Rep. Richard E. Neal, D-Springfield announcing that General Motors had re-instated the dealership. GM had planned to close it.\n\nHave an item to share?

The soldiers asked for the newspapers as a way of keeping up-to-date with what’s happening on the homefront.\n\n“The papers (are) shared with all the soldiers on his base,” she said.\n\nPitching wine for good causes\n\nJosh Beckett and Jacoby Ellsbury are the latest Boston Red Sox stars on the hunt for help for their charities through the promotion of wines bearing their likenesses.\n\nChardon-K, Beckett’s signature brew, and ZinfandEllsbury will debut in May at a special reception at the House of Blues on Lansdowne Street in Boston.\n\nBoth are California wines, a 2009 Chardonnay and a 2006 red Zinfandel.\n\nPreviously, Longball Cellars has served up Tim Wakefield‘s CaberKnuckle, Curt Schilling‘s Schilling Schardonnay, Captain’s Cabernet (for team captain Jason Varitek), Kevin Youkilis’ SavignYoouuk Blanc and David Ortiz‘s Vintage Papi, all of which benefited each player’s respective charity.\n\n(And, yes, for all you non-Sox fans who live in Red Sox Nation, there are wines featuring stars of other teams on the market; you can check out www.charitywines.com.\n\nBeckett’s wine will benefit the Josh Beckett Foundation, while Ellsbury’s will benefit the Navajo Relief Fund, Project Bread and the Ellsbury-Read Project.\n\nThey’ll soon be available at retailers and restaurants across Massachusetts and New England.\n\nPaige Turco in TV film\n\nSpringfield’s Paige Turco stars in an upcoming made-for-TV movie that two advertising giants hope will bring family entertainment back to network television.\n\nProcter & Gamble and retail giant Wal-Mart are jointly creating “Secrets of the Mountain” for NBC in an effort to promote “family-friendly” alternatives to what they see as increasingly risqué TV fare.\n\nThe movie, which airs on April 16, focuses on Dana James, a single mother played by Turco, who brings her family to a mountainside cabin. The film co-stars Barry Bostwick and Shawn Christian. Ads for both companies will run during commercial breaks, and the film will include product placements for both.\n\nThe network could opt to turn “Secrets of the Mountain” into a weekly series. Turco has previously starred in “The Agency.”\n\nMake ‘em sweat for the finale\n\nVisitors at an April 6 East Longmeadow School Committee meeting were ready to overthrow the board when they couldn’t get a straight answer on who the board would hire as the new superintendent of schools. Principals from the district’s five schools along with other residents who followed the search committee and interview process for more than a month waited anxiously while School Committee members praised all three finalists and said they were all qualified for the position.\n\nThen School Committee member Angela Thorpe suggested that visitors wait a little longer for the results.\n\n“I make a motion that we wait to vote on this tomorrow night,” she said. Audience members gasped, but Thorpe quickly relieved visitors when she said she was just kidding.\n\nThe board then asked East Longmeadow High School Principal Richard L. Freccero to post the names and votes for each person on a large sheet on the wall.\n\n“I’m playing Vanna White tonight,” he said.\n\nThe board voted unanimously for Gordon C. Smith, principal of Ludlow High School, who will begin his new job July 1.\n\nLet’s twist again ...\n\nFor Michael S. Dvorchak and his wife, Barbara, who admitted they are “Disney freaks,” their latest and 28th trip to Disney World in Orlando, Fla., was another chance to dance ... this time with the famous Chubby Checker, who introduced “The Twist” to the world.\n\nA few months ago, the couple was at the International Flower and Garden Festival at Epcot Center and attended an event with 8,000 people all doing the twist.\n\n“He saw me doing it and brought me up the center aisle and we were dancing together,” he said, noting he and his wife are accomplished Polka dancers.\n\n“We love going there. We feel like kids,” he said, adding they took a photo with Goofy, Mickey and Minnie.\n\nIn late 2008, Dvorchak grabbed Daisy and started to tango. A Disney official took notice and the next thing the retired Chicopee couple knew they were named grand marshals of that day’s “Disney Dreams Come True Parade.” The couple is already looking forward to their next trip.\n\n↧\n\nMaster and dog retire\n\nJoining the retiring Kent Friberg will be Dakota, his accelerant-sniffing yellow lab.\n\nCan you teach an old fire dog new tricks? Retiring Springfield Arson & Bomb Squad investigator Kent J. Friberg certainly hopes so.\n\nFriberg is retiring after 38 years of service to the department. Joining him will be Dakota, his accelerant-sniffing yellow lab, who has put in 13 years of his own sniffing out the bad guys who set fires.\n\nDuring a recent special session in Mayor Domenic J. Sarno’s office honoring the duo, Fire Commissioner Gary G. Cassanelli posed a tongue-in-cheek question to Friberg.\n\n“Does he know how to use a a remote control for a TV?”\n\nFriberg replied in the negative but was quick to add that he is hoping to train Dakota how to bring him cold sodas from the refrigerator. “I am working on it,” he said\n\nTaping ‘Brain Freeze’\n\nIf you want a springtime bite of the Big Apple with a side dish of free comedic drama, head to Manhattan on April 24 when Springfield native John Kawie will tape a special performance of his one-man show “Brain Freeze.” The taping is being done by Parma Recordings for a DVD release of the show, which chronicles Kawie’s witty and touching journey through a stroke suffered at age 47 in 1997.\n\nThe lone afternoon performance will begin at 1:30 p.m. sharp at the famed Gotham Comedy Club, 208 W. 23rd St., between 7th and 8th avenues. If you need a landmark to get there, look for the fabled Chelsea Hotel, which is next door to the comedy club.\n\nHoping to quell hair fire\n\nHolyoke School Committee member Michael J. Moriarty tried to press the importance of pushing Mayor Elaine A. Pluta and the City council on approving money for a new furnace for H.B. Lawrence School at a recent meeting. The school, which now houses alternative programs for more than 100 children from first through 12th grade, will soon have no heat because Holyoke Gas and Electric is shutting off an old steam line which is now piped into the school.\n\n“We have to be bothering them like our hair is on fire,” he said.\n\nMoriarty also recommended Superintendent Eduardo B. Carballo to “be a nudge.”\n\nNo relation here\n\nErin T. Welby was recently recognized as the 100th home buyer in the Buy Springfield Now homeowner program, and Mayor Domenic J. Sarno was among those who went to Welby’s home on Denver Street.\n\nThere, the mayor reached back into television history when he commented that the buyer of the milestone home was “a descendent of Marcus Welby, M.D. Am I correct?”\n\nWelby, 26, is a teacher at Roger L. Putnam Vocational Technical High School.\n\nMany of her fellow 20-somethings and students may not know the mayor’s reference to “Marcus Welby, M.D.,” the television show than ran from 1969 to 1976 and starred Robert Young as the title character.\n\nA good goodbye\n\n“Good for him,” Ludlow School Superintendent Theresa M. Kane said after learning that Ludlow High School Principal Gordon C. Smith has been hired as East Longmeadow school superintendent.\n\n“We’ll miss him,” Kane said. She added that it “speaks well for our district” that Smith was hired for the East Longmeadow superintendent position.\n\n↧\n\nLosing and gaining at the same time\n\nThe NBC reality TV show “The Biggest Loser,” while encouraging folks to lose weight, is also working to help gain support for the fight to end hunger across the U.S. The Food Bank of Western Massachusetts will take a featured role in that effort in an episode to air this week as part of the show’s Pound for Pound...\n\nThe NBC reality TV show “The Biggest Loser,” while encouraging folks to lose weight, is also working to help gain support for the fight to end hunger across the U.S.\n\nThe Food Bank of Western Massachusetts will take a featured role in that effort in an episode to air this week as part of the show’s Pound for Pound Challenge.\n\nFootage was shot at the food bank in Hatfield on March 31; Suffield native Chris Kellogg, a morning show host for WMAS radio, who was inspired by “The Biggest Loser” in his own efforts to lose weight, was filmed, along with food bank workers and volunteers at work sorting salvaged food for dispersal to food pantries across the region. The camera crew from Los Angeles also conducted an interview with food bank executive director Andrew E. Morehouse.\n\n(Kellogg, we hear, lost more than 60 pounds in 10 months with a regimen that included eating less and working out at the Planet Fitness gym in Chicopee.)\n\nFor every pound lost by a participant in the show’s Pound for Pound Challenge across the country, their regional food banks will receive one pound of food.\n\nEdna Williams legend lives on\n\nC & W could have had a field day at the April 8 tribute to Edna Williams and the original Log Cabin!\n\nThe successful fund-raiser for the new Holyoke senior center drew some 350 people, 80 of them former employees of Williams at the landmark restaurant atop Mount Tom.\n\nWe were awed though by Sandy Mumblow, of Easthampton, who appeared in the uniform she wore 50 years ago. She was kidded that she could not have eaten all Williams’ delicious food and remained that trim.\n\nMumblow said business was so good then (and still is now because she is a waitress at the Log Cabin’s sister restaurant the Delaney House, where, by the way, you can savor a delicious popover – one of Williams’ signature foods – with your dinner) that she is too busy to eat.\n\nProud councilors\n\nSpringfield City Councilors Kateri B. Walsh and Timothy C. Allen have more in common than just a heightened interest in constituent concerns, special permits and zone changes. Both became proud grandparents – again – and just three days apart, with both newborns arriving on their due dates.\n\nFor Kateri, it was her eighth grandchild, Bridget Adele Walsh, born April 1, while Allen’s grandchild was his third, Camden Patrick Bertke, born on Easter Sunday, April 4.\n\nThe parents of Bridget are Kateri’s son Michael J. Walsh and his wife Jessica Fargen, of South Boston. Michael Walsh is an assistant attorney general in Boston. Allen’s daughter Mary Kate, and her husband Kyle Bertke, of Providence, R.I., are the parents of Camden. Camden was 7 pounds, 1 ounce, while Bridget was 6 pounds, 13 ounces.\n\nBunch of potty animals\n\nThey may be wild, but at least they use a toilet.\n\nInteresting information was exchanged at the April 13 Palmer Board of Health meeting about the town’s feral cat problem, where the idea of trapping, neutering and releasing the cats back into the wild was one of the options presented to control the cat population.\n\nLouise A. Chapin said cats were left behind near her property and kept multiplying, until she got them spayed and neutered with the help of the Homeless Cat Project.\n\nChapin cares for the cats and even lets them inside at night.\n\nShe said she thought her sister was forgetting to flush the toilet at night, but her sister denied it. She said they realized it was one of the feral cats.\n\nNow, if they could only get it to flush ...\n\nMoose on the loose\n\nWalter Zemanek spends a lot of time in the great outdoors, where he enjoys hiking, fishing and watching wildlife.\n\nHe got a special treat a couple of weeks ago.\n\nIn late March, the 79-year-old Chicopee resident was scouting the Swift River in Belchertown for good spots to launch his canoe when he noticed he was not alone. A cow moose was watching him.\n\n“She may have had a young one hidden somewhere because she followed me for awhile,” Zamanek said.\n\nHe took advantage of the meeting to snap a photo, which he shares here.\n\nAlthough moose are not so common in Western Massachusetts, Zemanek said he is used to seeing them where he fishes in Northern New Hampshire.\n\nDon’t miss The Republican tomorrow for Cries & Whispers on balloon pals in Ludlow, recognition for outgoing Monson School Committee member Michael J.

Sonia Burke, of West Brookfield, Tom Pfeiffer, of Shelburne Falls, and Pat Eagan, of Holyoke, helped staff a bulk distribution center that provided water, masks, clean-up kits and safety information.\n\nPat and George Gordon, of Wilbraham, and Howard Eldridge, of Springfield, participated in disaster assessment work.\n\nBobi Steingart, of Longmeadow, who’s helped in flood relief efforts in the Midwest and with the mopping up after Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, drove a Red Cross vehicle to distribute supplies.\n\nAnother seasoned volunteer, Jean Jack, of Springfield, helped out at the emergency operations center run by the state Emergency Management Agency in Agawam to help monitor the response by Pioneer Valley communities to flooding concerns.\n\nBalloon pals\n\nFourth and fifth graders at Veterans Park School in Ludlow released mylar balloons into the air on March 31 “to make new friends,” school volunteer Carlton W. Leonard said.\n\nOne balloon was found by a 15-year-old celebrating his birthday on the doorstep of his home in East Longmeadow. Other balloons have been recovered from as far away as Ellington and Glastonbury, Conn.\n\nHis long service lauded\n\nMonson School Committee member Edward A. Maia recognized outgoing member Michael J. Kane at the committee’s March 31 meeting, and the committee gave him a parting gift – a $350 donation to the Monson Scholarship Fund that he created.\n\n“We felt it appropriate that this being the last School Committee meeting prior to elections and Mr. Kane’s decision to not seek re-election to take a moment to recognize the fact that his presence has been sorely missed these last few weeks,” Maia said.\n\nKane is battling an illness, causing him to miss meetings.\n\n“We as a committee wanted to do something to recognize Mike Kane for his service to the Monson Public Schools since 1961 . . . as a teacher, a principal, a School Committee member and most recently as its chair, but most importantly, as a mentor to thousands of students who have graced the halls of Monson Public Schools.”\n\n“So Mike, if you are watching from home ... please know that these words or this donation may acknowledge your years of service to the kids of Monson but they cannot begin to express the gratitude that I personally feel for having known you. You have always been a true professional, gentleman . . . someone I want to be like when I grow up,” Maia said.\n\nTriathlon mania afoot\n\nSome of the participants in the Sheriff Spring Triathlon, which is coming up May 2 at the Randall Boys & Girls Club in Ludlow, become very enthusiastic about competing in such events, James G.

Sarno says he isn’t giving up on a full-court press to bring President Barack H. Obama to the birthplace of basketball for a face-off with U.S. Sen. Scott Brown .\n\nSarno was among the area’s notables at the Naismith Memorial National Basketball Hall of Fame for the April 16 Celebrity Rock ‘N Hoops event to benefit the Doug Flutie Jr. Foundation. Brown teamed up with the former New England Patriots star for a fund-raising game.\n\nSarno didn’t make the Flutie team – “I don’t have the wind any more,” he claimed – but he did say he’s pressing forward for a Brown-Obama pick-up game for charity one of these days.\n\nDays after Brown won the special election in January, he challenged Obama to a game of 2-on-2 basketball between him and his daughter Ayla vs. the president and any female player of Obama’s choosing. (Might we suggest one of Western Massachusetts’ favorite daughters of basketball – Rebecca Lobo or Bilqui Abdul-Qaadir)\n\nSarno says he’s gotten a lukewarm response from the White House, but isn’t giving up. “I told them ‘I don’t want to close the door on this.’ “\n\nNeither is Brown, who reissued his challenge before the game for Flutie’s cause; “I hope we can do something very similar and raise some money for our favorite charities.

The new stadium, which has a seating capacity of 39,504, was sold out and had more than 200 standing-room-only fans, too.\n\nShepard was thrilled to be able to get tickets to a Sox game in Minnesota, where he now lives with his wife, Jessica; he wasn’t so thrilled with the 5-2 walloping the Twins gave his team. He did concede, though, that if the reverse were true and the Sox were opening a new stadium, he’d be really upset if the visiting team had stolen the day.\n\nHe’s got ‘roots’ in WMass\n\nState treasurer candidate Steve Grossman can claim more than one kinship to Western Massachusetts.\n\nA century ago, his grandfather, Maxwell Grossman, got help starting the family business, which began as the Massachusetts Envelope Co., thanks to a line of credit given him by Springfield-based U.S. Envelope.\n\nBoth his mother and wife graduated from Smith College, the Democratic candidate shared during a recent meeting with the editorial board of The Republican.\n\nThose ties, he said, helped play a role in why he’s using Springfield as one of the sites from which he’ll formally announce his candidacy this week.\n\nHere’s Joseph Pieczarke ...\n\n↧\n\nLet him eat cake!\n\nFrom humble beginnings in a rented basement office to a leading financial institution, Hampden Bank recently celebrated its 158th anniversary.

And, what better way to mark a birthday than to serve up some cake!\n\nIt was on April 13, 1852 that Hampden Savings Bank was officially chartered by the state to serve the workers of the Western Railroad. It began in rented office space in the basement of the then Agawam National Bank on the corner of Lyman and Main streets in Springfield. The state Legislature decreed the location be “within twenty-five rods of the Western Railroad passenger depot.”\n\nToday, Hampden Bank has nine offices throughout Hampden County. “Although much has changed in banking since 1852, thankfully, providing customers with extraordinary service and being committed to the local community never goes out of style,” said Thomas R. Burton, the bank’s president and chief executive officer at the birthday party.\n\nSpeaking of 4-H\n\nWeston Brown, of Southwick, a former member of the 4-H, was chosen to speak and represent youth involvement in agriculture at this year’s Agriculture Day at the Statehouse in Boston on April 7.

Here’s how it happened .... He posted his ¤’74 Camaro on eBay and among the folks that inquired about the car were the producers of the Travel Channel show “Anthony Bourdain- No Reservations.” The crew was filming all week in South Boston for a show that will air in March. Anthony was looking for a ¤’70s muscle car to complete the show’s theme.

Rege Jr., and more\n\nSid Radner’s authentic touch\n\n“Chumlee” was unimpressed, but the expert sided with the guy with the Holyoke connection.\n\nChumlee is the nickname of a character on the History Channel televison series “Pawn Stars.” On the show, collectors, stuff-unloaders and others bring items into the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop, a 24-hour family business in Las Vegas, and barter with the proprietors to try to get the highest prices for their goods. On a recent episode, a man brought in handcuffs and leg shackles he said belonged to Harry Houdini (1874-1926), the magician, escape artist and ground-breaking showman.\n\nThe tie to Holyoke is that the paperwork the guy presented to pawn shop owner Rich Harrison read, “purchased at auction Sid Radner – Houdini collection.” That’s Sidney H. Radner, a Holyoke resident who also has a home in Palm Beach, Fla., and used to own the world’s largest collection of memorabilia and artifacts from Houdini. Radner, a magician himself, obtained the items because he became friends with Houdini’s brother, but auctioned the items on Oct. 31, 2004.\n\nHarrison brought in an expert on magicians who verified the handcuffs and leg shackles were Houdini’s, citing the “Sid Radner” paperwork as key. The expert said the handcuffs were worth $5,800 to $6,500 and the shackles $3,800 to $4,500. Harrison offered the guy who brought them in $5,000, the guy requested $7,000 and they settled on $6,000.\n\nChumlee? That’s the nickname of Austin Russell, who works behind the counter on Pawn Stars and is the butt of jokes on the show for his (seeming) slow-wittedness, girth and mouth-full-of-marbles way of speaking.\n\nChumlee scoffed at Houdini’s escape expertise. In the show’s final scene, Harrison and the magician expert locked the handcuffs on Chumlee’s wrists and then pretended to be busy elsewhere in the shop, leaving Chumlee to call after them while insisting he could free himself from the fabled iron restraints.\n\nEnglish bulldog in Irish tartan\n\nWest Springfield’s Gerald D. Healy, marshal of this year’s Holyoke St. Patrick’s Parade, is also the artistic talent behind the design of the Holyoke St. Patrick’s tartan.\n\nThe tartan fabric has been transformed into hats, scarves, neckties, skirts, pocketbooks and more, and at a recent committee meeting, C & W hears Gerry showed the possibility of belts. But, what brought the “oohs” and “aahs” from the committee members and what we bet could be the best seller of any of the creations, is a dog collar.\n\nThe first person to try it on for size was Roger J. Reidy, who said it would fit his dog perfectly, his dog obviously having the same size neck as his master. Let it be known that any dog would be proud to wear this symbol even if it’s not an Irish setter.\n\nA bid at humor\n\nAuctions can be rather dry, but it depends on who is running it.\n\nTake the auction held in Palmer of seven town-owned properties recently.\n\nAuctioneer Paul T. Zekos, president of the Zekos Group in Shrewsbury, had a “capacity crowd” of approximately 50 people and he used plenty of humor to lighten up the atmosphere in the packed and stuffy room at the Town Building.\n\nTo bid on a property, prospective owners had to be up-to-date on their tax payments to the town, and not have any arson charges lurking in their past.\n\n“So any arsonists here?” Zekos asked.\n\nThe room was silent.\n\n“Good sign,” Zekos said.\n\nHe even jested with John W. Lizak, a major property owner in Palmer. Lizak was in a bidding war with Dino D. Dacosta of Ludlow over 11 acres off Old Warren Road. Dacosta finally got the property for $30,000.\n\nLizak refused to bid higher, even with Zekos prodding him, “This will finally put you over the 50,000 acre mark.”\n\nSchool board hot dogs it\n\nA generous but unusual donation from Friendly’s Ice Cream Corp. of hot dog rolls to the Chicopee school lunch program sparked plenty of comments from School Committee members recently.\n\n“How many kids eat hot dogs?” asked committee member Mary-Elizabeth Pniak-Costello after seeing the company had donated 23,000 buns.\n\n“I don’t know, I didn’t do a hot dog survey,” Superintendent Richard W. Rege Jr. answered, only to get a response from member Sharon M. Nawrocki. “Please don’t,” she said.\n\nWhen the issue came up for a vote, several grinned and started humming the old commercial jingle for Armor Hot Dogs. The committee member David G. Barsalou said he had a serious question.\n\n“I would like to know where all the hot dogs went.”\n\nWhat or who is in a name?\n\nWe always get a chuckle out of people whose names reflect their professions, like the yoga instructor named Ruth Bender and the veterinarian named Michael Katz. Now we’re starting a new list – people whose destinies seem to derive from their addresses.\n\nAt the top? The tree warden in South Hadley. He lives on Cypress Drive.\n\n↧\n\nCincinnati Bengals player Chad Ochocinco's choice for workout music: Ashley Gearing\n\nGearing gained 300 new followers within the first hour of Ochocinco's tweet.\n\nWho knew that country artist Ashley Gearing is making music to work out to – for a superstar NFL wide receiver, no less!\n\nCincinnati Bengals player and former “Dancing With the Stars” contestant Chad Ochocinco recently Tweeted about listening to Gearing’s “Five More Minutes” while working out. While upbeat, fast and aggressive songs seem like more appropriate gym fare, maybe Ochocinco is on to something.\n\nOchocinco’s Tweet read as follows: “Was in the gym with Ashley Gearing’s song entitled 5 More Minutes on repeat, awesome song. Something about country music is very compelling.”\n\nNot only is Ochocinco into Gearing’s song, but he also gave the country genre a ringing endorsement in 140 characters or less!\n\nGearing also benefited from the Tweet, gaining 300 new followers within the first hour of it being posted.\n\nOchocinco later Tweeted another affirmation of his love for Gearing’s music, writing, “I’m pretty sure it’s Ashley Gearing that’s making country music compelling; yep, I’m positive.”\n\n↧\n\nNorthampton High School senior Marguerite Suozzo-Golé wins Massachusetts History Day essay contest\n\nMarguerite be one of two young people from Massachusetts competing in National History Day to be held June 12-16 at the University of Maryland.\n\n“Debate & Diplomacy in History: Successes, Failures, Consequences” is the theme for this year’s National History Day competition. More than 500,000 students from across the country entered the contest, and now it’s down to the finals.\n\nMarguerite Suozzo-Golé, a Northampton High School senior, wrote the winning entry in the Massachusetts History Day Competition held on April 9 at Clark University in Worcester.\n\nHer paper was titled “A Sacred Engagement: Wampum Diplomacy’s Role in Anglo-Iroquois Relations.”\n\nShe’ll be one of two young people from Massachusetts competing in National History Day to be held June 12-16 at the University of Maryland.\n\n↧"
