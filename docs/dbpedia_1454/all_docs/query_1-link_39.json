Ten individuals were killed, and as many wounded, all in their 50s, 60s, and 70s.

Our peace this past week was shattered by the deadly shooting at Club Q, a gathering place for the LGBTQIA+ community in Colorado Springs, Colorado. The violence claimed the lives of five people and injured 17 others, and to add to the devastation, this happened on the eve of Transgender Day of Remembrance, a day named to honor those lost to anti-transgender violence. This latest incident echoes the 2016 mass shooting at Pulse, the gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, where 49 were killed and as many wounded. The trend of violence against the LGBTQIA+ community has not abated, and the acrimonious divisions in our society have only added fuel to these senseless acts.\n\nBunker Hill Community College Named One of the Grantees to Educate Boston’s Early Childhood Workforce\n\nBunker Hill Community College (BHCC) is named as one of the four grantees in the Growing the Early Childhood Workforce Fund grant that will fund the education of nearly 800 early childcare educators who work in Boston.

The more frequently these tragedies occur, the harder they are to comprehend. A supermarket in Buffalo, a church in Laguna Woods, a school in Parkland, a school in Sandy Hook, and so many more murders driven by racism, misogyny, homophobia, and other forms of hate, made possible by the easy reach of a gun. How do we end this senseless cycle of violence? Why are the broadly popular policies for gun safety left to languish in the halls of power? Why is the most common reaction to these mass shootings to simply wait for the next one?\n\nBunker Hill Community College Breaks Ground on New Student Success Center\n\nCollege’s first new building in a decade expands student services and learning commons with a climate-responsive design\n\nBunker Hill Community College (BHCC) broke ground on a new Student Success Center building on Tuesday, April 26, the first new building in more than a decade for the state’s largest community college and the first of several planned upgrades for the almost 50-year-old campus.\n\nA Compelling Conversation with Sean Ellis: Talking about resilience, community, and criminal justice reform with Boston advocate\n\nEven though his wrongful convictions, which resulted in his imprisonment for 22 years, seven months, and 29 days, have been overturned, Sean Ellis is still working for justice– not only for himself but for everyone.\n\nBHCC stands in solidarity with the people of Ukraine and with victims of war and violence everywhere\n\nBunker Hill Community College | Office of the President\n\nDear BHCC Community,\n\nSince last week’s Russian invasion of Ukraine, I have watched the events unfolding in Europe with concern and sorrow. Violence and war are the enemies of the values that this College and virtually every educational institution hold dear. Where education broadens our understanding of ourselves and the world, war narrows it; where education lifts a light by which we might see, violence casts only shadow. As a College, we stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine, and with victims of war and violence everywhere.\n\nIn Celebration of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nBunker Hill Community College | Office of the President\n\nDear BHCC Community,\n\nAs we study the inspirational achievements and ongoing struggles in the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. on Monday, January 17, 2022, I hope we take his teachings to heart and reflect on our own work, and that of our community, our nation, and our world.\n\nThe Boston Foundation Awards $15K in Recognition of Learn and Earn Program\n\nThe Boston Foundation (TBF) announced that Bunker Hill Community College (BHCC) has been selected as a runner up recipient of the 7th Annual Deval Patrick Prize for Community Colleges.
