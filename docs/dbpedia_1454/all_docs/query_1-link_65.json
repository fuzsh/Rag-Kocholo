        "text": "Collection number: MC 58\n\nSize: 72 boxes (24 cu.ft.)\n\nAbout Lotte Jacobi (1896-1990)\n\nThe photographer Johanna Alexandra Jacobi Reiss, affectionately known as Lotte, was born in Thorn, West Prussia in 1896 in what is now Poland. When she was two years old, her family moved to nearby Posen. In 1916, Lotte married and a year later gave birth to a son, John. After Posen became part of Poland in 1921, the Jacobi family moved to Berlin, Germany, where, after a long separation, Lotte’s marriage ended in 1924. Directly after the divorce, she began her film and camera work, studying film at the University of Munich, while simultaneously attending the Bavarian State Academy of Photography.\n\nPhotography ran in the Jacobi family. Lotte’s great-grandfather, Samuel Jacobi, visited Paris between 1839 and 1842, where he obtained a camera, a license, and some instruction from L.J.M. Daguerre and then returned to Thorn to set up a studio. He prospered at his trade and eventually passed the business on to his son, Alexander. Alexander, in turn, handed the business down to his three sons, the eldest of whom was Lotte’s father, Sigismund. Thus, there was always the expectation that Lotte and her sister, Ruth (a brother, Alexander, died at age 20), would continue the family business. With such a heritage, Lotte once commented, “I was to be a photographer and that was that.”\n\nAfter completing her formal studies, Jacobi entered the family business in 1927. During this same period (1926-27) she began her professional work as a photographer, and she also produced four films, the most important being “Portrait of the Artist,” a study of Josef Scharl. From October of 1932 to January of 1933, Lotte traveled to the Soviet Union, in particular to Tadjikistan and Uzbekistan, taking photographs of what she saw. She returned to Berlin in February 1933, one month after Hitler came to power. As persecution against Jews increased, Lotte left Germany with her son, arriving in New York City in September 1935 where she opened a studio in Manhattan. In 1940, Lotte married Erich Reiss, a distinguished German publisher and writer, a marriage that lasted until his death in 1951. During this time, she continued portrait photography at her studio, while also embarking upon an experimental type of photographic work that artist Leo Katz later named photogenics.\n\nIn 1955, Lotte left New York with her son and daughter-in-law and moved to Deering, New Hampshire, a move that changed her life. There she opened a new studio, where she both continued her own work and displayed works by other artists. She became interested in politics and was a fervent Democrat, representing New Hampshire at the Democratic National Convention in 1980. She traveled extensively (in the U.S., Europe, and Peru) and enjoyed new-found fame in the 1970s and 1980s. She died in 1990 at the age of 93.\n\nLotte Jacobi is best known for her photographic portraits, which act as a “chronicle of an era.” The list of her subjects reads like a who’s who of the 20th century: W.H. Auden, Martin Buber, Marc Chagall, W.E.B. DuBois, Albert Einstein, Robert Frost, Käthe Kollwitz, Lotte Lenya, Peter Lorre, Thomas Mann, Max Planck, Eleanor Roosevelt, J.D. Salinger, Alfred Stieglitz, and Chaim Weizmann – to name but a few. During her lifetime she received numerous honors and was recognized as the “greatest woman photographer of the twentieth century”.\n\nAbout the Lotte Jacobi Papers\n\nThe Lotte Jacobi Collection was donated to the University of New Hampshire in 1985. Additional material was donated in 2001 by Irma and Mordecai Bauman and by Beatrice Trum Hunter. The Lotte Jacobi Collection consists of correspondence spanning the years 1924-1986, personal files, daybooks, account books, exhibition information, scrapbooks, biographical information, inscribed works given to Lotte by authors and poets, hundreds of family snapshots, and numerous photographs given to Lotte by other distinguished photographers.\n\nBefore her death, she bequeathed 47,000 negatives, several hundred study and exhibition prints, three portfolios, letters, catalogues, documents, and other printed material to UNH.
