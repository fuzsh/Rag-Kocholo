        "text": "“The committee’s jurisdiction covers everything from cell phones to alternative energy to public utility reform to carbon pricing,” Barrett said. “Being Senate Chair doesn’t give me access to any more of my colleague’s votes. I’m going to have to be patient and a good listener to build needed consensus.”\n\nIn 2015-2016, the Committee shepherded through the Legislature a bill to expand the state’s clean energy portfolio to include hydro power from Canada and offshore wind. It also has purview over issues like solar generation and the electricity grid.\n\nBarrett says he’s looking forward to working with his House counterpart, State Rep. Tom Golden, D-Lowell, who was just re-appointed House Chair of the Committee by Speaker Robert DeLeo. Both Barrett and Golden represent Chelmsford in the Legislature.\n\n“Given the urgency of climate change, Massachusetts finds itself at an energy-crossroads,” Barrett said. “We need to get to work.”"
