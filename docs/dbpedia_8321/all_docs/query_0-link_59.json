Section 245(i) allows certain persons who have an immigrant visa immediately available but entered without inspection or otherwise violated their status and thus are ineligible to apply for adjustment of status in the United States—to apply if they pay a $1,000 penalty... This is an important benefit for eligible individuals. Without Section 245(i), many individuals who entered illegally or violated their status are restricted from filing for adjustment in the United States and must obtain their immigrant visas overseas... The LIFE Act also...

Reported escalations in criminal activity and illegal immigration, however, have prompted some lawmakers to reevaluate the extent and type of military support that occurs in the border region... Addressing domestic laws and activities with the military, however, might run afoul of the Posse Comitatus Act [U.S. Code, Title 18, § 1385], which prohibits use of the armed forces to perform the tasks of civilian law enforcement unless explicitly authorized... After the attacks of September 11, 2001, military support was expanded to include counterterrorism activities. Although the DOD [Department of Defense] does not have the 'assigned responsibility to stop terrorists from coming across our borders,' its support role in counterdrug and counterterrorism efforts appears to have increased the Department’s profile in border security.\"\n\nCongressional Research Service (CRS), \"Border Security and Military Support: Legal Authorizations and Restrictions,\" www.loc.gov/crsinfo, Mar. 23, 2006\n\n- Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act Updates Immigration Databases and Travel Document Requirements\n\n\"Approximately eight months after the terrorist attacks of September 11, on May 14, 2002, President George W. Bush signed the Enhanced Border Security and Visa Entry Reform Act of 2002. …It represents the most comprehensive immigration-related response to the continuing terrorist threat America faces.\n\nThe Border Security law contains several provisions that are critical to our ability to control our border. Among the most important are:\n\nA requirement that the immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) make interoperable all its internal databases, so that all information about a particular alien may be accessed with a single search;\n\nA requirement that federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies share data on aliens with the INS and the State Department; and\n\nA requirement that all travel and entry documents, including visas, issued to aliens by the United States be machine-readable and tamper-resistant and include a standard biometric identifier.\"\n\n\"The Enhanced Border Security and Visa Reform Act of 2002, H.R. 3525,\" www.cis.org, June 2002\n\n- \"Minuteman Project\" Begins Recruiting Civilians to Patrol the US-Mexico Border\n\n\"In Arizona, a group calling itself the Minuteman Project has stationed scores of men and women along the Mexican border in a controversial effort to track down undocumented immigrants. The Minutmen take their name from a militia group during the American Revolutionary War. The group’s founder, James Gilchrist, says the project [since Oct. 1, 2004] has attracted some 450 volunteers from around the country. On Monday, Gilchirst said they aided in the arrest of 146 undocumented immigrants. The Minutemen have staked out across a 23-mile stretch of border northeast of Nogales for the month-long action. Many use binoculars and night-vision goggles. Some are armed with guns. Over 20 pilots with aircraft are also surveying the area. Organizers call their effort a peaceful protest over the government’s failure to secure its borders. Both the Mexican government and the Bush administration have described them the Minutemen as vigilantes. Meanwhile, the American Civil Liberties Union has sent observers to keep tabs on the Minutemen to ensure they don’t take the law into their own hands.\"\n\n\"Vigilantes or Civilian Border Patrol?

The Act authorizes the construction of [700] hundreds of miles of double-layered fencing along the nation's Southern border. It also directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to take action to stop the unlawful entry of undocumented immigrants, terrorists, and contraband into the U.S. using both personnel and surveillance technology. The Secretary is further instructed to evaluate U.S. Customs and Border Protection training and equipment. Finally, the Act requests a study on the feasibility of constructing an improved security system along the Northern border.\"\n\n\"2007 Edition: Principles for an Immigration Policy to Strengthen and Expand the American Middle Class,\" www.drummajorinstitute.org, 2007\n\n- US Department of Homeland Security Estimates 11.8 Million Unauthorized Immigrants in US with 59% from Mexico\n\n\"[A]n estimated 11.8 million unauthorized immigrants were living in the United States in January 2007 compared to 8.5 million in 2000. Between 2000 and 2007, the unauthorized population increased 3.3 million; the annual average increase during this period was 470,000.

Under Arizona's new law, to take effect in 90 days, it will be a state crime to be in the country illegally, and legal immigrants will be required to carry paperwork proving their status. Arizona police will generally be required to question anyone they 'reasonably suspect' of being undocumented -- a provision that critics argue will lead to widespread racial profiling, but that supporters insist will give authorities the flexibility to enforce existing immigration laws.\"\n\nAnne E.

Janet Napolitano signed the Arizona law in 2007, saying that while immigration is a federal responsibility, Arizona had been forced to deal with the issue because the demand for cheap, undocumented labor in the state was contributing to illegal immigration.\n\nNumerous organizations, including the Chamber of Commerce, argued the state's law was preempted by the federal Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which forbids states from imposing sanctions for hiring illegal immigrants...\n\nSeveral states have enacted measures that seek to penalize employers for hiring illegal workers, while others are considering legislation similar to Arizona's.\"\n\nBrent Kendall and Stephanie Gleason, \"US High Court Upholds Arizona Immigration Law Targeting Employers,\" www.wsj.com, May 26, 2\n\n- President Obama Signs Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) to Allow Some Undocumented Immigrants Who Came to the United States as Children to Stay in the Country\n\n\"Hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children will be allowed to remain in the country without fear of deportation and able to work, under an executive action the Obama administration announced on Friday. Administration officials said the president used existing legal authority to make the broad policy change, which could temporarily benefit more than 800,000 young people. He did not consult with Congress, where Republicans have generally opposed measures to benefit illegal immigrants... \"They are Americans in their heart, in their minds, in every single way but one: on paper,” President Obama said in announcing the new policy in the White House Rose Garden on Friday... Under the change, the Department of Homeland Security will no longer initiate the deportation of illegal immigrants who came to the United States before age 16, have lived here for at least five years, and are in school, are high school graduates or are military veterans in good standing.

The provision requires state law enforcement officials to determine the immigration status of anyone they stop or arrest if they have reason to suspect that the individual might be in the country illegally.\n\nThe justices parted ways on three other provisions, with the majority rejecting measures that would have subjected illegal immigrants to criminal penalties for activities like seeking work.\n\nThe ruling is likely to set the ground rules for the immigration debate, with supporters of the Arizona law pushing for 'show me your papers' provisions in more states and opponents trying to overturn criminal sanctions for illegal immigrants.\"\n\nAdam Liptak, \"Blocking Parts of Arizona Law, Justices Allow Its Centerpiece,\" www.nytimes.com, June 25, 2012\n\n- Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act Adds Immigrants to Protected Classes\n\n\"[T]he VAWA [Violence Against Women Act] provides a temporary visa and creates a pathway to legalization for undocumented immigrants who are the victims of domestic abuse. The idea being that immigrants who are subject to domestic violence don’t report it for fear of being deported or are abused though the threat of deportation. As a result, VAWA has been a useful tool for undocumented immigrants to come out of the shadows by both speaking out against their abusers and securing legal status.\"\n\n\"Gendered Laws: VAWA, IRCA, and the Future of Immigration Reform,\" www.huffingtonpost.com, Mar. 7, 2013\n\n- President Obama Announced Executive Action to Prevent Deportation of Millions of Immigrants in the United States Illegally\n\n\"President Barack Obama imposed the most sweeping immigration reform in a generation on Thursday, easing the threat of deportation for some 4.7 million undocumented immigrants and setting up a clash with Republicans who vow to fight his moves. In a White House speech, Obama rejected Republican arguments that his decision to bypass Congress and take executive action was tantamount to amnesty for illegal immigrants… With 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States, Obama's plan would let some 4.4 million who are parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents remain in the country temporarily, without the threat of deportation. Those undocumented residents could apply legally for jobs and join American society, but not vote or qualify for insurance under the president's healthcare law. The measure would apply to those who have been in the United States for at least five years. An additional 270,000 people would be eligible for relief under the expansion of a 2012 move by Obama to stop deporting people brought illegally to the United States as children by their parents.\"\n\n\"Obama Unveils U.S. Immigration Reform, Setting up Fight with Republicans,\" www.reuters.com, Nov. 21, 2014\n\n- Supreme Court Deadlocked in 4-4 Vote on Challenge to Obama's Immigration Executive Actions\n\n\"The 4-4 tie leaves in place a lower court ruling that put the Obama administration's DAPA program on hold. If you remember, back in 2014, President Obama announced that he was expanding his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which shielded young people, commonly referred to as 'dreamers,' who were brought into the country illegally by their parents. That program shielded some 1.1 million immigrants from deportation, while the expansion of that program and the creation of another — called Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) — would have shielded some 4 million others.\"\n\n\"With High Court Evenly Split, Obama's Immigration Actions Remain on Hold,\" npr.org, June 23, 2016\n\n- President Trump Signs Executive Orders to Increase Border Patrol Forces and Begin Plans to Build Border Wall\n\n\"Trump signed two executive orders directing the construction of a wall on the US-Mexico border, boosting border patrol forces and increasing the number of immigration enforcement officers who carry out deportations. The orders also call for stripping sanctuary cities of federal grant funding and announced sweeping new criteria that could make many more undocumented immigrants priorities for deportation... The executive orders Trump signed Wednesday call for boosting the ranks of Border Patrol forces by an additional 5,000 agents as well as for 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers to carry out deportations. The orders noted that the increases were subject to Congress's appropriation of sufficient funds... Trump also outlined new criteria for determining which undocumented immigrants should be prioritized for deportation, putting hundreds of thousands and perhaps millions more people at the top of the federal government's list of people to deport. Any undocumented immigrant convicted or simply charged with a crime that hasn't been adjudicated could be deported under the Trump administration's new policy... New priorities for deportation under Trump also include any undocumented immigrants who abuse public benefits, or simply those considered 'a risk to public safety or national security... in the judgment of an immigration officer.'\"\n\n\"Trump Orders Construction of Border Wall, Boosts Deportation Force,\" cnn.com, Jan. 25, 2017\n\n- President Trump Signs Two Immigration Executive Orders Suspending Entry of People from Several Predominantly Muslim Countries and all Refugees\n\n\"US President Donald Trump signed a new executive order Monday [Mar. 6, 2017] that bans immigration from six Muslim-majority countries, dropping Iraq from January's previous order, and reinstates a temporary blanket ban on all refugees. The new travel ban comes six weeks after Trump's original executive order [Jan. 27, 2017] caused chaos at airports nationwide before it was blocked by federal courts. It removes out language in the original order that indefinitely banned Syrian refugees and called for prioritizing the admission of refugees who are religious minorities in their home countries. That provision drew criticism of a religious test for entry and would have prioritized Christians over Muslims fleeing war-torn countries in the Middle East. The new ban, which takes effect March 16, also explicitly exempts citizens of the six banned countries who are legal US permanent residents or have valid visas to enter the US -- including those whose visas were revoked during the original implementation of the ban, senior administration officials said... The new measures will block citizens of Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen from obtaining visas for at least 90 days. The order also suspends admission of refugees into the US for 120 days, directing US officials to improve vetting measures for a program that is already widely regarded as extremely stringent.\"\n\n\"US President Donald Trump Signs New Travel Ban, Exempts Iraq,\" cnn.com, Mar. 7, 2017\n\n- Massachusetts Court Rules Law Enforcement Officials Cannot Comply with ICE Detainers\n\n\"The Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled Monday that local and state law enforcement officers do not have the authority to arrest and hold a person solely on the basis of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainer... While many states and municipalities issue guidance to local law enforcement authorities, the Massachusetts ruling goes one step further. In essence, it means that officers do not have the authority under state law to administer ICE detainers. An ICE detainer is issued on an undocumented person who has been arrested on local criminal charges when ICE believes there is probable cause to remove the person from the United States, according to the ICE website. If a local law enforcement agency complies with the request, when the person is released from local custody, ICE immediately takes the person into custody.\"\n\nSarah Jorgensen, \"Massachusetts Court: State Officers Canot Hold Immigrants for ICE,\" cnn.com, July 24, 2017\n\n- Trump Administration Announces End to Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) Program\n\n\"The Trump administration Tuesday formally announced it will end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program — also called DACA — putting an expiration date on the legal protections granted to roughly 800,000 people known as 'DREAMers,' who entered the country illegally as children. Homeland Security Acting Secretary Elaine Duke said the administration, facing legal challenges to the program, 'chose the least disruptive option,' letting the program wind down in six months, and placing the onus on a sharply divided Congress to enact former President Barack Obama's executive action into law... Duke said no current beneficiaries will be affected before March 5 of next year. But she said, 'No new initial requests or associated applications filed after today will be acted on.' Trump signaled the decision earlier on Tuesday [Sep. 5], tweeting, 'Congress, get ready to do your job - DACA.'\"\n\n\"Trump Ends DACA, Calls on Congress to Act,\" npr.org, Sep. 5, 2017\n\n- Trump Administration Announces New Travel Restrictions\n\n\"The Trump administration has unveiled new travel restrictions on certain foreigners from Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen as a replacement to a central portion of its controversial travel ban signed earlier this year. The new restrictions on travel vary by country and include a phased-in approach beginning next month... Individuals with that 'bona fide' exception -- such as a foreign grandparent of a US citizen -- can still apply for visas until October 18. After that date, the new restrictions on travel will begin. The revised travel ban effecting those from six-Muslim majority countries officially expired earlier Sunday, and Sudan was removed from the list of affected countries. The new list of countries notably includes several non-Muslim majority nations, including North Korea and Venezuela. In most instances, travel will be broadly suspended, while in other cases, travelers will have to undergo enhanced screening and vetting requirements. For instance, foreign nationals from North Korea are banned, but a student from Iran will be allowed in, subject to 'enhanced screening and vetting requirements.'\"\n\nLaura Jarrett and Sophie Tatum, \"Trump Administration Announces New Travel Restrictions,\" cnn.com, Sep. 25, 2017\n\n- California Becomes Sanctuary State\n\n\"Gov. Jerry Brown signed landmark 'sanctuary state' legislation Thursday, vastly limiting who state and local law enforcement agencies can hold, question and transfer at the request of federal immigration authorities.\n\nSenate Bill 54, which takes effect in January, has been hailed as part of a broader effort by majority Democrats in the California Legislature to shield more than 2.3 million immigrants living illegally in the state. Weeks before Brown's signature made it law, it was met with swift denunciations from Trump administration officials and became the focus of a national debate over how far states and cities can go to prevent their officers from enforcing federal immigration laws...\n\nThe new law will largely prohibit state and local law enforcement agencies from using either personnel or funds to hold, question or share information about people with federal immigration agents unless those individuals have been convicted of one or more offenses from a list of 800 crimes outlined in a 2013 state law.\n\nFederal immigration authorities will still be able to work with state corrections officials — a key concession Brown had demanded — and will be able to enter county jails to question immigrants. But the state attorney general's office will be required to publish guidelines and training recommendations to limit immigration agents' access to personal information. And all law enforcement agencies will have to produce annual reports on their participation in task forces that involve federal agencies, as well as on the people they transfer to immigration authorities.\n\nThe new law doesn't specify what happens if local law enforcement agencies don't comply with the new rules. But the attorney general has broad authority under the state Constitution to prosecute police and sheriff's agencies that don’t comply.\"\n\nJazmine Ulloa, \"California Becomes 'Sanctuary State' in Rebuke of Trump Immigration Policy,\" latimes.com, Oct. 5, 2017\n\n- US Supreme Court Rules Undocumented Immigrants Can Be Detained Indefinitely\n\n\"The Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday [Feb. 27, 2018] that people held in immigration detention, sometimes for years, are not entitled to periodic hearings to decide whether they may be released on bail...\n\nThe Ninth Circuit had ruled that bond hearings are required after six months to determine whether detainees who do not pose flight risks or a danger to public safety may be released while their cases proceed.

Roberts Jr. said that Mr. Trump had ample statutory authority to make national security judgments in the realm of immigration... He concluded that the proclamation [travel ban], viewed in isolation, was neutral and justified by national security concerns...\n\nEven as it upheld the travel ban, the majority took a momentous step. It overruled Korematsu v. United States, the 1944 decision that endorsed the detention of Japanese-Americans during World War II...\n\nJustices Anthony M. Kennedy, Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch joined the majority opinion.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor delivered a searing dissent from the bench in which she accused the court's majority of upholding an 'openly discriminatory policy motivated by animus' to a religious minority... Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined Justice Sotomayor's dissent.\n\nIn a second, milder dissent, Justice Stephen G. Breyer, joined by Justice Elena Kagan, questioned whether the administration could be trusted to enforce what he called 'the proclamation's elaborate system of exemptions and waivers.'\"\n\nAdam Liptak and Michael D. Shear, \"Supreme Court Upholds Trump's Travel Ban,\" nytimes.com, June 26, 2018\n\n- United States and Mexico Sign Joint Deal on Immigration\n\n\"A U.S.-Mexico Joint Declaration was announced Friday [June 7, 2019] evening, and Trump backed off on his threat to impose additional tariffs on Mexico. Trump had threatened to impose additional on tariffs on the country if it did not take additional actions to curb migration to the U.S.-Mexico border. The proposed tariffs were set to take effect on Monday [June 10, 2019], beginning at a 5% tariff on all Mexican goods and gradually increasing to 25% by October.\n\nAs part of the agreement, Mexico will do two main things. First, Mexico will take 'unprecedented steps to increase [immigration] enforcement,' including by deploying the National Guard throughout the country and 'giving priority to its southern border,' where migrants from Central America typically enter the country. Second, Mexico will participate in an expanded implementation of the Migrant Protection Protocols, also known as Remain in Mexico, which requires those seeking asylum in the United States to be returned to Mexico, where they will wait until a decision has been made on their case.\"\n\nAdrienne Masha Varkiani, \"Trump Makes Big Claim about His Mexico Deal That Isn't Backed Up on Paper,\" thinkprogress.org, June 8, 2019\n\n- SCOTUS Rules Undocumented Immigrants Charged with Possessing Firearms Must Know Their Unlawful Immigration Status to Be Convicted\n\n\"In a little-noticed case [Rehaif v. United States], the Supreme Court on Friday [June 21, 2019] held 7–2 that undocumented immigrants charged with possessing firearms must know their unlawful [immigration] status to be convicted of a crime…\n\nThe facts of the case are as follows: Hamid Rehaif came to Florida, flunked out of school, and overstayed his student visa. Then he went to a firing range and shot two guns. The federal government tried him for 'possessing firearms as an alien unlawfully in the United States,' which carries up to a 10-year sentence for those who 'knowingly' violate it…\n\nNotably, this issue won't just apply to people who are currently charged. Typically, decisions like these also apply retroactively to people who are on direct appeal from their convictions. That means many people currently languishing in federal custody may have an opportunity to challenge their convictions… This case may not resonate solely at the federal level. Many states model their statutes on federal law, and may find themselves bound to follow the Supreme Court's interpretation where the language is identical.\"\n\nAndrew Fleishman, \"The Supreme Court Just Showed a Way Forward on Criminal Justice Reform,\" slate.com, June 21, 2019\n\n- California Becomes First State to Extend Medicaid to Undocumented Immigrant Young Adults\n\n\"California has become the first state to extend health care coverage to some undocumented young adults through its Medicaid program.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Gavin Newsom on Tuesday [July 9, 2019] signed SB-104, which extends health care benefits to individuals 19 to 25 years of age, regardless of their immigration status... It is expected to cover some 90,000 low-income residents between the ages of 19 and 25 and to cost the state $98 million in its initial year. The coverage would take effect in 2020, according to the legislation.\n\nThe federal Medicaid program prohibits payment to a state for medical assistance furnished to an undocumented immigrant who is not lawfully admitted for permanent residence or otherwise permanently residing in the United States under color of law, according to the bill.\"\n\nDevan Cole and Sarah Moon, \"California Gov Signs Health Care Bill Extending Coverage to Some Undocumented Residents,\" cnn.com, July 10, 2019\n\n- American Samoans Ruled US Citizens by Birth\n\n\"A federal judge in Utah said Thursday that American Samoans are US citizens and should be issued new passports reflecting that.\n\n'This court is not imposing 'citizenship by judicial fiat.' The action is required by the mandate of the Fourteenth Amendment as construed and applied by Supreme Court precedent,' wrote Judge Clark Waddoups in the US District Court for the District of Utah...\n\nIt's unclear whether Waddoups' order applies to American Samoans beyond Utah...\n\nAmerican Samoa has been a US territory since 1900. Those born in the other US territories -- Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam and the Northern Marianas -- all get citizenship at birth, but that was determined by statute in Congress. No such law exists for American Samoa.\n\nAmerican Samoans living in Utah brought the suit in 2018, arguing that being 'non-citizen nationals,' instead of US citizens closed the door to some employment opportunities and didn't allow them to vote, among other rights afforded to US citizens.\n\nTheir passports also include a disclaimer that reads: 'The bearer is a United States national and not a United States citizen.'\"\n\nPriscilla Alvarez, \"Federal Judge Rules American Samoans Are US Citizens by Birth,\" cnn.com, Dec. 12, 2019\n\n- US Immigration Policy Adjusted in Response to COVID-19 (Coronavirus) Pandemic\n\nIn Mar. 2020, in response to the COVID-19 (coronavirus) pandemic, the Trump administration changed some immigration rules, including:\n\nMar. 10: The Office of Refugee Resettlement temporarily stopped placing immigrant children in Washington state or California.\n\nMar. 13: Travel from China and Iran was restricted earlier in the year and 26 European countries were added to the list in March. Green card holders and immediate family members must face additional health screenings to enter the US.\n\nMar. 13: Social visitation to all ICE detention facilities was temporarily stopped.\n\nMar. 16: Travel restrictions were extended to include Ireland and the UK.\n\nMar. 17: A day after Guatemala closed its borders, an asylum agreement between the country and the US was suspended.\n\nMar. 17: ICE (US Immigration and Customs Enforcement) will reschedule in-person appointments for immigrants who are not in detention and recent arrivals will be required to check in at 60 days after arrival instead of 30.\n\nMar. 17: US Citizenship and Immigration Services suspended all in-person services, including naturalization ceremonies.\n\nMar. 18: ICE suspends deportation flights to China, Italy, and South Korea.\n\nMar. 18. Refugee admissions were paused after the International Organization for Migration, the organization that books flights, suspended resettlement travel.\n\nMar. 18: Nonessential travel between Canada and the US has been paused by mutual agreement.\n\nMar. 18: The DOJ (Department of Justice) closed more immigration courts and postponed all hearings for immigrants who are not in detention.\n\nMar. 18: ICE dialed back operations, focusing on undocumented immigrants who are “subject to mandatory detention based on criminal grounds.”\n\nMar. 20: The US and Mexico announced a joint effort to restrict non-essential travel between the two countries.\n\nMar. 22: Trump announced undocumented immigrants could be tested for COVID-19 (coronavirus) without fear of arrest or deportation.\n\nPriscilla Alvarez, \"12 Changes to the US Immigration System during the Coronavirus Pandemic,\" cnn.com, Mar. 18, 2020\n\nBrett Samuels, \"Trumps Says Undocumented Immigrants Can Get Tested for Coronavirus without Fear of Deportation,\" thehill.com, Mar. 22, 2020\n\nBrett Samuels, \"US Announces Travel Restrictions with Mexico, Citing Coronavirus,\" thehill.com, Mar. 20, 2020\n\n- No COVID-19 Student Federal Aid or Stimulus Checks for Undocumented Immigrants and Spouses\n\nGuidance issued on Apr. 21, 2020 by the Education Department bars undocumented students from receiving federal COVID-19 stimulus aid. The aid is meant to pay for expenses including food, housing, and childcare due to the unavailability of college services because of COVID-19 (coronavirus) school closures. $6 billion in aid was distributed to colleges and universities for the institutions to grant to students.\n\nEducation Department Spokesperson Angela Morabito stated, \"The CARES Act makes clear that this taxpayer funded relief fund should be targeted to U.S. citizens, which is consistently echoed throughout the law.\"\n\nThe CARES Act also provides $1,200 stimulus checks to American citizens earning up to $75,000 and an additional $500 per child. However, undocumented immigrants are excluded, even those in the process of obtaining legal status. And American citizens who are married to undocumented immigrants and file taxes jointly will not receive stimulus checks. Over one million Americans are estimated to not receive stimulus checks because they are married to an undocumented immigrant.\n\nTal Axelrod, \"DeVos Blocks Undocumented College Students from Receiving Emergency Aid amid Pandemic,\" thehill.com, Apr. 21, 2020\n\nJennie Jarvie, \"These U.S. Citizens Won't Get Coronavirus Stimulus Checks - Because Their Spouses Are Immigrants,\" latimes.com, Apr. 22, 2020\n\n- Trump Halts Immigration during COVID-19 (Coronavirus) Pandemic\n\nOn Apr. 20, 2020, President Trump tweeted, \"In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!\"\n\nTrump signed the executive order on Apr. 22, 2020, officially suspending immigration for people who are outside the US, do not have an immigrant visa, and do not have official travel documents other than visas. The order is expected to prevent thousands from immigrating.\n\nThe executive order is in effect for 60 days, but may be renewed or modified before it expires.\n\nTrump stated, \"This order will ensure that unemployed Americans of all backgrounds will be first in line for jobs as our economy reopens.\"\n\nExceptions to the order include: healthcare workers; US military members, their spouses, and children; the spouses and minor children of US citizens; people entering for national security or law enforcement reasons; investor visas; and Iraqi and Afghan nationals who have worked for the federal government.\n\nPriscilla Alvarez, \"What Trump's New Executive Order on Immigration Covers,\" cnn.com, Apr. 23, 2020\n\nBetsy Klein, Priscilla Alvarez, and Kevin Liptak, \"Trump Claims He Will Temporarily Suspend Immigration into US due to Coronavirus Fears,\" cnn.com, Apr. 21, 2020\n\nBarbara Sprunt, \"READ: Trump Signs Proclamation Temporarily Suspending Immigration,\" npr.org, Apr. 22, 2020\n\nTwitter.com, Apr. 20, 2020\n\n- Illegal Border Crossings from Canada to US Increased 184% from 2016 to 2019\n\nIllegal border crossings from Canada to the United States increased from 558 people in 2016 to 1,586 people in 2019, according to data obtained by the Associated Press (AP) and published on May 7, 2020.\n\nThough illegal immigration via the northern border has increased, the total is less than 1% of the illegal crossings at the US/Mexico border.\n\nIn 2016, 3.6% of people crossing the northern border illegally were Mexican. That percentage jumped to 28% in 2019. Romanians, including many ethnic Roma, Haitians, and Indians were among other nationalities crossing the border illegally.\n\nWilson Ring, \"US Northern Border Illegal Crossings Rise; Many Are Mexicans,\" apnews.com, May 7, 2020\n\n- Supreme Court Declines to Hear Sanctuary Policy Case\n\nThe Supreme Court declined to review United States v. California, No. 19-532. As a result, the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruling stands, allowing California's sanctuary policy to remain in effect. The lower court ruling stated that the policy \"may well frustrate the federal government’s immigration enforcement efforts... [But] whatever the wisdom of the underlying policy adopted by California, that frustration is permissible, because California has the right.\"\n\nThe Trump administration petitioned the Supreme Court for review of the lower court ruling, arguing that sanctuary policies conflicted with federal law and posed a public safety risk. The petition stated, \"When officers are unable to arrest aliens — often criminal aliens — who are in removal proceedings or have been ordered removed from the United States, those aliens instead return to the community, where criminal aliens are disproportionately likely to commit crimes.\"\n\nAdam Liptak, \"Supreme Court Won’t Hear Case on California Sanctuary Law,\" nytimes.com, June 15, 2020\n\n- Supreme Court Blocks Effort to End DACA\n\nOn June 18, 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration had not given adequate justification for ending the program, leaving DACA in place. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the opinion, \"The dispute before the Court is not whether [Department of Homeland Security] may rescind DACA. All parties agree that it may. The dispute is instead primarily about the procedure the agency followed in doing so.\"\n\nJohn Kruzel, \"Supreme Court Blocks Trump Plan to End DACA Program,\" thehill.com, June, 18, 2020\n\n- Some Immigrations Fees to Increase\n\nAccording to the Aug. 3, 2020 Federal Register, the Department of Homeland Security will raise some immigration and naturalization fees beginning on Oct. 2, 2020. Online naturalization application fees will increase from $640 to $1,160. The US will join only three other countries (Australia, Fiji, and Iran) that charge a fee for asylum seekers with a $50 charge. A proposed $275 DACA renewal fee was scrapped and genealogy fees will be lowered.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security, \"U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Fee Schedule and Changes to Certain Other Immigration Benefit Request Requirements,\" federal register.gov, Aug. 3, 2020\n\nGeneva Sands, \"US to Raise Naturalization Application Fees by $500,\" cnn.com, July 31, 2020\n\n[Editor’s Note: Judge Jeffrey White, US District Judge of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, blocked the fee increase on Sep. 30, 2020. He wrote, “Plaintiffs persuasively argue that the public interest would be served by enjoining or staying the effective date of the Final Rule because if it takes effect, it will prevent vulnerable and low-income applicants from applying for immigration benefits, will block access to humanitarian protections, and will expose those populations to further danger… Plaintiffs also cite comments and research that argue the public at large would be harmed if the Final Rule goes into effect because it will negatively impact tax revenues and would delay individuals seeking to naturalize from participating in essential civic activities like voting, service in public office, and jury service.

Applicants now must study a list of 128 potential questions, as opposed to 100 potential questions.\n\n18 possible questions were removed (11 that had simple answers), and were replaced with more nuanced, complicated questions that could have subjective answers such as \"Why did the United States enter the Vietnam War?\" and \"Supreme Court Justices serve for life. Why?\"\n\nOther questions' answers were revised. For example, the answer to \"Who does a US Senator represent?\" used to be \"all people of the state.\" Now the correct answer for the test is \"citizens in the state.\"\n\nCritics say the test is now unnecessarily difficult, requires a higher level of English fluency, and accuse the administration of limiting citizenship for political reasons.

Biden’s order stated, “The United States was built on a foundation of religious freedom and tolerance, a principle enshrined in the United States Constitution. Nevertheless, the previous administration enacted a number of Executive Orders and Presidential Proclamations that prevented certain individuals from entering the United States — first from primarily Muslim countries, and later, from largely African countries. Those actions are a stain on our national conscience and are inconsistent with our long history of welcoming people of all faiths and no faith at all.”\n\nJoseph R.

The order stated, “At no point since our Nation’s Founding has a person’s immigration status alone served as a basis for excluding that person from the total population count used in apportionment.” President Trump had pushed to have undocumented immigrants not counted as residents, presumably to reapportion House seats away from states with high numbers of undocumented immigrants.\n\nJoseph R.

It is a waste of money that diverts attention from genuine threats to our homeland security. My Administration is committed to ensuring that the United States has a comprehensive and humane immigration system that operates consistently with our Nation’s values...

Existing enrollees were allowed to remain in the program while the ruling allowed time for the government to consider changes to the program and continue litigation.

Children traveling without parents of guardians, nearly 147,000, arrived in the largest numbers since 2008 when the government began tracking unaccompanied kids. The number of migrant families dropped about 48,000 from the last surge in 2019.\n\nThough people from Mexico represented the largest portion of migrants, agents detained people from more than 160 countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America.\n\nEileen Sullivan and Miriam Jordan, \"Illegal Border Crossings, Driven by Pandemic and Natural Disasters, Soar to Record High,\" nytimes.com, Oct. 22, 2021\n\n- Immigration Arrests Drop under Biden Administration\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) made more than 74,000 administrative immigration arrests in fiscal year 2021, down from over 100,000 yearly under the Trump administration. Deportations also dropped from 185,884 in 2020 to about 59,000 in 2021.
