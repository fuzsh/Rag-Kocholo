When the Seventh Zionist Congress in 1905 rejected that idea to settle Jews in East Africa, Zangwill established the Jewish Territorial Organization to seek an immediate homeland for the Jewish people. Because of Arab resistance, he declared political Zionism dead in 1923.\n\nPhoto: George Grantham Bain Collection, U.S. Library of Congress"
