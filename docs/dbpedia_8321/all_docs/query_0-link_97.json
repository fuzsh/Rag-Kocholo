        "text": "First published in 1899, “Without Prejudice” contains a selection of the author’s work which appeared in the “Pall Mall Magazine” in the 1890s. Contents include: “A Vision Of The Burden Of Man: Which May Serve To Introduce The Introduction”, “Tuning Up”, “Art In England”, “Bohemia And Verlaine”, “The Indestructibles”, “Concerning General Elections”, “The Realistic Novel”, “In Defence of Gambling”, “Truly Rural”, “Opinions of the Young Fogey”, “Critics and People”, etc.\n\nIsrael Zangwill (1864–1926). Zangwill was a leading figure in cultural Zionism during the 19th century, as well as close friend of father of modern political Zionism, Theodor Herzl. In later life, he renounced the seeking of a Jewish homeland in Palestine. A notable portion of Zangwill’s work concentrated on ghetto life and earned him the nickname “the Dickens of the Ghetto”. Other notable works by this author include: “Dreamers of the Ghetto” (1898), “Grandchildren of the Ghetto” (1892 ), and “Children of the Ghetto: A Study of a Peculiar People” (1892). This classic work is being republished now in a new edition complete with an introductory chapter from “English Humourists of To-Day” by J. A. Hammerton."
