But the one man who responds to her profile, a man calling himself Tony Fortin, is not who he says he is. Linda recognises him immediately. He’s Marcus, her second husband. But that’s impossible. Marcus died eight months ago. He drowned off the coast of Corfu.\n\n3 out of 5 stars\n\nTedious Read\n\nBy Jazzyjane on 07-13-24\n\nDracula [Audible Edition]\n\nBy: Bram Stoker\n\nNarrated by: Alan Cumming, Tim Curry, Simon Vance, and others\n\nLength: 15 hrs and 27 mins\n\nUnabridged\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 35,174\n\nPerformance\n\n5 out of 5 stars 31,814\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 31,724\n\nThe modern audience hasn't had a chance to truly appreciate the unknowing dread that readers would have felt when reading Bram Stoker's original 1897 manuscript. Most modern productions employ campiness or sound effects to try to bring back that gothic tension, but we've tried something different. By returning to Stoker's original storytelling structure - a series of letters and journal entries voiced by Jonathan Harker, Dr. Van Helsing, and other characters - with an all-star cast of narrators, we've sought to recapture its originally intended horror and power.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nIS THAT NOT SO?\n\nBy Jim \"The Impatient\" on 11-05-15\n\nThe House on the Water\n\nA Novella\n\nBy: Margot Hunt\n\nNarrated by: Taylor Schilling\n\nLength: 2 hrs and 47 mins\n\nOriginal Recording\n\nOverall\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 14,972\n\nPerformance\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 13,704\n\nStory\n\n4.5 out of 5 stars 13,656\n\nEvery year, Caroline Reed takes a trip with her best friend, Esme Lamont. They’re usually accompanied by their spouses - but this year, everything’s changed. Esme has just gone through a bitter divorce, and Caroline's wondering if her own marriage is reaching its breaking point as she and her husband, John, cope with the discovery that their son has been abusing drugs. Still, the inseparable duo books a weeklong stay at a beach-front home in Shoreham, Florida, inviting Esme’s brother, Nick, and his new husband. After a blissful first night in the vacation home, tragedy strikes.\n\n5 out of 5 stars\n\nWonderful Story\n\nBy David M.
