        "text": "Israel Zangwill (born February 14, 1864, London, England—died August 1, 1926, Midhurst, West Sussex) was a novelist, playwright, and Zionist leader, one of the earliest English interpreters of Jewish immigrant life.\n\nThe son of eastern European immigrants, Zangwill grew up in London’s East End and was educated at the Jews’ Free School and at the University of London. His early writings were on popular subjects of his day, but with Children of the Ghetto: A Study of a Peculiar People (1892), he drew on his intimate knowledge of ghetto life to present a gallery of Dickensian portraits of Whitechapel immigrant Jews struggling to survive in a new environment. The novelty of the subject, enhanced by Zangwill’s emphasis on the Jews’ exotic traits and by his simulation in English of Yiddish sentence structure, aroused great interest. Other works of Jewish content include a picaresque novel, The King of Schnorrers (1894), concerning an 18th-century rogue, and Dreamers of the Ghetto (1898), essays on famous Jewish figures, including Benedict de Spinoza, Heinrich Heine, and Ferdinand Lassalle. The image of America as a crucible wherein the European nationalities would be transformed into a “new race” owes its origin to the title and theme of Zangwill’s play The Melting Pot (1908)."
