        "text": "(1864–1926). British novelist and playwright Israel Zangwill was a Zionist leader and one of the earliest English interpreters of Jewish immigrant life. The title of his play The Melting Pot (1908), referring to assimilation into U.S. culture by immigrants, became one of America’s most lasting and controversial metaphors.\n\nThe son of eastern European immigrants, Zangwill was born on February 14, 1864, in London, England. He grew up in London’s East End and was educated at the Jews’ Free School and at the University of London. His early writings were on popular subjects of his day, but with Children of the Ghetto: A Study of a Peculiar People (1892) he drew on his intimate knowledge of ghetto life to present a gallery of Dickensian portraits of Whitechapel immigrant Jews struggling to survive in a new environment. The novelty of the subject, enhanced by Zangwill’s emphasis on the Jews’ exotic traits and by his simulation in English of Yiddish sentence structure, aroused great interest."
