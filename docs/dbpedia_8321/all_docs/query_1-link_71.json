His father, Moses Zangwill, was from what is now Latvia, and his mother, Ellen Hannah Marks Zangwill, was from what is now Poland. He dedicated his life to championing the cause of people he considered oppressed, becoming involved with topics such as Jewish emancipation, Jewish assimilation, territorialism, Zionism, and women's suffrage. His brother was novelist Louis Zangwill.\n\nZangwill received his early schooling in Plymouth and Bristol. When he was nine years old, Zangwill was enrolled in the Jews' Free School in Spitalfields in east London, a school for Jewish immigrant children. The school offered a strict course of both secular and religious studies while supplying clothing, food, and health care for the scholars; presently one of its four houses is named Zangwill in his honour. At this school he excelled and even taught part-time, eventually becoming a full-fledged teacher. While teaching, he studied for his degree from the University of London, earning a BA with triple honours in 1884.\n\nCareer\n\nWritings\n\nZangwill published some of his works under the pen-names J. Freeman Bell (for works written in collaboration), Countess von S., and Marshallik.\n\nCharles Dickens · George Gissing\n\nIsrael Zangwill: The Melting Pot\n\nIsrael Zangwill: The Melting Pot\n\nThe protagonist of the play, David, emigrates to America after the Kishinev pogrom in which his entire family is killed. He writes a great symphony named \"The Crucible\" expressing his hope for a world in which all ethnicity has melted away, and becomes enamored of a beautiful Russian Christian immigrant named Vera. The dramatic climax of the play is the moment when David meets Vera's father, who turns out to be the Russian officer responsible for the annihilation of David's family. Vera's father admits guilt, the symphony is performed to accolades, David and Vera live happily ever after, or, at least, agree to wed and kiss as the curtain falls.\n\n\"Melting Pot celebrated America's capacity to absorb and grow from the contributions of its immigrants.\" Zangwill was writing as \"a Jew who no longer wanted to be a Jew. His real hope was for a world in which the entire lexicon of racial and religious difference is thrown away.\"\n\nJules Furthman\n\nIsrael Zangwill: Merely Mary Ann · Israel Zangwill: The Melting Pot\n\nBenedictus de Spinoza · Heinrich Heine · Ferdinand Lassalle\n\nIsrael Zangwill: The Big Bow Mystery\n\nIsrael Zangwill: The Big Bow Mystery\n\nPolitics\n\nIsrael Zangwill: The Melting Pot\n\nHerzl Tivadar\n\nZangwill is inaccurately known for creating the slogan \"A land without a people for a people without a land\" describing Zionist aspirations in the Biblical land of Israel. He did not invent the phrase; he acknowledged borrowing it from Lord Shaftesbury. In 1853, during the preparation for the Crimean War, Shaftesbury wrote to Foreign Secretrary Aberdeen that Greater Syria was \"a country without a nation\" in need of \"a nation without a country... Is there such a thing? To be sure there is, the ancient and rightful lords of the soil, the Jews!\" In his diary that year he wrote \"these vast and fertile regions will soon be without a ruler, without a known and acknowledged power to claim dominion. The territory must be assigned to some one or other... There is a country without a nation; and God now in his wisdom and mercy, directs us to a nation without a country.\" Shaftesbury himself was echoing the sentiments of Alexander Keith, D.D.\n\nIn 1902, Zangwill wrote that Palestine \"remains at this moment an almost uninhabited, forsaken and ruined Turkish territory\". However, within a few years, Zangwill had \"become fully aware of the Arab peril\", telling an audience in New York, \"Palestine proper has already its inhabitants. The pashalik of Jerusalem is already twice as thickly populated as the United States\" leaving Zionists the choice of driving the Arabs out or dealing with a \"large alien population\". He moved his support to the Uganda scheme, leading to a break with the mainstream Zionist movement by 1905. In 1908, Zangwill told a London court that he had been naive when he made his 1901 speech and had since \"realized what is the density of the Arab population\", namely twice that of the United States. In 1913 he criticised those who insisted on repeating that Palestine was \"empty and derelict\" and who called him a traitor for reporting otherwise.\n\nAccording to Ze'ev Jabotinsky, Zangwill told him in 1916 that, \"If you wish to give a country to a people without a country, it is utter foolishness to allow it to be the country of two peoples. This can only cause trouble. The Jews will suffer and so will their neighbours. One of the two: a different place must be found either for the Jews or for their neighbours\".\n\nIn 1917, he wrote \"'Give the country without a people,' magnanimously pleaded Lord Shaftesbury, 'to the people without a country.' Alas, it was a misleading mistake. The country holds 600,000 Arabs.\"\n\nZangwill died in 1926 in Midhurst, West Sussex.\n\nPersonal life\n\nOther works\n\nIsrael Zangwill: The Big Bow Mystery · Israel Zangwill: The Melting Pot · Israel Zangwill: Merely Mary Ann\n\nFilmography\n\nIsrael Zangwill: The Melting Pot · Israel Zangwill: Merely Mary Ann · Israel Zangwill: Mary Ann · Israel Zangwill: The Big Bow Mystery\n\nBibliography\n\nReferences\n\nJonathan Sacks\n\nOwn writing\n\nBibliography\n\nExternal links"
