        "text": "This survey of collective biographies in Anglo-Jewish history, as opposed to one of individual biographies, covers two main activities. The first is the simple collection of biographical accounts. In the briefest version, this may be a list of individuals each furnished with just one or two lines of notes, as found in Albert Hyamson’s “Plan of a Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish Biography” (1949). 1 Fuller versions may be represented by the accounts in, say, Who’s Who or the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (hereafter, ODNB) or, regarding specifically Anglo-Jewish works, by the final biographical section (from the 1897/8 edition onwards) of the Jewish Year Book, or by Paul Emden’s Jews of Britain, published in 1944, 2 or by the Palgrave Dictionary of Anglo-Jewish History, published in 2011. 3 All these Anglo-Jewish publications are described below.\n\nThe second activity is the compilation and presentation of a comprehensive biographical database comprising lists or tabulations, systematicallyarranged, of information relating to British Jews in respect of any chosen set of particulars, such as attainments, vocations, posts, qualifications, awards, and any other characteristic or aptitude. Such lists include MPs, mayors, senior law officers, QCs, FRSs, musicians, academics, and so on. Lists of this nature may be found in the penultimate section of the Jewish Year Book or in my Directory of Distinguished British Jews. 4 In this survey, the term “collective biography” is limited to printed works published on a national rather than an institutional or local basis, written exclusively in the English language, relating to British Jews of the post-Resettlement period. A chronological survey of the development of collective biography of British Jews is presented.\n\nNotes"
