        "text": "The Melting-Pot by Israel Zangwill\n\nIsrael Zangwill was born in London on 21st January 1864, to a family of Jewish immigrants from the Russian Empire.\n\nZangwill was initially educated in Plymouth and Bristol. At age 9 he was enrolled in the Jews' Free School in Spitalfields in east London. Zangwill excelled here. He began to teach part-time at the school and eventually full time. Whilst teaching he also studied with the University of London and by 1884 had earned his BA with triple honours in philosophy, history, and the sciences.\n\nHis writing earned him the sobriquet the Dickens of the Ghetto primarily based on his much lauded novel ‘Children of the Ghetto: A Study of a Peculiar People’ in 1892 and its glimpse of the poverty-stricken life in London's Jewish quarter.\n\nAs a writer he was keen to reflect on his political and social outlooks. His simulation of Yiddish sentence structure in English aroused great interest. His mystery work, ‘The Big Bow Mystery’ (1892) was the first locked room mystery novel.\n\nZangwill was also involved with narrowly focused Jewish issues as an assimilationist, an early Zionist, and later a territorialist. In the early 1890s he had joined the Lovers of Zion movement in England. In 1897 he joined Theodor Herzl (considered the father of modern political Zionism) in founding the World Zionist Organization.\n\nZangwill quit the established philosophy of Zionism when his plan for a homeland in Uganda was rejected and founded his own organisation; the Jewish Territorialist Organization. Its stated goal was to create a Jewish homeland in whatever territory in the world could be found for them.\n\nAmongst the challenges in his life he found time to write poetry. He had translated a medieval Jewish poet in 1903 and his volume ‘Blind Children’ in 1908 shows his promise in this new endeavour.\n\n‘The Melting Pot’ in 1909 made Zangwill’s name as an admired playwright. When the play opened in Washington D.C., former President Theodore Roosevelt leaned over the edge of his box and shouted, That's a great play, Mr. Zangwill, that's a great play.\n\nIsrael Zangwill died on 1st August 1926 in Midhurst, West Sussex.\n\nIndex of Contents\n\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\n\nACT I\n\nACT II\n\nACT III\n\nACT IV\n\nAFTERWORD\n\nISRAEL ZANGWILL – A SHORT BIOGRAPHY\n\nISRAEL ZANGWILL – A CONCISE BIBLIOGRAPHY\n\nDRAMATIS PERSONAE\n\nDavid Quixano\n\nMendel Quixano\n\nBaron Revendal\n\nQuincy Davenport, Jr.\n\nHerr Pappelmeister\n\nVera Revendal\n\nBaroness Revendal\n\nFrau Quixano\n\nKathleen O'Reilly\n\nSettlement Servant\n\nACT I\n\nThe scene is laid in the living-room of the small home of the QUIXANOS in the Richmond or non-Jewish borough of New York, about five o'clock of a February afternoon. At centre back is a double street-door giving on a columned veranda in the Colonial style. Nailed on the right-hand door-post gleams a Mezuzah, a tiny metal case, containing a Biblical passage. On the right of the door is a small hat-stand holding MENDEL'S overcoat, umbrella, etc. There are two windows, one on either side of the door, and three exits, one down-stage on the left leading to the stairs and family bedrooms, and two on the right, the upper leading to KATHLEEN'S bedroom and the lower to the kitchen. Over the street door is pinned the Stars-and-Stripes. On the left wall, in the upper corner of which is a music-stand, are bookshelves of large mouldering Hebrew books, and over them is hung a Mizrach, or Hebrew picture, to show it is the East Wall. Other pictures round the room include Wagner, Columbus, Lincoln, and Jews at the Wailing place. Down-stage, about a yard from the left wall, stands DAVID'S roll-desk, open and displaying a medley of music, a quill pen, etc. On the wall behind the desk hangs a book-rack with brightly bound English books. A grand piano stands at left centre back, holding a pile of music and one huge Hebrew tome. There is a table in the middle of the room covered with a red cloth and a litter of objects, music, and newspapers. The fireplace, in which a fire is burning, occupies the centre of the right wall, and by it stands an armchair on which lies another heavy mouldy Hebrew tome. The mantel holds a clock, two silver candlesticks, etc. A chiffonier stands against the back wall on the right. There are a few cheap chairs. The whole effect is a curious blend of shabbiness, Americanism, Jewishness, and music, all four being combined in the figure of MENDEL QUIXANO, who, in a black skull-cap, a seedy velvet jacket, and red carpet-slippers, is discovered standing at the open street-door. He is an elderly music master with a fine Jewish face, pathetically furrowed by misfortunes, and a short grizzled beard.\n\nMENDEL\n\nGood-bye, Johnny!... And don't forget to practise your scales.\n\n[Shutting door, shivers.\n\nUgh! It'll snow again, I guess.\n\n[He yawns, heaves a great sigh of relief, walks toward the table, and perceives a music-roll.\n\nThe chump! He's forgotten his music!\n\n[He picks it up and runs toward the window on the left, muttering furiously.\n\nBrainless, earless, thumb-fingered Gentile!\n\n[Throwing open the window.\n\nHere, Johnny! You can't practise your scales if you leave 'em here!\n\n[He throws out the music-roll and shivers again at the cold as he shuts the window.\n\nUgh! And I must go out to that miserable dancing class to scrape the rent together.\n\n[He goes to the fire and warms his hands.\n\nAch Gott! What a life! What a life!\n\n[He drops dejectedly into the armchair. Finding himself sitting uncomfortably on the big book, he half rises and pushes it to the side of the seat. After an instant an irate Irish voice is heard from behind the kitchen door.\n\nKATHLEEN [Without]\n\nDivil take the butther! I wouldn't put up with ye, not for a hundred dollars a week.\n\nMENDEL [Raising himself to listen, heaves great sigh]\n\nAch! Mother and Kathleen again!\n\nKATHLEEN [Still louder]\n\nPots and pans and plates and knives! Sure 'tis enough to make a saint chrazy.\n\nFRAU QUIXANO [Equally loudly from kitchen]\n\nWos schreist du? Gott in Himmel, dieses Amerika!\n\nKATHLEEN [Opening door of kitchen toward the end of FRAU QUIXANO'S speech, but turning back, with her hand visible on the door]\n\nWhat's that ye're afther jabberin' about America? If ye don't like God's own counthry, sure ye can go back to your own Jerusalem, so ye can.\n\nMENDEL\n\nOne's very servants are anti-Semites.\n\nKATHLEEN [Bangs her door as she enters excitedly, carrying a folded white table-cloth. She is a young and pretty Irish maid-of-all-work]\n\nBad luck to me, if iver I take sarvice again with haythen Jews.\n\n[She perceives MENDEL huddled up in the armchair, gives a little scream, and drops the cloth.\n\nOch, I thought ye was out!\n\nMENDEL [Rising]\n\nAnd so you dared to be rude to my mother.\n\nKATHLEEN [Angrily, as she picks up the cloth]\n\nShe said I put mate on a butther-plate.\n\nMENDEL\n\nWell, you know that's against her religion.\n\nKATHLEEN\n\nBut I didn't do nothing of the soort. I ounly put butther on a mate-plate.\n\nMENDEL\n\nThat's just as bad. What the Bible forbids—\n\nKATHLEEN [Lays the cloth on a chair and vigorously clears off the litter of things on the table]\n\nSure, the Pope himself couldn't remimber it all. Why don't ye have a sinsible religion?\n\nMENDEL\n\nYou are impertinent. Attend to your work.\n\n[He seats himself at the piano.\n\nKATHLEEN\n\nAnd isn't it laying the Sabbath cloth I am?\n\n[She bangs down articles from the table into their right places.\n\nMENDEL\n\nDon't answer me back.\n\n[He begins to play softly.\n\nKATHLEEN\n\nFaith, I must answer somebody back—and sorra a word of English she understands. I might as well talk to a tree.\n\nMENDEL\n\nYou are not paid to talk, but to work.\n\n[Playing on softly.\n\nKATHLEEN\n\nAnd who can work wid an ould woman nagglin' and grizzlin' and faultin' me?\n\n[She removes the red table-cloth.\n\nMate-plates, butther-plates, kosher, trepha, sure I've smashed up folks' crockery and they makin' less fuss ouver it.\n\nMENDEL [Stops playing]\n\nBreaking crockery is one thing, and breaking a religion another. Didn't you tell me when I engaged you that you had lived in other Jewish families?\n\nKATHLEEN [Angrily]\n\nAnd is it a liar ye'd make me out now? I've lived wid clothiers and pawnbrokers and Vaudeville actors, but I niver shtruck a house where mate and butther couldn't be as paceable on the same plate as eggs and bacon—the most was that some wouldn't ate the bacon onless 'twas killed kosher.\n\nMENDEL [Tickled]\n\nHa! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!\n\nKATHLEEN [Furious, pauses with the white table-cloth half on]\n\nAnd who's ye laughin' at? I give ye a week's notice. I won't be the joke of Jews, no, begorra, that I won't.\n\n[She pulls the cloth on viciously.\n\nMENDEL [Sobered, rising from the piano]\n\nDon't talk nonsense, Kathleen. Nobody is making a joke of you. Have a little patience—you'll soon learn our ways.\n\nKATHLEEN [More mildly]\n\nWhose ways, yours or the ould lady's or Mr. David's? To-night being yer Sabbath, you'll be blowing out yer bedroom candle, though ye won't light it; Mr. David'll light his and blow it out too; and the misthress won't even touch the candleshtick. There's three religions in this house, not wan.\n\nMENDEL [Coughs uneasily]\n\nHem! Well, you learn the mistress's ways—that will be enough.\n\nKATHLEEN [Going to mantelpiece]\n\nBut what way can I understand her jabberin' and jibberin'?—I'm not a monkey!\n\n[She takes up a silver candlestick.\n\nWhy"
