I remember back in 2003 I presented you with an Order of Friendship when I was in your country.\n\nOver the years, we have maintained, by and large, fairly good relations between our countries. In the first eight months of the current year bilateral trade grew by over 60 percent. However, much can still be done, and much, I think, could have been done in previous years.\n\nI am very pleased to see you and discuss all these opportunities.\n\nPrime Minister of Malaysia Mahathir Mohamad: I am very glad indeed to meet you again. I hope that with our meeting we can look into the relationship between Malaysia and Russia. I hope that we can increase our trade. Our trade is quite good, but we can do better.\n\nThere is an economic, scientific, technical and cultural agreement.\n\nRemark: We are now finalising the co-chair of the committee, and once we finalise that, we can continue with the meeting.\n\nMahathir Mohamad: As you know, we have a number of Russian aircraft. I think we need to learn more about how to maintain and repair the aircraft.\n\n<…>"
