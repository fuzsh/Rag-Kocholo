        "text": "Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMalaysia\n\nGet more with myNEWS\n\nA personalised news feed of stories that matter to you\n\nLearn more\n\nMalaysia’s Mahathir Mohamad back in heart hospital as corruption probe circles sons\n\nNews of the ex-PM’s hospitalisation emerged after his lawyer told a Kuala Lumpur court his client was unable to attend a defamation hearing\n\nIt comes as Malaysia’s anti-corruption agency expands its probe on two of his sons, instructing them to file asset declarations that go back to 1981\n\nFormer Malaysian prime minister Mahathir Mohamad has spent over a fortnight at a specialised cardiac unit in Kuala Lumpur, his office revealed on Tuesday, as a high-profile corruption investigation closes in on two of the 98-year-old’s sons.\n\nNews of his hospitalisation came after his lawyer, Mior Nor Haidir Suhaimi, told a Kuala Lumpur court that his ageing client is unable to attend a defamation hearing as he has been admitted to the National Heart Institute (IJN) since January 26.\n\n“Tun Mahathir is currently receiving treatment for infection at IJN, followed by a subsequent rest period for optimal recovery,” a spokesperson from Mahathir’s office said.\n\nMahathir has been given medical leave until next week, the aide added.\n\nIt is the latest hospital stay for the nonagenarian after he was admitted in August last year.\n\nStill, Mahathir has remained a vocal and pugnacious presence on Malaysia’s political scene, where his bitter rival Anwar Ibrahim now helms the country as prime minister.\n\nMahathir’s critical voice was notably absent following the news of former prime minister Najib Razak’s 12-year prison term being halved by Malaysia’s king, Sultan Abdullah on February 2, his last act in a five-year reign.\n\n11:20\n\nThe legacy of Malaysia’s 1MDB scandal on politics and corruption-fighting\n\nThe legacy of Malaysia’s 1MDB scandal on politics and corruption-fighting\n\nMahathir, who first served as premier for 22 years from 1981 and then again in 2018 after beating Najib at the polls, was last seen in public at a press conference on January 22.\n\nThere he questioned the anti-corruption investigation into his son Mirzan and challenged Anwar and his administration to investigate him instead.\n\nMahathir’s adversarial relationship with Anwar, which soured in 1998 resulting in the latter’s sacking from being his deputy – and later incarceration – continues to shape Malaysian politics, with both slinging mud at each other over the issue of corruption.\n\nClose ally Daim Zainuddin and his wife Naimah were slapped with corruption charges at the Kuala Lumpur court in January.\n\nThe Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission (MACC) expanded its probe to include Mahathir’s second son Mokhzani, instructing the brothers to file asset declarations that go back to 1981, when Mahathir first became prime minister.\n\nIn a joint statement last week, the brothers pleaded for patience from the MACC, saying their demand amounts to “an impossible endeavour”."
