Officially he does not hold any political office, but his views and influence still prevail. He was largely responsible for deposing his handpicked successor, Abdullah Badawi, and he is in the process of trying to do the same to the current PM Najib Razak.\n\nBut Malaysian society has moved beyond Mahathir especially in the non-political arena. Malaysian youths are now more open and largely influenced by social media, as can be seen in Barisan Nasional's loss of the popular vote in the 2013 general. At the same time, Malaysian society has become more Islamic and conservative. The government is still pursuing Anwar Ibrahim, Mahathir's nemesis, through the courts.\n\nThis collection of essays will look at how Malaysian society has evolved in the past decade without Mahathir as PM. While there are groups in Malaysia that would like to see the return of Mahathirism, others are questioning if Malaysia is heading in the right direction or Malaysia should return to Mahathir-type policies.\n\n(singapore: marshall cavenish 2015)\n\nAfter the failure of the 2013 KL Talks, Thailand's newly installed military government initiated a new round of peace talks with insurgent representatives collectively known as MARA.

The MARA initiative lasted for four years. In this article, I put forward the argument that, although different in some respects, peace talks between insurgent representatives and the Thai state between 2015 and 2019 suffered from the same shortcomings as previous attempts at peace talks for the southern provinces (2006 - 2014). I will also argue that the MARA initiative has been the last in a list of false starts at building a credible peace process for the south since the conflict began in 2004 and that developments in January 2020 should be interpreted as a turning point for the conflict.\n\nThe present study examines selected speeches of a non-Western leading politician as an attempt to widen the scope of rhetorical studies from different cultures and to address the lack of studies from non-Western societies.

The study conducts a rhetorical analysis of selected speeches of Mahathir Mohamad (the fourth Prime Minister of Malaysia) to identify and interpret his language use as a means to persuade his audience to accept or follow a specific course of action. This study explores logos, ethos, and pathos as a means of persuasion demonstrating how they are utilized by Mahathir Mohamad to influence his audience. The findings revealed that logical, ethical and emotional proofs were used for this purpose. Together logos and pathos projected Mahathir's ethos, that is, his credibility as a person, as a persuasive mean. Supportive rhetorical techniques such as examples, parallelisms, rhetorical questions and metaphors were used to enhance Mahathir's argument and to add clarity and conciseness to the argument. INTRODUCTION The study of rhetoric and persuasion should be encouraged because our society can profit from a general awareness of persuasion as a mode of social change and influence. Lessl (2005) emphasizes the importance of rhetoric because the study of rhetoric helps us to understand the processes of communication which underpin making decisions. He adds that understanding the rhetoric of a society tells us about its culture, beliefs, ideas, and assumptions. The recent period has witnessed an interest among researchers to understand the nature of rhetoric and the application of rhetorical techniques in persuasion. However, the study of rhetoric does not cover all societies; it still focuses on the West today. This focus of rhetorical studies on the West has created a lack of knowledge about the rhetorical techniques and the ways of argumentation in non-Western communities. This study is a modest attempt to address the lack of rhetorical studies from the non-Western societies. It is designed to examine how language is utilized by a prominent non-Western orator as a means of\n\nMalaysia had looked to Japan to search for a sustainable and efficient development model under the Look East Policy (LEP) initiative launched in 1982 by former Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad.

At the time, this ideal formula, intended for the betterment of the Malaysian economy, was designed to incorporate the Japanese attitude to work, their moral values, progressive norms, and work ethics. Since then, more than 15,000 Malaysians expatriated to Japan due to this very purpose, and bilateral relations between them have blossomed. In this paper,\n\nthe LEP is revisited, and Japan-Malaysia relations will be analysed to understand the change and continuity aspects of this policy in the past 35 years. Furthermore, this paper will also seek to forecast the challenges Japanese and Malaysian institutions may face in establishing cooperation under the second phase of this policy after\n\n35 years of success. Besides, exploring a new paradigm for Japan and Malaysia’s relations as proposed by the former Prime Minister, Mohd Najib Tun Abdul Razak.\n\nThe present study examines selected speeches of a non-Western leading politician as an attempt to widen the scope of rhetorical studies from different cultures and to address the lack of studies from non-Western societies.

When Tun Dr. Mahathir Mohamad took over the administration, Japanese investment in the country has been growing rapidly as Japan emerged as the largest trading partner of Malaysia. The consequence of crisis with the British government witness by 1982 Japan’s position in Malaysia has further strengthened through the implementation of the Look East Policy. Through this policy, the Japanese management system and work ethic has been widely publicized to continue the pro-Japanese orientation. Although researcher found too many previous studies on Japanese investment in Malaysia, this study will complement previous studies by the data collected from different sources from previous researchers. The different data will also provide new insight to the reader about the history of Japanese investments in this period. The main focus of the Japanese investments directed at the investment date, the parties involved, the amount of capital, total employees, location and sector expertise.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY • After its impressive electoral triumph in the 2018 general election, the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition suffered three back-to-back by-election defeats at the hand of the Barisan Nasional (BN) in 2019 in Peninsular... more\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY • After its impressive electoral triumph in the 2018 general election, the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition suffered three back-to-back by-election defeats at the hand of the Barisan Nasional (BN) in 2019 in Peninsular Malaysia. • Opposition parties UMNO and PAS cooperated and won in the Cameron Highland, Semenyih, and Rantau by-elections. Issues concerning Malay rights, the institution of the Malay rulers, and the role of Islam were central to their campaign. • This paper examines whether PH's recent poor showing in Peninsular Malaysia manifests a decline in support, particularly among the Malays. It argues that although the by-election results are not representative of sentiments across Malaysia, they demonstrate how the opposition can thwart PH's reform efforts by playing up issues concerning Malay identity. • The emerging discourse serves as a reminder to the PH government that while it seeks to reform the economy, settle the country's debt, and reform institutions, it has to deal with the disgruntled Malay ground. Still, PH's pragmatic and ideologically ambiguous coalition may serve its purpose in the long run, especially in a more diverse Malaysia not only divided by race, but by class as well.\n\nThe collapse of Malaysia’s multiethnic reformist government by a party coup in February 2020 called “Sheraton Move” can be assessed along at least three dimensions: first, inter-personality-clash power struggle between key Malay leaders... more\n\nThe collapse of Malaysia’s multiethnic reformist government by a party coup in February 2020 called “Sheraton Move” can be assessed along at least three dimensions: first, inter-personality-clash power struggle between key Malay leaders and their parties; second, the deep ethnic divide which drives for rejection of a multiethnic government in favour of return to a more pro-Malay equilibrium; third, dysfunctional legislative-executive relations and dysfunctional parties, which reduce Parliament to the Prime Minister’s electoral college, deny constructive roles in policy competition and law-making to opposition parliamentarians and government backbenchers, so centralise power within parties that cyclical infighting and splintering is made inevitable, collectively making the party system vulnerable to defections and chaotic realignments. This paper focuses on the parliament-party dimension and examines how Malaysia’s deviations from the Westminster model have contributed to the political impasse, how the payroll vote is cynically used to sustain a fragile government and how keeping the system unchanged may lead to greater instability and cause multiparty democracy to be discredited.\n\nApparently, the role of media in politics including the political partying is unquestionable.

To date, an effectively use\n\nof media for the purpose of political\n\nhegemony by the ruling elite party is\n\naccepted as a phenomenon or common\n\npractice. Since taking over the leadership\n\nas the President of United Malaya\n\nNational Organization (UMNO) and\n\nPrime Minister of Malaysia, Tun Dr.\n\nMahathir Mohamad has shown his\n\nstrength and capability in controlling and\n\nmanipulating media particularly in\n\nmanaging crises throughout his era of\n\nadministration. This study which\n\nembraces a library research method –\n\nbooks, websites, and journals, discovered\n\nthat there are two approaches of control\n\nover the media available in Malaysia -\n\nlaws and ownership is believed to be\n\nbeneficial and helpful for Mahathir’s\n\nadministrative style and Malaysian\n\npolitics at large. Consequently, the study\n\n(which is interdisciplinary between\n\npolitical science and communication) had\n\nalso analyzed the strategies taken by the\n\nprime minister as a tool in strengthening\n\nthe 22 years of his political career and his\n\nhegemony as the Prime Minister of\n\nMalaysia.\n\nMany people were surprised by the sudden fall of Mahathir Mohamad and the Pakatan Harapan (PH) government on 21 February 2020, barely two years after winning the historic May 2018 general elections.

This article argues that the fall was largely due to the following factors: the ideology of Ketuanan Melayu Islam (Malay Islam Supremacy); the Mahathir-Anwar dispute; Mahathir's own role in trying to reduce the role of the non-Malays in the government; and the manufactured fear among the Malay polity that the Malays and Islam were under threat. It concludes that the majority of the Malay population, and the Malay establishment, are not ready to share political power with the non-Malays.///// Email me if you want a copy of the full paper ////"
