He has a history of heart problems and has undergone bypass surgeries.\n\nMahathir had been scheduled to attend a court proceeding on Tuesday but failed to show up, according to a report by state news agency Bernama.\n\nHis lawyer told the court Mahathir had been admitted at the National Heart Institute since Jan. 26, Bernama reported.\n\nAn aide of Mahathir confirmed he was hospitalised but was unable to provide further details.\n\nMahathir served as prime minister for 22 years until 2003. He returned as premier in 2018 after leading the opposition coalition to a historic win, but his government collapsed in less than two years due to infighting."
