        "text": "Early Life and Career\n\nDatuk Seri Mahathir bin Mohamad was born in Alor Setar, Kedah (now in Malaysia), on July 10, 1925, though his birth date is officially recorded as December 20. His name is also spelled Mahathir bin Mohamed (or Muhammed). The son of a schoolmaster, he attended Sultan Abdul Hamid College and the University of Malaya in Singapore, where he studied medicine. After graduating in 1953, he worked as a government medical officer until 1957. He then entered private practice.\n\nMahathir was first elected to parliament in 1964. He was a member of the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), the dominant political party within the ruling governmental coalition. Mahathir served in parliament until 1969. In 1974 he was reelected to parliament and appointed minister of education. In 1976 Mahathir became deputy prime minister, and in June 1981 he was elected president of UMNO.\n\nPrime Ministership\n\nMahathir became prime minister of Malaysia in July 1981. He was the first commoner to hold that office. He remained in office for more than 20 years, and his long tenure gave Malaysia the political stability needed for economic growth. Mahathir welcomed foreign investment, reformed the tax structure, and reduced trade tariffs. He also turned many state-owned industries over to private ownership. Mahathir sought to bridge Malaysia’s ethnic divisions by increasing general prosperity and eliminating poverty among all the country’s people. Under Mahathir’s leadership, Malaysia prospered economically. The manufacturing sector grew. The middle class expanded, literacy rates rose, and life expectancies increased.\n\nIn the late 1990s, however, Malaysia’s economy entered an economic depression. This caused a split between Mahathir and his apparent successor, Anwar Ibrahim, who was deputy prime minister and minister of finance. Anwar’s support of open markets and international investments was in opposition to Mahathir’s growing distrust of the West. In 1998 Anwar was dismissed from his posts and arrested. A wave of antigovernment demonstrations swept the country, with protesters calling for Mahathir to resign. Nevertheless, Mahathir continued to shore up his power.\n\nMahathir often criticized the West. He raised the ire of many foreign governments and many non-Muslims in particular by attacking Jews in a major speech. He delivered the speech just days before he retired as prime minister in 2003. In 2008, after UMNO and its partners lost their two-thirds legislative majority for the first time in several decades, Mahathir withdrew from the party.\n\nMahathir largely retired from public life in 2008. He later emerged as a fierce critic of Prime Minister Najib Razak, who had become embroiled in a massive financial scandal. Mahathir announced in January 2018 that he would stand as a candidate for prime minister for a coalition of opposition parties in the general election. He pledged that if he were elected, he would step down after two years and cede the office to Anwar. In a stunning upset, the 92-year-old Mahathir won a narrow majority in the elections of May 2018. His coalition claimed 122 of the 222 seats, and Mahathir was sworn in as prime minister.\n\nOne of Mahathir’s first acts in office was to ask Malaysia’s king to pardon Anwar. Anwar was released days later and soon resumed his political career. The alliance between Mahathir and Anwar was shaky at best, however, and the exact terms of the promised succession were never spelled out. In late February 2020, two months before the proposed handover of power, Mahathir suddenly resigned as prime minister. The deal with Anwar was ended, and a politcal crisis resulted. The king appointed Mahathir as temporary prime minister and met with members of parliament to try to resolve the crisis. Although Mahathir and Anwar soon reached a new agreement, the king announced that UMNO candidate Muhyiddin Yassin would be Malaysia’s prime minister (rather than Anwar). Muhyiddin took office in March."
