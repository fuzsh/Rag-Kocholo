        "meta_description": "Mahathir Mohamad is the former prime minister of Malaysia. A trained doctor, he had two stints in power - the first from 1981 to 2003 when he led the Barisan Nasional ruling coalition and the second from 2018 to February 24, 2020, when he was backed by the Pakatan Harapan ruling coalition. Mahathir had joined forces with his on-again, off-again rival Anwar Ibrahim to pull off a surprise election victory in 2018 to oust disgraced former leader Najib Razak, who has been implicated in a multi-billion dollar scandal involving state investment firm 1MDB.",

        "text": "It is the second time the 99-year-old former prime minister has been hospitalised this year.\n\nNurul Izzah Anwar says social media is a key driver behind the societal shift, which has seen the conservative ‘green wave’ sway voters and split the country.\n\nThe decision to invite Lockheed Martin and BAE to a government-backed expo has raised questions about the consistency of PM Anwar Ibrahim’s criticism of the Gaza war with the actions of his government.\n\nWithout a formidable and charismatic replacement, People’s Justice Party of Malaysia remains firmly wedded to its president’s political fortunes – leaving a political outfit that one insider described as ‘paralysed’.\n\nMahathir, 98, questions why the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission has concluded he committed an offence when he is not formally being investigated.\n\nA Malaysian public that’s accustomed to politics shaping prosecutions largely sees PM Anwar Ibrahim following in the footsteps of his predecessors, while his allies walk free.\n\nMahathir Mohamad’s two eldest sons have revealed for the first time in an interview that a months-long anti-corruption investigation is targeting their 98-year-old father.\n\nMahathir, 98, went into the National Heart Institute on January 26 due to an unspecified infection and has remained in hospital since for observation.\n\nMalaysia has announced a goal to create five domestic US$1 billion ‘unicorns’ by 2025 as part of its plan to become a global start-up hub.\n\nThe order is part of an anti-graft investigation after Mirzan’s name appeared in leaks of offshore business records that were revealed by a global media network.\n\nNews of the ex-PM’s hospitalisation came after his lawyer told a Kuala Lumpur court his client was unable to attend a defamation hearing.\n\nMahathir Mohamad and Daim Zainuddin are among the old adversaries to be swept up in a wide-ranging anti-graft probe. Anwar denies he’s had a hand in it. Still, at least one observer says it’s a ‘smart move’.\n\nMahathir’s recent questioning of the Indian community’s loyalty was heavily criticised, but the debate reflects problems with Malaysia’s model of multiculturalism."
