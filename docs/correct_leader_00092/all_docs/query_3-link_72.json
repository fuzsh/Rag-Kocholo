In his public service career of over 30 years, Watanabe has held the positions of Director General for the Trade Policy at the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI) and Counsellor of the TPP Headquarters at the Cabinet Secretariat, where he was engaged in Japan’s major trade policy initiatives and negotiations in the TPP, RCEP, Japan-US Trade Agreement, Japan-UK Comprehensive Economic Partnership, and the WTO Reforms, among others.

As a member of the Type II Financial Instruments Firms Association, she took the position of deputy chair of its working group on SDGs promoting discussion in this area. She was also an expert on the “Study Group on Impact Investing,” co-sponsored by the Financial Services Agency and the GSG Domestic Advisory board. In addition, she has supported financial sector organizations in the area of climate change risk and opportunity evaluation, and sustainability-related disclosures.\n\nMr Gan Kim Yong was appointed Deputy Prime Minister when the Lawrence Wong administration took office on May 15, 2024; he also serves as Minister of Trade and Industry, a post he assumed in May 2021. One of his key priorities is to identify new growth opportunities in support of Singapore’s continued economic development. Mr Gan is also Deputy Chairman of the Monetary Authority of Singapore Board, and was co-chair of the Multi-Ministry Taskforce which directed and coordinated Singapore’s COVID-19 response until it stood down on 13 February 2023. From May 2011 to May 2021, Mr Gan was Minister for Health. He oversaw efforts to drive Healthcare 2020, a masterplan to ensure accessibility, quality and affordability of healthcare in Singapore. Under his leadership, the Ministry of Health invested significantly in building new healthcare infrastructure, and expanded the polyclinic and General Practitioner networks. Enhancements to long-term care financing measures were also launched, and a universal lifelong medical insurance was introduced.
