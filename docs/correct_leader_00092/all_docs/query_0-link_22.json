        "text": "In February, Mahathir Mohamed was the prime minister of Malaysia. By last week, he not only no longer held the top job, he had been fired from his own party, Bersatu.\n\nThe political crisis that culminated in Dr Mahathir's resignation in late February came as the country was emerging as the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak in South-East Asia.\n\nIt left Malaysia temporarily without a government — with no health minister — in the middle of a global pandemic.\n\nDr Mahathir won a historic election in 2018. His Pakatan Harapan coalition unseated a government after six decades and he took the prime ministership for the second time.\n\nBut now, the 94-year-old appears to finally have been outmanoeuvred.\n\nSo, how did one of the most powerful figures in Malaysian history find himself in this position? And where is the country headed?\n\nWhy did Mahathir lose power?\n\nOnce one of the leading strongmen in South-East Asia, the enduringly popular Mahathir Mohamad rebranded himself as a moderate and banded together with former foes to contest the 2018 national election.\n\nDr Mahathir was personally credited with the Pakatan Harapan (Pact of Hope) coalition's victory over the Barisan Nasional coalition, which had dominated politics from the foundation of Malaysia in the 1960s.\n\nPakatan Harapan faced a rocky first two years in government, however, as it faced a series of scandals and struggled to implement promised reforms under its progressive manifesto.\n\nPotential enemies loomed in Dr Mahathir's own camp.\n\nMany in Bersatu and across its Pakatan Harapan coalition, including Dr Mahathir's former deputy and now-Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, had been members of the Barisan Nasional old guard.\n\nTheir commitment to dismantling Malaysia's longstanding race-based policies had always been questioned.\n\nA large proportion of their ethnic Malay constituents remain in favour of preserving legal and political privileges for the country's majority Malays and Muslims over ethnic Chinese and Indians and adherents of other faiths.\n\n\"Mahathir's resignation was triggered by infighting within Bersatu,\" said Piya Raj Sukhani, an analyst at the S Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore.\n\nDoes Muhyiddin have political legitimacy?\n\nUnlike pragmatic Dr Mahathir, Mr Muhyiddin is a political conservative and staunch Malay nationalist.\n\nMr Muhyiddin convinced Malaysia's King in February he had the majority support of Malaysia's 222 parliamentarians, allowing him to take power.\n\nBut according to Khoo Ying Hooi, a lecturer in international relations at the University of Malaya, \"until today, we are still in the dark as to whether Muhyiddin indeed has the majority [of] seats in the Parliament.\"\n\n\"This Government may not be the government that you voted for,\" Mr Muhyiddin said in March.\n\n\"But I want you to know that this Government cares for you.\"\n\nDr Mahathir rejects that Muhyiddin has a majority and has tabled a no-confidence vote against him.\n\n\"Muhyiddin's Government remains neither endorsed in Parliament, nor democratically mandated by the electorate,\" Ms Sukhani said.\n\nBut in a one-hour sitting of Parliament last month — allegedly due to concerns over coronavirus — Malaysia's King reaffirmed Dr Mahathir's successor as the Prime Minister.\n\nNo debate was allowed and media were not allowed in the chamber.\n\nThen last week, Mr Muhyiddin took the extraordinary step of expelling Dr Mahathir and four of his key allies from Bersatu — the party Dr Mahathir co-founded in 2016.\n\nThe Prime Minister claimed Dr Mahathir and several former ministers had violated the party constitution.\n\nDr Mahathir, however, said the expulsion \"was not valid\" and maintained he was still Bersatu party chairman.\n\nWhat will happen to Mahathir's promised reforms?\n\nFortune magazine in 2019, named Dr Mahathir as one of the world's 50 greatest leaders, alongside the likes of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, Ireland's first openly gay leader Leo Varadkar, and FIFA's first female secretary-general Fatma Samoura.\n\n\"Mahathir and his party are now moving to protect judicial independence and press freedom, recognising that they help keep a democracy honest,\" it wrote.\n\nNow, with Dr Mahathir gone, many worry this judicial independence and press freedom may be short-lived.\n\nAs the world celebrated World Press Freedom Day recently, Malaysian police said they were investigating a South China Morning Post journalist for her reporting on raids against hundreds of migrants.\n\nThe United Nations called upon Malaysia to end an \"ongoing crackdown on migrants, journalists and civil society in the context of the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and strongly oppose xenophobia and hate speech against migrants\".\n\n\"On the migrant issue alone, it has clearly shown to us that there is little commitment by this Government on the human rights front,\" said Dr Khoo.\n\nMalaysia's strict lockdown, which has now been eased, was even enforced with the military.\n\nWhat will happen to the 1MDB investigation?\n\nAuthorities in the US and Malaysia believe roughly $US4.5 billion was stolen from 1MDB, a sovereign wealth fund co-founded in 2009 by then-prime minister Najib Razak.\n\nBut critics believe the new government, which is allied with Mr Najib's party, will likely help him avoid prosecution for alleged major corruption.\n\nLast month, Mr Najib's stepson Riza Aziz, who was also a producer on the film Wolf of Wall Street, had money-laundering charges against him dropped.\n\n\"Now the kleptocrats are back because the president of the [Bersatu] party, which pledged to overthrow Najib, has brought him back,\" Dr Mahathir wrote recently on his blog.\n\n\"Those Malaysians who now brought him back are truly not ashamed of bringing back a thief to be in the Government.\"\n\nWhat next?\n\nDr Mahathir has vowed to oust Mr Muhyiddin at \"every turn\", arguing the PM only has a two-seat majority in Parliament's 222-seat Lower House.\n\n\"That is the narrowest majority any government in Malaysia ever had,\" Dr Mahathir said last month, stating that Mr Muhyiddin would be in \"very great trouble because whatever chance we have to prove that it is not legitimate for him to be the Prime Minister, we will do that\".\n\nBut Dr Mahathir's vote of no confidence — and indeed all parliamentary debate — will have to wait until July.\n\n\"Muhyiddin has the upper hand of incumbency. Hence, his access to power enables him to consolidate loyalty within [his coalition] to stabilise his leadership,\" Ms Sukhani said.\n\nIt appears Mr Muhyiddin's Government will resist calls for another national election.\n\n\"We are expected to have the next election in 2023, it is uncertain whether we will have our polls earlier in view of such strong nature of partisan politics that we have inherited,\" Dr Khoo said.\n\nProgressive Malaysians will no doubt continue to push for the reinstatement of those they democratically elected in 2018.\n\nWhat is certain, however — this dramatic saga isn't over."
