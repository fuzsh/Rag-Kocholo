        "meta_description": "Abstract. Co-occurring extreme climate events exacerbate adverse impacts on humans, the economy, and the environment relative to extremes occurring in isolation. While changes in the frequency of individual extreme events have been researched extensively, changes in their interactions, dependence, and joint occurrence have received far less attention, particularly in the East African region. Here, we analyse the joint occurrence of pairs of the following extremes within the same location and calendar year over East Africa: river floods, droughts, heatwaves, crop failures, wildfires and tropical cyclones. We analyse their co-occurrence on a yearly timescale because some of the climate extremes we consider play out over timescales up to several months. We use bias-adjusted impact simulations under past and future climate conditions from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP). We find an increase in the area affected by pairs of these extreme events, with the strongest increases for joint heatwaves and wildfires (+940â% by the end of the century under RCP6.0 relative to present day), followed by river floods and heatwaves (+900â%) and river floods and wildfires (+250â%). The projected increase in joint occurrences typically outweighs historical increases even under an aggressive mitigation scenario (RCP2.6). We illustrate that the changes in the joint occurrences are often driven by increases in the probability of one of the events within the pairs, for instance heatwaves. The most affected locations in the East Africa region by these co-occurring events are areas close to the River Nile and parts of the Congo basin. Our results overall highlight that co-occurring extremes will become the norm rather than the exception in East Africa, even under low-end warming scenarios.",

Oliveira, Joaquim G. Pinto, Alexandre M. Ramos, and Carlo De Michele\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 24, 2689–2704, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-2689-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-24-2689-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLandslides are complex phenomena causing important impacts in vulnerable areas, and they are often triggered by rainfall. Here, we develop a new approach that uses information on the temporal clustering of rainfall, i.e. multiple events close in time, to detect landslide events and compare it with the use of classical empirical rainfall thresholds, considering as a case study the region of Lisbon, Portugal. The results could help to improve the prediction of rainfall-triggered landslides.\n\nMid-Holocene climate at mid-latitudes: assessing the impact of Saharan greening\n\nMarco Gaetani, Gabriele Messori, Francesco S. R. Pausata, Shivangi Tiwari, M. Carmen Alvarez Castro, and Qiong Zhang\n\nClim. Past, 20, 1735–1759, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-20-1735-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-20-1735-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPalaeoclimate reconstructions suggest that, around 6000 years ago, a greening of the Sahara took place, accompanied by climate changes in the Northern Hemisphere at middle to high latitudes. In this study, a climate model is used to investigate how this drastic environmental change in the Sahara impacted remote regions. Specifically, climate simulations reveal significant modifications in atmospheric circulation over the North Atlantic, affecting North American and European climates.\n\nA linear assessment of barotropic Rossby wave propagation in different background flow configurations\n\nAntonio Segalini, Jacopo Riboldi, Volkmar Wirth, and Gabriele Messori\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 5, 997–1012, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-5-997-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-5-997-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nPlanetary Rossby waves are created by topography and evolve in time. In this work, an analytical solution of this classical problem is proposed under the approximation of linear wave dynamics. The theory is able to describe reasonably well the evolution of the perturbation and compares well with full nonlinear simulations. Several relevant cases with single and double zonal jets are assessed with the theoretical framework\n\nRemote carbon cycle changes are overlooked impacts of land-cover and land management changes\n\nSuqi Guo, Felix Havermann, Steven J. De Hertog, Fei Luo, Iris Manola, Thomas Raddatz, Hongmei Li, Wim Thiery, Quentin Lejeune, Carl-Friedrich Schleussner, David WÃ¥rlind, Lars Nieradzik, and Julia Pongratz\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2387,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2387, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLand-cover and land management changes (LCLMCs) can alter climate even in intact areas, causing carbon changes in remote areas. This study is the first to assess these effects, finding they substantially alter global carbon dynamics, changing terrestrial stocks by up to dozens of gigatons. These results are vital for scientific and policy assessments, given the expected role of LCLMCs in achieving the Paris Agreement’s goal to limit global warming below 1.5 °C.\n\nDynamics of stratospheric wave reflection over the North Pacific\n\nMichael K. Schutte, Alice Portal, Simon H. Lee, and Gabriele Messori\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2240,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2240, 2024\n\nThis preprint is open for discussion and under review for Weather and Climate Dynamics (WCD).\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLarge-scale motions in the atmosphere, namely atmospheric waves, greatly impact the weather that we experience at the Earth's surface. Here we investigate how waves in the troposphere (the lower 10 km of the atmosphere) and the stratosphere (above the troposphere) interact to affect surface weather. We find that tropospheric waves that are reflected back down by the stratosphere change weather patterns and temperatures in North America. These changes can indirectly affect the weather in Europe.\n\nConcurrent modes of climate variability linked to spatially compounding wind and precipitation extremes in the Northern Hemisphere\n\nBastien FranÃ§ois, Khalil Teber, Lou Brett, Richard Leeding, Luis Gimeno-Sotelo, Daniela I. V. Domeisen, Laura Suarez-Gutierrez, and Emanuele Bevacqua\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2079,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-2079, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSpatially compounding wind and precipitation (CWP) extremes can lead to severe impacts on society. We find that concurrent climate variability modes favor the occurrence of such wintertime spatially compounding events in the Northern Hemisphere, and can even amplify the number of regions and population exposed. Our analysis highlights the importance of considering the interplay between variability modes to improve risk management of such spatially compounding events.\n\nClimaMeter: contextualizing extreme weather in a changing climate\n\nDavide Faranda, Gabriele Messori, Erika Coppola, Tommaso Alberti, Mathieu Vrac, Flavio Pons, Pascal Yiou, Marion Saint Lu, Andreia N. S. Hisi, Patrick Brockmann, Stavros Dafis, Gianmarco Mengaldo, and Robert Vautard\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 5, 959–983, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-5-959-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-5-959-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe introduce ClimaMeter, a tool offering real-time insights into extreme-weather events. Our tool unveils how climate change and natural variability affect these events, affecting communities worldwide. Our research equips policymakers and the public with essential knowledge, fostering informed decisions and enhancing climate resilience. We analysed two distinct events, showcasing ClimaMeter's global relevance.\n\nFuture Changes of Compound Explosive Cyclones and Atmospheric Rivers in the North Atlantic\n\nFerran Lopez-Marti, Mireia Ginesta, Davide Faranda, Anna Rutgersson, Pascal Yiou, Lichuan Wu, and Gabriele Messori\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1711,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1711, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nExplosive Cyclones and Atmospheric Rivers are two main drivers of extreme weather in Europe. In this study, we investigate their joint changes in future climates over the North Atlantic. Our results show that both the concurrence of these events and the intensity of atmospheric rivers increase by the end of the century across different future scenarios. Furthermore, explosive cyclones associated with atmospheric rivers are longer-lasting and deeper than those without atmospheric rivers.\n\nLarge-scale perspective on extreme near-surface winds in the central North Atlantic\n\nAleksa StankoviÄ, Gabriele Messori, Joaquim G. Pinto, and Rodrigo Caballero\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 5, 821–837, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-5-821-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-5-821-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe article studies extreme winds near the surface over the North Atlantic Ocean. These winds are caused by storms that pass through this region. The strongest storms that have occurred in the winters from 1950–2020 are studied in detail and compared to weaker but still strong storms. The analysis shows that the storms associated with the strongest winds are preceded by another older storm that travelled through the same region and made the conditions suitable for development of extreme winds.\n\nGraphical representation of global water models\n\nHannes MÃ¼ller Schmied, Simon Newland Gosling, Marlo Garnsworthy, Laura MÃ¼ller, Camelia-Eliza Telteu, Atiq Kainan Ahmed, Lauren Seaby Andersen, Julien Boulange, Peter Burek, Jinfeng Chang, He Chen, Manolis Grillakis, Luca Guillaumot, Naota Hanasaki, Aristeidis Koutroulis, Rohini Kumar, Guoyong Leng, Junguo Liu, Xingcai Liu, Inga Menke, Vimal Mishra, Yadu Pokhrel, Oldrich Rakovec, Luis Samaniego, Yusuke Satoh, Harsh Lovekumar Shah, Mikhail Smilovic, Tobias Stacke, Edwin Sutanudjaja, Wim Thiery, Athanasios Tsilimigkras, Yoshihide Wada, Niko Wanders, and Tokuta Yokohata\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1303,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1303, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGlobal water models contribute to the evaluation of important natural and societal issues but are – as all models – simplified representation of the reality. So, there are many ways to calculate the water fluxes and storages. This paper presents a visualization of 16 global water models using a standardized visualization and the pathway towards this common understanding. Next to academic education purposes, we envisage that these diagrams will help researchers, model developers and data users.\n\nDo data-driven models beat numerical models in forecasting weather extremes? A comparison of IFS HRES, Pangu-Weather and GraphCast\n\nLeonardo Olivetti and Gabriele Messori\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1042,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-1042, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nData-driven models are becoming a viable alternative to physics-based models for weather forecasting up to 15 d into the future. However, it is unclear whether they are as reliable as physics-based models at forecasting weather extremes. Here, we evaluate their performance in forecasting near-surface cold, hot and windy extremes globally. We find that data-driven models can compete with physics-based models, and that the choice of best model mainly depends on region and type of extreme.\n\nBridging the gap: a new module for human water use in the Community Earth System Model version 2.2.1\n\nSabin I. Taranu, David M. Lawrence, Yoshihide Wada, Ting Tang, Erik Kluzek, Sam Rabin, Yi Yao, Steven J. De Hertog, Inne Vanderkelen, and Wim Thiery\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-362,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-362, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this study, we improve an existing climate model to account for human water usage across domestic, industrial, and agriculture purposes. With the new capabilities, the model is now better equipped for studying questions related to water scarcity in both present and future conditions under climate change. Despite the advancements, there remains important limitations in our modelling framework which requires further work.\n\nAdvances and prospects of deep learning for medium-range extreme weather forecasting\n\nLeonardo Olivetti and Gabriele Messori\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 17, 2347–2358, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2347-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-17-2347-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn the last decades, weather forecasting up to 15 d into the future has been dominated by physics-based numerical models. Recently, deep learning models have challenged this paradigm. However, the latter models may struggle when forecasting weather extremes. In this article, we argue for deep learning models specifically designed to handle extreme events, and we propose a foundational framework to develop such models.\n\nEffects of idealized land cover and land management changes on the atmospheric water cycle\n\nSteven J. De Hertog, Carmen E. Lopez-Fabara, Ruud van der Ent, Jessica Keune, Diego G. Miralles, Raphael Portmann, Sebastian Schemm, Felix Havermann, Suqi Guo, Fei Luo, Iris Manola, Quentin Lejeune, Julia Pongratz, Carl-Friedrich Schleussner, Sonia I. Seneviratne, and Wim Thiery\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 15, 265–291, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-15-265-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-15-265-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nChanges in land use are crucial to achieve lower global warming. However, despite their importance, the effects of these changes on moisture fluxes are poorly understood. We analyse land cover and management scenarios in three climate models involving cropland expansion, afforestation, and irrigation. Results show largely consistent influences on moisture fluxes, with cropland expansion causing a drying and reduced local moisture recycling, while afforestation and irrigation show the opposite.\n\nPossible role of anthropogenic climate change in the record-breaking 2020 Lake Victoria levels and floods\n\nRosa Pietroiusti, Inne Vanderkelen, Friederike E. L. Otto, Clair Barnes, Lucy Temple, Mary Akurut, Philippe Bally, Nicole P. M. van Lipzig, and Wim Thiery\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 15, 225–264, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-15-225-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-15-225-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHeavy rainfall in eastern Africa between late 2019 and mid 2020 caused devastating floods and landslides and drove the levels of Lake Victoria to a record-breaking maximum in May 2020. In this study, we characterize the spatial extent and impacts of the floods in the Lake Victoria basin and investigate how human-induced climate change influenced the probability and intensity of the record-breaking lake levels and flooding by applying a multi-model extreme event attribution methodology.\n\nTechnical Note: The Divide and Measure Nonconformity\n\nDaniel Klotz, Martin Gauch, Frederik Kratzert, Grey Nearing, and Jakob Zscheischler\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2024-59,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-2024-59, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for HESS\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe evaluation of model performance is essential for hydrological modeling. Using performance criteria requires a deep understanding of their properties. We focus on a counterintuitive aspect of the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), and show that if we divide the data into multiple parts, the overall performance can be higher than all the evaluations of the subsets. Albeit this follows from the definition of the NSE, the resulting behavior can have unintended consequences in practice.\n\nClimatology and Trends in Concurrent Temperature Extremes in the Global Extratropics\n\nGabriele Messori, Antonio Segalini, and Alexandre M. Ramos\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-2023-45,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-2023-45, 2024\n\nRevised manuscript accepted for ESD\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSimultaneous heatwaves or cold spells in remote geographical regions have potentially far-reaching impacts on society and the environment. Notwithstanding this, we have little knowledge of when and where these extreme events have occurred in the past decades. Here, we present a summary of past simultaneous heatwaves or cold spells, and provide a computer program to enable other researchers to study them.\n\nCombined impacts of climate and land-use change on future water resources in Africa\n\nCelray James Chawanda, Albert Nkwasa, Wim Thiery, and Ann van Griensven\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 28, 117–138, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-117-2024,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-28-117-2024, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAfrica's water resources are being negatively impacted by climate change and land-use change. The SWAT+ hydrological model was used to simulate the hydrological cycle in Africa, and results show likely decreases in river flows in the Zambezi and Congo rivers and highest flows in the Niger River basins due to climate change. Land cover change had the biggest impact in the Congo River basin, emphasizing the importance of including land-use change in studies.\n\nScenario setup and forcing data for impact model evaluation and impact attribution within the third round of the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP3a)\n\nKatja Frieler, Jan Volkholz, Stefan Lange, Jacob Schewe, Matthias Mengel, MarÃ­a del RocÃ­o Rivas LÃ³pez, Christian Otto, Christopher P.

The experiments are designed to test our understanding of observed changes in natural and human systems and to quantify to what degree these changes have already been induced by climate change.\n\nAn increase in the spatial extent of European floods over the last 70 years\n\nBeijing Fang, Emanuele Bevacqua, Oldrich Rakovec, and Jakob Zscheischler\n\nEGUsphere, https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2890,https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2023-2890, 2024\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use grid-based runoff from a hydrological model to identify large spatiotemporally connected flood events in Europe, assess extents' trends over the last 70 years, and attribute the trends to different drivers. Our findings reveal a general increase in flood extent, with regional variations driven by diverse factors. The study not only enables a thorough examination of flood events across multiple basins but also highlights the potential challenges arising from changing flood extents.\n\nTipping points in ocean and atmosphere circulations\n\nSina Loriani, Yevgeny Aksenov, David Armstrong McKay, Govindasamy Bala, Andreas Born, Cristiano M.

We find indications for tipping in the ocean overturning circulations and the West African monsoon, with potentially severe impacts on the Earth system and humans. Tipping in the other considered systems is considered conceivable but currently not sufficiently supported by evidence.\n\nThe link between European warm-temperature extremes and atmospheric persistence\n\nEmma Holmberg, Gabriele Messori, Rodrigo Caballero, and Davide Faranda\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 14, 737–765, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-737-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-737-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe analyse the duration of large-scale patterns of air movement in the atmosphere, referred to as persistence, and whether unusually persistent patterns favour warm-temperature extremes in Europe. We see no clear relationship between summertime heatwaves and unusually persistent patterns. This suggests that heatwaves do not necessarily require the continued flow of warm air over a region and that local effects could be important for their occurrence.\n\nTIMBER v0.1: a conceptual framework for emulating temperature responses to tree cover change\n\nShruti Nath, Lukas Gudmundsson, Jonas Schwaab, Gregory Duveiller, Steven J. De Hertog, Suqi Guo, Felix Havermann, Fei Luo, Iris Manola, Julia Pongratz, Sonia I. Seneviratne, Carl F. Schleussner, Wim Thiery, and Quentin Lejeune\n\nGeosci.

Their regional impacts are key in informing national-level decisions and prioritising areas for conservation efforts. We present a first step towards exploring these regional impacts using a simple statistical device, i.e. emulator. The emulator only needs to train on climate model outputs representing the maximal impacts of aff-, re-, and deforestation, from which it explores plausible in-between outcomes itself.\n\nThe biogeophysical effects of idealized land cover and land management changes in Earth system models\n\nSteven J.

We investigate the climate effects of cropland expansion, afforestation, irrigation and wood harvesting using three Earth system models. Results show that these have important implications for surface temperature where the land cover and/or management change occur and in remote areas. Idealized afforestation causes global warming, which might offset the cooling effect from enhanced carbon uptake.\n\nEffects of idealised land cover and land management changes on the atmospheric water cycle\n\nSteven J.

In this study we use climate model simulations of extreme global land cover changes (afforestation, deforestation) and land management changes (irrigation) to understand the effects on the global water cycle and local to continental water availability. We show that cropland expansion generally leads to higher evaporation and lower amounts of precipitation and afforestation and irrigation expansion to the opposite.\n\nContinental heat storage: contributions from the ground, inland waters, and permafrost thawing\n\nFrancisco JosÃ© Cuesta-Valero, Hugo Beltrami, Almudena GarcÃ­a-GarcÃ­a, Gerhard Krinner, Moritz Langer, Andrew H.

Here, new estimates of continental heat storage are obtained, including changes in inland-water heat storage and permafrost heat storage in addition to changes in ground heat storage. We also argue that heat gains in all three components should be monitored independently of their magnitude due to heat-dependent processes affecting society and ecosystems.\n\nHeat stored in the Earth system 1960â2020: where does the energy go?\n\nKarina von Schuckmann, Audrey MiniÃ¨re, Flora Gues, Francisco JosÃ© Cuesta-Valero, Gottfried Kirchengast, Susheel Adusumilli, Fiammetta Straneo, MichaÃ«l Ablain, Richard P.

Data, 15, 1675–1709, https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-1675-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-15-1675-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEarth's climate is out of energy balance, and this study quantifies how much heat has consequently accumulated over the past decades (ocean: 89 %, land: 6 %, cryosphere: 4 %, atmosphere: 1 %). Since 1971, this accumulated heat reached record values at an increasing pace. The Earth heat inventory provides a comprehensive view on the status and expectation of global warming, and we call for an implementation of this global climate indicator into the Paris Agreementâs Global Stocktake.\n\nLarge spread in the representation of compound long-duration dry and hot spells over Europe in CMIP5\n\nColin Manning, Martin Widmann, Douglas Maraun, Anne F. Van Loon, and Emanuele Bevacqua\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 4, 309–329, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-4-309-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-4-309-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate models differ in their representation of dry spells and high temperatures, linked to errors in the simulation of persistent large-scale anticyclones. Models that simulate more persistent anticyclones simulate longer and hotter dry spells, and vice versa. This information is important to consider when assessing the likelihood of such events in current and future climate simulations so that we can assess the plausibility of their future projections.\n\nEditorial: Global warming is due to an enhanced greenhouse effect, and anthropogenic heat emissions currently play a negligible role at the global scale\n\nAxel Kleidon, Gabriele Messori, Somnath Baidya Roy, Ira Didenkulova, and Ning Zeng\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 14, 241–242, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-241-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-14-241-2023, 2023\n\nThe global atmospheric energy transport analysed by a wavelength-based scale separation\n\nPatrick Johannes Stoll, Rune Grand Graversen, and Gabriele Messori\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 4, 1–17, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-4-1-2023,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-4-1-2023, 2023\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe atmosphere is in motion and hereby transporting warm, cold, moist, and dry air to different climate zones. In this study, we investigate how this transport of energy organises in different manners. Outside the tropics, atmospheric waves of sizes between 2000 and 8000 km, which we perceive as cyclones from the surface, transport most of the energy and moisture poleward. In the winter, large-scale weather situations become very important for transporting energy into the polar regions.\n\nRiver flooding mechanisms and their changes in Europe revealed by explainable machine learning\n\nShijie Jiang, Emanuele Bevacqua, and Jakob Zscheischler\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 6339–6359, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-6339-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-6339-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nUsing a novel explainable machine learning approach, we investigated the contributions of precipitation, temperature, and day length to different peak discharges, thereby uncovering three primary flooding mechanisms widespread in European catchments. The results indicate that flooding mechanisms have changed in numerous catchments over the past 70 years. The study highlights the potential of artificial intelligence in revealing complex changes in extreme events related to climate change.\n\nHotspots and drivers of compound marine heatwaves and low net primary production extremes\n\nNatacha Le Grix, Jakob Zscheischler, Keith B. Rodgers, Ryohei Yamaguchi, and Thomas L. FrÃ¶licher\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 5807–5835, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5807-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-5807-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCompound events threaten marine ecosystems. Here, we investigate the potentially harmful combination of marine heatwaves with low phytoplankton productivity. Using satellite-based observations, we show that these compound events are frequent in the low latitudes. We then investigate the drivers of these compound events using Earth system models. The models share similar drivers in the low latitudes but disagree in the high latitudes due to divergent factors limiting phytoplankton production.\n\nA climate-change attribution retrospective of some impactful weather extremes of 2021\n\nDavide Faranda, Stella Bourdin, Mireia Ginesta, Meriem Krouma, Robin Noyelle, Flavio Pons, Pascal Yiou, and Gabriele Messori\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 3, 1311–1340, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-3-1311-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-3-1311-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe analyze the atmospheric circulation leading to impactful extreme events for the calendar year 2021 such as the Storm Filomena, Westphalia floods, Hurricane Ida and Medicane Apollo. For some of the events, we find that climate change has contributed to their occurrence or enhanced their intensity; for other events, we find that they are unprecedented. Our approach underscores the importance of considering changes in the atmospheric circulation when performing attribution studies.\n\nTiming landslide and flash flood events from SAR satellite: a regionally applicable methodology illustrated in African cloud-covered tropical environments\n\nAxel A. J. Deijns, Olivier Dewitte, Wim Thiery, Nicolas d'Oreye, Jean-Philippe Malet, and FranÃ§ois Kervyn\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 3679–3700, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-3679-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-3679-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLandslides and flash floods are rainfall-induced processes that often co-occur and interact, generally very quickly. In mountainous cloud-covered environments, determining when these processes occur remains challenging. We propose a regional methodology using open-access satellite radar images that allow for the timing of landslide and flash floods events, in the contrasting landscapes of tropical Africa, with an accuracy of up to a few days. The methodology shows potential for transferability.\n\nStratospheric downward wave reflection events modulate North American weather regimes and cold spells\n\nGabriele Messori, Marlene Kretschmer, Simon H. Lee, and Vivien Wendt\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 3, 1215–1236, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-3-1215-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-3-1215-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOver 10 km above the ground, there is a region of the atmosphere called the stratosphere. While there is very little air in the stratosphere itself, its interactions with the lower parts of the atmosphere – where we live – can affect the weather. Here we study a specific example of such an interaction, whereby processes occurring at the boundary of the stratosphere can lead to a continent-wide drop in temperatures in North America during winter.\n\nThe biogeophysical effects of idealized land cover and land management changes in Earth system models\n\nSteven J. De Hertog, Felix Havermann, Inne Vanderkelen, Suqi Guo, Fei Luo, Iris Manola, Dim Coumou, Edouard L. Davin, Gregory Duveiller, Quentin Lejeune, Julia Pongratz, Carl-Friedrich Schleussner, Sonia I. Seneviratne, and Wim Thiery\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 13, 1305–1350, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-1305-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-1305-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLand cover and land management changes are important strategies for future land-based mitigation. We investigate the climate effects of cropland expansion, afforestation, irrigation, and wood harvesting using three Earth system models. Results show that these have important implications for surface temperature where the land cover and/or management change occurs and in remote areas. Idealized afforestation causes global warming, which might offset the cooling effect from enhanced carbon uptake.\n\nMeridional-energy-transport extremes and the general circulation of Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes: dominant weather regimes and preferred zonal wavenumbers\n\nValerio Lembo, Federico Fabiano, Vera Melinda Galfi, Rune Grand Graversen, Valerio Lucariniâââââââ, and Gabriele Messori\n\nWeather Clim. Dynam., 3, 1037–1062, https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-3-1037-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/wcd-3-1037-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nEddies in mid-latitudes characterize the exchange of heat between the tropics and the poles. This exchange is largely uneven, with a few extreme events bearing most of the heat transported across latitudes in a season. It is thus important to understand what the dynamical mechanisms are behind these events. Here, we identify recurrent weather regime patterns associated with extreme transports, and we identify scales of mid-latitudinal eddies that are mostly responsible for the transport.\n\nNet irrigation requirement under different climate scenarios using AquaCrop over Europe\n\nLouise Busschaert, Shannon de Roos, Wim Thiery, Dirk Raes, and GabriÃ«lle J. M. De Lannoy\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 3731–3752, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3731-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-3731-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIncreasing amounts of water are used for agriculture. Therefore, we looked into how irrigation requirements will evolve under a changing climate over Europe. Our results show that, by the end of the century and under high emissions, irrigation water will increase by 30 % on average compared to the year 2000. Also, the irrigation requirement is likely to vary more from 1 year to another. However, if emissions are mitigated, these effects are reduced.\n\nA framework for ensemble modelling of climate change impacts on lakes worldwide: the ISIMIP Lake Sector\n\nMalgorzata Golub, Wim Thiery, Rafael MarcÃ©, Don Pierson, Inne Vanderkelen, Daniel Mercado-Bettin, R.

Model Dev., 15, 4597–4623, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-4597-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-4597-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLakes and reservoirs are warming across the globe. To better understand how lakes are changing and to project their future behavior amidst various sources of uncertainty, simulations with a range of lake models are required. This in turn requires international coordination across different lake modelling teams worldwide. Here we present a protocol for and results from coordinated simulations of climate change impacts on lakes worldwide.\n\nEvaluating a reservoir parametrization in the vector-based global routing model mizuRoute (v2.0.1) for Earth system model coupling\n\nInne Vanderkelen, Shervan Gharari, Naoki Mizukami, Martyn P. Clark, David M. Lawrence, Sean Swenson, Yadu Pokhrel, Naota Hanasaki, Ann van Griensven, and Wim Thiery\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 15, 4163–4192, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-4163-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-4163-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nHuman-controlled reservoirs have a large influence on the global water cycle. However, dam operations are rarely represented in Earth system models. We implement and evaluate a widely used reservoir parametrization in a global river-routing model. Using observations of individual reservoirs, the reservoir scheme outperforms the natural lake scheme. However, both schemes show a similar performance due to biases in runoff timing and magnitude when using simulated runoff.\n\nOn the links between sub-seasonal clustering of extreme precipitation and high discharge in Switzerland and Europe\n\nAlexandre Tuel, Bettina Schaefli, Jakob Zscheischler, and Olivia Martius\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 26, 2649–2669, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-2649-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-26-2649-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nRiver discharge is strongly influenced by the temporal structure of precipitation. Here, we show how extreme precipitation events that occur a few days or weeks after a previous event have a larger effect on river discharge than events occurring in isolation. Windows of 2 weeks or less between events have the most impact. Similarly, periods of persistent high discharge tend to be associated with the occurrence of several extreme precipitation events in close succession.\n\nExtreme weather and societal impacts in the eastern Mediterranean\n\nAssaf Hochman, Francesco Marra, Gabriele Messori, Joaquim G. Pinto, Shira Raveh-Rubin, Yizhak Yosef, and Georgios Zittis\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 13, 749–777, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-749-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-749-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nGaining a complete understanding of extreme weather, from its physical drivers to its impacts on society, is important in supporting future risk reduction and adaptation measures. Here, we provide a review of the available scientific literature, knowledge gaps and key open questions in the study of extreme weather events over the vulnerable eastern Mediterranean region.\n\nThe effects of varying drought-heat signatures on terrestrial carbon dynamics and vegetation composition\n\nElisabeth Tschumi, Sebastian Lienert, Karin van der Wiel, Fortunat Joos, and Jakob Zscheischler\n\nBiogeosciences, 19, 1979–1993, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-1979-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-19-1979-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDroughts and heatwaves are expected to occur more often in the future, but their effects on land vegetation and the carbon cycle are poorly understood. We use six climate scenarios with differing extreme occurrences and a vegetation model to analyse these effects. Tree coverage and associated plant productivity increase under a climate with no extremes. Frequent co-occurring droughts and heatwaves decrease plant productivity more than the combined effects of single droughts or heatwaves.\n\nAgricultural management effects on mean and extreme temperature trends\n\nAine M. Gormley-Gallagher, Sebastian Sterl, Annette L. Hirsch, Sonia I. Seneviratne, Edouard L. Davin, and Wim Thiery\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 13, 419–438, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-419-2022,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-13-419-2022, 2022\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur results show that agricultural management can impact the local climate and highlight the need to evaluate land management in climate models. We use regression analysis on climate simulations and observations to assess irrigation and conservation agriculture impacts on warming trends. This allowed us to distinguish between the effects of land management and large-scale climate forcings such as rising CO2 concentrations and thus gain insight into the impacts under different climate regimes.\n\nCOSMO-CLM regional climate simulations in the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) framework: a review\n\nSilje Lund SÃ¸rland, Roman Brogli, Praveen Kumar Pothapakula, Emmanuele Russo, Jonas Van de Walle, Bodo Ahrens, Ivonne Anders, Edoardo Bucchignani, Edouard L.

Model Dev., 14, 5125–5154, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-5125-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-5125-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe review the contribution from the CLM-Community to regional climate projections following the CORDEX framework over Europe, South Asia, East Asia, Australasia, and Africa. How the model configuration, horizontal and vertical resolutions, and choice of driving data influence the model results for the five domains is assessed, with the purpose of aiding the planning and design of regional climate simulations in the future.\n\nUnderstanding each other's models: an introduction and a standard representation of 16 global water models to support intercomparison, improvement, and communication\n\nCamelia-Eliza Telteu, Hannes MÃ¼ller Schmied, Wim Thiery, Guoyong Leng, Peter Burek, Xingcai Liu, Julien Eric Stanislas Boulange, Lauren Seaby Andersen, Manolis Grillakis, Simon Newland Gosling, Yusuke Satoh, Oldrich Rakovec, Tobias Stacke, Jinfeng Chang, Niko Wanders, Harsh Lovekumar Shah, Tim Trautmann, Ganquan Mao, Naota Hanasaki, Aristeidis Koutroulis, Yadu Pokhrel, Luis Samaniego, Yoshihide Wada, Vimal Mishra, Junguo Liu, Petra DÃ¶ll, Fang Zhao, Anne GÃ¤deke, Sam S. Rabin, and Florian Herz\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 14, 3843–3878, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-3843-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-14-3843-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe analyse water storage compartments, water flows, and human water use sectors included in 16 global water models that provide simulations for the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project phase 2b. We develop a standard writing style for the model equations. We conclude that even though hydrologic processes are often based on similar equations, in the end these equations have been adjusted, or the models have used different values for specific parameters or specific variables.\n\nThe remote response of the South Asian Monsoon to reduced dust emissions and Sahara greening during the middle Holocene\n\nFrancesco S. R. Pausata, Gabriele Messori, Jayoung Yun, Chetankumar A. Jalihal, Massimo A. Bollasina, and Thomas M. Marchitto\n\nClim. Past, 17, 1243–1271, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-1243-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-1243-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nFar-afield changes in vegetation such as those that occurred over the Sahara during the middle Holocene and the consequent changes in dust emissions can affect the intensity of the South Asian Monsoon (SAM) rainfall and the lengthening of the monsoon season. This remote influence is mediated by anomalies in Indian Ocean sea surface temperatures and may have shaped the evolution of the SAM during the termination of the African Humid Period.\n\nTowards a compound-event-oriented climate model evaluation: a decomposition of the underlying biases in multivariate fire and heat stress hazards\n\nRoberto Villalobos-Herrera, Emanuele Bevacqua, Andreia F. S. Ribeiro, Graeme Auld, Laura Crocetti, Bilyana Mircheva, Minh Ha, Jakob Zscheischler, and Carlo De Michele\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 1867–1885, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1867-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-21-1867-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate hazards may be caused by events which have multiple drivers. Here we present a method to break down climate model biases in hazard indicators down to the bias caused by each driving variable. Using simplified fire and heat stress indicators driven by temperature and relative humidity as examples, we show how multivariate indicators may have complex biases and that the relationship between driving variables is a source of bias that must be considered in climate model bias corrections.\n\nA standardized index for assessing sub-monthly compound dry and hot conditions with application in China\n\nJun Li, Zhaoli Wang, Xushu Wu, Jakob Zscheischler, Shenglian Guo, and Xiaohong Chen\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 1587–1601, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-1587-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-1587-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe introduce a daily-scale index, termed the standardized compound drought and heat index (SCDHI), to measure the key features of compound dry-hot conditions. SCDHI can not only monitor the long-term compound dry-hot events, but can also capture such events at sub-monthly scale and reflect the related vegetation activity impacts. The index can provide a new tool to quantify sub-monthly characteristics of compound dry-hot events, which are vital for releasing early and timely warning.\n\nCompound high-temperature and low-chlorophyll extremes in the ocean over the satellite period\n\nNatacha Le Grix, Jakob Zscheischler, Charlotte LaufkÃ¶tter, Cecile S. Rousseaux, and Thomas L. FrÃ¶licher\n\nBiogeosciences, 18, 2119–2137, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-2119-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-18-2119-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMarine ecosystems could suffer severe damage from the co-occurrence of a marine heat wave with extremely low chlorophyll concentration. Here, we provide a first assessment of compound marine heat wave and low-chlorophyll events in the global ocean from 1998 to 2018. We reveal hotspots of these compound events in the equatorial Pacific and in the Arabian Sea and show that they mostly occur in summer at high latitudes and their frequency is modulated by large-scale modes of climate variability.\n\nTechnical note: Characterising and comparing different palaeoclimates with dynamical systems theory\n\nGabriele Messori and Davide Faranda\n\nClim. Past, 17, 545–563, https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-545-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/cp-17-545-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe palaeoclimate community must both analyse large amounts of model data and compare very different climates. Here, we present a seemingly very abstract analysis approach that may be fruitfully applied to palaeoclimate numerical simulations. This approach characterises the dynamics of a given climate through a small number of metrics and is thus suited to face the above challenges.\n\nA dynamical systems characterization of atmospheric jet regimes\n\nGabriele Messori, Nili Harnik, Erica Madonna, Orli Lachmy, and Davide Faranda\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 12, 233–251, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-233-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-233-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nAtmospheric jets are a key component of the climate system and of our everyday lives. Indeed, they affect human activities by influencing the weather in many mid-latitude regions. However, we still lack a complete understanding of their dynamical properties. In this study, we try to relate the understanding gained in idealized computer simulations of the jets to our knowledge from observations of the real atmosphere.\n\nUncertainty of simulated groundwater recharge at different global warming levels: a global-scale multi-model ensemble study\n\nRobert Reinecke, Hannes MÃ¼ller Schmied, Tim Trautmann, Lauren Seaby Andersen, Peter Burek, Martina FlÃ¶rke, Simon N. Gosling, Manolis Grillakis, Naota Hanasaki, Aristeidis Koutroulis, Yadu Pokhrel, Wim Thiery, Yoshihide Wada, Satoh Yusuke, and Petra DÃ¶ll\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 25, 787–810, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-787-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-25-787-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nBillions of people rely on groundwater as an accessible source of drinking water and for irrigation, especially in times of drought. Groundwater recharge is the primary process of regenerating groundwater resources. We find that groundwater recharge will increase in northern Europe by about 19 % and decrease by 10 % in the Amazon with 3 °C global warming. In the Mediterranean, a 2 °C warming has already lead to a reduction in recharge by 38 %. However, these model predictions are uncertain.\n\nIdentifying meteorological drivers of extreme impacts: an application to simulated crop yields\n\nJohannes Vogel, Pauline Rivoire, Cristina Deidda, Leila Rahimi, Christoph A. Sauter, Elisabeth Tschumi, Karin van der Wiel, Tianyi Zhang, and Jakob Zscheischler\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 12, 151–172, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-151-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-151-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe present a statistical approach for automatically identifying multiple drivers of extreme impacts based on LASSO regression. We apply the approach to simulated crop failure in the Northern Hemisphere and identify which meteorological variables including climate extreme indices and which seasons are relevant to predict crop failure. The presented approach can help unravel compounding drivers in high-impact events and could be applied to other impacts such as wildfires or flooding.\n\nA new view of heat wave dynamics and predictability over the eastern Mediterranean\n\nAssaf Hochman, Sebastian Scher, Julian Quinting, Joaquim G. Pinto, and Gabriele Messori\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 12, 133–149, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-133-2021,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-12-133-2021, 2021\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nSkillful forecasts of extreme weather events have a major socioeconomic relevance. Here, we compare two approaches to diagnose the predictability of eastern Mediterranean heat waves: one based on recent developments in dynamical systems theory and one leveraging numerical ensemble weather forecasts. We conclude that the former can be a useful and cost-efficient complement to conventional numerical forecasts for understanding the dynamics of eastern Mediterranean heat waves.\n\nEvaluating the dependence structure of compound precipitation and wind speed extremes\n\nJakob Zscheischler, Philippe Naveau, Olivia Martius, Sebastian Engelke, and Christoph C. Raible\n\nEarth Syst.

To date it is unclear how well climate models represent such compound extremes. Here we present a new measure to assess differences in the dependence structure of bivariate extremes. This measure is applied to assess differences in the dependence of compound precipitation and wind extremes between three model simulations and one reanalysis dataset in a domain in central Europe.\n\nGlobal climate response to idealized deforestation in CMIP6 models\n\nLena R.

Arora, Lars Nieradzik, Peter Anthoni, Wim Thiery, Marysa M. LaguÃ«, Deborah Lawrence, and Min-Hui Lo\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 5615–5638, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-5615-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-5615-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe find a biogeophysically induced global cooling with strong carbon losses in a 20 million square kilometre idealized deforestation experiment performed by nine CMIP6 Earth system models. It takes many decades for the temperature signal to emerge, with non-local effects playing an important role. Despite a consistent experimental setup, models diverge substantially in their climate responses. This study offers unprecedented insights for understanding land use change effects in CMIP6 models.\n\nRisk of crop failure due to compound dry and hot extremes estimated with nested copulas\n\nAndreia Filipa Silva Ribeiro, Ana Russo, CÃ©lia Marina Gouveia, PatrÃ­cia PÃ¡scoa, and Jakob Zscheischler\n\nBiogeosciences, 17, 4815–4830, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-4815-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-17-4815-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis study investigates the impacts of compound dry and hot extremes on crop yields, namely wheat and barley, over two regions in Spain dominated by rainfed agriculture. We provide estimates of the conditional probability of crop loss under compound dry and hot conditions, which could be an important tool for responsible authorities to mitigate the impacts magnified by the interactions between the different hazards.\n\nCompound warmâdry and coldâwet events over the Mediterranean\n\nPaolo De Luca, Gabriele Messori, Davide Faranda, Philip J. Ward, and Dim Coumou\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 11, 793–805, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-793-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-793-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nIn this paper we quantify Mediterranean compound temperature and precipitation dynamical extremes (CDEs) over the 1979–2018 period. The strength of the temperature–precipitation coupling during summer increased and is driven by surface warming. We also link the CDEs to compound hot–dry and cold–wet events during summer and winter respectively.\n\nSimulating Lake Tanganyika's hydrodynamics under a changing climate\n\nKevin Sterckx, Philippe Delandmeter, Jonathan Lambrechts, Eric Deleersnijder, and Wim Thiery\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam. Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-2020-36,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-2020-36, 2020\n\nRevised manuscript not accepted\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis work covers multiple 3D simulations of the hydrodynamics of Lake Tanganyika, covering the inter-seasonal variations and the evolution linked to climate change. The research was done with COSMO-CLM2 data, which was used to run the SLIM 3D Lake Tanganyika model. The main results explain how this stratified lake can still maintain a certain mixing between the different layers, but how this would come to an end due to climate change.\n\nBrief communication: The role of using precipitation or river discharge data when assessing global coastal compound flooding\n\nEmanuele Bevacqua, Michalis I. Vousdoukas, Theodore G. Shepherd, and Mathieu Vrac\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 20, 1765–1782, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-1765-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-20-1765-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCoastal compound flooding (CF), caused by interacting storm surges and high water runoff, is typically studied based on concurring storm surge extremes with either precipitation or river discharge extremes. Globally, these two approaches show similar CF spatial patterns, especially where the CF potential is the highest. Deviations between the two approaches increase with the catchment size. The precipitation-based analysis allows for considering local-rainfall-driven CF and CF in small rivers.\n\nConcurrent wet and dry hydrological extremes at the global scale\n\nPaolo De Luca, Gabriele Messori, Robert L. Wilby, Maurizio Mazzoleni, and Giuliano Di Baldassarre\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 11, 251–266, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-251-2020,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-11-251-2020, 2020\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe show that floods and droughts can co-occur in time across remote regions on the globe and introduce metrics that can help in quantifying concurrent wet and dry hydrological extremes. We then link wet–dry extremes to major modes of climate variability (i.e. ENSO, PDO, and AMO) and provide their spatial patterns. Such concurrent extreme hydrological events may pose risks to regional hydropower production and agricultural yields.\n\nGeneralization properties of feed-forward neural networks trained on Lorenz systems\n\nSebastian Scher and Gabriele Messori\n\nNonlin. Processes Geophys., 26, 381–399, https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-26-381-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-26-381-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nNeural networks are a technique that is widely used to predict the time evolution of physical systems. For this the past evolution of the system is shown to the neural network – it is trained – and then can be used to predict the evolution in the future. We show some limitations in this approach for certain systems that are important to consider when using neural networks for climate- and weather-related applications.\n\nMinimal dynamical systems model of the Northern Hemisphere jet stream via embedding of climate data\n\nDavide Faranda, Yuzuru Sato, Gabriele Messori, Nicholas R. Moloney, and Pascal Yiou\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 10, 555–567, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-10-555-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-10-555-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe show how the complex dynamics of the jet stream at midlatitude can be described by a simple mathematical model. We match the properties of the model to those obtained by the jet data derived from observations.\n\nA new approach for assessing climate change impacts in ecotron experiments\n\nInne Vanderkelen, Jakob Zschleischler, Lukas Gudmundsson, Klaus Keuler, Francois Rineau, Natalie Beenaerts, Jaco Vangronsveld, and Wim Thiery\n\nBiogeosciences Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2019-267,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2019-267, 2019\n\nManuscript not accepted for further review\n\nWeather and climate forecasting with neural networks: using general circulation models (GCMs) with different complexity as a study ground\n\nSebastian Scher and Gabriele Messori\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 12, 2797–2809, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-2797-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-12-2797-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCurrently, weather forecasts are mainly produced by using computer models based on physical equations. It is an appealing idea to use neural networks and âdeep learningâ for weather forecasting instead. We successfully test the possibility of using deep learning for weather forecasting by considering climate models as simplified versions of reality. Our work therefore is a step towards potentially using deep learning to replace or accompany current weather forecasting models.\n\nPotential of global land water recycling to mitigate local temperature extremes\n\nMathias Hauser, Wim Thiery, and Sonia Isabelle Seneviratne\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 10, 157–169, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-10-157-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-10-157-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe develop a method to keep the amount of water in the soil at the present-day level, using only local water sources in a global climate model. This leads to less drying over many land areas, but also decreases river runoff. We find that temperature extremes in the 21st century decrease substantially using our method. This provides a new perspective on how land water can influence regional climate and introduces land water management as potential tool for local mitigation of climate change.\n\nFuture projections of temperature and mixing regime of European temperate lakes\n\nTom Shatwell, Wim Thiery, and Georgiy Kirillin\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 23, 1533–1551, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-1533-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-23-1533-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe used models to project future temperature and mixing in temperate lakes. Lakes will probably warm faster in winter than in summer, making ice less frequent and altering mixing. We found that the layers that form seasonally in lakes (ice, stratification) and water clarity affect how lakes accumulate heat. Seasonal changes in climate were thus important. This helps us better understand how different lake types respond to warming and which physical changes to expect in the future.\n\nThe effect of univariate bias adjustment on multivariate hazard estimates\n\nJakob Zscheischler, Erich M. Fischer, and Stefan Lange\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 10, 31–43, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-10-31-2019,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-10-31-2019, 2019\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nMany climate models have biases in different variables throughout the world. Adjusting these biases is necessary for estimating climate impacts. Here we demonstrate that widely used univariate bias adjustment methods do not work well for multivariate impacts. We illustrate this problem using fire risk and heat stress as impact indicators. Using an approach that adjusts not only biases in the individual climate variables but also biases in the correlation between them can resolve these problems.\n\nEstimating the effect of rainfall on the surface temperature of a tropical lake\n\nGabriel Gerard Rooney, Nicole van Lipzig, and Wim Thiery\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 6357–6369, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-6357-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-6357-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThis paper uses a unique observational dataset of a tropical African lake (L. Kivu) to assess the effect of rain on lake surface temperature. Data from 4 years were categorised by daily rain amount and total net radiation to show that heavy rain may reduce the end-of-day lake temperature by about 0.3 K. This is important since lake surface temperature may influence local weather on short timescales, but the effect of rain on lake temperature has been little studied or parametrised previously.\n\nModelling the water balance of Lake Victoria (East Africa) â PartÂ 1: Observational analysis\n\nInne Vanderkelen, Nicole P. M. van Lipzig, and Wim Thiery\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 5509–5525, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-5509-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-5509-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLake Victoria is the largest lake in Africa and one of the two major sources of the Nile river. The water level of Lake Victoria is determined by its water balance, consisting of lake precipitation and evaporation, inflow from rivers and lake outflow, controlled by two hydropower dams. Here, we present a water balance model for Lake Victoria, which closely represents the observed lake levels. The model results highlight the sensitivity of the lake level to human operations at the dam.\n\nModelling the water balance of Lake Victoria (East Africa) â Part 2: Future projections\n\nInne Vanderkelen, Nicole P. M. van Lipzig, and Wim Thiery\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 22, 5527–5549, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-5527-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-22-5527-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nLake Victoria is the second largest freshwater lake in the world and one of the major sources of the Nile River, which is controlled by two hydropower dams. In this paper we estimate the potential consequences of climate change for future water level fluctuations of Lake Victoria. Our results reveal that the operating strategies at the dam are the main controlling factors of future lake levels and that regional climate simulations used in the projections encompass large uncertainties.\n\nVarying soil moistureâatmosphere feedbacks explain divergent temperature extremes and precipitation projections in central Europe\n\nMartha M. Vogel, Jakob Zscheischler, and Sonia I. Seneviratne\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 9, 1107–1125, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-9-1107-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-9-1107-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nClimate change projections of temperature extremes are particularly uncertain in central Europe. We demonstrate that varying soil moisture–atmosphere feedbacks in current climate models leads to an enhancement of model differences; thus, they can explain the large uncertainties in extreme temperature projections. Using an observation-based constraint, we show that the strong drying and large increase in temperatures exhibited by models on the hottest day in central Europe are highly unlikely.\n\nEvaluating and improving the Community Land Model's sensitivity to land cover\n\nRonny Meier, Edouard L. Davin, Quentin Lejeune, Mathias Hauser, Yan Li, Brecht Martens, Natalie M. Schultz, Shannon Sterling, and Wim Thiery\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 4731–4757, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-4731-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-4731-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nDeforestation not only releases carbon dioxide to the atmosphere but also affects local climatic conditions by altering energy fluxes at the land surface and thereby the local temperature. Here, we evaluate the local impact of deforestation in a widely used land surface model. We find that the model reproduces the daytime warming effect of deforestation well. On the other hand, the warmer temperatures observed during night in forests are not present in this model.\n\nAsymmetric responses of primary productivity to altered precipitation simulated by ecosystem models across three long-term grassland sites\n\nDonghai Wu, Philippe Ciais, Nicolas Viovy, Alan K. Knapp, Kevin Wilcox, Michael Bahn, Melinda D.

Dangal, Stephen Sitch, Xiaoying Shi, Yingping Wang, Yiqi Luo, Yongwen Liu, and Shilong Piao\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 3421–3437, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-3421-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-3421-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur results indicate that most ecosystem models do not capture the observed asymmetric responses under normal precipitation conditions, suggesting an overestimate of the drought effects and/or underestimate of the watering impacts on primary productivity, which may be the result of inadequate representation of key eco-hydrological processes. Collaboration between modelers and site investigators needs to be strengthened to improve the specific processes in ecosystem models in following studies.\n\nA fully consistent and conservative vertically adaptive coordinate system for SLIMÂ 3D v0.4 with an application to the thermocline oscillations of Lake Tanganyika\n\nPhilippe Delandmeter, Jonathan Lambrechts, Vincent Legat, Valentin Vallaeys, Jaya Naithani, Wim Thiery, Jean-FranÃ§ois Remacle, and Eric Deleersnijder\n\nGeosci. Model Dev., 11, 1161–1179, https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-1161-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-11-1161-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe discontinuous Galerkin (DG) finite element method is well suited for the modelling of three-dimensional flows exhibiting strong density gradients. Here, a vertical adaptive mesh method is developed for DG finite element methods and implemented into SLIM 3D. This technique increases drastically the accuracy of simulations including strong stratification, without affecting the simulation cost. SLIM 3D is then used to simulate the thermocline oscillations of Lake Tanganyika.\n\nImpacts of droughts and extreme-temperature events on gross primary production and ecosystem respiration: a systematic assessment across ecosystems and climate zones\n\nJannis von Buttlar, Jakob Zscheischler, Anja Rammig, Sebastian Sippel, Markus Reichstein, Alexander Knohl, Martin Jung, Olaf Menzer, M. Altaf Arain, Nina Buchmann, Alessandro Cescatti, Damiano Gianelle, Gerard Kiely, Beverly E.

Scott, Francesco P. Vaccari, Eva van Gorsel, Andrej Varlagin, Georg Wohlfahrt, and Miguel D. Mahecha\n\nBiogeosciences, 15, 1293–1318, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-1293-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-15-1293-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nOur work systematically quantifies extreme heat and drought event impacts on gross primary productivity (GPP) and ecosystem respiration globally across a wide range of ecosystems. We show that heat extremes typically increased mainly respiration whereas drought decreased both fluxes. Combined heat and drought extremes had opposing effects offsetting each other for respiration, but there were also strong reductions in GPP and hence the strongest reductions in the ecosystems carbon sink capacity.\n\nField-based landslide susceptibility assessment in a data-scarce environment: the populated areas of the Rwenzori Mountains\n\nLiesbet Jacobs, Olivier Dewitte, Jean Poesen, John Sekajugo, Adriano Nobile, Mauro Rossi, Wim Thiery, and Matthieu Kervyn\n\nNat. Hazards Earth Syst. Sci., 18, 105–124, https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-18-105-2018,https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-18-105-2018, 2018\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWhile country-specific, continental and global susceptibility maps are increasingly available, local and regional susceptibility studies remain rare in remote and data-poor settings. Here, we provide a landslide susceptibility assessment for the inhabited region of the Rwenzori Mountains. We find that higher spatial resolutions do not necessarily lead to better models and that models built for local case studies perform better than aggregated susceptibility assessments on the regional scale.\n\nDynamical properties and extremes of Northern Hemisphere climate fields over the past 60 years\n\nDavide Faranda, Gabriele Messori, M. Carmen Alvarez-Castro, and Pascal Yiou\n\nNonlin. Processes Geophys., 24, 713–725, https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-24-713-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/npg-24-713-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe study the dynamical properties of the Northern Hemisphere atmospheric circulation by analysing the sea-level pressure, 2 m temperature, and precipitation frequency field over the period 1948–2013. The metrics are linked to the predictability and the persistence of the atmospheric flows. We study the dependence on the seasonal cycle and the fields corresponding to maxima and minima of the dynamical indicators.\n\nDetecting impacts of extreme events with ecological inÂ situ monitoring networks\n\nMiguel D. Mahecha, Fabian Gans, Sebastian Sippel, Jonathan F. Donges, Thomas Kaminski, Stefan Metzger, Mirco Migliavacca, Dario Papale, Anja Rammig, and Jakob Zscheischler\n\nBiogeosciences, 14, 4255–4277, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-4255-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-4255-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe investigate the likelihood of ecological in situ networks to detect and monitor the impact of extreme events in the terrestrial biosphere.\n\nReviews and syntheses: An empirical spatiotemporal description of the global surfaceâatmosphere carbon fluxes: opportunities and data limitations\n\nJakob Zscheischler, Miguel D.

A key challenge was to consistently combining observational products of terrestrial and aquatic surfaces. Our primary goal is to identify todayâs key uncertainties and observational shortcomings that would need to be addressed in future measurement campaigns or expansions of in situ observatories.\n\nBivariate return periods of temperature and precipitation explain aÂ large fraction of European crop yields\n\nJakob Zscheischler, Rene Orth, and Sonia I. Seneviratne\n\nBiogeosciences, 14, 3309–3320, https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-3309-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-14-3309-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe use newly established methods to compute bivariate return periods of temperature and precipitation and relate those to crop yield variability in Europe. Most often, crop yields are lower when it is hot and dry and higher when it is cold and wet. The variability in crop yields along a specific climate gradient can be captured well by return periods aligned with these gradients. This study provides new possibilities for investigating the relationship between crop yield variability and climate.\n\nMultivariate statistical modelling of compound events via pair-copula constructions: analysis of floods in Ravenna (Italy)\n\nEmanuele Bevacqua, Douglas Maraun, Ingrid HobÃ¦k Haff, Martin Widmann, and Mathieu Vrac\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 2701–2723, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-2701-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-2701-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nWe develop a conceptual model to quantify the risk of compound events (CEs), i.e. extreme impacts to society which are driven by statistically dependent climatic variables. Based on this model we study compound floods, i.e. joint storm surge and high river level, in Ravenna (Italy). The model includes meteorological predictors which (1) provide insight into the physical processes underlying CEs, as well as into the temporal variability, and (2) allow us to statistically downscale CEs.\n\nRefining multi-model projections of temperature extremes by evaluation against land–atmosphere coupling diagnostics\n\nSebastian Sippel, Jakob Zscheischler, Miguel D. Mahecha, Rene Orth, Markus Reichstein, Martha Vogel, and Sonia I. Seneviratne\n\nEarth Syst. Dynam., 8, 387–403, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-387-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/esd-8-387-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe present study (1) evaluates land–atmosphere coupling in the CMIP5 multi-model ensemble against an ensemble of benchmarking datasets and (2) refines the model ensemble using a land–atmosphere coupling diagnostic as constraint. Our study demonstrates that a considerable fraction of coupled climate models overemphasize warm-season moisture-limited climate regimes in midlatitude regions. This leads to biases in daily-scale temperature extremes, which are alleviated in a constrained ensemble.\n\nHave precipitation extremes and annual totals been increasing in the world's dry regions over the last 60Â years?\n\nSebastian Sippel, Jakob Zscheischler, Martin Heimann, Holger Lange, Miguel D. Mahecha, Geert Jan van Oldenborgh, Friederike E. L. Otto, and Markus Reichstein\n\nHydrol. Earth Syst. Sci., 21, 441–458, https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-441-2017,https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-21-441-2017, 2017\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nThe paper re-investigates the question whether observed precipitation extremes and annual totals have been increasing in the world's dry regions over the last 60 years. Despite recently postulated increasing trends, we demonstrate that large uncertainties prevail due to (1) the choice of dryness definition and (2) statistical data processing. In fact, we find only minor (and only some significant) increases if (1) dryness is based on aridity and (2) statistical artefacts are accounted for.\n\nFeasibility for detection of ecosystem response to disturbance by atmospheric carbon dioxide\n\nBjorn-Gustaf J. Brooks, Ankur R. Desai, Britton B. Stephens, Anna M. Michalak, and Jakob Zscheischler\n\nBiogeosciences Discuss., https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2016-223,https://doi.org/10.5194/bg-2016-223, 2016\n\nManuscript not accepted for further review\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nCO2 is the primary greenhouse gas, and its abundance in the atmosphere tends to increase during disturbances like drought. This paper demonstrates how CO2 measurements are combined with models to determine not only how strongly different locations influence CO2 measurement stations, but also the capacity of those measurement stations to detect drought effects. Understanding detection sensitivity will help assess what kinds of changes and turnings points can be monitored using atmospheric CO2.\n\nThe role of aerosol in altering North Atlantic atmospheric circulation in winter and its impact on air quality\n\nF. S. R. Pausata, M. Gaetani, G. Messori, S. Kloster, and F. J. Dentener\n\nAtmos. Chem. Phys., 15, 1725–1743, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-15-1725-2015,https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-15-1725-2015, 2015\n\nShort summary\n\nShort summary\n\nour study suggests that future aerosol abatement may be the primary driver of increased blocking events over the western Mediterranean. This modification of the atmospheric circulation over the Euro-Atlantic sector leads to more stagnant weather conditions that favour air pollutant accumulation especially in the western Mediterranean sector. Changes in atmospheric circulation should therefore be included in future air pollution mitigation assessments.\n\nCloud and precipitation properties from ground-based remote-sensing instruments in East Antarctica\n\nI.

The site is characterised by bimodal cloud occurrence (clear sky or overcast) with liquid-containing clouds occurring 20% of the cloudy periods. Local surface mass balance strongly depends on rare intense snowfall events. A substantial part of the accumulated snow is removed by surface and drifting snow sublimation and wind-driven snow erosion.\n\nNatural periodicities and Northern HemisphereâSouthern Hemisphere connection of fast temperature changes during the last glacial period: EPICA and NGRIP revisited\n\nT.
