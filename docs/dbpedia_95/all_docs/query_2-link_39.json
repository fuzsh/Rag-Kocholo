        "text": "The 1805 earthquake damaged a large area of the Southern Italy, destroying most of the architectural heritage in the \"Contado of Molise\", a poor region characterized by numerous medieval towns. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, the reconstruction and in fewer cases the restoration of important buildings, mainly the ecclesiastical ones, took place without a well-defined rebuilding plan. If, from a formal point of view, interesting design levels were not reached, the same cannot be stated for the construction solutions adopted, especially regarding vaulted systems. Actually, they were conceived either with wood, concrete with aggregates or full/hollow clay bricks. This variety of constructive raw elements is a direct manifestation of the richness of the vernacular constructive tradition. Moreover, the intrinsic lightness of such materials suggests as well the need at the time of new lightweight structures capable of standing on pre-existing weakened masonries. This approach was probably taken in order to reduce vulnerability and improve structural resilience to earthquakes. In light of these considerations, the paper focuses on the different construction techniques used to rebuild the vaulting systems after the 1805 earthquake in Molise, discussing their potentialities and weaknesses as well as their capacity to improve resilience in the architectural heritage.\n\nThe study of ribbed vaults in 12 th-century churches is of great interest and novelty due to certain architectural solutions that took shape in the middle decades of the century, reaching full maturity towards the end of it. Romanesque architecture in NorthWest Italy is characterised by the use of the rib vault introduced into some important monastic sites, where architectural choices made during the century were completed 1. A highly innovative element of 11 th century architecture was the use of arches extending out from the intrados of the vaults, initially limited to the perimeter of the ribs and to longitudinal and transversal elements. The first diagonal ribs began to appear towards the second half of the century. They had a rectangular section and completed the supporting structure of the panels 2 : the torus section developed at the end of the century, linked largely to the improve of monastic sites. There was a long debate regarding the effective structural function of ribbing which innovated the medieval construction techniques, and even today, despite advances in research, it isn't easy to find a univocal answer. It seems clear that ribs help support the vaults, guaranteeing better static involvement of the piers, but some collapses have proven that they are not sufficient to maintain the vault's stability. In some cases, the diagonal rib has detached itself without causing the vault to fall. The debate opened by Artur Kingsley Porter with a series of studies (from 1911) and taken up by Pol Abraham 3 analysed certain destructions of French cathedrals during the First World War, shedding doubt on the first interpretations supplied by Viollet le Duc 4. The poor static contribution made by ribbing seems to have been confirmed, while ribs played a central role in the complex construction phases. The mesh created by the diagonal ribbing helps support the vaults, acting as a sort of permanent centring. Their creation allowed a \" chain \" construction sequence, where the craftsmen removed the supports of one span and worked on the next one, while the vaults were complete in the first one using lighter wooden supports, hung from the ribbing 5. Diagonal arches also took on the role of joint covers, regulating the frequent deformations of the vaults. The study investigates an extensive area which, between the 11 th and 12 th centuries, was split between the archdiocese of Vercelli, with the dioceses of Novara, Turin, Acqui and Asti (fig.1). Romanesque architecture in NorthWest Italy was mainly characterized by the use of ribbed vaults, with diagonally reinforced arches used in some important monastic sites where the architectural choices became more specific and accomplished. The diocese of Vercelli seems to be the area where rib vaults were developed; some examples are the church of San Bernardo in Vercelli and the solutions implemented in the Badia of Dulzago and partly in San Nazzaro Sesia. Novarese architecture underwent a considerable period of experimentation during the first quarter of the 12 th century: Novara cathedral, consecrated in 1132 (and destroyed in the middle of the 19 th century), is the most evident and relevant example of pillars with diagonal lesenes, an alternate system of support, and ribbed vaults with diagonally reinforced arches. Similar solutions were also adopted in Vercelli cathedral, which also no longer exists. To trace the technical and architectural changes in rib vaulting, it was necessary to investigate the main Cistercian sites opened during the 12 th century: in particular those located in Lucedio, Tiglieto, Staffarda and Casanova, and in Rivalta Scrivia, and also Canonical of Vezzolano, where the first forms of experimentation of ribbed vaults, especially in the sections and laying of ribs, reached full maturity.\n\nVaults made by thin bricks flatly arranged started appearing in Naples during the first decades of the 19th century. There is no record of the adoption of such vaults in the previous centuries, when local materials, such as tuff and wood, represented the main employed solutions. The technique of tile vaulting was imported in Naples from Sicily where it was used, albeit discontinuously, since the 15th century thanks to the activities of the Catalan builders on the island. During the first half of the 19th century, the construction of tile vaulting in numerous royal residences of Naples was overseen by a Sicilian master builder. Presumably at such time builders from Naples lacked the specific skills to construct tile vaults, justifying the need for the supervision of a Sicilian foreman. However, it may be supposed that the Neapolitan technicians were actually aware that such construction technique was not only employed in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies but also in the nearby Papal State and in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. Moreover, the exposure to French experimentations and publications should be considered, in particular to the well-known work of the Count of Espie, who certainly played an important role in the diffusion of tile vaults in the Neapolitan area. Starting from such context, the present paper explores the motivations behind the spread of the tile vault in Naples, discusses the possible relationships with contexts and experiences of the same period and presents some significant case studies.\n\nBased on the well-established assumption that the reconstruction of the historical development of monuments constitutes a crucial prerequisite for restoration actions, this paper presents an analysis of six domes, located in Central-Eastern Sicily and built after the devastating earthquake that hit the area in 1693. The study deals with historical data, geometrical and architectural aspects, building techniques and cultural/technical factors that might have influenced the design. With the aid of laser scanning and image-based surveys, the authors have specifically investigated the theoretical and practical rules that guided the implementation of domes, with special reference to their shape. Historical construction criteria, in fact, were based more on proportional rules rather than on analytical ones. On the one hand, architects sought the ideal dome shape trying to achieve the optimal compromise between beauty and stability, on the other, specialized craftsmen put their mark on the construction with their experience and the use of local building traditions. The present analysis considers these previous factors as well as other aspects, such as the links between design and construction, local features and stylistic trends, the role of architects and workers, with the aim to widen the knowledge on domes, which are considered among the most daring structures of the past."
