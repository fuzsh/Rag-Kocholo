        "text": "Brand Portrait: Xerjoff\n\nAn aroma, a tone, a spark of memory. Color that forms into an entire ambiance. The infinite series of interconnected, synesthetic impressions. A perfume embodies the prelude to a journey of the senses initiated by fragrance.\n\nXerjoff: Picking the stars from the perfume sky\n\nGrandmothers have done many wonderful things in human history; but to have given a name to a luxury perfume house - that can only be said by one of those ladies: the grandmother of Xerjoff founder Sergio Momo.\n\nThe Croatian grandmother of the perfume visionary gave little Sergio Momo a nickname that would later make perfume history: \"Sir-joff\", which is pronounced as \"Zer-Joff\".\n\nIn 2004 this nickname became the brand name of a sparkling empire of exquisite luxury fragrances: the perfume company Xerjoff was born.\n\nThe Intention by Sergio Momo and his Xerjoff fragrances\n\nXerjoff initially started as an extension of an already existing designer business by Sergio Momo. “Perfume”, says the founder of Xerjoff, “had always been a passion in my family as stated with my father so I had the vision to combine the art of perfumery with the art of design.”.\n\nHis vision: “I wanted to create something different that harkened back to the time where perfume was very individual. Where the bottles were just as artistic as what lay inside them. Where there was no compromise to quality and materials used.\"\n\nThis is a vision he shares with designer Dominique Salvo, with whom Sergio Momo started the company Xerjoff in 2004. It took three years for this collaboration to bear fruit: the first two Xerjoff perfumes, the women's perfume Elle and the men's fragrance Homme were launched in 2007.\n\nThe founder of Xerjoff, Sergio Momo is always concerned with the true and pure in his strongly associative fragrance creations - in nature he can find all that, based on natural raw materials and free of any synthetics. Momo considers the sheer inexhaustible diversity to be discovered here, as he says, both a gift and an inspiration. To use what nature offers him in an optimal way and to transform it into high-quality fragrances is his way of accepting and appreciating this precious gift. His perfume creations were originally inspired by memories of the gardens of his childhood. Today, natural spectacles and historical influences also mingle among the impulsive elements of his work. In the process, Xerjoff's top-notch fragrances always bear witness to consummate perfection - excellence that Momo equates with absolute beauty in its aesthetics.\n\nThe Italian Soul of Niche Perfumery\n\nThe tamed wildness of his family's gardens, rank herbs growing in fertile Italian soil, lush floral arrangements, and crisp, aromatic vegetables. Fresh and wild fused into intensely vibrant compositions, these cornerstones of his work continue to haunt Sergio Momo to this day. What he creates are sensitive, magical fragrances whose magic, although intangible, has a truly striking presence. They open the mind to the landscapes of imagination and transport us to the sensual Italian gardens of his childhood days. Floral notes unfold here under the sun, the air filled with the busy hum of summer. Fruity sweetness and tart herbal notes resonate alongside the unmistakable dry clay of the baked earth - over it all hover a familiar, barely perceptible hint of nostalgia. Compositions that mirror these impressions result in an overarching, rounded reflection of nature in Xerjoff creations like the Mediterranean-citrus Naxos. Free from consumerism and stereotypes, these impressions of the clear and pristine are an invitation to let the mind wander and open to memory.\n\nXerjoff perfume thus seductively carries the buoyant lightness of Italy in all its opulence. Xerjoff's sumptuous compositions combine a variety of precious materials, some of them decidedly rare, with craftsmanship whose ancient knowledge dates back to well before our time. Based on this knowledge and complemented by the artistic influence so characteristic of Xerjoff perfumes, a fabulous world of fragrances opens up. Its radiant, timeless charm exerts an equally beguiling effect on the senses of its wearers, as well as those of the people surrounding them. Unmistakably intense yet effortlessly playful, Xerjoff's fragrances seem to be surrounded by a vital, pulsating aura.\n\nSergio Momo founded Xerjoff in 2004, dedicating his brand new artistic fragrance company to the credo \"Naturae Xquisite\" - \"Excellence Of Nature\". To this day, this clear motto has endured as Xerjoff's guiding principle and can be found in each of his special creations. Xerjoff Parfums uses exclusively and uncompromisingly natural ingredients of first-class quality for its fragrances. Synthetic substitutes, which have become widespread and are also quite respected in higher perfumery circles, are fundamentally out of the question for Momo's quality standards. Thus, for Xerjoff's Richwood XJ 17/17, not only real sandalwood is used, but the most aromatic form of the fragrant wood originating from Mysore, India. With its unique note, it gives Richwood the distinctively warm sandalwood character Momo strives for.\n\nThe Xerjoff collections\n\nSince this first step, Xerjoff has not only enriched the world of niche and luxury perfumes with the iconic design of its jewel-like bottles but also with numerous pearls of the art of perfumery. The noble fragrance compositions for women and men are categorized into different thematic collections, which are:\n\n\"V\" collection\n\n\"V\" for \"Velvet\": The \"V\" collection is all about velvet. Noble fragrances of the velvety-elegant category - iconic perfumes such as Accento or Erba Pura, for example.\n\nXJ 1861 Collection\n\nThe establishment of the Kingdom of Italy in 1861 marked a special moment in the history of the State of Italy. The Italian perfume house Xerjoff is celebrating this historic moment with the perfumes of the XJ 1861 collection.\n\nA decidedly patriotic fragrance homage to the grandeur of Italy - with perfumes that could hardly be more Italian: from the sunny Mediterranean citrus fragrance Renaissance to the great perfume hymns to Rome and Sicily, Renaissance, Zefiro, Decas and the bestseller of Xerjoff: Naxos.\n\nAnd of course, all 1861 flacons proudly wear “Verde Bianco Rosso”: the national colors of Italy.\n\nThe Oud Stars Collection by Xerjoff\n\nWith the Oud Stars collection, Xerjoff picks up on the fascination of the ultra-classy agarwood essence oud. Each of the perfumes is a fragrant testimony to pure oud distillation. The names of the noble oud scents refer to the old travel manuscript of the Arab world traveler Ibn Battuta from the 14th century.\n\nFor the fragrances of the Oud Stars collection, oud of the highest quality is extracted by means of special distillation processes on plantations in Laos, Cambodia, and Borneo. The fragrance oil from the resin of the eaglewood tree has been considered a precious component for the production of exquisite perfumes for thousands of years. The intense and mysterious character of this noble raw material forms the basis of the individual components of each Oud Stars fragrance. In the manner of traditional oriental perfume making, Xerjoff creates and manufactures perfumes such as Zafar, Gao, and Alexandria II. Like their fragrant counterparts, these historical city names, which serve as namesakes for the distinctive perfumes, already exert an inspiring fascination. They come from the writings of Ibn Battuta, whose 14th-century travel descriptions earned him the nickname \"Marco Polo of the Arab world.\"\n\nXJ Oud Collection\n\nThe XJ Oud collection is inspired by the Arab art of perfume making. A collection of noble Attar oils based on the precious agarwood essence oud, which impressively shows that the scent of oud is much more than just a trend. Popular Attar oils by Xerjoff are Ward al Oud, Kampuchea Noire and the Alexandria II Attar Oil.\n\nThe Shooting Star Collection\n\nIn February 1947 an extraordinary event occurred in eastern Siberia: a huge, shining meteor shower fell over the foothills of the Sichote-Alin Mountains. Thousands of pieces of meteorite fell from the sky to the earth. They came from a large iron meteorite weighing around 100 tons, which is known under the name Sikhote-Alin now. The loud impact noises could still be heard within a radius of 300 kilometers; a column of smoke about 30 kilometers long was still in the sky hours later and testified to the massive meteorite impact.\n\nThe Shooting Stars collection is a throwback to this memorable celestial event. All Shooting Stars fragrances have a special connection to the meteorite impact in Eastern Siberia in 1947: Each fragrance comes with a real fragment of Sikhote Alin.\n\nBy contrast, the elegant fragrance creations Uden and Nio from the Shooting Stars collection are far more ethereal, like a gift fallen from heaven. Inspired by an awe-inspiring meteor shower that fell beyond the Sikhote-Alin Mountains in the mid-20th century, each box holds a veritable meteor fragment alongside its perfume bottle. A natural spectacle wrapped in fragrance, Xerjoff presents it in a unique and sensual way.\n\nTo date, ten Xerjoff collections have been created as part of Sergio Momo's extensive exploration of the world of fragrance. In addition to his biographical, there are also various historical motifs to which Momo dedicates himself. The most popular Xerjoff Shooting Stars are: Kobe, Nio, Uden, Apollonia, and Cruz del Sur II.\n\nThe Vintage Collection Casamorati 1888\n\nFinally, the vintage line Casamorati 1888 is inextricably linked with the Xerjoff universe. The name refers to the “Fabbrica di Profumi C. Casamorati”. The historical manufacturer of soaps and perfumes once was awarded numerous prizes for its fragrance compositions and beauty products since it was founded in Bologna in 1888.\n\nIn a new edition, he succeeds in bringing Casamorati's unprecedented Art Nouveau fragrances back to life. In doing so, Xerjoff continues the story of the glorious La Fabbrica di Profumi C. Casamorati, founded by Claudio Casamorati in 19th century Bologna. As in their origins, Casamorati 1888 vintage fragrances, once world-famous and now resurrected thanks to Xerjoff, combine the historical and artistic heritage of the glamorous era of Art Nouveau. As its own collection under the name Xerjoff, of course, the Casamorati line also stands for luxurious materials of only the best quality. Perfumes from this collection, such as the incomparable fragrance Lira, exude the fragrance of a tribute to Italy's art and culture in the times of the Belle Époque. Our customers love the following Casamorati fragrances: Dama Bianca, Mefisto, Italica, and Lira.\n\nCome and Join The Club of Xerjoff\n\nWelcome to the club! The Join the Club Collection captures the eternal fascination of the exclusive, the irresistible myth of noble clubs. Sometimes it smells of Cuban cigars, sometimes of caramelized whiskey, sometimes of notes of vanilla or bergamot, sometimes of a touch of precious leather or fine make-up powder.\n\nThe deep blue perfumes delve into scenes and worlds as diverse as jazz clubs in Chicago (Kind of Blue), a Mediterranean yacht club (40 Knots), world travel and travel adventures (Ivory Route), poets and writers (More than Words), or British horse racing and polo games (Ascot Moon). Oh, even a gangster club was the inspiration of one of the JTC fragrances (Don)!\n\nIn a different context, the JTC collection is also dedicated to nostalgic flair. Under the title Join The Club, for which the acronym JTC stands, Xerjoff collects fragrances that tie in with an attitude to life associated with various groups and clubs. In a new, special way of perception, these perfumes tell their stories. Thus, in More Than Words, inspired by writer visions, it is the ramifications of imagined plot lines and the rustling of paper that can be divined. A club of literati united in the artistic temptation of the written word and rendered in an extraordinary fragrance scenario.\n\nCoffee Break Collection\n\nTime for a coffee break! With the Coffee Break Collection, Xerjoff devoted themselves to a very special olfactory subject: coffee. The fragrances of this precious collection such as Golden Dallah, Golden Moka and Golden Green are inspired by the traditional, centuries-old history of the international coffee trade.\n\n17/17 Stone Label collection\n\nThe union of man and nature is the theme of the perfumes of XJ 17/17: In a virtuoso way, they marry the divine beauty of mother earth with the limitless creative power of man. Each bottle is equipped with a hand-cut and hand-polished natural semi-precious stone. This makes each of the bottles a valuable one-of-a-kind item: no two perfume bottles are the same.\n\nXJ 17/17 was Xerjoff's very first collection; thus the two debut fragrances Elle and Homme belong to this exquisite collection of noble perfumes, for which only the best ingredients from all corners of the world are used. XJ 17/17 Symphonium is like the Holy Grail for gourmand lovers by the way.\n\nSergio Momo and the stars\n\nShooting Stars, Oud Stars: Several of the Xerjoff collections have names related to the stars. A line of Xerjoff fragrances even contains real meteorite pieces. That´s no coincidence: Sergio Momo is fascinated by the stars. \"Astronomy and the wonders of space\" is what the Xerjoff founder describes as his \"other passion besides perfume\".\n\n“Naturae Xquisite” - the excellence of nature\n\nThe noble fragrances by Xerjoff are composed under the motto \"Naturae Xquisite\". The \"excellence of nature\" is an important part of Xerjoff´s philosophy, at the core of which is a great passion for nature and its beauty. Mother nature is an inexhaustible source of inspiration for Sergio Momo and Xerjoff. Nature provides the best materials for every Xerjoff composition - and ingredients of the highest quality.\n\nMore than 130 sparkling perfume stars\n\nThe Italian empire of beautiful fragrances, Xerjoff, has now created more than 130 perfumes - composed with virtuosity by perfumers such as Chris Maurice, Jacques Flori, Miroslav Petkov, Angeline Leporini, Christian Carbonnel, Laura Santander or Mathieu Nardin.\n\nMore than 130 times they picked the most beautiful stars from perfume heaven - and generously share their sparkle and their wonders with us.\n\nThe Extraordinary Bottle Design\n\nFor Xerjoff Parfums, dedicating itself so much to beauty, sensations, and precious essences in the composition of fragrances means also paying very special attention to the design of its bottles. Like the perfumer's art, special attention is paid to its design, color scheme, and well-proportioned overall impression. While the classic shape of the bottle with its golden cap always remains unchanged, Xerjoff adapts its outer texture to the theme of its respective collection. In addition to the traditional production of transparent glass, Xerjoff has precious flacons flocked with velvet, made of quartz stone by northern Italian goldsmiths, decorated with hand-cut semi-precious stones, and made of Murano glass by a Venetian master glassblower.\n\nA Xerjoff fragrance, therefore, cannot be reduced solely to its olfactory impression but offers an additional visual as well as tactile appeal in the form of its exquisitely crafted bottle. In their entirety, Xerjoff's fragrances are thus to be understood as small works of art in their fusion of material and sublimity - they convey to their wearers the feeling of exquisite quality in perfection.\n\nOrder Xerjoff perfumes from Essenza Nobile\n\nOrder Xerjoff products in our Essenza Nobile online shop!
