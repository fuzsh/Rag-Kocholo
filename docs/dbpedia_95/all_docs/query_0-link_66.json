        "text": "Pages\n\ndescription Page 1\n\nOF THE MOREA.\n\nPART I. VVherein is shown, That the Morea is a Peninsula; the different Names by which it has been call∣ed; its Extent and Figure; the Divisions that the Ancients and Moderns have made of the Pro∣vinces contained in it: with a Discourse of its Consines and Frontiers; and at the End, seve∣ral Curious Relations are added upon the same Subject.\n\nIF a Land surrounded by the Sea, except a small Isthmus, that joyns it to the Continent, may be called a Chersonesus, or Penin∣sula, the Morea may justly be so reckon∣ed, since being on all sides environed\n\ndescription Page 2\n\nby the Sea, 'tis at the North only joyn∣ed to Achaia, by the Isthmus of Co∣rinth.\n\nThis pleasant part of Greece has not always had the Name of Morea, as 'tis now commonly called; but formerly, Argos, Apia, and Peloponnesus. Its Fi∣gure well enough resembling the Leaf of a Mulberry, or Plane-tree, gave suffi∣cient ground to the later Emperors of Constantinople to entitle it Morea; tho' some will not assent to this, but pre∣tend to derive the Name from Romea, which by a transposition of the Letters was changed into Morea, grounding themselves upon this, That the Greeks, while subject to the Empire of Con∣stantinople, and that City was stiled New Rome , were themselves also call∣ed Romei, as much as to say, Romans. Doglioni thinks that it took this Name when invaded by the Moors. Strabo insinuates, that it was anciently called Argo, or Argos, from a famous City of that Name within its Confines; and Aegialea from Aegialus, a renowned King of the Sicyonians. According to Apollodorus, and Pliny, it had the Name of Apia from Apis, the Third\n\ndescription Page 3\n\nKing of the Argives, who reigned from about the year of the World's Creation, 2307. to the year 2342. that is 1647. years before the Nativity of Christ. This Apis was the Son of Egialus. Four hundred and twenty years after, it had the Name of Pelo∣ponnesus, from Pelops, Son of Tantalus, King of Phrygia and Taygeta, a Man suf∣ficiently famous for his Ivory shoulder, and Incests with his own Daughters. Its bounds (which, as we said, are of the shape of a Plane-tree Leaf), are sixt between the end of the 35. de∣gree, and beginning of the 38. degree of North Latitude, and at the Extre∣mities of the degrees 37, and 51. of Longitude, taking the most West part of the Isle of Ferro for the first Meri∣dian.\n\nAs to its Circumserence, Authors disagree, some making it bigger, o∣thers less. Isidore allows its Circuit to be 363. Miles; Bourdon extends it to 563. Porchacchi adds Ten more, assu∣ring us, that it is 573. Miles round: Blean, Sagredo, and Vianoli, assign it 600. Baudrand, a Geographer, of our time, makes it but 550. Miles.\n\ndescription Page 4\n\nStrabo makes its length 1400. Sta∣dia; and Sagredo agrees with him, ma∣king 170. Miles from the Isthmus to Modon. Baudrand makes it five Miles longer from the Cape of Schilli to the Castle Tornese, and takes its breadth, which, according to him, exceeds not 150. Miles between Corinth and the Cape of Matapan.\n\nThe most skillful Geographers descri∣bing this delicious Peninsule, have em∣ployed the greatest accuracy in distin∣guishing those parts from the rest, whereon Nature has been at the great∣est expence for Embellishments, that they might the more advance its Glo∣ry and Reputation. As Pausanias re∣ports, it was once divided into five parts, the first containing Arcadia, the second Achaia, the third Doria, &c. Ptolemy, and others, divided it into Eight Provinces; viz. Achaia, pro∣perly so call'd, Arcadia, Argos, Corin∣thia, Elis, Laconia, Messenia, and Sicyo∣nia, or Sicyonis.\n\nAchaia was bounded on the North with the Gulf of Lepanto, on the West with the Ionian Sea, on the South with Elis and Arcadia, and on the East\n\ndescription Page 5\n\nwith Sicyonia. Patras was then its ca∣pital City.\n\nArcadia being up in the Countrey, and by consequence distant from the Sea, had for its Eastern boundaries Ar∣gos and Laconia, with the Mountain O∣ronio; Elis and Mount Flora for the Western; on the North, Achaia proper, and Mount Skinfali; and on the South, Messenia, and the Mountain Taygeta. Its principal City was Megalopolis; that is, the great Arta situated at the foot of Mount Coronio, called at this ••ime El Cesal Londari.\n\nArgos he•• •••• the East the Gulf of Napoli di ••••mania, and the Aegean ••ea; on the West, Arcadia; on the ••outh, Laconia, and on the North, the Gulf of Engia, or Sinus Sardonicus. Ar∣••os was its chief City.\n\nCorinthia, which was the most Nor∣••hern part of Peloponnesus, was extended ••etween Sicyonia Westward, and Argos ••outh and Eastward; and was separa∣••ed from Achaia by the Isthmus and Gulf of Lepanto. It took its Name ••om Corinthus, the Son of Jupiter, or •••• Ephipeus, who also gave a Name to ••e Capital City.\n\ndescription Page 6\n\nElis bordered on the North upon A∣chaia, properly so called; on the East upon Arcadia, on the South upon Mes∣senia, and on the West upon the Ionian Sea. Polybius and Strabo name this likewise Elea and Cauconia. Its prin∣cipal City was also called Elis.\n\nLaconia had for its Southern Limits partly the Gulf of Colochina, and partly that of Coron; for its Eastern, the Gulf of Napoli di Romania; for its Northern, Arcadia; and for the Western, Messenia. Sparta was its chief City.\n\nThe South of Messenia was between Laconia towards the East▪ ••nd Elis to∣wards the West: it had Arcadia on the North, and contained all that space between the Gulfs of Coron and Zon∣chio. Messene was the principal City.\n\nSicyonia, or Sicyonis, which was the least of the Provinces, took the Name from its capital City called likewise Si¦cyon. It bordered Eastwards on Corin¦thia, Westward on Achaia; the Gulf o•• Corinth was on its North, and Arcad•••• on the South.\n\nPomponius Mela divides the whol•• Morea into six Provinces; viz. Argo•• Laconia, Messenia, Achaia, Elis, and Ar¦cadia.\n\ndescription Page 7\n\nAt this time Morri and Baudrand make but four Provinces of it: and this Division is likewise approved of by the Learned Cautelli, in his Geo∣graphy, received with general Ap∣plause.\n\nThe first of th••se four Provinces [ I] comprehends the whole Extent of A∣chaia proper Sicyonia, and Corinth, and is called the Duche of Chiarenza. Its Northern bound is the Gulf of Lepanto; and on the South the Province of Bel∣vedere. This Province has several Ci∣ties and Towns. Patras is its chief City, after which Chiarenza, Caminit∣za, Castel-Torneso claim their places: but we shall reserve their description to the Second Part, where we will give par∣ticular Informations of the whole Countrey.\n\nIts most noted Promontories are the Cape de Rio, of which we will speak when we come to treat of the Gulf of Patras.\n\nAnother is the Cape by Bourdon, call∣ed the Cape de Chiarenza, and by Pto∣••emy and Strabo, Araxis Promontorium, which extends it self into the Ionian\n\ndescription Page 8\n\nSea, not far from the Mouth of the Ri∣ver Larissus, between the Gulfs of Patras and Chiarenza.\n\nThe last, lying Southward, is Cape Torneso, which Strabo called Chelonates Promontorium, Thevet Cape Thorice, and Sophianus Cape Chlumutzi. This like∣wise stretches it self into the Ionian Sea, between the Gulf of Chiarenza and that of Arcadia.\n\nThe second Province termed Bel∣vedere, [ II] reaches where Elis and Messe∣nia were formerly: It confines North∣ward on the River Carbon, which also divides it from the Province of Chia∣renza; and on the South it is bounded by the Gulf of Coron; on the East it has Braccio di Maina; and on the West the Gulf of Arcadia and Zonchio. It contains several Countries and Cities, amongst which Modon is the principal, then Coron, Calamata, and Navarin, fol∣low in dignity.\n\nThe most celebrated Promontories are Cape Jardau, which is the Ichtus Promontorium of Ptolemy, and is the most Northern of all.\n\ndescription Page 9\n\nCap de Zonchio, which Pausanias calls Coryphasium Promontorium.\n\nCap de Sapienza, or Cap Gallo, by Ptolemy named Acritas Promontorium.\n\nThe third Province is called Sacca∣nia, [ III] or the lesser Romania, and contains all the Ancient Argos. It has its North Confines on the Gulf of Lepanto, the Gulf d' Engia, and the Isthmus; its South on Braccio di Maina, and the Gulf of Napoli di Romania; its West in part on the Duche of Chiarenza, and part on Traconia. Napoli di Romania is the capital, the other chief Towns are Ar∣gos and Corinth.\n\nThe Palus, or Morass of Lerna, where Hercules killed the Seven-headed-Hydra, is a place very remarkable in this Pro∣vince.\n\nThough this Monster was but a Fi∣ction, yet it is true, that there were Seven Brethren that lived in this place, and pillaged all Passengers, making the Countrey desolate; against these Her∣cules undertook the Combate, and ha∣ving killed the first that encountered him, he dispatch'd the rest two by two, as they came under his hands. Whence\n\ndescription Page 10\n\nthe Poets took occasion to feign an Hy∣dra with Seven Heads, and its Death from that of the Seven Brethren sacri∣ficed by Hercules his Rage to the just Revenge of the Countrey.\n\nThis Province has but one Promon∣tory, but that very famous, and known by several Names. It is called Cape Shilli, in Pliny Scylaeum, and in Pausa∣nias Plethon Promontorium, by Ptolomy Scillium, by Favolius Sigillo, by Sophia∣nus Scylli, by Villanova Damala. This Promontory with its opposite, called Colonne in Attica, makes the entrance of the Gulf of Engia.\n\nThe fourth Province, which has [ IV] changed its Name, Laconia for Zaco∣nia, is the Braccio di Maina, and is at this day indifferently called by those two Names. It much surpasses the bigness of either of the three former, as it is also more extended on the South along the Sea-side. It was at first called Lelegia from Lelex, who first ru∣led there as King. Virgil, and other Poets, call it Oebalia from Oebalus, Lord thereof; and, according to Stra∣bo, 'twas likewise termed Argos. 'Tis\n\ndescription Page 11\n\nwash't on the South by the Gulf of Ca∣lamata, and in part by that of Colo∣china; on the East by the Gulf of Na∣poli di Romania; its West bounds on the Province of Belvedere, and some part of it on the Duché of Chia∣renza.\n\nThis Province has many high and dreadful Rocks and Precipices, whence 'tis subject to frequent Earthquakes. The most of its deep Caverns are found about Mount Tageta, at this time call∣ed, on the side of Misitra, Voutri tis Mi∣sitras, and on the side of the Main, Vou∣tri tis Portais.\n\nIt breeds Dogs of good esteem: Zaiman Basha, or the Grand Signior's chief Huntsman, chooses a great num∣ber of them yearly for the Sultan's use and diversions: and there is scarce a Turk that lives at any Rate, but has one of them.\n\nThe principal places of this Pro∣vince are Malvasia, Misitra, Sarnata, Chielefa, Vitulo, Paslava, and others; of which in their places.\n\nIts Promontories are the Cape of Matapàn, of which we will give a par∣ticular description when we come to\n\ndescription Page 12\n\nspeak of that of Maina. The Cape O∣nugnato, or Asses Jaw, distant from Cape Rampani about 200. Stadia; there stood once the Temple of Minerva, built by Agamemnon. The Cape of Malea brusht by the South Wind from the Sea of Candia: It is famous not only for its exquisite Wines, but also for its Shelves and Shoaly ground, dreadful to the Mariners. Ptolomy calls it Malea, Pliny Maleum, Hesychius Promaleum, So∣phianus Capo Malio. The Seamen (as Bredebachius says) name it Ale di San Michael, Saint Michael's Wings. Brichus calls it Capo Malio di Sant Angelo: accor∣ding to Baudrand 'tis Ten Miles distant from Cerigo, 90 from Napoli, 70. from Sparta, and 60. from Candia. Mention is made of this place by Virgil, Ovid, in the Universal Geography of Baudrand, and in the Greek of Laurembergius.\n\ndescription Page 13\n\nOf the Mountains of the Morea.\n\nAMongst the Mountains of this Peninsula is reckoned that of Foloe, near which was once situated the City of Olympia, so much famed by the Poets for the Country of the Centaurs. The rise of this name was thus, Hercules having slain the Nemaean Lyon, and being Victorious over the Lernaean Hydra, and the Boar of Ery∣manthus, happened to go to this Moun∣tain, where he retired into the Cave of the Centaur Foloeus, who treated him with a great deal of Civility, and entertained him with excellent Wine which he kept there hid from the rest of the Centaurs; it chanced while they were thus Carousing, some other Centaurs passing by, were drawn by the smell of the Wine, and running to the Den endeavoured to enter by Violence. Foloeus's chief en∣deavour was for an hiding place, so that Hercules was left alone to engage with all the Centaurs; he then playd his best, and gave them such terrible\n\ndescription Page 14\n\nEffects of his Rage, that having killed some, the rest betook themselves to flight to carry away a wretched Life. The Combat ended, Foloeus crept out of his hole, and sufficiently admired the Valour of his Guest; but by mis∣fortune handling the Arrow where∣with Hercules killed the Hydra, he let one of them fall on his Foot, the wound was so deep that he fell down and dyed on the spot; Hercules much grieved at this accident, and in ac∣knowledgement of his kind Entertain∣ment buried him in his own Cave, and named the Mountain from his name Foloeus.\n\nThe other most noted Mountains are Cyllene, Lyceus, Parthenius, Menalus, and Sepia; of all these Cyllenius is the highest, 'tis near that of Calidoria, at the Top whereof are yet to be seen the remains of the Temple of Mercury, from thence called Cyllenius; yet some will have that name to be derived from Cyllenus Son of Aleates. The Mountain Lyceus taking its beginning in Zaconia, is memorable for the place where the Tyrant Aristarchus was made an offering to the publick Rage of the\n\ndescription Page 15\n\nLacedemonians, who there stoned him. It joyns to Mount Menalus, which is cover'd with green and shady Groves and pleasant Pasturage for Cattel; a place for the coolness of its Shades, and refreshing briezes of serene Air de∣dicated to the God Pan, as Mount Cyllene, whose name signifies Maiden, was Sacred to the same Deity. Mount Sepia is that where, as Pausanias re∣ports, Epites, the Son of Eleates was stung to death by a Serpent. The Duché of Chiarenza has on the North the Mountain now called Poglizi from Diana's Temple which once adorned it; it was at first named Geronte, then Skinfale from the name of a Nymph, the Daughter of Arcas, or from certain large Birds of Prey called Stymphalides, that live in these quarters in great flocks: These devoured Men, where∣fore they were either chased away, or the Species quite destroyed by the slaughter Hercules made of them.\n\nOn the East side between Saccania and Tzaconia lyes Mount Cronie com∣monly called Grevenos, on whose far∣thest Northern part stood the Temple of Lucina and Fesipoli, so named from\n\ndescription Page 16\n\nthe Idol to which the Eleans offered Sacrifices. Where is found the Stone called a Cylinder which may be taken from the Rock, when the thunder rumbling in the Clouds causes an agi∣tation of the Air.\n\nIn the Province of Belvedere Mount Mintia or Mente now Olonos comes in view; its South has a Prospect of the Gulf of Coron, on the North rises the River Alpheus; it took its name from Pluto's Mistress, when Proserpina Jea∣lous of her Husband, sought after her and found her in this place, and chan∣ged her into the Herb Mint, a great quantity of which grows wild on this Mountain; and in Memory of this Act of the Infernal Goddess, the proud Fanes of Pluto and Proserpina once stood there.\n\nThe little Mount Neris lifts it self up in Saccania and Nonacris in Tzaconia, at the foot whereof roul the fatal Waves of Styx, fatal to those that taste the otherwise clear and tempting Stream. The Poets make this one of the infernal Rivers; Inachus also has its source in this Province. There is like∣wise Mount Artemisius, thought to be\n\ndescription Page 17\n\nMount Parthenius; 'twas named Arte∣misius, from the abundance of the Herb Artemis, wherewith it is covered.\n\nThe most considerable and famous of all the Grecian Mountains, and that which Polybius compares with the Alpes is Taygeta, bearing another name now of Orta, it extends it self in the Province of Tzaconia not far from the River Taenarus, very near the Eurotas that runs by Misitra; 'tis stockt with Deer, Bears, Boars and other wild Beasts: It took its name from Taygeta, the Daughter of Lacedaemon, who be∣ing ravisht by Jupiter, out of shame and grief for her lost Virginity, killed her self there. At different times this Mountain has been Sacred to Bacebus, Ceres, Apolle, and Diana; and in its Entrails are found excellent Whet∣stones.\n\nOf the Streams and Rivers of the Morea.\n\nHAving discoursed of the most re∣markable Mountains of the Mo∣rea,\n\ndescription Page 18\n\nit seems natural to descend from them with the Streams and Rivers that water the lower Grounds of this King∣dom. Amongst these is reckon'd that in the Duché of Chiarenza commonly called Carbon, and by Sophianus Orsea; Strabo names it Alpheus, Ptolemy Alpe∣hius, others Strimphalus and the River Nyctimus; into this stream One hun∣dred and forty Torrrents, whose Virtues are so extolled for taking a∣way Tetters or other deformities in the Skin. The Poets have sung a thou∣sand strange things of this River; they would perswade us that its Waves have a peculiar subterraneous Chanel under the Sea, and that passing the Arcadian Gulf without mixing with it; beyond the Strophades they haste to unite with their beloved Fountain Arethusa, which is in the Territory of Syracuse a City of Sicilia: This River receives several lesser into it, as Cela∣don, Erimantus and Amarinthus: It's name was derived from Alpheus. Tebba after the Death of his Brother Cercafus, flying from the sury of the Arcadians and despairing of e∣scape, his Enemies being at his Heels,\n\ndescription Page 19\n\ndrownded himself in this River. It formerly had the name of Strimphelus from one of the Sons of the God Mars; one may well term it the Antaeus of Ri∣vers, for after having several times in∣gulfed it self in narrow Passages under the Rocks, it breaks out at last and slides with a serene Majesty within its own Banks.\n\nThe River Eurotas is also in great Reputation, at this day called Vassali Potamos: Niger names it Iris, Plutarch Hemerus and Martathon; it passes through the middle of Misitra, and falls into the Gulf of Colchina; it has its source from the same place as the River Carbon. The name of Eurotas, so celebrated by the Ancients, was gi∣ven to it from Eurotas the third King of the Lacedemonians, either, as, Pau∣sanias reports, for that this Prince made a new Bank to this River to keep in its Waters, that sometimes u∣sed to overflow the Country to their great damage; or as Plutarch says, be∣cause that this King having lost a Bat∣tel he had engaged in before the Full Moon, in scorn of the superstitious Custome of the Lacedemonians, car∣ryed\n\ndescription Page 20\n\non by the height of Despair, cast himself into this River; which from so Tragical an Event changed the name Himerus to Eurotas. As for the name Vassali Potamos, the Inhabitants say it signifies the Imperial River, which name was imposed on it by the Despots of Morea, who descended from the Imperial Blood, and for the most part resided at Misitra, for the pleasant Diversions of Hunting, &c. on the Banks of Euretas, which the Lacedemonians called the Imperial Ri∣ver in flattery, and to enhanse the Glory of these Despots and Despoenes, a name given to the Princesses the De∣spots Wives. This Stream is still ador∣ned with Silver Swans, which here come in great flocks to sport them∣selves; these are the more admirable for their extraordinary Beauty and Size, besides their extream whiteness; possibly the Poets on this account cal∣led this River Olorifer, upon which Statius sings,\n\nTaygetique falx & oloriferi Euro••ae.\n\nAnd since its Banks were cloathed with Laurels, 'twas dedicated by the\n\ndescription Page 21\n\nPoets to Apollo; all the Summer it de∣serves not the name of a River, for 'tis so shallow, that it may rather be ta∣ken for a pretty large clear purling Brook; but in Winter encreased by the Rains, it proudly lifts it self up, and sometimes overflows its bounds. It once had on its left the Country of Ormoas, which Strabo and Pliny call Acria.\n\nThere is also in Tzaconia the River Inachus, taking its source from the Mountain Crovia; 'tis at this time cal∣led Planizza, once Cramavor, then Haliacmon; in fine, Inachus, from the name of a Son of Occanus and Thetis. The cause thus, Inachus not being able to take the Ravishing of his Daughter by Jupiter, without repining and murmuring against the deflowring God, in punishment for his Mur∣murs was so tormented by a wild Beast, that he became besotted, and pre∣cipitated himself into this Stream, which took its name from his death.\n\nBetween Inachus and Saccania are seen the Rivers Linceus, Asteria or Stella and Erasinus, which rapidly▪ wash the Foot of Mount Strimphalus.\n\ndescription Page 22\n\nWe must not forget the River Spir∣nazza, which is not the least conside∣rable: Stiled by Niger, Stomius; by Strabo and Pliny, Pamylus; and by Pto∣lomey, Panysus; it discharges it self into the Gulf of Coron near Calameta.\n\nOf the Confines and Frontiers of the Morea.\n\nTHe Morea is bounded by the Ioni∣an Sea, that of Sapienza and the Aegean; which are known by seve∣ral names, as we shall shew in their order in the second Part of this Trea∣tise.\n\nWe may take as a part of the Medi∣terranean, that Sea which Strabo and Pliny call the Ionian, and which was likewise named the Grecian, bounding Northwards upon the Mouth of the Gulf of Venice, on the West upon the Borders of Calabria and Sicilia, begin∣ning from the point of Santa Maria, and so on to the Cape of Passaro; its Eastern bounds are the Shores of Epi∣rus, and the Morea from Cape Lenguet∣ta\n\ndescription Page 23\n\nto Cape Matapan, and on the South it has the African Sea.\n\nThis Sea on its Western extent, on which side it washes the Morea, com∣prehends the following Gulfs:\n\nThe Ionian Sea com∣prehends The Gulf of Lepanto. The Gulf of Patras. The Gulf of Chiarenza. The Gulf of Arcadia. The Gulf of Zonchio.\n\nThe Sea of Sapienza, which is also a part of the Mediterranean, takes its name from the Isles near Modon, and has on the West the Ionian, and on the East the Aegaean Seas: its South beat∣ing upon the Morea includes these Gulfs.\n\nThe Sea of Sapienza includes The Gulf of Coron. The Gulf of Colochina. The Gulf of Beatico.\n\nThe Aegean Sea a part likewise of the Mediterranean, contains within its whole extent a great many Gulfs, we will only mention those on the Morean Shore.\n\ndescription Page 24\n\nThe Aegean Sea towards the Morea com∣prehends The Gulf of Napolidi Romania. The Gulf of Engia.\n\nAll Europe affords not a place com∣parable to this pleasant Peninsula, en∣richt by Nature with so many rare Qualities: Its fruitful Plains flourish with plenty, adorned with the charms of Variety; and its high Hills, which might be thought an unpleasing Ob∣ject for their cragginess, are yet made agreeable by the Verdant Crowns they wear of rare and excellent Plants and delicious Fruits. Its Inhabitants have a Genius fit for great Undertakings, and are inspired with a Martial Soul: Its Cities have all once had glorious Founders; and its Climate is soft, se∣rene and temperate.\n\nThis Place has still had the Prero∣gative, and been chief over all Greece, and indeed its main Bulwark; a thousand Illustrious Monuments pre∣sent our Eyes with Objects of Beauty, Grandeur, Magnificence, Splendor, and Glory; on the one side Sumptu∣ous and Stately Buildings raise their\n\ndescription Page 25\n\nonce proud Heads; on the other side we have the Melancholy pleasing view of the Imperial Seats of the My∣••enians, Corinthians, Lacedemonians, Si∣••yonians, Elians, Arcadians, Pyleans, and Messenians. Arms and Learning have always been the two famous Pil∣••ars set up here amongst this People, of •• Ne plus ultra to others. The Athe∣••ian School had here its Foundation, ••n whose Front were engraven these words Mater Sermonum, the Mother ••f Eloquence: Here likewise, as in ••he true Field of Mars, the most He∣••••ick Captains of Greece have poured ••ut their Blood, for never-dying ••ame. War has here either been per∣••etual, or at least frequent.\n\nAmongst all, the Athenians have ••••ew'd themselves the valiantest con∣••enders for Liberty; for from the year ••23. in the LXXXVII. Olympiad, ••o the year 350. they still defended ••hemselves, tho they had then lost ••ome of their Power. This little Re∣••ublique (its Government being only ••ltered) became after some Ages a ••reat and powerful Kingdom; when ••aving passed through several hands,\n\ndescription Page 26\n\nit at last met the beginnings and cau∣ses of its future Ruine under Emanuel the Grecian Emperor: For that Prince, ignorant of that Maxime, That the power of a Monarch is maintained by the Union of the Princes, and that a failure in this brings on the Ruine of Kings and Kingdoms, through a fatal Policy equally divided his Realms a∣mongst his seven Sons; and by that sowed the Seed of discord and in∣testine Broyls, which in the end pro∣duced the intire destruction of that Empire.\n\nThe Princes that had the Govern∣ment of this Province were stiled De∣spotes; and though there happened a frequent alteration of Governours, and those of different Extractions, yet the Despotate was still continued in its Prosperity; for the Election de∣pending on the Emperours pleasure, he seldom promoted any to this Emi∣nent Employment but his Brothers or his own Sons, or some other of his Relations, or great Favorites, who by their good Services merited so high a Recompence.\n\ndescription Page 27\n\nConstantine Sirnamed Dragares, Brother to Theodore the Second, was Despot when Amurath the First made an irruption into the Morea, and be∣gan to exercise Acts of Hostility; a stop was for some time put to the pro∣ceedings of this terrible Enemy, but 'twas upon this Condition, which the prudent Emperour proposed, of pay∣ing an annual Tribute, and with that price bought his Peace; a while after this having taken the Imperial Crown in the City of Constantinople, he divi∣ded the Morea between his two Bro∣thers Demetrius and Thomas; Thomas had for his share the Despotate of Ca∣rinth, and Demetrius that of Sparta; there arose between these two Bre∣thren an irreconcileable Enmity and Division; possibly being both equally swayed with a secret wicked design, that by embroiling the Affairs of the Empire, they might lessen its Glory, and thereby encrease their own, and obtain by its Ruine the independence of their Government: Thomas had gained to his Party the Albanians and Latins, who were equally at his devo∣tion: Demetrius was assisted by the\n\ndescription Page 28\n\nTurks, and Turchan Beglerbey of Ro∣mania defired nothing more than to procure and forward the Ruine of this Empire.\n\nThese unfortunate Princes went one after another to make their com∣plaints to Mahomet the Second; whose aid they implored, and did him Ho∣mage, never considering that thereby they lost so much of their Power; and gave it up as a Sacrifice to him who wisht but to devour them both: At last they came to be sensible of their Error, but too late; for Thomas perceiving that the Turks made In∣roads even to his Borders, and justly suspecting a design to surprize him, was forced to provide for his safety by flight; and Demetrius was made an example of the Turks cruel perfidious∣ness, and would have thought it a great Felicity if he could have preven∣ted a miserable Captivity by a glori∣ous Death. The first fled for refuge to Rome, where in consideration of his Royal Extraction, and the Present which he brought of the Head of the famous Apostle St. Andrew, he recei∣ved an honourable and advantagious\n\ndescription Page 29\n\nEntertainment. The other transpor∣ted to Adrianople, by a malicious surprize of the Ottomans, was forced not to think it his greatest Misfortune to Espouse his own Daughter, so to free her from the danger of losing her Honour with her Liberty.\n\nThe Virtues which have rendered Greece so famous, have indeed had ••heir Birth there, but they could ne∣ver have grown to that height, if the Republick of Venice had not assisted and sustained them; for she has al∣••ays been a good Mother, and signa∣••z'd her tenderness, by that strict al∣••ance she has always had with Greece. Tis an unquestionable Truth as ap∣ears by the Historys of Venice, and which any one may be easily satisfied ••n, that there is no Empire, Realm or ••rovince in all Greece where the Vene∣••ans have not left some marks of ••heir Dominion. In the declining of ••he Greecian Empire, when it suffered ••everal dismembrings, the greatest ••arcels thereof submitted to the Ve∣••etians; for under their dependance ••ere Arcadiopolis, Rodesto, Adriano∣••e, Gallipoli in Thrace, and therewith\n\ndescription Page 30\n\nall the County about Prevesa and Arta part of Macedonia, the Province of Lacedaemon, and a great deal of the Morea; besides, they were acknow∣ledged Soveraigns of most of the Isle•• of the Archipelago. In fine, these were the Titles of the Venetian Empire born by the sole Person of the Doge Dux Venetiarum, Dalmatiae, Croatiae, Do∣minus quartae partis & dimidiae toti•• Imperii Romaniae; and if these Testi∣monies were not sufficient to evinc•• the vast extent of the Venetian Em∣pire, in Greece we need only bring an Epitome of what Historian•• have related in several great Vo∣lumes.\n\nThe designing Turks having go•• footing in the Possessions of the Pro∣vinces of these two Princes, desire•• nothing more than to invade the rest of the Country, so to become sol•• Masters of the Peninsula. The Vene¦tians only could put a check to the height of Ambition, which was alto∣gether unjust, especially since they went about to violate the Faith o•• Treaties, and break the Peace con¦cluded. But 'tis a Maxime of the\n\ndescription Page 31\n\nBarbarous Nations, to count nothing inviolable, but the advancement of their Interests by any means whatso∣ever, and take occasion then to make War, when their Enemies think them∣selves most secured by Peace. Thus the Turks never making themselves Slaves to the Religious observance of the Peace, surprised Argos, and then behaved themselves as declared Ene∣mies. The Republick found by this first Attempt of the Enemy, that it was full time to provide for their de∣fence; and it being an Enterprize of great Importance, and that from Heaven only we expect the most powerful Aids and an happy Success, it was above all things resolved that the Standards should bear the Ensigns of our Redemption. Then Troops were raised, and the General Com∣mand given to Bertoldo d' Este: This great Captain armed with his utmost Courage for so great an Attempt, set sail for the Morea, and landed with his whole Army between the Gulfs of En∣gia and Lepanto. He at first applyed himself to get a perfect knowledg of the place, and to find means of put∣ting\n\ndescription Page 32\n\na stop to the frequent irruptions of the Enemy; to which end he be∣gan that memorable Work, and in few days finished it, the famous Wall called Eximile; after which he em∣ployed his whole Forces in the de∣fence thereof, and in a thousand glo∣rious Actions, gave Proof of his great Courage, and perfect Experi∣ence in the Art of War: Neither his Head nor his Hands were idle, he was the first in all perilous Encounters, undervaluing his Life, so he might Sa∣crifice it to the Service of his Coun∣try, and at the same time forward the loss of his natural and sworn Enemy. He was arrived to the height of his hopes, and his Troops animated by his Example, had already gained several advantages promising a glorious Vi∣ctory, and entire defeat of his Ene∣mies; when God, whose Thoughts are not as our Thoughts are, and who when he pleases can give the greatest Conquerors their defeat, and Death in the Field where they expected to be Crowned with Victory, and ride Tri∣umphant; permitted by the secret or∣ders of his Providence, or Effects of\n\ndescription Page 33\n\nhis Justice upon us, that our Gene∣ral sunk and dyed of several Glorious Wounds. The Head being thus cut off, the Members soon languisht, and the Enemy becoming more sierce through the weak resistance they found, renewed the Combat with greater Fury, and gained the Victory; after which setting no Bounds to their unjust Ambition, they ravaged and became Masters of all the Country, possessed for so many Years by our August Republique.\n\nAfter which they establish there a Governour of some Quality with the Title of Sangiac, or Morabegi, as much as to say, Lord of the Morea, and allowed him an Hundred thou∣sand Aspers a year, obliging him to keep a thousand Horse with all ne∣cessary Equipage, to be at the dispo∣sal of the Beglerbey of Greece.\n\nFor all the advantages which this Sangiac enjoys, yet he is not with∣out his Thorns in his side; for there happen frequent Disputes with the Dins, the Beglerbey or Basha of the Sea, about certain rights he pre∣tends to in all Maritime places, upon\n\ndescription Page 34\n\nall Merchandizes imported or ex∣ported.\n\nModon is the usual place of the San∣giac's Residence: the Republick of Ve∣nice, who only to maintain their Rights in this Kingdom, hath ever Valorously been at War with the Turk, has been the first that have attempted its Re-conquest: and its Arms had so great Success in the Campagne in 1685. as to be Victorious over almost all the Southern places, reckoning a∣mongst these Conquests the City and Fortress of Coron, the Towns of Cala∣mata, Zarnata, Passava, and Chielefa: besides the frequent in roads made by the Troops up in the Country, that were sent to succour any Fortress that was vigorously attacked; the Vene∣tian Army will make this next Cam∣pagne a more advantagious Progress; which we are the more assured of from this hopes, that its Arms are employed only for the great Glory of the Ca∣tholick Religion, and to promote the Ruine of Infidels.\n\ndescription Page 35\n\nOF THE MOREA.\n\nPART II. Wherein is given a particular De∣scription of the Maritime Towns, the Gulfs, Rocks under Water, and of the Isles, not only those on the Morea side, and which are in this Sea, but likewise in the Io∣nian.\n\nAFter having in the First Part of this Work treated of the Morea in general, I design here to Discourse in particular, and with all the exactness agreeable with my pro∣posed Brevity, of all the Maritime Places, of the Gulfs, hidden Rocks,\n\ndescription Page 36\n\nand Isles, as well on this side, as in the Ionian Sea. My Readers may take notice, that after having shewn the different Divisions that have been made of the Morea, I agree with the Sentiment of those who divide it into four Provinces, and that I shall refer to one of these Provinces each of the places whereof I shall have occasion to speak.\n\nThe Isthmus of Corinth.\n\nTHe Isthmus of Corinth, otherwise called the straight of the Morea, or the Argolique straight, is a tongue of Land very rough and Stony; si∣tuated between the Gulf of Lepanto, and that of Engia, uniting the Morea with Achaia.\n\nThis Isthmus is famous for the Isth∣mian Games, instituted by Theseus here, and which were Celebrated eve∣ry five years or Lustrum; as likewise for its Theatre, its furlong of white Marble, its Temple Dedicated to Neptune, and its Forest of Pines whose\n\ndescription Page 37\n\nBranches Crowned the Victorious Combatants.\n\nIt were a great advantage to Navi∣gation, and which would make it ea∣sie and safe, if a Chanel of communi∣cation were cut between the two Seas; and what might promote this Design and encourage its Execution, is that it has been thought practicable, and attempted by several Princes; as A∣lexander the Great, Pitias, King Deme∣trius, Caesar, the Emperor Caligula, Nero, Herodes the Athenian. 'Tis true indeed, these Princes, diverted from this Design by more important Af∣fairs, or disheartned by the tedious∣ness of the Work, have given it over, and desisted from bringing it to an End, that would much have advanced their Glory.\n\nTo supply in some sort the want of this Chanel, the Emperour Emanuel in the Year 1413. caused a Wall to be there raised, by Volateran and Niger, called Hexameli, by Hermolaüs Heromi∣lion, and by Nischius Dioclos, which be∣ginning at Port 'Lecheé 16. Stadia from Corinth, 50. from the Gulf of Saronica (which according to Baudrand,\n\ndescription Page 38\n\nwho differs from Lauremburgh is that which we now call Leste Jocori) situa∣ted at the Western edge of the Gulf of Corinth, was extended to Six miles length to the Port of Cenchrea, on the East towards the Gulf of Engia; the Commodiousness of these two Ports much advanced and facilitated the Ea∣stern Trade.\n\nAmurat the Second after the Siege of Constantinople in the Year 1424. not∣withstanding the Peace with the Greek Emperour, caused the Eximile to be demolished. The Republique o•• Venice highly resented these Infringe∣ments of the League, and the Violen∣ces of Amurat, perceiving that by this Action the Enemy had an open Li∣berty of invading all the Neighbour∣ing Countrys. Wherefore Luigi L••re∣dano General at Sea, had orders to land at this place with his whole Ar∣my, who joyning his Forces with Ber∣toldo d' Este, they employed 30000. Men with so much heat, that in the Year 1463. they finisht the Wall in fifteen days, and added to what was before, several very broad double Ditches, and 136. Towers, which made\n\ndescription Page 39\n\nhis Wall of much greater strength ••nd more tenable than it was before; ••o implore a particular Blessing, and ••s it were an Establishment to this Edifice, and an happy success to the Arms of the Republique from Hea∣••en, Bertoldo in the middle of the Wall caused an Altar to be Erected, where the whole Army assisted at Mass which was there solemnly sung. The General at Sea and Bertoldo lea∣••ing a sufficient number for the de∣fence of the Wall, went to Encamp near Corinth, and there busied them∣selves in planting Artillery, and fit∣••ing them for Service When the Spyes brought word that Amarbei Flambular of the Morea, had made an Inrode near them with a Party of 1200 Men: They immediately upon this advice, made a detachment of a good part of the Army, which was Encamped for the defence of the Ex∣imile, and made so hot a fireing with their great Artillery on the Turkish Forces, that their Commander was obliged to Retreat farther out of Gun∣shot; though he again shewed him∣self about Noon to the Venetians, and\n\ndescription Page 40\n\ntook his Lodgments not far from thence. Bertoldo observed all the mo∣tions of Armabei while the other Ge∣ral went to prosecute the Siege: But perceiving that the Turk seemed to desist from his design, through the difficulty there was of executing it without too great a hazard, Bertoldo slighted him, and went to joyn him∣self with the other General to ad∣vance the Siege; it happened by a Misfortune, the forerunner of many others, that as soon as the General ar∣rived at the Camp, he was struck dead upon the place with a blow of a Stone, such was the end of this great Captain; and Bettino da Calci∣nato who succeeded him in the Com∣mand of the Troops, found them so discouraged by this fatal Accident, and was himself so frightned at the approach of the Beglerbey with an Ar∣my of Fourscore thousand Men, that he not only left the Camp before Co∣rinth, but neglected also the defence of the Eximile, after that Wall had been raised with so great a charge to the Republique.\n\ndescription Page 41\n\nCorinth.\n\nTHe City of Corinth, which Strabo and Polybius call Corinthus, Lau∣rembergh Ephyro, the People Coranto, and the Turks Gerame, had its begin∣ing and foundation from Aletes, who lived in the time of Cecrops King of the Athenians Anno 3066. 'Tis situa∣ted as it were in the midst of the Isthmus, in the place where the Ionian and Aegean Seas commix their Waves: It is the See of an Archbishop, distant from Patras 80 Miles, 50 from Athens, 85 from Mysitra, 25 from Argos. It is Commanded by the Fortress of Acrocorinthus, which is near to it; it is so advantagiously seated, that some have thence taken occasion to term it the Eye of Greece, others the Band thereof, and the Bulwark of Pelopon∣nesus: Plutarch judged it the most ex∣cellent, and Cicero the most beautiful City, the splendor of all Greece; nay it arrived to that height of Glory, that Syracusa and Corfu thought it an Ho∣nour to be its Colonies.\n\ndescription Page 42\n\nThe Romans under a pretence of re∣venging themselves on this City, for some violences committed upon some Roman Citizens sent the Consul L. Mamius Anno Mundi 38 18. to abate, as they said, their Pride, with express Order to raze the City to its Founda∣tions, and that giving the Spoil and Pillage to his Souldiers, the Women and Children should he made Slaves.\n\nBy the Bounty and Care of Au∣gustus it was rebuilt and re-peopled, and again flourisht in Riches and Beauty; but through the hard fate of the Times and continual devouring Wars, it can now only shew the mi∣serable Remains of its past Glories, whose Ruines are now the Asylum to a few poor Inhabitants, forced by Necessity rather than Choice to live here. It has been twice the Theatre whereon the Barbarity of Amurat the Second and his Son Mahomet has been Acted; where the Turkish fury has been so Merciless, that at this day not above a score of Houses, or ra∣ther Huts, remain; the sad Image of its ancient Splendor: we may add that we yet see entire with their former\n\ndescription Page 43\n\nBeauty, 12 Columns of 5 Foot Dia∣meter, with a simple Cordon, or List for its Capital about 15 Paces from each other, standing on a little Hill in the Figure of an Amphitheater, at about a Miles distance from the Sea; from this Hill there goes an easie de∣scent to Port Leché, where as yet stands a Tower, formerly a Lanthorn or Sea-mark.\n\nThe Corinthians imbraced the Ca∣tholick Religion by the preaching of St. Peter and Paul, and were therein confirmed in the year 169 by the care∣ful diligence of St. Denis the Second Bishop of this place, which they per∣severed in, till the time that the Greek Emperours refused longer Obedience to the See of Rome.\n\nRoger of Normandy King of Naples took Possession of this City, and might have raised his Glory to a great height, if he could have added this Flower to his Crown, and gained the Hearts of the Corinthians to a wil∣ling Obedience, and have made them pay him the same Homages that they did the Emperour Emanuel; but when he was in the greatest hopes of ob∣taining\n\ndescription Page 44\n\nthis desire, the Army of the Venetians with the Troops of the van∣quisht Greeks, so opposed his Con∣quests, that after a defeat of the greatest part of his Forces, he was constrain'd to consult his own safety by a hasty flight. The Rout of this Prin∣ces Army, and the Disadvantages he thereby received were of great conse∣quence to his Enemies, as the rich Spoil of his Camp was very conside∣rable, which was divided amongst the Auxiliary Troops, there being but lit∣tle need to put them to more necessa∣ry uses after the regaining of Corinth. Scarce two Ages were past before this City submitted it self to the Despotes of Greece; they would willingly have yielded it to the Venetians, in consideration that they could not o∣therwise possess it than by usurpation, the just right thereof belonging only to the Venetian Republique, who had employed its own Forces and the Blood of its Subjects to deliver it from the hands of Strangers.\n\nMahomet the Second could not make so just Reflections, whose mind was uncapable of any thing but a bound∣less\n\ndescription Page 45\n\nAmbition, he re-took Corinth; af∣ter several great endeavours made by the Venetians to regain this Conquest, they were not able to overcome the fury of the Barbarians, whose long re∣sistance made them at last sensible of the necessity of desisting from their Design.\n\nA Table of the Kings of Corinth.\n\nYear of the World. 2862.

This cruel Sa∣crifice had an end when Euripil•• came to Patras, and was there converted to the Christian Religio•• by the preaching of St. Andre•• the Apostle. Patras at that time was very well peopled, as at this day 'tis not thin; there are especially a\n\ndescription Page 49\n\ngreat number of Jews who much pro∣••ote its Trade; and it is almost the ••nly Maritime Town on this side, ••here the Greeks of the neighbouring ••slands, the English and the French ••ome to Traffick.

The Republique had before ordered three Gallies for the guard of the Port. But those who ought to have been watchful, never thinking the Enemy would have taken the first opportunity of repossessing the place, and being in a great uncertain∣ty what to do, when they saw them∣selves just ready to be attacqued, left the Entrance free to the Turk, who with a great deal of frankness decla∣red himself the Patron and Defender of any that would submit them∣selves to his discretion. But those who seemed to be of his Party, in great consternation at the change of their Fate, exposed themselves to the hazard of their Lives, embarquing themselves in little Boats, and they were happy that got aboard five great\n\ndescription Page [unnumbered]\n\ndescription Page [unnumbered]\n\n[illustration] view of Modon\n\nMODON\n\ndescription Page 55\n\nGallies that returned from Baruty, la∣den with Merchandizes, and had cast Anchor within sight of the Port. The news of so strange an Adventure, gave them the alarm to provide for their safety by an hasty flight. The Inhabitants of Zunchio were Specta∣tors of all this Catastrophe, and find∣ing themselves attacked by Land, found no other expedient but to deli∣ver themselves up to the Enemy.\n\nModon.\n\nIN the Frontiers of the Province of the so fertile and pleasant Belvedere, lying in that part of the Peloponnesus which was the Ancient Messenia, a∣mongst the rest of the Cities in the Archbishoprick of Patras the Episco∣pal and Staple Town, which Sophia∣nus calls Modon, is reckoned: The Turks name it Mutum, and Pliny Me∣thone, in Memory of Methena the Daughter of Honer: It is ten Miles off of Coron, an hundred and twenty from Napoli di Romania, and seventy\n\ndescription Page 56\n\ntwo from the Cape of Matapan: Its Situation favoured in several particu∣lars by Nature and Art, makes it very strong, and is upon a Promontory ad∣vanced into the Sea of Sapienza, fronting the Coasts of Africk; at its Foot is a safe and Commodious Ha∣ven, where usually resides the Sangiac of the Morea, much respected at the Port for his good Government.\n\nIn several Ages this place has been exposed to the Assaults of those who, intending to make themselves Masters of the Realm, have thought of gain∣ing this City and Province; from hence it has happened that the famous Wall built at its entrance, and which for its breadth and solidity makes a considerable Opposition, has been of∣tentimes attacked and gained, and by that means the whole Province sub∣dued, and forced to pay a Tribute to keep themselves in any shew of Com∣mand. The People of Naples by means of the Spartans, made them∣selves Masters of Modon, and to sub∣ject it more easily to their Rule, they placed there a Colony of their own People.\n\ndescription Page 57\n\nSome time after the Illyriaus enter∣taining an Ambitious design of enlarg∣ing their Dominions by conquests, chose them a King, and having got together a very numerous Army, made an irruption into the neighbour∣ing Countrys. When they came near to Modon, they gave its Inhabitants to understand with feigned shews of A∣mity, that they desired but to buy the necessary Provisions which they wan∣ted. Those of Modon believing the matter to be so without any deceit or trick, took care to provide for them accordingly, some bringing them Bread, others Wine, and others Provi∣sions. When the Illyrians saw a great number of them without the Gates, they thought (as it really was) that they were so fool-hardy as to leave but a few to guard the Fortress, so they ran all at once to seize on all the Posts and Avenues, and fell on with their whole Army with that fury, that they put a great many to the Sword, and made the rest their Slaves, making the City a sad Example of their Perfidie and Devastation. The Emperor Trajan touch'd with the Misfortune of those\n\ndescription Page 58\n\npoor People that, escaping from the fury of their Traiterous Enemies, were returned thither, gave them Proofs of his Generosity, granting them several Priviledges and Freedoms. After this manner they lived in a kind of Aristocracy till the time of the Emperour Constantine, who left Rome for Constantinople; yet when subject to the Empire they kept so much of their first immunities, that the same form of Government remained; and as to the Homages paid the Emperor, they were rather protected by him, than entirely subjected to him.\n\nIn the year 1124. this City was At∣tacked, and taken by the Doge Domi∣nico Michael, when he returned the third time Triumphant from the Holy∣land, over the Conquests of Tyre and Ascalon in Soria, and of Rhodes, Scio, Samos, Lesbos, and Andros, in the Ar∣chipelago; and to these memorable Exploits may be added the entire de∣feat of the Army of the Infidels, when he raised the Siege of Zaffo. And though the next year this place re∣turned under Dominion of the Empe∣ror of Greece, yet in the Division of\n\ndescription Page 59\n\nthe Empire, Anno 1204. it again came under the Republique, out of whose hands it was forced by Leon Ve∣trane, a Genoese by Nation, who was a famous Pirat; he kept it not long, for soon after being made Prisoner on the Hellespont, he was transported to Corfu, and there received a violent Death from the hands of the Hang∣man, as a just reward for all his Ra∣pines. This Death of their Head dis∣heartened the whole Party, and by that means the Captains Dandolo, and Promarino without much trouble be∣came Masters of this Town.\n\nBut Bajazet the Second burning with a desire to enlarge his Empire by the Conquest of some new Country: In the Year 1498. putting himself at the head of an Army of an hundred and fifty thousand Men, closely besieged Modon: His Cannon made so great a breach in the Wall of the Suburbs, that th•• Captains of the place were forced, after mature deliberation, to retire into the City, and carry with them what ever they could. But the Enemy pressed them in the City with more violence than ever; that they\n\ndescription Page 60\n\nwere ready to demand a Capitulation, when at last the Venetian Army ap∣peared in view, which came from Zante, to their aid. As soon as the two Armies came within shot, there hapened a Cruel and doubtful Com∣bat, but in the end after various For∣tunes, the Venetians had so much ad∣vantage as to get in one of their Felu∣ques, to animate the besieged, to con∣tinue Couragiously in the defence of the place, in the full assurance that their Army would soon rid them out of their Danger; and it fell out at the same time, that four Gallies with all sorts of Ammunition from the Vene∣tian Army, passed through the Tur∣kish Squadrons, and in despight of the Infidels gained the Port very happy∣ly. This had been a matter of great Success, if the End had been less de∣plorable; for the besieged overjoyed at the receiving the so long expected Succours, abandoned the Posts they ought to have kept still guarded. The Turks on their side watching for all Opportunities of gaining the Victory, and finding no great difficulty of en∣tring the Town, laid hold of the Ad∣vantage\n\ndescription Page [unnumbered]\n\n[illustration] plan of Coron\n\nCORON\n\ndescription Page [unnumbered]\n\ndescription Page 61\n\n••antage and gained the place, giving ••••rrible Proofs of their Cruelty. In ••••at furious slaughter, that was made, ••he Illustrious Prelate Andrew Falconi ••eceived his Death; who, cloathed in ••is Pontificalibus, had animated the ••eople to an obstinate resistance of ••he Infidels.\n\nIt happened, for the common good of Christendom, that whilst these Memoires ••ere printing in French, we received the ••greeable news of the taking of Modon ••rom the Turks by the Venetian Army, ••nder the wise Conduct of the Valiant General Morosini. This will much ad∣vance the Conquest of the whole Morea, which justly belongs to that Triumphant Republick.\n\nCoron.\n\nCOron has a strong and advantagi∣ous Situation in the Province of Belvedere, the most Fertile and Rich in the whole Kingdom, and which was part of the Ancient Messenia, at about ten Miles distance by Land, and\n\ndescription Page 62\n\ntwenty by Sea from Modon; on the right side of Cape Gallo, by Ptolomey called Acritas Promontorium; Strabo and Pliny knew it by the same name, which was given it upon the account of what happened when its Founda∣tions were laid; for in digging they found a Sea Swallow, by the Greek•• called Coronis, and as an happy Pre∣sage of future Prosperity, they named this City from the Bird, Coron.\n\nIt was once a Bishops Seat, Suffra∣gan to the Bishop of Patras, and at an∣other time 'twas reckoned a Colony of the Thebans, which the Poets called Pedosus; Laurenberg, Nisi: and Pau∣sanias, Epea, and all the Ancient and Modern Historians make honourable mention thereof.\n\nIt makes the Figure of a Scalen•• Triangle, and in one of its Angles i•• a great Tower, built by the Venetian•• Anno 1463. for a Magazin; the o∣ther two sides, which are not was•••• by the Gulf of Coron, leave a suffici∣ent space fit for the Tower of th•• Fortress, which is encompass'd with an old Wall of an unequal thickness flanked with great Towers, and a••\n\ndescription Page 63\n\nsome Paces from thence on the North ••de there is a Suburbs of 500 Houses.\n\nSince it has been several times expo∣••ed to the Assaults of the Enemy, so it ••as been often forced in different Ages ••o pay Tribute to different Nations. Baudrand has thought it was yielded up to the Venetian Republick by the Despotes, Princes of the Morea; and Verdizotti says that at the time of the Division of the Graecian Empire, and in the same year that this glorious Re∣publick, having made Alliances with several Princes, thought upon the gaining of this Kingdom, Coron was assigned for its Portion.\n\nIt was surprised Anno 1204. by Le∣on Veteran, a Genoese by Nation, and Pirate by Profession, who enjoyed not long his unjust Triumph, for be∣ing taken on the Hellespont, as we said before, he was put to Death by the common Hangman at Corfu; whose death being known to his Compani∣ons, all in amazement and disorder, they sought safety by an hasty flight; at whose dispersion the Inhabitants of Coron after some slight Attempts sub∣mitted themselves to the Venetians.\n\ndescription Page 64\n\nBajazet the Second Emperour of the East, all inflamed with the desire of extending the Bounds of his Empire Anno 1498. marched with a powerful Army strait to Modon, which having gained, he turned his Victorious Arms against Coron, which he could no otherwise win but by force.\n\nIn the Year 1533. the General Do∣ria, who had under his command a Spanish Armado of 35 great Vessels, and 48 Gallies with a design of envi∣roning this City, caused a great num∣ber of Troops as well Spaniards as Ita∣lians, the later under two Captains, Girolamo Tuttavilla and the Count Sarno, and the Spaniards Command∣ed by Girolamo Mendozza. These three Commanders following the or∣der of their General, began with four∣teen Cannon to batter the City, and to gain Entrance by a large breach; but this Enterprize had not the Success that was hoped for: The Turkish de∣fenders obstinately withstood the At∣tack, and killed 300 Christian Soul∣diers; nevertheless those Forces by Sea performed what the Troops by Land failed in: for vigorously following\n\ndescription Page 65\n\nthe Attack they got the Wall, and ob∣••iged the Defendants to hang out the white Flag; so the Turks were per∣mitted upon Capitulation to go out, Bag and Baggage, and the Troops of Mendozza took Possession of the Place: some time after the Turks at∣tempted to form a Blocus, so to regain the Town: it then fell out that the Spanish Garrison being unwilling to en∣dure a Siege, shewed a resolution of going out to meet the Enemy, and what opposition soever Maccian Nova∣rese, who Commanded in Mendozza's place, made thereto, endeavouring to divert them there from, by putting them to the greatest Labours, yet he found himself constrained at last to yield to their Importunity; wherefore he marched out for that bold Attempt to attack the Enemy, near Andrusa, where they lay encamped with an Army of 3000 Foot, amongst which were 500 Janisaries, Commanded by Casan Aga.\n\nThe Spaniards being come near the Enemys Camp, to give them the grea∣ter amazement, thought best to set on fire the Stables of the Horses, who be∣ing\n\ndescription Page 66\n\ninraged to free themselves from the Flames, made a strange noise, which soon gave the Turks the alarm; who putting themselves in a Posture of defence, and finding the Christian Ar∣my weak and few in number, endea∣voured to encompass it; then was be∣gan a very bloody Combat, and in the midst of the Press the Valiant Captain Maccian fell down dead of several Wounds; after that blow the Spaniards began to sink, and had been utterly routed if one of their Musque∣tiers had not returned to the Turkish Commander, the like Fate which their own had suffered; by whose Death the Turkish Courage began to cool, and the Spaniards made an Ho∣nourable retreat back to Coron, where they took a Resolution to embark and abandon the Place; and so the Em∣peror was willing not to raise new difficulties that might obstruct the making of the Peace in Hungary: After this manner that unfortunate City re∣turned under the Barbarian Yoak.\n\nIn the midst of this Calm, and whilst the Forces of the Republick were not employed about any great\n\ndescription Page 67\n\nEnterprizes, the Procurator Francisco Morosini, Captain General of the Re∣publick, toucht with the Sentiments of Honour and his great Courage, conceived the design of making use of the present opportunity to regain those places in the Morca, which the Ottomans had ravisht from the Vene∣tians; for which purpose, considering that if once they were Masters of Co∣ron, which was no difficult matter, a means might be found of carrying on their Conquests; he set sail for this City Anno 1685. and sat down be∣fore it, but scarce had the Venetians ap∣proacht the Place, when a great Bo∣dy of Turks came down from the Country, and took up their Lodg∣ments within Pistol-shot of the Chri∣stians; by this bold Act the besieged were animated to a more Vigorous resistance, and it proved a great hin∣drance to the Valour and Designs of the besiegers, who nevertheless de∣sisted not from doing what ever they thought might advance the Siege and promote the taking of the Place. They gave Fire to a Mine of 100 Barrels of Powder, and were prepa∣red\n\ndescription Page 89\n\nfor the Assault, if any Breach should be made, as they hoped there would; and notwithstanding the bad Success of their Mine, they proceed∣ed to advance their Lodgments, and repulse the Turks with an extraordina∣ry impetuosity. In this far advanced Post they defended themselves by their Dragoons, and were reinforced with some Troops of Malta; but in the end, after above three hours Combat, they were beat back and routed, and must all there have perisht, had they not found a means of escaping the Pursuit and Sword of the Enemy; yet for all this they carryed off from the Turks Seventeen Colours, and a Trophy of other rich Spoils: Being returned into their Retrenchments, to discourage the besieged, they set up at the end of their Pikes 130 Turks Heads; yet this abated not the Ardour of the Turks, who, although in continual Action, that they had scarce time to breath, yet would entertain no thoughts of Rendition, nor so much as Capitula∣tion, so much were they encouraged by the hopes of receiving a speedy Succour; and indeed a great number\n\ndescription Page 69\n\nof dispersed Fugitives and others got together from several parts of the Kingdom; or sent from the Turkish Army, came down, so that they were considerably encreased; and then they thought upon the readiest means to procure a speedy deliverance of the place. But their Efforts turned against them, for having attempted to force the Besiegers in their Retrenchments, they were briskly repulsed by a ter∣rible Volley of Musket-shot and Gra∣nado's; and being then pursued by a Regiment, and 200 Dragoons, they left 400 of their Men upon the place, and their Visier Calil Bassa was found amongst the rest of the Dead.\n\nAfter this blow, which was not a little advantagious to us, our General making Reflection, that the Enemies were often refresht with new Supplies, to the great disadvantage of his own Men, whereof he had lost a great number, without any hopes of re∣cruiting them, he at last concluded that the whole Success depended upon the Defeat of the Turkish Camp; where∣fore he applyed himself to whatever might contribute to make this At∣tempt\n\ndescription Page 70\n\nsuccessful and advantagious, he animated his Troops, took his Mea∣sures, gave Orders and saw them Ex∣ecuted so well, that he not only for∣ced the Ottomans from their Camp, but put them to so great a rout, that flying with precipitation, there were a great number of them cut in pieces by our Forces in the pursuit. They left the Christians a considerable Boo∣ty, consisting of six Brass Guns and much other Arms, all sort of Ammu∣nition and Implements of War, 300 Horse, a great many Tents and Co∣lours, amongst which the General-Standard, shewing, by the Horse Tails that adorned it, the Quality of the Commander, who was Machumat Bas∣sa, who had the entire Conduct of the Army, and was killed, as we said before.\n\nAfter so fortunate an Adventure, the Venetians found themselves freed from the great Obstacles of the Turks that were encamped without the Place; and being Masters of the Field, they had hopes of soon putting the Besieged out of all thoughts of defence. They prepared for a general Assault,\n\ndescription Page 71\n\nspringing a Mine, whose Effect ••rought them to an Attack for three Hours; the besieged withstood them with an incredible Valour and Oppo∣sition, fatal to a great many Nobles and Valiant Souldiers, who perisht there. This considerable loss gave a few moments breathing to the Attack, put the Courage wherewith they a∣gain fell on made the besieged think it high time to come to a Capitulation, as they testified by hanging out a white Standard on the Rampart: Arms then were laid down to regulate the Articles of the Capitulation, but this was only a trick of Ottoman Perfidi∣ousness, who made a feigned shew of Rendition, to procure a greater loss to the Besiegers, by a brisk and unex∣pected Assault: The Venetians also took a more firm Resolution than ever to put an end to the Siege, which had already continued Nine and forty days, and having swept the Ramparts with their Shot, mounted the Walls and entered the Town, where being heated as they were with the Assault, they made a dreadful slaughter of all the Inhabitants, without regard of\n\ndescription Page 72\n\nSex or Age. They found there 128 Pieces of Canon, of which 66 were Brass, besides a great quantity o•• Ammunition and Victuals.\n\nThere happened during the space of so long a Siege several Remarkable matters that would make a great Vo∣lum. I shall but touch at some of the most Considerable, and for those, my design is rather to beget an admirati∣on of the extraordinary Valour there shewn by its Assailants, who were distinguisht either by Birth or their great Employs, and fell there a Sacri∣fice for Glory; than to open our Wounds and renew our Grief for their loss and our Misfortunes: a∣mongst others was the Death of la Tour, Commander General by Land, and Knight of Malta; of the Prince of Brunswick, and of the Prince of Savoy: These Illustrious Warriours gave in the face of the Enemy suffi∣cient Proofs of the greatness of their Courage, answerable to the deserved high Thoughts conceived of their Merit.\n\nTo these great Persons we may add, as he justly deserves a more than ordi∣nary\n\ndescription Page 73\n\nremembrance, that excellent ••aptain Francesco Ravagnini, but 34 ••ears old, Brother to Girolamo; ••e have been informed of this parti∣••••lar Circumstance of his Death, ••hich alone merits an eternal remem∣••ance amongst Men. At the last Pe∣••ods of his Life, after having made ••s Will for the distribution of his ••state, he earnestly desired, that after ••s death, his Body might be buried ••o where but in Coron, testifying, by ••at, his assurance, that the place ••ould be taken; and nothing can ••ore demonstrate with what ardor he ••ust necessarily go to the Attack, ••an this firm perswasion of their be∣••g Crowned with an happy success.\n\nAfter being a little recovered of the ••reat fatigues of this Siege, the Gene∣••al raised a Trophy of the great Stan∣••ard taken from the Enemies, and an Explication was made of the words ••hat were upon it; with a general Ap∣••lause the Ornament of the Golden ••tar was conferred by the Republick on his Brother Lorenzo, as a recom∣pence for his great Services.

They were in hopes with the aid of this new Army of Ottomans, which now were advan∣ced within Pistol-shot of our Tren∣ches, they might raise the Siege and spoil our design; and indeed the Turks that were encamped without the place acted for its defence what∣ever might be expected from desperate and bold Men. They attempted se∣veral times to become Masters of a Bonnet which commanded their Camp, but were still repulsed. This retarded the Besiegers, and was an hindrance to their Works and Endea∣vours to reduce the place; but the General took a Resolution to play a Mine of an hundred Barrels of Pow∣der: this was performed the 24 of July,\n\ndescription Page 76\n\nalthough with but little Effect, con¦trary to the hopes of the Success o•• this Work; then the Turks broke into the Venetians Lines to gain their de••••¦red Object, the aforesaid Bonnet, but when they thought themselves sun•• of it, the General poured upon them a Body of Foot and Dragoons, and reinforced by the Maltese Forces, wh•• Attacked them at the very entrance o•• the Bonnet with so much Force and Valour for three hours, for so long the Combat lasted, that in the end our Forces replanted there the white Colours. The Turks that were driven from it endeavoured to shelter them∣selves from our Shot, under the Co∣vert of some Trees, but they were for∣ced from thence also; there were left 400 of them dead upon the place, and as many wounded: Ours got by this Action several worthy Spoils, a∣mongst the rest seventeen Standards; and at their return into their Tren∣ches, they exposed to the view of the Besieged 130 Turks Heads, as a fright∣ful dismaying Spectacle.\n\nThere were not above an hundred and thirty Christians killed and\n\ndescription Page 77\n\nwounded, amongst which the Gene∣••l by Land ended his days; Com∣••ander la Tour, of the Order of Mal∣•• a Captain, well meriting the Grief ••f the whole Army; notwithstand∣••g the loss sustained by the Turks, ••ey were not less obstinate in their ••efence: Ours on the other side to ••ve them more terrible Effects of ••eir Power, made a furious discharge ••f their Cannon, Bombes, and ••ones; at the same time the Turks ••llyed again after their slight, and ••creased by a great number of Soul∣••ers got together from all Parts of the ••orea, and with the Forces of the ••aptain Bassa, again attempted with ••eater impetuosity than before, to ••row themselves into the Venetian ••renches; but so great a discharge of ••usket and Granadoes was made upon ••em, that they were obliged to re∣••eat, and were followed by the Regi∣••ent of Colonel Bianchli with 200 Dra∣••ons up to their own Retrenchments: •••• this Action 400 of them were left ••ead; but what most increased their ••ss was, that a Cannon Shot took off ••alil Bassa Visier Commander Gene∣ral\n\ndescription Page 78\n\nof the Ottoman Army, and we lost but forty of our Men, yet all these losses would not abate the Turkish Pride, and bring them to yield; for they knew where to gather a recruit of fresh Troops, and omitted not daily to disturb the Venetians in their Tren∣ches. These frequent Attacks had much lessened our Men, who were besides much harrased with continual Action; so that doubtless 'twas very needful for the General to encourage them, which he did, shewing himself a fearless Example of Valour, being the first in all Dangers and fatigues.\n\nIn the end this prudent Comman∣der finding the only means to reduce the place, was to force the Enemys Camp, proposed the Design to the Council of War, which was appro∣ved of by them. He drew out of the Gallies 1500 Voluntiers, who under the Command of Lieutenant Colonel Magnani landed about Mid-night, and next day being the 7th. of August 1200 of them filed off to the left of the Enemys Retrenchments by the Entrance of a Valley, and the rest of them went to the right; at the\n\ndescription Page 79\n\nsame time the other Troops had or∣der to follow their Motions, to be ready to give them a speedy Succour at necessary places, so to favour and promote the design.\n\nTwilight of the next Morning be∣ing come, two Barrels of Powder were fired, as a Signal, which was immediately followed with a dis∣charge of all the Cannon, and surious Salvo of all the Musketeers, with a continual siring on the Front and Flank of the Enemies Camp. This brisk and unexpected Assault put the Turks into an extream disorder, and the forwardest of them began to give back and sly, without being able to be retained by the Example of the most fearless, or the Commands of their Officers; all yield, and the Venetians find no more resistance, but make a continual Butchery of the Turks, scarce any escaping their Swords. The Event was such, that the Victory which the Venetians gain∣ed in a very short time, was accom∣panied with the entire Defeat of their Enemies, and the Ground was all co∣vered with dead and dying Men,\n\ndescription Page 80\n\nand Streams of the unbelieving Blood ran down; in this Action but few of the Christians were lost or wounded.\n\nA very rich Booty was found in the Turks Camp of Artillery, Arms, Ammunition and Provision, with a∣bove 300 Horses, Tents, Standards, six Brass Guns, three whereof were marked with St. Mark of Venice, be∣sides these the Imperial Standard a∣dorned with Horse Tails, the mark of a general Command and a nume∣rous Army.\n\nBy the order of the Senate this Monument of their Victory was de∣signed for the Church of the Tolen∣tins of Venice, to be there for ever exposed to the Eyes of the People, over the Altar of St. Gaetan, as an Eternal Memorial that this Saints Festival was the day whereon the Venetians had so Glorious a Success against the Infidels; and at the same time it was Decreed that every year on the same day, this Festival should be kept with all the Solemnity pos∣sible, conformable to what was then done. The most Serene Doge, with\n\ndescription Page 81\n\nthe whole Senate and a general Con∣course of all the City, went on Wed∣nesday the Twelfth of September, car∣rying the Standard with the Tails to that Church, where they sung a Te Deum, and a solemn Mass was Cele∣brated in Thanks to God, to the great Comfort and Edification of the People.\n\nThe Figure which we have given represents the Magnificence of the Standard, and form of the Batons and Tails; the whole was designed and graved with so much care and exactness, that one who has the Skill of Blazonry, will easily comprehend not only its Grandeur, but likewise the Colours of this Standard; wherefore 'tis needless to particularise it here: It was thought best to oblige the Curi∣ous with the interpretation of the Turkish Characters that make the Moon, and the Faces of the Lance on the end of the Standard.\n\ndescription Page 82\n\nOn the right side of the Standard are read these Words,\n\nIn the Name of the most High and Almighty God, God the Lord of all, and of the holy Prophet above all other Saints, Maho∣met Abubechir, Homer, Osman, Ali.\n\nOn the Reverse.\n\nThere is no other God but one only God, and Mahomet is his Prophet: Our God; thou art the God of Nations; thou art the Soveraign Good and Dispencer of Good. Kalil Bassa.\n\nOn the Face of the Standard are seen these Words repeated,\n\nThere is no other God but one only God, and Mahomet is his Prophet.\n\ndescription Page 83\n\nThe Turks shew these Tails as a sign of their Resolution, to make new Levies, and that a great Army will march; and afterwards they give them to him that is to be the Commander in chief, as a sign of good Augury. This Custom took its rise amongst them, from an Adven∣ture that happened to them, when they first began to establish their Ty∣rannick Rule out of their own Coun∣try. In a Battel their Enemy made 6000 of them Prisoners, who took occasion to throw off the Victors Yoak, and set themselves at Liberty; and wanting Standards to range themselves under, they thought upon, and made use of some Horses Tails for that purpose, since which time they have still continued the Custom; calculating the future by their first Success, and think themselves, under these Colours, able to deal with the most Couragious of their Enemies, and resist their most furious Onsets. But as once when the Sabins, a proud and fierce People, planted their Stan∣dard in the Face of the Romans to af∣front them, with these words; Sabinis\n\ndescription Page 84\n\nPopulis Quis Resistet; Who dares resist the Sabin People. The Romans an∣swered them with an equal fierceness, in words beginning with the same Let∣ters. Senatus Populus Que Romanus, The Senate and Roman People. So the Perfidious Ottomans will find their vain and ridiculous Sign opposed by the Sign that is revered in Paradise, which will one day procure their final Ruine, when we shall have made our selves worthy of this Favour from Heaven by our constant Prayers.\n\nCalamata.\n\nON the left Bank of the River Spir∣nazza which Strabo calls Pamis∣sus, Ptolomey Pamissus, Niger Stronio, and Giovio Tifoo; on the hanging of a Hill lyes the Fortress of Calamata of a large extent, by Baudrand called Thelame, Theramme, Thuria and Abia, from the Nurse of Helles one of Hercu∣les's Sons: Its Situation is in an open place in the Province of Belvedere, it is well Peopled, and though the Town\n\ndescription Page [unnumbered]\n\n[illustration] view of Calamata\n\nCALAMATA\n\ndescription Page [unnumbered]\n\ndescription Page [unnumbered]\n\n[illustration] depiction of battle at Calamata\n\nBATAILLE DEVAN•• CALAMATA\n\ndescription Page [unnumbered]\n\ndescription Page 85\n\nhas no Walls to repulse the Attacks of the Enemy, yet upon a mount near it stands a strong Castle, with regular Fortifications, able to guard it from all dangerous Incursions. Though Calamata be but a little way from Co∣ron, yet it stands not on the Gulf, which is indifferently called the Gulf of Coron, and Calamata.\n\nIn the Year 1659. there was a very strong and numerous Garrison, who hindred Six thousand of the Magnotes who performed the Greek Rites, from shaking off the Barbarian Yoak, as they designed; they offered them∣selves to General Morosini, and testifi∣ed their great Zeal that they always had toward the Republick. The Ge∣neral respecting their Generous incli∣nation, and to take away all impedi∣ment of their deliverance, caused a sufficient number of Forces to land, under the Command of Chevalier de Gremouille, who caused them to ad∣vance to Attack the Castle; it hap∣pened at the time when our Troops drew near it, that they were met by a great Body of Turks that ha∣sted to its Succour. Captain Georgio\n\ndescription Page 86\n\nCornaro had the Fortune to rout them, and that this Success might procure another of more importance, he cau∣sed some Venetians to enter into the Castle, together with the Turks, as if they had been all one; those of the Garrison never perceiving the Strata∣gem till it was too late to hinder its sad Effects, so that they thought only upon flight; and thus they became Masters of the place without striking a blow. They found in the place a great Provision of Victuals, and af∣ter they had taken as much as they could dispose of, and burnt the rest, with a good part of the Country, they left the Castle and returned to their Ships, leaving the place to be reinha∣bited by the Turks.\n\nThis place was again taken by the Venetians, on the day of the Exaltati∣on of the holy Cross, Anno 1685. un∣der the command of the same Gene∣ral Morosini; he made Governour there, Baron General Degenfeld, who ••fterwards had Orders to raze it to the Ground. The Plan we give there∣of represents it as it was when it was taken.\n\ndescription Page [unnumbered]\n\n[illustration] view of Zarnata\n\nZARNATA\n\ndescription Page [unnumbered]\n\ndescription Page [unnumbered]\n\n[illustration] view of Zarnata\n\nVEUE DE ZARNATA.\n\ndescription Page [unnumbered]\n\ndescription Page 87\n\nZarnata.\n\nZArnata is a Fortress much favou∣red by Nature, but made much ••ore considerable by Art; its Figure •• almost round, and its Situation on •• very pleasant Hill: in the Year 1685. ••he Captain Passa encamped within ••ive Miles of this place, and though he had a numerous and powerful Ar∣my, yet he contented himself in be∣••ng an admirer of the Valour and Forces of the Venetian Army, with∣out daring to attempt any Act of Hostility; willing rather to expose the place to the Enemy without Suc∣cour, than himself by defending it to a Ruin, which he thought inevitable: After this manner the Garison delive∣red it self up to General Morosini, up∣on Conditions that were upon that account exactly observed; that they should carry off their Lives and Bag∣gage untoucht; for 60 of them who went out of the place the eleventh of September, were convoyed to a certain place prefixt, without receiving the\n\ndescription Page 88\n\nleast violence or insulation from our Part. The Aga that Commanded them had no mind to go with them, for fear of losing his Head; but chose rather to submit himself to the Generosity of the Christians, and be∣ing retired into their Camp, he ob∣tained of Angelo Michieli Captain of the Slaves to stay aboard his Galley.\n\nThe General gave the Govern∣ment of this place to two remarkable Voluntiers, in Qality of Represen∣tants, named Bartolomeo Contarini, and Angelo Emo, leaving a Garrison of One hundred and fifty Souldiers, un∣der the direction of Lieutenant Colo∣nel Prastini.\n\nChielefa.\n\nCHielefa is a Fortress of great im∣portance, whether it be conside∣red for its advantages of Nature or Art; it has its Situation upon a steep Rock a Mile and half from the Sea, it is a Mile in Circuit of a Qua∣drangular Figure, and Flanked\n\ndescription Page [unnumbered]\n\n[illustration] plan of Chielafa\n\nCHIELAFA\n\ndescription Page [unnumbered]\n\ndescription Page 89\n\nwith five great Towers about its Walls.\n\nIt is not far from the place where once Vitulo stood, a famous Trading Town, from whence the Port that is near it took and retains the name of Vitulo, though it is now but little fre∣quented, being neither commodious nor safe.\n\nWhen General Morosini was upon his expedition by War, to increase the Venetian Conquests, he presented him∣self with his Army before this For∣tress, and began to Attack it with great Vigour; but the Garrison thinking it self not in a Condition to oppose so great a Captain, endeavou∣red to procure a favourable Capitu∣lation.\n\nThe fearful Turks made humble re∣quest to the General to spare their Lives, and permit them to go out without suffering any Violence from the Christians. Assar Passa, who re∣sided there in quality of Comman∣der of the whole Province, went first our, carrying the Keys of the Place to the Generals Galley, followed by a thousand Persons, whereof Three\n\ndescription Page 90\n\nhundred and fifty embarked them∣selves on the Ships of Pisani, some∣time director of this Fortress, who transported them, with what Bag∣gage they had saved, to the Isle of Staggs.\n\nAfter they had returned Thanks to Heaven, and planted the Standard of the Cross, and the glorious St. Mark, the General establisht for Proveditor ordinary Bernardo Balbi, and Lorenzo Venier for extraordinary.\n\nA Relation of the Victory obtained by the Venetians, over the Turks; Before the Fortress of Chielefa, on the first of April 1686.\n\nTHe Ottomans have now made Proof of what often happens, when by endeavouring to regain what we have lost, we draw upon us new and sometimes greater Losses. They intended at the beginning of the Campagn, to retake the Fortress of Chielefa, which the Venetians had justly taken from them the year be∣fore;\n\ndescription Page 91\n\nconfiding in an Army which they had gotten together of Ten thousand Foot and fifteen hundred Horse: with a great number of Pio∣niers, they began to Attack the place, playing upon it with six great Pieces of Ordnance, fully perswad∣ed that they durst not, or at most could not maintain the place long; nevertheless they were ten days with∣out much advancing their Works, or finding the Besieged any thing in∣clined to Rendition; it fell out that the Venetian Army hasting to their aid Encountred the Turks, and the At∣tack was so brisk and furious, that the Insidels betook themselves to their Heels as their only refuge. The Defeat was so hasty, that they left a very Rich Booty to the Con∣querors; and a great many of their Men dead upon the place.\n\ndescription Page 92\n\nPassava.\n\nPAssava is a Fortification seated in the Province of Maina, near the Shore of the Gulf of Colochina, upon Cape Matapan, opposite to Chi∣elefa and Port Vitulo; its Figure is as we have represented it in our Draught thereof; it is built upon an Eminence, but is altogether irregular, and not in a condition to hinder the inroads of the Enemy into the Province.\n\nCaptain General Morosini caused a great Party of Magnotes to make an halt before this Fortress, at the same time that the Turks went out of Chielefa, to set up the Standard of St. Mark, but perceiving the Garri∣son ready to march out, and stayed but to transport the great Guns of the place, he sent a Detachment of five hundred Foot, under the Com∣mand of Sergeant Major Gregorevick a Forreigner, to reinforce the Magno∣tes, and hinder their design. The Turks discovering at a distance the\n\ndescription Page 93\n\nVenetian Colours, in a great fright and disorder ran and left their Post. So we became Masters of the place without a stroak: It was not judged worth the leaving a Garrison to maintain it; but on the contrary it was resolved to raze it, which was the more readily concluded on, in that it was an useless place, and that there was very near to it a strait passage where a few Men might put a stop to, and engage a very numerous Army.\n\nMysitra.\n\nAS this place has had several ap∣pellations, so some have chose to call it rather by one than ano∣ther; it was at the first called Sparta, then Lacedaemon, and at last Mysitra; it is one of the most fa∣mous of all the Graecian Cities, and has been of so vast an extent, that in Polybius's time it contained a Circuit of Eight and forty Furlongs. Its Fi∣gure was almost round, and its Situ∣ation\n\ndescription Page 94\n\nwas partly upon an Eminence, and partly upon the declivity of the Hill. The Mountain Taygeta com∣mands it on the West.\n\nFrom that vastness it once had, it is now shrunk to a little Town, scarce∣ly shewing any remains of its for∣mer Glory: Although it had no Walls for Eight hundred Years, yet it maintained it self very well a∣gainst its Enemies, and of those that afterwards incompassed it, though they have been often rebuilt; there is now only the Castle and the Foun∣dations, where they once stood, to be seen. It has but two great Gates, one on the North side towards Na∣poli di Romania, the other on the West towards Exokorion, to which answer two High-ways or great Roads, one called Aphetais or grand Bazar, the other Hellerion.\n\nThe Inhabitants are exposed to ex∣cessive heats during the Summer: for besides that the City lyes full South, being seated at the Foot of the Moun∣tain, the Suns Rays by this oppositi∣on are reflected and redouble the heat.\n\ndescription Page 95\n\nThe Learned Monsieur La Guilleti∣ere being some years ago upon the place, took the height of the Pole three several days one after another, viz. the 19. 20, and 21, of June, and regulating himself by the Meridian height of the Sun, by the Shadow of a Cylindrical Body, divided into a thousand equal Parts, the difference of the Shadows at these three Ob∣servations was unperceivable, and the length of the Shadow was still found to be 211 Parts of the Cylinder; whence he concluded the Sun was 12 degrees and 56 Minutes from the Zenith, and the Latitude of Mysitra 35 degrees and 26 Minutes.\n\nThe City is divided into four Quarters, each of which being sepa∣rated from the rest, makes of it self a disunited Body. The Castle is one of them, the City another, and two Suburbs the other; where∣of the one is called Melokerion, that is to say the middle Suburb, and the other is called Exokorion or the outward Suburb, by the Turks named likewise Maratche.\n\ndescription Page 96\n\nThe Exokorion is separated from the other three by the River Vas••li Potamos, and has no Communicati∣on with them but by a Stone B••••••ge.\n\nThe Castle named to Castron is seated on an Eminence, is of a conical Figure, and has good Walls; it had some years since Ten Pieces of Artillery, and a Garrison of Eighteen or Twenty Janisaries Com∣manded by a Disdar that seldom re∣sides there.\n\nThere are always Magazines well stored with Corn for the Armies use, for each Turkish Family is ob∣liged to bring his Corn in to renew the Store every year. There are al∣so some Cisterns, and in the midst of the Castle a Mosque, once a Christian Church.\n\nThis Citadel is so advantagiously situated, that Histories assure us it was never taken, though Mahomet the Second and the Venetians have At∣tacked it with great Vigour.\n\nIt was a work of the Despotes in the declining of the Greek Empire, and that because the old Castle sea∣ted\n\ndescription Page 97\n\non the opposite Hill, whereof now the Ruines are only to be seen, did not sufficiently Command the Town.\n\nIt is not certain who was the first Founder of Sparta, Historians not yet agreeing thereon: Some say 'twas Spartus the Son of King Amiclas; others, the Princess, King Lacedaemon's Wife, who was called Sparta; many affirm 'twas Cecrops, who likewise founded Athens; and again others attribute its Foundation to Spartus the Son of Phoroneus, King of Argos, Contemporary with Jacob the Patriarch, 1763 Years be∣fore the Birth of Christ, since ac∣cording to the Calculation of Fa∣ther Petau, the Patriarch Jacob was born 1876 Years before the Year of our Redemption, so that to this present Year 1687, there are 3422 Years since the building of this Ci∣ty; therefore it is older than Rome 983 Years, than Carthage 867, than Syracusa 995, than Alexandria 1405, than Lyons 1639, and than Marseilles 1136.\n\ndescription Page 98\n\nThere never was any Nation in the whole World that may be com∣pared to the Lacedaemonians for Poli∣ty, and they never had a King but one of their own People; and these People only have seen upon their Royal Throne two Virtuous and de∣serving Heads circled with the same Diadem; and often amongst them have been sound Prodigies for Wis∣dom and the Art of Governing, that they have been thought the only Politicians; and upon these Foun∣dations 'tis that it could endure and flourish 800 years; it declined in its Prosperity and Glory, when it lost Colemanes the third King of that name.\n\nFinally, the Eastern Empire ha∣ving been divided into Temata or general Governments, Lacedaemon was made an Appendant to the Em∣perors eldest Son; since when it lost its name of Lacedaemon, and was on∣ly called Sparta; and its Princes who had under their Dominion the whole Morea were called De∣spotes.\n\ndescription Page 99\n\nThe Despote Theodorus, who E∣spoused the Daughter of Renier Prince of Athens, and was Brother to Andronicus and Emanuel, who succeeded each other in the Em∣pire; finding himself unable to at∣tempt to resist Bajazet, treated with Philibert de Naillac Prior of Aqui∣tain, and great Master of Rhodes, a∣bout the Sale of Sparta and Corinth; which Treaty was almost conclu∣ded, when Tamerlain Triumphing o∣ver Bajazet, the Spartans were so en∣couraged thereat, that they absolute∣ly refused to consent to Theodore's Alienation of Tzaconia, and the Peo∣ple being in a Tumult, the two De∣puties for the great Master, that were to take possession of the Go∣vernment had notice that it was their best way to retire, or other∣wise they should be treated as E∣nemies; and so they lost Corinth a∣gain, when they were already in possession thereof, and Theodore was not well pleased to refund the Money he had so lately singe∣red.\n\ndescription Page 100\n\nAt last he dying, left the De∣spotate to one of his Nephews of his own name, Son to the Empe∣ror Emanuel: this new Despote mar∣ried an Italian Lady of the House of Malatesta, upon which that Fa∣mily grounds a right to the Duché of Sparta. Theodore the Second took a Resolution to go to Constantinople, to succeed his Brother John in the Empire, leaving his Despotate to his Brother Constantine; it was at this time that Amurath the First made an irruption into Tzaconia. Constan∣tine being raised to the Imperial Throne, Sparta fell to Demetrius, out of whose hands 'twas ravisht by Mahomet the Second, who barbarou∣sly sawed the Governour of the Ca∣stle in two.\n\nIn the Year 1473 Benedetto Col∣leone, who had the command of the Venetian Army conquered Spar∣ta, and had well nigh reduced the Citadel.
