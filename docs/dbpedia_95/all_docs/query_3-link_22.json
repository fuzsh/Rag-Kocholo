However, VTE burden among non‐ICU patients hospitalized for COVID‐19 that receive guideline‐recommended thromboprophylaxis is unknown.\n\nObjectives\n\nTo determine the incidence of VTE among non‐ICU patients hospitalized for COVID‐19 that receive pharmacological thromboprophylaxis.\n\nMethods\n\nWe performed a systematic screening for the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) by lower limb vein compression ultrasonography (CUS) in consecutive non‐ICU patients hospitalized for COVID‐19, independent of the presence of signs or symptoms of DVT. All patients were receiving pharmacological thromboprophylaxis with either enoxaparin or fondaparinux.\n\nResults\n\nThe population that we screened consisted of 84 consecutive patients, with a mean age of 67.6 ± 13.5 years and a mean Padua Prediction Score of 5.1 ± 1.6. Seventy‐two patients (85.7%) had respiratory insufficiency, required oxygen supplementation, and had reduced mobility or were bedridden. In this cohort, we found 10 cases of DVT, with an incidence of 11.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.98‐18.82). Of these, 2 were proximal DVT (incidence rate 2.4%, 95% CI −0.87‐5.67) and 8 were distal DVT (incidence rate 9.5%, 95% CI 3.23‐5.77). Significant differences between subjects with and without DVT were D‐dimer > 3000 µg/L (P < .05), current or previous cancer (P < .05), and need of high flow nasal oxygen therapy and/or non‐invasive ventilation (P < .01).\n\nConclusions\n\nDVT may occur among non‐ICU patients hospitalized for COVID‐19, despite guideline‐recommended thromboprophylaxis.\n\nKeywords\n\nCOVID‐19\n\ndeep vein thrombosis\n\nthromboprophylaxis\n\nvenous thromboembolism\n\nEssentials\n\n•\n\nThe incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) among patients hospitalized for COVID‐19 is unknown.\n\n•\n\nA screening for DVT was performed in COVID‐19 patients that were receiving thromboprophylaxis.\n\n•\n\nThe incidence of DVT was 11.9% (95% confidence interval 4.98‐18.82).

Indeed, subjects hospitalized for COVID‐19 are the prototypical example of acutely ill medical patients at increased risk of VTE, as they suffer from an acute infection; may have acute respiratory failure; and often are bedridden, or have reduced mobility, because they need oxygen supplementation and/or are isolated in their room due to hospital restrictions. The concomitant presence of these conditions substantially increases the risk of VTE, and this risk may be even higher if other factors, such as cancer, history of previous VTE, and age ≥70 years, exist.\n\n3.\n\nBarbar S.\n\nNoventa F.\n\nRossetto V.\n\net al.\n\nA risk assessment model for the identification of hospitalized medical patients at risk for venous thromboembolism: the Padua Prediction Score.\n\nIn addition, some COVID‐19 patients may have significant abnormalities of coagulation parameters, including D‐dimer levels above >1000 μg/L,\n\n4.\n\nZhou F.\n\nYu T.\n\nDu R.\n\net al.\n\nClinical course and risk factors for mortality of adult inpatients with COVID‐19 in Wuhan, China: a retrospective cohort study.\n\nand this further supports the concept that VTE needs to be properly prevented in these patients.\n\nA remarkably high incidence of VTE has been recently reported among COVID‐19 patients assisted in the intensive care unit (ICU), although all patients were receiving at least thromboprophylactic doses of anticoagulants.\n\n5.\n\nKlok F.A.\n\nKruipb M.J.\n\nvan der Meerc N.J.\n\net al.\n\nIncidence of thrombotic complications in critically ill ICU patients with COVID‐19.\n\n,\n\n6.\n\nLlitjos J.F.\n\nLeclerc M.\n\nChochois C.\n\net al.\n\nHigh incidence of venous thromboembolic events in anticoagulated severe COVID‐19 patients.\n\nAlso, there are autopsy data indicating that deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary embolism (PE), and various types of microvascular pathology may be found in patients deceased for COVID‐19, although such findings have not been confirmed in other autopsy series.\n\n7.\n\nAckermann M.\n\nVerleden S.E.\n\nKuehnel M.\n\net al.\n\nPulmonary vascular endothelialitis, thrombosis, and angiogenesis in COVID‐19.\n\n,\n\n8.\n\nSchaller T.\n\nHirschbühl K.\n\nBurkhardt K.\n\net al.\n\nPostmortem examination of patients with COVID‐19.\n\n,\n\n9.\n\nWichmann D.\n\nSperhake J.P.\n\nLütgehetmann M.\n\net al.\n\nAutopsy findings and venous thromboembolism in patients With COVID‐19.\n\nBased on this and other anecdotal reports, many physicians are advocating the empiric use of therapeutic anticoagulation even in patients who do not have a documented diagnosis of VTE.\n\n10.\n\nPorfidia A.\n\nPola R.\n\nVenous thromboembolism and heparin use in COVID‐19 patients: juggling between pragmatic choices, suggestions of medical societies and the lack of guidelines.\n\nOn the other hand, the current position of the majority of medical societies still is to use standard prophylactic doses of anticoagulation for hospitalized COVID‐19 patients, as is recommended for other acutely ill medical patients.\n\n11.\n\nThachil J.\n\nTang N.\n\nGando S.\n\net al.\n\nISTH interim guidance on recognition and management of coagulopathy in COVID‐19.\n\n,\n\n12.\n\nZhai Z.\n\nLi C.\n\nChen Y.\n\net al.\n\nPrevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism associated with coronavirus disease 2019 infection: a consensus statement before guidelines.\n\nIn this study, we performed a systematic screening for the diagnosis of DVT in non‐ICU consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID‐19 that were receiving pharmacological thromboprophylaxis.\n\n2. METHODS\n\nAll the patients affected by COVID‐19 and hospitalized at the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli IRCCS (Rome, Italy) between 3 April 2020 and 10 April 2020 were included in the study, with the exception of those younger than 18 years, those assisted in the ICU, and those receiving full‐dose anticoagulant therapy for conditions such as atrial fibrillation and/or previous VTE. All patients had an established diagnosis of infection by SARS‐CoV‐2, confirmed by a positive molecular assay on oral/nasopharyngeal swabs. All patients were receiving a prophylactic dose of anticoagulant (either enoxaparin 40 mg once daily or fondaparinux 2.5 mg daily) since the first day of hospitalization, in keeping with the internal guidelines of our University Hospital for the prevention of VTE.\n\nVenous compression ultrasonography (CUS) of the legs was performed on all enrolled patients during hospital stay, using a Philips CX50 portable ultrasound system, and consisted in the assessment of the proximal and distal deep venous system of both legs. The distal veins included in the study were the posterior tibial, fibular, gastrocnemius (internal and external), and soleal veins. All venous segments were examined in real‐time B‐mode using color Doppler in transverse and longitudinal views. Lack of compressibility, or direct identification of an endoluminal thrombus, were the criteria used for the diagnosis of DVT, as established in the literature.\n\n13.\n\nRighini M.\n\nLe Gal G.\n\nAujesky D.\n\net al.\n\nComplete venous ultrasound in outpatients with suspected pulmonary embolism.\n\nDemographic data, clinical characteristics, and laboratory results were collected from the medical charts of our hospital. Respiratory insufficiency was defined as PaO2 <60 mm Hg and/or PaCO2 >50 mm Hg in room air, or need for oxygen supplementation. Complete blood tests were available for all patients, including D‐dimer levels, which were assessed by using a latex agglutination test. The Padua Prediction Score (PPS) was calculated for all patients.\n\nData are presented as means ± standard deviation (SD), or number and percentage when appropriate. T test or Mann‐Whitney U test were used to assess differences between groups of patients. P < .05 was defined as statistically significant. Statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS software version 21.0 (IBM).\n\nThe study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario A. Gemelli IRCCS (Rome, Italy; ID number 3149). Due to the nature of the study, the Ethics Committee waived the need for informed consent.\n\n3. RESULTS\n\nA total of 84 hospitalized COVID‐19 patients were studied. The demographic, clinical, and laboratory data of the studied population are presented in Table 1. The mean age was 67.6 ± 13.5 years. There were 61 males (72.6%) and 23 females (27.4%). The following comorbidities were present at the time of hospital admission: hypertension in 45 patients (53.6%), type 2 diabetes mellitus in 18 patients (21.4%), obesity in 15 patients (17.9%), history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and/or cardiovascular disease (CVD) in 11 patients (13.1%), cancer (current or previous) in 14 patients (16.7%). Three patients (3.6%) had history of previous VTE. Recent trauma and/or recent surgery were found in eight patients (9.5%). The mean length of hospital stay of this cohort was 24.0 ± 13.5 days. There were eight deaths, with a mortality rate of 9.5%. At the time of CUS examination, 72 patients (85.7%) had respiratory insufficiency, required oxygen supplementation, and had reduced mobility or were bedridden. High flow nasal oxygen therapy and/or non‐invasive ventilation (NIV) was required in 15 patients (17.8%). The mean platelet count was 266 ± 120 × 109/L. The mean D‐dimer level was 4108 ± 7098 µg/L. Forty‐six patients (54.8%) had D‐dimer level >1500 µg/L. Twenty‐three patients (27.4%) had D‐dimer level >3000 µg/L. The mean prothrombin time (PT) was 11.2 ± 0.7 seconds.\n\nTABLE 1Demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics of the 84 patients hospitalized for COVID‐19 who underwent CUS\n\nCharacteristicNumber (%) or mean (±SD)Mean age, years ± SD67.6 ± 13.5Men, n (%)61 (72.6)Obesity, n (%)15 (17.9)Hypertension, n (%)45 (53.6)Type 2 diabetes mellitus, n (%)18 (21.4)CAD and/or CVD, n (%)11 (13.1)Cancer (previous or current), n (%)14 (16.7)Previous VTE, n (%)3 (3.6)Trauma or recent surgery, n (%)8 (9.5)Acute infectious disease, n (%)84 (100.0)Reduced mobility, n (%)72 (85.7)Acute respiratory failure with oxygen supplementation, n (%)72 (85.7)High flow nasal oxygen therapy or NIV15 (17.8)Mean hemoglobin level, g/L ± SD12.9 ± 13.0Mean white blood cell count, 109 × L ± SD5831 ± 2825Mean platelet count, 109 × L ± SD266 ± 120Mean D‐dimer level, μg/L ± SD4108 ± 7098D‐dimer >1500 μg/L, n (%)46 (54.8)D‐dimer >3000 μg/L, n (%)23 (27.4)Mean fibrinogen level, mg/dL ± SD499 ± 170Mean PT, seconds ± SD11.2 ± 0.7Mean length of hospital stay, days ± SD24.0 ± 13.5Deaths, n (%)8 (9.5)\n\nAbbreviations: CAD, coronary artery disease; CUS, compression ultrasonography; CVD, cardiovascular disease; NIV, non‐invasive ventilation; PT, prothrombin time; SD, standard deviation; VTE, venous thromboembolism.\n\nTable 2 presents information on the PPS and the type of prophylactic anticoagulation used in the enrolled patients. It also presents the data in the incidence rate of DVT. The PPS was 4 in 44 patients (52.4%), 5 in 17 patients (20.3%), and >5 in 23 patients (27.4%). The mean value of PPS was 5.1 ± 1.6. All patients (100.0%) were on anticoagulant thromboprophylaxis since the first day of hospitalization, in the majority of cases with enoxaparin and in a small number of cases with fondaparinux. CUS was performed 5.8 ± 2.2 days after hospital admission. In five cases, it was performed within the first 48 hours from hospital admission. In none of these cases a diagnosis of DVT was performed. A DVT was found in 10 patients, with an overall incidence of 11.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.98‐18.82). In eight cases, they were distal DVT (located in veins below the knee: peroneal, posterior, anterior tibial, and muscular veins), with an incidence rate of 9.5% (95% CI 3.23‐15.77). There were two proximal DVT, with an incidence rate of 2.4% (95% CI −0.87‐5.67). In four cases, DVT was bilateral. Signs or symptoms of DVT (such as pain, swelling, warmth, redness, cramps, bluish or whitish skin discoloration at the level of the lower limb) were present only in 2 of the 10 patients with DVT.\n\nTABLE 2Padua Prediction Score (PPS), type of pharmacological thromboprophylaxis, and incidence of thrombosis among patients hospitalized for COVID‐19 who underwent CUS\n\nCharacteristicNumber (%) or mean (SD)PPS = 4, n (%)44 (52.4)PPS = 5, n (%)17 (20.3)PPS > 5, n (%)23 (27.4)PPS, mean ± SD5.1 ± 1.6Pharmacological thromboprophylaxis, n (%)84 (100.0)Enoxaparin 40 mg once daily82 (97.6)Fondaparinux 2.5 mg once daily2 (2.4)DVT, n (%), (95% CI)10 (11.9) (4.98‐18.82)Proximal DVT, n (%), (95% CI)2 (2.4) (−0.87‐5.67)Distal DVT, n (%), (95% CI)8 (9.5) (3.23‐15.77)Bilateral DVT, n (%), (95% CI)4 (4.7) (0.17‐9.23)Symptomatic DVT, n (%), (95% CI)2 (2.4) (−0.87‐5.67)Mean length of hospital stay at the time of CUS, days ± SD5.8 ± 2.2\n\nAbbreviations: CUS, compression ultrasonography; DVT, deep vein thrombosis; PPS, Padua Prediction Score; SD, standard deviation.\n\nSubjects with DVT did not differ from those without DVT in terms of age, sex, and frequency of obesity, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and CAD/CVD. Also, their PPS was similar to that displayed by subjects without DVT. Likewise, mean D‐dimer levels, PT, and platelet count were similar between the two groups. However, the number of subjects with D‐dimer level >3000 µg/L was significantly higher in the DVT group than in the non‐DVT group (P < .05). In addition, subjects with DVT had higher incidence of cancer (either current or previous; 40.0% versus 13.5%, P < .05) and more frequently required high flow nasal oxygen therapy and/or NIV, compared with subjects without DVT (60.0% versus 8.1%, P < .01).

DISCUSSION\n\nThis study provides information on the incidence of DVT among non‐ICU patients hospitalized for COVID‐19 that receive guideline‐recommended thromboprophylaxis. We found 10 cases of DVT among the 84 patients included in the study, with an overall incidence of 11.9%. Our findings are consistent with those of Demelo‐Rodriguez et al, who recently reported an incidence of DVT of 14.7% among 156 patients hospitalized in non‐ICUs with diagnosis of COVID‐19 pneumonia.\n\n14.\n\nDemelo‐Rodríguez P.\n\nCervilla‐Muñoz E.\n\nOrdieres‐Ortega L.\n\net al.\n\nIncidence of asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis in patients with COVID‐19 pneumonia and elevated D‐dimer levels.\n\nThe incidence of DVT that we found is high, compared with the results of the randomized double‐blind MEDENOX trial, which is the landmark study that assessed the incidence of DVT among acutely ill hospitalized medical patients receiving pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. Indeed, in the MEDENOX Study, 16 DVT were found among 291 patients treated with enoxaparin, with an incidence of 5.5%.\n\n15.\n\nSamama M.M.\n\nCohen A.T.\n\nDarmon J.Y.\n\net al.\n\nA comparison of enoxaparin with placebo for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in acutely Ill medical patients.\n\nHowever, it is important to point out that the increased incidence of DVT that we found in our study was mainly due to a relatively high number of distal DVT, while the incidence of proximal DVT was not substantially different from that observed in the MEDENOX trial. In particular, the incidence of distal DVT in our study and in the MEDENOX trial was 9.5% and 3.8%, respectively, while the incidence of proximal DVT in our study was 2.4% and in the MEDENOX study was 1.7%. Nonetheless, it should be noted that in the MEDENOX study the diagnosis of DVT was done by venography, while we used CUS, which is known to have lower sensitivity for the diagnosis of DVT in asymptomatic patients.\n\n16.\n\nKeller F.\n\nFlosbach C.W.\n\nPRIME Study Group\n\nA randomised multicentre study investigating the efficacy and safety of the low molecular weight heparin enoxaparin versus unfractionated heparin in the prevention of thromboembolism in immobilised medical patients.\n\n,\n\n17.\n\nHarenberg J.\n\nRoebruck P.\n\nHeene D.L.\n\nSubcutaneous low‐molecularweight heparin versus standard heparin and the prevention of thromboembolism in medical inpatients.\n\nTherefore, it is possible to hypothesize that in our study the number of COVID‐19 patients with DVT could have been higher if venography had been used. Another important randomized placebo‐controlled study that assessed the incidence of DVT among acutely ill hospitalized medical patients receiving pharmacological thromboprophylaxis is the PREVENT trial.\n\n18.\n\nLeizorovicz A.\n\nCohen A.T.\n\nTurpie A.G.\n\nOlsson C.G.\n\nVaitkus P.T.\n\nGoldhaber S.Z.\n\nRandomized placebo‐controlled trial of dalteparin for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in acutely ill medical patients.\n\nIn this study, subjects treated with dalteparin displayed a 2.7% incidence of proximal DVT, which is similar to what we found in our study. Of note, in the PREVENT trial, the diagnosis of DVT was done by CUS, as it was done in our study. A difference is that distal DVT were not assessed in the PREVENT trial, based on the concept that their clinical relevance is not well established. We decided instead to search for distal DVT, because we believe that the risk of extension of thrombosis to proximal veins may be high in COVID‐19 patients. Whether the incidence of DVT is higher in COVID‐19 patients than in subjects affected by other acute viral respiratory infections remains to be determined. Indeed, high rates of thrombotic complications have been reported also during the H1N1 influenza virus pandemic and the various outbreaks of SARS‐CoV infection.\n\n19.\n\nBunce P.E.\n\nHigh S.M.\n\nNadjafi M.\n\nStanley K.\n\nLiles W.C.\n\nChristian M.D.\n\nPandemic H1N1 influenza infection and vascular thrombosis.\n\n,\n\n20.\n\nAvnon A.S.\n\nMunteanu D.\n\nSmoliakov A.\n\nJotkowitz A.\n\nBarski L.\n\nThromboembolic events in patients with severe pandemic influenza A/H1N1.\n\n,\n\n21.\n\nAgarwal P.P.\n\nCinti S.\n\nKazerooni E.A.\n\nChest radiographic and CT findings in novel swine‐origin influenza A (H1N1) virus (S‐OIV) infection.\n\n,\n\n22.\n\nHarms P.W.\n\nSchmidt L.A.\n\nSmith L.B.\n\net al.\n\nAutopsy findings in eight patients with fatal H1N1 influenza.\n\n,\n\n23.\n\nXiang‐Hua Y.\n\nLe‐Min W.\n\nAi‐Bin L.\n\net al.\n\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome and venous thromboembolism in multiple organs.\n\nOf note, the patients that had DVT in our study did not differ from those without DVT in terms of age, male sex, and comorbidities. Also mean PPS, D‐dimer levels, PT, and platelet count were similar between patients with and without DVT. There were, though, some statistically significant differences. One was that patients with DVT more often had D‐dimer levels >3000 µg/L, compared with subjects without DVT. This is interesting, because a D‐dimer cut‐off value of 3000 µg/L has been recently associated with mortality in non‐ICU COVID‐19 patients treated with heparin.\n\n24.\n\nTang N.\n\nBai H.\n\nChen X.\n\nGong J.\n\nLi D.\n\nSun Z.\n\nAnticoagulant treatment is associated with decreased mortality in severe coronavirus disease 2019 patients with coagulopathy.\n\nInstead, we did not find a difference between DVT and non‐DVT patients when subjects with D‐dimer level >1500 µg/L were considered, although this D‐dimer value has been recently proposed as a cut‐off to predict thrombosis in COVID‐19 patients assisted in the ICU.\n\n25.\n\nCui S.\n\nChen S.\n\nLi X.\n\nLiu S.\n\nWang F.\n\nPrevalence of venous thromboembolism in patients with severe novel coronavirus pneumonia.\n\nOur study has some limitations. First, the number of patients is relatively small and therefore our findings need to be confirmed in larger samples. Second, CUS was performed relatively early during hospitalization and not at the same time point for all patients; therefore, it is possible that DVT that developed at later stages during the hospital stay were not identified. Also, CUS was never performed at the moment of hospitalization. Therefore, we cannot exclude that some patients had developed DVT before hospitalization, when they were not yet receiving anticoagulant prophylaxis. Third, we have no data on the clinical outcome of patients with DVT compared to subjects without DVT. Finally, we did not look for PE and this is an important issue that needs to be addressed by additional studies in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, our study shows that DVT is not uncommon among non‐ICU patients hospitalized for COVID‐19, despite the use of guideline‐recommended thromboprophylaxis. The best thromboprophylactic strategy to use in COVID‐19 patients remains to be determined.\n\nCONFLICTS OF INTEREST\n\nThe authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.\n\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nA.
