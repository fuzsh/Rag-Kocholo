        "text": "Introducing the ultimate all-round machine, the Harlem Thrive.\n\nCombining over 25 years of experience in creating best-selling high-performance kites with the latest groundbreaking innovations, the Thrive is the pinnacle of Ralf Groeselâ€™s design work. The Thrive is simply the lightest, most sustainably made, high-performance, all-round kite on the market.\n\nDesigned by Ralf Groesel and 5 x times World Champion Aaron Hadlow, and crafted at Brainchild Production, the Thrive is a 3-stut masterpiece that performs in all conditions across all disciplines.\n\nWith the 9-meter coming at an impressive 2.300 kg, it is an ultra-light, versatile, easy to ride and accessible kite, made to take your skills (and yourself) to a stratospheric level.\n\nKey Features:\n\nPROWELD Dacron Leading Edge: The innovative technique drastically reduces weight of the leading edge while increasing the overall strength, stiffness, and stability of the airframe, ensuring comfortable and effortless handling in any situation, from light breezes to perfect storms.\n\nLaminated Mila Struts: Made in Europe, the laminated Mila Struts enhance the airframe's strength and lightweight abilities.\n\nTwin-cross Flylite Canopy: Made in Europe, this ultra-light material boosts durability and flying performance, providing an unparalleled flying sensation and confidence on the water.\n\nWingtip Curved Closing Seam: Adds extra stability and enhanced control.\n\nFuture Trailing Edge Construction: Exclusive to Harlem Kitesurfing, this feature reduces weight and eliminates flutter with enhanced durability and resistance to tear and wear.\n\n7-Point Fixed Bridle System: Ensures unmatched stability and intuitive direct control in all conditions.\n\nInflation system: The wide, recycled ready single-point inflation system ensures maximum air flow and rapid inflation\n\nAchieving a true aerodynamic balance, the Thrive has unparalleled upwind performance, predictable and direct steering, exceptional depower capabilities and unmatched vertical jump abilities, making it the most versatile high-performing kite on the market.\n\nStep up your game with the game-changing evolution.\n\nAvailable sizes: 5 / 6 / 7 / 8 / 9 / 10 / 11 / 12 / 13 / 15 / 17\n\nCrafted to leave nothing but a great ride and a positive impact on the planet, the Thrive is built with eco-conscious materials and sustainable production methods.\n\nEuropean Craftsmanship\n\nThe Thrive is produced at the Brainchild Production facility located in North Macedonia, using locally sourced and where possible recycled raw materials.\n\nCanopy and Mila Struts from the artisan hands of France.\n\n100% recycled webbing used for reinforcements created in Germany.\n\n100% recycled yarns meticulously crafted in Austria.\n\nSolar-powered production\n\nA beacon of innovation, the factory operates entirely on solar energy, setting a precedent for eco-friendly manufacturing.\n\nSustainable vision\n\nOur dedication to sustainability knows no limits. By 2029, our aim is to elevate the usage of recycled materials to an impressive 90%, solidifying our commitment to a greener future. Today, we're creating gear that defines our playgrounds of tomorrow.\n\nDigital Printing\n\nTraditionally kites use screen printing, adding unnecessary weight and constraints to design and creativity but also impose significant environmental burdens. The Thrive featured the game changing Digital Eco Printing technology, using non-coloured fabrics and eco-friendly ink, saving up to four times more water and energy compared to traditional methods. The new method allows us to minimise our environmental footprint, while also unlocks boundless design and customisation possibilities.\n\nLetâ€™s be honest. Most kites designs arenâ€™t particularly special, let alone customisable. But the tides are changing.\n\nThanks to the digital printing technique we can offer you an unprecedented level of customisation with unrivaled quality and a positive environmental impact. There are almost no limitations to design and quantity.\n\nWant to ride a kite with your brandâ€™s logo, or the Mona Lisa on it? With the Digital Eco Printing method now you can, while also making a significant step towards a greener future."
