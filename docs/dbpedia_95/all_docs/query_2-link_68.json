        "text": "About the Producer\n\nThe farm business Lunadoro is based in Valiano, near the well-known town of Montepulciano, within the Val d’Orcia Natural Park. The estate extends over an area of 40 ha on a ridge, 12 of which are vineyards. In 2006 the wine cellar was completely renovated by local architects and engineers, and modern vinification technologies were implemented together with traditional oak casks where wine rests and is aged. Lunadoro is a member of the “Consorzio del Nobile” and carries out a closed-cycle production, which means it has a vinification cellar, a storage cellar and a cellar for barrel and bottle aging. In 2016 the company was taken over by Schenk Italian Wineries, one of the most important Italian wine producers based in Ora (Bolzano). For several years, Schenk has been investing in the Italian market by purchasing farm businesses in appealing areas that are particularly suitable for the production of wine, with the aim of offering products of ever-increasing quality that truly represent the local territory as well as its traditions and culture.\n\nVineyard\n\nThe vineyards of Lunadoro are located in the area around Valiano, at about 332 meters a.s.l. The soils are clay and the climate is influenced from both the Val di Chiana and the Trasimeno Lake. This area benefits from a favourable wind exposure, which assures the gradual and complete ripening of the grapes.\n\nThe vineyards (10 ha are cultivated with Sangiovese and 2 ha with Merlot and Petit Verdot) adopt the spur-trained system, obtained by the short pruning (2 buds) of a variable number of renewal spurs (about 4-5 spurs). Each hectare has a density of 5,000 plants and a yield of 7.5 tons of grapes. All the selection and production steps are carried out manually, in perfect harmony with the environment: from pruning to the choice of the best buds, from the control of the vegetation to the thinning out of bunches. The harvest is carried out only by hand and - during destemming - the grapes are selected to retain only those of the highest quality."
