        "text": "In August 2011 I wrote about Boccaccio and his \"Decamerone\".\n\nThis was here.\n\nhttp://tarotforum.net/showthread.php?t=163397&highlight=boccaccio\n\nI analyzed there something about a connection between the \"7 virtues\" and the general structure of the Decamerone text, which knows 10 story-tellers, which tell at 10 days in two weeks 100 stories (actually 101), each of them 10 and each one at each day, which was dedicated to storytelling.\n\n3 of the story-tellers are men, 7 are women, and actually the 7 stand for the 7 virtues. But which woman refers to which virtue? Boccaccio had much fun to hide this relation.\n\nThat's a nice question and it found different answers in the commenting works of literature research. I've my own.\n\n... ... I'm proud of this analysis (though it isn't really finished), actually this is a master-piece according my not very humble opinion ....though I think, that nobody really noted, how good it indeed is.\n\n***********\n\nBoccaccio's Decamerone and its Virtues\n\nNow, in my longer attempt to analyze the Poilly decks I detect similarity between some of the Poilly arrangements of the virtues and the virtues list in Boccaccio's Decamerone (as analyzed by myself).\n\nNow I suspect, that somebody in Poilly's time detected that, what I detected, and embedded it into the new construction ... so that's rather interesting to myself.\n\nI think, the basic order of the virtues (at least in the Decamerone) was this:\n\n1. Temperantia = cardinal virtue = XXX\n\n2. Spes = theological virtue = XXX\n\n3. Prudentia = cardinal virtue = XXXi\n\n4. Fides or Caritas = theological virtue = XXX\n\n5. Fortitudo = cardinal virtue = XXX\n\n6. Caritas or Fides = theological virtue = XXX\n\n7. Iustitia = cardinal virtue = XXX\n\nThe three theological virtues are switched in an ordered manner between the 4 cardinal virtues. (about the position of Caritas and Fides I'm\n\nBoccaccio gives this \"correct order\" at the last story-telling day, though with one \"intended error\".\n\nIf Boccaccio had made it simple, it would look this way:\n\n1 Neifile = cardinal virtue Temperance\n\n2 Elissa = theological virtue Hope\n\n3 Filomena = cardinal virtue Prudentia\n\n4 Lauretta = theological virtue Caritas or Fides\n\n5 Emilia = cardinal virtue Fortitudo\n\n6 Fiammeta = theological virtue Fides or Caritas\n\n7 Pampinea = cardinal virtue Justice\n\n----------------\n\n8 Filostrato ... man\n\n9 Panfilo ... man\n\n10 Diodeo ... man\n\nNo, Boccaccio made it not simple. He made as speaker order for the last day:\n\n1 Neifile = cardinal virtue Temperance\n\n2 Elissa = theological virtue Hope\n\n3 Filostrato = ... man CHANGED\n\n4 Lauretta = theological virtue Caritas or Fides\n\n5 Emilia = cardinal virtue Fortitudo\n\n6 Fiammeta = theological virtue Fides or Caritas\n\n7 Pampinea = cardinal virtue Justice\n\n----------------\n\n8 Filomena = cardinal virtue Prudentia CHANGED\n\n9 Panfilo ... man\n\n10 Diodeo ... man\n\n***************\n\nIn Minchiate\n\n... , which is - as Boccaccio - also \"from Florence\", we have the following order\n\n6. Temperantia = cardinal virtue\n\n7. Fortitudo = cardinal virtue\n\n8. Iustitia = cardinal virtue\n\n...\n\n16. Spes = theological virtue\n\n17. Prudentia = cardinal virtue appears as CHANGED\n\n18. Fides = theological virtue\n\n19. Caritas = theological virtue\n\n****************\n\nNormal Trionfi or Tarot in 15th and 16th century\n\nThere are usually only 3 virtues, and one appears either as \"disappeared\" or \"somehow replaced\". Naturally - again - it's Prudentia.\n\n****************\n\nA common play with missing virtues in art\n\nIt seems to have been a play in art for specific commissioners (I know it for Borso d'Este), to present only 6 virtues with the idea, that the 7th is presented by the commissioner himself. In Borso's case this was Iustitia, so \"missing virtues\" were not always the virtue Prudentia. But in Tarot Prudentia seems to be the major object for this sort of \"hiding-and-games\", as it had been already in the Decamerone long before.\n\n****************\n\nOccasionally \"Muses in Art\"\n\nIn the Palazzo Schifanoia picture of the month May with Apollo there appear naturally also the 9 Muses.\n\nOne of the Muses is artfully \"hidden\".\n\n****************\n\nNow to the Poilly deck\n\nThe following is a detail of the Poilly deck list, which I developed in the post before.\n\nThe virtues are presented by the violet color.\n\nPoilly-42 has ...\n\nPoilly-22 has ..\n\n01 Mercure (flying)\n\n02 L'amour (blind flying Eros with arrow and flowers)\n\n03 L'Esperence (woman at small island with big anchor; Hope)\n\n04 La Force (woman carrying a column)\n\n05 La Fortune Woman standing on wheel in the sea; wings at her feet)\n\n06 La Justice (woman with Libra and sword ... in the background a city view)\n\n07 La Charité (woman with two children)\n\n08 La Prudence (woman with mirror, snake)\n\n09 Les Ages, la Vieillesse\n\n10 Age Viril (hero with sword and shield and dragon; \"Golden Vlies\" in a tree)\n\n...\n\n[from post #3 ... http://tarotforum.net/showthread.php?t=170889#2 ]\n\n.. and Poilly-41 has\n\n[from post #2 ... http://tarotforum.net/showthread.php?t=170889#1 ]\n\n************\n\n... well, possibly not the best way to show, what I mean.\n\nAnother attempt. First we have to import the Etteilla deck:\n\n1. Motif NEW Chaos: ETTEILLA - Le Chaos - LE QUESTIONNANT :\n\n2. Motif Sun: ÉCLAICISSEMENT (1er jour de la création) - La Lumière - FEU\n\n3. Motif Moon: PROPOS (? jour de la création)- Les Plantes - EAU\n\n4. Motif Star: DÉPOUILLEMENT (2.e jour de la création)- Le Ciel - AIR (3.e Element)\n\n5. Motif World: VOYAGE (6.e jour de la création) - L'Homme et les Quadrupèdes - TERRE (3.e Element)\n\n6. Motif NEW \"Day and Night\", \"Astres\": LA NUIT (4.e jour de la création) - Les Astres - LE JOUR\n\n7. Motif NEW \"birds and fishs\": APPUI (5.e jour de la création) - Les Oiseaux et les Poissons - PROTECTION\n\n8. Motif NEW female questioner: ETTEILLA - Repos - LA QUESTIONNANTE\n\n9. Motif Justice: LA JUSTICE - La Justice - Le LEGISTE\n\n10. Motif Temperance: La TEMPÉRANCE - La Tempérance - LE PRÈTRE\n\n11. Motif Strength: LA FORCE - La Force - LE SOUVERAIN\n\n12. Motif Prudence: LA PRUDENCE - La Prudence - LE PEUPLE\n\n13. Motif Lovers ???? (Mariage): MARIAGE - Le Grand Prétre - UNION\n\n14. Motif Devil: FORCE MAJEURE - Le Diable - FORCE MAJEURE\n\n15. Motif Magician: MALADIE - Le Magicien, ou le Báteleur - MALADIE\n\n16. Motif Judgment (Angel): LE JUGEMENT - Le Jugement dernier - LE JUGEMENT\n\n17. Motif Death: MORTALITÉ - La Mort - NÉANT\n\n18. Motif Hermit: TRAITRE - Le Capucin - FAUX DÉVOT\n\n19. Motif Tower: MISÈRE - Le Temple foudroyé - PRISON\n\n20. Motif Fortune: FORTUNE - La Roue de Fortune - AUGMENTATION\n\n21. Motif Chariot: DISSENSION - Le Despot Africain - ARROGANCE\n\n0 Motif Fool: FOLIE FOLIE\n\nThen I make a reduced list to get a focus on the interesting points:\n\n... and then I think a little bit ...\n\nOne basic question about the Poilly deck is, how the Etteilla Tarocchi developed. The assumption, that the Poilly deck played a role in this developmwernt, was born, when it was realized, that the card Chaos appeared at Nr. 1 in the Poilly-42 deck and it appeared as Nr. 1 in the Etteilla.\n\nThis happened here:\n\ntarotforum.net/showthread.php?p=3020298&highlight=poilly#172\n\nThis hardly couldn't have been an accident, Etteilla should known the Poilly deck. In the development some interest was taken in the Petit Oracle des Dames ...\n\nhttp://tarotforum.net/showthread.php?t=171379\n\n... which is a clear prolongation of the Etteilla deck combined with some other divination decks material made before 1800, existing clearly with surviving decks since 1807.\n\nFor the current state of research the Petit Oracle is taken as a later riddle. First it's the interest to explain the Etteilla on the base of the Poilly deck development ... and only the trumps of it, the court and number cards are ignored.\n\n************\n\n\"1 Chaos\" comes from the Poilly-42 deck (it's not present in Poilly-41 and Poilly-22) and it is \"improved\" by Etteilla by 3 accompanying cards, which before haven't been used.\n\n1. Motif NEW Chaos: ETTEILLA - Le Chaos - LE QUESTIONNANT\n\n...\n\n6. Motif NEW \"Day and Night\", \"Astres\": LA NUIT (4.e jour de la création) - Les Astres - LE JOUR\n\n7. Motif NEW \"birds and fishs\": APPUI (5.e jour de la création) - Les Oiseaux et les Poissons - PROTECTION\n\n8. Motif NEW female questioner: ETTEILLA - Repos - LA QUESTIONNANTE\n\nChaos in the Poilly deck developed relative clearly from \"Chaos\" in the Hesiod text ...\n\n(ll. 116-138) Verily at the first Chaos came to be, but next wide-bosomed Earth, the ever-sure foundations of all the deathless ones who hold the peaks of snowy Olympus, and dim Tartarus in the depth of the wide-pathed Earth, and Eros (Love), fairest among the deathless gods, who unnerves the limbs and overcomes the mind and wise counsels of all gods and all men within them. From Chaos came forth Erebus and black Night; but of Night were born Aether and Day, whom she conceived and bare from union in love with Erebus. And Earth first bare starry Heaven, equal to herself, to cover her on every side, and to be an ever-sure abiding-place for the blessed gods. And she brought forth long Hills, graceful haunts of the goddess-Nymphs who dwell amongst the glens of the hills. She bare also the fruitless deep with his raging swell, Pontus, without sweet union of love. But afterwards she lay with Heaven and bare deep-swirling Oceanus, Coeus and Crius and Hyperion and Iapetus, Theia and Rhea, Themis and Mnemosyne and gold-crowned Phoebe and lovely Tethys. After them was born Cronos the wily, youngest and most terrible of her children, and he hated his lusty sire.\n\nhttp://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hesiod/theogony.htm\n\nThe surrounding of c. 1660 (assumed date for he Poilly decks, at least assumed by myself) knew a greater interest in Greek mythology (other cards show Mercury, Venus, Bacchus etc.), Etteilla had more Egyptian interests, but it's clear, that he was inspired by Genesis and its Tohu Wa-bohu.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tohu_wa-bohu\n\nEtteilla himself had developed earlier the \"Etteilla\", a personal card for the \"Questionnant\" as a 33rd card added to common Piquet deck with 32 cards. This was taken now to the Chaos card and it got a female counterpart in the presentation of the 7th day of creation (which presents \"completed genesis\"), as card Nr. 8, the \"Questionnante\", accompanied by two other new cards, mainly from the Genesis interpretation.\n\nFor the cards 2-5 Etteilla used 4 cards of the Aries-serie (Minchiate 36-39), and in their motifs he clearly was orientated towards the Tarot des Marseilles, not to the Poilly deck ...\n\n... BUT in their numbers (2-5) Etteilla imitated the Poilly-42 deck.\n\nThe 4 elements in the Poilly-42 (where they had come to from the earlier older Minchiate) at position 6-9 were moved as additional attribute to Sun-Moon-Star-World, the result was \"some free place\" which could be filled with Etteilla's new cards.\n\nSo far that's an easy game. Very clearly the Etteilla depends in some parts on the Poilly-42 deck.\n\nWell, the next step will follow.\n\nWell, the next step will follow.\n\nIn the last post I had explained ...\n\n... how the first cards of the Etteilla deck developed from Poilly-42 ... more or less.\n\nThe jump to a \"reversed Order\"\n\nNow in the larger context we see, that there was a jump to a \"reversed order\" between the versions Poilly-41/Poilly-22 and Poilly-42.\n\nA \"reversed order\" (in parts, not total) had been already observed for the Etteilla version (only a smaller part) and for the Petit Oracle des Dames (a much larger part).\n\nBut we see, that the jump from usual order to reversed order already happened in the Poilly deck time, it wasn't invented by Etteilla.\n\nEtteilla followed, Etteilla likely knew the Poilly deck and Etteilla imitated (in parts) the Poill deck.\n\nIn the Poilly-42 deck the \"reversed order in parts\" happened between Nr. 2 and Nr. 30. In the comparable (later) Petit Oracle des Dames we have the reversed order in parts between Nr. 1 and and Nr. 22, also not in the complete deck.\n\nSplitting the 5 Aries\n\nThe 5 Aries are the 5 highest trump in the older Minchiate. The row is usually ...\n\n40 Angel = Fama\n\n39 World\n\n38 Sun\n\n37 Moon\n\n36 Star\n\nIn the table we can see, that this group of 5 cards is split in a group of 4 (World-Sun-Moon-Star) and the single Angel-Fama element. The split (again) occurs between the versions Poilly-41/Poilly-22 and Poilly-42, and (again) \"Etteilla followed\", though in a somewhat different context.\n\nIn the Etteilla we have it ...\n\n... that the Fama-Angel is placed between \"5 bad cards\". In the Etteilla the 5 bad cards are ..\n\n14 Devil - 15 Magician - ... - 17 Death - 18 Hermit (= Traitor) - 19 Tower\n\n... and in the older Minchiate it had been ...\n\n11 Hermit (= crippled age) - 12 Hanging Man (= Traitor) - 13 Death - 14 Devil - 15 Tower\n\n... and with this sequence it appeared also in the Ferrarese order.\n\nIn other words, Etteilla replaced the Hanging Man with the Magician, after Gebelin (? likely) had changed before the Hanging Man to Prudentia.\n\nFAMA IS A VIRTUE\n\nNow we have a strange card somewhere else ...\n\n... in the Vieville deck (c. 1650), which later reappeared in the Belgian Tarot (c. 1780):\n\nIt's the card of Temperance, but the inscription says \"Sol Fama\". This is the \"Sol Fama riddle\" and we had a long discussion about it recently ...\n\nFama riddle thread\n\n... where it turned out, that this symbol was used already by Alciato around 1540, somehow also by Teofilo Folengo 1527, somehow by Boiardo and possibly it played already a role for Petrarca. We were not ale to clear all circumstances ... but there is something.\n\nWhat do we see now, when we see in the Poilly deck this sequence:\n\nWe see, that, if Fama was taken = Temperance, that under this condition the Poilly-42 deck had 6 virtues instead of 5.\n\nBut, if there were 6 virtues in the Poilly-42, then it seems likely, that there is somewhere a hidden 7th virtue. About \"hidden virtues\" I've already talked in this thread.\n\nhttp://tarotforum.net/showthread.php?t=170889&page=2#12\n\nBut if the Poilly-42 had \"7 virtues\" (2 of them hidden), then likely also the Poilly-41 and the Poilly-22 had 7 instead of 5 official virtues.\n\nThe (hyopothetical) discussion of the Poilly decks\n\nThe Time: I suggest, that the discussion took place c. 1660 and a little before, possibly the Tarot ballet of Marolles is an internal part of the discussion.\n\nWho discussed? Poilly the artist, Marolles as one of Poilly's commissioner, Mazarin as an old lover of playing cards, possibly the young French king Louis XIV himself, perhaps other courtiers at the court. The Poilly decks were just minor objects between many other (partly much more expensive) productions of art and festivities.\n\nBasis situation: Poilly came back from Italy and talked about the Minchiate game. Generally there was a negative trend against too much Italian influence, and part of this negativity aimed at Italian Tarocchi cards.\n\nMajor point of critique: There was an Emperor in the Italian Minchiate (and in the Italian Tarot). This was \"impossible\". Louis had the aim to become a great king himself. So - somehow - Poilly got the commission, to form a new French variant of Minchiate - naturally without any appearance of anything, which might remember the German Emperor.\n\nPoilly formed three variants. Likely: None of them gained a high attention, which one should conclude from the condition, that only few decks have survived. It seems, that the Poilly family later repeated productions of the decks, maybe 1730, maybe c. 1760.\n\nThe information is very spurious. I even was not able till now to see pictures of all 42, I think I know 23 of them.\n\nThe Way of the Virtues. And \"which is missing\"?\n\nNaturally one should likely expect additional virtues close to the other 5 virtues. With Fortune we have in ...\n\nPoilly-41: Fortune after the 5 virtues (5-9) at position 10\n\nPoilly-22: Fortune between the virtues (3-4 and 6-8) at position 5\n\nPoilly-42: Fortune outside the virtues (19-23) at a rather special position 30 (somehow \"highest trump\" below the zodiac)\n\nThe French relationship to the term Fortune might have been more intensive in France than elsewhere at least in late 14th century/begin 15th century. Fortune was then a very often used word. France had then - often enough - a not very lucky time, connected to losses in the 100 years French-English war. But \"Fortune\" changed, France recovered, and the whole finished with a French victory and enlarged French territory.\n\nIt might be, that this specific other relationship to \"Fortune\" still was living around 1650. I considered the possibility, if \"Fortune\" might have been interpreted as a \"virtue\" just around this time.\n\nhttp://www2.biusante.parisdescartes.fr/img/?refphot=07775&mod=s\n\nThis is from 1646 .... Vertu surmounts fortune ...\n\nSomehow it relates to this following text, which is variously reprinted with different titles.\n\nThis late picture from 1700 also belongs to one of the versions ...\n\nThe text, as far I got it (actually I DON'T FIND IT), somehow relates to some obscure fortunetelling system, possibly more on dreams. It's said to have had an anonymous author.\n\nThe first title \"Le Palais de Curieux ... \" (1646) seem to reflect \"Le Palais de Curieux\" (1612) of ..\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/François_Béroalde_de_Verville\n\n... François Béroalde de Verville. This was a rather active author, who is considered in alchemical contexts ...\n\nI've no note, that there is any real context between the 1612-version and the anonymous work of 1646.\n\n****\n\n... well, actually I should make a break here. The question around the missing virtues becomes complicated ... BUT ...\n\nJust following the analyses of the Poilly decks schemes, it seems, as if the deck designer replaced the two missing virtues Fides and Temperance ..\n\nin Poilly-41: with Fortune and Bacchus OR with Fortune and Love\n\nin Poilly-22: with Fortune and Love\n\nin Poilly-42: with Fortune and Fama-Angel\n\nNow the combination of \"Fortune and Love\" (as it appears in the analyzes of the Poilly decks) is an ideal title for Fortunetelling and for Fortunetelling books already since Lorenzo Spirito and the 15th century - at least.\n\nAnd second we have, that it looks, as if the Etteilla system would have been mother of the great cartomancy development in late 18th and first half of 19th century.\n\nAnd third we have, that the Etteilla looks like influenced by the Poilly decks.\n\nWhat shall one conclude from all these relations? Possibly, that already the Poilly decks had the intention to work as a sort of divination system with playing cards?\n\nThe condition, that not much Poilly decks survived, let's one assumes, that this method - if it REALLY existed - had found not much users. Well, everything starts small.\n\nFor the moment, this are only suspicions in my opinion.\n\n**************\n\nPoilly decks \"Fortune\"\n\nhttp://visualiseur.bnf.fr/CadresFenetre?O=IFN-8409718&I=8&M=chemindefer\n\nPoilly deck \"Love\"\n\nMitelli \"Love\"\n\nhttp://a.trionfi.eu/WWPCM/decks03/d01865/d01865.htm\n\nMitelli \"Fortune\"\n\nOccasionally I detect some similarity between cards of the Poilly decks and cards of the Mitelli versions. According my ideas the Poilly deck should be older. Well ... it's not enough similarity to make larger conclusions.\n\nBut Mitelli made another deck with 40 picture cards ..\n\ntarotforum.net/showthread.php?p=3020298&highlight=mitelli#172\n\n... possibly another byway of the Minchiate deck form."
