        "text": "This opens with a lot of citrus. But it’s not sharp. You get rose right off the bat it’s beautiful.\n\nDrying down you get the peony And Lily of the valley. Still all the Rose citrus coming through.\n\nIn the dry down at the very bottom, you get the cedar And the rose is still going, and the citrus fades a little, and you can smell the powdery violet I think that’s why people think this smells masculine. And absolutely a man could wear it.\n\nAs those are traditional, male notes, cedar violet citrus. But I’m still getting the rose and it’s a sweet rose not a masculine rose. This is so well blended that anyone could wear it. It’s so gorgeous. I don’t know why people think this is weak or A simple rose, perfume. It is certainly not.\n\nIt’s one of those fragrances that you can feel what the nose was doing every step of the way and it flows. It still has that aqua di Parma DNA with the citrus.\n\nJust lovely I’m surprised by how much I like this.\n\nThe middle is my favorite part citrus peony rose a little cedar. The mix of the rose and the lily of the valley gives you a little white floral vibe, but not too much if you don’t like white florals this is not that. It’s just enough.\n\nI think anyone can wear this of any age. This is for a woman in her prime, confident, feminine Sophisticated.\n\nThis is probably one of the most realistic rose scent--to me it smells like crushed rose petals: I get a slightly bitter, slightly salty (perhaps the ambergris?), and slightly earthy florals. I would say this is a more mature rose scent, its a more sophisticated take on rose compared to others such as Bvlgari rose goldea & lancome idole which tends to be on the sweeter side. This is more powdery, and I would say this is more classy than girly. Sadly the longevity isn't the best, probably around 4 hours on my skin.\n\nThis one is so good, I rarely buy second bottles of anything but this one always gets me. The peony version is neck and neck with this. Perfect California weather scent. I don’t know that I’ve ever worn it in true heat Because I don’t live in that type of climate, but I really enjoy it, to me it is fresh, classy, like what I smell and Santa Barbara at the Bacara. It’s interesting that somebody said that it could be masculine, maybe it is the freshness and the cleaness? Definitely not masculine to my nose, just the most classy beautiful woman scent. I just turned 40 but started wearing this about 5 years ago. I don’t think it smells mature, I think of chanel no 5 as mature but still good. Longevity is just OK but good enough for me.\n\nI enjoy the beautiful scent, but I love many rose perfumes, and this reminds me of A La Rose MFK but better. Demachy is in my top five noses with MFK. So love their take on rose one with French and the other with Italian Roses for the houses brand. This is more classic with a warmth.\n\nGreat for Summer nights for a wow factor. Also wonderful layered with Molecule 01.\n\nNot granny or old but there is a regal nature to this scent.\n\nRosa Nobile is a pretty, realistic, fresh yet sweet rose scent, best worn in warm weather. Classic feminine elegance aside, it scores bonus points for me as it evokes childhood memories.\n\nRN is rose-dominant from initial spray, light, fresh and natural-smelling, like rosewater in perfume form. There is some citric freshness up top, complementing the rose. Bright yet well-rounded, the rose here is lovely.\n\nAs it develops, the sweet orange note becomes prominent, forming an irresistible sweet accord with the increasingly jammy rose - it reminds me of a sweet treat/cake from childhood, but frustratingly I cannot put my finger on it. Nothing encourages me to buy perfume as much as such scent memories do!\n\nIt becomes powdery as it develops, with some violet emerging. A nice hint of greenness is evident in the background too. It becomes musky as it dries down, with soft, warm amber-vanilla evident as it fades. Sillage and longevity are moderate.\n\nA beautiful sweet yet lightweight rose scent, this is elegant, feminine and beautifully balanced. Bonus points for the Proustian factor, but a really good spring/summer rose scent. 4.5/5.\n\nA lovely, modern peony-rose. Smells very quality. I am not usually able to wear a strong peony note, owing to the aquatic presentation of most of these. Calone, methinks. Even so, a good floral if you like this category of scent. My personal favorite would be Paul Smith Rose, with it's mild-mannered peony and pink rose and detergent-style musk. It is perhaps even a trifle less 'realistic' rose even than Rosa Nobile, but as a modern peony-rose interpretation it never goes aquatic or sour or nasty in any way and lasts, with powerful projection. Win-win.\n\nI must add, however, that applying Rosa Nobile at bedtime rendered a clean, perfume dry down next AM. So I think longevity is rather good, always a nice thing to have. She has my respect, if not my love. Rose scents with lasting power are, after all, hard to find!\n\nThis is almost a dupe (for me) of Chloe eau de parfum. It's a little bit better quality but it still has that laundry detergent smell (although a nice one) to it that makes it unwearable for me. I was hoping Rosa Nobile was going to be a replacement for my beloved and discontinued Crabtree and Evelyn Rosewater, but it is not to be. This is closer to Chloe eau de parfum than CE Rosewater. This is also quite aquatic as well. Roses in nature do not smell like this. I grew up around all kinds of roses. Heirloom roses, wild roses, tea roses. None of them have an aquatic tone in the way they smell and that synthetic quality ruins this fragrance for me.\n\nThis scent is really amazing. Super natural smelling and as a man, simply lovely to wear. High-class, fresh, refined and perfect for all occasions, dressed up or dressed down. The peony-rose combo in here is photorealistic to say the least and the only thing that prevents this from becoming my everyday go-to scent is the unfortunate non existing sillage and the fact that it barely lasts 30 minutes on my skin. Really impressed and let down at the same time, but still, superb fragrance for men and women alike.\n\nOn first spray this made me think of something from the Dior rose lineup. I can't remember which one, but it also has that mandarin/rose/pepper combination opening going on. Anyway, coming here I see that Demachy created it, so no wonder it reminds me of a Dior fragrance, since he created the fragrances there. His style is clearly exhibited here too - initially. But after it dries down completely I agree with RainbowGirl 100%. It smells like Paul Smith's Rose on me too, and performs about the same. Honestly, I couldn't get past that association, especially considering the massive price difference. You can pick up a bottle of Paul Smith Rose for $25 on Fragnet, or you could pay the $90 being asked for essentially the same fragrance. For me, it's a no brainer.\n\nI own a travel spray of this fragrance, and although it is a beautiful rose perfume, I never purchased a full bottle.\n\nThe opening is fantastic. A beautiful orangy rose, with a hint of pepper, to make it feel classy. A very simular opening to Penhaligon's The Coveted Duchess Rose.\n\nI love orange mixed with rose. It makes the rose smell fresh and light. Like smelling an authentic fresh rose in a garden.\n\nWhen this settles, it reminds me of Paul Smith's Rose (which I may review next, to compare.) The rose is mixed with peony, which makes it stay a fresh rose, even after the citruses have faded. I get a hint of the violet, and a hint of greeness from the lily of the Valley, but very light. Supporting roles. Just enough to make you feel you are in a garden.\n\nAt this stage, nose to skin, it reminds me of something... like a HINT of watermelon rind? Maybe the white fleshy part of the watermelon? But still rose dominated. Zero soapy. Zero potpourri smelling. Super fresh, and a little green.\n\nThe projection is okay, but not great. I can smell it around me, but lightly, and it doesn't last very long. Maybe two hours on my skin. Which is why I never purchased a full bottle. I also own a full bottle of Paul Smith Rose, which is super affordable, and also a beautiful fresh rose.\n\nIf you love a fresh garden rose, and you have your heart set on owning an Acqua Di Parma scent, this will be a great addition to your collection, and a safe blind buy.\n\nSome time ago I decided that I needed to get rid of this perfume. I'm so glad I didn't. Apparently I needed time to love it, to grow it. At the moment I feel a beautiful, fresh rose. I also liked A la rose, which reminds me a lot of this one, but I still feel enough differences to justify its purchase.\n\nSometimes we need time to feel and mature to a specific scent. This is what happened to me and this creation and I am glad that I still gave it a chance.\n\nI enjoy the smell - fresh roses and that is it really. Not a complicated perfume, the perfume name and look are basically what you see is what you get - as someone mentioned below as well :) The problem for me is the sillage and longevity, I consider it very weak. I see people here think it is moderate, I would consider both as weak. I don't think it's worth the higher price tag for that reason.\n\nI blind bought this based on the reviews. What a mistake.\n\nThis perfume gave me a headache and I returned it. To me, it is nothing like a \"soft ballerina\" as other reviewers have mentioned. It is a strong in-your-face older Madam wearing red lipstick (some on her teeth) that speaks to you a little too close to your face and is wearing a purple fur coat. She loves calling everyone \"dear\" and \"darling\".\n\nAll in all, I couldn't distinguish the notes that disturbed me but it sure wasn't what I was looking for: a rose solifore.\n\n(I am currently wearing Roses de Chloe and this is what I wanted.)\n\nThis is such a pretty rose. Its like natural pink roses mixed with the sweetness of rose scented cosmetic products (not ones loaded with essential oils). It’s sweet and dewy smelling on my skin. Often, I find that simple rose fragrances can go sour like stale dried up rose petals. I get that with fragrances like The Perfumers Workshop Tea Rose and Aerin Rose De Grasse.\n\nSo I’ve been trying fruitier and sweeter roses to compensate the sourness. That not what I wanted but was a way for me to handle rose in perfume.\n\nRosa Nobile is softly sweet and slightly powdery. It smells so delicate and feminine. I honestly thought I was going to hate it and prefer Magnolia Nobile. This is my type of rose. It’s simple but I guess like simple.\n\nThis is an ultra feminine lovely fragrance. The rosey opening is gorgeous and I wish it maintained more of that personality in the the Drydown, where it loses much of its character. This perfume is like a soft ballerina fragrance yet really projects, probably at least an arm’s length.I just wish it had a little something in the Drydown, more of a depth or edge, that makes this not smell as generic and synthetic as it does compared to the magnificent opening. I would buy this if I could find an affordable bottle but it’s quite expensive for what it is. I much prefer this over magnolia nobile which is kind of mature and stuffy.\n\nunfortunately I'm not a fan. I love rose perfumes in general but this doesn't work for me. I can tell there is a nice rose in there somewhere but the opening is too sharp and green and there is too much pepper and the dry down is too musky for me. I didn't really get a proper hit of rose at any point, I felt like I was searching for it amongst the other notes. It smells almost masculine to me. I've tried most of the ADP nobile range now and the only one I really enjoy is the Gelsomino.\n\nI have a lot of Rose scented fragrances , some with oud , some with fruit , a few with a green note , and even more that are just rose & other floral notes , patchouli & musk too , none , and I mean none come close to this \"stunner \" . I got from first spritz a fresh cut rose vibe , such a surprise , it went straight into a rose scentual without any alcohol detected . I did get a hint of bergamot and orange . She is lovely , and I'm impressed . Some of my Rose scents are middle of the road price point , a few are high end with rose being the predominant note Lancôme: Peut Etre from 2008 , 500 years from ELO , Bvlgari : Rose Essential ~ This has now become a must have , she will always be in my wardrobe . I thank the reviewers that are in the same mind frame on this one as I am . I was wearing Valentino Donna Rosa Verde and I spritzed one on top , amazing , I don't usually layer, I have a few times , but with what this turned into I might just turn into a \" layering \" addict ~ ///=^} ~\n\nThis is a perfect rose scent in my nose, it smells absolutely wonderful on my skin!!\n\nI got the rose foremost and than the peony. Is there any musk and pepper in the background?? Naaaa...\n\nI also have some other rose perfumes that I love dearly, but, they are at my large storage on the other side of the country, so, I only have this little beauty with me now.\n\nAnd, I love it, and, I think it is perfect for everybody!\n\nI am very allergic to some kind of perfumes, but this one I can dig my nose as deep as I can into my skin, and, I don't got any allergic reaction from it, or either the astma.\n\nIt last for many hours on my skin, so it's def a solid 10/10 !!\n\nI tried this for the first time today. I am a big fan of three of the other \"Nobiles\" - Magnolia, Gelsomino, and Iris, so I expected good things from the rollerball I purchased. My very first reaction after I applied it was \"No!! Another super sharp rose!!\". Absolutely not to my taste! But of course I waited, and within 15 minutes, it all softened into a pretty, pink, somewhat fluffy rose fragrance that I find charming. It doesn't feel old fashioned to me, as I don't find it powdery. The citrus sort of lifts it up and the lily of the valley provides a touch of green freshness that is not the least bit bitter. It fits well within the collection. The only one left to try is Peony.\n\nEDIT - I now own Peonia also.\n\nThe question I must ask myself now is do I want or need a full bottle? I would love to have it to add to the collection but I'm not sure I am willing to spend that much on it. A gift would be nice, and if I find a bargain, I might be tempted, but for now I am happy with my travel size.\n\nSilage and longevity are moderate.\n\n5/15/20 - found a very good deal on line and purchased a full bottle. I have a suspicion that this will be even more lovely as a spray rather than a roller.\n\nPink roses and peonies in a garden shortly after a spring rain.\n\nFresh and pleasant, easy-going and not overwhelming, I would even call it delicate and as it names suggests, purely noble.\n\nBut...\n\nIt would be a great perfume if, at least on me, its duration was not so disappointingly short.\n\nAfter three, maximum four hours, it just disappears from my skin. Also, this really beautiful first impression of a soft rose changes somewhere in the middle of its life and becomes something like a synthetic rose smell, which I truly hate.\n\nIf it had kept its first notes character, and despite its short duration I would call it great and I would rate it differently.\n\nNot for me.\n\nAcqua di Parma Rosa Nobile is not a unique rose scent, but with that being said, it doesn't need to be. Easy to wear and love, this fragrance has everything that you could ever want. I would go so far to challenge those that usually detest rose fragrances to try and turn up their noses at this little beauty.\n\nRosa Nobile is a beautifully balanced blend of pink, delicate roses and tart peony. It starts as a fresh, dew-kissed floral before drying down into a powdery, cedar base.\n\nI think Acqua di Parma does an excellent job with their soliflores. The perfumers don't over complicate things, which is one aspect I appreciate. Rosa Nobile takes this fragrance house to new heights with an extremely wearable and inoffensive offering. It is the epitome of Spring to my nose.\n\nThis fragrance has quite a following, and it's easy to see why. Many describe Rosa Nobile as pretty, beautiful, delicate, modern and luxurious. These are my thoughts exactly. It does deserve the hype and I would love to smell this fragrance on more passers-by. I think it's a much prettier rose when compared to the infamous Chloe Eau de Parfum.\n\nMen seem to love Rosa Nobile on my skin which is another tick in the box for this masterful scent. I did try a number of fragrances from this house at the start of my perfume journey, but for some unbeknownst reason I put Acqua di Parma on the back-burner for a while. I am keen to start exploring this line again, especially now that I have experienced first-hand how wonderful Rosa Nobile turned out.\n\nI was searching for a rose similar to Maison Francis Kurkdijan A La Rose. My reason being the sillage on MFK is so so light and I couldn't justify spending that much on something that disappears within the hour.\n\nSo I bought a tester of Rose Nobile on a whim not expecting it to match up to the gorgeous MFK scent. But it actually does! It is surprisingly close bar a few subtle differences. The citrus in Rose Nobile is definitely more orangey whereas MFK is more lemony. Both a fresh crisp roses which is exactly what I was looking for.\n\nThe main difference is the better sillage and longevity with Rose Nobile. And of course, a cheaper price tag. Although a piece of me is slightly gutted to not be buying the MFK, I am so pleasantly surprised with how beautiful Rose Nobile is. Very pretty for spring and a rose for those who don't like them dark and sugary.\n\nGorgeous pink rose that hits just the right spot between classic and contemporary, powdery and fresh. Pure joy in a bottle! Lovely for layering too -- I especially like it over original Stella to supercharge the rose.\n\nSillage is good on me for the first half hour, then drops dramatically. Longevity is poor to average but so far the best of this style of rose I've yet found. :)\n\nEditing to add that after wearing for a week or so, I'm able to detect the lovely green/naturalistic/garden-y notes throughout this. It's really interesting -- at first it seems like a simple rose soliflore, but slowly you start to perceive the rest of the garden around the roses.\n\nOh how I love the opening of this. It's a gorgeous, complex, fresh rose. The rose smells real, but there are other flowers and scents supporting it in just the most lovely way. I could inhale it for hours.\n\nExcept I can't. It doesn't have a scent progression so much as pieces just start falling away, exposing a base of fake, detergent-smelling rose.\n\nIf someone can recommend something that holds onto the opening of this or has a more pleasant progression, I'd appreciate it. Especially before June 2019 (I'd like to wear it for my wedding).\n\nMuch, much better than MFK, which I had such high hopes for. This is a real rose-focused perfume where the rose is restrained but persistent even into the drydown, which is uncommon for modern rose scents e.g. Chloe's.\n\nThis reminds me of a fine French rose scented soap, like Rance's. Someone else called it \"sunny\", and I'd agree with that too. I couldn't take the fruity sharpness and fuzzy modern musk drydown of MFK's. This one is perfect. And I say that as someone who's been unimpressed with the other Iris Nobile flankers.\n\nRose Nobile is Another floral in a Nobile series. (My favorite from this line is by far Magnolia). It is a stream of pink rose and peony for the first hour or so, which melts into a nice floral bouquette heart and base notes.\n\nDecent sillage and projection, you definitely get noticed by a nice trail of flowers. It might not be the best office scent though.\n\nI am not a big fan of rose, so a pass for me, but highly recommend for rose lovers.\n\nthe happiest citrusy zingy rose. i am a rose fragrance collector with a lot of (probably too many) rose scents.\n\nand yet when i tried this one i knew i needed a full bottle immediately. it evokes sipping a citrusy drink during a stroll in a sunny rose garden.\n\nthis fills the niche of \"sunny rose\" among my others (powdery rose, makeup rose, jammy rose, melancholy rose, synthetic powerhouse rose, among others). happy to have it as part of my collection.\n\ni see a lot of people find this similar to Kurkdjian's A La Rose, which I also have, but I like this one better frankly.\n\nSo, so, so, beautiful…..This is such a delicate composition. “What perfume are you wearing? You smell like a bouquet of flowers,” says one. “You always smell so good,” says another. A woman who is allergic to fragrance actually takes a deep inhale of me, asks me for the name, and says, “I think I can wear this.” With numerous admirers, I’ve shared my Travalo refillable perfume sprayer. On various scraps of paper, I’ve written the words ‘Acqua di Parma, Rosa Nobile’ over and over again, for those who want to purchase it for themselves. I spray this in my hair, and on my clothes, arms and legs. Although sillage and longevity fall in the average range, this is fast becoming my signature.\n\nI had this as a sample, it was Full Bottle worthy by the end of the day and decided I deserved it, I love the strong but faint smell of roses. It dries down rather quickly, but lasts for a good 8 hours. I allowed my 13 year old niece a quick spray before school, she loved it and said her friends and teachers described her as smelling like a \"rose garden\"! Price wise it's not teen girl worthy but I liked that she said I didn't smell like a old lady (47).\n\nit's hard to describe how much I love this one\n\nI am a rose lover and this is one of the most beautiful rose dominated fragrances that I ever tested\n\nhere,rose is very soft,very natural and there is no sharpness here,even in the opening part..there is nothing overdone here,nothing to cover rose's natural beauty,no citrus,no woods,no green notes,no spices,no powdery notes,not even sweetness,there are all hear but the slightest amount of them\n\nthis is all about a delicate,subtle rose with a hint of soft musk..I can't detect other notes and I don't want to,I just want to douse myself in this lovely pretty rose,but for sure there are other notes here,adding freshness,a touch of clean powderyness and giving unnoticable spice,taste and a delicate silky sweetness to the overall combination\n\nI can just say I loooovvve it,love,love..very lovely to wear during springs but it's also wearable in summers and falls..it stays on my skin pretty long with moderat sillage\n\nmy only sadness is about my small,miniature size bottle,I don't want this gorgeous rosey dream to end,never ever\n\nthis is a must try for rose lovers\n\nWhat a beautiful rose perfume! It is absolutely gorgeous. I have been searching for the perfect rose scent for a while. I have tried a lof of perfumes from Red Roses to Lipstock Rose, from Serge Luten's roses to Diptyque Eau Rose, Stella and Paris. In my opinion none of them smelled even close to fresh living roses. There is a beautiful period house across the street from my apartment. Every summer, in the front-yard of this building there grow the most beautiful roses I have ever seen. They are large, warm, fresh, lively, flirting, inviting and colourful. Whenever I walk pass I stop and smell those beautiful roses which to me are the most precious jewels of our neighborhood. Now we are in the middle of the winter. The rose bushes are tucked away under the glittery quilt of snow. I spray my Rosa Nobile once and see and feel the delicate rose petals open up slowly and let their beautiful scent warm the cold air.\n\nI know that it is not possible to create a perfume that smells exactly like fresh roses, but Acqua Di Parma seems to have captured the beautiful spirit of a young living rose and put it in a bottle. I liked this perfume when I sampled it but to be honest I did not think I would fall in love with it. Now I have my own bottle and feel I am madly in love. Like all the lovers in all the beautiful and promising love affairs I genuinely hope ours will last forever and ever and ever.\n\nI love this. All in all I love rose scents and we can see that there is enormous amount of rose fragrances nowadays, but i can tell that only few of them are really beautiful and very special. This is undoubtedly one of them. Very noble, suitable for all ages, long lasting, sexy....even i can tell for all seasons. This is special one..It can be warm and cosy..and in hot weather its like you're calm in the garden with somebody or smith that you really love. I would say that this scent harmonies me. Recommend\n\nAfter a brief citrus opening, the first two hours of Acqua di Parma Rosa Nobile are dominated by a combo of pink rose and pepper. The pepper is quite strong on me, rendering the rose dry and kind of masculine, which is quite unexpected, and I find it very intriguing.\n\nHowever, after the pepper fades, Rosa Nobile then turns into an aqueous concoction of limpid rose, peony and salty musk with an occasional whiff of citrus. Pretty and approachable, but not as compelling as the first two hours to me. The rose becomes slightly more jammy in the late dry down and the aqueous characteristic also wanes a bit, but overall, the fragrance stays linear throughout.\n\nThe sillage is relatively soft and the longevity is around 10 hours. I was positively surprised by the more unisex combo of rose and pepper during the opening. However, while the later stage of modern rose is no doubt very pretty and versatile, I'm not sure it stands out among other similar and more affordable dewy rose fragrances out there to warrant the price.\n\nLovely modern, not 'borrowed from granny' scent at all, but not exactly what I expected. I don't get any of the pepper or spicy notes. On me it's more of a balsamic rosewood with nice citruses in the background.\n\nI like that it's not too heady-floral (these kind of scents gives me hedaches!). Nice, contemporary rose without being soapy. I like the rose not being artificial, it's very soft and natural but again, more of a rosewood than dewy rosebud opening up on a sunny morning.\n\nI would consider it a transition time perfume - wouldn't use it in the height of the summer or on very cold frosty winter days, but it's very lovely in late spring and autumn.\n\nMy only complaint is that it lasts on the skin for 5-6 hours but when applied very quickly goes from citrusy opening to rosewood-y drydown.\n\nNot offensive in any way, nice everyday scent if you work with people (office, reception, front of house, retail etc.). More of a daytime than evening/going out fragrance.\n\n***\n\nAfter trying three diferent EDPs from the Nobile Range - Iris, Magnolia and Rosa I can say that Iris is my fave (own a 50ml bottle and would definitely repurchase when run out), Rosa second favourite (would be happy to get more samples or get a bottle as a present) and Magnolia is the one I like the least and wouldn't care for a sample or a full size bottle. That should tell you all about my taste when it comes to Acqua di Parma inventions :-)\n\nIf you are on the fence with this one- wear it several times in different weather. I really love this in 80 degree weather. I adore rose, and this is the queen of my rose scents. If you are looking for realistic rose with a hint of citrus supported by gorgeous jasmine and musk, look no further.\n\nThis is, in my opinion, top-shelf, high quality eau de parfum. I can tell because of the way the fragrance develops- it has a gorgeous natural rose and citrus smell for the first hour, fades a bit into the other supporting flowers (jasmine, violet, peony) the second hour, and in the remaining hours you are left with the most beautiful rosey skin musk ever.\n\nWhile wearing this, I get a feeling of royalty and nobleness- like it could have been worn in the 1800's by the feminine royalty of that time. I should have chosen this as my wedding scent 3 years ago (instead of Bvlgari Rose Essentielle). The longevity on my skin is easily 8-10 hours.\n\nFirstly I have to point out I'm very ' fickle' on perfume, whats my ' perfume forever' one week, will be cast to the bottom of a drawer the week after....and secondly I never buy ' rose' scented perfumes, I simply do not gravitate towards rose, so I cannot understand why I am so besotted with ' rosa', I disagree with previous reviews which state its to ' simple' on the contrary on first blast I get rose, not so artificial it repels, rather soft, mixed in with a rather expensive ' powder smell' , over 30 years ago my dear grandmother would let me play with her make up bag, it smelt of ' vintage cosmetics' my grandmother has been gone a long time so I guess Acqua di parma Rosa, reminds me of this subconsciously, ' 1950s, make up, all powdery and cream smelling', the rose smell has a mere hint of ' spice', and a waft of ' green freshness', it lasts a long time on my skin, its comforting, warm, like walking through a park in summertime, roses, grass, a gentle hit of sun on your skin, you can smell its quality, I really still can't grasp I'm enthralled with a ' rose' fragrance but there you go!! Some how I think this may just keep my interest up longer than expected, I'm also shallow enough to be totally impressed with the bottle, elegant , almost retro, hint of pink liquid, and to the point gold label, my fav perfume bottle of recent years ( just edging out Tom Fords bottles' ) worth a try especially if you are a ' rose' lover or indeed not as the case may be :)\n\nThis is a lovely gentle fragrance-I found the rose less prominent than the other notes though, to me this was a sweet and almost gourmand fruity citrus. The sillage is minimal and the longevity poor though, I expected this to be deeper and more 'solid', and its not, its a light delicate wisp of a scent. The musk didn't really come out at all. On me this was very light and more of a summer or spring fragrance. I love rose notes, but I think others have done them better than than this (although this is still lovely). I prefer L'Occitane Rose 4 Reines or Van Cleef & Arpels Rose Velours for a more defined rose note.\n\nCan I dare and say I'm a little bit bored with the term \"nobile\" here?\n\nI wanted to try this Rosa Nobile anyway. I saw the beautiful bottle at a counter and couldn't help spritzing.\n\nI like their Magnolia, don't care much for the other ones in the line. All in all a tiring line.\n\nRosa Nobile makes no exception.\n\nIt opens with a very subtle yet present rose smell, quite close to natural and lovely. Peony is also there and the tiniest amount of pepper. The first fruity notes last the time of a blink, which is not wrong in a rose scent.\n\nIt smells lovely for a while, let's say 1 hour, no more, not too intense but present. Then it fades and fades and never seems to come to a more substancial drydown. It's all about rose from start to end and it would be a nice thing if only it was a somptuous rose. Instead it's so faint that it could be taken for you average rosy scent from drugstore, only a little more elegant.\n\nNot a great deal for that price.\n\nRosa Nobile I is a pretty fragrance,very well done, but it is different from what I was expecting. Rosa Nobile opens with prominent bergamot and mandarin, a sunny Italian prelude, followed by a swath of sharp pepper.\n\nAfter the pepper a lovely soft rose enters that is just divine. I wish this phase of the scent lasted forever, but the rose note gets a bit overwhelmed by peony, lily of the valley and violet during the mid-phase of the development. The musk in the drydown makes this very long lasting on my skin and a bit powdery as well. The cedar is there as a balancing note but it is not prominent for me like it is for some others.\n\nThis citrusy floral mix with musk and cedar lasts and lasts on my skin for over 12 hours. It has good sillage for a few hours and then moves to a skin scent. It is a pretty fragrance and worthy of the Acqua di Parma name. At first I thought the rose disappeared in the drydown, but actually it does not, it's just very soft. This fragrance seems to be a crowd-pleaser. I have had 2 people ask me \"what is that wonderful perfume you are wearing today?\" when I have on Rosa Nobile so it must have more sillage than one may think!\n\nPurchased this today. I was very excited to smell it as I'm a huge fan of Magnolia Nobile and rose is actually one of my all time favourite scents so, when I heard Acqua di Parma had made a rose fragrance in the Nobile range I was beyond eager to try it.\n\nI am not disappointed it at all. It's a deeper, muskier rose than perhaps I was expecting but this actually means it has greater scent payoff and longevity, or at least it did on me, still getting wafts of it 5 hours on.\n\nIt does remind me a little of Serge Luten's La Fille de Berlin in that it has a heady, jammy note to the rose, it's quite delicious. This isn't a powdery or green rose, it's a deep, plush, velvety rose with warm tones that remind me of a huge, billowy rose bush on a midsummer's night in Sorrento - you get the jist!\n\nI don't think this will replace Magnolia Nobile as my signature scent, I just feel Magnolia Nobile is more of an all-rounder, possibly more elegant, suitable for any occasion fragrance, whereas I'd save Rosa Nobile for evening or Autumn / Winter wear personally.\n\nI was searching for a rose similar to Maison Francis Kurkdijan A La Rose. My reason being the sillage on MFK is so so light and I couldn't justify spending that much on something that disappears within the hour.\n\nSo I bought a tester of Rose Nobile on a whim not expecting it to match up to the gorgeous MFK scent. But it actually does! It is surprisingly close bar a few subtle differences. The citrus in Rose Nobile is definitely more orangey whereas MFK is more lemony.

It has good sillage for a few hours and then moves to a skin scent. It is a pretty fragrance and worthy of the Acqua di Parma name. At first I thought the rose disappeared in the drydown, but actually it does not, it's just very soft. This fragrance seems to be a crowd-pleaser. I have had 2 people ask me \"what is that wonderful perfume you are wearing today?\" when I have on Rosa Nobile so it must have more sillage than one may think!\n\nPink roses and peonies in a garden shortly after a spring rain.\n\nFresh and pleasant, easy-going and not overwhelming, I would even call it delicate and as it names suggests, purely noble.\n\nBut...\n\nIt would be a great perfume if, at least on me, its duration was not so disappointingly short.\n\nAfter three, maximum four hours, it just disappears from my skin. Also, this really beautiful first impression of a soft rose changes somewhere in the middle of its life and becomes something like a synthetic rose smell, which I truly hate.\n\nIf it had kept its first notes character, and despite its short duration I would call it great and I would rate it differently.\n\nNot for me.\n\nunfortunately I'm not a fan. I love rose perfumes in general but this doesn't work for me. I can tell there is a nice rose in there somewhere but the opening is too sharp and green and there is too much pepper and the dry down is too musky for me. I didn't really get a proper hit of rose at any point, I felt like I was searching for it amongst the other notes. It smells almost masculine to me. I've tried most of the ADP nobile range now and the only one I really enjoy is the Gelsomino.\n\nI blind bought this based on the reviews. What a mistake.\n\nThis perfume gave me a headache and I returned it. To me, it is nothing like a \"soft ballerina\" as other reviewers have mentioned. It is a strong in-your-face older Madam wearing red lipstick (some on her teeth) that speaks to you a little too close to your face and is wearing a purple fur coat. She loves calling everyone \"dear\" and \"darling\".\n\nAll in all, I couldn't distinguish the notes that disturbed me but it sure wasn't what I was looking for: a rose solifore.\n\n(I am currently wearing Roses de Chloe and this is what I wanted.)"
