        "text": "I’m studying a sizeable number of manuscripts I recently retrieved. One of these is so exciting I couldn’t wait to publish about it and I have rushed getting out a blog post and edition. (Hence some other ongoing work will be taking longer.) It’s unlikely anything in the current mandolin literature and extremely interesting, both in a scholarly and musical way. The background story of this piece is also quite fascinating, so this blog post goes on a bit. ;)\n\nThe manuscripts title pages\n\nTwo manuscripts are preserved, one containing the piano part, the other the mandolin part.1 Both have the exact same title (the mandolin part gives a slight extra on the first name of Cramer).\n\nLe rêve d’un bal,\n\nMorceau de Salon\n\npour la\n\nMandoline\n\ncomposé et dédié\n\na\n\nJ(oh). B. Cramer\n\npar son ami\n\nPièrre Moralt\n\nJohann Baptist Cramer (1811-1860) and the revival of “old instruments” in München\n\nJohann Baptist Cramer (1811-1860, sometimes spelled Crammer or Kramer) was a mandolin player active in München (and should not be confused with the keyboard player, composer and publisher based in London which was also active at the same time). He should also not be confused with Ern(e)st Krähmer, the oboe player / composer active in Vienna who composed music a few decades earlier. The manuscripts distinguish between the names quite clearly, also helping by often quoting the first name as well.\n\nThe usual mandolin history reference publications don’t seem to mention Johann Cramer at all.2 This is not entirely surprising, as most regarded the period between 1820-1860 the dark ages of mandolin history. I’ve detailed why this is not exactly true as a sideline in a paper which is pending publication.3\n\nThough Cramer did not get much attention in the usual mandolin reference materials, digging into secondary sources such as newspapers quickly reveals some background. Cramer appears as mandolin player as early as 1840, and continued as late as 1859.4 His main position was as a timpani player (“Pauker”) in the royal court chapel. This orchestra grew in importance around the mid-19th century under Lachner (and even ended up attracting Wagner and Richard Strauss later on in the 19th century).\n\nCramer’s mandolin activities take a turn in 1843, when he is one of the founding fathers of a new ensemble, aiming to revive what they claim to be old, forgotten musical instruments.5 The other members are Wilhelm Moralt (1815-1874), Gustav Pordesch (1817-1870) and Karl Feldhaus (before 1839 – after 1879), each also a regular member of the royal court chapel in München. The ensemble and their claim of reviving old instruments clearly appeals to audiences, as there is a steady stream of concerts throughout the years, all within Bayern and most in München itself. Though there is a pause following the revolution of 1848, activities are restored in 1852 and lasted at least until 1859.\n\nOver the years, the musicians and their instruments changed. The exact list can be consulted in endnote 4. To give a broad idea, in the first years, it’s almost always a quartet consisting of philomel, viola d’amore, mandolin and mandora. In the later years, the ensemble extends to two viola d’amore, corno inglese, viola da gamba, mandolin and mandora. Occasionally, the zither also makes an appearance. The only constant in the musicians and instruments is Johann Cramer and his mandolin. As Cramer’s activities predate the ensemble and he constantly takes part, we can assume he was the major force of the ensemble.\n\nThe claim of reviving old instruments does not extend to recreating old music. The ensemble seems to have played original compositions as well as adaptations of contemporary works. All of this fits with the inquisitive mind of the 19th century, but which did not put historical accuracy as a top priority. This likely also includes the instruments themselves. The philomel is probably a 19th century invention rather than an old revived instrument, and the mandoras of Tiefenbrunner are new creations rather than following old models (see below).\n\nCramer’s mandolin method (München, ca. 1854)\n\nCramer is the author of an unusual mandolin method, Anweisung die Mandoline von selbst zu erlernen nebst einigen Uebungsstücken. Nach Bortolazzis Methode für die sechs-saitige Mandoline eingerichtet (link to D-Mbs 4 Mus.th. 320). This was featured in a paper by Silvia Cicic, Alcuni elementi per una datazione del primo(?) metodo per mandolino milanese. It was first presented during the symposium Il mandolino a Milano e in Lombardia nei secoli XVIII e XIX held at Milan Conservatory (12-15/5/2022). The method is usually dated “circa 1860”, but one secondary source already mentions the method in 1854.6 As the title states, it is essentially based on Bortolazzi’s method (links to D-Mbs 4 Mus.th. 2190), but has been adapted to fit the Milanese/Lombard type. It doesn’t reuse the plates of the original print by Bortolazzi, and I doubt they got approval from Breitkopf & Härtel, who were still selling the original method.\n\nA second source of information on the method is obtained by looking into the publisher. The method was published in München by Georg Tiefenbrunner (1812-1880), a well-known München based luthier. Early on, he studied in Landshut, München and Augsburg. Upon marrying a München shopkeeper’s daughter, Tiefenbrunner obtained a license to sell his instruments. Eventually, he took over the family’s business in 1842, essentially the start of his own luthier’s workshop in München.\n\nTiefenbrunner showcased six (Milanese/Lombard) mandolins and a couple of mandoras in 1854.7 Besides this, Tiefenbrunner is mentioned a number of times around 1855 claiming to bring the mandolin and mandora to a new level.8 Likely Tiefenbrunner’s publication of the mandolin method was linked to his attempts to create a market for his mandolins and mandoras. Hence the dating of 1854 (or shortly before) seems to be confirmed, even if through circumstantial evidence. In a sense, this is an example of history repeating itself, as the mandolin method by Leone was also sold by a Paris luthier, Levinville. (In fact, the drawing of a mandolin in the method shows an example fitting Levinville’s instruments as well.)\n\nMost surviving instruments by Tiefenbrunner are zithers, though a number of guitars and violins have turned up. Even some mandoras were preserved. Currently, I don’t know any surviving mandolins by Tiefenbrunner, but we can hope one might still surface. Tiefenbrunner had some links to the royal court,9 and might well have been involved in the creativity for “old forgotten instruments” to be revived. Most likely the mandora used was build or maintained by him, possibly the mandolin, but it doesn’t seem to far a jump to assume he might even have provided the philomel or viola d’amore.\n\nCramer’s mandolin\n\nWe know very little about the exact design of Cramer’s mandolin or his contemporaries during the mid-19th century in München. As far as I know, no instruments survived from that period and region. The method also doesn’t contain any pictures and neither do I know of any paintings or other documentary evidence we can link to Cramer.\n\nAt least we know for certain the plectrum material Cramer used. In contrast to Bortolazzi, who mentions either a quill or a wooden plectrum, Cramer describes using tortoiseshell. Though there are no further details, this at least gives some insight.\n\nFrom both the manuscripts and his method, we know that Cramer must have played a Milanese inspired instrument of six strings or courses mainly tuned in quarts (g-b-e’-a’-d”-g”). Both the single-string version as well as the double course instrument still existed in München at the time.10 It is very hard to prove either way what Cramer used, though it might be presumed he already moved to an evolved version with single strings as well as a raised and extended fingerboard. Some mandolin historians have started to use the term Lombard mandolin for this evolved type (usually linked to Carlo Albertini and contemporary later 19th century luthiers, see image below).\n\nHistorically speaking, both the terms Milanese and Lombard were used without distinction, so it can sometimes be somewhat confusing, though having more specific terminology can be useful. The method and manuscripts linked to Cramer only use the generic term “Mandoline”, and the one time the method uses a more specific term, Cramer just copied Bortolazzi in using “Mailänder” (Milanese).\n\nThis makes it all harder to state anything with certainty, but most likely Cramer already played on an evolved version of the Milanese type. The general way of evolution – which is also present in Tiefenbrunner’s other instruments – is to use single strings instead of courses, as well as a raised and extended fingerboard. Some mandolin historians have started to use the term Lombard mandolin for this type. Historically speaking, both terms were used without distinction, so it can be somewhat confusing. The method and manuscripts only use the generic term “Mandoline”, and the one time the method uses a more specific term, Cramer follow Bortolazzi in using “Mailänder” (Milanese).\n\nWe are further surrounded by some unkown variables in the area of tuning pegs and strings used. Nothing seems mentioned clearly in the Cramer method. Bortolazzi gives some details but that information is mostly linked to his preferred mandolin type. We know from early 19th century sources that both full metal and full gut strings sets were used on Milanese/Lombard mandolins. Unless further information comes forward, we won’t know what Cramer used. Similarly, we won’t know what types of tuning pegs were used. It could well be the typical wooden tuning pegs similar to the lute and violin, but Tiefenbrunner already used mechanical tuners on quite a number of instruments (for example zither, but also on mandora).\n\nThe catalist for the Milanese/Lombard mandolin popularity in München 1840-1860\n\nA further question about the mandolin in München around 1850 is: why does the mandolin turn up, and why the Milanese/Lombard type? As can be expected, the interest for the (Milanese) mandolin did not appear out of thin air. There is an obvious suspect: Pietro Vimercati. This paragon of the mandolin famously went on quite a lot of concert tours in the decades between 1820 and 1850. And indeed, we can prove he was in München and gave concerts (confirmed in 1820, 1822, 1828, 1834, 1835 and 1841).11 München was an upcoming city after the Napoleonic wars, and it seems to have been favoring Vimercati. In some cases he stayed and played quite a series of public concerts before moving on.\n\nThere are other musicians who played mandolin in München in the decades before Cramer, but none come close to Vimercati. Other mandolin players mentioned in adverts are Fridzeri (1804), a certain “Bongiorny” (1837) and (Antonio) Reggi (1839) (for details, see endnote 11). Fridzeri is well-known from his antecedents in France in the 18th century. The name Reggi is also known, as the Reggi brothers toured elsewhere in Europe. As far as I know Bortolazzi never made it to München, but a music shop in the city lists several works by him and von Call in 1822 (Bortolazzi’s method, variations op. 8, sonate op. 9, von Call’s op. 8 and 108).12\n\nThe conclusion is obvious: the interest in the Milanese/Lombard mandolin in München was most likely instigated by Vimercati. At the moment, we can’t prove Cramer and Vimercati met, but it’s not a big leap of faith to suspect they might have been in touch. It could help explain why certain music linked to Vimercati turned up in mandolin manuscripts linked to München.13 Obviously, it could also have been obtained in any number of ways, but at the moment, this is as plausible as (or even more likely than) any other explanation we have.\n\nPierre (Peter) Moralt\n\nThe composer, Pierre (or Peter) Moralt, was known as violin player of considerable standing. We should not confuse him with Wilhelm Moralt, the philomel player who was another founder of the München ensemble reviving old instruments. In fact, there are quite a lot of musicians in the Moralt family, and a number of them worked or trained in München.\n\nBesides Peter’s activities as a musician at the court, he also went on a number of concert trips. Very little of his music seems to have been preserved. I know of only a small salon piece for piano dedicated to the Princess of Thurn and Taxis, and a concert piece for violin and orchestra (concertino in as) which can be linked to a concert of 1847.\n\nOn at least one concert, on 5/11/1845, Peter Moralt played as well as Cramer (and the old instrument revival ensemble). This at least proves that besides being colleagues of the same generation at the royal court chapel, their paths seem to have crossed on other occasions as well. The title page even suggests a genuine friendship between them.\n\nThe music\n\nThe piano part is 19 pages (including the title page), all in landscape orientation. The mandolin part is 8 pages (including the title page), all in portrait orientation. The mandolin part is written in the same hand as most of the Krähmer manuscripts. The piano part, however, is written in a different hand. I’m inclined to think this might be an autograph, but there is no way to prove this until other material by Moralt becomes available. The mandolin part lacks the dynamics which are provided in the piano part. It contains fingering, but some of this was also added and altered in pencil by a later hand. The mandolin part has a few mistakes which seem to be copyist mistakes, and suggest to me the mandolin part was copied from a score.\n\nThe title of “dream of a ball” of course is a very romantic idea and quite a few mid-19th century salon pieces used such fantastical titles. For example, the already mentioned print by Moralt for pianoforte, was titled L’impression des voyages dans les alpes bernoises. Morceau de salon pour le piano. Other pieces by the old instrument revival group were also called “rêve”. The dream world held a strange fascination during the romantic era, inspiring literature, painting as well as composers. Combining it with a ball makes it only the more interesting as an inspiration for a salon piece.\n\nWith 460 unique bars, the piece is quite sizeable. None of the other early piano-mandolin pieces are of such a scale. Hummel’s Grande Sonata comes the closest, but falls short by quite a margin. The piece also is extraordinary in other respects. As it doesn’t follow standard sonata constraints, the composer switches through several musical atmospheres and themes. This of course fits with both the salon background as well as the idea of a dream with potentially capricious shifts.\n\nThe piece starts with an Andante con moto in C metrum and the key of g minor, an introduction starting with pianoforte solo, which leads to the mandolin part starting after 20 bars. This movement gives way to L[‘]istesso [tempo] in 12/8. All of this these first 46 bars are introductionary, and use a lot of passage work, and lead to the next movement, Thema Allegretto in 3/8 and G major. After the intial theme in the mandolin, the piano plays a contrasting theme. This leads to Var. 1, again with mandolin, and an almost reprise of the piano theme, but which now leads to the next movement.\n\nNext up is a Siciliano. Andantino in C major and 6/8, with a lot of embellishments in the mandolin part. This sicilian interjection is rather short-lived and next up is an Rondo Allegro vivace in 2/4 in G major. Though the Rondo returns some thematic material, it’s certainly not a tradition rondo movement. Its end feels much like the development part of a sonata, and marks a buildup towards the final movement, a Prestissimo in the same key and metrum.\n\nIt seems this piece might have fit well in the ensemble reviving old instruments, were it not that it is written for piano and mandolin. I have found no concert adverts or reviews that mention this piece being played. However, it might just not have been mentioned. The fact that the instrumentation is for piano and mandolin does not mean it can’t have been part of the ensemble’s repertoire. The piano part could theoretically be a reduction of the other parts. In fact, there are “tutti” and “solo” indications that might be interpreted as evidence for such a theory. It seems at least a plausible explanation for these indications.\n\nThe composition itself is also of a total different style than most early mandolin-keyboard repertoire. Very different is the aestethic: It bears influences by the early romantic ideas of abstrac instrumental music. The opening by the piano already set the tone, but the chromatic lines and harmonic progressions here and there also show that mandolin literature has finally got a piece which fits the early romantic period. The composition also shows the craftsmanship of a well-trained musician. It might not be of the level of some of the more famous contemporary composers, but it’s certainly not of third rank quality. Personally, I’m extatic that we have such a beautiful, sizeable and high quality piece from a period and place that wasn’t yet on the map of mandolin history.\n\nThe mandolin part shows a high level of virtuosity, mostly in scales, some trills or grace notes, occasionally using other techniques. The technical degree is high enough to conclude it can only have been meant for a professional mandolin player. The piece is a true testimony to the level of mandolin playing by Cramer, and proves him a true successor to Vimercati.\n\nEdition\n\nAs usual, I’ve included a modern critical edition of the music:\n\nScore\n\nMandolin part\n\nPiano part\n\nAudio from edition software\n\nEndnotes\n\n1 Piano part: Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, München, Mus.N. 122,1014-1.

I will update the reference when published.\n\nSummarizing: though the performances in public concerts decrease, and though there is an even bigger reduction of musical sources, the mandolin did still appear in public concerts held at important venues, and the abundance of secondary sources proves its continued activity.\n\n4\n\nLegend of the newspapers\n\nAM: Ansbacher Morgenblatt\n\nAPZ: Ansbacher Postzeitung\n\nBE: Bayerische Eilbode\n\nBK: Bayerische Kurier\n\nBLB: Bayerische Landbote\n\nBLBt: Bayerische Landbötin\n\nBNZ: Bayerische National-Zeitung\n\nBV: Bayerische Volksfreund\n\nKHNT: Königliche Hof- und National-Theater (separate posters of events)\n\nKNB: Kurier für Niederbayern\n\nMPZ: Münchener politische Zeitung\n\nMT: Münchener Tagblatt\n\nMTP: Münchener Tagpost\n\nMZ: Neue Münchener Zeitung\n\nNN: Neueste Nachtrichten aus dem Gebiete dem Politik\n\nRZ: Regensberger Zeitung\n\nTA: Münchner Tages-Anzeiger\n\nOne scholar already did extensive research (though mainly in the direction of the mandora), but the list above seems to be slightly more extensive, especially with regards to Cramer and his mandolin concerts.\n\nSee Sebastian Kirsch, Die Mandora im neuen Quartett für alte Instrumente, in Phoibos, XIX, 2021, p. 29-49.\n\n5 Kirsch, id. p. 35.\n\n6 Karl Emil Von Schafhäutl, IV.

There is even a small piece of variations by Vimercati in the collection, based on the Don Giovanni mandolin aria, which we know he played in München in 1834. This leads to the conclusion that someone in München must have had access to certain music by Vimercati, potentially originals. (NB: of course I will write additional blog posts including more details, when the study of these manuscripts is finished.)\n\nThe theme of this post is something close to my heart: the mandolin and its use in opera. I’ve been going to operas for years, and besides many live events, have also enjoyed the genre via streaming, video or audio media. I’ve of course also enjoyed it greatly when invited to play the mandolin part in opera productions in Brussels, Ghent or Antwerp.\n\nThis second take-out from my presentation paper for the conservatory in Milan, the focus is the mandolin in the Viennese public venues in the 1780s and 1790s. This of course involves a lot of operas, but also other genres.\n\nThe mandolin has been used in cantatas and operas at least since the late 17th century. The use of the mandolin sometimes is just an exotic flavour (often for biblical or eastern atmospheres). At some point, the mandolin also started to be used for “serenades”, most often in comic operas, where mostly a male lead tries to seduce a female character in the opera. Such vocal pieces in which the mandolin plays a role are not often a major role in mandolin reference works or recordings. At least the ensemble Artemandolino has shed some light on the mandolin and vocal combinations with the excellent collaboration with Nuria Rial.\n\nIn sharp contrast, many mandolin scholars have often turned their attention to Austria and Vienna. Clearly, the Viennese school’s paragons like Beethoven and Mozart’s use of the mandolin triggered a lot of interest. This is sometimes followed by information about the manuscripts and prints of (instrumental) mandolin music in the libraries of Vienna and Prague. A lot of that repertoire was not meant for the public stage but was used in Hausmusik.\n\nHence, I have always wondered why no one noticed the huge amount of mandolin arias in operas played in public venues in Vienna in the 1780s and 1790s. This major omission is something I have tried to rectify more than once. In fact, in the early days of my blog, I already posted a small contribution about the mandolin aria by Paisiello, but there is much more to tell, even about that particular serenade and the opera it belongs to. Of course, the focus here is only on mandolin parts in music played in public venues in Vienna and only during a very limited timeframe (1780s & 1790s). The sheer amount of works and number of performances of some of them tell a tale of an instrument stepping into the limelight during some decades and places highlighted in music history.\n\nLocation, location, location\n\nLet’s, first of all, take some time to review some of the locations where the works described below were played. Most, and especially those listed as “the big guns” were mostly played in the imperial theatres: the k.k. [kaiserlich und königlich] Theater am Kärntnertor, and the k.k. Theater an der Burg. We should also mark these locations as places of interest for slightly more recent mandolin activity, with traces of employment of Bartholomeo Bortolazzi at the Burgtheater around 1800. A few decades later, Pietro Vimercati would play many concerts at both locations, and Ernst Krähmer would be employed as an oboe player at the Burgtheater. There are traces of mandolin activity at many other locations in Vienna. But these two locations are all the more important since these two are closely linked to very famous performances of music by the Viennese school, but also to the Viennese court. This already sets the scene of the importance and popularity of some of these pieces.\n\nThe big guns: Mozart, Paisiello, Martín y Soler and Koželuch\n\nVienna obviously took to the mandolin sometime around 1780 (see my previous article about the imported mandolin prints). It is hence not a huge surprise that the mandolin also turned up in the opera venues in Vienna. Most mandolin scholars are well aware of the mandolin accompaniment in Mozart’s Don Giovanni (Prague, 1787, Vienna, 1788) of the canzonetta «Deh, vieni alla finestra» . The opera is one of the most played operas today, and the comic scene of the Don disguised as his servant Leporello singing a serenade to try and seduce a chambermaid is a classic. However, Mozart’s opera was not the first in Prague or Vienna to include the mandolin. Though popular in Prague from the premiere onwards, the opera initially didn’t do too well in Vienna. However, due to its current status, we have to include it as one of the important mandolin arias. In the next paragraphs, we will look at some of the very popular other works performed in Vienna with mandolin arias.\n\nA first and quite important other work is Giovanni Paisiello’s (1740-1816) opera Il barbiere di Siviglio (St. Petersburg, 1782), and its mandolin aria «Saper bramate». Though it was a triumph all over Europe, its Viennese ascendancy was extraordinary. The opera was performed almost every season in Vienna from 1783 until 1804 (at least 62 times between 1783-1792).1 At this time, most operas were only played for one season, and only a limited amount of times during the season. Though repeats of successful operas were usual, performing an opera almost every season for 20 years is extremely unusual and testimony to how Vienna was besotted by the work. The mandolin aria «Saper bramate» might well have been a factor in popularizing the mandolin in Austria and Vienna. It is sung as a serenade by count Almaviva to his love Rosina while pretending to be a pauper called Lindoro. However, some secondary sources that predate the opera seem to indicate the instrument was already on the rise before the Viennese premiere of Paisiello’s work.\n\nWhile Paisiello’s contribution to mandolin literature is encountered in most reference works, the next opera is less mentioned, if at all. Antonio Salieri originally composed Tarara as a French opera (Paris, 1787) but quite soon created a Viennese (Italian) version as Axur, Re d’Ormus (Vienna, 1788, Italian lyrics by Lorenzo Da Ponte). This particular opera also scored quite high in its day, with 51 performances in Vienna.2 Its mandolin aria «Nato io son nello stato Romano» is less convincing than Paisiello’s contribution but nonetheless an important milestone in mandolin history. The aria is sung by Biscroma, and it is the first in this row which is not a love serenade. At one end it is a moment of reminiscence of Biscroma’s own fate and how he ended up as a slave to Axur. However, he interjects a reminiscence of Atars saving his life. This notice enrages Axur, who declares to want to kill Atar. This was what Biscroma had planned all along, as Axur had plans to seduce Aspasia (the wife of Atar, whom Axur had abducted and taken to his harem.\n\nSalieri was quite an important figure in his time. He was the director of the imperial opera house in Vienna and often conducted premieres of many important pieces of music history. The opera Axur, Re d’Ormus rose to international success. As an interesting aside, von Call’s mandolin and guitar variations op. 25 are based on a theme from Axur.\n\nThere is another opera that is mentioned even less in mandolin histories and which was probably more important than the previously mentioned works by Mozart, Paisiello and Salieri. The composer was Vicente Martín y Soler (1754-1806), who had moved to Vienna in the mid-1780s. His opera buffa Una cosa rara (Vienna, 1786) was performed 55 times from 1786 until 1791.3 The work contains a cavatina with mandolin accompaniment («Non farmi più languire») as well as an aria where the mandolin joins the orchestral accompaniment («Viva viva la Regina»). The cavatina is another example of the serenade-style mandolin aria. This one is sung by the Principe (Don Giovanni, the son of the Spanish Queen), in a shameful act to try and seduce Lilla, who is about to marry Lubino. The latter is enraged and storms off together with Tita, who is also suspicious of the Principe (or others) trying to seduce his own wife-to-be Ghita. A theatrical cloak-and-dagger scene follows, where both the husbands-to-be fight the Principe, while another seducer, the Gran Scudiere (Corrado) tries to kidnap Lilla who manages to escape. One of the following duets of Ghita and Lilla, where they calm down their future husbands, was clearly much enjoyed by Emperor Joseph II as he asked for a repeat. The aria where the mandolin joins the orchestra is a scene celebrating the Queen’s judgement after she berates the Gran Scudiere (who takes all the blame so the Principe gets off scot-free).\n\nThough obscure today, it was a very well-known opera during its time. For example, it was so popular that a repeat of Mozart’s Figaro was abandoned. The opera is also credited with popularizing the waltz. That such a claim is made seems odd, but it seems there might be some truth to it. For example, only one year afterwards, Mozart jumped on the same wagon by including a waltz in Don Giovanni. Mozart’s biggest compliment to this opera by Martín y Soler however is quoting a melody in the finale of Don Giovanni («O quanto un is bel giubilo»).\n\nUna cosa rara is one of several operas where Martín y Soler and Lorenzo Da Ponte collaborated. Though Da Ponte also collaborated with Mozart and Salieri, it seems that the works with Martín y Soler advanced his career the most.\n\nThe popularity of Una cosa rara was so high it even triggered a sequel. This was not in the form of its original, but as a Singspiel, and by another composer: Benedikt Schack’s Der Fall ist noch weit seltner. Obviously, this work also has its own mandolin aria. (See the chapter below where we dive into the German operas and Singspiele.)\n\nAnother very popular work performed in Viennese public venues that used the mandolin is part of a different genre – though also played in the same public venues. As the 1790s saw a revival of the genre of the ballet in Vienna, Leopold Koželuch (1747-1818) provided music for a scenario by the choreographer Antonio Muzzarelli (1744-1821) called La ritrovata figlia di Ottone II (P XXIV:1, 1794). This scenario was based on an idea by Muzzarelli that had already been used previously for ballet productions in Genoa, Florence, and Trieste.4 The production was one of the most successful of its day and received at least 40 performances between 1794 and 1796. One other factor that proves its success is the high amount of preserved manuscript copies (original score but also adaptations), while most ballet music of that time did not survive at all.5 To quote John A. Rice:\n\nFor its historical importance as well as its intrinsic beauties, Kozeluch’s score for La ritrovata figlia deserves to be ranked among the major compositions written for Vienna in the 1790s.6\n\nThough the ballet discussed above clearly was very popular at its time, it’s currently quite obscure, up to the point that most mandolin histories don’t mention it at all. Koželuch returned to the mandolin in another work which is sometimes mentioned in mandolin histories. It’s the so-called “quadruple concerto” (Sinfonia Concertante, P II:1). Though this work seems to catch the eye of some mandolin scholars, it did not enjoy much attention or popularity when it was created in 1798.7 The unlikely soloist combination of trumpet, mandolin, double bass and piano has caused scholars to frown. The mandolin is indeed used as one of four soloists throughout the work. The unusual combination however works quite well and the work is a nice example of instrumental Viennese music from the late 18th century.\n\nAs Koželuch was appointed Kammer Kapellmeister and Hofmusik Compositor in 1792,8 it was assumed this work was created for a specific event at the imperial court or closely linked to it. A description in Gallerie menschenfreundlicher Handlungen und Gesinnungen (1800) confirms this with a description of a performance of the piece during a benefit concert in 1798:\n\nSchöne Wirkungen der Tonkunft und ihrer Gönner!\n\nDen 22. und 23. December 1798 wurde von der Wiener Tonkünstler – Gesellschaft, zum Bessten ihrer Wittwen und Waisen, die gewohtnlich grosse musikalische Akademie abgehalten. […] Nach derselben Endigung wurde eint neues grsses Concert auf vier nachstehende Instrumente von der Erfindung des Herrn Kozeluch, k.k. Kompositor- und Kammer-Kapellmeisters, aufgeführet, wobey Herr Anton Leyber, k.k. Kompositor, das Piano-Forte, Herr Zahradnuzek, k.k. Hoftrompeter, das Mandolin, beyde Mitglieder dieser Gesellschaft, Herr Weydinger, Mitglied des k.k. Hoftheater-Orchesters, die organisirte Trompete blies, und Herr Pischelberger den Kontrebass spielte. […] Die angeborne Milde, die landesmütterliche liebe gegen Wittwen und Waisen, auch die besondere Beschussung der Tonkunft veranlassten Ihre Majestät, die Caiserinn, die gesellschaft mit der Kantate allerhuldreichest zu begnadigen. Se. Maj. beehrten nicht allein mit allerhöchstdero Gegenwart diese Akademie, sondern beschenkten auch die Gesellschaft mit einer Gnadengabe. Auch Se. Königl. Hochheit der Herzog Albert, vermehrte gütigst die Einnahme; auch einige des hohen Adels als vorzügliche Beschützer der Tonkunst, und als Schätzer den Menschheit haben zur Vermehrung der Einnahme beygetragen, so wie der Herr ViceDirector der k.k. Hoftheater, Freyherr v. Braun, welcher die Gesellschaft nicht allein mit dem Benöthigten unterstüzte, sondern auch mit einem Geschenke sich freygebig bezeigte.9\n\nAnother reference work mentions a certain “Szaharadniczek” as a mandolin player in 1792,10 likely the person is meant as the court trumpeter “Zahradnuzek” mentioned above. Professional musicians at that time often were able to play several instruments at a high level, and there are some other mandolin players also proficient in wind instruments. We should however discount the idea that Szaharadniczek played both the mandolin and trumpet in the quadruple concerto. Both the score and the account above rule that out.\n\nThe lesser heroes: Cimarosa, Righini, Da Ponte/Anfossi, Guglielmi\n\nThere are several other works performed in public venues in Vienna in the 1780s and 1790s that include a mandolin part. These other Singspiel, opera and pasticcio works did not reach the same apex of popularity. But they all add up to a regular appearance of the mandolin in the public theatres in Vienna during the 1780s and 1790s.\n\nIt might seem odd to rank Domenico Cimarosa as a “lesser” hero. He was quite successful as an opera composer in his day, and certainly, Il Matrimonio Segreto (Vienna, 1792), an opera created for and in Vienna, celebrated triumphs in the imperial capital. This opera has no links to the mandolin though – at least, not directly. There is one indirect link in the form of an early 19th-century manuscript in the Moravské zemské muzeum in Brno (A 24380). It contains a setting of «È vero che in casa io son la padrona», one of the arias of Fidalma confessing her love for Paolino, here set for the singer, mandolin and bass. However, this one arrangement could well be just an arrangement of a popular aria – there is no evidence that this was ever used as an insert in a performance of the opera. It seems more likely to have come from a private library rather than from a performance in a theatre.\n\nCimarosa did write several other operas with a mandolin aria, and at least two of these were performed in Vienna in the late 18th century. As they never reached the same extraordinary popularity as the operas mentioned above, we have to rank these and Cimarosa to a lesser status. First of all, the aria «Ah mon Frere Io vó marito» in Il pittore Parigino (1781, Rome) has an exquisite mandolin solo. It is sung by Cintia expressing her wish to get married. It hence does not fit the serenading sort of mandolin aria from above but comes close. At this point in the opera, Cintia tries to get her cousin Eurilla to give up her engagement to the Barone (who Cintia wants to marry). Her objective is to make Eurilla marry the painter Monsieur di Crotignac instead, who Eurilla actually loves. In the end, Eurilla decides to marry her lover, the painter – paving the way for a possible marriage of Cintia with the baron (and for Cintia to receive the inheritance from Eurilla’s father which was conditional to marrying the baron).\n\nIn I due Baroni di Rocca Azzurra (Rome, 1783), also by Cimarosa and also played in Vienna, the plot is constituted around the arrival of the future wife (Madama Laura) for the nephew (Totaro) of the baron of Rocca Azzurra (Don Demofonte). Franchetto, the manservant, tries to outwit the barons in attempting to introduce his sister Sandra as the would-be bride. In the finale of the first act, the mandolin has a solo introducing the ensemble of Madama Laura and Sandra «L’astuta volpe» in the finale of the first act, and continues to accompany this small ensemble in the finale. Again, the use of the mandolin is not in the form of a mandolin serenade, though quite an interesting contribution to the repertoire.\n\nI have yet to retrieve a copy of Righini’s L’incontro inaspettato to confirm this opera really has a mandolin part. But from looking at the libretto, it seems self-evident the mandolin played a part. In the first act, Lindoro, who has an unrequited love for Irene, sings a canzonetta accompanied by the mandolin. This is referred to both in the lyrics as well as a theatre direction annotation in the libretto:\n\n(Lindoro)\n\nSpunta l’alba, e spunta il sole\n\nDopo l’ombre, e il Ciel turbato,\n\nMa per questo suentarato\n\nMai non spunta un di seren.\n\n(accompagnandosi la sudetta canzone col Mandolino.)\n\n(Aurora Cardone Rosina Lindoro)\n\nCom’è grato quel cantare\n\nCosi dolce sul mattino,\n\nE quel suon di mandolin\n\nRallegrar fa questo sen.\n\nMa per questo suentarato\n\nMai non spunta un di seren.\n\nAnother famous name that might surprise in the second-raking works and composers, is Lorenzo Da Ponte. Famously working as a librettist with Mozart, Salieri and Martín y Soler, he also embarked to produce a pasticcio. This kind of work assembles popular arias into a new piece. Da Ponte’s incarnation is called L’Ape Musicale (first version: Vienna, 1789). Though he reworked it a number of times, the original version of 1789 for Vienna contains an interesting contribution with mandolin accompaniment.\n\nL’Ape Musicale seems meant as a “meta-opera” with a lot of quotes from and about popular arias. The Austrian Emperor enjoyed such musical jokes immensely. The work premiered before the imperial court, so there is no doubt about the intended audience. Some of the operas mentioned above are featured in this work, like Axur, Re d’Ormus and Una cosa rara. The scenery of the opera is a group commenting on and singing favourite pieces. A desire to sing in French eventually triggers the inclusion of «Amour nous parle sans cesse» by Pasquale Anfossi (1727-1797), to be sung by “Donna Zuccherina”. There is a manuscript which contains this aria (and which suggests it was used at a carnival in Firenze, 1787). This manuscript lacks a mandolin part though. I certainly hope future research will unearth the origins and exact mandolin part. It seems this particular song might be a nice addition to the mandolin songs and arias. I’ll quote from the libretto of L’Ape Musicale:\n\nAmour nous parle sans cesse\n\nDes dames, & des beautes.\n\nIl dit que leurs tendresse\n\nEngendre la gajete;\n\nElles sont les etincelles\n\nDu plaisir des nos coeurs\n\nA quoi bon sans elles\n\nTalent, richesses, honneurs?\n\nMesdames je me decide\n\nA vous cherir toujours\n\nEt pour vous plaire mon guide\n\nSera le Dieu d’amour.\n\nBefore we jump into the world of the German opera and Austrian Singspiel, there is one Italian opera left to discuss. La Quakera spiritosa (alternative spellings common, Napels, 1783) is an opera by Pietro Alessandro Guglielmi (1728-1804). The theme of American Quaker women turns up several times in late 18th-century European plays and operas. Apparently, Quaker women were thought to be very free – usually, the main recurring theme is that they were able to choose who to marry. This idea, combined with gun-wielding Americans, produces quite fantastical scenes which had no relation to reality. But it is also quite apparent how this might be used as a backdrop in a comedy, for example for gender role-switching. In this opera, Vertunna and Tognino indeed often behave as though they were man and woman instead of the other way around.\n\nThe mandolin turns up at a point where the libretto refers to a guitar, sung by Tognino towards Cardellina (his lover at that point, before the arrival of Vertunna, the Quakera spiritosa).\n\nAl suon del Chitarrino\n\nDal bosco all Città\n\nIl povero Tognino\n\nCosì cantando và\n\nCardella d’amore\n\nQuel becco tiranno\n\nMi pizzica il core\n\nGran pene mi dà\n\nIl dolce momento\n\nChe dite ti sento\n\nMio sposo, mio cuore,\n\nDeh quando verrà?\n\nE sempre ci davo\n\nCol nfirinchiti nfrà.\n\nInterestingly enough, before reaching Vienna, the opera was also already played at the Esterházy court (with an aria insert composed by Haydn (HobXXIVb.12)). The Viennese version was redacted by none other than Lorenzo Da Ponte, changing quite a lot, almost turning it into another pasticcio.\n\nThe Mandolin in the German opera and Austrian Singspiel: Schack, Weigl and Süssmayr\n\nThough Italian opera enjoyed huge success, dramatic performances in the German language are also common. First of all, Italian operas were also sometimes performed in German translations. A prime example is Una cosa rara (as “Der seltene Fall”) by Martín y Soler. (This particular piece was so popular in translated version that there was even some competition between different groups performing it, even in different versions.) Salieri’s Axur, re d’Ormus was also performed in a German version (as “Axur, König von Ormus”). Of course, also Mozart’s Don Giovanni (as “Don Juan”) was presented in a German version, but as its original Italian version, didn’t achieve much initial success in Vienna. I have not found references to a German version of Paisiello’s Il barbiere di Seviglia but the original play by Beaumarchais already circulated in several German translations, so it might well have been performed in German as any of the other popular Italian operas.\n\nHowever, besides German translations of Italian operas, some Singspiele were originally written in the language and also employed the mandolin in their music. Alas, as most of these are even more obscure than most of the works mentioned above, it is not straightforward to study these sources. I have yet to request access to each of the scores of the items mentioned here. As gaining access to study these scores takes time (and usually also quite a bit of money), these are still on the to-do list. Nevertheless, I have acquired enough reliable evidence to state that the works mentioned below contain a mandolin part.\n\nA first example can be seen as an extension of the Italian operas: Benedikt Schack’s Der Fall is noch weit seltner is effectively a sequel to Martín y Soler’s Una cosa rara. Interestingly, the libretto was by Emanuel Schikaneder, who would collaborate with Mozart a year later on Die Zauberflöte. I have little doubt this opera will prove to contain yet another example of the serenading mandolin arias.\n\nWeigl’s Das Petermännchen is the next item on the list. He was a chapel master of the imperial theatres and later of the court orchestra. Weigl composed music on a libretto by Schikaneder in another case (and had close relations with Beethoven). Without looking at the score, it’s quite hard to guess at the role of the mandolin in this opera.\n\nFinally, there is also yet another, this time by a student of Mozart, Franz Xaver Süssmayr. His opera Soliman der Zweite is listed as using the mandolin. Again, I’m clueless as to the exact role, but it could both be to give an exotic air, or in a serenading scene.\n\nContemporary publications of Viennese mandolin arias\n\nA remarkable trace of these mandolin arias is kept in the form of adverts by “Lauschischen Musikalien”. This publishing firm was run by Laurenz Lausch (1737/1738-1794) and advertised regularly about available opera scores and adaptations. The list of items linked to mandolin arias also distributed by Lausch is impressive: Paisiello’s Il barbiere di Siviglia;11 Cimarosa’s Il pittore parigino;12 Martín y Soler’s Una cosa rara;13 Mozart’s Don Giovanni;14 Lorenzo Da Ponte’s (1749-1838) L’Ape Musicale (containing Pasquale Anfossi’s (1727-1797) «Amour nous parle sans cesse», in German «Amor schenkt uns die Schönen»)15 and Joseph Weigl’s (1766-1846) Das Petermännchen.16 In a few cases, the opera arias are listed in detail, and in that instance, the mandolin arias usually contain the phrase «con/col mandolino».17 This infers not only that Lausch included the mandolin part, but also that there was a commercial basis for these to be sold. As can be expected, Mozart’s Don Giovanni was printed in Leipzig by Breitkopf & Härtel (1801) and this publication includes the mandolin part. It already was printed years before, as a separate piece, in Speyer’s Anthologie (1788).18\n\nEndnotes\n\n1 John Platoff, Mozart and his Rivals.

Soon an image emerged of an interesting and previously unwritten part of mandolin history.\n\nThrough the adverts, we can learn both about some well-known mandolin players who visited the Netherlands, but also about a number of previously unknown artists. We will also analyze the amount of concerts and other contributing musicians as well as adverts for prints, instruments and strings.\n\nThe article is written as a narrative overview of the activities in chronological order, split into periods with a focus on specific persons of interest. The details of the adverts and concerts and details about referenced literature can be found in the appendices below the main text.\n\nThis article has become quite long. Introductions to Netherland’s music history, or the known mandolin players’ backgrounds, would have made it even more so. I decided early on to not include all of these and just point out good reference works. People interested in the Netherland’s music history, especially for the period 1750-1795, should consult the excellent work by Rudolf Rasch (Rasch, Rudolf (2018); Rasch, Rudolf (online, 2018), which is an older version available online). (Please note: most of this material is only available in Dutch.) For introductions to some of the mandolin players known from other activity, such as in France, I would recommend the work by James Tyler and Paul Sparks (Tyler, James & Sparks, Paul (1989)).\n\nThe first period (1759-1765): Merchi & Rossi\n\nIt’s hard to find Dutch mandolin sources predating 1750. A likely candidate is Willem de Fesch (°1687-+1761), who printed a volume of songs (XX Canzonette, ca. 1735), with mandolin mentioned as one of the alternatives for the soprano voice (violin, flute or mandolin). However, we need to question whether this really related to the Netherlands, as de Fesch printed the volume in London. Also, the mandolin is likely only mentioned for commercial purposes, rather than proving a direct link between this music and the mandolin.\n\nHence I consider the first proper mandolin activity in the Netherlands an advert from 1759. In a first period, from 1759 until 1765, we can trace at least 13 concerts through adverts. Additionally, there is at least one French mandolin print also distributed in the Netherlands and a Dutch print by one of the mandolin protagonists.\n\nThe main actor in this first period is none other than the well-known pioneer of plucked string instruments: Giacomo Merchi (Brescia, °18/08/1726-?). Known to have travelled Europe performing on concerts with his brother Giuseppe Bernardo Merchi (Brescia, °28/11/1723-+22/03/1793) in the 1750s, he later settled in Paris where he published dozens of music prints (mainly for guitar, including an important tutor). There are a number of London prints as well, and besides the mandolin, guitar and colascioncino (a smaller for of colascione), he is also noted to have performed on “liutino moderno”, an instrument of his own invention. (See Public Advertiser 27/04/1769, Bath Chronicle 1/12/1774 & 9/1/1777.)\n\nGiacomo Merchi visited the Netherlands annually early on in his career, from 1759 until 1765. His first concert seems to have been on 29/03/1759 in the Manège venue in Amsterdam, one of the most important Dutch concert halls at that time. Most adverts only mention the last name of Merchi, but the advert for this first concert mentions an initial “G”. The prints of Merchi linked to the Netherlands we will discuss later also mention the first name Giacomo on their title pages. It seems plausible enough to conclude that all sources related to Merchi in the Netherlands refer to Giacomo only.\n\nSo far I have traced at least 11 Dutch concerts by Merchi, mostly in well-known venues in Amsterdam (Doelen (2), Manège (2), Keizerskroon (1)) and The Hague (Theatre Français (3), Doelen (1)), but there are two late adverts from Utrecht as well (Aalmoezenierskamer Brigittenstraat (1) & Concertzaal Vreeburg (1)). Most concerts mention all three of Merchi’s instruments (colascioncino, guitar and mandolin), but the guitar is neglected in two and colascioncino and mandolin in one advert each. I have still entered the concert on 13/11/1764 which seems not to have featured the mandolin in my source overviews. It might well have been an oversight of the advert as Merchi seems to use the mandolin very consistently. After all, the mandolin’s popularity was still rising, both in the Netherlands as elsewhere in Europe (as can be easily seen from the rise in mandolin prints in France at this time). Apparently Merchi returned for at least one concert in 1765 (Arnhem, Stadsmuziekcollege), but as I have not seen the actual source or details about concert I have not (yet) put that one in my source overviews. (See Rasch, Rudolf (2013), Concertleven, p. 43.)\n\nThough Merchi is listed as organizer in most of his concerts (bar one organized by Magalli on 08/02/1763), he did enlist some partners for ticket sales. Johann Julius Hummel’s music shop is mentioned on all Amsterdam concerts as ticket booth. Henri Chalon, a known organizer of concerts, is also listed as a contact for tickets in the advert of the first concert by Merchi (29/03/1759, in the Manège).\n\nOther musicians participating in these concerts are almost always vocal artists: Mad. Lepri (Dionisia Lepri), Mad. Mellini (Eugenia Mellini). Mademoiselle Baptiste (Rose-Albertine-Françoise Anselme), Madame Baptiste (Françoise Gravillon), Mr. Magalli (organization, singing), mevr. Linders (singing). Only Michel Esser (Carl Michael Esser, singing, violin, viola) is listed to play violin and viola, but he also sang during the concert. All of these are well-known artists and concert organizers in the Netherlands, only madame Linders is unfamiliar.\n\nIt can be assumed there were some other musicians. The adverts mention “concert” and “solo” performances, which suggests some pieces were accompanied. Also, Henri Chalon, mentioned for ticket sales of the first concert by Merchi in 1759, is known to have directed an orchestra. One concert in the Theatre Français in the Hague mentions “Mademoiselle Baptiste will sing several Italian arias; accompanied by several instruments and the entire orchestra”. Though this does not prove Merchi himself also played with the orchestra, it at least proves that there were other musicians present as well. I think it very likely that Merchi usually was joined by some local musicians for accompaniment.\n\nGiacomo Merchi is of course also well-known for publishing music. The question hence is: did Merchi print for mandolin and did he publish anything in the Netherlands? Regarding the mandolin prints, I already pointed out the three prints by Merchi in an article (see Van Tichelen, Pieter (2020)):\n\nSei Duetti op. 2, ca. 1758, F-Pn shelf mark VM7 882, available online through Gallica\n\nSei Trio op. 9 (originally opus 5), ca. 1761-4, GB-Lbl shelf mark Music Collections g.105\n\nSix Duos op. 15 (not preserved).\n\nOpus 2 and 9 were initially targeted at the violin (and pardessus-de-viole, a soprano type of viola da gamba). Though certainly playable on violin, these prints were likely originally composed for mandolin. When the mandolin became enormously popular in Paris in the later 1760s, opus 2 and 9 were remarketed as mandolin music, making the circle whole. This remarketing can both be seen in catalogues as well as on the title pages of the volumes (see illustrations below).\n\nBesides the (later re-)introduction of the mandolin in the title pages and catalogues, there is an interesting link to the Netherlands on the title page of opus 9. Though published in Paris, the title page states that this print was also available through Burchard Hummel in The Hague. It is quite striking to spot such a mandolin trio sonata print turn up in the Netherlands, right at the same time its composer was playing concerts over there. Merchi clearly didn’t only visit the Netherlands for playing concerts but seems to have aimed at selling music prints as well.\n\nThere is another print by Merchi linked to the Netherlands, the XII Ariette e IV Duetti, op. 17 (originally op. 10), Amsterdam/The Hague, ca. 1760. (I like to thank Damian Martin Gil for informing me about this print.) The volume is vocal in origin but also aims to be versatile enough to be playable on violin, flute, harpsichord or guitar with bass. The songs have a melody line in soprano clef (with lyrics), then a (figured) bass, and underneath a guitar part in (ottava basso) soprano clef. The duets have two melody lines in soprano clef (with lyrics) and a (figured) bass.\n\nThis volume showcases some of the vocal music which could have featured in Merchi’s Dutch concerts. It also shows that Merchi tried to include the Netherlands in his publishing activities. Alas, the mandolin is not mentioned on the title page. However, the print still predates the time when Merchi actively started to (re)market prints towards the mandolin, so it’s not a clear cut case. The volume is preserved at the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek München (D-Mbs, Mus.pr. 2018.2402, available online). The music seems to be by Merchi himself, but he clearly reused some lyrics from popular opera arias and songs.\n\nLa destra ti chiedo\n\nPenso agli affanni miei\n\nSe tu provasti al cor\n\nA’ innamorarse presto se fa\n\nDa questo ciel tu parti\n\nSte pur su le vostre mia siora\n\nAh che nel dirti addio\n\nCh’io mai vi possa lasciar d’amare\n\nLusinghiero m’ingannasti\n\nEcco quel fiero istante\n\nQuell’occhio furbetto\n\nBella Chechina mia\n\nDue vezzosette nere pupille\n\nMia Fillide ben mio\n\nSe viver non poss’io\n\nEcco giunto il giorno amaro\n\nThe reason Merchi abandoned his annual trips to the Netherlands is not clear. Maybe the prints like opus 9 and opus 17 didn’t sell well enough, or the commercial prospects were better in France and England. Perhaps the concert venues were looking for fresh talent? In any case, we have no evidence for Merchi coming to the Netherlands after 1765. However, as can be spotted from the huge amount of concerts in the rest of the 1760s and 1770s, the instrument was certainly still popular.\n\nIn 1765, a certain Madame Rossi held two concerts (in the Concertzaal in Rotterdam as well as the Manège in Amsterdam). In one advert, she is claimed to be from Venice. Not much more information is available about madame Rossi, except that she played with a Madame Severini (singing) and one advert also claims a madame Tessarini directed. Women performing during a public concert (with the exception of singing) are quite rare, so, alas, a woman directing musicians seems improbable. I think this might be a mistake, and likely meant Carlo Tessarini, known as a violin player from other Dutch concerts. The concert by Rossi in Amsterdam again lists Hummel for buying tickets.\n\nFrom the dates of the concerts it is clear that Merchi and Rossi only stayed in the Netherlands for a limited time. As Merchi was likely based in Paris a short trip to the Netherlands was possible, though travel time should not be underestimated. Useful information about the duration of such a journey can be learnt from the Mozart family grand concert trip passing through France, the Austrian Netherlands and United Provinces. For example, one trip without too much stops from Brussels to Paris is known to have taken the Mozarts from 15/11/1763 until their arrival on 18/11/1763. The duration to travel from Brussels to Amsterdam can be estimated based on Duten’s “Guide” (L. Dutens, Itinéraire des Routes Les Plus Fréquentées de l’Europe, Paris, 1783). Dutens assesses 40 hours not counting stops. Likely with stops this too amounted to 3-4 days. The total trip from Paris to Amsterdam or vice versa would hence likely have taken about a week, depending on the amount of stops for mealtimes, resting, sleep etc. the travelling musician would take. Often, musicians would stop along the way for a concert as well, so it might be interesting to look for concert adverts in the Austrian Netherlands (current Belgium) by Merchi as well as some of the other mandolin players travelling between France and the Netherlands.\n\nTravelling could sometimes take longer than expected. For example, the coach could break down (cfr. the Mozart family’s concert trip got delayed for a day due to a broken carriage wheel on 9/07/1763). Sometimes, musicians would have to wait for a substantial amount of time before they were allowed to hold concerts – most often when this involved holding a private concert at the court of a nobleman (for example, the Mozart family was kept in limbo in Brussels for several weeks before they could hold a concert before Prince Charles of Lorraine). Besides such external factors, musicians also could fall ill, forcing them to delay concerts (eg. the many illnesses of the Mozart children during the concert trip).\n\nAt the time of writing this article, I have found only very sparse evidence of any mandolin player performing at the court of the Prince of Orange. There is an advert from 25/11/1766 by Rossignol and his troupe (see below). But as many other mandolin players passed through The Hague and gave concerts, there might well have been other private concerts for the Prince of Orange and his court. Maybe further research will show if Merchi or any of the other mandolin players managed to arrange such a concert.\n\nThe amount of concerts in the 1750s and early 1760s listed in adverts is limited, so the frequent and high amount of mandolin concerts is interesting. Hence these early mandolin concerts by Merchi and Rossi are certainly not a footnote but should be considered important events in the music history of the Netherlands of that particular period. The musicians participating in Merchi’s concerts also bear witness to their importance. The fact that Merchi also ended up in the good graces of the Hummel brothers for selling and even publishing his music is also testimony to his success. Most likely this was once more partially caused by the interest in the new style galant which is so closely linked with the mandolin’s popularity in the late 18th century. (See Van Tichelen, Pieter (2020))\n\nSecond period (1766-1770): Rossignol’s troupe; Mazzuchelli & Leone\n\nAfter Merchi and Rossi, we need to turn our attention to a phenomenon by the name of Joseph Rossignol(o) (de Malt(h)a). As he claims to have held a concert in Versailles in an advert (Oprechte Haarlemsche Courant, 02/11/1765, n. 44, p. 2) he likely came to the Netherlands from France. As I have no indications whether Rossignol’s early concerts in 1765 included mandolin players, I have not included these in this study.\n\nAt some point during the later part of 1766 (at latest starting with adverts on 02/08/1766), Rossignol’s adverts mention a troupe of four musicians. Mostly it is claimed they are from Italy, sometimes Venice is specified. One advert claims the troupe consisted of five Venetian musicians. This fifth Venetian musician is likely Mademoiselle Nicolini who sang several Venetian airs during this concert (12/11/1766 in the Doelen, The Hague). She is not encountered again, and subsequent adverts only mention four musicians. The joint venture of Rossignol and his four musicians seems to have lasted quite long, as we are sure they worked together from 1766-1770 and there is even a late advert from 1786 in the Netherlands.\n\nThe names and instruments are often not specified, but from the details listed over the many adverts, a clear image emerges. Rossignol and his troupe played no less than 21 identified concerts involving the mandolin. That seems to be the largest amount of mandolin concerts in the Netherlands by any artist or ensemble from 1750 until 1850. Rossignol covered quite a lot of the available venues: Amsterdam (Keizerskroon (5), Nieuw Malta (3), Manège (1)), Groningen (Wapen van Stad & Lande (4)), Rotterdam (Doelen 3), Haarlem (Prinsenhof (1)), The Hague (Doelen, (1)), Zwolle (Hof van Holland (1)), Utrecht (Muziekcollege (1)).\n\nThe instruments of the four Italians (when mentioned) are always the same: “mandoline”/”mandelin”, “mandole”/”mandola”/”mandolo” and “tambour de bas organisé”/”tambour de basque met orgel”. The “mandoline” most likely was the Neapolitan mandolin. The “mandole” can’t be identified with certainty. It could have referred to either a form of six-course mandolin, or a deeper tuned instrument (as the mandole is often mentioned as accompaniment in the adverts). The tambour de bas(que) usually refers to the percussion instrument tambourine.\n\nThe first musician of interest to us in Rossignol’s troupe is the “mandelin”/”mandoline”/”mandolino” player, who is singled out most by mentioning a name in the adverts. The names found for this musician are “Gaëtani”, but also “Nicola”, “Nicolas”, “Nicolai” and “Nicolaas”. It is only through the later adverts we have some confirmation this might be one and the same person: “Nicolas Cajetani”. This Gaetani/Cajetani could be the same person active in Paris (for example, see Récréations de la Campagne, vol. 3, Paris, 1764 and a bundle of minuets from 1768). Another alternative spelling can be found in an advert in Hamburg (Reichspostreuter, 11/02/1769, n. 24, p. 4), where Rossignol advertises and a “Gädani” will play mandolin. Some Danish adverts also mention a “Gedani” as mandolin player with Rossignol.\n\nThe second person of interest is easier to identify as there are less spelling alternatives. Similar to Nicolas Cajetani/Gaetani, he’s both referred to by first and last name, though. The name is Severino (/Severina) Peres (/Perez, /Peris). He is mentioned as the musician on the “mandole” (also called “mandola” or “mandolo”). Severino Peres is also mentioned as singer (during concerts on 28/07/1770 (aria “do Etti Venesiani”), 31/07/1770, 01/08/1770, 02/08/1770), but always also as player of the mandole.\n\nJoseph Rossignol himself is not listed as playing mandolin, but should be considered an important figure as he had two permanent mandolin players in his troupe and gave an enormous amount concerts in several countries. His own talent was a strange art of singing, at the one end imitating bird song, at the other vocalizations. At least one advert present him playing the “violin without strings” (concert on 26/11/1766). Though we can’t be sure, this sounds like Rossignol might have held a violin, literally without strings, whilst imitated violin playing with his voice.\n\nThe information about Rossignol’s contribution to the concerts seems to imply that entertainment was likely more important to him than musical value, which isn’t entirely unusual at this time. Some of the adverts are also carefully phrased to highlight “instruments never before heard” when the troupe first played at a venue. However, we should not consider these circus acts, though, as they were held in proper concert venues. Interestingly, Rossignol is listed in Leopold Mozart’s notebook from the concert trip when the Mozarts visited the Netherlands in 1766 (Leopold Mozart calls him “der Stockfisch”, likely meant as a pejorative nickname).\n\nOther musicians which might be part of the troupe are rarely mentioned: a Sr. Bragioni is mentioned to sing an aria by Masanti, followed by a duet by Menegheti (Giovanni Menegheti, °ca. 1730-+1794) and a trio, (concert on 20/09/1766). A certain Monsr. Tessalino is also mentioned to accompany Gaëtani during his solo on the mandolino (concert on 19/11/1766). We could assume that these represent the remaining two musicians of the four people in Rossignol’s troupe, but they are so infrequently mentioned it remains uncertain.\n\nThere are only two additional musicians who joined the troupe: Sr. J(o)ubert (violin, 04/08/1766 and 31/07/1786) and the already mentioned Mademoiselle Nicolini (singing, on 12/11/1766). We can’t rule out that Rossignol hired local musicians, but with his own set of musicians, he might have made due.\n\nThere is only one concert where Hummel is listed as ticket sales point (Manège, 06/08/1766). All other concerts in Amsterdam do not mention Hummel as point of sale for tickets, which is odd, as almost all other Amsterdam mandolin concerts use Hummel as a ticket booth (until the shop closed). Puzzling is that this one concert which mentions Hummel is also the only concert which seems to have been without Rossignol, only mentioning the troupe of 4 Italian musicians. Could this mean that Rossignol was actively barred from performing in the Manège and by Hummel? There is too little evidence to go on, so it remains speculation, but it’s certainly interesting.\n\nRossignol and his troupe are so far the only mandolin players who we can claim to have performed at the court of the Prince of Orange. An advert from 25/11/1766 states that they “had the honour to let themselves hear before Majesties, Princes and Nobility of England, as well as his Majesty the Prince of Orange”. As Rossignol and his troupe had passed through The Hague earlier on in November 1766 (concert in the Doelen on 12/11/1766), this claim might be true.\n\nAfter his first successful tour in the Netherlands in (1765-)1766-1767, Rossignol and the troupe seem to first have went south (some indications place him and his group in Liège in April 1767). Later they moved to Germany (cfr. advert in Hamburg in 1769) and Denmark (concerts in 1769-70) before returning to the Netherlands for a second tour (1770). I’ve identified a quite late concert in Utrecht in 1786 by Rossignol, again mentioning four Italian musicians (and mandolin and mandole as instruments).\n\nThe concerts by Rossignol and his troupe stand out by their low ticket price. The usual price found in mandolin concert adverts is around 2 gulden. Many of Rossignol’s concerts list prices lower than 2 gulden, even in important cities like Amsterdam. Sometimes the price is further differentiated into a second or third category, the last only costing a ‘sestehalf’ (5.5 stuivers, slightly over a quart gulden). This could be in line with the already postulated idea that Rossignol focused on entertainment value and wanted to attract a wide audience.\n\nThe only two mandolin concerts in the years 1766-70 not by Rossignol are by two important pioneers of the mandolin known from their activities elsewhere: Mazzuchelli and Leone. Gabriele Leone hardly requires any introductions as the paragon of the mandolin in the 18th century, mostly known from his activities in France and Great Britain. Mazzuchelli might be less known, but is also one of the mandolin players active in Paris (mandolin volumes printed from 1769 until 1783). The current information suggests both Mazzuchelli and Leone visited the Netherlands for one concert only.\n\nMazzuchelli’s concert is jointly organized by himself, Sr. De Hey and Sr. Bach. Besides Mazzuchelli on mandolin (even specified “Napolitaansche Mandolin”), De Hey (singing and violin), and Bach (harpsichord), a Sr. Boffeli also joined (singing). It is interesting to see that Mazzuchelli played a concert with De Hey, a famous local violin player and concert organizer. As several Bach family members played in concerts in the Netherlands, it can be tricky to identify the right person mentioned in the adverts of Mazzuchelli’s concert. Fortunately, this has been investigated before by musicologists, and the currently still upheld conclusion is that it was likely Johann Michael Bach. This is someone from a Bach family unrelated to Johann Sebastian Bach. (See van Hasselt, Luc (1979) and Rasch, Rudolf (2000), p. 42-3.) Johann Michael Bach published some harpsichord music through Johann Julius Hummel in Amsterdam in December 1767 and Siegfried Markordt in Augustus 1769.\n\nGabriele Leone is joined by Madame Paradis (singing) and Monsr. & Madame Sirmen (Ludovico Sirmen & Maddalena Laura Lombardini (°1745-+1818)), playing a concerto for two violins. Lombardini is known to have been a student of Tartini, and one of the few women achieving some status as a concert performer, let alone composer, in the 18th century. The Sirmen couple were quite famous performers, so this is again a concert with first rank professional musicians. The Sirmens already played a number of times before in the weeks before the concert with Leone.\n\nThird period (1772-1774): Zaniboni & Fridzeri\n\nDuring the next period (1772-1774) the person in the spotlight is none other than Giuseppe Zaniboni. This is an interesting development, as we previously had not that much more information besides Zaniboni’s activities in Russia. Zaniboni played some sort of six-course mandolin type (see adverts on 03/11/1772, 01/01/1773 and 03/07/1773: “(a)mandolino a douze cordes”), and gave at least 9 identified concerts in the Netherlands. Because of this density and the spread of the concerts, Zaniboni likely used the Netherlands as his (semi-)permanent base during these years.\n\nImportant to note is that the concerts by Zaniboni in Amsterdam are again listing Hummel’s music shop as ticket booth. There is one extraordinary counterexample, when for a concert organized by Benozzi on 14/12/1773, the ticket booth is handled by Siegfried Markordt (a direct competitor of Hummel). All consequent concerts in Amsterdam by Fridzeri and Zaniboni again have ticket sales through Hummel. Compared to the period of activity by Rossignol, the ticket prices also stabilize again to their normal level of ca. 2 gulden. Most concerts by Zaniboni were played in the venue Armes d’Amsterdam (6). He also played at some other venues, but always in Amsterdam (Damplein (1), Rondeel (1), Manège (1)).\n\nZaniboni is more often participating in concerts than organizing them himself (only 3 out of 9 concerts have Zaniboni listed as organizer). The other concerts are organized by some famed musicians of that time. The other musicians, either organizing and/or participating in the concerts are: Benossi (organization, cello, (2)), J. J. Casaer (singing, (1)), Cecilia de Salvagni (organization, singer, (2 of which 1 cancelled), Sr. Golvin (organization, (1)), Sr. Heneberg (clarinet, (1)), Georg Anton Kreusser (organization, composition, (1)), Madame Neytz (singing, (2)), Ignazio Raimondi (violin, (1)), Ramm (organization, oboe, (1)), Georg Frederik Richter (organization, harpsichord, (1)), Ernst Schick (violin, (1)) and Carel Vermeulen (organization, violin, (1)). One minor interesting thing is that the advert from 01/01/1773 mentions that tickets can also be found in “la Ville de Lyon”. This concert was cancelled through an advert the next day, without giving a reason.\n\nThe other mandolin player active during the early 1770s, is Alessandro Maria Antonio Fridzeri (°16/01/1741-+1825). Fridzeri is another example of a mandolin player mainly known by his activities in France (known from concerts and to have published a volume of mandolin sonatas in ca. 1771). He also enjoyed some notoriety because of his blindness, and the music notation system he developed due to his condition. Fridzeri gave at least 3 concerts in the Netherlands. He is one of the few mandolin players consistently playing both mandolin and violin during concerts. The concert adverts mention the mandolin for two of the three concerts. As the third one (for the concert on 14/02/1774) doesn’t specify the instruments used, it should be assumed the mandolin and violin were again used. Fridzeri’s adverts don’t mention other participating musicians and only himself as organizer (spelled “Frizeri” or “Friseri”).\n\nThe adverts seem to suggest that both Zaniboni and Fridzeri were also still accompanied by other musicians. One of Zaniboni adverts has the phrase “concertos & solos […] entr’autres un solo avec la basse” (concert on 06/11/1772), and one of Fridzeri’s adverts “en Simphonie et seul” (concert on 13/01/1774).\n\nAnother thing of note during this time is the appearance of a Dutch mandolin print from 1773. Burchard Hummel published a concerto by Johann Andreas Kauchlitz Colizzi (°ca. 1742 – +15/08/1808) in The Hague. Though this work was known by mandolin scholars for a while (S-Smf; RISM A/I CC 3365a), we lacked an advert to date this work until now (‘s Gravenhaagsche Courant, 08/03/1773). The mandolin is mentioned only as an alternative to the “violino concertante”. However, this is often encountered – during the first phase of mandolin printing the mandolin is often either not mentioned or as an alternative. (See Van Tichelen, Pieter (2020).)\n\nFourth period (1775-1778): Gervasio & Cifolelli\n\nThe next period is focused around one of the more well-known mandolin players of the 18th century: Giovanni Battista Gervasio. It feels to me he is often overlooked because he is overshadowed by the other main actors. But through his activities in several countries, playing in concerts and publishing mandolin prints (including the first known mandolin method in 1767), Gervasio proved to be a leading figure of the mandolin.\n\nGervasio is known to have been active in London until the early 1770s, where he was already performing together with his wife (a singer). Around 1775, Gervasio travelled towards the Netherlands, where he played in at least 9 concerts until 1777. The first performance which can be traced through adverts is from 28/11/1775, when he played in the Stadmuziekzaal in Utrecht. Due to the high amount of concerts in a relatively short period, it seems Gervasio and his wife were primarily based in the Netherlands for several years, though some gaps might be explained by concert trips elsewhere.\n\nGervasio performs at several different locations, though Amsterdam is frequented much more: Amsterdam (Armes d’Amsterdam (5)), Rotterdam (Concertzaal (2)), Haarlem (Concertzaal (1)) and Utrecht (Stadsmuziekzaal (1)). Gervasio’s instrument is usually called “mandoline” in the adverts, but spelling variants turn up sometimes “mandeline”, “mandolino”, “mandolina” or “mandolini”. Gervasio is more often organizer of his concerts (5 out of 9 concerts) than Zaniboni was, but he also joins in concerts of others (Fleuri & Fani, Fani, Zentgraaf, Casaer).\n\nObviously, the ranks of participating musicians is fronted by Gervasio’s wife, who is mentioned in the adverts of almost all of his concerts. Her repertory is never further specified than ‘Italian arias’. The style of her repertory can perhaps be approached through the London prints by Gervasio (Gervasio, Airs, ca. 1768; Straube, Three sonatas […] likewise a choice collection of […] songs, 1768 (two “cantoncina” by Gervasio)), or the barcaroles in manuscript (S-Skma 153:28). (NB: as I have acquired publishing rights, I might yet publish these here, but there wasn’t enough time to include them in this article.) None of this preserved vocal music by Gervasio is linked directly to the Netherlands, but as Gervasio likely came from England to the Netherlands, he might well have played from his book of Airs, or even sold some copies in the Netherlands.\n\nQuite often the Gervasio couple is joined by other musicians specified in the adverts: Agazzi (cello (1)), J. J. Casaer (organization (1)), Cirri (cello (1)), Mr. Fani (organization, violin, double bass, hunting horn (2)), Mad. Fleuri (organization, singing (1)), Mr. Hallemans (singing (1)), Mr. J. Ruloffs (violin (1)), Mad. Schroter (singing (1)), Mr. Schroter (“le jeune”, violin (1)), Mr. Spandow (composition, hunting horn (2)), Ximenez (direction, viola, violin (1)) and J. C. Zentgraaf (organization (1)). These are once more musicians known through several other concerts in the Netherlands of quite a high standing.\n\nAs with many other mandolin players mentioned so far, the Gervasios seem to have been joined by more than the people mentioned in the adverts. The concert on 16/04/1776 mentions that Gervasio will play on the mandolin, but also that a symphony by Haydn will be executed (based on the description this looks like Symphony n. 8, The Evening, with the famous last movement “The Tempest“). Even in concerts organized by themselves, it seems they were joined by several musicians. For example, on 10/12/1776, they advertise the performance of choirs (of Sacchini and Gluck). Though there are other musicians announced, these seem hardly sufficient to perform a “grand choeur a plusieurs voix”. Another example is the concert held at the Concertzaal in Rotterdam (on 11/03/1777), where only the Gervasio couple is mentioned, but the announcement mentions singing of a cantata, including choruses.\n\nA rather important discovery is that one of the known Gervasio prints was in fact printed in the Netherlands. The volume Sei Duetti op. 5 by Gervasio (I-TSmt, RUS-Mrg) was known for years. I had questioned the date and location of provenance so far suggested several times (for example see Van Tichelen, Pieter (2020), p. 184), but it was a hint from Ugo Orlandi which sent me on the right trail. The advert of this print was published in the Amsterdamsche Courant on 23/11/1775 and the volume was apparently published by Siegfried Markordt in Amsterdam.\n\nAround the same time, Hummel produced another print by Colizzi, his Airs Choisis (1776, D-F). Again, this work was previously known but the precise date was unknown (adverted in ‘s Gravenhaagsche Courant, 22/01/1776). This publication is a collection of vocal works arranged into violin/mandolin duets. It is preserved in the University Library J. C. Senckenberg of Frankfurt (D-F, Mus. pr. Q 57/41, also available online.) The arias are from:\n\nFrançois-André Danican Philidor, Tom Jones (Comédie Italienne, 1765)\n\nJohann Paul Aegidius Martini, Henri IV, ou la Bataille d’Ivry (Opéra Comique, 1774)\n\nAndré Ernest Modeste Grétry, Zemire et Azor (Comédie Italienne, 1771)\n\nCharles-Simon Favart, La Rosière de Salency (Château de Fontainebleau, 1769)\n\nPierre Vachon, Sara ou la Fermière Ecossaise (Comédie Italienne, 1773)\n\nNicolas Dezéde, L’erreur d’un moment ou la Suite de Julie (Opéra-Comique, 1773)\n\nAndré Ernest Modeste Grétry, Le Magnifique (Comédie Italienne, 1773)\n\nOnly a few excerpts remain unidentified, such as the “Ombres Chinoises”, but there are also an “Air du Sr. Colizzi” (“Serin je voudrois”) and a “Minuetto de Fantuccini Italiani”.\n\nJust after the era of Gervasio, on 10/03/1778, Giovanni Cifolelli also played at a concert the Netherlands. Cifolelli is lesser known than most mandolin players who were active in France. This is probably due to the lack of mandolin music he left, where most other players published several volumes in Paris. However, Cifolelli successfully performed on and taught the mandolin before embarking on a career as opera composer. (There are some claims that he also wrote a mandolin method, but these come from quite late sources without any contemporary adverts or other proof to back up this claim.)\n\nCifolelli’s concert includes music from his last opera (called La Probité Villageoise in the advert, usually called by the name Perrin et Lucette, created Comédie Italienne, 1774). Cifolelli’s son participated by playing on the mandolin. Another work mentioned is a duo from Orphée et Eurydice by Gluck (possibly Vieni, appaga il tuo consorte / Viens, suis un époux?). The tickets for the concert are sold both at Hummel in Amsterdam as well as via Cifolelli (and Polet in Paris). There are some tertiary works that mention Cifolelli played in Maastricht before coming to Amsterdam. As I have not been able to look into the secondary sources confirming concerts in Maastricht (let alone the mandolin as part of them) this is not withheld in the lists of concerts.\n\nFifth period (1786, 1792, 1802): Ricciardi, Cifolelli\n\nAlas, after decades of continuous concerts, with on average several concerts per year, suddenly the mandolin concerts grind to a halt. The decline of interest in the mandolin in the 1780s is also seen elsewhere, so it doesn’t come as a surprise. The unrest in the 1780s, 1790s and early 1800s doesn’t explain the low amount of mandolin concerts, so there likely was either less interest in mandolin concerts in the Netherlands, or the mandolin players didn’t travel to the Netherlands. The concerts that were still organized in these troubled decades simply don’t involve the mandolin as often as before. One reason for the diminished interested is that the mandolin could no longer ride the wave of the style galant.\n\nThe news is not all bad though, as it seems there were still occasional concerts which involved the mandolin. One is from a known figure from before: Rossignol and his troupe return for at least one time (1786), in the Muziekcollege in Utrecht. Again Rossignol tries to entice the audience in the advert by claiming that the “mandoline, mandole and tambour de bas organisé” are “instrument never heard here before”. The concert is also joined by seigneur Joubert (violin), known to have played with Rossignol before (on 04/08/1766).\n\nA concert on 25/04/1792 mentions another earlier encountered name: Cifolelli. However, at such a late date it can be questioned whether this was Giovanni Cifolelli or one of his sons. After all, during the concert in the Netherlands in 1778, one of the sons is also announced to play mandolin. In the advert in 1792, Cifolelli is announced to perform a sonata and variations at the Rotterdamschen Schouwburg between two operas (Grétry, Le Magnifique (Comédie Italienne, 1773) & d’Aleyrac, L’amant statue (Comédie Italienne, 1785)).\n\nOne mandolin player never before encountered is a certain Ricciardi. He is noted to play at least twice: in 1786 and 1802, both in Amsterdam. Both concerts are organized by Ricciardi. The advert for the second concert also gives an initial “N.”. That is interesting, as there are notices of a Nicola Ricciardi having played double bass in the Felix Meritis archive (on 31/10/1788 & 01/11/1788). Likely Ricciardi was hence a versatile musician, who took to the mandolin during concerts he organized, but was professional enough to make money playing other instruments as well.\n\nRicciardi also sung during his concerts, extending his talents beyond the mandolin and (likely) double bass (see above). Remarkable is that Ricciardi is joined by so many participating professional musicians: Mr. Agazzi (viola d’amore, piano forte), Mad. Baillet (singing), Mad. Clairville (singing), Monsr. Deyris (singing), Mr. Klyt (“le fils”, clarinet), Mad. Lobé (singing), Monsr. Mançeau (singing), Mr. Muller (violin), Mr. Rauppe (cello), Sr. Tenducci (composition, clarinet, oboe, piano forte), Mr. Seeburger (hunting horn), Mr. Soligni (singing).\n\nI have traced one more concert advert which mentions Ricciardi together with a certain Duprat (13/03/1800, Amsterdamsche Courant, n. 31, p. 2), for a concert on 14/03/1800). The advert only states they will hold a “vocal and instrumental concert” without specifying it further. Though I consider it likely Ricciardi played mandolin, we have only two other concert adverts linked to mandolin playing, which is too little evidence to claim the concert in 1800 as a mandolin concert.\n\nPotentially Ricciardi, Cifolelli , Folchini (see below), or even another, unknown musician, could be the “Italiaansche Comique Zanger” (loosely translated: Italian singer of comic operas) playing on mandolin on 13/07/1792 at Huis ten Bosch in Amsterdam.\n\nWith 5 concerts from 1786 until 1802, and none between 1778 and 1786, it is clear that the mandolin is not doing well, though not entirely disappearing from the stage. More uplifting news can be read in other adverts during the 1780s and 1790s. These decades saw a continuous stream of print adverts from Hummel. These are not directly related to the mandolin, but quite a lot of them now mention Hummel sells “all kinds of instruments” as well as “best Italian strings” for “violin, viola, cello, contrabass, harp and mandolin” (later also including “lute, guitar, piano forte, harpsichord, cittern”). Though the adverts only refer to selling mandolins in the most general sense, there is some confirmation to be found elsewhere. There are several adverts from 1822, when Hummel’s shop closed. These clearly mention mandolins as part of the stock to be sold. The adverts by Hummel are joined by adverts from Antonie Van Parys in 1783, who announces selling mandolins in his shop in the Warmoesstraat in Amsterdam. So, even though the concerts of travelling musicians have dwindled, we have proof there were local people buying mandolins and strings.\n\nThere is also even an advert from a teacher, François Darme. However, the advert is less than convincing that this person really was much at home on the mandolin. He claims to teach “vocal and instrument music, the violin and flageolet [NB: type of flute] and the art of plucking the two types of guitars, the Spanish or the mandolin, the cittern or the English guitar: he observes that these are the two instruments that ally best with the voice”. Teaching adverts are rare – so Darme likely had moved to The Hague close to the date of the adverts and hoped to establish himself through these adverts.\n\nSixth period (1804, 1807): Folchini\n\nAt the end of the Batavian Republic and during the Napoleonic Kingdom, we so far traced only 4 mandolin concerts through adverts. The first is a concert by someone called “Faschini” mentioned in an advert in 1804 in Leeuwarden. I consider it likely this to be one and the some person as Folchini, who held three concerts in The Hague in 1807. This person, or one of them if they are indeed two separate musicians, could also have been the anonymous mandolin player of the concert in 1792. (Faschini is claimed to be an Italian singer in the advert.)\n\nThe three 1807 concerts are at the Theatre Français in The Hague, played by Folchini together with a certain Varini. Varini played an instrument of his own invention, the “fer harmonique”, which seems to have been a set of steel tubes arranged in a semi-circle and which he played with a bow. The advert for the concerts in 1807 also stated: “Folchini excels in the treatment of an instrument, of real Italian taste, but since some years more or less neglected, namely the mandolin. The clarity of presentation, even of the most difficult pieces, on an instrument of such small make, are rightly admired by the public.” This statements seem to confirm that the mandolin was indeed less popular than in its heyday of the 1760s and 1770s.\n\nThe three Folchini/Varini concerts are always directly followed by an opera (at least once Aline Reine de Golconde (Pierre-Alexandre Monsigny, created Salles des Machines, 1766), at least once Euphrosine ou le tyran corrigé (Étienne-Nicolas Méhul, created Salle Favart, 1790)). Potentially the ensemble of the Théâtre Français participated during the concert of Folchini and Varini, but the advert never makes this clear. The Theatre Français already operated in the Schouwburg (later Koninklijke Schouwburg) in The Hague in 1807 (see picture).\n\nSeventh period (1818, 1838-1842): Reggi, Pochintesta, Comorelli\n\nAfter 1815, the Netherlands enters a new era with a new kingdom established, to be ruled by the line of Orange-Nassau as sovereign ruler. It’s interesting to see that not too much after the end of the Napoleonic era, in 1818, there seems to have been at least 2 concerts in Middelburg, by Michel Booy and Comorelli. The former seems to have made music by beating on his chin; and Comorelli on the guitar and mandolin. Comorelli is discussed further below, as he also returns in 1840 & 1841 for concerts. The only other advert worthy of note from early on in this period are those connected to the clearance of Hummel’s shop in 1822. These adverts list mandolins to be sold, confirming in full that Hummel not only sold mandolin strings but also instruments.\n\nAround 1840, there is suddenly a new revival of the mandolin. It starts with an announcement for a concert in Leiden (on 28/05/1838), where two sets of Italian brothers by the names of Reggi and Pochintesta will play the mandolin. This group of musicians then moved to Rotterdam (two concerts in the Vauxhall Doele). Both the adverts in Leiden and Rotterdam mention the brothers Reggi to have been “honorary mandolinists” of Marie Louise, duchess of Parma. This is an interesting development as I had no previous knowledge of the Reggi brothers and their service to Marie Louise. From the explicit mention of the title of Marie Louise as duchess of Parma, it could be assumed that their employ was from after her break with Napoleon. Most likely their passage at her court would hence be from between 1816 and 1838.\n\nThis boastful title linked to the duchess of Parma is also found in an advert in Breda, where alternative spelling is encountered, listing the brothers as “Peggi”. For a concert by Pochintesta in 1841, there is another mandolin player mentioned by a certain “Puggi”. Though a bit less obvious, I think this might well be another variant of the Reggis’ last name. I have not that much more information about the Reggis than what is put in the adverts, but at least we have now identified another pair of mandolin musicians travelling abroad for concerts around the mid-19th century.\n\nThe Pochintesta brothers are as enigmatic as the Reggis. After their first collaborations with the Reggis, they seem to have gone on without them (except perhaps for a brief new collaboration in 1841 already mentioned above). Both the Reggis’ and Pochintestas’ concerts are in important venues such as the Vauxhall Doele in Rotterdam, the Theatre Français in Breda and the Zaal de Duizend Kolommen in Amsterdam. The concerts by the Pochintestas in De Duizend Kolommen likely exceeded the three concerts I listed. The adverts mention “and afterwards all evenings” and are in fact usually post factum (first concert each time already held before the advert). When filling in the days in between the stated three starting dates, 28/03/1841-13/04/1841, it would mean they could have played up to 17 times. But as we have only the vaguest of mentions, I have only entered the start date of these concerts as listed in the advert. The Pochintestas are joined quite a number of times by a certain Zelas, a guitar player from Naples, and a singer called Dunot.\n\nThe other person of interest in this period is Comorelli, who returns to our attention after his concerts with Booy in 1818. In one advert in 1841 (08/01/1841), Comorelli is given the initial “D.”. In yet another advert, his provenance is stated as well “first mandolin of Verona” (concert on 30/05/1841). His last name is sometimes spelled differently: Comorelli is used most often, but Comarelli or Commarelli is also encountered. Comorelli gave 9 concerts in 1840 and 1841, mostly together with some singers. Sometimes these are just noted as “singers from Tirol”, but often the name “Von Rammstaetter” turns up. There appears to have been a father (Adolf) and a woman. I’ve not found a lot more information about the Von Rammstaetters except for a marriage announcement for a certain Adolf Von Rammstaetter with C. J. Meere in Utrecht on 06/10/1841 (advert Opregte Haarlemsche Courant on 12/10/1841, n. 122, p.3). They seem to have enjoyed some success in Warffum, Zuidhorn, Grijpskerk and Leeuwarden. Comorelli is later on encountered a last time during a concert in 1841 in Groningen with a singer called Theodor, but also with a guitar player called “Zella”. Most likely this is the same as the guitar player called “Zelas” who joined the Pochintestas in 1841.\n\nAnother interesting source to consider is a beautiful painting by Charles van Beveren, The Duet, from ca. 1830-1850. Van Beveren had settled in Amsterdam during the time when this composition was created. As he also spent some time in Rome and elsewhere, we can’t rule out he found inspiration abroad rather than in the Netherlands. Even if that were the case, it is a nice painting featuring the mandolin from someone mainly living and working in the Netherlands.\n\nThe mandolin in question is painted in quite a lot of detail, and seems to be a contemporary one. Previously, mandolins often have more elaborate decorations such as inly in the fingerboard, a more extensive rosette, and a scratch plate in tortoiseshell (see the 18th century Vinaccia from the Rijksmuseum below). The mandolin in the painting already features the simpler multiple wooden purflings around the sound hole as rosette and a wooden inlay scratch plate. The instrument misses the typical inlay at the bottom of the soundboard (often a pattern in mother-of-pearl is found in 18th century mandolins, and early 19th century instruments sometimes have that pattern in wooden inlay). At the other end, the instrument in the painting still seems to have bone or ivory bindings and inlay in the head. The fact that the instrument doesn’t yet have a raised fingerboard can’t easily be used to date it, as there are still some late 19th century examples of this.\n\nThere are a number of exquisite mandolins preserved in the Rijksmuseum and other musea in the Netherlands. However, none of these have antecedents proving they were used locally. Even if these might not have been used in the Netherlands, they are still representative of the type of mandolins used in the late 18th and early 19th century. Let’s first of all look at an early 19th century specimen, not dissimilar to the one in the painting by van Beveren.\n\nAs a contrast, below you can view a nicely decorated 18th century mandolin (earlier shown in this article when discussing the third period). Though anonymous this instrument is most likely from the Vinaccia family from Naples, around the 1770s. The level of decoration in this instrument is on the higher side, but a lot of the 18th century mandolins have extensive inlays in mother-of-pearl, tortoiseshell and bone or ivory, and lots of purfling.\n\nI currently have no knowledge of local Dutch production of mandolins during the late 18th or early 19th century. None of the adverts that mention mandolins are for sale mention their origin, so it’s not known whether these were imported or locally produced. But we know that Amsterdam was a luthier center, and luthiers in other countries also produced mandolins in the 18th and 19th century (for example, Portugal and France). So it is not impossible that some day we’ll find proof of local Dutch mandolin production from 1750-1850, but currently we don’t have it.\n\nConclusions\n\nSeveral known mandolin players visited the Netherlands for concerts – Merchi, Gervasio and Zaniboni visited quite a number of times; Fridzeri, Mazzuchelli, Cifolelli and Leone visited only a limited amount of times. Previously unknown artists also show up, most frequent the two mandolin players who joined the troupe of Joseph Rossignol of Malta: Nicolas Cajetani (also often called Gaëtani) and Severino Peres. The large amount of concerts from 1759 until 1779 combined with high-profile venues and contributing musicians confirm the success story of the mandolin in the Netherlands. Corroboration can also be spotted in adverts for buying mandolins and strings, as well as a small number of prints linked to the mandolin activity. After 1779, the popularity is clearly on its way back. Though activity is much reduced in the early 19th century, some previously unknown mandolin musicians still held concerts during the Batavian Republic, Bonaparte Kingdom and the subsequent Kingdom of the House of Orange. The adverts from concerts of mandolin players Ricciardi, Folchini, Commarelli and brothers Reggi and Pochintesta show "
