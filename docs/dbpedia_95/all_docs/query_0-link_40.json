        "text": "Our drivers to and from were of utmost professionalism, always on time, if not early! Our Discover Tuscany tour was perhaps our favorite as we ended up at the Casanova farm for a most delightful lunch and education on balsamic Vinegar.\n\nWithout hesitation I would recommend your services for anyone traveling to Italy or anywhere you go for that matter. We enjoyed every minute of our tour and will remember it always!\n\nAttached are a few photos of our time Italy. The last photo of the bunch is in Venice where we had front row seats to the George Clooney wedding watch! We did indeed see George Clooney twice in his boat parade which made our Venice visit even more special.\n\nThank you again,\n\nLisa\n\n...Show less\n\nOur limo drivers/guides Giovanni and Francesco were fabulous. Giovanni had a great rapport, especially with my husband, as they were both retired police officers. Both drivers made us feel so comfortable, and even stopping and pointing out many historical and interesting sites along our drive. They were patient and never rushed us. Loved them!\n\nNext would like to talk about our guides in Rome, Florence and Venice in that order.\n\nIn Rome, we had a beautiful young woman named Federica; she was very knowledgeable in Roman history. Our tour through The Coliseum, Vatican City, and the Sistine Chapel were filled with interesting facts and even great little tid-bits of trivia that we will always remember.\n\nIn the beautiful city of Florence we met our guide Elvio… I want to say that if all my teachers were as passionate and interesting as Elvio I would still be attending school (and I am in my 60′s). The excitement in his voice, especially while explaining the story of ‘The David’, it drew us in totally. He is a ‘Master’ at his craft’. Just can’t say enough about him.\n\nOur last guide Ivan, whom we met in Venice, asked us if we would rather go off the beaten path and actually see where the locals go (ergo the photo of the fish market), we jumped at the chance and said yes. He took us through side allies, across bridges and found ourselves in the midst of the local markets. He stopped to discuss the history of the wells in the center of the little squares (quite interesting). Also, slipped into a few churches and he described the amazing frescoes, and mosaics inside and outside the churches.\n\nWe even went through a children’s book museum (I think that’s what it was as its hard to remember it all…even though I took notes.) Ivan pointed out a little restaurant that he said we should go to after our tour of Doges Palace.\n\nHe had purchased tickets for us so we didn’t have to wait on line. Of course we took him up on that. So after the Palace tour we sat with a glass of ‘Vino’ overlooking the Grand Canal… what can I say, it was breathtaking! But my favorite story of Venice was ‘The Bridge of Sighs’. Every site was more interesting than the last.\n\nVenice is an amazing ancient city. Every corner is filled with exciting history. We loved it all. Faye thanks for also arranging the perfect weather we had, sun every day.\n\nThis was a trip we will be talking about for a long time. Thanks again Faye for all you did. We will be looking forward to our next trip with you. See photos below.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nNancy & Charlie\n\n...Show less"
