Fruity scents arrive on the nose, followed by spicy nuances. Upon tasting it shows that it still has robust tannins, but perfectly integrated into the texture. It is capable of certain evolutions over the next few years.\n\nCOMBINATIONS\n\nIt goes very well with preparations based on red meat, game and noble poultry. Excellent with roast new duck.\n\nVINO NOBILE DI MONTEPULCIANO DOCG 2020 - PODERI BOSCARELLI: WHY WE LIKE IT\n\nVino Nobile di Montepulciano DOCG is the oldest label of the Poderi Boscarelli winery, emblematic and representative of the company's work philosophy. Since 1968 it has always constituted approximately half of the production, and its composition and its winemaking and aging methods have remained substantially unchanged. Matured in Allier and Slavonian oak for 18 to 24 months. It manages to combine freshness, elegance, complexity and great potential for durability over time.\n\nCELLAR\n\nBoscarelli is a small and historic family company, a symbol for the entire Montepulciano area, the first to believe in the potential of an area so close to Montalcino. We are in fact about 300 meters above sea level, towards the Valdichiana, in a terroir where the microclimate is particularly suitable for the production of quality wines.\n\nAt the helm of the winery are the grandchildren of the legendary Egidio Corradi, who founded the company in 1962. Among the rows, which extend for approximately 14 hectares, Sangiovese is the most present vine, with several clones. We then find other native varieties such as Mammolo Canaiolo and Colorino, together with renowned international varieties such as Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon.\n\nThe quality of all the production is very high, a reflection of impeccable work and continuous maximization of the expression of the different soils. The harvest phase differs depending on the ripeness of each grape, and even in the cellar the individual varieties ferment separately - just think that for Sangiovese, for example, around 30 different cuvées are obtained, combined in the final blending phase -, and this it also happens for the maturation phase. A philosophy that requires a lot of work, but which allows us to express the deepest character of each plot.\n\nProduction today is around 100,000 bottles, of which 80% is concentrated on the Vino Nobile di Montepulciano, made both in the vintage and with the Riserva, classic and \"Sotto Casa\". Within the range we then find the \"Nocio\", the Rosso di Montepulciano and also very few bottles of Vin Santo, prepared following the best Tuscan tradition. In some vintages Boscarelli then produces the \"Boscarelli dei Boscarelli\", a blend of merlot and cabernet sauvignon of clear international inspiration.\n\nLabels that tell a beautiful family story, which looks to the future challenges of wine with optimism and the desire to test oneself."
