Proceeds from the dinner support scholarships at the Academy for Italian artists and scholars, and make it possible for one Academy Fellow each year to attend the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa. These fellowships provide both Italian and American winners with important opportunities to pursue their individual studies, to participate in and contribute to international discourse in their fields and disciplines, and to gain experience that will be invaluable throughout their careers.\n\nThe McKim Medal was established by the Trustees of the American Academy in Rome in 2005 to be an annual prize that honors an individual whose work internationally, most particularly in Italy and in the United States, has contributed significantly to the arts and humanities. Named for Charles Follen McKim (1847–1909), noted architect who established the Academy in 1894, the prize recognizes as well an individual whose work and life exemplify creative and intellectual exchange across the arts, scholarship, language, and culture. The medal awarded each year was designed for the Academy by Cy Twombly.\n\nFor information please contact Inga Clausing at +39 06-5846-474, or write to i.clausing [at] aarome.org (i[dot]clausing[at]aarome[dot]org).\n\nPrevious McKim Medal Laureates are:\n\n2011: Luigi Ontani, artist\n\n2010: Miuccia Prada, fashion designer\n\n2009: Ennio Morricone, composer and music conductor\n\n2008: Franco Zeffirelli, producer and director\n\n2007: Umberto Eco, writer\n\n2006: Cy Twombly, artist\n\n2005: Renzo Piano, architect\n\nThe American Academy in Rome honors Maestro Bernardo Bertolucci\n\nDinner Chairman\n\nValentina Moncada Di Paternò\n\nHonorary Dinner Chairmen\n\nThe Honorable and Mrs. David H.
