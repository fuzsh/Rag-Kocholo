        "text": "Traveling to Sicily can be easily done independently. However, if you want to experience the island adding a personal and luxury touch, a travel planner can help a lot in making the best of your days. We have interviewed Vita, Luxury Travel Advisor at Sicily Lifestyle, and we have asked her what a Travel Advisor…\n\nAt Sicily Lifestyle, we are a team of Sicily experts. We specialize in crafting exclusive travel itineraries and ensuring our guests get to experience the very best that Sicily has to offer.\n\nWe know that as travelers, our clients have their own ideas as to what makes a ‘luxury’ travel. We work with our clients to understand their needs and to tailor our suggestions accordingly.\n\nKnowing the island inside out, we can work closely with you to ensure your experience of Sicily is truly unforgettable. But what really does a Luxury Travel Advisor? What are her/his duties? How can the support given by a luxury travel planner make the difference?\n\nTo these and many other questions, we have asked our expert Sicily travel planner, Vita. She tells us what a luxury travel planner really does, and why if you are traveling to Sicily you might want to consider one.\n\nOver to Vita…\n\nWhat does it mean being a luxury travel advisor?\n\nTraveling has never been so valuable as in these post-pandemic times. People have been waiting so long to be able to travel again and have been dreaming about new adventures.\n\nBeing a luxury travel advisor and planner means now more than ever, to give shape to a dream and actually hand the key to doors. Our deep and first-hand knowledge of the destination makes these authentic experiences possible.\n\nWhat are the duties of a luxury travel advisor?\n\nA local luxury travel advisor must work on two main factors:\n\nThe knowledge of the destination\n\nThe knowledge of the client\n\nEvery client has a different vision for their trip. The planning starts with understanding from the client as much as as possible about their needs and wishes. This is absolutely essential when it comes to designing a tailor-made itinerary.\n\nBehind a perfectly crafted itinerary, there is a huge work ‘on the ground’ in the territory. We want to know we are supplying our clients with the very best experiences.\n\nThis means trying firsthand all the tours and experiences our clients will do, visiting hotels, restaurants, selecting and meeting all the suppliers, guides, drivers, and hosts that will make up our client’s trip.\n\nWhat are the challenges you meet when planning a luxury trip or tours in Sicily?\n\nWorking with third-party travel agents between us and the final client, misunderstandings can be easy to happen. So it is extremely important to have clear communications with all parties.\n\nAt Sicily Lifestyle, we pride ourselves on our transparency, and thoroughness for a smooth planning process and a satisfied customer.\n\nOther Challenges in Sicily may arise when clients have a short time and yet they want to [understandably!] visit the whole Island.\n\nSome people think that with Sicily being an Island, it is small and that the most popular destinations are all quite close to one another.\n\nSicily extends for 25711 km2, distances are quite long and roads are not always greatly connected, so in reality, it’s not usually possible to see everything in one trip.\n\nKnowing the length of the trip is essential in order to understand in which areas to focus, rather than splitting the stay in too many hotels, requiring the client to pack and unpack their luggage every night and spend too much time sitting in a car instead of sightseeing and relaxing.\n\nWhat are the typical “luxury” travelers looking for?\n\nThe typical “luxury” travelers in Sicily look for authentic experiences with locals, as well as getting a taste of the culture, and history considering that Sicily hosts seven Unesco World heritage sites. Another key aspect travelers look for in Sicily are amazing nature and food&wine related experiences.\n\nWhat are the key secrets of a luxury travel advisor?\n\nCreativity, empathy, great knowledge of the destination, and top-notch suppliers are essential to work with a high-end client who is seeking stress-free planning, flexibility before and during the trip, and high-quality service throughout the process.\n\nWhat are the most requested tours and destinations in Sicily?\n\nEtna, Taormina, the Valley of Temples, and Noto are absolutely a must!\n\nAlong with these top sellers, there is Palermo and its noble heritage, its amazing architecture, and the traditional street food made every day in the folkloristic local market.\n\nLately, we’ve been receiving a lot of requests from clients who want to experience a romantic getaway in the countryside of Noto and Siracusa, where some of the best boutique hotels are located as well as luxury yacht cruises in the Aeolian Islands.\n\nWhat are the less known places in Sicily that you would, instead, recommend to your clients?\n\nThe Island of Pantelleria is still less known compared to the Aeolian Islands, which are not as beaten by tourism as the mainland of Sicily, but yet a popular destination.\n\nPantelleria is still an unspoiled, virgin land; an ideal place to unwind, relax and discover all it has to offer: nature, great landscapes, and amazing wines and food.\n\nWhat do you want to know from your potential client in order to craft the perfect itinerary?\n\nWe need to know the basic information such as the number of people, if it’s a multi-gen trip, a honeymoon/celebration, length of the journey and an estimated budget.\n\nIt is also very important to go deeper in the knowledge of the client, making the right questions in the pre-planning phase in order to craft the most suitable experiences for that specific customer so that expectations are met [and exceeded!].\n\nWhat are the most memorable tours and experiences you have organized in Sicily? Can you tell us some unique details about them?\n\nThe most memorable experience I have organized was for a multi-generational trip with clients who had Sicilian roots.\n\nThey asked us to do family heritage research, which lead us to go through tons of documents in the archives of the city hall of a tiny village on the west coast of Sicily.\n\nAs it usually happens in Sicily, as soon as the word spread through the village, a lot of people, from the mayor to a cultural/historic association decided to take part in the research and found relatives who were still living in the village.\n\nAt that point, we decided to give updates about the research before their trip to Sicily, but we didn’t tell them that on the day of their visit to their ancestor’s village, they would actually meet their relatives for the first time.\n\nYou can imagine how emotional this day was for our clients and also for the whole village, who welcomed this American Family as they were part of the community.\n\nWhat is the most valuable advice you would give to someone that wants to plan a trip to Sicily?\n\nFirst of all, to live as a local as much as they can and to leave behind the mainstream idea of ‘luxury’ because in Sicily, luxury is not something they will see, but more something they will feel.\n\nIt is not something they will find in fancy things and services, but in the people that will make their stay special, from the driver at the airport to the Sicilian Mamma who will welcome them to her home and treat them like family.\n\nIf you had 3 days to experience Sicily, what would your personal itinerary include?\n\nWith 3 days available I would focus on the East coast of Sicily.\n\nI would land in Catania and would stay at the Belmond Hotel Timeo in Taormina. On my arrival day I would simply enjoy a guided walk of Taormina and its ancient Greek Theater and then relax at the beach and have a traditional dinner in a tiny family restaurant overlooking the sea.\n\nOn my second day I would definitely do a hike on Mt. Etna, or take a helicopter tour, and stop in a winery for lunch and to enjoy great food and taste the Etna Doc wines.\n\nOn my last day I would definitely head to the south-east area of Sicily, visit Siracusa and have an easy lunch at the local market, then head to Noto to see its baroque palaces and stop at Caffè Sicilia to meet the best and most well-known pastry chef in Sicily and try his granita made with the delicious Avola Almond!\n\n–\n\nVita is our beloved Travel Advisor, she takes care of our clients from the beginning till your last day in Sicily with us. If you have been inspired by Vita’s expertise and knowledge, get in touch with us today and we can start to explore your perfect Sicily itinerary!\n\nThe Feast of Sant’Agata in Catania – The event that all Catanese’s people are looking forward to\n\nFor centuries, the first week of February has been a special time of celebration to people of Catania. Starting on the 3rd of February, begins the Feast of Sant’Agata – a three-day long celebration, full of faith, devotion and tradition.\n\nThis incredible event brings tens of thousands of devotees to the streets of Catania in a spectacular expression of worship to give thanks to the city’s patron saint – Saint Agata.\n\nDuring Festa di Sant’Agata, Catania is dressed in luminous lights, thousands of candles and flowers are offered to the saint and each evening of the feast is celebrated by elaborate fireworks.\n\nWho was Sant’Agata?\n\nSaint Agata is beloved by all Catanese people for her show of courage and principle at a young age. The beautiful young virgin was born into a Christian aristocratic family and decided to devote her life to God.\n\nHowever, her beauty caught the eye of Roman Proconsul Quintianus. She resisted his advances and marriage proposal, which unleashed a campaign of religious persecution against her. She was rolled on hot coals and had her breasts amputated, and subsequently died a martyr’s death on 5 February 251. Soon after, became a cult figure of Catania and a symbol of Sicily’s struggle against the Roman abuse of power.\n\nLegends of her patronage\n\nShe became the patron saint of Catania and legends tell of her protecting Catania against Mount Etna’s eruptions, earthquakes and some epidemics. Legend has it that on February 1st, 252 – just before the first anniversary of her death, the city was threatened by a violent eruption. The inhabitants of the nearby villages, terrified, took the veil that was wrapped around her tomb, and used it as a shield against the lava flow. The white veil suddenly turned red and stopped the eruption on exactly February 5th, the day of her death.\n\nFestival schedule\n\nFebruary 3rd – the festival begins with the procession of the cannalori, eleven heavy gilded sculptures each holding a candle. They are carried on the shoulders of men through the streets and eventually to the Piazza Duomo where a concert and fireworks close the day.\n\nFebruary 4th – is the day on which Sant’Agata’s statue is carried through the Cathedral and the city streets. Joined by thousands of worshippers, dressed in white cloth and black caps, the procession takes the statue throughout the city starting at 8am until 11pm, which is no small feat. Devotees carry enormous candles as offerings to the saint and the streets of Catania are covered by sawdust in order to protect the pavement from the burning candlewax.\n\nFebruary 5th – the final day, the statue is taken on another tour of the city. The final leg of the procession is a speedy sprint up Via San Giuliano, symbolic of the strength and devotion of the statue bearers in spite of their heavy load. There is also a special stop on this final day on Via Crociferi bythe monastery of Benedictine nuns. The nuns come out to greet Sant’Agata and sing to her, which is especially unique because the nuns do not leave the monastery for the rest of the year.\n\nThe Feast of Sant’Agata is a very unique and special experience. During these three days, a collective energy unlike any other embraces the city. Worship, thankfulness, hope, devotion envelop all who participate and regardless your belief or religion, it is a truly spectacular and moving experience.\n\nAn invitation to experience family sharing in the Sicilian kitchen\n\nA few kilometers from Taormina, between the Alcantara River Park and Mount Etna, stands Motta Camastra, a small village inhabited by just 600 people, which still manages to express the face of an authentic Sicily that has stood still in time.\n\nThrough the silent squares and the breathtaking views over the Alcantara Valley, the narrow and fascinating streets, the hidden corners where life passes slowly, is set a natural culinary and social experience put in place by the “Mamma del Borgo” ~ “The Mothers of the Village” which tells the story of Sicily in its simplicity and naturalness through home cooking.\n\nIn today’s economy on the margins of tourism, where employment opportunities are scarce, the young people but also the not so young, are forced to leave their origins to find a future elsewhere. However, a group of courageous, creative and enterprising women and mothers created an opportunity for themselves. They offer – with genuineness and attachment to their land and their traditions- a new way of hosting.\n\nThe project is called “Mamme del Borgo” and it combines traditional cuisine with moments of shared joy, dishes exclusively based on local products and the camaraderie and connection between local people and tourists. In fact, the goal is not only to create an employment opportunity but also to re-evaluate the area.\n\nThe raw materials come from the surrounding countryside, so everything is zero kilometer. The preparation takes place inside the mothers’ home in full compliance with the principle of community sustainability, which characterizes the activity at every stage and makes it unique in its kind in Sicily. Interaction with local people is certainly one of the aspects that makes the activity engaging.\n\nTypical products of Sicilian cuisine- including hot baked ricotta, caciocavallo, pecorino, baked peppers and stuffed aubergines, make up the appetizers. Followed by the preparation of maccheroni alla norma and arancini with wild fennel from scratch was definitely one of the most fun activities.\n\nConsidering the time and dedication required to make these dishes, they are generally only found on holidays and Sundays on Sicilian tables, which makes the experience all the more special.\n\nPreparing macaroni is an art that has been handed down from generation to generation. Being part of this tradition, directly in the kitchens, alongside the mothers of Motta Camastra allows you to savor the pleasure of family sharing that you can only breathe in Sicilian homes.\n\nAt the end of the meal you cannot miss the dessert, the pancakes stuffed with ricotta and covered with a delicate layer of sugar. The wine served is the local one, the result of the work of the local farmers who with millenary techniques create a 100% organic product.\n\nTo make everything even more unique and wonderfully authentic- are the companions. The children of the mothers and a group of young people from the village who with naturalness, sweetness and spontaneity accompany guests along the alleys of the village, making them discover the corners that otherwise they would distractedly risk to lose. They are also the protagonists of an experience that will remain in the hearts of those who have the honor of living it.\n\nIt’s not all. Motta Camastra, with the nearby Castello degli Schiavi and Bar Vitelli , was chosen in 1972 by Francis Ford Coppola as the shooting location for the film “The Godfather” to take on the role of Corleone.\n\nOne more reason to get to know the village that has been working tirelessly since 2016 to let anyone who reaches it experience the traditional hospitality of Sicily."
