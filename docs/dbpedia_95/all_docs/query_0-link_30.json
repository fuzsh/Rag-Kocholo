Ceci est mon testament et la disposition de ma dernière volonti que je désire être exécutée. J'espère beaucoup de la miséricorde divine en vertu de la foi pure que le secours de la grâce m'a fait conserver et du zèle que j'ai toujours eu pour la défendre. C'est dans cette foi que je prétends mourir ainsi que dans les sentiments et soumission à toutes les décisions de l'Église et d'obéissance à Notre Saint-Père le Pape qui en est le chef, recommandant mon âme à Dieu par la protection de la Sainte Vierge et par l'intercession des saints.\n\nSi je meurs à Paris, je souhaite d'être enterré sans cérémonie dans la chapelle de la Mercy près de Monsieur et Madame de Soubise, mes père et mère. Si je meurs en Alsace, je choisis pour ma sépulture le lieu que mon grand chapitre jugera être le plus convenable dans ma cathédrale. Je charge mon héritier et légataire universel ci-après nommé d'ordonner les prières et services pour le repos de mon âme sans faste et selon l'humilité chrétienne.\n\nJe donne et lègue aux pauvres ou nouveaux convertis de mon évêché pour être distribué à la volonté du cardinal de Soubise mon neveu et aux pauvres de chacune de mes abbayes, à la disposition de mon héritier ou légataire universel, savoir dans mon évêché la somme de vingt mille livres, dans l'abbaye de Saint-Vaast d'Arras la somme de six mille livres, dans les abbayes de La Chaise-Dieu et de Foigny dans chacune trois mille livres.\n\nJe donne et lègue en outre à l'hôpital de Saverne une somme de deux mille livres. Je donne et lègue une pension viagère de quatre cents livres à la prieure de Conflans près de Paris.\n\nJe donne et lègue à ceux de mes domestiques portant livrée qui sont à mon service depuis dix ans ou plus, c'est-à-dire aux laquais attachès à ma personne, aux coureurs, porteurs, suisses et trois premiers cochers, chacun quatre cents livres une fois payés, aux trois premiers postillons la somme de trois cents livres et aux autres de cette livrée qui ne m'aurait pas servi pendant l'espace de dix années la somme de deux cents livres et à l'égard des gardes de chasse et portiers portant ma livrée une somme de cent cinquante livres...\n\nEn priant le cardinal de Soubise, mon coadjuteur, de suivre par rapport à son successeur l'exemple que je donne par rapport à lui, en quoi nous nous rapprocherons l'un de l'autre de l'usage observé jusqu'àprésent dans mon Eglise et nous mettrons nos successeurs qui sans doute nous imiteront, en état de soutenir décemment et dignement leur dignité dès leur avènement á l'èpiscopat... Si mes successeurs veulent bien faire attention aux dépenses considérables que j'ai faites pour le bâtiment du palais épiscopal, pour les châteaux de Saverne et de Mutzig, pour la construction de plusieurs maisons de recettes et presbytères, et s'ils réfléchissent que pendant mon épiscopat le prix de l'engagement des bailliages d'Oberkirch et d'Ettenheim a été remboursé et la vente de quatorze mille livres éteinte, ils ne pourront pas se dispenser de reconnaître que j'ai toujours été occupé de l'avantage et de l'utilité de mon évêché et qu'il s'en faut bien que je l'ai trouvé dans le même itat dans lequel je leur aurai laissé. Je prie le cardinal de Soubise, en qui j'ai beaucoup de confiance, de tenir la main à l'éxécution de mon présent testament.\n\n(37) 11. CUNHA E ATAÍDE, Nuno da (1664-1750)\n\nBirth.
