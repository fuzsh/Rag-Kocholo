        "text": "Background and aim The aim of this study was to calculate the equation of correlation between the microbial air contamination values obtained by active sampling (colony-forming units per cubic metre, CFU/m³) and by passive sampling (Index of microbial air contamination, IMA), by using the data from the ISChIA study (Infezioni del Sito Chirurgico in Interventi di Artroprotesi, surgical site infections in arthroprosthesis), and to compare the values obtained with the recommended limits defined by the EU Guidelines to Good Manufacturing Practice (EU GGMP), 2008, for clean areas used to manufacture sterile medicinal products. Methods Air sampling was performed during 335 elective prosthesis procedures. Correlation between CFU/m³ and IMA values was evaluated using the Spearman test; p<0.05 was considered to indicate significance. This equation was used to calculate the IMA values corresponding to the CFU/m³ recommended threshold values by EU GGMP for the different Grades of microbial contamination. Results The following correlation equation was obtained: y = 1.86 + 0.12x, where “x” = CFU/m³ value and “y” = IMA value. The relationships between CFU/m³ and IMA values obtained from active and passive sampling during the ISChIA study showed to be in line to those suggested by the EU GGMP for pharmaceutical manufacturing, in particular for Grade C and D. Conclusions This study shows that the EU GGMP relationship could be considered valid also for operating theatres. Both methods, active and passive samplings, can be used to evaluate microbial air quality and highlight critical situations; however, in particular during the activity, passive sampling estimating the risk posed by airborne microorganisms to the surgical wound, can be considered more relevant, and for its simplicity, economy and standardization, can be suggested for routine microbial monitoring.

It co-ordinates the biobank activities of the Fondazione Ca’ Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico of Milan. Such activities require specific safeguarding of donors’ rights and protection of sensitive and genetic data. The Fondazione Ca’ Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico has set up a project on informed consent with the aim of developing awareness and understanding of this issue. Within this project, it has been decided to evaluate how consent for biobanking material is expressed. Design and methods The aim of the study was to evaluate the quality and completeness of consent to biobanking in the POLI-MI biobank. This was a retrospective study carried out in 2012 on samples of consent declarations collected by biobank units in 2011. Some units used a single, standard consent model available from a previous POLI-MI biobank workgroup. Other units used models which had been previouly formulated. Evaluation was made using a form that indicated the essential elements of consent. Results A total of 48 consent declarations were collected using the single, standard model and 84 were collected using other models. The consent declarations that used the single, standard model were found to be the most complete and were filled in better than other models. Conclusions Progressive adoption of a simple, standard consent model is expected to improve the quality of consent acquisition. Regular audit of the compliance of consent practices with ethical and legal requirements is mandatory to improve the quality of research biobanking.\n\nem>Background . The aim of the study is to assess the long-term secondary effects of personal experience with the H1N1 pandemic of 2009/2010 and the perception of the institutional reaction to it on Italians’ willingness to get vaccinated in case of a novel influenza pandemic. Design and Methods . We conducted 140 face-to-face interviews in the Registry Office of the Municipality of Milan, Italy, from October to December 2012. Results . Willingness to get vaccinated during a novel influenza pandemic was best predicted by having been vaccinated against the seasonal flu in the past (OR=5.18; 95%CI: 1.40 to 19.13) and fear of losing one’s life in case of an infection with H1N1 (OR=4.09; 95%CI: 1.68 to 9.97). It was unaffected by the assessment of institutional performance. Conclusions . The findings of this study do not point to long-term secondary effects of the institutional handling of the H1N1 pandemic. The results highlight the fact that behavioural intention is not the same as behaviour, and that the former cannot simply be taken as an indicator of the latter.\n\nIntroduction: The regional healthcare system of the Lombardy Region pay great attention to monitoring the effectiveness and quality level with which its services. The aim of this paper is to describe the method adopted by the Lombardy Region to create a governance tool for the healthcare system that would be applied within hospitals to create value at financial-economic level, to achieve continuous quality improvement and to increase patient/customer satisfaction levels. It was called: Piano Integrato del Miglioramento dell'Organizzazione (PIMO), i.e. Integrated Plan for Hospital Improvement. Metods: The approach for the definition of the PIMO was based on: the Plan Do Check Act methodology; the management requirements introduced by the UNI EN ISO 9001:2008 and UNI EN ISO 9004:2005 standards; the regulations and indications made for the Public Administration; the Guidelines for planning and monitoring improvement proposed by the CAF (Common Assessment Framework). Results: The evaluation of the scores for all the health structures shows a good level of quality and qualifies PIMO as a strategic tool for hospitals. Conclusions: It will be necessary to allow this tool to operate for some time in order to make an overall assessment of the results achieved.\n\nBackground: In 2014, the Italian Study Group of Hospital Hygiene of the Italian Society of Hygiene, Preventive Medicine and Public Health (GISIO-SItI), in collaboration with the National Association of Medical Hospital Managers (ANMDO), conducted a survey on the availability of procedures for cleaning and disinfecting ambulances in order to assess the practices in use. Methods: An online questionnaire was prepared through the Survey Monkey® platform and a web link access was sent to a convenience sample of ANMDO doctors working in healthcare management in public and private healthcare facilities. Results: Ninety-six questionnaires were collected (26% response rate). In 73% of cases there was a procedure for cleaning and disinfecting ambulances, which had been produced at a company level (67%) and involved various professionals. In 21% of cases the procedure had been prepared in expectation of an epidemic or following an epidemic (5%). The recommendations had been presented to the staff (90%), in 28% of cases through training events with verification of the knowledge acquired. Monitoring of the implementation of the procedure is planned in the majority of cases (88%), mainly through direct observation (92%). In 67% of cases the tender specifications for ambulance services did not include a section dedicated to cleaning and disinfection and, in the absence of a procedure, this was provided by the hospital in only 51% of case. Conclusion: This survey represented a first step towards the development of guidelines for standardising procedures and providing indications useful for their evaluation and monitoring their implementation.\n\nBackground: The Italian Study Group of Hospital Hygiene of the Italian Society of Hygiene, Preventive Medicine and Public Health promoted and conducted a study on teaching hospital hygiene, with particular reference to the prevention and control of healthcare-associated infections, with the aim of developing effective educational material starting from the results collected. Material and methods: First of all, a survey was carried out, targeting lecturers in hospital hygiene, with the purpose of investigating their perceptions regarding this issue. The available scientific literature was also reviewed in order to identify effective educational/teaching strategies for the prevention of healthcare-associated infections, so that valid training interventions could be subsequently developed. Finally, a trial-training intervention was implemented, and specific audio-visual teaching material was also tested. Results: The overall response rate to the survey was 42%, with good country-wide representativeness. The level of awareness of hospital hygiene issues by students resulted higher among trainee nurses (65%) than among medical students (44%). The teaching staff identified alternative educational methodologies to substitute the classical lecture (e.g.: case discussions) and, in most cases, the alternative solution appeared to be preferable. The teaching of hospital hygiene was better integrated with other disciplines and professional training activities in the degree courses for nurses than in those for doctors; the total number of hours assigned to such teaching was variable. The literature review highlighted that various educational approaches are used. The most common are presentations or lectures, but videos, posters, questionnaires and e-learning strategies are also used. Combining different instruments when designing an educational programme has proven to be an effective strategy. The training activity tested was positively evaluated by the participants; the possibility of multidisciplinary exchange of knowledge was particularly appreciated. Conclusion: Having considered the issue of teaching hospital hygiene from the points of view of the different protagonists involved (educators and students), this enabled us to develop useful training material and a proposal for a shared educational intervention. The subject of hospital hygiene, in particular the one related to the prevention of healthcare-associated infections, is addressed in various courses and with different modalities; it is, therefore, important to standardize course contents and teaching methods, in order to facilitate multidisciplinary debate, especially starting from case studies.\n\nBackground: Recent studies have questioned the role of unidirectional airflow ventilation system in reducing surgical site infection (SSI) in prosthetic implant surgery. The aim of the ISChIA study (\"Infezioni del Sito Chirurgico in Interventi di Artroprotesi\" which means \"Surgical site infections in arthroplasty surgery\") was to evaluate, as a contribution to this debate, the association between heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, microbial air contamination and surgical site infection in hip and knee arthroplasty. Methods: The study was performed from March 2010 to February 2012 in 14 hospitals, for a total of 28 operating theatres: 16 were equipped with vertical unidirectional airflow ventilation (U-OTs), 6 with mixed airflow ventilation (M-OTs), 6 with turbulent airflow ventilation (T-OTs). Microbial air contamination in the operating theatre was evaluated by means of passive (Index of Microbial Air contamination, IMA) and active (Colony Forming Units per cubic metre, cfu/m3) sampling. SSI surveillance was carried out according to the Hospitals in Europe Link for Infection Control through Surveillance protocol. Results: A total of 1,285 elective prosthesis procedures (61.1% hip and 38.9% knee) were included in the study. The results showed a wide variability of the air microbial contamination in operating theatres equipped with unidirectional airflow. The recommended values of ≤2 IMA and ≤10 cfu/m3 were exceeded, respectively, by 58.9% and 46.4% of samples from U-OTs and by 87.6% and 100% of samples from M-OTs. No significant difference was observed between SSI cumulative incidence in surgical procedures performed in U-OTs compared with those performed in T-OTs. A lower risk of SSI, even though not statistically significant, was shown in surgical procedures performed in U-OTs with a microbial air contamination within the recommended values (≤2 IMA and ≤10 cfu/m3) compared with those performed in U-OTs where these limits were exceeded, and compared with those performed in T-OTs with microbial air contamination within the recommended values for this type of OTs (≤25 IMA, ≤180 cfu/m3. Conclusion: ISChIA study did not show a protective effect of unidirectional airflow compared with turbulent airflow in arthroplasty surgery. However, the frequent exceeding of recommended air microbial contamination values in OTs equipped with unidirectional airflow, and the lower SSI risk in surgical procedures performed in compliant U-OTs compared with those performed in non-compliant U-OTs and with those performed in compliant T-OTs, suggest the need of further studies, which should consider air microbial contamination and other aspects of SSI prevention that may negate the potential benefits of the ventilation system; differences in intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors, medical treatment and surgical technique are also to be considered. Training interventions aimed at improving the behaviour of operators are essential.\n\nBackground: Healthcare-Associated Infections are a great concern for worldwide healthcare systems and represent a considerable threat to patient safety, leading to adverse clinical outcomes. A defined panel of indicators represents a key element to guide Healthcare Organizations towards identification of main gaps, implementation of effective actions and continuous improvements on Healthcare-Associated Infections prevention and control activities. A review on accreditation systems conducted by the Italian Study Group of Hospital Hygiene of the Italian Society of Hygiene Preventive Medicine and Public Health revealed a substantial heterogeneity of implemented standards and led to the development of a core set of indicators and requirements for Healthcare-Associated Infections' prevention and control within the hospital setting. The main aim of the study was to test the feasibility of the Healthcare-Associated Infections' prevention and control within the hospital setting tool to calculate performance scores on a sample of Italian Healthcare Organizations and to identify major critical issues. The potential benefits of the possibility of future implementation of the tool within Institutional Accreditation Programs is discussed. Study design: Cross sectional pilot survey. Methods: The Healthcare-Associated Infections' prevention and control within the hospital setting included 96 criteria and 20 key areas including an area for outcomes indicators. For applicable criteria, standards fulfilment was evaluated according to a 4 point Likert scale. A composite score was calculated for each Healthcare Organization and five performance levels were identified. Data were further analysed by computing performance scores at the level of each area and requirement. Results: 20 Healthcare Organizations agreed to take part in this pilot study including two rehabilitative Healthcare Organizations. Among the whole sample a mean of 12.20% of requirements resulted not fulfilled, leaving space for further improvements. Critical areas were easily identified and the instrument was able to capture substantial differences between Healthcare Organizations. Only a few number of standards resulted \"Not Applicable\" (Mean = 4.71%) and most of them regarded Rehabilitative Healthcare Organizations. Mean composite performance index resulted 74.06% (SD = 16.96, range 36.30 - 94.27%); area of outcome indicators obtained a mean score of 56.17. Conclusion: The Healthcare-Associated Infections' prevention and control within the hospital setting resulted an useful tool to assess Healthcare Organizations' performance in the field of Healthcare-Associated Infections prevention and control and to identify necessary actions for further improvements. The distribution of total scores by Healthcare Organizations showed a high heterogeneity. Implementation of the Healthcare-Associated Infections' prevention and control within the hospital setting tool as an institutional accreditation tool may help to drive the required harmonization at a national level of Healthcare-Associated Infections management and control strategies and overcome current substantial regional differences.\n\nBackground: Hand hygiene is the primary preventive measure against health care-associated infections in terms of cost-effectiveness. In 2005, the WHO proposed the \"Global Patient Safety Challenge\" campaign, with the aim of reducing the overall incidence of such infections, through multimodal programs and strategies, interactive training tools and standardised methods for monitoring compliance. Study design: On the basis of project \"Rimani\", sponsored by the Health and Social Care Authority of Emilia-Romagna, the Istituto Ortopedico Gaetano Pini has implemented a project which seeks to increase healthcare staff's compliance with hand hygiene. Methods: A multidisciplinary working group was created to prepare the project documents. Starting from 5th April 2015, twenty operational units were asked to produce information and training material. On 5th May, during a conference, a committee selected the three best works. The material was distributed on a monthly basis to the various departments. In addition to the training, the specifically trained operators of the Medical Monitoring Department carried out direct hand washing tests, filling out appropriate checklists. Non-compliance relating to the technique recorded in 2014 and 2015 was compared and a statistical analysis was conducted using Student's t-test for paired data. Results: Three tests were carried out in 2014. Ninety-nine cases were monitored and 5 non-compliance cases were reported, concerning the execution of the procedural steps, the running time and closing the tap with one's hands at the end of the wash. In 2015 two tests, involving 30 operational units, were carried out. 60 observations were performed, and no non-conformities emerged concerning the technique. Statistical analysis showed a significant reduction of non-compliances between the 2014 and 2015 P = 0.000). Conclusion: The results obtained agree with the main findings in literature. The comparison between the 2014 and 2015 tests shows a trend of improvement in the wash technique. This confirms the effectiveness of a multidisciplinary approach and recognises the active and participatory involvement suggested by the WHO.\n\nBackground. Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are an important issue in terms of quality of care. HAIs impact patient safety by contributing to higher rates of preventable mortality and prolonged hospitalizations. In Italy, analysis of the currently available accreditation systems shows a substantial heterogeneity of approaches for the prevention and surveillance of HAIs in hospitals. The aim of the present study is to develop and propose the use of a synthetic assessment tool that could be implemented homogenously throughout the nation. Methods. An analysis of nine international and of the 21 Italian regional accreditation systems was conducted in order to identify requirements and indicators implemented for HAI prevention and control. Two relevant reviews on this topic were further analyzed to identify additional evidence-based criteria. The project team evaluated all the requirements and indicators with consensus meeting methodology, then those applicable to the Italian context were grouped into a set of “focus areas”. Results. The analysis of international systems and Italian regional accreditation manuals led to the identification respectively of 19 and 14 main requirements, with relevant heterogeneity in their application. Additional evidence-based criteria were included from the reviews analysis. From the consensus among the project team members all the standards were compared and 20 different thematic areas were identified, with a total of 96 requirements and indicators for preventing and monitoring HAIs. Conclusions. The study reveals a great heterogeneity in the definition of accreditation criteria between the Italian regions. The introduction of a uniform, synthetic assessment instrument, based on the review of national and international standards, may serve as a self-assessment tool to evaluate the achievement of a minimum standards set for HAIs prevention and control in healthcare facilities. This may be used as an assessment tool by the Italian institutional accreditation system, also useful to reduce regional disparities."
