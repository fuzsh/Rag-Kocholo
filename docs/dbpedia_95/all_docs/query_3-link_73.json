        "text": "After innumerable difficulties of every kind, finally, today I can say that the historical picture of Serradifalco, from its origin to our day, is completed in all its essential parts.\n\nThe work has been long, but the satisfaction remains of having contributed by placing one small pebble into the structure of the knowledge of this Town.\n\nFrom it, other searches will be able to spring, other relations, in order to uncover, as years pass, a more and more complete picture.\n\nThe difficulties began at the start: to put order to many, varied and isolated items, and to propose a serious, scientific, sure vision, based only and exclusively on documentation: from the real property and feudal fiefs (the Moncada, Graffeo, Lo Faso) to several social, economic, religious, and political events, happening over the course of three and a half centuries, imbedded in the Sicilian panorama, and on that vaster national and European stage.\n\nMy greater satisfaction comes from having received as never before a sensitive, careful, spontaneous and cordial collaboration from so many Serrafalcan citizens, agencies, institutions, and associations, that it is very difficult to list them all.\n\nBut I cannot do less than to list in this long directory Mayor prof. Michele Territo with all the Councilmen, who have put their confidence in me, to see an ancient aspiration realized; the Communal Secretary geom. Vincenzo Mazzara and all the Employees of the Municipal Offices; the archpriest Galante; the directors of the Institute of San Giuseppe and the College of Maria; the Gentlemen Salvatore Petix, Agostino Aquilina , Camilla Licalsi, Filippo Genco ...\n\nMoreover, Dr. Claudio Torrisi with the Civil employees and Employees of the Archives of State of Caltanissetta; The Employees of the Archives of State of Palermo, of the Communal Libraries of Caltanissetta and Palermo; of the Library of the Sicilian Region, Palermo; of the Diocesan Administration of Agrigento; prof. Rosa Scaglione Guccione, General Secretary, and prof. Massimo Ganci, President of the Sicilian Society for the History of Birthplace Palermo; Dr. the Grazi Fallico Burgarella, Supervisor of the Archives of State of Sicily; the Gentlemen Franco Sedia and Orazio Rotondo of the Papal chancery of the Civil Court of Caltanissetta ...\n\nAnd finally, I must complete this list with my Wife, and my sons Claudio and Ivano. Without their collaboration I would have never carried this history to fulfillment.\n\nCampofranco, November 1990\n\nG. T.\n\n13\n\narchaelogy is not confused with the supernatural, and where ancient and remote reality is confirmed by visible and infallible documentation.\n\nOur voyage takes us to the research of royalty, and of the historical record of the town, and not to the head of water but elsewhere, in the footsteps of a great researcher, Antonio Salinas, who in 1883 wrote thusly in his Archaeological Excursions in Sicily, regarding our village:\n\nOn this road from Serradifalco leading to the sulfur mine of Grotta dacqua (the Grotto of water), before joining with the Zagaredda casina, are seen crypts and ruined sepulchral chambers, also containing crypts.2\n\nAnd that is the lone testimony, unfortunately, of a remote epoch, immeasurable, suffused in mystery and wrapped in a haze.\n\nBiagio Pace wrote no more, in his work Art and Civilization of Ancient Sicily; he repeated the information, without any addition:  the indicated crypts near Serradifalco not far from the sulfur mine of Grotta dacqua (from feudal times) are from the Christian epoch3. [English editors note: Pace appears to be wrong; some of the tombs are from prehistoric Siculan or Sicanian times.]\n\nDomenico Lo Faso himself, Duke of Serradifalco, the great archaeologist, writer and author of various scientific works, from whom we expected some specific and interesting words, reports not a single recollection of the land and the feudal fief of his ancestors.\n\nOnly in 1917, Siculus (who was most certainly Salvatore Raccuglia) made a thorough investigation and a detailed description, which was published in SICANIA, with many notes revised in March of that year, and begins in this way4;\n\nSiculan sites in Sicily.\n\nGrotta dAcqua\n\nWhen leaving Caltanissetta by rail towards Canicatti, between San Cataldo and Serradifalco, and exactly midway between the first and second tunnel, a little beyond signal box 143, on the vista to the left you see a group of houses, on the flank of a small stream, and standing above them a small mountain falling almost vertically, and whose face is all spread with holes, some rectangular, like glass windows, others semicircular, more or less widened, like the mouths of ovens, excavated in the rock.\n\nThe place is called the Cave of Water after a natural grotto from which issues a spring that is\n\n2\n\nANTONINO SALINAS, Escursione Archeologiche in Sicilia, A.S.S., VII, 1883, fasc.

They resemble tombs of the second age of the Siculans, prominent in 800 BC, at the time of the first population of Sicily, by Siculans or Sicanians.\n\nAt the lower slopes of the mountain are two larger caves, one called the Cave of the Fates, the other with traces of crypts, by now ruined, that bring to mind a small catacomb.\n\nThere is nothing to say what was the history of the village, which built the necropolis, and every trace is lost, even its name of old.\n\nArchaeologists, writers, historians, geographers, all ignore the ancient epoch of these caves. Neither is there anyone who speaks of the other feudal fiefs or of the territory of Serradifalco.\n\nRodano, who was well informed on the antique works of Gela, Butera, Mazzarino, Sutera, Riesi and Pietraperzia, modern cities born in the ancient epoch with the names of Terranova, of Omphace, Mactorion, Sotjr, Altariba and Caulonia, doesnt even wink at Serradifalco in his work5.\n\nNor are records or information brought out by Amico or Villabianca, even up to todays Ernesto De Miro, in his singular Archaeology of the Nissene, or Vincezo La Rosa\n\nWe have gone to the Government Department responsible for archaeological excavations in Agrigento, but among the numerous reports, which consider excavations of Butera, Mussomeli, Santa Caterina, Milena, Monte Desusino, and Costa di Mandorle, there does not exist one report with the name of our village.\n\nIt is rumored, as often happens in Sicilian villages rich in history, of fortuitous archaeological finds in the surrounding territory. But if they havent been discovered officially and excavated by the Government Department, a face will not be able to be given to the shadows, nor will they be changed to firm declarations.\n\n5 LEONARDO RODANO, Sulle città che furano nella Provincia di Caltanissetta, Caltanissetta, 1859.\n\n5 L\n\nEONARDO RODANO, On the Cities that existed in the Province of Caltanissetta, Caltanissetta, 1859.\n\nthe jurisdiction of the Earldom of Caltanissetta, but he did not know when. Like the rest, Arnico9 wrote: -- I dont know in which year it passed to the Earldom of Caltanissetta.\n\nSerradifalco, Salacio, Grotta dellacqua, Tarbuna, and Salina, as well as Naro, Sutera, Mussomeli, Delia, Fontanafredda and other lands in the valley of Mazzara, along with the seigniories of Caccamo and Gagliano, comprised the jurisdiction of the Earldom of Caltanisetta, rich with acres and square miles of land, and dominions with flocks and pastures in a jumble of confused and contradictory records.\n\nThen, little by little, slowly, names and designations come out; of districts, of territories, of parcels of land, and farms and estates, on which civil and criminal jurisdictions begin, and where Baronial Law is imposed.\n\nOn March 20 1296 his Serene Highness King Frederic II of Aragon, on the day of his coronation, among many Countships created on that happy occasion, granted the title of Count of Caltanissetta to Pietro Lanza, grandson of the Chief Justice of the Kingdom. In 1396, Eleanor of Aragon, descendant of Lanza, was invested as Countess.\n\nIn 1405, Caltanissetta and its vast territory were owned by the Regio Demanio [Royal Domain].\n\nSoon thereafter, King Martin granted those territories to Sanchio Roiz of Lihori, Grand Admiral of the Kingdom, who, on June 25 1407, in exchange for the city and lands of Augusta, gave them to Matteo Alagona-MoncadaA II, with their jurisdiction to him and his heirs in perpetuity.\n\nGuglielmo Alagona-Moncada was the first Count of the territories, along with the seigniories of Pietrarossa, Salinas, the Land of Cammarata, and the fiefs of Pietra dAmico and Motta SantAgata, Castronovo . . . .\n\nThere followed a series of Moncadas: Matteo, Guglielmo, Antonio, and Giovanni Tommaso; and the Land often passed from the hands of one to another with quarrels, inheritances, transactions, etc. And these conflicts are not surprising, because the Moncadas were one of the most powerful Families of the Kingdom of Sicily.\n\n9\n\nVITO AMICO, Dizionario topografico della Sicilia, tradotto dal latino ed annotato da Gioacchino Di Marzo, chierico distinto della Real Cappella Palatina, Palermo, 1856, due volumi, pag. 496.\n\n10 FRANCESCO MARIA EMANUELE e GAETANI, MARCHESE Di VILLABIANCA (d'ora in poi solo VILLABIANCA), Della Sicilia Nobile, Palermo, 1759, pag. 81;\n\nGIOVANNI MULE BERTOLO, Caltanissetta nei tempi che furono e nei tempi che sono, Caltanissetta, 1906, pag. 183.\n\n9 V\n\nITO AMICO, Topographic dictionary of Sicily, translated from the Latin and annotated by Gioacchino Di Marzo, distinguished clerk of the Royal Palatine Chapel, Palermo, 1856, two volumes, p. 496.\n\n10 FRANCESCO MARIA GAETANI-EMANUELE, MARQUIS of VILLABIANCA (now and then simply VILLABIANCA), Of Noble Sicily, Palermo, 1759, p. 81;\n\nGIOVANNI MULE BERTOLO, Caltanissetta in the times that were and in the times that are, Caltanissetta, 1906, p. 183.A [The Italian naming convention, especially for nobles, is to give the father's surname first, followed by \"and (mother's surname)\", thus Matteo, whose mother's surname was Alagona and whose father's was Moncada, would be Matteo Moncada ed Alagona. In translating, I have used the English convention of giving the mother's surname first in a hyphenated surname for the child.] 27\n\nJust think of it, writes Alfredo Li Vecchi, that half the island [of Sicily]was under that dominion. In western Sicily, one Seigniory was made up of Palermo, Biancavilla, Adernò, and other minor centers; in eastern Sicily, one domain began with the Earldom of Collesano and extended with a band of unending land and fiefs all the way to Caltanissetta.\n\nFamily of ancient nobility, honored by supreme assignments, rich with great states, with seigniories inferior to no one. It recalled the time of Charlemagne11.\n\nCourageous, valorous in war, on their family crest they had a black lion with red pickets around it in a field of gold. It was changed when, in the war against the Moors, during a scarcity of provisions a Guglielmo Raimondo [the First, of the Moncada House] brought seven loaves of bread to King Giacomo of Aragon. The Sovereign gave six to his Barons, and divided one with Moncada. Since then the new coat of arms comprised seven golden loaves, six whole and sound, and one divided in two, on a field of red12.\n\nIn 1470 it is said that the Earldom of Caltanissetta was invested in Giovanni Tommaso Moncada, who was the son of Count Guglielmo Raimondo and Giovanna Sanseverino. He was a masterful man, a lover of fine literature, who took Raimondetta Ventimiglia for his wife. He was President of the Kingdom in 1475, Chief Justice of Sicily and Grand Chamberlain of the Kingdom of Naples13. He died on June 1, 1501.\n\nAnd with Giovanni Tommaso Moncada, Gentleman of the Parliament of King Giovanni, Governor General of arms in the city of Agosta, Viceroy, Grand Chamberlain of the Kingdom, Grand Chief Justice, Lord of his noble House and Count of Caltanissetta, begins the official story of the Land of the Mountain of the Hawk, in the dominion and jurisdiction of the Earldom of Caltanissetta.\n\nSerra di Falco was a fief of Tommaso of Moncada, from whom it was transferred, writes Villabianca14.

His need for funds, continual and impelling, forced him to sell them to Giovanni Luigi di Settimo21, doctor of law, always with the same right of re-purchase.\n\nBut only the fief of Serra del Falco, detached from the original group of three, was sold to Antonino La Rocca, a member of the Aragon and Catalan House of Nobles, descended in Sicily since 130022.\n\nAt first, our feudal lords were without holdings, but they acquired one fief after another, in order to have a noble title.\n\nMeanwhile Guglielmo Raimondo Moncada, who had sold our fief, was succeeded by Antonio Moncada-Moncada, Francesco Moncada de Luna (who redeemed the fief of Serra del Falco), Cesare, and then Francesco and Antonio. This last Antonio Moncada-Aragona, born in 1591, was a Grandee of Spain and husband of Giovanna Lacerda, daughter of the Duke of Medinaceli.

After the purchase he gave lands for lease42, while in other years he managed them with his brothers.\n\nAs we reported, already in the main fief, that of Serradifalco, there had accumulated over the years a manor farm, an aggregate of premises; with stables, warehouses, ditches, a group of houses with ovens, an olive oil-mill, and a flour mill, already associated with the governance of the County of Caltanissetta.\n\nAnd therefore we have found that our Baron and Lord Don Francesco had named, as his Procurator and Governor, Don Mario Frangiamore of Mussomeli; and in turn his brother Don Giovanni, the abbot, had named Don Alfonso Pardi as Procurator ad lites [concerning litigation], that is, defender of causes, to make arrests and imprisonments in the Barony of Serradifalco. And Frangiamore requested the Baron to conscript muleteers to transport wheat and barley from the fief to the Officer at Girgenti \"with diligence and effort\".\n\nAnd together with the Procurator came the Master of the arranteria, assigned to capture animals or slaves, and to deliver them to their respective masters and brand them (the arranteria was the destined enclosure for the safekeeping of animals).\n\nThus began the germ of a new town, in which the authority of the Baron and the Landlords was already manifest and active.\n\nGiovanni Graffeo, 20 Barone di Serradifalco\n\nDei due cugini, Francesco e Giovanni Graffeo, seguiamo il destino del se condo, non essendo interessati agli eredi del Principato di Gangi.\n\nGiovanni, per gli atti propter nuptias del 30 agosto 1634, era stato nominato erede universale nei beni e nella Baronia di Serradifalco, dallo zio43.\n\nGiovanni Graffeo, 2nd Baron of Serradifalco\n\nOf the two cousins, Francesco and Giovanni Graffeo, we follow the destiny of the second, not being interested in the heirs of the Principality of Gangi.

But time slides by, and there seems to approach a new dawn, which lifts the gloom and the shadows of anonymity, and lets us feel the pulsation of the organized life of men and their deeds, happy or sad.\n\nBaron Francesco Graffeo and Prince Antonio Moncada had already died. In our Barony the bondholders and ancient creditors of Moncada intend to be paid for old debts. They mean to make a deal with his successor, his son Luigi, who, not unlike his father, swims in a sea of debt, even if he is cloaked with the prestigious title of President of the Realm45.\n\nGiovanni Graffeo, who contrary to his uncle, remains only the Baron of Serradifalco, and does not possess other noble titles, intends to close a definitive purchase with Moncada, for the lands of Serradifalco, in order to avoid one day finding himself without title and without land. He lets it be known that he is disposed to acquire \"the right of repurchase\" (the jus luendi), for redeeming the Barony46.\n\nSome time later comes the stipulated bill of sale of the right of repurchase, on 10 September 163747.\n\n44 ASPA, Conservatory of Registers, vol. 1140: Investitures pp. 121 and 122.\n\n45 It was generated by Lieutenant Ferdinand Afan de Ribera, Duke of Alcalà, who succeeded to President of the Realm from 1637 to 1647, nine years in which he rendered the roads of the island secure, and enriched Palermo with civic works. Under his government the head tax was instituted. The Sicilians were grouped in two classes: those who had unearned income and those that earned wages. The former had to pay the amount their assets yielded in a day; the latter a days earnings. In 1647 he was named the Viceroy of Sardinia, then he embraced the ecclesiastical life. Information from GIOVANNI EVANGELISTA DI BLASI, Chronological History of the Viceroys, Lieutenants and Presidents of the Realm of Sicily, vol. 30, Palermo, 1974, p. 104.\n\nAt this time, around 1635, Don Luigi Moncada promotes the construction in Caltanissetta, in the quarter of Saint Venera, of the Moncada Palace, interrupted in 1638, on the hill of the noble square (architect Brother Peter from Genoa). Today, after a period of degradation, this palace is about to be restored, being the most important architectural monument of the city.\n\nArch.

In order to avoid the distractions which the creditors had begun, action was taken to sell to Don Giovanni Graffeo... the right to repurchase the Barony, which he had reserved in the contract of sale of 6 June 1617».\n\nASPA, Notary GIACINTO CINQUEMANI of Palermo, Contract of sale in ASPP, vol. 32, to p. I. «Purchase of the Barony of Serradifalco and its fiefs of Lo Salacio and Grotta dacqua, the commune of Falbaccaro, and the Casalotto [compound] and surroundings of its capital».\n\n46\n\nThe experts had also measured public tracts (6 salme and 8 tumuli of land) which, calculated at 18 ounces to every aratata, and by reason of 4.17 ounces per hundred, results in the entire price of the entire Barony of 28,127.29 ounces. Of which, deducting the 19,737 ounces credited to Graffeo in compensation of the contract of sale of 1617, there remained 8,390.29 ounces, to which was added the 400 ounces extra promised by Graffeo, which therefore left a debt of 8,790 ounces and 29 tari for the entire fulfillment of the price of the Barony.\n\nThe three fiefs were sold with jus luendi, with the title of Baron, civil and criminal jurisdiction, and all the other rights and pertinencies, as had been done with the act of the Imperial Notary public of 6 June 1617.\n\nOn 8 January 1638 the assessment of the experts was ratified, and Giovanni Graffeo deposited the sum of 8,000 ounces to the Duke of Montalto, and for him, to several of his affected creditors, as can be noted from various entries by the Notary Cinquemani, and from which creditors the new Baron obtained cessions of rights and bonds.\n\nThe Land was finally free from creditors of every kind.\n\nUnfortunately, in spite of the sale of the land of Serradifalco, the state of debt of Moncada was not resolved. The King came to an agreement with him that his States would be placed in privileged deputation, separate from the Deputation of States51.\n\nThe prodigal and garish nobility thoughtlessly consumed the rich patrimony with various festivities, costumes, and annuities.\n\nIn 1639 the Graffeo family, due to other small debts, still had credit on its assets and States, by the Prince of Paternò52.\n\n\"Ma mentre Cartagine piange, Roma non ride.\"\n\nBut while Carthage cries, Rome does not laugh.\n\nThis situation of uneasiness, which was becoming difficult for many Barons, does not spare our Graffeo family, which does not succeed in extracting its credit from other feudatories.\n\nThe activity in the Land of Serradifalco demanded the involvement of the Baron to arrange a series of initiatives in order to organize the growing casalotto [compound?]. And in order \"per fare rispettare le leggi ingabella a Filippo d'Amico, un malandrino palermitano originario di Mussomeli, la baglia della Baronia\" to impose respect for laws and [duties?] on Filippo d'Amico, a rogue from Palermo, originally from Mussomeli, the [winery?] of the Barony.\n\n51 La Deputazione degli Stati era stata costituita nel 1600 con lo scopo di amministrare i patri moni indebitati, liberarli da pesi, obbligando i proprietari a forti risparmi.\n\nAl Moncada vennero annualmente concesse 4000 onze per alimenti, e 2000 per spese processuali; nel 1644 la somma complessiva venne elevata a 8000 onze. Ma era stato venduto un altro feudo, di Castellammare, il cui ricavato di onze 5000 era servito per pagare parte di altri debiti.\n\nTRICOLI, La Deputazione, cit., pag. 86, 278; MARRONE, Bivona, cit., pag. 287.\n\n52 TRICOLI, La Deputazione, cit., pag. 278 284.\n\n51 The Deputation of States was established in 1600 with the charge of administering indebted patrimonies, freeing them from debt and obligating the owners, by force, to save them.\n\nTo the Moncadas went annual grants of 4,000 ounces for supplies, and 2,000 for legal expenses; in 1644 the total sum was elevated to 8,000 ounces. But another fief, of Castellammare, had been sold, and the profit of 5,000 ounces was taken in order to pay part of their other debts.\n\nTRICOLI, The Deputation, cit., pp. 86, 278; MARRONE, Bivona, cit., p. 287.\n\n52 TRICOLI, The Deputation, cit., p. 278 284.\n\n48\n\nAlready incidents have erupted over civil and criminal jurisdiction, with the Officials of the Land of Caltanissetta, who have had disagreements with the Customsmaster of Serradifalco, the miller of the mill at Grotta dellacqua, and townspeople and debtors, over their boundary walls. And Graffeo writes to Moncada of Paternò, reminding him that the land had been sold with mero e misto imperio [jurisdiction over life and death] and that their [Paternòs] magistrates could not impose themselves on its affairs53.\n\nNow, insists the Baron, once and for all, order must be imposed. Therefore, he pleads that the Prince of Paternò will send letters to all the civil functionaries of Caltanissetta and his other States \"not to impose themselves in matters of the jurisdiction of said Barony [Serradifalco] and its fiefs, nor to upset, nor to disturb, our quiet and peaceful property\". (We point out that by 1638 the Customshouse of Serradifalco was already operating, and the mill of Grotta dellacqua was functioning).\n\nThis memorandum is answered by Donna Maria, Princess of Paternò, pacifying Graffeo, and sending letters to the Superior Court of Montalto on 5 October 163854.\n\n53 ASPP, vol. 38, f. 1 e volume A f. 401; f. 371.\n\n«Mernoriale avanzato da D.

Giovanni Graffeo, del 5 ottobre VII 1638.\n\nAvvennero altri contrasti ancora, ma due anni dopo Giuseppe La Voglia, gabelloto dello Stato di Ser radifalco, biasimava gli «impratichi ministri di Caltanissetta», ignari della formazione di una nuova baronia detta di Serradifalco, vicina alla Contea di Caltanissetta, indipendente, che possiede la sua giurisdizione, che ha le sue leggi sotto i Graffeo.\n\n1 Una volta la Terra era gravata al tempo dei Moncada di innumerevoli soggiogazioni, e continua La Voglia, «con queste notizie che si conoscono in tutto il Regno, è difficile trovare borgesi inquilini ed altre persone necessarie per il seminerio, con grande danno per Serradifalco e per Sua Cattolica Maestà e per il beneficio pubblico specie in questi tempi sterili e calamitosi».\n\nChiese perciò ancora Lettere di salvaguardia in ampia forma per avere necessarie cautele. La Regia Gran Corte concesse le Lettere richieste, ordinando:\n\n«Non habbiate né dobbiate molestare\n\ndurante lo tempo della gabella\n\nné permettere siano pacto aliquo molestati inquietati né perturbati in beni né in persone esso esponente, soi inquilini herbaggeri, terraggeri, gabelloti, subgabelloti, conductori, detentori, pos sessori, et altri di dette baronie presenti et futuri».\n\nNon lo potevano disturbare Regia Gran Corte, né Città ed Università del Regno, né il Mastro Secreto o il Maestro Portulano, i Monti di Pietà, vedove, vergini, pupilli, orfani, persone miserabili, lochi pii, ed altri qualsivoglia persona... Insomma, era in una botte di ferro!\n\nLe Lettere erano anche dirette al Presidente dei Tribunale della SS. Inquisizione di Girgenti ed alla Curia Spirituale di Serradifalco.\n\nASPP, Volume A, f. 387, «Lettere di salvaguardia per lo Stato di Serradifalco, a favore di Giuseppe La Voglia», del 26 novembre 1640.

The Royal Supreme Court granted the Letters demanded, ordering:\n\n\"You must not harass during the time of the excise tax, nor allow, pacto aliquo, to be harassed , worried nor disturbed in their holdings neither in person or through their representatives, whether they are renters of fields or land, overseers, sub-overseers, transporters, jailers, owners, or others of said present and future baronies\".\n\nNeither the Royal Supreme Court, nor the City and University of the Realm, nor the Customsmaster or Harbormaster, nor the devout Bastions of the Church could disturb Serradifalcos widows, virgins, pupils, orphans, wretches, local holy men, or any other person ... In short, it was as secure as an iron cask! The Letters also were directed to the President of the Court of the Most Holy Inquisition of Girgenti and to the Spiritual Curia of Serradifalco.\n\nASPP, Volume A, p. 387, \"Letters of safeguard for the State of Serradifalco, in favor of Giuseppe La Voglia\", of 26 November 1640. Others in the same volume at p. 379, of 3 December 1640.\n\n49\n\nWithout warning, or nearly so, Don Giovanni Graffeo, made an act of donation on 11 November 1640 of the Barony of Serradifalco to his son the minor Francesco, approximately five years old, born from his union with Antonina Sarzana-Ventimiglia, and to his heirs and successors55: \"the Barony called Serradifalco, the Barony called Lo Salacio and the Barony named Grotta dellacqua, with lands of Falbaccaro, with their borders, laws and pertinencies, civil and criminal jurisdiction, power of the sword, indebted for a unit of armed cavalry for royal military service, and also with the right of jus luendi, the right of repurchase, and already operating in the acquired land\".\n\nReserved was the right and the ability to revocate the entire donation before dying, \"if he should want to or like to\".\n\nTherefore he creates an administator and governess of Francesco, his son and heir, with broad and free powers; not his wife Donna Antonina, but the mother of his wife, his mother-in-law and grandmother of little Francesco, Donna Maria Sarzana-Ventimiglia, widow of Federico Ventìmiglia, with wide freedom to act in the government and the administration of the Barony, excise taxes, rights, returns, proceeds and emoluments, declaring her free to name one or more proxies until Francesco reaches the age of 18 years \"and not otherwise\".\n\nHe declares all this under oath, in front of the four figures of the Evangelists and by the hand of the Notary public. He declares to have already advanced to the Royal Court, long ago, the demand for the ability to found and to inhabit a new Land in the above-named fiefs, and that such ability transfers and transmits to his son, for him and his heirs to infinity; meaning therefore to support a new request that will put forward the name of his firstborn son Francesco Ventimiglia-Graffeo and have the appeal from his grandmother, his procurator and administrator, turned over to the Court of the Royal Patrimony.\n\n55 Donatio pro D.

A, f. 381, all'11 novembre IX 1640.\n\n50\n\nAt that time pirates infested the coasts of the mezzogiorno [southern Italy and Sicily], Garufi writes further, and famines followed one another with fearsome frequency. Filippo IV, after having transferred the private goods of the crown, and bartered fiefs and titles, in 1638 requested another two million from his donors and in the next year introduced two new taxes: those on printed paper and on contracts of exchange, etc.\n\nPoverty became ever more threatening, but especially, as you can imagine, a time of the most abject political decadence, financial and economic, and of a major depression. Sicily, the conquered land, was prostrated by epidemics and overloaded with taxes.\n\nIn October 1636 the Viceroy, the Duke of Montalto and Prince of Paternò, wishing to revive agriculture, restricted by laws which tended to centralize the estates in the hands of the Barons, issued instructions about planting crops aimed at giving aid to the villagers.\n\nIn 1639 the new Viceroy, the Count of Assumar, renewed the circular and pressed the feudatories to cultivate grain in their vast domains, and to give aid to the townspeople dedicated to planting crops. An agrarian policy made out of words.\n\nThe Barons, owners of diverse fiefs, thought to increase their income by making their lands productive, but this could arise only with the presence and the participation of many colonists.\n\nTo do this it was necessary to assemble as many people as possible, offer them certain things, terms, gratuities, giving them the opportunity to lease with low rent lands and vineyards or or rural fields, offering plots to build homes or even putting at their disposal houses already built.\n\nFor our Land of Serradifalco, it was enough to develop the street plan, to which no thought had ever been previously given, to ask the Treasury permission to establish, or to give official recognition, to the Land that was abandoned until then.\n\nAnd also for the Viceroys, who asked for gifts to the realm, and imposed them at every moment, it was easy to tax the Permits for incorporation. With time, the tax receivers found the opportunity to open this new font of resources for their stressed finances, always increasing the compensation required for granting Permits.\n\n56\n\nWe know that 100 ounces were paid for the Permit for Altamira, 120 for Borgetto and Montedoro, and that 400 of gold were paid for Alimena and Palma di Montechiaro.\n\nAt that time, a new era began for Sicily, with possibly the most intensive demographic movement encountered in the modern history of the island.\n\nIn the first years of the age, it even can be said that no time passed that did not see the birth of a new Università (that is, town, borough, or village). More than 80 were established during the seventeenth century, and to every new Land that rose came new colonists, impoverishing old centers and cities of the domain or ancient Baronial Lands, which had been thought to last forever.\n\nThe List of Permits to Populate agreed to by the Feudatories of Sicily during the Seventeenth Century, compiled by Giuseppe Cosentino58, comprise 67 Permits of which that of the 1st of April 1602 was given to Vincenzo Spucches for the Land of Clarastella, later called Molinazzo, and on 18 December 1699 to Gaspare La Grutta for the establishment of Roccella, later Campofelice.\n\nHis notes and observations seem to me to be the most complete of the lot. Our greatest interest is in the group of Towns near Serradifalco, in the province of Caltanissetta itself:\n\nFeudatario data della Nome del Nome della Licenza feudo nuova Terra Giulio Grimaldi 28 gennaio 1604 Risiaia e Monaco S.

It was required to address the Sovereign, who would decide after requesting information from the authorities of the island59.\n\nThen the Permit was presented to the Viceroy or to the President of the Realm to be executed. A long and complicated procedure. It was a time in which the habit was to make the request of the Viceroy, who directly issued the Permit.\n\nMany feudatories in the land had chosen this custom.\n\nBaroness Maria Sarzana-Ventimiglia60, the procurator and tutor of Francesco Ventimiglia-Graffeo, wrote to the Viceroy. She made it known that Don Francesco was her grandchild, Baron of Serradifalco, Salacio and Grotta d'acqua and other territories, those bequests from his father, Don Giovanni Graffeo, in virtue of the acts of Notary Musanti of 11 November 1640; that she had already made a request for the original Permit to populate to the Royal Court, which was being delayed; that the princely fief of Serradifalco was distant from habitation, and because of this solitude was infested with brigands; that the land was rich with waters, fecund with grain, and unfortunately remained uncultivated because of the absence of serfs.\n\n59 Erano le famose Lettere locis convicinis a Secrezie e Giurati dei luoghi vicini che, temendo la migrazione dei loro vassalli per le nuove terre, e quindi la diminuzione delle proprie risorse, avan zavano quasi sempre difficoltà e frapponevano ostacoli. Anche se queste difficoltà si superavano... col denaro.\n\n60 Il personaggio di Donna Maria Ventimiglia e Sarzana, vedova del fu D. Federico di Ventimi glia, è difficile collocarlo nella storia complessa dei Ventimiglia. La Famiglia era nobilissima ed anti chissima, traeva origine da Clodoveo, re di Francia, nell'anno 480, si era diramata in tutta Europa. Il ramo siciliano prendeva origine da un Normanno discendente da Ruggero Guiscardo, ricco di do mini e terre e signorie nelle Madonie.\n\nVedi ANTONIO MOGAVERO FINA, I Ventimiglia, Conti di Geraci e Conti di Collesano, Baroni di Grat teri e Principi di Belmonte, Palermo 1980; Idem, Profflo storico dei Ventimiglia, Signori delle Mado nie, Principi di Belmonte, Palermo, 1973; MUGNOS, Teatro, cit., vol. III, f. 513; SAVASTA, Il famoso Caso, cit.\n\n59 There were the famous Lettere locis convicinis to Treasurers and Judges of the neighboring localities, who, fearing the migration of their serfs to new lands, and therefore the lessening of their own resources, nearly always advanced difficulty and scattered obstacles. But even these difficulties were overcome ... with money.\n\n60 The person of Donna Maria Sarzana-Ventimiglia, widow of the late Don Federico di Ventimiglia, is difficult to place in the complex history of the Ventimiglia. The family was most noble and most ancient, its origins were from Clodoveo [Clovis, Louis], king of France, in the year 480, and it had branches throughout Europe. The Sicilian branch originated from a Norman descendent of Ruggero Guiscardo, rich of dominions, lands and lordships in Madonie.\n\nSee ANTONIO MOGAVERO FINA, The Ventimiglia, Counts of Geraci and Counts of Collesano, Barons of Gratteri and Princes of Belmonte, Palermo 1980; Idem, Historical Profile of the Ventimiglia, Lords of Madonie, Princes of Belmonte, Palermo, 1973; MUGNOS, The Theatre, cit., vol. III, p. 513; SAVASTA, The Famous Case, cit.\n\n58\n\nA new population would have to be subservient to the Royal Court for drafts (extraction of cereals) and to the convenience of the public. That year the Viceroy was Don Francesco de Mello di Braganza, Count of Assumar, who had left in Sicily in August 1640 Monsignor Pietro Corsetto, Bishop of Cefalù, as Governor of the Realm61. With due insistence on the Royal Court and the Tribunal of the Royal Patrimony, in less than a month, the Office of the Chief Notary of the Realm decreed to grant a Licence to populate \"jus populandi\", granting it to Don Francesco Graffeo, Baron of Serradifalco, represented by his administrator and governess, his grandmother Donna Maria Sarzana-Ventimiglia, on 6 December of 1640.\n\nFor the good of the realm the Governor conceded the power to the Baroness, and to the heirs and successors of young Francesco, to construct, erect, and gather residents for a new population center in one of the fiefs of her choice of the Barony, considering the altitude of the site and the quality of the wind, the convenience of forests, water and other necessities for building a new habitation.\n\nHe gave her the power to erect a tower, fort - fortified castle - and equipping it with walls, turrets and other necessities of fortification.\n\nIn the new Land, the Baron acquired every right to impose levies, duties, bail, rent, zàgato and any other fees, as the other Barons of the Realm did with their vassals.\n\nThe Permit thus issued, as can be seen, was all-encompassing, with no defect, and lacked nothing.\n\nHe empowered her also to name the Castlekeeper, the Jailer, the Captain of the Guard, the Judge and the other officials necessary, liked by and available to the Baron, with every honor and duty, usual and customary, held by the other Jurors, Judges, and Officials of the other Lands of the Realm. And finally, the right to elect, create, and ordain, and also to remove or re-appoint them as many times as seemed necessary by the Baron.\n\n61 Corsetto, born in 1577, was famous in Sicily in the legal Sciences, and by his merit he had been Pretorian Judge, Master of Logic, and President of the Consistory. In 1636 his wife had died and he had embraced ecclesiastics. In 1638 King Filippo had named him Bishop of Cefalù. He exercised the office of Governor in 1640, for one year, with zeal and prudence. Monsignor Corsetto died in 1643.\n\nDi BLASI, Viceroys, cit., vol. III, p. 119; GIUSEPPE M.

III.\n\n59\n\nThe Baroness had more license; to contract laws of the land, ordinances, statutes or other, with the new vassals.\n\nA copy of the Permit was sent to the Chief Justice, to the President of the Royal Court, to the Judges of the Royal Supreme Court, to the Masters of Logic, to the Treasurer and the Conservator of the Royal Patrimony, to the Fiscal Procurator and the other Officials of the Realm in order to have them adopt it, to execute and to observe under penalty of 1000 ducats to be paid to the Royal Treasury.\n\nDon Pietro Giovanni Guercio, Treasurer of the Royal Supreme Court, declared that in the name of and for Donna Maria Ventimiglia he had received the sum of 400 (four hundred) ounces in coin of the Realm for the permit received from the Tribunal of the Royal Patrimony permitting habitation of one of the fiefs of the Barony of Serradifalco situated and located in this Kingdom and in the Valley of Mazzara and in execution of the provision made on the 23rd of this last November in response to the memorandum of Donna Maria for the above solvendis uncias quatricenti habeat licentiam62.\n\nAn ordinary Permit, without particular favors or privileges, rights, or responsibility to populate the fief at a given time or in a given place.\n\nThe Littere locis convicinis are missing.\n\nNot even a slight mention was made of mero e misto imperio [power over life and death], since the fiefs were de membris of the State and appurtenances of the County of Caltanissetta, and on 6 June 1617 they had been sold by Antonio Moncada to Francesco Graffeo with jurisdiction civil and criminal, high and low, mero e misto imperio, with every power of the sword, privilege and otherwise, to the said fiefs appertaining to ... .\n\nIl nome della nuova Università\n\nIl nome comunemente veniva scelto dallo stesso feudatario ed indica to nella Licenza di popolare. Nel nostro caso non si fece alcun cenno spe cifico.\n\nDel resto c'era libertà. Molti Baroni sceglievano nomi di Santi (S. Ca terina, S. Ninfa, S. Cataldo); altri adottavano il cognome della rispettiva Famiglia (Lercara, da Francesco Lercaro, Lucca da Francesco Lucchese, Ventimiglia da Beatrice Ventimiglia, Altariva da Pietro Altariva).\n\nThe name of the new Community\n\nThe name commonly was chosen by the feudatory himself and indicated in the Permit to populate. In our case, no specific hint was given.\n\nFor the rest, there had been leeway. Many Barons chose the names of Saints (Santa Caterina, Santa Ninfa, San Cataldo); others adopted the surnames of the respective Family: (Lercara, by Francesco Lercaro, Lucca by Francesco Lucchese, Ventimiglia by Beatrice Ventimiglia, Altariva by Pietro Altariva).\n\n62 ASPP, volume A, p. 393, 5 December 1640.\n\n60\n\nMore than a few Lands kept the same names as the fiefs in which they were founded: Comitini, Baucina, and Calamonici. Our Land therefore could have called itself Salacia or Grotta dell'Acqua, or Graffea. It called itself Serradifalco after the fief of the same name, in which it rose.\n\nAttività\n\n.\n\nIniziava per il feudatario un periodo di grande ed intensa attività. Se voleva che la nuova Università fosse popolata e avesse fortuna c'e ra proprio da rimboccarsi le maniche e lavorare. Nessuno pensi che da quel giorno 6 dicembre, sotto Natale, due giorni prima della festa dell'Im macolata arrivassero mastri e muratori, camions e ruspe a sbancare col linette, aprire fondamenta ed innalzare edifici. In genere, l'abbiamo già detto, esisteva una masseria con il Palazzo del Barone, con i suoi magazzi ni, le fosse, alcune case per i soprastanti, altri catoi e dammusi per i con tadini, che venivano a lavorarvi e vi trascorrevano settimane, mesi o anni, lontani dalle famiglie e della vie di comunicazione.\n\nActivities\n\nThere began for the feudatory a period of great and intense activity. If they wished that the new Community would be populated and would have luck, they had to just roll up their sleeves and work. No one thought that on that day 6 December, before Christmas, two days before the feast of the Immaculate Virgin there would arrive master builders and masons, trucks and excavators to shape the hills, open foundations and raise edifices. As we have already said, there was a manor farm with the Palace of the Baron, with his warehouses, the moats, some houses for the superintendents, and other shacks and stone houses for the peasant farmers, who came to work and passed weeks, months or years far from their families and from any means of communication.\n\nIt was necessary to estimate the situation well and spontaneously, for the amenity of the place, the abundance of water, the fertility of the land and many other reasons, to create it years and decades before meeting its potential.\n\nThose attempting to establish a new Land, or the reasonable cultivation of a fief, did not always succeed. Often the lack of communications, the low fertility of soils, the insufficient facilities granted by the feudatories and the lack of water were reasons to decide to abandon the lands soon after inception. And the talk - rumors fly - circulated between colonists and vassals, in the markets and at the fairs.\n\nSoon after the act of approval, which Giovanni Graffeo had given to his to minor son Francesco, Donna Maria passed the action on, indenturing and obliging the Barony of Serradifalco to Giuseppe La Voglia, who had singular influence and prestige in the region, to impose law and discourage the usual rogues and raiders of the countryside, or bandits and gang members of the comune63.\n\n63 Anche tra le carte spesso è facile notare lo stato d'animo dei nostri personaggi. All'8 novem bre 1640 era già stato stipulato un atto in cui D. Giovanni Graffeo, barone, stipulava con D. Ignazio la gabella dello stato con Giulio Cesino. Questo atto fu cancellato. Il Barone Giovanni pensò che proprio da quell'atto di arrendamento potevano inziare le nuove attività a nome del figlio e della suocera, il nuovo gruppo dirigente. Fu cancellato, e ripetuto in seguito da Donna Maria Ventimiglia e Sarzana, a nome del nuovo Proprietario e Barone il giovane D. Francesco Graffeo.\n\nASPA, Atti Notaro MUSANTI, vol. 14528, f. 57.\n\n63 Also, from the papers, it is easy to see the state of mind of our personages. On 8 November 1640 there had already been stipulated an act in which Don Giovanni Graffeo, baron, arranged with Don Ignazio the indenture of the state to Giulio Cesino. This act was cancelled. Baron Giovanni thought that directly fom that act of rendering they could start the new activities in the name of the son and mother-in-law, the new management group. It was cancelled, and repeated in turn by Donna Maria Sarzana-Ventimiglia, in the name of the new Proprietor and Barone, the youth Don Francesco Graffeo.\n\nASPA, Notary Acts MUSANTI, vol. 14528, p 57.\n\n61\n\nLa Baronessa ed il Procuratore vennero quindi nel feudo a prendervi dimora, e seguire da vicino la costituzione della nuova Università. Già borgesi e contadini venivano in cerca di lavoro per periodi più o meno lunghi, bisognava ora creare condizioni ideali affinché molti vi fissassero stabile dimora, sino a suscitare una colonia fiorente di attività. La voce si sparse nei paesi vicini e jurnatari, misalori e annalori, provenienti da comuni di versi, cominciarono a prendere chiuse di terre, che avevano beverature, e ricche sorgenti di acqua. I Graffeo non concessero particolari agevola zioni. Nessun documento, per esempio, parla di terre comuni (fondi aperti nei quali la popolazione poteva cacciare, far legna, ecc.). Gli abitanti, è evidente, non godettero mai di usi civici cioè di diritti di condurre a pa scolare, legnare, estrarre gesso, calce, pietra, raccogliere olive, erbe, fra sche, lumache, funghi e così via, gratuitamente, senza obbligo di versare canoni né ai Graffeo né ai Lo Faso.\n\nThe Baroness-Procurator then came to the fief to take residence, and soon thereafter to develop the new Community nearby. Already, townspeople and peasant farmers had come in search of work for periods more or less lengthy, and now it was necessary to create ideal conditions so that many would build permanent dwellings, until they had developed a community flourishing with activities. The word was spread in nearby towns, and in journals, missals, and annals of various towns, and people began to enclose land that had drinking water and was rich with flowing streams. The Graffeos did not grant some specific activities. No document, for example, speaks of terre comuni (open areas in which the population could hunt, cut wood, etc.). The inhabitants, it is evident, never enjoyed the right to graze animals, cut wood, extract chalk, lime, or stone; to pick olives, herbs, berries, mushrooms and such things free of charge, neither from Graffeo nor from Lo Faso, without being obliged by various rules.\n\nNon ebbero obbligo di corrispondere angarie (prestazioni e servizi gra tuiti di lavoro ed opere), dovute in ragione di alcune giornate per anno, in cambio di protezione accordata dal Barone ai suoi vassalli, senza diritto a mercedi; né pèrangarie (gli stessi servizi forzati con mercede). Né di pagare ogni anno decime di prodotti o bestiame, come a Mezzojuso e Lercara, o prestare una giornata di lavoro al mese per i bisogni del Barone; o corrispondere ogni anno frumento e vari tarì, galline, o carichi di paglia e di legna, come a Campofranco e Casteltermini; o costruire stanze e letti per il feudatario come a Lercara, e portare acqua al servizio del Padrone e saldare la tassa della fascia per la nascita dei suoi figli64. «Ad oneri maggiori rispondono, scrive Garufi, diritti maggiori, ad oneri minori rispondono diritti minori».\n\nBut neither were the people obliged to give angarie (free labor), reasonably due for some number of days per year, in exchange for protection accorded by the Baron to his vassals, without entitling him to goods; nor pèrangarie (the same services, but including goods). Nor to pay every year one tenth of produce or livestock, as in Mezzojuso and Lercara, or spending a day of work per month for the needs of the Baron; or to pay every year with wheat and various taxes, poultry, or loads of straw and wood, as in Campofranco and Casteltermini; or building rooms and beds for the feudatory as in Lercara, and carrying water in the service of the Padrone and paying taxes for swaddling clothes at the birth of his children64. Greater privileges correspond to great duties writes Garufi, to lesser duties, lesser rights.\n\n64 Nel 1501 a Mezzojuso i vassalli pagavano un tarì per casa, la decima sui prodotti e gli anima li, un canone sulla terra, l'opera gratuita per riparare i mulini, una giornata di lavoro per ogni masi nata, il dono di una gallina o porcellino o agnello per ogni famiglia per festa di San Giovanni...\n\nA Campofranco e Casteltermini (1573 e 1625) 3 tarì per casa, per corredino o fascia del figlio del Barone, un carico di legna e uno di paglia, ogni anno fornire 2 galline, 2 capponi, 2 pollastre, 2 gallet ti e 2 piccioni...\n\nNei Capitoli di San Michele di Ganzaria decima per i cereali, 1 tarì e una gallina all'anno, preferenza nella vendita della roba del Barone...\n\nAltri balzelli in Aidone, Cefalù...\n\nVedi per tutti: GIUSEPPE TESTA, Il Principato di Campofranco nel feudo Fontana di li Rosi, Agri gento, 1973.\n\n64 In 1501 in Mezzojuso the vassals paid one tarì coin per house, one tenth of their produce and livestock, a rent on the land, free labor for repairing the mill, a day of work for every month, and a gift of one hen or lamb for every family for the feast of Saint John\n\nIn Campofranco and Casteltermini (1573 and 1625) 3 tarì per house, for supplies or swaddling clothes for the son of the Baron, a load of wood and one of straw, every year providing 2 hens, 2 capons, 2 chicks, 2 grouse and 2 pigeons...\n\nIn the Capital of San Michele di Ganzaria one tenth of the grains, 1 tarì and one hen per year, and preference to the Baron in the price of goods...\n\nOther unjust taxes in Aidone and Cefalù...\n\nFor a full account see: GIUSEPPE TESTA, The Principality of Campofranco in the fief Fountain of the Roses, Agrigento, 1973.\n\n62\n\n«Queste le massime fondamentali economiche che regolavano i rapporti fra feudatari e comunisti (abitanti del comune), secondo l'antica e sempre nuova legge economica dell'offerta e della ri chiesta»65.\n\nThese were the fundamental economic principles that regulated the relationship between the feudatories and the comunisti (inhabitants of the town); secondly the ancient but always new economic law of supply and demand65.\n\nSerradifalco, come Roccapalumba (per fare un esempio con l'opera del Garufi) fu meno oppresso di «gravezze feudali». I suoi vassalli non possedettero particolari diritti e privilegi (usi civici, terre promiscue, ecc.) di cui altrove borgesi e contadini godevano... in cambio di oneri maggiori. Così come furono disponibili a pagare un tarì per ogni famiglia per ogni suolo di casa66.\n\nSerradifalco, like Roccapalumba (to make an example from the work of Garufi) was less oppressed by the burdens of the feudal system. Its vassals did not have certain rights and privileges (civic uses, common tracts, etc.) which some other villagers and peasant farmers enjoyed... but in exchange for greater burdens. Therefore they were able to pay one tarì for every family, for every house lot66.\n\nSiamo in piena epoca feudale, ma Donna Maria Ventimiglia e Graffeo non costrinse con la forza a popolare i suoi feudi. Non abbiamo noti zie dì sorprusi o forza baronale. Pensò invece di tenere in economia i feudi e gabellarli, per migliorare la coltura; provvedere i lavoratori con una mag giore prestazione di servizi, dai soccorsi in natura per la terra agli animali da lavoro; concedere fondi rustici in enfiteusi a prezzi non onerosi; co struire case per i nuovi vassalli e darle loro in affitto; costruire la chiesa (dedicata a San Francesco di Paola) e chiamarvi fl cappellano, il curato che battezzassero i loro bambini nati nella nuova Terra, o benedicessero i matrimoni tra i primi venuti o seppellissero i loro morti...\n\nWe are fully in the feudal epoch, but Donna Maria Ventimiglia and Graffeo did not populate their fief by force. We have no record of beatings or baronial force. They believed instead in holding their fiefs through economics and by enriching them, by improving cultivation; providing the workers with greater services, by helping to provide forage-land for the beasts of burden; granting verdant rural fields at prices that were not burdensome; constructing houses for the new vassals and letting them for rent; building the church (dedicated to San Francesco of Paola) and summoning a chaplain, a caretaker who baptized their children born in the new Land, or blessed the marriages between the newly arrived, or buried their dead...\n\nA molti piacquero questi modi semplici e cordiali, accettarono la mo destia dei censi, e certamente trovarono quelle agevolazioni e comodità che non avevano trovato altrove.\n\nAccettarono, certamente, anche le privative del Barone e i suoi diritti feudali, che erano una regola e non l'eccezione, di molire nei suoi mulini, di comprare nelle sue botteghe, di cuocere il pane nei suoi forni, od acqui stare la carne nelle sue boccerie e macelli.\n\nEd acconsentirono alla sua giurisdizione civile e criminale, che per gli onesti era una garanzia di vita semplice e non turbata da malandrini e av venturieri.\n\n«E così, scrive la Fallico67, si avviò il paziente lavoro collettivo cui prendevano parte gli umili e potenti, le persone colte e gli illiterati i quali tutti tendenti alla stessa mèta, realizzavano insieme ilprogrammapre disposto».\n\nTo many these simple and cordial ways were pleasing, and they accepted the modest restrictions, and certainly realized some facilities and comforts they had not found elsewhere.\n\nThey also accepted, certainly, the prerogatives of the Baron and his feudal rights, which were the rule and not the exception, to grind flour in their mills, to purchase from their shops, to cook bread in their ovens, and to obtain meat at their butchers and slaughterhouses.\n\nAnd they consented to his civil and criminal jurisdiction, which for the honest was a guarantee of a simple life undisturbed by rogues and adventurers.\n\nAnd in this way, writes la Fallico67, went the patient collective labor accepted on the part of the humble and the powerful, persons of culture and illiterates, who all marched to the same beat, together realizing the pre-ordained plan.\n\n65 GARUFI, Roccapalumba, cit., pag. 75.\n\n66 M.

Pagina bellissima che dovrebbe anche rivalutare la tan to vilipesa feudalità, solitamente considerata un elemento negativo della storia siciliana «ma che in realtà, tra Medioevo ed Età Moderna, colonizzò l'isola».\n\nIt was an enthusiastic enterprise, however risky financially, which leant itself to create the premise for the growth of a new Land, the development of agricultural and commercial activities, and the economic progress of the whole territory. A beautiful page of history which calls for the re-evaluation of vile feudalism, usually considered a negative element of Sicilian history but which in truth, between Medieval times and the modern age, colonized the island.\n\nE Donna Maria con il nipote D. Francesco Graffeo, come Vincenzo Maria Termini (Casteltermini), Lionello Lercaro (Lercara Friddi), Ottavio Lanza (Trabia), Carlo Carafa (Grammichele), Placido Fardella (Paceco), Pietro Altariva (Riesi), Diego Aragona (Montedoro), Giovanni Campo (Campofranco), Giacinto Papè (Vallelunga), e molti altri, in quell'epoca, portarono il loro contributo pietra su pietra, come dice il Sorge, al grande edificio della storia della Sicilia. «Fu una delle imprese più grandiose, scrive Trasselli68, che la storia della Sicilia possa vantare».\n\nAnd Donna Maria with her grandson Don Francesco Graffeo, like Vincenzo Maria Termini (Casteltermini), Lionello Lercaro (Lercara Friddi), Ottavio Lanza (Trabia), Carlo Carafa (Grammichele), Placido Fardella (Paceco), Pietro Altariva (Riesi), Diego Aragona (Montedoro), Giovanni Campo (Campofranco), Giacinto Papè (Vallelunga), and many others, in that epoch, brought their contribution stone by stone, as Sorge says, to the great edifice that is the history of Sicily. It was one of the most prodigious enterprises, writes Trasselli68, that the history of Sicily can boast of.\n\nColonizzazione del latifondo... quante volte tale espressione è com parsa nella stampa scientifica o quotidiana o impegnata, da quando si parla di Questione Meridionale!\n\nEbbene, un Barone come la Graffeo, senza aiuto della Cassa del Mez zogiorno e senza leggi sullo scorporo del latifondo, seppe realizzare la co lonizzazione di Serradífalco.\n\nE nella nuova Terra paraspulari e vurdunari, gente umile ma attiva, curatoli e picurari, ed agricoltori, ed artigiani, barbieri, ciabattini, fale gnami e muratori, presero in affitto le case e aprirono le loro botteghe nel corso principale, e nella piazza tra la chiesa e il Palazzo del Barone, per 1 una nuova vita, una nuova era per i loro discendenti a venire.\n\nThe colonization of the latifondo... How many times that expression has appeared in scientific papers, or the daily press or in debate, when the Southern Issue is spoken of!\n\nWell, a Baron like Graffeo, without the help of the Bank of the Mezzogiorno and without laws on the subdivision of the latifondo, knew how to achieve the colonization of Serradifalco..\n\nAnd in the new Land, weavers and muleteers, humble people but productive ones, doctors and shepherds, and farmers, and artisans, barbers, cobblers, carpenters and masons, rented the houses and opened their shops on the main street and in the piazza between the church and the Palace of the Baron, for a new life and a new era for their descendants yet to come.\n\nUsi civici di Serradifalco\n\nAbbiamo già visto che il nostro feudatario non accordò mai ai suoi vassalli, sin dal 1640, alcun diritto di acquare o portare gli animali al pa scolo nelle «terre comuni», o prendere pietre, calce, né prima né dopo la Licenza di popolare. Non successe con i Graffeo né con i Lo Faso.\n\nCivic uses of Serradifalco\n\nWe have already seen that our feudatory never accorded his vassals, since 1640, any right to water or to bring their livestock to pasture in common lands, or to extract rock or chalk, neither before nor after the Permit to populate. It didnt happen with the Graffeos, nor with the Lo Fasos.\n\n68 TESTA, Il Principato, cit. Introduzione di Carmelo TRASSELLI, pag. X.\n\n68 TESTA, The Principality, cit. Introduction by Carmelo TRASSELLI, p. X.\n\n64\n\nCon il secolo XIX non cambia nulla o quasi. Al 1804 vi e ancora il Beneficiale Insalaco, procuratore della chiesa, che in eta matura, e accusato dal Vescovo di non avere introitato le offerte dei fedeli, con «apoca» o ricevuta, e la situazione finanziaria e un po' confusa 289.\n\nMa intorno al 1827 con il nuovo Cappellano, sac. D. Raimondo Coniglio, l'amministrazione cambia in meglio. E prima dell'entrata della chiesa nella nuova diocesi di Caltanissetta ci restano alcuni documenti per trac­ciare un quadro molto preciso.\n\nDall'ultima Visita Pastorale (1827) la chiesa, l'altare maggiore, e gli altri, i confessionali, le statue dei santi, tutto e bene ordinato. Mai aveva­mo letto sei fogli pieni di «suppellettili, argento ed altri utensili esistenti nella chiesa» e presentati dal nuovo Cappellano Coniglio a Mons. d'A­gostino 290.\n\nTra l'altro mettiamo una nota storica ad «un piccolo manto color violaceo con frinza di argento per Maria SS. del Carmine».\n\nSotto il Beneficiale Coniglio l'importo della congrua passo da onze 18 a 24, mentre si erano aggiunti altri censi e giogali di fedeli, ed elemosine.\n\nIl Beneficiale spesso non prendeva la congrua, donandola alla chiesa.\n\nLe spese correnti erano per consumo di cera, novena del S. Natale, le Quarantore del Divinissimo, acconci nella costruzione, per «disparo di rnorta­retti nell'anniversario dei morti e nei primi dodici lunedi», onze 9.30.\n\nNello «Stato delle chiese del comune di Serradifalco al 1829», che abbiamo spesso citato, la Chiesa de/ Purgatorio ha la seguente scheda: - E di proprieta del Signor Duca di Serradifalco. Abbisogna di essere biancheggiata a stucco per una spesa di 180 ducati.\n\nConfraternita del Purgatorio\n\nUna «Confraternita» fu subito eretta accanto alla chiesa, la si riscon-\n\n289 ACAG, SVP, Reg. 1804, f. 743, alla data del 6 dicembre 1804.\n\n290 Primariamente una sfera grande di argento con sopra fili indorati, piti una croce e crocifisso d'argento con sua asta, piu un sicchiello con sua sponsa d'argento.\n\nun incensiero, un calice, una pisside, un perpetuo, una chiave d'argento;\n\nun calice di rame con gotto d'argento indorato e sua patena indorata, drappi fiorati e ricamati in oro, lampieri di rarne,\n\ncamici, cottc, cappelle, con frinze d'argento e guarnite di gallone d'argento, 5 altari adorni di suoi candelieri, in rame e crocifissi, un baldacchino di seta,\n\nil Sepolcro della Settirnana Santa tutto indorato, e foderato di dentro con raso a color di latte ...\n\nACAG, SVP, Reg. 1827, ff. 1$8-161, Inventario della Chiesa delle Anime Sante del Purgatorio.\n\nBut around 1827 with the new chaplain, Priest Don Raimondo Coniglio, the administration changes for the better. And before the entry of the church in the new diocese of Caltanissetta there are some documents which draw a very accurate picture.\n\nFor the Pastoral Visit (1827) the church, the altar, and the other items; the confessionals, statues of saints, were all in good order. We never have read six such pages full of furniture, silver and other items existing in the church and presented by the new Chaplain Coniglio to Msgr. D'Agostino 290.\n\nAmong other things we show a historical note for \"a purple cape with silver fringe for Maria SS. del Carmine\".\n\nUnder the Benefactor Coniglio the value of the stipend increased from 18 to 24 ounces, while there were added other gifts of the faithful, and alms.\n\nThe Benefactor often did not take the stipend, giving it to the church.\n\nCurrent expenditures were for consumption of wax, novena of San Natale, the Forty Days of the most Divine, flourishes in the construction, for display of fireworks on the anniversary of the dead and on the twelve first Mondays, 30.9 ounces.\n\nIn the report State of the churches of the town of Serradifalco through 1829, which we have often cited, the Church of Purgatory has the following annotation: - It is owned by the Lord Duke of Serradifalco. Its stucco is in need of whitewashing at a cost of 180 ducats.\n\nBrotherhood of Purgatory\n\nA \"Brotherhood\" was immediately erected next to the church, we find\n\n289ACAG, SVP, Reg. 1804, p. 743, dated 6 December 1804.\n\n290 Firstly, a large sphere of silver overlaid with gilded wire, a silver cross and crucifix with its stand, plus a silver --?\n\na censer, a chalice, a ciborium, a perpetual, a silver key;\n\na cup of copper gilt and its gilded stand, flowered drapes embroidered in gold, copper lamp-stands,\n\ngowns, cooked goods, chapels, with silver fringes trimmed with silver stripes, five altars adorned with\n\nchandeliers, copper crucifixes, a silk canopy,\n\nthe tomb of the Holy Week all gilded, and lined with m ilk-colored satin ...\n\nACAG, SVP, Reg. 1827 pp. 158-161, Inventory of the Church of the Holy Souls in Purgatory.\n\n242\n\nDopo dieci giorni, il 21, veniva pubblicato il Regolamento, con il quale erano date indicazioni precise circa l'estensione, la forma, la custodia dei camposanti e il modo di sotterrare i cadaveri. A queste disposizioni non si diede alcuna importanza. I morti venivano sepolti nelle fosse delle chies­e da decenni, da secoli e nessuno voleva cambiare. A Serradifalco le pri­me fosse furono nella chiesa di San Francesco, in quella antica e nuova matrice di San Leonardo, e nelle altre chiese, che man mano andavano sorgendo.\n\nNel 1825, il 14 ottobre, il Sindaco comunicava all'Intendente di avere saputo, attraverso i registri, che ii cimitero fuori l'abitato, era stato eretto in dal 1784 a spese del Duca di Serradifalco, per seppellirvi i cadaveri.\n\nEra il Cimitero di San Giuseppe, cioè un oratorio accanto alla chiesa, che era sorta l'anno prima 357.\n\nEd il Sindaco Sferrazza aggiunge che questa chiesa rimane ancora la piu idonea allo scope. Un mese dopo ritira la proposta, e rileva che il sep­pellimento in quella arreca pregiudizio alla salute degli abitanti, «essendo la chiesa senza coverticcio e con molti rettili». E consigliabile scegliere le altre dell' «Imrnacolata» e del «Purgatorio».\n\nAd un anno di distanza, il 10 giugno 1831, viene chiesto lo Stato delle sepolture gentilizie esistenti nel commune.\n\n357 Idem, vol. 3243.\n\n358\n\n.\n\nASCL, Intendenza, vol. 3243.\n\nFatto in Serradifalco 10 giugno 1831\n\nI1 Sindaco ff. Salvadore Misuraca\n\nTen days later, on the 21st, were published Regulations, with which they were given precise details about the size, the shape, and custody of the cemeteries and the way to bury the corpses. These provisions were not given any importance. The dead had been buried in mass graves of the churches for decades, for centuries; and no one wanted to change. At Serradifalco the first graves were in the church of San Francesco, in the old Mother Church and the new one of San Leonardo, and other churches, which gradually arose.\n\nIn 1825, on October 14, the Mayor communicated to the Superintendent that he had known, through the town registers, that a cemetery outside the main village had been erected in 1784 at the expense of the Duke of Serradifalco, to bury the corpses. [Note: Though on the outskirts, the church was not outside the town]\n\nIt was the cemetery of St. Joseph, that is, a chapel next to the church, which had risen the previous year 357.\n\nAnd Mayor Sferrazza adds that this church is still the most suitable for the purpose. A month later he withdrew the proposal and notes that the burial in that church is detrimental to the health of the inhabitants, \"the chapel being without cover, with many reptiles.\" It is advisable to choose the other churchyards of ''Immacolata\" and \"Purgatory.\"\n\nLater, on June 10, 1831, he prompted the report titled the state of noble burials in the existing town357.\n\n357 Idem, vol. 3243.\n\n358\n\nASCL, Superintendency, vol. 3243.\n\nRecorded in Serradifalco 10 June 1831\n\nThe Mayor [signed by] Salvadore Misuraca\n\n291"
