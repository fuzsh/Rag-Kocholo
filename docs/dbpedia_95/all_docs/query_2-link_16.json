        "text": "I agree with the reviewers who found the baroque beautiful and overwhelming. One feature that I found stunning was the use of Pietra Dure on four side altars. The guides said this was not Florentine artistry, but native Palermitans who executed it, making it all the more remarkable. Realizing it was built in 1622 it is a wonder that it was built directly across the street from the more ancient church of Sant Ippolito, which was the parish seat from 1309. So, don't miss that church if it's opened when you visit.\n\nJust sit down and take it all in for ten minutes. There is so much to see, the marble, the roof everything is exquisite. A must see especially if you are already at the markets!\n\na marvelous work of art!! Absolutely stunning!! A hidden gem in the old town of Palermo... And, of course, in order to complete the experience, the best thing to do is to have a guided tour!\n\nThis church is just one of the many ( a thousand they say...) churches in ³Palermo. It has nothing highly spectacular, still surprises because it is \"real\" and still live. The 1€ you pay is well paid."
