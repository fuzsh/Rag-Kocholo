        "text": "The essay traces in Sardinian perspective the events connected with the inclusion of tenor singing among the Masterpieces ofthe Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. Together with information appearing in the regional media, it considers the performers' reactions, with particular reference to the position of the Sardinia Tenor Association, which was founded in 2006 by hundreds of singers organised in stable quartets, the aim being to interact with \"development and protection\" events proposed by UNESCO. Based on these events, some basic concepts of UNESCO's intangible heritage policy are called into question, starting with the very notion of the immateriality and intangibility of music and the idea of music as a heritage. The spotlight is on the ambiguity of inventory policies and the fact that the representations proposed by UNESCO are a long way from the reality of the cultural practices considered by the ICH programme.\n\nThe ninth-century poet and musician, Ziryab, is synonymous with the musical cultures of Muslim Spain (al-Andalus) and the idea of commonality between different genres across the Mediterranean. While some scholars have deconstructed the myth of Ziryab at a historiographical level, there has been less consideration of how the myth is interpreted in contemporary musical practice. This article examines how Ziryab is reinterpreted in the present through intercultural music making. Drawing on fieldwork in Madrid and Valencia (2016), I focus on the Ziryab and Us: A New Vision of the Arab-Andalusian Heritage project, in which French, Israeli, Moroccan and Spanish musicians sought to reinterpret the legend of Ziryab through the lens of their own musical traditions. I argue that Ziryab functioned as a discursive trope that engendered a series of micro-social relations between the musicians, framed by ideas of musical affinity, a shared cultural space (the Mediterranean) and cross-cultural exchange. But beyond the ideals of musical connection that Ziryab implies, the relational processes that characterised the project were not always unified. Therefore, I examine some of the points of tension that emerged when the musicians brought together distinct traditions under the rubric of a shared ‘Andalusian’ or Mediterranean heritage.\n\nBands structured around western wind instruments are among the most widespread instrumental ensembles in the world. Although these ensembles draw upon European military traditions that spread globally through colonialism, militarism and missionary work, local musicians have adapted the brass band prototype to their home settings, and today these ensembles are found in religious processions and funerals, military manoeuvres and parades, and popular music genres throughout the world. Based on their expertise in ethnographic and archival research, the contributors to this volume present a series of essays that examine wind band cultures from a range of disciplinary perspectives, allowing for a comparison of band cultures across geographic and historical fields. The themes addressed encompass the military heritage of band cultures; local appropriations of the military prototype; links between bands and their local communities; the spheres of local band activities and the modes of sociability within them; and the role of bands in trajectories toward professional musicianship. This book will appeal to readers with an interest in ethnomusicology, colonial and post-colonial studies, community music practices, as well as anyone who has played with or listened to their local band. © Suzel Ana Reily, Katherine Brucher and the contributors 2013.
