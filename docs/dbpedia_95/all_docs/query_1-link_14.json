The aim of the study was to provide effective geometrical-formal investigation tools in the frame of the conservation work of Zeus enthroned from Soluntum, conserved in the Archaeological Museum \" A. Salinas \" of Palermo. The paper describes the workflow of the 3D acquisition and graphical modeling with non-invasive digitalization and high information density techniques to assist the conservation of the legs of the throne, especially the integration of the missing part. Thanks to the technique of the digital fabrication it has been reconstruct the two missing parts following the theoretical criteria as: recognisability, compatibility and retractability. This innovative application of 3D digital technologies have showed as the integrated use of the new technology can be a useful tools for improving the conservation of a work of art.\n\nView\n\nCOMPUTER AIDED RESTORATION TOOLS TO ASSIST THE CONSERVATION OF AN ANCIENT SCULPTURE.

Inzerillo\n\n·\n\nFrancesco Di Paola\n\nIn In the last years there has been an increasing use of digital techniques for conservation and restoration purposes. Among these, a very dominant rule is played by the use of digital photogrammetry packages (Agisoft Photoscan, 3D Zephir) which allow to obtain in few steps 3D textured models of real objects. Combined with digital documentation technologies digital fabrication technologies can be employed in a variety of ways to assist in heritage documentation, conservation and dissemination. This paper will give to practitioners an overview on the state of the art available technologies and a feasible workflow for optimizing point cloud and polygon mesh datasets for the purpose of fabrication using 3D printing. The goal is to give an important contribute to confer an automation aspect at the whole processing. We tried to individuate a workflow that should be applicable to several types of cases apart from small precautions. In our experimentation we used a DELTA WASP 2040 printer with PLA easyfil.\n\nView\n\nFROM SFM TO 3D PRINT: AUTOMATED WORKFLOW ADDRESSED TO PRACTITIONER AIMED AT THE CONSERVATION AND RESTAURATION\n\nAugust 2017\n\n·\n\n173 Reads\n\nInzerillo Laura\n\n·\n\nFrancesco Di Paola\n\nIn In the last years there has been an increasing use of digital techniques for conservation and restoration purposes.
