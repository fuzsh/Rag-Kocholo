        "text": "In top center, under the upper edge, we find the title: LA NOBILE CITTA DI MESSINA. Along the bottom margin is engraved a numerical legend of 167 references to places and monuments notable, distributed over fourteen columns. It follows the editorial imprint: In Venetia alla libraria al segno di S. Marco in Merzaria D.B. Orientation through a rose of the winds in the sea, the north is to the right.\n\nPerspective plan of Messina that bears the address of the Libreria of S. Marco and the initials of Donato Bertelli. This is a faithful Venetian replica of the map of Argaria printed in Rome by Antonio Lafreri in 1567, with absolutely identical plant, even in size. Argaria's work constitutes the first comprehensive image of the city. It is also the first to show the Arsenale Nuovo, built on the area of San Ranieri in 1565 - Arcenal Novo fato L anno 1565. Even the legend at the bottom is the same, with 167 references to the original model, which differs essentially only for the lack of the cartouche with dedication on the right, here replaced by a large vessel. The map, published by the typography of Donato Bertelli, is of absolute rarity. The date is deduced on the basis of similar works of Donato (Naples and Venice) belonging to the same type.\n\nDonato Bertelli is a printer and publisher active in Venice in Merzaria all'insegna di S. Marco. He was probably born in Padua, as we can deduce from his signature on some branches, Donatus Bertellius Patavinus, his activity, on the basis of the works he published, can be circumscribed to the years between 1558 and 1592. In 1559 he was in the workshop of Ferrando Bertelli and signed In Venetia appresso Donato Bertelli libraro al segno del S. Marco. Upon Ferrando's death, Donato inherited or purchased his branches and published them, as he did also for plates by Forlani and Camocio, affixing his name.\n\nEtching and engraving, impressed on contempoary laid paper, with margins, in perfect condition.\n\nOnly three exemplars of the map are registered in Bifolco-Ronca, among which the one in contemporary coloring preserved at the Maritiem Museum in Rotterdam.\n\nVery rare.\n\nBibliografia"
