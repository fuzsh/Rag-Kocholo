        "text": "Our journeys are for people who have a passion for the Outdoors, History and Culture, Gourmet Food & Wine. We like to think of our guests as travellers, not tourists. Our groups are small and the people are like-minded.\n\nWe personally research each exciting itinerary and we take care of all the arrangements so you can maximise your time & enjoyment. Tours last a week to 13 days.\n\nWe explore on foot and off the beaten track in order to immerse you in the local culture and tradition in a unique way… the Caspin way!\n\nYour Caspin Journeys experience starts as soon as you get in touch with us to tell us about your interests and your dream destination. Like you, we have the travel bug and get as excited about it as you do.\n\nWe are here to take away the hassle of the planning process. Right from the start, we can direct you towards the best tour to meet your desires and expectations. Once we have helped you to choose and book your tour you can expect to meet us on the first day when we meet you at the pickup point. We will have made all the hotel arrangements, selected delicious local dishes for lunches and dinner menus. We will be there to guide you whether it be through the narrow, cobbled streets in Sicilian towns, on the exhilarating Dolomite mountain trails or along the Spanish pilgrim roads. We do all the driving in between walks so you can sit back and relax or gaze out of the window and day dream while we take care of everything.\n\nAnd if the destination you are looking for is not yet in our repertoire, don’t hesitate to ask, we would love to Tailor-Make a trip for you!\n\nWe are happy to develop your bespoke trip and itinerary. Our personal touch is unique and our travellers tell us they cherish the special relationship they can find only with Caspin Journeys.\n\nHow did you make the transition to becoming a tour guide?\n\nWe slowly built up our repertoire starting with Tuscany and then Sicily, gradually spreading to many different regions of Italy, England and Spain. We took great care to carefully research each destination to reflect the local culture, traditions and environment. We tailored each tour to meet the needs of our clients, who repeatedly asked to travel with us because of the unique experience we offer them. We could hardly describe those who travel with us as clients, they have become friends and the proof of this is that for over 20 years our business has grown thanks to their word of mouth and fantastic reviews.\n\nWhat does a typical day look like for you?\n\nWhen we are running a tour we are completely dedicated to our guests. We all have breakfast together in the morning and then after a short briefing leave for the day’s activities, which could be walking, town visiting, wine tasting, cooking and more. On our guided tours the days walk is divided into two parts and lunch is usually a homemade buffet picnic at the halfway point of the days’ walk. In the afternoon we guide our groups around heritage towns and discuss the culture, history and traditions of the area. The evening meal is a carefully chosen menu which we share together – it is an important moment of conviviality to talk about our experiences while tasting local food and wines.\n\nHave you got a certain style of guiding, or do you just run with it on the day?\n\nAttention to detail is paramount to how we run the tour. We carefully plan every step beforehand and throughout the trip make sure we are with the group at all times so that we can answer all their questions and needs. It is important to take care of everything so that our guests can relax, enjoy the experience and absorb all the amazing things our destinations have to offer.\n\nWe put a lot of care, enthusiasm and passion into what we do and we think these are the chief ingredients of our success.\n\nWhat is the best part of your job?\n\nThe best part of our job is the time we spend with our guests. They are all likeminded travellers, who love to see new places, learn new things and completely immerse themselves in the local culture. The conversations are stimulating and interesting and always a lot of fun. We have as much to learn from our guests as we can teach them.\n\nAs one of our travelers put it: ‘Caspin adventures always stimulate our intellects and satisfy our tummies’.\n\nAs an experienced guide yourself, can you explain to our readers what the benefits of hiring a guide are?\n\nThe benefits of hiring a guide are that they allow those on holiday to completely relax, forget about the hassle of organising every detail and experience a destination to its fullest, thanks to the knowledge of guides. We offer you the luxury to be carefree and totally immerse yourself in the local atmosphere, making the most of your precious time. They take care of all the logistical arrangements and tiny details you would hope to think of if only you had the time.\n\nA guide knows the way, can take you off the beaten track, can show you things you would not see if you were by yourself, can introduce you to local people and good local food.\n\nIn your view, what makes a good tour guide?\n\nThe best tour guide is someone who knows how to share his knowledge in a manner which is easily understood – paints a picture in the minds of his/her guests, helping them to understand and feel the story, the magic or the importance of the place they are in. A good guide can judge how much information to give without boring the guest! After that a good guide blends in with his guests and is not simply acting as a guide but as a knowledgeable fellow traveller, someone to share experiences with, to laugh, have fun and discover with.\n\nGuests should go away with great memories and new knowledge."
