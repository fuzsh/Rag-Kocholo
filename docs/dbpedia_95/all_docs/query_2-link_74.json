The elegant and sophisticated town house sits on a quiet piazza on the edge of the charming 13th century village.\n\nIn the rear of the house guests will find a large and meticulously planted garden which features Cypress, Fig, Pomegranate and various beautiful flowers. There is a refreshing plunge pool, along with lounge chairs on the main terrace where guests can bask under the Tuscan sun. The stone-made plunge pool is elegant and perfect for cooling down. Being in town the garden can be overlooked.\n\nThe dining room and kitchen are on either side of a lovely working fireplace, and if you prefer to dine at home there are cookware and utensils at your disposal. There is a charming breakfast terrace just off the dining room for a leisurely morning cappuccino in the Sun or an al fresco lunch or dinner outdoors. Also on the ground floor there is a sumptuous living room plus a ground floor suite with bathroom across the hallway.\n\nAccommodation consists of a further three air-conditioned suites. Stanza Siena and Stanza Roma are large suites with en-suite bathroom, on the other side of which is a smaller bedroom which can be used to sleep 1 or to use as a dressing/reading room. Stanza Firenze is on the top floor and has an en-suite bathroom as well, including a free-standing bathtub (with handheld shower). The bathrooms are all very modern and stylish. Quality, luxury bedding and linens provided in all rooms. Also on the ground floor there is a study room for those needing to work whilst on holiday.\n\nThough most of the home has been renovated, the property retains a sense of grandeur, and guests can wander the village's cobbled alleyways to immerse themselves in the storied history of the region. The village of Castelmuzio is charming and has a local trattoria and small supermarket, both a short walk from your front door. Parking is available directly at the house to drop bags off and only about 100m from the house there is free public parking. For those wanting to explore the village is ideally positioned to easily get to Montepulciano, Pienza, Siena, Montalcino and the stunning Val D'Orcia.\n\nFotos: @danielacesareiphotography"
