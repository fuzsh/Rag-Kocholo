        "text": "To my nose, the combination of the ingredients smells like pear. As I am not very much into fruity scents and this one, moreover, seems somewhat chemical, it's rather disappointing. For some it will be a ladylike scent, but this jasmine is surely not nobile.\n\nThe opening is really good: orange, a white light pepper note and a strong tuberose, with a very nice jasmine developing. Then, after about two hours, it collapses on my skin to a shadow of its former glory: a nondescript musk-woodsy base that it quite uninspiring, in spite of an uninspiring floral background. Initially silage and longevity are good, and the total longevity is over five hours on me\n\nThe only AdP fragrance I've ever had is the beautiful Fico di Amalfi, which I got a few months ago. It is now my intention to work my way through the entire range of these exquisite perfumes, and Gelsomino Nobile is next. I always seem to be attracted to perfumes with notes of jasmine, and as this is called Noble Jasmine, it's no surprise that I love it. I think the iris one will be next, but I just think these Acqua di Parma perfumes are class in a bottle. Now that I've smelt these, it's hard going back to mainstream perfumes. Love it. Could bathe in it."
