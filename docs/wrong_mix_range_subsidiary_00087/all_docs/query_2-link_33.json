        "text": "CHICAGO and LYNCHBURG, Va., July 20 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Allscripts (Nasdaq: MDRX) announced today that Centra, a three-hospital system in Central Virginia, has selected the Allscripts Electronic Health Record (EHR) solution for its staff physicians, and the Allscripts Community Exchange as the platform for electronically connecting the medical community in its region. Centra will also provide its home health nurses with the Allscripts Homecare solution to improve the continuity of care and help prevent the need for patient readmissions after they leave the hospital.\n\n(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20081013/AQM041LOGO)\n\n(Logo: http://www.newscom.com/cgi-bin/prnh/20081013/AQM041LOGO)\n\nCentra has been using the Allscripts ED solution to automate emergency department operations and improve access to clinical information since 2008.\n\nCentra will initially provide the Allscripts EHR to over 70 providers, including physicians and midlevel practitioners. Both employed and affiliated private-practice physicians will receive the Allscripts solution. Centra plans to first introduce the EHR in an independent internal-medicine practice consisting of 18 providers, and to gradually provide the Electronic Health Record to over 250 providers in its service area.\n\n\"Our goal is to achieve true community physician integration,\" said Ben Clark, Chief Information Officer of Centra. \"That's why we're offering the Allscripts EHR and Exchange products to both affiliated and non-affiliated practices. Our goal is to connect the community and extend our electronic health record across our whole sphere of service. We selected Allscripts because they can help us achieve this goal, and also because of the rich functionality and flexibility of the solution. Several groups in our community already use this product, and we're confident that it will serve our physicians well.\"\n\nAnother advantage of Allscripts Community Exchange, Clark said, is that it can be used to exchange key clinical data among disparate EHRs. With at least nine different EHRs deployed in the community, this capability will enable Centra to connect those systems. Staff physicians will also use their EHRs to order tests from Centra facilities and receive lab results and other hospital reports.\n\nIn addition, Clark pointed out, Allscripts Community Exchange allows the healthcare system to use an Enterprise Master Patient Index, or EMPI, helping ensure that every piece of medical information is associated with the correct patient across the continuum of care.\n\nCentra will host the Allscripts EHR and provide implementation and technical support to both affiliated and independent practices. With the EHR rollout slated to begin this Fall, Centra expects to have most of its affiliated practices online by 2011 so they can demonstrate meaningful use and qualify for incentives under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).\n\nThe Allscripts Homecare solution replaces another product that Centra's home health nurses have been using. It will enable the clinicians to access more information and report on each patient's condition more accurately, while sharing that data with other caregivers via the enterprise physician portal.\n\n\"Centra has a history of treating the patient for the whole continuum of care, from birth to end of life,\" Clark said. \"The Allscripts Homecare solution is the perfect fit. We have Allscripts in our emergency department today, and now we're about to deploy the EHR in the ambulatory environment. When we add the Homecare product, we'll be using the same platform across a large part of the care continuum. As we continue to expand our connectivity, the Allscripts suite of products will continue to improve the quality of care and show our community the value of a truly integrated health system.\"\n\nA custom interface will link Allscripts Homecare to Centra's enterprise information system, noted Clark. By posting the home health data on the physician portal, he said, Centra hopes to keep physicians better informed about their patients' progress, which should lead to reduced readmissions. Similarly, the use of Allscripts Community Exchange will ensure proper medication reconciliation during care transitions and will prevent duplication of orders as patients move from one care setting to another. And when a patient presents in the ED, the ED physicians will have instant access to all of his or her records, speeding medical decision-making.\n\n\"A connected community enables clinicians to get the maximum value out of health information technology,\" said Glen Tullman, Chief Executive Officer of Allscripts. \"By having the right information on the right patient at the right time, physicians and other providers can make better decisions and deliver the appropriate care when it will make the most difference in outcomes. We commend Centra for taking this visionary approach to the deployment of Electronic Health Records and connectivity across the community. Everyone will benefit from this approachâ€”especially patients, who will be able to count on getting optimal care from Centra and its physicians.\"\n\nAdditional Information on ARRA and Meaningful Use\n\nAllscripts has recently deployed a number of resources to help physician practices demonstrate \"meaningful use\" and take advantage of the ARRA incentives:\n\nThe Allscripts Stimulus Program provides physicians with a guarantee that the Allscripts Electronic Health Record they select will meet the EHR certification criteria provided by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Physicians can also benefit from an Allscripts financing program requiring no payments for software for six months, as well as programs focused on faster implementation to ensure physicians can access the Federal Stimulus incentives.\n\nThe Allscripts Stimulus Center provides the latest information on ARRA, including frequently asked questions on Meaningful Use and Certification.\n\nThe Allscripts Legislative & Regulatory Action Center is a place to learn about and take action on issues that are critical to the provider community, providing a simple, 'one touch' connection to elected officials.\n\n'Go' is a website designed for physicians and other providers who are considering deploying Electronic Health Records and other healthcare information technologies. Available at www.allscripts.com/go, the site provides easy access to best practices and success stories from the Allscripts client community of more than 160,000 physicians, 800 hospitals, and 10,000 post-acute care facilities.\n\nAbout Centra\n\nA not-for-profit health system, Centra operates two main hospitals: Lynchburg General Hospital in Lynchburg, a 358-bed critical care facility that is the area's regional center for emergency medicine, with 88,000 annual Emergency Department visits; and Virginia Baptist Hospital, a 160-bed facility that has received Press Ganey's prestigious Summit Award for achievement in patient satisfaction. In January 2006, Southside Community Hospital in Farmville joined Centra as an affiliate.\n\nAbout Allscripts\n\nAllscripts uses innovation technology to bring health to healthcare.
