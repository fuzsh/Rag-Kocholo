        "text": "State-owned oil pipeline operator Jadranski Naftovod (JANAF) said on Tuesday that in light of the EU sanctions against Russia following the invasion ofÂ Ukraine, it would stop transporting crude oil to Serbia's NIS company from mid-May until such time the sanctions are in place.\n\nJANAF does not operate directly on the Russian market, but Council Regulation (EU) 2022/428 of 15Â March 2022 amending Regulation (EU) NoÂ 833/2014 concerning restrictive measures in view of Russiaâs actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine also includes the contract for crude oil transport in 2022 which JANAF has concluded with NIS,Â JANAF reported via the Zagreb Stock Exchange.\n\nJANAF said that it will not be in a position to realise the provisions of that contract as of 15 May 2022 and as long as the restrictive measures imposed by the EU are in force.\n\nGiven that it is not currently possible to foresee the potential duration and future intensity of the restrictions, it is not possible to estimate the effects of the restrictions so that they do not jeopardise JANAFâs current financial status and business, the companyÂ said.\n\nThe company said it is monitoring developments on a daily basis and is in close contact with its clients.\n\nIt is also monitoring the measures introduced by the government, EU and competent institutions and is estimating the risk and possibility of the measures being relaxed. JANAF can adapt its business toÂ clientsâ demands and alternative scenarios of doing business in the oil transport market, the company said, adding that it does not expect any significant negative deviations in its operation.\n\nIn mid-January, JANAF reported that it had concluded a contract with NIS for crude oil transport for the period from 1 January to 31 December 2022.\n\nNIS is majority-owned by Gazprom Neft, which holds 56.15% of shares, while the Serbian governmentÂ owns 29.87%Â and small shareholders hold 13.98% of the companyâs shares.\n\nIn mid-March, the EU agreed on a fourth package of restrictive measures against Russia, including a ban on investmentÂ in Russiaâs energy sector, a ban on exporting luxury goods, and a ban on importing steel products from Russia.\n\nThe sanctions also include a ban on any transactions with key Russian state-owned enterprises across different sectors, including Gazprom Neft."
