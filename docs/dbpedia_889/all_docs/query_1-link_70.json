        "text": "In a significant stride towards energy modernisation, Croatia is setting aside EUR 500 million for the development of large-scale energy storage systems. The announcement was made by Damir Habijan, Croatia’s Minister of Economy and Sustainable Development, at the seventh international energy conference hosted by Jadranski Naftovod (JANAF), the national oil transport company.\n\nThe investment forms part of a broader initiative underpinned by the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP) and the European Commission’s REPowerEU scheme, from which Croatia has secured a total of EUR 1.6 billion. These funds are earmarked not only for enhancing the country’s renewable energy capacity but also for bolstering its energy security.\n\nA recent manifestation of this initiative is the EUR 533 million upgrade to the liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal on the island of Krk, aimed at doubling its capacity. This expansion, from 2.9 to 6.1 billion cubic meters annually, is complemented by the construction of a new gas pipeline network extending towards Hungary and Slovenia, underscoring the nation’s focus on diversifying its energy sources.\n\nThe forthcoming battery storage facilities are intended to provide a buffer for electricity generated from renewable sources, allowing for more flexible energy management without the immediate need to feed into the transmission grid.\n\nIn line with these developments, JANAF’s chairman, Stjepan Adanić, outlined the company’s ambition to transition from oil transport to renewable energy production, with investments planned in solar, geothermal, and wind energy. Adanić’s vision is to cultivate JANAF into a leading figure within the European energy sector, reflecting a robust commitment to sustainability and resilience."
