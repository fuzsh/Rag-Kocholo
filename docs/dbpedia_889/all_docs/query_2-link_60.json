        "text": "​\n\nEurope's Adriatic Balkan region is part of the southern portion of the Mediterranean Alpine folded zone, which extends through the Dinarides of the former Yugoslavia (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, Serbia and Montenegro, and Slovenia), the Albanides of Albania, and the Hellenides of Greece. The exploitation of the Bor copper deposit in Serbia may have had prehistoric beginnings; however, mining for base and precious metals may be traced through historical records to at least the 5th century BC.\n\nMore recently (from the 1930s to 2000), mineral deposits in the region became better defined. Commercial resources of major base metals included those of aluminium, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, lead, magnesium, manganese, nickel, and zinc. Precious metals (gold, silver, palladium, and platinum) were found mainly in association with such base metals as copper, lead, and zinc. Industrial minerals are represented by a broad range of carbonate and silicate rocks, clays, gravels and sands, and volcanic material. Mineral fuels included coal (lignite), natural gas, and petroleum.\n\nUntil the early 1990s, the mining, processing, and downstream exploitation of base metals established the region as a major European source of copper, lead, and zinc and a major world producer of chromite. The transition of the region from central economic planning to market economy systems from 1991 to 2000, however, began a swift deconstruction of existing political, commercial, and social structures. The ensuing political, social, and ethnic tensions and conflicts destroyed or degraded much of the region's mineral industries and industrial infrastructure. In 2000, active conflict in the region centered in Kosovo Province in Serbia and Montenegro and in Macedonia.\n\nThe future status of the minerals industries in the countries of the Adriatic Balkan region will only be clarified following political settlement and normalization not only between the states in the region, but also within Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Macedonia, and Serbia and Montenegro.\n\nALBANIA\n\nIn 2000, Albania continued to make progress toward fully developing a market economy system. The country's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 7.8% compared with that of 1999. This was the third year of sustained economic growth, following a major downturn in 1997 that was caused partly by internal economic issues related to Albania's transition to a market economy and partly by regional instability, especially in the neighboring republics of the former Yugoslavia.\n\nMineral deposits that traditionally are associated with Albania include chromite, copper ore, and nickeliferous iron ore, as well as natural gas and petroleum. In 2000, with the exception of nickeliferous iron ore, these deposits and such other minerals as bauxite, phosphate rock, dolomite, gypsum, and marble have been intermittently worked. Only chromite, copper, gas, and oil, which are minerals of major commercial importance, have shown sustained exploitation.\n\nUnder the central economic planning system, especially from the late 1970s through 1990, Albania's chromite mining operations were among the more important components of the mineral industry. During this period, Albania was a leading world producer and exporter of chromite; the country often was ranked second in terms of export and third in terms of production. During this period, exports of chromite, ferrochromium, and petroleum refinery products constituted the country's chief sources of foreign exchange.\n\nFor much of the 1990s, Albania's chromite mining and processing industry generally paralleled the moribund performance of the country's economy. Mine production, which amounted to more than 1 million metric tons per year (Mt/yr) of chromite in the 1980s, declined to 236,000 metric tons (t) by 1995, and fell to 79,445 t in 1999. Following several years of unsuccessful searches for foreign partners to invest in the chromite mining and processing industry, in 2000, the Government of Albania awarded Hayri Ogelman Madencilik of Turkey a long-term concession to upgrade and operate the Kalimash mining and beneficiation complex and, in addition, to develop mines at the Perollajt and Vllahane deposits in the northeastern part of the country. Hayri Ogelman Madencilik also planned to invest about $40 million in these projects as well as for the construction of a new ferrochromium plant in Elbasan (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 2001a, p. 17).\n\nThe existing ferrochromium plant at Elbasan came under operational management of ferrochromium producer, Darfo S.p.A. of Italy because of a long-term, 30-year concession agreement with the Government of Albania (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 2001a, p. 17). The agreement also gave Darfo the right to operate the Pojska and the Prrenjas chromite mines; the Pojska Mine had not produced since 1996, and the Prrenjas Mine last reported production in 1998 (980 t). Darfo's investment plan would amount to $15 million, of which $14.5 million was earmarked for modernization of the Elbasan ferrochromium plant and $0.5 million was to be invested in the Pojska and the Prrenjas Mines. Darfo sought a second concession to operate the Bulquize mining and beneficiation complex.\n\nIn 2000, the Turkish copper smelting concern, Ber-Ober ​Madencilik San've Tic As (Ber-Ober), was granted a 30-year concession to operate Albania's copper industry on a build-operate-transfer basis. The concession included mines and processing facilities in the Lezhe, Midrite, and Puke Districts. Ber-Ober planned to invest about $24.5 million in Albania's copper industry (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 2001a, p. 17).\n\nBetween 1994 and 1996, there was a hiatus of steel production at the Elbasan steelworks, which virtually had been abandoned during the 1990s. Some production resumed in 1997, 1998, and 1999, which amounted to 20,533 t, 19,527 t, and 4,813 t, respectively. In 1999, operations and management at Elbasan came under control of Kurum Steel Co. of Turkey under a 20-year lease agreement with the Government of Albania. By the beginning of 2000, production at Elbasan had risen to more than 10,000 metric tons per month from less than 10,000 metric tons per year (t/yr) (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 2001, p. 18). In 2000, Kurum's operations at Elbasan were based on two 15-t electric arc furnaces, a third electric arc furnace being converted to a ladle furnace, and one ladle furnace. In addition, Kurum operated a 250,000-t/yr billet caster, a 20,000-t/yr medium sections mill, a 180,000-t/yr bar and 30,000-t/yr wire rod mill, and a 10,000-t/yr merchant bar mill. Total finished carbon steel capacity at Elbasan in 2000 was 240,000 t/yr. Scrap steel raw materials were imported from Turkey and Ukraine. Target markets included Kosovo (Ayers, 2000).\n\nThe privatization and sale of the Fushe-Kruje cement plant for $12.5 million in April was among the major events in the industrial minerals sector during the year (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 2001a, p. 12, 15). The plant reportedly had production capacity of 150,000 t/yr of cement. The new owner RMC-ECF (a United Kingdom-Lebanese consortium) instituted an investment program to raise the capacity to meet 45% of domestic needs, thereby reducing imports. Recent cement output has not exceeded the 243,000 t produced in 1995, and imports have ranged from 500,000 to 600,000 t/yr. Facility expansion was expected to be completed in 2001. In 1997, the Lebanon-based cement trading and producing concern Seament Holding S.A.L. acquired a 70% stake in the Elbasan Cement Factory and 70% in United Quarries, which operated an adjacent limestone quarry. Facility expansion also was planned at the Elbasan plant, which would include the installation of a new 500,000-t/yr dry process clinker kiln. The project would include the possible participation of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development; financing could range between $15 million and $18 million (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 2001a, p. 12, 15).\n\nAlbania's energy production was based on coal, hydropower, natural gas, and petroleum production. The output of such mineral fuels as natural gas and petroleum, however, was central to the country's future developmental plans. The country's reported recoverable reserves of petroleum amounted to about 550 million metric tons. The state petroleum- and natural-gas-producing company Albpetrol Ltd. was reorganized in 1999 into three commercial companies—APC (the new official designation of Albpetrol), which was in charge of petroleum production; Servcom Sh.A., which was in charge of handling services; and Armo, which was in charge of refining and marketing (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 2001a, p. 17). With the participation of the World Bank and the Government of Italy, Armo was the first to be privatized in 2001. Most of the Albania's petroleum was extracted at Berat and Fier in the south-central and southwestern parts of the country, respectively. The major refineries were at Ballsh, which had capacity of 1 Mt/yr, and at Fier, which had capacity of about one-half that of Ballsh. The Ballsh refinery indicated plans to start the production of lead-free refined gasoline in 2001. Three other refineries with a cumulative capacity of 1 Mt/yr were capable only of primary processing.\n\nAnother major activity in the petroleum sector involved a memorandum of understanding that was signed during the year relative to the construction of a trans-Balkan pipeline that would extend from Burgas on the coast of Bulgaria through the city of Skopje in Macedonia to the port of Vlore in Albania. The Burgas Vlore Pipeline was projected to be about 913 kilometers long and have a total cost of $1.13 billion. The pipeline would be built and operated by the U.S.-based consortium Albanian, Macedonian, and Bulgarian Oil Corp. Financing would be based on bank credits from international financial institutions (about $60 million), and the balance, from the sale of company shares. Construction was scheduled to start in 2001 and to be completed in 2005. The pipeline was intended to carry 750,000 barrels per day of petroleum from Russia and other states of the former Soviet Union from the Black Sea to western European markets.\n\nBOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA\n\nBosnia and Herzegovina's mineral resources with associated mining and processing facilities remained divided within the country's two administrative zones—the Federation of Bosnian Moslems and Croatians (FBC), which formed one entity (about 51% of Bosnia and Herzegovina), and the Republika Srpska (RS) with a predominantly Serbian population, which formed the other entity (49%). In 2000, the process of reintegrating the two zones continued to show little progress.\n\nThe economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina continued to be difficult to gauge owing to the lack of uniform reporting by each side to the Agency for Statistics in Sarajevo. The growth rate of the country's GDP for 1999, which continued to be driven by transfers from abroad and by capital inflows, was revised to 7% from the 10% reported earlier (Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina, 2000, p. 36). A similar GDP growth rate in 2000 was expected but would be contingent on continued financial assistance from the international community, which continued to focus its efforts on the development of a market economy and the reconstruction of Bosnia and Herzegovina's postwar industry and infrastructure (U.S. Agency for International Development, 2000a).\n\nIndustrial production in the FBC rose by 8.8% in 2000 compared with that of 1999. The energy sector, which represented about 35% of the value of industrial output (coal production and electric power), accounted for most of this increase. Overall, mining output, which accounted for more than 10% of total industrial production, rose by about 10.4% in 2000 compared with that of 1999. In the FBC, coal was produced in the Tuzla and the Zenica regions with most of the output earmarked for the Kakanj and the Tuzla powerplants. The FBC accounted for about 80% of total resources of brown coal and for about 60% of the lignite in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bauxite and alumina were produced in the southern and western areas of the FBC, and aluminum was ​smelted in Mostar. Lead and zinc ore has been produced at Olovo and Vares, but the mining status of these operations was uncertain in 2000. Iron ore production was centered at Jablanica and Vares, and that of manganese ore, at Bosanska Krupa.\n\nThe FBC was the only producer of steel in Bosnia and Herzegovina. BH Steel Co. Zenica produced pig iron and carbon steel; additional cold-rolled steel and pipe was produced at Unis in Sarajevo. In 2000, major activities in the steel sector included a contract awarded to Danieli SpA of Italy by BH Steel to supply a new 100-t electric arc furnace and to modernize an existing light section mill.\n\nThe FBC also had exploitable resources of barite, gypsum, magnesite, and rock salt. The levels of output of these as well as other mineral commodities, however, were not fully clear in 2000.\n\nIn the RS, industrial production increased by 5.6% in 2000 compared with that of 1999. The increase was buoyed largely by an 8.6% increase in the output of raw materials, of which nonferrous metals and base chemicals reportedly recorded the largest increase in production (Köhl, 2001). All branches of the minerals industry (mining to semimanufactures), however, represented about 20% of total industrial output.\n\nBauxite deposits of regional importance were worked at Vlasenica and Zvornik in the eastern RS and near Banja Luka in the northwestern RS. Although the RS was not a producer of aluminum, alumina was refined at Zvornik for export. Lead and zinc were mined at Srebrenica. Substantial deposits of nickel also had been worked at the Vardiste Mines near Visegrad. Although complete data on mineral production have been scarce, the latest data (1998) on capacity utilization suggest a low level of production within the minerals industry sector of the RS. In ferrous metals mining and beneficiation, nonferrous metals mining, and nonferrous metals production, capacity utilization amounted to about 20%, 5%, and 8%, respectively. Capacity utilization for total downstream metalworking amounted to about 61%. Capacity utilization in industrial minerals mining and processing had fallen to about 14% and 3%, respectively. In the cement, concrete, and sand production branches, capacity utilization amounted to 24%. Coal production and petroleum-refining branches reported having attained capacity utilization levels of 59% and 26%, respectively (U.S. Agency for International Development, 2000b, p. 48–54).\n\nThe modernization and privatization of the mineral industries in both halves of Bosnia and Herzegovina as well as the establishment of reliable markets continue to be essential for their long-term viability.\n\nCROATIA\n\nPetroleum production and refining remained the chief components of Croatia's minerals industry. Small quantities of ferrous and nonferrous metals and industrial minerals were produced, mainly for domestic needs.\n\nIn 2000, following a year of economic stagnation, Croatia's GDP grew by 3.5%, and industrial production, by about 1.7%. The total value of output of the mining and quarrying sector increased by 1.8%, of which the value of petroleum output increased by 2%. The output of petroleum refinery products, base metals, and processed industrial minerals rose by 5.4%, 4.4%, and 4.1%, respectively.\n\nMajor activities in the oil and gas sector included the Government's plan to privatize Croatia's state-owned oil company Industrija Nafte d.d. Zagreb (INA) in 2002. INA operated domestic oilfields and gasfields southeast of Zagreb near the Hungarian border and along the Adriatic coast. The country's primary source of petroleum came from imports via the Adria pipeline that runs from Omisalj on the Adriatic coast toward Sisak (refinery) to the east and then northward towards Hungary. About two-thirds of the crude oil consumed by Croatia was imported from oilfields that INA operated under contract in Angola, Egypt, and Russia. New offshore Adriatic deposits were under development and exploitation through a joint venture with ENI of Italy (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 2001, p. 13). Also, INA's Sisak refinery began to ship petroleum refinery products to Serbia and Montenegro in October shortly after the cancellation of the international embargo. Other developments involved Jadranski Naftovod, d.d. Zagreb (JANAF), in which INA held a 38% stake. In October, JANAF and Russia concluded an agreement that called for Yukos of Russia to participate in the modernization of the Adria pipeline and its linkage with Yukos's Druzhba pipeline, which supplies Central Europe with petroleum. The project would allow Yukos to transport crude petroleum to the port of Omisajl in Croatia for loading onto tankers (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 2001b, p. 13).\n\nCroatia's production of metals was based mainly on domestic and imported secondary raw materials. With the exception of crude steel, the output of which fell by nearly 8%, the production of aluminum semimanufactures (output of primary aluminum declined slightly) and ferroalloys registered recovery in 2000. Ferroalloy (ferrochromium) production resumed following a break in output in 1999.\n\nJadranska Zelejzara Split on the Adriatic coast and SP MK Zeljezare Sisak d.d. in Sisak composed the country's steel industry. Major activities in the iron and steel industry in 2000 included a contract Jadranska awarded to Voest Alpine Industrieanlagenbau of Austria to modernize Jadranska's operations. The renovation of Jadranska would cost about $10 million and include the installation of a new electric arc furnace, a two-stand Concast billet caster, and a rolling mill. The new electric arc furnace, which would replace two older furnaces, was scheduled for startup in September 2001 and would have a design capacity of 81,000 t/yr. Total steel production capacity at Jadranska was to be about 170,000 t/yr (Metal Bulletin, 2000a). Other issues in the steel industry involved the European Union's (EU) imposition of a definitive 23% duty on imports of Croatian seamless pipe and tube in response to findings of dumping by the European Commission. This measure replaced the imposition of a provisional 31.2% duty by the EU in 1999 (Burgert, 2000).\n\nThere was a rise in output in the industrial minerals sector. The cement industry, which helped drive the quarrying of industrial minerals used in construction saw production increase by more than 3% compared with that of 1999. Foreign investment by a United Kingdom-based consortium in Dalmacija Cement, which amounted to $48.01 million, mainly was earmarked to convert operations from fuel oil to coal and petroleum-based coke.\n\nThe outlook for Croatia's economy and minerals industry, as well as for that of the other republics of the former Yugoslavia, is captive to political and social stabilization in the region.\n\n​MACEDONIA\n\nThe Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (Macedonia) showed strong recovery from the economic downturn that followed the Kosovo conflict of 1999. The GDP increased by 5.1% compared with that of 1999. The industrial minerals and construction material branches of industry were major contributors to this rebound, which mainly was caused by demand generated by reconstruction efforts in neighboring Kosovo. Freer access to markets in the EU also helped improve the country's economic performance in 2000 (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 2001, p. 2-5). In 2000, industry and mining accounted for 21.1% of Macedonia's GDP. Compared with that of 1999, the increase in the total value of industrial production exceeded 5%, of which the output of coal, iron and steel, nonferrous ores and metals, and construction materials accounted for 2.1%, 4.3%, 4.8%, and 5.1% respectively (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 2001, p. 12).\n\nThe Government of Macedonia remained committed to developing the country's market economy system as well as promoting foreign investment. In 2000, foreign investment was represented almost in all branches of the minerals industry.\n\nMacedonia produced a range of metals that included copper, ferroalloys, lead, silver, steel products, and zinc. The country's secondary aluminum industry centered on Alumina A.D. in Skopje, which had the capacity to produce 20,000 t/yr of billets and 12,000 t/yr of semimanufactures. The denationalization of major enterprises in the metals branch had important results during the year. The Skopje-based Feni-Rudnici i Industrija za Nikel, Celik i Antimon (FENI), which produced mainly ferronickel, was acquired by Societe Commerciale de Metaux et Mineraux (SCMM) of France for $2.25 million. FENI was 1 of 12 loss-making Macedonian enterprises that were determined to be suitable for closure or sale by the International Monetary Fund. Earlier in the year, Glencore International AG of Switzerland and other commercial enterprises had conducted negotiations with the Government to purchase FENI, which did not prove successful. The terms of SCMM's acquisition of FENI included a purchase price of $2.25 million and a commitment to invest a further $36 million in FENI's operation (Cahners Business Information, 2000; Hope, 2000). The Government of Macedonia also sold 82% of shares of the country's principal mine producer of copper Bucim, Rabotna Organiziacija za Rudarstvo i Metalurgija za Baker's (Bucim) (246,270 shares at $6.06 per share) through the Macedonian Stock Exchange. Bucim operated a mine and mill near Radovis. Other enterprises that were slated for sale or closure included ferroalloy producer Jugohrom, Hemijsko-Elektrometalurski Kombinat and the lead and zinc mining, beneficiation, and smelting complex Prepobotuvacki, Kombinat Zletovo-Sasa (Hope, 2000). Steel was produced at AD Makstil (a subsidiary of Duferco). Duferco had made investments that included upgrading the steel plant's continuous casters and electric arc furnaces and the installation of a ladle furnace. In 2000, Makstil reported that the production of heavy plate exceeded 240,000 t.\n\nMacedonia also produced such industrial minerals as bentonite, feldspar, gypsum, sand and gravel, and stone (carbonate and silicate), as well as cement and other construction materials that were based on domestic quarried products. About 20% of mine output of industrial minerals was consumed domestically; the balance was exported mainly to other Balkan countries, the EU, and Russia. In 2000, important activities in this branch, including its downstream construction materials group, included a planned sale of Mermeren Kombinat Prilep, which was the country's largest producer of marble, to I. Kiriakidis S.A. of Drama, Greece. The Cyprus-based consortium Balkcem Ltd. (comprising Titan Cement S.A. of Greece and Holderbank Group of Switzerland) invested $30.7 million in A.D. Cementarnica USJE (USJE) for facility modernization to reduce costs and to increase environmental protection. To help achieve the latter, Balkcem, which had acquired 86.4% of USJE's shares in 1998, planned to discontinue USJE's production of asbestos and asbestos cement in 2001 (Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, 2000).\n\nCoal and petroleum constituted about 52% and 15%, respectively, of total fuel sources at electric power generators. Most coal (lignite) was from domestic mining; however, all natural gas and petroleum had to be imported. Major foreign investment in the energy sector was accomplished in late 1999 with the purchase of OKTA A.D., Macedonia's sole petroleum refinery. In addition to the $32 million purchase price, Hellenic Petroleum S.A. indicated that it would allocate an additional $40 million for the modernization of the refinery. In December, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development indicated approval of a $50 million loan to help finance the Thessaloniki-Skopje crude petroleum pipeline. The proposed pipeline, which would carry 2.5 Mt/yr of petroleum, was expected to reduce transportation costs of petroleum to Macedonia. Additionally, the proposed pipeline, which would extend from the Greek port of Thessaloniki to its OKTA terminus, was considered to be a better environmental alternative to the existing rail and trucking petroleum delivery route that follows the Vardar River, which also is a wildlife habitat (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 2001, p. 17).\n\nSERBIA AND MONTENEGRO\n\nSerbia and Montenegro began the year facing a major effort to rebuild roads, electric power stations, steel mills, and other industrial plants and infrastructure that had been heavily damaged during the Kosovo conflict of 1999. Additionally, bridges that had been destroyed by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) air campaign remained effective obstacles to normal international freight traffic, which included a significant amount of mineral raw materials, on the Danube River.\n\nDespite continuing economic sanctions imposed by the international community and the loss of effective political and economic control of Kosovo (with resources of nickel, lead, and zinc ores, coal, and production facilities for lead and zinc, ferronickel, and tin-plate, as well as a substantial portion of lignite-producing mines), the economy of Serbia and Montenegro rebounded from the sharp decline of 18% in the GDP in 1999. In 2000, the country's GDP rose by 7%, and industrial production, by 12% compared with those of 1999 (Serbia and Montenegro Federal Statistical Office, 2001, p. 4).\n\nThe yearend results of the minerals industry generally showed improvement in performance compared with those of 1999. The value of output levels attained in 2000 in the mineral fuels branch showed increases of 8%, 11%, and 6% for coal, oil and gas, and oil derivatives, respectively; iron and steel, industrial ​(nonmetallic) minerals, and nonferrous metals branches recorded 152%, 38%, and 7% increases in output, respectively, compared with 1999 production levels (Serbia and Montenegro Federal Statistical Office, 2001, p. 4). A comparison of output with prewar mineral production levels achieved in 1998, however, underscores a far less than full recovery.\n\nThe gross weight of mine output of lead and zinc and copper ores was 52% and 35%, respectively, below respective output levels achieved in 1998; the production of refined lead, silver, copper, and zinc, fell short by 95%, 78%, 52%, and 42%, respectively. In the nonferrous metals branch, only alumina, aluminum, and bauxite operations, which are in Montenegro, registered substantial gains compared with 1998 in terms of physical production levels, largely because of favorable treatment that was accorded to Montenegro's economy by the European Commission. Aluminum, alumina, and aluminum hydroxide were the only products that would be allowed entry into the EU from Serbia and Montenegro duty free (Metal Bulletin, 2000c). To meet prospective export opportunities, Montenegro's Podgorica smelter (managed by Glencore) announced plans to decrease idle capacity at the plant and to lower production costs (Reuters Ltd., 2000a). Such subsidiary semimanufacturing operations as rolling mills, casting plants, and other similar facilities were to be offered for sale during the year (Metal Bulletin, 2000b).\n\nExports of most nonferrous metals and nonferrous metal semimanufactures registered increases in 2000, albeit not at the levels of aluminum and its alloys. Major issues in the nonferrous metals industry remained centered on the Bor and the Trepca mining, beneficiation, smelting, and refining complexes for copper and lead and zinc, respectively. Rudarsko Topionicki Bazen's Bor mining, beneficiation, and smelting complex, which accounted for all of Serbia and Montenegro's mine, smelter, and refinery output of copper production, was the subject of domestic and international scrutiny and concern about the alleged smuggling of gold recovered from copper mining to foreign metals markets (Smith, 2001). Kosovo-based Rudarsko-Metalursko-Hemijski Kombinat za Olovo i Cink Trepca (Trepca), which had operated only the lead plant fed by stockpiled concentrates since resuming operation in July 1999, was seized by NATO forces. According to NATO spokespersons, the objective of the seizure was to bring the smelter into compliance with environmental regulations (Mining Journal, 2000; Reuter Ltd., 2000b). NATO authorities, however, promised to keep and pay the Trepca workforce at their current (2000) salary levels despite a modernization program that could take several years (Maguire, 2000). Trepca also had been a producer of such associated metals as antimony, bismuth, cadmium, gold, and silver.\n\nThe gross weight production, in order of processing, of crude steel, pig iron, and steel semimanufactures fell short of their 1998 production levels by 28%, 32%, and 58%, respectively. In 2000, the Yugoslav Iron and Steel Federation commissioned Usinor Consultants of France to study ways to raise the competitiveness of Serbia and Montenegro's steel industry. As part of an overall rationalization strategy, Usinor urged a rapid privatization of the Sartid AD Smederevo integrated steel mill in Serbia and Zeljezra Niksic AD in Montenegro. Near-term plans for facility expansion at Sartid also included the installation of a 150,000-t/yr galvanizing line and a new continuous caster, as well as a pulverized coal injection system in the No. 2 blast furnace. Plans at Zeljezara Niksic included the installation of a new electric arc furnace, a new continuous casting unit, and a new ladle furnace.\n\nThe situation for industrial and mineral fuels was not dissimilar to that of the metals; most commodities in 2000 were substantially below their 1998 output levels, with the exception of bentonite, brown coal, gypsum, lime, quartz sand, and salt, which showed increases. A negotiated lease by the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo of the Sharr cement plant (near the Macedonian border) to Holderbank Financière Glaris Ltd. was one of the salient events in the industrial minerals branch. Under the terms of the lease, Holderbank would invest about $16.4 million in the Sharr cement plant to modernize production and to institute environmental protection and health and safety standards. The full operation of the 600,000-t/yr Sharr cement plant and attendant quarries, whose production included clay, limestone, and marl, also would help stabilize employment in the region.\n\nAt yearend, striking coal miners in Serbia helped bring about a recognition of election results by the Government. Political and economic stability in the region, however, appears to be a long-term prospect.\n\nSLOVENIA\n\nSlovenia's minerals industry produced a modest range and minor quantities of mineral commodities that included coal, natural gas, petroleum, and a variety of industrial minerals. The country relied heavily on imports of fossil fuels, ferrous and nonferrous ores and metals, and other mining and quarrying products.\n\nWith well-developed systems of transportation and modern telecommunications, Slovenia had one of the more technically advanced industrial bases of the republics of the former Yugoslavia. Chemicals, electronics and telecommunications, and retail were the sectors with highest rates of growth (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 2001, p. 3). In 2000, the performance of the country's economy remained positive, given the increase in the GDP of 4.25% compared with that of 1999; the total value of industrial production rose by 6.2%. The output and fabrication of metals showed combined gains in excess of 12%. The mining and quarrying share of industrial output, however, declined by 2.7%, as did that of industrial mineral products, which declined by 3.6%. Also, a substantial decline of production of processed mineral fuels (primarily coke and petroleum refinery products) was noted.\n\nWith the exception of nonferrous metals, whose value of imports continued to match that of exports, Slovenia depended heavily on imports for almost all mineral commodities. According to the latest available trade data (1999), this dependency, valued in U.S. dollars, increased for most commodity groups in 1999 compared with that of 1998. In 1999, the net value of imports of gold (nonmonetary), metal ores and scrap, and iron and steel increased by 70%, 11.5%, and 1.2%, respectively. Net imports of industrial mineral goods rose by about 5.7%. With respect to mineral fuels, the combined net import value of coal, coal briquettes, and coke increased by about 63%, but that of crude and refined petroleum declined by about 17% compared with those of 1998 (Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia, 2000, p. 390-391).\n\nThe Government continued to promote the country's transition process to a market economy system. The Energy Act ​was adopted in 1999 to promote privatization and stimulate foreign investment in the energy sector. Major activities in the energy sector included a program of modernization at the Krsko nuclear powerplant, which Slovenia jointly owns and operates with neighboring Croatia (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 2001, p. 14).\n\nIn 2000, salient activities in the steel industry included the addition of a new automated quality inspection line at INEXA Store Ltd., which was valued at $1.2 million.[1] INEXA also planned to modernize the plant's rolling mills. SZ Jeklo Store d.o.o. was privatized in 1999 and acquired by INEXA Group of Sweden. Additionally, a new forging line was added at the SZ Ravne d.o.o. steel mill; the new line replaced an older unit to produce bar sections, flat sections, and other products from all grades of steel.\n\nImportant activities in the nonferrous metals industry included the planned facility expansion at Slovenia's aluminum smelter Kidricevo Talum d.o.o. that would increase production capacity to about 155,000 t of primary and secondary aluminum by 2002 from about 100,000 t in 2000. Talum obtained outside financing for the project (a new pot room) that amounted to $76 million in addition to its own capital. Talum also planned to produce 117,000 t of aluminum in 2001 (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, 2001, p. 14).\n\nCement, clays, dimension stone, and silica products were among the industrial minerals produced in Slovenia. Consumption of cement and other construction materials continued to increase, which, in turn, would further increase demand for other industrial minerals as well as for steel and other base metals. If Slovenia should join the EU, then this trend may well accelerate with developmental emphasis being placed on rail and road infrastructure.\n\nReferences cited\n\n​\n\nTABLE 1 ALBANIA, BOSNIA AND
