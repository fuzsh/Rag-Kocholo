        "text": "LONDON, May 12, 2014 /PRNewswire/ --\n\nExisting Infrastructure, Capex & Length Forecasts, Contract Analysis & Leading Company Profiles\n\nPipelines are the most efficient and economical means of transporting oil and gas from where it is extracted to where it will be processed and consumed. Natural resources such as crude oil and natural gas are the raw material for energy consumption that modern society relies upon.
