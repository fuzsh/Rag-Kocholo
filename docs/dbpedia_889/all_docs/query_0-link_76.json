        "text": "After a technical inspection, only minor finishing touches remain in the construction and modernization of the border crossing for international traffic and goods in Tovarnik. During the construction work, traffic at the crossing was more difficult, but the modern border crossing will significantly increase the amount of traffic in travelers and goods, speed up the border-crossing process, and allow for better control. The lead agency and coordinator of all activities was the Sector for the Construction of Border Crossings of Ministry of Finance. The value of the work that was performed was 47.5 million kunas. Upon completion of the work and after obtaining the usage permit, the border crossing will return to full operation.\n\nThe construction of two crude oil tanks for the Omišalj Terminal project is proceeding according to schedule. The project includes two tanks, A-1520 and A-1522, each with a capacity of 80,000 m³ and an accompanying installation for receipt and shipping (based on a contract between Jadranski Naftovod and a consortium of the ĐĐ Group). Work is moving rapidly both on the tanks and the handling pipelines. Hydrostatic testing of the tanks will begin in December.\n\nAfter the successful construction of three tanks on the island of Krk and two tanks in Sisak, another contract has now been signed between Jadranski Naftavod and a consortium of the ĐĐ Group (comprised of Đuro Đaković Industrijska rješenja, Đuro Đaković Specijalna vozila and the company Gradnja Osijek). The contract calls for the construction of two crude oil tanks, A-1520 i A-1522, each with a volume of 80,000m³, with the accompanying safety and supervisory equipment and facilities for receipt and shipping at the Omišalj Terminal. The total value of the work is 163,822,258 kunas. Work on the tanks and the handling pipelines is progressing rapidly.\n\nContract work for the delivery of equipment and the installation of a closed Blowdown system at the KP-4 coking facility at the oil refinery in Sisak has been completed. To modernize the refinery, work was carried out to manufacture and install a variety of equipment (heat exchangers, pressure vessels, columns, compressors, air coolers, pumping stations and the connecting of pipelines). The goal of the modernization of the refinery was to carry out the construction and installation of technical equipment (heat exchangers, pressure vessels, columns, compressors, air coolers, pumping stations, and the connection of pipelines). The work was worth 31.5 million kunas and is now complete. The refinery is now in the testing phase and is awaiting technical inspection and expects to receive a usage permit.\n\nIn the construction of a co-generation power plant for the production of electrical and thermal energy from biomass BE-TO Osijek 3 MWe/10 MWt accelerated work with a total value of 16.25 million euros is taking place and the shape of the future forest biomass power plant can be seen. The investor is the Croatia Electric Power Company (HEP), while a construction consortium is made up of Đuro Đaković Holding and its partner HOST B.V. from the Netherlands. At present, work is being completed on the interior walls in the main building (control rooms, transformer rooms and auxiliary areas). The main building is completely covered with façade panels with built-in openings for windows. In the daytime warehouse the erection of a steel construction and the hanging of façade panels has begun. Final phase engineering works include the installation of the turbine, generator, units for the treatment of feed water, and a condenser for stack gases. A smokestack is now being erected and work to connect the smoke ducts from the condenser to the smokestack is now underway. In the coming weeks, anticipated work includes insulating the furnace and the turbine and installing the remaining equipment (feedwater pumps, compressors and a tank for demineralized water).\n\nWork is underway on the construction of a co-generation power plant for the production of electricity and thermal energy from biomass at BE-TO Sisak 3 MWe/10 MWt, with a total value of 18.95 million euros. The investor is the Croatian Electric Company (HEP), while a consortium for the construction project is made up of Đuro Đaković Holding and its partner HOST B.V. from the Netherlands. At present, work is proceeding on the main operating building, i.e. installing the facade panels, also on the daytime warehouse and construction work on the covered warehouse. Technical work includes the installation of equipment around the boiler (air and smoke channels, the gallery and the steps around the boiler economizer). A tank (999 m³) for demineralized water has been installed next to the building and should be ready today for a hydrostatic test, which will last three days. All key equipment has been delivered except the turbine and generator, which should be at the construction site by 10 August 2016.\n\nConstruction is nearing completion of the permanent border crossing for international travelers and goods traveling by road in Tovarnik, which because of the expansion and construction work has been temporarily closed. The estimated value of the work, which comprises supervisory services, is 47.5 million kunas. The investor is the Republic of Croatia Ministry of Finance. Under the service contract the obligations of ĐĐ IR include: professional, technical and financial supervision during the work, providing services as the coordinator for workplace safety, constant geodetic supervision during the work, control of the testing of material, work in an accredited laboratory in accordance with HRN EN/ISO 17025:2007, and providing advisory and consulting services for the contracted work. Upon completion of the final and transfer works, it is expected that this border crossing will be fully operational.\n\nĐuro Đaković Industrijska rješenja, Inc., part of the Đuro Đaković group, as the provider, and Industrija Nafte, Inc. (INA) signed contract no. 4500480514 on the manufacture and delivery of two columns with the appropriate technical documentation, spare parts for start-up, spare parts for two years of operations, and technical services: the design and drafting of technical documentation for equipment for LPG amine treatment at the Rijeka Oil Refinery. The total value of the contract is 4,562,215 kunas.\n\nAfter the issuance of construction permits for BE-TO Osijek and BE-TO Sisak, work has begun on the construction of co-generation equipment (for the production of electrical and thermal energy). Start-up and testing is expected at the beginning of 2017, after which issuance of the usage permit and the transfer of the equipment is expected.\n\nĐuro Đaković Holding, Inc. as the head of a consortium with the company HoSt B.V. won this business in an international competition. The contract value for BE-TO Osijek is 16.25 million euros and the contract value for BE-TO Sisak is 18.95 million euros. Both facilities will be the first co-generation facilities using forest biomass in the production portfolio of HEP and also the first power plants of this type un the HEP Group, which will have the status of an authorized producer of energy from renewable sources and co-generation, as a result of which it will be issued an energy approval.\n\nA heat accumulator for TE-TO Zagreb is finished, and will now be followed by a final cmpletion test, registration for technical inspection, preparation for transfer, and trials.\n\nThe overall work on the construction of the heat accumulator (750MWh, 150MW) and the reconstruction of the heat system in was performed by the joint contractors, members of the Đuro Đaković Group and MontMontaža-Oprema. The construction and installation of this equipment include: a heat accumulator, pumping stations, steel heating pipes, air lines and steam lines."
