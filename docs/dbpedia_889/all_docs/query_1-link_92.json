        "text": "Croatian electrical, transport and energy company KONČAR has just turned 100 years old.\n\nIn 100 years of doing business, KONČAR has delivered products and services to almost 130 markets worldwide.\n\n“We have delivered 400,000 transformers of various types, voltage levels and power outputs to all continents, constructed and reconstructed 375 hydropower plants, manufactured and revitalised 700 generators, and manufactured and delivered 180 low-floor trams and trains,” says Gordan Kolak, President of KONČAR’s Management Board.\n\nThe company’s history began on January 24 in 1921 when the company Elektra was founded, which the same year became the property of Siemens group and operated under this name until the end of the Second World War.\n\nFrom 1946 to 1990 the company operated under the name of “Rade Končar”, and as of January 1, 1991, is organized as a joint stock company and operates under the name KONČAR – Electrical Industry.\n\nThe development from the workshop to the concern of the electrical industry is marked by the delivery of the first electric engine with lacquer wire (1930) and the first generator made by the company (1948), which is initiated the unstoppable development.\n\nToday, the name of KONČAR is recognised around the world as well as being a synonym for high level of quality and reliability.\n\nBack in November 2020, the first 100% low-floor electric tram left KONČAR – Electric Vehicles’ factory, making its way to the city of Liepāja in Latvia, where it will be used for public transport.\n\nThis was the first time their trams left Croatia and broke into the EU market.\n\nKONČAR will also deliver 21 commuter and regional electric trains to Croatian Rail worth €112.62 million.\n\n“We expect that KONČAR will continue to grow in exports, that we will achieve better results in all segments and that our exports will be 60 percent of total revenue. The key market is the European Union, but in the long run we are also counting on the African market,” pointed out Kolak."
