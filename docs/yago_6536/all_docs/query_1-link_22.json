        "text": "Yilmaz Guney, a film maker who directed ''Yol'' from his cell in a Turkish prison and then escaped to edit the movie and see it win top honors at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival, died of stomach cancer in a Paris hospital yesterday, his family announced. He was 47 years old.\n\n''Yol,'' or ''The Trek of Life,'' shared top honors with Costa-Gavras's ''Missing.'' ''Yol,'' which depicted Turkey as a big prison, was also shown in the 1982 New York Film Festival. Mr. Guney said he directed most of ''Yol'' from Toptashi prison. He was serving a 19- year term after being convicted of the murder of a magistrate. He said he was innocent. He had been jailed from 1960 to 1962 on political charges. During that term he wrote a novel about poor peasants in southern Turkey, ''They Died with Their Heads Bowed,''\n\nMr. Guney tangled with the authorities by championing Kurdish and leftist causes. He was one of six children in a Kurdish family from Adana in southeastern Turkey.\n\nHe directed three films from prison. He wrote the screenplays there and attended to the casting and filming through couriers. His Turkish films included ''Hope'' and ''The Herd.'' All of his films were box-office successes."
