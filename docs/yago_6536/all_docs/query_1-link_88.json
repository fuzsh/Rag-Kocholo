        "text": "Maybe you all know already but there are the 2 Zagor movies on DVD\n\nZagor: Kara bela (Zagor: The black danger)\n\nZagor karakorsanin hanzineleri (Zagor: The gold of black pirate)\n\nThey have been released in DVD by Horizon International in Turkey (with italian and english subtitles) as well as by Onar Films in Greece (with english subtitles only)\n\nZagor is a popular italian pre-western comic book…actually the adventures are set around 1830, but it’s just mere reference as most of the stories deal with gunfighters, indians, blue soldiers…\n\nThere is a 3rd Zagor movie, simply called “Zagor” but it has nothing to do with the comic book…it’s a simple, plain western\n\nAnother italian comic book made onto a movie is Kaptain Swing (in Italy: Il Comandante Mark). It has been announced by Onar Movies but the guy behind the label sufferend some physical problems.\n\nThere are other titles shot after comic books in Turkey…a second Kaptain Swing adventure (actually shot before, in 1964 according to an interview with…I forgot who…it’s on an Onar Movie DVD),\n\n“Red Kit Daltonlara karsi” is actually “Lucky Luke against the Daltons”, from the same french comic book\n\nAlso “Simdi silah konusacak/Pecos Bill” should be based more on the italian comic book of the 50’s than on the eponymous american carachter\n\nI think the “Dizionario of spaghetti western” should list every kebab western ever released, though of some titles there isn’t more than a short cast info.\n\nIn any case only the 2 “original” Zagor are the only 2 western ever available on DVD in Turkey until now"
