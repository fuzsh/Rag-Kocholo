        "text": "AlÄ±nak said, \"It is obvious that he acted with the aim of humiliating YÄ±lmaz GÃ¼ney, who has gained the love and respect of a significant segment of the society.\" While it was stated that GÃ¼ney was an artist who left his mark on the history of Turkish cinema as a screenwriter, actor and director, it was stated that ÃzdaÄ was committed as follows: \"It is clear beyond doubt that the crimes of insulting the memory of a person, inciting the public to hatred and hostility, or humiliating people were committed.\"\n\n'Protection of a cinema genius who left his mark on the history of Turkish cinema and the values he represents'\n\nThe following was stated in the criminal complaint: \"YÄ±lmaz GÃ¼ney is the director who started the realism movement in the history of cinema with his film Umut in 1971. He was a pioneering personality who stood on the side of the oppressed people during the events, fought for the brotherhood of the peoples and showed himself for equality, and created respect in the world cinema. For this reason, some dark circles have deemed it their duty to make a futile effort to cast a shadow over YÄ±lmaz GÃ¼ney's reputation. The suspect's criminal action should also be evaluated from this perspective. Because the punishment and consequences of the criminal act should not be considered as a simple crime of insult. Here, the aim should be to protect a world-famous cinema genius who left his mark on the history of Turkish cinema and the values he represents. For this reason, it is of utmost importance that the prosecutor's office acts with the fact that it must protect social values and the personal rights of the deceased while conducting the investigation.â\n\n'ÃzdaÄ committed the crime of inciting the public to hatred and hostility'\n\nAtty. emphasized that Ãmit ÃzdaÄ committed the crime of inciting the public to hatred and hostility. In his criminal complaint petition, AltÄ±nak noted the following: âIt is known to the public that the suspect also committed similar actions against other people who have won the love of a significant segment of the society. Although he knew it was a crime, the suspect, who did not refrain from insulting people while expressing his thoughts and disregarded the laws, committed the crime of inciting the public to hatred and hostility by revealing his hatred towards a significant segment of the society through the late YÄ±lmaz GÃ¼ney. The legislator stated that the determination of the crime of insult should be based on the prevailing views, customs and traditions in the society. It is clear that the words spoken by the suspect are unacceptable in terms of concepts, customs and traditions. The punishment of the suspect, who disregarded social sensitivities and aimed to humiliate and humiliate the late YÄ±lmaz GÃ¼ney in front of the society, is also of great importance in terms of preventing similar actions from being repeated. Because it is highly probable that similar crimes will be committed by other people through this action of the suspect, who has the potential to spread his thoughts in his capacity as a member of parliament. It is also of great social importance that the suspect who provokes a certain segment of the society is punished and rehabilitated.â\n\nGÃ¼ney Family's lawyer, BiÅar Abdi AltÄ±nak, demanded that an investigation be initiated against ÃzdaÄ and a report prepared, and that a lawsuit be filed if his immunity is lifted. ."
