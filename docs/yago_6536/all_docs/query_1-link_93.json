        "text": "A cousin (not seated at Yılmaz’s table, but who claimed to have been idling in the background) stated that he had committed the murder to protect his famous relation, but the courts did not give this much credence.[38] Issues of what gun and which bullets had been used also clouded the issue.[39] Yet, when the trial finally concluded in 1976, Yılmaz was sentenced to nineteen years in jail.\n\nAs far as jail can be, Yılmaz’s first four years seem to have been rather pleasant. Turkey’s permissive furlough policies meant that he could visit his family periodically and was even allowed to supervise the production of the films he continued writing. As late as September 1980 he was still throwing parties for his fellow prisoners on Imralı Island.[40] Despite his conviction for murdering a state official, the government was even willing to engage with him on a professional basis. Case in point: following the release of Midnight Express, an American film that depicted Turkish prisons as hellholes, the government agreed to support Yılmaz in making a film to counter that image.[41]\n\nThe film was to be called “Holiday” and focus on the benefits of the furlough system. Giving its propaganda purpose, the newly (self) appointed military regime threw its support behind the production, even allowing soldiers to work security detail for the crew when filming in the volatile southeast. Yılmaz, meanwhile, maintained close control over the production, writing the scripts, selecting directors, and watching dailies. Unbeknownst to the authorities, however, he was having copies of the film shipped to Sweden.\n\nOn November 9, 1981, Yılmaz left prison on a six-day furlough to see his mother in the eastern city of Muş. Instead, he headed south and on November 12, escaped to the Greek island of Rhodes in a small fishing boat. From there, Athens; then Paris, then Marseilles, finally arriving in Zurich five days later before, ultimately, returning to France when the Swedish government refused to grant him asylum.[42]\n\nBeyond the reach of the Turkish state, he reedited the “Holiday” film project into something altogether different and deeply critical of the regime in Turkey. The result was The Road, a film following five furloughed prisoners as they slowly realize that beyond the prison walls, all of Turkey has become one great spiritual prison.[43]\n\nBesides being a harsh indictment of the current regime by an escaped felon, the movie also angered Turkish authorities for its inclusion of Kurdish dialogue and the term “Kurdistan.” Unsurprisingly, the film—and, ultimately, all Yılmaz Güney films—were banned in Turkey. Undeterred, he submitted the film to the 1982 Cannes Film Festival where it received top honors alongside a film by Costa-Gravras, a left-wing Greek director. Yılmaz dramatically showed up to accept the award. After repeated efforts to extradite him had failed, the Turkish government stripped away his citizenship and added another seven and a half years to his sentence for an article he had written two years earlier, which was determined to be “communist propaganda.”[44]\n\nDuring the following two years, with financial support from the French government, Yılmaz produced one more film, The Wall, focusing on the state of Turkish children’s prisons. Besides the bleak subject matter, the film caused additional controversy when it came to light that Yılmaz was slapping child actors on set in the interests of achieving his desired “realism.” He also “scandalized the leftist community in France” by associating with Elia Kazan, the Turkish-born director of On the Waterfront, still persona non grata in left-wing circles for having named names during the McCarthy hearings. [45] Whether these faux pas would have hurt his subsequent film career in France was mooted by his battle with stomach cancer—a battle that he lost on September 9, 1984 in a Paris hospital.\n\n[BACK TO CONTENTS]\n\n*\n\nThirty years after his death, Yılmaz Güney remains incredibly popular in Turkey. Though the Yeşilçam-era of high theater attendance has faded since the mid-seventies due to the spread of television, his films continue to be rerun on the newly dominant medium. His ban for many years expanded his symbol from one of manliness and the marginalized into one of resistance as well.[46] Leftists hang posters of him alongside those of Deniz Gezmiş, the other great Turkish symbol of rebellion. For Kurdish activists, his poster (alongside Ahmet Kaya perhaps) is also de rigueur.\n\nBut, as the foregoing account of his life suggests, Yılmaz Güney, the man, seldom lived up to Yılmaz Güney, the symbol. Despite his careful attention to molding his own myth, his actions were often confusing symbolically. He lived a life full of thrill seeking and lavish, prodigal spending—in short, living it up in a society whose social order he claimed was demonstrably unfair. He decried censorship, but attended banquets and award ceremonies hosted by the military regime. He appeared in patriotic, anti-Greek films and donated award money to military charities.[47] He treated women in his life terribly and inhabited roles that valorized some of the more misogynistic tendencies in Turkish culture . . .\n\nThen again, the demand for consistency—the demand that art and life mirror opinion—is consistently thrown at performers. Whether it be Sean Penn, Barbara Streisand, or some other impassioned celebrity, the failure to live one’s own rhetoric is always used to devalue and dismiss the arguments themselves. Such logic may set the bar too high for actors who, at day’s end, are simply trying to make sense of the world like everyone else—albeit from a more public position. It has been argued—specifically in relation to Turkish stars, but likely true elsewhere—that audiences personalize stars, relating to them as one does family and friends.[48] And viewed from such a perspective, Yılmaz’s failure to live up to his ideals becomes less egregious—certainly more understandable.\n\nMuch like fellow left-wing icon Nazim Hikmet, Yılmaz’s vision of leftism could be dubbed “romantic”—or, as one critic put it, “the stuff of populist melodrama.”[49] Like so many other inhabitants of Turkey, he grew up poor, in a violent, patriarchal environment; though he perceived the system around him to be unfair, the moral universe that he valued did not always allow him to break with his own contradictory habits—violence clearly reinforced the world’s inequalities, but it also seemed to make a man a man. Saints aside, this degree of confusion is the case for most people and, intuiting this, his fans have looked past his lapses and identify with him.\n\nAs the father of Yılmaz’s seventeen-year-old fiancé scoffed upon first seeing pictures of him, “There’s a hundred guys like him in my factory.”[50]\n\nIndeed.\n\n[BACK TO CONTENTS]\n\n[1] “Yılmaz Güney, Adana’da bir yargıcı öldürdü,” Milliyet, 9/15/74, pp. 1, 11; “Yılmaz Güney “Cinayet Sucundan” Tutuklandi,” Milliyet, 9/16/14, pp. 1, 10; “GÜNEY,’HAKİMİ BEN ÖLDÜRMEDİM’ DEDİ,” Milliyet, 10/26/74.\n\n[2] Examples: Ali Cemali (King of Cinemas), Orhan Gunsiray (King of Adventure), Hayri Ipar (King of Sugar), Ozturk Serengil (King of Twist), İlham Gencer (King of Dance Orchestra), Adem Cavdar and Hasan Kazankaya (King of Night Clubs), Erkut Taçkın (King of Ye Ye), Suleyman Sirri Prodan (King of Harassing Tough Guys), Musevi Yasef Kalavra (King of Beggars), Metin Okay (King of Goals), and Fahrettin Arslan (King of Casinos) [listed in Turhan Feyizoğlu, Yılmaz Güney: Bir Çirkin Kral, Istanbul Ozan Yayıncılık, 2011, p. 123].\n\n[3] Though, as Michael Reynolds points out in his discussion of Russia’s occupation of Anatolia, the Russian army often attempted to treat populations in the region equally, resulting in tensions between it and local allies seeking to gain an upper hand (“The Ottoman Russian Struggle for Eastern Anatolia and the Caucasus, 1908-1918: Identity, Ideology, and the Geopolitics of World Order,” Unpublished Thesis, Princeton University, 2003, pp. 258-95).\n\n[4] Turhan Feyizoğlu, Yılmaz Güney: Bir Çirkin Kral, Istanbul Ozan Yayıncılık, 2011, pp. 20-22. A perusal of the footnotes will make clear that much of this essay leans on Feyizoğlu’s book. Like other books by the author, this work is vital in that it collects anecdotes and facts that can be found in no other single volume. Unfortunately, it is organized by topic rather than chronology and is prone to listing—which make it hard to follow.\n\n[5] Feyizoğlu, p. 69.\n\n[6] For an interesting economic history of the Adana region, see Meltem Toksöz, Nomads, Migrants and Cotton in the Eastern Mediterranean: The Making of the Adana-Mersin Region 1850-1908, Leiden: Brill, 2010.\n\n[7] For whatever reason, Adana and the surrounding region was also home to a thriving film award culture; by 1965 İskenderun, Adana, and Gaziantep were all holding film festivals and award ceremonies (Feyizoğlu, p. 163).\n\n[8] “Çirkin Kral mitosu,” NTV-MSNBC, 11/18/?.\n\n[9] Feyizoğlu, p. 321.\n\n[10] Students were generally—then and now—opposed to the government and its representatives.

Even at the time of the judge’s murder, he had asserted that he had many enemies—precisely the reason he had brought a gun to the casino that fateful night (“Yılmaz Güney’in ağır yaralanan yeğeni öldü,” Milliyet, 7/8/81, p. 8).\n\n[39] “GÜNEY,’HAKİMİ BEN ÖLDÜRMEDİM’ DEDİ,” Milliyet, 6/5/75, p. 1, 10.\n\n[40] Turan Aksoy, “Imralı’da hükümlü moral günü,” Milliyet, 9/1/80.\n\n[41] There are suggestions that Midnight Express was funded with Greek money in a conscious effort to make Turkey look bad (Feyizoğlu, p. 215).\n\n[42] His reason for escape (beside the fact that he denied the charges) was: “My life and work conditions had reached a truly impossible point. For a time, I had tried to make films, but then my films and books were banned; this narrowing pressure opened the way for my escape” (Feyizoğlu, 230).\n\n[43] Or, as a narration added by the American studio Columbia in order to contextualize Turkish cinema for American audiences put it: “This time, however, the prison is more inescapable and more oppressive. It is constituted by the political hegemony of the dominant classes or by feudal oppression. One by one, the prisoners are hit hard by the fact that they have been released from a small prison into a larger one” (Asuman Suner, “Speaking the experience of political oppression with a masculine voice: Making feminist sense of Yilmaz Güney’s Yol, Social Identities, 4(2), June 1998).\n\n[44] “YILMAZ GÜNEY CEM KARACA Yılmaz Güney ile Cem Karaca vatandaşlıktan çıkarıldı,” Milliyet, 1/7/83, p.1; “Yılmaz Güney, gıyabında 7.5 yıl hapse mahkûm oldu,” Milliyet, 3/18/83, p. 9.\n\n[45] Both controversies are mentioned in Arslan, p. 14. Video of Yılmaz slapping child actors was recorded in the documentary Duvarın Etrafında—watch the first five minutes, for example.\n\n[46] The ban on his work was finally lifted fully in June 1991 (“Yılmaz Güney’in filmlerine özgürlük Yasaklı eserler artık serbest,” Milliyet, 6/15/91, p. 1).\n\n[47] Feyizoğlu, p. 185, 190.\n\n[48] Dilek Kaya Mutlu, “Between Tradition and Modernity: Yeşilçam Melodrama, its Stars, and their Audiences,” Middle Eastern Studies, 46(3), May 2010.\n\n[49] Bilge Ebiri, “Yılmaz Güney,” Senses of Cinema, October 2005."
