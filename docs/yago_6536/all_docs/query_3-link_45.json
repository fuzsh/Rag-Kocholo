        "text": "PROBABLY no Turkish film has had the worldwide impact of Yilmaz Guney's ''Yol,'' a harrowing look at what is portrayed as a land of harsh military rule and feudal codes.\n\nAt the 1982 Cannes International Film Festival, ''Yol'' shared the top award, the Palme d'Or, with the Costa-Gavras classic ''Missing,'' becoming the only Turkish film to win such a high international honor. It had a long run in the United States and instilled in many viewers a sense that Turkey was a backward and frightening place.\n\nOne friend of mine who saw it told me that it had rid her of any desire ever to go to Turkey. Another was so distraught that she drove her car into a tree on the way home from the movie, emerging uninjured but severely shaken.\n\nUntil now, however, most Turks have had no chance to see ''Yol.'' Guney, a Kurdish nationalist, was in prison when the film was made according to his script and instructions. When he appeared on stage to claim his award in Cannes, he was an escapee wanted by the Turkish police. The clenched fist he raised upon receiving his award was a symbol of defiance as well as triumph; he died two years later.\n\n''Yol'' was banned by the military Government that held power in Turkey in the early 1980's. Civilians returned to power in 1983, and the ban on ''Yol'' was lifted in 1992, but for a variety of technical and financial reasons it is only now being shown publicly here. A new print has been prepared, and since February it has been drawing big crowds at dozens of theaters around the country. At the Istanbul Film Festival this month, three more of Guney's films will be shown, all with new prints that the Turkish Government paid to make for a festival of Turkish cinema held in Paris in 1996.\n\nThe long-delayed release of ''Yol'' has provoked much comment here. Despite the fact that Guney was a devastating critic of Turkish society and an ethnically assertive Kurd, remarkably little of the comment has been negative. Most has focused on the quality of Guney's films and his achievement in bringing Turkish cinema to world attention.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
