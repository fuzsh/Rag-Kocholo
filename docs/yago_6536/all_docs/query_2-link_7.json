You can install the BrowZine app and create a custom Bookshelf of your favorite journal titles. Then you will get the Table of Contents (ToCs) of your favorite journals automatically delivered to you when they become available. Once you have the ToC's, you can download and read the articles you want from the journals for which we have subscriptions.\n\nYou can get the app from the App Store or Google Play.\n\nDon't own or use a mobile device? You can still use BrowZine! It's also available in a web version. You can get to it here. The web version works the same way as the app version. Find the journals you like, create a custom Bookshelf, get ToCs and read the articles you want.\n\nDuring the period leading up to and including World War I, Turkey was largely dependent on films imported from France. Domestic film production was limited to a handful of short propaganda documentaries made by the military, including Ayastefanos’taki Rus Abidesinin Yιkιlιşι‎/The Demolition of the Russian Monument at St Stephan (1914), which is claimed to be the first Turkish film. The earliest locally produced feature films, Pençe/The Claw and Casus/The Spy were both directed by Sedat Simavi and released in 1917. When Turkey became a secular republic in 1923 feature film production began on a very small scale. Worthy of note are two production companies—Ipek Film and Kemal Film—and the work of German-trained theatre director Muhsin Ertuğrul, who adapted popular Turkish and European plays and remade foreign films. Ertuğrul was a prominent figure in Turkish cinema, directing thirty-six films between 1919 and 1953, including İstanbul sokaklarι‎n/The Streets of Istanbul (1931), Turkey’s earliest synchronized sound film. ...\n\nKuhn, A., & Westwell, G.
