        "text": "Introducing a special section of articles, ‘Hunger and History,’ a letter from Managing Editor James F. Fixx, mentions problems with the Green Revolution’s high yield grains, and the New Alchemy Institute’s attempts to find alternative methods of agriculture.\n\nIn ‘The Persistence of Famine,’ J.H. Plumb writes:\n\nIt is hard for us to believe that famine used to sweep through the towns and villages of Western Europe almost every decade, garnering the young, the old, the weak. Europe, indeed has known an abundance of food for a very short time, far shorter than America. Indeed, apart from Australia and New Zealand and a few tiny underpopulated parts of the world, the United States is the only society in human history to lack the traumatic experience famine…\n\nObserved in the light of the past, the prognostications are not good. Famine will stalk the world for the foreseeable future. And yet we should not be entirely without hope. The potentials for increased food production are not exhausted, and they are the preoccupation of highly intelligent men backed by government resources to an extent hitherto unknown. At least the problem is not left to Fortuna, the fairy godmother of famine. The horrors of Africa, the hideous pictures of starving Indians, these should not blind us to the fact that the world’s largest population, the Chinese, have not suffered severe famine for a decade or more – a miracle by the standards of the past. And it is not impossible that these more desperate times may provoke a greater effort, a more relentless fight against one of the oldest enemies of man.\n\nWhat we can be sure of is that the dream of plenty is over. It was scarcely ever more than an illusion. Man’s drive to breed, so necessary for survival in a world of pestilence, war, and famine, becomes in a world of increasing supplies and improving health the procreator of the evils it formerly surmounted. In the seeds of birth lie the harvest of death.\n\nIn ‘A Life in the Theatre’, Stanley Kauffman tells the story of the English actor, director, playwright and critic Harley Granville Barker and his groundbreaking productions of Shakespeare in the early 20th century:\n\nIn 1970 the Royal Shakespeare Company came to New York with Peter Brook’s production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, which was hailed as revolutionary. In some ways that was true, but what was generally unknown was that Brook’s production was in a revolutionary tradition, a tradition begun before World War I by the English director Harley Granville Barker. ‘Barker’s productions at the Savoy from 1912 to 1914,’ Robert Speaight has written in Shakespeare on the Stage, ‘looked ahead in a pretty straight line to Peter Brook’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream at Stratford more than fifty years later.’ For it was Barker who pioneered in stripping Shakespearean production of nineteenth-century scenic and musical baggage.\n\nHe eventually broke with his friend and mentor George Bernard Shaw, after the end of his marriage to Lillah McCarthy, and left both the theatre and England:\n\nOf Barker’s brief returns to the theatre, the chief one was the ten days he spent, at John Gielgud’s invitation, attending rehearsals of the latter’s King Lear production in 1940. Gielgud devotes a chapter to this experience in his autobiography Stage Directions and says: ‘[Barker] had only ten days to work with us on King Lear, but they are the fullest in experience that I have ever had in all my years on the stage.’ To read Barker’s preface to King Lear is to read intellectual exegesis at its most practical, a theatre mind intent on exploring the text with performance as its imperative. To read the nine pages of notes that Gielgud made of Barker’s specific suggestions for voice and movement – Gielgud gives them as an appendix – is to glimpse the theatrical gifts that underlay the essayist’s gifts. To read both is to perceive the breadth of the man and the extent of the loss in his virtual retirement from a directing career at the age of thirty-eight.\n\n…He wrote to Gielgud in 1937 that he had pinned his faith to the establishing of a permanent national theatre and ‘finding it…no go, I got out.’\n\nThe tragedy of the English theatre was that it could not give the right home to an artist of Barker’s vision…in the library of his Paris apartment he was ‘directing’ on paper, putting into his Shakespearean and other essays the force and wisdom that might have gone into the establishment of a history-making theatre.\n\nThe oddity is that he nevertheless did make history; that, despite his disproportioned career, he has had a huge influence, seen and unseen: on those who knew from whom they were learning and on those who learned from him whether they knew it or not…Whenever we see a director concerned with unity of concept, a company concerned with authenticity of style and the idea of a permanent ensemble, we can know that they are in some degree the progeny of Barker. Whenever we see a university supporting a professional theatre and professional training, we can know that the program is to some integral extent the result of Barker’s The Exemplary Theatre. As for Shakespeare scholarship, few competent Shakespeareans would deny the vitality that Barker pumped into that body.\n\nIn ‘The Invention of Politics’, Lionel Casson writes about how democracy came into being in Ancient Greece:\n\nIn its very infancy democracy developed the uncherubic features so familiar today – the machinations of pressure groups and manipulation of voters, the stuffing of ballot boxes, the excesses of soapbox oratory. Indeed, that is what Greek writers harp on: coming chiefly from the ranks of the well-born or well-heeled, they took a dim view of a political system that put them on a par with every Athenian Tom, Dick and Harry…\n\nWhatever ostracism’s original purpose was, politicians found it a useful way of disposing of rivals. Themistocles himself got his bitter enemy, the incorruptible Aristides the Just, ostracized. Ten years later, it was his turn. Not long ago archaeologists excavating a well on a slope of the Acropolis came upon almost two hundred ostraca inscribed ‘Themistocles,’ each written in the same handwriting. Obviously his opponents had prepared them for distribution, like the canned telegrams and letters we are handed today to send to our congressmen. Apparently they were not completely successful, and, to get rid of the ostraca that were left, they dumped them into the well. When they finally did manage to ostracize him, mere banishment was not enough: they condemned him as a traitor to boot.\n\nPeople often refer to the age of Pericles as an age of miracles. They have in mind Athens’ superlative cultural accomplishments…There is one more miracle of a different order to add to the list: it was the age when a miscellaneous mass of Athenians learned the discipline and responsibility to run their state, history’s first and last example of a body of citizens collectively and directly taking part in ruling not only themselves but a far-flung empire. And it was no flash in the pan, for it went on for a quarter of a century, until defeat in the long-drawn-out duel with Sparta brought an oligarchical government to power and put an end to democracy.\n\nIn ‘Queen Victoria and Her World’, Victoria’s biographer Elizabeth Longford explores the vast changes that took place during her reign.\n\nTaking a wider view of her and her world, she was also typically Victorian in the contradictions that Freud has brought to light. Psychoanalysis finds that overweening self-confidence is usually a sign of hidden anxieties. Victoria undoubtedly concealed a palpitating heart beneath the formidable exterior. In this she surely represented her age. Compact of powerful, ponderous well-being, her world already felt in its bones the damp, raw air of change. At her passing, those fears rose to the surface and broke in huge waves of tribal grief.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThis issue’s cover shows an unfinished portrait bust believed to be of the Egyptian Pharaoh Akhenaten’s queen Nefertiti. It illustrates ‘The Maverick Pharaoh’ by Lionel Casson, which chronicles how Akhenaten created a religious revolution by introducing monotheistic worship of the sun god Aten.\n\nImagine a museum wall lined with royal portraits in the formal, traditional manner of Vandyke or Velázquez – and right in the center, a portrait that looks as if it had been done by Picasso or Rouault. Imagine a wall lined with old-fashioned, ceremonious court scenes, a king in full regalia seated in majesty on his throne, graciously receiving courtiers, or solemnly leading a procession – and right in the center, a picture of them munching on a chop or cooing over a baby. This is the effect of the portraits and court scenes of Pharaoh Amenhotep IV, or Akhenaten, to use the name he preferred, who ruled Egypt from about 1378 to 1362 B.C. None of his predecessors had ever commissioned their like, no successor ever would.\n\nThe problem has intrigued and baffled historians. For over a century they have juggled the bits and pieces of Egyptian history in an effort to arrive at an answer. The discoverers of the first examples of these outré portrayals were convinced they were dealing with representations of a woman. When the deciphering of the inscriptions revealed beyond any doubt that the subject was a pharaoh, Auguste Mariette, the great French Egyptologist, suggested that perhaps the poor fellow had been captured while campaigning in the Sudan and castrated, with the effects visible in his portraits – a suggestion that, as a recent historian put it, shows all ‘the vivid imagination one would expect of one of the librettists of Aida.’ As more scraps of information were collected, they began to add up to something far more significant, a bizarre chapter in Egyptian history. Akhenaten, it seems, alone among twenty-six dynasties of pharaohs whose rule spanned two and a half millenniums, was an iconoclastic religious reformer.\n\nEarly in his reign…he began to evince a marked disinterest in the dynasty’s favorite, Amon, and marked interest in the sun god, Re, particularly in the deity’s visible manifestation, the radiant disk, or Aten, to give its Egyptian name. In doing so he was on well-trodden ground, venturing into nothing unorthodox: the cult of Re had started a thousand years before the young king was born, and his father and grandfather had even transformed the Aten itself into a divinity and offered worship to it. But his attachment obviously went a good deal further. After some six years on the throne, he took the dramatic step of changing his name from Amenhotep, ‘Amon is Satisfied’, to Akhenaten, ‘The Effective Spirit of Aten,’ and took an even more dramatic step by moving away from Thebes and out of the shadow of the awesome temples of Amon. About 250 miles farther down the Nile, at a place now called Tell el Amarna, he built a whole new city for his particular divine favorite, dubbing it Akhetaten , ‘The Horizon of Aten.’\n\nCasson sums up the differing views of Akhenaten presented by Egyptologists James Henry Breasted, John A. Wilson, Cyril Aldred, and F.J. Giles, and concludes:\n\n…[B]arring a phenomenal piece of luck and any stray bits of information that archaeology may produce, we very likely will never know much more about Akhenaten than we do now. The answer to the seductive question of what made him a maverick will remain forever unknown. Was he an inspired visionary? convinced but misguided reformer? megalomaniac? madman? Take your pick – or, if you prefer, wait for further choices. That these will be forthcoming is the one sure thing.\n\nAlso in this issue:\n\nIn a special section, ‘The Future Isn’t What It Used To Be’, seven writers examine ‘the future’ as a concept: ‘Where did the idea come from anyway? What did an ancient Sumerian think about the future? When did it become something to do something about? How silly can it get? What do historians think about it?’ The letter from Managing Editor Shirley Tomkievicz quotes Alvin Toffler ‘a founder and nurturer of the modern futurist movement, and – readers will recall – twice a contributor to HORIZON’:\n\nIf we do not learn from history, we shall be compelled to relive it. True. But if we do not change the future, we shall be condemned to endure it. And that could be worse.\n\nThe section features illustrations by Saul Steinberg:\n\nIn ‘The Hindsight Saga: A Sampling of Historic Surprises’, J.H. Plumb writes:\n\nIt was one of Lenin’s more inspired insights that history always has the capacity to surprise…\n\nFor the historian, who never, or very rarely, experiences the events about which he writes, there is no initial shock, no immediate sense of surprise. By his very training a hunter of causes, he prefers not only to reduce chance to a minimum, but to plot the tides that sweep men and societies to their destined ends, forgetting that tides can suddenly break old barriers in a matter of hours and sweep through to new channels. And yet, unless we grasp that the historical processes can always take men and their societies by surprise, we shall fail to understand our own immediate dangers, or – indeed – our opportunities.\n\nHe gives examples of historical surprises: the French Revolution, the rise of Christianity and Islam, the rise of science, and the abolition of slavery, and concludes:\n\nIndeed, for a historian who can establish himself in the past and not the future, the world’s development is full of surprises: in religion, in politics, in social attitudes, there are sudden, almost electrifying, shifts and changes that would, were they grasped, make historically-minded commentators more wary of their confident prognostications. One particular instance is the doom-laden voice of the modern demographer forecasting standing room only on this planet in another hundred years or so – a fashion, too, among scientists ignorant of history. They thoughtlessly expected population to grow in a straight line, as it were, ever upward. The slightest knowledge of the history of population would have taught them that population growth and population decline occur very oddly.\n\n…To a perceptive historian, there would be nothing remarkable in the idea of Detroit buried under a mountain of rubble, not through natural disaster, but because it ceased to be. Nor should the automobile going the way of the coach-and-six raise a historical eyebrow.\n\nIn ‘On Mythic Shapes of Things to Come – Circular and Linear’ Joseph Campbell contrasts two ways of seeing the future:\n\n…[The] first, the older, sees an unending series of irreversibly declining cycles ever and again renewed; and the second, a singular world-creation, once perfect but corrupted and to be restored – both views prophesying final disaster.\n\nHe conjectures that\n\n…perhaps the search of our own scientists into a world more wondrous than the merely visible one will awaken within us latent dreams of a new destiny-image – a myth equivalent to the hundreds of thousands, even hundreds of millions, of years that may lie ahead of this ‘Spaceship Earth’ before the miracle of its star expires and the rapture of its cycling ends.\n\nIf so, those two mythic models of destiny that in the bounded past controlled our thoughts and lives have already been left behind.\n\nIn ‘Empress Victoria’, Theo Aronson writes about Queen Victoria’s eldest daughter, her marriage to the Prussian Prince Friedrich (briefly Kaiser) and struggles with Bismarck:\n\nThe blame for the crown prince and princess’s unhappy position, however, was not all Bismarck’s. At least some of the fault was theirs. Prince Friedrich, despite the soldierly magnificence of his appearance, was a weak man – fretful, irresolute, easily depressed. Nor was he quite the dedicated liberal Albert had assumed. ‘He is not born a free Englishman,’ explained Vicky to her mother, ‘and all Prussians have not the feeling of independence and love of justice and constitutional liberty they ought to have…’ A dutiful son, he hated opposing his father. A patriot, he could not help delighting in Bismarck’s aggrandizement of Prussia. A proud Hohenzollern, he looked forward to becoming Kaiser of the triumphant new Reich.\n\nVicky was very different. No-one could doubt the strength of her character or beliefs. Short, plump, and high-colored now, her hair neatly braided into a coronet, her clothes simple, she could have been mistaken for a sensible, middle-class Prussian Hausfrau. But Vicky read widely and had a keen mind. And, in the Berlin of her day, when women were expected to confine themselves to Küche, Kinderstube, Krankenstube und Kirche – kitchen, nursery, sickroom, and church – she was remarkably emancipated. Her diverse passions – not only for painting, poetry and architecture, but also for politics, economics, and social reform – and her unorthodox tastes – for open windows, modern plumbing, and long walks – repeatedly astonished her hidebound contemporaries.\n\nMore annoying to the Prussians, however, was her persistent Englishness…To her, England was always ‘home’, superior in every way to Prussia… ‘To be friends with the present regime is impossible,’ Vicky complained to Queen Victoria, ‘and yet to be in opposition is a thing as impossible. I always feel like a fly struggling in a very tangled web, and a feeling of weariness and depression, often of disgust and hopelessness, takes possession of me…’\n\nEric Newby writes about his non-encounters with Evelyn Waugh:\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThere are so many goodies in this issue I’ve had to break this entry into two!\n\nThe cover shows an illustration from Tacuinum Sanitatis, a mediaeval handbook on health and wellbeing, based on an 11th Century Arab medical treatise. It illustrates a special section, ‘Is Civilization Dangerous to Your Health?’ I wonder whether Managing Editor James F. Fixx might have had role in choosing this topic: his The Complete Book of Running came out the following year.\n\nLooking at how people have pursued health and wellbeing through history, Editor Shirley Tomkievicz writes about those who have been creative despite ill-health: Balzac (whose statue by Rodin also features in this issue) ‘died of heart failure at fifty-one, but then, so has many another man without Balzac’s dependence on stimulants, and without writing The Human Comedy…To the question, Is health really necessary? one would, moving down the ages, receive a variety of answers – often negative. Much of the world’s most distinguished work has, it seems, been done while the worker was groping for the aspirin bottle.’\n\nIn ‘A Passion for the Hard Workout’, classicist Lionel Casson looks at the Greek and Roman approaches to health:\n\nAmong the Romans physical fitness was more as it is with us, a social and not a state matter [as it was with the Greeks] and something people went in for strenuously. Every Roman, rich or poor, male or female, repaired daily to the public baths, the poor at the end of their working day, the leisured long before that…The Roman moralist Seneca, who once rented a room over a bath, has left us a graphic account of what went on: ‘I live right over a public bath. Just imagine every kind of human sound to make us hate our ears! When the muscular types work out and toss the lead weights, when they strain (or make believe they are straining), I hear the grunting, and whenever they let out the breath they’ve been holding in, there’s the whistling and wheezing at maximum pitch….But if a ball player arrives on the scene and begins to count shots, then I’m done for!’\n\nThe bikini has been around for longer than you may think:\n\n‘Taking the Waters at Vichy’ includes this example of what went on at one of France’s most popular spa towns:\n\nIn ‘Pursuing Health in the Promised Land’ Spencer Klaw describes the new boom in health and fitness in the 70s:\n\nOne of the more diverting aspects of life in America these days is the unprecedented intensity and passion with which Americans appear to be pursuing the holy grail of perfect health. The morning landscape teems with sweating joggers. Bicycles are popular again. In the privacy of bedrooms and living rooms millions of citizens daily bend and strain to keep fit and trim. Others repair to luxuriously appointed health clubs and yield themselves up to chromium-and-plastic machines that resemble in their mad complexity the constructions of the Swiss sculptor Jean Tinguely. In the embraces of such machines they rhythmically flex and stretch their arms, legs, necks and torsos.\n\nBut he shows this is actually nothing new in America, where ‘A keen interest in the workings of the body, coupled with a profound mistrust of the medical establishment, is an old story.’ Examples include:\n\n• Samuel Thomson, herbalist.\n\n• Vegetarians including Bronson Alcott and John Harvey Kellogg.\n\n• Gayelord Hauser, creator of Swiss Kriss laxative.\n\n• Don Ethan Miller, author of Bodymind.\n\nAlso in this issue\n\nIn ‘The War That Broke the Imperial Spirit’, Jan Morris (then working on Farewell the Trumpets: An Imperial Retreat, the final volume of her Pax Britannica trilogy) writes about the Boer War:\n\nStrategy, economics, morality, instinct and now cupidity ensured that before long the Boer republics must be tidied up within the imperial logic.\n\n…In December, 1895, there had been a British attempt to overthrow Kruger in in a coup d’état, the so-called Jameson Raid. It ended in fiasco, but by the end of the century the issue had gone beyond petty plots and maverick raids. Tempers were so inflamed, prejudices so rooted, consequences so inescapable, that war came about scarcely by intention at all.\n\n…All in all the Boers were born irregular soldiers, perhaps the best guerrillas in the world.\n\nMorris describes engagements ‘each long ago apotheosized into myth’. Firstly, the British defeat at Spion Kop:\n\nSpion Kop was one of the most cruelly confined of all battles. Some two thousand British infantrymen were packed within a perimeter of about a quarter of a mile, without water and, as the day wore on, in ferocious heat. They could scarcely move at all, and throughout the day they were shelled and raked with rifle fire. Time and again the Boers charged, at one end of the line or the other, to be beaten back with bayonets and bludgeon blows: all the British could do was hang on, for there was no hope of advance or retreat while daylight lasted. No orders reached them, no diversionary attacks could be made. Isolated on their high proscenium, the men on Spion Kop sweated and died through the long day, enacting a drama that had no meaning.\n\nThen a victory, the relief of the Siege of Mafeking:\n\nThrough the worst days of ignominy, Mafeking brilliantly kept the legend of empire alive. The defence of Mafeking, though no exhibition of military genius, undeniably had style; and style – as the queen’s soldiers lumbered dismayed and bewildered across the veldt, or lay maimed and bleeding on mountaintops – was what the empire badly needed. The whole world came to know the lithe figure of Baden-Powell, whistling with his telescope on his rooftop lookout; and it was wonderfully true to the Mafeking myth that when, after seven months, the first men of the relieving force clattered into the outskirts of the town, they got a laconic greeting from the first citizen they met. ‘Ah yes’, the man remarked, in the best Baden-Powell manner. ‘Ah yes, we heard you were knocking about.’\n\nThe role of propaganda:\n\nIt was the very first of the propaganda wars. Every incident in the field, flashed across the world by electric telegraph, was magnified or distorted to prove a point or support an ideology. When, in Black Week, the British armies were disastrously defeated in three battles in a row, half the world laughed or cheered at their discomfiture; when, six months later, Mafeking was relieved at last, the other half indulged in such hysterical celebrations that the name of the little town went briefly into the English language: maffick, ‘to indulge in extravagant demonstrations of exultation on occasion of national rejoicing.’\n\nBut in the end, ‘The Boer War cracked the confidence of imperialism…and among the mass of the British people it suggested a first nagging misgiving about the value of glory.’\n\nIn another part of Africa, Mary Cable asks ‘Who Built Zimbabwe?’, the ruined city in what was then Rhodesia, which eventually gave its name to the country. She writes of how the argument over who built it had become political when she was living there:\n\nI found it curious that an obscure archaeological question could be of such lively general interest, and furthermore, that it could cause people to raise their voices, become flushed, and even stalk out of the room. The whole temper of white society in Salisbury was, and is, easily inflamed. Race and politics invade every aspect of Rhodesian life, and to ask ‘Who built Zimbabwe?’ is far from an idle pleasantry or a polite parlor game. Rather, it is to ask, ‘Was Zimbabwe built by blacks or whites?’ And in such circumstances, the person’s answer is likely to be taken as a quick index to his political bias; for to contend that Africans could of their own initiative build so rugged and impressive a structure as Zimbabwe is to suggest that one’s houseboy has a capacity for building something substantial too – possibly even a government.\n\nWhite Rhodesians believed it was the palace of the Queen of Sheba:\n\nMore of this issue to come!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
