        "text": "Albert Billheimer was a teacher of Greek and an epigraphist specializing in Attic inscriptions of the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. As a teacher he insisted upon absolute accuracy and precision, yet did so without pedantry. As a scholar he rigidly held to the highest standards and taught his students to do the same. He wrote few articles, but they were models of scholarshipâ€”concise, scrupulously accurate, convincingly argued."
