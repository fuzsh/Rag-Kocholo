        "text": "LIBRARIES IN THE ANCIENT WORLD\n\nBy Lionel Casson\n\nIllustrated. 177 pages. Yale University Press. $22.95.\n\nAs the Internet transforms the way we communicate, as search engines and e-mail and even e-books alter the way scholars and students do research, it seems a fitting time to look back at the dawn of an earlier information age, the beginnings of the book era and the founding of the first libraries of the Western world. That is precisely what Lionel Casson, professor emeritus of classics at New York University, proposes to do in his informative new book, ''Libraries in the Ancient World.''\n\nIn these pages Mr. Casson offers a succinct account of the development of reading, writing and book collecting in Mesopotamia, Greece and the Roman Empire, piecing together his story from archaeological excavations, references found in literary texts and even inscriptions and epitaphs relating to libraries and library donations. As he repeatedly points out, the historical record remains fragmentary, subject to the haphazard survival of sources, and as a result portions of his book are necessarily based on assumptions and speculation.\n\nOn the destruction of the famous library of Alexandria -- that magnificent institution, the first of its kind, created by the Ptolemies around 300 B.C. to house books of every sort and open to ''anyone with fitting scholarly or literary qualifications'' -- Mr. Casson suggests that it was not destroyed by fire in 48 B.C., as popularly believed, but probably survived until A.D. 270 or so, ''when the emperor Aurelian, in the course of suppressing the insurgency of the kingdom of Palmyra, engaged in bitter fighting in Alexandria'' that left the palace area, where the library was situated, in ruins.\n\nAs evidence Mr. Casson notes that the prolific author Didymus (known as Bronze Guts for his mind-boggling output of an estimated 3,500 to 4,000 books) remained active in the years after 48 B.C., and ''his vast and varied output would have been impossible without at least a good part of the resources of the library at his disposal.''\n\nMore dubiously, Mr. Casson argues that ''the library was surely in existence during Antony's dalliance with Cleopatra, the years leading up to the Battle of Actium in 31 B.C., because it was rumored that Antony gave the 200,000 books in the library of Pergamum, a city within his sphere of command, as a gift to his inamorata, a gift that could only have been intended for the Alexandrian library.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
