        "text": "Bryony Roberts\n\nSigmund Abeles (1934- )\n\nA talented printmaker and teacher, Sigmund Abeles is known for his thoughtful studies of the human figure. Abeles was born in Brooklyn, New York, in 1934, but moved to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina with his mother in 1936 when his parents divorced. He was determined to be an artist at a young age despite the protests of his mother, who imagined him becoming a doctor or a lawyer. As an adolescent, he visited the sculpture park at Brookgreen Gardens and spent hours drawing and painting from the figures. While still in high school, he studied with Gerald Tempest, who became an important mentor for the young artist. When Abeles enrolled at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, he was uncomfortable with the preponderance of abstract art, and left after one semester for the University of South Carolina. To satisfy his mother, he enrolled in the pre-med program, but took summer classes with Reginald Marsh, Morris Kanter and Harry Sternberg at the Art Students League in New York.\n\nIn 1955 and 1956 he studied with Isabel Bishop, Edwin Dickinson, and Ben Shahn at the Skowhegan School of Sculpture and Painting in Maine. During this time Abeles was highly influenced by Social Realism, a style which was reflected in his woodcuts of the figure, and became involved in the civil rights movement. After participating in a civil rights sit-in, he was encouraged to graduate early from USC. He went on to earn his M.F.A. at Columbia University in New York in 1957 and was drafted immediately following graduation.\n\nIn the 1960s, Abeles married and settled in New England, where he taught at the Swain School of Design, Wellesley College, Boston University, and eventually, University of New Hampshire. During these years, he made many prints of his family alongside politically charged works of the Vietnam War. Like much of his mature work, the prints are skillful renditions of the human form that combine elegant lines with expressive mark-making.\n\nAbeles returned to New York City in 1994, where he currently teaches painting at the Art Students League. He has had solo exhibitions of his work at the Portland Museum of Art, the Bates College Museum of Art, and the Burroughs/Chapin Art Museum, several of which have traveled nationally. His works are in major public and private collections including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Museum of Modern Art, New York, the British Museum, and the Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge, Massachusetts and in the private collections of the late Leonard Baskin, Raphael Soyer, and Lewis Mumford.\n\nIrving Amen (1918- )\n\nDuring his long life, Amen has left his mark as a painter, a printmaker, and an instructor. Born in New York City in 1918, he proved himself a talented and motivated child. He began to draw at the age of four, and by fourteen had won a scholarship to study art at Pratt Institute. He admired Michelangelo and learned from his drawings, but was determined to find his own personal style. The characteristic work that emerged is a unique fusion of naturalistic and stylized figurative forms, a style that is most evident in his prints, where the human form is enveloped in complex compositions of abstract patterns and shapes. This unusual approach manifests the influence of a variety of artists and movements, including Paul Klee, Cubism, and Pablo Picasso’s figurative works. Amen’s work often employs iconic imagery from religious and historical narratives. Through symbolic arrangements of human figures, he delves into these narratives and expresses his deep concern for humanity.\n\nAfter serving in the Armed Forces during 1942–1945, Amen led mural projects in the United States and Belgium. His first exhibitions in 1949 were at the New School for Social Research in New York and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. Amen was deeply inspired by his travels. After visiting Italy in 1953, he created a series of eleven woodcuts, eight etchings, and several oil paintings, one of which, the woodcut “Piazza San Marco #4”, is permanently installed in the Smithsonian Institution. His 1960 retrospective at the Artists House in Jerusalem reflected his travels in Israel, Greece, and Turkey. Amen also lived and studied in Paris, where he produced several one-person shows of painting, woodcuts, and sculpture. Throughout his life, he has taught sculpture and printmaking at prominent institutions of higher learning, including Pratt Institute and Notre Dame University. Among his most notable commissions were a Peace Medal in honor of the Vietnam War and twelve stained glass windows for the Agudas Achim Synagogue in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nWill Barnet (1911- )\n\nBorn to immigrant parents in 1911 in Beverly, Massachusetts, Will Barnet was a New York- based artist, best known for his geometric, figurative paintings and prints. A contemporary of the Abstract Expressionists of the 1950s, his work had a more figurative bent than his peers, incorporating influences and imagery from the Renaissance and Native American Art. He was a key figure in the New York movement called Indian Space Painting, a group of artists who based their abstract and semi-abstract work on Native American art.\n\nBarnet became interested in printmaking as a teenager. During the many hours he spent in museums and libraries, he discovered the beauty of fifteenth-century woodblock prints and tried his hand at the linoleum block print. His earliest influences were the German, Italian, and Flemish artists of the Renaissance whose work he found in books. Barnet studied at the Boston Museum School between 1928 and 1931 before winning a scholarship to study at the Art Students League in New York. There he learned lithography from Charles Locke and studied with Stuart Davis. At this time he began to admire Daumier and the Mexican muralist Orozco, and his prints reflected their influence. After mastering the many techniques of printmaking, he became a professional printer for the Art Students League, and in 1936 served as a technical advisor and printer for the Graphic Arts Division of the Works Progress Administration.\n\nBarnet made his entrance into abstraction in the 1930s when, influenced by Picasso, Klee, and Miro, he began making abstract paintings that incorporated styles and techniques from printmaking and employed printmaking to try out new ideas. In the 1940s he taught at the Art Students League and later at Cooper Union, while exhibiting regularly in New York. Over the next decade, he produced geometric, flat works that incorporated iconic imagery in reaction against Abstract Expressionism. In the mid 1950s, he became part of the Indian Space Painting Movement, an artistic community in New York that admired the art of the Hopi and Northwest Coast Indians. His work evolved throughout his lifetime, even reflecting a visible Asian influence after a visit to Japan in 1984 to study with Japanese print masters. His best-known pieces are his portraits and figure studies from the late 1950s, which contrast simple silhouettes against planes of color.\n\nBarnet has exhibited at many major museums, including the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, and the Corcoran Gallery of Art. He taught for short periods at Yale University, the Boston Museum School, and Washington State University, before securing a teaching position at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where he remained until 1992. He currently resides in New York City.\n\nLeonard Baskin (1922–2000)\n\nA highly respected draftsman, printmaker, teacher, and sculptor, Leonard Baskin gained international recognition for his charged portrayal of the human condition. Born in New Brunswick, New Jersey, in 1922, he had a strong Jewish upbringing, which he says became the foundation for his artwork. He was both the son and brother of orthodox rabbis, and after his family moved to New York City in 1929, he attended what he later called a “dark, medieval” yeshiva in Brooklyn and worked in a synagogue for pocket money as a teenager.\n\nBaskin studied at the Educational Alliance in New York with Maurice Glickman, at the NYU School of Architecture and Applied Arts (where he concentrated on sculpture but made linoleum cuts as early as 1939, later incorporating his prints into book design), and at the Yale School of Art (where as a student he founded the Gehenna Press to produce and publish his own prints and was expelled in 1942 when he became too distracted by his private intellectual investigations). Baskin subsequently enlisted in the Navy and served in its Air Force during World War II. After the war, he studied at the New School in New York as well as in Paris and Florence. The Gothic and Early Renaissance sculptures he saw in Europe influenced him greatly and he longed to continue his tandem pursuits in sculpture and printmaking. When he settled in Worcester, Massachusetts with his wife in 1952, he finally had enough space for both media. He began teaching at Smith College and stayed there for the next twenty years.\n\nDuring his years at Smith, Baskin delighted in the monumental, creating prints as large as eight feet by three and a half feet, an achievement in print-making. By the mid-1950s, Baskin became well known for his prints and sculpture. His figurative prints of the period, dense with tense, bold lines, explored the existential questions of life, deviating from the mainstream of Abstract Expressionism. He became isolated from his peers and misunderstood, yet refused to discard the human figure as his subject and used it to explore man’s bestiality, fragility, and corruption. He was not interested in literal naturalism; instead, he distorted the body to communicate emotion. Baskin was strongly influenced by classical forms, and his work reflects his interests in Greek mythology and Jewish tradition and culture.\n\nHe and his family moved to Devon, England in the 1970s, but still spent their summers in Maine. Baskin’s exploration of materials continued to evolve late in his life; he made his first monotypes in 1982 and created two large-scale memorial sculptures in the 1990s, including a seven-foot bronze figure for the Holocaust Memorial at the First Jewish Cemetery in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and a thirty-foot-long bas-relief for the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial. In 1984 he designed and illustrated The Five Scrolls (Ecclesiastes, Esther, Song of Songs, Ruth, and Lamentations) for the Central Conference of American Rabbis Press. His work can be found in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Hirshhorn Museum, the Seattle Art Museum, and the Vatican Museum. Baskin died in 2000 in Northampton, Massachusetts.\n\nMax Beckmann (1884-1950)\n\nOne of Germany’s foremost modernists and leading artists of the twentieth century, Max Beckmann is known for his narrative, metaphorical treatment of political subjects. Beckmann was born in Leipzig in 1884, the youngest of three children. When his father, a grain merchant, died in 1894, his mother raised the family in her hometown of Braunschweig, Germany. Over the protests of his family, Beckmann enrolled in the Grandducal Art School in Weimar in 1900 and studied with Carl Frithjof Smith. He worked in Paris in 1903, moved to Berlin in 1904, where he gained recognition and exhibited with the Berlin Secession group, a cadre of artists who withdrew from the established academic societies or exhibitions, creating alternative exhibition opportunities, and received the Villa Romana Prize to study in Florence for six months.\n\nIn 1909 he met Emil Nolde and participated in an exhibition at the Salon d’Autumne in Paris. At this time he made his first lithographs; his work in this medium, as in painting, evolved from traditional figure studies to more iconic, symbolic images. Frustrated with the Berlin Secession, Beckmann resigned from its board in 1911 and formed the Salon de Refusés with members of the Brücke group. The year 1912 ushered in his first one-man show at Galerie Paul Cassirer in Berlin and his first monograph, written by Hans Kaiser. In the following year, Beckmann participated in his first group show in the United States – Contemporary German Art at the Art Institute of Chicago.\n\nBeckmann was highly influenced by the destruction of the First and Second World Wars. He served during Word War I in the field hospital corps in East Prussia, Flanders, and Strasbourg, and after being discharged for an emotional breakdown, settled in Frankfurt am Main where he became a professor at the Städelsches Kunstinstitut. In the 1920s he developed his mature style, combining elements of Cubism, Northern Gothic art, and Expressionism in figurative scenes that addressed contemporary politics. He allowed only the Neue Sachlichkeit movement to claim him as a comrade, denying any connection to Expressionism. Before the Nazis came to power in 1933, he was exhibiting widely and spending his winters in Paris.\n\nThe Nazi regime destroyed Beckmann’s career in Germany. They declared his work ‘degenerate’ and dismissed him from his teaching position. After the Beckmann gallery at the Nationalgalerie in Berlin was forced to close, he left Germany In 1937, a week before the “Degenerate Art” exhibition opened with ten of his paintings. Beckman spent the next ten years in exile in Amsterdam. In 1947 he left Europe and accepted a teaching position at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri. He had his first U.S. retrospective at the City Art Museum of St. Louis and moved to New York in 1949, where he taught advanced painting at the Brooklyn Museum Art School. In 1950, the year he died, he represented Germany in the Twenty-Fifth Venice Biennale. His work has been collected by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, the Tate Britain, the Museum of Modern Art, New York, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin, the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art, the Kunstmuseum Basel, and the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\n\nDavid Bekker (1897-1955)\n\nDavid Bekker was a painter, sculptor, stained glass designer, and printmaker of religious themes, as well as an ordained rabbi. He was born in Vilna, Poland, in 1897, and studied art at the Antokolsky School in Vilna, Poland, at the Palestine Academy of Art under Boris Schatz, and at the Bezalel School in Jerusalem under Abel Pann. He served in Bucharest, Romania during World War I and after the war, moved to the United States, where he began rabbinical studies and was ordained as a rabbi in Casper, Wyoming.\n\nDeciding to pursue a career as an artist instead, Bekker studied at the Denver Academy of Fine Arts and then settled in Chicago in the 1920s. He was deeply religious throughout his life and his Jewish identity remained important to his work. During the Depression, he worked as a WPA artist, painting murals of human suffering in Illinois public buildings. He taught art at the Hull House in Chicago and in 1932 published a portfolio of woodcuts titled Myths and Moods. Bekker exhibited eight times at the Art Institute of Chicago between 1934 and 1945 and was commissioned to make ivory portraits and two plaques of the Royal Family of Romania. His work is in the permanent collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the National Museum of American Art, the Library of Congress in Washington, DC, and the Tel Aviv Museum. Bekker died in Chicago in 1955.\n\nLeon Bibel (1913-1995)\n\nPoland-born painter Leon Bibel lived and worked in the United States most of his life, creating a legacy as a social realist in his prints and paintings. An artist of the New York City WPA Federal Art Project in the 1930s, he was passionate about labor and union issues and concerned with justice as it impacted on the very poor in the Depression.\n\nBibel arrived in the U.S. as a child when his parents immigrated to San Francisco from their native town of Szczebrzeszyn, Poland. He attended the Polytechnic High School and studied at the California School of Fine Arts. After winning a scholarship to study with the German Impressionist Maria Riedelstein, Bibel collaborated with Bernard Zackheim, a student of Diego Rivera, on the frescoes of the San Francisco Jewish Community Center and the University of California at San Francisco’s Toland Hall. In 1936, he moved to New York and worked as a WPA artist at the Harlem Art Center in New York City, making extra income teaching at P.S. 94 and the Bronx House. The themes of the Depression era infused his work; he devoted himself primarily to portraying the conditions of the working class and the politics of protest, although he also depicted more conventional landscapes and cityscapes. Although he experimented with many media and styles throughout his life, this social realist work is his lasting legacy.\n\nWhen Bibel’s WPA program ended and the Second World War began, he and his wife and several friends moved to New Brunswick, New Jersey to live as chicken farmers. For more than twenty years he lived removed from the art world, but he returned to art in the 1960s with renewed enthusiasm and a radically changed style. He experimented with wood sculpture, creating miniature buildings, figures within shadow boxes, and a synagogue ark. A close companion of sculptor George Segal, Bibel became the frequent subject of the other artist’s work at this time, appearing in works such as “Depression Bread Line,” installed at the FDR Memorial. Bibel exhibited extensively after the mid-1960s, at the Newark Museum, the Jersey City Museum, the National Academy of Design, Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion Museum, and the B’nai B’rith Klutznick National Jewish Museum. His work is in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, the Newark Museum, the Zimmerli Art Museum of Rutgers University, the Amon Carter Museum, and the Art Collection of the Federal Reserve Board, as well as in many university, corporate, and private collections. Bibel died in 1995.\n\nUriel Birnbaum (1894-1956)\n\nUriel Birnbaum was an Austrian painter, caricaturist, writer and poet, born in Vienna in 1894, the youngest son of Nathan Birnbaum, a Jewish philosopher, and Rosa Korngut. The artist died in 1956 in Amersfoort, Netherlands.\n\nIsabel Bishop (1902-1988)\n\nAmerican urban realist painter Isabel Bishop overcame the challenges of a predominately male art community in her day to be a successful painter, printmaker, teacher, and spokesperson for the arts. Her best-known work is of the working class women she observed in New York City, particularly in Manhattan’s Union Square, where she held a studio from 1934-1984.\n\nBorn in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1902 and raised in Detroit, Michigan, where she attended the Wicker Art School, Bishop came to New York when she was sixteen to attend the New York School of Applied Design for Women. After two years, she enrolled at the Art Students League, where she studied with Kenneth Hayes Miller, who encouraged her to depict street life and emphasized the importance of drawing. Bishop attempted suicide three times in the 1920s and during these tumultuous years, she produced many baroque-influenced drawings and paintings of women’s faces, sometimes in strange contortions, manifesting the influence of 17th-century Baroque painters such as Rembrandt and Rubens. In 1934 she married and moved to Riverdale, New York, but until 1984 maintained a studio on Union Square at 14th Street, rooting her in a hub of urban and artistic activity. She became the only female member of the “Fourteenth Street School,” which included Reginald Marsh, the Soyer brothers, and Kenneth Hayes Miller. For the rest of her life she would paint the mostly working class women she observed in the park and streets of her neighborhood, giving even the most quotidian and banal scenes nobility, grace, and linear movement.\n\nBishop was a skilled teacher and community leader. She taught at the Art Students League in New York (where she was the only female full-time instructor) from 1935-1937, and at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture. In 1938, she worked as a WPA muralist, and completed a mural for the Post Office in New Lexington, Ohio. In 1946 she served as the vice- president of the National Institute of the Arts and Letters, making her the first woman to hold an executive position in that organization.\n\nIn her lifetime, Bishop produced fewer than two hundred canvases, but she exhibited extensively. Her works were exhibited in solo and group shows at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the Corcoran Gallery, the National Academy of Design, Library of Congress, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Whitney Museum of American Art, and several Venice Biennales. She is featured in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, the Baltimore Museum of Art, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, the New York Public Library, and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. A year after she died, the Midtown Galleries in New York held a retrospective of her work. Bishop was widely recognized for her accomplishments – she received an American Academy of Arts and Letters Award in 1943 and an award for Outstanding Achievement in the Arts presented to her by President Jimmy Carter in 1979, along with numerous honorary doctorate degrees. She died in 1988 in Riverdale, New York.\n\nJulius Bloch (1888-1966)\n\nJulius Bloch, a social realist painter, devoted his career to exposing injustice by depicting the working poor, blacks, strikers, and prisoners in the United States. A Jewish immigrant to the U.S. (born in Kehl, Germany in 1888) and the youngest of four children, he and his family settled in Philadelphia when he was five years old. Bloch grew up in the financial instability of a family struggling to find a better way of life in America. Despite their poverty, Bloch’s mother, the dominant influence on his life, exposed him to literature and music, and encouraged him to become an artist. He attended Central High School, the Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art, and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, which at the time, was highly influenced by European modernism and a group of artists known as the Philadelphia Modernists. Bloch stood out from his peers with his unusual interest in Realism and affinity with the art of Thomas Eakins.\n\nBloch was drafted into service and fought at Verdun in World War I. He returned from the war emotionally scarred from the horrors that he had witnessed and began to depict war scenes and dead soldiers in his paintings. He wrote avidly in journals, which enabled him to elucidate his cultural critiques of war, poverty, and social injustice. Like many other social realists, Bloch admired Daumier greatly and adopted a similarly compassionate, figurative style. He supported himself in part by teaching at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, but also had many affluent patrons, whose support enabled him to spend summers in Woodstock, New York, and to travel to Italy and Greece. It has been said that about Bloch that “with the support of the rich, he portrayed the poor.”\n\nIn the 1930s, Bloch turned to racial inequality and the Depression in his lithographs and oil paintings. He published lithographs in the New Masses, a left-of-center publication, and used his art to support leftist political causes. In 1934, he shocked society by submitting a portrait of an African American man, Alonzo Jennings, for display in the window of an elite Center City department store. Store officials said it was one of the finest paintings they had seen, but that the store “could not exhibit a portrait of a Negro in its windows.” When asked if he had pictures of white people, Bloch said he did, but that they were not available. Bloch is now acknowledged as the first American artist to portray black persons with the dignity generally reserved for portraits of powerful white figures. He gained national recognition in the 1930s, and Eleanor Roosevelt purchased one of his paintings for the White House.\n\nHe abandoned his figurative style suddenly in the 1940s and began making abstract work, possibly because he feared being blacklisted during the McCarthy era. In 1962 he was forced to retire from the Academy, which had been his “lifeblood,” and had to rely on his friends for support. When Bloch died suddenly in 1966, his works had been acquired by the collections of the Smithsonian Institution, the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts; he left his works to the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\n\nSelma Bluestein (1935-1985)\n\nActive both in the art world and politics, Selma Bluestein was a printmaker and anarchist. Born in the early twentieth century, she studied art at Cooper Union in New York, and subsequently met her lifelong partner Abe Bluestein, an anarchist activist who kindled her interest in politics. She worked with Moses Soyer in New York on WPA projects from 1935 to 1937 and then she and Abe went to Spain to support the Spanish Loyalists during the Spanish Civil War. There, she worked as an artist while Abe was a reporter for anarchist and labor organizations.\n\nIn the 1940s, the couple returned to the United States and settled in Croton, New York, where Abe became active in the Jewis Labor Movement and solidified his friendship with Emma Goldman. Selma raised their four children while exhibiting her art across the United States, participating in solo and juried exhibitions, including the New York City WPA Exhibition and a show at the Parsons School of Design in 1977. She is best known for her printmaking abilities, which she perfected while working as an artist in Bob Blackburn’s Printmaking Workshop. She was also an accomplished illustrator for The Web. She died in 1985.\n\nJack Bookbinder (1911-1990)\n\nJack Bookbinder is known for his luminous representational paintings, lithographs, and illustrations of the human figure or landscape, and for his participation in the Philadelphia art community. Born in 1911 in Odessa, Bookbinder moved to Philadelphia as a young man and simultaneously pursued a Bachelor of Science in Education at the University of Pennsylvania and studied art under Henry McCarter and Daniel Carger at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. He earned an M.F.A. at the Tyler School of Art at Temple University in 1946.\n\nThroughout his life, Bookbinder was as invested in art education as he was in creating art. He was a consultant to the Department of Education at the Philadelphia Museum of Art from 1945 to 1946, a special assistant to the Director of Art Education in the School District of Philadelphia from 1946 to 1959, and the Director of Art Education of that district from 1959 through the 1970s. He lectured at the Barnes Foundation during 1936-1944, at the University of Pennsylvania during 1947-1959, and at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts from 1949 to 1961. Bookbinder also wrote several books, contributed essays to magazines, and produced several television series about art and artists.\n\nAt the same time, he exhibited constantly, participating in approximately fifty exhibitions around the world in his lifetime. He exhibited regularly at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts from 1944 to 1954 and less frequently during the late 1950s and 1960s, at the Library of Congress during the 1940s, and at the Corcoran Gallery during the 1940s and 1950s. Internationally, Bookbinder exhibited at the Royal Academy of the Arts in London, and in Mexico City. His work is in the collections of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Library of Congress, the National Gallery of Art, and the Yale University Art Gallery. Bookbinder died in 1990 in Philadelphia.\n\nBernard Brussel-Smith (1914-1989)\n\nBernard Brussel-Smith was one of the few artists to succeed in the difficult medium of wood engraving. Born in New York City in 1914, he studied wash and lithography with Roy Nurse and Henry McCarter at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts on a scholarship from 1931 to 1936 and won the Cresson Fellowship for foreign travel in 1935. In 1941 he had his first experience with wood engraving at the New School for Social Research in a course with Fritz Eichenberg, whose teaching assistant he became within a year. Wood engraving is similar to the woodcut, except that it is applied to the end grain of a block of wood and allows for much greater detail. Brussel-Smith modeled his personal technique after that of Thomas Bewick, who was considered the master of wood engraving.\n\nHe spent most of his life in New York City, teaching at the Brooklyn Museum, Cooper Union, and the National Academy and supporting himself by working in advertising and doing freelance wood engraving and illustrations for publications such as Holiday, Life, Saturday Evening Post, and Reader’s Digest. To broaden his skills in the field, he studied calligraphy, typography, and layout and designed two complete alphabets for the printing firms Westcott and Thomson and Savina Uncial. Eventually he also mastered the intricate process of color wood engraving, which required as many as nine or ten separate blocks for each color.\n\nBrussel-Smith’s engravings depict a wide range of subjects, including urban scenes, Jewish rituals, portraits, and landscapes. He achieved great ease with his technique, creating images that are subtle, layered, and richly detailed. His travels in the second half of his life broadened his style and subject matter. Between 1957 and 1958, he studied with Stanley William Hayter in Paris and executed relief etchings inspired by William Blake. From 1957 to 1980, he spent summers with his family in Collonges-la-Rouge, France, where the natural beauty inspired his landscape engravings. Brussel-Smith had solo exhibitions abroad at Galerie St. Jacques in Collonges-la-Rouge, Musée Ernest-Rupin in Brive, France, and the Olthuysen Ateliers in Rotterdam, Netherlands. In the United States, his one-man exhibitions included the Desert Museum in Palm Springs, California, and the Bethesda Art Gallery in Maryland; a retrospective of his work at the Farleigh Dickenson University Library (1983); the Sterling Memorial Library of Yale University (1988), and the Associated American Artists. His work is in the permanent collections of the New York Public Library, the National Academy of Design, the Library of Congress, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Boymans Museum in Rotterdam, and the Lenin Library in Moscow, among other museum and library collections in the U.S. and abroad. Brussel-Smith died in Bedford Hills, New York in 1989.\n\nDavid Burliuk (1882-1967)\n\nDavid Burliuk was one of the stars of the Russian avant-garde and the father of Russian Futurism. He was talented in many disciplines, earning recognition as a painter, lecturer, writer, and poet. Burliuk was born in 1882 in Kharkov, Russia (now Ukraine) to a family descended from wealthy Ukrainian peasants. During his childhood, he traveled extensively through Russia, visiting the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow when he was fifteen, where he was deeply influenced by the paintings of Shishkin, Kuindzhi, Repin, and Serov. He studied at art schools in Kazan, Odessa, Munich, Paris, and Moscow during his youth and acquired the skills of traditional painting.\n\nIn 1904, he met the young Kazimir Malevich, who shared his affection for Shishkin and Repin, but both artists soon rejected this Russian art, and all previous methods of art making, in favor of a “new art of wild beauty.” Burliuk collaborated with Vladimir Mayakovsky, Mikhail Matiushin, Malevich, and many other Russian avant-garde artists during this period to create a new art form. His vision, which generated Russian Futurism, was to form a universal movement that could express its ideas through a fusion of different media. Burliuk’s writing was the linguistic equivalent of modernist painting and was very influential to Russian literary circles. He was also involved in significant art movements within and outside of Russia, including the “Jack of Diamonds,” “Sturm,” and “Der Blaue Reiter” (The Blue Rider). After the Russian revolution of 1917, Burliuk moved to Japan and then to the United States in 1922.\n\nSoon after his arrival in New York, Burliuk exhibited with the Société Anonyme and at the Whitney Museum of American Art. While living in Hampton Bays, Long Island, during the 1930s, Burliuk and his wife Marussia co-published the magazine Color and Rhyme, a review of poetry and modern art. Since he believed that the two forms of artistic expression enhanced each other, Burliuk often interwove the verses with reproductions of paintings. In later years, Burliuk exhibited at the Corcoran Gallery, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and the Art Institute of Chicago. His diverse work can now be seen in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Burliuk died in 1967 in Northampton, New York.\n\nMarc Chagall (1887-1985)\n\nChagall was born Moishe Segal on June 7, 1887 in Vitebsk, Russia, the oldest of nine children in an impoverished, close-knit Jewish family led by his father, a merchant and his mother, Feiga-Ita. As a young child, Chagall attended cheder (religious school) and was influenced by Habad Hassidism’s worship through fervent prayer and joyful song and movement, love for story-telling, and the belief that holiness could be discovered in the everyday, the weary, and the poor.\n\nDuring his adolescence, Chagall’s parents supported his early studies in painting with the famed Vitebsk artist Yehuda Pen. He moved to St. Petersburg in 1906 and attended the school of the Imperial Society for the Protection of Fine Art and the Zvantseva School. In 1910 his patron Max Vinaver supported his move to Paris, where he settled in a studio at “La Ruche,” amidst many immigrant artists. Chagall eventually befriended Robert Delauney and the poet Guillaume Apollinaire, who helped him to achieve a solo exhibition at Der Sturm in 1914, launching his career. Soon after, he exhibited at the Salon des Indépendents and the Salon d’Automne.\n\nIn 1914, shortly before World War I broke out, Chagall returned to Russia to marry Bella Rosenfeld. After the 1917 revolution, he was appointed Commissar of Art in Vitebsk and its region, and founded a museum and an art school, at which he invited El Lissitzky, Kasimir Malevich, and Jean Pougny to teach. Pushed out of his position by Malevich, he went to Moscow, where he designed theater sets and costumes for Moscow State Jewish Theater. He left Russia for the last time in 1922 for Berlin, where he studied printmaking with Hermann Struck, experimented with lithography and woodcuts, and developed a preference for etching – creating etched illustrations for his autobiography, Mein Leben (My Life). Returning to Paris in 1923, Chagall was commissioned by the noted art dealer and publisher Ambrose Vollard to illustrate Gogol’s Dead Souls (1923-27), La Fontaine’s Fables (1928-31) and the Bible (1931-39, 1952-56).\n\nAfter the fall of France to the Nazis, Chagall was arrested in the South of France in 1941. Through the efforts of Varian Fry and the Emergency Rescue Committee and an invitation by the Museum of Modern Art (also offered to Matisse, Picasso, Dufy, Rouault, Masson, and Ernst), the American Consul in Marseilles arranged for his release. His arrival in New York was soon welcomed with retrospective exhibitions at both the Museum of Modern Art in New York and at the Art Institute of Chicago. After the war, he returned to France permanently, and exhibited throughout Europe.\n\nChagall’s instinctive and inventive style and romantic spirit merged the experiences of dreams and reality, incorporating Hassidic and biblical iconography from his Vitebsk childhood, impressions of Paris and Palestine (later Israel), and experiences during the Russian Revolution and the Second World War. He did not conform to any of the art movements of his day, but his work incorporated some elements of Surrealism, Fauvism, Cubism, and Expressionism. He expressed his imagination through painting, drawings, printmaking, mosaics, set designs, large-scale commissions for New York’s Metropolitan Opera House and the Paris Opera, and stained glass works for the United Nations, the Cathedral at Metz, and the synagogue of the Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center in Jerusalem. Chagall died on March 28, 1985, in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, France.\n\nSamuel Chamberlain (1895-1975)\n\nSamuel Chamberlain excelled as a printmaker, architectural illustrator, writer, and teacher. Born in Cresco, Iowa in 1895, he attended the University of Washington for his undergraduate education and studied architecture at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. During World War I, he served as an ambulance driver in France, a period he referred to as his “traveling fellowship.” Chamberlain and his wife remained in France during the 1920s and enjoyed the lively bohemian atmosphere, befriending Ernest Hemingway and Gertrude Stein. In 1925, Chamberlain studied with M. Edouard Leonand in Paris and by 1926 he was exhibiting at the Paris Salon. He won a Guggenheim Fellowship that year to study at the Royal College of Art in London. The Chamberlains returned to the United States in the 1930s and settled in Marblehead, Massachusetts. Chamberlain taught graphic arts at MIT, where he lectured on etching, drypoint, and softground etching and taught Gordon Bunshaft and I.M. Pei. During this time, he also became interested in photography and served as a reconnaissance photographer during World War II, earning a meritorious conduct award from the Army Air Force.\n\nChamberlain’s architectural training is evident in his detailed drawings and deft use of light and shadow to create illusions of depth. He authored and illustrated nearly 100 books of architecture and interiors such as Beyond New England Thresholds, Behold Williamsburg, and Domestic Architecture in Rural France, and in later years diversified his illustration projects to include images for cookbooks and the fashion industry. In 1968 the Boston Public Library held a large retrospective of Chamberlain’s work and published a major biographical catalogue entitled Etched in Sunlight. His work can now be seen in the collections of the New York Public Library, the Library of Congress, the Museum of Modern Art, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Art Institute of Chicago, the British Museum, the Victoria and Albert Museum, and the Bibliothèque Nationale. He died in Marblehead, Massachusetts in 1975.\n\nPhilip Cheney (1897-1992)\n\nPhilip Cheney was a lithographer and painter of dramatic American landscapes. Born in Brookline, Massachusetts in 1897, he studied at Harvard College and at the American School in Fontainebleau, France, before moving to Wilmington, Vermont. He settled in Warrenton, Virginia in 1959 and lived there until his death in 1992. Cheney is best known for his lithographs, which depict the expansive beauty of the American wilderness. Using dramatic compositions, high contrast, and dynamic forms, Cheney conveyed the majesty of mountain ranges and plains. During his lifetime, he exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the Cleveland Art Museum, the Los Angeles Museum, the Corcoran Gallery, the Library of Congress, and the National Academy of Design. His work is in the collections of the Yale University Art Gallery, the New York Public Library, the Library of Congress, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, and the IBM Corporate Collection.\n\nNikolai Cikovsky (1894-1987)\n\nA Russian painter and printmaker, Nikolai Cikovsky made subtle, observational landscapes of American scenery. Born in 1894 in Pinsk, Poland (now Russia), Cikovsky studied art at the Vilna Art School, the Penza Royal Art School, and the Moscow High Tech Art Institute (where he studied with Favorsky and Mashkow), and taught for several years at the Ekaterinenberg Higher Tech Art Institute (1919-21). In 1923 he immigrated to the United States and settled in the Midwest. Throughout the 1930s and 1940s he exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and the Art Institute of Chicago; taught courses at the Cincinnati Art Academy and the Art Institute of Chicago; and spent several years living in Washington, DC, exhibiting at the Corcoran Gallery, and working as a WPA muralist for the Department of the Interior. In 1940 he participated in the New York World’s Fair.\n\nCikovsky spent summers on Long Island, New York, where he moved permanently in the late 1970s. The seaside scenery became the subject of quiet oil paintings, of which he once wrote, “spectacular or sensational elements do not interest me, preferring as I do intimate subjects that I see and have contact with in everyday life – fishing houses, gardens, ponds, city squares, parks and streets.” His works were predominantly still lifes and seascapes, with a few industrial scenes. The representational works bear the influence of modernists such as Cézanne, with impressionistic, loose brushwork and bold colors. Cikovsky also produced graphic, figurative lithographs of New York City, His work is in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Phillips Collection, the Hirschhorn Museum, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. He died in 1987 in Washington, DC.\n\nHermine David (1886-1970)\n\nHermine David was a French artist celebrated for her painting, printmaking, and book illustration. In 1902, at the age of sixteen, David became one of the first women to study at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris. Two years later, she began exhibiting regularly at the Salon des Femmes Peintres et Sculpteurs. In the following years she also participated in exhibitions at the Salon des Artistes Français and the Salon d’Automne.\n\nDavid was quite established as a painter, miniaturist, and printmaker when in 1907 she began a relationship with Jules Pascin, the Bulgarian-born artist who dressed as a dandy and was an eccentric figure around Paris. David and Pascin lived together first in Montmartre and then in Montparnasse at the height of Pascin’s notoriety. In 1915, the couple moved to New York and married there, but they separated after 1920.\n\nWhen David returned to Paris, she began her most productive period, opening exhibitions in London and Paris, and enjoying great critical acclaim over the next two decades. During that time she began to distinguish herself in illustration and was commissioned to illustrate many books, including Rimbaud’s Une Saison en Enfer, Verlaine’s La Bonne Chanson, The Anatomy of Dandyism, and Madame de La Fayette’s The Princess of Clèves. For these illustrations and her own prints she used the techniques of drypoint engraving and lithography. Her oeuvre includes fifty drypoints and twenty lithographs. Influenced by Modernism, her prints employ flat spaces and economy of line, and the scenes depicting elegant figures bring Chagall and Picasso’s drawings to mind, but with a softer, idlyllic grace. In the later years of her life she concentrated on watercolors, and she died in 1970.\n\nYussel Dershowitz\n\nYussel Dershowitz resides in Brooklyn, New York, where his work has been shown at the Hassidic Art Institute. He is a cousin of Professor Alan Dershowitz of Harvard Law School.\n\nWerner Drewes (1899-1985)\n\nWerner Drewes was a German painter and printmaker who, after training at the Bauhaus in Germany, became an important figure in the Modernism movement in the United States. Drewes was born in Canig, Germany in 1899, the son of a conservative Lutheran minister. He served on the Western Front as a soldier during World War I, after which he studied architecture in Berlin and Stuttgart. He studied at the Weimar Bauhaus between 1921 and 1922 with Paul Klee, Wassily Kandinsky, Johannes Itten, Oskar Schlemmer, Lyonel Feininger, and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy. He traveled abroad during 1923 to 1927, studying the Old Masters in Italy and Spain, and then continued on to tour Latin and Central America, Japan, Korea, the USSR, and the United States, documenting his travels with etchings, and completed his Bauhaus training in Dessau in 1929.\n\nDrewes immigrated to New York City in 1930 and became active in the Modernism movement there, helping, along with Lyonel Feininger and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, to introduce the ideas of the Bauhaus to the United States through his abstract prints. He produced woodcuts and lithographs, which he exhibitied at Katherine Dreier’s Société Anonyme throughout the 1930s, and in 1934 he published a portfolio about the Nazi threat, titled 10 Block Prints by Drewes – It Can’t Happen Here.\n\nDrewes taught painting, drawing, and printmaking at the Brooklyn Museum (1934-1956) and Columbia University (1937-1940), and in 1946 was given a tenured position as Professor of Design at Washington University at St. Louis, where he taught alongside artist Max Beckmann. He was a founding member of the American Abstract Artists, and served as Director of Graphic Art for the WPA Federal Arts Project in New York (1940). In 1944, he studied printmaking at Stanley William Hayter’s Atelier 17. Drewes maintained close relationships with giants of the art world, including Dreier and Marcel Duchamp, both of whom he brought to speak to his students. When he retired from teaching in 1965, he settled in Reston, Virginia, but continued to travel widely for the rest of his life. In his later years, he exhibited in Germany, Turkey, and Central America, and had a retrospective devoted to his prints at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of American Art in 1984. Drewes continued producing art until his death in 1985.\n\nEsti Dunow (1948- )\n\nEsti Dunow is equally accomplished as an artist and art historian. After receiving her B.A. at Brandeis University in 1970, Dunow studied at the New York Studio School and the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture. In 1981 she earned her Ph.D. in Art History from the Institute of Fine Arts of New York University. While developing her career as an art historian, Dunow has never relinquished her ambitions as a fine artist. She has been exhibiting her work in the Northeast since the late 1970s and has had several solo exhibitions at the Bowery Gallery and Studio Gallery 88, both in New York City. She has participated in many group shows, including exhibitions at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York, Threadwaxing Space in New York City, and the Springville Museum of Art in Utah. Dunow was also awarded a Visual Artist Residency at the Cummington Community of the Arts in Massachusetts (1989 to 1990).\n\nDunow works primarily in oil, creating loose, boldly-colored paintings leaning toward abstraction. In 2001 she created a series of vibrant aerial views of farm country composed of wide brush-strokes and saturated color-fields, in a style suggestive of the influence of Vincent Van Gogh, Henri Matisse, and Andre Derain, as well as the post-war Bay Area painters Richard Diebenkorn and Wayne Thiebaud. Figuration falls away further in her 2002 series inspired by a Jewish cemetery in Poland. Even more abstract than her previous landscapes, the paintings appear at first to be compositions of color and shape, but upon closer inspection, the viewer can make out sunlight falling on the side of a tombstone and deep blue shadows cast by the stones and the trees above. Her work has been acquired by numerous private, public and corporate collections including Citibank, Forbes Magazine, McGraw-Hill, and the City College of New York.\n\nWhile working on these paintings, Dunow has also organized exhibitions and authored catalogues of Lithuanian-born French expressionist painter Chaim Soutine’s work. Among her many publications are Soutine’s Catalogue Raisonné, published by Taschen, and the catalogue for the Jewish Museum of New York’s Soutine exhibition. She has been a consultant for exhibitions at the Musée d’Art Moderne in Céret, France, the Jewish Museum in New York, and the Museo d’Arte Moderne in Lugano, Switzerland. She also co-curated an exhibition of Soutine’s work that traveled throughout Japan.\n\nAmram Ebgi (1939- )\n\nBorn in Morocco in 1939, Ebgi immigrated to Israel in 1960, where he studied at the Avni Institute, the School of Advanced Painting, and the Tel Chai Institute. He came to New York in 1969 with a scholarship from the Brooklyn Museum of Art. Currently residing in Israel, Ebgi’s work has been displayed in exhibitions in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Panama, Baltimore, Washington, Miami, New York, and Los Angeles. His works are included in the permanent collections of the Arkansas Art Center, Florida Gulf Coast Art Center, Salt Lake City Art Center, University of Miami, Vassar College, University of Alabama, University of Michigan, University of California, Los Angeles, Yale University, and Princeton University.\n\nEvelyn Eller (1933- )\n\nNative New Yorker Evelyn Eller is a contemporary artist known for her artist’s books – one-of-a-kind, hand- made collage objects. She attended an arts-oriented New York City high school in the late 1940s, where she studied under a former student of Hans Hoffman, and from 1951 to 1954 studied at the Art Students League in New York, taking courses taught by Morris Kantor and Will Barnet. Eller won a Fulbright Fellowship to study at the Academia Di Belle Arti in Rome from 1954 to 1955 and she subsequently held a residency at Yaddo in Saratoga Springs, New York. During the 1980s, she studied at the Pratt Graphic Center and the School of Visual Arts in New York.\n\nEller has worked in a variety of media, including oil painting, acrylic painting, and printmaking, but her current work is the paper collage that she uses to create unique books. Each small volume is created from handmade paper, board, string, and cloth, and expresses the artist’s socio-political commentary through topics such as words and language, womanhood, and travel. Her book Defining Women explores the roles of women in western society; other significant book projects are Reliquary for the Book (1996) and Words and Music (2003). Eller has always been curious about other cultures and languages, and this interest is visible in her use of diverse language fragments throughout the work.\n\nEller has taught collage and painting for over ten years at the Alliance of Queens Artists. She has exhibited her work at the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Queens Museum, the Brooklyn Museum, the Smithsonian Institution, the National Jewish Museum, and the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, as well as in museums in Mexico, Hungary, Switzerland, Italy, India, and Germany. Her work is in many public and corporate collections, including those of Citicorp, Exxon, the Brooklyn Museum, the National Museum of Women in the Arts, the University of California, Los Angeles, and the Yale University Art Gallery.\n\nLyonel Feininger (1871-1956)\n\nFeininger was born in 1871 in New York City, the son of the German concert violinist Carl Feininger and the German-American singer Elizabeth Cecilia Lutz. The musical atmosphere of his childhood, along with the sights and sounds of New York, had a profound influence on his artistic development. At age nine, his father gave him lessons in the violin, but Feininger was more interested in drawing steamboats and building model ships. In 1887, he left for Germany to study music but within a year chose to study art instead. He enrolled in the Konigliche Akademie in Berlin and studied with Ernst Hancke. He began drawing caricatures and soon was working as a caricaturist for the weekly magazine Humoristische Blatter. After completing his schooling at the Konigliche Akademie, Feininger worked as a caricaturist for both German and American journals, and was commissioned by the Chicago Sunday Tribune in 1906 to do two series of comic strips: the Kin-der-Kids and Wee-Willie Winkie’s World. Thirteen of his caricatures were included in the Great Berlin Art Exhibition. Feininger spent most of 1907 in Paris, taking classes at Colarossi’s studio and frequenting the Café du Dome, where he met German artists and students of Henri Matisse. It was in Paris that he did his first oil painting − a still life − and saw the paintings of Cézanne, Van Gogh, and William Turner.\n\nSoon after, Feininger returned to Berlin, became a member of the Berlin Secession, and began to delve into Cubism as the result of his frequent trips to Paris and friendship with French Cubist painter Robert Delaunay, who he met while exhibiting his work in the Salon des Indépendents. At the same time, he was in close contact with the German avant-garde, particularly Franz Marc, the expressionist group Die Brücke and the gallery Der Sturm. Feininger had his first one-man show at Der Sturm but encountered some difficulties as an American in Germany after World War I. During this time he began producing woodcuts, since wood was more readily available than paint in the post-war era. In 1919 Walter Gropius invited him to join the staff of the Bauhaus and in 1921 he created a portfolio of twelve woodcuts for the first Bauhaus publication. While at the Bauhaus he also returned to music and composed thirteen fugues between 1921 and 1928.\n\nFeininger enjoyed growing fame in America because of his association with the artists of Der Blaue Reiter − Paul Klee, Alexej von Jawlensky, and Wassily Kandinsky. He was visited by Alfred Barr Jr., in the 1920s and participated in the “19 Living American Artists” show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Feininger and his wife left Germany after Hitler closed the Bauhaus in 1933 and classified his work as Degenerate Art. More than four hundred of Feininger’s works were confiscated from German museums and nineteen were shown in the traveling “Degenerate Art” exhibition of 1937. After spending time in California and New England, the couple settled in New York. Feininger painted three monumental murals for the Palace of Fine Arts of New York World’s Fair in 1939. This commission helped to launch his career in America; he enjoyed a large retrospective with Marsden Hartley at the Museum of Modern Art and an exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Boston with Jacques Villon. In the 1940s, Feininger taught at Black Mountain College. In 1956, he died in his New York apartment at the age of eighty-five.\n\nJohn Fenton (1912-1977)\n\nA New York-born painter and printmaker, John Fenton made imaginative artworks, sometimes based on Jewish culture. Born in Mountaindale, New York in 1912, he studied at the Art Students League with Kenneth Hayes Miller, Allen Lewis, and Samuel Adler. When living in Paris a few years later, he worked with Federico Castellon and studied at the Atelier 17. Castellon’s bizarre, slightly grotesque aesthetic had an impact on Fenton, whose paintings developed an eerie, exaggerated quality with long, wispy forms − as in Mannerist or El Greco paintings − and a dark color palette. He made many etchings of Jewish scenes, with compositions less macabre than his paintings, that were rendered with the comic exaggeration of caricatures.\n\nAfter Fenton had his first solo exhibition at the Babcock Galleries in New York City in 1955, his career developed rapidly, leading to six more one-man shows between 1958 and 1964. During that time he also exhibited at the Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and the Corcoran Biennial. The Association of American Artists commissioned an edition of prints from him and in 1960 he created a short film based on Edgar Allen Poe’s story “The Black Cat,” which was shown at the Cannes Film Festival in 1961.\n\nIn addition to making art, Fenton also taught at New York University, Goddard College, and Scarsdale High School in New York. He lived in Woodstock, New York for many years before he passed away in 1977. His works can now be found in the permanent collections of the Brooklyn Museum of Art, the New York Public Library, the Pratt Contemporary Print Center, and the Miami Museum of Modern Art.\n\nMax Ferguson (1959- )\n\nMax Ferguson is a photo-realist painter best known for his New York cityscapes. A native of New York City, he was born in 1959 and studied animation at New York University before he spent a year abroad at the Gerrit Rietveld Academie in Amsterdam. There, he became enamored with seventeenth-century Dutch painting, switched his major to painting and graduated from New York University in 1980.\n\nWith photographic precision he works with oil paint on board, integrating seventeenth-century ideas of craftsmanship with contemporary imagery. For him, photo-realism is not solely about the technique, it is about creating images that are meaningful and historical. He brings iconographic places and people of New York to vivid life, creating stills that capture elements of the city that are rapidly vanishing. His portraits of Jewish historical figures and places, both present and past − Katz’s deli, knish bakeries in Brooklyn, scholars poring over texts − are slices of Jewish life or contemporary snapshots of a bygone era. His recent work has been based on his travels to the Czech Republic, Ireland, and Israel. The beauty of his images comes from their balanced, well-organized compositions, vibrant color palette, and representations of light.\n\nFerguson has produced numerous commissioned portraits for prominent New Yorkers and, as a result of a commission from Transit Display, Inc., had his painting displayed on the side of hundreds of buses in twenty American cities. He has had solo exhibitions in New York at ACA Galleries, Gallery Henoch, and Littlejohn-Smith Gallery, and has participated in New York group exhibitions at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion Museum, the Museum of the City of New York, and the Armory, and internationally at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, Art Basel, and Art Cologne. Ferguson’s work is in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the British Museum, the New York Public Library, the Museum of the City of New York, the U.S. State Department, the Forbes Magazine Collection, and the Brooklyn Historical Society.\n\nHerb Fichter (1920-1995)\n\nIn addition to being one of the most celebrated bank-note engravers of North America, Herb Fichter was also a painter and printmaker. Born on December 25, 1920 in New York City, as a child he was always fascinated with miniatures, especially stamps, and he planned to be a professional illustrator. He attended Pratt Institute and won a scholarship to the New York School of Fine and Applied Arts in 1939. In 1941 he enrolled in the 10-year apprenticeship program at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, where he mastered the “bank-note” or “Morghenesque” style of engraving, a craft of such detail that Fichter could spend up to four months on a two-inch square area of a steel plate. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, he volunteered for the Army and served under General Patton from 1942 to 1945. Fichter earned five battle stars, fought in five major campaigns, and earned the Medal of Verdun.\n\nWhen he returned home, he resumed his apprenticeship and was selected to exhibit at the Corcoran Gallery of Art, in a show that brought him national recognition and led to his membership in Washington’s Society of Miniature Painters, Sculptors, Etchers, and Engravers, the Chicago Society of Etchers, and the Boston Printmaker’s Society. His quickly growing reputation led to a show at the Smithsonian Institution. Fichter brought an unusual degree of creativity to his position as a bank-note engraver. In 1962, he became the Chief Engraver at the Jeffries Bank-Note of Los Angeles, but retired from that position in 1984 to focus on his own art. Over the next ten years, he had solo exhibitions of his work at the Department of Agriculture in Washington, DC and the Fine Arts Federation in Los Angeles. He participated in group exhibitions at the Carnegie Institute, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Library of Congress. Many significant public and private institutions collected his work, including the Library of Congress, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Time-Life Magazine, the American Print Collection, the Kennedy Memorial Library, the Bank of America, and the Wells Fargo Bank. Before he died in 1995, Fichter was one of only fifteen master bank-note engravers on the North American continent.\n\nErnest Fiene (1894-1965)\n\nA German-American lithographer and painter, Ernest Fiene created mostly landscapes and city views. Born in Elberfeld, Germany in 1894, Fiene immigrated to the United States with his family in his youth. He studied at the National Academy of Design between 1914 and 1918, while also taking classes at the Beaux Arts Institute. When Fiene attended the Art Students League in 1923, he studied with Joseph Pennell and Charles Wheeler Locke and learned the art of lithography, the medium for which he would be most recognized. Fiene traveled to Europe at the end of the 1920s and studied at L’Académie de La Grande Chaumière in Paris. During a brief return to the New York Area, he taught at the Westchester County Center but left again for Europe in 1932. In Florence, he learned the technique of fresco painting, which prepared him well for WPA mural commissions upon his return to the United States. He painted a post office mural in Canton, Massachusetts titled “Paul Revere as an Industrialist,” a 2,000-square-foot fresco mural for New York’s High School of Needle Trades, and third mural in Washington, DC.\n\nFiene continued to pursue lithography. In the 1930s and 1940s, his idyllic landscapes, industrial cityscapes, and labor themes were well received. He was loosely associated with the American Art Deco movement, and the flattened shapes of mountains, trees, and buildings in his paintings resonated with the aesthetic of the era. Fiene taught art at schools across the country, including the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center and Cooper Union in New York. He was a member of the Art Students League from 1938 to 1964 and served as a supervising faculty member at the Famous Artists School in Westport, Connecticut. His work has been collected by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Library of Congress, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Boston Museum of Fine Art, the Tel Aviv Museum in Israel, the Los Angles County Museum of Art, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Art, the National Academy of Design, and the Phillips Collection, among others. He died in Connecticut in 1965.\n\nTully Filmus (1903-1998)\n\nTully Filmus was a Russian-American realist painter whose work stemmed from his deep involvement with the Jewish community. Born in 1903 in Otaki, Russia, Filmus came to the United States with his family at an early age. He won a scholarship to the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and was chosen to attend seminars with Dr. Albert Barnes at the Barnes Foundation, where he was exposed to the French painters who were transforming the art world, including Renoir, Cézanne, Matisse, and Picasso. In 1927, he won a Cresson Traveling Fellowship that enabled him to study in Paris with André Lhote and to work independently in Florence, Rome, and Munich. Filmus returned to America in the midst of the Depression but he found support in the friendships of other artists, including Anton Refregier and Willem de Kooning. He settled in New York, where he would remain for the rest of his life, and took classes at New York University and the Art Students League.\n\nFilmus primarily painted New York urban scenes, but after the horrors of the Holocaust he focused particularly on life in the Jewish community. He believed that his talent must be used to preserve memories of the lost shtetl culture and to document contemporary Jewish life. He demonstrated great sensitivity to his subjects and an ability to capture their energy and individuality. His preferred medium was oil painting, although his drawings also earned critical acclaim. Filmus taught at both the American Artists School in New York and Cooper Union. He exhibited regularly, showing at the American Artists Congress from 1935 to 1939, the Whitney Museum of American art from 1940 to 1946, the Art Institute of Chicago in 1941, the Carnegie Institute from 1941 to 1946, the Corcoran Gallery in 1941, and the ACA Gallery in New York in the 1970s. His portraits of Army and Navy officials are in the Headquarters of the New York National Guard, and his work can be found in the permanent collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Joslyn Art Museum in Omaha, Nebraska, and the Syracuse University Museum. Filmus died in 1968 in his home in Fern Hill, New York.\n\nIsaac Friedlander (1890-1968)\n\nIsaac Friedlander’s politically-charged prints attest to his traumatic adolescence in Latvia. He was born in 1890 in Mitau (now known as Jelgava), Latvia, then part of the Russian Empire. He was arrested at sixteen and sent to a Czarist prison (conflicting reports on the cause of his arrest suggest that either Friedlander had been protesting curfews and compulsory uniforms or was falsely accused of killing his teacher). He spent four years in prison, many of them in solitary confinement. During that time he became interested in art, and when he was released went to Italy to study painting and printmaking. Other than a brief period of study at the Academy of Rome, where he learned etching, drawing, and relief printing, he had no formal art training. In Rome, he associated with Russian expatriate artists, particularly Maxim Gorky who was very supportive of his work. After the Revolution of 1917, Friedlander returned to Russia and settled in Latvia where he taught art to middle and high school students. He married there and had a daughter, but divorced in 1929; his wife and child would later perish in the Holocaust. His cousin, art collector Joseph Hirshhorn, encouraged him to come to North America and paid for his passage to Toronto through New York. He married his second wife in Toronto in 1937 and the couple immigrated to New York City. Hirshhorn and Friedlander had a falling out, so this connection did not advance Friedlander’s career, but a large collection of his prints ended up in the Hirshhorn Museum nonetheless.\n\nNew York City became the main subject of Friedlander’s work, and his prints of this period display two faces of city life at the time: those exploring the effects of the Great Depression depict poverty with a grim realism; his prints of New York performers celebrate vitality. Between 1939 and 1943, he created his “Autobiography” prints, whose complex compositions swirl with linear movement. When news reached him of the Holocaust, he made an arresting series of somber works, whose emotion is intensified by the dramatic contrast of light and shadow. Friedlander died in New York in 1968 but his widow survived him to see many exhibitions of his work. In 1984 Georgetown University exhibited his Holocaust prints in an exhibition titled “My People, Their Suffering, Their Sustaining Faith” and his widow donated over 100 prints to the Georgetown University Graphic Arts Collection. In 1991, the Jane Halsem Gallery mounted a mini-retrospective of his work. Friedlander’s prints can be found in the collections of the Neuburger Museum in Purchase, New York, the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC, the Brooklyn Museum, the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, among others.\n\nTully Filmus (1903-1998)\n\nTully Filmus was a Russian-American realist painter whose work stemmed from his deep involvement with the Jewish community. Born in 1903 in Otaki, Russia, Filmus came to the United States with his family at an early age. He won a scholarship to the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, and was chosen to attend seminars with Dr. Albert Barnes at the Barnes Foundation, where he was exposed to the French painters who were transforming the art world, including Renoir, Cézanne, Matisse, and Picasso. In 1927, he won a Cresson Traveling Fellowship that enabled him to study in Paris with André Lhote and to work independently in Florence, Rome, and Munich. Filmus returned to America in the midst of the Depression but he found support in the friendships of other artists, including Anton Refregier and Willem de Kooning. He settled in New York, where he would remain for the rest of his life, and took classes at New York University and the Art Students League.\n\nFilmus primarily painted New York urban scenes, but after the horrors of the Holocaust he focused particularly on life in the Jewish community.

He was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1929 and attended the Art School of the Brooklyn Museum from 1948 to 1950. After serving in the military during the Korean War, he began studying at the School of Visual Arts in New York, winning prizes for drawing and illustration. After he left school, the scratchy, folksy style of his woodcuts gained recognition and he began exhibiting throughout the United States. Garchik had one-man shows in New York, Chicago, and Toronto, Canada. Also an accomplished illustrator, he has published illustrations in many books and magazines, including Harpers. Besides illustrating many fine novels of fiction and children’s literature, Garchik authored two important books on art instruction, Art Fundamentals: Basics of Drawing, Painting, Sculpture and Printmaking (1979) and Creative Visual Thinking (1981). Many of his original prints were published by the Associated American Artists of New York, which from the 1930s to the mid- 1980s was a leading publisher of American lithographs, etchings, and woodcuts. His work can be found in the collection of the MIT List Visual Arts Center.\n\nAlbert Gold (1916-1972)\n\nA Philadelphia artist with a social conscience, Albert Gold worked in a wide variety of media. Born in 1916 in Philadelphia, Gold studied at the Philadelphia Museum School of Art from 1935 to 1939 with Henry Pitz, Franklin Wakins, and Earl Horter. His artistic training landed him a position as a combat artist in England during World War II. After the war, he returned home to work in painting and printmaking, exploring the scenes and characters of urban life. He became interested in the history of American illustration, and began to teach courses in illustration at the Philadelphia College of Art, becoming director of the Illustration Department after 1950.\n\nGold illustrated many publications, including the Army magazines Salute and Yank. During his lifetime, he exhibited at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the World’s Fair in New York, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Philadelphia Art Alliance, the Venice Biennale of 1941, and the National Gallery in London. His commissions include twelve paintings of Pennsylvania for the Gimbel Brothers (1947-1948) and murals for the Bureau of Agriculture. His work is in the collections of the New York Public Library, the Pentagon, the United States War Department, the University of Pennsylvania, and the Abbott Laboratories. Gold died in 1972.\n\nNorman Goldberg (1921-1998)\n\nA representational artist specializing in New York street scenes, Norman Goldberg was also an active liberal and political cartoonist. Born in June of 1921, Goldberg lived in New York City for most of his life. In his youth, he was a professional boxer, but retired when he found that the lifestyle did not suit him. Always an admirer of representational art, Goldberg attended the Art Students League and began making art seriously. His work was always infused with his leftist politics and he achieved modest fame as a witty political cartoonist. He greatly admired the Mexican muralists Diego Rivera and Jose Clemente Orozco, and their influence can be seen in his many street scenes of New York neighborhoods. Before his death in 1998, Goldberg taught at Cooper Union and married twice. Many of his works are now in the Connecticut home of his second wife, Mildred Goldberg.\n\nLeon Golub (1922-2004)\n\nLeon Golub made a significant contribution to twentieth-century painting with his representations of war and racial conflict. Originally from Chicago, Golub was born in 1922 and earned his B.A. in art history from the University of Chicago in 1942. Immediately after graduation, he served in the U.S. Army Engineers as a cartographer during World War II. After the war, he earned a B.F.A. (1949) and M.F.A. (1950) from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago on the GI Bill. In 1951 he married artist Nancy Spero, who would be his companion for the next fifty years. The couple often exhibited together and won several joint awards.\n\nGolub’s work was largely a personal response to the political and social forces that he saw shape the world during the Vietnam War and at home in the United States. He depicted power relationships, war, human suffering, racism, and terrorism, aiming to depict violence differently from the way it was portrayed by the media. This work evolved as did America’s participation in world politics. After World War II, his paintings were full of the kings, monsters, shamans, and warriors of classical art. His Vietnam-era series “Napalm and Vietnam” focused Golub’s social conscience from the generic to specific outrage. During the 1970s, he painted portraits of political and religious leaders, from Castro and Franco to Nixon and Kissinger. In the 1980s he explored terrorism in its many forms − killing fields, political oppression, torture, sexual enslavement, and urban street violence. From hundreds of photographs of people, he amalgamated figures that were flat and stranded on a color plane. Golub likened the physical act of painting to a sculptural technique, repeatedly layering and scraping away the surface of a work until it bore its own history of markings.\n\nAfter brief sojourns in Florence (1956-1957) and Paris (1959-1964), with the help of a Ford Foundation Grant) that were motivated by the belief that Europeans would be more receptive to Golub’s representational style, Golub and Spero settled in New York, where he divided his time between making art, teaching, writing, and political activism. Golub taught at Write Junior College in Chicago (1950-1955), Indiana University (1957-1959), the Institute of Design at the Illinois Institute of Technology, the School of Visual Arts in New York, and in later years as Professor in the Visual Arts Department at Rutgers University. He was active in the Artists and Writers Protest Group against the war in Vietnam from 1964 to 1972, authored essays on contemporary art, and wrote for Artforum.\n\nGolub had his first solo show at the Contemporary Gallery in Chicago in 1950, followed by one-man exhibitions at the Pasadena Museum of Art, the Institute of Contemporary Art in London, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York, the Saatchi Collection in London, the Eli Broad Family Foundation in Los Angeles, the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia, the Brooklyn Museum, the Musée d’Art Contemporaine de Montréal, and the Malmö Konsthall in Malmö, Sweden. He participated in group shows, including the Museum of Modern Art (1959), the Sao Paulo Biennial (1962), the Corcoran Gallery Biennial (1963), the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts (1964, 1966), the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago (1972), and the Whitney Museum of American Art. His work is in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the National Collection of Fine Arts, the Smithsonian Institution, the Hirshhorn Museum, and the Tel Aviv Museum of Art in Israel, among others. Golub died in 2004.\n\nBernard Gotfryd\n\nPhotographer and Holocaust survivor Bernard Gotfryd was born in Radom, Poland. He knew that he wanted to be a photographer from an early age and, just after World War II broke out, he began an apprenticeship at a photography studio owned by a family friend. He became involved with the Polish resistance and risked his life to steal photographs of Nazi atrocities that SS and Gestapo members had taken to the studio where he worked. With the help of the resistance movement, he attempted an escape in 1943 but was caught and sent to the Majdanek concentration camp. By the time of his liberation in 1945, he had survived six concentration camps: Majdenek, Plaszow, Wieliczka Salt Mines, Mauthausen, Gusen1, and Gusen 2.\n\nIn 1947 Gotfryd came to the United States and began his career as a photojournalist. When he was drafted into the US Army in 1949, he became a combat photographer to the 3rd Signal Corps. He joined the staff of Newsweek in 1957 and for the following thirty years photographed celebrities in the arts, letters, and politics. Among his many subjects were Woody Allen, Saul Bellow, Toni Morrison, Betty Friedan, Primo Levi, Robert Moses, Leonard Bernstein, Yitzchak Rabin, Harold Bloom, and Alan Greenspan. He exhibited his work at the Brooklyn Museum of Art in 1976.\n\nOnly after photographing Holocaust survivors in Washington for Newsweek did Gotfryd begin to write about his own experiences. The result was a collection of twenty-one short stories, Anton the Dove Fancier and Other Tales of the Holocaust, which became instantly successful both in the U.S, and in Europe. In 1991 he won the Pen/Martha Albrand Special Citation for non-fiction by an American writer. Danish playwrights bought the rights to eight stories in Anton and in 1996 the play opened to critical acclaim. Gotfryd now divides his time between Forest Hills and Easthampton, New York, and continues to pursue his writing, lecturing, and photography.\n\nMelissa Gould\n\nContemporary artist Melissa Gould depicts the horrors of the Holocaust in a variety of media. Born in New York, Gould earned her B.F.A. in photography at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) and completed the RISD European Honors Program in Rome. She has been making conceptual art, installations, sculptures, and prints about the Holocaust for over a decade. She appropriates and transforms historical artifacts, often playing with language to make political statements. Among her most significant projects are the Schadenfreude Installation for which she created wallpaper and faux historical objects, and the photolithograph Neu-York, a collaboration with Jonathan Higgins and Katy Lyness, in which she digitally manipulated vintage maps of Manhattan, replacing all of the street and place names with those from World War II-era Berlin to offer a vision of what New York would have been like had the Nazis won the Second World War. Gould states that it is also “an exploration of psychological transport, place, displacement, and memory. This re-imagining of the city plays with comparison and misrecognition, exploring the coexistence of past and present, fiction and reality.”\n\nGould has also collaborated with the musician Alvin Curran on sound installations and she has worked in graphic design and website design. In the past decade, she has exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art, the Bronx Museum of the Arts, MASS MoCA, the Noekulturforum in Austria, Exit Art, Artists Space, the International Print Center in New York, and the White Box Gallery in New York. Her work can be found in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum, the RISD Design Museum, the Zimmerli Museum of Fine Arts at Rutgers University, and in numerous private collections. Gould currently lives and works in New York City.\n\nGrace Graupe-Pillard (1945- )\n\nGrace Graupe-Pillard is a contemporary artist whose work combines political subjects with “personal reverberations.” Her German-Jewish parents fled their home country in the 1930s and settled in the Washington Heights neighborhood of New York City. Sixty-eight members of their family were killed during the Holocaust. The burden of those deaths weighed heavily on the couple as they raised a family of their own. Graupe-Pillard and her twin sister were born in New York City, where their father and mother were working as an architect and a dress designer, respectively. Graupe-Pillard began to draw at a young age, but did not initially pursue an education in art until she had completed her B.A. in history and political science at the City College of New York in 1963 and did graduate work in Russian studies at the City University of New York. At this point she turned to art and began taking painting and figure drawing at the Art Students League of New York.\n\nGraupe-Pillard began to produce art that explored ideas, outsider artists, trauma, war, and the media. She tends to work in series which address specific political issues. In a series about the Holocaust, titled “Nowhere to Go,” she combined painted images with photographs from her father’s collection of materials on the Shoah. The series was shown at the New Jersey State Museum in Trenton and ten of the paintings were turned into banners and purchased by her mother’s hometown of Rheda-Weidenbruck in Germany. Graupe-Pillard’s work changed dramatically when she began to explore digital media. She discovered Adobe Photoshop, and began to alter her source imagery, modifying and appropriating images from movies, newspapers, and art history, creating dynamic compositions painted in oil and alkyd on large, sometimes cutout canvases. In her most recent project, “Interventions,” she collaged images of the war in Iraq with photographs of ordinary American East Coast landscapes, and projected these digital images to an accompanying soundtrack. She has shown this work at Donahue/Sosinski Art and The Proposition in New York.\n\nGraupe-Pillard has had solo shows at the New Jersey Center for the Visual Arts, the New Jersey State Museum, the Port Authority at 42nd Street, Hal Bromm Gallery, and Klarfeld Perry Gallery. She has participated in multiple group shows at the Drawing Center, the Museum of Modern Art, Exit Art, the New Museum of Contemporary Art, and P.S.1., and at the Contemporary Museum of Baltimore and the Rhode Island School of Design. Her work has been commissioned for display at the New Jersey Transit, the Port Authority Bus Terminal in New York, AT&T, and American Express. Her work can be found in the permanent collections of the Library of Congress, the National Museum of Women in the Arts, the New School for Social Research, the Zimmerli Art Museum at Rutgers University, the New Jersey State Museum, the AT&T Corporation, and the Newark Museum. Graupe-Pillard currently lives with her husband in a former synagogue in New Jersey.\n\nWilliam Gropper (1897-1977)\n\nBest known for his bitterly satirical cartoons, William Gropper was a painter, lithographer, cartoonist, and illustrator whose difficult childhood in New York motivated his social criticism. In 1897 Gropper was born to immigrant parents from the Ukraine and Romania who had met in the garment industry in New York City. He worked in the sweatshops as a small child, a horrific experience necessitated by his family’s limited income. Despite his obligation to work, Gropper began drawing at the age of six and took art classes with George Bellows and Robert Henri at the Ferrer School when he was thirteen. His professors encouraged freedom of expression and nonconformity, giving Gropper the confidence to develop his bold style. He won a scholarship to the National Academy of Design in 1913 but was expelled because his education was at odds with the traditional discipline. He was later discovered during his courses at the Ferrer School by Frank Parsons, the president of the New York School of Fine and Applied Arts. Under Parsons’s mentoring, Gropper excelled and gained a reputation in New York. Following in the footsteps of the social realists Goya and Daumier, his work confronted the hypocrisies of the social elite and the humor of everyday urban life. His flare for capturing the essence of gestures and personalities with a few bold, wiry lines was recognized by The New York Tribune, Vanity Fair, and Spur, who hired him as a cartoonist in 1917. After 1921, Gropper began painting seriously, always beginning with a series of drawings.\n\nGropper had his first one-man show in 1936 at a New York gallery. In the 1930s he was on the editorial board of New Masses, and completed WPA murals at the Department of the Interior in Washington, DC, the U.S. Post Office in Freeport, New York, and the Northwestern Postal Station in Detroit, Michigan. During his life he made several series of artworks; after visiting Eastern Europe in 1948, he decided to make one painting a year as a memorial to the victims of the Warsaw Ghetto.\n\nCommissioned by the Associated American Artists, he tried etching for the first time in 1965 and created a portfolio of prints. He exhibited his work at the ACA Gallery in New York, the Society of Independent Artists, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Corcoran Gallery Biennials from 1941 to 1953, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts from 1939 to 1948, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the National Academy of Design, the Museum of Modern Art, the Manne Museum in Prague, and the Piccadilly Gallery in London. In addition, the municipal governments of Moscow, Warsaw, Sofia, and Prague arranged one-man shows for him. His work is in the permanent collections of major museums throughout the world, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American art, the Phillips Collection, the Museum of Western Art in Moscow, the National Gallery in Prague, and the Art Institute of Chicago. Groppe died in 1977 in Great Neck Estates, New York.\n\nChaim Gross (1904-1991)\n\nChaim Gross was born in 1904 in Wolowa, Austria and moved with his family to Kolomyya in 1907. His father and other relatives were lumbermen who passed their leisure hours whittling objects out of wood. Gross always associated wood carving with the peaceful years of his childhood, before the invasion of the Russian Cossacks, who in 1914 dispersed his family. Gross fled to Vienna, where he began to draw and quickly attracted attention for his skill. He entered a competition and won a full scholarship to the Kunstgewerbeschule art school. In 1921, he came to New York and attended the Educational Alliance Art School, where he befriended Moses and Raphael Soyer, Peter Blume, and Adolph Gottlieb and became acquainted with Ben Shahn and Barnett Newman. He continued his studies at the Beaux Arts Institute of Design in New York and at the Art Students League, where, under the guidance of Robert Laurent, he learned the method of direct carving, and became one of the leading artists working in the medium.\n\nGross created elegant, inventive figures in wood, often based on circus performers and dancers. His primitivist style and interest in performers was shared with other modern sculptors. After the Holocaust, during which he lost two siblings and a niece, Gross turned to Jewish subject matter for the first time. Projecting the personalities of his lost family members onto mythical Jewish figures, he created poignant portraits carved from wood. In the 1950s Gross branched out to bronze casting and furthered his explorations in watercolor, drawing, and illustration.\n\nIn the 1920s and 30s, Gross exhibited frequently at the Society of Independent Artists. Subsequently, he showed at the Gallery 144, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, the Whitney Museum of American Art Biennial, the Brooklyn Museum, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Museum of Modern Art. The Jewish Museum in New York held a large retrospective of his work in 1977, which included 200 works. Gross’s work is in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Hirshhorn Museum, and the Smithsonian Institution. His public sculptures can be seen at Fordham University and Pace University in New York.\n\nGross never stopped experimenting in different media; he illustrated children’s stories by N. Gross and wrote essays on art and art films. He taught for sixty years, beginning in 1927, at the Educational Alliance Art School, and in 1948 joined the faculty of the New School for Social Research. The artist died in 1991.\n\nRichard Gross\n\nRichard Gross currently lives in New York City and has been a practicing artist since the 1960s. He attended Central High School in Philadelphia, which was a starting point for such renowned artists as Julius Bloch, John Sloan, and Thomas Eakins. Early in his career, he devoted his art to expressing the horrors of the Holocaust. The painting included in the Balka Collection exemplifies his life-long project.\n\nJolán Gross-Bettelheim (1900-1972)\n\nJolán Gross Bettelheim was one of the most celebrated female WPA artists in Cleveland. She was born in 1900 in Nyitra, Hungary but left Hungary at the age of nineteen to study art in Europe. She studied at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Vienna from 1919 to 1920 with the Expressionist painter Emil Orlik, and at the Akademie für Bildende Kunste (Academy of Fine Arts) in Berlin from 1920 to 1922 with Karl Hofer. During the two years she spent in Paris from 1922 to 1924, she took classes at L’Académie de la Grande Chaumière and L’École des Beaux Arts. Her work from this period, primarily in painting and pastels, shows the influence of her Expressionist mentors. After Bettelheim married a Hungarian in 1925, she moved with him to Cleveland, Ohio, which was a common destination for Hungarian immigrants. There she studied at the Cleveland School of Art under the modernist Henry Keller and developed her skills in etching and lithography. She exhibited frequently during the following thirteen years and focused her attention on printmaking. This shift in medium reflects the popularity of printmaking both in Cleveland and during the interwar period. Her etchings, drypoints, and lithographs were exhibited almost annually at the Cleveland Museum of Art from 1927 to 1937.\n\nIn 1936, Bettelheim joined the Graphics Division of the Federal Art Project (FAP), which was a branch of the WPA. Like most of the artists working for the FAP, Bettelheim depicted American scenes with a realist style heavily influenced by Modernism. The members of the Cleveland FAP were also known for their left-wing slant and Bettelheim was no exception; she was a member of the Communist Party and published her prints in the left-of-center publication New Masses. Her work from this period depicts urban architecture, the struggles of the working class, and the threat of war. In addressing all of these subjects, she employed a style that combined elements of Futurism, Constructivism, Expressionism, and Cubism. In 1938, she and her husband moved to the Jackson Heights neighborhood of Queens, New York, and Bettelheim began exhibiting across the United States, at the Library of Congress, the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the Seattle Art Museum, the San Francisco Museum of Art, and the Art Institute of Chicago. Bettelheim’s husband died suddenly in 1956, prompting her to move back to Hungary, in time to witness the failed revolution. The Hungarian artistic community was disillusioned and scattered at the time and she found it increasingly difficult to make art. Bettelheim died in Hungary in 1972 but her work can be found in the permanent collections of the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Library of Congress, the Seattle Art Museum, and the Brooklyn Museum.\n\nElias Mandel Grossman (1898-1947)\n\nA skilled etcher and engraver, Elias Mandel Grossman sought out unusual characters and landscapes as his subjects. Born in Kobryn, Russia in 1898, Grossman immigrated to the United States in his youth and settled in Brooklyn, New York. He studied art at the Educational Alliance Art School, Cooper Union, and the Art Students League. In New York, Grossman studied with William Starkweather, a landscape and portrait painter, and during a brief stay in Paris, he took classes with Réné Ligeron. Grossman soon gravitated to printmaking and perfected a traditional, representational technique in etching and engraving.\n\nWhile still at art school, he developed an interest in the odd characters that wandered the streets of New York City and he often invited eccentrics up to his studio to pose. He became skilled at capturing the personalities of his sitters and eventually did portraits of notable figures such as Albert Einstein, Benito Mussolini, Mahatma Ghandi, as well as many important Jewish intellectuals. In addition to his portraits, Grossman was celebrated for his urban views of New York City and other major American centers. During the 1930s and 1940s, he traveled the world in search of scenes and interesting characters, visiting London, Egypt, Italy, Spain, Poland, France, Belgium, and Holland. Of all of his destinations, he was most inspired by Israel and completed many etchings of important religious sites.\n\nFrom the late 1930s through the 1940s, Grossman exhibited extensively at the Grand Central Art Gallery, the Maryland Institute, the Library of Congress, and the National Academy of Design. In 1937, he published a book of annotated etchings titled An Etcher’s Intimate Album.

The artist died in Brooklyn, New York in 1947.\n\nGeorge Grosz (1893-1959)\n\nKnown for his pitiless caricatures of German society figures and politicians, George Grosz was an important member of the Berlin Dada group. Grosz’s childhood years were divided between Berlin, where he was born in 1893, and Stolp, Pomerania, to which his family moved. When his father died in 1900, Grosz’s mother moved the children back to Berlin, but Grosz returned to Stolp to take private drawing lessons. He was expelled from grammar school as a youth but accepted into the Royal Academy in Dresden, where he studied from 1909 to 1911. In 1912, after receiving honors from the Academy, Grosz moved to Berlin and took classes at the Art School of the Museum of Arts and Crafts. His skill was in drawing, but he also undertook projects in book illustration and began painting in oil.\n\nHe visited Paris for the first time in 1913, and a year later was conscripted into the German army. Grosz was released in 1915 as unfit for duty, but the Germany army, desperate for soldiers, enlisted him again in 1917. After attempting suicide and being threatened with execution, he was discharged and immediately joined the Communist Party. After 1918 Grosz was a leading member of the Berlin Dada group, which included Otto Dix, Max Ernst, and Kurt Schwitters, and he made collages characteristic of that movement. He enjoyed moderate commercial success; he sold a painting and had his first one-man exhibit"
