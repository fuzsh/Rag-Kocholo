A Spanish-style estate originally built by the famed silent film-era comedian Harold Lloyd as a getaway has come on the Palm Springs market for $4.695 million.

Completed in 1925 and recently expanded and remodeled, the 5,097-square-foot residence sits on 1 acre in the Movie Colony on North Avenida Palmas. It features five bedrooms, six bathrooms, and a 1,000-bottle, temperature-controlled wine cellar and tasting room at the bottom of a spiral staircase.

The main house opens to a large entry hall. Nearby, there’s a sunken living room and a separate den with a built-in bookcase. In one of two master suites is a large dressing area in the bathroom.

Interiors include a formal dining room, a large kitchen with an island and a breakfast area and eclectic touches at the hand of a Feng Shui designer that recall Moroccan, Asian and Spanish styles. Other features are hand-painted beamed ceilings, tiled flooring, ironwork, several fireplaces, ceiling fans and French doors.

Also on the grounds are two guest houses. One has two bedrooms and bathrooms and a living room. The second guest house has a bedroom that opens to the living room, a separate dining room and a full kitchen.

Outdoor features include a barbecue kitchen and dining area, fire pit and swimming pool and spa with mountain views.

According to the listing, the home is offered fully furnished artworks and all.

Harry Sterling of Coldwell Banker Realty holds the listing.

Lloyd, who died in 1971 at age 77, was a contemporary of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. He made nearly 200 films between 1914 and 1947. His most popular was the 1925 comedy film “The Freshman,” about an incoming freshman who joins the college football team, hoping it makes him popular.

In 1953, Lloyd received an Honorary Oscar for being a “master comedian and good citizen.”
