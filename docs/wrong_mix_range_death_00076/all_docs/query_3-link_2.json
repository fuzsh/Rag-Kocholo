        "text": "Harold Clayton Lloyd, Sr. (April 20, 1893 – March 8, 1971) was an American actor, comedian, and stunt performer. He was in many silent comedy movies.[1] Lloyd made over 200 comedy movies from 1914 to 1947. These movies were both without and with sound. He usually played as a zeitgeist 1920s-era character.[2][3]\n\nHis movies usually had \"thrill\" sections where Lloyd would be in fast chases and performed his own stunts. Lloyd did these dangerous stunts himself even though a movie accident had caused the loss of his right thumb and index finger. After that accident, he used a prosthetic glove. This glove was not noticeable in his movies.[4]\n\nAlthough Lloyd's movies were not as commercially successful as Chaplin's, Lloyd made a lot more money than Chaplin during their movie years. ($15.7 million to Chaplin's $10.5 million).\n\nIn 1971, Lloyd died of prostate cancer.\n\nIn March 8, 1971, Lloyd died of prostate cancer. He died in his Greenacres home in Beverly Hills, California.[5][6][7] His co-star Bebe Daniels died eight days after him.[8] His son Harold Lloyd Jr. died three months after him.[9][10]\n\nAgee, James (2000) [1958]. \"Comedy's Greatest Era\" from Life magazine (9/5/1949), reprinted in Agee on Film.
