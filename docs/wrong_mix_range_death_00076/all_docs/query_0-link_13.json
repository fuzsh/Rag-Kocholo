        "text": "The following is an episode list for the crime fiction television series Columbo. After two pilot episodes, the show originally aired on NBC from 1971 to 1978 as one of the rotating programs of The NBC Mystery Movie. Columbo then aired less frequently on ABC beginning in 1989. The last installment was broadcast in 2003.\n\nBecause the Columbo episodes from 1989 to 2003 aired infrequently, different DVD sets have been released around the world. In Region 2 and 4, all episodes have now been released as 10 seasons, with the 10th season covering the last 14 episodes from \"Columbo Goes to College\" (1990) to the series finale, \"Columbo Likes the Nightlife\" (2003).[1] In France and the Netherlands (also Region 2), however, the DVDs were released as 12 seasons.[2] In Region 1, all episodes from season 8 are grouped differently; all the episodes that were originally aired on ABC were released as the COLUMBO: The Mystery Movie Collection.[3] For the sake of clarity, all episodes in this article are arranged as they appear in the UK release.\n\nBefore Peter Falk was cast in the role of Columbo, Bert Freed played the character in \"Enough Rope\", a 1960 episode of The Chevy Mystery Show, a TV anthology series. In 1962, that episode became a stage play titled Prescription: Murder, which starred Thomas Mitchell as Columbo, Joseph Cotten and Agnes Moorehead as Roy and Claire Flemming, and Patricia Medina as Flemming's mistress.[4]\n\nThe play was adapted to a made-for-TV movie in 1968, with Falk debuting in the role. In this made-for-TV movie, Columbo—rather than making the rumpled presentation that later became the character's trademark—is less shabbily dressed, wearing suits, shorter hair, and heavier stage makeup. He carries a raincoat, which would become a staple. He wears the raincoat in most of the scenes. He also appears somewhat more aggressive when confronting suspects.\n\nNo. in\n\nseries Title Directed by Written by Murderer played by Victim played by Original air date Length 1\"Prescription: Murder\"Richard IrvingRichard Levinson & William Link\n\nbased on their playGene Barry as Ray FlemmingNina Foch as Carol FlemmingFebruary 20, 1968 ( )94 min\n\nDr. Ray Flemming (Gene Barry), a psychiatrist, murders his wife (Nina Foch) and persuades his mistress Joan Hudson (Katherine Justice), who is an actress and one of his patients, to support his alibi by impersonating her aboard his plane flight. Columbo notices that Flemming does not call out to his wife when he gets back.\n\nFinal clue/twist: Columbo stages the suicide of Flemming’s mistress, then urges him to confess now that the love of his life has killed herself for him. Flemming mocks Columbo's words, saying he never cared deeply for Joan and would have gotten rid of her eventually, anyway. Joan, listening in, agrees to testify against Flemming.\n\n2\"Ransom for a Dead Man\"Richard IrvingStory by : Richard Levinson & William Link\n\nTeleplay by : Dean HargroveLee Grant as Leslie WilliamsHarlan Warde as Paul WilliamsMarch 1, 1971 ( )92 min\n\nLeslie Williams (Lee Grant), a brilliant and ruthless lawyer, murders her husband Paul (Harlan Warde) to get his money, arranging the act to look as if he had been kidnapped and killed by his captors.\n\nFinal clue/twist: Margaret (Patricia Mattick), who hates her stepmother Leslie, tells Leslie she will go away if Leslie gives her a lot of money. When Leslie pays Margaret off with some of the ransom cash, Columbo, who had persuaded Margaret to demand money from Leslie, has the final proof he needs.\n\nMain article: Columbo (season 1)\n\nNo. in\n\nseries No. in\n\nseason Title Directed by Written by Murderer played by Victim(s) played by Original air date Runtime 31\"Murder by the Book\"Steven SpielbergSteven BochcoJack Cassidy\n\nas Ken FranklinMartin Milner\n\nas Jim Ferris and\n\nBarbara Colby\n\nas Lilly La SankaSeptember 15, 1971 ( )72 min 42\"Death Lends a Hand\"Bernard KowalskiRichard Levinson & William LinkRobert Culp\n\nas Carl BrimmerPatricia Crowley\n\nas Lenore KennicutOctober 6, 1971 ( )72 min 53\"Dead Weight\"Jack SmightJohn T.
