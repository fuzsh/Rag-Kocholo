        "text": "New Page 1\n\nDear Coverage Pointers Subscribers:\n\nOK, let's deal with the important question first. I LOVED the last episode of the Sopranos and thought the ending was brilliant. And while I don't know what happened to Tony and his family, I also don't know why the Mona Lisa is smiling. In either case, the artist's work can surely be appreciated. However, for the record, I still believe that Uncle Junior was in cahoots with Phil Leotardo and I'm still curious about the whereabouts of the Russian in the Pine Barrens episode.\n\nI'm off to the Federation of Defense & Corporate Counsel Litigation Management College Graduate Program at Emory University in Atlanta to reprise my role as Captain Coverage and present a program entitled \"Coverage College.\" If any of you are students of the college or the graduate program this year, please introduce yourself to me. We find subscribers everywhere. You can find more information about these great educational opportunities at the FDCC website, www.thefederation.org\n\nI will also be on the program in New York City in December for the DRI Insurance Coverage and Practice Symposium presenting on the duty to cooperate under the liability policy. For information on this program, visit the DRI website, www.dri.org\n\nThe appellate courts were raining coverage decisions upon the state's insurance professionals over the past two weeks, and interesting ones abound. The most important of all is Fourth Department's decision in Meegan where a slim 3-2 majority disagrees with the Second Department's decision in Raffellini and holds that an uninsured motorist applicant must establish a serious injury under the No Fault law in order to qualify for SUM benefits.\n\nYou'll also find a case where an additional insured (and those who were seeking to recover against it) lost coverage for failure to invest in a 39 cent stamp and notify a subcontractor's insurer of a loss.\n\nThere's an interesting case involving the question of whether or not a clause in a construction subcontract which incorporates the provision of the prime contract also incorporates insurance requirements. This court says, \"no.\"\n\nAnd we have two guest authors this week. Mike Perley ponies up a horse case of a different color and Chris Potenza offers a summary of a trial level decision on asbestos coverage, surely worth reading. It's a whack job, so to speak.\n\nAudrey Seeley, the Queen of No Fault, is on the road but e-mailed her column for submission. She offers these words:\n\nUsually Dan is the one saying he is greeting you from some far off beautiful destination and I am begging to get out of the office on training to one warm city. At the time of drafting this note I am greeting you from Atlanta where I am attending an annual panel counsel meeting! It was really nice to meet so many seasoned adjusters and attorneys that share the same philosophy on approaching and handling cases.\n\nThis edition brings additional cases demonstrating the evidentiary pitfalls on summary judgment. Some were favorable to the plaintiff and some were favorable to the insurer. In the arbitration world, there is a second decision reimbursing a physical therapist for electro-diagnostic testing. This is an area to watch! The physical therapist can conduct this testing but must be certified. We would recommend verifying the certification.\n\nI hope you enjoy this edition as I know that right now I am enjoying the warm sunny weather!\n\nAudrey\n\nBy the way, Audrey and her husband are just completing construction of a new home. I anticipate that she'll invite all of you to the housewarming.

Indian Harbor Insurance Company\n\nAppellate Division, First Department\n\nPolicy Allocation Between Insured and Uninsured Damages Upheld and Enforced\n\nThe insurer is only responsible for paying a portion of the insured’s claim for reimbursement based on the terms of the policy. Clear language in policy which provides for the allocation was enforced.\n\n6/12/07 In the Matter of New York Central Mutual Fire Ins. Co. v. Rafailov\n\nAppellate Division, Second Department\n\nClaimant Breaches Cooperation Clause and Loses Coverage for Uninsured Motorist Benefits\n\nIn order to establish breach of a cooperation clause, the insurer must show that the insured engaged in an unreasonable and willful pattern of refusing to answer material and relevant questions or to supply material and relevant documents. An insured's duty to cooperate is satisfied by substantial compliance, and where a delay in compliance is neither lengthy nor willful, and is accompanied by a satisfactory explanation, preclusion of a claim is inappropriate. A pattern of conduct here, including failure to comply with court orders compelling discovery, leads to finding of lack of cooperation and loss of coverage.\n\n6/12/07 R.C. Dolner, Inc., v. My-Way Contracting Corp\n\nAppellate Division, First Department\n\nFor Want of a Postage Stamp, Coverage is Lost\n\nGeneral contractor, entered into a subcontract with defendant My-Way for demolition work, pursuant to which My-Way procured a certificate of insurance and an insurance policy, issued by Landmark, naming My-Way and plaintiff as additional insureds. GC also obtained a separate policy, issued by US Fire, which would provide excess insurance over any primary insurance covering a loss, but otherwise would afford primary coverage.\n\nIn February 1999, during My-Way’s demo work, a piece of concrete fell damaging owner’s equipment. The owner paid $178K for repairs and deducted the amount from the total due plaintiff. GC notified its insurer, US Fire, of the incident on February 9, and forwarded two memoranda, dated March 2 and 3, on the cause, nature, and extent of the damages. On March 17, US Fire, on behalf of plaintiff, sent My-Way a notice of claim and requested that My-Way notify Landmark. Neither plaintiff nor US Fire directly notified Landmark. Rather, on December 13, US Fire sent My-Way a second notice of claim and again told My-Way to notify its insurer. It wasn’t until December 28, when My-Way asked Landmark to process the claim\n\nLandmark denied on late notice (10 months after the incident, nine months after My-Way was advised of a claim) by My-Way on January 24, the day its investigation was completed..\n\nNot surprisingly, the disclaimer holds up. The one month delay in denying coverage was surely reasonable, since the disclaimer was sent as soon as the investigation was completed.\n\nEarlier notice to My-Way was not notice to carrier (no agency relationship) and GC knew of identity of insurer.\n\nEditors Note: All the GC and US Fire needed to do to preserve the coverage were to invest in a single postage stamp and notify Landmark at the outset.\n\n6/8/07 Meegan v. Progressive Insurance Company\n\nAppellate Division, Fourth Department\n\nSerious Injury Finding IS NECESSARY to Recover Underinsured Benefits. Fourth Department Disagrees with Raffellini\n\nBack on October 28th, your editor was so taken aback by the Second Department decision in Raffellini that a special edition of Coverage Pointers hit the newsstand. The banner headline read:\n\n10/24/06 Raffellini v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company\n\nAppellate Division, Second Department\n\nUnderinsured Coverage (SUM) -- Intermediate Appellate Court Strikes Down Necessity to Establish Serious Injury to Qualify for SUM Recovery\n\nThis one is a show stopper. Halloween has come early in the Second Department.\n\nWell, the Fourth Department, in a 3-2 decision, has disagreed, holding that the mandatory policy language in the SUM endorsement is consistent with the statute [Insurance Law Section 3420(f)(2) and the Insurance Department interpretation of the statute is to be given consideration. Unlike the Second Department, the Fourth Department held that there is a necessity to establish a serious injury under the No Fault law in order to prove up an entitlement to underinsured motorists benefits.\n\nThe court also set aside a finding that an insurer could be held liable for consequential damages beyond the amount the claimant was entitled to under the SUM endorsement.\n\nEditor’s Note: Raffellini is on its way to the Court of Appeals, perhaps joined by this case.\n\n6/8/07 Lista v. Newton\n\nAppellate Division, Fourth Department\n\nWhen is a Horse Stall Not a Horse Stall? When it’s a House.\n\nThe Fourth Department extended the Labor Law Section 240 homeowner’s exemption to the construction of a horse stall. Mary Newton, the owner of a single family dwelling hired a contractor to build a horse stall in a barn on her property. Plaintiff (who has no recollection of the accident) was injured due to a fall from a ladder during construction. The Fourth Department didn’t “horse around” with this case dismissing the Labor Law §240 cause of action based on the exemption for owners of one and two family dwellings; holding that the horse stall was “directly related” to the residential use of the property and, therefore, within the holding of the Court of Appeals in Bartoo v. Buell (87 N.Y. 3d 362).\n\nIn a side note; the horse got off too. Plaintiff had claimed that the horse may have knocked him off the ladder but the Court applied the “vicious propensity” doctrine (perhaps a “first kick” rule) and dismissed that claim as well.\n\nEditor’s Note: Thanks to our Mike Perley for his contribution of this Labor Law case for your review and consideration. Yes, we recognize it isn’t a “coverage case” but it’s an interesting one nonetheless.\n\n6/12/07 Allstate Insurance Company v. American Home Assurance Company\n\nAppellate Division, First Department\n\nCourt Considers Whether Insured Follows it Own Fortunes in Reinsurance Claim\n\nCourt refuses to allow an insured to change its method of calculating occurrences in its submission of a reinsurance claim. The court rejects the insured attempts to reconfigure argument it made in underlying lawsuit on number of occurrences in order to maximize reinsurance.\n\n6/8/07 David Christa Construction, Inc. v. American Home Assurance Company\n\nAppellate Division, Fourth Department\n\nGet All the Players at the Table\n\nCarrier sought determination that its policy of insurance was excess over another company’s but the other company was not a party to the lawsuit. Court, understandably, refused to declare primacy without other company in the lawsuit since the determination would not be binding on that carrier otherwise.\n\nEditor’s Note: This issue comes up a lot. Who should be a party to a coverage dispute? If it is to be binding on other carriers or on the injured party, they must be invited to participate.\n\n6/8/07 Progressive Northeastern Ins. Co. v. Heath\n\nAppellate Division, Fourth Department\n\nCourt Reaffirms No-Prejudice Rule in Late Notice Case Involving Uninsured Motorists Benefits, Where Insurer was Not Given Timely Notice of Accident; Reckemeyer Distinguished\n\nIn July 2003, Heath was seriously injured as a passenger in a two-car collision. Insurer for car in which he was a passenger denied his claim on grounds that policy had expired and vehicle was uninsured. The insurance company for the second vehicle denied the claim on the ground that there was no liability for the accident on the part of its insured. The Motor Vehicle Accident Indemnification Corporation denied respondent's subsequent application for benefits on the ground that Heath was covered by policy insuring Heath’s parents, Progressive.\n\nOn March 16, 2004, Heath filed both a claim for no-fault benefits and an uninsured motorist (UM) claim with Progressive. Progressive paid benefits on the no-fault claim but disclaimed coverage on the UM claim based on the failure to give Progressive notice and proof of the claim as soon as practicable. When Heath informed Progressive of his intent to arbitrate his UM claim, Progressive commenced an CPLR article 75 proceeding seeking to stay arbitration.\n\nFirst of all, the payment of no fault benefits does not preclude Progressive’s right to deny UIM benefits on the basis of late notice.\n\nSecondly, since Progressive has no timely notice of accident, the no-prejudice rule still applies with respect to late notice of the UIM claim. The Court of Appeals has altered the no-prejudice rules in the UIM situation where the insurer has had timely notice of the accident but late notice of the lawsuit (Rekemeyer v State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 4 NY3d 468, 474-475). Here, Progressive did not receive timely notice of the accident.\n\n6/7/07 Fortress Insurance Company v. Kollander\n\nAppellate Division, First Department\n\nDental E&O Policy Only Covers Bodily Injury Claims\n\nInsurer issued a dental malpractice policy which covered claims for bodily injury arising out of professional services rendered. The claims against the dentist here did not see to recover such damages so, the insurer had no obligation to defend or indemnify. Unclear from the decision what kinds of claims were being pursued against the dentist.\n\n6/7/07 GZA GeoEnvironmental, Inc., New York State Liquidation Bureau\n\nAppellate Division, First Department\n\nNew York State Liquidation Bureau Need Not Pay Settlement Achieved in Violation of Stay Provisions\n\nDespite claims of estoppel on the part of the Liquidation Bureau, the state agency was not required to honor and pay settlement of case which was accomplished in violation of the stay of proceedings against insurer.\n\n6/7/07 Blake v. Ford Motor Company\n\nAppellate Division, First Department\n\nWithout Fiduciary Relationship, Insurer Not Liable for Failing to Warn of Rollover Risk\n\nVan owner sought to amend its complaint to allege claim against its own insurer for failing to warn owner of roll-over risks. Court refused to allow amendments. Insurer does not have the duty to its insured to warn of risk, in the absence of a fiduciary relationship.\n\n6/5/07 Adams v. Boston Properties Limited Partnership\n\nAppellate Division, First Department\n\nClause in Subcontract that Incorporates Main Contract Provisions by Reference, Does not Incorporate Insurance and Indemnity Requirements\n\nInteresting decision on a question that doesn’t come up very often. A subcontractor moved for summary judgment to dismiss claims for contractual indemnification and for breach of contract to provide insurance. The “promises” to provide indemnification and insurance were contained in the main contract between the owner and the general contractor. The subcontract incorporated the main contract provisions by reference. However, the court held that “incorporation clauses” in a construction subcontract which incorporate main contract clauses by reference bind a subcontractor ONLY as to prime contract provisions regarding scope and quality of work. They do not incorporate indemnity and insurance provisions.\n\n6/5/07 Steadfast Insurance Company v. Casden Properties, Inc.\n\nAppellate Division, First Department\n\nCalifornia Law Requires a Showing of Prejudice Before Denying Coverage on Late Notice, Even if Policy Doesn’t\n\nCarriers in New York should rejoice in the fact that they are not in California. This case involved a North Carolina death but apparently the parties agreed, or the court found, that California, rather than NY or NC law applied to the insurance issues. The policy provided that late notice voided coverage but did not require a showing of prejudice. The court found that California law would not permit a forfeiture of coverage based on late notice unless there was a finding of substantial prejudice to the insurer. Given these principles, a policy endorsement waiving the requirement that an insurer must demonstrate prejudice in order to disclaim for untimely notice, thereby waiving the Notice-Prejudice Rule, is void as against public policy\n\n6/5/07 Serio v. United States Fire Insurance Company\n\nAppellate Division, Second Department\n\nCourt Confuses State Fund and Liquidation Bureau; Court Appears to Confuse Additional Insured Coverage Analysis as Well\n\nThe Court confuses the Liquidation Bureau and the State Insurance Fund. Ahh well. The plaintiff in this case is the Superintendent of Insurance of the State of New York, as ancillary receiver of Credit General Insurance Company (Credit General). It appears that the Superintendent (undoubtedly through the Liquidation Bureau) provided a defense to an insured of Credit General and then, much later, sought to deny coverage. The court held that the State, in this capacity, was to be treated like any other insurer. As the insured was prejudiced by a late disclaimer (issued after liability was established and before a damages trial), estoppel set in and the State could not walk away from coverage.\n\nThe court then considered the issue of primacy between the policy issued to the insured by Credit General and one issued by United States Fire. The court held that the insured, Magen, was an additional insured under the Credit General policy and by reason of the subcontract between Magen and the named insured under the Credit General policy, Credit General’s coverage was primary (citing to Pecker Iron Works).\n\nEditors Note: The Second Department may have reached the right decision about primacy but the proper reasoning was not offered. The appropriate analysis was to look to the other insurance clauses of the Credit and US Fire policies to determine primary v. excess (or pro-ration). Generally, these clauses provide that if the insured (Magen in this case) becomes insured because the contract requires they be added an additional insured on a policy (e.g., the policy issued by Credit) that policy is primary.\n\n6/5/07 Dwyer v. First Unum Life Insurance Company\n\nAppellate Division, First Department\n\nMaterial Misrepresentation Intended to Defraud Individual Health or Disability Insurer Voids Policy\n\nHealth or disability insurer permitted to rescind policy ab initio which was in effect for two years by establishing a material misrepresentation intended to defraud the insurer. For the insurer to be entitled to rescind the policy ab initio, after it had been in existence for two years during the insured's lifetime, it must identify a material misrepresentation in the application that was intended to defraud the insurer. Here, defendants presented the affidavit of their chief underwriter, as well as the company guidelines, both of which establish that if defendants had known of plaintiff's history of chronic back pain, including his prescription medication for such pain and his hospitalization within five years prior to filling out the insurance application, they would not have issued the policy to plaintiff in its present form\n\nPlaintiff's intent to defraud defendants may also be determined as a matter of law where, as here, it is uncontested that he knew the answers he provided to the questions on the application were false, and he provided some partial answers, omitting only information that would actually have been relevant to a determination of his insurable risk\n\nRelevant section of insurance law provides:\n\nAfter two years from the date of issue of this policy no misstatements, except fraudulent misstatements, made by the applicant in the application for such policy shall be used to void the policy or to deny a claim for loss incurred or disability (as defined in the policy) commencing after the expiration of such two year period.\n\n5/29/07 In the Matter of Temple Const. Corp. v. Sirius America Insurance Company\n\nAppellate Division, Second Department\n\nLate Notice: An Insured’s Notice to a Broker is (Generally) Not Notice to its Carrier. Failure to Document File Leads to Waiver of Late Notice Defense by Insurer\n\nThere was a July 2004 accident involving Ramos, who worked for Temple Construction Co on the Bokharian Jewish Center premises. Sirius issued separate policies to Temple and Bokharian. Sirius received notice of the occurrence from Temple when Temple sent the original summons and complaint to the insurer in December 2004. Bokharian notified Sirius on May 4, 2005, when by sending it an amended complaint. Both insureds knew of the accident in July 2004.\n\nBoth Temple and Bokharian gave notice to a nonparty insurance broker, Northeastern Group, Ltd. (hereinafter Northeastern). Notice to a broker is not notice to a carrier unless there is 0roof that the broker was given authority to represent the insurer as its agent. No such proof here\n\nSirius denied coverage to Temple eight days after it received notice from Temple, so its denial is sustained. However, there was a 47-day delay in disclaiming to Bokharian and while Sirius contended that the delay was warranted by its need to investigate the occurrence, the record is silent as to the date Sirius completed its investigation. Accordingly, the denial of coverage as to Bokharian was considered untimely and the insurer has waived its late notice defense.\n\nEditor’s Note: It may well be that Sirius has a legitimate need to conduct a “late notice” investigation which could have excused the 47-day delay in denying coverage. However, there was no proof that it documented its file as to that investigation and there was a failure to establish when its investigation was completed (and thus, when the time to start counting days within which to timely disclaim would have commenced).\n\n5/8/07 Continental Casualty Company v. Employers Ins. of Wausau\n\nSupreme Court, New York County (Trial Level)\n\nPolicyholder Wins a Big One at Trial Level in Asbestos Matters – Asbestos Claims Not Restricted to Completed Operations Limits\n\nMaybe it was prompted by the recent episode of the Sopranos, in which Tony Soprano's crew dumps a truckload asbestos into the East River, but a Manhattan trial court has \"whacked\" the asbestos insurance industry in the recent decision Continental Casualty Company v. Employers Insurance Company of Wausau, No. 03-601037, 2007 N.Y. Slip. Op. 27188 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. May 8, 2007). In this class action suit of over 20,000 plaintiffs, CNA sought a declaratory judgment to classify the asbestos claims so as to implicate the aggregate coverage limits of the policy for a particular asbestos insulation defendant. The policies contained two basic types of coverage for asbestos claims: \"premises/operations\" coverage and \"products hazard/completed operations\" hazard coverage. The Court held that the recoveries were not limited by the aggregate limits in effect under the \"products hazard/completed operations\" section of the policy because the claims that arose out of exposure to asbestos during the insured's asbestos installation process are \"premises/operations\" claims (which are not subject to aggregate limits). Thus, the individual underlying asbestos actions had to await adjudication to see whether any fell under the products hazard/completed operations aggregates. The resulting exposure to the insurer could be infinite. Just when you think you're out, they keep pulling you back in.\n\nEditors Note: Thanks to our associate, V. Christopher Potenza for his summary. Chris handles a substantial volume of asbestos defense work. For Soprano’s fans, this Christopher is alive and well, was not in a car accident with Tony and has nothing to do with Adriana’s demise. He has, however, been followed by an orange cat, which makes us strangely suspicious\n\nSTarosieleC’S serious (Injury) Side of New York No-FaulT\n\nMark Starosielec\n\n[email protected]\n\n6/12/07 Britt v. Goodspeed Transit, Inc.\n\nAppellate Division, First Department\n\nThree Years of Post-Accident Reduced Range of Motion is Enough for Plaintiff to Survive Summary Judgment\n\nIn a brief opinion, the Appellate Division affirmed the lower court order which dismissed defendants’ motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint. Here, plaintiff’s physician’s affirmation as to a continuing 30% reduction in range of motion in lumbar extension, as well as significant left shoulder residual limitations, raise issues of fact on whether he suffered a “serious injury.” These findings, made during a physical examination three years after the accident, were compared with this doctor’s findings during his examination of plaintiff the day after the accident.\n\n6/12/07 Gordover v. Balandina\n\nAppellate Division, Second Department\n\nPlaintiff’s Raising Triable Issue of Fact Saves the Complaint from Certain Dismissal\n\nDenial of summary judgment is affirmed by Appellate Division. The defendants through the submission of the plaintiff’s verified bill of particulars and the affirmed medical reports of their examining neurologist, examining orthopedic surgeon, and radiologist, made a prima facie showing that the plaintiff did not sustain a serious injury within the meaning of Insurance Law § 5102(d) as a result of the subject motor vehicle accident. While the Court did not elaborate as to how, the plaintiff did raise a triable issue of fact in opposition.\n\n6/12/07 Jamison v. Garcia\n\nAppellate Division, Second Department\n\nHow Plaintiff Lost Her Fetus is a Triable Issue of Fact\n\nHere, the defendants appeal a lower court order which denied their motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint on the ground that the plaintiff did not sustain a serious injury within the meaning of Insurance Law § 5102(d). The Court held the defendants established their prima facie showing. However, the plaintiff raised a triable issue of fact as to whether she lost her fetus due to this accident rather than as a result of a voluntary termination of pregnancy.\n\n6/12/07 Perrotta v. Bambury\n\nAppellate Division, Second Department\n\nFailure to Make A Prima Facie Showing Dooms Defendant’s Summary Judgment Chances\n\nPlaintiffs survive summary judgment in serious injury case after defendants lose their appeal of lower court order. The papers submitted in support of the defendants’ motion for summary judgment failed to make a prima facie showing that the plaintiff did not sustain a serious injury\n\n6/12/07 Tobias v. Chupenko\n\nAppellate Division, Second Department\n\nReversal of Fortune: Defendants’ Summary Judgment is Granted on Appeal\n\nHere, the Appellate Division held the defendants met their prima facie burden on their motion of establishing that the plaintiff did not sustain a serious injury within the meaning of Insurance Law § 5102(d) as a result of the subject accident. In opposition, the plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of fact. The plaintiff’s examining physician failed to quantify, on the basis of objective testing, the limitations which he found in the plaintiff's lumbar spine. Moreover, while the affirmation of the plaintiff’s examining physician set forth range of motion findings with respect to the plaintiff's left shoulder, right wrist, and left knee, it failed to compare those findings to the normal range of motion.\n\n6/8/07 La Forte v Tiedemann\n\nAppellate Division, Fourth Department\n\nMotions, Admissions and Physicians. . .Oh My! Plaintiff’s Verdict is Affirmed\n\nPlaintiffs commenced this action to recover damages for injuries sustained in a rear-ended motor vehicle accident. Supreme Court properly granted plaintiffs’ pretrial motion seeking partial summary judgment determining that plaintiff sustained a serious injury within the meaning of Insurance Law § 5102 (d).Defendant stipulated that he was negligent and thus the trial was limited to the issue of damages. The Appellate Division held the lower court properly refused to preclude plaintiffs from testifying concerning plaintiff’s use of antidepressant medications. Although defendant sought to preclude the testimony on the ground that it varied from plaintiffs’ bill of particulars, the testimony was properly admitted because it neither misled nor prejudiced defendant. The court also properly allowed plaintiff’s treating orthopedic surgeon to testify that he had relied on the reports of nontestifying physicians, inasmuch as “those out-of-court materials are of the kind generally accepted as reliable by experts in the medical profession.”\n\n6/8/07 Carrier v. Shaw\n\nAppellate Division, Fourth Department\n\nUpon Further Review. . .The Lawsuit Stands\n\nHere, plaintiff in a rear end motor vehicle accident case appealed lower court order, which granted defendant’s motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint. On appeal, the plaintiff’s complaint was reinstated with respect to the following categories: (1) permanent consequential limitation of use of a body organ or member and (2) significant limitation of use of a body function or system. Although defendant met her initial burden, plaintiff raised issues of fact by submitting competent and objective medical evidence with respect to the nature and extent of her injuries. The affidavits of plaintiff’s treating physicians include findings based on their examinations of plaintiff as well as her x-rays and abnormal ENG findings. Submissions of plaintiff in opposition to defendant’s motion did not consist solely of her subjective complaints or her physicians’ conclusory and speculative statements, which would have been insufficient to defeat defendant's motion.\n\n6/5/07 Cotto v. JND Concrete & Brick, Inc.\n\nAppellate Division, Second Department\n\nUnsworn Medical Reports = Unreliable Medical Reports\n\nHere, defendants appeal lower court order which denied their motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint on the ground that the plaintiff did not sustain a serious injury within the meaning of Insurance Law § 5102(d). The Appellate Division modified the order by deleting the provision dismissing summary judgment but allowed for lawsuit continue on the property damage claim. The defendants satisfied their prima facie burden of showing that the plaintiff did not sustain a serious injury. In opposition, the plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of fact. The plaintiff’s evidence was comprised of unsworn medical reports and the affirmation of the plaintiff’s physician. Further, the range of motion findings was not based on a recent examination of the plaintiff.\n\n6/5/07 Figueroa v. Dalmar Car Service Corp.\n\nAppellate Division, Second Department\n\nDefendant’s Failure to Address Plaintiff’s Claims in the Bill of Particulars Leads to Summary Judgment Denial\n\nHere, the Appellate Division affirmed a lower court order which denied defendants’ summary judgment motion. The court held the defendants failed to make a prima facie showing that the plaintiff did not sustain a serious injury within the meaning of Insurance Law § 5102(d). The defendants’ moving papers did not address the allegations made by the plaintiff, as contained in her bill of particulars which was submitted in support of the motion. Since the defendants failed to establish their prima facie entitlement to judgment as a matter of law, it is unnecessary to reach the question of whether the injured plaintiff’s opposition papers were sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact.\n\n6/5/07 Garcia v Solbes\n\nAppellate Division, Second Department\n\nLimitations in ROM is Not Enough: It Must Be Contemporaneous with the Accident\n\nOn appeal, the Appellate Division reversed a lower court order which had denied defendant’s motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint on the ground that the plaintiff did not sustain a serious injury within the meaning of Insurance Law § 5102(d).\n\nThe defendant met his prima facie burden that the plaintiff did not sustain a serious injury. In opposition, the plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of fact. While the affidavit and medical report of the plaintiff’s examining orthopedist noted limitations in the plaintiff’s range of motion of her cervical spine, the plaintiff failed to provide any admissible medical proof that was contemporaneous with the subject accident which showed range of motion limitations in her spine. The MRI of plaintiff’s cervical and lumbar spine, which showed multiple bulging and herniated discs did not, alone, establish a serious injury. The mere existence of those conditions is not evidence of a serious injury in the absence of objective evidence of the extent of the alleged physical limitations resulting from the injuries and their duration.\n\n6/5/07 Gordon-Silvera v Long Is. R.R.\n\nAppellate Division, Second Department\n\nPlaintiff’s Complaint on SI grounds is dismissed For Failing to Address Defendant’s Doctor’s Findings\n\nHere plaintiff appeals an order granting summary judgment for defendants. The Appellate Division held the defendants made a prima facie showing that the plaintiff did not sustain a serious injury within the meaning of Insurance Law § 5102(d). In opposition, the plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of fact. The affirmation and affidavit of the plaintiff’s experts failed to address the findings of degeneration in her spine as noted in the affirmed medical report of the defendant’s examining radiologist, rendering speculative the conclusion that the injuries to her spine were caused by the subject accident. Further, MRI of the plaintiff’s cervical and lumbar spine which showed bulging discs and a herniation are not, in themselves, evidence of a serious injury.\n\n6/5/07 Laguerre v Chavarria\n\nAppellate Division, Second Department\n\nFailing to Put Plaintiff’s Chiropractor’s Report in an Affidavit Leads to Lawsuit Dismissal\n\nAppellate Division reversed lower court order which had denied defendant’s summary judgment motion. Here, defendants made a prima facie showing. In reply , the plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of fact. The report of the plaintiff’s treating chiropractor was not in affidavit form, and therefore was without probative value. The remaining medical submissions were without probative value since they were neither sworn nor affirmed nor certified.\n\n6/5/07 Lee v Troia\n\nAppellate Division, Second Department\n\nSummary Judgment Denial\n\nPlaintiff’s doctor’s failure to address findings led the Appellate Division to affirm a lower court order which granted defendant’s motion for summary judgment. After ruling the defendant made a prima facie showing, the plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of fact in opposition. The affirmation of plaintiff’s treating physician and the affirmed report of his examining doctor failed to address the findings of degeneration in his spine as noted in the affirmed medical report of the defendant’s radiologist, rendering speculative the findings that the injuries to plaintiff’s spine were caused by the subject accident.\n\n6/5/07 Nannarone v. Ott\n\nAppellate Division, Second Department\n\nExistence of Knee Injury Not Enough: Need Objective Proof Too to Raise Issue of Fact\n\nAppellate Division affirmed lower court order granting summary judgment. The defendant made a prima facie showing but the plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of fact. The plaintiff failed to proffer competent medical evidence that was contemporaneous with the subject accident which showed any range of motion limitations in her right knee. MRI of plaintiff’s right knee which showed, a meniscal tear did not, alone, establish a serious injury. The mere existence of such an injury is not evidence of a serious injury absent objective evidence of the alleged physical limitations resulting from the injury and its duration. The plaintiff’s self-serving affidavit was insufficient to meet that requirement.\n\n6/5/07 O’Neal v. Bronopolsky\n\nAppellate Division, Second Department\n\nDefendant in Denial (on a SJ motion) for Ignoring Plaintiff’s Alleged Injuries\n\nIn a brief opinion, defendant’s failure to come close to reaching its burden on a summary judgment motion led to the Appellate Division’s affirming the lower court order for the plaintiff. Defendant failed to establish, prima facie, that the plaintiff did not sustain a serious injury within the meaning of Insurance Law § 5102(d). Here, the defendant failed to even address, much less satisfy, his burden with respect to the plaintiff’s allegation that he suffered a knee injury as a result of the accident. Since the defendant failed to establish his prima facie showing, it is unnecessary to reach the question of whether the plaintiff’s papers were sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact.\n\n6/5/07 Park v. Herreros\n\nAppellate Division, Second Department\n\nNo Beating Around the Bush: Summary Judgment Granted!\n\nIn an opinion that gets straight to the point, the lower court’s order granting defendants’ motion for summary judgment, is affirmed. The Appellate Division held: “The defendants made a prima facie showing that the plaintiff did not sustain a serious injury within the meaning of Insurance Law § 5102(d). In opposition, the plaintiff failed to raise a triable issue of fact.”\n\n6/5/07 Paz v Wydrzynski\n\nAppellate Division, Second Department\n\nMinding the Gap (In Treatment) Leads to Plaintiff’s Surviving Summary Judgment\n\nPlaintiff’s maxing out his recovery at the chiropractor’s office led the Appellate Division to reverse lower court’s order granting defendants’ motion for summary judgment. The Court held any further treatment would be merely palliative and this sufficiently explains the gap in his treatment. Here, defendants established their prima facie burdens that the plaintiff did not sustain a serious injury. However, contrary to the conclusion of the lower court, the plaintiff raised triable issues of fact by submitting the affirmed MRI report of a radiologist stating that plaintiff had sustained herniated cervical discs. He also submitted the affidavit of his chiropractor stating that he had significant limitations in range of motion of the cervical spine. Although the plaintiff was still in significant pain, he was discharged by his chiropractor because he had reached his maximum recovery.\n\n6/5/07 Wade v Allied Bldg. Prods. Corp.\n\nAppellate Division, Second Department\n\nSee below.\n\n6/5/07 Zamaniyan v Vrabeck\n\nAppellate Division, Second Department\n\nDefendants’ Doctor’s Findings of Limitations Leads to Denial of Summary Judgment\n\nIn two very similarly worded decisions with similar fact patterns, the Appellate Division reversed lower court orders granting summary judgment. In both instances, the Court held that contrary to the lower court’s determinations, the defendants, in their motions for summary judgment, failed to meet their respective prima facie burdens. The defendants’ examining doctors found limitations when examining the plaintiff. Since the defendants failed to establish, prima facie, their entitlement to judgment in the first instance, it is unnecessary to reach the question of whether the plaintiff’s papers were sufficient to raise a triable issue of fact.\n\nAudrey’s Angle on No-Fault\n\nAudrey Seeley\n\n[email protected]\n\nThe reporting of No-Fault arbitration awards is not at the same level of reported case law, meaning there is no one source to turn to for comprehensive research of arbitration awards. We encourage you to submit to us, in a PDF format, at [email protected], any recent no-fault arbitration awards, especially Master Arbitration awards, that address interesting no-fault issues.\n\nArbitration\n\n6/11/07 In the Matter of the Arbitration of the Applicant and the Respondent\n\nArbitrator Thomas J. McCorry, Erie County\n\nConservative Care 14 Years Post Accident not Medically Necessary – You Think?\n\nThe Angle: While there is no timeframe under the no-fault system placed on medical treatment the treatment must be related to the motor vehicle accident and medically necessary (meaning it is benefiting the EIP). But conservative treatment 14 years after the accident??? Here, conservative treatment 14 years post accident was not medically necessary based upon the treating surgeon’s medical records and the IME physician’s report.\n\nThe Analysis: The issue in this arbitration was whether medical treatment rendered to the Applicant, eligible injured person (“EIP”), 14 years post accident was medically necessary. Arbitrator McCorry aptly found it was not.\n\nThe EIP was involved in an October 30, 1992, motor vehicle accident wherein she allegedly sustained injury in the form of a “little soreness” to her “back region.”\n\nOn April 24, 2006, the EIP underwent an independent medical examination with Dr. John O’Donnell. Dr. O’Donnell diagnosed the EIP with chronic and mild to moderate intermittent cervical pain. He opined that the EIP’s current symptoms had an unclear relationship to the accident 14 years prior. The current symptoms were flushed out in a series of addendums in the form of distress. It is not clear if the distress is physical or mental. Dr. O’Donnell recommended that the EIP begin an active exercise program to decrease exacerbation of her distress and did not recommend orthopedic surgery. Dr. O’Donnell also opined that the EIP was close to her pre-accident condition and that no further orthopedic treatment was necessary.\n\nThe EIP’s treating surgeon, Dr. William Capicotto, also agreed that the EIP has reached “maximum improvement” and that the EIP made life style changes that assisted the EIP in avoiding surgery.\n\nArbitrator McCorry, while admittedly sympathetic to the EIP’s situation could not award in her favor based upon the lack of medical documentation supporting continued conservative treatment.\n\n6/7/07 In the Matter of the Arbitration of the Applicant and the Respondent\n\nArbitrator Mary Anne Theiss, Onondaga County\n\nCertified Physical Therapist can Conduct Electromyography and Nerve Conduction Testing.\n\nThe Angle: This is the second decision from Arbitrator Theiss where a physical therapist has been reimbursed for conducting electrodiagnostic testing. The New York State Education Department permit certified physical therapists to perform the testing. In addition the Workers’ Compensation Board specifically addresses physical therapists conducting electrodiagnostic testing. We strongly recommend that insurers request verification in the form of the physical therapist’s certification to ensure that reimbursement is proper.\n\nThe Analysis: The Applicant, physical therapist, performed electromyography and nerve conduction testing on the eligible injured person (“EIP”) at the request of the EIP’s treating physician. The physical therapist and treating physician were not affiliated.\n\nThe Applicant testified at the arbitration that he was certified to perform electrodiagnostic testing. Further, the Education Law permits physical therapists to conduct this testing without physician supervision. The Applicant further testified that the EIP’s treating physician requested the testing to ascertain the EIP’s bilateral hand paresthesia were attributed to a lesion in the cervical region or in the upper extremities. The electrodiagnostic testing assisted in clarifying the EIP’s source of the symptoms as well as guided the future course of treatment.\n\nThe insurer denied reimbursement for the testing based upon a peer review conducted by a board certified neurologist, Dr. Topper. Dr. Topper opined that electrodiagnostic testing should be performed by a physician. Dr. Topper also concluded that the testing was planned, initiated, and performed by the Applicant without any physician supervision. Arbitrator Theiss found this conclusion to be incorrect based upon the Applicant’s testimony. Dr. Topper further opined that treatment was not useful as it did not alter the EIP’s treatment. Therefore, the electrodiagnostic testing was not medically necessary.\n\nArbitrator Theiss found the Applicant’s live testimony more persuasive and found in favor of the Applicant.\n\nLitigation\n\nPlaintiff’s Affidavit Fails to Establish Documents are Business Records Resulting in Denial of Summary Judgment.\n\nThe number of these cases have substantially decreased but here are two case cites where the court denied the plaintiff’s summary judgment motion due to insufficient affidavits. The plaintiff’s billing manager or corporate officer failed to establish that there was personal knowledge of the plaintiff’s practices and procedures for billing and mailing bills to insurers.

New York Cent. Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 2007 NYSlipOp 51175(U) (2d Dept., App. Term)\n\nPlaintiff can Rely Upon Defendant’s Documents to Establish Prima Facie Case but Make an Effort to Establish an Admissible Business Record.\n\nThe insurer moved for summary judgment on the basis that the Plaintiff’s assignee failed to appear for scheduled independent medical examinations (“IME”). The insurer’s proof consisted of copies of the claim forms, the NF-10, and the letters scheduling the IMEs. The plaintiff cross-moved for summary judgment on the basis that the medical bills were submitted, remained unpaid, and were not timely denied. The plaintiff’s proof consisted of an affirmation from plaintiff’s counsel as well as an affidavit from Boris Zigmond, D.C. the “principal doctor” of plaintiff. The affidavit attested that Mr. Zigmond was informed the NF-10 and claim forms were attached to the insurer’s motion papers.\n\nThe appellate term held that Mr. Zigmond’s affidavit without the attachment of any documents or foundation for admission of the documents attached to the insurer’s motion papers as business records was insufficient to demonstrate a prima facie case entitlement to summary judgment.\n\nFurther, the appellate term held that the insurer’s papers were insufficient as they failed to demonstrate that the IME notices were mailed and that the assignor failed to appear for the scheduled examinations.\n\nWe know it is easy for the plaintiff to establish a prima facie case but it’s not that easy. In short, if the plaintiff is going to rely upon the defendant’s documents it has to at least establish that they are admissible as business records.\n\n6/7/07 Boston Post Road Med. Imaging, P.C. a/a/o Adrian Black v. Progressive Ins. Co.,\n\n2007 NYSlipOp 51173(U) (2d Dept. App. Term)\n\nInsurer’s Evidence Insufficient to Establish Lack of Standing and Eligibility for No-Fault Benefits.\n\nThe insurer moved for summary judgment on the basis that the plaintiff was ineligible for no-fault benefit reimbursement as it was not a licensed health care provider under Business Corporation Law §§1503(b) and 1507 and that the plaintiff lacked standing as it sold its rights to collect the bills at issue.\n\nThe insurer’s evidence as to the standing issue was held to be insufficient. The insurer offered an unverified complaint with annexed exhibits filed by plaintiff in a Supreme Court action wherein the plaintiff alleged that it entered into a contract to sell accounts receivable. In addition, the insurer submitted an affidavit from that Supreme Court action attesting that the plaintiff agreed to sell the accounts receivable. Sounds pretty good huh, (notwithstanding the unverified complaint)? Well the court held that those documents are not dispositive on this action as they are informal judicial admissions which are “evidence of a fact or facts admitted…the circumstances of which may be explained at trial.” DRAT!\n\nTo make matters worse, the court also held that the insurer failed to demonstrate that the plaintiff is ineligible for reimbursement of no-fault benefits. The insurer’s attachment of an unsigned transcript from the plaintiff’s principal at an examination under oath regarding a claim made by a different medical corporation owned by the principal was not sufficient to demonstrate that the plaintiff is owned or controlled by an entity other than a licensed medical professional. Likewise, even though the insurer claimed that the plaintiff was channeling most of its profits to a management company as well as companies that it leases it premises and medical equipment there were insufficient facts to establish the extent of plaintiff’s profits being shared. Therefore, the insurer’s motion was denied.\n\nPEIPER on PROPERTY\n\nSteven E.

Medical Inter-Insurance Exchange\n\nConnecticut Court of Appeals\n\nInsurance Company Must Defend and Indemnify Physicians in Medical Malpractice Claim When the Claim was Filed During an Extended Reporting Period Under the Terms of the Parties’ Insurance Policies.\n\nThe physicians held professional liability insurance claims-made policies with the defendant. The policies included additional terms providing that in the event of termination, the insured would have an automatic extended reporting period of thirty days in which claims otherwise covered by the policy could be reported if not covered by another insurance carrier. The underlying medical malpractice suit was reported two weeks into the termination period and the defendant denied coverage. The court held that under a claims-made policy, any reported claim automatically triggers coverage under either the policy period or an extended reporting period, according to Connecticut statutory definitions of a “claims-made policy.”\n\nSubmitted by: Kate Bockman & Patrick Scarlett on behalf of Monty Todd\n\n6/13/2007 Erie Insurance Exchange v.

The insured must prove his underlying tort claim (that the uninsured motorist was at fault) in order to recover on the breach of contract claim. Therefore, the court relies on the theory of lex loci delicti and requires that the insured resolve the tort aspects of his case under the substantive law of the state where the accident occurred.\n\nSubmitted by: Kate Bockman & Patrick Scarlett on behalf of Monty Todd\n\n6/13/2007 TH Agriculture & Nutrition, LLC v. Ace European Group, Ltd.\n\nTenth Circuit Court of Appeals\n\nNo Personal Jurisdiction over European Insurance Companies\n\nPlaintiff, the successor in interest to an asbestos distributor, brought suit against its insurance carriers, thirteen European companies that insured plaintiff under general liability policies, in the District Court for the District of Kansas. Plaintiff brought the action seeking damages for breach of contract and a declaratory judgment that the insurers are obligated to indemnify plaintiff for losses resulting from the thousands of asbestos claims filed against plaintiff nationwide and to pay the costs of defending against these claims. The court affirmed the district court’s dismissal of the action for lack of personal jurisdiction. Although the insurers had established minimum contacts with Kansas when it reached out to the forum state by including it within the policies’ worldwide territory-of-coverage clause, the court held that personal jurisdiction over the insurers did not comport with \"traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\" Jurisdiction over the insurers did not satisfy the Burger King factors because the insurance contracts stated that they would be governed by Dutch law, and thus exercising jurisdiction in Kansas would be inefficient and would interfere with Dutch sovereignty.\n\nSubmitted by: Kate Bockman & Patrick Scarlett on behalf of Monty Todd\n\n6/12/2007 Certain Underwriters at Lloyds v.

Sirius America Insurance Company\n\nSimon & Gilman, LLP (Bertram Herman, P.C., Mount Kisco,\n\nN.Y., of counsel), for appellants.\n\nWhite, Quinlan & Staley, LLP, Garden City, N.Y. (Regis E.\n\nStaley, Jr., of counsel), for\n\nrespondent.\n\nDECISION & ORDER\n\nIn a \"proceeding\" for a judgment declaring that Sirius America Insurance Company is obligated to defend and indemnify Temple Construction Corp. and Bokharian Jewish Community Center, Inc., in an action entitled Ramos v Havurat Yisrael, pending in the Supreme Court, Kings County, under Index No. 27395/04, the appeal is from an order of the Supreme Court, Kings County (Ruchelsman, J.), dated June 16, 2006, which granted the motion of Sirius America Insurance Company to dismiss the petition.\n\nORDERED that the proceeding is converted into an action for a declaratory judgment, and the notice of petition and petition are deemed to be a summons and complaint (see CPLR 103[c]); and it is further,\n\nORDERED that the order is modified, on the law, by deleting the provision thereof granting that branch of the motion of Sirius America Insurance Company which was to dismiss the cause of action asserted by Bokharian Jewish Community Center, Inc., for a declaration that Sirius America Insurance Company is obligated to defend and indemnify Bokharian Jewish Community Center, Inc., in the underlying action, and substituting therefor a provision denying that branch of the motion; as so modified, the order is affirmed, and the cause of action asserted by Bokharian Jewish Community Center, Inc., for a declaration that Sirius America Insurance Company is obligated to defend and indemnify it in the underlying action is reinstated; and it is further,\n\nORDERED that the matter is remitted to the Supreme Court, Kings County, for the entry of an interlocutory judgment declaring that Sirius America Insurance Company is not obligated to defend and indemnify Temple Construction Corp. in the underlying action.\n\nIn July 2004, Jeffrey Ramos allegedly sustained injuries while working for Temple Construction Corp. (hereinafter Temple) on a construction project on the premises of Bokharian Jewish Community Center, Inc. (hereinafter Bokharian). Sirius America Insurance Company (hereinafter Sirius), which issued separate insurance policies covering Temple and Bokharian during the relevant time period, disclaimed coverage to both Temple and Bokharian based on the failure of each to timely notify it of the occurrence referenced in the underlying action. Temple and Bokharian then commenced this \"proceeding,\" seeking a declaration that Sirius must appear and defend them in the underlying personal injury action. The Supreme Court concluded that Temple and Bokharian failed to comply with the notice provisions of their respective policies, and granted Sirius's motion to dismiss the petition. Temple and Bokharian appeal.\n\nInitially, we convert this proceeding into a civil action for a judgment declaring that Sirius is obligated to defend and indemnify Temple and Bokharian in the underlying action and treat the notice of petition and petition as a summons and complaint (see CPLR 103[a]).\n\nGenerally, the requirement that an insured provide notice of any occurrence to the insurance company within a reasonable time is considered a condition precedent to the insurer's obligation to defend or indemnify the insured (see White v City of New York, 81 NY2d 955, 957; C.C.R. Realty of Dutchess v New York Cent. Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 1 AD3d 304, 304-305). Absent a showing of legal justification, the failure to comply with the notice condition vitiates coverage (see White v City of New York, supra; Rael Automatic Sprinkler Co., Inc. v Schaefer Agency, 32 AD3d 835).\n\nThe evidence presented by Sirius established that it was first given notice of the occurrence by Temple on or about December 22, 2004, when Temple forwarded the original summons and complaint in the underlying action, which named Temple as a defendant, to Sirius. The evidence further demonstrated that Sirius was first given notice of the occurrence by Bokharian on or about May 4, 2005, when Bokharian forwarded the amended summons and complaint in the underlying action, which named Bokharian as a defendant, to Sirius. An affidavit submitted with the petition demonstrated that both Temple and Bokharian were aware of the occurrence by July 26, 2004, the date of the incident, at the latest. Thus, Sirius established that Temple's 5-month delay, and Bokharian's 10-month delay, in notifying it of the occurrence, were unreasonable as a matter of law (see Paul Developers, LLC v Maryland Cas. Ins. Co., 28 AD3d 443, 445; Public Serv. Mut. Ins. Co. v Harlen Hous. Assoc., 7 AD3d 421, 422).\n\nTemple and Bokharian assert that notice of the occurrence was provided to Sirius the day after the accident by notice to a nonparty insurance broker, Northeastern Group, Ltd. (hereinafter Northeastern). \"In general, an insurance broker is considered the agent of the insured, not the insurance company, and notice to the broker is not deemed notice to the insurance company\" (MTO Assoc., Ltd. Partnership v Republic-Franklin Ins. Co., 21 AD3d 1008, 1008). However, \"a broker will be held to have acted as the insurer's agent where there is some evidence of action on the insurer's part, or facts from which a general authority to represent the insurer may be inferred'\" (Rendeiro v State-Wide Ins. Co., 8 AD3d 253, 253, quoting Bennion v Allstate Ins. Co., 284 AD2d 924, 925).\n\nThe evidence in the record failed to establish any basis for the claim that Northeastern was Sirius's agent. Northeastern was not listed as an agent — or otherwise — in the insurance policies issued to Temple and Bokharian. Nor was there evidence that any employee of Temple or Bokharian had any contact with Northeastern or its employees prior to the occurrence pertaining to the underlying action. Nor do Temple or Bokharian claim that they purchased their insurance policies from Northeastern. Temple and Bokharian failed to establish that Northeastern possessed any general authority to represent Sirius and accept notice of occurrence on its behalf (see Paul Developers, LLC v Maryland Cas. Ins. Co., supra; cf. Rendeiro v State-Wide Ins. Co., supra).\n\nTemple further contends that Sirius's delay in disclaiming from the time it was first notified of the occurrence until it sent Temple its disclaimer letter, dated December 30, 2004, was unreasonable as a matter of law. This contention is without merit, as Sirius did not receive notice of the occurrence from Temple until December 22, 2004, at the earliest. Thus, Sirius disclaimed as to Temple within a period of approximately eight days, which, as a matter of law, cannot be deemed unreasonable (see e.g. Steinberg v Hermitage Ins. Co., 26 AD3d 426, 427; State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v Daniels, 269 AD2d 860, 861).\n\nHowever, Sirius failed to establish, as a matter of law, that its 47-day delay in disclaiming to Bokharian from the time it was first notified of the occurrence by Bokharian on May 4, 2005, until it sent Bokharian its disclaimer letter, dated June 20, 2005, was reasonable. Although Sirius contended that the delay was warranted by its need to investigate the occurrence, the record is silent as to the date Sirius completed its investigation. Even though Bohkarian did not provide Sirius with timely notice of the occurrence, Sirius's failure to provide timely notice of its disclaimer to Bokharian would result in loss of its disclaimer's effectiveness (see Matter of Allstate Ins. Co. v Cruz, 30 AD3d 511, 512).\n\nIn view of the foregoing, and upon consideration of all of the evidence presented, the Supreme Court erred in granting that branch of Sirius's motion which was to dismiss the cause of action asserted by Bokharian for defense and indemnification in the underlying action (see Morris Park Contr. Corp. v National Union Fire Ins. Co. of Pittsburgh, Pa., 33 AD3d 763, 767).\n\nThe remaining contentions of Temple and Bokharian are without merit.\n\nWe note that since this is a declaratory judgment action, the court should not have dismissed the cause of action asserted by Temple, but should have entered an interlocutory judgment declaring that Sirius is not obligated to defend and indemnify Temple in the underlying action (see Lanza v Wagner, 11 NY2d 317, 334, appeal dismissed 371 US 74, cert denied 371 US 901).

While it is true that the construction subcontracts signed by third-party defendants incorporated the main agreement by reference, \"[u]nder New York law, incorporation clauses in a construction subcontract, incorporating prime contract clauses by reference into a subcontract, bind a subcontractor only as to prime contract provisions relating to the scope, quality, character and manner of the work to be performed by the subcontractor\" (Bussanich v 310 E. 55th St. Tenants, 282 AD2d 243 [2001]; see Goncalves v 515 Park Ave. Condominium, __ AD3d __, 2007 NY Slip Op. 02981 [2007]).\n\nDwyer v.

McCann of\n\ncounsel), for respondent-appellant.\n\nOrder, Supreme Court, New York County (Bernard J. Fried, J.), entered December 13, 2006, as amended by order, same court and Justice, entered February 16, 2007, which denied plaintiff's and defendants' motions for summary judgment, inter alia, unanimously modified, on the law, defendants' motion granted to the extent of rescinding the policy, the complaint otherwise dismissed, and otherwise affirmed, with costs in favor of defendants. The Clerk is directed to enter judgment accordingly.\n\nFor the insurer to be entitled to rescind the policy ab initio, after it had been in existence for two years during the insured's lifetime, it must identify a material misrepresentation in the application that was intended to defraud the insurer (Insurance Law § 3105[b], § 3216[d][1][B][I]; Interested Underwriters at Lloyd's v H.D.I. III Assoc., 213 AD2d 246, 247 [1995]; Process Plants Corp. v Beneficial Natl. Life Ins. Co., 53 AD2d 214, 216-217 [1976], affd 42 NY2d 928 [1977]). \"Ordinarily, the question of materiality of misrepresentation is a question of fact for the jury. However, where the evidence concerning the materiality is clear and substantially uncontradicted, the matter is one of law for the court to determine\" (id., 53 AD2d at 216). Here, defendants presented the affidavit of their chief underwriter, as well as the company guidelines, both of which establish that if defendants had known of plaintiff's history of chronic back pain, including his prescription medication for such pain and his hospitalization within five years prior to filling out the insurance application, they would not have issued the policy to plaintiff in its present form (Barrett v State Mut. Life Assur. Co., 58 AD2d 320, 323 [1977], affd 44 NY2d 872 [1978], cert denied 440 US 912 [1979]; Process Plants, 53 AD2d at 216-217).\n\nPlaintiff's intent to defraud defendants may also be determined as a matter of law where, as here, it is uncontested that he knew the answers he provided to the questions on the application were false, and he provided some partial answers, omitting only information that would actually have been relevant to a determination of his insurable risk (see Wageman v Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 24 AD2d 67, 71 [1965], affd 18 NY2d 777 [1966]). Nor was plaintiff entitled to rely on his broker to waive or omit any answer to the specific questions in the application (see id., 24 AD2d at 69; see also Simon v Government Empls. Life Ins. Co. of N.Y., 79 AD2d 705 [1980]).\n\nWe reject plaintiff's assertions that preexisting conditions, in place for more than two years, are not subject to the exception for fraudulent misrepresentations under the policy. While plaintiff has spent much of his argument noting other cases in which these defendants or other subsidiaries of UnumProvident were found to have acted in bad faith (see e.g. Radford Trust v First UNUM Life Ins. Co. of Am., 321 F Supp 2d 226 [D Mass 2004]; Hangarter v Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., 236 F Supp 2d 1069 [ND Cal 2002], affd in part & revd in part 373 F3d 998 [9th Cir 2004]), he has failed to come forward with admissible evidence demonstrating such bad faith at work here. Indeed, here, the evidence demonstrates a good faith basis for rescission of the policy.\n\nWe have examined plaintiff's remaining arguments and find them insufficient to raise a triable issue of material fact.\n\nSteadfast Insurance Company v.

Vetter of\n\ncounsel), for The Rubin Group, respondent.\n\nOrder, Supreme Court, New York County (Edward H. Lehner, J.), entered May 31, 2006, which, to the extent appealed from as limited by the briefs, denied plaintiff's cross motion for summary judgment seeking a declaration that it owes no duty to provide a defense or coverage in the underlying North Carolina wrongful death action, unanimously affirmed, with costs.\n\nThe state of California adheres to the \"Notice-Prejudice Rule\" under which \"a defense based on an insured's failure to give timely notice requires the insurer to prove that it suffered substantial prejudice. Prejudice is not presumed from delayed notice alone. The insurer must show actual prejudice, not the mere possibility of prejudice\" (Shell Oil Co. v Winterthur Swiss Ins. Co., 12 Cal App 4th 715, 760, 15 Cal Rptr 2d 815, 845 [1993] [citations omitted]; see also Northwestern Tit. Sec. Co. v Flack, 6 Cal App 3d 134, 141, 85 Cal Rptr 693, 696-697 [1970]; Insurance Co. of Pa. v Associated Intl. Ins. Co., 922 F2d 516, 524 [9th Cir 1991]).\n\nCalifornia law is imbued with a strong public policy against technical forfeitures in the insurance context (see Cal Civ Code § 3275; Insurance Co. of Pa., 922 F2d at 524; California Compensation & Fire Co. v Industrial Acc. Commn., 62 Cal 2d 532, 535, 399 P2d 381, 383 [1965]; O'Morrow v Borad, 27 Cal 2d 794, 800, 167 P2d 483, 487 [1946]), and California courts may refuse to enforce a provision in an insurance policy that violates public policy (see Pacific Empls. Ins. Co. v Superior Court, 221 Cal App 3d 1348, 1359, 270 Cal Rptr 779, 784-785 [1990]). Thus, for example, even where an insurance policy makes the notice provision a condition precedent to coverage, an insurer must nonetheless demonstrate prejudice to avoid liability based on the breach of notice requirement (see Insurance Co. of Pa., 922 F2d at 524; Hanover Ins. Co. v Carroll, 241 Cal App 2d 558, 565, 50 Cal Rptr 704, 708-709 [1966]).\n\nGiven these principles, the motion court correctly determined that under California law, a policy endorsement waiving the requirement that an insurer must demonstrate prejudice in order to disclaim for untimely notice, thereby waiving the Notice-Prejudice Rule, is void as against public policy (see Service Mgt. Sys. v Steadfast Ins. Co., 2007 US App LEXIS 272, 2007 WL 27114 [9th Cir]).\n\nBlake v. Ford Motor Company\n\nLieff, Cabraser, Heimann & Bernstein, LLP, New York\n\n(Wendy R.

In the absence of a fiduciary relationship between the van's owner and its insurer, the insurer was under no duty to warn the owner of the van's rollover risk (see McGarr v Guardian Life Ins. Co., 19 AD3d 254, 256 [2005]; Elghanian v Harvey, 249 AD2d 206 [1998]). We have considered plaintiffs' other contentions and find them unavailing.\n\nFortress Insurance Company v.

(Kelly\n\nCaputo of counsel), for respondent.\n\nDECISION & ORDER\n\nIn an action, in effect, for a judgment declaring that the plaintiff is not obligated to defend and indemnify the defendant in an underlying action entitled Eliades v Kollander, pending in the Supreme Court, Queens County, under Index No. 9620/05, the defendant appeals from (1) an order of the Supreme Court, Nassau County (Mahon, J.), dated September 25, 2006, which, in effect, denied his motion to compel the plaintiff to comply with certain discovery demands, and (2) an order of the same court entered November 2, 2006, which granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment declaring that the plaintiff is not obligated to defend and indemnify the defendant in the underlying action, and denied his cross motion for summary judgment declaring that the plaintiff is so obligated.\n\nORDERED that the orders are affirmed, with one bill of costs, and the matter is remitted to the Supreme Court, Nassau County, for the entry of a judgment declaring that the plaintiff is not obligated to defend or indemnify the defendant in the underlying action.\n\nAn insurer can be relieved of its duty to defend by establishing, as a matter of law, that there is no possible factual or legal basis upon which it might eventually be obligated to indemnify the insured (see First State Ins. Co. v J & S United Amusement Corp., 67 NY2d 1044, [*2]1046; Spoor-Lasher Co. v Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 39 NY2d 875, 876). The plaintiff, which issued a dental malpractice insurance policy to the defendant in which it essentially agreed to defend and indemnify him in any action brought against him to recover damages for \"bodily injury,\" established that the claims involved in the underlying action did not seek to recover such damages, and therefore, were not within the scope of the policy. Since, in response, the defendant failed to raise a triable issue of fact, the court correctly granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and denied the defendant's cross motion for summary judgment.\n\nThe defendant's remaining contention is without merit.\n\nSince this, in effect, is a declaratory judgment action, we remit the matter to the Supreme Court, Nassau County, for the entry of a judgment declaring that the plaintiff is not obligated to defend or indemnify the defendant in the underlying action (see Lanza v Wagner, 11 NY2d 317, 334).\n\nGZA GeoEnvironmental, Inc., New York State Liquidation Bureau\n\nWilson Elser Moskowitz Edelman & Dicker LLP, New York\n\n(Richard E.

Stallman, J.), entered November 2, 2006, which denied claimant's motion to confirm and granted the liquidator's cross motion to disaffirm the report of the special referee, and denied the claim, unanimously affirmed, without costs.\n\nThe liquidator was not required to pay the claim resulting from the settlement. Its denial of the claim on the ground the settlement violated the stay was rational and within its broad power to implement the legislative policy embodied in the statutory liquidation scheme (see generally Matter of New York Pub. Interest Research Group v New York State Dept. of Ins., 66 NY2d 444, 448 [1985]). Contrary to claimant's contention, the liquidator, acting in its governmental capacity, was not subject to estoppel for failure to respond to claimant's requests to consent to the proposed settlement (see Serio v Ardra Ins. Co., 304 AD2d 362 [2003], lv denied 100 NY2d 516 [2003]). In any event, there was no basis for estoppel (see Baje Realty v Cutler, 32 AD3d 307 [2006]).\n\nIn view of the foregoing, we need not reach the other grounds urged for affirmance. We have considered claimant's other contentions and find them unavailing.\n\nSerio v. United States Fire Insurance Company\n\nCarroll, McNulty & Kull, LLC, New York, N.Y.

Dachs of counsel), for\n\nrespondent.\n\nDECISION & ORDER\n\nIn an action for a judgment declaring that the plaintiff, Gregory V. Serio, Superintendent of Insurance of State of New York, as ancillary receiver of Credit General Insurance Company, is not obligated to defend and indemnify the defendant J.T. Magen & Co., Inc., in an underlying personal injury action entitled Feyjoo v D & G Land Company, LLC, pending in the Supreme Court, Queens County, under Index No. 4517/99, and that the defendants United States Fire Insurance Company and North River Insurance Company are obligated to defend and indemnify the defendant J.T. Magen & Co., Inc., in the underlying action, the defendants United States Fire Insurance Company, North River Insurance Company, and J.T. Magen & Co., Inc., appeal from (1) so much of an order and interlocutory judgment (one paper) of the Supreme Court, Queens County (Polizzi, J.), entered January 6, 2006, as denied their motion for summary judgment and, upon searching the record, awarded summary judgment in favor of the plaintiff and declared that the plaintiff has no duty to indemnify the defendant J.T. Magen & Co., Inc., in the underlying action, and that the general commercial insurance policy issued to J.T. Magen & Co., Inc., by the defendant United States Fire Insurance Company provides primary and not excess insurance, (2) an order of the same court entered August 2, 2006, which denied their motion for leave to renew, and (3) a judgment of the same court entered August 8, 2006, which is in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant United States Fire Insurance Company in the principal sum of $342,179.77.\n\nORDERED that the appeals by the defendants North River Insurance Company and J.T. Magen & Co., Inc., from the judgment entered August 8, 2006, are dismissed, as they are not aggrieved thereby (see CPLR 5511); and it is further,\n\nORDERED that the order and interlocutory judgment entered January 6, 2006, is reversed insofar as appealed from, on the law, the motion of the defendants United States Fire Insurance Company, North River Insurance Company, and J.T. Magen & Co., Inc., for summary judgment is granted, it is declared that the defendants United States Fire Insurance Company and North River Insurance Company are not obligated to indemnify the defendant J.T. Magen & Co., Inc., in the underlying action and that the general commercial insurance policy issued to J.T. Magen & Co., Inc., by United States Fire Insurance Company is excess to the general commercial insurance policy issued by Credit General Insurance Company, and the judgment entered August 8, 2006, is vacated; and it is further,\n\nORDERED that the appeals from the order entered August 2, 2006 and the judgment entered August 8, 2006, are dismissed as academic in light of our determination on the appeal from the order and interlocutory judgment entered January 6, 2006; and it is further,\n\nORDERED that one bill of costs is awarded to the appellants.\n\nThe plaintiff in this case is the Superintendent of Insurance of the State of New York (hereinafter the Superintendent), as ancillary receiver of Credit General Insurance Company (hereinafter Credit General). The Supreme Court erred in holding that the Superintendent was not estopped from disclaiming coverage of the defendant J.T. Magen & Co., Inc. (hereinafter Magen), in the underlying action. \"While the State Insurance Fund is an agency of the State, its function is akin to that of a private insurance carrier and, especially in matters of litigation, it is considered to be an entity separate from the State itself . . . It follows that in a proper case, laches and estoppel may be imputed to the fund\" (Matter of Carney v Newburgh Park Motors, 84 AD2d 599).\n\nHere, the appellants established that Credit General assumed the defense of Magen in the underlying action without reserving the right to deny coverage. The appellants also established that Magen was prejudiced by the Superintendent's disclaimer of such coverage which was issued after liability had been established in the underlying action and shortly before the damages trial. As such, the Superintendent is estopped from denying coverage (see Albert J. Schiff Assoc. v Flack, 51 NY2d 692; Utica Mut. Ins. Co. v 215 W. 91st St. Corp., 283 AD2d 421, 425; Brooklyn Hosp. Ctr. v Centennial Ins. Co., 258 AD2d 491, 492) and has a duty to indemnify Magen with respect to the underlying personal injury action.\n\nThe Supreme Court also erred in finding that the policy issued to Magen by the defendant United States Fire Insurance Company provided primary coverage. The appellants established that Magen was an additional insured under the policy issued by Credit General. Moreover, provisions of the subcontract between Magen and Credit General's insured established that Credit General's coverage was primary (see Pecker Iron Works of N.Y. v Travelers' Ins. Co., 99 NY2d 391).\n\nMeegan v. Progressive Insurance Company\n\nAppeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Erie County (Joseph R. Glownia, J.), entered November 7, 2005 in a personal injury action. The judgment, upon a jury verdict in favor of plaintiffs and against defendant, awarded plaintiffs the amount of $479,091.85.\n\nSUGARMAN LAW FIRM, LLP, SYRACUSE (TIMOTHY J. PERRY OF COUNSEL), FOR DEFENDANT-APPELLANT.\n\nKNOER, CRAWFORD & BENDER, LLP, BUFFALO (PAUL A. BENDER OF COUNSEL), FOR PLAINTIFFS-RESPONDENTS.\n\nIt is hereby ORDERED that the judgment so appealed from be and the same hereby is reversed on the law without costs, the cross motion for a directed verdict is denied in part, the posttrial motion is granted in part, the verdict is set aside, and a new trial is granted on the issues of serious injury and damages.\n\nOpinion by Peradotto, J.: Sheila M. Meegan (plaintiff) was injured in a motor vehicle accident when the vehicle that she was driving was rear-ended by another vehicle. She thereafter settled with the driver of the other vehicle for $25,000, the maximum amount of coverage under his insurance policy. Plaintiffs then commenced this action seeking supplementary uninsured/underinsured motorist (SUM) coverage under the policy issued by defendant to plaintiff Michael T. Meegan, plaintiff's husband. The case proceeded to trial, and Supreme Court granted plaintiffs' cross motion for a directed verdict on, inter alia, the issue whether plaintiff sustained a serious injury. The jury thereafter returned a verdict in plaintiffs' favor, and defendant moved for, inter alia, an order reducing the verdict \"to conform to the coverage for this claim\" or an order setting aside the verdict and granting a new trial on all issues. The court denied defendant's posttrial motion, and judgment was entered for plaintiffs in the amount of $479,091.85.\n\nFor the reasons that follow, we agree with defendant that a new trial should be granted on the issue whether plaintiff sustained a serious injury within the meaning of Insurance Law § 5102 (d) because the court erred in granting that part of plaintiffs' cross motion for a directed verdict on that issue. That issue involved questions of fact for the jury, and the court therefore erred in concluding that plaintiff's shoulder injury met the serious injury threshold as a matter of law. [*2]\n\nWe address first the judgment in appeal No. 2. Plaintiffs contend that they were not required to establish that plaintiff sustained a serious injury in the context of this case. That contention is inconsistent with their position at trial and is raised for the first time on appeal. Nevertheless, we address plaintiffs' contention in view of our conclusion that a new trial on the issue of serious injury should be granted. Plaintiffs' contention involves an issue of first impression in this Department and, although the Second Department addressed the issue in Raffellini v State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (36 AD3d 92), we disagree with its resolution of the issue.\n\nThe SUM endorsement to defendant's policy provides in relevant part that defendant agrees to \"pay all sums that the insured . . . shall be legally entitled to recover as damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured motor vehicle because of bodily injury sustained by the insured, caused by an accident . . . subject to the Exclusions, Conditions, Limits and other provisions of [the] SUM endorsement.\" Pursuant to an exclusion in the SUM endorsement, SUM coverage does not apply \"for non-economic loss[] resulting from bodily injury . . . unless the insured has sustained serious injury as defined in section 5102(d) of the New York Insurance Law.\" Thus, under the terms of the policy, plaintiffs were required to establish that plaintiff sustained a serious injury.\n\nIn Raffellini, the Second Department held that the provision in the insurance contract imposing a serious injury threshold requirement in the underinsurance context should not be given effect (see id. at 105). Pursuant to the reasoning of the Second Department, \"the Legislature made a point of imposing the serious injury threshold requirement in [Insurance Law § ] 3420 (f) (1), which governs mandatory, uninsured motorists coverage, . . . [but] omitted that threshold from the ensuing section, section 3420 (f) (2), which governs the optional coverage an insured may, for an additional premium, purchase from his or her insurer\" (id. at 103). Thus, reasoned the Second Department, the omission of the serious injury threshold requirement in section 3420 (f) (2) renders \"legally irrelevant\" a defense of lack of serious injury (id. at 103), and the regulations imposing such a requirement \"would appear unauthorized\" (id. at 104). The Court in Raffellini went on to note that Insurance Law § 3420 (a) provides for certain mandatory policy provisions that are to be \"equally or more favorable to the insured\" and that a provision in a contract imposing a serious injury threshold requirement is less favorable to an insured than section 3420 (f) (2) and thus should not be enforced (see id. at 105).\n\nWe disagree with the decision of the Second Department in Raffellini and conclude that plaintiffs were required to establish that plaintiff sustained a serious injury in order to recover under the policy. The language of the SUM endorsement in this case comes directly from the insurance regulations containing the requirements for SUM endorsements, which include the exclusion that SUM coverage does not apply to non-economic damages unless the insured has sustained a \"serious injury\" as defined in Insurance Law § 5102 (d) (see 11 NYCRR 60-2.3 [f]).\n\nIt is well established that \"[r]esponsibility for administering the Insurance Law rests with the Superintendent of Insurance . . ., who has broad power to interpret, clarify, and implement the legislative policy' \" (Matter of Medical Socy. of State of N.Y. v Serio, 100 NY2d 854, 863-864; see Insurance Law § 301). Pursuant to Insurance Law § 301, the Superintendent of Insurance has the power to promulgate regulations, and those regulations are valid as long as they are not inconsistent with a specific statutory provision (see Medical Socy. of State of N.Y., 100 NY2d at 864; see also State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Cos. v Brooks, 78 AD2d 456, 458, appeal dismissed 54 NY2d 753).\n\nIn our view, the regulations requiring a person to establish that he or she sustained a serious injury in order to be entitled to SUM coverage are not inconsistent with section 3420 (f) [*3](2) or any other provision of the Insurance Law. In the construction of a statute, the primary consideration for the court is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the Legislature (see McKinney's Cons Laws of NY, Book 1, Statutes § 92 [a]; Matter of Allstate Ins. Co. v Libow, 106 AD2d 110, 114, affd for the reasons stated 65 NY2d 807). Statutes are to \"be given a reasonable construction, it being presumed that a reasonable result was intended by the Legislature\" (§ 143).\n\nInsurance Law § 3420 (f) (2) does not explicitly dispense with the serious injury threshold requirement and, because \"the statute is silent [on the issue], the regulations [implementing the statute and imposing that requirement] in no way conflict with the statute\" (Medical Socy. of State of N.Y., 100 NY2d at 871). We further conclude that the regulations do not impose a requirement that is less favorable to the insured than section 3420 (f) (2). The regulations simply impose the same legal requirement that an injured plaintiff would have against an adequately insured driver and an uninsured driver (see § 3420 [f] [1]; § 5104). The regulations were not promulgated \"on a blank slate without any legislative guidance, nor did [they] effectuate a profound change in . . . policy\" (Medical Socy. of State of N.Y., 100 NY2d at 865). The obvious purpose of section 3420 (f) (2) and its corresponding regulations is to permit drivers to protect themselves under the same terms as they protect others injured as a result of their negligence. It was not the intent of the Legislature to provide a person injured by an underinsured driver with greater rights or a lesser burden of proof than an injured person otherwise would have against an adequately insured driver, when both actions arise from the same incident. To so conclude would be unreasonable and contrary to the purpose and intent of the no-fault law. We further note that SUM coverage is optional, and that an insured elects to obtain such coverage upon the specified terms and conditions of the coverage.\n\nIn sum, we conclude that, because the conditional and exclusionary language of the policy is not explicitly prohibited by the statute, and because the regulations implementing such policy provisions are authorized and not inconsistent with the language or purpose of Insurance Law § 3420 (f) (2) or any other provision of the Insurance Law, the policy provision containing the serious injury threshold requirement exclusion is valid and enforceable.\n\nWe further conclude that defendant is entitled to a new trial on damages. Contrary to the contentions of plaintiffs, absent evidence that defendant acted in bad faith, their underinsurance claim is limited to the amount of coverage provided in the policy, which is $250,000, less an offset of $25,000 for the payment made on behalf of the other driver (see Mendoza v Allstate Ins. Co., 13 AD3d 594, 595). We also add that plaintiff's recovery of past and future medical expenses and lost wages may be limited by exclusions, conditions, limits, or other provisions of the policy. Defendant's remaining contentions with respect to the judgment in appeal No. 2 are moot in light of our determination.\n\nWe conclude with respect to the order in appeal No. 1 that the court abused its discretion in granting plaintiffs' motion in limine in part by precluding an expert for defendant from testifying with respect to an entry in the medical records of one of plaintiff's physicians. In support of their motion, plaintiffs submitted an affidavit of that physician's office manager in which she stated that plaintiff did not become a patient of the physician until approximately one month after the date of the entry. In her affidavit, however, the office manager did not establish that she had personal knowledge of the entry, nor did she establish that she was responsible for making such entries. Even if she had made such a showing, the certified medical records were admissible in evidence pursuant to CPLR 4518 (c) and constituted prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein (see generally LaDuke v State Farm Ins. Co., 158 AD2d 137). Plaintiffs' contention with respect to the accuracy of the entry in those medical records goes to the weight to be given to the medical records, not their admissibility (see generally National Fuel Gas Supply [*4]Corp. v Goodremote, 13 AD3d 1134, 1135).\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that the judgment in appeal No. 2 should be reversed, plaintiffs' cross motion for a directed verdict denied in part, defendant's posttrial motion granted in part, the verdict set aside and a new trial granted on the issues of serious injury and damages. We further conclude that the order in appeal No. 1 should be reversed insofar as appealed from and plaintiffs' motion in limine denied in its entirety.\n\nLunn and Pine, JJ., concur with Peradotto, J.; Centra, J., dissents in part and votes to modify in accordance with the following Opinion in which Gorski, J.P., concurs.\n\nI\n\nFor the reasons that follow, we respectfully dissent in appeal No. 1 and dissent in part in appeal No. 2 because, in our view, defendant is not entitled to a new trial on the issues of serious injury and damages. With respect to appeal No. 2, we agree with the majority that plaintiffs' underinsurance claim is limited to $225,000, and we therefore would modify the judgment in appeal No. 2 accordingly.\n\nII\n\nSheila M. Meegan (plaintiff) sustained injuries in a motor vehicle accident when the vehicle she was driving was rear-ended by a vehicle driven by Kevin T. Berry. Plaintiff settled with Berry's insurance company for $25,000, the maximum amount of coverage under Berry's policy. Plaintiffs thereafter commenced this action seeking supplementary uninsured/underinsured motorists (SUM) coverage from defendant, who issued a policy to plaintiff Michael T. Meegan, plaintiff's husband. Supreme Court granted plaintiffs' motion in limine in part and precluded certain testimony of defendant's expert (appeal No. 1). The action proceeded to trial, and a jury awarded plaintiff $26,250 for past lost wages, approximately $21,500 for past medical expenses, $100,000 for past pain and suffering, $50,000 for future lost wages, $65,000 for future medical expenses, and $200,000 for future pain and suffering. The jury also awarded Michael Meegan $15,000 on his derivative claim. The court granted judgment on the verdict (appeal No. 2) and denied defendant's posttrial motion for an order reducing the verdict, vacating the award for past lost wages and medical expenses, or setting aside the verdict and granting a new trial on all issues. Defendant now appeals.\n\nIII\n\nAs did the majority, we will first address the issue of serious injury. The majority concludes that the court erred in granting that part of plaintiffs' cross motion for a directed verdict on the issue of serious injury and that defendant therefore is entitled to a new trial on that issue. The majority further rejects the contention of plaintiffs that they are not required to establish that plaintiff sustained a serious injury. We agree with the decision of the Second Department in Raffellini v State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. (36 AD3d 92) and conclude that plaintiffs are not required to establish that plaintiff sustained a serious injury.\n\nTo begin, we note that there is no statutory requirement that a plaintiff who asserts a breach of contract claim for SUM benefits must establish that he or she sustained a serious injury. Insurance Law § 5104 (a) provides that, \"in any action by or on behalf of a covered person against another covered person for personal injuries arising out of negligence in the use or operation of a motor vehicle in this state, there shall be no right of recovery for non-economic [*5]loss, except in the case of serious injury, or for basic economic loss.\" That statute is not applicable to the facts of this case because, although plaintiff is a \"covered person,\" defendant is not. Plaintiffs' claim for SUM benefits is governed by Insurance Law § 3420 (f) (2) (A), which provides that a policy of insurance shall, at the option of the insured, provide SUM insurance for bodily injury. That section does not require a plaintiff asserting a breach of contract claim for SUM benefits to establish that he or she sustained a serious injury. Unlike section 3420 (f) (2) (A), however, Insurance Law § 3420 (f) (1) requires a plaintiff seeking uninsured motorist (UM) benefits to establish that he or she sustained a serious injury.\n\nThere is therefore no statutory provision to support defendant's contention that plaintiffs must establish that plaintiff sustained a serious injury. Instead, defendant relies on the insurance policy, which provides that there is no SUM coverage \"for non-economic loss[] resulting from bodily injury . . . unless the insured has sustained serious injury as defined in section 5102(d) of the New York Insurance Law.\" That provision is set forth in the insurance regulations containing the requirements for SUM endorsements (see 11 NYCRR 60-2.3 [f])[FN1]. The majority concludes that those regulations are not inconsistent with section 3420 (f) (2) and should therefore be upheld. We disagree with that conclusion.\n\nAs the majority notes, the Superintendent of Insurance (Superintendent) \"has broad power to interpret, clarify, and implement the legislative policy' \" (Matter of Medical Socy. of State of N.Y. v Serio, 100 NY2d 854, 863-864).
