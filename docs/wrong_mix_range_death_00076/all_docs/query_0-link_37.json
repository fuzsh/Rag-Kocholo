        "text": "The USNA Virtual Memorial Hall exists to perpetuate the memory of alumni of the United States Naval Academy who have died in service to their country. As President Lincoln said in his Gettysburg Address, \"It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion.\"\n\nThis site demands input from friends, family, classmates, and shipmates of the fallen. No team of historians could possibly provide the nuanced understanding of who these men and women were. Stories and anecdotes, no matter how trivial, will help us learn. Please contribute your memories! Create an account or email Patrick McConnell '02. Dozens of classmates, family, and friends have emailed to make additions and corrections, large and small.\n\nThe Virtual Memorial Hall project was created and is maintained by Run To Honor, a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization founded in 2007. The mission of Run To Honor is to preserve and perpetuate the legacy of Naval Academy Alumni lost in service to our Nation during combat or military operations. Run To Honor does this by connecting Gold Star families, classmates, and friends; memorializing our fallen brothers and sisters in Virtual Memorial Hall; and organizing memorial and athletic events. This site is not affiliated with or endorsed by the United States Department of Defense, the United States Navy, or the United States Naval Academy.\n\nVirtual Memorial Hall\n\nThis site is organized into three major categories, as is Memorial Hall itself:\n\nYou can read more about the history of Memorial Hall and take a tour via Google Street View.\n\nWays to Explore\n\nThere are many ways to explore the stories of all of these men and women, including:\n\nClass Panels\n\nThere are over 2,700 alumni on the granite panels in Memorial Hall. They are organized by class year, and are generally listed chronologically. Any spelling, rank, or service errors discovered during research have been corrected in the list below. Those alumni who do not meet the requirements for Memorial Hall — but who are nonetheless listed there — have not been removed.\n\n★ 1840s ★\n\n★ 1850s ★\n\n★ 1860s ★\n\n★ 1870s ★\n\n★ 1880s ★\n\n★ 1890s ★\n\n★ 1900s ★\n\n★ 1910s ★\n\n★ 1920s ★\n\n★ 1930s ★\n\n★ 1940s ★\n\n★ 1950s ★\n\n★ 1960s ★\n\n★ 1970s ★\n\n★ 1980s ★\n\n★ 1990s ★\n\n★ 2000s ★\n\n★ 2010s ★\n\nThough we remember and honor the service and sacrifice of the alumni marked with a ★ on this website, they are not eligible for inclusion in Memorial Hall."
