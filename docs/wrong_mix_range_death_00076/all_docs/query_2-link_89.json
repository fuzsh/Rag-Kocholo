        "text": "Just concluded a short visit to India to meet our excellent India Risk leader Sivarama Krishnan and all Risk Partners of the India firm. It was a privilege to get a closer sneak peek into all the amazing work the India team is steering. The drive, energy, entrepreneurial spirit and forward-looking thinking of the team are commendable and inspiring. The market for risk services is growing tremendously fast and is a testimony to the buoyant India story, with a steady growth rate and projections of continued momentum. Between this visit and my last one about 18 months back, India‚Äôs Risk practice has grown almost by 2.5 times across a number of areas including Partners, talent and the breadth of innovative solutions as we look to serve the evolving needs of our clients. And those needs are fueled by the progressive outlook of our business leaders in India, some of whom I had the great pleasure of meeting during my visit. I am excited about the possibilities the India market and the India Risk team have to offer. I look forward to their continued success as they innovate and collaborate, propelling us to outperform and drive trust and inclusive growth as a collective whole. Sivarama Krishnan #Leadership #Teamwork #Innovation #ClientFocus #FutureForward #Manzil #PwC #RethinkRisk\n\nWhat an extraordinary event! It was an absolute honor to kick off \"Navigating Macro Risks with Confidence\" and hear the insightful views of our panel on \"Macro Risks in an Age of Disruption.\" We were privileged to have thought leaders Sir John Sawers, Emma Cox, Lord Gavin Barwell and Euan Cameron share their incredible insights on the interconnected risks of geopolitics, climate, and AI that businesses are facing today. And that was just the beginning! Our workshops delved even deeper into understanding the impacts of these risks and uncovering tangible steps to mitigate, prepare for and create value in this complex environment. We concluded the day with an inspiring discussion on organisational and personal resilience, and the power of technology in navigating macro risks with Bronwyn Bullen, Rupert Younger, Joe Gennings and Paul Williams. Reflecting on the day, I am filled with optimism for the future. We have the knowledge, insights and determination to seize the opportunities that lie ahead, taking risk intelligently to create value. And also to manage risk and build resilience to protect that value! A special thanks to all the attendees for your energy, enthusiasm and active participation. You made the event truly memorable. And ofcourse the fabulous PwC team that designed this fantastic event. #MacroRiskServices #BusinessSuccess #NavigatingChange #AI #ClimateTransition #Geopolitics #Resilience #Opportunities #PwC david coulon Bobbie R., Keith Harrington, Jane Woolcott, Mide O‚ÄôConnell ACA, Miranda Lacaze\n\nWe welcomed over 100 clients to our London EP office this afternoon for our fantastic #PWC AI: Trust in Reinvention event, and I was honoured to kick things off! During his keynote, Azeem Azhar provided valuable insights on the rapid pace of change, transformation for companies and society, historical tech shifts, and the power of inspiration. Later we heard from Kay Firth-Butterfield who engaged the audience with a focus on the significance of trust and ethics in AI. She discussed applying principles from past technological advancements, implementing guardrails to encourage innovation, and rallying for actionable steps we can take today. Our breakout sessions, expertly led by our PwC colleagues who work extensively in the field of AI, were a highlight of the event. These sessions focused on key areas such as building trust in AI, testing AI models, establishing effective AI governance, scaling AI safely, and ensuring customer trust while leveraging the potential of AI. We were also fortunate to have Microsoft share their insights on AI adoption, enriching the discussions even further. A heartfelt thank you to everyone who attended our event, to the organisers, and to Megan Higgins and Jo Salter MBE for being brilliant hosts! The atmosphere in the room was filled with enthusiasm, and I am truly thrilled about the potential that lies ahead when we collaborate. Let's continue to embrace AI and work towards building a future that we can trust. #AItrust #FutureForward Chris Murray Leigh Bates Chris Oxborough Chris Heys Kelsey Booth Felicity C.\n\nLast week I had the chance to visit my friends and colleagues within the Brazilian Risk Services team in S√£o Paulo. As part of the event they provided some exciting updates on progress being made towards our Global Risk strategy. There are so many opportunities being taken up, and coming down the line, which is testament to the wonderful team there. I saw so much dedication to their clients and to each other, setting the perfect scene to continuously push boundaries, try new things and innovate. This followed our Global Assurance Leadership Team meeting, which also took place in S√£o Paulo. During which PwC‚Äôs global assurance leaders spoke in depth about how we continue to build trust in what matters. #PwC #Assurance #RethinkRisk Hemione Hudson, James Chalmers, Alan Lee, Alejandro Esnal, Claire Berry, C√©cile Saint-Martin, Davi Guimaraes, Gary Rapsey, Ian Chambers, Len Combs, Linda Ummels, Mark Flavell CPA FCA MEng, Saverio Fato, Sunita Tsiames, Takeshi Yamaguchi, Tracey Riley, Dietmar Pr√ºmm, Geoffrey Ezgar, Andrin Bernet, Anita McOuat, FCPA, FCA, Daniel Li, Francisco Macedo, Andre Pannunzio, Denise Pinheiro, LUIZ PONZONI, Marcos Panassol, Marcelo Cioffi, Fabio Cajazeira, Mohamed Elborno, Gilly Lord\n\nWe‚Äôve had a great time in Edinburgh today for another of our PwC UK Risk Roadshows. Together, with the whole Risk Leadership team we‚Äôve connected with the incredible risk teams here, where we have celebrated success, as well as building our vision for the future together. As with many of the other roadshows, we‚Äôve touched on the power and opportunities brought with AI, and some of the examples of how we are harnessing it within our work. So many of our people are finding new ways to integrate AI solutions into the way they do things. I‚Äôd like to thank everyone who joined us, as well as those who helped bring the event to life.

Over the next couple of weeks 25,000+ risk professionals across our entire PwC Network are joining a range of events focused on the risk landscape and the future of risk. Today‚Äôs discussions centred around future trends and how our clients are managing complex areas of risk and regulation to create value and safeguard their organisations. Coming up we will see a selection of engaging virtual experiences and inspiring speakers bringing to life market-focused knowledge and insights. Our risk community is always prepared for the continuous change brought about by global shifts, geopolitical change, as well as advancements in technology, amongst many other factors. Being aware of this environment, the tools we have, and the teams around us, we need to make sure that we are prepared for these changes and challenges.
