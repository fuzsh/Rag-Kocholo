        "text": "AFTER a bomb took off his right thumb and forefinger, the silent film star Harold Lloyd lost some of his enthusiasm for the movies. The year was 1919, and the 26-year-old Lloyd was posing for a publicity shot on the set of Haunted Spooks. He remarked to the photographer that, for a fake, the bomb was producing an awful lot of smoke; seconds later it exploded, blowing the photographer clear across the room, injuring his assistant, and taking off the roof.\n\nLloyd himself was blinded for eight months, and scarred around the eyes, but after acquiring a leather glove and two prosthetic digits he went on to make some of his best movies - among them the comedy-thrillers Safety Last (1923) and Girl Shy (1924). But he also started to think about other lines of work - writing, producing and directing. He was particularly fascinated by the photographic process, and would try to get behind the movie camera as much as he was in front of it; some of the earliest Technicolor tests were filmed at Greenacres, his vast Beverly Hills estate.\n\nBut what enthused Lloyd most was 'stereoscopic' or three-dimensional photography. He retired as an actor in the Thirties and worked as a producer for RKO, but spent nearly all his free time taking 3-D pictures. Lloyd's granddaughter, Suzanne Lloyd Hayes, who grew up with her grandparents in Beverly Hills cannot remember a time when her grandfather was without a camera. 'And when 3-D came out he just fell in love with it,' she says.\n\n'He loved the fact that it looked so real, that you were really there, in the picture. He never shot 16mm home movies, or used a regular flat camera, or photographed in black-and-white. It was always 3-D, and it was always in colour.' Lloyd used a twin lens camera, which exposed two frames of film at once. The twin exposures were then mounted on paper, encased in aluminium and glass, and viewed as slides through a magnifying lens, or projected one on top of the other on a silver screen.\n\nSeen this way, the two pictures merged into a 3-D image, with the foreground distinct from the background. By the time he died in 1971, aged 77, Lloyd had amassed nearly 300,000 slides, some of which will be exhibited for the first time in London next week.\n\nLloyd was a popular man in Hollywood, and Greenacres was invariably full of movie people, all of them willing to be photographed. Some of them - Alan Ladd, Mary Pickford - were stars; others were unknowns. In 1952 the director Jean Negulesco brought the 25-year-old Marilyn Monroe to Greenacres to shoot a dream sequence for How To Marry a Millionaire. The actress lounged by the pool in a red diamant√©-studded swimming-costume, repeating the line, 'I hate careless men', and asking every now and then for a glass of Coke.\n\nThe scene was cut from the final film. A few weeks later Lloyd's friend Philippe Halsman called to say he was shooting Monroe for the cover of Life magazine - did Lloyd want to come along? Halsman and Lloyd drove round to Monroe's Los Angeles apartment, and Lloyd photographed her in stereo while Hausman took the photographs which launched the actress's career.\n\nLloyd was not alone in his enthusiasm for 3-D, and in 1950 he formed the Hollywood Stereoscopic Society - along with fellow actors Dick Powell, Ronald Colman, Edgar Bergen (father of Candice, who modelled in 3-D as a teenager), and Sterling Holloway, the voice of Winnie the Pooh. The men met frequently, and often invited curvy young women to come and pose for them - women whose pneumatic figures made them natural subjects for 3-D. Lloyd's photographs of Jayne Mansfield balancing on a chair for the photographer Bob Cummings make meetings of the Stereoscopes look like fun, slightly louche occasions, but Suzanne Lloyd Hayes remembers them differently: 'Most of the time they'd exchange slides and talk about meters and filters and strobe lights and new kinds of film. They were just mad shutterbugs, especially when they had some new gizmo to play with.'\n\nWhen Lloyd did not have a model to hand, he would photograph his granddaughter, and when she got bored, he would photograph his seven Great Danes. He took pictures of Greenacres, which had 44 rooms, and a lavishly decorated Christmas tree on permanent display. When Douglas MacArthur returned from the Korean War in 1951, a journalist friend of Lloyd's got him a press pass for the triumphal procession through San Francisco; his 3-D portraits of the General were taken from just inches away. Lloyd's handball court - which once hosted the national championships - was turned into a studio, and he filled a 'chaos room' with boxes of slides, which were sorted and filed by his secretary, Roy Brooks.\n\nLloyd also started to travel, taking his wife - Lloyd married Mildred 'Mimi' Davis, his Safety Last leading lady, in 1923 - and small granddaughter with him (her mother, his eldest daughter Gloria, had by this time moved to Europe). The camera went with them - to the top of the Golden Gate Bridge, to the Space Needle in Seattle, to the crumbling edge of the Grand Canyon. Everywhere the Lloyds went, Roy Brooks forwarded them boxes of film; Lloyd would then send the exposed film back to Hollywood, to be edited in the chaos room at a later date. 'Taking a car through Europe with him was a unique experience,' recalls Suzanne Lloyd Hayes. 'We used to call him \"Stop the Car Harry\" because that's what he was always telling the driver to do. He'd always want to go that bit closer to the edge, to push the envelope a little further.'\n\nIn the Sixties he did: Lloyd teamed up with a group called the Happy Seven - two women and five men who travelled across America taking 3-D photographs. Much of Lloyd's work from this time consists of dramatic nudes-in-nature - women in waterfalls, women in mountain streams, women stretched out across the red sand of the Mojave Desert in southern California. There was kinkier stuff, too - caped women whipping caped men, and vice versa, in the Greenacres studio.\n\nBut Suzanne Lloyd Hayes says it wasn't these pictures that surprised her about her grandfather's collection, so much as the sheer size of it: 'Of course I remembered a lot of shots, but it was overwhelming to see just how much there was.' Despite Roy Brooks's efforts, the slides had become jumbled over the years. 'There'd be photos of Paris, then pictures of my eighth birthday party, a shot of Marilyn Monroe, pictures of his dogs, then the Beatles at the Hollywood Bowl. I do remember the Beatles pictures, because I was desperate for him to get those back, I nagged him the minute we got home from the concert.'\n\nLloyd appeared in one last film, in 1947 - Preston Sturges's The Sin of Harold Diddlebock, a commercial failure - but was never again persuaded to return to the cinema. 'Mike Nichols almost got him one time,' recalls Suzanne Lloyd Hayes. 'He was going to make a movie with Lee Strasberg and George Burns, but then he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and had to bow out.' Lloyd never exhibited his photographs in his lifetime, nor did he have plans to; to him, 3-D was a hobby, not an art form, and it was far less vogueish in the Sixties than it had been in the Forties, when he was starting out. So what might he have made of being exhibited in London? 'I think he's up in heaven,' says Suzanne Lloyd Hayes, 'laughing about it.'"
