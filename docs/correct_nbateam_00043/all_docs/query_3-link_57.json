        "text": "According to ESPN's Marc Stein, the Memphis Grizzlies will receive Boston Celtics forward Jeff Green for forward Tayshaun Prince and a future first-round pick.\n\nYahoo! Sports reporter Adrian Wojnarowski says the trade is waiting on a third team to be fully finalized.\n\nThe 28-year-old, 6-foot-9 Green is averaging 17.6 points per game and 4.3 rebounds per-game as the Celtics top scoring option.\n\nPrince is averaging 7.4 points per game and 3.2 rebounds per game, but also making $7.7 million as a bench player.\n\nThe deal is expected to be finalized Friday night.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nYahoo! Sports reporter Adrian Wojnarowski has revealed the third team is the New Orleans Pelicans, and Grizzlies guard Quincy Pondexter is involved. Wojnarowski is reporting Pondexter would go to New Orleans, while Boston would receive forward John Salmons from New Orleans.\n\nWojnarowski is also reporting the Grizzlies could complete a deal with the Celtics without the involvement of New Orleans or Pondexter. They are also working with several other teams on dealing Pondexter, but the main focus is the New Orleans angle of the deal.\n\nUPDATE 2:\n\nAccording to multiple reports, Austin Rivers is now involved in lieu of John Salmons. Rivers would go to the Celtics, and be eventually flipped to the Los Angeles Clippers for a Clippers second round pick.\n\nAs it stands, the framework of the proposed deal looks like this:\n\nTo MEMPHIS:\n\nF Jeff Green\n\nG Russ Smith\n\nTo BOSTON:\n\nF Tayshaun Prince\n\nG Austin Rivers\n\nGrizzlies future 1st Round Pick\n\nTo NEW ORLEANS:\n\nG Quincy Pondexter\n\nGrizzlies future 2nd round pick\n\nThe league office is closed for the weekend, so the deal should be finalized Monday.\n\nCopyright 2014 WMC Action News 5.
