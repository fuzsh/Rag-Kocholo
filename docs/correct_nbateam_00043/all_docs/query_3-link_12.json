        "text": "After eleven seasons in Motown, Tayshaun Prince was traded to the Memphis Grizzlies in 2013 where he played 139 games before once again being traded in 2015 to the Boston Celtics. During his short nine game stint in Celtic green, the University of Kentucky product put up some of the best shooting numbers of his career (.559/.625/.833) and many believed he was poised to join his hometown Clippers who were looking to make a deep playoff run. However, it wasn't to be, as Danny Ainge and Stan Van Gundy agreed to a trade sending little used forwards Jonas Jerebko and Luigi Datome to Beantown in exchange for the 35-year-old defensive specialist.\n\nAfter some initial confusion regarding Prince's role in Detroit and a potential buyout, he committed himself to the Pistons until the end of the year, and was quick to remind us that he still had gas left in the tank. In 23 games (7 starts) the lanky Palace Prince put up a respectable 7.3 points and 4.2 rebounds in 24.8 minutes per game, and continued his shooting form (.431/.423/.655), finishing the 2015 season with a shooting slash of .440/.463/.754.\n\nWhilst the odds that Tayshaun re-signs with the Pistons are fairly low, he certainly used his time in Detroit to showcase his skills to the League, and proved to be a steadying presence at the 3 along with fellow NBA veteran Caron Butler. Despite there not being much competition for minutes at small forward with Cartier Martin being a non-factor and Quincy Miller still too raw to log meaningful NBA minutes, Prince was a welcome addition to a rotation that lacked experience and consistent shooting.\n\nMuch like the team's other veterans, Prince became a leader in the locker room and bought into Stan Van Gundy's system, and helped the team's other deadline acquisition, Reggie Jackson, find his groove in the Motor City. Whilst many didn't understand the trade or expect the NBA Champion to perform well in productive minutes, Prince proved the doubters wrong, and was one, if not the, best small forward to log time for the Pistons this season."
