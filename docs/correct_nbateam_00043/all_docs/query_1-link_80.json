        "text": "LEXINGTON, Ky. – Kentucky senior forward Oscar Tshiebwe continued to add to his collection of honors, earning Associated Press Second Team All-American laurels on Tuesday.\n\nTshiebwe is the first Wildcat to earn All-America accolades in consecutive seasons since Tayshaun Prince in 2001 and 2002.\n\nTshiebwe leads the Wildcats in scoring (16.5) and rebounds (13.1) for the second-consecutive season. He is the only player in the country averaging at least 15.0 points, 10.0 rebound, 1.5 steals and 1.0 blocks per game in another banner season for the Wildcats.\n\nThe Associated Press is one of the four “major” NCAA-recognized All-America teams that the NCAA uses for its consensus All-America teams. Tshiebwe claimed third-team accolades by The Sporting News last week. The others are the U.S. Basketball Writers and the NABC.\n\nTshiebwe is the 12th player under John Calipari to earn All-America honors and the first to win multiple distinctions by one of the four major organizations. He joins John Wall (2010), DeMarcus Cousins (2010), Anthony Davis (2012), Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (2012), Julius Randle (2014), Willie Cauley-Stein (2015), Karl-Anthony Towns (2015), Tyler Ulis (2016), Jamal Murray (2016), Malik Monk (2017) and PJ Washington (2019) in earning All-America distinction by either The Sporting News, AP, USBWA or the NABC. He is the 56th player overall in program history to earn All-America distinction.\n\nThroughout program history and with Tshiebwe’s inclusion, 24 players have garnered All-America distinction in multiple seasons.\n\nTshiebwe is not only averaging a double-double but he’s breaking records in the process.\n\nHe is leading the country for the second straight year with 13.1 rebounds per contest to go along with a team-best 16.5 points per game. Among Tshiebwe’s Southeastern Conference-high 19 doubles, the senior has tallied six 20-point, 15-rebound contests this season after seven a season ago. He has 13 of the 55 such contests by SEC players in the last 10 seasons.\n\nIn just 64 games for Kentucky, Tshiebwe ranks eighth in program history with 909 rebounds. He has registered a double-double in 47 of those 64 games, ranking third in program history behind Dan Issel (64) and Cotton Nash (48).\n\nHe became the 61st player in program history to tally more than 1,000 points in a career and currently ranks 49th overall with 1,084. Only Bill Spivey (1,213) tallied more points than Tshiebwe in just two seasons with the Cats.\n\nAveraging 12.1 rebounds per game for his career, Tshiebwe joins Paul Millsap and Kenneth Faried as the only players since the 1996-97 season to average 12 rebounds per game for their career. He leads the country in rebounds per game and ranks second in total rebounds (394).\n\nIn one of the best individual performances of the season, Tshiebwe poured in a career-high 37 points and added 24 rebounds in a home victory against Georgia on Jan. 17. It was the first 35-point, 20-rebound game for a Wildcat since 1976 and just the fifth such game in program history.\n\nThe Lubumbashi, Democratic Republic of the Congo native has tallied double-figure points in each of UK’s last eight games and has produced four 20-point efforts in that stretch. He has generated 12 games with 15 or more rebounds this season.\n\nTshiebwe is racking up postseason honors by the day. The major honors he’s won or is a finalist for so far include:\n\nAssociated Press Second-Team All-America\n\nSporting News Third-Team All-America\n\nAll-SEC First Team (coaches and media)\n\nJohn R. Wooden Award finalist\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar Award finalist\n\nOscar Robertson Trophy late season watch list"
