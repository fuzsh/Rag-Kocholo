        "text": "AUBURN HILLS >> Tayshaun Prince is back with the Pistons, the team he played his first 10-plus seasons with and won a championship in 2004. But Prince didn’t expect to be back in Detroit, in fact he was surprised Boston traded him at all.\n\n“There was so much speculation of me being bought out, going to a contender or what not,” Prince said. “My thing was while I was in Boston, I was doing a good job mentoring those young guys and also playing at the same time. Things were going well and me and Danny (Ainge) had several conversations. Like I said when I was in Boston, all options were on the table because I knew they were trying to go young. Basically I thought no trade was going to happen at all. I thought I was going to be in Boston then see if the buyout was going to happen or not. Buyout wasn’t 100 percent so make no mistake about it.\n\n“I thought there was no trade at all then we get on the bus ready to go to practice then all of sudden come here, you’ve been traded. I ain’t even know where I was going, I was pissed off from the get go. I’m serious. Coach (Brad) Stevens and I talked, there was no word on where I was going. Then 2, 3, 4, 5 phones calls, I get a call from Arnie (Kander), I get a call from this guy, I’m like, ‘Hold on, I didn’t just get traded to Detroit did I?’ That’s how it worked out.”\n\nPrince felt he was playing well in Boston. In nine games, he averaged 8.4 points, 3.3 rebounds and two assists in 22 minutes per game.\n\n“The one thing that kind of shocked me was that I felt the Boston stint wasn’t going to be long, but I was playing well there,” Prince said. “I was in Memphis and … I wasn’t even in the rotation believe it or not. A couple guys got hurt and I started playing. Once I got to Boston I was playing pretty well. Getting limited minutes of course but that was ‘A’ OK. I was playing well, the guys were learning, stuff like that. Everything was a shock in that aspect that I had been traded.”\n\nPrince was asked more than once if he’s glad to be back in Detroit and, but he didn’t give a yes or no answer. Prince’s response was he’s just glad to be playing basketball.\n\n“The most important thing is I can still play this game,” Prince said. “No matter where you play it, as long as I’m in a uniform I feel like it doesn’t matter where I play. I think what’s a good thing is I’m back in familiar stomping grounds. Even though I’ve only played with a couple guys on this team. But as you know I can pick up things real fast. Whether I haven’t played with (Kentavious) Caldwell-Pope, Reggie Jackson, (Spencer) Dinwiddie and all those other guys, believe it or not, just like I picked up in Boston, I can do the same thing here.”\n\nPrince feels he can contribute to the Pistons, who at 23-33 are a half game behind Brooklyn for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. Prince said he can be a mentor to younger players, but wants people to be careful with their use of the word mentor.\n\n“It’s tough being a mentor because I can still play,” Prince said. “I want people to be careful when they say mentor because a lot of times when people say mentor they kind of look at you as you’re on your way out and I’m not on my way out. Obviously I’m not the 40-minute a night guy that I used to be or 38 minutes or nothing like that. But I’m not by any means on my way out.\n\n“I want people to be careful when they see be a veteran and be a mentor because a lot of people think a mentor sits on the bench, let guys know what you see or in practice, things like that. Yes, I’m going to be a mentor, but at the same time I know I can play, whatever it is 20 minutes, 25 minutes, whatever the case may be. I’m still going to do what I do.”\n\nThere was a lot of speculation Prince wanted a buyout from the Pistons, but Pistons coach and president of basketball operations Stan Van Gundy made it clear they made the trade because they felt Prince could help the team.\n\n“I think what happened quite honestly is he expected one thing, it didn’t happen, that takes a little time to adjust,” Van Gundy said. “But we talked and I think he’s ready to go and will be a big help to us down the stretch. We obviously wanted him and he understands it. We have a role for him. We actually took on more money to get him here. He’s a guy we wanted. This wasn’t a throw away move. I think hearing all that he’s ready to go and made it really clear he doesn’t want to talk about buyout or any of that stuff. He’s ready to play.”\n\nDetroit hosts the Cleveland Cavaliers Tuesday and Prince is expected to play.\n\n“The thing for me is, come in, and when I’m on the floor, off the floor, help these guys out, be the veteran that I’ve been everywhere I’ve been,” Prince said. “More importantly do what I do. Me and Stan had some conversations on what his plans are. We’ll see. The first few games will probably be kind of putting me in slowly and seeing how things go and go from there.”"
