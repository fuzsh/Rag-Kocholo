        "text": "INDIANAPOLIS – The 2004 NBA championship will forever be the most memorable on-court moment of Tayshaun Prince's 10-plus seasons with the Detroit Pistons.\n\nBut as much as anything, Prince will look back fondly on all the friendships he formed since the Pistons made him their first-round pick (23rd overall) out of Kentucky in the 2002 NBA Draft.\n\n\"What stands out is the different experiences, the different players I played with,\" said Prince, who was traded Wednesday along with Austin Daye to the Memphis Grizzlies in a three-team deal that was struck shortly before a 98-79 loss to the Indiana Pacers.\n\n\"So many bonds and friendships that I call brothers, especially dating back to when I first got here. I've been here 10 and a half years and I don't know how many different people I've played with. The court memories are obviously the championship and the battles with the Pacers and the Heat and the Cavs.\n\n\"More than anything, the friendships with the guys that I've played with throughout my career, the bond that I've had with people in management. Stuff like that goes a long ways. Those are things that obviously will be missed, too. It's mixed emotions.\"\n\nPrince and Daye were called into coach Lawrence Frank's office less than an hour before game time and informed that they were part of a deal that will bring guard Jose Calderon from Toronto to Detroit.\n\nMemphis also got Ed Davis from Toronto while sending Rudy Gay and reserve center Hamed Haddadi to the Raptors.\n\nPrince had followed the trade rumors involving Gay for the past few weeks but never expected to be part of a deal involving the high-scoring forward. After signing a four-year contract before last season, Prince expected to finish his career with the Pistons.\n\n\"Of course that was always in mind as far as a plan,\" said Prince, 32. \"Obviously, I don't have control over that and things can happen at any time. It's just a tough situation. When I signed back here, it was to make things go back in the right direction.\n\n\"Obviously, last year was pretty brutal and the start of this year was as well. But I thought things really started to go well as of late. Couple bad losses here the last couple of games but for the most part, the past month we've played very good basketball.\n\n\"I was shocked but like I told you guys before, it's a business. You never know what's going to happen.\"\n\nPrince, the last remaining player from the Pistons 2004 championship team, had started all 45 games this season before Wednesday's loss to the Pacers. He's averaging 11.7 points, 4.6 rebounds and 2.5 assists while shooting 44.4 percent in 33 minutes per night.\n\nIn 769 career games with the Pistons, Prince averaged 12.8 points, 4.7 rebounds and 2.6 assists.\n\nPrince and Daye got word of the trade from Pistons president of basketball operations Joe Dumars, who didn't make the trip to Memphis but delivered the news over the phone in Frank's office.\n\n\"I know how much it hurt Joe,\" Frank said. \"We talked about it in the locker room as a team. As much as people talk about this being a business, there's a brotherhood and family there. I know Joe felt horrible it had to be right before the game.\n\n\"I'm eternally grateful for (Prince's) professionalism and how he handled himself. This is the tough part of the business. I wish them the best of luck. I can't thank them enough for their contributions. They both represented the organization in a first-class way.\n\n\"These are difficult moves to make but we feel going forward these are moves we need to make.\"\n\nDownload the Detroit Pistons on MLive app for iPhone and Android\n\n–\n\nFollow David Mayo and Brendan Savage on Twitter\n\n–"
