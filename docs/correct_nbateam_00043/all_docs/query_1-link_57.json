        "text": "Image: Joe Murphy/NBAE via Getty Images\n\nWhen news broke that the Detroit Pistons would begin a search to finally bring aboard a new general manager after not employing one for the last two seasons, local fans immediately pointed to former stars of the team that should be given the opportunity. The two most common names brought to light were Chauncey Billups and Tayshaun Prince, two members of the Goin' to Work Pistons that won the NBA Championship in 2004.\n\nWhile there has been no substantial word on Billups and what, if there is any, chance there may be for him to be interviewed by the Pistons for the job, there have been conflicting reports on Prince's candidacy. Initially, it was reported that the Detroit Pistons were not interested in Prince and that they would not be interviewing him for the position, a new report from Omari Sankofa II of the Detroit Free Press, Prince is actually on Detroit's list of potential candidates.\n\nFrom Sankofa:\n\nPrince is on the Pistons’ list of candidates for assistant general manager, a league source told the Free Press on Wednesday evening. Prince, who has been with the Memphis Grizzlies’ front office since 2017, fits what the Pistons are hoping to accomplish with the hire.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/omarisankofa/status/1268335220815691784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1268335220815691784&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.freep.com%2Fstory%2Fsports%2Fnba%2Fpistons%2F2020%2F06%2F03%2Ftayshaun-prince-detroit-pistons%2F3140799001%2F\n\nPrince has been apart of the Memphis Grizzlies' front office since 2017. He most recently served as the Vice President of Basketball Affairs after being promoted to the position in April of 2019.\n\nThis is not the first time that Prince has been linked to a role in the Pistons' front office.\n\nThe Detroit Free Press published a report in May of 2019 that Ed Stefanski was interested in adding Prince to the team's front office.\n\nFrom the Detroit Free Press:\n\nStefanski said he hadn’t yet spoken with Prince about a role with the Pistons, but a source with firsthand knowledge of the situation told the Free Press that Prince is under consideration for a spot in the front office.\n\nThe positions in the front office currently seem to be flexible for Detroit. There are talks that the team is looking to add multiple members to the franchise following the departure of Malik Rose, who was considered a rising star in the front office.\n\nAdd Prince to a list of candidates that include Wes Wilcox, Ryan McDonough, and Mark Hughes.\n\nWith the season officially over for the Pistons, the entire franchise has plenty of time to make a calculated decision. However, we'll see if this hire has the power to make the decisions around the franchise or if Ed Stefanski is still the top decison-maker.\n\nFeatured Image: Joe Murphy/NBAE via Getty Images"
