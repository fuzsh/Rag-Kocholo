        "text": "Tayshaun Prince had several interesting comments about the Pistons' lack of defense and effort in the team's 131-103 loss to the Denver Nuggets. Letting J.R. Smith attempt 12 three-pointers and score 21 points in the fourth quarter was an \"embarrassment.\" [DN]\n\nContinuing their weekly NBA Draft prospects series, PistonPowered takes a look how USC junior Nikola Vucevic could help the Pistons next season. While he possesses modest athleticism, this double-double producing big man is worth the risk if he falls to the second-round. [PP]\n\nBen Gulker, using Wins Produced numbers, takes a shot at defending John Kuester's lineup change of replacing Rodney Stuckey at starting point guard with Tracy McGrady. Gulker maintains that McGrady needs playing time, but that Kuester should give him someone else's minutes. [PBTN]\n\nThe Pistons are now the worst defensive team in the league in terms of field-goal percentage defense. Opposing teams are shooting an average of 48.4 percent from the floor on the season.
