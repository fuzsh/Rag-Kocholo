        "text": "Jamal Crawford, Tayshaun Prince\n\nLos Angeles Clippers guard Jamal Crawford, center, shoots over Boston Celtics forward Tayshaun Prince (12) during the second half of an NBA basketball game in Los Angeles, Monday, Jan. 19, 2015. The Clippers won 102-93.\n\n(AP Photo/Alex Gallardo)\n\nLOS ANGELES, Calif. -- Because Tayshaun Prince had only practiced once with the Boston Celtics, head coach Brad Stevens planned to ease the veteran into the rotation. Several times in the past week, Stevens repeated a lesson he had learned from previous trades: do not hand players a lot of minutes until they get acclimated.\n\nRegardless of what Stevens said, though, Prince received 19 minutes in his debut, almost as many as he averaged before getting traded from the Memphis Grizzlies last week. The small forward impressed his new coach enough to play parts of crunch-time -- however much crunch-time there was in a 102-93 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers.\n\n\"I didn't expect to play him near that much,\" Stevens said. \"I felt pretty comfortable with him on the floor because he's really savvy. He's always in the right place, especially defensively. A couple of times he looked at me like, 'Where am I supposed to go?' because on offense I called a play. Luckily, that was mostly in the second half so it was right in front of our bench. But he's good. He's a good addition to any group. He impacts winning. He impacts you in the right way.\"\n\nPrince had a mild stat line of two points, two rebounds and one assist. Still, he showed his defensive versatility by switching screens with big men and even spending a stretch on All-Star point guard Chris Paul.\n\nBehind starting small forward Jae Crowder, the Celtics have an obvious need for size on the wing. Prince doesn't fit into the long-term plans, but, as long as he stays in Boston, could be in line to receive a regular role.\n\n\"It's crazy,\" he said. \"Growing up in L.A., I was a big-time Lakers fan. And now I've played with Detroit and Boston.\"\n\nStarters a no-show\n\nOne disturbing Celtics trend: an inability to generate buckets from the starting lineup. It's a small sample size, but still...\n\nOver eight games and 75 minutes together, the new first unit -- Evan Turner, Avery Bradley, Jae Crowder, Jared Sullinger and Tyler Zeller -- has averaged 87.1 points per 100 possessions. For the season, Philadelphia's 91.0 ranks as the worst offense in the league, well behind anybody else.\n\nAgainst the Clippers, the first-unit offense screeched face-first into rock bottom. Over 11 minutes with all five starters on the court, the Celtics shot 3 for 18 from the floor (16.7 percent) with five turnovers and got outscored by 16 points, according to NBA.com. Meanwhile, the bench, featuring contributions from everyone, led a swift comeback to cut a 23-point deficit to three.\n\nThe discrepancy was partially due to the competition. The Clippers' starting lineup counts as one of the league's best; the bench, not at all. Still, the Celtics need to get more offense out of their first unit.\n\n\"I didn't think the energy was too bad. And the way that I judge that was the transition defense was really good. They were really in tune to getting back and setting the defense,\" Stevens said. \"I thought offensively we were much sloppier with that group than we were with different groups in the game. Not necessarily the bench, per se, but just any other combinations. Obviously, it didn't go well at the start of either half.\"\n\nObviously.\n\n\"We were one pass short most of the game,\" Stevens said. \"We didn't move the ball. We've got to keep moving that thing, we've got to make sure we're finding the best shot. We took a lot of contested jump shots in the first half and those aren't good shots against this level of athlete.\"\n\nAdded Prince: \"I thought our defense was good. We just couldn't make any shots in the first seven (or) eight minutes of the game. The second unit, we just tried to come in, move the ball a little bit more, try to attack different areas and just try to make plays. We kind of caught a rhythm at certain parts of the game but we've got to sustain it better for 48 minutes.\"\n\nWill the Celtics think about changing the first unit? Maybe. But before the game, Stevens fielded a question about whether rookie Marcus Smart might overtake Evan Turner for a starting spot.\n\n\"I'm not too concerned about the starting lineup right now because all of those guys are having their moments where they're playing well,\" Stevens replied. \"Marcus (Smart) is probably playing as well in his role as he has all year. So I think that you might see that, but I don't think it's the end-all, be-all for him because he's been in a lot of games at the end, especially the games he's playing well. So I don't see any change that would happen (against the Clippers) or Thursday (agains the Blazers), but who knows? We'll see.\n\nHack-a-Jordan worked ... kind of\n\nLate in the fourth quarter, as his team tried to close out a spirited comeback, Stevens called for the Celtics to send 39-percent free throw shooter DeAndre Jordan to the line. The Clippers center did his part to make the Hack-a-Jordan strategy successful, missing three out of four foul shots. But the Celtics misfired on back-to-back threes and failed to cut into the deficit.\n\n\"That worked for the first three shots and then he made the last one,\" Stevens said. \"But we have to score almost every possession at that point and we didn't score, so it goes back to the offensive side of it.\"\n\nThe Clippers took out Jordan for one possession (and scored), sending the clock under two minutes. At that time, a rule to limit off-ball fouls comes in and the strategy no longer counts as a viable option.\n\nSaid Stevens, \"I don't love that but it seemed like the right play at the right time.\""
