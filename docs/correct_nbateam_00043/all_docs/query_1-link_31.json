        "text": "Paul Sancya/Associated Press\n\nThe Detroit Pistons reportedly haven't requested an interview with Tayshaun Prince, a member of the franchise's 2004 NBA championship team, for its vacant general manager position.\n\nESPN's Eric Woodyard reported the update Wednesday and noted Prince, who's the Memphis Grizzlies' vice president of basketball affairs, \"wasn't on Detroit's initial interview list.\"\n\nPrince joined the Grizzlies' front office in 2017 as an adviser and has quickly worked through the ranks.\n\nLast June, Memphis executive vice president Zach Kleiman said the University of Kentucky product has established himself as a \"core member\" of the front office, per David Cobb of the Commercial Appeal.\n\n\"That's evaluating players, that's NBA, G League, international,\" Kleiman said. \"But it's also evaluating coaching talent. Tayshaun obviously has an incredible wealth of experience, hands-on experience over the course of his playing career.\"\n\nThe 40-year-old California native's rapid rise in Memphis raised speculation about whether he could return to the Pistons to lead a front office. So far, it appears the team is looking in a different direction.\n\nStefan Bondy of the New York Daily News reported Detroit has three early contenders in its search, which will be \"extensive:\"\n\nFormer Phoenix Suns GM Ryan McDonough\n\nFormer Atlanta Hawks GM Wes Wilcox\n\nLos Angeles Clippers assistant GM Mark Hughes\n\nThe team's choice will work alongside senior adviser Ed Stefanski.\n\nPrince spent the first 11 years of his NBA career with the Pistons and returned for a second half-season stint in 2015. He also played for the Grizzlies, Boston Celtics and Minnesota Timberwolves before his playing days ended in 2016."
