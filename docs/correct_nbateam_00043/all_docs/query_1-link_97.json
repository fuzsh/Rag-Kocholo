        "text": "Kobe Bryant, LeBron James and Dwyane Wade were part of the famous Redeem Team.\n\nCarmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh and Dwight Howard were also key members of a Team USA squad that avenged a highly disappointing bronze medal in 2004 with Olympic gold in 2008.\n\nBut while Carlos Boozer, Deron Williams and Tayshaun Prince have begun to fade into baskeball history, one player was a big-time scorer in summer of 2008 yet is mostly forgotten now when Redeem Team memories resurface.\n\nFrom 2002-09, Michael Redd was one of the best shooters and scorers in the NBA.\n\nHe accomplished it all despite being a second-round draft pick (No. 43 overall) and overcoming steep odds to evolve into an All-NBA selection.\n\nRedd only played in six games as a rookie and didn't start a contest.\n\nDuring his second season, he increased his average scoring by almost 10 points and received Most Improved Player votes.\n\nA strong 2002-03 campaign was followed by a career breakthrough the next year, when Redd averaged 21.7 points, was named to the All-Star team and finished 14th in NBA MVP voting.\n\n\"He was really a bucket,\" one fan tweeted.\n\n\"I think this era he would have been a bigger name,\" a second fan posted. \"He was a great player -- walking bucket.\"\n\n\"You're talking about getting buckets!\" a third fan wrote. \"This is why I always say James Harden is good but not something new!\"\n\nRedd became Milwaukee's best player during an era when the Bucks annually lost in the first round of the postseason or failed to make the playoffs.\n\nIn 2007, Redd was rewarded with selection to Team USA for the FIBA Americas tournament.\n\nHe averaged 15 points and connected on 28 3-pointers in the competition.\n\nWhen the 2008 Redeem Team was formed, Redd's name joined Bryant, James and Wade on one of the strongest rosters in US Olympic history.\n\nâ€œI went from a second-round pick to winning gold with Kobe, LeBron and D-Wade in the Olympics,\" Redd said. \"It was the greatest time of my life.\"\n\nRedd signed a massive six-year, $90 million contract with the Bucks that featured an average annual salary of $15 million.\n\nBut career highlights were followed by frustration and misfortune.\n\nRedd tore the ACL and MCL in his left knee and missed the majority of the 2008-09 season.\n\nHe played three more years but only started in 14 games, while his average scoring fell to just 4.4 points in 2010-11.\n\nRedd reinjured his left knee again and spent his last season in the NBA as a bench player for Phoenix.\n\nRedd retired in 2013 but left a lasting impact on the Bucks, who eventually won the NBA Finals in 2021 with Giannis Antetokounmpo.\n\n\"It's been a glorious 11 years,\" Redd said when he left Milwaukee. \"I wouldn't trade anything. Just had a tremendous journey over these 11 years.\"\n\nRedd made more than $100 million during his NBA career, scored 57 points in one game, and sank eight 3s in a quarter.\n\nIn 2008, he was a key shooter for the Redeem Team's pursuit of Olympic gold.\n\nRedd averaged 19 points on 44.7 percent shooting during his NBA career.\n\nIn 2024, basketball fans that remember his name associate Redd with the Bucks and Olympic gold.\n\n\"It's been an amazing journey,\" he said. \"Some ups, some downs. But through it all, the fans have been great, the organization's been great to my family.\""
