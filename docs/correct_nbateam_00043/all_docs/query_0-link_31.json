        "text": "\"We have a lot of talent on this team…But I think at the same time coach is having a hard time trying to figure the right pieces out,\" Prince told Fanhouse.\n\nThen again, Prince is taking a shot at management, too. Undoubtedly, one of the reasons Prince alleges Kuester has a problem \"figuring out the pieces\" is the gluttony of wing players on the roster – one of which is the disgruntled Prince.\n\nNormally, this would be a clear sign that the Pistons should start shopping the 30-year-old Prince. But the murky ownership situation complicates things.\n\nPrince is the team's longest tenured (9 seasons) and second highest-paid ($11M) player. He is a free agent this summer and has made it clear he'll be shopping his services to the highest bidder.\n\nThe Pistons can go one of two ways. They can trade him and get something in return; or, they can allow him to sulk through the season, so the new owners won't have to commit as much to player costs in their first full season at the helm.\n\nWithout knowing who their new owners are, let alone in what direction they want to travel, this is an impossible decision. But the most rational move is to trade him while he still has value.\n\nThe Pistons have been stuck in neutral for three seasons now. It's unlikely that Prince suddenly becomes key to their revival. And while salary cap space is useful for some teams, it won't be for the Pistons in 2011 when the lone marquee free agent is another wing – Carmelo Anthony."
