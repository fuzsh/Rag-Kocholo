        "text": "Matt Williams\n\n@DraftExpress\n\nOverview: A ridiculously long wing, who has surprising athleticism and a fairly polished perimeter game. Owner of a 7-2 wingspan. Very much on the skinny side. Hasnt gained much weight since entering the League, but it hasnt hurt his play. Shows surprising quickness and speed in the open floor. Quickness, length and skill combination allow his to be an impact player on both ends. Shows great intensity on the defensive end. Named to the NBA All-Defensive Second team in 2005 and 2006. Has an unorthodox left-handed stroke, but has developed into a nice offensive weapon. Very durable and tough despite his frame. One of the most versatile talents in the game today. Has a winning attitude, which he fostered at Kentucky under Tubby Smith after winning two state titles at Dominguez HS in Compton, California. Helped the Pistons win the NBA Championship in 2004. Cousin JP Prince plays at Tennessee.\n\nOffense: Extremely versatile offensive player due to his height and relative length for his position. Scores in numerous ways. Capable of spotting up on the outside, running the floor in transition, taking his man one-on-one, and working over smaller defenders in the post. Interesting shooting mechanics. Keeps his elbows extremely wide and lets the ball fly from his shoulder. Tough to argue with the results. Mechanics make his shot almost impossible to block. Great shot selection. Accurate from three point range. Capable shooter off the dribble. Likes to pull up going left. Tough to guard off the dribble due to his length and deceptive first step. Good ball handler. Nice post game. Turns right to the point that hes very predictable. Will get some easy looks from in close by working off the ball. Very high basketball IQ on the offensive end. Has improved significantly over the last few years. Great complimentary offensive player.\n\nDefense: Detroits best and most versatile perimeter defender. Perhaps the second most important player on the team defensively behind Rasheed Wallace. Draws the toughest perimeter assignment in most cases. Length allows him to contest absolutely every shot. Wingspan allows him play off his man and still get a hand up on everything. Deceptive quickness helps him deny penetration. Looks impossible to drive around when he gets in his defensive stance. Deflects a lot of passes. Can guard three positions. Not an ideal post defender due to his size, but he fights for position. Standing reach makes him tough to shoot over when he goes straight up. Decent rebounder. Great shot blocker who prefers to try and negate fast breaks and easy layups. Not a risk taker in the half court. Makes an impact on his physical assets alone."
