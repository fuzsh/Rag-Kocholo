        "text": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) – Tayshaun Prince and Quincy Pondexter were unavailable Sunday night for Memphis for the Grizzlies’ game Sunday night against Phoenix, awaiting the completion of a three-team trade.\n\nOn Saturday night, a person familiar with the deal said the Grizzlies, Boston Celtics and New Orleans Pelicans have agreed on a five-player trade that would send forward Jeff Green from Boston to Memphis.\n\nThe person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the trade hasn’t been announced and formal approval by the NBA isn’t expected until Monday.\n\nPrince would go from Memphis to Boston and Pondexter from Memphis to New Orleans.\n\nThe trade also would send Austin Rivers, the 10th overall pick in 2012, from New Orleans to Boston, and 2014 second-round pick Russ Smith from New Orleans to Memphis. Memphis also will send a protected first-round draft choice to Boston and a second-rounder to New Orleans.\n\nMemphis coach Dave Joerger said he could not comment further until Monday."
