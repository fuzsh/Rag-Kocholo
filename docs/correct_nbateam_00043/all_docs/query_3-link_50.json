        "text": "Defense was one of the hallmarks of the 2004 Detroit Pistons squad, known as the \"Goin' to Work\" era.\n\nOn May 24, 2004, one of the iconic plays from that run to the NBA championship for the Pistons was Tayshaun Prince's block on the Indiana Pacers' Reggie Miller in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nTwenty years later, that play still resonates as one of the premier defensive efforts — in the playoffs or regular season — because of the distance that Prince covered and the timing to get the block without committing a goaltending violation.\n\nWith the Pistons leading, 69-67, and less than 30 seconds left in the game, the Pacers got possession of the ball following a turnover by Chauncey Billups. Pacers guard Jamaal Tinsley passed the ball ahead to Miller at midcourt — with Prince far behind, but still in pursuit. Miller took one dribble and tried to lay the ball up for the potential tying score.\n\nBut before the ball could hit the backboard — which would have been a goaltending violation — Prince came from the opposite side of the rim and executed a clean block, sending Prince tumbling into Pacers fans behind the basket. Miller and the Pacers fans at Conseco Fieldhouse were in shock and disbelief at what they had just witnessed.\n\n\"You may never see another play like that again,\" Pistons play-by-play announcer George Blaha bellowed.\n\nWhat's often forgotten in that special defensive play is that Richard Hamilton was able to corral the rebound, because the ball stayed in play. Hamilton was fouled and made both free throws, boosting the Pistons' lead to 71-67 with 14.6 seconds remaining.\n\nThey finished up with another Hamilton free throw, taking Game 2, 72-67, and captured the series in six games. That was the prelude to a five-game series win over the Los Angeles Lakers, who had Kobe Bryant and Shaquille O'Neal.\n\nPrince's defensive play is often compared to LeBron James' chase-down block on Andre Iguodala in the 2016 NBA Finals against the Golden State Warriors. The situations are similar, in that they both came in close games in the fourth quarter that helped preserve the lead. The Cavs won Game 7 and captured the NBA title, so the stakes clearly were different."
