        "text": "Tayshaun Prince’s stay in Boston will be a brief one.\n\nAccording to Marc Stein of ESPN.com, the Celtics will be sending the veteran small forward to the Detroit Pistons in exchange for Jonas Jerebko and Luigi Datome.\n\nJerebko, 27, is a 6-foot-10 forward who is set to become an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season. He is averaging 5.2 points and 3.1 rebounds per game and earns $4.5 million. He is in his fifth NBA season, and is a former second-round draft pick.\n\nDatome is a 27-year-old small forward playing in his second NBA season. He’s only played in three games this season for Detroit, but is set to become an restricted free agent at the end of the season, meaning Boston will retain his rights, if they tender him a qualifying offer.\n\nPrince played the first 10 seasons of his career with the Pistons, winning a championship with the franchise in 2004, before he was traded away to Memphis during the 2012-13 season.\n\nIt was widely expected that Prince would ask to be bought out if he remained with the Celtics past the trade deadline on Thursday. Danny Ainge making this deal allows his staff to use the remainder of the season to check out a couple of younger prospects in Jerebko and Datome, without sacrificing any long-term salary flexibility."
