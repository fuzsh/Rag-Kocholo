        "text": "First order of business is a nod to Tayshaun Prince, who epitomized Detroit Pistons work ethic for 10 1/2 seasons, the entirety of his professional career, an NBA champion and a reliable iron man who rarely missed a game, and who will take all those traits to the Memphis Grizzlies after Prince was traded there Wednesday.\n\nThe Pistons will miss him, without question.\n\nAnd then they will continue moving toward the future, because that's what this trade was all about, bringing Jose Calderon and his expiring $10.5 million contract to Detroit, one essentially as important as the other. The Pistons might entertain thoughts of re-signing Calderon -- or Will Bynum, whose contract expires, but not both point guards -- and will benefit from his extraordinary court vision as long as he remains a Piston.\n\nAnd if that happens to be only about three dozen games, until this season ends and the Pistons embark on an offseason when they now will find themselves more than $30 million under the salary cap, so be it. That will be Calderon's contribution to the rebuilding process, to be the refuse man who picks up Prince's contract and hauls it to the dump.\n\nJoe Dumars said a deal that negatively affects cap flexibility is not on his agenda before the Feb. 21 NBA trade deadline, then made just the kind of move that proves as much, sending Prince and Austin Daye to Memphis in the three-team deal.\n\nThe Toronto Raptors send a second-round pick, Ed Davis and Calderon to Memphis for the centerpiece in the deal, Rudy Gay, and center Hamed Haddadi. Memphis, in turn, sends Calderon to Detroit for Prince and Daye.\n\nMemphis gets cap relief from Gay's massive contract and Prince presumably steps right into the starting role he vacates. Daye gets a new start, too.\n\nToronto gets one of the best small forwards in the league in Gay and positions itself for a playoff move with Boston hobbled by Rajon Rondo's injury.\n\nThe Pistons dump $15 million due to Prince over the next two seasons and clear up even more financial flexibility, while Daye was a throw-in, which is the value of having a player with an expiring contract when trying to rebuild. Bottom line, neither Prince nor Daye was part of the long-term Pistons future so now they're part of the team's past.\n\nCalderon probably isn't part of the future either but his expiring deal means the Pistons actually could go out and make a break-the-bank offer for, say, Chris Paul. Or they could try fitting a couple of splashy free agents, like both Josh Smith and O.J. Mayo, into next summer's plans. Or they could use some of that cap flexibility for another trade before Feb. 21.\n\nKyle Singler, who has bided his time playing out of position as a starting shooting guard, shifts into Prince's spot now. That much is certain.\n\nThe Pistons' four guards all will have played extensively at the point. Brandon Knight is the point guard they've been grooming but Calderon is a pure point, a high-assist playmaker who can make the Pistons' starting unit better with his court vision if they decide to move Knight to shooting guard. Bynum and Rodney Stuckey could be the backups, with plenty of mix-and-match potential.\n\nThe Pistons lost a veteran presence in Prince, who has struck gold as an NBA and Olympic champion. More important, they lost a piece of their history, because Prince was every bit as vital an element of that 2004 championship team as Ben Wallace or Rasheed Wallace up front, or Chauncey Billups or Richard Hamilton in the backcourt. His blocked shot against Reggie Miller in that year's Eastern Conference Finals is one of the legendary defensive plays in NBA history, his work against Kobe Bryant was central to blowing out the Los Angeles Lakers in the finals, and he came within one \"Big Shot Bob\" bomb from Robert Horry from winning a second title a year later.\n\nPrince leaves after 769 games as a Piston, fifth-most in franchise history. He ranks near the top of several key franchise statistics, including scoring (eighth, 9,838); assists (10th, 2,036); and 3-pointers (fifth, 499).\n\nBut the Pistons got better in the backcourt and Calderon is a leader anyway, at the most important leadership position in basketball. And they showed the value of an expiring contract by having Daye to sweeten the deal.\n\nThey might not be done, either. But as said often since the preseason, this year is little more than an 82-game exercise in patience until the spending decisions of next summer take hold.\n\nThe Pistons got involved an a high-profile trade before the deadline after all, and still didn't waver from that stance.\n\n--Download the Detroit Pistons on MLive app for iPhone and Android\n\n--Follow David Mayo on Twitter"
