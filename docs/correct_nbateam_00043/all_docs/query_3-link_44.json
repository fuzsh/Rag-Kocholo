        "text": "The Memphis Grizzlies made a front office move Saturday that could affect how they operate this offseason in a big way. According to a release from the team, the Grizzlies have promoted Tayshaun Prince to Vice President of Basketball Affairs.\n\n“We are excited to establish Tayshaun as a core member of our front office,” Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations Zachary Z. Kleinman said in a statement. “His knowledge of the game is exceptional and we are thrilled he will continue providing valuable contributions to the organization on a day-to-day basis.”\n\nAccording to the release, Prince will help ‘facilitate alignment between the front office, coaching staff and locker room and participate in the evaluation of professional, college and G League personnel.’ Prince joined the Memphis front office back in 2017 after his retirement.\n\nTayshaun Prince played 14 solid NBA seasons and was one of the premier wing defenders the league had to offer during his decade-plus tenure as a pro. Prince was named to the All-NBA Defense second team four times throughout his career and helped the Detroit Pistons capture a championship title in 2004.\n\nPrince played for the Pistons, Celtics, Timberwolves and Grizzlies during his career but has found a home in the Memphis front office upon retirement. The Grizzlies are trying desperately to turn things around after back-to-back disappointing seasons that left them on the outside looking in as far as the playoff picture goes."
