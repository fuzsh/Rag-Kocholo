Among his duties at EKU, Abner supported the basketball operations director, assisted in the management of all team practices and games, and assisted the coaching staff with scouting reports and basketball drills. Abner has also spent the last few summers working basketball camps at the University of Kentucky, Army-West Point Military Academy, and professional basketball player Tayshaun Prince’s summer basketball camp.\n\nIn 2010, Abner enlisted into the United States Navy and currently serves in the Navy Reserves.\n\nRuss and his wife Krista reside in Lexington, KY.\n\nThanks for visiting !\n\nThe use of software that blocks ads hinders our ability to serve you the content you came here to enjoy.\n\nWe ask that you consider turning off your ad blocker so we can deliver you the best experience possible while you are here.\n\nThank you for your support!"
