        "text": "Tayshaun Prince’s Basketball Camp is back this summer.\n\nThe annual event benefits Kicks for Kids and is designed to teach participants the basic skills of ball-handling, passing, scoring, rebounding, defense, and how to compete as a team player.\n\nThe Camp will include 18 hours of instruction by Prince, three-time team MVP at the University of Kentucky, and current forward for the Detroit Pistons where he won a championship in 2004. Joining Tayshaun is his staff, which includes top high school coaches, high school standout performers. Campers will receive individual photos with Tayshaun, and instructional DVD featuring the camper, Tayshaun and his staff; and participate in daily individual and team competitions with awards.\n\nAll proceeds from the camp help fund Kicks for Kids’ enrichment programs designed to benefit area youth. KFK is dedicated to leveling the playing field for children in the Greater Cincinnati and Northern Kentucky region who are challenged, physically or mentally, or who could not otherwise afford new chances and new experiences. KFK provides at-risk children with positive life experiences that foster and encourage confidence, self-worth and respect in one’s self. Through positive influences and\n\nself-discovery, KFK provides memories that will last a lifetime.\n\nCamp takes place in the Connor Convocation Center at Thomas More College in Crestview Hills and at local gymnasiums within 5 minutes of TMC. All transportation\n\nbetween venues will be provided for the campers. The 3 day camp is scheduled for August 3-5, 2015, from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Lunch will be provided daily to the campers. Admission is $100.00 per camper. Register on-line at http://tpbasketballcamp.eventzilla.net/\n\nAdditionally, for $100.00 anyone can eat lunch with Taysaun from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. on any of the camp days. The cost gets you lunch with Tayshaun, an autographed basketball, and the money sponsors a child to go to camp.\n\nFor more information about the basketball camp,sponsorships, or lunch with Tayshaun please contact Christine Sebastian at 859-331-8484 or chris.sebastian@kicksforkids.org.\n\n-Staff report"
