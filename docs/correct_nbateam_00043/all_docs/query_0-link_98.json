        "text": "Tayshaun Prince earned a spot on the USA Basketball team for the Beijing Games, a person in the NBA told The Associated Press on Thursday.\n\nThe person spoke Thursday on the condition of anonymity because the roster will be announced Monday during a news conference in Chicago.\n\nLast year, Prince played for a U.S. team that was led by Kobe Bryant, LeBron James and Carmelo Anthony during an unbeaten run in an Olympic qualifying tournament.\n\nEarlier this month, USA Basketball managing director Jerry Colangelo said the squad would be selected without a tryout.\n\nAlso Thursday, the Arizona Republic reported that Suns forward Amare Stoudamire has declined a chance to be on the Olympic squad. Colangelo told the newspaper that Stoudemire was concerned about pushing his body too hard after knee surgery in 2005 and 2006.\n\nThe 6-foot-9, 215-pound Prince gives the U.S. team a playoff-tested player who can slow down opponents with his defensive skills. He can also score occasionally with an array of runners and spin moves around the lane.\n\nPrince helped the Detroit Pistons advance to the Eastern Conference finals for the sixth straight year, making them the most consistent in the playoffs since the Los Angeles Lakers of the 1980s.\n\nHe has played in 114 playoff games to surpass the total of any player his first six NBA seasons.\n\nPistons teammate Chauncey Billups pulled himself out of consideration for a spot on the U.S. team earlier this week. The All-Star point guard might have had a hard time making the team anyway because of available guards such as Jason Kidd, Dwyane Wade, Chris Paul and Deron Williams."
