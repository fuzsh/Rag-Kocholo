        "text": "Being a part of that 2012-13 Grizzlies team gave him insight into what it is like being a young player in the playoffs on the Timberwolves now. Conley said he didn’t receive any sage advice in the playoffs with Memphis like he is able to give now. “The majority of us were young in 2013,” Conley said. “Tayshaun Prince was probably the only vet we had that was older. Looking back at it, you could have told me we were going to be back the next year and the year after that. We were only going to get better from there. “But you never know what happens. We’re fired our coach. We got a new coach. Guys got traded. Guys got signed. Guys got hurt. Seizing the moment is real.”\n\nDuring a recent interview on “All the Smoke,” a podcast series hosted by former NBA players Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson, Rasheed Wallace said if he had to choose four of his former teammates to play with under any of his former coaches, he’d pick the Pistons’ popular starting five — Chauncey Billups, Richard “Rip” Hamilton, Tayshaun Prince, himself and Ben Wallace, along with head coach Larry Brown.\n\n“That’s an unfair question. I’mma be biased for sure. Best five alive. The best five alive and that coach is pound-for-pound, Larry Brown,” Wallace said at the 59:35 mark of the interview. “The best five alive: Chauncey, Rip, Tay, myself and Ben. And there’s no disrespect to any of my other teammates cause they’re my brethren, but I think we felt as though we were at the pinnacle of our craft right there and couldn’t nobody in the world touch us. That’s why we coined ourselves, nicknamed ourselves the ‘Best Five Alive,’ cause we felt we were that tight-knit.”\n\nBarnes also asked Wallace which jersey would be on a statue honoring his career between the Pistons or Blazers. Wallace, again, chose the city of Detroit. “It would probably be Detroit,” he said. “What we did there, offense and defense, s— …We all were misfits in one way or another. Me, Chauncey, Rip, Ben. The only one that was natural on that team was Tay because that was the team that drafted him, but we all were somehow or someway misfits over there, so I would think it’s Detroit. Just with the love and effect of the city. It was awesome.”\n\nOne source said that the Lakers took only one proposed trade that summer to Bryant to gauge his willingness to waive the no-trade clause he possessed … to Detroit rather than Dallas. Bryant vetoed the trade to the Pistons headlined by Rip Hamilton and Tayshaun Prince instantly and wound up reporting to training camp when the Lakers, in circumstances reminiscent of Brooklyn’s now, stopped looking for trades. Bryant ultimately had his concerns about the Lakers’ ability to content post-Shaquille O’Neal assuaged when L.A. managed halfway through the season to acquire Pau Gasol from Memphis.\n\nHaving had the opportunity to go up against two of the greatest to ever do it, Tayshaun Prince has now revealed the major difference in defending Kobe and LeBron (h/t Advait Jajodia of The Sports Rush): “They’re both different,” Prince said. “… With a Kobe it was a matter of don’t let him get to a sweet spot. He’s gonna be physical with you, he’s gonna try to wear you down, so once the fourth quarter comes he would get to those spots and everything else is butter. “With LeBron, it was a matter of, you gotta fight through 150 pick and rolls throughout the whole game.”"
