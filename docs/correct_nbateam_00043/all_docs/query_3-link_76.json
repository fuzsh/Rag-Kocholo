        "text": "— J.P. Prince takes charges, steals balls, gets his fellow Volunteers involved in the offense and plays defense.\n\nIn short, the senior guard does everything for Tennessee.\n\nTo gauge Tennessee’s chances of winning a particular game just check the stat monitor and see how many points Prince has. The Vols head into their Midwest Regional semifinal Friday night against Ohio State in St. Louis having won the past nine games when Prince scores 10 or more points - they’re 0-3 when he doesn’t.\n\nTennessee Coach Bruce Pearl said Prince’s value to the Vols is obvious and called him a real key to their season. But he also thinks the senior has become more assertive.\n\n“He’s just a good all-around player. He creates possessions for you defensively with taking charges and getting deflections and getting steals. J.P. makes a lot happen, and he’s one of the guys, J.P. can look at me and say, ‘Coach, I got this. I got this.’ And most of the time, he does,” Pearl said.\n\nThis was expected when Prince came out of White Station High School in Memphis having led that team to three consecutive state titles. He had been the 2005 Class AAA Mr. Basketball and was the Gatorade Tennessee Player of the Year.\n\nBasketball runs in his family. His father, John, played at Southern Mississippi and coached in the college ranks, including a job as Jackson State’s head coach. His cousin is Tayshaun Prince of the NBA’s Detroit Pistons.\n\nHe started college at Arizona and transferred back to Tennessee three games into the 2006-2007 season after a difficult year that included him being placed in a medically induced coma becauseof problems after having his wisdom teeth removed. He had reconstructive surgery on his right shoulder last April.\n\nPrince began the season as a starter but struggled enough that Pearl put him on the bench for six consecutive games. Prince started feeling better and got back into the starting lineup Dec. 31 at Memphis and hasn’t been out since.\n\nHe scored at least 10 points 18 times for Tennessee this season and has had at least six rebounds in 12 games. During the NCAA Tournament, he has led the Vols in points with 16.5 points per game and minutes with 28 per game. He’s averaging 66.7 percent shooting from the floor during the tournament as well.\n\n“His shooting percentage is good because he gets a lot of stuff around the basket,” Pearl said. “He doesn’t take many threes, but he’s made just enough in big situations you don’t go, ‘Oh!’ every time he shoots it. ... He makes good decisions.”\n\nThe Vols’ next challenge will be finding a way to slow down Evan Turner, Ohio State’s top scorer averaging 20 points per game. Pearl will use a defense by committee approach, but Prince likely will be the Tennessee player who gets the most time guarding Turner.\n\nTennessee guard Bobby Maze said all the Vols can defend but that Prince’s size, wingspan and agility with his feet allow him to shut down anybody in the country. Asked if that includes Turner, Maze didn’t back down.\n\n“Anybody in the country,” Maze said.\n\nPearl said Prince gives the Vols a chance to compete at that position. Prince is ready to do whatever his coaches ask of him.\n\n“If they didn’t think I could do it, they wouldn’t put me in that position,” Prince said."
