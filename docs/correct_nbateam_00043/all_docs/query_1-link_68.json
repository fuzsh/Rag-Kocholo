        "text": "That's a sign that DBB reader Monday made for last year's playoff series (during which this commercial was seemingly on a constant loop), and after LeBron's performance in Game 1, I think it's especially appropriate. Fortunately for LeBron, he won't always have to be going up against Tayshaun Prince -- at least for the summer, the two will actually be teammates. From the Detroit Free Press:\n\nPistons forward Tayshaun Prince will be added to USA Basketball's summer roster, according to the Associated Press.\n\nManaging director Jerry Colangelo is set to announce several additions today in Las Vegas, where the Americans will train and compete this summer in the FIBA Americas tournament.\n\nGreg Oden and Kevin Durant also will be in camp in July with a chance to make the roster for the Olympic qualifier that runs Aug. 22-Sept. 2.\n\nThe new additions join 17 players eligible to participate from last year's original pool, including Pistons guard Chauncey Billups and Shane Battier (Birmingham Detroit Country Day)."
