        "text": "COMPTON — NBA champions Tyson Chandler and Tayshaun Prince made history Friday as the first two players to have their basketball jerseys retired at Dominguez High School.\n\n“It’s a great experience, but I think the most important thing is letting everybody else know what they meant and why my name is going up there,” Prince said after the halftime jersey retirement ceremony. “It’s not about me, it’s about the people that were in my life, that’s why when I was talking I made that important for people to know because it takes a village to make it happen and that’s what happened here in Compton.\n\n“(I want to) inspire people with my message and how you can be great and how this could happen to you and it can happen to you by believing in what your abilities are and also having the support system to get it done.”\n\nPrince, who wore number 21, and Chandler, who wore number 32, played together during the 1997-98 season at Dominguez when Prince was a senior and Chandler was a freshman. The duo, who both individually went on to win NBA championships and Olympic gold medals, helped lead Dominguez to a 1998 CIF title.\n\nChandler, 40, was drafted directly out of Dominguez as a two-time California Mr. Basketball and a McDonald’s All-American. He was the No. 2 overall pick in the 2001 NBA Draft by the Clippers, who immediately traded his draft rights to the Chicago Bulls.\n\nThe 7-foot center’s professional career was highlighted by winning the 2011 NBA championship with the Dallas Mavericks, being named the 2012 NBA Defensive Player of the Year and winning a gold medal with the U.S. men’s basketball team in the 2012 London Olympics.\n\n“I want to thank everybody for coming out from the bottom of my heart. This is a really special moment,” Chandler told the crowd that was full of his friends, family, former teammates, coaches and teachers. “I feel like it’s not just a celebration for me and Tayshaun, but it’s a celebration for everybody. I feel like we made it.”\n\nPrince, 42, graduated from Dominguez as California Mr. Basketball and a McDonald’s All-American in 1998. He went on to play college basketball at the University of Kentucky and won the 2004 NBA championship with the Detroit Pistons and a gold medal with the U.S. in the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\nThe 6-foot-9 forward was also named to the NBA’s All-Defensive Second Team for four straight years and is currently working in the Memphis Grizzlies’ front office as a Vice President of Basketball Affairs.\n\nBefore the game Friday, Prince gave an inspirational speech to the Dominguez boys basketball team about what it takes to achieve greatness while growing up in Compton.\n\n“The most important thing I want to tell you guys is, whether it’s basketball or whatever it may be, first off have that vision to be great,” he said. “Have that vision to be great. What’s happening to me today is because I had a vision from day one to be great. I had obstacles along the way, ups and downs, (it’s) how you get back up after you get knocked down. Every time you go out there and perform, you’re not going to have your best game. You look at NBA guys, they don’t have their best game, but what are you going to do after that, what are you going to do after you have that bad performance. Throughout my career, I always approached it if I had a bad game, what am I going to do next.”\n\nChandler also addressed the team before the game. He told the players that high school will end up being some of the best times in their lives, so he implored Dominguez’s current players to not take anything for granted.\n\n“Don’t take any of these moments for granted, Chandler said. “Every single time that you get an opportunity to lace them up with your brothers, because that’s what it is, these guys are going to be your brothers for life. The things that you guys go through together are what make your bond. Literally, don’t take any of these moments (for granted) because you’re going to think about this some years from now because you’ll never have this again.”\n\nDominguez (13-9, 2-3) took those messages to heart and fought through adversity.\n\nThe Dons trailed 39-32 at halftime but capped off Chandler’s and Prince’s retirement ceremony with a second-half rally for a 59-58 comeback win at home against Downey (21-3, 3-2).\n\nDominguez senior forward Isaac Sowell finished with a game-high 23 points and 21 rebounds. Senior guard Eric Banks Jr. added 15 points, while senior guard Aaron Butler made what ended up being the game-winning shot with four seconds remaining in the game.\n\nTayshaun Prince’s basketball accolades:\n\n4-time CIF Champion (1995, 1996, 1997, 1998)\n\n2-time State Champion (1996, 1997)\n\nMcDonald’s All-American (1998)\n\nCalifornia Mr. Basketball (1998)\n\nSEC Player of the Year (Kentucky, 2001)\n\nNBA Champion (Detroit Pistons, 2004)\n\nOlympic Gold Medalist (Beijing, 2008)\n\nTyson Chandler’s basketball accolades:"
