        "text": "The Detroit Pistons are making some big changes after an ugly 14-68 season under first-year head coach Monty Williams. The Eastern Conference franchise could be looking at bringing a popular player back home.\n\nDetroit has a general manager spot to fill with former Duke standout Trajan Langdon was just named President of Basketball Operations. Former Kentucky standout Tayshaun Prince was named as a potential candidate for the opening.\n\nThe Athletic‘s Shams Charania and James L. Edwards III had the current Vice President of Basketball Affairs for the Memphis Grizzlies listed as a candidate to replace Troy Weaver in Detroit and serve as Langdon’s No. 2 in the Detroit front office.\n\nThe third-team All-American and first-round pick in 2002 spent 11 seasons playing for the Detroit Pistons winning an NBA championship in 2004, and was a four-time NBA All-Defensive Team performer from 2005-08. Tayshaun Prince then spent some time with the Memphis Grizzlies and Boston Celtics before returning to Detroit. Prince retired following the 2016 season and joined the Grizzlies front office in 2017.\n\nTayshaun Prince has been promoted once and has spent seven seasons with the Memphis front office. Now could be the time for him to make the jump to the general manager chair. A return to Detroit could be coming soon for the 44-year-old who has been working in the NBA for over 20 years.\n\nMore Kentucky News and Views on the KSR YouTube Channel"
