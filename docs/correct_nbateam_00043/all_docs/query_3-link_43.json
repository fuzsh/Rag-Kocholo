        "text": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. — The Memphis Grizzlies today promoted Tayshaun Prince to Vice President of Basketball Affairs within the franchise’s basketball operations department.\n\n“We are excited to establish Tayshaun as a core member of our front office,” Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations Zachary Z. Kleiman said. “His knowledge of the game is exceptional and we are thrilled he will continue providing valuable contributions to the organization on a day-to-day basis.”\n\nIn his enhanced role, Prince will, among other responsibilities, facilitate alignment between the front office, coaching staff and locker room and participate in the evaluation of professional, college and G League personnel.\n\nPrince joined the Grizzlies’ front office in 2017 as Special Advisor to the General Manager following a 14-year NBA career in which he captured an NBA championship with the Detroit Pistons in 2004 and helped guide the 2012-13 Grizzlies to the franchise’s first Western Conference Finals."
