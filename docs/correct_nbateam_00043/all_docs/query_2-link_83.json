        "text": "Stan Van Gundy has a good poker face.\n\nMoments after appearing nonchalant about trade-deadline prospects following practice today, the first-year Pistons coach and president acquired promising young point guard Reggie Jackson from the Oklahoma City Thunder and former Pistons standout Tayshaun Prince for the Boston Celtics.\n\nStarting point guard D.J. Augustin and starting small forward Kyle Singler are headed to Oklahoma City to try to help the Thunder make a playoff push.\n\nAnd stretch power forward Jonas Jerebko and small forward Luigi Datome are headed to Boston to bring Prince back to the franchise that drafted him as a skinny senior from Kentucky in 2002.\n\n• Live updates: Pistons, NBA rumor mill\n\n• NBA trade deadline tracker\n\nThere was a report from CSNNE.com that Prince could push for a buyout to join a contender.\n\nBut a league source told the Free Press that Prince will remain with the Pistons for the rest of the final season of the four-year, $27-million contract he signed with the Pistons shortly after the 2011 lockout.\n\nPrince's return will dominate local headlines, but the main move is the acquisition of Jackson.\n\nThe Pistons made the Jackson news official almost 5 hours after Thursday's 3 p.m. deadline.\n\n\"We're pleased to welcome Reggie Jackson to the organization,\" Van Gundy said in a release. \"Reggie is a young player with good size and length at the guard position.\n\n\"He's been successful as a starter playing extended minutes, and we feel he's a good addition to our roster. We thank both D.J. Augustin and Kyle Singler for their contributions and wish them well moving forward.\"\n\nThe Jackson acquisition is part of a three-team deal that also sends a 2019 second-rounder to the Thunder and a 2017 second-rounder to the Utah Jazz.\n\nBut it appears the price wasn't too steep — although the Pistons gave up their starting point guard who was playing at a high level in Augustin. And Singler was the team's best outside shooter. And Van Gundy said the other day that second-rounders could be valuable when it comes to make deal — like today.\n\nBut Van Gundy has made no secret of his preference for size at all positions — Jackson is 6-feet-3, Augustin 6 feet.\n\nJackson, 24, has excelled when given starting opportunities when Thunder star Russell Westbrook has been sidelined because of injuries. Jackson also proved valuable for the Thunder in the playoffs last season.\n\nA restricted free agent this summer, he has been itching for a chance to prove he can be an upper-echelon point guard.\n\nReports suggest Jackson wants a contract around $14 million per season. Since the Pistons have acquired his Bird Rights, a collective bargaining agreement mechanism that allows teams to go over the salary cap to sign their own free agents, price shouldn't be a problem — if the Pistons deem he is worth the commitment.\n\nIn 49 games as a starter over his career, Jackson has posted averages of 14.2 points, 6.4 assists and 2.5 rebounds while shooting 36.8% from three-point range.\n\nThe official announcement for Prince came about an hour after Jackson.\n\n\"Tayshaun Prince is certainly well known to fans in Detroit and we're pleased to welcome him back,\" Van Gundy said in a release. \"He fills a position of need for us at small forward with his offensive and defensive versatility. We thank both Jonas and Gigi for their hard work and wish them well going forward.\"\n\nPrince returns to Detroit, where he earned a 2004 championship ring as the starting small forward.\n\nHe ranks fifth all-time in franchise history in games played (769), fifth in three-point field goals made (499) and seventh in blocks (440).\n\nHe also was a member of the U.S. national team that went 8-0 to win the gold medal at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. The Pistons traded him to Memphis in January 2013 and the Grizzlies sent him to Boston earlier this season.\n\nContact Vince Ellis: vellis@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter @vincent_ellis56.\n\nBy the numbers\n\nReggie Jackson spent the first month of the season starting for the Thunder in place of an injured Russell Westbrook. But once Westbrook returned, Jackson's numbers plummeted. His averages by month:"
