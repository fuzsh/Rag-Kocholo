        "text": "The Detroit Pistons can go in several directions with their search for a general manager.\n\nAnd depending on the path they choose, it could set up a reunion with Tayshaun Prince — if the former Piston is open to a return.\n\nPrince is on the Pistons’ list of candidates for assistant general manager, a league source told the Free Press on Wednesday evening. Prince, who has been with the Memphis Grizzlies’ front office since 2017, fits what the Pistons are hoping to accomplish with the hire.\n\nDetroit is looking to add an experienced candidate for its GM position, and an up-and-coming executive for the assistant opening. Former assistant manager Malik Rose departed the position for a job with the NBA earlier this week.\n\nThe league source said the Pistons could opt to hire one of the two positions, or even two assistant general managers. It largely depends on how comfortable the Pistons feel with the candidates. But as of now, hiring one of each position is the primary goal.\n\nPrince, who was drafted by the Pistons in 2002 and spent 12 seasons with the franchise, was hired by the Grizzlies as special assistant to then-general manager Chris Wallace in 2016. A year ago, he was promoted to vice president of basketball affairs.\n\nHe’s been a jack-of-all-trades for the Grizzlies, serving as a connective tissue between the front office, coaches and players while also working with the scouting department. He checks the box as a young executive who can eventually become a GM.\n\nThe Pistons have not reached out to the Grizzlies to ask for permission to interview Prince, but that could happen down the road. The team is planning to fill its GM position before starting the search for an assistant.\n\nWhen senior advisor Ed Stefanski was hired in 2018, his goal was to hire a general manager. Stefanski ended up fulfilling the general manager responsibilities himself for two seasons.\n\nSo why does Stefanski want to hire a general manager now? For the first time since he was hired, the Pistons have cap flexibility. The new GM, who will likely report to Stefanski, will be able to help re-mold the roster now that Reggie Jackson and Andre Drummond’s big contracts are off the books.\n\nThe Pistons will likely have a high lottery pick and potentially more than $30 million in cap space."
