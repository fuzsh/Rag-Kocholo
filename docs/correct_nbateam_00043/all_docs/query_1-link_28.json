        "text": "In a bit of a surprise, Chauncey Billups isn’t the former Detroit Pistons player linked to the organization’s front-office restructuring.\n\nWith the hiring of Ed Stefanski to a senior executive role, the rumor mill is focused on Tayshaun Prince, who has spent one season working alongside Stefanski with the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nStefanski said he hadn’t yet spoken with Prince about a role with the Pistons, but a source with firsthand knowledge of the situation told the Free Press that Prince is under consideration for a spot in the front office.\n\nSuch news isn’t surprising to one of Prince’s former teammates.\n\n“Tayshaun is one of those guys that’s flying under the radar, but his basketball I.Q. is incredibly high,” former Pistons defensive stalwart Ben Wallace told the Free Press on Thursday.\n\n“He’s been in the business for a year or so; it definitely shows he’s willing to take the job seriously. He’s proven he can do it.”\n\nPrince, who is special assistant to Grizzlies general manager Chris Wallace, fits the profile of what Stefanski and Pistons ownership are seeking in a new front office.\n\nThe Pistons are seeking a young, rising executive to learn the ropes under Stefanski. They are hoping to unearth the next Danny Ainge, who was in his mid-40s when the Boston Celtics hired him as team president in 2003.\n\nPrince is unlikely for that role.\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets’ Trajan Langdon started his front-office career in 2012 and could fit the bill as a person who can become the face of the franchise.\n\nThe Pistons are seeking to hire similar rising talents throughout the front office, and Prince could emerge in the coming days after the franchise settles on a team president/general manager and head coach.\n\n“I definitely think he’s a guy the Pistons should also consider and give a shot to,” Wallace said of his former teammate. “Tayshaun is one of those guys that wasn’t a big rah-rah player, but he got the job done and he understood the game of basketball.”\n\nMore: Detroit Pistons have foundation for instant success, says Ed Stefanski\n\nFirst step\n\nBefore the franchise moves forward, Stefanski will look to assess who could remain among the group Stan Van Gundy brought to town in 2014. Van Gundy was fired earlier this month as team president and head coach.\n\nGeneral manager Jeff Bower currently is running the franchise and will help prepare the team for the NBA draft on June 21.\n\nStefanski is resisting the urge to completely clean house and is open to bringing back some members of the Van Gundy front office.\n\nAfter the Memorial Day weekend, Stefanski plans to meet with Bower and others beginning Tuesday.\n\n“I'm going to spend a lot of time with Jeff Bower because I’ve known him for years,” Stefanski said. “I respect him and I want to find out what he thinks of the situation there. He's been there for four years, and he's been right at the pulse of everything.”\n\nIn examining the situation, it could be hard to find a path forward with Bower.\n\nStefanski settles into the experienced hand role in the front office, so there could be duplication if Bower, who has 20-plus years of NBA experience, is retained.\n\nAssistant general manager Pat Garrity, who is well regarded, could find a role in the next front office.\n\nCiting an unnamed source, ESPN.com’s Adrian Wojnarowski reported former Toronto Raptors coach Dwane Casey is the top candidate for the coaching position.\n\nA source told the Free Press that Casey is one of several candidates under consideration, and his success with the Raptors could lead the search in his direction.\n\nInterviews for both spots continued this week, although two sources said the Pistons had yet to contact Casey as of Thursday, although that’s expected soon.\n\nThe likely timetable remains hiring a president/general manager first.\n\nMore: Report: Dwane Casey top candidate to be Detroit Pistons coach\n\nToo many cooks?\n\nPistons vice chairman Arn Tellem has known Stefanski for a long time.\n\nTellem, once a high-powered agent, developed a relationship with the long-time NBA executive over the last couple of decades.\n\nTellem was part of the team that identified Stefanski.\n\nThe duo — along with ownership rep Bob Wentworth — will pick the front-office leader and head coach.\n\nStefanski expects the front office to lean on Tellem in the future.\n\n“He’ll be available to the front office,” Stefanski said. “I don’t know how much because he’s doing a lot on the business side, but what a resource when you are able to strategically talk with your front office people on what deals can be made and then run them by Arn. You’ll find out what the other side may be thinking, what makes sense. He’s an expert on the cap. I think it helps when you want to make that decision. You won’t jump in there and make a mistake that he could see right away.”\n\nVan Gundy's front office drew criticism for cap mismanagement and snap decisions, and the ownership group has identified the one-voice direction of Van Gundy as a weakness.\n\nBut there are many potential voices.\n\nYou have Tellem.\n\nYou have Stefanski, who left the Grizzlies to take an active role in rebuilding a front office.\n\nAnd you have the new president/GM.\n\nStefanski doesn’t see the issue. All opinions are welcome.\n\n“My personality is I'm collaborative,” Stefanski said. “I know you have to make decisions so I will have to make some decisions and recommendations to (Pistons owner Tom Gores), but I gotta gather all the information.”\n\nFollow Vince Ellis on Twitter @vincent_ellis56.
