The Pistons have not ruled out Tayshaun Prince as a candidate for a front office role, according to Omari Sankofa II of the Detroit Free Press.

Per the report, no interview has taken place yet, but if Prince is interested in an assistant GM job and available to interview, he’ll be a candidate for it. Prince is the VP of Basketball Affairs with the Grizzlies, so it would likely be a promotion on a team got him to an NBA title.

Rasheed Wallace will get starts in place of both Mehmet Okur and Tayshaun Prince, coach Larry Brown said yesterday.

“I don’t want to get caught up in starting lineups,” Brown said. “Memo is going to start some and Tayshaun is going to start some. I’ve never don’t that before. I like to keep it consistent. But for the time being, this is the way we’re going to go.” Prince doesn’t have much fantasy value with Wallace taking playing time away from him.

Coach Larry Brown has called out Tayshaun Prince for, among other things, lack of defensive effort.

“I am going to start treating Tayshaun like a young guy instead of him thinking he’s a vet,” Brown said. “He’s going to start coming over on the first bus and be treated like a rookie now. I think we’ve taken for granted that he’s played a lot and I don’t want to do that. We can’t have him just being out there.” Prince and Brown had an animated discussion on the bench Monday. Brown yelled at Prince to start demanding the ball. Prince yelled back, saying that it wasn’t his job to tell veteran players to pass him the ball. With Richard Hamilton out, Prince is expected to start at shooting guard with Corliss Williamson entering the lineup at small forward.

Tayshaun Prince continued his strong play on Sunday, leading a balanced attack as the Pistons eliminated the Cavaliers with a dominating second-half performance.

He led the Pistons with 20 points and added seven boards, three assists and a three-pointer in the win, and was the best player for the Pistons in this series. This game was close until the third quarter, which saw LeBron James score just one point. The Pistons outshot the Cavs 43% to 31% in the win, and shut down the Cavaliers’ offense in the second half.

Steve Nash and Shawn Marion are the only two players still in the playoffs who have logged more minutes than Tayshaun Prince this postseason.

Prince is playing like an all-star right now, but the Pistons are just hopeful he doesn’t tire out for the Finals, like he did last year. “The one guy that didn’t make the All-Star team is the one guy that’s definitely playing like an All-Star,” coach Flip Saunders said. Prince has scored at least 20 points in six straight playoff games.

Tayshaun Prince had 15 points, four boards and three assists on 6-of-16 shooting in Monday’s loss to the Heat.

This was much better than his 1-of-7 performance in Game 3, but the Pistons allowed the Heat to shoot nearly 60% and now have their backs up against the wall, down 3-1. Game 5 is Wednesday in Detroit, and many analysts are saying the Heat will wrap up the series in that game. While it’s too early to count the Pistons out, this doesn’t look good for Detroit.
