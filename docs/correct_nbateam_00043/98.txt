Former Kentucky Wildcats star Tayshaun Prince is now an NBA front-office guru.

After a 14-year NBA career that saw him win the NBA Finals with the Detroit Pistons and earn four NBA All-Defensive Team honors, Prince is now the Vice President of Basketball Affairs for the Memphis Grizzlies whom he played for from 2013-15.

The 40-year old is seen as an up and comer in the NBA front office field and has come up in rumors discussing the Pistons general manager opening.

Despite his name being linked to his former squad, ESPN NBA Reporter Eric Woodyard reports the Pistons have not yet sought permission from Memphis to interview Prince. He also reports that Prince was not on Detroitâ€™s original interview list.

Prince spent parts of 11 seasons in Detroit. At. Kentucky, he was named SEC Player of the Year in 2001 after 16.9 points per game with 2.9 assists and 6.5 rebounds.

Earlier this week, The Detroit Free Press made the case for Prince being a great GM candidate for the Pistons.

Prince, whose 14-year NBA career ended in 2016, was able to quiz candidates on their knowledge of the game and ability to process information on the fly. His feedback was valuable.

Prince had no front office experience when the Grizzlies hired him in 2017. Since then, he has established himself as one of the stronger voices in the organization. He lends credibility to an analytics-driven front office led by two former lawyers.

The 40-year-old has added to the reputation he built as a player as being intelligent, reliable and eager to make connections.
