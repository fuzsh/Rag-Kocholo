Prem,

It looks like your tape are not even 60% utilized which would mean reclamation would not run. Either you have to set reclamation very low or do some 'move data' commands on tape that might fit together.

When you query volumes in a stgpool, they will show how much they are utilized. If you see any that say 'empty' you could delete them and they will be scratch. If reclamation runs for a long time, it will leave the tapes in empty status until the reclamation job completes. If you need them immediately, you could either delete them manually or cancel the reclamation job and start it over. As the job finishes, it release all of the empty tapes.

Q vol stgp=xxxx

If you show some tapes in the pool as only partially full and in filling status, you could do the 'move' data command. This will only move data onto another volume within the same stgpool. It helps to consolidate the tapes though and will free up some tapes.

Move data volume_name

This is another concern regarding your stgpool: Delay Period for Volume Reuse: 3 Day(s)

Everyone has different reasons for using this and it may be of value in not wanting your tapes used again immediately after being scratched. I have never found value in this myself and have in too many situations with small tape libraries so I set this to 0. If you have a large library and lots of tapes and space for tapes, you can get by with having a delay. If you have a small library and are cramped for space, you are just creating a delay for tapes to be reused again. I would be curious how many tapes are in your library that are empty but have not met this 3 day criteria. You should be able to see this by doing 'q vol stgp=* status=empty'

I hope these tips help some.
