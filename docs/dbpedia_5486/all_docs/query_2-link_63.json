        "text": "If your child has had a cut, their wound may need to be either stitched (sutured) or glued.\n\nThere are many different stitch types and techniques. Sometimes dissolvable stitches are used, and sometimes stiches that need to be removed are used. Your doctor will advise you if your child has stitches that need to be removed.\n\nA special glue (e.g. Dermabond) is another type of treatment used in hospitals and medical clinics to keep the edges of the skin together. It has the same effect as stitches, and only takes about a minute to apply and dry. The glue is transparent so you can see the wound.\n\nCare at home\n\nYour child's cut will be red, tender and swollen straight after stitching or gluing. These symptoms should clear as the wound starts to heal (after about two to three days).\n\nYour child may need some simple pain relief (such as paracetamol) in the first couple of days following an injury. Speak to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist, or see our fact sheet Pain relief for children.\n\nAll wounds, whether stitched or glued, will leave a scar. Initially the scar may be red or purple in colour, and will fade to light pink, white or nearly invisible over time. This may take up to a year.\n\nIt’s important to protect your child's wound from the sun by keeping it covered. To prevent the scar from darkening, use sunscreen on the healed wound for at least 12 months.\n\nStitches\n\nTake care not to get the wound wet for at least five days. Keeping the wound dry will allow the skin to come together and start the healing process.\n\nDo not let your child go swimming until after the stitches have been removed and the wound is healed.\n\nTry not to let your child pick any scabs, crusts or dressings from the wound area. They will come away on their own, once the wound has completely healed.\n\nIf the stitches come out and the wound is open (gaping) or it has been less than 48 hours since the wound has been stitched, see your GP or go to your nearest hospital emergency department.\n\nDissolvable stitches\n\nYour doctor will tell you if your child has dissolvable stitches.\n\nDissolvable stitches disappear by themselves and do not need to be removed. This may take up to two weeks, or longer in some cases.\n\nIt is important to not get the wound wet for at least five days.\n\nGlue\n\nKeep the wound dry. Your child may have a shower or a brief bath after 24 hours, but do not soak or scrub the wound until it has fully healed. Pat the wound dry with a towel after a shower or bath.\n\nDo not let your child go swimming or have a soak in the bath for seven days.\n\nDo not let your child rub, scratch or pick at the glue or the wound. If adhesive tape (e.g. Steri-Strips) has been applied over the glue, allow it to fall off naturally. Do not pick it off as this may cause the wound to open. The glue may take up to three weeks to completely fall off your child's wound.\n\nDo not use creams or ointments over the glue or near the adhesive tape. This may cause the glue to soften and come off.\n\nWhen to see a doctor\n\nTake your child to see your GP if there are signs the wound is becoming infected. These include:\n\nthe wound becomes more swollen or red around the edges and the redness spreads to the surrounding skin or is hot to the touch\n\nyour child develops a fever\n\nthe wound smells or there is pus (this is usually yellow or green in colour).\n\nAlso see a GP if:\n\nthe glue has come off or a stitch/stitches fall out and the wound is open (gaping) or bleeding\n\nyou are worried for any reason.\n\nIf your child’s stitches are not dissolvable, you will need to make an appointment to see your GP to get the stitches removed (an appointment may have been made when the stiches were put in). Your emergency doctor or nurse will advise you when to do this. The time for removal of stitches varies depending on where on the body they are, but it is usually between five to 10 days. It is important to get your child's stitches taken out on the correct day, as leaving them in for longer may lead to unnecessary scarring.\n\nKey points to remember\n\nKeep the wound dry for five days, and protect the wound from the sun.\n\nDo not allow your child to pick or scratch at the stitches/glue or dressings.\n\nTake your child to the GP if the wound becomes more red or swollen, if it smells or there is pus.\n\nTake your child to the GP if a stitch falls out and the wound is bleeding or open.\n\nSee your GP to get the stitches removed (unless other arrangements have been made) in the time specified.\n\nFor more information\n\nKids Health Info fact sheet: Pain relief for children\n\nKids Health Info fact sheet: Fever in children\n\nDeveloped by The Royal Children's Hospital Emergency department.
