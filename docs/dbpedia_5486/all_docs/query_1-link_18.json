        "text": "It would depend on what type of finish is on the furniture. If it is an enamel, some kind of solid material laminate or polyurethane finish, then you're most likely golden! You can just use a product like \"goof off\" or \"goo gone\" and that will take it off nicely and won't harm a typical polyurethane finish. Now, that said, I would still test a spot to make sure it won't harm the finish in case it is actually some other polymer.\n\nIf it is a more traditional finish, you could try these, but there is a good change of disrupting at least the finish if not the stain as well. If you are really careful you can keep that damage to a minimum or possibly if you lightly dab for some timeframe around forever, maybe not even at all. But again, test it first! You never know, you might find it is compatible with whatever other finish type was used. But always test in some non-obvious place. Also, if you do damage the finish, sometimes you can repair that with various \"refinishing\" products that you can find at your local hardware store. Incidentally, you can also find \"Goof Off\" and \"Goo Gone\" at a typical hardware store as well.\n\nGood Luck!\n\nOne of my favourite methods removing glue residue from tapes is using another tape. It involves no solvents and thus cannot harm varnish.\n\nI use to take some piece of tape, place it over the glue residue and pull it off. sometimes it is better to pull it fast, if the residue is rather hard. If the residue is soft, pulling gently may be better. I made the experience, that it doesn't make a big difference if you rub the tape onto the residue, or not. But the outcome may vary. You will have to do this several times, depending on the age of the residue.\n\nI prefer to use duct tape, because its glue is soft and thick which lets it grab even irregularily shaped glue residuebut other tapes may work, too. Beware of cheap tapes as they sometimes loose their glue, worsening the situation.\n\nA piece of tape may be used several times depending on its type and amount of dust on the surfaces.\n\nIf that doesn't help you can still try cleaners based on orange oil. Those have removed any tape residue I met! But be aware that orange oil is a powerful solvent, so test it on a covert spot. A brand available in a typical \"Bioladen\" is \"AlmaWin\"\n\nI recommend soaking the offending tape in any of the following: (in order of weakest to strongest) methanol, isopropanol, acetone, or either xylene or toluene. Keep in mind that all of these give off rather nasty fumes, being strong solvents. Besides that, they should get your tape off rapidly, especially if you opt for xylene or toluene.\n\nPlease keep in mind though, that any of these products is likely to strip the paint and/or varnish off anything you use them on.\n\nAnother thing you could try (though I can't guarantee it'll work) is to liberally paint turpentine on the aforementioned crusty tape. Again, it will probably strip your varnish off, but shouldn't damage the wood underneath.\n\nI know someone mentioned solvents already, but these solvents are readily available in most countries (rather than the proprietary Goo Gone and Goof Off, which may or may not be available depending on where you live), with the notable exception of maybe Poland, seeing as even diethyl ether is regulated there.\n\nOn a wooden surface, to remove adhesive residue without any harm, try vegetable oil, oil soap, or furniture oil (not waxes like Pledge). I recently was able to successfully and fully remove a very old, tattered sticker (with adhesive much stronger than that on masking tape) from a built-in wooden shelving unit using (diluted) Murphy's Oil Soap and very little effort; I've also removed other mysterious marks and stuck-on stuff with the same soap. I've used vegetable oils on other surfaces in the past, and furniture oil (Old English is the brand I have) also has advice for removing stuck-on messes on the label.\n\nI've found that (undiluted) dish washing detergent often works well with some adhesive residues. I suggest leaving it to soak in for a little while first.\n\nA gentle scrub with a pot scourer may also assist (although be sure not to use anything too harsh - I suspect that a metal one might scratch the finish). You could test it on the finish somewhere that isn't too visible first.\n\nFWIW, I was going to suggest some sort of solvent, but others have beat me too that (with nearly every solvent known to humankind suggested :) Again though, if you go with one of those, be sure to test it somewhere that won't be visible first (in case it eats into the finish)."
