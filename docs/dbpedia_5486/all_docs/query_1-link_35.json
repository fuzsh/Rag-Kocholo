        "text": "WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SCRATCH REMOVERS AND POLISHING COMPOUNDS?\n\nDifferences in the formulation. Scratch and Swirl Remover products, in general, have similar performance characteristics to rubbing and polishing compounds. Scratch and Swirl Removers, however, are formulated, and product instructions are tailored, for repairing light overall finish blemishes or localized repair.\n\nDeciding which scratch repair product is best for your car. If oxidation and dull finish is the focus; then Rubbing and Polishing Compounds are the best to use. If the focus is scratch repair or removal of finish blemishes, then the focus should be Scratch Repair or Scratch and Swirl removing products.\n\nHOW DO CAR SCRATCH REMOVER PRODUCTS WORK?\n\nScratch and Swirl Removal products usually consist of formulations containing mild or specialty polishing agents designed to remove light surface imperfections and may contain wax or clear polymers to fill in deeper abrasions.\n\nThese products are usually one-step, single application formulas, that allow quick and easy paintwork finish improvement. These products can be used for localized repair to a single scratch or can be applied like a conventional wax for overall car finish restoration. Itâ€™s important to keep in mind that the product performance is limited due to the mild cleansing and polishing attributes of these formulations, meaning that these scratch removal formulations might not be able to remove stronger oxidation, in which case polishing or rubbing compound should be used.\n\nHOW TO REMOVE LIGHT SCRATCHES AND SWIRLS FROM CAR\n\nScratch and swirl removers should be used to remove light scratches or surface blemishes, typically noticeable on the surface paint. Examples are the light marks from fingernails around door handles, light scuffs or when a finish loses its gloss. These products are safe cleaners for removing general road film or swirl marks from automatic car washes.\n\nREMOVING SWIRLS FROM PAINTWORK\n\nStep 1: Start by washing and drying the car.\n\nStep 2: Apply the Turtle Wax Scratch Repair & Renew to a soft cotton/microfiber towel folded into a 6\" x 6\" square. Spread the product to a 2' x 2' foot square area on the finish.\n\nStep 3: Rub with firm hand pressure, using back and forth strokes, for about 60 seconds.\n\nStep 4: Let dry to a light haze and remove excess with a soft cotton or microfiber towel.\n\nStep 5: Continue polishing one section at a time, using a clean cotton/microfiber towel as needed.\n\nLight localized scratch marks can be polished in the same manner except wrap the towel around your first two fingers and use firm finger pressure to rub the scratch with back and forth motion, 10 or 20 times in the same direction of the scratch. Repeat application until the area improves and the mark is less visible.\n\nTIP: Try not to polish hot surfaces or polish the paint in direct sunlight. The finish should be cool to the touch.\n\nREMOVING LIGHT SCRATCHES\n\nStep 1: Start by washing and drying the car.\n\nStep 2: If possible, mark the scratch with masking tape placing the masking tape 1\" above and 1\" below the scratch in order to help the application process.\n\nStep 3: Apply the Turtle Wax Scratch Repair & Renew with a microfiber cloth in a back and forth motion for 30 seconds with firm finger pressure.\n\nStep 4: Wipe dry with a clean microfiber towel and inspect the area for defect removal. Inspect the results of the initial hand application and asses whether further steps are needed.\n\nStep 5: Reapply Scratch Repair and Renew until desired results are achieved or the scratch becomes clear or invisible.\n\nStep 6: Repeat the process up to 5 times.\n\nStep 7: Finish by applying the compound to a larger surrounding area to blend in the repair.\n\nIf the scratch is slightly deeper or you have a large car surface affected by the imperfections, we would recommend using an orbital DA instead of a hand application as this applies higher pressure and warrants more professional results.\n\nFor a full step-by-step guide on how to use an orbital polisher in combination with the Scratch Repair & Renew, visit our How to wax a car article.\n\nSTUBBORN SCRATCH & BLEMISH REMOVAL\n\nAfter following all steps, if the scratch is not removed, proceed to use a heavier grit and a more aggressive rubbing compound.\n\nRepeat the previous steps using Turtle Wax Premium Rubbing Compound or Turtle Wax Clean Cut Rubbing Compound.\n\nNote: paste compounds are more aggressive than liquid compounds. On new, darker paint finishes we recommend Turtle Wax Clean Finish Polishing Compound. On older, oxidized paint finishes we recommend cleaning with paste compounds.\n\nHOW TO GET DEEP SCRATCHES OUT OF THE CAR SURFACE\n\nLocalized scratch damage or other paint imperfections, such as stone chips, paint transfer, and deeper abrasions may require sanding and polishing regimen or paint repair.\n\nPaint repair will require the need to fill the scratch with a matching touch up paint and/or clear coat paint resin.\n\nFor more severe cases, we recommend finding a professional auto repair shop near you.\n\nREMOVING SCRATCHES FROM A BLACK CAR\n\nAs imperfections tend to be more noticeable on black cars, we would recommend a specialized solution. Our Jet Black product range uses pigments to cover any light surface scratches, swirls and imperfections in order to bring out the deepest black appearance.\n\nStep 1: Wash and dry vehicle.\n\nStep 2: We recommend using Turtle Wax Color Magic Black as a 1-step solution for removing minor scratches and swirls on a black car surface. Test on a small area to check a color match.\n\nStep 3: Shake well prior to the application. Apply a small amount of product onto a damp foam applicator or cloth and spread evenly on one section at a time.\n\nStep 4: Allow to dry to a haze.\n\nStep 5: Remove excess with a soft cloth & buff lightly to achieve high gloss and color depth.\n\nFINISHING STEPS\n\nBuffing an area with polishing or rubbing compounds removes scratches and blemishes, but they also remove wax.\n\nClean the treated area and reapply wax using Turtle Wax Super Hard Shell Paste Wax, Turtle Wax ICE Spray Wax or Turtle Wax ICE Seal N Shine.\n\nYour preferred wax method will restore shine and protect the paint.\n\nIf you need some more guidance on how to wax a car properly, follow our step-by-step guide."
