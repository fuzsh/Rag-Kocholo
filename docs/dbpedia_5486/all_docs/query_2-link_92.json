        "text": "Fed up with irritating scratches on your glasses, phone screen, watch, car, or stainless steel appliances?\n\nBefore you rush to replace them, consider an affordable and surprising solution – toothpaste! That's right; toothpaste isn't just for teeth; it's a remarkable scratch remover for various surfaces.\n\nHow Toothpaste Works as a Scratch Remover\n\nToothpaste, especially the paste-based variety, contains mild abrasives that act as fine polishing agents.\n\nWhen applied to a scratched surface, the toothpaste works by gently wearing down the uneven edges of the scratch, making it less visible or even removing it entirely.\n\nHowever, it's essential to exercise caution during this process, as using the wrong technique or a highly abrasive toothpaste can potentially cause more harm than good, leaving you with a dulled finish or additional scratches.\n\nChoosing the Best Toothpaste for Removing Scratches\n\nToothpaste abrasiveness is measured by RDA (Radioactive Dentin Abrasiveness), with lower values (below 70-80) indicating less abrasive toothpaste.\n\nFor scratch removal purposes, it's best to opt for toothpaste with an RDA below 70-80. Stay away from advanced toothpaste products designed for whitening, plaque removal, or sensitive teeth, as they tend to be more abrasive.\n\nFor more information on toothpaste abrasiveness, you can refer to the British Dental Association.\n\nSome suitable toothpaste options to try include:\n\nArm & Hammer Dental Care Sensitive (RDA 48)\n\nWeleda Children's Tooth Gel (RDA 45)\n\nColgate 2-in-1 Fresh Mint (RDA 70)\n\nColgate Total (RDA 70)\n\nColgate Regular (RDA 68)\n\nAvoid using abrasive toothpaste like Colgate Sensitive Max Strength (RDA 83) or Sensodyne (RDA 79) for scratch removal purposes.\n\nRemoving Scratches from a Phone Screen\n\nWhat you need:\n\nSoft cloth\n\nPaper towel\n\nCotton swab or toothbrush\n\nNon-abrasive toothpaste\n\nThe Process:\n\nApply a small amount of non-abrasive toothpaste to a soft cloth or cotton swab.\n\nUsing gentle, circular motions, rub the toothpaste onto the scratched area of your mobile phone screen.\n\nBe patient and avoid applying too much pressure.\n\nClean the screen with a clean cloth, and voilà, the scratches should be less noticeable or completely gone!\n\nHow to remove scratches from a watch face using toothpaste\n\nWhat you need:\n\nMicrofibre cloth\n\nPaste-based (not gel) toothpaste\n\nThe Process:\n\nInspect the watch under a bright light to locate the scratches.\n\nCover the bezel of the watch with narrow masking tape to protect it from damage.\n\nSqueeze a small amount of toothpaste onto the watch face and gently rub it into the scratches using your finger.\n\nWait a few minutes, then polish the watch's face with a clean cloth using circular motions.\n\nRemoving Car Scratches\n\nWhat you need:\n\nPaste-based (not gel) toothpaste\n\nThe Process:\n\nApply a small amount of toothpaste to a cloth.\n\nRub the toothpaste gently and evenly along the scratch in a circular motion.\n\nFor small and shallow scratches, cleaning should be relatively easy.\n\nLarger scratches may require more pressure and time for effective results.\n\nTake your time, especially for badly rusted scratches.\n\nBuffing Out Scratches from Stainless Steel Appliances\n\nWhat you need:\n\nMicrofibre cloth\n\nToothbrush\n\nPaste-based (not gel) toothpaste\n\nThe Process:\n\nApply a small amount of toothpaste to a microfiber cloth.\n\nGently rub the toothpaste back and forth over the scratch, following the direction of the metal's grain.\n\nWipe the surface with a fresh, barely damp microfiber cloth to remove any toothpaste residue.\n\nRepeat the process if necessary until the scratches are no longer visible.\n\nRemoving Scratches from Eyeglasses\n\nWhat you need:\n\nNon-abrasive toothpaste\n\nDamp microfibre cloth\n\nThe Process:\n\nUse a clean microfiber cloth to remove dust particles from the lenses.\n\nApply a small amount of toothpaste to the lenses.\n\nUsing circular motions, gently rub the toothpaste on the scratches for 2 to 3 minutes.\n\nRemove the toothpaste from the lenses using a clean microfiber cloth.\n\nOptionally, rinse the lenses with cold water and then dry them with a cloth.\n\nFinal Words\n\nToothpaste is not just for maintaining your oral hygiene; it can also be an effective scratch remover for various surfaces.\n\nBy following the tips and techniques outlined in this article, you can say goodbye to those irritating scratches and enjoy your sparkling, scratch-free items without spending a fortune."
