        "text": "How to Clean a Whiteboard\n\nHere’s how to clean a whiteboard so its dry erase surface is cleared of all marker residue. Cleaning a whiteboard is simple process that requires just a few items – sometimes just water and a microfiber cloth.\n\nBeyond the microfiber cloth and a spray bottle of water, you could use mild cleaners specifically formulated to clean whiteboards, or “homemade” cleaners such as isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol), hydrogen peroxide, or vinegar – each mixed with water to create a cleaning solution. Rubbing alcohol can be applied undiluted. For vinegar solutions, use about 1 teaspoon per cup of water – or up to a 1:1 ratio.\n\nIf using rubbing alcohol, select a product that is 90% to 99% isopropyl alcohol. More diluted solutions are not as effective. Spray the solution onto the surface, let it sit for a few seconds, then wipe it clean. If marker ink remains, pour a small amount of rubbing alcohol on a microfiber cloth and wipe the stained area with the cloth.\n\nDo not use harsh chemicals or cleaners that could scratch the surface. Scratches will make the board prone to staining in the future – and make whiteboard cleaning difficult.\n\nThree-Step Whiteboard Cleaning Process\n\nAfter you have gathered your cleaning materials, follow these steps:\n\nSpray the whiteboard with your water or cleaning solution. Let the liquid sit a few seconds to break down the ink. Alternatively, wet a microfiber cloth with a small amount of your solution.\n\nWipe the dry erase surface. Microfiber cloths are better than other cloths at removing dry erase marker ink from a whiteboard surface. You might need to spray and wipe a second time. You can use a whiteboard eraser to clean the surface, but make sure there are no sharp edges on the eraser or no sharp filaments in it. If you are using a whiteboard cleaning solution, make sure it is all removed by wiping the board with water only.\n\nRinse the cloth well under running water, and wash it after several uses. If using a marker board eraser, wash it regularly so when you use it, it will have the capacity to remove ink.\n\nWith such proper care and maintenance, the whiteboard surface should now be clean and ready to use again.\n\nUse water or common household glass cleaners. No harsh cleaners are required to remove marker ink from an EVERWhite board surface and some other type of surfaces.\n\nUsing Windex® to Clean a Whiteboard\n\nCan you use Windex® to clean a dry erase board? Yes, glass-cleaning products such as Windex® are recommended for cleaning the dry erase surface of a whiteboard.\n\nNever use scouring pads or abrasive cleaners, as those can ruin the dry erase surface and allow ink penetration.\n\nOn melamine or other types of dry erase surfaces, cleaning chemicals might be needed, such as our Everclean whiteboard cleaner.\n\nHow to Remove Permanent Marker Ink from a Dry Erase Board\n\nIf someone inadvertently uses a regular, permanent marker such as a Sharpie® on a dry erase board surface, it is often possible to remove the permanent marker ink. To do so, trace over the permanent marker ink with a dry erase marker. Then, wipe the board with a microfiber cloth, spray with Windex® or similar mild window cleaner, and wipe the surface again.\n\nIf a stain from a regular marker persists, call EVERWhite at 800-335-7319 for advice on your specific situation.\n\nHow to Remove Tape or Sticker Adhesive from a Whiteboard\n\nTo remove tape or sticker adhesive on a whiteboard surface, use a common adhesive remover such as GooGone® and a soft cloth. Never use plastic or metal scouring pads, abrasives or scraping tools – all which can damage the surface, thus allowing ink to penetrate it and create a stain.\n\nWith regular cleaning – and using the right materials, the dry erase surface of your whiteboard should stay white and bright for many years. EVERWhite guarantees that its whiteboard surfaces won’t stain if properly maintained."
