        "text": "I have asked every art store in my city about glassine paper, and no one has a clue what I’m talking about. They’ve never heard of such a thing. So then I ask what pastelists are using to protect their paintings.. certainly they all cant afford to get framing done immediately… and I get a look as if I have two heads.\n\nSo.. I found a place in Toronto that carries it.. however its on back order and IF the get any in, it will be a while.\n\nWhat else can I use to store all these paintings I have piling up? Is tissue paper safe to place between them so I can stack them? Something else? I’ve long run out of room here and as it is, the paintings are all standing side by side against the wall around the perimeter of the room.\n\n(ordering from the US is too expensive, what with duty, taxes and brokerage fees)\n\nBev\n\nThe thing with pastels is rubbing. If anything rubs up against the painting, then you’ve got touch up to do and sometimes the painting is just lost.\n\nAlthough it’s not the same as using glassine, I’ve used waxed paper for temporary storage and transport. What you have to do is make sure that you have the paper weighted down so that no rubing takes place. You really have to do this even with glassine.\n\nHere is what I do with my master works (giggle) .\n\nI tape my pastel paper to foam core board that is wider than the paper. I do this before I paint and have found that the foam core board really gives a good surface as it has a little “give” to it which is important with soft pastel work.\n\nWhen the painting is finished, I take glassine or in an emergency, waxed paper like you use to wrap sandwiches or use in the kitchen…also you could use baking sheets but I haven’t tried that yet and lay over the top of the new pastel painting making sure that the glassine is larger than the pastel painting but not larger than the board. I then attach the glassine/wax paper with art tape making sure that the glassine/waxpaper is very secure and will not shift. A little tape on all four sides or the corner will secure nicely. Then I place another foam core board over the top making a pastel painting sandwich. This keeps the painting from shifting while you are transporting. Some pressure will not hurt your paintng, but shifting will. After all this, I put the foam core sandwich inside a profolio and off I go. You can stack paintings done on foam core board on top of each other if you put protective paper between then and continue to stack until you have to close the sandwich with a clean foam core board.\n\nIf you are storing the pastels at home, I’d suggest you just clean out a drawer and put your pastels in that drawer with sheets of protective paper between them. If you are the only one going into that drawer, you will know to be very careful when moving the sheets around and will remembe to take the entire stack out without shifting from side to side. Put a board under the stack so that it has some support for when you take the stack out.\n\nPastel are tougher than you think….I’ve heard of some storing their finished works in mailing tubes so they can label each tube.\n\nTry using waxed paper and tell us what you think.\n\n.:.\n\nPhyllis Franklin [/url]\n\n.:.\n\nI often use glassine for pictures I am storing, but then I started to mount them on my walls. I attached cheap poster board, the thin kind, all over my studio walls to protect them, then one by one, I put my finished paintings up on this board. The only problem is my studio is small, and the walls are nearly covered, but I only put my best ones up there. That way, if people visit and come into my art room, they can see my work! I have WIP’s that I haven’t finished yet, in between glassine, stacked on a shelf that doesn’t get touched by anyone but me. The offset printing paper sounds much better, and I am going to look into that. I wish I could just frame the pics I like! If anyone finds an inexpensive way to frame, I sure would like to know.\n\nShari\n\nShari\n\nwww.etsy.com/shop/shariarts"
