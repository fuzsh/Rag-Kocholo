        "text": "Yesterday I was playing back a recently recorded TDK AR and was enjoying the sound from this premium ferric. About 20 min in, I hear some deterioration in sound quality, most notably with high frequency response affected. I rushed to the deck, stopped the deck and examined the tape.\n\nWhat I saw was what could be best described as a scratch-type damage across the surface of the tape, running parallel to the tape travel direction in a straight line and located slightly off-center. Clearly, it was caused as I was playing it, since the damaged portion stopped right at the spot where I stopped the tape. Just prior to playing this tape I cleaned the entire tape path including the pinch rollers.\n\nIt certainly is not the first time I experience this type of issue, but thankfully it does not happened too often. The question I have what is the cause? I can only think of some foreign object that got itself in-between the magnetic surface and the heads. But if so, from where? Maybe Iâ€™m off track here.\n\nI hate when that happens. Though I notice more from binder shedding.\n\nThat must have been a fairly large piece of debris....relatively speaking. It doesn't take a whole lot to cause a few dB of high end roll off. We are talking about less than a micron here. So, something the size of a grain of salt is mount Everest.\n\nIf you cleaned your heads before, then it may have either come from the tape itself or the pinch roller perhaps. If the pinch roller pressure is too aggressive, it could cause a 'more than normal' amount of particles to come off the tape. It could also be debris that got dislodged from the pinch roller (some particle that was already embedded in the rubber) which came loose and got stuck between the head and tape.\n\nEither way, good you caught it. If it happens a fair bit, I would look into cleaning the pinch rollers really well. If it still continues, I would look into the pinch roller pressure. Other than that, maybe the tape is coming apart (doubt it)? Maybe someone else here will have an idea.\n\nThat is the phenomenon so frequently described as railroading. Unfortunately it seems to mostly happen to TDK tapes. You'll find some people have not experienced it at all (and will argue accordingly) while others know exactly what you're talking about.\n\nThat said I have a large box of \"shell donor\" tapes that are railroaded.\n\nWhat happened to my TDK AR is actually a scratch, unfortunately. Railroading, the way I understand it, is a milder issue and looks like an imprint of a railroad track, which still has a smooth mostly undamaged surface, correct?\n\nYour description does sound like a problem more sever than normal railroading. If you can here bad audio as the scratch is passing over the play head then then the damage to the tape is happening before it gets there which leaved the capstan and pinch roller out unless it's a dual capstan deck.\n\nMaybe check the tape guide, erase head & back tension on the feed reel.\n\nIt could be classic railroad tracking but that usually happens either right at or down stream of the capstan and on a single capstan deck even a really bad case wouldn't be heard at the outputs until a 2nd play.\n\nOf course on a dual capstan deck the lead capstan can cause it before getting to the play head and if it's a really bad case and at the right spot on the tape it could be audible.\n\nJeff *flame*\n\nHow about o photo?\n\nGreat idea, just don't think I can pull it off without a macro lens.\n\nI took another look at it, it is a very fine straight line scratch, quite faint that I could see it only at a particular angle - yet readily audible.\n\nOne other time I recall the exact issue occurred after I carefully cleaned the tape path, unpacked a fresh Maxell MX-S, started a recording and while monitoring noticed a degradation in sound quality, namely sharp drop off in high frequencies. My first thought the deck chewed up the tape. Took it out, and saw this light scratch across the tape. Had to re-do the recording on a another tape, as it permanently damaged the tape so that I could not put a good recording over it.\n\nSo, thus far Mod Man 70 offered the best explanation of this non-recurring issue. I now wonder if my \"cleaning\" had to do with it. Both decks involved were dual capstan 3 headers, and not the easiest to clean, meaning one can't press play and engage pinch rollers against the capstans and clean them that way. If you have an AIWA XK-S9000 you know what I mean by that. Even capstans don't rotate on this deck with power on."
