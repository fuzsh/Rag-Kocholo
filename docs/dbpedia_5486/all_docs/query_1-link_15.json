        "text": "Most of us are already familiar with duct tape, double sided tape, and mounting tapes. These kinds of adhesive tapes are valuable especially when you’re looking to do at-home repairs or other projects in a snap.\n\nBut have you ever heard of Reusable Nano Adhesive Tape? As you’re reading this, you’re probably scratching your head and wondering what it is.\n\nLook no further for answers as we’re going to tell you what this tape is all about and the reasons why you need to have it in your stash stat.\n\nWhat is a Reusable Nano Adhesive Tape?\n\nAt first glance, Nano Adhesive Tapes may bear some resemblance to Acrylic Mounting Tapes (which are super useful especially when you’re looking to mount objects on your wall without using screws, bolts, and nails), but it’s more than that.\n\nA Nano Adhesive Tape is a double-sided, transparent traceless tape that can be used for different kinds of purposes such as mounting, securing, or even organizing.\n\nWhat makes this tape unique is that it is washable and reusable without losing its adhering properties. In fact, washing it just makes it stronger!\n\nUses of Reusable Nano Adhesive Tape\n\nAs this humble, little tape has a ton of functions, here are some tips on how you can get the most of out of your roll of a reusable Nano Adhesive Tape:\n\nOrganize your stuff. If you’re looking to organize your remote controls and other electronic devices in a more accessible corner of your room, simply cut a strip of the Nano Adhesive Tape. This method of organizing your stuff is also ideal if you have a limited space at home but you still want to keep things neat and tidy as you’re taking advantage of your vertical space. Since the Nano Adhesive Tape is transparent, you won’t even notice that it’s there - especially if your walls are painted with a light, neutral color.\n\nMount objects on your walls. While a clear double-sided tape or Acrylic Mounting Tape can do the job of mounting objects on your walls, sometimes, it’s better to use a much more ideal adhesive that’s not only traceless but waterproof as well. Since the Nano Adhesive Tape is waterproof, it’s the perfect choice for bathrooms and other areas around your home where the humidity is much more prominent. Use it to hang mount your bathroom caddies, artworks, or even your toothbrushes!\n\nStop your furniture from moving. It can sometimes be a total pain to keep your furniture from moving. Not only does it scratch your surfaces, but it’s also annoying! A Nano Adhesive Tape can also double as a furniture gripper. Simply cut small pieces of the tape and stick it under your furniture. Voila! Problem solved.\n\nAttach decorations on your car dashboard. Given the amount of time we spend in our vehicles, it’s only appropriate that we jazz it up a little so we can cheer up a bit especially when we’re stuck in traffic (urgh, a bummer, we know). Besides installing car seat covers in designs that speak to your personality, it’s also a good idea to put a little something on our car dashboards. May it be your lucky charm or a really cute piece of decor that’s guaranteed to brighten up your day, use a small strip of Nano Adhesive Tape to keep that decor in place.\n\nDIY charging station. Most of us heavily rely on our laptops, tablets, and phones to get some work done or to be entertained. But we also know that our precious devices can run out of juice at a very bad time! Consider setting up your DIY charging station in an accessible area around your home. With the help of the Nano Adhesive Tape, you can simply mount or place your sockets on a surface where it’s easier to juice up your devices.\n\nHow to Install a Reusable Nano Adhesive Tape\n\nWhile it’s very easy to install a Reusable Nano Adhesive Tape, a lot of things can go wrong such as the tape not adhering properly to the surface or the tape losing its adhering power after quite some time.\n\nTo make sure that your Nano Adhesive Tape will perform really well for its purposes, here are some tips that could help you out:\n\nClean both surfaces where you would be installing the Nano Adhesive Tape. Lint, dirt, and dust can significantly lessen the bonding strength of adhesives.\n\nPeel the tape from the roll. Do not cut a strip first.\n\nApply the tape on the surface with the other end of the tape still spooled on the roll.\n\nCut the tape, making sure that you apply tension on the strip by partially pulling the roll. The tension will make it easier to cut.\n\nImportant: Remove the adhesive liner. To separate the adhesive liner easily, you can use any flat tipped object like a card, knife’s edge or your fingernail to create an initial gap between the liner and the tape.\n\nApply more strips by repeating steps 2-5.\n\nCleaning and Repositioning\n\nA Nano Adhesive Tape is reusable, repositionable, and you can clean it easily.\n\nTo reuse the tape, simply wash it under running water. Remove any dirt, dust, and grime that has accumulated over time. When reapplying, do not touch the adhesive side too much as oils from our hands can reduce the adhesive strength.\n\nImproving Bonding Strength\n\nHere are some tips on how to improve the bonding strength of your Nano Adhesive Tape:\n\nYou can increase the bonding strength of the reusable Nano Adhesive Tape by pressing it towards the surface. Make sure to press it firmly through your hands or palm. Squeegee any air bubbles or gaps that may exist between the surface and the tape.\n\nIf you have a hair dryer or a heat gun, you can also heat the adhesive using warm air exhaust. Heating the adhesive upon installation will temper it and further increase the adhesive’s strength.\n\nIncreasing the surface area of application by applying more strips on the object that is to be mounted will also increase the weight holding capacity.\n\nWhat Is The Best Reusable Nano Adhesive Tape?\n\nIf you’re in the market for the best reusable Nano Adhesive Tape, you can’t go wrong with XFasten Double-Sided Nano Tape. It’s available in different size variants. You can check them out here and here.\n\nIt is powerful just like a heavy-duty permanent glue, yet it can be removed easily without damaging the surface nor it will lift off the paint or leave any sticky residues upon removal.\n\nAnd not only that, the XFasten Double-Sided Nano Tape can easily withstand UV rays, hot temperatures under direct sunlight, cold drafts, and heavy downpour of rainwater.
