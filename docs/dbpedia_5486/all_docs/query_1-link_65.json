        "text": "So many of you know I just picked up my first 3570.50 Speedy. But there was one little problem... A few scratches were staring at me right above the 11:00 position. They taunted, and laughed at me( I even heard one of them say something foul about my mother.) Something had to be done. I couldn't stand having these loitering punks on my wrist. So I did my research and found what you all already know to be the savior of the day, Polywatch. Here are some photos of my before/after photos. Hope you enjoy.\n\n1. Before Photo: There are those little buggers above the 11:00 Position.\n\n2. Scotch Tape to protect the best from the abrasive texture of Polywatch. I think next time I'll use black electrical tape.\n\n3. All taped up. Do not rush this part. The last thing you want is a scratched up bezel!\n\n4. Gloop it on the Hesalite Crystal. People aren't kidding when they say \"use elbow grease\" It says to buff in for 2-3 minutes; I did a full 3. Inspected, and I still saw hairline scratches so you know what that means! Polywatch, repeat. I wiped the sweat beads off my heads. everything looked good. Tip: Use the stopwatch provided on your speedy!\n\n5. Coffee Slurp\n\n6. Carefully take the tape off. Regardless of it being super thick scotch tape I was still very careful to take my time.\n\n*No Bezels were harmed during this production*\n\n7. After Photo: All scratches looked to be buffed out. I couldn't be more happy with the results. I used the timer and forgot to turn it off. Here are all my hands waving at you(completely unintentional) Wave back!\n\n8. After Photo: Full Crystal Polish. Shiny!\n\n9. Nothing to do with the front. I just like how this shot came out.\n\n10. Ending on a nice even number. Changed the bracelet out to a nato. I hope you enjoyed this thread!\n\nJust a few polishing tips for acrylic crystals...\n\nIf the scratches are deep, don't be afraid of using some sandpaper to remove deeper scratches. With thick dive watch crystals, I have gone a coarse as 400 grit wet/dry paper. If you are using more than just Polywatch (which is a final polish) then as with any type of polishing operation, make sure as you move up from one grade of sandpaper to another, that you remove all the scratches from the previous grit before you start the next one.\n\nThe crystal will look worse before it looks better:\n\nBut as you move up in grit it will start to clear:\n\nAnd the final result you can barely tell there is a crystal there:\n\nTo show the extent of the scratches more clearly, removing the movement and holding it up to a light (backlit) shows how bad things really are:\n\nAfter it is much improved, but not perfect since some of the marks on this one were more like deep gouges:\n\nMy client was very happy that I was able to preserve the original crystal. So assembled the watch looked like this to start:\n\nAnd this after a complete service, including polishing the crystal (but not the case of course):\n\nThe idea of using a cotton ball for applying Polywatch is a good one, and that is what I do. In fact I don't throw out the cotton ball after I've used it, and I store it in a plastic bag (to keep it from drying out and to keep it from being contaminated) and put it in a drawer in my bench. When I have a light polishing job, I just pull out that cotton ball, and it is already \"charged\" with abrasive, and I can polish light scratches off without opening the Polywatch tube at all. I will use the same cotton ball for a couple of months, and it will become well charged after many uses. Unless it starts to break down, it can be used for a long time. This saves on the amount of Polywatch you use, and makes a quick polish even quicker.\n\nCheers, Al"
