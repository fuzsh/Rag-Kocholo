        "text": "I always use standard A4 printing paper. Very cheap and available almost anywhere.\n\nPut each disk on a piece of paper, right at the centre. Then fold the long edges, next fold the short edges, like shown in the picture. (Make it a reasonably tight fit, so the disk won't slide around inside this envelope, because paper is slightly abrassive, theoretically.)\n\nThat's all. No tape required, the disk won't slip out of the envelope easily.\n\nI use a CD \"spindle\" - you get them when you buy bulk blank CDs and DVDs. It tidies them up and keeps them relatively scratch free. However, whilst it keeps them tidy it just transfers the problem down the line when you want to retrieve the CD from the stack... you have to be quite careful not to scratch them... probably best for archive CDs that you won't use very often.\n\nI've been in the same situation and I've done three things :\n\n1. Single CD cases\n\n2.Plastic packet-type case\n\n3. External Hard Disk\n\nI use the single CD cases to store the games . Although it is not a suitable method for storing every single CD you've got , it can be used to store the important ones (ie. Console games,Premium software etc).\n\nI'm not sure what they are generally called as, but they're for single CDs or two(front&back) , cheap, prevents scratches and durable. I'll leave a description of it, since I don't know what it is called:\n\nPlastic packet with some kind of plastic fiber inside it to prevent CDs from getting scratched. It has two storage areas on either side.\n\nIf you've a bunch of CD (less important but still useful) , the HDD is feasible, but of course, its time consuming to copy the files from the CD to the HDD.\n\nIMO the disk wallet is highly efficient compared to my amateurish suggestions :P"
