        "text": "Collections caretakers such as Collection Managers, Curators, Registrars, Archivists and Librarians often have to make difficult decisions regarding appropriate storage and display materials for the preservation of the historical and artistic materials under their care. It is essential that they choose materials that properly house and support artifacts without causing damage or deterioration. However, navigating a museum or archival supply catalog can be difficult. To further complicate decision making, many materials marked “archival” or “acid-free” available through catalogs or in office supply and craft stores may not necessarily be appropriate for the long-term preservation of collections.\n\nThe following tables show what materials are acceptable for use in the display and storage of collection objects. Please note that many of these materials may be marketed under different product or trade names. When choosing products, if the material-type is unclear or if there are questions about its suitability for use with collections, contact the manufacturer and/or a conservator.\n\nPLASTICS\n\nNot all plastics are suitable for use with collections. However, stable plastic materials that do not off-gas can be an ideal material for safely housing collections items, easing handling, and providing support. Bags, containers, boxes, and sheeting made of appropriate types of plastics all have useful applications in museums, galleries, libraries, and archives.\n\nAvoid using PVC (polyvinyl chloride) plastic because as it deteriorates, it gives off hydrochloric acid. The plasticizers used in PVC can affect photographic materials such as slides, prints and negatives as well as rubber materials and modern plastics. It is also best to avoid the use of cellulose nitrate, cellulose acetate (diacetate and triacetate) and polyurethanes.\n\nFABRICS, THREADS AND PADDINGS\n\nWhen selecting fabrics or padding materials, it is best to opt for undyed and sizing-free materials. Fabrics, threads and padding materials can be used to create custom storage solutions for textiles and to support objects within boxes.\n\nAvoid using wool and felt as they give off sulphur compounds that can tarnish metals, cause fading in feathers and ethnographic materials, as well as attracts insects. Do not use nylon threads or monofilament, also known as fishing line, because they fail and snap easily as they age. Fishing line, if used in direct contact with objects other than hard metals and glass, should be used with padding placed between the object and the line.\n\nADHESIVES\n\nAdhesives, even those marketed as “archival,” should never be placed in direct contact with collections. Some tapes and glues can be used to make enclosures and to seal display cases.\n\nBe careful when using Polyvinyl Acetate emulsion (PVA) and Urea Formaldehyde adhesives because they give off acetic acid which can attack various materials, especially metals. Prior to their use, consider what kind of artifact will be stored in the enclosure where the adhesive has been used. Avoid using rubber adhesives as they give off sulphur and degrade by light exposure becoming brittle. Rubber sealants should also be avoided since they release acetic acid and harmful vapors.\n\nPAPERS AND BOARDS\n\nPaper and paperboards are used to make boxes, folders, support boards, and are also used as interleaving materials. These materials are marketed under several brand names. For museums, galleries, libraries, and archives collection preservation, materials that are marketed as both acid-free and lignin-free should be used. They can all be purchased from archival suppliers. Foamex® boards can be used for display panels and acid-free paper framing tape is also available.\n\nNote that any papers or enclosures being used to store photographic materials should pass the Photographic Activity Test (PAT), which is a predictive test of reactions between an enclosure material and photographic material.\n\nOrdinary paper, tissue paper, gummed paper, Foamcore® and glassine photo envelopes become acidic over time causing organic objects in contact with them to discolor and deteriorate as well as accelerate metal corrosion and glass devitrification.\n\nWood and composite boards including plywood, chipboard, particleboard and hardboard should be avoided as they give off harmful phenol or urea formaldehyde which forms organic acids. Formaldehyde reacts with other materials to form formic acid, which is very destructive. Phenols and formaldehyde are also a heath hazard for people.\n\nIn case it might be necessary to use wood, it is important that the wood is sealed. Barrier foil is the best method: it is a gas impermeable metal foil sealed between layers of inert plastic film, such as PP004 (Moistop®) and Marvelseal 360®. Seal edges with aluminum tape. Do not puncture the foil. An alternative method is to use an acrylic varnish which does not give off harmful vapors. Dacrylate®, Sealbond RJ119® and Cuprinol Enhance® are suitable. Use at least 3 coats and allow them to dry thoroughly between applications.\n\nWhen wood must be used, use seasoned spruce, mahogany, walnut, basswood, poplar, and balsa, or exterior grade plywood as well as MDF (medium-density fiberboard), with formaldehyde-free adhesives.\n\nATTACHMENTS, LABELS, COATINGS AND PAINTS\n\nCollections materials will sometimes need labeling and attached documentation. It is imperative that self-adhesive labels are not used, as well as Velcro®, Blu Tac®, masking tape and sticky tape. Safe tested materials must be used for mounts, such as coatings and paints.\n\nAvoid using unsheathed metal pins that can cause accelerated corrosion if they touch metal objects or stain items they corrode directly. Any other metal that has not been sealed with appropriate sealants might also be susceptible to chemical off-gassing or corrosion and thus should be avoided. Do not use oil or latex paints and varnishes.\n\nAny sticky substance or adhesive applied directly to an object is non reversible and can cause chemical deterioration. Pressure-sensitive adhesives will fail with time, and labels will be lost.\n\nUpdated Summer 2020."
