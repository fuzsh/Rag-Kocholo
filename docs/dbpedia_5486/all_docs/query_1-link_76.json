        "text": "So now that I am reassembling the TR4A project, anybody have any good advice on how best to protect the paint while I am doing the reassembly work? I cover the car when not working on it, but besides being really careful, was wondering what advice you all have in the this regard? Was thinking perhaps using the blue painters tape or similar to protect the top of the fender when working over it, or just a traditional fender protector? Any recommendations much appreciated.\n\nMy method for duster and neon and truck and....\n\nPull the fenders and doors and other easily removed parts. Store out of the way for when you get to that part of reassembley.\n\nProtect all edges with painter's tape, sometimes the whole panel if its small.\n\nWax/ceramicoat the engine bay before anything is installed.\n\nPad with movers blankets taped in place to prevent scratching and light dings. Then use fender covers.\n\nIve gone so far as to wrap silicone tape around tools to prevent chipping and scratches by slips.\n\nThis is what we use. It is a lower tack version of \"crash wrap\"\n\nComes in a roll like this.\n\nBlue masking tape has left impressions in fresh paint that take a lot of cutting and buffing to remove. Also, the adhesive on blue masking tape is only low tack for something like 30 days according to the data sheets. I don't let anyone here leave it on any surface for more than two weeks.\n\nWe've tried the cling film and it's left marks on paint.\n\nWe're back to moving blankets and being careful.\n\nNo matter what, there's going to be touch ups.\n\nMy moving blanket rubbed through a bit of paint on the edge of the trunk lip on the Cortina we're building. The paint was not done by the guy we like to use and the work was poor. The way the paint \"mushed\" off of the edge, I don't think it was catalysed fully.\n\nI've used blue painter's tape to protect areas, but only for short periods (as in hours). I only use the 3M tape as some other brands bond too much after a few hours. This was mostly to protect fender and door edges when installing the panels, but sometimes to protect a specific area while swinging a wrench. The tops of the front fenders need to be buffed out to remove swirl marks from me leaning over, but that occurred over such a long period of time that I'd hate to leave any material stuck there.\n\nFor transport back from the paint shop, the painter had taped some thin soft foam material around the panels. I'm not sure what it was, but maybe you could drape something similar over exposed areas while working."
