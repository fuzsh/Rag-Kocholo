        "text": "Let’s get this straight: Is it “duct” tape or “duck” tape?\n\nBelieve it or not, historically, it’s the latter.\n\nThis fabric tape with its strong pressure-sensitive adhesive was developed during World War II as a waterproof (like a duck’s back!) fix-all for emergency repairs. Though it wasn’t recommended for mending metal ductwork, homeowners began using it that way when the war ended.\n\nManufacturers responded by making it gray to match galvanized steel, then rebranding it. That, according to the folks at Echotape, is how “duck” tape became “duct” tape.\n\nToday, you can find seven kinds of duct tape, from general purpose to professional grade to a type of coated cloth tape called “Mission Tape” that helped save the lives of the Apollo 13 astronauts. They all have one thing in common: a sticky adhesive that leaves a hard-yet-gummy residue when you pull off the tape.\n\nRemoving this residue can be a headache. Josh Rudin, a home restoration pro, says when his company encounters taped ductwork, they “often just cut out that section and redo it according to code.” That isn’t always the best solution, obviously. So he described the ways he removes tape residue.\n\nI also three other experts how they do it. Read on to learn what they said.\n\nAbout the Experts\n\nJoshua Rudin, a certified restorer, owns ASAP Restoration, LLC in Tempe, Arizona.\n\nJames King is the operations manager for DeluxeMaid, a home cleaning service in Indianapolis, Indiana.\n\nDela Gomasi is CEO and director of MaidForYou, a cleaning service in Sydney, Australia. He writes all the standard operating procedures for the company’s cleaning teams.\n\nRafi Friedman is the CEO of Coastal Luxury Outdoors, a pool building, construction and cleaning company based near Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nMethod 1: Dissolve It With a Solvent\n\nMost of the experts agreed using a solvent is one of the best ways to dissolve duct tape residue. These include:\n\nRubbing (isopropyl) alcohol: “For hard surfaces like glass, metal and hard plastics, rubbing alcohol on the residue is a highly effective,” says Friedman. “Simply apply it to a cloth or cotton ball and rub the sticky area until the residue comes off.” Don’t try this on painted surfaces, because rubbing alcohol can soften or dissolve paint.\n\nGoof-Off Pro-Strength Remover: “This solvent is great for around the home tasks like this because it will take off the residue without damaging the materials you are trying to clean,” Rudin says. “This works on almost any surface that has duct tape residue on it.”\n\nOlive oil or cooking oil: “Apply a small amount of oil to the residue and let it sit for a few minutes,” King says. “Gently rub the residue with a cloth to remove it.” This is not recommended for porous surfaces like bare wood or unsealed tile grout, because oil will stain it.\n\nSoapy water: If you’re worried about staining, Friedman recommended this method. “For more sensitive surfaces, a solution of warm water and dish soap can soften the residue, making it easier to scrape off gently with a plastic scraper or a credit card,” he says.\n\nDoes WD-40 remove duct tape residue?\n\nYes, though none of the experts recommended WD-40. But I know it works, and I always keep a can in my car for this purpose.\n\nThough it doesn’t leave stains, it probably shouldn’t be your first choice. Its a strong petroleum odor may bother people with sensitivity to volatile organic compounds (VOCs).\n\nMethod 2: Heat It With a Hair Dryer\n\n“We deal with a lot of removing adhesive residue, duct tape marks and other wall marks that have been left over from previous tenants of a home, where they have tried to hang photo frames and other ornaments,” Gomasi says. “Realtors are often surprised that we have managed to remove the adhesive, as they thought that it would be permanent.\n\n“Our preferred method is to use a hair dryer on the lowest setting to melt the adhesive residue and then we wipe it away. We rinse and repeat until the adhesive has been removed.”\n\nHowever, Gomasi cautioned against using a heat gun. “We find it ruins the paint,” he says.\n\nMethod 3 : Rub It Off With an Abrasive\n\nWhen old tape residue turns hard, you can often rub it off easily from bare wood with 100-grit sandpaper. This won’t work as easily on soft, gummy residue, however, because it clogs up the sandpaper. And it isn’t good on painted surfaces, or surfaces you don’t want to scratch.\n\nRudin recommended a pumice stone in certain circumstances. “It’s best for cleaning mineral deposits off of glass and porcelain, but it can also be used to rub off the residue from duct tape effectively,” he said.\n\nUse a Plastic Scraper\n\nWhether you dissolve duct tape residue with a solvent or soften it with heat, you’ll still need to scrape it off. Don’t use a metal scraper or you’ll leave scratches. You can do as Friedman suggests and try a credit card. But if you’re like me and prefer to keep your credit cards in good condition, go with a plastic putty knife instead.\n\nFAQs\n\nWhat’s the easiest way to remove duct tape residue?\n\nLay fresh duct tape over it, then pull off the tape. The residue often comes with it. This doesn’t always work, but when it does, it’s magic.\n\nWhat causes duct tape residue?\n\nThe remnants of the pressure-sensitive adhesive that makes the tape stick. The adhesive is a blend of rubberized polymers that tend to harden over time, so residue becomes harder to remove the longer you leave the tape on the surface.\n\nCan you prevent duct tape residue?\n\nNo. It’s almost impossible to avoid some residue from clinging to a surface. But the sooner you remove the tape, the less residue will remain."
