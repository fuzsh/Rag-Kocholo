Visit the Lifestyle Forum\n\nHey everyone,\n\nI was just wondering if anyone else was having screen scratches or any kind of damage, I've had my Alta Hr, for a week short of 2 months, and i must say i have been very surprised at the screen quality, due to the number of scratches mine has accumulated. This is a product that is always on my wrist , so after 60 days of usage i have come to the board to see how you are experiencing your Alta hr.\n\n@KDD0705 wrote:\n\nI have worn my new Fitbit Alta hr for two weeks and it already has scratches on the front.

Go to Autozone or any auto parts store and look for plastic polish in the wash and wax aisle. It's a polish to remove yellowing and scratches on dull plastic headlights. Should be around $6-$8. Get a clean microfiber towel and apply the polish to the plastic screen. Work on it pretty good then let it haze. Then get a clean part of that same microfiber towel and buff the screen. TADA! Should come out looking like new. If it doesn't, repeat the process."
