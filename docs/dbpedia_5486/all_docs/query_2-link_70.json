        "text": "Scratched glass and scuff marks shouldn’t stop you from nabbing a good deal at the flea market. The next time you stumble across a midcentury modern treasure with a scuff on its glass, go ahead and bring it home—you probably already have what you need to fix it. Scratched, not cracked, glass isn’t a death sentence for your favorite vase or cocktail glass, either. Repairing scratched glass is easier than you might think. According to Andrii Gurskyi, an expert at Mr. Glazier, two households staples—toothpaste and vinegar—can remove most superficial glass scratches with ease. The steps are as easy as can be, and you can even repair scratches on glass in just an afternoon. Read on to find out how to do remove scratches from glass in just three easy steps.\n\nNote: This repair method is for glass items with surface-level scratches and scuffs. Deep cracks should be repaired by a professional.\n\nCan Scratches Be Removed From Glass?\n\nYes! Light and shallow scratches can be removed from glass items like tables, windows, and even phone screens. There are several DIY methods you can try using a household items like toothpaste and baking soda. If the scratch is deeper, you can try to fill it with clear nail polish. Just beware of going overboard: Too much nail polish can actually damage the surface more.\n\nHow to Get Scratches Off Glass\n\nWhat You'll Need\n\nNon-gel toothpaste\n\nMicrofiber cloths\n\nWater\n\nVinegar\n\nStep One: Apply Toothpaste\n\nWipe the scratched area clean and apply a layer of non-gel toothpaste. Brands with a higher amount of abrasive (such as baking soda varieties) work best. The gentle abrasives rated for teeth are safe enough to even out the surface without risking further damage.\n\nStep Two: Buff It Out\n\nUsing the microfiber cloth and moving in circular motions, buff the toothpaste into the scratched area for a few minutes. Once the area feels smooth, rinse off the excess toothpaste with water and wipe the glass clean with another microfiber cloth. Repeat until the scratch has been buffed out.\n\nStep Three: Remove Streaks\n\nCombine one part vinegar and one part water in bowl. Dampen a clean microfiber cloth with the mixture and apply it to the glass, wiping it down well for a streak-free finish. Avoid using paper or plush cloth towels to maintain a lint-free surface.\n\nIf the scratches are too deep to buff out or you notice that the glass has a protective glaze that’s lifting, call a professional to assess the best repair method. They can glue, glaze, or recut glass for a complete restoration.\n\nCan You Buff Scratches Off Your Phone Glass?\n\nSmall, superficial scratches can probably be buffed out, but deep cracks can’t be treated this way and probably require professional repair. You can use the toothpaste method to buff out small scratches or try a trusty Mr. Clean Magic Eraser—it’s one of the most effective at-home tools for removing light scratches.\n\nWhy Does Toothpaste and Vinegar Work?\n\nThe basics of the science behind using toothpaste and vinegar to repair scratched glass is that toothpaste contains tiny abrasive particles that give it the gritty texture you’re used to. That grit, the same one that helps to polish your teeth, gently polishes the glass, removing any surface level or shallow scratches. Vinegar is a chemical abrasive. Rather than physically removing the scratches, it combines with the toothpaste to polish and shine.\n\nWhat Other Household Ingredients Remove Scratches?\n\nInternet users also swear by these household scratch remedies.\n\nBaking soda and water paste: works the same way the toothpaste mixture does.\n\nClear nail polish: fills in the scratch rather than buffing it out.\n\nGlass polish: If you’d prefer, hardware stores also often sell glass polish, which is a more professional way of removing scratches through buffing."
