        "text": "What would the world be like without adhesive tape? Thankfully, we don’t have to find out. Adhesive tape can be used in so many ways, from sticking two items together to acting as a moisture barrier to masking surfaces when painting and much more. Because adhesive tape—like masking tape or duct tape—is designed to stick, removing the tape and all traces of it can sometimes be a difficult task, especially removing tape residue from wood without damaging the surface. Tub O’ Towels can get you out of that sticky situation, removing even stubborn tape residue.\n\nThe Harder Way to Remove Tape Residue from Wood\n\nDetermining how to remove duct tape residue from wood or how to remove masking tape residue from wood or any type of residue can go one of two ways—the harder way or the easier way. First is the harder way, which can involve multiple steps that move from easier to more difficult. If you want to try the more involved way, here are the steps:\n\nStart scraping with a putty knife, but do it gently so you don’t scratch or damage the wood.\n\nDampen the surface with warm water, which can soften the tape adhesive. Then, scrub with a soft cloth using back-and-forth strokes.\n\nIf that doesn’t work, add a couple drops of dishwashing liquid to try to loosen the bond more. Unless it’s a water-resistant surface, don’t let the water sit long or the wood could be damaged.\n\nYou could also try warming the residue with a hair dryer and then trying to wipe it off with a soft cloth or scraping it off with a putty knife.\n\nUse a clean, white towel or cotton swab to dab a bit of rubbing alcohol on the spot, but not if it’s painted wood because the alcohol could remove the paint.\n\nOn finished wood, you could try WD-40. Put on gloves, spray the surface, wait a few seconds and then use your finger to try to wipe away the residue. Wash away the remaining oil with soap and water.\n\nThe Easier Way to Remove Tape Residue from Wood\n\nRemoving tape adhesive from wood doesn’t have to be so involved or require so much effort. Leave the scraping tools and home remedies behind and grab a Tub O’ Towels heavy duty wipe for the easier way to wipe away sticky tape residue without all the hassle.\n\nPull out a Tub O’ Towels wipe.\n\nTest wipe in an inconspicuous place on the surface you are planning to clean.\n\nPlace one of the wipes over the sticky duct tape residue.\n\nGently wipe the residue/adhesive.\n\nRepeat as needed to remove the residue.\n\nFor strong-willed residue, let the wipe sit on the sticky area so the cleaning agents can permeate the stickiness, then wipe.\n\nAbout Tub O’ Towels\n\nRemoving tape residue from wood and wood furniture is a whole lot easier with the power of Tub O’ Towels heavy duty cleaning wipes.
