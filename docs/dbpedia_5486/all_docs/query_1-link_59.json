        "text": "The previous owner of my beloved Tundra put on rain guards using the double-sided tape included with guards. They are now worn out and so brittle that they are breaking and coming apart (one broke at highway speeds and produced a loud buzzing as it vibrated in the wind, and it started flying apart). I ordered some Weathertech guards to replace them, but I need to remove the remaining double-sided tape from the old guards.\n\nAny advice on how to remove this without damaging the paint? Time in the Texas sun has cooked this stuff on, and I am concerned about damaging my paint (worse than what the tape sitting on there for years has already done) in trying to get it off.\n\nI had the same situation on the 02 I bought in December. The old tape was quite hard. I went after it with short bursts from a heat gun and then a plastic blade scraper, which removed almost all of the crud. Then, my detailer hit the remains with Goof Off and a steam gun, which got the rest. Looks pretty good now. I installed WeatherTech in channel visors on the front doors, which almost disappear against the tinted glass, but offer nearly the same function as the old triangular sail vents when the door glass is toggled down an inch.\n\nI can say from experience, if you use straight rubbing alcohol without diluting it and rub long enough you'll come up with paint.\n\nI use it to remove the butyl seal from the moisture barrier when I sealed my doors for stereo work, it works great but will remove paint. Just an FYI. Not an issue on the inner doors since theyre covered, but wouldnt recommend strait alcohol on clear coat.\n\nI also recommend the eraser wheel.\n\nUsed a 3M wheel to remove badge residue and my TSS decal.\n\nGo slow and don't leave it on the paint for extended periods..\n\n3M Stripe Off Wheel Adhesive Remover Eraser Wheel Removes Decals, Stripes, Vinyl, Tapes and Graphics 4” diameter x 5/8” thick 3/8-16 threaded mandrel 07498 Pack of 1: Power Rotary Tool Accessories: Amazon.com: Industrial & Scientific\n\nhttps://youtu.be/FUj96ns1l7w\n\nHere is a recent thread about a guy removing his 5.7 badge using a heat gun and it took the paint right off..\n\nI'd wouldn't recommend heating up Toyota's already soft paint with a heat gun.\n\nde-badge gone bad | Toyota Tundra Forum (tundras.com)\n\nGet a microfiber cloth and Lacquer thinner. wear rubber glues to keep the chemicals out of your liver, and prepare for some serious elbow grease. A heat gun will help but be careful not to heat up the trim and your paint too much. I removed badges this way leaving my paint flawless underneath. All the other methods will scratch your clear coat. After you are done get 3M paint swirl remover, usually only found at automotive paint stores, and a cotton cloth, as cotton acts as an abrasive in itself, to polish out the clear, should leave it extra clean with no residue, The lacquer thinner will not hurt a cured clear and get all the glue residue out. You will be at it for a while, but the wheel and gun will only get swirls in your clear unless you have all the adhesive off and a clean surface to polish. Goof off does work too, but smells horrible, lacquer thinner does the trick.\n\nThanks a bunch!\n\nI was worried about something happening to the clearcoat in any amount because I would notice just the slightest difference in the paint.\n\nyes I will heat up the badges with a heat gun and then I’ll use floss to take the badge off instead of like a prybar."
