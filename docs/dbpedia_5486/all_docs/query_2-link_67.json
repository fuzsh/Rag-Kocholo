        "text": "Sticker, label, and super glue residue can really stick to wood. Even if you use a top-quality super glue formulated for use with wood, like Loctite Super Glue Ultra Gel Control, unwanted overflow or excess can remain behind. To remove residue from wood without damaging the surface, either finished or unfinished, try these methods.\n\n1. A simple damp cloth can often do the trick. You may want to add a small amount of detergent to the water for a deeper clean. However, some paper-based stickers may become more firmly attached when wet, so be careful. To prevent the wood from swelling or warping, avoid over-soaking it.\n\n2. Heat the area using a blow dryer or a heat gun on low. As the heat weakens the bond, use a card, scraper, putty knife, or other edge to peel off the residue. You can also use tweezers to lift edges away from the wood; keep the heat directed at the residue until everything is removed.\n\n3. Try applying household products such as white vinegar or vegetable oil (eucalyptus oil or lemon oil can work particularly well on wood). Soak a paper towel and press it on the area, letting it sit for five minutes. Gently peel loosened residue away. Take care applying oil to unfinished wood to avoid darkening and unsightly changes. Other options are petroleum jelly or vaporizing rubs. Apply and let sit for a few hours before peeling.\n\n4. Commercial glue removers can remove adhesive from wood, particularly ones containing citrus oil. Always be sure to follow directions when using any of these powerful adhesive removers.\n\n5. If gentler methods donâ€™t work, try more powerful chemical solvents, such as lighter fluid, paint thinner, acetone, or rubbing alcohol. Some of these solvents can affect wood finishes and paint, so test first and apply with caution. Rub the solvent in gently for a few minutes, then wash thoroughly with a damp cloth."
