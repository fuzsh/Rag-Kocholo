        "text": "Teflon tape is a one-time use item. It's sole purpose is to deform and tear itself into the threading of the pipe to prevent water from getting through the threads.\n\nClean the old tape off as much as possible. Use a metal wire brush to really get off the crusty stuff as well but don't scratch up the chrome/nickel/whatever finish and apply about 2-3 layers of new tape clockwise; assuming that righty-tighty applies here. This should take no more than 5 minutes.\n\nDo note that if the shower head has a rubber gasket then that gasket is what produces the water tight seal and teflon tape may not do anything if the gasket fails. It all depends on how that joint was designed. In this scenario you can still apply the teflon tape as long as you don't put any tape where the rubber gasket meets the pipe.\n\nI agree with Ed Beal that you should replace it, but if you're in a pinch you certainly can reuse PTFE tape, assuming you recover enough of it and it's not totally shredded.\n\nCarefully unwrap it and evaluate which end is in better shape. Re-wrap with that portion to the outside, respecting thread direction (you want the tape to tighten as you thread the parts together, not loosen or fold back). Usually that's clockwise looking from the pipe end.\n\nCheck carefully for leaks as the seal will not be as reliable.\n\nAs an additional answer alluded to by Nelson, it also somewhat depends on the use case. If it's a shower head (as in this example) where a drip really won't make any difference, if you don't have new, go ahead and reuse. However, if it's hidden or difficult to get to, you'll want to do it right the first time. Also, if your jurisdiction permits the use of Teflon tape on natural gas or other flammable gas/fluid connections, always use new, as a leak there could be catastrophic."
