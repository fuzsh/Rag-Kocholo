        "text": "Q: Is there a difference between the terms, âoptimizationâ, âinitializationâ andâcalibrationâ, in reference to LTO-9 media?\n\nA: No. Quantum chose to use âcalibrationâ to describe this one-time LTO9 media\n\nevent.\n\nQ: What is Media Calibration?\n\nA: Media calibration has been implemented in LTO-9 technology to optimize data placement to each LTO-9 cartridge characteristics. Brand new LTO-9 media requires a one-time step initialization prior to commencing read/write operations. LTO-9 media calibration enhances LTO tape long-term media durability.\n\nQ: Once the LTO-9 media cartridge has been calibrated within the recommended environmental range, does it need to be re-calibrated when it is moved to a separate drive, separate library, separate data center or environment?\n\nA: No, the LTO-9 calibration process is only required on the first load of a new and unused LTO-9 media, subsequent loads in any LTO-9 drive do not require calibration.\n\nQ: Will LTO-8 media require calibration on first load to an LTO-9 tape drive?\n\nA: No. Media calibration is required only on brand new LTO-9 media.\n\nQ: How much time does the calibration add to the first-time load of a brand new cartridge?\n\nA: Media calibration averages between 35 to 52 minutes per first load of a cartridge to a tape drive, could take up to 2 hours to complete the calibration.\n\nQ: Why does the LTO-9 media require calibration?\n\nA. Higher track densities (TPI) and longer tapes using thinner polymer base substrates in LTO-9 media achieve double digit Areal Densities and more than 21K TPI track density. A new tape calibration algorithm was introduced, ensuring data durability, compatibility and allowing for complex interchange requirements over the specified environmental conditions. The length of calibration is mainly for media optimum characterization and will vary based on these factors. This initial calibration, also, enables the tape driveâs intelligent alignment to optimize data placement.\n\nQ: Does LTO-9 media calibration need to be performed in destination site?\n\nA: It is recommended, due to environmental requirements, that calibration should be performed in the final installation destination where the drives and media are to be used to ensure optimized acclimation within recommended environmental range on Quantum product data sheets.\n\nQ: Can the customer disable media calibration?\n\nA: No, the one-time calibration cannot be disabled. In order for the tape to perform, it must be calibrated before first time use and one time only.\n\nQ: Can I use uncalibrated LTO-9 media for IVT?\n\nA: No, do not use uncalibrated LTO-9 media for IVT. The LTO-9 media needs to be calibrated before use with IVT.\n\nQ: Can I use an Extended Data Life Management (EDLM) drive to calibrate new LTO-9 media?\n\nA: No, the EDLM scan engine will recognize that the media is new and does not contain data and just unload it again without loading it. This mechanism will prevent the media from getting calibrated in an EDLM drive.\n\nQ: Can I recalibrate an LTO-9 media cartridge?\n\nA: Yes. The Format command with specific field settings will reinitiate calibration. However, regardless of recalibration, any Format command will result in loss of all existing data on the tape.\n\nDrive Cleaning Methods\n\nThe library supports two methods for cleaning tape drives with cleaning cartridges: Auto Clean and Manual.\n\nAuto Clean â Configuring a partition for cleaning enables Auto Clean. Cleaning cartridges are stored in the designated cleaning slots. When a tape drive needs cleaning, it notifies the library, and the library automatically cleans the tape drive using a cleaning cartridge loaded in a cleaning slot. Automatic cleaning is integrated into routine library operations. The host application requests the library to move a tape cartridge. If the tape drive performing the operation needs cleaning, the library will perform the move operation and then automatically clean the tape drive with a cleaning cartridge before informing the host application that the move operation is complete.\n\nWhen a cleaning cartridge has expired, a RAS ticket informs the user to export the expired tape from the library. If more cleaning cartridges are present, the next cleaning cartridge will be used for the next cleaning request. If no more cleaning cartridges are available, a RAS ticket will inform the user that the tape drive needs cleaning and that a cleaning tape needs to be imported.\n\nOnly administrators can configure cleaning slots, thus enabling Auto Clean. When Auto Clean is enabled, the library allows you to import and export cleaning media through the I/E area.\n\nNote: Cleaning slots are not visible to the host application. To choose host-based cleaning, do not configure any cleaning slots, and configure your host application to manage cleaning tape drives. Configuring cleaning slots on the library may affect the host application. See your host application documentation for information.\n\nManual Cleaning â When a tape drive needs cleaning, it notifies the library. If the libraryâs Auto Clean feature is not enabled (no cleaning slots have been configured), the library generates a RAS ticket informing the user that the tape drive needs cleaning. Administrators can clean tape drives manually at any time, using commands on the operator panel or Web client"
