        "text": "You are going home with stitches (sutures), surgical staples, special strips of surgical tape called Steri-Strips, or surgical skin glue. One of these items was used to close your incision, help stop bleeding, and speed healing. Follow the tips on this sheet to help your incision heal.\n\nHome care\n\nAlways wash your hands before and after touching your incision.\n\nKeep your incision clean and dry.\n\nAvoid doing things that could cause dirt or sweat to get on your incision.\n\nDon’t pick at scabs. They help protect the wound.\n\nKeep your incision out of water.\n\nTake a sponge bath to avoid getting your incision wet, unless your healthcare provider tells you otherwise.\n\nAsk your provider when can you take a shower or bathe.\n\nAsk your provider about the best way to keep your incision dry when bathing or showering.\n\nPat sutures dry if they get wet. Don’t rub.\n\nLeave the dressing (bandage) in place until you are told to remove it or change it. Change it only as directed, using clean hands.\n\nAfter the first 12 hours, change your dressing every 24 hours, or as directed by your healthcare provider.\n\nChange your dressing if it gets wet or soiled.\n\nCare for specific closures\n\nFollow these guidelines unless your child's healthcare provider tells you otherwise:\n\nSutures or staples. Once you no longer need to keep these dry, clean the incision or wound daily. First remove the bandage using clean hands. Then wash the area gently with soap and warm water. Use a wet cotton swab to loosen and remove any blood or crust that forms. After cleaning, put a thin layer of antibiotic ointment on. Then put on a new bandage.\n\nSkin glue. Don’t put liquid, ointment, or cream on your incision or wound while the glue is in place. Avoid activities that cause heavy sweating. Protect the incision or wound from sunlight. Do not scratch, rub, or pick at the glue. Do not put tape directly over the glue. The glue should peel off within 5 to 10 days.\n\nSurgical tape. Keep your incision or wound dry. If it gets wet, blot the area dry with a clean towel. Surgical tape usually falls off within 7 to 10 days. If it has not fallen off after 10 days, contact your healthcare provider before taking it off yourself. If you are told to remove the tape, put mineral oil or petroleum jelly on a cotton ball. Gently rub the tape until it is removed.\n\nFollow-up care\n\nFollow up with your healthcare provider to ask how long sutures or staples should be left in place. Be sure to return for suture or staple removal as directed. If dissolving stitches were used in your mouth, these will not need to be removed. They should fall out or dissolve on their own.\n\nIf tape closures were used, remove them yourself when your provider recommends if they have not fallen off on their own. If skin glue was used, the glue will wear off by itself."
