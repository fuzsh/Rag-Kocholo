        "text": "With clean hands or a clean towel, wash the cut and surrounding area thoroughly with cold water and soap. Dry with a clean towel or gauze pad. Make sure the site is completely dry.\n\nThe liquid bandage should not be placed inside the wound; it should be placed on top of the skin, where the cut comes together.\n\nCreate a seal by gently bringing the cut together with your fingers.\n\nApply the liquid bandage over the top of the cut. Spread it from one end of the cut to the other, covering the cut completely.\n\nHold the cut together for about a minute to give the adhesive enough time to dry.\n\nDo not use liquid bandage around the eyes, in the ear or nose, or internally in the mouth. If the liquid bandage is accidentally applied to any of these areas, call your provider, 911 or the local emergency number.\n\nIt is OK to bathe after the liquid adhesive has dried. Do not scrub the site. Doing so may loosen the seal or even remove the adhesive completely. It is also OK to wash the site with soap and water daily to keep the area clean and prevent infection. Pat the site dry after washing.\n\nDo not use any other ointments on the site of the cut. This will weaken the bond and slow the healing process.\n\nDo not scratch the site. This will remove the liquid bandage.\n\nKeep the following in mind:"
