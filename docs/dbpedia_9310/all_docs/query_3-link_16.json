        "text": "My name is Aaron Ramsey, and I am a composer from Las Vegas, Nevada (not the Welsh soccer player). I have received my bachelor’s and master’s degree in Scoring for Film, Television and Video Games from Berklee College of Music in Boston and Valencia, Spain.\n\nGrowing up in a musical family that spanned several decades of music, my dad, Alfred Ramsey, played trumpet in the Harry James big band and later was the bandleader for the Caesar’s Palace Orchestra during the heyday of performers such as Frank Sinatra, Tony Bennett and Sammy Davis Jr. My mom, Rebecca Ramsey, played violin in that band and now continues to play many shows in Las Vegas as concertmaster. At present, she is a member of the Las Vegas Philharmonic and plays with Adele in her show at Caesar’s Palace.\n\nI began playing the piano at 8 years old and started drums and percussion in middle school. I went to a magnet arts high school, the Las Vegas Academy, where I was first chair in the school’s concert band, philharmonic and jazz band, as well as the honor band and all-state bands each year. The opportunity to play the exciting percussion parts of modern composers such as John Adams and Shostakovich, along with hearing the compositions of fellow Nevadan, Eric Whitacre, were some of my first inspirations to start writing my own music.\n\nI also love contemporary jazz, and, by my senior year, I had the opportunity to play drum set at the Monterey Jazz Festival with the Las Vegas Academy jazz band. With inspiration from such artists as Ben Monder, The Bad Plus, and Jim McNeely, I wrote my first piece, “Cubism”, for jazz combo while in high school when I was 17 years old. I received a full scholarship to attend the University of Massachusetts Amherst Summer Jazz Festival where I wrote and performed my music.\n\nAfter high school I attended Berklee College of Music, majoring in Film Scoring with a minor in Video Game Scoring, where I was awarded a drum set scholarship. I also maintained an academic standing on the Dean’s List for the entire four years. One of the highlights for me at Berklee was winning the Berklee New Music Festival competition with my pieces “Secret Cycle” and “Kaliedescape”, playing piano at the Berklee Performance Center with my group, the Aaron Ramsey Collective. Another great experience was collaborating with video game design students from USC, scoring two independent games: On the Grid and Echo.\n\nWhile pursuing my Master’s degree in Scoring for Film, TV and Video Games from Berklee Valencia, located in Valencia, Spain, I recorded my film music with several high-level orchestras in Europe including the Budapest Art Orchestra and the London Session Orchestra at the world Famous Air Lyndhurst Studios. My music has also been featured in the Palm Springs Short Film Festival with the short film Copetín.\n\nBeing a native of Las Vegas, I have worked with local orchestras and bands as well. I was commissioned to write “Galloping Across the Galaxy” for the Las Vegas Youth Orchestra and “Odyssey” for the Nevada School of the Arts String Orchestra. I also wrote and performed “Archipelago” with the Las Vegas Jazz Connection big band.\n\nMore recently, I have written two full albums of meditation music in collaboration with violinist Rebecca Sabine (Sea of Light and Under A New Sun) which is featured on Pandora, as well as the Synthonica project, albums of original electronic music inspired by video game soundtracks.\n\nMy passion for scoring music to visuals was sparked at a young age when I first heard the music to the Final Fantasy games by Nobuo Uematsu as well as other video game scores from primarily Japanese composers like Masashi Hamauzu, Motoi Sakuraba and Yasunori Mitsuda. I still love that music! I also love the challenge of interpreting the visual elements of any kind of film in a way that expresses human emotions on a deep, mysterious level. Some of my favorite film composers are Joe Hisaishi (Spirited Away), Thomas Newman (The Shawshank Redemption), and Clint Mansell (The Fountain) because of the deeply emotional content of their music that reaches out to the audience and really connects them to what is happening on screen.\n\nOne of my professional goals has been to receive credit as a main composer on a film, TV show or video game. I dreamt of seeing my name on the big screen at a movie premiere. I have accomplished that goal in part with the short film Chocolate Hair when it was screened at the City of Arts and Sciences in Valencia, Spain with my original music recorded at Air Lyndhurst studios in London. After that, I won a competition to score the short film Copetín by Argentinian director Ernesto Kullock. Hopefully I’ll see my name up there again!\n\nLast, but not least, one of my goals is when someone Googles my name, I want to be the first on the list before Aaron Ramsey the Welsh soccer player.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
