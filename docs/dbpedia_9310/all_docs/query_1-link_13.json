        "text": "The Ramsey curse is a phrase you may see popping up every time a certain former Arsenal midfielder scores.\n\nPeople have noticed a spooky link between Aaron Ramsey, who joined French side Nice in 2022, and celebrity deaths.\n\nA frenzy unfolded on social media in 2018 when fans were convinced the Welsh midfielder's \"curse\" had struck again when he scored against CSKA Moscow.\n\nThe then 28-year-old managed to net an impressive goal in Arsenal's victory, and shortly after, professional darts player Eric Bristow suffered a sudden heart attack.\n\nFans were quick to point the finger at the curse, claiming a bizarre connection between celebrity deaths and his scoring record.\n\nOne person on Twitter said: “20:14 – Aaron Ramsey scores…. 21:49 – Eric Bristow is pronounced dead. The curse is back to haunt your dreams.”\n\nAnother wrote: “Curse of Aaron Ramsey strikes again.”\n\nMore recently, fans drew the link between the death of Grease star Olivia Newton-John and the footballer.\n\nOne fan shared a screenshot of the score between Toulouse and Nice, where Ramsey scored just one minute after coming on the match – and the breaking news story about Newton-John sadly passing away.\n\nThe caption read: \"Aaron Ramsey, retire with immediate effect.\"\n\nWhat is the Aaron Ramsey curse?\n\nA mysterious theory is circling the internet that when Aaron Ramsey scores a goal, a well-known celebrity is doomed to pass away shortly after.\n\nThe Juventus and Wales player often manages to pop up with vital goals – but sometimes with a sinister downside.\n\nFans have labelled the unfortunate coincidence “The Curse of Aaron Ramsey” or the Ramsey Effect.\n\nOut of 64 career goals, 23 have been followed by the death of a celebrity.\n\nFor example – scientist Stephen Hawking and comedian Ken Dodd died – sparking theories that the curse had struck again.\n\nIn 2015 Ramsey opened up about the curious theory in an interview with Sport Magazine, calling it “ridiculous”.\n\nHe said: “The most ridiculous rumour I’ve heard is that people die after I score.\n\n“There have been loads of occasions where I’ve scored and somebody has died.”\n\nHowever, Ramsey pointed to the positive side of it, saying: “That’s just a crazy rumour. Although I took out some baddies!”\n\nWhich stars are linked to the “curse”?\n\nTed Kennedy, August 25, 2009 – three days after he scored against Portsmouth\n\nAndrés Monte, October 14, 2009 – two days after his first goal with Wales the admired Spanish football and basketball commentator Andrés Montes passed away\n\nOsama Bin Laden, May 2, 2011 – a day after he scored against Manchester United\n\nSteve Jobs, October 5, 2011 – three days after he scored against Tottenham Hotspur\n\nMuammar Gaddafi, October 20, 2011 – a day after he scored against Marseille\n\nWhitney Houston, February 11, 2012 – a day after he scored against Sunderland\n\nRay Williams, March 22, 2013 and Boris Berezovsky March 23, Ramsey scores on March 21\n\nKen Norton, September 18, 2013 – Same day he scored against Marsellie\n\nPaul Walker, November 30, 2013 – Same day he scored against Cardiff\n\nRobin Williams, August 11, 2014 – the day after he scored against Manchester City\n\nRubin Carter, April 20, 2014 – Same day he scored against Hull City\n\nDavid Bowie, January 10, 2016 – a day after he scored against Sunderland\n\nAlan Rickman, January 14 2016 – a day after he scored against Liverpool\n\nNancy Reagan, March 6, 2016 – a day after he scored against Tottenham\n\nNicky Hayden, May 22, 2017 – The day after he scored against Everton\n\nRoger Moore, May 23, 2017 – Two days after he scored against Everton\n\nGregg Allman, May 27, 2017 – Same day he scored against Chelsea\n\nBruce Forsyth, August 18, 2017 – a week after he scored against Leicester\n\nKen Dodd, March 9, 2018 and Stephen Hawking March 14 – Ramsey scored on March 8 against AC Milan\n\nEric Bristow, April 5, 2018 – Same day as Ramsey scored against CSKA Moscow\n\nBurt Reynolds, September 6, 2018 – Same day he scored for Wales\n\nKeith Flint / Luke Perry, March 4, 2019 – Two days after Ramsey scores against Tottenham\n\nKenneth Kaunda (Zambia's first president), June 17 2021 – two days after Ramsey scored for Wales against Turkey at Euro 2020\n\nTwitter users were quick to blame the 'curse' for his death, with one saying: \"RIP to Kenneth Kaunda.
