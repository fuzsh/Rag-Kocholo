        "text": "Before anyone goes into a rant against me writing this, I am NOT a fan that wants to see our Welshman go, not this summer or any in the near future!\n\nHaving beaten Everton, Aaron Ramsey came under a bit of stick for missing one or two chances on goal, in fact the poor lad has been getting a bit of stick all season and I struggle to understand quite why?\n\nLet’s take a look at his career with us.\n\nIn 2008, Manchester United all but confirmed the signing Aaron Ramsey, however Arsene Wenger had other thoughts, he nipped in, had a chat with the young man and his family in Switzerland and without hesitation, Ramsey signed on the dotted line and made his move to London.\n\nTough for Fergie, great for us!\n\nBack then, Wenger described Ramsey as:\n\n“A player with a fantastic engine, good build, good technique and good vision”.\n\nWhat Arsene Wenger said back then remains clear to see today!\n\nLet’s not bother looking at his career on loan before he stepped out in the red and white of our club! .\n\nI’m pretty much sure that at that stage in his Arsenal career, most Arsenal fans were excited about our Welshman. Some suggested he was ‘the next Cesc Fabregas’, a future captain in the making….\n\nOne man certainly didn’t need convincing about Ramsey and that was the man who signed him and in July 2009, Ramsey signed a new long-term contract. In the August of 2009, Ramsey scored his first league goal for Arsenal, a one-on-one past David James as we thrashed Pompey 4-1 at The Emirates, he then had a part to play in the Champions League play-off fixture against Celtic, setting up Arshavin in our 3-1 victory.\n\nHe followed that with a Man of the match performance against Liverpool in the Carling Cup and all was looking good.\n\nHis first start in the Premier League came in November 2009, he played the full ninety minutes against Wolves, a game in which we were struggling a tad, until Song came on. He and Ramsey then bossed the midfield together and we romped home with ease.\n\nJust a few days after that game, Ramsey was awarded the Welsh Young Player of the Year award.\n\nIn the December, Ramsey scored his second goal for his new club, this time against Stoke in a 2-0 victory and it didn’t take him too long to get his third, this one was again against Portsmouth, a game in which he nabbed an assist too.\n\nOn to January the following year, 2010, he scored a 78th minute equaliser in the FA Cup third round tie against West Ham at Upton Park – (we went on to beat them in the replay)\n\nAt this stage in his career, Arsene Wenger described him as:\n\nAn offence-minded Roy Keane, an all-round player, with a fantastic ability to cover distances.\n\nCan any Arsenal fan not say that he/she wasn’t totally and utterly excited about this young player who appeared to have the intelligence of a player beyond his years?\n\nThen it all went so horribly wrong…..\n\nOn the 27th February 2010 we travelled up North to face Stoke City, a side who loved to get in ‘the faces’ of other teams.\n\nWell on that day, one man went a lot further, he didn’t just get in the face of our players, he wiped one out, totally!\n\nRyan Shawcross went in so late and so dangerously on Aaron Ramsey he caused a double fracture to his lower right leg. His tibia and fibula were broken!\n\nLate in March the same year, after surgery, our player was back walking without crutches, remarkable but he had a long long way to go.\n\nIn the June, he signed another contract, nothing was going to stop Arsene Wenger keeping our man, not even a double break!\n\nRemarkably, Ramsey returned to training in October 2010 and on the 23 November he made his return to competitive football for our reserves.\n\nFurther loans came his way and understandably so, he had to come back slowly….\n\nFebruary 2011 – yes 2011, just over one year ago, Ramsey was finally back at his own club, his first game was against Manchester United in the FA Cup, he was a 72nd minute substitute in a game we lost 2-0. The following month, he made his first start against West Brom and the month after that, he played and scored his first goal against Manchester United and he played so well, he earned the man of the match award.\n\nThe season ended and Ramsey had played just seven matches for us!\n\nSo, with all of seven fixtures last season, it seems that everyone, well, not everyone, expected Aaron Ramsey to be back to his best this season.\n\nHe should be over his injury shouldn’t he?\n\nHe shouldn’t have any mental scars or worries either, surely?\n\nHis game should have got so so much better shouldn’t it?\n\nDoesn’t matter that he only played SEVEN fixtures last season does it?\n\nWell, just think Eduardo and maybe all his critics will think again before knocking his performances this season.\n\nEduardo suffered a ‘similar’ injury and look where he is now, but we all expected Ramsey to slot and start performing at the highest level, didn’t we?\n\nNo is the answer to that, not all, most truly believed he would need at least a season to get back to where he was, let alone make strides ahead, so why is he getting so much stick?\n\nThis season, Ramsey has been accused of playing ‘like Denilson’ with his sideways passing, slowing down play in midfield with his backwards passing and after Wednesday, his shooting skills are dire!\n\nWell I think some, maybe even many fans are being very harsh on Ramsey, he’s always busy, always looking to be involved and always looking to make things happen. It hasn’t been his fault that there has been limited movement off the ball when he’s looking to make his pass is it?\n\nMost of the criticism was directed towards him when we were going through a lean old spell; he was an easy target, just as Theo and Gervinho so often were and still are.\n\nPlayers like Ramsey are hard to find, just bear with him this season and allow him that bedding back in after injury time, he deserves it!\n\nNext season, all those who have been on his back will be eating humble pie.\n\nSell him this summer?\n\nIn the words of the great John McEnroe: ‘You cannot be Serious’!\n\nHave a good day all…"
