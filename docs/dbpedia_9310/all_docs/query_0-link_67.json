        "text": "Juventus have announced the signing of the Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey, on a lucrative four-year deal from 1 July.\n\nThe Wales international has agreed a pre-contract deal with the Italian champions and will join on a free transfer when his Arsenal deal expires at the end of the season.\n\nRamsey had been in talks with Arsenal over new terms until the club withdrew their offer in October, leaving Ramsey free to end his 11-year spell at the club where he played 259 times and scored 61 goals.\n\nA club statement read: “Juventus Football Club announces that a contract of employment with the player Aaron James Ramsey, effective as of 1st July 2019 and expiring on 30 June 2023, has been signed. As a result of the registration of the player, Juventus will incur additional costs of €3.7m (£3.24m), to be paid within 10th July 2019.”\n\nRamsey, who joined Arsenal from Cardiff City in 2008, had held talks with Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain but it became clear Turin would be his destination with terms of around €400,000-a-week being offered. That figure will make Ramsey the highest-paid British footballer.\n\nThe 28-year-old issued his own statement via Instagram. He wrote: “I wanted to issue a personal statement for all the Arsenal fans who have been extremely loyal and supportive. You welcomed me as a teenager and have been there for me through all the highs and lows I have encountered during my time at the club. It is with a heavy heart that I leave after 11 incredible years in north London. Thank you.\n\n“I will continue to give the team 100 per cent and hope to finish the season strongly, before heading on to my next chapter in Turin.”\n\nRamsey’s contract at the Emirates will expire on June 30th and Arsenal will receive no fee when he leaves.\n\nAn Arsenal statement read: “Everyone at Arsenal Football Club wishes Aaron Ramsey a happy and successful future. Aaron’s made a fantastic contribution to our club since joining from Cardiff City in 2008. He has always been a consummate professional and will always have a special place in the hearts and memories of Arsenal fans around the world.” – Guardian service"
