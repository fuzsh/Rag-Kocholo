        "text": "Arsene Wenger has admitted he is surprised that Arsenal were unable to retain the services of midfielder Aaron Ramsey.\n\nThe legendary Gunners boss brought the Wales international to north London during his teenage years but Ramsey’s time with Arsenal will end when the season draws to a close, as he will join Juventus.\n\nRamsey will be paid a staggering fee by the Italian champions, reportedly as much as £400k-a-week, but Arsenal will not see a penny in transfer funds as his move will be on a free transfer.\n\nAn announcement of the deal earlier this month brought an end to a long saga on Ramsey’s future, which traced back to Wenger’s final year at the Emirates Stadium, and the inability to secure a renewal is seen by many as a major mistake from the club.\n\nWhile some reports have suggested Ramsey had no interest in extending his stint with the Gunners, Wenger has suggested differently by stating he was under the impression the 28-year-old would sign a new deal.\n\n“In the case of [Aaron] Ramsey, it’s not a question of running down his contract. Not at all,” he said in Monaco at the Laureus Sports Awards, where he picked up a Lifetime Achievement honour.\n\n“I think it was not a financial situation and not a desire of the player to leave. But, as long as I was there, I was convinced the player would stay.\n\n“What happened after, I do not know. It was not a financial problem, not a player to leave problem.”\n\nInterestingly, Wenger’s comments suggest that Arsenal had the finances available to tie Ramsey down to a new contract - despite some suggestions that the Gunners face a difficult time balancing their books.\n\nKeep up to date with the latest news, features and exclusives from football.london via the free football.london app for iPhone and Android ."
