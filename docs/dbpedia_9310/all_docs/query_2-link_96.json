        "text": "Sam and his dad love football. Sam's favourite player is the Welsh national Aaron Ramsey, and he's watched all his games over and over.\n\nHe's desperate to go to Cardiff stadium to watch a big match, but money is tight, and things between Mum and Dad can be tense. When Dad is signed by the local team, Sam is thrilled. Some professional footballer stardust is reflected onto him too, particularly at school.\n\nBut then there's an accident and Dad's dreams are crushed. The atmosphere in the house gets worse â€“ and Dad's secret is exposed. Can Sam and his father find a way to connect again?\n\nManon Steffan Ros writes in both English and Welsh and has won the Yoto Carnegie Medal and the Tir na N'Og Welsh children's literature award. Here she explores some hard-hitting issues, including adult illiteracy, physical disability and family turmoil.\n\nBut the courage and clear sight of Sam, who simply adores his father, shines through to create an uplifting story. A moving exploration of a father-son relationship, set in small-town Wales.\n\nThere is an edition available in Welsh too, written by the author."
