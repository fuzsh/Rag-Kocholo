        "text": "At some point in your life, you've probably heard of the \"27 Club,\" but have you ever heard of the Aaron Ramsey curse? The Welsh footballer has become well-known for kicking some of the world's deadliest goals. Unfortunately, when he knocks a ball into the back of the net, it has become a signal for celebrities all over the world to take shelter. Overall, 17 of Ramsey's professional goals have been followed by a well-known public figure tragically passing away. This is the curse of Aaron Ramsey, and all the lives it's claimed.\n\nYou won't believe what Harry Potter star the curse took from us on slide 6!\n\nIt Started In 2009\n\n\"The Curse of Aaron Ramsey,\" which is also known as the Aaron Ramsey Effect, began in 2009 with a goal against Portsmouth. No one knows what voodoo was placed on the up and coming football star to create the curse, but nearly a decade later it's still going strong.\n\nOf course, when the Aaron Ramsey Effect first struck, no one noticed. As you'll soon find out, the first person claimed wasn't an actor or musician. He was an American politician, and now he's the starting off point for our story."
