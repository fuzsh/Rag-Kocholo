        "text": "Ramsey signs for hometown club\n\nPlayer was a free agent after leaving Nice\n\nOutlines 'unbelievable' feeling\n\nWHAT HAPPENED? Ramsey was a free agent after his contract with French side Nice expired last month and at the age of 32, has now completed a stunning return to Cardiff, where he began his career.\n\nTHE BIGGER PICTURE: The Sun reports that Ramsey turned down a lucrative offer from Saudi Arabia in order to fulfil his dream and end his career playing for his hometown side. Ramsey joined Arsenal at the age of 17 from the Welsh club, back in 2008.\n\nArticle continues below\n\nWHAT THEY SAID: Ramsey said upon his unveiling, per BBC Sport: \"It feels unbelievable to finally be back here. I always thought one day I'd come back, and now it's the perfect time to do that. To be back with my family and around familiar faces is just brilliant, so I'm delighted to be back here now. I've missed that a lot in the last year or so, so it was important for me to be back around them.\n\n\"Obviously I'm a Cardiff City fan, and watching them over the years since I've been away, we've had some low points but some big highs as well, being in the Premier League and representing Cardiff on the big stage. That's a target of mine - to try and help my team-mates and this club to get back to the top.\n\n\"I've said it many times in the past - I owe so much to Cardiff, to the fans, to everybody who has been at the club when I was here as a young boy coming through. For me now to come full circle, to be part of this team now, and hopefully achieve the goals we want, there's no better feeling than that.\"\n\nIN ONE PHOTO:\n\nGetty"
