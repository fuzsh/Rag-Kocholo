        "text": "About Aaron\n\nEvery footballer dreams of playing at the highest level. Aaron James Ramsey has enjoyed a distinguished career in the top-flight and international game, and now contracted with Juventus until 2023, the future continues to look bright for Aaron.\n\nAaron made his debut for Cardiff City at the age of 16, becoming the clubâs youngest ever player. His first season of professional football earned many plaudits and set the stage for what was to come. Just over a year following his club debut, Aaron had been courted by multiple Premier League teams, and after a personal meeting with Arsene Wenger, Aaron joined Arsenal on a long-term contract.\n\nAaron established himself straight away at Arsenal, quickly becoming a fan-favourite. Managers and pundits alike remarked upon his incredible ability to cover the length of the pitch, and his attacking-mindset made him an important fixture in the Arsenal midfield. Despite suffering a lengthy spell in recovery from a major injury, Aaronâs mentality gave him an edge, and his 2013-14 campaign showed just how good he could be, winning Arsenalâs Player of the Season.\n\nMeanwhile, Aaron had been racking up the appearances for his national side, Wales. At the age of 20 he had become the youngest player to captain the Welsh side, and he played a major part in the Euro 2016 squad where his performances earned him a place in the team of the tournament.\n\nAaron would go on to be named Arsenalâs Player of the Season for the second time in 2018, and the following year, he made the next move in his career. Looking for a new challenge, Aaron moved across Europe to join the Italian club Juventus, where he plays today."
