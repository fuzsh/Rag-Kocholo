        "text": "talkSPORT host Adrian Durham believes Aaron Ramsey has \"every right” to demand the same wages Arsenal’s Mesut Ozil receives at the club.\n\nRamsey looks poised to leave the Gunners for free at the end of the season after it emerged talks between the player and club regarding a new contract had broken down.\n\nThe Welshman has been an Arsenal player for ten years and has scored the winning goals in two of their last three FA Cup final victories (Hull in 2014 and Chelsea in 2017).\n\nHe was named the club's player of the year last season and has received a great deal of praise from new Arsenal boss Unai Emery.\n\nHowever, there is huge doubt over Ramsey's future at the Emirates and Durham believes letting him go would be a mistake considering Arsenal gave Ozil a contract worth £350,00-a-week in January.\n\nSpeaking to fellow Drivetime host Darren Gough, Durham suggested said was \"no logical reason\" why Ozil should be paid more than Ramsey.\n\nDurham said: \"This is where the Mesut Ozil contract comes back to haunt Arsenal. Aaron Ramsey has every right to ask for the same money as Mesut Ozil.\n\n\"There is no logical reason why Ozil should be paid more than Ramsey.\n\n\"Ramsey is well within his rights to go to Arsenal and say he wants the same money as Ozil after the bumper contract they gave him.\n\n\"If Arsenal think they can do better or they can even afford to lose them on a free then that’s the way they’re running their club I guess.\"\n\n‘Aaron Ramsey could play anywhere in Europe’ – Ally McCoist blasts Arsenal for allowing Welshman’s contract to expire\n\nDurham went on to echo the views made by the likes of Ally McCoist that Ramsey could play for some of Europe's top sides before labelling the 27-year-old as \"one of the best players in the Premier League.\"\n\nHe added: \"If Ramsey leaves Arsenal is he going to be scratching around for a club? Will he be looking at other clubs in the bottom half of the Premier League? I don’t think so.\n\n\"I think he can go to one of THE big club’s abroad. I absolutely feel they’ll come in for him.\n\n\"They’ve seen what he’s done on the international stage at Euro 2016. He was there with Wales and he was their best player. It will not have gone unnoticed that Ramsey was the main man for Wales.\n\n\"This is not a bit-part player, this is not somebody who’s making up the numbers while the others are the stars, this is one of Arsenal’s main players, one of the best players in the Premier League.\n\n\"I’m bewildered as to what Arsenal’s rationale is.\n\n\"Losing Aaron Ramsey on a free strikes me as a big loss.\""
