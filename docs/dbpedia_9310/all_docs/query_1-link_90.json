        "text": "Wales manager Gary Speed said it was “inevitable” that Ramsey would eventually wear the armband. So he has decided to award it to him now.\n\nSpeed is building for the future and all his plans are about qualifying for the 2014 World Cup Finals in Brazil, but suddenly Ramsey is the present with the Welsh hoping he can be the flag-bearer for a generation of young players, including Gareth Bale, Joe Ledley and Chris Gunter.\n\nSpeed is also rewarding Ramsey for his recovery and hoping the responsibility will give him a burst of confidence. “I’ve come back from a bad injury in the last year and I have had to be strong mentally to get through that,” the Arsenal midfielder said. “I’ve definitely been through a lot but I think I’ve benefited from that now, and I’ve grown up a bit as well.”\n\nThere was only one moment during Friday’s press conference at Wales’s Vale of Glamorgan training base, when a clearly nervous Ramsey spoke for the first time as captain, that there was a chill in the air. He was asked whether Ryan Shawcross had been in touch to offer his congratulations. “No,” Ramsey said bluntly.\n\nAnd that was all. He wasn’t going to expand on his thoughts of the events of February 2010 when the Stoke City defender ploughed into Ramsey’s right shin and the stellar progress made by the kid from Caerphilly shuddered to a halt.\n\n“Hopefully now I can show what I’m capable of doing and show that you can come back from a bad injury and be the same player,” Ramsey said.\n\n“I don’t think I am too young, I think I have about 50 appearances for one of the biggest clubs in the world and I played at a high level already in my career. I know I am not a screamer and a shouter and I won’t change the way I am. Obviously, some people will disagree with it, but the manager has made his decision and hopefully I can prove it to be the correct one.\n\n“I’ve always wanted to become captain of Wales one day, and it has happened at such a young age but hopefully now I can keep it for a long time,” Ramsey added, rejecting suggestions that he may, perhaps, be a little “shy” for such a high-profile role. “I’m quite a confident person. I’m not someone who is the life and soul of the party, but I do speak up when there is something to say.”\n\nHe certainly has a steely determination. After all, this is a young man who rejected Manchester United. After writing down the pros and cons of going to a number of leading clubs who wanted to sign him in the summer of 2008, he moved from Cardiff City, where he had been the club’s youngest first-team player and an FA Cup finalist, to Arsenal.\n\nAnd when he broke his leg he was shaping up to be one of the best young midfielders in Europe.\n\n“When I had to make that decision, it was hard, I had to think about things and I wrote them down, and one of them was I felt there would be more possibility of playing at Arsenal,” he said. “They wanted me and they have had a lot of youngsters and given them opportunities at a young age. I thought that made it best, and that’s what happened. I’ve played a lot of games at Arsenal and now we are here.”\n\nWhen, in October 2008, Ramsey dominated a Wales v England Under-21 tie, overshadowing the likes of Tom Huddlestone and Mark Noble, the Welsh coach Brian Flynn spoke of a “new Fabregas”."
