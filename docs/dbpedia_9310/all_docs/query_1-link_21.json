        "text": "Having scored the winning goal in extra time of the 2014 FA Cup final – and after his Arsenal teammates had piled on and off him again – there was a moment when Aaron Ramsey lay on his back on the Wembley turf. To the crowd, it seemed the 23-year-old Welshman was letting the magnitude of what he'd done sink in. \"I was just knackered!\" he recalls. \"I don't know how far I sprinted in the celebration but I used all my energy up. I needed a couple more seconds to recover...\"\n\nPeople want a reaction, to get under your skin. Why give them the satisfaction?\n\nTen years since his club's last trophy and 2-0 down after eight minutes, you'd understand if Ramsey had spent the rest of the game hoping for said turf to swallow him up. But he kept looking for the ball, trying to make things happen – right up the 109th minute, when he burst into the penalty area and steered a shot inside the near post with the outside of his boot. \"You have to believe,\" he says. \"It only takes a second to score. I always believed we would come back.\"\n\nWhile onlookers – including a fair few Arsenal – may not have shared his relentless positivity, the script had been written, to use a football cliché. It was always going to be Ramsey. He kicked off last season with a phenomenal eight goals in 10 games; his tally until then was a more modest 11 in 150. When he was injured against West Ham, he was in the Premier League's top three for most touches of the ball, assists, successful passes and tackles won. He finished the truncated campaign with 16 strikes from 34, plus nine assists. Were it not for his enforced three-month absence, Arsenal fans might have been dreaming of another league and cup double.\n\nTo those same onlookers, Ramsey seemed stronger, fitter, faster. Whatever he was on, they wanted some. But the difference wasn't physical: it was mental. \"I was getting stuck into tackles again, which took me a while to front up to,\" he says, alluding to the pyschological fallout of his horrific leg break in 2010. \"Now I don't hesitate to push people off the ball. The only thought going through my head is to win possession and it's something a lot of people have noticed.\" Certainly anyone who's seen the YouTube clip of him going shoulder-to-shoulder with Yaya Touré. (Spoiler: the Ivorian man-mountain comes off worse.)\n\nIt took three years to rebuild both his shattered bones and confidence. When he did come back, the same supporters who just now voted him player of the season were then booing his every touch, venting their frustration at the club's policy of buying promising youngsters, not established stars. It didn't help that he was being played out of position. Professed Arsenal fan and professional troll Piers Morgan tweeted that Ramsey was \"a complete and utter liability.\"\n\nIn this era of 24-hour rolling 'news' and antisocial media, doubt doesn't so much creep in as send you a direct message saying you're f-ing useless. But Ramsey just blocks it out. \"When you start to question yourself, you're in trouble,\" he says. \"Believe in yourself, no matter what anybody says. You know what you can do; that's all that counts. People want a reaction, to get under your skin. Why give them the satisfaction?\"\n\nHis fortitude is by no means just mental. Ramsey is the embodiment of the modern footballer, combining technique with athleticism. Surprisingly tall, lean but no pushover, he can run \"all day\": heat maps of his performances look like they've been coloured in. His engine is fine-tuned daily on the training ground. \"The intensity has to be there in every session,\" he says. \"Otherwise you won't take it onto the pitch.\"\n\nFitness drills include sprints and longer intervals: three lots of six minutes \"to get the legs going,\" he says. The resistance element comprises Olympic lifts at low reps but high weight and speed, to build power for those late bursts from midfield as opposed to superfluous muscle. \"I try and get two sessions in a week to keep my strength topped up.\"\n\nIt's not enough to simply go through the motions: Ramsey's game-winning stamina comes from his willingness to go the extra mile on non-match days. \"I try to push myself to the maximum that I can, to keep myself in the best possible shape,\" he says. \"Being a midfielder, I need to get up and down, whether it's to get back and defend or get away from my opposite number. Extra effort in training makes all the difference.\" Knowing that he's done the hard yards bolsters his confidence too. It doesn't all have to be work though: \"There's a little group of us who stay behind after training to do some passing or shooting. The manager and staff try to nick the balls off us to get us in.\"\n\nHis discipline is total, whether it's protein shakes and chery supplements after a game (\"they help you recover that extra 1 or 2%\") or whole foods before it. \"Breakfast is muesli, a couple of eggs, green tea and a banana; lunch is fish with a big plate of vegetables and maybe a bit of rice.\" Well, almost total. \"I stay away from desserts but every now and then I have a sticky toffee puding or a cup of tea with some biscuits... I say 'some', more like half a packet. I try not to keep any in the house.\" Probably best, given the tightness of Arsenal's trendy new compression-style Puma kits: \"Some of the boys are going to struggle with that next season, I'm trying to get an XXXL so it's a tiny bit baggier...\"\n\nFashion is something the photogenic Ramsey is increasingly concerned about, having ben signed to the 'special bookings' board of London's Elite model agency. \"It's... a bit different,\" he says somewhat bashfully of what is clearly unfamiliar ground. \"There's been some banter about it from the lads. But I really enjoyed the Urban Active shoot.\" Then there's the edgy new haircut he got as part of it, which naturally the Daily Mail website ran a story on when he turned up to training the next day.\n\n\"I like it, but it takes me too long to do in the morning.\" His preference for \"subtle and classic\" brands such as Reiss reflects his humble personality and upbringing, but he has showier tastes in watches – he's wearing an Audemar's Piguet with his T-shirt, shorts and trainers at the interview – and cars. \"They're my guilty pleasure. I drive a Mercedes SLS, which is fun. One of the nicest cars I've seen is the Ferrari F12 Berlinetta. I'd like to give that a go.\"\n\nBut the reality of being a professional footballer isn't all flash cars and watches though – at least, not if they're actually professional about it. \"You travel a lot around Europe, especially during the Champions Lague. Sometimes if you play three games in a week then you don't get a day off. Stil I love what I do and wouldn't change it.\"\n\nIndeed, being successful at the highest level demands certain sacrifices, especially when you consider the average 23-year old male does on a Friday night: \"I always had games on Saturdays as I was growing up. My mates went out and I had to say, 'Sorry but I can't.' I was so switched on to becoming a footballer; that was all I wanted to do. Obviously I've missed out on a few things over the years. But I think I made the right decision...\"\n\nPhotography: Arnaldo Anaya-Lucca"
