        "text": "Aaron Ramsey was an unused substitute as Juventus secured a record-extending ninth straight Serie A title following a 2-0 win over 10-man Sampdoria.\n\nThe Wales midfielder, who has been used sparingly by Maurizio Sarri this season, watched on as the Old Lady claimed their 36th league title.\n\nAfter missing out on the opportunity to seal top spot on Thursday following a shock 2-1 defeat against Udinese, Juventus needed to win one of their remaining three games to wrap up the league title.\n\nAnd goals from Cristiano Ronaldo – his 31st in the league this term – and substitute Federico Bernardeschi ensured Sarri’s men got the job done against Sampdoria.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nIt is the sixth trophy Ramsey has won after lifting the FA Cup three times and Community Shield on two occasions during his time with Arsenal.\n\nThe midfielder is also the second Welshman to win the Italian top flight after John Charles, who enjoyed three title triumphs during his time with the Black and Whites.\n\nRamsey has made 23 league appearances for Sarri’s men this season, scoring three goals and managing one assist in the process.\n\nHowever, he has been consigned to the bench for the majority of his first campaign at the Allianz Stadium having made the starting line-up on 14 occasions in all competitions.\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nAnd the 29-year-old, who joined the Italian giants on a four-year contract after leaving the Gunners last summer, has been linked with a move away after just one season in Turin.\n\nDespite signing a deal until the summer of 2023, a return to the Premier League could be a possible destination for the Welshman next season, with Arsenal’s London rivals Chelsea among those reportedly interested in landing him.\n\nThe report suggests Juventus boss Sarri is interested in a reunion with Chelsea midfielder Jorginho, which could see Ramsey go the other way in a swap deal.\n\n[Featured image: Mike James]"
