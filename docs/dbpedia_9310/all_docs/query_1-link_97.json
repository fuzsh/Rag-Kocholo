        "text": "You could never accuse Sir Alex Ferguson of not learning from his mistakes. Even at the ripe old age of 67, with a 10th Premier League title and second European Cup glistening in the crammed Old Trafford museum, Ferguson was taught a lesson by his greatest adversary.\n\nArsene Wenger seldom got one over Ferguson in the Scot's final five years but did in the summer of 2008. The United website's overdue redesign has nixed the url, but in June 2008 the club announced they had agreed a deal with Cardiff City for the transfer of 17-year-old Aaron Ramsey.\n\nIt is unusual for United to comment on anything transfer-related until a signing is posing in front of a the words 'AON Training Complex' or by a Chevrolet at Carrington. Yet on June 3 2008 a report on their website was entitled 'Ramsey fee agreed'.\n\nThe article said: \"United have agreed a fee with Caridiff City to bring talented teenager Aaron Ramsey to Old Trafford.\n\n\"The 17-year-old left-sided midfielder has yet to agree personal terms and must also pass a medical before any deal can be completed.\n\n\"A club spokesperson told ManUtd.com: 'Manchester United is delighted to announce it has agreed terms with Cardiff City for the transfer of Aarom Ramsey, subject to contract terms being agreed and the player passing a medical.'\n\n\"But the Reds aren't the only club in for the teenager. Cardiff have confirmed that 'three top Premier League teams' have made bids, with two given permission to speak to the Wales starlet.\"\n\nThe third club - or also-ran - was Everton and, 10 days later, Arsenal confirmed the signing of Ramsey. \"I recently met with Arsene Wenger and he was a big factor in my decision to join Arsenal,\" Ramsey said. It was not so much a big factor as the clincher.\n\nFerguson had already left Wilmslow for his annual holiday in the south of France and, while kept informed of developments, decided against interrupting his break and greeting Ramsey in person. Club captain Gary Neville, honing his fitness after recently recovering from a year-long injury spell, gave Ramsey a tour of Carrington but Wenger's personal touch swayed the teenager.\n\nWenger was in Switzerland covering Euro 2008 but arranged for Ramsey to be flown in on a private jet and convinced him to join Arsenal. \"I just felt a bit more wanted by Arsenal and by the boss,\" Ramsey later remarked.\n\nIt would be harsh to accuse Ferguson of complacency but he learnt from the error. When Arsenal and United vied for Chris Smalling in January 2010, the Scot telephoned Smalling's mother, Theresa, at her home in Chatham, Kent.\n\n\"He was just saying how impressed he was with Chris, how he’ll be well looked after and telling me about everything they’ve got up there,\" she said. \"I couldn’t believe it when Chris said about Manchester United, although I wish it was the Arsenal. I’m an Arsenal fan and Chris was when he was little. But I’m so proud.\" That was Ferguson's powers of persuasion.\n\nRamsey bugged him, though. \"He had a strong interest in how Aaron is doing because he was very close to signing him,\" Wales assistant Osian Roberts said in 2014. Ferguson did not sign another senior central midfielder after the domestic and European double in 2008 and his retirement coincided with Ramsey's standout season with Arsenal as he tallied 16 goals - including the FA Cup final winner - in 2013-14.\n\nEleven years on from the Ramsey collapse, United could have a free run at the Wales international who turns 28 on Boxing Day. Tottenham would perhaps relish some payback for Sol Campbell but City and Chelsea have quantity and quality in midfield, as do Liverpool,although Ramsey would arguably represent an upgrade on Jordan Henderson and the overrated James Milner turns 33 in January.\n\nRamsey is at an established age and Premier League proven, which ticks two vital boxes for Jose Mourinho, and available on a free in the summer, which ticks the Glazers' box. United lack a goalscoring midfielder to alleviate the burden on Paul Pogba, who only struck one more than the handy Marouane Fellaini last season. Ander Herrera is without a league goal in 18 months, Fred is yet to convince as a goalscoring threat while Nemanja Matic and Andreas Pereira are used in deep-lying roles. Ramsey scored 11 times for Arsenal last term.\n\nUnited might feel burnt from the Alexis Sanchez saga but Ramsey would command maybe half the Chilean's weekly salary and, for every Sanchez, there is a Robin van Persie, whom Ferguson reached out to in 2012 amid competition from City.\n\nHe learnt from his mistake."
