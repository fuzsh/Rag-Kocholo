        "text": "Aaron Ramsey and Laurent Koscielny have been labelled the best attacking midfielder and central defender respectively in the Premier League by Liverpool and Manchester United legends Steven Gerrard and Rio Ferdinand following Arsenal's win over Olympiacos in the Champions League on 9 December.\n\nThe Gunners completed a great escape and made it to the knockout phase of the elite European competition after their chances looked very bleak when they lost three of their opening four group games. But wins over Bayern Munich, Dinamo Zagreb and the Greek champions in the latter stages ensured their place in the last 16.\n\nRamsey, who recently returned to the first-team, has been restored to his preferred midfield position following an injury to Santi Cazorla, who is the first choice for Arsene Wenger to fill the deep lying midfielder's role alongside Francis Coquelin or Mathieu Flamini. The injury to the Spaniard, however, has given the Welshman a chance to reclaim his position after being frustrated at being played consistently on the right wing. The former Liverpool skipper feels that the former Cardiff City player is the best through the middle and has labelled him the best attacking midfielder in the league when in top form.\n\n\"Mentally I don't think he'll be happy himself playing out wide. He hasn't got the legs. His qualities are all in the middle,\" Gerrard said, as quoted by the Daily Mail.\n\n\"For me, when he's in that form he's the best attacking midfielder in the Premier League, so you've got to play your best players where they want to be, and I'm sure he'll want to be in the middle,\" the Reds legend added.\n\nFellow TV pundit Ferdinand echoed similar sentiments about Koscielny, who has been one of the most important players for the north London club this season, and was a rock at the back when Arsenal travelled to Greece for their must-win game against Olympiacos in the Champions League. Vincent Kompany is widely regarded as the best central defender in the English top flight, but the former United defender feels that the Belgian's lack of fitness is a drawback when compared to the French international defender.\n\n\"Koscielny for me, when he's on form I think he's the best defender in the league. Kompany's not fit enough consistently enough and he's turned into a real top class defender,\" Ferdinand said."
