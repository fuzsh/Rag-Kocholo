        "text": "Another day, another wild, whacky transfer rumour linking Liverpool and Jürgen Klopp to a midfielder playing somewhere in Europe.\n\nWe’ve had Denis Zakaria and Boubakary Soumare and a mooted Philippe Coutinho return (ha). Now, we have former Arsenal man and current Juventus wage-bill-anchor Aaron Ramsey.\n\nThe Italian side are reportedly ready to part ways with the ex-Arsenal captain in order to clean up their payroll just a season after adding him on a free transfer — though that was offset by a massive agent and signing on fee. Liverpool have been linked to a possible free or nominal transfer, with Juve’s top-brass looking to cull an inflated squad.\n\nRamsey has failed to hit the ground running in Serie A, though it’s not his fault alone. Maurizio Sarri has struggled in his first year in charge of the club, unable to find a system that can accommodate all of Juve’s fire-power up-front. He’s split time between his preferred, single-pivot, 4-3-3 system and a whole host of other looks, including a double-pivot, 4-2-3-1 look (there’s also been a rather frisky 4-2-2-2 that was solid in limited playing time).\n\nAs a result, Ramsey has had to toggle between a bunch of positions, lining up as the deepest man in the central three, as a part of a two-deep pairing, and, most surprisingly (and effectively), as a Trequetista behind the striker -- given a completely free role to Juventus’ creator in chief.\n\nLike the whole team under Sarri, Ramsey has failed to find any sort of rhythm. Bouncing between systems and roles is enough to sap the confidence from any player. Here’s where Ramsey has lined up this season by percentage:\n\n21 percent of the time as a right-sided number eight in a central three\n\n19 percent of the time as a number 10\n\n17 percent of the time as a deeper-lying midfielder on the right of a central two\n\n16 percent of the time pushed out to the right in a midfield four\n\n9 percent of the time as a deeper-lying midfielder on the left of a central two\n\nHe’s been all over the place, and not in an interesting, egalitarian, you-go-here-then-I-go-there, free-flowing way. In a disjointed, I’m-not-sure-where-your-best-position-is kind of way. And that’s with Ramsey playing fewer than 1,000 minutes for the club in all competitions — he has been subbed off in all but one game he has started this season. Oddly, that was a top of the table clash against title-challengers Inter Milan. Maurizio Sarri, man.\n\nHere’s the kicker, Ramsey’s reported salary is somewhere between 250k (!) and 400k (!!!), a massive sum for a player who is about to enter his post-prime and is clearly a player Sarri — who was drafted in by Juventus to overhaul the clubs reactive playing still — cannot quite figure out.\n\nWhy Liverpool would be interested, if indeed they are, is clear: Ramsey has experience in a high-press system as a number eight in a central three pairing; he is used to the grind of the Premier League; he is, by all accounts, a ruthless trainer and professional; he would be available super cheap, with Juventus having so many first-team players they’ve been unable to register them all in all of their competitions this season.\n\nAdd to that, the club are still negotiating with Gini Wijnaldum on a new long-term deal (dangling a Ramsey rumour out there helps with leverage), and are also set to lose Adam Lallana whenever it is the season ends.\n\nRamsey, in the abstract, makes sense. He has a little Lallana to his game, albeit with a little more oomph on the half-turn. Whereas Lallana is a glider, Ramsey is more speedboat, happy to play tippy-tappy, between-the-lines passes, but just as eager to get on the ball and move.\n\nWith Juventus, he has been stripped of all of his creative verve. He is credited with zero assists this season and just a solo expected assist.\n\nWorse still, his underlying numbers have cratered. Back in his Arsenal days, Ramsey was good for around 20 in xGChain, the single best measure of a player's influence on the game from an attacking perspective. xGChain is essentially a measure of how impactful any given player is on a possession to possession basis. Rather than just give a player credit for an expected goal or an expected assist, it attempts to credit players for the pass before the final pass, and the pass before that, and before that and so on.\n\nAt Arsenal, Ramsey averaged around 0.80 xGChain per 90 in the five years the data was collected. In his best season, 2015/16, he finished with an xGChain of 23.18. Despite registering just four assists that season, he was having a huge influence on Arsenal’s build-up play, and finished among the Premier League’s top creators. This season with Juventus, Ramsey has bottomed out with a career-worst 5.68 xGChain.\n\nShifting his role is part of that. As a number 10, he’s playing more of that Mario Götze role than the classic Riquelme one: clogging things up, leading the press, making smart runs that drag defenders one way and open up space for the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo. But even with those caveats, it’s a poor return. Given the surrounding talent, you or I could probably stumble into a four-plus xGChain.\n\nStill: Ramsey didn’t become a bad player overnight. He just hasn't fit in the current Juventus ecosystem. He will assuredly leave Juventus this summer. Liverpool will be linked because a deal makes some sense and that’s what happens when high-profile players seek a return to the Premier League (see: Coutinho, Emre Can and any number of other players). And it's plausible, if Ramsey wants to continue to play at the top, top level, that he might take a wage cut (at the very least, Juve will likely have to pay a portion of his salary wherever he winds up).\n\nBut while a deal makes some sense in the abstract, a combination of the finances involved, Ramsey’s age, the lack of resale value, patchy injury record, and where he’s at in his development curve should make it a no-go."
