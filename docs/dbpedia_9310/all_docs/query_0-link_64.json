        "text": "Juventus have confirmed they are interested in signing Aaron Ramsey when the Arsenal midfielder’s contract expires at the end of the season.\n\nFabio Paratici, the Juventus sporting director, said the club is “attentive” to Ramsey’s situation and praised the midfielder as a “great player”.\n\nAs of the start of this month, Ramsey is able to negotiate and sign a pre-contract agreement with a foreign club.\n\nIt has been reported that Bayern Munich and Inter Milan are among the clubs who have also taken an interest in Ramsey, and Paratici said Juventus were not only side looking to secure the Welshman’s services for next season.\n\n“He is a great player, he is in a great team like Arsenal and he has played at high levels for many years,” Paratici told Sky in Italy. “His contract is going to expire and we are alert to all market situations, it’s our duty, so we are attentive to him.\n\n“This is all to be verified, for now he is an Arsenal player. We are certainly not the only ones in the market.”\n\nArsenal expect Ramsey to stay in north London until the end of the season as they are unlikely to find a buyer who is willing to pay a large enough transfer fee now, rather than waiting to sign the midfielder for free in the summer.\n\nIf he were to move to Turin, the 28-year-old would become the latest in a series of high-profile free signings that Juventus have made in recent years.\n\nThis summer they signed German midfielder Emre Can on a free deal from Liverpool, while the likes of Dani Alves and Sami Khedira have both been recruited at the end of their contracts in previous transfer windows.\n\nMeanwhile, Ozil’s agent has said the German has no interest in leaving Arsenal in the winter window.\n\nOzil has struggled for form this season and has been used sparingly by Emery in recent weeks. He was dropped from the squad for “tactical reasons” when Arsenal played Tottenham Hotspur in the Carabao Cup last month and has struggled to adapt to Emery’s methods.\n\n“Mesut signed a new contract last January because he saw his future at Arsenal and nothing has changed in his mind,” Dr Erkut Sogut told Goal. “He wants to stay for the duration of that contract and maybe even longer.\n\n“In the last year, there has been enormous upheaval for everybody at the club and the first half of this season has not been perfect for Mesut.\n\n\"He has suffered from injuries and illness, and is working hard to adapt to the different system employed by head coach Unai Emery.\n\n“This may take time, but Mesut will give everything he has to help make it work and bring success to Arsenal.”"
