        "text": "Atletico Madrid twice fought back from behind to earn a point in an entertaining 2-2 draw with Villarreal in their LaLiga season opener on Monday.\n\nForward Arnaut Danjuma gave the hosts an 18th-minute lead but Atletico hit back within two minutes as Marcos Llorente capped a lightning counterattack.\n\nDiego Simeone's team fell behind for the second time when Jan Oblak failed to claim a deep cross in the 37th minute, with the ball deflecting off the back of captain Koke and into the net.\n\nBut forward Alexander Sorloth, making his Atletico debut following an outstanding 2023-24 season with Villarreal, came back to haunt the Yellow Submarine with a second equaliser.\n\nSorloth, who finished one goal shy of LaLiga's Golden Boot winner Artem Dovbyk last term, scored with a towering header six minutes into first-half stoppage time, with a quieter second half passing without further incident.\n\nData Debrief: Sorloth stands alone\n\nDespite a trip to his former club representing a tricky first Atleti outing for Sorloth, he picked up where he left off in a brilliant 2023-24 campaign.\n\nHis goal was his 18th in LaLiga in 2024, more than any other player has scored in one of Europe's top five leagues, with Jonathan David and Harry Kane in joint-second with 15 apiece.\n\nAtleti's attack will be further boosted when former Manchester City forward Julian Alvarez gets up to speed.\n\nHe was limited to a 17-minute substitute appearance on Monday, only completing two passes and committing two fouls in a quiet outing.\n\nTottenham boss Ange Postecoglou was left frustrated by his side's lack of ruthless edge as they were denied in a 1-1 draw against Leicester City on Monday.\n\nSpurs dominated for large periods in their Premier League opener at the King Power Stadium but had only Pedro Porro's first-half opener to show for their efforts.\n\nJamie Vardy's second-half equaliser punished wasteful Spurs as debutant Dominic Solanke, Brennan Johnson and Richarlison all missed great chances for the visitors.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Sport after the game, a disgruntled Postecoglou said: \"It was a disappointing outcome for us.\n\n\"I thought we were excellent first half and controlled the game. Really dominant with our football but just wasteful in front of goal and the same in the second half and when that happens you keep the opposition in the game.\n\n\"We created chances and weren't ruthless enough at other times lacking composure. It's stuff we need to fix.\n\n\"When you are so dominant you need to make sure it is reflected by the scoreline.\"\n\nSteve Cooper earned a point in his first game as Leicester boss since replacing now Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca in pre-season.\n\nIt was 37-year-old and Foxes stalwart Vardy who did the damage, even though he missed a big chunk of pre-season due to injury.\n\nCooper said it was not a difficult decision to start Leicester's long-term talisman after a conversation a few days ago.\n\n\"It was a straightforward decision,\" he told Sky Sports.\n\n\"Three days ago we were without an experienced striker. He just showed so much desire to play.\n\n\"Had it been on Saturday he probably wouldn't have played but luckily it wasn't. He did what he does.\"\n\nJuventus beat newly promoted Como 3-0 in their Serie A opener at the Allianz Stadium on Monday as new coach Thiago Motta enjoyed a dream competitive debut with the club.\n\nForward Samuel Mbangula put Juve in front in the 23rd minute with a fine solo effort, driving infield before firing the ball into the bottom corner.\n\nThe Bianconeri then extended their lead in first-half stoppage time through winger Timothy Weah, who lashed home from a Kenan Yildiz cutback as the ball bounced in off the inside of the bar.\n\nYoungster Andrea Cambiaso then added a third from distance just before full-time after Dusan Vlahovic had gone close on several occasions.\n\nJuve, who finished third behind champions Inter and Milan last season to secure their return to the Champions League, next travel to Verona on August 26.\n\nData Debrief: Motta's men dominate\n\nJuventus' victory was their 60th on the opening matchday of a Serie A season, the most of any club in the competition's history. That includes eight wins in their last nine such games (one draw).\n\nWhile hopes were high that Como – under the management of Cesc Fabregas – could take the game to their hosts, Motta's side were in control throughout.\n\nThey did not concede a single shot on target for the second time in Serie A this calendar year, previously doing so in a goalless draw with Milan in April."
