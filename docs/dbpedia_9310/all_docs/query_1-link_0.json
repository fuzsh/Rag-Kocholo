        "text": "Biography\n\nA versatile midfielder with a huge presence, technical ability and a knack for finishing: Aaron Ramsey (31) has worked wonders for Arsenal in the Premier League, with whom he played 371 games (65 goals) between 2008 and 2019, and won 3 Cups (2014, 2015, 2017).\n\nThe man who was Wales' youngest ever captain (at just 20), who also had spells with Cardiff and Nottingham Forest in the UK, had been playing for Juventus since 2019. He made 69 appearances for the Old Lady, before being loaned out to Glasgow Rangers for the first six months of 2022, playing in a Europa League final and winning a Scottish Cup.\n\nA seasoned international, Ramsey has 74 caps for the Dragons, two Euro appearances (2016, 2020), including one in which he was named in the tournament's 11-man squad in 2016, when Wales were semi-finalists.\n\nThe midfielder, who also has 81 European Cup appearances to his name (65 in the Champions League), signed for Le Gym on 1 August 2022 and has made an impressive start to life in his new shirt. Ramsey came on as a substitute against Toulouse on the opening day of Ligue 1 on 7 August 2022 and scored his only goal of the season at the Stadium (1-1)."
