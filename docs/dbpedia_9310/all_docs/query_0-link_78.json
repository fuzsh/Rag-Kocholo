        "text": "Aaron Ramsey is yet to return to club side OGC Nice after being knocked out of the World Cup with Wales.\n\nWales suffered an early elimination in Qatar as they drew their group stage opener against the USA before losing to Iran and England. Ramsey featured in all three fixtures of a hugely disappointing tournament for the Dragons.\n\nAnd it appears the former Arsenal midfielder is still yet to come to terms with the regret of bowing out at the first hurdle in Wales’ first World Cup qualification in 64 years.\n\nREAD MORE: Shakhtar Donetsk reject £55m bid for Mykhailo Mudryk after he watched Arsenal game\n\nNice manager Lucien Favre revealed ahead of the Ligue 1 clash with Lens on Thursday that he has had no contact with Ramsey. He cited the 32-year-old’s absence as being down to the nature of Wales’ exit still haunting him.\n\nFavre explained: \"No, he didn't come back [to training]. I think the World Cup was hard for him to digest. We'll see after.\n\n\"No [I haven't spoken to him]. I could, but... There you go. I answered... He was very disappointed with the World Cup. He takes his time to really recover.\"\n\nDo you think Aaron Ramsey can still revive his career? Let us know in the comments section.\n\nRamsey’s career has hit somewhat of a stumbling block since his move away from Arsenal in 2019. Having joined Italian giants Juventus, he failed to stamp a claim in the starting eleven as a result of changing managers and injuries.\n\nHe spent last season on loan with Rangers, missing the crucial penalty in the Europa League final defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt, before signing for Nice.\n\nThe former Gunners star has started just five of the French club’s 15 league matches this campaign, but appeared in all but three of their games before the World Cup break. He has one goal which came on his debut.\n\nREAD NEXT:"
