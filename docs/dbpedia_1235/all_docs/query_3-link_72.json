        "text": "The Peruvian government on Sunday pardoned on medical grounds former president Alberto Fujimori, who has been serving a 25-year sentence for human rights abuses.\n\nThe office of President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski said Fujimori, 79, was suffering from \"a progressive, degenerative and incurable disease\" and that his imprisonment posed a serious risk to his health.\n\nFujimori, who is suffering from a number of ailments, is unlikely to return to the center stage of Peruvian politics but is expected to retain some clout.\n\nThe humanitarian pardon came after Kuczynski survived an impeachment bid backed by the main opposition party, which is led by Keiko Fujimori, the former leader's eldest daughter.\n\nHer younger brother, Kenji, a lawmaker also belonging to the party, abstained in the vote, fueling speculation that the president and Kenji may have negotiated the pardon for Kenji's father.\n\nKenji tweeted Sunday, \"On behalf of the Fujimori family, I want to thank President Kuczynski for his magnanimous gesture.\"\n\nBut the decision is set to enrage families of victims of human rights abuse during Fujimori's rule and international human rights organizations.\n\nFujimori, who been serving his sentence in a police facility in a suburb of Lima, is likely to stay for a while in a hospital where he was taken on Saturday due to a drop in blood pressure stemming from arrhythmia.\n\nFujimori, who was born in Peru to Japanese immigrants, was elected president in 1990. He was lauded for rebuilding the economy and suppressing leftist guerrilla uprisings.\n\nHe also led an armed operation to free hostages from the Tupac Amaru insurgency during a siege of the Japanese ambassador's official residence in Lima in 1996-1997.\n\nIn 2000, Fujimori fled to Japan, following a corruption allegation against his aide and was later dismissed as president by the Congress.\n\nAfter traveling to Chile in 2005, he was extradited to Peru two years later and convicted of involvement in human rights atrocities that claimed the lives of civilians.\n\nAfter undergoing six operations for tongue cancer, Fujimori had complained of dizziness and pain and was repeatedly hospitalized."
