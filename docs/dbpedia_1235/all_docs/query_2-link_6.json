        "text": "Presidency\n\nIn 1989, as terrorism and hyperinflation plagued Peru, Fujimori began a bid for the presidency as the head of a new party, Cambio 90 (“Change 90”). His successful grassroots campaign quickly garnered attention because of Fujimori’s Japanese ancestry and his populist rhetoric, including criticism of the economic shock tactics advocated by the conservative candidate, novelist Mario Vargas Llosa. In June 1990 Fujimori defeated Vargas Llosa in a runoff election with 56.5 percent of the vote. However, on August 8, less than two weeks after taking office, Fujimori instituted austerity measures as harsh as those he earlier had decried, including raising the price of gasoline by 3,000 percent. The policy—popularly known as “Fujishock”—wiped out inflation but caused immediate layoffs and hardships among the poor.\n\nIn April 1992, increasingly frustrated with the legislature, which supported few of his programs, Fujimori staged an autogolpe (“self-administered coup”) with military support, declaring a state of emergency, dissolving Congress, and calling for a new constitution (promulgated in 1993). Fujimori’s political allies subsequently won a majority of legislative seats, which allowed the president to rule nearly unopposed. On the economic front, he carried out neoliberal policies such as privatizing state-owned mines and utility companies. Fujimori’s government also prosecuted an anti-insurgency campaign on various fronts, including arming villagers and conducting secretive military trials of suspected terrorists. Fujimori claimed credit for the program’s successes, including the capture in 1992 of Abimael Guzmán Reynoso, the leader of the Shining Path (Sendero Luminoso) rebel movement, and the storming in 1997 of the Japanese ambassador’s residence in Lima, where dozens of hostages had been held by members of the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement.\n\nIn the mid-1990s Fujimori’s wife, Susana Higuchi, publicly denounced him as corrupt and undemocratic and sought to run against him in the 1995 elections. Fujimori, however, had earlier passed a law prohibiting immediate relatives of the president from seeking the office, and she was ultimately barred from entering the race. He named his eldest daughter, Keiko Fujimori, as the country’s new first lady and easily won a second term with 64 percent of the vote. Meanwhile, Vladimiro Montesinos, head of the country’s secret police and Fujimori’s closest adviser, increased his influence in the military and used the country’s secret police to infiltrate opposition political parties, bribe legislators and electoral officials, muzzle the media, embezzle and redirect government funds, and carry out human rights abuses, including illegal arrests and torture. Many Peruvians subsequently accused Fujimori of condoning those acts and of destroying relevant evidence, though he denied the charges.\n\nFujimori sought a controversial third term in 2000, after dismissing high justices who had declared his candidacy unconstitutional. The main opposition candidate, Alejandro Toledo, withdrew from the final round of the election after claiming electoral fraud. Thus, Fujimori won the election unopposed but faced condemnation from the Organization of American States, the United States government, and an increasing number of Peruvians. His government crumbled in late 2000 when a video was released that showed Montesinos bribing a congressman. Amid growing allegations of corruption, Fujimori left Peru, eventually arriving in Japan, where he announced his resignation. Peru’s legislature, however, rejected it and formally voted Fujimori out of office, declaring him “morally unfit.”\n\nLegal issues: trials and convictions\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

Meanwhile, Fujimori continued to influence Peruvian affairs from abroad. In 2005 he traveled to Chile in hopes of contesting the 2006 presidential election—though he was prohibited from seeking office until 2011. Upon his arrival he was arrested at Peru’s request. His petition to appear on the 2006 ballot was later rejected by Peru’s election tribunal. (Keiko, however, was elected to Congress in the 2006 legislative elections by more votes than any other legislator.) In 2007, while still imprisoned in Chile, Fujimori unsuccessfully ran for a seat in Japan’s Diet (parliament).\n\nIn September 2007 Chile’s Supreme Court approved his extradition to Peru, ending a protracted legal battle. A day after the ruling, Fujimori was returned to his home country, where he faced charges of corruption, kidnapping, and murder. In December 2007 he was convicted for ordering an illegal search of the home of Montesinos’s wife in 2000 and was fined and sentenced to six years in prison for abuse of power. Fujimori also continued to stand trial in Lima for the more serious charges of human rights violations related to his time in office. In April 2009, following a 15-month trial, Fujimori was found guilty of ordering military death squads to carry out killings and kidnappings during his presidency, and he was sentenced to 25 years in prison. A third conviction came in July 2009, when Peru’s Supreme Court found Fujimori guilty of channeling millions of dollars of state funds to Montesinos while he was president. Fujimori was then sentenced to seven and a half more years in prison. In September 2009, in his fourth trial since he was extradited to Peru, Fujimori pleaded guilty to charges of illegal wiretapping and bribery, and he was sentenced to six additional years in prison.\n\nPeruvian Pres. Pedro Pablo Kuczynski granted Fujimori a medical pardon in December 2017, and he was released from prison to receive hospital care. Peruvian lawmakers criticized the move, as did human rights groups, who noted that a number of Fujimori’s convictions had been handed down by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACHR), a body that Kuczynski lacked the authority to override. Fujimori’s pardon came just days after Kuczynski narrowly survived an impeachment attempt by opposition lawmakers. A political faction led by Fujimori’s son Kenji abstained from that vote, causing the effort to fall just short of the necessary supermajority, and the pardon was seen by many as an act of reciprocity. In February 2018 a Peruvian court ordered Fujimori to stand trial for the killing of six farmers in 1992, an offense that the court ruled was not covered by the pardon. In October the country’s Supreme Court overturned his medical pardon, and immediately thereafter he was admitted to the hospital. However, following a medical board review in January 2019, he was discharged and returned to prison. The controversy surrounding Fujimori’s status was back in the news in March 2022, when Peru’s Constitutional Court voted 4–3 to reinstate his pardon. The administration of Pres. Pedro Castillo almost immediately moved to appeal that decision to the IACHR, which quickly ruled against the release of Fujimori, pending further review. Despite the decision by the IACHR, the Constitutional Court ruled again in November 2023 that Fujimori’s pardon should be reinstated. When the lower court in the city of Ica that had been ordered to effect Fujimori’s release refused to do so, averring that it lacked the authority to take that action, the matter was returned to the Constitutional Court, which, in the first week of December, called for the former president’s immediate release.\n\nThe Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica"
