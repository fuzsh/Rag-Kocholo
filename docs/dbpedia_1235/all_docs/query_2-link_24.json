One of the siblings, Kenji, said his breakaway group would support the government from now on.\n\nSeven lawmakers quit the party after Kenji and two others were expelled, leaving Popular Force with 61 of the 130 seats in Congress. Kenji told reporters the group had been mistreated by the party’s leadership after they abstained in last month’s vote to impeach President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski , averting his ouster."
