        "text": "Significance\n\nJulio Guzman Caceres is a strong tip for the presidency in 2021. Having been excluded from the 2016 presidential race on a technicality, he is quietly seeking to build up support across the country for his centrist Partido Morado. The two-round system of elections tends to favour centrist positions in ideologically polarised contests."
