        "text": "With three presidents in one week, and a history of political\n\ncorruption, can Peru’s fragile democracy stay afloat?\n\nIn a recent unfolding of events, Peru’s citizens have taken to the streets in response to the obstruction of justice and removal of former president, Martin Vizcarra.\n\nOn November 9, Peru’s Congress impeached and convicted Vizcarra on the grounds of “moral unfitness,” over unproven allegations that he “accepted more than $600,000 in bribes while he was a regional governor years ago.” (Martin, 2020) This round of impeachment proceedings was led by Congressional Speaker Manuel Merino, who along with most lawmakers, despised Vizcarra for his attempts to pass anti-corruption legislation.\n\nJust one day after unseating Vizcarra, Congress elected Merino as president. His position was short lived, however, only remaining in office for five days before resigning due to public pressure. His appointment sparked outrage in 3 million Peruvians who could not forget this all-too-familiar pattern of ousting democratic politicians and replacing them with corrupt officials.\n\nBut for those who are not savvy in Andean politics, a quick look into Peru’s past can explain why the country is still struggling to retain its democracy.\n\nA History of Political Corruption\n\nPeru has had a lengthy journey towards democratization. For over 40 years, the country has pushed and pulled against the tides of corruption and its people have tirelessly battled for a more honest, transparent, and effective government.\n\nPeru’s constitution was born from the authoritarian mind of Albert Fujimori- a president who in 1993 set out to rewrite the rules to prevent crooked leaders like himself from being held accountable. Since then, this controversial constitution has been unsuccessful in preventing the extreme amounts of political upheaval that has plagued the country. (Aquino, 2020)\n\nThe first account of major corruption took place under President Fujimori’s rule from 1990 to 2000. Although this was delayed, the government sentenced him to 25 years of prison due to human rights violations during the time that he served.\n\nAnother instance involves Alejandro Toledo, who served as president from 2001 to 2006. Currently, he is “fighting extradition from the United States over allegations that he received $20 million” from a Brazilian firm called Odebrecht; under Peruvian law, it is unconstitutional for a president to accept monetary contributions from foreign entities. (Tegel, 2019)\n\nJust as history repeats itself, so do the actions of bad politicians. Following in Mr. Toledo’s footsteps, President Kuczynski also faced corruption charges in 2018 from his business ties to Odebrecht. To survive impeachment, Kuczynski negotiated a pardon for former president Fujimori, but was unable to maneuver another set of impeachment proceedings when videos were leaked showing Kuczynki buying the votes of legislators. That’s when his vice president, Martín Vizcarra, ascended to the presidency.\n\nVizcarra Shows Promise of Rebuilding Democracy\n\nVizcarra was elected in 2016 after gaining support from many Peruvians who were tired of the political corruption that had plagued the country for far too long. After two years in office, Vizcarra’s repeated attempts to pass anti-corruption policies proved unsuccessful as congressmen continuously blocked his measures.\n\nAfter exhausting all his plans to bring progress to Peru, Vizcarra completely abolished the presiding Congress in 2019 and called for elections to establish a new political body. Most Peruvians were in support of eliminating the corrupt lawmakers that sat in the nation’s capital.\n\nBut according to Peru’s constitution, Vizcarra had overstepped his presidential powers, so the previous congress remained intact. Officials originally planned to remove Vizcarra after this unorthodox move, but the Vice President – the only person eligible to take the position – resigned from office.\n\nJust two months ago, Speaker Merino brought forth official impeachment proceedings, charging Vizcarra on the grounds of “permanent moral incapacity.” Although Merino accused Vizcarra of illegally signing a contract that was a conflict of interest, these allegations lacked strong evidence, and the impeachment was dropped. (Ko, 2020)\n\nParty Polarization\n\nBut a history of unethical leaders is not the only thing plaguing the country. Partisan polarization has become a massive contributor in accelerating the backsliding of Peru’s democracy.\n\nPresident Fujimori left a party that had and still has a widely enthusiastic base. That party is recognized in Peru as the Fujimori-Conservative party and is mostly characterized as traditionalists that oppose equal gender rights and help for the poor, and generally support strong capitalistic tendencies.\n\nIn 2016, President Vizcarra narrowly beat Keiko Fujimori, the daughter of the preceding president, by less than two percentage points. Opponents to his party quickly rose in both society and Congress, ultimately undermining his legitimacy and functionality as President. Since his election, Peru has mimicked what America has undergone; a political trench, hostile enough to divide the right and the left.\n\nThe Tumultuous Present\n\nThe current president, Francisco Sagasti, will remain in office until the official presidential elections in April of 2021.Although the state of the nation is still submerged in confusion and chaos, Sagasti’s swearing-in was seen as a compromise for the protestors, as he had been a“relatively obscure politician” who “declined to support the impeachment proceedings against Vizcarra.” (Ko, 2020)\n\nBut in five short months, any peace that settles over the country will likely dissipate as the choice of presidential candidates carry negative connotations from past leaders. Those running include Daniel Urresti, a former military general accused but not convicted of killing a famous news reporter; Kenji Fujimori, son of Alberto Fujimori; and Antauro Humala, a retired major in the armed forces who served jail time for an unsuccessful coup attempt he staged in 2005. (Otis, 2015)\n\nWith these bleak options, Peruvians will yet again be faced with choosing the “least evil” candidate to run their fragile democracy- hopefully not into the ground.\n\nThe old political circles of power continue to remain influential; but as tensions heighten, the candidates will be forced to confront the emerging power of Peru’s unsatisfied citizens. (Ko, 2020)\n\nOnly “28 percent of Peruvians say they are satisfied with their democracy,” so relying on safeguards and institutions to uphold fairness and equality is no longer an option. (Levitsky, 2014) It will be up to the Peruvians engaged in social movements to produce a leader and a party that can represent them and protect their crumbling democracy.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nHISTORICAL OUTLINE OF CONGRESS.
