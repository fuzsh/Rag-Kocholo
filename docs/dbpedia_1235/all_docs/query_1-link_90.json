        "text": "LIMA: Former Peruvian president Alberto Fujimori -- aging and legally embattled -- will stand in the South American countryâs 2026 elections, his daughter announced Sunday.\n\nâMy father and I have talked and decided together that he will be the presidential candidate,â Keiko Fujimori, leader of the South American countryâs main right-wing party, said.\n\nPresident from 1990 to 2000, the elder Fujimori, 85, ruled Peru with an iron fist, leading a military campaign that largely defeated the Shining Path, a Maoist guerrilla group.\n\nTo some, he is remembered for bolstering economic growth through his neo-liberal policies while crushing the rebels.\n\nOthers recall his ruthless, authoritarian governing style.\n\nHe was sent to prison in 2009 over massacres committed by army death squads in 1991 and 1992 in which 25 people, including a child, were killed in supposed anti-terrorist operations in his Shining Path campaign.\n\nFujimori was released last year for humanitarian reasons, though it is unclear if he is eligible to stand for election because of the conviction.\n\nHe was pardoned âfor humanitarian reasons, but it has not eliminated his criminal responsibility or the very nature of the sentence,â Ernesto Blume, a former judge on Peruâs Constitutional Court, told broadcaster Canal N.\n\nIn 2018, an aging Fujimori revealed that doctors detected a tumor in his lungs.\n\nLast month, it was disclosed that he was in intensive care after breaking his hip in a fall at home.\n\nKeiko Fujimori, who leads the right-wing Popular Force party, recently said her father -- who also disclosed he was suffering from a tongue tumor -- was strong enough to embark on another presidential run.\n\nâWhen we talk about politics, I see his will to live and I trust he will recover,â she told Peruvian daily El Comercio."
