        "text": "LIMA, Peru — Alberto Fujimori, the former Peruvian dictator imprisoned for human rights abuses but then pardoned last year, was ordered back to prison on Wednesday, reigniting debate over the fate of one of the region’s most contentious figures.\n\nHuman rights advocates hailed the ruling, but Mr. Fujimori’s defiant supporters and his politically powerful daughter, Keiko, gathered outside his house on Wednesday to condemn it.\n\n“This is persecution against my family,” Ms. Fujimori said.\n\nIt was the latest dramatic turn for Mr. Fujimori, 80, who ruled as a dictator in the 1990s after suspending the Constitution, only to land in a prison cell when he tried to stage a political comeback in the early 2000s.\n\nHe was freed last December, but his fate was reversed again on Wednesday, with the Supreme Court issuing orders for his arrest “so he would be returned to penitentiary,” according to a statement released on Twitter."
