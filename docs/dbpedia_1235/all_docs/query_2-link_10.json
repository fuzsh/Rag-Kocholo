        "text": "The youngest son of former Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori said on Wednesday that he would form a new political group to support the executive branch as President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski and his center-right government grow increasingly isolated.\n\nKenji Fujimori, whose popularity is surging, said he and nine other lawmakers had formally split from the right-wing opposition party led by his sister Keiko Fujimori, erasing the absolute majority in Congress it once used to oust ministers from Kuczynski's government.\n\nThe division came after the faction broke party ranks last month to keep Kuczynski from being removed from office in the wake of a graft scandal. Kuczynski granted Alberto Fujimori a pardon three days later on medical grounds, helping Kenji fulfill a long-standing goal to free his father."
