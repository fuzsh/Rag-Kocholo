        "text": "LIMA, Peru — In his first comments since being released from the hospital on a medical pardon that drew wide condemnation, former President Alberto Fujimori of Peru called on the country to set aside its “grudges” in order to unite.\n\nMr. Fujimori, 79, made the comments on Twitter on Saturday amid an unabating furor over President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski’s decision to free him. The former strongman had served 12 years of a 25-year prison sentence for graft and human rights crimes.\n\nOn Twitter, he reflected on the new chapter in his life and urged Peruvians to come together to fight violence and crime.\n\n“In the first hours of this new stage of my life, several dreams invade me constantly, and I would like to share them,” Mr. Fujimori said in a tweet. “I wish for a Peru without grudges, with all of us working toward a superior objective.”\n\nThen, in an apparent appeal to his right-wing political base, he added: “We’ll be a country in which security is regained and violence is eliminated. We can fulfill these goals by setting aside special interests and opportunism. UNITED WE CAN ACHIEVE THEM!”\n\nIt was unclear if Mr. Fujimori’s remarks were a hint that he planned to play a more active role in Peruvian politics. But the message rippled across Peru, where Mr. Fujimori is a deeply divisive figure.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
