        "text": "Career\n\nIn in 1962 he returned to La Molina as a professor of mathematics.\n\nIn 1984, shortly after becoming dean of the Faculty of Sciences at La Molina, that university's assembly elected him rector (president) of the school for a five-year term. The rectors of Peru's 30 other national universities chose Fujimori president of their council for the period 1987-1989.\n\nTwo years before the 1990 general election, Fujimori and several other politically independent professionals and businessmen founded the Cambio 90 (Change 90) movement as a vehicle for their participation in the contest. Meanwhile, Fujimori increased his public visibility as the host of \"Getting Together, \" a radio program devoted to public affairs. In this capacity he demonstrated his awareness of important issues and a notable ability to foster understanding among guests with opposing views.\n\nThe victor in Peru's 1990 presidential election would face a nearly impossible challenge. A $20-billion foreign debt had not been serviced regularly in several years. Peru's domestic economy was near collapse. A ten-year war with the Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path) guerrillas, fanatical Maoists, had taken 20, 000 lives. International drug traffickers had established a powerful presence within the country. Nevertheless, nine candidates vied for the presidency.\n\nFor several months prior to the vote, internationally renowned novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, representing the conservative Democratic Front (Fredemo) coalition, was heavily favored to win. He seemed likely to trounce his mainly leftist challengers and achieve the 50 percent plurality required for direct election in the April 8 first round of balloting. But he frightened many citizens with his plan to attack the huge budget deficit and 3, 500 percent inflation with a quick \"shock therapy, \" which included the elimination of subsidies for staple foods, fuel, and utilities, and the firing of thousands of government workers. In the final months of the campaign Fujimori, a self-styled centrist whose \"plan\" consisted of little more than the slogan \"honesty, hard work, and technology, \" surged from an obscure four percent standing in the polls to within three points of Vargas Llosa's 27 percent first-place finish, forcing a runoff.\n\nIn the second contest Fujimori charged that Vargas Llosa's \"shock\" would place too large a burden on poor Peruvians. He promised more gradual remedies for the nation's economic ills. Fujimori also criticized his opponent's emphasis on military solutions to the guerrilla and drug problems. The Cambio 90 candidate proposed to undercut support for the insurgents through economic development and to wean peasants away from the cultivation of coca (the source of cocaine) with a program of crop substitution.\n\nOn the June 8 election day, Fujimori won most of the votes that had gone to candidates eliminated in the first round, garnering 56. 5 percent of the total to 34 percent for Vargas Llosa. Analysts noted that the light-skinned members of Peru's elite and middle-class voted heavily for Vargas Llosa, while Fujimori was favored by working-class citizens of Indian ancestry. Although himself a Roman Catholic, Fujimori received crucial support from the nation's small evangelical Christian community, whose members canvassed for him, missionary-like, door to door.\n\nPresident Fujimori was inaugurated on July 28, 1990. He asserted in his inaugural address that he had inherited a \"disaster\" from his predecessor, Alan Garcia Pérez. The new administration quickly introduced its own economic \"shock. \" The prices of many basic foods doubled and tripled overnight, while the cost of gasoline (which had been subsidized at seven cents per gallon) increased nearly 30-fold. Rioting occurred throughout the country, and Peru's major labor federations staged general strikes. Fujimori's popularity plummeted along with the purchasing power of civilians. But the spiraling rate of inflation slowed, allowing the administration to implement its other programs for economic recovery. Fujimori's autogolpe (self-coup) abolished Peru's constitution, Congress, and Supreme Court. It was after this point that he seized complete power.\n\nNicknamed \"El Chinito\" (The Little Asian) by the public, the diminutive and soft-spoken Fujimori held a black belt in karate and traced his ancestry to Samurai warriors. Fujimori won the election in 1995 by a landslide.\n\nIn December of 1996 Peru and Fujimori became the center of attention once again as hundreds of foreign dignitaries were held hostage in the Japanese ambassador's mansion by an armed group of Tupac Amaru guerrillas. The hostage stance lasted for months, with the entire world waiting for a move to be made. On April 22, 1997, the seize ended when Peruvian commandos stormed the mansion. The resulting gunfire and ambush freed all remaining hostages and killed the 14 guerillas.\n\nAccording to an operation conducted by intelligence agency Vladimiro Montesinos, between the years 1996 and 2000, Fujimori administration had apparently forced around 300, 000 women to undergo sterilisation to control the growing population in Peru.\n\nFujimori contested presidential elections for the third time in the year 2000. Though he managed to win the contest by a really narrow margin and formed the government, the people protested against his administration. Hence, he was forced to step down.\n\nIn 2009, Fujimori was tried by a Peruvian court for several instances of human rights violation. After being proven guilty, the court slapped Fujimori with an imprisonment of 25 years. He was also found guilty of bribing ‘Vladimiro Montesinos’ to expose rich businessmen and bureaucrats, for which the court extended his imprisonment period by seven more years."
