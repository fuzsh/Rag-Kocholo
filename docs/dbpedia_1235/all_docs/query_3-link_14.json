        "text": "FUJIMORI was established in 1970 in Sangenjaya, Setagaya, Tokyo. FUJIMORI is a jewelry brand that is centered in a workshop and produces jewelry with a focus on the craftsman style, in which artisans consistently produce jewelry throughout the entire process.\n\nKenji Fujimori, the founder of FUJIMORI, trained under a Japanese artisan to master the art of metal sculpting. He furthered his studies at Ã‰cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris, opened his workshop, and started making his original jewelry when he returned to Japan. Since 2005, the company is managed by the second generation entrepreneur Takashi Fujimori, who studied jewelry design and production in Florence, Italy, and has received numerous design awards."
