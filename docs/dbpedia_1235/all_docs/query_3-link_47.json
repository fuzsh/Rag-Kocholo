        "text": "DISCUSSION\n\nData on drug safety during pregnancy are largely restricted to the cumulative experience of patients and physicians and are often limited to case reports. Previous investigations of pregnancy outcomes in women with IBD are mainly limited to European populations. To our knowledge, this is the first Asian multicenter cross sectional study examining the outcomes of pregnancies in IBD patients treated with anti-TNF and/or thiopurine therapy.\n\nBecause pregnancy outcome is highly influenced by age,6 the ages of the patients were compared. There was no significant difference among 4 groups. In addition, disease activity has been associated with negative fetal outcomes in a number of reports.7,8,9,10,11 Meta-analysis has shown that disease activity at conception affects disease course during pregnancy.12 Thus, to determine the severity of disease in each patient, the Harveyâ€“Bradshaw index was calculated for those with CD and the partial Mayo score was calculated for those with UC at the time of conception. There were no significant differences between all 4 groups of patients. LBW and the incidences of congenital malformations and childhood diseases did not increase in women who were exposed to anti-TNF or thiopurines during their pregnancies compared to those who were not exposed. The average gestational age of babies in the 4 groups, Bio-IM-, Bio+IM-, Bio-IM+, and Bio+IM+ were 30.0 weeks, 30.9 weeks, 30.7 weeks, and 31.9 weeks, respectively.\n\nIn Akbari's study, thiopurine exposure in women with IBD was associated with preterm birth.4 In our study, there was no increase in the incidence of preterm birth in pregnancies exposed to thiopurines. However, it is possible that we could not detect small differences because of the small sample size of this study. The incidences of LBW, preterm birth, and congenital malformation are 6.4%, 2.1%, and 1%-4% respectively in the normal population.13 In our analysis, the incidences of LBW, preterm birth, and congenital malformation in those who received either anti-TNF-alpha antibody or thiopurines were 17% (7/41), 7.3% (3/41), and 2.4% (1/41). On the other hand, the incidences of LBW, preterm birth, and congenital malformations in the group who had not received anti-TNF-alpha antibodies or thiopurines were 24% (7/29), 6.9% (2/29), and 6.5% (2/31). Incidences of LBW and preterm birth were higher in our study groups than in the general population regardless of the use of anti-TNF-alpha antibody or thiopurines, suggesting that IBD itself seems to be an independent risk factor for an abnormal outcome concerning LBW and preterm birth. Incidence of congenital malformation was comparable between the general population, those who received either anti-TNF-alpha antibodies or thiopurines, and those who did not receive anti-TNF-alpha antibody or thiopurines. Thus, we could not detect any proof of exposure to anti-TNF-alpha antibody or thiopurines being a risk factor for LBW, preterm birth, and congenital malformations. Our data support that medical maintenance treatment should be continued during pregnancy to avoid relapses.\n\nIn our analysis, spontaneous abortion occurred more commonly in the group exposed to anti-TNF-alpha antibodies. We observed significant differences when we divided the groups into 4 as well as into 2, as a comparison between patients who were treated with anti-TNF and who were not treated with anti-TNF. Another Japanese study reported that the incidences of spontaneous abortion (OR, 5.3; 95% CI, 1.1-25.0) were significantly higher in CD patients whose conceptions occurred after disease onset than in those who had conceived prior to disease onset. In that report, 3 patients had received anti-TNF-alpha antibody (infliximab).14 In our study, most patients treated with anti-TNF had CD (88%). Because the number of patients with UC who were treated with anti-TNF was small, we cannot conclude whether anti-TNF treatment was a risk factor for spontaneous abortion in the Japanese population. Although statistically nonsignificant, disease activity scores were higher in the anti-TNF- and thiopurine therapy-exposed groups. Whether this association is secondary to the use of anti-TNF or whether use of anti-TNF is only a marker for more severe disease is unclear. Johnson et al. reported outcomes of pregnancies in women with IBD treated with anti-TNF therapy from a Western country and showed that it may increase the risk of spontaneous abortion (exposed 5/34 vs. never exposed 3/55; OR, 2.99).15 In contrast, Schnitzler reported that the abortion rate in a TNF -exposed group vs. a non-exposed group was not significantly different (exposed 9/42 vs. non-exposed 12/78; OR, 1.5 [0.57 to 3.92]).2 In a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects of anti-TNF-alpha antibodies on female patients with IBD, there was no increase in the occurrence of adverse pregnancy outcomes including spontaneous abortion in comparison with that reported in controls, except for the significant decrease in gestational age of newborns of drug-exposed mothers in 1 trial.16 Thus, the use of anti-TNF during pregnancy in IBD patients from Western countries appears to be acceptable. However, the pregnancy outcomes of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (another auto-immune disease treated with anti- TNF therapy) showed that the rate of spontaneous abortion was highest among patients exposed to anti-TNF at the time of conception (with methotrexate/leflunomide 33% and without methotrexate/leflunomide 24%). This compared with 10% spontaneous abortions in the control group. In that report, there was no significant increase in congenital malformations or premature birth.17 There was 1 case report of spontaneous abortion during use of ustekinumab, an anti-TNF agent, in women with psoriatic arthritis.18 Thus, concerning spontaneous abortion rates in IBD patients of Asian descent, no firm conclusions can be drawn about the safety of anti-TNF during pregnancy.\n\nThere are several limitations in our study. The number of patients was limited. Each drug exposure group included a mixture of CD and UC patients, and ratios were different in each group. Disease activity of each group was not matched.\n\nIn conclusion, exposure to anti-TNF treatment or thiopurines during pregnancy in IBD patients of Asian descent was not related to a higher incidence of adverse pregnancy outcomes in IBD patients except for spontaneous abortion. There is a possibility that the increased spontaneous abortion rate was associated with anti-TNF use. However, because the number of patients in our study is limited, a further large-scale study is necessary."
