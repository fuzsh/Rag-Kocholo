Coming To A Cinema Near You

The Lost World Of Mr. Hardy, a documentary first mentioned on Anglers’ Net back in April 2009 (click here), is about to embark on a nationwide cinema tour. Here are a few words from the producers:

Once upon a time people made things with their hands, beautiful, intricate items like cane fishing rods and exotic salmon flies. One company did this best; Hardy’s of Alnwick. They were loved the world over, their fishing tackle adored by royalty, maharajas and film stars alike. Their attention to detail and quality brought a sense of fulfillment and pride to the job. 50 years working at Hardy’s created an incredible sense of community where generations of families worked together. Now this has all but gone and we live in a world of mass production, globalisation and outsourcing. But do we miss those days? Is there something special about the pride and feel of the handmade that suggests a missing need in our everyday life?
