A Lincolnshire farmer who has had hundreds of pounds worth of potatoes stolen says he is "extremely grateful" for the support he has received.

John Hardy, 71, set up an honesty box at his farm near Boston for the public to buy his produce, but 218 bags of the vegetable went unpaid for.

The local community then set up an online funding page to reimburse the money which was lost, raising Â£510.

Mr Hardy said: âThank you to the honest people."
