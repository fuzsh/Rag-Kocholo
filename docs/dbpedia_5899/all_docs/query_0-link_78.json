Take a look at my privacy policy for more information.\n\nFill your reading list with these amazing books set in Dorset…\n\nFrom Thomas Hardy and Enid Blyton to Christopher Priest and Ian McEwan, Dorset has been an inspiration to many British writers. As a result, there’s a vast array of books set in Dorset, offering the chance to “visit” the county through fiction.\n\nBelow, I’ve rounded up 16 books set in Dorset to help you get started. From swashbuckling treasure hunts on the dramatic coastline, to historical romances set in Dorset stately homes, to futuristic science fiction, there’s definitely something for everyone here. And Dorset has a background role in all of them! Enjoy…\n\nFiction Books Set in Dorset\n\nFar From the Madding Crowd, Thomas Hardy\n\nLocations: Puddletown\n\nGenre: Classic Literature\n\nThomas Hardy is perhaps one of the most famous names associated with Dorset. He was born on the outskirts of Dorchester and lived in the town for most of his life. He also set the majority of his books and other works in Dorset. In Hardy’s writings, the rural southwest of England became “Wessex”, a semi-fictional region, based not-so-loosely on real-life counties.\n\nFar from the Madding Crowd was the first of his novels to be mention Wessex, which he described as “partly real, partly dream-country”. It was also Hardy’s first great literary success. Set around Puddletown, called “Weatherbury” in the books, the story describes the life and relationships of Bathsheba Everdene against the backdrop of a farming community in Victorian England. In 2007 it ranked in 10th place on the Guardian’s list of the Greatest Love Stories of all Time.\n\nTess of the D’Ubervilles, Thomas Hardy\n\nLocations: Various\n\nGenre: Classic Literature\n\nIt was a fine September evening, just before sunset, when yellow lights struggle with blue shades in hairlike lines.\n\nTess of the D’Ubervilles is considered a major 19th-century English novel, and quite possibly Hardy’s fictional masterpiece. Like Far From the Madding Crowd, it is also set in rural Dorset.\n\nFrom the cover: It tells of Tess Durbeyfield, the daughter of a poor and dissipated villager, who learns that she may be descended from the ancient family of d’Uberville. In her search for respectability, her fortunes fluctuate wildly, and the story assumes the proportions of a Greek tragedy. It explores Tess’s relationships with two very different men, her struggle against the social mores of the rural Victorian world which she inhabits and the hypocrisy of the age.\n\nFamous Five, Enid Blyton\n\nLocations: Corfe Castle, Brownsea Island\n\nGenre: Children’s Fiction\n\nBroken archways, tumbledown towers, ruined walls – that was all that was left of a once beautiful castle, proud and strong. Now the jackdaws nested in it and the gulls sat on the topmost stones.\n\nEnid Blyton visited Dorset, specifically the Isle of Purbeck, around three times a year for over 20 years. The area influenced many of her books, but especially the various stories of the Famous Five. Five on a Treasure Island was the first book in the series, and it centres around Kirrin Castle. This ruined castle was based on Purbeck’s Corfe Castle, near Swanage – although Blyton placed it on an island of the same name instead of a hill. It has also been suggested that Brownsea Island in Poole Harbour was the inspiration for Kirrin Island. However, others think that Brownsea Island became Whispering Island in Five Have a Mystery to Solve.\n\nPersuasion, Jane Austen\n\nLocations: Lyme Regis\n\nGenre: Classic Literature\n\nA very strange stranger it must be, who does not see charms in the immediate environs of Lyme, to make him wish to know it better.\n\nAlthough not quite as famous as Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen’s last novel, Persuasion, is largely considered her most moving. The majority of the novel takes place in Bath, following the story of Anne Elliot – and what happens when we let ourselves be “persuaded” by others in matters of the heart. Bath may be the main setting, but one of the most pivotal scenes takes place during a trip to Lyme Regis on the Dorset coast. While Austen famously disliked Bath, a city she lived in for some time, her admiration for Lyme shines through in her writing.\n\nThe French Lieutenant’s Woman, John Fowles\n\nLocations: Lyme Regis\n\nGenre: Classic Literature\n\nThe French Lieutenant’s Woman is an epic historical romance set in the seaside town of Lyme Regis. From the cover: Charles Smithson, a respectable engaged man, meets Sarah Woodruff as she stands on the Cobb at Lyme Regis, staring out to sea. Charles falls in love, but Sarah is a disgraced woman, and their romance will defy all the stifling conventions of the Victorian age.\n\nRemarkable Creatures, Tracy Chevalier\n\nLocations: Lyme Regis\n\nGenre: Historical Fiction\n\nFor myself, it took only the early discovery of a golden ammonite, glittering on the beach between Lyme and Charmouth, for me to succumb to the seductive thrill of finding unexpected treasure.\n\nAnother novel set in the seaside town of Lyme Regis, Remarkable Creatures is a fictionalised account of the life of Mary Anning, written by Tracy Chevalier – the author of Girl with a Pearl Earring. Mary Anning was a local fossil collector and palaeontologist who made several remarkable discoveries in the 19th century, at a time when science was a male-dominated arena. Many disapproved of the local lass’ vocation, but she earned fame nonetheless.\n\nOn Chesil Beach, Ian McEwan\n\nLocations: Chesil Beach, near Abbotsbury\n\nGenre: Contemporary Fiction\n\nHe stood in cold and righteous silence in the summer’s dusk, watching her hurry along the shore, the sound of her difficult progress lost to the breaking of small waves, until she was blurred, receding against the immense straight road of shingle gleaming in the pallid light.\n\nOn Chesil Beach is one of the best-known books set in Dorset of recent years. From the cover: It is July 1962. Edward and Florence, young innocents married that morning, arrive at a hotel on the Dorset coast. At dinner in their rooms, they struggle to suppress their private fears of the wedding night to come and, unbeknownst to them both, the events of the evening will haunt them for the rest of their lives.\n\nMoonfleet, J. Meade Falkner\n\nLocations: East Fleet, Fleet Lagoon, and Chesil Beach\n\nGenre: Classic Literature\n\nWhen I was a child I thought that this place was called Moonfleet, because on a still night, whether in summer, or in winter frosts, the moon shone very brightly on the lagoon; but learned afterwards that ’twas but short for ‘Mohune-fleet’, from the Mohunes, a great family who were once lords of all these parts.\n\nMoonfleet is a swashbuckling tale of smugglers, secret codes, a cursed diamond, and an epic adventure, all set around The Fleet, a lagoon lying between Chesil Beach and the mainland. Based partly in truth, the novel highlights the very real 18th-century world of smuggling, which was rife along this treacherous stretch of the Dorset coast.\n\nLove Among the Chickens, PG Wodehouse\n\nLocations: Lyme Regis\n\nGenre: Classic Literature\n\nDo you know Combe Regis, in Dorsetshire?

The author created the fictional of Wessex, based upon the counties of Southwest England including Dorset, Wiltshire, Somerset, Devon, Hampshire, and part of Berkshire and some of Oxfordshire.\n\nIn Hardy’s works, Dorset was renamed South Wessex. Although the places which fill his novels actually exist, they were often given a fictional name. For example, Dorchester became Casterbridge, while Weymouth was renamed Budmouth and Portland became the Isle of Slingers. Below, I’ve listed all the Thomas Hardy novels which take place either entirely or partly in locations within “South Wessex” (Dorset). There are a few other works by the author that don’t appear here, simply because they do not take place in Dorset.\n\nEarly Works\n\nDesperate Remedies (1871) – Hardy’s second novel, but the first to be published, takes place at numerous locations across Dorset, particularly Weymouth (“Budmouth Regis”) and Kingston Maurward House (“Knapwater House”).\n\nUnder the Greenwood Tree (1872) – The majority of the novel is set in the village of “Mellstock”, which Hardy modelled on Stinsford and Higher and Lower Bockhampton.\n\nHardy’s Wessex\n\nFar from the Madding Crowd (1874) – The first of Hardy’s novels set in his Wessex. Bathsheba and Boldwood’s farms are found in “Weatherbury”, based on Puddletown and its surrounds.\n\nThe Hand of Ethelberta (1876) – Bournemouth, known in the novels as Sandbourne, is the principal location of Hardy’s fifth published novel. Lord Mountclere lived in “Knollsea”, which corresponds to real-life Swanage.\n\nReturn of the Native (1878) – This novel takes place almost entirely on “Egdon Heath“, a fictional landscape based upon the scattered areas of moorland around Dorchester and Wareham.\n\nThe Trumpet-Major (1880) – Hardy’s only historical novel is set in Weymouth during the Napoleonic wars. In 1908 it was adapted into a play put on at the Corn Exchange in Dorchester.\n\nThe Mayor of Casterbridge (1886) – Considered to be one of Hardy’s masterpieces, this novel takes place in the author’s hometown of Dorchester – renamed “Casterbridge”.\n\nThe Woodlanders (1887) – The main setting of this novel, Little Hintock, may not correspond to any real-life village. However, it is a small woodland village near the city of Sherborne, called Sherton Abbas in the book.\n\nWessex Tales (1888) – A collection of short stories set within Hardy’s Wessex, including several Dorset locations.\n\nTess of the d’Urbervilles (1891) – One of Hardy’s most famous novels, this tragic story unfolds across a variety of locations in “South Wessex”.\n\nThe Well-Beloved (1897) – One of Hardy’s last novels, The Well-Beloved takes place on the “Isle of Slingers”, the real-life Isle of Portland. One of the thatched cottages which make up what is now Portland Museum was an inspiration for the home of the book’s heroine.\n\nWessex Poems and Other Verses (1898) – a collection of fifty-one poems set within the Dorset landscape.\n\nComment below to share your favourite books set in Dorset!\n\nPin this Post"
