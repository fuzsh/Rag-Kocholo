        "text": "He whooped on Batman in The Dark Knight Rises, made his way down Fury Road, and pulled off the seemingly impossible feat of turning a movie about a guy behind the wheel of a car into the pulse-pounding drama Locke — and that really doesn’t even scratch the surface of all the interesting career choices that have paid off for Tom Hardy. Whether you’re mainly familiar with blockbuster outings like Inception, favor acclaimed fare like Bronson and The Revenant, or are a hardcore fan who’s been with him since Black Hawk Down, there’s a Hardy movie for everyone. Especially superhero fans, since he’s brought Venom to life, and returned for the sequel, Let There Be Carnage.
