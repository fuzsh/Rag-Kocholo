        "text": "A Lincolnshire farmer said he had been left feeling âsickâ after hundreds of pounds worth of potatoes have been stolen from his honesty stall.\n\nJohn Hardy, 71, has a stand at the bottom of his farm at Antonâs Gowt, near Boston, for the public to buy potatoes in exchange for putting Â£2 in a box.\n\nHe said 218 bags of potatoes have been taken with no cash put in the honesty box.\n\nMr Hardy said people need to have âmore of a conscience on themâ and taking them without paying is âdisgustingâ.\n\nHe set up the stall five years ago and said he has always suffered some losses, but not on the scale he has encountered in recent months.\n\nMr Hardy said he may be reluctantly forced to shut the stall for good, if things do not change.\n\nâI just hope people will see sense because I really donât want to pack this job up,â he said.\n\nâIâm afraid in this day and age we get people like this everywhere.\n\nâItâs very frustrating that this is the culture we live in where people arenât as honest and good as they used to be.\n\nâItâs not a nice feeling doing all this work only for people to take them.â"
