ARE WE PREPARED TO MANAGE THE AFTERMATH OF A CYBERATTACK OR OTHER FAILURE OF THE ELECTRICAL GRID? ---------- THURSDAY, APRIL 14, 2016 House of Representatives, Subcommittee on Economic Development, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, Washington, DC. The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:05 a.m. in room 2167, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Lou Barletta (Chairman of the subcommittee) presiding. Mr. Barletta. The committee will come to order. Today we are holding a hearing to explore a critical and timely topic. There have been numerous congressional hearings on cybersecurity and how to stop the bad guys. What has not been discussed in great detail is what the consequence will be from a massive cyberattack that brings down, for example, a large portion of the electrical grid for an extended period of time. The purpose of today's hearing is to answer an important question: With respect to cyberthreats to the electrical power system, what consequences should the Federal Government tell States and local governments to prepare for? In other words, for how many people and for how long should States plan on being without power? The Federal Government does this now for almost every significant hazard that we face. Whether it is a category 5 hurricane hitting Miami or an 8.0 earthquake in Los Angeles, the Federal Government has realistic estimates or scenarios for States and cities to plan. The Federal Government does not have this basic planning scenario for a cyberthreat to the power system, and there is a huge disparity in what different groups think is a potential scenario for which States and local governments should prepare. And the difference would be significant for local governments. If the power is out for a few days, it can be an inconvenience, but if it is out for several weeks, or a month or more, the local government has to potentially plan for increased public safety, water treatment, sheltering, or evacuation, fuel delivery for generators, and many other contingencies. What should we plan for? Ted Koppel, in his book, says that we should plan on 6 to 18 months of uninterrupted blackouts. The industry seems to say a cyberattack could, at most, cause an interruption in terms of days, not weeks. And today we are going to hear testimony from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Department of Energy, the Department of Homeland Security's National Protection and Programs Directorate, the Congressional Research Service, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, and representatives from the electrical industry. I hope to get an answer to this question for State and local governments who are on the ground and will be first charged with protection of people and property. Imagine what we would do without electricity for a day, a week, a month, a year. Virtually all critical infrastructure is dependent on the electrical grid, particularly the lifeline sectors: telecommunications, transportation, water, and financial services. And if the goal of the bad guys is to collapse the United States economic system, they are going to try to cut off the power. There have been reports of hacking attempts on electrical facilities by foreign and domestic parties. Our national security, public safety, economic competitiveness, and personal privacy is at risk. According to the Department of Homeland Security, the energy sector was the target of more than 40 percent of all reported cyberattacks. And even more disconcerting was the December 2015 cyberattack on Ukraine's electric grid, which affected four dozen substations and left one-quarter of a million people without power. At the same time as the attack on the grid itself, call centers were hit with a telephony denial-of- service attack as customers were trying to report the outages. If anyone thought this was a glitch, think again. The electrical grid is not only under attack from cyberspace, the electric power sector is all too familiar with the devastation storms like Hurricane Sandy can leave behind, or physical attacks like the 2013 incident at the Metcalf substation in California. Thankfully, in the cases of storms and physical attacks, the power sector has strong plans in place and redundant systems to restore power quickly and to avoid the loss of life and property. But I am concerned about a cyberattack. Are there similar plans in place for industry and for State and local government? Will those redundancies provide the same types of protections? Most recently, I have been discussing this topic with constituents in my district, asking what they will do in their communities if the power is out for a prolonged period of time. Honestly, most of them don't know because we don't know what to plan for. We have brought together the right people here to tell us today. We are also going to discuss what preparedness looks like, best practices, and how we can achieve a greater level of readiness, all the way down to the local mayors and township supervisors. I am encouraged to hear all the industry talk about an all-hazards approach and focusing on mitigating the greatest risks, but I think there are some unique characteristics of the cyberthreat that require specific planning guidelines. I know we cannot goldplate the system, but given the interdependency of electricity with our daily lives, it is crucial that we understand the risks and be prepared for the likely consequences possible from the failure of that system. I look forward to this conversation today, starting with our witnesses, and I thank you all for being here. I now call on Ranking Member DeFazio for his comments. Mr. DeFazio. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, you certainly laid out well the potential threats of a cyberattack against our critical electrical grid. We know there is constant probing, some of it being done by nation-states, not just terrorist groups, nation-states hostile to the U.S. And we need to be certain that we are as prepared, well prepared, as we can be. The Ukraine attack was perhaps a harbinger of things to come. The--I do believe, though, that the all-hazards approach can also cover the cyberattack area. The issue of probably most immediate concern to those of us who live in the Northwestern United States is the threat of Cascadia subduction zone quake in the magnitude of 9 or 9-plus, which will inevitably knock out our grid. So, you know, there are going to be exercises conducted, two exercises this year, with the cooperation of the Department of Homeland Security and all the local and State authorities in the region to simulate what would be possible in the face of that sort of a disaster. Many of the problems that could occur will be the same. You know, the loss of transformers is particularly of concern, and I am going to be probing that issue with some of the witnesses today. There is a question whether the Federal Government should be perhaps stockpiling these transformers, since now they are basically custom orders. They take 6 to 18 months. What if we lose a dozen large critical transformers because of an earthquake, tsunami, or a cyberattack? You know, it seems to me kind of a no-brainer that we should, either through Government sources or through cooperation with the industry, be creating a critical infrastructure component stockpile here in the United States to deal with any and all of these sorts of potential attacks. And a coordinated, physical attack and cyberattack could, of course, be the most devastating, outside of a massive earthquake/tsunami. And again, many of the same issues arise. And then one that doesn't get talked about very much any more but we held a series of hearings on it years ago in the Committee on Natural Resources--then called the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs--when we had jurisdiction over nuclear power is the potential for a bomb in place. That is, a nuclear plant. If you destroy the backup system--take over the plant, destroy the backup system and the incoming power, you can create a meltdown. And how good is the security at our nuclear plants these days? I know this hearing isn't going to get to that topic, I am not certain it is even within our jurisdiction, but it is of concern to me, and I just wanted to raise that issue, too. So, like aviation, you know, electricity, the grid, the-- and nuclear plants are of interest to terrorist groups and hostile nation-states, so we have got to be prepared. So I am pleased you are holding this hearing today. Mr. Barletta. Thank you. We will have two panels of witnesses today. And on our first panel we will have Administrator Fugate, the current Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Federal coordinator for consequence management; Assistant Secretary Hoffman from the Department of Energy's Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability--this is the office charged with coordinating the Federal efforts to facilitate the recovery from disruptions in the emergency and the energy supply; Assistant Secretary Durkovich, the Assistant Secretary for Infrastructure Protection from the Department of Homeland Security; and Mr. Richard Campbell, an expert at the Congressional Research Service in the electric power sector. On our second panel we will be joined by Mr. Gerry Cauley, the president and CEO of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, the international regulatory authority whose mission is to assure the reliability of the bulk power system in North America; Mr. William Spence, CEO of the PPL Corporation, one of the largest investor-owned utility companies in the United States; and Ms. Bobbi Kilmer, president and CEO of the Claverack Rural Electric Cooperative, a nonprofit electric utility serving 2,250 square miles in northeastern Pennsylvania. I ask unanimous consent that the witnesses' full statement be included in the record. [No response.] Mr. Barletta. Without objection, so ordered. Since your written testimony has been made a part of the record, the subcommittee would request that you limit your oral testimony to 5 minutes. Let's start with our first panel. Administrator Fugate, you may proceed. TESTIMONY OF HON. W. CRAIG FUGATE, ADMINISTRATOR, FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY; PATRICIA A. HOFFMAN, ASSISTANT SECRETARY, OFFICE OF ELECTRICITY DELIVERY AND ENERGY RELIABILITY, DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY; CAITLIN A. DURKOVICH, ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION, NATIONAL PROTECTION AND PROGRAMS DIRECTORATE, DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY; AND RICHARD CAMPBELL, SPECIALIST IN ENERGY POLICY, CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE Mr. Fugate. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Members, Members. I want to address your questions. What does a local official need? What do they need to plan for? And I think, based upon our experiences dealing with other hazards that have caused disruptions, planning needs to be measured in weeks, particularly if there is damage to infrastructure. And again, with cyber, we have seen restoration potentially very quickly if there is not physical damage. But if you do have damage to things like very large transformers or generator capacity, that will extend it. We do know that it is important that in an initial response, that you provide for safety and security. When lights are out, power is out--we have had major metropolitan areas go through this--you have a flurry of activity with people trapped in elevators, traffic control, and the fact that initial response may mean going out on patrol and looking for problems, rather than waiting for the traditional call to 911, which may or may not be impacted, as you have pointed out before, with denial-of-service attacks. Your next steps are pretty much, again, as the ranking member points out, all hazards. You have to then provide for the most immediate needs. Hopefully, your critical infrastructure has power and emergency power, you have the fuel supply you need. We have found in many cases communities haven't planned for that. Either they don't have critical equipment on backup power or they don't have adequate fuel supplies--usually only enough fuel to run their weekly or monthly test, but not to operate in a crisis. Generators are very expensive. And so, in many cases, there are other options, such as putting in transfer switches. The idea is what are the things that are required to keep the community up and running until power can be restored that are lifelines? Water systems, wastewater treatment, communications, your hospitals, and your 911 and other dispatch facilities. Generally, these have emergency power, but it has to be planned for real, not that it just works during the monthly test. And then, as you have pointed out, Mr. Chairman, the duration now starts driving additional issues. As we saw in New Jersey and New York, the longer you have power disruptions, the more you have cascading effects, from everything to not being able to get to retail stores, grocery stores, others, gasoline distribution. And again, as a community starts to try to recover and get back to normal, these all become challenges. So, the planning really is based upon safety, keeping your primary life support systems up, focusing on the restoration of the grid, and the reality that your residential areas will probably be last to get power because you are going to try to get your retail sectors and major core centers up first. The industry has shown a lot of resiliency capabilities of doing those things in physical destructions. And we think that the lessons we have learned there would apply, again, to cyber. But cyber has a lot of unknowns. And I will defer to my experts to my left on what those impacts are, the potential threats, and how likely these are. But you said how big is big. We actually looked at a natural phenomenon that is actually big, and that would be geomagnetic storms. Because of the way our grid is built, and the vulnerabilities to very large transformers, this administration has already developed a working plan of what we would do in the event of major geomagnetic storms, its impacts on satellites and terrestrial systems. We are working currently now on the lessons from the previous power outages on the annex to add to the National Response Framework to look at the power outages because of a lot of the unique capabilities the Federal Government brings, but also this has got to be a true working relationship with the utilities. We cannot do this separate. It is a partnership. It has got to involve all levels, because the primary place we regulate power is at the States, through the, you know, utility regulatory operations the--State managed. That framework this summer will be going to our senior leadership in the agencies to begin that process of concurrence and updating it, but it serves as a framework if something was to happen now, based upon our lessons from Sandy, and going all the way back to previous hurricanes and other disruptions. But the challenge is, I think, for people to look at planning not for what they do every day, but what would happen if power was out for not just hours but days or weeks. Do they really understand what their capabilities are, and the things they need to do to ensure that their critical lifelines have enough power? And trust me, sir, I have been through enough hurricanes to find out too many facilities only had enough emergency power to pass whatever requirements were there, but under full load in a crisis they failed. They didn't operate them under loads, they didn't maintain enough fuel in the systems for that. They did not have contracts for firm deliveries when the crisis occurred. So you really need to get people to focus on this, that if you are going to provide emergency power it has got to be for real, and it has got to be able to operate for long periods of time. And you need to really plan for this from the standpoint of a phased approach, because oftentimes when this starts we don't know how long it is going to be out. So we have immediate response steps, but you also need to start asking the question if power isn't on in 72 hours, what are the next things we have to focus on? If we are out for a week, what are the next things we have to focus on? But I think the story from industry is also good. We have learned a lot about how to get systems back up. We have learned how to bypass fail systems. And, in many cases, the automation has replaced the man in the middle. And sometimes we have to put people back in and run less efficient systems, but we can get power back. So I think there is both a good news story, but there is still a lot that we don't know. So against that we are not going to be able to write a plan for everything that can happen. We need to write plans based upon consequences. And again, as we have a better understanding of the duration of impacts, that will help us shape that guidance to State and local officials for dealing with extensive power outages, pretty much irregardless of the cause of it, but really looking at it over the time phase of what would be happening and what the next steps are. But again, a lot of the lessons have been learned from natural hazards. The question in cyber is how widespread and how many jurisdictions simultaneously will be impacted. That is probably the one difference that a physical specific such as a hurricane or earthquake--we know the geographical area, which cyber--it won't be defined by political or physical boundaries, it would be systemwide. And that is another area that we ask questions about. But not much dissimilar to the threat from geomagnetic storms. That is a hemispheric risk, and that is probably--when you--outside of a A&P detonation in space, it is probably the largest potential impact to the utilities, and again, a lot of work has been done to minimize those impacts. So, Mr. Chairman, I stand ready for questions, but I wanted to try to answer your questions in my opening statements. Mr. Barletta. Thank you for your testimony. Before we move on I want to recognize the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. Carson, for his opening statement. Mr. Carson. Well, Chairman Barletta, thank--we had a hearing with the CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] Director and I didn't have access to my phone. And then, when I finally escaped I saw the messages. But my apologies. But I want to thank you guys. Chairman, I think--for the sake of time, I think we should still continue, because I was the one who was late, so thank you. Mr. Barletta. Thank you. We will now move on to Assistant Secretary Hoffman. You may proceed. Ms. Hoffman. Chairman Barletta, Ranking Member Carson, members of the subcommittee, thank you very much for focusing attention on the importance of being prepared for an outage, and for the opportunity to discuss the Department of Energy's role in helping ensure resilient, reliable, and flexible electricity systems in an increasingly challenging environment. Our economy, national security, even the health and safety of citizens depend on reliable delivery of electricity. The mission of the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability is to strengthen, transform, and improve our energy infrastructure to ensure access to reliable, secure, and clean sources of energy. We are committed to working with our public and private sector partners to protect the Nation's critical energy infrastructure, including the electric power grid, from disruptions, whether it be caused by natural or manmade events, including severe weather, physical attacks, and cyberattacks. A crucial factor in meeting these challenges is to be proactive, and cultivate what I call an ecosystem of resilience, a network of owners and operators, regulators, vendors, Federal partners, and consumers acting together to strengthen our ability to prepare, respond, and recover. Our organization works on indepth strategies, products, and tools to inform and educate State and local officials in their energy emergency preparedness activity. This is done through forums, trainings, and tabletop exercises that include Federal, State, and local energy officials. In the area of cybersecurity, as part of the administration's effort to improve electricity subsector cybersecurity capabilities, the Department of Energy and industry partners have developed the Electricity Subsector Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model. This is an evaluation tool that helps organizations prioritize and develop cybersecurity capabilities. In April, DOE [Department of Energy] will lead Clear Path IV in Portland, Oregon, and Washington, DC. Clear Path is an interagency exercise focused on testing and evaluating the energy sector roles and responsibilities and response plans utilized for a Cascadia subduction zone 9.0 earthquake and tsunami. When a response is required and needed, the Department of Energy serves as lead agency for this response under the National Response Framework and under FEMA's [Federal Emergency Management Agency's] leadership. The Department of Energy works with industry and Federal partners to assess the impacts of disaster on local and regional energy infrastructure, coordinate delivery of assets, monitor and report on restoration efforts, and provide regular situational awareness to key decisionmakers in the States, the White House, and our interagency partners. DOE also provides strategic leadership by requesting and facilitating the development of an energy Information Sharing and Analysis Center, as well as the development of an Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council. This council is a group of leaders from across the electric sector that meet regularly with Government to coordinate and share information. When power goes out, the local utility is the first responder. Should any threat or emergency exceed the capability of any local or private-sector resources, the Federal Government and the electric sector, through the council, will engage in coordinating a response to this type of a crisis. Congress enacted several important new security measures in the FAST Act [Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act]. This act affirms DOE's responsibility in cybersecurity coordination, oil and gas information sharing, and the development of a transformer reserve plan. In addition, the FAST Act provides the Secretary of Energy with a new authority: Upon declaration of a grid security emergency by the President, the Secretary can issue orders to protect and restore critical electric infrastructure, or defense critical electric infrastructure. This authority allows DOE to respond as needed to cyberthreats or physical threats to the grid. The Department is actively engaging in the process and procedure for implementing this new authority. The keys to strengthening resilience are not only understanding threat insight and response, but it is also through innovation. Advanced technology and innovation in cybersecurity storage microgrids will also help the industry get ahead of these risks. In conclusion, the threats will continue to evolve. DOE is working diligently to stay ahead of the curve. To accomplish this we must invest in resilience, encourage innovation, and use the best practices to help raise the sector's cyber and physical security maturity, as well as strengthen local incident response and recovery capabilities. Thank you for your time. And this concludes my remarks. I look forward to any questions you have. Mr. Barletta. Thank you for your testimony, Assistant Secretary Hoffman. Assistant Secretary Durkovich, you may proceed. Ms. Durkovich. Good morning, Chairman Barletta, Ranking Member Carson, and members of the subcommittee. My name is Caitlin Durkovich, and I am the Assistant Secretary for Infrastructure Protection within the National Protection and Programs Directorate at the Department of Homeland Security. Thank you for the opportunity to discuss how NPPD, which leads the national effort to secure and enhance the resilience of our Nation's infrastructure, fulfils its responsibility to support the Federal Government's preparedness for, response to, and recovery from all-hazard events, including the physical impacts of cyber incidents. I want to begin by acknowledging that protecting the electric grid is a top priority of this administration and of the Department of Homeland Security. It is also worth underscoring, as you will hear from our industry partners later, that the grid, by its very design, is resilient. It is a complex network of electric infrastructure assets that has built-in redundancies and can adapt to rapidly changing demand, load, climate, and a host of other factors. In short, the electric grid has been engineered with one principle in mind: reliability. Thousands of companies work together with the Government to run the most reliable grid in the world. And while over 85 percent of the Nation's electricity infrastructure is in private hands, the Federal Government recognizes we must work in partnership with industry to protect our grid because of its importance to national security, economic prosperity, and community resilience. I have the privilege of working with industries that span the 16 critical infrastructure sectors, and can say with confidence that the electric industry takes a multilayered approach to risk management, and is committed to continuous adaptation, based on lessons learned from real-world events and exercises, and an understanding of the dynamic risk environment. Industry and Government acknowledge, however, we cannot stop every threat and natural hazard, and that we must be prepared to respond to a range of events and their consequences. The Federal Government's voluntary partnership with the electric sector, which is defined under the National Infrastructure Protection Plan, reached new levels in 2012 following two important events. The first was a report published by the Presidential advisory committee, the National Infrastructure Advisory Council, in 2011 on the resilience of the electric and nuclear sectors, and called for the most senior executives from industry and Government to convene on a regular basis to craft a risk management agenda that was reflective of the increasingly chaotic threat environment. Nearly a year later our country awoke to the scenes of an earthquake, tsunami, and subsequent failure at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant in Japan that put new emphasis on the need for the public and private sector and the United States to come together to plan for a catastrophic national incident. For nearly 4 years now, 30 CEOs representing the breadth of the electric power industry have comprised the Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council, and meet regularly with their counterparts at DHS [Department of Homeland Security], DOE, and other members of the interagency to address the growing number of sophisticated factors that put our grid at risk. This risk management approach is focused on ensuring that the consequences of the most catastrophic events are minimized, and that the value of our relationship is strengthened by identifying joint priorities enabled by robust information sharing, continuous planning, and regular testing and exercise of these plans. Projects conducted through this partnership include action- oriented information sharing around physical and cyber events, including black energy: a 2013-2014 security outreach campaign around threats to substations recommended security best practices and the importance of reporting suspicious activity; an Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council playbook, which is a crisis management framework to enable senior executives from industry and Government to coordinate effectively on response and recovery issues; as well as work by DHS and DOE with the Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council on efforts to institutionalize coordination with other lifeline functions. In addition to our ESCC [Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council] work, DHS works directly with owners and operators to help enhance their security and resilience posture, understand dependencies and interdependencies, and exercise with their State, local, tribal, and territorial partners for a range of possible scenarios. This engagement would not be possible without a cadre of security specialists around the country who engage with asset owners on a regular basis to help them understand the risk posed by cyber and physical threats, perform assessments, share information, and ensure they are connected to the broader homeland security community to include State and local officials. NPPD also works with partners across the Government in the event of a needed response to a major disaster or attack resulting in a failure of the electric grid. NPPD supports FEMA during response operation, and helps provide an understanding of the infrastructure of concern in an impacted area, and decision support in prioritizing restoration and recovery, as well as ensuring the resilience of our communications infrastructure. During a cyber or communication incident, NPPD's National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center is able to coordinate with State, local, and private-sector partners, including law enforcement and intelligence communities, so that the full capabilities of the Federal Government can be brought to bear in a coordinated manner. The Industrial Control Systems Cyber Emergency Response Team is the response component of the NCCIC [National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center] and provides on-site support to private-sector industrial control system owners and operators. In conclusion, Government and industry have engaged in an unprecedented effort to assess and mitigate the risks from cyberattacks, physical sabotage, and natural disasters, all of which can result in disruptions to the electric grid. In a major step toward this unified approach, the Department proposed to transition NPPD to an operational component, the Cyber and Infrastructure Protection Agency. This transition would elevate cyber operations and provide more comprehensive, coordinated risk management support to our stakeholders that reflect the growing convergence of cyber and physical threats. Chairman Barletta, Ranking Member Carson, and members of the subcommittee, thank you again for the opportunity to appear before you today and to discuss NPPD's efforts in managing the physical consequences of cyberthreats. I look forward to your questions. Mr. Barletta. Thank you for your testimony, Ms. Durkovich. Mr. Campbell, you may proceed. Mr. Campbell. Good morning, Chairman, Ranking Member, and members of the subcommittee. My name is Richard Campbell. I am a specialist in energy policy for the Congressional Research Service, CRS. On behalf of CRS I would like to thank the committee for inviting me here to testify today. My testimony will provide background on the possible consequences of a failure of the electric grid, the roles with respect to parties, and some of the objective challenges in the recovery efforts. I should note that CRS does not advocate policy or take a position on specific legislation. Electric power generation is vital to the commerce and daily functioning of the United States. While the electric grid has operated historically with a high level of reliability, various parts of the electric power system are vulnerable to failure due to natural, operational, or manmade events. Natural events include severe weather and even solar storms. Operational events can result from failures of grid components or systems. And manmade events would include actual attacks on the grid. The extent to which these events could damage the grid would depend upon the severity of the incident. Much of the infrastructure which serves the U.S. power grid is aging. As the grid is modernized, new technologies utilizing two-way communications and other digital capabilities are being incorporated with Internet connectivity. While these advances can improve the efficiency and performance of the grid---- Mr. Barletta. Mr. Campbell, excuse me. Can you pull the microphone just a little closer? Thank you. Mr. Campbell. While these advances can improve the efficiency and performance of the grid, they may also increase its vulnerability to cyberattacks launched from the Internet. In 2014 the National Security Agency reported that it had seen intrusions into industrial control systems with the apparent technical capability to take down the controls to operate U.S. power grids, water systems, and other critical infrastructure. Although there has not been a cybersecurity event resulting in a power outage in the United States, the potential still exists for such attacks to cause a wide-scale, long-lasting outage. The first blackouts attributed to a cyberattack happened in Ukraine in December 2015. The attack targeted industrial control and operating systems in multiple regional utilities. Other critical infrastructure was also targeted, apparently in an attempt to impair recovery efforts. A report released by the National Research Council in 2012 concluded that well-informed terrorists could black out a large region of the country for weeks or even months. It said that if such an attack occurred during times of extreme weather, hundreds or thousands of deaths could occur from heat stress or extended exposure to the cold. A systematic attack of this sort could cost the U.S. economy hundreds of billions of dollars. Recovery from a well-planned cyber and physical attack on the grid could be complicated by the cost and vulnerability of critical components. For example, the strategic destruction of a number of critical, high-voltage transformers could use up the limited inventory of spare units, and it may take months or even years to build new units. The electric utility industry generally prepares for outages from weather-related events, and views the potential for a major cybersecurity attack or similar event as a low- probability risk. If an event is severe enough to be a federally declared disaster, then FEMA, the Federal Energy Management Agency, can provide financial assistance to eligible utilities for the recovery effort. And in 2015 Congress gave the Department of Energy new authority to order electric utilities and the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, NERC, to implement emergency security measures in the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act. However, given the potential for damage to the Nation's economy from a major attack on the grid, some might suggest that the greater focus on recovery is needed, and should become as much a part of the grid security strategy as the efforts to secure the grid. A focus on recovery should consider the mutual dependence and implications to other critical infrastructure of an electric grid failure, and how quickly such impacts could proliferate, if not planned for in advance. Congress may also want to consider how the grid of the future will address cyber and physical security concerns. Incorporating elements to increase system resiliency as it develops will aid in reducing the vulnerability of the system. Finally, NERC has stated that after a major grid disruption, restarting generation and energizing transmission and distribution systems will be a first priority. Restoring service to communications systems, fuel, water supply and treatment and hospital customers will be a secondary priority. Congress may want to consider how planning for the subsequent restoration of services would proceed to ensure that all civilian communities are kept informed, and they are treated as equitably as possible in disaster recovery efforts. This concludes my brief remarks. I look forward to your questions. Mr. Barletta. Thank you for your testimony, Mr. Campbell. I will now begin the first round of questions, limited to 5 minutes for each Member. If there are additional questions following the first round, we will have additional rounds of questions as needed. And I will start with Administrator Fugate. Could you please walk the committee through a timeline of consequences that we could expect to experience in the event of a large-scale and a prolonged power outage which is the result of a combined cyber and physical attack? Let's assume over 10 million people are out of power in the Northeast and it lasts for over a month. Mr. Fugate. The first thing---- Mr. Barletta. I am not talking about how to turn the power back on. But what consequences will State and local governments and residents have to deal with because the power is out? And this is my concern. I am going to put my mayor's hat back on. And, you know, I have been listening to a lot of how prepared we are, what we can--what is typical, what is unlikely, and what we are going to do. But I am not convinced that we have connected the dots all the way down to the local government. I haven't talked to a mayor or a township supervisor yet. When I ask them the question, ``In the event of an unusual and an unlikely event that power is out in a cyberattack, how long are you prepared to provide services?'' nobody can give me that answer. You know, I know it is an unlikely event. So was the chance of two planes running into the twin towers in New York, very unlikely. So, that is what I am hoping to get at today is, for example, in the first few days--because these are the people--I was a mayor. When something like this happens there is going to be panic, and people are going to want to know how long can we expect--and I don't know if anybody has yet given me a clear answer. In the event of both a physical attack and cyberattack, the worst-case scenario--very unlikely, very unusual, but still, as a mayor and a supervisor, I want to be prepared for that worst- case circumstance. So, for example, in the first few days there will be thousands of people stuck in elevators. After 3 or 4 days, hospitals and other critical infrastructure will need fuel for generators. After a week, clean water and waste disposal may be--may have serious problems. And at some point people may start to self-evacuate in large numbers. Please walk us through that timeline of increasing consequences, as the duration of this scenario increases. Mr. Fugate. Mr. Chairman, first challenge, having actually had this happen during accidents where human error causes power outages, we don't know at first how long it is going to be out. And oftentimes you only know that you are having power outages; you are not aware of what is happening outside. Situation awareness will be key, because your initial response will not be any different. We have had numerous communities go through power outages very substantial that resulted in having to do mass rescues and elevator operations, deal with the traffic control issues, hitting at commuter times with commuter rail being knocked off with electricity. We have seen those. I think most communities that are doing effective planning, those are things that they will be doing almost from the beginning. What is critical--and this goes back to what my partners to the left will be focused on--is this a short-term duration or is it longer. We faced this in Florida, actually, when I was still in the State. We had power knocked out that was not occurring in any set pattern. It was occurring all over the State simultaneously. We didn't know what was going on. By the time we had situational awareness, the next question was, ``Will this go into the night hours?'' Because if so, the Governor will call out the National Guard to provide additional law enforcement support. And so, again, you start focusing on those immediate things of life safety. Also safety in your communities, because when you lose power and you start seeing those disruptions, you have to provide a much more visible form of policing and give people a sense of safety in their communities. That is going to require more manpower, more people on the streets. You start looking at my generators are now running, what systems will need refueling next? Is it going to be the next 72 hours? And this is something I think is important. I learned this the hard way. A lot of communities do not plan for refueling in a crisis. And there are certain contractual things you have to have to make sure you get deliveries, and those deliveries to suppliers may not be local. Again, if you are talking 10 million people, we were shipping fuel as far away as Philadelphia back into New Jersey and New York to provide gas. We found all kinds of regulatory challenges. But again, you start going, ``OK, my first step is pretty much my emergency response. My next step is the next 72 hours. Which of my critical facilities will start running out of fuel or are having generator problems?'' This is--by this time we would hopefully have assessed this is a much larger event than local. We start looking at mobilizing resources from the outside, generators, fuel, other things to keep those on. It is key to keep the water systems and wastewater running. Electricity has got a lot of problems, but water and wastewater are almost impossible to make up the differences in dense populations. There is not really a good way to manage that if those systems go offline for extensive periods of time. And so you continue to escalate. Once you get to past my 72 hours--and I am starting to talk my first week--now you start really looking at what does the retail sector supply chain look like. Florida learned this hard lesson, that many of our gas stations, grocery stores, and even pharmacies now have emergency power, they have transfer switches because, as we were dealing with power outages measured in weeks, literally, from hurricanes--and some of our duration of outages actually went to almost a month--we found that retail was doing a lot of things that we had to start supporting because they were bringing in generators, they were getting themselves back open. But we weren't doing it as a partnership, we actually found ourselves competing with them. So you really want to plan this. And I think most communities, that initial response, if they have got good plans, they have done this, or they are prepared to do it. It is once you get past 72 hours that I think that they really need to start thinking through their plans. Where are they going to get fuel? What kind of things do they have to keep up? And then where will be the next points? As we saw with New Jersey and New York, initially it was the rescues and the trapped people and stuff like that. A lot of people evacuated. But then it became the fuel, it became pharmacies, grocery stores. And so you started seeing cascading effects. And again, those are the things I think that, once you are past 72 hours, you need to start planning out, OK, I am out for 1 week, I am out for 2 weeks, I am out for 3 weeks. How much of my core am I bringing up? Again, the utilities aren't waiting. They are not going to be nothing happening for a month. But you are not going to get power back to everybody, and you are not going to get power back particularly to a lot of your residential areas. So can you get enough life support back up and running where people that still don't have power can get the essentials? It won't be easy, it will be difficult. But the thing here now is to continue to trade off. Where can I make activities to buy more time to keep my population stable? Evacuations, maybe self-evacuating. Where people have that option, they will. But you won't see large numbers, because it is unlikely in widespread outages there is going to be places to go to. So again, it becomes this time of stabilization, continue to look at the down-range impacts, what we are able to bring up, where we prioritize that. But the reality is that almost all these scenarios, including the cyber as well as the physical, residential areas are probably going to be the last ones to get that power. So can you get enough life support and infrastructure going to keep the major supply lines up? And you are not going to have everything. You are not going to have what the normal consumption rates are. You may have to do what Governor Christie did and go with rationing of gasoline to start normalizing what is available versus demand signals. But this means you have to plan out not just the power went out, but now what are the impacts of that as you go through-- and then, hopefully, this is what our partners are working on, is to give you better information about how much time are we talking about before key systems come up. When will we get the final power turned back on? Because in the absence of information, I think that generates its own problems. If we know that it is going to be out for 3 weeks, we can plan. People are more resilient than we give them credit for. But the lack of information, that in itself becomes a challenge. So I ran over my time, Mr. Chairman, but I was trying to-- -- Mr. Barletta. That is OK, because it is important, because that is what I am trying to get at, is are these conversations--and who is responsible for these conversations with people at the local level, because this is an unknown. If there is a storm coming, a hurricane, an ice storm, a--we are prepared for that. We can expect--we know what is coming. An earthquake, not so. You don't know it is coming, but still we have experience with that. But a widespread cyberattack with a physical attack attached to it is unknown. And who is having that conversation with people at the local level that--we don't know. It could be out a week, it could be out longer than a week. You need to be prepared. And are those conversations actually happening? I don't--I am not convinced that they are. And that is where the life will be lost. And I think we need to begin to find out how do we connect the dots. Who is responsible for having those conversations down at the lowest level of the people who will be first charged with trying to protect lives. I am going to turn to Ranking Member Carson for his questions. Mr. Carson. Thank you very much, Chairman Barletta. Madam Hoffman, your testimony notes that the Department's research and development activities with respect to developing spare transformer components, what is the cost to manufacturers when we are making these alternative components? And has a domestic manufacturer been identified so that we can ensure that there is no disruption to its prior usage? Ms. Hoffman. So thank you very much for the question. Transformers are a very critical component to the electric sector as was stated in the testimonies and some of the conversations earlier. With respect to transformers, the price of a transformer ranges anywhere between $5 million and $10 million. And so these are significant components. So what is our research program, or what are the activities looking for, dealing with the transformer issues? It is, first of all, looking at the spare components that--and the spare transformers that industry has, and then industry is looking at having spare capacity on their system. We are also looking at how do we develop the next generation transformer, which might be a transformer that you have the ability to produce more quickly, and also have more standardization and flexibility. So that includes, in our research component, the development of power electronics and hybrid transformers. Our 2017 budget request has a very strong program looking at transformers, which is about $10 million, in which we are going to look at developing the next generation transformers, as well as doing testing of transformers to make sure we understand any vulnerabilities that may exist. Mr. Carson. Thank you. Administrator Fugate, in the event of a widespread outage, what are FEMA's plans for communicating with citizens on response and recovery efforts when there is essentially zero electricity? Mr. Fugate. Not much different than what we have faced in other significant outages. We have a variety of tools. First of all, within the emergency alert system, the radio stations, TV stations, many of the--that have emergency power, TV stations partner with radio stations. We can get signals. And in addition, if we lose a--and this will be something that we will be looking at in Oregon during the Cascadia--it is not uncommon that you are going to lose radio and TV stations in the area of impact. But we work with the FCC [Federal Communications Commission] for the nonimpacted stations to increase power to get signal back in. That is why we continue to encourage people, have that battery-operated radio. That is why we encourage the idea of FM chips in cell phones, because we can get signals in from the outside, but people need to receive it to get the information. But part of this is going to be where the information is coming from. We are going to be working through the Governor's office because Governors and their teams are going to be the best information at the local level. Our job, really, on the Federal side is to provide the backup and tools required. And we are prepared to work with the FCC and broadcasters to get signal from the outside. In addition, we have gone as far--and we did this in the Sandy response--bring in satellite communications and set up WiFi in some of the areas that have lost some of the cellular communications. But we have another backup, and, self-disclosure, I am an amateur radio operator. But I think sometimes the more we look at the complexity of our risk, we forget that we have some very resilient systems that aren't part of Government, but they oftentimes are the last thing running when everything else has failed. So we look from everything from our systems and satellite technology, working with nonimpacted stations how to broadcast in, amateur radios are all part of that. But it is important that people take the steps to be able to get the information when we can get the signal in, and that is why it may seem very passe in an area of streaming everything that a battery-powered radio may be that lifeline of communication link to get information, because we have seen, even in large-scale--like Katrina--stations outside the area get broadcast in, but you had to have a way to receive the information. Mr. Carson. And lastly, Madam Durkovich, have our most critical transformers and substations within the bulk power system been identified so that we have a clear comprehension of system dependencies? And even cascading impacts from a widespread power outage, regardless of the cost? Ms. Durkovich. Thank you very much for that question, Ranking Member Carson. We work very closely with the utility owners, with our partners at DOE, as well as NERC and FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission], to understand the most critical aspects of the electric grid. We have a number of programs that we leverage to help assess the vulnerabilities of these particular assets, and to work with owners and operators to help enhance the security and resilience to provide recommendations. But equally important, as you will hear later from Gerry Cauley, who is the president and CEO of NERC, we have a series of standards that are intended to guide the security of some of these most critical assets. Increasingly within my office we are working to better understand the dependencies and interdependencies on some of these critical energy assets to be able to visualize what an outage is--the impacts it is going to have to other key lifeline sectors, and to be able to provide that information as leaders to include Administrator Fugate and those of the utilities working to get power restored. Thank you. Mr. Carson. Thank you, ma'am. Chairman, I yield back. Mr. Barletta. Thank you. The Chair recognizes Mr. Meadows for 5 minutes. Mr. Meadows. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for this important topic. I think this is one of the interesting aspects that I get asked about more than anything else. Let me tell you why I am a little bit troubled here today is that I hear a lot of rhetoric that acts like we have our act together from a Federal standpoint, when really the vast majority of the job that gets done is really with the stakeholders, with those public utilities that, for years, have been prepared for mass outages, but perhaps the scope of the threat, the cyberthreat--and when we are talking about mass outages, you know, we can talk about Hurricane Sandy, we can talk about, you know, other storms. They are used to that. I am just telling you, they have got--I used to work for an electric utility many years ago. I was around--I have got enough gray hair, I was around when the DOE was actually formed. And so when we look at this, to suggest that the Federal Government is here to help, I want to make sure that you are helping. And the chairman talked about the real communication that is being done. The real communication that is being done is really being done by the public utilities at the local level. If any is getting done. You know, it is crickets when it comes to the other Federal agencies as it relates to this. Now, I say that as a criticism, only because we have to figure out that we are sick before we start to figure out the diagnosis and how to fix it. So let me ask Assistant Secretary Hoffman for your help on one particular area. In your testimony you were talking about national security and how you can reprioritize and make sure that those national security interests are supplied by public utilities or governmental agencies. Here is my concern. Many of our national security interests actually have their own generating and own distribution capacity. And yet I find them woefully underprepared for cyberattacks. You know, some of them are primary metered at the point of entrance, so you may have a public utility providing the generating capacity. They do the distribution. So as we look at this, what kind of turf war do we get in between DOD [Department of Defense] and DOE with regards to being ready for a cyberattack that would have national security implications? Ms. Hoffman. Thank you, Congressman, for that question. When we deal with any sort of event, we are going to act as a whole of Government. So, whether it is a cyber event---- Mr. Meadows. But who is in charge? Here is the problem, is--and I have dealt with a number of agencies. So we get FEMA that comes in, and we get local emergency management responses. And what you have is you have different people saying different things. So with regards to national security, who is in charge of the power grid? Is it DOE or is it DOD? Ms. Hoffman. The owners and operators are ultimately in charge of the power grid. The support to the power grid is going to come both from DOE with respect to working with the owners and operators to restore power and DOD has a responsibility with respect to national security and protection. So, from a physical security perspective, we may look at law enforcement to help the utilities protect substations. It depends on the event, but the response will be coordinated. Mr. Meadows. All right. So you have a plan, a coordinated plan that I could look at today on how that would happen. Ms. Hoffman. So for---- Mr. Meadows. That you can give to this committee in terms of the--because here is what happens, is most of the time an event happens and then you go out and you figure out the problems. You know, Mr. Fugate was talking about the fact that we learn lessons from each event that we have. But the problem is, with a cyber event as we are looking at in the Ukraine, you know, here we have an outage to over 200,000 people, where it was cut off. But the real problem was--is they were in the system for almost 6 months and we didn't know about it. So I guess the question is how many times are we getting attacked? And are they in our systems without our knowledge? Ms. Hoffman. Well, you bring up a good point, Congressman, thank you. But the issue is every event and every incident, as Administrator Fugate brought up, is going to be different, and we are going to have to think about the capabilities. When somebody can take someone's access credentials, we have to think about that and look at that as an industry. So we are taking the lessons learned---- Mr. Meadows. But that is more of a physical threat. I want to go back to the cyber aspect, because what we are doing is-- and I heard Ms. Durkovich talk about this--is that we are looking at risk management. And really, what we need to start to focus on is a real comprehensive plan on how we are going to partner with the private sector or public utilities on doing this, because what happens is we get a little check box and we say, ``well, we have gone and we have talked to XYZ and we have asked them to make sure that they are vigilant about cybersecurity,'' which most of them are. But yet, what happens is we don't have a comprehensive plan at a Federal level to look at how we can support them in the event of a national attack that would come in the way of cyber. So I am not talking about storms, and I am not talking about stealing a credential. I am talking about the real attacks that we get hit with every single day. Do we know--have we done a risk assessment where we have intelligence? And have we shared that with the public utilities? Because a lot of times we have this national security concern that we don't want to share that with an outside, you know, group because of national security concerns. Ms. Hoffman. So thank you. You bring up very good points in your discussion. First of all, we follow the National Response Framework. As Administrator Fugate talked about, regardless of whether it is a physical or cyber or weather-related event, we are going to act as a whole of Government in responding to that. With respect to your question on intelligence, we are sharing information with the private sector. DHS and DOE regularly host classified briefings with the private sector to share actionable information. And that is the information that the utilities are able to take back and really do response force. With respect to specific events such as the Ukraine incident, ICS [industrial control system] alert has provided very specific actionable information. DOE, working with the Electricity Information Sharing and Analysis Center, has provided actionable information to the industry to learn from these events and prepare. And that is what is important. Each event is going to be different. We have to take those events and learn from them. Mr. Meadows. I have run out of time. I will yield back, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for your patience. Mr. Barletta. Thank you. The Chair recognizes Mr. DeFazio for 5 minutes. Mr. DeFazio. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I regret I had to step out to go to a hearing upstairs. We should--the committee should look at not scheduling hearings in different subcommittees at the same time. Administrator Fugate, I think you made a number of excellent points. And when you talked about being a ham radio operator, obviously that is a potential backup. But I was recently in Japan and one of their greatest regrets is that they didn't have enough deep ocean sensors, and they underestimated the size of the tsunami. And they did manage to get out a warning with that original estimate before the electrical grid went down in those areas, and they had no further capability of broadcasting and warning people. And therefore, many people sheltered in places that actually were below the crest of the tsunami and died. So they have now moved to a cell phone-based system, and required resilient cell towers to be built. Are we looking at anything like that here, in the U.S.? Mr. Fugate. Yes, sir. Part of the charge you gave us and the FCC was to develop wireless emergency alerts, which, working with the carriers, we actually implemented faster than we thought. So right now, every cell phone being manufactured today is required to be able to transmit a wireless emergency alert, part of the emergency alert system. Tsunami warnings are built into those. So, if there is a triggering event, the originator for that will be the National Weather Service tsunami warning centers. In the case of Oregon it is going to be the Alaska Warning Center. It would go out. It is geocoded to the areas of impact, so those counties and communities at risk would get those notifications over your cell phones. You cannot--you don't have to opt in, you don't have to sign up. The only thing you can do with a cell phone is turn it off and not get the alerts. So, unless you have done that, a tsunami warning would be issued, it would be transmitted upon that point and go out. I think you do point out, though, one of the challenges, which is why we work very closely at the local levels. It is hard to get the magnitude of the tsunami, so the evacuation zones pretty much have to be what is the maximum risk, we got to move now. A phased approach, we generally don't have time, particularly with Cascadia. It is too close to the coast. And that is why we tell people, ``even before you get the warning, if you feel shaking you got to move to higher ground,'' because even with a warning you only have minutes to move. But the cell phone system now, as soon as the Weather Service issues the warning, it will get transmitted to those areas. We have actually seen this occur already. But it has answered this question of what will wake people up in the middle of the night. And your cell phone buzzing and humming and making strange noises was the whole purpose of the wireless emergency alert system. Mr. DeFazio. And when--phones manufactured after what date were required to have that, do you know? Mr. Fugate. It started--I believe it is--I would have to look at the exact date, but it has been about the last--2010, 2011. Mr. DeFazio. OK. Mr. Fugate. That all new handsets--Apple, the iOS, was the last of the handsets to incorporate this in. And so pretty much all the new handsets now have this. And, as we see the replacement cycle of cell phones, we have actually now--third, fourth, fifth replacement cycles. So we are getting good penetration now with those systems. Mr. DeFazio. That is great. Yes, I have actually been on an airplane here where we were held on the ground because of thunderstorms, and everybody's cell phone started buzzing as they had, like, a tornado alert or something. I can't remember what it was. Mr. Fugate. Yes, sir. Mr. DeFazio. So that is great progress. To the Honorable Ms. Hoffman, just on the issue I raised earlier, you know, the transformer issue, it does seem really critical and they are very expensive, they are cumbersome, hard to move. But, I mean, where are you at in evaluating the potential or possibility of having some, you know, backup or replacement transformers in a strategic reserve? Is it--you are analyzing that, or where are you at in that process? Ms. Hoffman. Thank you very much, Congressman, for the question. The transformer reserve plan that was required as part of the FAST Act is in progress. We have contracted with Oak Ridge National Laboratory to do an assessment with respect to transformers, the transportation issues, any sort of where they would be placed, the volumes and size. As you are well aware, the transformers in the United States are quite unique, and we have to also look at a parallel process for how do we look at standardization, look at next generation transformer for additional manufacturing. We are also in the process of assessing transformer manufacturing in the U.S. DOE has had several reports out with respect to transformer manufacturing. There are several manufacturing entities in the U.S., including EFACEC, Georgia Transformer, ABB, Waukesha, Prolec GE and Hyundai. Those are the transformer manufacturers in the U.S. Is that enough for the capacity we need? I would say we need more capacity with respect to transformers. So it is important that we continue to look at a transformer sharing program. So we are in progress and on target to meeting that deliverable for the committee. Mr. DeFazio. So what was the timeline that was established for the---- Ms. Hoffman. The timeline that was established in the FAST Act was 1 year from enactment. So it would be due in December. Mr. DeFazio. OK, great. Are you aware whether or not the regional power administration, the Bonneville Power Administration, is, you know--I mean are you working with them? Because they obviously have most of the--are interlinked in some places with private, but for the most part provide for the, you know power transmission and--high-voltage power transmission. And half of that--well, part of it is DC. So we actually have two different sets of transformers. Ms. Hoffman. So thank you very much for highlighting that. Yes, we are working with the power marketing administrations, which includes WAPA and Bonneville. They are a core asset to the Department of Energy, as well as a core asset to the electric infrastructure writ large. So they are a very important part of the conversation. As required by the FAST Act, we will do consultation with industry and with experts in this area. Mr. DeFazio. OK, thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Barletta. The Chair recognizes Mr. Perry for 5 minutes. Mr. Perry. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Hoffman, the FAST Act you were just discussing includes what you were just discussing, some additional roles and authorities. Can you talk a little further about the importance of the transformer reserve and what your thoughts on that are, particularly? Ms. Hoffman. Thank you very much for the question. The transformers in the United States are a very critical component of the system. The FAST Act recognizes the criticality of these transformers, as well as the need to assess where are we at with respect to any sort of need to develop a plan for transformer spare capacity. So what this means is really evaluating the spare capacity in the United States and the ability to transport transformers. So where should a transformer stockpile, if necessary, be located because of the different sizes and dimensions of the transformers. So part of the plan of what we are looking at with Oak Ridge National Laboratory, our other national laboratories and industry--is assessing the number of transformers, the size of transformers, meaning the different voltage classes, and then where those transformers could potentially be needed to be located because of transportation issues. The industry has had discussions with the Class A railroads and looking at the transportation of transformers. You may not be aware, but a lot of substations are in very remote locations. So really, the criticality and some of the time is not only manufacturing the transformers, but it is actually the transportation of those transformers to a location. Mr. Perry. Will you be considering the timeline for manufacture of transformers, as well, in that study, and when is the--when can we expect the results? Ms. Hoffman. Yes, the--we have started looking and have had several reports out with respect to transformer manufacturing. And those are on DOE's Web site. But the results of that will be included in the report in December. Mr. Perry. Do you discuss cost or reimbursement at all in your report? Ms. Hoffman. So part of the request is to look at policy implications and the cost and financing of that. We are going to work within the Department of Energy with our energy policy and systems analysis group and assess what are some of the financial implications to setting up and developing a transformer reserve. Mr. Perry. All right, thank you. In my opinion, the EPA [Environmental Protection Agency] continues to over-regulate the energy industry. And with that, I don't think they have the ability to determine or examine the requirements. Mr. Fugate, do you--I mean I am sure you are aware, based on what I have here, as of December of 2015 we are retiring-- due to EPA policy, retiring or converting 81,423 megawatts, or 499 units, based on regulation. Has FEMA done an examination of how the EPA regulations affect the grid and the capacity? Are you interested in doing that? Do you know what the capacity is, and do you know the ramification of the loss of the 499 units and the 81,000-plus megawatts? Mr. Fugate. To be honest, Congressman, we really depend upon our partners and DHS that do that. We are not the subject matter experts. We determine for our infrastructure protection what that means and what those impacts are. Having come from the State of Florida, I will tell you that, as we have seen these types of changes, we have seen dependency move from coal fire to natural gas to peaker units. So we had to start planning for what happens there. I actually was in probably a unique experience of having a natural gas pipeline sever due to lightning strike. Knocked out all the natural gas to the southern and middle parts of the State. And we suddenly realized that we had a tremendous dependency on natural gas peaker units, and we were fortunate that we had mild weather. Otherwise, we would have had generator capacity shortfalls that would not be made up. So we---- Mr. Perry. So if I could just---- Mr. Fugate [continuing]. Partners for the information---- Mr. Perry. I got a limited amount of time here. So if FEMA is not doing it particularly, who are you getting the--which partner are you getting that information from? Who is assessing the effect of the regulation, the loss of capacity and the timing of that loss? Who is doing that, of your partners? Mr. Fugate. I would depend upon my partners to the left. We look at energy as a function of Government, because, as you point out, there are numerous parts of the regulatory and response structure. So we concentrate onto function---- Mr. Perry. So, with all due respect, may I ask your partner to the left? Do you have that information? Are you tracking that? Ms. Hoffman. So thank you very much for the question. The Department does look at reliability implications with respect to any sort of change in generation mix in the United States. With respect to the Clean Power Plan, it is really going to be as the States develop their implementation plans the assessment will occur with the regional reliability entities and the independent system operators, where they will coordinate and understand the reliability impacts. Mr. Perry. So you don't know what it is upfront, or you don't assess it as it occurs? You don't know that, you know, so many plants and so much capacity is leaving in Ohio or Pennsylvania or Alabama, you don't know that in advance and make an assessment of the potential risk that is involved? Ms. Hoffman. So--thank you. From a widespread reliability point of view, DOE believes that the Clean Power Plan and the regulations will not have any widespread reliability impacts. But the specific---- Mr. Perry. Well, hold on a second. Hold on. With the chairman's indulgence--you believe that, but do you believe that because you have empirical data to support that belief, or you believe that because somebody is telling you that, or you believe that because you don't have any reason to disbelieve it? Ms. Hoffman. Right now the utilities will work very hard to ensure reliability of the system. And our past experience is, as any sort of any reliability concerns come up, there is strong coordination within the industry to address any sort of reliability impacts. So---- Mr. Perry. So does that mean, if you thought that there was going to be a reliability impact based on the regulation and the capacity reduction that you would essentially exonerate or waive the requirements for a period of time to make sure that the capacity remains? Do you have a policy to do that, or is there a thought to that? Or what is your plan, if you come up against something that doesn't comport with what you think it needs to be, from a capacity standpoint? Ms. Hoffman. Within the Clean Power Plan the States, as they develop their Clean Power Plan, their State plans, they will be coordinating with the reliability entities, the ISOs [independent system operators] and the RTOs [regional transmission organizations], looking at any potential reliability implications, and---- Mr. Perry. But how does that work since, for instance, I live in the PJM, which is a multistate organization? It is not State by State, it is multistates that all feed into the same grid. So how does one State's plan affect another, and how--who coordinates reliability or capacity issues in that regard? Ms. Hoffman. So the States are required, as part of the Clean Power Plan, to coordinate with PJM, and PJM has and will continue to do reliability analysis for that region. Mr. Perry. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate your indulgence. Mr. Barletta. Thank you. The Chair recognizes Mr. Sires. Mr. Sires. Thank you, Chairman and Ranking Member, for holding this hearing. It is very important. I represent the Eighth District of New Jersey, which has Hoboken and some other areas--Jersey City--which got hit very hard by Sandy. And if I learned anything about our infrastructure, it is how unprepared we were for a storm or anything else. And there is plenty of blame to go around. Everybody always points to the Federal Government, but in reality the States could do a lot of things and the locals could do a lot of things and the power companies could do a lot of things. I always think of the example--and I gave this once before to the chairman as an example--there was a generator in the flood zone. And the power company was protecting it with a chain link fence. So when it flooded, obviously, the chain link fence did not hold the water back. So what I am trying to get at is these are the kind of simple things that we can do to protect, you know, this particular transformer. The other thing was in terms of the gas station. You were talking about--I mean we have plenty of gas, quite frankly, but they couldn't pump it. So a simple thing like a small generator to just move the pump and move the gas from the--you know, from the containers to the people, I mean, would it suffice? So when I say to you that everybody has shares of blame in this, I just hope that we have come from Sandy far enough to learn some of these mistakes and we are correcting them. So, Honorable Fugate, would you please tell me that we have come a long way from where we were? Mr. Fugate. We have come a long ways, we haven't gone far enough. And I think, Congressman, you point out what I see is the real challenge, and which cyber highlights. The tendency is to plan for what we are used to dealing with, not for what could happen. And so, again, as you point out, we put a fence around a generator in a flood zone. Well, the reason you have a generator is the power goes out, one of the likely causes for power outages would be a coastal storm. But you hadn't had one in a long time, so you were more concerned about somebody breaking in and damaging the transformer. And that is the trap we fall into. And I think this is what the chairman is raising. Cyber is new. A lot of things we are going to do won't be new in response to the consequences, but if we don't know what we are planning against, we may run the risk of only planning for what we have been used to having, maybe short-term power outages, maybe disruptions that are strictly local, and not plan for what could happen and plan against it. And unfortunately, as you point out, we try to promote these lessons, but it seems to, again, be one of our challenges. How do you get people to change? Let's talk about gas stations. That is a private entity. Putting in a generator is a cost. Most people say, ``well, you could just ship a generator there.'' Doesn't work that well, because most of those utilities were underground and it was hard to get a generator hooked up to it. So in some States that have dealt with this they have put in incentives that gas stations would be required through regulation to put in a transfer switch. It was a good compromise. That way, if they did lose power for long periods of time, we could get generators in there, hook it up, and pump gas. But this is where we got to be very careful. It is easy to say, ``this is the fix'' until you ask who is paying for it. And I think this is the tradeoff of what would make sense, either through incentives, tax credits, regulatory oversight, to get these changes, because I can't ask a business to lose money if their other partners or competitors aren't doing the same thing. And at the same time, you know, the response was, ``you got to put a generator in every gas station.'' That is also not necessarily a great idea, either. But putting in a transfer switch was a good compromise. So again, I think, as we learn these lessons we go back to this trap of we plan for what we have experienced in the past, and that does not always scale up for the future impacts. We have got the lessons learned, we are putting the information out there. But the receptiveness of that audience is oftentimes based upon do they perceive this threat as applying to them. And, as you know for your community, we talk about hurricanes and hurricane evacuations, and most people said, ``we don't have hurricanes, we have northeasters.'' So it is getting people planning. In many cases we know what these impacts are, but it is really the challenge of getting people to plan for what can happen, not what they are prepared to do based upon only their past experiences. As the chairman points out, we have not had a lot of experience with cyber. So part of this, again, is getting--what are we planning against, and then what will we do differently. And if that requires resources, where are those resources coming from? Mr. Sires. I also think that we have to be prepared post- Sandy or post--because one of the issues--we still have problems in New Jersey where people are still out of their homes years later. And to me that is really unacceptable, 2 or 3 years later, that we have these issues where people with the insurance or with the valuation of the property--I mean somehow we have to be prepared for some of these things because it impacts real people. Mr. Fugate. It does. And our experience is, coming out of Hurricane Katrina, 5 years after that we still had over 5,000 families living in travel trailers because we didn't have the right answers. So, rebuilding after disaster is, again, very time consuming. There's a lot of hurdles to go through. And I agree, it is ideal to get people back in their homes as quickly as possible. But that requires a lot of things that go beyond even some of my programs. It is really, as you point out, State and locals and---- Mr. Sires. I am not just putting the blame on you, I am also putting the blame on, you know, the locals and the State, that we should be prepared for any of these storms or whatever we have. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Barletta. Thank you. The Chair recognizes Mr. Massie. Mr. Massie. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am going to yield as much of my time as he might consume to the gentleman from North Carolina. Mr. Meadows. I thank the gentleman from Kentucky for yielding. And, Ms. Hoffman, I want to follow up on one thing. Because, as you talked about the transformers and the--having these backup transformers as a redundancy, one of my major concerns is that decisions that get made by DOE or DHS or FEMA--all the sudden what we do is we transfer that liability to others that are providing service. So what we--you know, right now all utilities have backup transformers, primarily for distribution purposes, but even for larger, you know, transmission-related transformers and switches. However, if you are going to make a decision, it directly impacts rateholders for two reasons. I mean if they are--happen to have $10 million transformers sitting there, I don't know that they can get a return on that investment, necessarily. And so, if you start to extrapolate that out, if it is not in service, you know, it just kind of like--generated capacity, there is a certain length of time that they have in order to bring that online so that they can get a return. But ultimately, it affects the ratepayer, anything that you do. And so, I guess when we start to look at the security implications, what I would encourage both of you to do is look at it as we would from FEMA--is that it is a Federal redundancy that is required, not a redundancy that needs to be done by utility to utility to utility. Do I have that commitment from both of you, that you would look at it as a Federal obligation, versus a private obligation? Ms. Hoffman. Yes, Congressman. Thank you. Mr. Meadows. All right. OK. I see you nodding your---- Ms. Durkovich. Yes, sir. Mr. Meadows. For the record---- Ms. Durkovich. Yes, sir. Mr. Meadows [continuing]. Both of them said yes. And so let me finish with one other, I guess, concern. When we are talking about sharing in a classified setting with the stakeholders, have all of the utilities participated in that secured setting, where you have let them know of both the threats--potential and real threats that we already have experienced? So, you know, you were saying that we have done that in a classified setting, and I just find that interesting. I am not challenging, but I want to drill down on that because I don't know of too many--you know, maybe the big utilities but there are, you know, hundreds of utilities. And so they come in to a classified setting and say, ``this is your risk, this is where it is.'' That is your testimony here today. Ms. Hoffman. So thank you for that question. Information sharing occurs at multiple levels. We do have classified information with the Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council, which is 30 CEOs from across the whole sector, so there are investor-owned utilities, there are municipals, there are co-op utilities that participate in that information sharing, that classified information. In addition we have had 1-day read-ins where we have brought a larger section of utilities in to do classified information sharing. We have done that. DHS has done regional information sharing meetings, where they have had opportunities to bring folks in and do information--so it occurs on multiple levels. Have we hit every single of those---- Mr. Meadows. Yes, and I am not saying--I want it to be systemic, and I guess I will yield back to my good friend from Kentucky here in just a couple of seconds, but I want to make sure that I am clear. As we get to stakeholders what I want it to be is more than just a box that we are checking off. I want EEI [Edison Electric Institute], I want all of the groups that are there to buy in and say, ``we have a plan.'' We do it for mass outages like Sandy and other hurricanes. We haven't done that, I believe, adequately as it relates to cyber. And do I have both of your commitments that you will redouble your efforts to include them as stakeholders? Ms. Hoffman. Yes, yes, we will redouble our efforts. And the one thing that I would say codifies how we are redoubling our efforts is the exercise that happens between industry and utilities where we are actively exercising this. Mr. Meadows. I will yield back to my good friend. Mr. Massie. Thank you. I just have a brief question that occurs to me during Mr. Meadows' question which is, of this classified information, if we sought to get a brief on that would you make yourself available in a classified setting for us, as we contemplate what sort of legislation might be necessary? Ms. Hoffman. Yes, Congressman. We would be glad to have a briefing with you. Mr. Massie. Is that the case for everybody? Ms. Durkovich. Yes, sir. Of course. Mr. Massie. Mr. Fugate? Mr. Fugate. I wouldn't originate most of the data, but I would be there. Most of the origination of the classified information would actually come from my partners to the left. Mr. Massie. Understood. Thank you very much. And I yield back. Mr. Barletta. Thank you. With respect to time for our second panel, we are going to move on. And I think, if I can summarize--and I thank you all for participating today--I think if I could summarize, Administrator Fugate, that planning for local and State governments should be--needs to be in terms of weeks, not days. And that is important because that is the first time I have actually heard what we need to begin to look at in the event of an attack. So again, I want to thank you all for your testimony. Your comments have been very helpful in today's discussion. And we will now call on our second panel. [Pause.] Mr. Barletta. I remind you of the subcommittee's request to limit your oral testimony to 5 minutes. Mr. Cauley, you may proceed. TESTIMONY OF GERRY W. CAULEY, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, NORTH AMERICAN ELECTRIC RELIABILITY CORPORATION; WILLIAM H. SPENCE, CHAIRMAN, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, PPL CORPORATION; AND BOBBI J. KILMER, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, CLAVERACK RURAL ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE Mr. Cauley. Good morning, Chairman Barletta, Ranking Member Carson, and members of the subcommittee. Very glad to be here today, testifying. My name is Gerry Cauley, I am the president and CEO of the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. NERC is a nonprofit international organization overseeing the reliability and security of the power grid in the United States, Canada, and a portion of Mexico. We have authority assigned by Congress to develop and enforce standards affecting reliability and security of the grid, and that authority is overseen by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. We can all agree that electricity is the most critical lifeline sector for national security, for other lifeline sectors like finance, water, and transportation, for the economy, and for public safety. Every day we are reminded of the seriousness of our job related to securing the grid. There have been terrorist attacks in France and Belgium and even here, domestically. There have been cyberattacks and data breaches across various industries and across Government. Of particular relevance to our grid, on December 23, 2015, there was a cyberattack in the Ukraine which was launched against three distribution companies and in which the perpetrators gained control of three distribution companies and were able to put out the lights for 225,000 customers for up to 6 hours. A team from the U.S. went to investigate that incident in the Ukraine, including a member of the NERC staff. And what I can tell you is that the cyberthreats are real, but I think we have a very different situation in the Ukraine as compared to what we have in the United States and North America. Our security controls in North America are very different. We are the only industry with mandatory and enforceable reliability standards affecting physical and cybersecurity. We are currently in the fifth generation of our cybersecurity standards. They are risk-based standards based on NIST-type [National Institute of Standards and Technology-type] controls, so they are adaptable and can keep up with the current threats. We have a very robust compliance monitoring and enforcement program. System operators use modern controls to ensure the security of the system, including separation of corporate and business systems from control systems, physical access controls, patch management, aggressive threat hunting and mitigation, and employee and contractor training, and many other measures that they take. We have established the Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council, as we heard previously, at the highest levels of industry and Government, including CEOs and top officials from Government. The CEOs and boards of power companies take security very seriously, and security is one of their highest priorities on a regular basis. Our Information Sharing and Analysis Center, which you have heard about, the ISAC, provides robust information sharing regarding cyber and physical threats. With the engagement of industry leaders we have recently gone through a review and upgrade of the capabilities of the ISAC, and the ISAC, I believe, is closely integrated with the security operations and information sharing at individual companies, as well as the State fusion centers and other sectors. We also operate a tool called CRISP [Cybersecurity Risk Information Sharing Program], which is a way to monitor the electronic Internet traffic to key sites around the industry, and compare the traffic to threats and vulnerabilities that we are aware of worldwide, and warn the utilities about issues that they may be experiencing in real time. In the unlikely event of a successful cyber or physical attack, I believe that we are well prepared. FERC and NERC recently completed a study of the restoration and recovery capability plans and drills and exercises of nine major companies in the industry, and that report is available publicly, and it is posted on the NERC Web site. But I think it demonstrated that the preparation is there, and that the plans have been exercised. As you have heard before, on November of this past year NERC led what I believe is the largest grid security exercise in the world called GridEx III. Over 400 entities in North America participated. We had over 4,400 registered users and, in my estimation, there were probably closer to 10,000 actual participants. The distributed--this is where we are in a central, controlled place, and we inject the attacks outward, and so the power companies are actually engaged in the exercise locally in their own control centers, in their own substations and power plants. They are receiving the information from us. That portion of the exercise--I apologize for my voice; I am just getting over a cold--that portion of the exercise lasted 2 days and on the second day there was an executive tabletop which brought it all together for senior executives from industry and Government. The scenario included cyberattacks, physical attacks, including active shooters, truck-mounted and explosive devices, and unmanned surveillance drones. This hypothetical event was extreme, and it was intentionally extreme to really go beyond our capability and to test the system. And really, the point was to find out what can we learn and what do we need to do to improve. During the distributed play exercise we caused outages in a simulated fashion--no one was actually controlled or affected, but we simulated 5 million customers who were out. And in-- during the executive session, to invoke all the policy questions at the national level that we were looking to pull out we actually had 15 million customers out and those outages were projected to be extended for weeks and even into months to really push the questions that the chairman is trying to raise today. Participating entities worked through their emergency procedures. They had very extensive contacts with local law enforcement and first responders. And actually, those local government officials and first responders did participate in the exercise. We had--in the exercise we had the White House, DHS, DOE, Department of Defense, Cyber Command, NSA [National Security Agency], NORTHCOM [U.S. Northern Command], FBI [Federal Bureau of Investigation], FEMA, and the Illinois and Wisconsin National Guards are some of the players who participated directly in the executive exercise. A number of key takeaways were to make sure that we are able to better coordinate between industry and Government in terms of the situation assessment, and what do we communicate to the public. It will be a constant race with regard to information to the public. We all know social media and the news are very quick, and we want to make sure that we are getting reliable information out to the public. We are focused on ensuring unity of effort and unity of scale, and that we can resolve all of our resources from both industry and Government together. Looking forward, I would say in this exercise we will continue to expand the role of State and local governments and participants in the exercise to make sure we can exercise some of the things that the chairman is looking to get here, which is how do we engage, how do we inform, and how do we set expectations. And I look forward to your questions, thank you. Mr. Barletta. Thank you for your testimony, Mr. Cauley. Mr. Spence, you may proceed. Mr. Spence. Good morning, Chairman Barletta, Ranking Member Carson, and members of the committee. My name is Bill Spence. I am president, chairman, and CEO of PPL Corporation. We deliver electricity to more than 10 million customers in the U.S. and the U.K. Beyond my role overseeing PPL's operations, I am also on the EEI Policy Committee on Reliability and Business Continuity. I also am a member of the Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council that you heard about earlier today. The ESCC serves as a principal liaison between the Federal Government and the electric power sector to protect against cyberthreats to the Nation's power grid. Protecting the Nation's power grid, as you heard earlier, is not only a top priority of the Federal Government, it is also a top priority for the industry. We have a very strong record of working together closely in all kinds of disasters and storms. Along with our Government partners, we identify, assess, and respond to all threats. The electric sector takes a defense and indepth approach to protecting grid assets. This approach really includes three key elements. The first is rigorous mandatory enforceable and regularly audited reliability standards. Gerry talked about that in his testimony. Also close coordination among industry and with Government partners at all levels. And thirdly, efforts to prepare, respond, and recover, should power grid operations be affected. Our industry already maintains hundreds of spare transformers. I don't believe that came up earlier, but you should be aware of that. In addition, we just recently launched, as an industry, a new project called Grid Assurance. Under Grid Assurance, many of the major utilities in this sector are coming together to establish regional centers where we will not only store spare transformers, but other critical equipment necessary to quickly recover the power system in any type of an event. Among all the critical infrastructure sectors, you should know that the electric sector invests more annually than any other critical infrastructure sector. Last year alone we invested more than $100 billion. Regarding security standards and regulations, as you heard we are subject to NERC's reliability standards. Entities found violating these standards face penalties of up to $1 million per viol"
