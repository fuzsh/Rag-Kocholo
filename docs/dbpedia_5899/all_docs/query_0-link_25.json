        "text": "Robin Hardy, the director of the horror film “The Wicker Man,” which failed at the box office when it was released in 1973 but went on to attract a large cult following, died on Friday. He was 86.\n\nThe University of Malta, where Mr. Hardy had spoken recently, announced on its Facebook page that Victoria Webster, Mr. Hardy’s wife, had informed the school of his death. She did not specify where he died or the cause.\n\nWhen Mr. Hardy, a television director, decided that he wanted to make a horror film, he found an enthusiastic collaborator in Anthony Shaffer, who wrote the play “Sleuth” and the screenplay for the Alfred Hitchcock film “Frenzy.” Mr. Hardy and Mr. Shaffer, partners in a production company, were avid fans of the horror films made by Hammer Studios. Together they set about making a film that would take the Hammer approach in a new direction.\n\nMr. Shaffer, using the novel “Ritual” by David Pinner as a basis, came up with the story of a devout Christian policeman, Sgt. Neil Howie, who travels to a Scottish island to investigate the disappearance of a young girl. In Mr. Hardy’s directorial hands, the island and its inhabitants — led by the priestlike Lord Summerisle, played by Christopher Lee — took on a mystifying aura, with bizarre events unfolding in broad daylight.\n\nSergeant Howie beholds, with growing horror, a pagan society in which sexual rituals are practiced openly and village schoolchildren are encouraged to talk about phallic symbols and other topics not in the usual curriculum. The sense of dread hanging over the film builds to a startling discovery when Sergeant Howie realizes he has been lured to his doom. In the film’s final scene, he is burned alive inside a giant man made of wicker, sacrificed to appease the local gods and ensure a bountiful apple harvest.\n\nEdward Woodward, later the star of the 1980s television series “The Equalizer,’’ played Sergeant Howie. Diane Cilento, who had received an Oscar nomination for her performance as the gamekeeper’s lusty daughter in the 1963 film “Tom Jones,” was the village schoolteacher, and Britt Ekland was cast as Willow, an embodiment of pagan sexuality.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
