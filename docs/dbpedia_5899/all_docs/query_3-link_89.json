        "text": "Australorp\n\nAround the same time that Orpingtons were being developed as a breed, Australorps were as well. Australians liked the black Orpingtons that were being brought over from England, and valued them for their egg laying ability. With maximum egg production in mind, Australians continued to develop their own distrinct breed. The breed went by many names, struggling to distinguish itself from Orpingtons, and finally settled on Australorp in the 1920s.\n\nThese birds are known for their excellent egg production. You’ll easily get 250 light brown eggs per year. The record holding hen laid 364 eggs in a 365 day period, without assistance of artificial lighting.\n\nBarnvelder\n\nBarnvelders are named after the Dutch town of Barnveld. They are a medium sized, dual-purpose bird. They are hardy and make good foragers. They lay a 175–200 brown eggs per year, are good winter layers, and have a calm disposition.\n\nThe original and most well-known variety of this breed is the Double-laced pattern. They have beautiful plumage, with each feather having copper, black, and metallic green coloring. They make an excellent addition to a backyard flock, and are quite the colorful conversation piece.\n\nCinnamon Queen\n\nThe Cinnamon Queen is a modern day production breed that lays brown eggs. They are a cross between a Rhode Island Red rooster and a Rhode Island White hen. At hatching, cockerels are a different color than the pullets so you can be sure of what you are getting—no surprise roosters. They are also known as Golden Comets.\n\nCinnamon Queens were developed specifically for their prolific egg laying ability. Pullets will lay 250-300 eggs per year and start much sooner than heritage breeds. These girls are a perfect fit if you’re looking to start a small egg farm or just want a ton of eggs.\n\nJava\n\nThe Java is the 2nd oldest chicken breed developed in America, going back to 1835. Its ancestors come from the island of Java in the Far East. Javas are an excellent breed for free-ranging homesteads and are known for their egg production and table qualities. Javas come in white, black, mottled, and auburn. The Black Java is known for the brilliant beetle-green sheen of its feathers.\n\nJava hens are broody and good mothers which lay 150-180 large tinted-to-dark brown eggs each year, and well into the winter. With an average life span of 5-8 years, these hens will continue laying long after other breeds have stopped.\n\nMaran\n\nMarans originated in western France and were imported in the 1930s. There are 9 recognized colors: Cuckoo, Golden Cuckoo, Black, Birchen, Black Copper, Wheaten, Black-tailed Buff, White and Columbian. If you find Marans chicks at a feed store, they will most likely be the Black Copper or Cuckoo variety. Hens are active and enjoy free ranging, and also have friendly, outgoing personalities.\n\nMarans are renowned for their dark chocolate brown eggs. If you’re looking for unique eggs, these are quite the conversation piece. You’ll get about 150 – 200 each year in your nesting boxes.\n\nOrpington\n\nOrpington chickens were developed in the town of Orpington, England of all places. During the late 1800s, William Cook wanted to create a new breed that was dual purpose, but had white skin, which the British preferred for meat. Within 10 years, Orpingtons were a favorite in both England and America, and came in a variety of colors – black, white, buff, jubilee, and spangled.\n\nOrpingtons lay about 200 eggs per year. If you’re thinking about adding some to your flock, we suggest the Buff Orpington. They are known for being very docile and they make great family pets.\n\nRhode Island Red\n\nRhode Island Reds are a great choice for beginner chicken-keepers, or expert small flock keepers alike. Developed in Massachusetts and Rhode Island in the late 1800s, these birds are a hardy, dual purpose breed. Since the 1940’s, the Rhode Island Red has been selectively bred for more efficient egg production, becoming smaller, lighter colored, and less broody as a result.\n\nRhode Island Reds are very low maintenance, and can tolerate less than favorable conditions. These birds are very good layers of brown eggs and can lay 200-300 eggs a year starting as early as six months of age.\n\nSussex\n\nThis breed has ancient connections going all the way back to 43 A.D., when the Romans invaded Britain. They grew a reputation of being the finest poultry in Britain, and reached America in 1912. They are a dual-purpose breed and will put on fat very easily, so be careful in feeding them too many treats. If they become too overweight, you will see a decline in egg production.\n\nSussex chickens are a wonderful breed for a small farm or homestead, being active and all-around an excellent breed for meat and eggs. Hens lay an average of 250 light brown eggs each year, and come in three recognized color varieties: Speckled, Red, and Light.\n\nWyandotte\n\nDeveloped in the 1880s, Wyandottes are named after a Native American tribe prevalent in parts of upstate New York and Ontario, Canada. They are thought to be developed from the Dark Brahma and Spangled Hamburgs.\n\nThe Silver Laced Wyandotte was the original color recognized, but since then black, blue, buff, buff Columbian, Columbian, golden laced, partridge, and silver pencilled have been added as recognized color varieties. Wyandottes are friendly, calm, and cold hardy. Hens lay on average 200 light brown eggs per year. They make excellent setters and mothers.\n\nAndalusian\n\nAndalusian chickens are indigenous to Spain. Also called Blue Andalusians, they commonly have slate-blue colored plumage, but depending upon genetics, they can also be off-white or even black. Like other Mediterranean breeds, they have white earlobes. Their light body shape and their large pointed combs make them well-suited for warmer climates.\n\nAndalusians are very active foragers, so think twice if you keep your poultry in a coop and run. They do not do well in confinement, and thrive in a free-range environment. Hens lay about 165 white eggs per year.\n\nGournay\n\n“Le Poule de Gournay,” or the Gournay chicken, is from the upper Normandy region of France. It has ancient ancestry that may date back to the age of Vikings. The Gournay, like many traditional European breeds, suffered during World War I and II. They nearly went extinct, but with the help of local enthusiasts in the early 2000s, there are now around 15,000 of these birds in France.\n\nThese birds weigh 4-7 pounds and have a round body and small head. Their feathers are evenly mottled black and white. They have orange eyes and a thick beak, and a well-developed breast with delicate and flavorful meat. Gourney hens are sweet but will go broody. They lay around 3 white, extra-large eggs per week. The Gournay is easy to tame and handles confinement well, making them a rare but excellent choice for backyard chicken keeping.\n\nHolland\n\nIn 1934, white eggs brought premium prices at market because it was believed that they had a better, more delicate flavor. Most of America’s eggs were produced by small farms at the time. Small farmers prefer dual-purpose chickens because they provide a source of meat as well as eggs. Because dual-purpose chicken breeds tend to lay brown eggs and white egg-laying breeds available at the time were light-weight and not well fleshed, this prompted Rutgers Breeding Farms to set about producing a dual-purpose breed that would lay white eggs. Thus, the Holland was created.\n\nHollands are great backyard chickens. They are calm, good foragers, and the hens will raise their own offspring. They are also great table birds and lay plenty of large eggs. You can also enjoy that they are helping to conserve what is likely the rarest living breed of American chicken.\n\nMinorca\n\nMinorcas are a Mediterranean breed of domestic chicken, and are in fact the largest fowl from this region. They have a greenish-black glossy plumage, and very large, bright red combs and wattles. These help with dissipating heat. They also have very large, almond shaped, white earlobes, common to other Mediterranean fowl.\n\nMinorcas are not broody, but excellent layers of large, white eggs. They are very hardy and rugged, taking well to free range conditions.\n\nBarbu D’uccle\n\nThe Barbu D’uccle is a Belgian bantam breed. They were developed in the town of Uccle on the outskirts of Brussels. These chickens have a beard and muff and full hackle feathers around their neck. Hens weigh about 20 ounces. In the U.S. there are seven recognized varieties: Black, Golden Neck, Mille Fleur, Mottled, Porcelain, Self Blue, and White. The Mille Fleur is a popular variety, translating to a “Thousand Flowers.”\n\nThese birds have sweet, friendly personalities and are known for their mysterious, quirky expressions. Hens lay tiny, cream colored eggs. They are a must have for bantam enthusiasts or anyone with limited space that wants a pet chicken.\n\nBooted Bantam\n\nThe Booted Bantam goes by many names. “Federfuflge Zwerghuhne” in German, “Sabelpoot” in the Dutch, and “Booted Bantam” in the UK and Belgium. They are known for extravagant feathering on their feet and legs. Hens weigh around 22 ounces and roosters around 27 ounces. Almost exclusively an exhibition bird, they can be found in more than 20 color varieties, the most popular of which in the UK is the Lemon Millefleur.\n\nThey are friendly and calm when kept as pets. They are good foragers, and hens will readily go broody. Booted Bantams are very similar to Barbu d’Uccles.\n\nDutch Bantam\n\nOriginating in the Netherlands, the Dutch Bantam is a true bantam breed. They are one of the smallest bantams, only weighing in at about 15 ounces. They can fly rather well because they are small but have large wings.\n\nDutch Bantams are especially hardy and good layers for their size. Hens lay about 160 cream colored eggs per year, although they are small. They have friendly temperaments and make great family pets.\n\nPekin Bantam\n\nPekin Bantams are of Chinese origin and are alleged to have been looted by British soldiers from the private collection of the Emperor of China. They are round birds and have so many feathers that you practically can’t see their feet and legs.\n\nRoosters weigh around 23 ounces and hens weigh around 20 ounces. There is some debate over whether Pekins are a true bantam breed or are just miniature Cochins. Pekins come in a variety of colors. They are docile birds, and with some handing, can make great pets. While hens don’t produce many eggs, they are broody and make good mothers.\n\nRosecomb Bantam\n\nThe Rosecomb Bantam is a true bantam breed, meaning it does not have a larger counterpart. It is one of the oldest bantam breeds, developed in England during the 14th century. Roosters weigh about 26 ounces and hens weigh about 22 ounces.\n\nThey are kept mainly for exhibition and are generally bred for their appearance. Officially recognized colors include black, white, and blue. Unofficially, there are many more feather varieties. They have a very large comb and earlobes for their body size. They stand tall, alert, and proud, and have an “aristocratic” way about them. Hens lay one tiny cream-colored egg each week. They are docile in nature, but not at all friendly. In fact, these birds are high maintenance, and only recommended for serious poultry connoisseurs. They are not the best fit for casual poultry lovers.\n\nSebright\n\nNamed after creator Sir John Sebright in about 1800, the Sebright is one of England’s oldest bantam breeds. They are a true bantam, meaning there is no standard version of the breed. They are small even for a bantam—males weigh about 22 ounces.\n\nSebrights are considered an ornamental breed. They do not lay many eggs but have beautifully laced plumage in silver of gold. Males are “hen feathered” and do not have the typical feathering of a rooster in the tail, saddle, and hackles. Sebrights make good pets because they are active and easily tamed.\n\nSerama\n\nThe Serama is a bantam breed of chicken originating in Malaysia within the last 50 years. The breed is named for the word “Rama,” the title of the Kings of Thailand. Small chickens have always been popular in the area as pets, and are sometimes called pygmy chickens.\n\nSeramas are meant to be small, brave chickens with the persona of a fearless warrior or toy soldier. They have an upright posture and vertical tail feathers, giving their body a V-shape. They are the smallest breed of chicken in the world. Serama roosters and hens alike will weigh about 1/2 pound to 1 pound.\n\nBarbezieux\n\nThe Barbezieux originated in France during the Middle Ages. These birds are impressive in the coop and on the table. Adult birds weigh 9 to 12 pounds, and roosters can grow up to 2 feet tall. They are considered the tallest chicken in Europe. They have iridescent, beetle black feathers, and an oversized comb and wattles. They have white skin and blue legs.\n\nHens lay a good amount of white eggs, should you want to keep some in your flock as layers. Their meat is ultra-premium. Some foodies claim it’s even better than the famous Bresse. Barbezieux meat is firm and has a very distinct flavor, with notes of wild game. The roasted skin is golden and has a light wheat scent.\n\nBresse\n\nThe Bresse is hailed as the best tasting chicken in the world. Similar to French Champagne, birds must be raised within the legally defined area of the historic region of Bresse, in eastern France. To maintain the strictest quality standards, the raising and selling of Bresse chickens is rigidly controlled by the French government. There are rules about how much land they must have access to, what they must be fed, and how they must be processed. There are only about 200 breeders that producing 1.2 million birds annually.\n\nWhen you purchase a Bresse chicken it will have a leg band to prove authenticity. It will also cost you over $20 per pound. Bresse chickens are colored like the French flag – red comb, white body, and blue legs.\n\nGallina di Saluzzo\n\nThe Gallina di Saluzzo, Italian for “the white hen of Saluzzo,” is from the Piedmont in Italy. It is a rustic breed and was once widespread throughout the region. Small family farms are common in the area, and the animals traditionally raised there were intended for family consumption. With the increase of intensive and commercial agriculture, this breed almost disappeared completely, along with other pasture-raised breeds in the area. Recovery efforts began in 1999 to revive the breed because of it’s historical significance to the region.\n\nThe Gallina di Saluzzo is a dual-purpose breed. While hens lay about 180 white eggs per year, this breed really shines on the dinner table. Due to extensive breeding and very specific feeding techniques, the quality of their meat is exceptional. They are a classic looking chicken: all white feathers with a red comb and wattles, a yellow beak, and yellow feet. They weigh about 4 – 6 pounds, making them a medium to small-sized bird.\n\nIxworth\n\nThe Ixworth was created in the 1930s England, by Reginald Appleyard. In the Ixworth, he envisioned the ideal dual-purpose breed that would be an active forager, produce eggs, and make a hearty meal.\n\nThese birds are very cold hardy given their pea comb and almost non-existent wattles. Both hens and roosters have a stocky body, pure white feathers, white skin, and pea comb. While they are better designed for the table, hens also lay a decent number of tinted eggs.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNew Hampshire chickens have only been around since the 1930s and are closely related to the classic Rhode Island Red (RIR). Starting with RIRs, breeders were very selective and intensified traits of early maturity, rapid full feathering, and production of large brown eggs. These birds are a rich chestnut color, slightly lighter in shade than RIRs.\n\nNew Hampshires are a dual-purpose breed, but are intended more for the table than for egg production. They prefer to free range and are known to be competitive with the rest of the flock.\n\nRedcap\n\nThe Redcap is an egg-laying breed from England named after their very large rose comb. It is one of the older English breeds, but exact time is unclear. The Redcap was bred so much for utility that they are lacking in appeal. Their coloring, wild temperament, and generally unrefined quality led them to fall out of favor by 1900.\n\nThe breed has red plumage tipped with a blue-black, half-moon shaped spangle and leaden blue colored legs. During the early to mid-1800’s the Redcap chicken was considered one of the most profitable fowls a farmer could have. They have delicate meat, and even though they have red earlobes, can lay 150-200 white eggs.\n\nVorwerk\n\nThe Vorwerk was developed in 1900 by Oskar Vorwerk in Hamburg, Germany. His goal was to create a medium-sized, dual-purpose breed with the same feather pattern as the Lakenvelder. Vorwerks are hardy, adaptable, alert, and active. They mature quickly, are pretty good at flying for a chicken. This makes them great candidates for free range flocks.\n\nBirds are typically 4 – 8 pounds and hens lay about 170 large cream eggs per year. They are a golden buff color, with solid black head, neck, and tail. They are often confused with Golden Lakenvelders, but are a separate breed. This is perhaps the reason why Vorwerks never gained popularity, therefore they are rare outside of Europe.\n\nAppenzeller\n\nThe Appenzeller originated in Switzerland and comes in 2 varieties. The Spitzhauben—named for a women’s hat—has a V-comb and feather crest. The Barthuhner (“bearded hen”) has a rose comb and no crest. Color varieties include black, golden spangled, and silver spangled.\n\nThis breed is mainly ornamental, but hens do lay a respectable number of white eggs. These birds prefer to range rather than be cooped because they are active and good foragers. Appenzellers are also small bodied enough that they are able to roost up in trees.\n\nCrevecoeur\n\nThe Crevecoeur is one of the oldest breeds in France. It is named for a small town in Normandy and translates to “broken heart.” Although popular in France, the breed hasn’t quite caught on in other countries.\n\nCrevecoeur chickens are solid black and have a distinctive V-shaped comb. They are quiet and have peaceful temperaments. They are primarily a meat bird and only lay a moderate amount of white eggs – about 120 per year. Choose this breed for your flock if you are looking for a producer of outstanding meat, moderate egg production….and an interesting pet.\n\nPolish\n\nThe Polish chicken is immediately recognizable by the crest of feathers that almost covers its entire head. The breed’s origins are unclear, but it was standardized in the Netherlands. They arrived in America in 1830 and became fairly widespread.\n\nPolishes were originally bred as productive egg layers of white eggs. Nowadays they are considered more of an ornamental breed. They are vulnerable to aerial predators because their crests can obscure their vision. Polish rarely go broody and are noted for their white eggs. There are bearded, non-bearded and frizzle varieties.\n\nCochin\n\nCochins, along with Brahmas, are responsible for the “hen fever” that over took poultry keepers in American and England in 1850. No doubt they are helping fuel the newest obsession with backyard chicken keeping. Cochins were developed in China. They are very large in size (up to 10 pounds), have an abundance of feathers, and are calm in disposition. Like Brahmas, they are very hardy in cold climates.\n\nCochins are known for being very broody, so much so that roosters will occasionally brood chicks. So, if you’re looking to hatch your own chicks, consider a Cochin hen to raise them. They are even considered the best choice for hatching and raising ducks and turkeys. Cochins are bred in several color patterns: Buff, Partridge, White, Black, Silver Laced, Golden Laced, Blue, Brown, and Barred.\n\nMalay\n\nThe Malay chicken is an ancient landrace breed. It is supposed to have descended from the great Malay fowls of India. These birds are extremely tall. They can reach heights of up to 30 inches. They are said to be able to eat grain off the dining table.\n\nMalays are not suited for egg or meat production. But they have been useful in crossing with other breeds and revitalizing threatened breeds. Many developed breeds of chicken have Malay ancestry mixed in. Malays have a unique appearance, aside from height. The expression of a Malay is snarky and cruel. The crow of the rooster is more like a roar. They are very hardy and impressive birds.\n\nSilkie\n\nSilkies are an ancient breed originating in the Far East, most likely China. They were first documented by Marco Polo himself around the year 1300. He encountered a travel with “a furry chicken.” Silkies are arguably the most popular and beloved of all ornamental breeds. They are the pocket pet of the chicken world, with sweet and friendly temperaments and feathers that feel more like hair. Because they are so tame, they are easily bullied by other birds. They are very broody, devoted mothers to anything that hatches from an egg and will even adopt other chicks.\n\nSilkies have black skin and black bones, a walnut-shaped comb, and turquoise earlobes. Their fuzzy feathers come in a variety of colors, but because of the feather structure they can’t fly and are not waterproof. If they get wet, they need to be dried with a towel before they catch a chill.\n\nAltsteirer\n\nThe Altsteirer is an ancient breed that may be thousands of years old, but the first record of its existence is from the 13th century. It originated in the Styria region of Austria and Slovenia and is one of the first identified breeds in Europe. Several of this breed’s physical characteristics also appear in chickens around Europe, suggesting that it was used to develop other breeds.\n\nThe Altsteirer is a dual purpose breed of medium size. Hens lay 180 – 200 large white eggs per year and rarely go broody. Birds can weigh 4 – 8 pounds, and their round body makes a nice meal for the table. They are found in a variety of colors, including partridge, white, cuckoo, and black-breasted red. This breed is rare and is considered endangered. If you are looking for an easy to care for and very unique breed, this may be the one for you.\n\nCalifornia Grey\n\nDeveloped in California in the 1930s by James Dryden, professor of poultry science. He wanted a dual-purpose hen laying large white eggs that remained in her egg-laying prime for longer than 2 years. He crossed a Barred Plymouth Rock rooster with a White Leghorn hen, which resulted in a naturally autosexing breed with grey barred plumage.\n\nBirds are between 4 – 6 pounds, which makes them too large to appeal to commercial egg producers. They were also never recognized by the American Poultry Association. This means they never enjoyed popularity and today are a rare find. If you manage to have this breed in your flock, you’re a lucky one. These birds are calm, good winter layers, and given the intent of their creator, should produce lots of eggs in their lifetime.\n\nCatalana\n\nCatalanas were developed near Barcelona in the district of Catalonia, Spain. This breed was introduced to the rest of the world at the 1902 World’s Fair held in Madrid. They have rich buff plumage, ranging from a light tan buff to a more red-gold buff. Both sexes have black tails with a green shimmer green. Chicks are hardy and are a buffish color with a faint chipmunk pattern along their backs.\n\nThey are a hardy, dual-purpose breed, with the style, alertness, and forage abilities typical of Mediterranean breeds. Catalanas are noted for being very heat tolerant. They lay about 200 – 240 white to light pink medium/large eggs per year and are not generally broody.\n\nDampierre\n\nEver wonder what happens when a breed goes extinct? The Normande chicken in France did just that and died out more than a century ago. This breed closely resembled its cousin, the Gournay, with the same black and white mottled coloring, but with a feather crest on its head. So is it just gone forever? Sort of. The exact Normande hasn’t returned, but instead has been re-created by poultry enthusiasts. This new breed, resembling the old breed, is known as the Dampierre. It was created in France in 1996 using Gournay and Crevecouer genetics. Since then, the breed continues to be improved and standardized with great attention to detail to resemble the Normande as closely as possible.\n\nDampierres are dual-purpose, with fine white meat and delicate bones. Hens lay a productive number of large white eggs and are willing to go broody. This breed is only just beginning to make an appearance in the U.S. They are hard to come by and very expensive. If you manage to get your hands on these birds, you must be dedicated to advancing the breed by only raising birds that meet the breed standard.\n\nDeathlayer\n\nThe Deathlayer (Totleger, in its native German) is over 400 years old and was once commonly found on German farms. Their popularity declined over the centuries, and now they are considered rare. Why the name Deathlayer? One theory is that it’s because hens will lay an egg a day up until the day they die.\n\nThis breed is very striking in appearance, with iridescent greens and purple in their black body feathers and silver hackles. They have cushion combs and large dark eyes. The hens are super productive, laying medium-sized white eggs. They are very active birds and should be kept free range. They prefer to sleep in trees if given the option.\n\nDorking\n\nThe history of the Dorking is similar to that of the Sussex. An ancient breed with ties to the Roman Empire, the Dorking was developed to be a superior table bird. Dorkings are gentle birds that are known to be calm, friendly, and tolerant, but likely to end up on the bottom of the pecking order if kept with other more aggressive breeds.\n\nThey have a long back and a broad breast, and have been described as “stocky” or “boxy-looking” in shape. Hens make excellent winter layers, and are exceptional mothers. They welcome chicks from other hens and tend to look after chicks far longer than other hens.\n\nIowa Blue\n\nThe Iowa Blue was developed in the early 1900s near Decorah, Iowa. A folk legend tells the story of a white Plymouth Rock hen emerging from under a building with a clutch of chicks that were colored solid chestnut to striped. Old-timers tell the tale that the chicks were sired by a pheasant.\n\nIowa Blues are a practical, dual-purpose, homesteader chicken. They are fairly docile but excellent foragers. Hens have good mothering instincts and roosters are brave protectors of their flock. This breed almost went extinct in the 1980s and are still very rare. Fortunately, they are making a comeback thanks to some dedicated breeders and poultry keepers.\n\nLangshan\n\nLangshans originated in China near the Yangtszekiang River and made its way to England in 1872. The breed is valued for being a large bird, with quality meat, that lays a high volume of dark brown, purplish eggs. Landshans are a tall breed with great depth of body that is unique to this breed. Males weigh 9.5 lbs. and females 7.5 lbs.\n\nLangshans are hearty birds and good foragers. They are hardy, fast growing, and easily reared. They have tight feathering and can fly better than most other chickens. Hens are not dependable sitters but make excellent mothers once the chicks have hatched.\n\nMarsh Daisy\n\nThe Marsh Daisy is a very rare breed originating in Lancashire, England, and has not made a name for itself in other countries. It’s a bird with a fancy name and a practical nature. These birds are slow to mature, but once grown, are very hardy and excellent foragers and flourish in free range environments. Hens lay about 200 cream colored eggs each year.\n\nThe Marsh Daisy chicken may be one of the rarest chicken breeds worldwide. It never achieved popularity abroad, was never recognized by the American Poultry Association and is little known or seen outside the UK.\n\nNorwegian Jaehorn\n\nThe Jaehorn is the only breed of domestic chicken indigenous to Norway. They were developed in 1920 near the town of Stavenger. They have only recently made their way to North America and are still a rare find in the U.S.\n\nThey come in two colors: dark brown and light brown. Hens can lay an impressive 215 white eggs per year. Jaehorns are small, hardy, and active birds. They are great flyers due to their size. So be aware, these chickens may try to fly the coop.\n\nOrloff\n\nOrloffs were previously believed to have originated in Russia, however modern research indicates they first appeared in Persia and were brought to Europe and Asia in the 17th century. The breed became popular through promoter Count Alexei Grigoryevich Orlov in the 19th century.\n\nOrloffs are tall and well adapted to the cold. They are tight feathered, head and neck are very densely feathered, and they have tiny combs, earlobes, and wattles. The hens lay a good amount of light brown eggs and are relatively calm.\n\nOrust\n\nThe Orust is a landrace breed from the west coast of Sweden. This breed free ranged along the isolated rocky shores and is a proven survivor, eating whatever was available, including fish. This breed is considered extremely rare.\n\nThey have black and white mottled feathers, and their legs can sometimes have the same pattern. As a unique trait, roosters’ wattles turn from red to bright violet when they are agitated and protecting their hens. The hens are prolific egg layers, and they produce a small to medium-sized white eggs.\n\nPavlovskaya\n\nPavlovskayas are Russia’s most ancient chicken breed. They were used in developing newer breeds like the Polish and the Brabanter. This breed nearly went extinct. In the 1990s, the total population consisted only of 2 roosters, and one of them was infertile. Very careful breeding programs rehabilitated the breed, however it is still super rare and virtually unknown outside of Russia.\n\nThis breed is well adapted to its native climate of extreme cold. These tiny birds are only 3 – 4 pounds. They have a v-shaped comb accompanied by a crest, beard, muffs, and completely feathered legs and toes. They have a pleasant personality and are curious, lively, and trustful. The hens only lay about 70 – 90 white eggs per year. Their meat is light and gamey.\n\nPenedesenca\n\nThe Penedesenca originated in the region of Catalonia, in Spain. They are named after the town Vilafranca del Penedes and were developed from native backyard birds. This breed is extremely rare. In fact, they almost went extinct. In the 1980s, some breeders dedicated themselves to reviving the Penedesenca.\n\nThis breed is known for the very dark brown eggs that the hens produce. They are said to be the darkest brown of any breed. They come is a few color varieties: Black, Crele, Partridge, and Wheaten. They have white earlobes, red wattles, and an unusual carnation comb.\n\nRhodebar\n\nThe Rhodebar is a breed that we wish wasn’t quite so rare. Hailed as “an absolute gift for the small poultry enthusiast”, these birds have so many great qualities. Originally created at the University of British Columbia in the 1940s, the Rhodebar involves a cross of Rhode Island Reds and Plymouth Barred Rocks. A version of the breed was also created in the U.K. by crossing a Danish strain of Rhode Island Red with Golden Brussbars.\n\nRhodebars are autosexing, meaning males and females have different coloring at the time of hatch. Males are yellow, and females have dark stripes of barring down their backs. This makes them easy to differentiate, so you stand an excellent chance of knowing if you’ve got future hens or roosters in the bunch.\n\nThis is a dual-purpose breed. Hens are great layers of brown tinted eggs. You can expect about 180 – 200 eggs per year. Birds weigh between 6 – 9 pounds and dress out nicely for the table. Since it was developed just before the dawn of commercial hybrid breeds, it only enjoyed brief popularity, and is now very rare. Those who continue to breed and raise Rhodebars are very devoted to maintaining the exceptional qualities of this breed.\n\nThuringian\n\nThuringians were developed in 19th century Germany, in the Thuringian Forest. They were intended to be a dual-purpose breed, but are now seen mainly at poultry shows. They are very rare. They have a distinctive beard, muffs, and a very small comb. This makes them well-suited for cold climates, and gives them a cute, chubby-cheeked appearance.\n\nThey are friendly, tame, and make good pets. It is said that different color varieties each have different personalities. They are confidant and like to explore, preferring to free range rather than be confined to a coop. Hens lay about 160 eggs per year. They do not go broody often, but when they do, they are very defensive mothers.\n\nTwentse\n\nTwentses (Dutch), also known as Kraienkoppes (German), are a large breed of chicken from an area spanning between Germany and the Netherlands. They are rumored to be the result of Leghorn and Malay crosses and are sporty, ornamental birds that also have good egg production. Hens lay about 200 off-white eggs per year.\n\nThey have small wattles, earlobes, and walnut comb—all bright red in color. This rare breed is an excellent forager in both free range and confined conditions. The Twentse is usually kept as a layer or as a show bird.\n\nAyam Cemani\n\nThe Ayam Cemani is a unique breed with a striking in appearance. Originating from the island of Java, they have black plumage, black skin, black muscles, black bones, even black organs. They have a gene that causes hyperpigmentation (Fibromelanosis). While their blood is still red, it is very dark. Due to their exotic appearance, in Asia their meat is considered to have mystic powers.\n\nThey are friendly birds, hardy, low maintenance, and easy to handle. Hens lay a moderate amount of cream colored eggs that are relatively large in proportion to their body size. Consider yourself lucky if you can find a bird of this breed since they are extremely rare and can be expensive.\n\nCubalaya\n\nThe Cubalaya is the only breed developed in Cuba. It is descended from Sumatra and Malay birds brought to Cuba from the Philippines. They were selectively bred to be impressive in appearance, with a courageous expression. Roosters have flowing hackle feathers and a “lobster tail” – a downward angled tail with lavish feathering. Their look is truly unique to the breed.\n\nThese birds are very tame, with a friendly and curious disposition. They very heat tolerant and perfect for regions with long hot summers. The hens are reliable layers, lay small eggs and are good brooders.\n\nFavorelles\n\nThe Favorelles is a French breed of chicken. They are considered a heavy breed, and have a beard, muffs, feathered feet, and 5 toes per foot. They are also known for their round shape.\n\nAs this breed is energetic, adaptable and curious and gets along with people of all ages making them a popular choice in home flocks as egg layers and pets. At the same time, their gentleness can cause them to be picked on by other birds, so watch out for bullies. Favorelles hens are excellent sitters and mothers. they have been known to lay from 150 to over 200 eggs per year.\n\nLakenvelder\n\nLakenvelders are sometimes known as “Shadows on a Sheet,” because in Dutch the name translates to white spread over a black field. They are beautiful birds with blue legs, deep red eyes, and long flowing tails. They have single combs and you will see that even the females’ combs stand tall.\n\nLakenvelders are known not just for their beauty, but also their egg laying abilities. They lay about 175 porcelain white eggs per year. They are great foragers and very active, but they are wary. These birds will not cuddle with your kids.\n\nPhoenix\n\nThe Phoenix chicken is a German creation from the long-tailed fowls of Japan. The first president of the National German Poultry Association, Mr. Hugo du Roi, is credited with the creation of the breed. His intent was to reinvigorate the small population of long-tailed fowl in Europe. Some say the name “Phoenix” was given to the resultant chickens to acknowledge the seeming “rise from the ashes” of their soon lost parents.\n\nThe Phoenix chicken is an alert breed with a pheasant-like appearance. They are fair layers that can go broody. The chicks are hardy, but require extra protein when their tails are growing. The breed thrives when it can roam at large with plenty of freedom.\n\nSicilian Buttercup\n\nSicilian Buttercups originated on the island of Sicily, and were imported to the U.S., Britain, and Australia in the early 20th century. They are named for their very unique comb. It is a cup-shaped crown with a complete circle of medium sized regular points. No other breed has this type of comb.\n\nThe Sicilian Buttercup is famous not only for its unique comb type, but also for its incredibly beautiful color pattern. A female Buttercup is considered the most beautiful and has an overall golden-buff color, with pure golden hackle feathers on the neck. On the rest of the body, these golden feathers are marked with small, black, diagonal spangles, creating a beautiful and unique color pattern. These birds are active foragers, preferring to free range. They lay a modest number of small eggs — about 180 in a year. This breed is very friendly, making them a great pet.\n\nSwedish Black (Svarthöna)\n\nSwedish Blacks, translated from Svarthöna in their native Swedish, are an ultra-rare and exotic breed. While the breed was developed on the border of Norway and Sweden, these birds have ancestry tracing back to Indonesia. Like their cousins, the rare Ayam Cemani and the more common Silkie, Svart Hönas have fibromelanistic genetic traits, making them entirely black. While they look similar to the Ayam Cemani, they have a more refined and less gamey appearance.\n\nSvarthönas are small and sleek, with birds weighing 5 – 8 pounds. They thrive in free-range flocks. Their flying abilities are above average, and if given the chance will choose to roost high off the ground. Hens are excellent layers of cream colored eggs, which are very large in relation to their small body size. Roosters are very alert and excellent protectors of the flock. They are very friendly and seek out human interaction and affection.\n\nWhite Faced Black Spanish\n\nThe Black Spanish is a regal bird that holds itself with the posture of aristocrats. This ancient breed is lustrous green-black, with a distinguishing white face and enormous white earlobes. Males weigh 8 lbs. and females weigh 6.5 lbs.\n\nBlack Spanish hens were hugely popular in the 1800s for their ability to lay an abundant amount of large white eggs. They are not a cuddly breed, but prefer to roam, and are not happy being confined. They are not an aggressive breed, but would be aloof in a flock with other breeds. They are also vocal. They ultimately lost favor with farmers because they are fairly delicate birds, and hardier breeds came along."
