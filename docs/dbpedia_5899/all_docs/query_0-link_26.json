        "text": "\"Tinderbox,\" is a new musical stagework reimagining a unique and significant moment in literary and personal history - the meeting between popular 19th-century authors Hans Christian Andersen and Charles Dickens, both of whose works continue to delight today. Music by Stephen Guy Daltry, libretto by Stephen Guy Daltry & Maureen Thomas.\n\nSet in Dickens' home at Gadshill Place, Kent in the summer of 1857, 'Tinderbox' is an exploration of friendship, creativity, domestic tension and feeling, wrapped in the magic of storytelling and music."
