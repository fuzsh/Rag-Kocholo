        "text": "Jeffrey Nero \"Jeff\" Hardy (August 31, 1977) is an American professional wrestler, singer-songwriter, painter and musician. He is known for his time in World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) andAll Elite Wrestling (AEW).\n\nEarly life[]\n\nHardy is the son of Gilbert and Ruby Moore Hardy and the younger brother of Matt Hardy. Their mother died of brain cancer in 1986, when Hardy was nine. He developed an interest in motocross aged 12 and got his first bike, a Yamaha YZ-80, at age 13. He had his first race when he was in ninth grade. Hardy played baseball as a child, but had to stop after he crashed during a motocross race, injuring his arm. He also played football during high school as a fullback and linebacker. He briefly competed in amateur wrestling in high school. He had to stop playing sports in high school, after he was ordered to pick between professional wrestling and playing sports, and he chose wrestling. Hardy's favorite subjects in school were U.S. history and art, which he did for extra credit.\n\nProfessional wrestling career[]\n\nWorld Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (1998-2003)[]\n\nThe Hardy Boyz (1998–2002)[]\n\nThe Hardy brothers were signed to a contract by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1998. They were trained by Dory Funk Jr. in his Funkin' Dojo with other notable wrestlers such as Kurt Angle, Christian, Test, and A-Train. When the team was finally brought up to WWF television, after months of 'jobbing' and live events, they formed the acrobatic tag team called The Hardy Boyz. While feuding with The Brood in mid-1999, they added Michael Hayes as their manager. On July 5, they won their first WWF World Tag Team Championship by defeating the Acolytes, but lost it back to them a month later. After the dissolution of the Brood, the Hardys joined forces with Gangrel as The New Brood and feuded with Edge and Christian. This stable did not last long, however, and on October 17, 1999 at No Mercy, the Hardy Boyz won the managerial services of Terri Runnels in the finals of the Terri Invitational Tournament in the WWF's first ever tag team ladder match against Edge and Christian.\n\nIn 2000, the Hardy Boyz found a new manager in their real-life friend Lita. Together, the three became known as \"Team Xtreme\". They continued their feud with Edge and Christian throughout 2000, defeating them for the WWF World Tag Team Championship on two occasions. At SummerSlam the Hardy Boyz competed in the first ever Tables Ladders and Chairs match (TLC match), for the Tag Team Championship against the Dudley Boyz and Edge and Christian, but were unsuccessful.\n\nHardy gained attention for his high risk stunts in the TLC matches in the year 2000, 2001, and 2002. He made a name for himself as one of the most seemingly reckless and unorthodox WWF performers of his time. In 2001, Hardy received a push as a singles competitor, and he held the WWF Intercontinental (defeating Triple H), Light Heavyweight (defeating Jerry Lynn) and Hardcore Championships (defeating Mike Awesome and Rob Van Dam on two separate occasions). At the end of 2001, the Hardys began a storyline in which they began to fight, which led to Matt demanding a match at Vengeance, with Lita as the special guest referee. After Hardy beat Matt at Vengeance, while Matt's foot was on the ropes, Hardy and Lita began feuding against Matt. In the middle of the feud, however, Hardy faced The Undertaker in a Hardcore Championship match and lost. After the match, the Undertaker was scripted to attack both Hardy and Lita, injuring them. On the next episode of SmackDown!, the Undertaker also attacked Matt, also injuring him, in storyline. The Hardys and Lita were not seen again until the Royal Rumble, because WWE did not have another storyline for their characters. The Hardys later came back as a team, and there was never any mention of their previous storyline split.\n\nIn early April 2002, the Hardy Boyz began a feud with Brock Lesnar after Lesnar gave Matt an F-5 on the steel entrance ramp, which led to an angered Hardy seeking revenge on Lesnar. At Backlash, Hardy faced-off against Lesnar in his first televised match. Lesnar dominated Hardy and won the match by knockout. Lesnar and the Hardys continued to feud over the next few weeks, with the Hardys coming out victorious only once by disqualification. At Judgement Day, Lesnar gained the upper hand on the Hardy Boyz before tagging his partner (and manager), Paul Heyman, in to claim the win for the team. In July 2002, Hardy won his third Hardcore Championship by defeating Bradshaw.\n\nSingles competition (2002–2003)[]\n\nAfter years in the tag team division, Hardy took on The Undertaker in a ladder match for the Undisputed Championship. Hardy came up short, but earned the Undertaker's respect. Hardy competed for singles titles on several occasions and defeated William Regal for the WWE European Championship. Hardy was defeated a few weeks later by Rob Van Dam in a match to unify the European Championship and the Intercontinental Championship, and the European Championship was dropped. Finally, the Hardy Boyz split apart, as Hardy continued to pursue his singles ambitions on Raw and his brother, Matt was drafted to the SmackDown! brand.\n\nIn January 2003, he briefly turned into a heel after he attacked Van Dam and Shawn Michaels. It ended a month later when he saved Stacy Keibler from an attack by then-villain, Christian. In February, he had a brief program with Michaels, which saw the two team up. Then, in storyline, Hardy began dating Trish Stratus after saving her from Steven Richards and Victoria in March. Hardy and Stratus had a brief on-screen relationship that saw the duo talking backstage, kissing, and teaming together in matches. Hardy, however, was released from WWE on April 22, 2003. The reasons given for the release were Hardy's erratic behavior, drug use, refusal to go to rehab, deteriorating ring performance, as well as constant tardiness and no-showing events. Hardy also cites \"burn out\" and the need for time off as reasons for leaving WWE.\n\nTime off and independent circuit (2003)[]\n\nHardy made his first wrestling appearance after being released from WWE at an OMEGA show, on May 24. Using his old gimmick, \"Willow the Wisp\", Hardy challenged Krazy K for the OMEGA Cruiserweight Championship, but lost the match. Hardy performed with the Ring of Honor (ROH) promotion on one occasion. Hardy appeared at ROH's 2003 show, Death before Dishonor under his \"Willow the Wisp\" gimmick, wearing a mask and trench coat. Hardy was quickly unmasked and lost his jacket, wearing attire similar to that he wore in WWE. Hardy was booed and heckled before, during, and after the match by the ROH audience, who chanted \"We want Matt!\" and \"You were fired!\" during his match with Joey Matthews and Krazy K, which Hardy won. Hardy then took a whole year off of wrestling to concentrate on motocross and finish his motocross track.\n\nTotal Nonstop Action Wrestling (2004–2006)[]\n\nHardy debuted in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) on June 23, 2004, at the Second Anniversary Show, in a match against TNA X Division Champion A.J. Styles, for the title. He also debuted his new entrance theme \"Modest\", a song performed by Hardy himself, and a new nickname, \"The Charismatic Enigma\". The match ended in a no contest when Kid Kash and Dallas interfered. Hardy returned to TNA on July 21 and was awarded a shot at the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Hardy challenged for the title on September 8, losing to NWA World Heavyweight Champion Jeff Jarrett. In October 2004, he won a tournament, earning a shot at the NWA World Heavyweight Championship on November 7 at Victory Road, TNA's first monthly pay-per-view. Hardy was defeated by Jarrett once again in a ladder match at Victory Road following interference from Kevin Nash and Scott Hall. One month later at Turning Point, Hardy, Styles and Randy Savage defeated Jarrett, Hall and Nash (collectively known as the Kings of Wrestling). Hardy went on to defeat Hall in a singles match, substituting for Héctor Garza at Final Resolution on January 16, 2005\n\nAt Against All Odds in February 2005, Hardy lost to Abyss in a \"Full Metal Mayhem\" match for the number one contendership to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. Hardy returned the favor by defeating Abyss in a Falls Count Anywhere match at Destination X in March. Hardy then went on to feud with Raven, with Hardy booked to defeat Raven in a steel cage match at Lockdown in April. Hardy was suspended from TNA after no-showing his \"Clockwork Orange House of Fun\" rematch with Raven at Hard Justice on May 15, allegedly due to travel difficulties. Hardy's suspension was lifted on August 5, and he returned at Sacrifice approximately a week later, attacking Jeff Jarrett. He wrestled his first TNA match in four months at Unbreakable on September 11, losing to Bobby Roode following interference from Jarrett. Throughout October 2005, Hardy became embroiled in a feud with Abyss, Rhino and Sabu. The four-way feud culminated in a Monster's Ball match at Bound for Glory on October 23, which Rhino won after delivering a second rope Rhino Driver to Hardy. In the course of the match, Hardy delivered a Swanton Bomb to Abyss from a height of approximately 17 ft 0 in (5.18 m). Later that night, Hardy competed in a ten-man battle royal for the number one contendership to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, which Rhino also won. At Genesis in November, Hardy lost to Monty Brown in another number one contender match.\n\nHardy was scheduled to wrestle on the pre-show of Turning Point in December 2005, but once again no-showed the event, again citing traveling problems. Hardy was suspended as a result and did not appear on TNA television again. In March, April, and May 2006, Hardy appeared on several live events promoted by TNA in conjunction with Dave Hebner and the United Wrestling Federation.\n\nReturn to World Wrestling Entertainment (2006-2009)[]\n\nRaw (2006)[]\n\nOn August 4, 2006, WWE announced that Hardy had re-signed with the company. In the following weeks, vignettes aired hyping his return on the August 21 episode of Raw. On the day of his return, Hardy received a push and defeated then-WWE Champion Edge by disqualification when Lita pulled Edge out of the ring. After failing to capture the Intercontinental Championship from Johnny Nitro over the next few weeks, including at Unforgiven, Hardy finally defeated Nitro to win his second Intercontinental Championship on the October 2 episode of Raw. On the November 6 episode of Raw, Hardy lost the Intercontinental Championship back to Nitro, after Nitro hit him with the Intercontinental Championship title belt. One week later, Hardy regained it on the November 13 episode of Raw, with a crucifix pin. This marked Hardy's third reign as Intercontinental Champion.\n\nThe Hardys reunion (2006–2007)[]\n\nOn the November 21 episode of ECW on Sci Fi Hardy teamed with his brother, Matt, for the first time in almost five years to defeat the Full Blooded Italians. At Survivor Series, they both were a part of Team D-Generation X, which gained the victory over Team Rated-RKO with a clean sweep. The brothers then received their first opportunity since Hardy's return to win a tag team championship at Armageddon. They competed in a four-team ladder match for the WWE Tag Team Championship, but they came up short in their attempt. In the course of the match, however, they inadvertently legitimately injured Joey Mercury's face. With Hardy still feuding with Johnny Nitro and the other members of MNM into 2007, he was challenged once again by Nitro at New Year's Revolution in a steel cage match for the Intercontinental Championship. Hardy once again defeated Nitro. Hardy then teamed with Matt to defeat MNM at both the Royal Rumble and No Way Out pay-per-views. The next night on Raw, February 19, Hardy was defeated for the Intercontinental Championship by Umaga. In April 2007, Hardy competed in the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania 23. During the match, Matt threw Edge onto a ladder and encouraged Hardy, who was close to the winning briefcase, to finish him off. Hardy then leaped off the 20-foot-high (6.1 m) ladder, drove Edge through the ladder with a leg drop, seemingly injuring both Edge and himself. The two were unable to continue the match and were removed from ringside on stretchers.\n\nThe next night on Raw, April 2, the Hardys competed in a 10-team battle royal for the World Tag Team Championship. They won the titles after eliminating Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch. They then began a feud with Cade and Murdoch, with the Hardys retaining the Championship in their first title defense against them at Backlash and again at Judgment Day. The Hardys, however, dropped the titles to Cade and Murdoch on June 4 on Raw. The Hardys earned a rematch at Vengeance 2007 but were defeated.\n\nMain event status (2007–2009)[]\n\nIn the midst of feuding with Umaga, who defeated Hardy at The Great American Bash to retain the Intercontinental Championship in late July, Hardy was abruptly taken off WWE programming. He posted on his own website and in the forums of TheHardyShow.com that it was time off to heal, stemming from a bad fall taken in a match against Mr. Kennedy on the July 23 episode of Raw. He made his return on the August 27 episode of Raw beating Kennedy by disqualification after Umaga interfered. The following week, on September 3, Hardy successfully captured his fourth Intercontinental Championship by defeating Umaga for the title.\n\nThis was the start of a push for Hardy, and at Survivor Series, Hardy and Triple H were the last two standing to win the traditional elimination match. Hardy began an on and off tag team with Triple H, which eventually led to a respectful feud between the two. The scripted rivalry continued at Armageddon, when Hardy defeated Triple H to become the number one contender for the WWE Championship. In the weeks leading up to the Royal Rumble, Hardy and Randy Orton engaged in a personal feud, which began when Orton kicked Hardy's brother, Matt, to the head (called a Punt) in the storyline. Hardy, in retaliation, performed a Swanton Bomb on Orton from the top of the Raw set and seemed to have all the momentum after coming out on top in their encounters. Hardy, however, lost the title match at the Royal Rumble, but was named as one of six men to compete in an Elimination Chamber Match at No Way Out, where he survived to the final two before being eliminated by the eventual winner, Triple H.\n\nDuring the March 3 episode of Raw, Hardy appeared on Chris Jericho's \"Highlight Reel\" segment as a special guest, but ended up attacking Jericho. This led to an Intercontinental title match on the following Raw where Hardy dropped the title to Jericho. Off-screen, Hardy dropped the title after he was suspended for sixty days, as of March 11, for his second violation of the company's Substance Abuse and Drug Testing Policy. Hardy was also removed from the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania XXIV after the suspension was announced. Hardy returned on the May 12 episode of Raw, defeating Umaga. This reignited the rivalry between the two, and they met in a Falls Count Anywhere match at One Night Stand, which Hardy won.\n\nOn June 23, 2008, Hardy was drafted from the Raw brand to the SmackDown brand, as a part of the 2008 WWE Draft. Hardy made his SmackDown debut on the July 4 episode, defeating John Morrison. Hardy participated in the WWE Championship Scramble Match at Unforgiven and also challenged for the Championship at No Mercy and Cyber Sunday, but failed to win each time. He was originally scheduled to be in the WWE Championship match at Survivor Series, but, in storyline, was found unconscious in his hotel, allowing the returning Edge to replace him in the match and win the title. At Armageddon in December 2008, Hardy defeated the defending champion Edge and Triple H in a triple threat match to capture the WWE Championship, his first world heavyweight championship.\n\nIn January 2009, Hardy's next storyline led to his involvement in scripted accidents, including a hit-and-run automobile accident and an accident involving his ring entrance pyrotechnics. At the 2009 Royal Rumble, Hardy lost his WWE Championship to Edge after Hardy's brother, Matt, interfered on Edge's behalf and hit Hardy with a steel chair. The buildup to this feud involved Matt implying that he was responsible for all of Hardy's accidents over the past few months, and at WrestleMania XXV, Hardy was defeated by Matt in an Extreme Rules Match. In a rematch at Backlash, however, Hardy defeated Matt in an \"I Quit\" match.\n\nAt Extreme Rules, Hardy defeated Edge to win the World Heavyweight Championship in a ladder match. Immediately after the match, however, CM Punk cashed in his Money in the Bank briefcase, which gave him a guaranteed world championship match at any time he wanted, and defeated Hardy to win the championship. Hardy received his rematch at The Bash, and won the match via disqualification, with Punk still retaining the title. At Night of Champions, however, Hardy won the championship for the second time, by defeating Punk. At the SummerSlam pay-per-view in August, Hardy lost the title back to Punk in a Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match. On the August 28 episode of SmackDown, Punk defeated Hardy in a steel cage rematch for the World Heavyweight Championship, resulting in Hardy being forced to leave WWE, in storyline, per the pre-match stipulation. This storyline was put in place to allow Hardy to leave WWE to heal his injuries, including a neck injury. Hardy also had two herniated discs in his lower back and was suffering from restless legs syndrome.\n\nReturn to TNA Wrestling and Heel Turn (2010-2011)[]\n\nOn TNA's first live Monday edition of Impact! on January 4, 2010, Hardy made his return to TNA, along with Shannon Moore. He was attacked by Homicide after emerging from the crowd, but hit Homicide with a steel chair and performed the Twist of Fate on the Impact! Zone ramp. The following day, it was reported that Hardy had signed a new contract with TNA. Hardy would make his next appearance for the company on the March 8 episode of Impact!, saving D'Angelo Dinero, Abyss and Hulk Hogan from A.J. Styles, Ric Flair and Desmond Wolfe. The following week Hardy defeated the TNA World Heavyweight Champion A.J. Styles in a non-title match. On the April 5 episode of Impact! Hardy was introduced as a member of Team Hogan for the annual Lethal Lockdown match, where they would face Team Flair. At Lockdown Team Hogan (Hardy, Abyss, Jeff Jarrett and Rob Van Dam) defeated Team Flair (Sting, Desmond Wolfe, Robert Roode and James Storm). At Sacrifice Hardy defeated Mr. Anderson. After the event, Anderson turned face and eventually managed to convince the skeptical Hardy that he really had changed, after which the two went on to form a tag team. At Slammiversary VIII Hardy and Anderson, now known as Enigmatic Assholes, defeated Beer Money, Inc. (Robert Roode and James Storm) in a tag team match.\n\nOn the August 19 episode of Impact! the TNA World Heavyweight Championship was vacated and Hardy was entered into an eight-man tournament for the championship, defeating Rob Terry in his first round match. At the semifinals at No Surrender Hardy first wrestled Kurt Angle to a twenty-minute time-limit draw, after which Eric Bischoff ordered a five-minute period of extra time. After that and a second five-minute extra time period also ended in draws, it was ruled that Angle was unable to continue and the match ended in a no contest. After wrestling a draw on the September 16 episode of Impact!, it was announced that both Hardy and Angle would advance to the finals at Bound for Glory, where they would compete with Mr. Anderson in a three-way match.\n\nAt Bound for Glory, Hardy turned heel with Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff and with their help defeated Angle and Anderson to win the TNA World Heavyweight Championship for the first time. They were then joined by Jeff Jarrett and Abyss, revealing the group that Abyss had been referring to as \"they\" for several months. On the following edition of Impact! the stable was named Immortal, as it formed an alliance with Ric Flair's Fortune. Meanwhile, Hardy debuted a new dark character, using biblical words as he explained the reasons behind his turn.\n\nAt Turning Point Hardy retained his title in a defense against Matt Morgan, a replacement for Mr. Anderson, who was sidelined after suffering a concussion during an attack by Hardy.\n\nOn the following edition of Impact! Hogan presented Hardy with a new design of the TNA World Heavyweight Championship, which he dubbed the TNA Immortal Championship. Hardy successfully defended the title at Final Resolution in a rematch against Matt Morgan after taking out the special guest referee Mr. Anderson and having a replacement referee count the pinfall.\n\nOn January 4, 2011, Hardy made his debut for New Japan Pro Wrestling (NJPW) at Wrestle Kingdom V, where he successfully defended the TNA World Heavyweight Championship against Tetsuya Naito.\n\nOn January 9 at Genesis, Matt Hardy made his TNA debut as a surprise member of Immortal and defeated Rob Van Dam to prevent him from getting a shot at Jeff's World Heavyweight Championship. Later in the event Hardy attempted to capitalize on the fact that Mr. Anderson and Matt Morgan had just competed in a number one contender's match by giving the winner, Anderson, the title match immediately following his win. However, after interference from Matt Morgan,Mick Foley, Matt Hardy, Rob Van Dam and Eric Bischoff, Anderson ended up defeating Hardy for the World Heavyweight Championship.\n\nDespite the major set-back, Jeff was given a second chance at Against All Odds 2011, and beat Mr. Anderson to regain his prestigious title. Hardy held the title for less than two weeks, defending it once against Rob Van Dam, before losing it to Sting on February 24, at the tapings of the March 3 edition of iMPACT. At Victory Road 2011, Hardy received a rematch for the title, under No DQ rules, but was defeated in ninety seconds. TNA had made the decision to cut the match short after deeming that Hardy was in no condition to wrestle. The following day it was reported that TNA had sent Hardy home from the weeks of the iMPACT tapings. On the March 17 episode of iMPACT, Immortal severed their ties with Hardy.\n\nReturn (2011–2013)[]\n\nOn August 23, 2011, TNA announced that Hardy would be making his return to the promotion at the Impact Wrestling tapings on August 25 in Huntsville, Alabama. The return would take place only five days after Matt Hardy was released from his TNA contract. In his return, which was taped for the September 8 edition of Impact Wrestling, Hardy spoke to the audience as a face, acknowledging that he had hit rock bottom at Victory Road in March, before asking the fans for \"one more shot\". Hardy wrestled his first match in six months on September 15 at a live event in York, Pennsylvania, defeating Jeff Jarrett. Hardy was inserted into the Bound for Glory Series, which he eventually won, defeating Bully Ray at No Surrender. At Bound for Glory, Hardy defeated Austin Aries to win his third TNA World Heavyweight Champion. He also became the first man to hold all three designs of the Championship. Hardy made his first defense on the Oct. 25th episode of Impact Wrestling defeating Kurt Angle to retain his title. At Turning Point, Hardy defeated Aries in a ladder match to retain the championship.\n\nHardy entered a feud with Roode again after Roode paid Aces & Eights to attack Hardy. Hardy defeated Roode at Final Resolution to retain the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. After the match, both men were attacked by Aces & Eights. Aries had outpaid Roode to interfere in their match. Hardy challenged Aries to title match after that. The following week, Hardy would be successful against Aries after Roode interfered this time. The rivalry led to a triple threat elimination match for the championship at Genesis on January 13, 2013, which Hardy would win and retain his championship. On the January 24 episode of Impact Wrestling, Hardy successfully defended the TNA World heavyweight Championship against Christopher Daniels. Afterwards, Hardy was jumped by a member of Aces & Eights who then injured Hardy's left leg with a ball-peen hammer. Hardy returned on the February 28 episode of Impact Wrestling, teaming up with his new number one contender Bully Ray to defeat Bad Influence (Christopher Daniels and Kazarian). On March 10 at Lockdown, Hardy lost the World heavyweight Championship to Ray in a steel cage match, following interference from Aces & Eights, ending his reign at 147 days. On the March 21 episode of Impact Wrestling, Hardy defeated Kurt Angle, Magnus & Samoa Joe in a four-way match to become number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship. Hardy received his title opportunity on the April 11 episode of Impact Wrestling, but was again defeated by Bully Ray in a Full Metal Mayhem match.\n\nHardy returned to TNA on June 2 at Slammiversary XI, teaming with Magnus and Samoa Joe in a winning effort against Aces & Eights (Garret Bischoff, Mr. Anderson and Wes Brisco). As a result of previously winning the Bound for Glory Series, Hardy and Roode were entered into the 2013 Bound for Glory Series on the June 13 episode of Impact. The following week, Hardy defeated Roode in his first BFG series match via pinfall to earn seven points in the tournament. Hardy's participation in the Bound for Glory series was ended when he lost a twenty-point battle royal to Kazarian. On the September 19 episode of Impact Wrestling, Hardy defeated X Division Champion Manik in a non-title match. On the October 3 episode of Impact Wrestling, Hardy teamed with Manik defeating Kenny King and Chris Sabin which led to the announcement of the Ultimate X match for the X Division Championship at Bound for Glory. On October 20 at Bound for Glory, Hardy debuted a new theme song and competed in his first Ultimate X match for the TNA X Division Championship but was unsuccessful as Chris Sabin won the match after an interference by Velvet Sky. On November 7, did battle with Sabin to determine who would qualify to the quarter-finals of the TNA World Title tournament in a Full Metal Mayhem match. Hardy defeated Sabin after leaping over the top of the ladder. Hardy made it to the finals of the World Title Tournament and was close to winning his fourth TNA World Heavyweight Championship, but was defeated by Magnus due to the interference of Rockstar Spud. The following week on Impact, Jeff Hardy teamed up with Sting to face The BroMans, Ethan Carter III and Rockstar Spud. Hardy made a leave of absence due to dispute with management.\n\nWillow (2013–2014)[]\n\nOn the February 13 episode of Impact Wrestling, a vignette aired showing Hardy was making his return as Willow in TNA. He made his TNA return on March 9 at Lockdown, in the Lethal Lockdown match as part of Team MVP. He then appeared on the following episode of IMPACT Wrestling, facing Rockstar Spud. In the following weeks, he would then continue to feud with Spud and Ethan Carter III, leading to a tag team match between them (with Kurt Angle as Willow's partner) at Sacrifice on April 27. Willow and Angle would go on to win that match. On May 1, Willow defeated James Storm by Disqualification when Storm shoved the referee and as Storm made his way up the ramp, Mr. Anderson appeared and hit Storm with the Mic Check. On May 8, Willow's match against Magnus ended in a DQ when Bram interfered and handcuffed Willow to the bottom rope and started to hit him with a metal turnbuckle. On May 15, Willow defeated both Magnus and Bram in a two on One handicap match. On the May 22 edition of Impact, Willow defeated Magnus in a Falls Count Anywhere match. On the June 5th edition of Impact, Willow won his match against Bram by DQ when Magnus came to the ring and attacked him with a Steel Pry Bar.\n\nReturn as Jeff Hardy (2014–2017)[]\n\nOn the July 10th edition of Impact Wrestling, Kurt Angle asked Willow to bring Jeff Hardy back for a 20 Man over the top rope battle royal later that night. Jeff competed in the match as himself and won, retiring Willow in the process as well as earning a match with Lashley for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship the following week, which Hardy lost. On the July 24 Impact Wrestling, Hardy told the audience that we had not seen the last of Willow and then brought out his brother Matt Hardy to reform The Hardys. The Wolves joined them in the ring and challenged them to a match for the TNA World Tag Team Championships at the Destination X edition of Impact Wrestling, which the Hardys agreed to. At Destination X, the Hardys lost against the Wolves, but shook hands after the match.
