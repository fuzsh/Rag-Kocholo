        "text": "March 10, 2020\n\nI feel kind of bad giving this 2 stars because I'm so far outside the age range for this one but I do think the best kids books can be enjoyed by anyone. This book was just so boring to me. When I was a kid, I wanted to read more Hardy Boys books because I thought they were more interesting compared to Nancy Drew. Reading it now, I find Frank and Joe to be so boring. They had no personality outside of being people who solve mysteries and none of their friends are really that interesting either.\n\nThe plot was all over the place in this book. Frank and Joe would be sent all over the place for seemingly exciting reasons and then it would end up being completely irrelevant to the mystery. this whole book is just full of wild goose chases that were so repetitive. I wish this plot was just a little more streamline, I think the book would have been so much better that way.\n\nthis was an interesting return to a book series that I loved as a child and I am glad I read this to see what sort of things I read as a kid but I doubt I'll be reading any more books in this series. Maybe I'll re-read a Nancy Drew book next.\n\nOctober 3, 2017\n\nIt's getting late, and I have a lot to do, so, I'll be brief: This is standard fare for this series...which isn't a bad thing.\n\nNovember 14, 2018\n\nThis book is great for people that like mysteries.\n\nFebruary 12, 2018\n\nThe Viking Symbol Mystery by Franklin W. Dixon\n\nThis book is all about two brothers, Frank and Joe Hardy, who investigate a case with their detective father, Fenton Hardy, and are accompanied by their pal, Chet Morton.\n\nThere are quite a few interesting and unique things about this book, such as the storyline , which makes you fascinated with the book and makes you feel as if you are there following their investigation, which I find very rare in most modern books. Another thing is how the characters interact very realistically with each other, as well how the conflict between the villans and the protagonists is very even until the end , unlike as what we see in most other stories where the protagonist always has the upper hand on the villan.\n\nThis story is about two brothers and their buddy Chet who go deep into the Northwest Territories sometime during the 1970s to retrieve a valuable viking artifact with runic symbols on it before the robbers, who stole it from a French-Canadian trapper Caribou Carton, and decipher it. The road to victory is hard for the Hardy boys as they trek through the vast wilderness and at the end are put in peril by a stampede of buffalo.\n\nThe main characters of this story are Caribou Caron, the two Hardy brothers, their father, their pal Chet Morton who are always ready to assist each other in a time of need, as we can see in scenes where they save each other when they get captured by the bandits. One very important thing that we see in the story is the characters’ ability to work together and develop strong friendships with the good people that they meet on their path.\n\nMy favorite part of this story is the end, because that is the moment when there is finally the feeling of accomplishment after the hard road to victory, and everyone is happy. It is written in a way that, first you feel as if you were there with them, as well as that it keeps the reader very interested in what will happen next, so you just cannot get bored of the book. A lot of other children would love to read this book because it has alot of adventure as well as action that keeps the reader on an edge.\n\nThis story is very entertaining, since there is always action through the entire book, as well as very amusing in some parts such as at the end, when Joe makes a joke during the dinner about Chet. I really enjoyed reading this book, and not only this specific book but all other books that I have read from the series also left me fascinated. I would definitely recommend it for children to read because of how adventurous it is.\n\nSeptember 18, 2018\n\nThis is one of my favorite Hardy Boys books, because it's setting is in northern Canada. While I've not been that far north in Canada, my favorite book from childhood was set up there, so this \"revisit\" of the area (many years later) was very pleasant. This mystery is, as all HB mysteries, a little far-fetched and unrealistic ... making it a perfect fantasy world mystery. The Hardy Boys are such good friends, polite and respectful young men, hard workers, diligent seekers, and good mystery solvers ... and while it may be a bit unrealistic, they are certainly good role models. I always enjoy going back to their world in books.\n\nMay 21, 2022\n\nThis was an incredibly weak Hardy Boys. There were so many facts that made me cringe. While learning how to fly a kind of plane, Frank is left alone instead of having an experienced co-pilot, resulting in a crash. They describe black flys as stinging people (they bite), and wolves as having almost glowing red eyes (completely wrong). They also said they had a canoe with an engine, which would make it no longer a canoe. I also found the story rather boring.\n\nThese weren't horrible, they were just irritating, and took away from the story. I enjoyed the early books much more.\n\nJanuary 3, 2024\n\nLots of history in this one, which always peaks my interest! Great descriptions of the Canadian Northwest as Joe and Frank and their friends work on parallel investigations. Great fun!\n\nDecember 21, 2014\n\nWow, you know who had terrible parents? The Hardy Boys! Who sends their children and their children's friends into the deadly Canadian wilderness after receiving death threats about meddling into the affairs of thieves? Oh, you guessed it, the Hardy parents! I guess you could say the parents of their friends are even worse for letting their children hang out with the Hardies in the first place, and I would agree. While the kids are off fighting their father's fight, almost getting killed several times over, dad Hardy is home getting all comfy with mom Hardy and this live in \"auntie\". The Hardy family is way messed up.\n\nCan't wait to read more!\n\nMay 1, 2020\n\nWhen an ancient viking relic goes missing, Frank and Joe are called in by their father to get the boys together and catch the theives, taking them into the Canadian wilderness where the most dangerous escapes have them chasing bad guys and running from some ferocious beasts! Dixon delivers a fun and thrilling adventure that will keep fans begging for more. Can the Hardy Boys make it out of the wild in one piece, or will they end up as another piece of ancient history?\n\nApril 10, 2015\n\nOkay, I admit, at age 39 I'm a tad bit old to be reading Hardy Boys mysteries, but it was a gift from a friend as a part of a care package she sent me while I was stationed in Japan, so what the heck, 'twas a quick and fun read. :-)\n\nMay 12, 2017\n\nThe book that I read was called The Hardy Boys: The Mystery of the Viking Stone. The author is Franklin W. Dixon who also illustrated the book. It really affected me by it had many cliff hangers at the end of the chapter so it wants you to read more everytime you are done with the chapter. Also it made me want to know what happen next so I just really badly wanted to go to the end of the book and find out what happens.\n\nThe author really made this book interesting it is always a good book/mystery I really thought that the author was doing some foreshadowing like it goes to another side of the story like it would be about to talk who was the crime made by but then it would talk about what Frank and Joe Hardy’s father does in his mystery. It also does some good flash back like it would talk about the Hardy’s Mysteries and then it would either talk about the last mystery or the mystery coming ahead in the book series. Just like in this book it mentioned that how the book got stolen about the viking stone but then it would relate to the last book when it did that.\n\nI would recommend this to anyone who is up for a mystery that is very tough to figure out like you would never suspect that it was that person. I guess I kinda liked this book it wasn’t the best one of this series of the Hardy Boys but I would still recommend it to most people that like a good mystery that they are not suspecting. At the end I was like duh like how didn’t I think that it was that person who made the crime. I guess it was kinda not too easy and not too hard it was a good book for me at least, it is not a predictable outcome at the end of the story. The favorite part for me was the end of it when I found out who did the crime. I could totally relate to about the end how you think to hard about who the criminal is going to be and in my life I always think to hard about things when they are basically right in front of me\n\nNovember 2, 2020\n\n(Warning! Spoliers!!!) The book The Viking Symbol Mystery is a book written by Franklin W. Dixon. This is my first time reading one of his books so I don’t know much about the author of this book but the characters are Joe, Frank and Fenton Hardy (Mr. Hardy) along with Chet and Sam Radley. The book starts by an antenna that falls and they find someone hurt in the name Kelly and they suspect him to have done it. Once they visit him in the hospital to question him and he is gone. They follow him and get stopped by a train. They meet someone named Caribou and he is a french-Canadian trapper who decides to help them. They found the rune stone but it turned out to be a fake! They find the thieves hideout and find the stone there! They arrest the thieves and the book ends.\n\nI liked this author because at the beginning of the book he explained each character and how they look, their personality, and things you might want to know about that character. The chapters were short and on average 8-12 pages a chapter. There was a picture every once in a while like once every 3-4 chapters which to me did not make much sense. I was surprised that none of the characters got hurt even a little because they were doing dangerous things that you could easily get hurt. Overall I think the author did a great job on this book.\n\nI would recommend this book to people who like mysteries and not too much action because it has some action in the book but not much at the start. Mainly because we are getting introduced to the characters and we aren’t getting to the mystery yet.\n\nMarch 29, 2024\n\nThere were a few interesting, and few not-so interesting components!\n\n1. This is the first time that Mr. Hardy and the Hardy brothers have not later converged, but worked on the same case from the beginning. That being said, and given that Mr. Hardy is a veteran detective, he didn't seem to be doing much sleuthing or cracking the case! He just seemed to be gathering information without even processing it.\n\n2. Separating Biff Hooper and Tony Prito into a separate team made them unimportant to the main mystery, which revolved around the Hardy brothers! They simply appeared from time to time and simply seemed to be drifting from one location to another, back and forth, without a significant contribution, apart from accompanying Radley.\n\n3. Kelly, though a villain, was an extremely interesting character, mainly because of his versatility. He began with an injured victim, then a homeless man, and finally the mastermind of a criminal organization. In the end, it is revealed that he was actually a reputed lawyer who fell in the bad way!\n\n4. Caribou was very unimpressive. He seemed like a huge lumbering giant who could have been a great guide, instead his character was diluted to a point, where it appeared that he didn't do much!\n\nJuly 28, 2023\n\nOne of the more interesting stories from the mid-numbered mysteries, this case sees the Hardy brothers, plus Biff, Chet, Tony, Sam, and Mr. Hardy head north into Canada to solve two seemingly different cases. To no one's surprise, the two cases are related, and soon they're after a mysterious Viking artifact in the Northwest Territories.\n\nStories that involve the whole gang are always fun, and this one is no exception. There's plenty of small action and everything is largely predictable, so typical Hardy Boys fun. Oddly, quite a bit of detail is given on Sam teaching the boys how to fly and land a seaplane. I'm not sure why the extra attention was given, but it made for some interesting reading halfway through.\n\nAll told, not bad for one of the 'newer' books. (I realize it's not a new book, but compared to the original stories, which were published pre-WWII, this one reads like the revised editions, after the stories were shortened and the language simplified. Probably won't keep it, but it was a decent read.)\n\nJune 8, 2023\n\nA decent tale of the world's most famous detective brothers. I say decent because the link between the two mysteries was not just clear from the beginning, but felt rather forced as well. It's too bad, because all of the other elements were present for a rousing good mystery.\n\nChet, Tony, and Biff were there to help out and the supporting crew was rounded out by Caribou Caron. Caribou is one of the more outrageous characters to show up in a Hardy Boys tale, but he's not there only for laughs. There is a connection between him and one of the bad guys that becomes important in the second half of the story. It's Caribou and Chet that save Frank and Joe's bacon at one point, keeping the story going. I say story here, because it quickly becomes a treasure hunt rather than an actual mystery.\n\nEven so, this is a definite read for fans of the Hardys and older YA literature. A good bedtime story read for younger kids also.\n\nFind it. Buy it. Read it!\n\nDecember 10, 2019\n\nGreat classic Hardy Boys adventure. The boys seek out a missing Viking Rune stone way up in the Canadian woods after it is stolen from a client. The boys work closely with Mr. Hardy throughout the story, which is believable, interesting, adventuresome and has aged well. This is a story that is still a good one even in modern times. The only annoying part of the story is the Canadian trapper who the boys encounter who had discovered the rune stone. While the character is a solid one, the repeated use a of a French expression and poor quality English gets a bit trying. My hardcover copy is at least 35 years old and is in excellent condition. The classic cover artwork of the Hardys looking at the rune stone while capturing a gang member fireside at a lake in the woods is one of the best Hardy Boys covers. This is a good classic story any fan of the Hardys will enjoy.\n\nSeptember 1, 2021\n\nA rare artifact thought to be left by Vikings in Canada's Northwest Territories is stolen. The Hardy boys go after the thieves along with their father, friends and Caribou, a trapper who found the rune stone. The strange markings on the stone are thought to lead to a treasure. There's a lot of flying back and forth as the detectives try to solve the mystery. They must learn how to fly a float plane because the area is so remote getting there by landing on water is the best way to travel. This time they have such a large group involved with Sam, Fenton, Tony, Biff, Chet, Caribou, as well as Frank and Joe they can split up and cover two places at once but it still takes time to find the thieves and the rune stone. Then they have to decipher it to find the treasure.\n\nJune 6, 2023\n\nI think that being an adult reading through the series means that you get caught up asking too many questions. Such as, who in their right mind would let their 18 year old fly a float plane the day after they crashed it?\n\nThe Hardy Boys avoid a couple of near death moments, but manage to solve the case. Don't they always?\n\nThe story is interesting, but weaves around a bit, so a child may or may not stick with it.\n\nJuly 30, 2017\n\nKind of dull reading as an adult. Also, I think that the Hardy Boys, especially Frank, would have CTE as adults with the number of concussions that they take in this book, let alone their other adventures.\n\nJune 5, 2018\n\nAte these up as a kid and usually got them as gifts for birthdays, Christmas and other events. This edition would be quite dated now and I believe they have updated the books. The author was a pseudonym for a plethora of writers who contributed to this series.\n\nNovember 29, 2019\n\nThey're in northern Canada this time, and it turns out they can fly (planes), in addition to all the other skills they've mastered that I never imagined doing. I basically learned to read from these books, so it's interesting to come back to them fifty years later.\n\nJune 9, 2022\n\nA lot of running back and forth in this book, which made it less compelling than others. Also the fact that they can get licensed to land a float plane in 3 days and be masters at it is a little unbelievable.\n\nJanuary 14, 2018\n\nAt least the chapters are real short\n\nFebruary 16, 2018\n\nThis wasn't bad per se, but it just didn't really interest me. The settings weren't compelling and the mystery was only so-so.\n\nJuly 6, 2018\n\nAt 31 years old, this is the 1st Hardy Boys I ever have read. Great read! Quick, easy, clean, and fun read! Looking forward to picking up a few more.\n\nJanuary 5, 2021\n\nFranklin Dixon wrapped up the mystery very well! However it wasn't my most favorite book ever read.a"
