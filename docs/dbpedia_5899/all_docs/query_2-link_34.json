        "text": "\"ICARUS\" is a mural about Fast Fashion and responsible consumption (United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 12). Fast fashion refers to the mass production of cheap, stylish clothes driven by our consumerist society and exacerbated by the boom of social media. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the average consumer buys 60% more clothing than 15 years ago. Each item is only kept for half as long. The issue is that Fast Fashion creates significant environmental and labor issues and is responsible for 10% of global CO2 emissions each year, according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.\n\nThis mural, created by artist JDL and curated by Street Art for Mankind (SAM), is a signature piece from the artist. Inspired by the myth of Icarus, she represents here a proud \"fashionista\" dressed to impress with all her jewelry and clothes flying too close to the sun and falling from the sky. It is an original allegory of the danger of our excessive consumption and its inevitable consequences on our planet if we continue overlooking it. The model, Floortje Eimers, who posed for the artist, is a renowned ballerina from the Netherlands.\n\nThe piece is part of the third series of the Big Art. Bigger Change. murals produced in March 2024 in downtown Houston. It was made possible thanks to the generous support of the Houston Downtown Management District and Harris County Precinct One. Special thanks to the Holiday Inn Houston Downtown for donating its wall.\n\n“Aim for Change” is a mural about promoting a peaceful society and reducing all forms of violence, as highlighted in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 16.1. In the U.S., gun violence is a leading cause of premature death, as guns kill more than 38,000 people and cause nearly 85,000 injuries each year. There are divides in the country on how to fix the issue of gun violence, but all sides agree it is essential to reduce mass shootings that plague the nation, from supermarkets to schools. This mural is a tribute to changing the odds, to a world where we mute guns and foster peace.\n\nThis mural, created by artist Gonzo247 and curated by Street Art for Mankind (SAM), features a signature and colorful contemporary art graffiti piece of the artist. The viewers are invited to decipher the artist's message, written in vintage Wild Style letters of pop colors that say, \"Change is certain, Change is OK, Keep an Open Mind, Educate, Evolve, End Gun Violence.\" Amongst this \"assembly\" of contemporary letters, the artist has hidden knotted guns inspired by the sculpture from artist Carl Frederk Reutersward that was made after his friend, John Lennon, was murdered and that can be seen today at the United Nations in New York.\n\nThe piece is part of the third series of the Big Art. Bigger Change. murals produced in March 2024 in downtown Houston. It was made possible thanks to the drive and generous support of the Houston Downtown Management District and Harris County Precinct One. Special thanks to the Holiday Inn Houston Downtown for donating its wall.\n\n\"The Houston Collection\" is a mural about the butterfly effect, the world's interconnection, highlighting how small decisions can greatly impact people, society, and the planet. It also shows how \"a butterfly flapping its wings,\" or simply the right action at the right place, can make a huge difference. The mural addresses social and environmental issues such as habitat fragmentation and climate change. As such, this mural represents all 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals.\n\nThis mural, created by artist Mantra and curated by Street Art for Mankind (SAM), is a signature piece of the artist. It features eight emblematic butterflies from Texas and Houston showcased in a large entomologist box. These colorful, diverse butterflies are a tribute to the beauty of local nature and biodiversity and serve an educational purpose for the public as these local species are depicted with precision. Their representation in an entomologist box is also a vivid reminder of their fragility to climate change.\n\nThe piece is part of the third series of the Big Art. Bigger Change. murals produced in March 2024 in downtown Houston. It was made possible thanks to the drive and generous support of the Houston Downtown Management District and Harris County Precinct One. Special thanks to the Harris County Precinct One for donating its wall.\n\n\"Birds of No Nation\" is a mural about humanity on the move. According to the United Nations, an estimated 281 million people, approximately 3.6% of the world's population, currently live outside their country of origin, compared to 2.8% in 2000 and 2.3 % in 1980. Many migrations are characterized by varying degrees of compulsion as people escape conflict, persecution, large-scale human rights violations, or natural disasters. The artwork is a call to compassion and peace. It supports achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 10.7 and 16.\n\nThis mural, created by Afghan artist Shamsia Hassani and curated by Street Art for Mankind (SAM), stages the iconic character of the artist, a strong and independent woman with bold lines, sharp angles, and no visible mouth, sitting on the other side of a broken wall accompanied by birds. Like these birds, she is migrating and looking back with nostalgia. In the background, we can see a city landscape and a tank in the middle of the fields. She is running away from destruction and war. This mural is inspired by the artist's painting series \"Birds of No Nations\" about Afghans who migrate to other countries, don't have a nationality anymore, and are from nowhere.\n\nThe piece is part of the third series of the Big Art. Bigger Change. murals produced in March 2024 in downtown Houston. It was made possible thanks to the generous support of Harris County Precinct One. Special thanks to the Harris County Precinct One for donating its wall.\n\n\"Child-Friendly World\" is a mural inspired by the nomination of the city of Houston, which in 2024 became the first UNICEF Child-Friendly City in the United States, showcasing Houstonians' active commitment to protecting children's rights. It is an opportunity to reflect on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which serves as a framework for UNICEF's Child-Friendly Cities Initiative and aims to guarantee that children's best interests are always the primary consideration. The artwork supports achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 13 & 16.2.\n\nThis mural, created by artist Detour and curated by Street Art for Mankind (SAM), proposes a signature colorful piece featuring a daughter on her father's shoulders. The composition highlights the dad as the caregiver raising up his child and bringing her new perspectives in a secure environment. She is our future, looking at the horizon with hope as she can grow confidently in this child-friendly world.\n\nThe piece is part of the third series of the Big Art. Bigger Change. murals produced in March 2024 in downtown Houston. It was made possible thanks to the generous support of the Houston Downtown Management District, TotalEnergies, and Harris County Precinct One. Special thanks to the De George At Union Station for donating its wall.\n\n\"Soccer Adventurers\" is a mural inspired by soccer; the primary professional sport hosted at the Shell Energy Stadium. It is here to remind us of the key teachings and values of sports, such as Equality, Inclusion, and Respect. It is also a tribute to the opportunities unlocked by sports that help break lines, ascend socially, and dream big in Houston and everywhere. The artwork supports achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 3, 4, 5, 8,11, 16 and 17.\n\nThis mural, created by artist Dragon76 and curated by Street Art for Mankind (SAM), features the artist's unique \"Manga\" and futuristic style. Emerging from the smoke are athletes from different genders and ethnicities coming together in unity around soccer balls. They are dressed in futuristic fighting gear and look to the future with determination. They are smiling, having fun, and ready for their next challenge.\n\nThe piece is part of the third series of the Big Art. Bigger Change. murals produced in March 2024 in downtown Houston. It was made possible thanks to the generous support of the Houston Downtown Management District and Harris County Precinct One. Special thanks to the Shell Energy Stadium officials for donating their wall.\n\n\"City of All Energies\" is a mural celebrating Houston as an energetic city, inspired by the unstoppable energy of its welcoming community as much as the energy transition that Houston is leading. For over 100 years, Houston has been considered the energy capital of the world. With newer, cleaner energy initiatives on the rise, Houston is poised to continue with the title by accelerating global solutions for an energy-abundant, low-carbon future. The artwork supports achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 7 and 17.\n\nCreated by the collaboration of two artists, Mr.D 1987 and Romain Froquet, and curated by Street Art for Mankind (SAM), the mural is an abstract and colorful contemporary piece. It features large energetic brushstrokes and splashes of color, with a vertical progression of the color palette implying a switch from past to present, from warm fossil fuel to greener, renewable energies. In its center, the brushstrokes create an \"H,\" as a wink to \"H-Town,\" Houston's nickname. This giant allegory on energy transition is also the fruit of collaborative work between two artists from two different continents. It symbolizes the necessary international cooperation needed to achieve this energy transition goal.\n\nThe piece is part of the third series of the Big Art. Bigger Change. murals produced in March 2024 in downtown Houston. It was made possible thanks to the generous support of the Houston Downtown Management District, TotalEnergies, and Harris County Precinct One. Special thanks to Harris County Precinct One for donating its wall.\n\n\"Harmony\" is a mural that pays tribute to the youth change-makers who are now leading the conversation on climate change around the world and shaking up the status quo. Climate change impacts everyone, but it particularly affects young people. Their health, education, and security -- as well as their future -- are at risk of the triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution, according to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Empowering youth to be green change-makers is necessary to build a livable planet for all in the future. This mural is inspired by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 4 and 13.\n\nThis mural, created by artist Mr. Super A and curated by Street Art for Mankind (SAM), features the famous \"Little Red Riding Hood\" tale with a twist. In the signature style of the artist, hidden behind the stripes, is an activist girl and green change-maker. She is determined, facing a wolf symbolizing the adult world here. She is carrying an entire ecosystem (bird, bee, and butterfly), opposing the Narcisse flower held by the wolf, inviting him to follow her lead in creating a thriving environment for all. This mural is about changing the narrative for the future of our planet. The Little Red Riding Hood is not scared. She is the superhero of the story.\n\nThe piece is part of the third series of the Big Art. Bigger Change. murals produced in March 2024 in downtown Houston. It was made possible thanks to the generous support of Harris County Precinct One. Special thanks to the Harris County Precinct One for donating its wall.\n\n\"Books and Freedom\" is a mural about books and their key role in supporting a diversity of opinions, tolerance, and freedom of speech. Books are essential and have always been across cultures and times. They are how knowledge is preserved and shared and act as doorways to connecting us with the diversity of the world around us. Books are fundamental to keeping open dialogues and conversations in an increasingly polarized world. The theme is inspired by the transformation of the Harris County Public Libraries into \"Book Sanctuaries\" and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 4 and 16.10.\n\nThis mural, created by artist D*Face and curated by Street Art for Mankind (SAM), features the artist's iconic and signature comic book dysfunctional character surrounded by books that have been set on fire and by canceled e-books. Between fiction and reality, this sad woman questions us directly, proposing to reflect on the potential of the unknown and the importance of diverse points of view in books and daily life.\n\nThe piece is part of the third series of the Big Art. Bigger Change. murals produced in March 2024 in downtown Houston. It was made possible thanks to the generous support of the Houston Downtown Management District and Harris County Precinct One. Special thanks to Harris County for donating its wall.\n\n“Kids in the Park” highlights how sports can inspire youth and trigger opportunities. It is a tribute to inclusive communities where children, girls and boys, are given equal chances. It is connected to United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 4, 5, and 11.\n\nThis mural, created by Emmanuel Jarus and curated by Street Art for Mankind (SAM), features a boy and a girl at Finnigan Park in Fifth Ward, where the mural is located. They are united around sports. The girl is depicted holding a football and the boy a soccer ball to challenge the stereotypes of boys’ and girls’ sports. This mural aims to create a legacy between two major sports events hosted in Houston: the Super Bowl in 2004 that – through the NFL – funded construction of the Finnigan Youth Education Town, and the upcoming 2026 World Cup. It is about playing sports and dreaming big in a nurturing and inspiring environment.\n\nThe piece was made possible thanks to the drive and generous support of Harris County Precinct One, which donated its wall for the artwork.\n\n“The Return” is a replica of the eponym painting by John Biggers (1924-2001). Biggers was an African-American artist based in Houston and world-renowned for his social realist murals and symbolic paintings. This artwork, featured on the Harris County Juvenile Detention Center, is a bold visual statement that embodies the facility’s commitment to nurturing, guiding, and supporting young individuals on their path to rehabilitation and reintegration into society. It supports the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 16.\n\nThis mural, created by Alex Arzu and Emmanuel Jarus, and curated by Street Art for Mankind (SAM), features a woman as a central figure, standing firmly with hands placed on the children’s shoulders, serving as a representation of guidance and support. Her foot rests upon the back of a turtle, a creature often associated with longevity, endurance, and the slow and steady journey toward a goal. Here, it emphasizes the importance of patience and persistence in personal development and underscores the notion that meaningful change, led by mentors and educators within the facility, takes time.\n\nThe piece is part of the third series of the Big Art.
