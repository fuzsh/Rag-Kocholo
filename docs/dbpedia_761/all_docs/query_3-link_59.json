        "text": "Growing up in Texas, Mexican food and its regional cousin, Tex-Mex, are inescapable. When people come to visit me, one of the top requests is to go out to a Mexican restaurant. And why not? The Mexican culture is vibrant, energetic, and colorful. There’s no way to grow up in Texas without enjoying a cold margarita paired with tortilla chips, red and green salsa, and pico de gallo, at happy hour.\n\nFor the most south-of-the-border experience without leaving the state, I love visiting San Antonio. One of the oldest cities in Texas, it developed around a market square, much like cities in Mexico.\n\nMarket Square is a fun, colorful area, very close to Plaza de Armas in the heart of the city. During the weekends there is live music, dancing, and street vendors. It’s the best place in San Antonio in my opinion.\n\nAccording to historian Mary Ann Noonan Guerra, the original Market Square was located in the Plaza de Armas and dates back to a land grant from the King of Spain. It was also the first market square in San Antonio. In 1718, military headquarters were constructed on the Plaza de Armas, also known as the Presidio. In 1731, settlers created Plaza de las Islas. The Cathedral San Fernando separated the two plazas.\n\nIn her book, The History of San Antonio’s Market Square, she writes that “Don Juan de Acuna, the 37th Viceroy of New Spain, ordered that there were to be squares, parks, and plazas for the people … for their use and entertainment.’”\n\nAs you may guess, there are some great Mexican restaurants around Market Square. Two of my favorites are Mi Tierra and La Margarita, both owned by the Cortez family. Mi Tierra opened in 1941 and is known for the mariachi bands that play there in addition to Mexican food favorites. I dare you to listen to mariachi music and not tap your toes or shout out Arriba! La Margarita is known for delicious margaritas and for developing the first fajitas.\n\nAfter a visit to San Antonio, I wanted to recreate a Mexican-style happy hour for my friends. The Cortez family generously supplied me with mucho inspiration and recipes for some of their family’s traditional Mexican dishes. Now I will share them with you.\n\nMake Authentic Margaritas\n\nThis recipe for frozen margaritas is easy and delicious and can be made in a variety of fruit flavors. The secret ingredient is the fresh fruit puree. Mango is the most popular, but you can substitute any fruit you like.\n\nHow To Choose Tequila\n\nThe three main varieties of tequila are Blanco (unaged), Reposado (aged up to one year), and Añejo (aged for one to three years). Añejos are dark in color and are typically sipped neat, like a nice liquor or Scotch whisky.\n\nIf you’re uncertain which type of tequila to use for these frozen drinks, go with the Blanco, which is a very basic tequila. You only want top-shelf tequila if you plan to sip it straight or mix up some classic margaritas-on-the-rocks recipe.\n\nLa Margarita’s Frozen Mango Margarita Recipe\n\n4 ounces mango puree\n\n1-ounce tequila\n\n1-ounce triple sec\n\n1 cup ice\n\n1/2 ounce fresh lime juice\n\nDirections: Blend all ingredients until smooth. Pour into a chilled glass and enjoy!\n\nPro Tip: Make it San Antonio-style and add a salt and chili powder spiced rim, or drizzle the inside of the glass with Chambourd before adding the margarita puree.\n\nPIN IT And SAVE IT for Later\n\nOther popular Mexican Drinks\n\nIf you want to offer some delicious options along with margaritas, try this spiked agua fresca, it’s divine! Made with fresh watermelon, it is refreshing and perfect on a hot summer day.\n\nSpiked Sandi (Watermelon) Agua Fresca\n\n6 cups cold water\n\n4 cups watermelon, seeded and cut\n\n1/2 cup simple syrup (more or less to taste)\n\n1-ounce tequila\n\n1 ounce Deep Eddy Lime Vodka\n\nlime wedges for garnish\n\nDirections: Add diced watermelon, simple syrup, and 3 cups of cold water to a blender. Blend until smooth. Then, using a mesh strainer, strain juice into a vitrolero or pitcher. Add the remaining cold water, and sweeten with more simple syrup as needed. Pour 1 cup of agua fresca over ice, and add 1 ounce of tequila and 1 ounce of Deep Eddy Lime Vodka. Stir, and garnish with lime wedges.\n\nPopular Mexican food to pair with Happy Hour Drinks\n\nHappy-hour drinks should always be served with baskets of chips and bowls of salsa, or chips and guacamole. You can buy red and green corn chips, the colors of the Mexican flag, to make it look more festive. For something heartier and to better soak up those margaritas, La Margarita’s fajitas are perfect.\n\nCortez family fajita is born\n\nGeorge Cortez took a trip to Monterrey, Mexico, in 1981. While there, he dined at a restaurant called El Regio, where he ordered a plate of arrachera, or skirt steak. The skirt steak was very flavorful, but not very tender, and it was served with rice and beans. George thought it would be a good idea to marinate the skirt steak overnight (for flavor and tenderness), grill it to perfection, cut it into strips against the grain, and serve it sizzling on a hot griddle with grilled onions and peppers — creating what we now know as the fajita.\n\nHe brought this concept back to San Antonio and introduced it at La Margarita. Today, visitors can order beef, chicken, shrimp, and vegetable fajitas. Thank you George for bringing some authentic Mexican food to San Antonio.\n\nTo serve homemade fajitas, keep it simple…serve them on a big platter with a basket of flour tortillas, and let your guests build their own plates buffet-style.\n\nOther traditional Mexican cuisine includes dishes made with mole, chicken enchiladas, tacos, huevos rancheros, stuffed poblano peppers, and carne asada. Accompaniments include rice, corn tortillas, black beans, guacamole, queso dip and. sour cream, Of course, there’s more, this is just a bit of inspiration. Of course, there’s more, this is just a bit of inspiration.\n\nSouth of the Border Decor\n\nTo make your Mexican happy hour look truly south of the border, or at least give it some San Antonio style, add some table decor. Dress up your tabletop by adding a colorful tablecloth or table runner, or substitute a Mexican blanket. A vase of paper flowers or some small potted cacti would be inexpensive and add a pop of color. Don’t forget to include a small bowl of quartered limes to squeeze into a margarita, agua fresca, or anything else.\n\nMexican glassware with colored rims looks pretty and is very traditional. Colorful baskets can provide a quick and easy reminder of old Mexico. Add some merengue music, and your guests will soon be dancing.\n\nPro Tip: When you’re in San Antonio be sure to visit the stores located in Market Square to shop for glassware, pottery, and other Mexican-made items to enhance your table setting and make it even more special. Most of the vendors have been in Market Square for decades. It’s a great place for picking up gifts too.\n\nTravel To San Antonio For A Taste of the Real Thing\n\nIf you’re planning to visit San Antonio – and you should–I recommend that you stay near the historic San Antonio River Walk for the ambiance and convenience. You may like this article for ideas on things to do in San Antonio.\n\nI stayed at the Hotel Valencia, a 5-minute walk from Market Square and near everything else on the River Walk. This section of the River Walk is much quieter than you might expect, and you won’t often have to contend with pedestrian or street noise.\n\nBetter yet, the Hotel Valencia makes the River Walk accessible to people of all mobility levels. There’s an elevator near the reception desk that will take you not only to the River Walk level, but also to the street level.\n\nKnow Before You Go\n\nSan Antonio has an almost year-round tropical climate. It is hot — usually in the 90s in the summer — and very, very humid. If you’re not used to the weather it can quickly take a toll. Drink plenty of water. You can bring a water bottle, or simply plan to stop often at the many cafes along the River Walk. Wear sunscreen and a wide-brimmed hat. Long sleeves and fabrics with SPF built-in are also good choices. You will do a lot of walking, so comfortable shoes are a must.\n\nIt is said that every Texan has two homes: the place where they were born, and San Antonio. If a visit is not in the cards at the moment, invite some friends over for mango margaritas and enjoy a Mexican-style happy hour at home.\n\nCreate A Mexican Style Happy Hour Inspired by San Antonio was last modified: by"
