His sonnets posthumously made him famous, some of which celebrated Charles V as Caesar and were part of the Renaissance of Empire. He also translated a Burgundian chivalric romance from French to Spanish at the request of his emperor. In addition, Acuña served in a variety of military campaigns in the Mediterranean, and he became a knight of the Order of Alcántara."
