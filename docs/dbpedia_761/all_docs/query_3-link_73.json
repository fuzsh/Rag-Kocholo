        "text": "In nineteenth-century Spain, the process of forging a liberal national identity is inseparable from the creation of a national culture and literature. Although women writers and intellectuals were engaged in this enterprise, it is principally their male counterparts who have been acknowledged for their cultural contributions. Symptomatic of such exclusion is the figure of Rosario de Acuña (Madrid 1851-Gijón 1923), playwright, poet, essayist and freethinker. Although Acuña was almost an exact contemporary of the canonically inscribed Emilia Pardo Bazán, her considerable literary œuvre has not yet received the recognition it deserves, on account of the controversy provoked by both the writer and her works. In contrast with Pardo Bazán's Catholicism and alignment with a bourgeois class and reading public, Acuña was fiercely anticlerical and embraced workers' causes. Not only did she work in a literary genre considered off-limits to women (the theater, where she addressed contentious political issues of the day), she was also prominent in freemasonry and an active advocate of women's rights and education. Indeed, her outspokenness on the latter led to her going into exile in Portugal from 1911 to 1914, on account of the political scandal that erupted from the publication of a letter of hers to Luis Bonafoux in El Internacional in Paris and El Progreso in Barcelona.1 [End Page 294]\n\nThere exist few literary studies on Acuña's works.2 In spite of being hailed as \"la pionera de la literatura femenina del librepensamiento español\" (Simón Palmer 7), Acuña has tended to receive most attention from historians interested in the association of nineteenth-century Spanish liberalism with freethinking and freemasonry.3 Yet, closer examination of her literary production reveals a writer deeply immersed in contemporary currents of thought. In particular, Acuña's dramatic corpus participates in fashioning a specific construct of the nation in late nineteenth-century Spain, in accordance with that strand of liberalism known as \"progressive.\" In contrast to the more conservative liberalism propounded by the \"moderates,\" who sought a limited bourgeois revolution in the interests of an elite, the \"progressive\" national ideal was founded on industry and commerce, the advancement of the working classes and a secular society.4\n\nDuring the nineteenth century national histories in Spain aimed to project an image of a united, permanent community, defended by its founding fathers, heroes and martyrs (Álvarez Junco 196). Important to this notion of permanence was the demonstration of the continuity of an essential national character across the centuries. In Acuña's theater this model can be perceived in her protagonists, who are all defenders of causes of the people, while continuity is visible in the range of periods in which the plays are set: from fourteenth-century Rome and sixteenth-century Valencia and Játiva, in Rienzi el Tribuno and Tribunales de venganza respectively, to early- and late-nineteenth-century Spain, in Amor a la Patria, El Padre Juan and La voz de la Patria. This article proposes to focus on the second and third of Acuña's five plays, Amor a la Patria (1877) and Tribunales de venganza (1878), which, unlike the better-known Rienzi el Tribuno (1876) and El Padre Juan (1891),5 have not been republished. However, they deal with two of the founding myths of liberal Spanish nationalism: the so-called War of Independence fought against the French in 1808 and the uprising of the Valencian Germanía or Brotherhood in 1519.
