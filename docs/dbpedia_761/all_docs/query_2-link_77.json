        "text": "Daniel Eisenberg\n\nBy Way of a Prologue. Don Quijote\n\nIt can be said without fear of exaggeration that interest in and study of the romances of chivalry1 has been an incidental by product of the study of the Quijote. Diego Clemencín has been until recently the person who knew best the romances of chivalry (see infra); his knowledge is found in the notes of his edition of the Quijote, and his Biblioteca de libros de caballerías was conceived of as a supplement to his edition. Collectors of romances of chivalry, such as the Marqués de Salamanca2 , bought them because they were books which Don Quijote had owned, and Juan Sedó chose as the topic for his inaugural speech in the Real Academia de Buenas Letras de Barcelona a Contribución a la historia del coleccionismo cervantino y caballeresco (Barcelona, 1948), as the two topics were so closely related that it was logical to discuss them at the same time. When libraries place the romances of chivalry on display, they do so in expositions devoted principally to Cervantes3 . The romances which have received far and away the greatest amount of study, Amadís de Gaula, Tirant lo Blanch, and Palmerín de Inglaterra, are the ones which are praised in the escrutinio de la librería4 . The authors who are seldom studied, and the most glaring abuse in this area is the treatment (or lack of it) of Feliciano de Silva, are neglected because of the censure of their works which we find in the Quijote.\n\nThis phenomenon has, of course, an obvious explanation. The Quijote is a work which all scholars of Spanish literature have read, and which much of the general public is familiar with in its broad outlines. The Quijote, besides its position as the most acceptable source of comment on the romances of chivalry, is the contemporary work in which the romances are discussed at greatest length. A considerable number of them are either named in the Quijote, or explicitly referred to; in many cases they are summarized with pithy comments, such as the priest's observation that Belianís «[tiene] necesidad de un poco de ruibarbo para purgar la demasiada cólera suya». The books are also commented on as a body. They are «aborrecidos de tantos y alabados de muchos más»; they constitute a «máquina mal fundada» (I, Prologue). They are «disparatados», and «atienden solamente a deleitar, y no a enseñar» (I, 47); none of them has «un cuerpo de fábula entero» (I, 47); nevertheless, the innkeeper «querría estar oyéndolos noches y días» (I, 32). In effect, since the romances of chivalry are a primary theme of the Quijote, they are commented on repeatedly, by many different characters and from many contrasting points of view.\n\nHaving said this, it must be pointed out that despite its popularity5 , the Quijote is a paradoxical work, one of the most controversial ones in Spanish literature. How few things all cervantistas agree on! And many of the unanswered questions of the Quijote relate directly to the romances of chivalry. Did Cervantes admire the romances of chivalry because they «ofrecían [sujeto] para que un buen entendimiento pudiera mostrarse en ellos?» When the Toledo canon said that he had written a hundred pages of a romance of chivalry, never to be finished, was he speaking for Cervantes6 ? Was Cervantes' intent to end the popularity of the romances of chivalry, as is said many times in the work, a declaration which Avellaneda took as literal? Or was this only a pose or pretext, since the books were already dead? If he disliked the romances, how did he know them so well? In short, did he admire the romances, or find them ridiculous? Or was his true attitude some unknown compromise between these two positions?\n\nWhat I mean to suggest, then, is that to take the comments in the Quijote as the basis for our knowledge of the romances of chivalry is to build our critical house on a foundation of sand. Too little is known with certainty about the relationship of the Quijote to the romances of chivalry for the often confusing or ambiguous information Cervantes offers there to be taken as reliable critical material. The romances of chivalry are, in fact, much less enigmatic works than the Quijote; we can read them, analyze them, and criticize them without danger of falling into the traps that await the scholar who ventures unprepared into the Manchegan countryside. What can, in fact, be done is to utilize the romances of chivalry as a tool to aid us in understanding the Quijote, once we have studied them and formed our conclusions about them for ourselves.\n\nThe present monograph, then, will study the romances of chivalry without taking Cervantes as a starting point. In Chapter IV, some suggestions about the relationship of the romances of chivalry to the Quijote will be offered.\n\nA Definition\n\nBecause of the extraordinary imprecision of the general conception of the romances of chivalry, it is necessary to define clearly the subject matter of this book. If we were discussing Golden Age epic poetry, no one would expect to find in it a treatment of the Cid, or the romancero, or of Ariosto, except perhaps as works indirectly associated with the genre, as antecedents, or as illustrations of the same forms or principles in the literatures of other countries. Similarly, if we were discussing the Spanish pastoral novel, one would not include Virgil, Theocritus, or Sannazaro, except in a discussion of predecessors.\n\nYet such confusion is precisely what we find among those who write on the Spanish romances of chivalry. From the beginnings of critical study of the genre to the present, following, perhaps, the well-known process by which works were attributed to famous authors (Ovid, King Solomon), the true romances of chivalry have seen themselves classified helter-skelter with foreign works of the most diverse languages and time periods and with original Spanish works which can scarcely be considered romances of chivalry. In part this is due to a confusion between chivalric material and romances of chivalry: ballads, for example, may deal with deeds of knights, such as Bernardo del Carpio, or even with the heroes of the romances of chivalry, such as Amadís de Gaula and the Caballero del Febo7 , but this does not mean that they themselves are romances of chivalry. In part it is also due to the unfortunate confusion caused by the different meanings of the word «romance» in English and Spanish8 .\n\nExamples of this confusion are easily offered. In the first survey of Spanish romances, Vicente Salvá treated Apuleius' Golden Ass as if it were a romance of chivalry9 . The French bibliographer Brunet included Tirso de Molina's Deleitar aprovechando with the romances10 , and as late as the Catálogo de la biblioteca de [Pedro] Salvá (Barcelona, 1872) we find Heliodorus' Historia etiópica de los amores de Teágenes y Cariclea, to contemporary readers certainly the very antithesis of a romance of chivalry11 , included in this classification12 . A number of chivalric tales translated from French, such as Oliveros de Castilla, are commonly included with the Spanish romances, as are other translations, such as Roberto el Diablo and Clamades y Clarmonda, whose similarity with the Spanish romances is that they are fictional narratives in prose13 . Even within the strictly Spanish material, the Amadís and the Palmerín series of romances attracted to themselves, by the same process, material that did not belong: Polindo was confused with the Palmerín series14 , and Lepolemo, the Espejo de príncipes y cavalleros, and Belianís de Grecia were all considered at different times to be part of the Amadís cycle or works of Feliciano de Silva15 .\n\nNineteenth-century critics and bibliographers may perhaps be excused for this confusion concerning the nature of the Spanish romances of chivalry. Yet the same errors are perpetuated by contemporary scholars who have had more opportunity to examine the works they deal with. While Henry Thomas correctly includes the Cifar, Tirant lo Blanch, Paris e Viana, Enrique fi de Oliva and other early works and translations in a chapter on antecedents, «The Romances of Chivalry in the Spanish Peninsula before the Year 1500», and draws a clear distinction between them and the vogue that began about the time of the publication of the Amadís, in his standard reference work José Simón Díaz mixes them all together and for some unknown reason includes them all under the fifteenth century16 . Following him, Maxime Chevalier does the same in Sur le publique du roman de chevalerie (Talence, 1968), and neither of the two collections of romances of chivalry published in Spain in this century -Volumes 6 and 9 of the NBAE17 , and the unfortunate Aguilar volume of Felicidad Buendía18 - distinguishes between works of different countries and periods of composition.\n\nWhat, then, are the romances of chivalry, the topic of the present study? We can begin with a very simple criterion: only those romances of chivalry written in Spanish can be called, or should be treated together with, Spanish romances of chivalry. We can take a great step forward in clarifying the subject matter if we exclude works that are translations into Spanish from other languages19 . But we are still left with too large and imprecise a body of texts. Consulting the nineteenth edition of the Academia dictionary, we find that a «libro de caballerías» is an «especie de novela antigua en que se cuentan las hazañas y hechos fabulosos de caballeros aventureros o andantes». The Diccionario de Autoridades says that «libros de caballerías se llaman aquellos que contienen hechos e historias fingidas de héroes fabulosos. Tomaron este nombre de que fingían que los héroes que hablaban en ellas eran caballeros armados»20 . And going yet further back, to Covarrubias, we find that libros de caballerías are «los que tratan de hazañas de cavalleros andantes, ficciones gustosas y artificiosas de mucho entretenimiento y poco provecho, como los libros de Amadís, de don Galaor, del cavallero del Febo y los demás»21 .\n\nSo the romances are books which «tratan de hazañas de caballeros andantes», and the oldest definition, the closest to the time of the romances' greatest popularity, gives us some specific references: the books of Amadís and don Galaor, his brother, the Caballero del Febo, and «all the rest», thus reflecting the common conception that the romances of chivalry are unmanageable because of their number, though certainly there were no more of them than there were epic poems.\n\nThere are also internal references in the romances of chivalry which aid us in determining what books the authors were familiar with, and which knights they considered to be in the same category or class as the heroes of the books they were writing. Marcos Martínez, the author of the Espejo de príncipes or Caballero del Febo, Part III (see infra, «The Pseudo-Historicity of the Romances of Chivalry»), includes Amadís and his relatives, Primaleón, Cristalián de España, Olivante de Laura, Belianis de Grecia, and Felixmarte de Hircania. In the prologue to Olivante de Laura we find the Amadís and Palmerín families, and Clarián de Landanís. The author of Cirongilio de Tracia mentions an earlier romance, Felix Magno22 .\n\nAnother source which we can use to discover what the contemporaries considered to be romances of chivalry are the criticisms of the romances, in which specific works are often named. (The criticisms are discussed more fully below). Juan de Valdés, in his Diálogo de la lengua, speaks of Amadís de Gaula, Palmerín, Primaleón, Esplandián, Florisando, Lisuarte, and the Caballero de la Cruz, and separates in a different group, as inferior works, other books which are actually translations: Guarino Mezquino, La linda Melosina, Reinaldos de Montalván con La Trapisonda, Oliveros de Castilla23 . Pedro Mexía refers to the Amadís, Lisuartes, and Clarianes24 ; Malón de Chaide to the Amadises, Floriseles, Belianís, and Lisuarte25 . Mateo Alemán criticizes those women who read Belianís, Amadís, Esplandián, and the Caballero del Febo26 .\n\nRather than continue with lists of names, we can summarize the results obtained from this examination of titles, distinguishing those works thought to be romances of chivalry. There are constant references to the Amadís, and almost as frequent ones to Palmerín de Olivia and Primaleón. Closely following in numbers of citations are the later books of the Amadís family, such as Lisuarte de Grecia, Amadís de Grecia, and Florisel de Niquea, and in the early works there are more than a few references to Clarián de Landanís, a lengthy cycle, which evidently, from its popularity, deserves more study than it has received. In the later authors there are various references to Belianís de Grecia, the Caballero del Febo, and other later books27 . There are less frequent references to translations, such as Tristán, and even fewer to works such as Oliveros de Castilla and Partinuplés. Finally, I have not found a single reference anywhere (excluding the Quijote) to the Caballero Cifar, showing that its one edition of 1512 did not remove it from oblivion, and few to Tirant lo Blanch28 .\n\nWhat seems clear from all this is that Golden Age readers had a clear and consistent concept of which works were, and which were not, romances of chivalry. Their preference for works written in Castilian shows that the use of language of composition as a criterion for identifying the Spanish romances of chivalry is a sensible one, and confirms that the foreign romances of chivalry available in translation were tangential works, having lost whatever influence they may have had in Castile in the fifteenth or earlier centuries. Certainly the works the contemporaries saw as being romances of chivalry had an important characteristic in common, besides their language of composition, and that was their length. These works range from moderately long to extremely long; the short, translated works such as Partinuplés and Enrique fi de Oliva are seldom referred to.\n\nSo we can arrive at a definition, partly positivist and partly empirical. A romance of chivalry is a long prose narration which deals with the deeds of a «caballero aventurero o andante» -that is, a fictitious biography. More precisely, the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Spaniards (and I am unaware that the term «libros de caballerías» was widely used prior to the sixteenth century)29 understood as «libros de caballerías» Montalvo's Amadís and the books written in Castilian subsequent to it, which are the ones we are dealing with in this book. As will be seen later, these romances have many internal elements in common, which also make them a cohesive group.\n\nIt can be noted in conclusion that the romances of chivalry which we will be dealing with are, then, those written in Castilian subsequent to the publication of the Amadís, including the Amadís itself and a few works, such as Palmerín de Olivia, published around that time though written slightly earlier. These books, it should be noted, were also the ones known to Cervantes, as they are the ones dealt with in the Quijote. Both in the «escrutinio de la librería» and in the conversations of the characters in the Quijote, the works named are the lengthy Castilian fictionalized biographies: Amadís, Palmerín, Felixmarte de Hircania, Cirongilio de Tracia, and so on. Translations into Castilian, short works, and works which are other than fictional biographies receive either the briefest and most infrequent of treatment (such as Tablante de Ricamonte, referred to in I, 16), or are not there at all. It is, then, the long, imaginary biographies of knights-errant, the «mainstream» works, which must be studied as potential sources of the Quijote.\n\nThe History and Present State of Scholarship on Spanish Romances of Chivalry\n\nIn contrast with a genre such as the Golden Age epic poem, the subject of over 200 dense pages in which Frank Pierce outlines the history of its study in Spain30 , there is relatively little to be said about the criticism of the romances of chivalry, especially in the Golden Age itself. The difference in prestige between the two genres is the obvious explanation for this fact; the epic was, of course, a genre in continuous existence since classical antiquity, and one of the few ways in which Spanish Golden Age authors could directly imitate classical models. Like the other forms of prose fiction, except for the so-called «Byzantine» novel31 , with its model, the «prose epic» of Heliodorus32 , the romances of chivalry had no classical model, no pedigree nor tradition, and thus very little prestige. Like the illegitimate son who unobtrusively exists and may even do great things, but does not share in the glory of the family, the romances of chivalry were only discussed incidentally by the literary theorists of the day.\n\nThe most familiar comments made by contemporaries about the romances of chivalry are criticisms; the romances were more often criticized, as poorly written, lascivious, «mentirosos», than they were praised33 . These criticisms have been amply discussed and analyzed by other scholars34 and are referred to elsewhere in this book; in my opinion they cannot be said to form part of the scholarship of the romances of chivalry, both because they are incidental comments, in many cases taken out of context (see note 138 to Chapter IV), and because most of the persons making these criticisms had not personally examined the romances, merely repeated and amplified comments of their predecessors. (The fact that these comments have been given so much attention in this century is due to their harmony with the opinions of certain modern scholars and their supposed similarity to what has been understood to be Cervantes' opinion)35 . However, we can find among them occasional voices that show a direct contact with the romances of chivalry, and, thus, more discriminating and intelligent commentary than usual.\n\nThe first of these more intelligent comments is that of Juan de Valdés. That Valdés had some direct knowledge of the romances can be concluded from the detailed comments made about them in the Diálogo de la lengua, and from the fact that the character Valdés had spent «diez años, los mejores de mi vida», on no more useful occupation than reading «estas mentiras». Although he criticizes as «mentirosos» (lacking verisimilitude) Esplandián, Florisando, Lisuarte [de Grecia], and the Cavallero de la Cruz [Lepolemo], and as «mentirosos» and «mal compuestos» the translations of foreign works referred to previously, for reasons he does not completely explain he praises «los quatro libros de Amadís, como... los de Palmerín y Primaleón, que por cierto respeto an ganado crédito conmigo»36 .\n\nA true scholar such as Alonso López Pinciano, one of the most influential literary theorists of the sixteenth century, also shows some discrimination in his comments on the romances of chivalry, prima facie evidence of more direct knowledge of them than could be gained from reading the comments of others. Although he repeatedly compares the romances of chivalry with the Milesian fables, which «tienen acaescimientos fuera de toda buena imitacion y semejança a verdad»37 , he exempts some from a general condemnation: «no hablo de vn Amadís de Gaula, ni aun del de Grecia y otros pocos, los quales tienen mucho de bueno, sino de los demás, que ni tienen versimilitud, ni doctrina, ni aun estilo graue, y, por esto, las dezía un amigo mío \"almas sin cuerpo\"... y a los lectores y autores dellas, cuerpo sin alma»38 .\n\nBut the well-informed, as well as the favorable, comment on the romances of chivalry is a rarity in the Golden Age. We need mention only, to conclude, the valuable information given by the authors themselves in their prologues, which have been almost completely ignored39 , perhaps because the most accessible books, Amadís and Esplandián, lack both prologues and dedications. The criticisms to be found in the prologues -such as the famous attack of Feliciano de Silva on his predecessor Juan Díaz40 , or the comments of Ortúñez41 - are directed at specific works rather than at the romances as a whole. And the sometimes eloquent explanations of the romances' purposes certainly reached a larger group of readers than did the attacks of the moralists and literary critics, and presumably influenced as well as represented the attitudes toward the romances of a certain segment of the reading public. The author of Palmerín de Olivia said that his work «está llena de yngenio e doctrina en todas sus partes... va en sentencias poderosa, en él estilo copiosa, en ninguna parte confusa, las palabras dizen con la materia, las sentencias ygualan con las cosas, guarda la maiestad en las personas, cuenta breve, proprio, natural, sin confusión de orden, mueve passiones quando quiere, propone, incita, persuade. Ystoria es adonde conoceréys las claras hazañas de vuestros mayores: en unos alteza de ánimo que fortuna no vence, en otros esfuerço divino que peligros no teme»42 . In the prologue to Cirongilio de Tracia the author praises the protagonist, particularly «la piedad que en el tiempo de su mayor saña se halló en él. No se movió con yra a las batallas, mas con misericordia y clemencia que tuvo de los afligidos y voluntad de deshazer los tuertos y agravios, donde todos los príncipes deste tiempo pueden tomar enxemplo para más buenamente governarse, para que con justa razón sean comparados al esclarecido sol, bien como lo fue este bienaventurado cavallero en su tiempo, en tal manera que sobró a todos los del mundo en bondad, en las armas, en esfuerço de coraçon, en nobleza de ánimo, en virtud de ínclitas costumbres»43 .\n\nThese comments, although of great importance for the proper interpretation of the romances of chivalry -which always declared, sincerely or no, a moral intent- and for an understanding of their position in sixteenth-century culture, again do not constitute scholarship of the romances in the sense in which that term is usually used. Such scholarship can not be said to antedate the seventeenth century, and the first two centuries of study of the romances of chivalry were devoted almost exclusively to their bibliographical problems. It was only when there existed, first, access to texts and an accurate list of those romances which had been written, and second, information by which to distinguish the first editions and the relative order of composition of the romances, that deeper study could begin.\n\nOne cannot avoid mentioning, for its contribution to the bibliography of the romances of chivalry, the Registrum of Fernando Colón, illegitimate son of the discoverer44 , and the somewhat lesser-known list of books given to a monastery in Valencia by the Duke and Duchess of Calabria45 , both of whom were, like Colón, readers of the romances of chivalry (see infra). It is from these two lists of books that we have any information at all about a number of works (Leoneo de Hungría) and of editions (the earliest known edition of Esplandián, Sevilla, 1510), which have since disappeared.\n\nReaders of this book may be already familiar with the name of Nicolás Antonio, who published in his Bibliotheca Hispana (1672), later Bibliotheca Hispana Nova, much bibliographical information about Spanish books of all periods46 . Antonio apparently felt a certain admiration for the romances of chivalry, and in the prologue to his bibliography offered a defense of them, comparing them to epics in prose47 . Included in his vast repertory are all the major Spanish romances of chivalry, and many of the minor ones. He ordinarily included only one or two editions of each. We find in his work Don Clarisel de las Flores, which he knew only in manuscript, as well as a number of works which have apparently disappeared and cannot be positively identified; Menéndez Pelayo made the irreverent suggestion that Antonio deliberately invented one such book (Penalva)48 . Be this as it may, his desire to include every book, no matter how slender the evidence for its existence, led him to unintentionally invent some Spanish books which only existed in other languages, such as Florimón, or the thirteenth book of Amadís (Bibliotheca Hispana Nova, II, 395-96), which are still found in standard bibliographies. He thus attained, with some justification, a reputation for inaccuracy in the entries concerning romances of chivalry.\n\nIt is worth noting that Nicolás Antonio used one of the most important collections of romances of chivalry, that known as the «Sapienza» collection, from the Roman university which owned it, consisting of books which originally belonged to the house of Urbino. Under colorful circumstances this collection left the Sapienza's Alessandrina library, where it was housed; it is now shared by the British Library, the Biblioteca Nacional of Madrid, and the Hispanic Society of America49 .\n\nNicolás Antonio's comments, which were arranged alphabetically, were extracted, collected, and supplemented by the eighteenth century scholar Nicolas Lenglet du Fresnoy, who dedicated a section of his Bibliothèque des romans (1734)50 to the Spanish romances of chivalry. He pointed out, sometimes with pleasure, the lacunae of Nicolás Antonio, indicated many more editions of the more popular romances, and mentioned for the first time some of the minor ones, such as Arderique, Claribalte, and Felixmarte de Hircania.\n\nThe first writer to discuss in print, however briefly, the content of the Spanish romances of chivalry was Francesco Severio Quadrio. In his Della storia, e della ragione d'ogni poesia, Volume IV (Milan, 1749), he gave the family trees of both the Palmerín and the Amadís families, and discussed how the latter were based, in his opinion, on the history of the early Gauls51 .\n\nThe honor of being the first Spaniard to study the romances of chivalry must clearly fall to the Benedictine monk Martín Sarmiento (1695-1771). In his posthumous Memorias para la historia de la poesía y poetas españoles (Madrid, 1775; written about 1745), he discusses them briefly, commending them for their language and relating them to the medieval narrative (i. e., epic) tradition. A more interesting curiosity, however, is his still-unpublished «Disertación sobre el Amadís de Gaula», a copy of which is in the Ticknor collection in the Boston Public Library. According to Barton Sholod, who has studied it, Sarmiento «attempts to place the Amadís within the broad scope of Spanish chivalric literature which he separates into four stages or epochs. The first of these is characterized by the... Psuedo-Turpin, throughout the eleventh and twelfth-centuries; the second is the cycle of Crusades romances most typified in Spain by the thirteenth-century prose tale, La gran conquista de ultramar; the third encompasses the totally fanciful tales of the fourteenth and fifteenth-centuries centering about «Héroes fingidos» or «Caballeros andantes» of which Amadís is the prime example; finally, we have the most lofty but genuinely human chivalric tale which ironically breaks with the past tradition of «pure» epic-romance and creates the new realistic mode, Don Quijote de la Mancha»52 . A Galician himself, Sarmiento began the modern debate about the original language of the Amadís by suggesting it was first written in Galician (Sholod, p. 195).\n\nSarmiento's «Disertación» was actually «part of a more extensive unpublished essay entitled La vida y escritos de Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra» (Sholod, p. 189). Sarmiento was thus also the first to associate the study of the romances of chivalry with that of the Quijote.\n\nAt that time (the late eighteenth century), interest in Don Quijote as a typically Spanish work, or as the Spanish literary masterpiece, was beginning, and it is not surprising, then, to find that examination of the romances of chivalry became secondary to the study of the Quijote. We would do well to at least mention John Bowle, the first modern editor of the Quijote, who (the notes to his edition show) had studied well several romances of chivalry: Amadís de Gaula and Amadís de Grecia, Olivante de Laura, Palmerín de Olivia, and the Espejo de caballerías. He had some contact with a number of others, mentioned less frequently: Felixmarte de Hircania, Tirante el Blanco, Belianís de Grecia, the Espejo de príncipes, and Polindo53 . Bowle's comments have often been tacitly used by later Spanish editors.\n\nFollowing the example of Sarmiento and Bowle in associating the study of the romances of chivalry with that of the Quijote, Diego Clemencín published in the first half of the nineteenth century the most important Quijote edition of that century (Madrid, 1833-39). Clemencín's substantial contributions to the knowledge of the romances of chivalry are discussed in «Don Quijote y los libros de caballerías: necesidad de un reexamen», included in this volume. Clemencín's notes to the Quijote are a treasure-trove of information about the romances; scarcely less valuable is his Biblioteca de libros de caballerías, consisting of bibliographical notes intended to be a supplement to his edition54 .\n\nIn the early nineteenth century, bibliographical information available about the romances of chivalry was approaching a satisfactory state, and there began to appear a series of articles or catalogues devoted specifically to the bibliography of the romances of chivalry. The earliest of these, that of Vicente Salvá, dates from 182755 , and already we find included almost all of the titles of romances and most of the editions. Finding the romances too numerous to handle unless classified, he began dividing them into categories, a practice often followed by later writers yet a source of confusion: «Amadís de Gaula y su línea» (in which was included Lepolemo), «Palmerín de Oliva y su descendencia», «Romances [sic] españoles de caballeros independientes de las antedichas ramas», «Libros trasladados [traducidos] de otras lenguas», including those of the Round Table and of Charlemagne, «imitaciones ascéticas y morales», «historias con algún fondo de verdad, aunque desfigurados con sucesos caballerescos» (included are the chronicles of the Cid, and La doncella de Francia), and «libros de absoluta verdad histórica» (the Passo honroso).\n\nSalvá, like a modern scholar, drew on a series of very diverse sources: bookseller's catalogues, the Quijote edition of Bowle as well as that of Juan Antonio Pellicer (Madrid, 1797-98), the works of Nicolás Antonio and Quadrio. Considering the handicaps he worked under, his work is a good one, marred only by his inclusion of works which no modern scholar would call romances of chivalry.\n\nThe most important contributor of the nineteenth century to our knowledge of the romances of chivalry, after Diego Clemencín, is unquestionably Pascual de Gayangos. Gayangos wrote a long introduction and the «Catálogo razonado de los libros de caballerías que hay en lengua castellana o portuguesa, hasta el año de 1800», found in Volume 40 of the BAE, and he published in that volume an edition of Amadís de Gaula that was to stand until the publication of that of Edwin Place in 1959-69, and an edition of the Sergas de Esplandián for which there is yet no published replacement56 .\n\nIn his «Catálogo razonado», again divided into categories, although different ones («libros del ciclo bretón, libros del ciclo carolingio, libros del ciclo 'greco-asiático' -los Amadises Palmerines e independientes-, historias y novelas caballerescas, libros a lo divino, libros fundados en asuntos históricos, y traducciones de poemas caballerescos, principalmente italianos»), Gayangos brought together all the previously published bibliographical information, including the rather unreliable data of the French bibliographer Brunet57 , and added a great deal of new information. Because he lived for some time in London, he was able to include information about the copies in the great Grenville collection of the British Museum (now British Library), and those in the private library of Sir Thomas Phillipps, the greatest manuscript collector of all time58 ; he also included, for the first time, information on the many unique Spanish items in the former Imperial Library of Vienna. The only major source he did not have access to was the catalogue of Ferdinand Colon's library.\n\nHis detailed and intelligent annotations were to give Gayangos' catalogue a usefulness and reliability the previous ones had lacked. In fact, it has been the basis for all subsequent bibliographies of romances of chivalry, including, indirectly, my own. He revised his own catalogue for inclusion in Gallardo's Ensayo de una biblioteca española de libros raros y curiosos59 ; his information was incorporated in the Catálogo de la biblioteca de Salvá60 , was the subject of an article by G. Brunet61 , and is the foundation of the most widely used modern bibliography, that of Simón Díaz62 .\n\nIn his lengthy «Discurso preliminar» Gayangos discusses the origin of the romances of chivalry in Spain and the controversies regarding the original language of composition of Amadís de Gaula and Palmerín de Inglaterra, both of which were claimed by the Portuguese. Of more lasting interest, however, are the analyses of a number of romances of chivalry which he provides. He summarizes for us most of the chivalric production of Feliciano de Silva, Palmerín de Olivia, and Primaleón, as well as others as diverse as Lepolemo and Florambel de Lucea. He was an alert reader, and pointed out, for example, the passages which show that Feliciano de Silva was the author of Lisuarte de Grecia (Book 7 of the Amadís family), Pedro de Luján of Silves de la Selva (Book 12 of the Amadís family), and Francisco Delicado of La lozana andaluza63 . He found a certain value and, in contrast with Clemencín (see infra), a certain diversion in the romances of chivalry, which make his commentaries easy to read and deserving of the circulation they have received in the widely circulated collection of Rivadeneira.\n\nSince 1857, when Gayangos published his volume, there have appeared only two studies of the romances of chivalry which even attempt any comprehensive coverage of them64 . The first of these is that of Menéndez y Pelayo, in his Orígenes de la novela65 . In this book Menéndez y Pelayo dedicates two chapters to the romances of chivalry, the first discussing foreign works translated into Spanish, and the second those which he called «indígenos», or written in the languages of the Iberian peninsula. Besides a detailed examination of Amadís de Gaula, he spends more time than Gayangos discussing earlier works, in particular Tirant lo Blanch, the Caballero Cifar, and the recently discovered Curial y Güelfa. Because of his wide reading in Golden Age non-fiction, he was able to illustrate in some detail the increasing criticism to which the romances of chivalry were subjected in the sixteenth century. These are, however, his only real contributions. Never one to disguise his prejudices, he devotes the remainder of his second chapter to a discussion of why the romances of chivalry later than the Amadís, most of which he had not examined, were not only bad, but monstrous. Although «el mayor defecto del Esplandián es venir después del Amadís» (p. 404), Palmerín de Olivia «no es más que un calco servil de las principales aventuras de Amadís y de su hijo» (p. 416), and Feliciano de Silva was «el gran industrial literario, que por primera vez puso en España y quizá en Europa, taller de novelas» (p. 407). Following well-authorized practice, Menéndez y Pelayo simply embellished the comments of previous critics when he had no direct knowledge of the works he was studying66 . With his overemphasis on the early works and uninformed attacks on works later than the Amadís he has done the study of the romances of chivalry great harm.\n\nIn 1920 Sir Henry Thomas published his classic study, Spanish and Portuguese Romances of Chivalry, in which he joined two earlier papers with others given as lectures at Cambridge University in 191767 . Essentially a bibliographer, later to serve for many years as head of the British Museum's Department of Printed Books, Thomas worked extensively with that library's large collection of romances of chivalry. In discussing the romances themselves, in chapters on the Amadís and Palmerín romances, and another on «Smaller Groups and Isolated Romances», he covers, though carefully, familiar ground, bringing together the contributions of his predecessors. He summarizes Grace Williams' discussion of the origins of the Amadís, and its indebtedness to the French romances of the Breton and Charlemagne cycles68 , and William Purser's definitive resolution of the question of the Portuguese or Spanish authorship of Palmerín de Inglaterra in favor of the former by an examination of both the Spanish and Portuguese texts69 . Thomas also summarizes his own publication, in which he settled that Feliciano de Silva was the author of Books 7 and 9 of the Amadís series70 , and also shows (pp. 302-09) that the second book of Lepolemo, Leandro el Bel, was in fact a translation from the Italian.\n\nMore than half of his study, however, is devoted to assessing the popularity of the romances of chivalry both in Spain and abroad. He arranged the romances into a list by date of publication, thus showing clearly when they found the greatest favor and when their decline in popularity began; he added to Menéndez y Pelayo's collection of comments by non-fictional writers on the romances of chivalry. The discussion of the translations of the Spanish romances into other languages could have been written by none other than a competent bibliographer, and it is only very recently71 that any attempt has been made to improve on his treatment of the subject.\n\nSince the publication in 1920 of the book of Henry Thomas there has been no attempt at a comprehensive treatment of the Spanish romances of chivalry. It is, however, not out of order for us to review the most important, though more limited contributions which have been made over the last fifty years. Most of this work has, for obvious reasons, centered on the romances which are most accessible. Much has been written about Amadís de Gaula. Edwin Place, in particular, dedicated much of his career to working with this book, preparing a critical edition based on the earliest complete text, that of 150872 , and wrote articles on its original language of composition73 , its relationship with earlier chivalric material74 , the date of Montalvo's redaction75 , and to other problems related with the book76 . Others have also discussed the interpretation of the Amadís of Montalvo and the characteristics of the primitive Amadís which preceded it77 , and while this volume was in preparation, Frank Pierce published in the Twayne World Authors Series a volume on Amadís de Gaula (Boston: G. K. Hall, 1976).\n\nThe Sergas de Esplandián, available in Gayangos' edition, has been the subject of important studies by José Amezcua and Samuel Gili Gaya78 . Two volumes of studies accompanied the recent publication of an edition of Palmerín de Olivia79 . Maxime Chevalier has investigated a number of later romances in a search for the influence of Ariosto80 , and just as Place discussed the influence of the Amadís on Cervantes81 , Martín de Riquer, author of an important series of studies of Tirant lo Blanch and of historical chivalry82 , has also discussed the influence of the romances of chivalry on Cervantes83 .\n\nBeyond this, it can safely be said that studies of the romances of chivalry have tended to deal more with tangential works, or with tangential aspects of the major works, than with the truly central works and questions. Thus, of the later books of the Amadís cycle, Florisando, Book 6, and the second Lisuarte de Grecia, Book 8, which are without any doubt the least important and least influential books of the entire cycle, have each been the subject of an interpretative essay84 , while the vastly more important later books of the series have never been the subject of a major article. Both the Amadís and the Palmerín series have been the subject of monographs, but both of these monographs discuss the influence of the series in England85 . Feliciano de Silva has been studied biographically86 , as author of the Segunda Celestina87 , and as friend to Núñez de Reinoso88 , but the only study of his romances of chivalry to date is focused on the study of the pastoral elements in them89 . Attention has been drawn to an earlier romance, Claribalte, because of its author, Fernández de Oviedo, rather than because of its literary value, which most agree to be slight90 . More attention has been focused on the reading of romances of chivalry in the New World91 than has been on the reading of them in Spain.\n\nSome recent theses suggest that this orientation of research on the romances of chivalry may be changing92 . Nevertheless, in Chapter VIII have suggested some topics for future research and some avenues which are worth exploring.\n\nThe Birth of the Spanish Romances of Chivalry\n\nAmadís de Gaula\n\nLike most forms of literature, the Spanish romances of chivalry were not created spontaneously nor ex nihilo. Although their sudden popularity at the beginning of the sixteenth century might, on superficial examination, suggest a new phenomenon, they have antecessors and are derived from an earlier chivalric tradition. Like various other types of Spanish literature, they are directly derived from the literature of a foreign country: in this case, French Arthurian literature. In a word, Amadís de Gaula, on which, directly or indirectly, are modeled all the sixteenth-century romances of chivalry, is neo-Arthurian (Pierce, p. 47).\n\nIn France the romance of chivalry was more of a medieval phenomenon than it was in Spain, more directly linked to the epic poetry in whose prosifications it began. It was primarily French versions of Arthurian material which, through Spanish translations and adaptations, gave birth to the Amadís and the romances of chivalry based on this work. Although the surviving Spanish texts are neither complete nor numerous, it is clear that the Hispano-Arthurian literature was widely circulated among the nobility, as it was one of the few forms of fiction available in the Middle Ages, even to that class able to indulge itself with pleasure reading in an age of manuscripts.\n\nBefore proceeding to discuss the existing Hispano-Arthurian literature, it is worth pointing out that I am deliberately omitting, as irrelevant, discussion of a work which some readers might expect to find here: the Caballero Cifar, which, I am convinced, has little in common with the Spanish romances of chivalry as they were understood by Cervantes and other readers of the sixteenth century. Even a superficial examination shows how different the work is. It is presumably based on earlier sources, perhaps some Arabic ones, but in any event, it is clearly not French in inspiration, it is not primarily a tale of love and combat, of deeds done by a knight in love with a sometimes disdainful lady, and it is much more moral and didactic in its intent than the other romances93 . Although there is some influence of Arthurian material, particularly in Book III94 , the work is far from being primarily chivalric in orientation, nor did it have any discernible influence on the romances which were to follow it. The supposed discovery of a source for Sancho Panza in the squire Ribaldo has been refuted so many times that it will not be further belabored here95 .\n\nArthurian literature in Spain has been surveyed by Entwistle, more briefly by María Rosa Lida de Malkiel, and recently in a scholarly bibliography by Harvey Sharrer96 . The present author can do little but summarize their conclusions. Prose literature is represented by texts of the Merlin, Lancelot, and Tristan families, though the texts are either fragmentary or relatively late. Pietsch, in his Spanish Grail Fragments97 , published the fragmentary versions of the Libro de Josep Abarimatia, the Estoria de Merlin, and Lançarote found in a fifteenth-century manuscript now in the University of Salamanca. A late 14th or early 15th-century Castilian and Aragonese manuscript of Tristán de Leonís was published by George T. Northup (University of Chicago Press, 1928). There is also a sixteenth-century copy of a lengthy fifteenth-century manuscript of Lançarote in the Biblioteca Nacional of Madrid; of this latter only a few fragments have been published98 , though Sharrer has promised a complete edition. The other texts available in Castilian are late fifteenth- or early sixteenth-century imprints: Tristán de Leonís (Valladolid, 150199 and Seville, 1528100 and 1534), the Baladro del Sabio Merlín (Burgos, 1498)101 , and the Demanda del Sancto Grial (Toledo, 1515)102 .\n\nThe influence which these Arthurian texts, especially the Lancelot, had in the creation of Amadís de Gaula has been discussed in greatest detail by Grace Williams103 , though it has also been commented on by Entwistle, Bohigas, Le Gentil, and Lebesque, among others104 . Although María Rosa Lida has pointed out some influence from the Troy legends105 , it can be safely said that Amadís generally follows the outlines of the central plot of the Lancelot. An unknown youth of royal descent falls in love with the wife or daughter of a king at whose court he serves. The knight rescues his lady from an abductor, thus earning her love or promise of love; the lady, for erroneous reasons, spurns the knight, who abandons the court and lives in solitude. Eventually he learns his true identity and is reunited with the lady. Court intrigue and discord among factions of the nobility play a major role in both works, leading to a complicated plot structure. Characters with magical powers, both friendly and hostile, appear in both works. There is an exaltation of adventure, honor, and love. Amadís, then, according to María Rosa Lida, from whom the foregoing is paraphrased, «offers a synthesis of the distinctive features of a typical Arthurian romance» («Arthurian Legend», p. 413).\n\nThat the influence of the Arthurian texts is channeled almost exclusively through the Amadís (Entwistle, p. 225) is due to the unique circumstances surrounding the composition, revision, and diffusion of this work. The dating of the composition of the Amadís in the fourteenth century, when the Arthurian romances were circulating widely in manuscript, is not disputed (Pierce, p. 39). For reasons not known to us, a fifteenth-century gentleman, Garci Rodríguez de Montalvo, took this older text and revised it, abbreviating it, adapting it, perhaps, more to the tastes of the Spanish, with purer love and more emphasis on combat, and certainly improving its language and style. This revised version, published in the sixteenth-century, was thus a link between the medieval and the Renaissance periods: a work of medieval inspiration, composition, and themes, but packaged and distributed in a way that Renaissance readers would find attractive.\n\nIt would be difficult to exaggerate the popularity of Montalvo's Amadís in sixteenth-century Spain. It had far and away the largest number of editions and copies printed, and has been, from its publication, the most widely read Spanish romance of chivalry, a distinction which it holds through the present day. Even among those who had not read the work, almost all literate, and many illiterate Spaniards knew the name of the work, just as most recognize the title Don Quijote today. Amadís was one of the limited number of romances made into ballads and plays; it was the romance used by Bernal Díaz del Castillo in his famous comparison (quoted by Thomas, p. 82). It was «a recognized manual of chivalry and courtesy» (Thomas, p. 63). Phrases from the Amadís, such as «Agrajes sin obras», entered the Spanish language106 , which happened with no other romance.\n\nJust as the writings of Aristotle defined what would later be called the field of philosophy, so the Amadís defined what the romance of chivalry would be in Spain. From Amadís the other romances took their basic framework: the traveling prince, the constant tournaments and battles, the remote setting in a mountainous, forested (never desert or jungle) land, the interest in honor and fame. Variations on the basic pattern, such as the dama belicosa, are really minor. To use a protagonist who was not of royal blood, to have a visit to a realistic Spain (or any other location the Spanish readers would know something about) would have been felt as a major break with this venerable tradition, not to be made until the Lazarillo broke many conventions simultaneously.\n\nIt is just as difficult to exaggerate the popularity and influence of the Amadís in sixteenth-century Spanish letters and culture as it is to explain the precise reasons why it was so popular. One contemporary reader, Juan de Valdés, praised its language (the quotation is reproduced on p. 11), and certainly in an age sensitive to style this must have been a fact, though presumably not an exclusive one. Perhaps a nationalistic factor, as well, in that Amadís was seen as a clearly Castilian, rather than foreign, work107 , may have contributed to the book's appeal in Spain. Probably, though, the simple fact that the book contains a good story, with lots of exciting action, was most important.\n\nFor action the Amadís has, above all things. Amadís, set adrift by his unmarried (though secretly pledged) mother, is raised at the court of King Languines of Scotland, where he falls in love with Oriana, daughter of King Lisuarte of Great Britain, also living with the King of Scotland. Amadís is dubbed a knight by his father, Perión de Gaula, though their relationship is unknown to both. He rapidly distinguishes himself, aiding in the defeat of the evil King Abiés of Ireland. Enchanted by the evil magician Arcaláus, then freed, he also distinguishes himself in a great tournament held in London, and must free Oriana and defeat the usurping king Barsinán. His assistance to Queen Briolanja of Sobradisa causes the jealousy of Oriana.\n\nThis summary, which ignores a host of minor characters and adventures, and which could well provide material in itself for a lengthy novel, covers only one of the four books of Montalvo's Amadís. Book II describes the marvels of the Ínsola Firme, including the Arco de los Leales Amadores, which Amadís successfully attempts. Upon receiving a letter from Oriana accusing him of disloyalty, he makes his famous retirement to the island of the Peña Pobre, abandoning his arms, which causes those he has left behind to fear his death. Upon receipt of a letter assuring him of Oriana's good graces, he sets out to meet her at the castle of Miraflores, with further adventures on the way, but he must leave the court again after the mind of King Lisuarte is poisoned by treasonous advice from friends of Falangris, brother of Lisuarte.\n\nIn Book III Oriana gives birth to Esplandián, son of Amadís, whose name is written on his body in unintelligible letters; the infant is stolen by a lioness and raised by the hermit Nasciano. Further adventures and travels of Amadís are highlighted by the defeat of a monster, the endriago, on the Ínsola del Diablo. While Amadís is away, travelling in Germany, Constantinople, and other parts of Europe, King Lisuarte has made plans for Oriana to marry the emperor of Rome; Amadís must attack the fleet taking Oriana to her husband.\n\nIn Book IV, after an unsuccessful attempt to reconcile all the various dissidents, Amadís decides that war with Lisuarte is the only course open. After two great battles, peace is restored by the intervention of Nasciano, who, bringing Esplandián into the story in a more active way, reconciles Lisuarte to the marriage of Oriana and Amadís. After the various festivities which accompany the marriage of Amadís and Oriana, Lisuarte is kidnapped and enchanted. The book ends on an inconclusive note (also setting a precedent for the romances of chivalry; see infra), with Esplandián being armed a knight.\n\nOnce again we must emphasize the abbreviated and incomplete nature of this summary of a complicated series of characters and events, typically the despair of anyone who tries to summarize this book or any of the later romances of chivalry. Surely, however, contemporary readers, with time to spare and an interest in a captivating, complicated narrative, must have found this very quantity of characters and events to be one of the most attractive features of the book. Although the number of events and characters does not allow for any great development of personality -characters are essentially static and unchanging, always good or evil if such is their nature- this deficiency by modern standards was not seen as such by readers of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, whom, we may assume, were not interested in personality development, internal problems of the characters, or very much beyond the conflicts, loves, and prophecies found in the book.\n\nThese latter, which were not mentioned in the summary above, are another reflection of the Arthurian romances in the Amadís, since the cryptic prophecies of Merlin, usually a combination of vague comments and specific references to some contemporary events, are echoed in the frequent appearances of Urganda la Desconocida. Urganda is a mysterious character in herself, whose origin and function are not fully explained. She frequently appears in the story, assisting Amadís, and delivers advice -ignored at the characters' peril- about the future. In general, she is an important contribution to the «mythic character» of the romance so well described by Samuel Gili Gaya in his published lecture (cited above).\n\nThe Sixteenth-Century Romances\n\nIn tracing the castilian history of the romances of chivalry, we could begin worse than by pointing out that the romances of chivalry, as a genre, are firmly centered within the sixteenth century, give or take a few decades at each end. It is true that the Amadís, which would circulate so widely in printed form, existed as early as the fourteenth century, and it is also true that there are a number of Hispano-Arthurian texts of earlier centuries. But as with most texts in the age of manuscripts, these were limited in their circulation. Entwistle's affirmation that there was «an attempt to carry some knowledge of this [Hispano-Arthurian] literature by means of ballads to the unlettered masses»108 is supported only by a very limited number of ballad texts, some of uncertain date (the ballads about Amadís were written no earlier than the sixteenth century), and a lack of evidence about the public these ballads were originally created for.\n\nAs stated in the preceding chapter, the Hispano-Arthurian texts are principally translations. As with most translations, the literary contribution they made, seen in a European perspective, is slight. The creative literary energies in Castile were not devoted to romances of chivalry: there is no figure of the significance of Chrétien de Troyes, Malory, Wace, or Layamon among those producing chivalric texts in medieval Castile, and there are no known translations from Castilian to non-peninsular languages. Also, these medieval Hispano-Arthurian texts were «not the begetters of Spanish chivalry save through their creation of Amadís de Gaula» (Entwistle, p. 225); in fact, they were of little interest during the last half of the fifteenth century. It was in the earlier court of Juan II when chivalry (as opposed to warfare) was most favored in the Spanish Middle Ages; Enrique IV, of course, cared little for chivalric literature109 , and the Reyes Católicos, though not completely immune to its charms110 , took their responsibilities too seriously, and were too interested in concluding the reconquest, to have much time for idle reading.\n\nThe romances of chivalry, then, benefited greatly in their extraordinary popularity in the sixteenth century from the possibilities that printing offered, and in this sense the so familiar Castilian atraso, by which this chivalric material, medieval in inspiration, arrived in Castile later, has a positive side. Because printed works, though still expensive by modern standards, were far cheaper than manuscripts, lesser nobles, and even some well to-do bourgeois, could share in the reading of the romances, something not possible in other countries at an earlier date. Yet still, contrary to a widely-held misconception, the romances of chivalry were not among the first books published after the introduction of printing in Spain in the last third of the fifteenth century. Not only such religious works as the Vita Christi of Mendoza and the Vida beata of Juan de Lucena, not only doctrinal works such as those of Cartagena were printed during the late 1470's, 1480's, and early 1490's, but also the novels of Juan de Flores and Diego de San Pedro were published, without, however, a single romance of chivalry being published in Castile during this period111 .\n\nPrinters turned their attention to chivalric material rather suddenly, in the final years of the fifteenth century and beginning of the sixteenth, as if motivated by a previously non-existent demand on the part of a body of readers -the nobles- not in a position, or not needing, during the final years of the reconquest, to divert themselves with this type of literature. As with other forms of literature, the printers first began by publishing materials already available in manuscript; thus we see published a series of short, translated works with a chivalric flavor, such as Oliveros de Castilla (1499), Paris e Viana (c. 1494), Enrique fi de Oliva (1498), and others, and also some much longer works, such as the Baladro del sabio Merlín (1498), the missing Merlín y demanda del Santo Grial (1500), and no doubt the missing princeps of the Amadís.112\n\nThe brief works, the translations from the French, did not survive the competition from the publication of the Amadís (before 1508), the Sergas de Esplandián (before 1510), and the new works, such as Palmerín de Olivia, which began to be published about 1510, when the existing chivalric literature available to the printers had all been published113 . We can only speculate about the reasons, and none of the potential reasons would completely explain the phenomenon. Printing, more compact than handwriting, and the use of paper rather than parchment or vellum made economically possible longer works than were possible in the age of parchment, and the in creased speed with which printed material could be read also made increased length desirable114 . The language of the earlier works may have seemed archaic to the readers, and the style more primitive115 . The Castilian readers may well have preferred more sober and action-filled romances, a taste already seen in the choice of foreign works to translate116 . In any event, as Hall points out, even the works, such as Tristán de Leonís, that to some extent survived this period did not retain popularity past the first third of the century117 .\n\nThe so-called «indigenous» or native romances of chivalry, which were to set the pattern for those that would appear throughout the next half century, began to be published, as already stated, around 1510. The first «wave» of publication ended, approximately, with the publication in 1519 of Oviedo's Claribalte by the Valencian printer Juan de Viñao, who had, two years previously, published the little-known and curious Arderique118 . With the exception of the Amadís and the Sergas de Esplandián, which apparently reached their current form in the fifteenth century119 , it may be safely assumed that most of these works were written only shortly before their publication, and with publication in view. They include the sixth book of Amadís, Florisando, of Páez de Ribera (1510), and Book 7, Lisuarte de Grecia, of Feliciano de Silva (1514), although we should add that contemporaries apparently did not share the modern tendency to look at books such as these primarily as members of their respective «families», it was difficult, if not impossible, for a reader of the time to assemble most of the books of any «family», for which reason these books were more often read and discussed as individual works. It includes also Palmerín de Olivia and its sequel Primaleón (1511 and 1512), and the first book of Clarián de Landanís (1518); perhaps we should also mention the translation of the lengthy Guarino Mesquino from the Italian (1512)120 .\n\nThese works, if it is legitimate to speak of them as a group, are still relatively unsophisticated works, and except for Amadís and Esplandián, only Palmerín and Primaleón were to achieve any enduring success or fame.\n\nBefore leaving this early period of the Castilian romances of chivalry, it is appropriate to mention the publication of a number of semihistorical works with some chivalric elements, either written shortly before their publication or, more often, written earlier and published for the first time in the early sixteenth century to satisfy the tastes of much the same public as that which read the romances. These include the Crónica and the Estoria del noble cavallero Fernán González (Seville, 1509, and Toledo, 1511, respectively), the two chronicles of the Cid (Burgos, 1512, and Toledo, 1526, both reprinted by the Kraus Reprint Company, New York, 1967), the Crónica sarracina of Pedro del Corral, published in 1499 and several times reprinted121 , and also some lesser-known works such as the Libro de dichos y hechos de Alonzo Aroa (Valencia, 1527). The current distinction made between these «historical» works and the «fictional» romances of chivalry, all of which declared themselves to be purely historical works, was certainly seen vaguely by most contemporary readers, some of whom probably did not see it at all. However, quite apart from the question of their value as historical sources, the entertainment value of these semihistorical works can easily be seen. Their elaborate descriptions of castles and armor, the numerous and fully described battles and tournaments, the almost superhuman protagonists, show that they have more in common with the romances of chivalry than is usually realized122 . Some books, in fact, have title pages with an illustration of a chivalric scene, indistinguishable from those of the romances of chivalry123 .\n\nThe romances of chivalry's greatest popularity in Castile coincides neatly with the reign of Carlos V (1517-1555). During this time the composition and publication of new romances, and the reprinting of the classics of the genre, flourished as it never had before and never would again. New romances were published at the rate of almost one per year during this period, and there were twelve editions of the Amadís and eight of Palmerín. It was during this period that many of the romances which were to prove most popular were written: the works of Feliciano de Silva, Belianís de Grecia, Part I of the Espejo de príncipes y cavalleros.\n\nThat this great popularity of the romances was due to the model of and encouragement from the royal court is beyond question. We know that Carlos, so completely Hispanized and so given to chivalric spectacles and festivities124 , read romances, and judged Belianís so pleasing that he requested the composition of a continuation125 . Taking advantage of the interest at court, Dionís Clemente, author of Valerián de Hungría, pretended that he received the manuscript of his work from a knight of Carlos' brother Hernando, whom he met while accompanying Carlos to the court held in Worms in 1521. Although no romances were dedicated to Carlos, several were to members of the high nobility who formed part of court society. (See «Who Read the Romances of Chivalry?» in this volume). The French king François I first read the Amadís, and became enamoured of it, while being held captive in Madrid by Carlos (Thomas, p. 199), and Herberay des Essarts, who translated the Amadís into French, says that «maintesfois plusieurs gentilz hommes d'Espagne m'auoient loué [Amadís]» (prologue to the 1540 edition).\n\nOther factors may have played some role in the romances' popularity. Their harmony with the spirit which led to the conquest and colonization of the New World, basic parts of which took place during Carlos V's reign, may possibly have been an additional factor in their popularity126 . Yet we can hardly help but conclude that the lack of interest in chivalric fiction of Carlos' more sober son, Felipe II, was a factor in the books' decline. It is hard to picture Felipe taking a romance of chivalry to read at the Escorial127 .\n\nWe may well pause a moment to reflect on the fact that the authors of the romances of chivalry were almost invariably obscure men, or in one case (Cristalián de España) an obscure woman, presumably not in close contact with the literary circles of the time. The only exceptions that could be made are Feliciano de Silva (discussed later, in Chapter VI), who achieved renown primarily from his composition of romances, Fernández de Oviedo, who rejected his own romance Claribalte when he reached a more mature age, Jerónimo de Urrea, whose Clarisel de las Flores was not published during his lifetime and still remains for the most part in manuscript128 , and such definitely secondary authors as Jerónimo de Contreras129 , Pedro de Luján130 , and Antonio de Torquemada131 . Many of the romances are anonymous, and a majority of the known authors are known only from their composition of the romance; into this category would go Diego Ortúñez de Calahorra, Pedro de la Sierra, and Marcos Martínez, authors of the Espejo de príncipes y cavalleros, Pàez de Ribera and Juan Díaz, authors of Books 6 and 8 of the Amadís, Jerónimo Fernández, author of Belianís, Dionís Clemente, author of Valerián de Hungría, and so on. Similarly, none of the well-known authors of the period wrote a romance of chivalry: neither Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, nor Guevara, nor Jorge de Montemayor, nor even Ercilla attempted the composition of a romance, to say nothing of Lope, who tried virtually every other genre.\n\nThis phenomenon can only be explained when one considers that the romances of chivalry were the least «literary» type of literature being written at that time. There was a unanimous pretense that the works were true histories, only rescued from oblivion and modernized by a sixteenth-century contemporary (see infra, «The Pseudo-Historicity of the Romances of Chivalry»); this in itself could encourage the anonymous publication of romances. Like historical writing, the chivalric romance was a form of literature in which innovation was seen as unnecessary -at least overt innovation, since there is a subtle evolution, found in the increasing sophistication of conversation and in the expanding love element and greater role of women. Thus, despite the comment of Cervantes' canónigo, there was little about the romances to attract an author who wished to win praise for his literary abilities, and the romances remained in the hands of an other class of writers, not incompetent at their task, perhaps, but spiritually far from the intelligentsia of the day.\n\nWe should also remember that the world portrayed in the romances of chivalry was one which would appeal strongly to a section of Spanish society, but only to a section. It was a simple world, devoid of subtle philosophical or religious concerns. An individual could win fame and fortune primarily through his military abilities, whether exercised in serious battles or in less serious activities such as tournaments; scholarship and the world of books played, in the romances, a very secondary role. The knights-errant were often possessed of a crusading spirit and a religious element is always present. This is one of the ways these romances most reflect the values of Spanish culture, though ostensibly set in very remote kingdoms and epochs; this crusading spirit presumably influenced the young reader Teresa de Cepeda, and even more Loyola, also a reader of romances of chivalry (Rivadaneyra's life of Loyola, BAE, 60, 14b), who sometimes acted like a knight-errant a lo divino (Rivadeneyra, pp. 17a and 18a). Yet the knights' faith was the simple faith of the soldier, an uncritical acceptance of the correctness of Catholicism and the necessity of helping it, with arms, to vanquish infidels.\n\nFor all of these reasons, then, it is not surprising that the intelligentsia were to turn against the romances. The criticisms to which we have previously referred began, logically enough, when the romances had become sufficiently popular to attract the critics' attention; the earliest comments are from the 1520's. The early comments, such as those of Valdés, offer some intelligent observations, and I have remarked elsewhere («An Early Censor: Alejo Venegas», in Medieval, Renaissance and Folklore Studies in Honor of John Esten Keller [Newark, Delaware: Juan de la Cuesta, 1981, pp. 229-41) how the scholarly humanist Venegas played an important part in the attacks on the romances. However, these attacks rapidly deteriorated from sensible observations about the inherent defects of the books themselves to a series of complaints about the pernicious effects that they allegedly had on the souls of the readers, and how the books occupied time which might have been more usefully employed in reading more spiritually uplifting material. In fact, the criticisms of the romances degenerated into a series of topoi, which were repeated by various moralist writers who had no direct knowledge of the works they attacked132 .\n\nOne effect of the criticisms was to place the authors of the romances somewhat on the defensive. In the prologues and dedications of the later romances, in which the authors often discuss their works and their motives, there is a constant emphasis on the benefits readers would receive from them. One author, Diego Ortúñez de Calahorra, included explicit moral instruction in his work133 , but all the romances, according to their authors, offered «buenos ejemplos» to their readers, showing them the model of a virtuous knight, who never acted out of self-interest134 . In his concern for his subjects and for the persons he encountered in his travels, in his interest in seeing that justice was done and that right triumphed over wrong, in his humility, chastity, and calm temperament (mesura), the hero of the romances of chivalry offered to the readers the supposedly beneficial picture of the ideal medieval ruler.\n\nAnother result of the criticism of the romances as immoral and godless works was the production of the libros de caballerías a to divino. As with other types of literature a to divino135 , these were works of explicitly religious content, in which familiar religious and moral material -Biblical, in the case of the best known of these romances, the Cavallería celestial of Jerónimo de San Pedro (1554)136 - is adapted to the external trappings of the romance of chivalry. The knights are saints or Biblical figures, and encounter adventures either taken directly from the religious material or of clear religious inspiration. None of these romances achieved any great popularity, and there is considerable doubt whether they succeeded in supplanting the original romances of chivalry as escape reading for idle readers; perhaps instead they were read by a new class of readers who were unable, because of the criticisms of them, to read the original romances. It is worth noting that despite its religious subject matter and presumably noble purpose, the Cavallería celestial achieved the dubious distinction of being placed on the Index, presumably for some doctrinal error, which none of the secular romances were (Thomas, p. 169)137 .\n\nAlthough the criticism of the romances was followed by a decline in the composition of new romances, it has not been possible to establish the relationship between these two trends. It is not clear that the criticisms of the romances, which are well-known today since they have been assembled and studied by scholars, were known to the readers of the romances; it is more logical to assume that the works in which these criticisms are found (La conversión de la Magdalena, say, or Vives' De institutione fæminae christianae; the Diálogo de la lengua was not published until 1737) were primarily read by readers of a religious or moral inclination who would not have read the romances, nor much other secular literature138 , even if the criticisms had never been made. There are many other alternative explanations for the declining interest of potential authors in the romances. The general rise in literary standards, due in greatest measure to contacts with Italy, gave rise not only to the poetry of Garcilaso but to the pastoral novel, which made a spectacular appearance on the literary scene in the 1550's. The same period also saw the introduction of the Renaissance epic. The Lazarillo, with its anti-hero, as a response to the romances of chivalry has been suggested by many scholars139 .\n\nBut certainly one of the principal causes, if not the single most important cause, of the decline in composition of new romances was the abdication of Carlos V in favor of his son Felipe. That Carlos' reign ended in 1555 is no coincidence. The last work of Feliciano de Silva, the Cuarta parte de Florisel de Niquea, was published in 1551, marking the conclusion of the Amadís «cycle» in Spanish140 . Palmerín de Inglaterra, the last of the Palmerín series to be published in Spanish141 , appeared in 1547-48. The Espejo de príncipes y cavalleros and Felixmarte de Hircania, published in 1555 and 1556 respectively, were almost surely written during the final years of Carlos' reign. Olivante de Laura, published in 1564, bears a dedication from the printer rather than the author, which suggests that it had been written earlier. The «true» Part II of Clarián de Landanís (rather than the unrelated Book 2 of Part I, mistakenly used by the Toledan printer Juan de Villaquirán in making up his set in the 1520's) was published in 1550, though written earlier. After the death of Carlos the only new romances to be published are unquestionably secondary works -Febo el Troyano, a plagiarism of the Espejo de príncipes142 Parts II-IV of the latter romance, Leandro el Bel, actually a translation from the Italian (Thomas, pp. 302-09), Rosián de Castilla, a short work which in several ways is not a true romance, and Policisne de Boecia, which was published only three years before Part I of the Quijote, an unfortunate coincidence which has given rise to a conclusion I believe unfounded (see n. 320 infra).\n\nIt would be a mistake, however, to conclude that the romances of chivalry disappeared even though the composition of new romances had been abandoned. The reprinting of the major romances, and even some of the minor ones, continued throughout the last half of the sixteenth century. Lisuarte de Grecia, Amadís de Grecia, and Florisel de Niquea (Parts I and II) were each reprinted three times during the reign of Felipe II. Amadís de Gaula and the Espejo de príncipes each went through five additional editions, the Sergas de Esplandián and Palmerín de Olivia two, Primaleón four, and so on. As I have explained elsewhere (infra), this publication of new editions of familiar texts did not occur evenly, but in several waves of publication, and the dates of these waves allow the conclusion that the romances were still read by the upper and upper-middle classes. Although the last great batch of reprints occurred during 1587-1590, stopped by the national mourning which followed the numerous deaths in the defeat of the Armada, it should be noted that Parts I and II of one romance, the Espejo de príncipes, were reprinted as late as 1617, after the publication of both parts of the Quijote, and that this edition was not a commercial failure is shown by the fact that the same bookseller (Juan de Bonilla) published an edition of Parts III and IV of the same work six years later.\n\nDetailed information on the sixteenth-century book trade within Spain is not available, the only surviving documents being prepublication contracts, inventories of books made at death, and fragmentary information about private libraries143 . There is no later parallel to the Registrum of Fernando Colón (supra), which notes precisely the place and date of publication of a book, plus the place, date, and cost of its purchase, information valuable for the early years of the sixteenth century which has not yet been fully exploited; the published information about Colón's library ends at 1530. But information is available, in considerable detail, about the book trade between Spain and the Spanish colonies in the New World in the later sixteenth century, because of the legal requirement for inventories of goods shipped, and the systematic conservation of such documents. These inventories are particularly valuable for the years after 1580 (Leonard, p. 132). Although the Spanish colonies' reading tastes may not have been identical with those of Spain, the mother country and her colonies were closer culturally at that time than they were ever to be again, and the publications, for example, of the Cromberger family, which benefited from its Sevillian location to publish to a considerable extent for the New World trade, do not differ as dramatically as Leonard believes from those of publishers in other parts of Spain whose New World trade was less144 . Lacking evidence to the contrary, then, these documents provide some information about Spanish reading tastes in the later sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries.\n\nThe first, I believe, to obtain from records of book shipments to the New World information about reading tastes was Francisco Rodríguez Marín, who found that in 1605, the same year as the publication of Part I of the Quijote, numerous romances of chivalry of all types were sent to the New World145 . It was Irving Leonard, however, who has most thoroughly investigated these documentary materials146 . He found that romances of chivalry remained an important item in the book trade throughout the last years of the sixteenth century and in the opening years of the seventeenth, since the book dealers continued to sell, and the public to buy, those romances which had remained available since their last printings of ten to twenty years before.\n\nThe consequences for Cervantes of the continued circulation of the romances of chivalry in late sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century Spain are important ones, for they help lay to rest a commonly-held notion, already attacked by Rodríguez Marín147 , that the romances of chivalry were already dead by the time of the composition of the Quijote148 . Were this the case, of course, Cervantes' repeated declarations that he intended to attack the romances by writing the Quijote could be interpreted as a disguise of his true, perhaps philosophical, intention. Yet the facts do not support this conclusion, since the romances were read right up until 1605149 , and their disappearance was even more remote in the last decades of the sixteenth century, when Cervantes probably began the composition of Part I150 .\n\nIt is true, of course, that no new romances, and few reprints, were published after 1602. There is evidence, however, to attack the notion, even more commonly held than the one just referred to, that the Quijote achieved with its publication its declared purpose of completely ending the popularity of the romances of chivalry. Quite aside from Leonard's support for the Guzmán de Alfarache as a more important cause of declining interest in the romances of chivalry (Books of the Brave, p. 264), we should avoid the conclusion that if no more romances were published after 1602 or 1605 -for which reason, obviously, few copies could be shipped to the New World (Leonard, Books of the Brave, p. 286)- they were discarded and quickly forgotten. The reprinting of the Espejo de princípes in 1617-23, the use made of the romances as subject for various plays written after 1605 (Thomas, pp. 78-79, 116-17, 126), the ownership of copies of the romances by individuals151 , the appearance of the heroes of romances in masks after the Quijote show that «Cervantes' recent burlesquing of the fantastic adventures of these fictional supermen had not yet destroyed their vogue»152 . When Lope praises the romances in 1620 (Thomas, p. 154), and Gracián inveighs against them in the Criticón153 , the composition and publication of the Quijote may have been more a symbol of the romances' gradual decline than a major cause of it. The simultaneous appearance of Don Quijote and the heroes of romances in masks154 suggests that Don Quijote was seen not as an answer to the romances, but as a new type, an «Amadís a lo ridículo» as Nicolás Antonio called him155 , a continuation rather than an antithesis.\n\nA useful parallel can be drawn with the Western movie of the United States, also an art form of escapist intent, whose connection with the past on which it claims to be based can at times be very loose indeed. The Western was one of the earliest types of motion picture, which reached its greatest heights during the first half century after the beginning of motion pictures. At the present moment it can safely be said to be moribund: few directors with artistic pretentions would wish to make a Western, and they are not paid much attention by current film critics or the discerning public (the «intelligentsia» of film-goers). The genre has been so exploited and become so hackneyed that parodic Westerns, such as Cat Ballou, can be made. Yet it would be a serious mistake to consider the Western film dead. Some films continue to be made, a body of fans exists who view when possible the older films, and American Westerns, like the Spanish romances, are very popular in many foreign countries, so much so that there are now «Western» film industries in several countries, particularly Italy and Japan. Perhaps most significant is the undisputed fact that even those who are bored with and contemptuous of Westerns, and would never see one, know what they are, and have a general acquaintance with the main works and the stock situations of the genre.\n\nWhen, then, did the Spanish romance of chivalry die? The answer to this question must be that it did not die suddenly, on any specific day or within any specific year or even decade. Like an aged person, it lingered on, gradually failing for years, well into the seventeenth century, before it could be said to be completely dead. It is more a case of it fading away, losing gradually the interest of larger proportions of the public156 , being restricted to ever smaller circles of active readers. Julio Caro Baroja even suggests that it never died completely, that there remained some readers, a continually smaller and less cultured group, practically up to the beginnings of modern scholarship and the first modern edition of the Amadís, in the nineteenth century157 . Whether this is the case or not I have not the data to determine, but from the nineteenth century onward those romances which were available have been read fairly widely, culminating in the current interest in the romances by modern novelists158 . Certainly the present revival has not run its course, and we will see further editions and influence of the romances in this, the twentieth century.\n\nA Typical Romance of Chivalry\n\nPrevious books on romances of chivalry, such as that of Henry Thomas, have tended to talk about the externals of the romances -their popularity, their publication-, rather than give the readers a complete picture of what a romance of chivalry was. Perhaps this is due to the fact that the complicated plots of the romances are inevitably confusing and hard to Summarize, and those writers who do include such summaries often abandon them after a few pages, feeling that they are surely boring their readers and perhaps boring themselves as well159 .\n\nTo avoid this pitfall and yet give the reader of this volume a taste of what a romance of chivalry was like, this chapter offers a composite summary of the action of a romance of chivalry, made up of the elements commonly found in them. What follows, therefore, is not a description of any one romance, but is true in spirit to all of them. I have offered in footnotes a series of selections from various romances which illustrate the points being discussed. It is hoped, therefore, that the modern reader who does not choose to read a romance in its entirety, or who gets no further than Amadís de Gaula, which is in some ways atypical160 , will understand something of the world in which the knight-errant moved, and perhaps some of the appeal of these early works of fiction.\n\nThe romance of chivalry is always set in the past, even far in the past, though never before the birth of Christ. As is well known because of Cervantes' imitation of this feature in the Quijote, the romances are surrounded by trappings intended to give them an air of pseudo-historicity. (See «The Pseudo-Historicity of the Romances of Chivalry», included in this volume). They always pretend to be true «crónicas» or «historias». The manuscript of a romance may have been found in some remote place; it will have been written in some strange language -«strange» being, in this case, non-Romance; it has been translated into Spanish with effort. There is usually an «author» or «chronicler» with in the story, who may be a semi-official historian, setting down the deeds of his famous contemporary; he may be a sabio who takes an active part in the events he relates, helping the protagonist at crucial moments161 .\n\nFollowing classical and medieval precedent, the protagonist of a romance of chivalry is always male and invariably of royal blood -a prince. His lineage is usually specified. Through some mishap he is separated from his parents and his homeland when still a baby; he may be stolen away by evildoers, or carried off by a boat, or simply be abandoned by his mother because of the circumstances surrounding his birth, which often was illegitimate162 . He grows up in the court of another king, far away, though he may have been sheltered at first by farmers or other such humble people163 . Usually there will remain with him some clue, either a mark on his body164 , or some artifact which accompanies him (such as Palmerín de Olivia's cross165 ), to eventually provide the «proof» of his true identity when the anagnorisis arrives. He will eventually learn his true identity and be reunited with his parents and family, either at the midpoint or near the end of the book166 .\n\nThe protagonist shows signs from a very early age of his royal blood and the corresponding great abilities which were thought of as the natural endowments of a great ruler. He is exceptionally handsome167 , so much so that he captivates and gains the affection of all who see him, save those of evil nature. He may walk or talk at a younger age than normal. Being fearless, like mythological infants such as Hercules, he may perform extraordinary feats as a baby or young boy. Lions, symbols of royalty, instinctively respect him. He is exceptionally strong and vigorous, possessed of excellent health, never ill unless wounded. He can easily defeat a boy of the same age, who will more than likely be physically smaller, since the protagonists of the romances of chivalry are swarthy individuals, taller and huskier than the persons they come in contact with (see the text quoted in note 167). As stated above, the prince and king-to-be, in short, conforms very closely to the image of the ideal medieval ruler.\n\nWhile still at the court in which he has grown up he will receive instruction from tutors, such as a Spanish prince would; his attitude toward his studies will be respectful, not rebellious. He will learn what is taught him, which often includes a variety of languages168 , later to serve him in good stead, but his inclination is obviously not to books nor to the world of learning. His studies do not continue past his youth.\n\nAfter the prince has learned to ride and to fight with the sword and other arms, also at an early age, he will desire to leave the court where he has grown up and go in search of adventures; Rosicler, for example, simply «queria ir por el mundo a saber algunas cosas de las que avia en él» (Espejo de príncipes, I, 27). The protagonist has Wanderlust. There is always opposition to this desire of his, some attempt made to convince or force him not to leave -scarcely surprising considering that he is so young169 . He may have to depart secretly (an action that Don Quijote was to imitate)170 . By this time he will have been or will seek to be dubbed a knight, by the person of highest status he can manage to find and convince to do so -a king or an emperor is ideal171 -, and will have received as gifts his first set of arms and armor, his shield white as befits a new or novel knight172 . Later, after some especially noteworthy or significant adventure, he will take as a heraldic symbol an animal, natural phenomenon, flower, or some similar item, such as are found in any inventory of coats of arms, which in their origin were based on just such a practice.\n\nOnce he has left the court where he has grown up, the knight-errant (for such he now is) will travel extensively. His travels will be both through familiar and unfamiliar parts of the world: Europe, Asia, sometimes North Africa, sometimes to imaginary places made up by the author. (The New World, of course, had not yet been discovered). He may visit London, Paris, or Constantinople, cities already with some chivalric tradition, but never Rome, Jerusalem, nor a Spanish city such as Toledo or Santiago. The travels of the knight offered the author of the romance an opportunity to entertain his readers, always eager for discussions of new and marvellous places, and display whatever geographic knowledge he might have, and his powers of imagination.\n\nThe knight will primarily travel by land, on horse or occasionally on foot, but he may well have occasion to journey by sea or by means of some supernatural means of transportation. His travels may be for various purposes: to see, serve, elope with, or retire from his lady, to attend a tournament announced in some more or less distant city, to go to the aid of kings or queens in need of military assistance to repel invaders or to claim what is rightfully theirs, to obtain a healing agent for someone ill, to help free someone held captive, to catch a glimpse of some beautiful woman, to get to know the identity of or to find his parents173 . There may be no more significant reason than the fact that someone he encounters has requested his company.\n\nThe knight never seeks money; indeed, money is so seldom mentioned, as Don Quijote correctly points out to Sancho, that it seems that the protagonists of the romances live in a primitive era, outside the money economy altogether. The only times we find money mentioned at all is in terms of a prize or reward (more often a valuable object), or as a tribute or tax demanded by an evil ruler (as, for example, in Cirongilio de Tracia, III, 10). The knight expects and receives hospitality from those he meets along his way; similar to the modern Indian holy man, it was considered both a duty and an honor to provide for someone as valuable to society as the knight. His physical needs, modest in any event, are thus easily met.\n\nTo the extent that the knight seeks anything, he seeks prestige, fame, and reputation, and his adventures are a means of obtaining these. However, besides his extraordinary deeds, he also attains fame and reputation because of the qualities of his personality -the gracious way the knight treats others, for example, magnanimously setting free the enemies he has vanquished. Although he will never boast of or even recite his feats -for that would be a symptom of pride-, and may often disguise his identity, using, for example, borrowed armor with a different heraldic symbol, the news traveled fast in the chivalric world, and the knight-errant rapidly became well known and sought after. He is, in effect, proving that he is of royal abilities, and a fit ruler for the kingdom or empire which he will in the course of time inherit.\n\nPart of the knight's reputation, as we have just indicated, is based on something besides his ability as a fighter. He will, in fact, have a great many desirable qualities: intelligence, a calm temper, magnanimity. His mesura and cool temper were important virtues, for one with a hot temper too easily gets into unnecessary fights. The knight has a highly developed ethical sense, and always helps the more deserving of two parties to a conflict; in fact, he feels he has a responsibility to help those deserving persons in need of his help, of which there are many. The knight does not seek occasions for serious fighting, though he does for the less serious fighting which was intended as entertainment. He avoids conflict whenever possible, and only engages in it when reconciliation with his opponent is impossible, when the adversary cannot be made to see the inevitable error of his ways.\n\nHe will be a good courtier, even though court life is not to his taste174 . He is neither wordy nor taciturn, and may be able to play musical instruments and compose verses. He may have a good sense of humor and sometimes enjoy verbal repartée.\n\nWith all these desirable qualities and abilities, it is scarcely surprising that the knight is widely liked and respected. Nevertheless, there are evil persons in the world, «traidores» and «malvados», and thus he will have enemies. They may be simply jealous of him, jealousy being both a sin and a flaw in one's personality, or they may seek revenge for some defeat they have received at his hand175 .\n\nNot infrequently he may gain an enemy as a consequence of an interest in, or from, a female. Such enemies may invent falsehoods about the knight, accusing him of treason which he would never dream of committing. He may be accused of love for an inappropriate person, such as a (married) queen176 . Or the accusations may be less serious. Usually the ultimate fate of the knight's evil accusers is death, either because a battle is required to show, through combat, which party is telling the truth and to cleanse the knight's honor and reputation, or because the malcreants are put to death by the king when exposed, or because they cannot bear living in humiliation, which in the chivalric world, again reflecting contemporary Spanish values, was felt to be intolerable. The knight-errant and protagonist will not, however, seek the death of his enemies.\n\nAmong the evil characters the knight will come into contact with on his travels are giants. As I have explained elsewhere177 , the giants were not supernatural beings but merely very large and ugly men, who believed themselves to be superior to ordinary men and therefore free from the troubling need to follow society's rules. Giants are clearly the villains of the romances of chivalry. Never Christians178 , they usurped kingdoms because of their whim, and carried off women with the intent of raping them and men to be sold as slaves. (One may well note here a reflection of the Spaniards' attitude toward the Moors). The giants are haughty and disrespectful. They offer the knight the chance to show his extraordinary abilities in defeating and killing them; in the case of giants, he does not hesitate to put them to death. Occasionally one finds a good or reformed giant179 , and sometimes dwarfs180 , evil or otherwise.\n\nSeveral other characteristics of the knight in the romances of chivalry need mentioning. Because he is such a likeable person and a good companion, the knight is seldom alone. This is not because he has a squire, since the role of squires in the Spanish romances of chivalry, as Don Quijote knew, is a very secondary one. It is rather because friends of similar age, or relatives, accompany him on his travels. Often he travels with knights that he meets by chance on the road.\n\nThe knight is also an outdoorsman. He is not upset by the discomforts of travel in those primitive times, and frankly enjoys the nature by which he is usually surrounded. He goes through beautiful forests, climbs gentle hills, comes across fresh, clear rivers181 , is woken in the morning by the singing of the birds, and makes his meals when necessary from what nature provides. His main diversion, aside from tournaments or an occasional sarao with the ladies, is caza de monte.\n\nCorrespondingly, the knight does not like urban life. Cities, as well as creature comforts, make him uneasy and restless. To visit a castle, palace, or court (the latter usually set in a city) may be attractive for a time, but once the tournament is over or his business concluded, the knight feels he must be on the road again, an attitude clearly reflected by Don Quijote in II, 57 and 58 of the Quijote. The knight may even be surmised to have a certain scorn for those who do not share this view. One of the saddest moments in the life of a knight-errant (or in the life of a king, perhaps the protagonist's father, a former knight-errant) is when he finally accedes to his throne. Then he can no longer be «errant», for custom and good sense require that the king remain more or less in one spot, chained by his duty, and unable to travel as a younger person is free to do.\n\nWhile the knight feels comfortable in small groups and is glad to have company, he dislikes large gatherings of people. In a military action, conscious of his status, he will not mix with the common soldiers, though he will quite routinely accept a meal from shepherds if he encounters them on his travels. The tournament is the only exception to this, since tournaments are a basic element of the Spanish romances of chivalry, and they bring together a large body of knights.\n\nIt may safely be concluded that the tournaments are as frequent as they are because the Spanish readers found them entertaining, strange as this may seem to the modern reader who has lost the taste for this type of sport. A tournament would be given by a king, who himself gained status by staging one and by having distinguished knights in his court, even for a short time; the king also would enjoy recapturing some of the pleasure of the company of other knights, which he cannot enjoy as frequently as in his youth.\n\nA tournament usually had some prize or prizes to be awarded, some attraction which would draw knights. They came not so much for the prize to be awarded (since the winner, our protagonist, would invariably give it away in his turn, often to a woman present at the tournament whom he wished to impress). The knight entered the competition for the honor of winning the prize, the status gained thereby, and the social obligations he created with his gift. The most common sport at the tournaments was the fight with lances, long, thick poles with which two knights at a time ran at each other, on horseback, each attempting with the blow of the impact to knock the other from his horse. The force of the impact was considerable, and often the thick lances would break; the two knights would continue using additional lances until one was victorious182 . Although physical injury was not the object in this sport, which was often a game among friends, it was not uncommon for someone to be hurt.\n\nA sort of impromptu tournament, semi-serious, which the knight might encounter was the paso, in which someone would block the road, or a bridge, and the knight c"
