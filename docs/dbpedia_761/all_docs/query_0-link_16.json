        "text": "Spanish and Portuguese\n\nColonial Possessions\n\nAfter Columbus showed that you could get somewhere by sailing across the Atlantic (1492-1493) and Vasco da Gama sailed around the Cape of Good Hope all the way to India (1497-1498), it was clear that European sailing technology was ready to go anywhere in the world. In 1493, Spain and Portugal got Pope Alexander VI to literally divide the world between them, a settlement adjusted slightly in the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494. This basically gave the Western Hemisphere to Spain and the Eastern to Portugal. For the next century, this is pretty much how things operated, and both Spanish and Portuguese denied that other European powers had the right to have ships in \"their\" waters. The English, French, Dutch, etc. ran of the risk of being treated like pirates, even when they weren't.\n\nIn the present time, when \"enlightened\" opinion has turned liberal guilt into leftist self-hatred, with hatred spilling over for America, Christianity, Israel, most other religion (except ʾIslâm and maybe Buddhism, as long as it has been properly denatured), and the West, the \"Age of Discovery\" comes in for its share of vitriol. We are told, after all, that you cannot \"discover\" a place that is already inhabited, as were the Americas and most other places touched by European explorers. However, if the inhabitants don't know where they are, you can discover them. They are, in a sense, lost. And none of the inhabitants of the Americans or the Pacific Islands had any idea of the form of planet Earth or its geography. The Greeks had uniquely determined that the Earth was round, and that it was a finite body floating in space, with a rough idea of the arrangement of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Not even the science of India and China had gotten that all worked out.\n\nSo when Columbus set sail to the West, he was acting on a supposition originally expressed by Aristotle, with confidence that Asia could be reached across the Atlantic. As it happened, the Greeks had also determined the size of the Earth to some accuracy, which would have put Asia out of reach of the provisions stocked by Columbus. He might have starved in mid-ocean. His own confidence was based on a revised size the Earth, from Arab philosophers, who thought it much smaller. Unfortunately, the Arabs were wrong, and the Greeks right, but, fortunately, no one anticipated that there were whole unknown continents right where Asia was supposed to be. The Vikings, who had gotten to Newfoundland, if not to Maine, didn't really know where they were either.\n\nColumbus himself died before getting this all figured out. When it was, Magellan ambitiously realized the original project, although the Pacific Ocean still seemed a lot larger than it was supposed to be, and personally he only made it as far as the Philippines. It is perhaps not so remarkable, in the expanse of the Ocean, that no islands in Polynesia or Micronesia were spotted in the crossing. When his crew returned to Portugal in 1522, they were puzzled that their reckoning of time was off by a day. There was not yet an International Date Line to correct their error. That very error, however, proved in its own way that the Earth is round.\n\nThere is no minimizing or disparaging these achievements, whose very conception was beyond the reckoning of all the native inhabitants of those lands from the Bahamas West to the Philippines. It even occasioned some sober reflection and adjustment in India and China.\n\nThe attack now on Christopher Columbus in particular focuses on his practice of enslaving and otherwise mistreating the Indians. However, there really was nothing that Columbus did that the \"Native Americans\" weren't already doing to each other. There is nothing admirable about that now, but the Leftist picture that Columbus and Spain destroyed an Eden of peaceful and happy natives is nonsense. War, slavery, rape, torture, and cannibalism were standard operating procedure among \"indigenous peoples.\"\n\nPart of the fight now against truth is to say that all this terminology -- \"war, slavery, torture,\" etc. -- is part of \"European-derived concepts\" and thus inapplicable to the institutions or practices in the New World. The language must be \"decolonized.\" So \"human sacrifice\" becomes \"ceremonial deaths,\" which defuses the horror quite nicely -- as though people were dying from slip and fall injuries, instead of having their hearts cut out. Sophistry never had it so good. If we just didn't have those images of flayed sacrificial victims. We also see this in apologetics for slavery in Islām, which, we are told, actually was caring and mild, compared to what Europeans did, since they were mean. Same thing with slavery among \"Native Americans.\"\n\nNevertheless, when Columbus sent Indian slaves back to Spain to be sold, Queen Isabella overruled the practice, freed or redeemed the Indians, and sent them home, forbidding future such enslavement -- except of those like the cannibalistic Caribs. And activists sometimes misrepresent Columbus when they have him talking about slaves, when he actually used the term \"servants\" (servidores), not \"slaves\" (esclavos). But this kind of dishonesty is not unusual in such \"scholarship.\"\n\nIn fact, current accounts of Spanish practices in the New World sound like modern additions to the \"Black Legend,\" la leyenda negra española, the Protestant propaganda of the 16th and 17th centuries about the evils of Spanish and Catholic rule. The \"Black Legend\" in its own terms may be attacked by scholars as \"Hispanophobia\" and added, as anti-Latino (or \"anti-Latinx\") racism, to the list of political crimes compiled by the modern Academy. But these accusations can be dismissed in light of the urgent need now to add the modern crimes of Imperialism, Colonialism, and Racism to the content of the original, merely anti-Catholic \"Black Legend.\"\n\nReading a lot of recent historians, one might think that Rudyard Kipling had invaded Mexico, or that Montezuma was hurriedly consulting his copy of Lenin's Imperialism [1917]. The anachronism, and self-righteous \"virtue signalling,\" is palpable. We know that Marxists have actuallly ghost-written modern testimonials of the \"indigenous.\" None of their intentions are salutary.\n\nThat Old World diseases devastated many of those newly discovered populations may now be attributed to the malignant evil of Columbus and all European explorers. But any contact, of any kind, would have done the same thing. New World populations simply did not have immunity to Old World diseases, and nobody had any idea how devastating that could be. The diseases made their way to Peru before the Incas even knew about the Spanish.\n\nBut the Old World had not been immune from such effects. Somehow the Black Death, which followed the Mongols, and which wiped out about half the population of Europe, does not occasion quite the same kind of indignation and self-righteousness. Racist and, yes, imperialist Mongols. That tells the tale. You never get a break when self-hatred is involved. Meanwhile, no one asks the Mongols, or for that matter the conquering Arabs, to apologize. They're all rather proud of it.\n\nRepresentative of the kind of venom we see is a book, Unsettling Truths: the Ongoing, Dehumanizing Legacy of the Doctrine of Discovery, by Mark Charles and Soong-Chan Rah [IVP Books, 2019]. Since the \"Unsettling Truths\" begin with \"You cannot discover lands already inhabited,\" we have a clue what kind of \"truths\" these are going to be. The idea of the \"doctrine of discovery\" is explained as, \"In the fifteenth century, official church edicts gave Christian explorers the right to claim territories they 'discovered'.\" This is certainly a reference to the Treaty of Tordesillas, without the specificity that the \"official church\" meant the Catholic Church, while \"Christian explorers\" only meant the Spanish and the Portuguese.\n\nBut who cares about the Spanish and the Portuguese when the United States is the real enemy and the real target? The \"Black Legend\" doesn't do ideologues any good unless America can be \"blackened\" by it. So we go directly from the universal authority claimed by the Popes to: \"This was institutionalized as an implicit national framework that justifies American triumphalism, white supremacy, and ongoing injustices.\" A nice leap there from Alexander VI to, I suppose, George Washington.\n\nAnd, let me guess, \"ongoing injustices\" is going to mean, say, captialism? And, again, \"white supremacy\" is going to mean, say, capitalism? -- and also, we learn now, the rigors of mathematics? At the same time, Americans of Asian derivation or ancestry, who may work hard following a Confucian cultural ethic, are themselves thereby \"white supremacists.\" So, Charles and Rah are simply more of the communist liars and ignorant fools who now infest American universities like rats in the subway.\n\nBut since the Ottoman Sulṭân and Caliph, and the Emperors of China and Japan, claimed authority comparable to that of the Popes, but did not have fleets acknowledging their authority ranging around the world, an issue like \"white supremacy\" wouldn't have meant much to them.\n\nThe Chinese almost had their own Age of Exploration, as Admiral Hé sailed to Indonesia, India, Arabia, and Africa; but this was cut short by Chinese xenophobia. The \"isolationist\" Court faction didn't want any contact, of any kind, with foreigners. And, as we know, \"isolationists\" are the worst kinds of racists, Neanderthal troglodites, and sexists. The most intriguing thing about this period, however, may be the discovery of what looks like a Chinese anchor off Southern California. The records of Admiral Hé were later destroyed, and so we might wonder if a record of New World voyages also was destroyed.\n\nToday, however, we do see Chinese \"Han Supremacy\" operating in the colonization, slave labor, torture, and genocide of the Tibetans and Uighurs. This is rarely noticed by the Left, which regards criticism of Communist China as \"racism\" -- but who nevertheless are despised by the Chinese as .\n\nInstead, the authors, Charles and Rah, in their bizarre, trendy self-hatred, want America discredited at its roots. And there is no blanket delegitmization as thorough as telling everyone that they don't have a right to be where they are -- which actually would seem to include at least part of the heritage of a \"Mark Charles,\" and all of that of a \"Soong-chan Rah,\" whose name looks Korean to me -- and his school, the Christian North Park University in Chicago, is likely on \"unceded\" indigenous lands. While Rah is actually a professor of \"Evangelism,\" this book seems to betray a replacement of religious purposes with radical political ones, as is characteristic of leftist religious activists.\n\nI might direct them to the Turkish conquest and colonization of Anatolia, culminating in \"ethnic cleansing\" of Greeks after World War I, not to mention the Armenian genocide during it. And the Turks are still at it against the Kurds, who aren't even Christians.\n\nBut we might wonder about some other things. What do the Hopi really think about the late arrivals, the migrants, probably not before about 1500, the Navajo, surrounding and hemming them in on their isolated Mesas? What right do the Navajo have to that land? Inquiring minds want to know. Unlike the Spanish, they hadn't even been given the land by the Pope.\n\nThey had, however, been given the land, the Dinétah, by their own gods, the Diyin Dine'é or \"Holy People,\" whose creation and people were autochthonous, not migratory -- and this is in the \"Fourth World\" of the Navajo universe, the \"White World,\" which obviously reflects \"white supremacy.\" Those Navajo. Racist and colonialist Navajo.\n\nWith their own similar creation stories, many Native Americans resent the claim of anthropologists that they migrated from Asia thousands of years ago. Racist anthropologists.\n\nAt the same time, the Aztecs, the Mexica, remembered that they themselves were migrants. When they arrived in the Valley of Mexico, after some conflict with the locals, they found an island to settle in Lake Texcoco, perhaps in 1325. An omen appeared: An eagle, perched on a cactus, had caught a snake. Much as Brigham Young announced, \"This is the place,\" coming down to the site of Salt Lake City, this was the sign foretold by the god Huitzilopochtli. Images of the eagle and snake continue to be used in the arms and flag of Mexico, reminding us that the Aztecs did not claim to be autochthonous. Since the regime of the Aztecs was not loved by their neighbors, this bears remembering.\n\nCuriously, a similar omen of an eagle and snake was observed at the founding of Constantinople.\n\nGovernors

1999,\n\nReturned to China\n\nThe Portuguese had many more small possessions than are shown or listed (yet), but the Portuguese empire fell on hard times when Philip II seized the Portuguese throne in 1580. Portuguese interests got neglected, and when the Dutch and English, especially, got energetic at the beginning of the 17th century, Portuguese holdings withered considerably. Even renewed Portuguese independence in 1640 did not make possible a comeback.\n\nIronically, a British foothold in India began with the dowry of Catharine of Braganza, daughter of James IV, when she was betrothed to Charles II of England in 1661 -- Bombay, which soon became the base of British trade in India.\n\nPortuguese Eastern Hemisphere holdings then remained more or less static until the overthrow of the Fascist government inspired Portugal to shed its possessions in 1975. Exceptions to that were Goa and the other two Portuguese cities in India, which the Republic of India took by force in 1961, and Macao, which the Chinese had Portugal administer until 1999.\n\nOtherwise, the greatest Portuguse colonial possession was actually in the Western Hemisphere, namely Brazil, which became independent in its own unique way. The heir to the throne of Portugal itself followed the precedent of the other newly independent South American countries, and made himself Emperor of Brazil in 1822. Even today, Brazil is the largest Portuguese speaking country in the world. The Portuguese heritage in India is still conspicuous in the Portuguese names (e.g. D'Souza) of many Indian Catholics.\n\nAlthough not the first or the most important of the possessions of Portugal or Spain, Macao does end up being, not only the longest lasting, but the last of them all, missing the 21st century by a few days. Macao acquired a claim to fame before it was even properly founded, since St. Francis Xavier died nearby in 1552, after carrying his Jesuit mission all the way to Japan. His reportedly incorruptible body, however, was transported back to Goa, where it remains -- and is displayed periodically.\n\nAfter Napoleon occupied Portugal itself in 1807, there was a brief British occupation of Macao (1808); but then the Portuguese government itself relocated to Brazil, as an ally of Britain, so no durable British presence resulted. In World War II, the Japanese completely surrounded Macao, and their troops entered the city several times; but since Portugal not only was neutral in the War but was under a Fascist dictatorship friendly to Germany, Japan had good reason to avoid any more aggressive actions.\n\nWith the establishment of democracy in 1974, Portugal intended to divest itself of all its colonies. Curiously, the Chinese didn't exactly want Macao back. Like Hong Kong, the colony was a Chinese window on the larger world and a good source of foreign currency. In 1979, there was an agreement that Macao was simply a Chinese territory administered by Portugal. Then in 1987 it was agreed that the Portuguese would leave in 1999, two years after Hong Kong would revert to China. By then, China had opened itself directly to the larger world, embraced (some kind of) capitalism, and no longer needed the colonial intermediaries. So at long last the day of European colonies in East Asia passed.\n\nPortuguese trade with China had one curious and durable result, contributing the word for a fruit, the sweet orange, to many languages. This is discussed, appropriately, under the Princes of Orange.\n\nThe list of Governors of Macao is from a page at the World Statesmen site.\n\nSpanish Possessions\n\nCanary Islands (1404-1420, 1479-present) Melilla (1497-present) Viceroyalty of New Spain (1521-1821)\n\nCaptaincy General of Cuba (1511-1898) Captaincy General of Santo Domingo\n\n(Hispanola) (1492-1795, 1809-1821,\n\n1861-1865) Captaincy General of Louisiana\n\n(1763-1800) Florida (1513-1763, 1783-1821) Jamaica (1509-1655) Puerto Rico (1512-1898) Presidency of Guadalajara Intendancy of Yucatan Intendancy of Oaxaca Intendancy of Guadalajara Intendancy of Nuevo Mexico Intendancy of Vieja California Intendancy of Nueva California Intendancy of Sonora Intendancy of Durango Intendancy of Guadalajara Intendancy of Vera Cruz Intendancy of San Luis Potosi Intendancy of Valladolid Intendancy of Zacatecas Governors of Texas Audiencia of Mexico\n\nMariana Islands (1521/1668-1898) Caroline Islands (1527-1899) Marshall Islands (1529-1898) Viceroyalty of Peru (1533-1824)\n\nPresidency (Audiencia) of Cuzco Audiencia of Lima Captaincy General (Audiencia) of Chile\n\nGalapagos Islands (1535) Juan Fernández Islands (1563) Philippines (1570-1898) Ceuta (1580-present) Viceroyalty of New Granada (1739-1819)\n\nCaptaincy General of Caracas Audiencia of Santa Fé Captaincy General (Audiencia) of\n\nGuatemala Presidency (Audiencia) of Quito\n\nViceroyalty of Río de la Plata (1776-1816)\n\nAudiencia of Bueno Aires Presidency (Audiencia) of Charcas\n\nSpanish Guinea (1778-1827, 1884-1968)\n\nRío Muni Fernando Póo Annobón\n\nSpanish Sahara (1509-1524, 1860-1976) Ifni (1476-1524, 1860-1970) Easter Island (1770) Spanish Morroco (1912-1956)\n\nThe Spanish Conquistadores, fresh from the Reconquista in Spain itself, not only conquered many new lands, they were in the unique position to overthrow a couple of entire civilizations, those of the Aztecs (the Mexica) in Mexico and of the Incas in Peru. That someone would deliberately do this now seems unbelievably criminal and horrifying. There are some things to keep in mind about it, however.\n\nThe Spanish of the 16th century are now nearly as remote and exotic as the Aztecs and Incas themselves. Conquering Granada and converting the Moors was of a piece with conquering America and converting the Indians. That there was moral objection and dissent over this in Spain itself, and in the Church, does give us some hint of the values of liberal modernity, but the entire terms of the debate were still foreign.\n\nTo the Spanish ariving in Mexico, the religion and the culture there were works of the Devil. The Aztec priesthood, without exception, was massacred, for this tatooed and bloody hierarchy consisted of conscious agents of Satan. And, to tell the truth, even now one might wonder, given the practices of Aztec religion, whose daily sacrament was human sacrifice, and whose priests often dressed in the flayed skins of victims. What was normal and customary in Aztec religion now would only be represented in the most disturbing of horror films, as acts perpetrated by maniacs or, indeed, by those in the supernatural grip of evil.\n\nNor was this all simply accepted in the context of Mexico itself. The Aztecs were not loved, and their \"empire\" was a collection of subjugated tributary states, much of whose tribute was human. Several of them went over to the Spanish and provided essential aid in the overthrow of the Aztecs -- most significantly the Tlaxcalans, whose good services were rewarded by the entire tribe being made hidalgos, i.e. nobility, in the Spanish system, with self-government.\n\nWith two close allies, Texcoco and Tlacopan, Aztec Tenochtitlán ruled something much more like the Athenian \"empire\" of the League of Delos than a unified imperial state. And, as with the League of Delos, Cortés was able to lure away both Aztec enemies and allies into joining his own army against the hated Mexica.\n\nAztec Tlatoani Acamapichtlic.1372-\n\nc.1391 Huitzilihuitlc.1391-\n\nc.1416 Chimalpopocac.1416-\n\n1427 Itzcóatl1427-1440 Moctezuma I1440-1469 Axayacoatl1469-1481 Tizoc1481-1486 Ahuitzotl1486-1502 Moctezuma II1502-1519 Cuitlahuac1519-1520 Cuauhtémoc1520-1521,\n\nd.1525 Spanish Conquest, 1521\n\nNevertheless, while other scholars shy away from calling the rulers of Constantinople, Japan, or Ethiopia \"Emperors,\" we still get other historians, like Victor Davis Hanson, calling the Aztec Tlatoani \"Emperor.\"\n\nThe Aztec leader, the Tlatoani, which means something like \"Speaker,\" was an elected and very nearly secular, mutatis mutandis, official. The list of the traditional Tlatoani is given here. Unlike the Aztec state, the domain of the Incas was a tightly centralized monarchy, with a divine and hereditary ruler, the Inca. Moctezuma (or Montezuma) II, vividly remembered afterwards, was killed by a mob of his own people, who were furious at his inability to resist the Spanish (although sometimes it is claimed that the Spanish had killed him). But the whole Aztec Nation was unable to resist the Spanish.\n\nIndeed, Moctezuma's problem was that, as Cortés advanced, over months, into the interior of Mexico, the Aztec leader was kept well informed about the weapons and behavior of the Spanish. He knew that resisting them would be a hopeless business. However, after his death, resistence it would be. On June 30, 1520, the people of Tenochtitlán drove the Spanish out of the city, with great loss of life. Cortés was away at the time, dealing with his own problems with the Spanish government.\n\nRegrouping and preparing for conquest took until the following May, while smallpox struck the Aztecs, carrying away Cuitlahuac, Moctezuma's successor. The assault on Tenochtitlán then took four months, and it wasn't until August 13 that Cuauhtémoc, the new Tlatoani, surrendered. Thousands or even hundreds of thousands had been killed; and the Aztecs fought with the disadvantage that individual (Homeric) prowess continued to be valued over coordinated attack, and warriors still tried to capture enemies for sacrifice, rather than killing them outright. This exposed the distracted warriors to simple slaughter by the Spanish -- whose own Indian allies, however, also wanted to capture Aztecs for their own sacrifices and cannibalism.\n\nIt was a battle like Stalingrad, street by street and block by block. Since the Aztecs used the canals -- Tenochtitlán, like Venice, was built on islands, many artificial, in Lake Texcoco -- to mount attacks, Cortés ordered that they be filled in with rubble from each demolished neighborhood. The defenders could often clear them during the night, the way the defenders of Constantinople would repair the great walls.\n\nNevertheless, the resistance was ground down, and Spanish fury only increased, as they could actually see captured Spaniards (abut 500 of them) sacrificed on the Aztec pyramids. Since the captured city was then all but destroyed, Cortés decided to complete the destruction. The canals were filled in again and the character of the city was erased. Eventually, all of Lake Texcoco disappeared. Cuauhtémoc was later executed, in the treacherous manner often characteristic of the Spaniards.\n\nBesides the incommensurable moral paradigms at the time, the Aztecs and the Incas were in an extraordinarily vulnerable position. For all the centuries that civilizations had existed in Central and South America, they were still neolithic cultures. In their isolation they had progressed at a very slow rate technologically.\n\nThe Incas Manco Capac Ic.1200 Sinchi Roca Lloque Yupanqui Mayta Capac Capac Yupanqui Inca Roca Yahuar Huacac Viracocha Pachacuti Yupanqui1438-1471 Topa Yupanqui1471-1493 Huayna Capac1493-1525 Dies of measles or smallpox Huáscar1525-1532 Civil war Atahuallpa1525-1533 Spanish Conquest, 1533 Manco Capac II1533-1544 Sayri Tupac1544-1561 Titu Cusi1560-1571 Tupac Amaru I1571 Tupac Amaru IIrebellion,\n\n1780-1781\n\nThe wonder of their gold and silver work distracts from but cannot conceal the fact that the tools of industry and war were all stone.\n\nThe Aztecs fought, not with swords, but with clubs studded with obsidian blades. These could inflict nasty injuries, but they simply broke on Spanish armor; and Spanish swords could cut through the padded protection used by Mexican warriors.\n\nWith no draft or pack animals, except the llama in the Andes, neither culture had the wheel (except, curiously, on toys). Deficient in livestock, such as sheep, goats, pigs, chickens, or cattle, some argue that cannibalism in Meso-America was a compensation for this lack of protein sources. Victor Davis Hansen mentions that the adopted Nahuatl word for \"chicken,\" caxtil, was also their new word for \"Castile\" -- so Cortés had come from \"the land of the chickens\" [The End of Everything, Basic Books, 2024, p.238].\n\nSimilarly, the sine qua non of the Old World civilizations, writing, didn't even exist among the Incas, and was still a very imperfect instrument in Central America. Only now, indeed, is the writing of the Mayans becoming better understood, but its level of development never got much beyond what the Egyptians had in the Archaic Period.\n\nAfter the Maya mysteriously abandoned their cities, no further progress in writing was made at all, and the system the Aztecs inherited was less sophisticated. We only know as much as we do about the history of the Aztecs and Incas because of the living memories that could be recorded after the arrival of the Spanish -- though, of course, the many Maya and Aztec codices burned by the Spanish would have been a help.\n\nPizarro Seizing the Inca of Peru, 1846, John Everett Millais (18291896), Victoria and Albert Museum\n\nFor all the hopelessness of the encounters, what would one not give to have been with Cortés when he first entered the Valley of Mexico and saw the extraordinary sights there? Later, there would be much fiction and romance about \"lost\" civilizations, but this was the real thing, an entire world hidden from Ptolemy, Marco Polo, and Admiral He alike. And so, naturally, the Spanish destroyed it, usually with a treachery and ruthlessness nearly as appalling as the practices of Aztec religion.\n\nIndeed, while the Spanish can be reproached (anachronistically) for practices like torture and slavery, there was no disagreement about these from Native Americans, anywhere, who freely engaged in both themselves. The woman, La Malinche (originally Malintzin, then Marina), who was the translator and then mistress of Cortés, had been sold into slavery by her own mother and was among a group of women gifted to the Spanish. Her status only improved when it was realized she spoke both the Aztec Nahuatl and Maya. Until she learned Spanish, translations were awkwardly conducted through a Spaniard who had been a slave among the Maya and knew their language.\n\nLa Malinche had five children with Cortés, one of whom, Martin Cortes \"el Mestizo,\" joined the Court of King Philip II, was made a marquis, and was endowed with lands in Mexico, which he returned to govern.\n\nMoctezuma had been made hostage by Cortés, and Pizarro began his encounter with the Incas by treacherously seizing the Inca Atahuallpa, who had arrived without military preparations, despite leaving a large army nearby. Unlike Moctezuma, Atahuallpa did not have any intelligence about the Spanish and so had no clue about their weapons, intentions, or behavior. He was totally surprised and blind-sided and could not imagine that the few Spaniards posed any real threat.\n\nNevertheless, the Spanish had, after a fashion, already arrived, since their diseases had spread ahead of them. The Inca Huayna Capac had already died of one of them -- a mysterious business until later. While Moctezuma died after being stoned and shot by his own people, Atahuallpa was held to ransom by Pizarro, and then murdered when the ransom was paid -- and the sacred virgins of the Inca all raped.\n\nAfter the debacle with Moctezuma, and needing to fight their way out of Tenochtitlán, Cortés and his men, as we've seen, with their many Indian allies, attacked and destroyed the Aztec state. With the Incas, the centralized state was decapitated with the murder of Atahuallpa. At first, the Spanish hoped that a puppet Inca, converted to Christianity, would be a good means of Spanish rule. But the chosen instrument, Manco Capac II, soon rebelled, and resistance continued for many years, until the last of the imperial family was hunted down, captured, and killed in 1571. Thus, where Mexico had been conquered with fierce street fighting in one city, Peru became a matter of extended guerrilla warfare over decades in and out of precipitous mountains, valleys, and jungles. The result was the same; and the last Inca, Túpac Amaru, a nephew of Atahuallpa, was excuted according to the fraudulent conceits used by the Spanish.\n\nThis all leaves a curious heritage. Few Mexicans or Peruvians want to adopt Nahuatl or Quechua as their language, or revive the old religions, but the manner in which the Spanish language and the Catholic religion arrived and were imposed still can rankle. Indeed, the remaining Marxist ideology of revolution in Mexico (and elsewhere) has tended to focus on the poverty and plight of unassimilated Indians. Sadly, since the solution offered for their plight is collectivism and command economics (i.e. the paradigm of Cuba), they can be sure of remaining in poverty.\n\nIronically, the imperial language of the former Spanish colonies is promoted in the United States, without irony, as the medium of the downtrodden; and activists demand, in that language, Spanish, that \"Europeans\" leave, presumably so that the oppressed can enjoys the benefits of the cellphones and refrigerators that grow naturally on the land, ripe for the harvest. Karl Marx himself was not so stupid as to subscribe to the sort of Cargo Cult economics we find among the radicals. Yet, as in the United States, people vote for the mirage of \"socialism,\" and then they end up with poverty and tyranny in a communist police state, as in Venezuela.\n\nBoth the Aztecs and the Incas were heirs to much older civilizations, which are largely known only from archaeology. In South America there was no written language at all, not even by the time of the Incas. In Central America, there was indeed a written language, originated by perhaps the greatest civilization of the Americas, that of the Maya.\n\nSpanish possessions endured rather better through the 17th and 18th centuries than the Portuguese did. The annual voyages of the treasure fleets from Vera Cruz to Spain and from Acapulco to the Philippines were the lifeblood of Spanish finances and the perennial temptation of enemies and pirates. They also established the silver Spanish dollar not only as the common currency of trade in the New World (adopted by the young United States), but in the Far East as well. Both the Japanese Yen and Chinese Yuán were originally versions of the Mexican dollars brought to the Philippines.\n\nGovernors (Captains General)\n\nof Cuba, in Havana Diego

Díaz-Canel2018-present\n\nCuba, whose governors are at right, was one of the earliest Spanish colonies, and one of the last. The visit of the United States battleship Maine to Havana in 1898 was meant to show some U.S. disapproval of the measures that Spain was taking to suppress discontent and revolt against Spanish rule. When the Maine blew up and sank, probably from an internal explosion, Spain was immediately blamed and war was urged by many in the United States hungering for foreign adventure, imperialism, or something. The war was duly joined, and Spanish forces were crushed in Cuba and the Philippines. This was the end of a Spanish presence in the New World, 406 years since Columbus had landed.\n\nWhat followed was a kind of love-hate relationship between Cuba and the United States. Cuba today represents the relationship as pure hate, with the country suffering under the most durable dictator of the 20th century, Fidel Castro. After being one of the most prosperous countries in Latin Ameria in the 1950's, Cuba now has been reduced to a per capita annual gross domestic product (GDP), adjusted for purchasing power, of $1700, only 5% of that of the United States [The Economist Pocket World in Figures, 2003 edition, Profile Books, 2002]. This is better than most Sub-Saharan African counties, where Tanzania, for instance, only has 1.5% of GDP of the United States ($520), but it is at the bottom of the list for Latin American states. It barely beats out Haiti ($1470). Meanwhile, Mexico has an adjusted per capita GDP of $8,790, 25.8% of the United States. Cubans have told foreign reporters that just to make a living, everything they do breaks the law.\n\nDespite this miserable record of poverty, Castro was still nevetheless the darling of international \"progressives,\" and was regularly visited by fawning celebrities, such as, in 2002, Steven Spielberg -- the sort of people who wouldn't give the time of day to the despised former dictator of Chile, Augusto Pinochet. The modern Left has different ways of rationalizing this love affair. Since the promise of Communism to produce wealth has failed, this now can be interpreted as a virtue and Cuban poverty (except for Castro's own comfortable lifestyle, of course) construed as a noble ecotopia -- i.e. an ecological utopia. This is, indeed, the most progressive approach, since enlightened leftist opinion now regards the abundance of commercial cultures, and the consumer choice of market democracies, as the Rape of the Planet.\n\nSince most people don't buy the idea that poverty is good and that we should go backing to living at a neolithic, or paleolithic, level of culture, it always helps to have another rationalization ready. Thus, the American economic boycott of Cuba can be blamed for its poverty. There are two problems with that explanation. One is that it doesn't follow from Castro's own ideology. Communist and \"progressive\" economics have long recommended economic self-sufficiency and autarchy.\n\nThe Communists simply don't know why trade is necessary, and now would tend to regard it as an evil, not just because it will be based on market prices, which are evils in themselves, but because, like Plato, it is seen as the engine of \"unnecessary desires,\" which stimulate overconsumption and so the Rape of the Planet. The other problem with blaming the boycott is that the United States is the only major country boycotting Cuba. If Americans want Cuban cigars, all they have to do is drive to Canada or Mexico.\n\nThe United States has a very large economy, 31% of world GDP, but that leaves 69% of the world economy, including Europe and Japan, to help out Cuba. It doesn't help for one simple reason: Cuba is a Communist country. There is no private property and most productive economic acitivities are illegal. Since leftist opinion still doesn't understand what was wrong with Communism, it still can't accept that Cuba's problems are self-inflicted, or Fidel-inflicted.\n\nThe leftists hold to a sort of Cargo Cult notion of economics, that wealth consists of \"resources,\" which need to be divided up in equal shares for all (or not divided up at all, since they shouldn't be used, since this results in the Rape of the Planet).\n\nViceroys of New Spain, Nueva España Hernán Cortés1519-1524 Alonso de Estradaco-governor,\n\n1524-1526 Rodrigo de Albornozco-governor,\n\n1524-1526 Alonso de Zuazo

The best of both worlds then would be to embrace both, that poverty is good and that it is the fault of the United States.\n\nUnfortunately for fans of Castro, they may have helped elect George W. Bush President of the United States. In 1999 little Elián González, after his mother died at sea, fleeing Cuba, was brought ashore and placed with his relatives in Florida. However, in 2000, he was seized by Federal agents and sent back to his father in Cuba -- actually, of course, to slavery and brainwashing.\n\nCuban-Americans in Florida, a generation of refugees from Cuba, were (like any sensible people), outraged that the Clinton Administration and Attorney General Janet Reno would do something like that. In the close Presidential election of 2000, when the vote in Florida decided the outcome, it is doubtful that Democrat Al Gore received many Cuban votes.\n\nJanet Reno then tried running for Governor of Florida and was easily defeated by George Bush's brother Jeb. George Bush carried Florida again in 2004 without difficulty. Those who have ever since bewailed Gore's loss of Florida in 2000 should congratulate themselves -- and they may just have Elián González to thank for it.\n\nAfter the 2014 Congressional elections (when it would no longer hurt Democrats running for Congress), Barack Obama, proceeded to normalize U.S. relations with Cuba. This meant legitimizing the Castro regime, which has certainly been the heartfelt desire of the Left for years. Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry justified this by saying that now American technology and aid can connect all Cubans to the Internet. They overlooked the problem that connecting to the Internet would land Cubans in jail.\n\nThe problem is not lack of technology, but lack of freedom. Since Obama and Kerry really cannot be ignorant of this, their whole pitch is a tissue of lies; and their whole initiative is exposed as no more than a payoff to their friends on the Left.\n\nIndeed, this now exposes the real program of the Democratic Party as little more than to turn the United States into the equivalent of Cuba, i.e. an impoverished, totalitarian police state. Everything they do is directed to that end; and now they can openly pal around with the Castros, with Pope Francis joining in, to celebrate their victories over freedom, democracy, and capitalism.\n\nNew Spain begins with the Conquest of Mexico by Hernán Cortés in 1519-1521. It is made a Viceroyalty in 1535, and so was promoted in status beyond the earlier Spanish outposts of Hispañola and Cuba.\n\nThe Audiencia (or Audenica) was a governing court that consisted of judges, prosecutor, and other officials, under the Viceroy, a Captain General, or a President. Where \"Government by the Audiencia\" is indicated, it is under a President who is not a formally appointed Viceroy or governor. Government by the Audiencia in this way, or by acting or interim Viceroys is indicated where it occurs.\n\nThe racial hierarchy in Spanish America is noteworthy. At the top are European born Spaniards, the \"peninsulars,\" gachupines (now generally used derogatorily). Next come pure blooded Spaniards who nevertheless have been born in America. These are the criollos. This can be translated \"Creoles\"; but that is a little bit misleading. Creoles in French colonies could be of mixed blood, but in Spanish America those would be mestizos, not criollos. Mestizos were then a major cut in social status below both the peninsulas and criollos -- although intermarriage was approved in 1514, the rights of mestizos were officially curtailed in 1549 and 1576. Below them all, of course, were pure Indians and African slaves. Mixed marriages with Africans produced mulatos (from mulo, \"mule\"), a word simply borrowed into English with the same sense (\"mulattoes\"). Runaway slaves became cimarrones.\n\nNew Spain included all Spanish America north of Panama, but it broke up when Mexico became independent. That began with the revolt of Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla in 1810. Independence was achieved by Augustín de Itúrbide in 1821. Itúrbide ruled as Emperor for a couple of years and then was overthrown. A Republic was declared in 1824, although its history would be marked by several episodes of dictatorship.\n\nAt independence, the population of New Spain was 1,230,000 peninsulars and creoles, 1,860,000 mestizos, and 3,700,00 Indians.\n\nMexico, with one of the wealthiest and largest economies in Latin American, with reasonable (but not great) growth and economic freedom, nevertheless must endure comparisons, with only 25% of income purchasing power parity, with its gigantic neighbor, the United States. Those benefiting the least from Mexico's economy often cross the border, illegally, into the United States. While many political interests in the United States favor this immigration, rendering the major parties both unable to really do anything about it, either to legalize or prevent it, a political preference for legality is rarely stated in the proper terms of free trade and free immigration.\n\nInstead the dynamic created is a grave danger to American politics. This is true for at least three reasons: (1) the Democratic Party wishes to maintain or legalize the illegal immigration to curry favor with a Hispanic ethnic constituency both to inflate the population of already Democratic electoral districts, giving them greater representation for smaller numbers of actual voters, or to actually steal elections through fraudulently registering illegal voters. The election laws are now loose enough that this is quite possible, and may have just occurred on a large scale in the election of the Governor of the State of Washington in 2004.\n\nSince Democratic policies are statist and socialist, ideas otherwise being discredited in American politics, this is all a dangerous tendency. (2) Hispanic immigrants have often been politicized in their own homelands, whether in Mexico or Central America, with leftist and communist indoctrination (Cubans, of course, are immune to this).\n\nViceroys of Perú Francisco Pizarrogovernor and\n\ncaptain general\n\nof Nueva Castilla,\n\n1533-1541 Diego de Almagro \"el mozo\"self-proclaimed\n\ngovernor,\n\n1541-1542 Cristóbal Vaca de Castrogovernor of Perú,\n\n1542-1544 Blasco Núñez de VelaViceroy,\n\n1544-1546 Government by the Audiencia,\n\nunder Diego Cepeda1544 Gonzalo Pizarronominated,\n\n1544-1548 Pedro de la GascaPresident,\n\nnominated,\n\n1546-1550 Government by the Audiencia1550-1551 Antonio de Mendoza1551-1552 Government by the Audiencia1552-1556 Andrés Hurtado de Mendoza\n\ny Fernández de Bobadilla,\n\nMarquis of Cañete1556-1561 Diego López de Zúñiga y Velasco,\n\nCount of Nieva1561-1564 Government by the Audiencia1564 Lope García de Castrointerim,\n\n1564-1569 Francisco de Toledo1569-1581 Martín Enríquez de Almansa1581-1583 Government by the Audiencia1583-1585 Fernando Torres Portugal y Mesía,\n\nCount of Villa don Pardo1585-1590 Andrés García Hurtado\n\nde Mendoza y Manrique,\n\nMarquis of Cañete1590-1596 Luis de Velasco1596-1604 Gaspar de Zúñiga Acevedo y Fonseca,\n\nCount of Monterrey1604-1606 Government by the Audiencia1606-1607 Juan Manuel de Mendoza y Luna,\n\nMarquis of Montes Claros1607-1615 Francisco de Borja y Aragón,\n\nCount of Mayalde y de Ficalho1615-1621 Government by the Audiencia,\n\nunder Juan Jiménez de Montalvo1621-1622 Diego Fern ndez de Córdoba\n\ny Melgarejo de las Roelas,\n\nMarquis of Guadalcázar1622-1629 Luis Fernández de Cabrera\n\nBobadilla de la Cerda,\n\nCount of Chinchón1629-1639 Pedro de Toledo y Leyva,\n\nMarquis of Mancera1639-1648 García Sarmiento de Sotomayor\n\ny Enríquez de Luna,\n\nCount of Salvatierra1648-1655 Luis Enríquez de Guzmán,\n\nCount of Alba de Liste, Grande de España1655-1661 Diego de Benavides y de la Cueva,\n\nCount of Santiesteban del Puerto1661-1666 Government by the Audiencia,\n\nunder Bernardo Iturrizarra1666-1667 Pedro Antonio Fernández\n\nde Castro Andrade y Portugal,\n\nDuke of Taurizano1667-1672 Government by the Audiencia1672-1674 Baltasar de la Cueva y Enríquez1674-1678 Melchor de Liñán y Cisnerosinterim,\n\n1678-1681 Melchor de Navarra y Rocafull,\n\nDuke of la Palata1681-1689 Melchor Portocarrero Lasso de la Vega,\n\nCount of la Monclova1689-1705 Government by the Audiencia1705-1707 Manuel de Sentmenat-Oms\n\nde Santa Pau,\n\nMarquis of Castell-Dos-Rius1707-1710 Government by the Audiencia1710 Diego Ladrón de Guevarainterim,\n\n1710-1716 Government by the Audiencia1716 Diego Morcillo y Rubio de Auñóninterim, 1716;\n\n1720-1724 Carmine Nicola Caracciolo,\n\nPrince of Santo Buono1716-1720 José de Armendáriz,\n\nMarquis of Castelfuerte1724-1736 José Antonio de Mendoza\n\nCaamaño y Sotomayor,\n\nMarquis of Villagarcía1736-1745 José Antonio Manso de Velasco\n\ny Sánchez Samaniego,\n\nCount of Superunda1745-1761 Felipe Manuel Cayetano Amat\n\ny Junyent Planella y Vergós1761-1776 Manuel de Guiror y Portal de Huarte,\n\nCount of Guiror1776-1780 Agustín de Jáuregui y Aldecoainterim,\n\n1780-1784 Francisco Teodoro de Croix,\n\nCount of Croix1784-1790 Francisco Gil de Taboada\n\nLemos y Villamarín1790-1796 Ambrosio O'Higgins,\n\nMarquis of Osorno1796-1801 Gabriel de Avilés y del Fierro,\n\nMarquis of Avilés1801-1806 José Fernando de Abascal y Sousa,\n\nMarquis of la Concordia1806-1816 Joaquín de la Pezuela Griñán\n\ny Sánchez Muñoz de Velasco,\n\nMarquis of Viluma1816-1821 José de la Serna y Martínez de Hinojosa1821-1824 Independence of Chile, 1818;\n\nIndependence of Peru, 1820-1824 the Presidents and dictators of Peru should continue here, but there are just too many of them, with many overthrown in less than a year. What it was like can be seen in the lists for Mexico, Venezuela, and Argentina.\n\nLegal or illegal, if they become politically active, they thus tend to be drawn to movements of the most leftist and anti-American cast. And (3) no movement is more dangerous for them or America than a simple Mexican nationalism which wants to take over the Southwestern States and perhaps reunite them with Mexico.\n\nWhy anyone would flee the poverty and corruption of Mexico and then want to turn their refuge into Mexico is perplexing, but then the people involved in such a movement exhibit irrationality to high degree -- not to mention a lunatic fringe leftism that passes over into the kind of fascism and racism that, as leftists, they love to accuse their opponents (i.e. mainstream American politicians and citizens) of practicing. In the contemporary world, when the lunatic fringe left has allied itself with Islamic terrorism, this is a dangerous development indeed. Although their rhetoric is emerging in Democratic Party politics, what such people and their allies really want is violence, war, and slaughter, i.e. Marxist revolution -- nothing short of that, indeed, is liable to detach the Southwest from the United States. There is little that is honest or revealing said about this in American politics or the news media.\n\nThese lists of Viceroys, with some other governors of Spanish America, were sent to me by Daniel Ruiz-Castillo Galán. I have reproduced the Viceroys of the four Viceroyalties and the Governors of Cuba (since they start early and last all the way to 1898). Mr. Ruiz-Castillo Galán lists his sources as Crónica de América, Guillem Burrel y Floriá (director) [Plaza & Janés Editores, SA (1990), Barcelona, pp. 702-717] and Los virreyes españoles en América; Relación de virreinatos y biografía de los virreyes españoles en América, José Montoro [Editorial Mitre, SA (?), Barcelona]. I have left out some detail from Mr. Ruiz-Castillo Galán's information, like Viceroys who declined the office or died before taking it up.\n\nSpanish Peru was established with the Conquest of the Incas by Francisco Pizarro. It initially consisted of all Spanish territories in South America, except for parts of Venezuela, which belonged to New Spain. Peru became a Viceroyalty (the second) in 1543. New Granada (1739) and the Río de la Plata (1776) were later detached from it.\n\nIndependence began when José de San Martín defeated the Spanish at the battle of Chacabuco in 1817. Chile then became independent under Bernardo O'Higgins in 1818. San Martín captured Lima in 1821. The Viceroy was finally defeated by Antonio José de Sucre at the battle of Ayacucho in 1824.\n\nAt independence, the population of Peru and Chile consisted of 465,000 persons of European blood (peninsulars and creoles), 853,000 mestizos, and 1,030,000 Indians.\n\nThe Economist of December 14th-20th 2002 reported that the economy of Peru had grown by 7.3% from a year earlier, with 1.5% inflation. This was the best economic performance in Latin America. If all that Peru did was follow the advice of their brilliant home grown economist, Hernando de Soto (cf. The Other Path, the Economic Answer to Terrorism, Basic Books, 1989), the future would have been secure. Of course, whether such advice would continue to be followed depended on other political factors. Chile had been on a similar track, but it only showed 1.8% growth, with 3.0% inflation, a performance not markedly superior to several other Latin American countries.\n\nIn 2003, The Economist of July 26th-August 1st now reports Peru with only 1.8% growth from a year ago, and 2.2% inflation. Things thus seem to have begun to go wrong, with even a revival of the Maoist terrorists of the Sendaro Luminoso, the \"Shining Path.\" I await Professor de Soto's report on what the problems have been. Meanwhile, Chile is reported to have 3.8% growth and 3.6% inflation, a more promising performance.\n\nViceroys of New Granada,\n\nNueva Granada Government by the Audiencia1550-1564 Antonio Díaz Venero

are Colombia, Venezuela, Panama, and Ecuador. Simón Bolívar ended Spanish rule in 1823, and a Republic of Gran Colombia was established. Venezuela and Ecuador separated in 1830. Panama became independent in 1903 with the help of the United States, and at the price of ceding the Canal Zone for the United States to build and run the Panama Canal, which was opened in 1914.\n\nThe population at independence of Colombia and Venezuela was 642,000 peninsulars and creoles, 1,256,000 mestizos, and 720,000 Indians.\n\nThe Economist of December 14th-20th 2002 reported that the economy of Venezuela had shrunk by 5.5% from a year earlier, with 30.7% inflation. This was pretty bad, and was the characteristic effect of the actions of the Castroite President Hugo Chávez. At the time, as it happened, the opposition, which had tried overthrowing Chávez and, in lieu of a coup, had been calling for early elections, had been trying to maintain a general strike with constant demonstrations. It remained to be seen how this was all going to play out.\n\nIn 2003, The Economist of July 26th-August 1st, reported that the Venezuelan economy shrank by 29% from the previous year, with 34.2% inflation. Chávez has ridden out the general strike and has begun to assassinate opponents. A Castroite Venezuela will have more money, from oil revenues, to favor the politically reliable than Cuba does; but Chávez is also apparently appointing politically reliable people to run the oil industry, and they don't know what they are doing. Thus, oil production is down, and since Chávez is favoring Cuba with some of the production, the pie is going to get smaller and smaller for the impoverished Venezuelans who foolishly provide Chávez with such mass support as he commands. Where things are headed is indicated by the waves of worshipful political pilgrims from the diehard anti-globalization Left who are beginning to journey thither (making Venezuela the \"new Nicaragua\"). Perhaps South Americans should be warned that such people worship the virtuous poverty (\"ecotopia\") achieved by Castro in Cuba. Do Venezuelans really want prostitution to be one of their principal cash industries, as in Cuba?\n\nBy 2005, the Venezuelan economy has rebounded, but inflation remains very high and Chávez's love affair with Castro continues. This particular tragedy thus may take some time yet to resolve itself.\n\nViceroys of the Río de la Plata Pedro de Mendozacaptain general,\n\n1534-1537 Juan de Ayolas 1537-1539 Domingo Martínez de Irala1539-1541,\n\n1544-1556 Alvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca1541-1544 Gonzalo de Mendoza1556-1558 Francisco Ortiz de Vergara1558-1569 Juan Ortiz de Zárate1569-1576 Juan de GarayDeputy,\n\n1576-1587?

There may not be a lot of Jews in Venezuela, but they are being harassed, verbally and legally. The Anti-Semitism of Islamic Fascism was already obvious, but Chávez seems to have decided that it is all of a piece with the international anti-imperialist (i.e. anti-American) movement. Meanwhile, a Chávez protégé, Evo Morales, leader of a coca growers union, has been elected President of Boliva. It is hard not to smile at his intention to protect coca, the source of cocaine, from the eradication that drug warriors desire. This will get their goat. On the other hand, his muddled leftism -- he praised Che and denounced \"neo-liberalism\" in his inaugural address -- may produce many years of pointless misery for Bolivia.\n\nThus, it is noteworthy that the impotent ideologues of American universities, who give legitimacy to this kind of thing, cause real harm in the world, however meaningless (or not, unfortunately) their rants in the United States itself.\n\nAs of 2013, Chávez managed to survive politically, at great cost to Venezuela, but the Fates have had different ideas. It then appeared that the man would die of cancer. For a while, it looked like he had beaten it, thanks to Spanish doctors flown into Cuba, but all the might of Cuban medicine has apparently availed him not. What will come of Venezuela in the aftermath was anyone's guess.\n\nThe high drama and tragedy of the Chávez regime also had its farcical moments. The Venezuelan actress, María Conchita Alonso (b.1957), was an outspoken critic of Chávez and has vainly tried to alert Americans to the program of the Democrats in taking the United States down the same socialist and fascist road. In December 2011, she encountered actor Sean Penn at Los Angeles International Airport. Penn, a faithful Red Diaper Baby, has disgraced himself with public support and friendship for Chávez. Penn's roots and preference became clear when he said that critics should not be allowed to tell \"lies\" about Chávez. Uncle Joe Stalin would have been proud. Alonso told Penn that he was a communist, and he responded that she was a \"pig.\" Perhaps he was flustered and forgot that the expression is \"capitalist running dog.\"\n\nThe chosen successor of Chávez, Nicolás Maduro, continued to ruin the economy and steal elections. Millions have now fled the country, and those remaining have slowly starved, after eating all the pets and zoo animals in the country -- and as the government prevents humanitarian food shipments from entering the country. The murder rate is one of the highest in the world, which we expect in a regime (like San Francisco) where political crimes are more important than actual crime. But Madura has bought off the army, which has been purged and controlled with help from Cuba. Indeed, a film crew from an American Spanish language network, not in the least sympathetic to the United States in most respects, was briefly arrested by Maduro and, after returning to the States, reported that everyone around him spoke with Cuba accents -- not something that most other reporters on American television are liable to notice.\n\nDemonstrations and sanctions against Maduro, and most nations recognizing an opposition leader (a socialist himself) as the legitimate interim-president, have failed to oust him. A brief hope that the army would depose him has now faded.\n\nMeanwhile, we need to keep a list of the useful idiot \"celebrities\" who continue to support the regime. I have noted Sean Penn, one of the worst. But of equally durable disgrace is Danny Glover. When the staff was ejected from the Venezuelan embassy in Washington, some sympathizing Sandinista supporters took over, surrounded by actual Venezuelan exile protestors. Jesse Jackson took food into the embassy, claiming that the protestors wanted to \"starve out\" the Sandinistas. So why did they let him in? Equally shameful in support of Maduro have been Jamie Foxx, Lukas Haas, Oliver Stone, and, of course, the execrable Michael Moore. \"Democratic socialist\" (i.e. communist) Presidential Candidate Bernie Sanders, who had previously said that the \"American Dream\" was more likely to be realized in Venezuela than in the United States, has pulled back on his support for Maduro, but he neither calls him a \"dictator\" nor supports his overthrow. The regime is officially supported by Cuba, Russia, China, Iran, and, sadly, Pope Francis -- adding to the accumulating evident of his poor judgment and twisted values. John Paul II must be rolling over in his tomb, over the company Francis now keeps.\n\nThe Río de la Plata, previously part of Peru, was made a separate Viceroyalty in 1776 -- the last of the Viceroyalties to be created. The Viceroyalty came under local control in 1810, under General Manuel Belgrano. In 1816, he declared complete independence. Paraguay had already broken away in 1814. Subsequently, Bolivia seceded in 1825 and Uruguay in 1828. Paraguay lost considerable territory to Argentina and Brazil in the War of the Tripple Alliance, 1865-1870, which killed something like half its population.\n\nThe population at independence of the Río de la Plata was 320,000 peninsulars and creoles, 742,000 mestizos, and 1,200,000 Indians. Later, in Argentina the local Indians were virtually exterminated. With the Indians gone and a large European immigrant population, Argentina for long seemed hardly like a South American country at all, and it was widely expected to compete economically with European countries. These expectations went very bad under the dictatorship of Juan Perón (1945-1955 and 1973-1974). Fascist politics and socialist economics spelled the end of both political freedom and economic growth. Perón was overthrown in 1955, but what Argentina had lost was simply never made good. Perón's return in 1973 was a bit of desperate nostalgia. Meanwhile, the rot of leftist politics provoked responses of military dictatorship and repression even in what had hitherto been the model democracy of Uraguay. In 2002, with the Argentine economy collapsing again, many descendants of the European immigrants were beginning to plan to return to their ancestral Italy, etc.\n\nWhat went wrong with the Argentine economy is of serious interest. When the Argentine currency was pegged to the dollar, this was regarded as evidence of serious liberalization and responsibility in the economy. Unfortunately, such a policy means that the country loses control over inflation and deflation, since the money supply can only be manipulated to maintain the peg, not to maintain price stablity. At the same time, no control was exercised over public spending, which requires inflationary money creation, even as the central bank must withdraw money to maintain the peg. These contradictory pressures could not be juggled indefinitely, but the response of the government simply made things worse, by prohibiting bank withdrawls and such measures as to destroy the value of savings and of any confidence that people might have had in the economic system. With a Castroite radical now as President of Venezuela, a similarly radical leftist (at least in rhetoric) in Brazil, and the pseudo- \"liberalization\" discredited in Argentina, it looks like we may be headed for more miserable experiments in socialism and dictatorship in South America.\n\nThe Economist of December 14th-20th 2002 reported that the Argentine economy had shrunk by 13.6% from a year earlier, with 40.5% inflation. Pretty bad. Now in 2003, however, The Economist of July 26th-August 1st, reports that the economy has grown by 5.1% from a year ago, with 10.2% inflation. This looks much better, and 5.1% growth is excellent for the area, or for anywhere. This is encouraging, but I understand that the institutional arrangements are still adverse to entrepreneurs. Nevertheless, this is better news than from the continuing train wreck in Venezuela.\n\nAs of 2013, the President of Argentina, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, riding the tide of anti-liberal fascism that has been plaguing even the United States, has been nationalizing companies and otherwise thumbing her nose at the European and other creditors that have been keeping the Argentine economy afloat. The economic doldrums of the American and much of the European economy, leaves Argentine, like the Southern tier of Europe (from Spain to Greece), in yet worse shape. It is a time when elites seem to have learned only stupidity from the examples of history. Certainly, Say's Law might as well be a kind of Occult Scripture, known only to some hidden ranks of unfortunately ineffective Illuminati.\n\nThe election of the Argentine Jorge Mario Bergoglio as Pope Francis I in 2013 was a matter of considerable interest. However, Francis seems to have absorbed and retained all the evil anti-capitalist and fascist ideas of Peronism, which he has been expressing freely, to the delight of the enemies of freedom worldwide. While Francis thinks that these ideas are for the benefit of the poor, he apparently has been paying no attention to their actual effects in Argentina. But ignoring outcomes and clinging to exploded but fanatical ideology is characteristic of the modern political Left.\n\nIn 2023 the majority of the people of Argentina seems to have finally had enough. They went way off the rails and elected a self-professed anarcho-capitalist libertarian, Javier Milei. He has not been a politician but has been a public showman for quite a while, waving an anarcho-capitalist flag, explaining that the yellow part is for gold, since such libertarians are gold bugs and don't believe in paper currency. Milei's proposal for Argentina's inflation, however, is to adopt the U.S. dollar, which I suppose may be the next best thing to gold, despite America's own inflation problem.\n\nMilei is the first person like this ever to be elected to a significant national office, as far as I can tell, anywhere in the world. Argentina certainly needs radical therapy. Whether Milei can really deliver is a good question. He may turn out just to be a crackpot, with no idea how to run a government. Indeed, he doesn't believe in government. So we must hope he has some kind of pragmatic streak that can adapt to the circumstances that face him.\n\nAnother positive for Milei is that he is openly pro-Israel, at a time when there is a need for it, in the face of all the Neo-Nazi ideology that has exploded after the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Terrorists from Gaza. All the anti-Semitism that we have seen building at Amerian univeristies for years, cultivated by the Post-Modern Left, is now exposed to the public, especially in disruptive demonstrations, vandalism, and violence. This is not surprising. When \"Pro-Palestinian\" Left condemns Israel as a \"colonialist settler state,\" anyone familiar with the ideology knows that the supreme \"colonialist settler state,\" the \"Great Satan\" to Israel's \"Little Satan,\" is the United States.

Ross, Ph.D. All Rights Reserved\n\nThe Pillars of Hercules\n\nThe arms of Spain, which have sometimes appeared on the flag of Spain, are supported by pillars on each side, the left one wrapped in a banner inscribed \"PLVS,\" the right one wrapped in a banner inscribed \"VLTRA.\"\n\nThese represent the \"Pillars of Hercules,\" the mountains that the Greeks thought of as flanking the Strait of Gibraltar (Latin Fretum Herculeum, \"Herculean Strait\"). The mountain on the north side was called Κάλπη, Kálpê (Latin Calpe), on the south side Ἀβύλη, Abýlê (Latin Abyla). The idea was that these were originally either adjacent or connected by a ridge, closing the Mediterranean from the Atlantic. Hercules either pushed the mountains apart or broke through the ridge, opening the Strait. The Phoenicians certainly got to the Strait before the Greeks, and the story of a hero creating the channel may be a Phoenician one, with the god Melqart as the agent.\n\nGibraltar captured from Spain by Anglo-Dutch force, 4 August 1704 Governors of Gilbraltar,\n\nheld for Archduke Charles Sir George Rooke1704 Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt1704 Henry Nugent, Count of Valdesoto1704 John Shrimpton1704-1707 Roger Elliott1707-1711 Thomas Stanwix1711-1713 Ceded to Britain, 1713 Thomas Stanwix1713 The Earl of Portmore1713-1720 Richard Kane1720-1727 Jasper Clayton1727-1730 Joseph Sabine1730-1739 Francis Columbine1739-1740 William Hargrave1740-1749 Humphrey Bland1749-1754 Thomas Fowke1754-1756 Lord Tyrawley1756-1757 The Earl of Home1757-1761 John Tooveyacting, 1761 John Parslowacting, 1761 Edward Cornwallis1761-1776 John Irwinacting, 1765-1767 Robert Boydacting, 1776-1777 George Augustus Eliott1777-1787 Lord Heathfield1787-1790 Sir Robert Boydacting, 1790 1790-1794 Henry Clinton17941795 Charles Rainsford1794-1795 Charles O'Hara1795-1802 Charles Barnett1802 The Duke of Kent1802-1820 Sir Thomas Triggeacting, 1803-1804 Henry Edward Foxacting, 1804-1806 James Drummondacting, 1806 Sir Hew Dalrympleacting, 1806-1808 James Drummondacting, 1808-1809 Sir John Francis Cradockacting, 1809 John Smithacting, 1809 Alex McKenzie Fraseracting, 1809 Colin Campbellacting, 1809-1814 Sir George Donacting, 1814-1821 The Earl of Chatham1820-1835 Sir George Donacting, 1825-1830 Crown Colony Sir George Donacting, 1830-1831 Sir William Houstonacting, 1831-1835 Sir Alexander Woodford1835-1842 Sir Robert Thomas Wilson1842-1848 Sir Robert William Gardiner1848-1855 Sir James Fergusson1855-1859 Sir William Codrington1859-1865 Sir Richard Airey1865-1870 Sir William Williams1870-1876 Lord Napier of Magdala1876-1883 Sir John Miller Adye1883-1886 Sir Arthur Hardinge1886-1890 Sir Leicester Smyth1890-1891 H.R.L.

The tectonic plates of Europe and Africa have pushed up against each other and pulled apart at different geological times. When they have pushed together, the Mediterranean basin, which geologically as well as geographically separates the continents, i.e. it is oceanic crust, has become separated from the oceans and has even dried up into a salt desert. The salt deposits are still at the bottom of the Sea. When the plates pulled apart, the crust thinned and the connecting ridge at Gibraltar dropped. At some point, the Atlantic found a way to break through, filling up the Mediterrean basin in a great waterfall that could have lasted for a century. This happened more than once and must have been among the more spectacular events of geological history.\n\nI had always assumed that the famous view of the Rock as shown in this painting was from the South-East, approaching the Strait. However, it is actually from the North, coming down the coast. This is also evident in the photograph below.\n\nMount Calpe (which I've also seen called \"Capi\") is certainly to be identified with the Rock of Gibraltar, which is a limestone mass, 1408 feet high, covering about two square miles. It is a feature of considerable majesty, presenting both a symbol and the substance of great strength. Gibraltar gets its modern name as a result of the Islâmic Conquest of Spain. The forces of the Omayyad Caliph al-Wâlid, commanded by Ṭâriq ibn Ziyâd, landed in 711 at the mountain that henceforce was known by the commander's name, the , Jabal Ṭâriq, \"Mountain of Ṭâriq.\" Gibraltar is today a British possession.\n\nThe Rock was captured by British and Dutch forces, under the command of Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt, on 4 August 1704, during the War of the Spanish Succession. Until the end of the War, it was held in the name of the Archduke Charles, the Pretender to Spain, who in 1711 became the Emperor Charles VI -- which is why Prince George was in command and is listed as one of the first Governors of Gibraltar. Once Charles was Emperor, however, even his allies did not want to see him unite the thrones of Spain and Austria, as Charles V had done. Britain reconsidered its war aims and, with some duplicity, made a separate Peace with France and Spain. Under the terms of this Treaty of Utrecht in 1713, Gibraltar was ceded to Britain in perpetuity.\n\nOne of the British admirals leading the capture of Gibraltar had the extraordinary name of \"Clowdisley Shovell.\" Shovell did not live to see the end of the war. On October 22, 1707 (on the Julian calendar), Shovell's fleet ran aground in the fog on the Scilly Islands. Four of five ships were lost. A story is told that Shovell himself was one of only two men from the four ships who reached shore alive, but he was then murdered by a local woman, combing the beach, who wanted his ring. This supposedly became known in a deathbed confession years later, when the woman produced the ring as evidence. There is reason, however, to doubt this story, since the ring never did reappear. There is also a story that right before the disaster Shovell had a sailor hanged who breached discipline by daring to suggest that the navigators had made a mistake about their location and that the fleet was in danger of grounding in the Scillies! However, there is apparently no contemporary evidence for this story, which appeared later in suspiciously different versions.\n\nI do know that there is a pub called \"The Ship and Shovell\" near Charing Cross Station in London (1-3 Craven Passage, Charing Cross, WC2N 5PH). I have eaten lunch there.\n\nGibraltar was besieged by Spain from 1779 to 1783, during the American Revolutionary War, but it held out. This is now called the \"Great Siege,\" reminiscent of the Great Sieges of Malta, one of which also had the British defending. At this time galleries were excavated in the Rock so that guns could be placed at elevation firing north to the Spanish lines. This was done successfully and now the \"Great Siege Tunnels\" are a tourist attraction. Below we see \"The Siege and Relief of Gibraltar, 13 September 1782,\" by John Singleton Copley (1738-1815).\n\nThe last great strategic role of Gibraltar was in World War II, when the Strait was guarded with increasing effectiveness against the transit of German submarines. We see a fictionalized example of this in the 1981 mo"
