While in 1721 the Spaniards were celebrating the bi-centennial of the occupation of the capital, the mountain tribes of Nayarit were being subjugated, and a quarter of a century later those of Nuevo Leon, Sierra Gorda, and Tamaulipas were destined, as we have seen, to meet the same fate.\n\nOn October 15, 1722, Juan de Acuña, marqués de Casafuerte, the successor of Valero, arrived in Mexico as thirty-seventh viceroy of New Spain. He is said to have been one of the best of all the representatives of royalty, being remembered in the history of the country as the 'great governor.'[1] During his ​administration Casafuerte wrought a marked change in the various branches of the public service, and labored zealously, and not in vain, to purify a venal court. Many of the former rulers had done much to benefit the country by establishing new colonies, and encouraging commerce and the development of the mining and agricultural interests. It must be acknowledged, however, that few of them were proof against the temptations of the age, and that directly or indirectly they countenanced the shameful abuse of selling public offices to the highest bidder. When Casafuerte took charge, he at once abolished this practice. No presents were received, no favors shown; none of his household or subordinates dared to meddle in the question of appointments, or to intercede for office-seekers. Wholesome reforms were introduced and maintained during his long rule, while merit alone was the passport to preferment.\n\nIn the matter of public improvements the marquis was equally active. The building of a new mint was begun in 1731, and finished in 1734, at a cost of four hundred and fifty thousand pesos;[2] in 1733 the plaza de Acapulco was renovated, the San Cristóbal causeway having been reconstructed the previous year. The grand aqueduct which supplies the city of Querétaro with water was begun in 1726 and finished in 1738.[3] Improvements were also made in the various presidios throughout the country under Pedro de Rivera, who made a four years' tour of inspection by order of the viceroy, and a cannon foundry was established at Orizaba, the guns being used to strengthen the coast defences.\n\n​The administration of Casafuerte was not marked by any internal disturbances; nor were the provinces harassed by the depredations of pirates which wrought so much mischief during the rule of his predecessors. Commerce still suffered to some extent on the North Sea, but corsairs had been driven from the waters of the Pacific, and trading vessels passed to and fro between New Spain and the East Indies without fear of being molested.\n\nThe marquis was beloved by the people, and the only enemies he had were dissatisfied office-seekers. These prevailed upon the king's council to recommend his removal on account of his great age, and his long tenure of office, which was inconsistent with general usage. When this was done Felipe signified his confidence in his representative by merely replying: \"As long as Casafuerte lives his talents and virtues give him all the strength necessary for a good governor.\" Soon afterward, however, in 1734, the marquis died, at the age of seventy-seven. His funeral ceremonies were described in detail in the Gazette then published by Sahagun. Since that time they have served as a model on similar occasions, and resemble those which at the present day are observed on the demise of a president of the Mexican republic.[4]\n\nWhen the carta de mortaja, was opened by the audiencia it was found that the archbishop of Mexico, Juan Antonio de Vizarron y Eguiarreta, was designated to fill the vacancy.[5] Vizarron was appointed to the primacy January 13, 1730, and arrived in ​the capital on December 20th of the same year. He was consecrated by the bishop of Puebla Lardizábal y Elorza, assisted by the bishops of Yucatan and Caracas, who were on a visit to Mexico at the time, and took charge of the ecclesiastical government on the 21st of May 1731, receiving the pallium on the 13th of January 1732.[6] The pastoral administration of the archbishop, which lasted sixteen years, was one of the most peaceful and prosperous recorded in the annals of the Mexican church; and concerning his reign as viceroy, it may be said that he was in every way a worthy successor to Casafuerte; he sent more treasure to Spain than any previous viceroy, without oppressing the people, draining the country of the precious metals, or diminishing the amount usually held in reserve at Mexico.\n\nThough near the close of his administration war was again declared between Spain and England; New Spain remained undisturbed by foreign aggression; on the other hand, we have to record for this period some internal troubles and calamities. The negro and other slaves of the town and vicinity of Córdoba had long meditated revolt, when in 1735 a rumor was circulated by a mulatto that all slaves had been declared free by the king, and that they were now unlawfully kept in bondage by the Spaniards. A general uprising followed in the month of June; and though some of the more timid remained with their masters, the majority, being supplied in secret with arms of every description, gathered and fortified themselves on the hacienda called Omealca, protected by the Rio Blanco and the mountains. The militia of Vera Cruz, ​Orizaba, and the neighboring towns were called out, and a formal campaign opened. A force of six hundred Spaniards attacked the insurgents, who were routed after a stubborn resistance. The ringleaders were executed, and others who were captured were subjected to cruel tortures. Those who escaped fled to the mountains; but hunger caused most of them to return, while a few preferred death from starvation to the fate of their companions.[7]\n\nDuring the greater part of the following year violent storms prevailed, and in the month of August the epidemic called matlazahuatl made its appearance in Tacuba, and spread with rapidity over the whole country.[8] This terrible disease was similar to that of 1576, which carried off some two millions of natives.[9]\n\nAfter being relieved from office as viceroy, Vizarron remained in charge of the primacy until the day of his death,[10] and was succeeded in 1749 by archbishop Dr Manuel Joseph Rubio y Salinas, who presided over the affairs of the church no less ably than had his predecessor.[11] He died, after a successful ​administration of sixteen years, at the age of sixty-two.\n\nThe thirty-ninth viceroy, Pedro de Castro y Figueroa Salazar, duque de la Conquista y marqués de Gracia Real, took charge of the government of New Spain August 17, 1740. He had taken passage in a Dutch ship in order to elude the English war vessels which were then cruising in the North Sea, but being pursued near Portobello was obliged to make his escape in a small swift craft which had served as escort. His baggage and papers were left behind, but he was nevertheless acknowledged as viceroy without credentials.[12] During his brief reign of a single year, he gave indications of being a good ruler, though he found the country in a less favorable condition than his predecessors. The French had retired from the extreme northern provinces of New Spain, but the English, under Oglethorpe, bombarded San Agustin, in Florida; while Admiral Vernon who had captured Portobello and destroyed the castle of San Lorenzo at the mouth of the Chagre, threatened Ulúa and Vera Cruz.\n\nThe duke ordered that the razed batteries of Guadalupe and San Miguel should be reconstructed, and an adequate force raised for the protection of the gulf coast. Soon afterward he repaired to Vera Cruz for the purpose of adopting measures for defence, but a short time after his arrival at that port he was stricken ​down with a severe illness, causing his immediate return to Mexico, where he died, August 22, 1741.[13] His successor, Pedro Cebrian y Agustin, condede Fuenclara, the fortieth viceroy, and the last who in those days enjoyed the dignity of grandee of New Spain, assumed office November 3, 1742.\n\nAt this time the Spanish provinces were kept in a state of constant alarm by the operations of Anson and Vernon, which have already been briefly related.[14] After scouring the Pacific coast of South America, Anson arrived off Acapulco in February 1742, with forces greatly reduced by sickness, and failing to receive the coöperation of Vernon, resolved not to make any attempt on the mainland. Hearing that he had narrowly missed intercepting a treasure-ship named the Covadonga, which had sailed safely into Acapulco a short time before, he cruised off that port for three months in the hope of capturing this prize. In the ordinary course of things the Covadonga should have left Acapulco in March, but on account of Anson's presence the authorities thought it best to detain her until the following year. Thereupon the British admiral set sail in disgust for China; and, having burned one of his two vessels and refitted the other near Macao, put off to await the arrival of the two galleons which he expected would reach the Philippines in May 1743. On the 20th of this month he arrived in his remaining vessel, the Centurion, a frigate of sixty guns, and with a very slender ship's company, at cape ​Espíritu Santo, off the island of Samal. Here were erected signal stations for the purpose of warning Spanish galleons to beware of enemies who might be cruising about in neighboring waters. The Covadonga soon made her appearance, and when Anson's ship was sighted, bore down upon her to give battle.\n\nThough not a war vessel, the Covadonga was well armed and manned, having thirty-six large guns, twenty-eight howitzers, and five hundred and fifty men, a number greatly in excess of the Centurion’s crew. But these advantages were counterbalanced by the lightness of the British frigate, and the greater efficiency of her men. For two hours the conflict lasted. Though outmatched in seamanship the Spaniards showed no lack of courage. The galleon's rigging caught fire; her pennant was shot away; her commander was wounded, sixty-seven of her crew were killed, and a greater number wounded, before her colors were struck, while the loss of the British was but one man killed and seventeen wounded. Taking possession of his prize, Anson found on board treasure amounting to nearly a million and a half in coin, and about forty thousand five hundred marks in silver bullion.[15]\n\nWhen the news of this disaster reached Mexico, it created much dissatisfaction among the parties interested, who laid the blame on the authorities. Moreover, the war which was then raging in Europe caused great scarcity of merchandise and high prices throughout New Spain.\n\nA remarkable instance of Spanish jealousy toward foreigners, and of the strictness with which the laws in that respect were enforced, occurred at the beginning of Fuenclara's rule. Before the arrival of the viceroy, an Italian gentleman, Lorenzo Boturini, appeared in Mexico provided with a papal bull ​authorizing him to make collections for the purpose of providing a costly crown for the virgin of Guadalupe. Upon leaving Spain, however, he had forgotten to procure the sanction of the India Council; nevertheless the audiencia, believing Boturini to be sincere in his intention, decided to issue to him a license and passport. Fuenclara, however, took matters more seriously. An investigation was instituted, Boturini was imprisoned, and his papers, forming an exceedingly valuable historical collection, were taken in charge by the authorities.[16] Although Boturini had acted in good faith, he was kept in confinement for a long time, until finally, not knowing what to do with him, the audiencia sent him to Spain. There he presented his case at court and was compensated by the position of royal chronicler with the salary of a thousand pesos, and the Mexican government was ordered to return his manuscripts. This, however, was never done, and the greater portion of them disappeared from the office of the viceroy's secretary. Thus the persecution of Boturini and his exile from New Spain were the cause of an irreparable loss to Mexican history, for which Fuenclara is directly answerable. As for the audiencia, the viceroy was ordered to convoke a secret session, and having done so, to administer a stern rebuke for their presumption in encroaching on the prerogatives of the council of the Indies.\n\nFuenclara was a peaceably inclined ruler and seems to have paid much more attention to the development of the country's resources. Apart from this there is little to record concerning his administration. Indeed this period of the history of New Spain is necessarily void of interest. The European wars were confined to the Old World, and the people of New Spain were ​content to supply the royal coffers with the necessary treasure, so long as they were comparatively free from the attacks of foreign powers. England considered it a much easier task to capture Spanish treasure ships on the ocean than to send expeditions to the mainland, where the deadly climate carried off her soldiers by hundreds. Nothing, therefore, impeded the progress of the provinces; agriculture and mining were developed; the population increased; new lands were occupied, so that in every direction the country became sprinkled with industrious settlers. New Spain had now arrived at the stage when the spirit of conquest disappears; and having outlived the period of early settlement, the people quietly and steadily pursued their course.\n\nIll-health finally induced Fuenclara to resign, though his salary had been raised to forty thousand pesos. The resignation was accepted by the king in 1745, and in the following year he was relieved[17] by Juan Francisco de Güemes y Horcasitas, conde de Revilla Gigedo, who assumed the reins of government as forty-first viceroy of New Spain. He was appointed while captain-general of Cuba, and assumed office July 9, 1746. The peaceable condition of the country favored the propensities of the new ruler, who had acquired a vast fortune by trading ventures, and throughout Europe was regarded as the richest vassal of his sovereign. His fortune increased enormously during his administration, and in the history of the viceroys he is noted mainly as a shrewd and successful speculator. He would pass by no commercial enterprise or profitable traffic, generally devoting thereto his personal attention, so that the viceregal palace was transformed into an exchange. Nevertheless he had some qualities which gained for him the ​respect of his subjects, and chief among them was his personal courage. It is related that when a revolutionary mob once gathered about his palace he rode in among them unattended by any guard, and by his commanding presence and stern rebuke caused the rioters to disperse. Although he devoted much of his time to his individual interests, it cannot be alleged that he neglected the affairs of state. It is even claimed that he augmented the resources of the country, and greatly increased the royal revenue. The generous protection extended to Escandon in the pacification of Nuevo Santander is also greatly in his favor.\n\nThe years 1749 and 1750 were sad ones for the inhabitants of New Spain. The crops were destroyed by unusual frosts in many provinces, occasioning a famine throughout the country, which in its turn was succeeded by an epidemic in the territory under the jurisdiction of the audiencia of Guadalajara. During the same period many and destructive earthquakes occurred, the centres of which seem to have been near the volcano of Colima. Many lives were lost and towns destroyed, though the city of Colima suffered but little.[18]\n\nFernando VI., who succeeded to his father Felipe V. on the decease of that monarch in August 1746, had certainly no reason to be dissatisfied with Revilla Gigedo's administration, for his constant demands for gold to replenish the empty coffers of the royal treasury were ever promptly complied with. But the count had now ruled for nine years, and he was rich enough. His resignation was accepted in 1755, on which date he returned to Spain.[19] He was succeeded ​by Agustin de Ahumada y Villalon, marqués de las Amarillas, who took charge of the government on the 10th of November in that year. The character of the marquis was in strong contrast with that of his predecessor in almost every respect. Indeed, they seemed to have only one trait in common, and that was loyalty to their sovereign. Amarillas was a soldier who had won fame in the Italian wars, and at once devoted himself to correcting the abuses that had crept in under the former administration. But soon after his arrival his health began to fail, and by the advice of physicians he resided for some time at Cuautitlan, and thence removed to the city of Cuernavaca. Not finding relief he returned to Mexico where he died February 5, 1760. While his predecessor was known as the wealthiest vassal of the king, it may be said of Amarillas that he was one of the poorest. Though his administration lasted more than four years, his honesty and generosity had been such that his widow was left in poverty, and became dependent on the archbishop Rubio y Salinas, who provided funds for her return to Spain.[20]"
