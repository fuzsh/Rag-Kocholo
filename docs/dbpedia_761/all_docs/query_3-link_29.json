        "text": "4. Description of the Survivors\n\nFollowing, in alphabetical order by their first surnames, is the information gathered about each of the survivors of the Florida expedition. Since Buckingham Smith's Narratives of the Career of Hernando de Soto in the Conquest of Florida, and Solar and Rújula's El adelantado Hernando de Soto are frequently cited, they have been abbreviated to Smith and SR respectively. These abbreviations are followed by a dash and a number which corresponds to the page in which the quotation is found. This expedient saves more than 300 notes.\n\nAcuña, Lope de. Son of Anton Ruiz de Contreras and Leonor de Acuña, citizens of Illescas, SR-327. Survivor from Illescas according to Smith-295. Acuña, however, declared in Mexico where he resided after Florida, that he was born in Toledo, which is near Illescas. He added that he had married Elvira de Hermosillo, one of the first eight female settlers of New Spain. [14]\n\nAgostin. From Castilla la Vieja, Smith-297.\n\nAgostin. From Vizcaya, Smith-298.\n\nAguilar, Gaspar de. From Castilla la Vieja, Smith-297.\n\nAguilar, Juan de. Son of Juan Gonzalez and Catalina Sanchez, citizens of Valencia de la Torre, SR-292. Since this Valencia is within the Extremadura region, it is probable that this man is the same Aguillar de Villanueva listed in Smith-293.\n\nAlgalin. Shoemaker from Sevilla, Smith-292.\n\nAlmendron. Brother of Father Pozo; survivor from Segura, Smith-294. There is one Alonso Hernández Almendro, son of Bartolome Hernández Almendro and Catalina Martin, citizens of Segura, SR-284.\n\nAlonso, Alvaro. Son of Juan Vazquez Perenton and Catalina Alvarez, citizen of Valverde in the lands of Badajoz, SR-282. Considering that this area is near Portugal, it seems likely that her people preferred to declare themselves as being Spanish in order to secure an unencumbered passage to the Indies. If so, this conqueror may be the same Alvaro Alfonso from Portugal, survivor of the expedition according to Smith-298.\n\nAlonso, Francisco. Son of Anton Alonso and Francisca Ruiz, citizens of Pedrosa, SR-330. This is likely the same Alonso from Sevilla, survivor listed in Smith-292.\n\nAlonso, Gonzalo. This survivor, from Jerez or Villanueva, Smith-293, may be either one of the following: a) the son of Alonso Garcia and Ines Gonzalez, citizens of Badajoz, SR-288, or b) the son of Gonzalo Gómez and Mari Nuñez, citizens of Usagre, SR-313.\n\nAlonso, Pedro. Son of Juan Macias and Elvira Garcia, citizens of Azauchal or Azanchal, SR-303. This seems to be the same Pedro Alonso del Azuchal from Zafra, Almendralejo or Segura, survivor listed in Smith-294.\n\nAlonso, Rodrigo. Son of Andres Caro and Ines Alonso, citizens of Badajoz, SR-283. The same man is listed as survivor in Smith-293.\n\nAlrianes, Martin. Survivor from Vizcaya, Smith-297.\n\nAlvañez. Survivor from Castilla la Vieja, Smith-296.\n\nAlvarado, Juan de. Son of Alonso Hernández de Diosdado and Isabel de Alvarado, citizens of Zafra, SR-329. Judging from the names of his parents, he is Luis de Moscoso's brother, referred to in Smith-294.\n\nAlvarez, Juan. Son of Alonso Yañez and Leonor Fernández, citizens of Badajoz, SR-316. This or the following person may be the survivor listed in Smith-298, as being from Portugal, the border of which is quite near Badajoz or Valverde.\n\nAlvarez, Juan. Son of Simon Alvarez and Maria Alvarez, citizens of Valverde, SR-282.\n\nAlvarez, Rodrigo. Son of Andres Vasquez and Leonor Rodriguez, citizens of Zafra, SR-307. This man seems to be the same Rodrigo from Jerez listed as a surviving brother of Alonso Vazquez in Smith-293. Zafra and Jerez are not more than twenty-five miles apart.\n\nAmarilla, Juan de. Son of Juan de Amarilla and Maria Gonzalez, citizens of Medellín, SR-304. Listed as survivor in Smith-295.\n\nAñasco, Juan de. Distinguished conqueror of Florida, born in Sevilla right at the beginning of the sixteenth century. The King named him contador of the army that would accompany de Soto in the exploration of Florida. By a royal cédula dated the fourth of May 1537, he was permitted to trade with the natives of that province as long as there were no duties on imports there. [15] With those two privileges Añasco embarked from Sevilla for Cuba where he remained for a while. Later, he was commissioned to take a caravelle to the coast of Florida to discover and select a good port and to bring back to Havana some natives that could later serve as guides to the Christians. Upon his successful completion of that mission, he embarked from Havana for Florida with two male slaves, one female, and many pigs. Añasco was quite active during the expedition, especially after it reached the land of Apalache. After the death of Commander de Soto, he managed to construct a compass from an old clock, which proved indispensable in finding the Pánuco River in Mexico. In the city of Puebla de los Angeles in that country, Añasco made his probanza in May 1544. [16] By this document, which in essence is a list of the services rendered by any individual to the Crown and usually made with the purpose of requesting a royal grant or favor, we learn the most about Anasco. The rest is taken from Anasco's own declarations found in two other documents. [17] In addition, Anasco is mentioned often by the chroniclers of the Florida expedition. Añasco continued from Puebla to Peru and after running the Guadalcanal mines for some time, he died. His wife Isabel de Anasco, later declared, in Peru, that her husband began serving his majesty in Italy and in Vienna, prior to rendering his services in the Indies. She added, too, that their son Juan de Cardenas y Añasco, served the King well in the Chilean wars. Smith-292 confirmed that Anasco was a survivor and native of Sevilla.\n\nAndirrela, Miguel de. Foreigner and survivor, Smith-299.\n\nAntonio. Survivor from Galicia, Smith-299.\n\nArevalo Brizeño, Pedro de. Son of Pedro de Arevalo and Ana Calderon; enlisted in the armada of de Soto in Sevilla, on February 15th 1538, SR-299. His name does not appear in the list of survivors made by Luis Hernandez de Biedma and transcribed by Buckingham Smith yet, judging by the following, he survived the expedition. Arevalo made his probanza in Peru between 1558 and 1559, stating that he sailed from Sevilla for Cuba with Hernando de Soto. From that island he accompanied the same and 650 men to Florida, of whom 350 survived. After de Soto's death, those still alive were guided to Mexico by the new governor, Luis de Moscoso. From that Viceroyalty he went to serve the King against the rebellious natives in Guatemala, where he fought until they came in peace to serve the Christians. Thereafter he went to Peru where he fought with viceroy Blasco Nuñez Vela against the rebel Gonzalo Pizarro. Sometime in 1560 the acting viceroy of Peru sent him to Spain after Arevalo was involved in a fight with another Spaniard. He was in Panama in 1562 and, one year later, he appeared before a court in Madrid, Spain. Arevalo's signature appears in some of the documents mentioned. [18]\n\nArgote, Alonso de. Son of Francisco Gonzalez de Argote and Florencia Morana, citizens of Astorga, SR-331. According to Smith-297 he survived the expedition and indeed he did, for he is found in Mexico in 1557 acting as a witness. There he declared he had been born more than 35 years previous in the city of Astorga, Spain. There he enrolled with de Soto and went to Cuba and Florida, serving in the latter for five years and particularly in the war against the natives of Mobila. Argote did not add much about his activities in Mexico and signed his declaration. [19]\n\nArias. Ailing man from Galicia who arrived in Pánuco, Smith-298.\n\nArias Davila, Gómez. This survivor is not listed by Hernandez de Biedma nor is there a record of his registering in Sevilla to sail to the Indies. He is, however, mentioned repeatedly by Garcilaso and at least once in Rangel's chronicle, described as being from Segovia. [20] According to his own account given in Lima, Peru, in 1561, he made the trip from Sevilla to Cuba and from there to Florida in the armada organized by de Soto. After nearly five years of hardship, he went with others to discover the sea and their way to New Spain. After Mexico he went to Peru where he witnessed some of the services rendered by Juan Cordero, another of de Soto's men. He signed his deposition adding, in the year 1561, that he was 47 years old. [21] Arias was to become one of the most successful men to survive the Florida expedition. After Mexico, he went to Nicaragua where he was selected by the royal Audiencia to lead the group of men it was sending to Peru to reinforce the Viceroy's troops that were to oppose Gonzalo Pizarro's uprising. For all the services he rendered to the crown, Arias was rewarded the right to collect tribute from the Chupacho Indians in Peru, and later, he became the governor of the Guánuco province. He married Maria Castellon y de Lara and had a son, Juan, who was born a few years before his death in 1563.\n\nArias de Canedo, Pedro. Another survivor not mentioned in the list of Hernandez de Biedma who may be the son of Diego Arias and Isabel Sedano, citizens of Astorga, SR-298. Arias made his probanza in Lima, Peru, in the year 1563 where he resided in the city of León de Guánuco. In that document he asserted he came to the Indies from Spain twenty-five years previous as part of the army brought by the Adelantado de Soto to conquer and explore Florida. After several years of hardship he and others left Florida for Mexico and, in 1544, he continued to Peru where he had lived since. In Peru he served the King, first against Gonzalo Pizarro's insurrections, and then against Sebastian de Castilla and Francisco Hernández Giron. After listing these and other services he rendered in Peru, he stated he was very much in need, married to Isabel de Garay, and with children to support. [22]\n\nAroca, Pedro de. Survivor from Vizcaya, Smith-297.\n\nAtanasio. Survivor from Badajoz according to Smith-293. Garcilaso de la Vega called him Hernando Atanasio and indicated Badajoz as his place of provenance. [23]\n\nAvedi, Juanes de. Survivor seaman from Vizcaya, according to Smith-297. Garcilaso mentioned a Juanes de Abadia who may be the same man.\n\nAzeituno, Antonio. Another survivor not mentioned in the list of Hernandez de Biedma. Twenty-four years after sailing from Sevilla to Florida via the island of Cuba, Azeituno was a resident of the city of Zamora in Peru where he declared he had been a member of the Florida expedition in which he spent five years. He signed his testimony in 1561 at 38 years of age. [24] According to SR-283, Aceituno was the son of Pedro de Aceituna and Lucia Lopez, citizens of Jaen.\n\nBacan. Survivor from Jerez, Smith-293.\n\nBaeza. There is one Baeza survivor from Castilla la Vieja, Smith-296. It seems probable that either of the following soldiers is that person, however, not from Castilla la Vieja: a) Bartolome de Baeza, son of Juan Ruiz of Baeza and Juana Martinez, citizens from Jaen which is near Baeza, SR-281; or b) Diego de Baeza, son of Juan de Aranda and Catalina Gómez, citizens of Pedroneras del Marquesado, SR-280.\n\nBautista. Brother of the one described below, who also survived Florida and was from Castilla la Vieja according to Smith-296. He was more likely from Castilla la Nueva as was his brother Juan, who follows.\n\nBautista, Juan. Son of Diego Alonso and Isabel de Castilla, citizens of Toledo, SR-291. This person may be the same survivor called Bautista, from Castilla la Vieja according to Smith-296. However, if Bautista is from Toledo, then he is from Castilla la Nueva.\n\nBernaldo. A caulker, survivor from Vizcaya, Smith-298. The passenger register in Sevilla states that he was a free colored servant of Captain Pedro Calderon and had presented proof of freedom before Iñigo Lopez, a public scribe and notary of Sevilla. [25] Part of this record is contained in SR-320.\n\nBlasco, Alonso. Survivor who was brother of Gonzalo Vasquez from Villanueva according to Smith-293. If so, he was the son of Gonzalo Vazquez and Catalina Vazquez, citizens of Villanueva de Barcarrota, SR-332.\n\nBolaños, Juan de. Son of Francisco Lozano and Elvira Cambran, citizens of Fuente el Maestre, SR-302. This may be the same Bolaños from Burguillos who survived the Florida expedition according to Smith-294. Both Fuente el Maestre and Burguillos are located some sixty miles south-east of Badajoz.\n\nBonifacio. Survivor from Valladolid, Smith-296.\n\nBotello, Alonso de. Son of Diego Gill and Isabel Votella, citizens of Villanueva de Barcarrota, SR-332. This Botello is likely the same Alonso Botellon from Villanueva, survivor according to Smith-293. Botello testified in New Spain that he had been in Florida with Hernando de Soto, that he was a son of Diego Gil and Isabel Botella, and that he was an hijodalgo married to a daughter of Diego Yañez. [26]\n\nBotello, Juan. Not listed by Hernández de Biedma, yet his existence appears well documented. In the year 1560 he was a witness to the probanza made by Alonso Vazquez in Jerez, Spain and declared that he was one of de Soto's soldiers, a citizen of Villanueva de Valcarrota (sic), and 47 or 48 years of age. He added that he was in the armada and on the same ship with Alonso Vazquez and that the Adelantado disembarked with his men at Santiago de Cuba and proceeded to Havana. In sum, they stayed on that island several months while readying the armada. After reaching Florida, Botello testified that Captain Juan Ruiz Lobilla placed thirty to forty men under Alonso Vazquez's command, later increased to eighty. He saw when Vazquez was struck in the ankle by an arrow during a battle with the natives at the savannah in Chicaza. Botello added that so great were the toils experienced in Florida that no man could find words to describe them nor memory to recite them. After so much hunger and fatigue, Juan Botello and others were able to reach the port of Pánuco and later the city of Mexico. He lived several years there and in 1550 declared that in the same city he had seen Luis de Moscoso, another of de Soto's men, living with the former's cousin. Botello was able to sign his testimony. [27] Previously, Botello had declared, in Sevilla on March 11, 1538, that he was a son of Rodrigo Botello and Marina Rodriguez, citizens of Villanueva de Barcarrota, SR-331.\n\nBravo, Luis. Son of Baltasar Bravo and Leónor Rodriguez, citizens of Badajoz, SR-277. This should be the same survivor listed in Smith-293 as the son of Baltasar Bravo from Badajoz.\n\nBustillo, Pedro de. Witness called to testify in lengthy lawsuit between Isabel de Bobadilla, widow of de Soto, and Hernando Ponce de León. [28] Bustillo declared in Sevilla, Spain in 1546, he had known de Soto from 1535 until his death in 1542, and that he was 35 years of age and from Valladolid. He knew about the de Soto expedition to Florida because he was part of it, having gone from Sevilla to Cuba with many others. From Havana he sailed in May, 1539, for Florida where he suffered much travail and shortages of food. He saw de Soto fall sick in May 1542, and witnessed his death in a port called Guachoya. Bustillo and the other survivors then decided to abandon Florida and arrived in Mexico in September, 1543. Bustillo signed his deposition. This conqueror should be the same Gutierre de Bustillo, son of Rodrigo Coaca and Maria Cavallos, citizens of Villasedil, a clear misspelling of Valladolid, SR-325. Hernández de Biedma listed him as one of the survivors, simply giving his last name as Bustillon, and his origin as Castilla la Vieja, Smith-296.\n\nCaldera. Survivor from Alburquerque, Smith-295.\n\nCalderon, Pedro. Survivor from Badajoz, Smith-293. We know he endured the hardships of the Florida expedition because he appeared as a witness twice in Mexico in 1547, and once in Badajoz, Spain, in 1558. In Mexico he declared he knew de Soto in Sevilla in 1537 and that de Soto sent Juan de Añasco to Florida to discover a suitable port and to obtain some guides. Anasco came back after two months, having done both. He found a secure port and brought back to Havana two Florida natives who asserted that many riches and gold were to be found there. When the de Soto expedition reached the port, which they named Espiritu Santo, many left to explore inland, while Calderon remained behind as captain of the men that safeguarded the ships. It was there that he received a message from Isabel de Bobadilla for her husband, de Soto, by a captain who brought it from Havana. [29] When Calderon testified in Badajoz in 1558 in the probanza of Gonzalo Silvestre, another of de Soto's men, he asserted he was around 60 years old and a native of that city. He had known Silvestre since 1538 when both were among the soldiers going from Sevilla to Cuba and on to Florida. In the Florida expedition he was one of de Soto's captains for nearly five years. After de Soto's death and finding they could not maintain themselves, Silvestre and Calderon constructed several brigantines. With them they were able to reach New Spain. Silvestre later departed for Peru while Calderon stayed in Mexico, after which he returned to Badajoz where we find him in 1558. Calderon signed his depositions. [30] Pedro Calderon is mentioned often by the chroniclers Rangel, Elvas, and Garcilaso de la Vega. [31] He was the son of Rodrigo Calderon and Beatriz de Hoces, citizens of Badajoz, SR-276. There is a discrepancy here that should be noted. While Solar and Rújula indicated that Calderon registered for the Indies with his sons Rodrigo Calderon and Gregorio de Hoces and his wife Isabel Sayaga, Cristóbal Bermúdez Plata mentioned Isabel as his daughter, not his wife. [32]\n\nCalderon, Rodrigo. Son of Pedro Calderon, survivor from Badajoz, Smith-292. This conqueror should be the son of Captain Pedro Calderon mentioned above and listed in SR-277.\n\nCalle, Juan de la. Son of Andres Miguel and Leónor Cazurra, citizens of Sanfronte, suburb of Zamora, SR-324. Calle was a shoemaker from Castilla la Vieja who survived the de Soto expedition according to Smith-297.\n\nCalvarrasa, Toribio de. Son of Bartolome de San Martin and Francisca Sanchez, citizens of Salamanca, SR-327. Calva Rasa from Castilla la Vieja was one of the survivors appearing in Smith-296.\n\nCalvera, Diego de. He declared in Mexico in 1561 that he was a resident of that city, 35 years old, and a survivor of the Florida adventure. During that lengthy exploration he witnessed the death of Francisco de Osorio, a brother of Garcia Osorio who was also present. Calvera signed his testimony. [33] His name is not included in the lists made by Solar and Rújula or Hernandez de Biedma. However, the latter included a Caldera from Alburquerque already mentioned above, Smith-295, who could be the same person.\n\nCalzada, Juan de. Son of Anton de Calzada and Maria Santiago, citizens of Una. Smith-294 lists a survivor called Calzada from Zafra, Almendralejo, or Segura. No Una is known to be in that vicinity.\n\nCañete, Garcia de. Son of Pedro de Cañete and Elvira de Avila, citizens of Illescas, SR-283. Smith-296 includes a survivor called Cañete from Ubeda or Baeza. This could be fray Sebastian de Cañete, author of the so-called Cañete Fragment, who may have been another witness and chronicler of the de Soto expedition and whose complete writings are yet to be found. [34]\n\nCardenas, Lorenzo de. In February 1545 he rendered testimony in Tenochtitlan (Mexico), New Spain at the request of Baltasar de Gallegos, one of de Soto's companions. At that time Cardenas declared he had known Gallegos in 1537 when they were making the necessary preparations in Sevilla to depart for the Indies. Later, they sailed to the province of Florida where Cardenas saw Gallegos participate in several explorations and wars against the natives. After de Soto's death the survivors decided to leave that land and, covered with animal skins, they reached New Spain. Cardenas was living in the capital in 1545 when he declared he was 25 years old and signed his declaration. [35] This conqueror is not mentioned by Hernandez de Biedma, nor by Solar and Rújula.\n\nCarmona, Alonso de. This survivor was residing in Cuzco, Peru, in the year 1556, when he testified in the probanza of Pedro de Arevalo. He stated that he had gone with Arevalo in de Soto's expedition to Florida by way of Sevilla and Havana and finally disembarking in the port of Espiritu Santo. After several years of discoveries and de Soto's death, he followed Luis de Moscoso to Mexico. Shortly after, he proceeded to Peru where he made this signed deposition. [36] Carmona was not included in Luis Hernandez de Biedma's list of survivors, yet this citizen of Priego was an important source of information for Garcilaso de la Vega who cited his two written peregrinaciones. [37] According to Garcilaso, Carmona wrote his peregrinations after returning from Peru to live in Spain. From there he sent them to Vega. [38]\n\nCaro, Alonso. Son of Hernan Caro and Elvira Lopez, citizens of Valencia de la Torre, SR-308. According to Smith-294, there was a survivor with this name from Almendralejo which is a town near this Valencia.\n\nCarrion, Juan. Son of Juan Esteban and Isabel Fernández, citizens of Badajoz, SR-299. According to Smith-293, there was one survivor of the same name, a tailor from Badajoz.\n\nCaro, Alonso. Another soldier with the same name, this was the son of Juan Garcia Caro and Maria Hernández, citizens of Medellín, SR-297. His name appears among the survivors as being from Medellín, Smith-294.\n\nCarranza, Luis de. One survivor of the expedition is listed as Carrance, Smith-292, while Garcilaso de la Vega mentioned one Juan de Carranza from Sevilla. However, the most likely name of this conqueror is Luis, as he signed and called himself in 1545. [39] In that year Luis de Carranza declared in Mexico that he was from Sevilla, now a resident of the city of Mexico, and 23 years old. He had known Baltasar de Gallegos, one of de Soto's men and in whose probanza he was witnessing for eight years. He saw Gallegos making the necessary preparations in Sevilla to depart for Florida, including the purchasing of goods and the acquisition of several black slaves and horses. Both Gallegos and the witness finally reached Florida in the de Soto armada, where they remained exploring the land for several years. After the death of the governor, they decided to leave the land and, dressed as they were in animal skins, they reached Mexico. Carranza asserted that Gallegos always behaved like a noble. He signed his deposition.\n\nCarrasco, Juan. Son of Martin Hernández and Leónor Diez, citizens of Oliva. According to Smith-293, there was one survivor of the same name who was a tailor from Jerez or Villanueva. There is an Oliva quite close to Jerez and Villanueva, all in Extremadura province, where many of de Soto's men were born.\n\nCarrauz. A survivor from Torrejon, Smith-295.\n\nCarrion. Another survivor, this one from Ubeda or Baeza, Smith-296.\n\nCarrion, Pedro. Conqueror born in Carrion in the kingdom of Castilla around the year 1509, according to his declaration as a witness in the suit between Hernando Ponce de León and Isabel de Bobadilla. [40] He deposed that he had known de Soto in Nicaragua circa 1529, and saw him depart for Peru. Years later he accompanied him to Florida, where he saw him use a fine Peruvian tent made of wool and cotton from the Andes. He also witnessed the good land that they had found during that expedition. He signed his testimony. This man may be the same Carrion, native of Carrion de los Condes, listed among the survivors, Smith-297.\n\nCartuyo, Gonzalo. Surviving sailor from Sevilla, Smith-292.\n\nCarvajal, Lorenzo de. Soldier whose name does not appear in the list of survivors made by Hernandez de Biedma, nor in the list of persons registered in Sevilla for de Soto's expedition. The last is not surprising, for it seems that Carvajal was already in Cuba when de Soto's armada arrived from Spain. This is deduced from his own testimonies rendered in Mexico in the years 1554, 1557, and 1569. In the first instance he deposed, in Rodrigo Vasquez's probanza, that he was a citizen of the city of Mexico and 35 years of age. He added that he witnessed Vazquez serving in Florida and helping his wounded brother Alonso, whom he cared for all the way to Mexico. He signed his testimony. [41] Later, in 1557, Carvajal testified in the probanza of Hernan Suarez de Maruelas, another of de Soto's men. He confirmed that he went to Florida with Suarez and de Soto, without adding more about his own life. [42] Twelve years later, in 1569, he witnessed the probanza of Sebastian de Villegas Prieto, another of de Soto's soldiers. He asserted that he knew Villegas in Cuba some 30 years earlier and went with him to Florida and then to Mexico, where Villegas settled in the vicinity of the Guanajuato mines, where he was still residing in 1569. [43]\n\nCastejon, Francisco de. The existence of a Florida survivor with this name is well documented, for he testified in Mexico on two occasions, one in 1547, and another in 1560. In the first he asserted he was born in Soria around 1510. From both declarations it is clear that he participated in the expedition and discovery of Florida led by Hernando de Soto, whose death he witnessed, after which he left with the other survivors for New Spain. Both in 1547 and in 1560, Castejon declared he lived in Mexico and he signed his testimony. [44] Francisco de Castrejon, with an added \"r\", is listed as the son of Antonio de Castrejon and Francisca de Licardo, citizens of Soria, SR-317. There is a survivor of de Soto's expedition named Castrejon but from Astorga, listed in Smith-297. It appears he preferred to sign Castejon, if the scribe who wrote the mentioned documents spelled his name correctly.\n\nCastro, Juan de. Son of Pedro de Castro and Isabel de Turrenco, citizen of Benavente, SR-303. This soldier may be the same Castro from Castilla la Vieja, cited among the survivors of the expedition, Smith-296.\n\nCastro, Castro del. Survivor from Garciamunoz, Smith-295.\n\nColes, Juan. Son of Juan Coles and Luisa Rodriguez, citizen of Zafra, SR-323. Smith-294 adds that this survivor of the expedition was a tailor from Zafra. His Relación was one of the most important sources of written information for Garcilaso de la Vega, who, in The Inca's preface, mentioned how it was saved from destruction at the shop of a printer in Córdoba. In Mexico, Coles wrote that \"a citizen of Mexico named Xaramillo, took into his house eighteen men, all from Extremadura, and he clothed them with the fine broadcloth of Segovia, and that to each one he gave a bed with mattresses, sheets, and blankets and pillows, a comb and brush, and everything else needful for a soldier, and that all the city had been greatly pained to see them come clothed in deerskins and cow [buffalo] hides, and that they did them this honour and kindness for the many labors they knew they had undergone in Florida.\" [45]\n\nCordero, Juan. Son of Alvaro Cordero and Leónor Carcelas, citizens of Badajoz, SR-287. Hernandez de Biedma listed him as one of the survivors of the expedition, originally from Portugal, Smith-298. Here again there is an example of a Portuguese listing himself as being from just the other side of the Spanish border, namely Badajoz. Garcilaso mentions a Joam Cordeiro, clearly a Portuguese name, native of Yelves, or Elvas, and most likely the same person listed here. [46] He made his probanza in Jaen, Peru, in 1561 where he was living then. He declared he came from Mexico to Peru where he served the King fighting in the battle of Xaquixaguana against the rebel Gonzalo Pizarro, who was defeated. He was one of the founders of the city of Jaen for he had accompanied Captain Diego Palomino in its conquest. He added he did not have enough income to support his wife and family.\n\nCoria. Survivor from Sevilla, Smith-292.\n\nCornejo, Alonso. Son of Francisco Cornejo and Leónor Gonzalez, from Valencia de la Torre, SR-292. Among the survivors of the Florida expedition there is a Cornejo from Zafra, Almendralejo or Segura, who may be this same soldier, Smith-294. However, there was another Alonso Cornejo who enlisted in Sevilla for Florida, a son of Anton Cornejo and Isabel Guerra, citizen of Castro Calbon, SR-330. Castro Calbon was located in the kingdom of León. The last Cornejo cited here may have lost his life in the exploration of Florida, while the first is likely a survivor.\n\nCorona, Rodrigo. Son of Pedro de Olias and Juana Lopez, citizens of Torrejon de Velasco, SR-311. Among the survivors appears a man by the same name who played the trumpet, credited as a native of Toledo, Smith-295.\n\nCortes, Diego. He testified in the city of Puebla la los Angeles in Mexico, that he was born in Medellín and that his parents were Pero Gutierrez and Catalina Cortes. He added that he took part in de Soto's expedition to Florida and that at the time he was residing in Puebla with his wife, a daughter of Alonso de Buiza. [47] Cortes is a survivor from Almendralejo, according to Smith-294. Medellín and Almendralejo are both in Extremadura.\n\nCuadrado, Gonzalo. Son of Gonzalo Cuadrado and Maria Gonzalez, citizens of Zafra, SR-305. Smith-294 lists a survivor of the same name and origin. The existence of Gonzalo Cuadrado is well documented, for he was a witness in Mexico in 1547, called to declare in the suit of Hernando Ponce de León against Isabel de Bobadilla, de Soto's widow. He stated he was a native of Zafra in Spain, a resident of Mexico and more than 35 years of age. He had known de Soto since 1537 and had accompanied him in the exploration of Florida. He signed his declaration. [48] Cuadrado was often mentioned by Garcilaso de la Vega, especially when describing the arrival of the Christians at Pánuco. [49]\n\nCustreros. A survivor from Astorga, Smith-297.\n\nDaza, Luis. This man prepared his departure for the Indies with special care. First, in 1537, he obtained from the local authorities of Valladolid, where he was born, a certificate that he was a man of noble lineage and descended from a line of honorable persons. Second, he successfully petitioned the Crown to issue a royal mandate naming him a regidor, or member of the city council where the governor of Florida chose to reside. [50] With these documents secured, he departed Sevilla for Cuba and then to Florida as part of de Soto's armada. In that new land he remained for some four years and witnessed many of the hardships, explorations, and wars with natives. These are described in the probanzas of Rodrigo Vasquez and Garcia Osorio, both his companions and de Soto's, while in the exploration of Florida. After abandoning that land for New Spain, he settled in Mexico City where he was in 1547, 1554, and 1560, declaring in those years that he had been born shortly before 1520, and signing his testimonies. [51] One of the survivors of the Florida adventure described as coming from Castilla la Vieja, is named Daze, a misspelling for Daza, Smith-296. In another instance, Daza declared in Mexico that he was the legitimate son of Alvaro Daza and Leónor Osorio, and that he had married a daughter of Diego Valadez. [52]\n\nDiaz, Juan. One of the survivors listed by Hernandez de Biedma as being from San Lucar de Barrameda, Smith-292. Garcilaso de la Vega described him however, as being from Granada. [53]\n\nDuarte, Juan. A survivor from Castilla la Vieja, Smith-297.\n\nEnriquez, Diego. Son of Pedro Lopez de Calatayud and Maria Enriquez, citizens of Valladolid, SR-314. Smith-298 lists an Enriquez from Astorga, left ailing at Pánuco.\n\nEspindola, Cristóbal. Survivor listed as a native of Sevilla, Smith-292. He is mentioned by Elvas, Ranjel and Garcilaso de la Vega. His existence is better documented for having testified in the probanza of Baltasar de Gallegos. [54] In this document, dated in Mexico in 1545, Espindola declared he was alguacil mayor of the Inquisition in New Spain, a native of Sevilla, and a resident of Mexico City. He had known Gallegos since around 1515, and he was born before 1505. He witnessed Gallegos' sale of all his properties in order to go to Florida, and with the latter and others, he embarked in de Soto's armada. He arrived in Florida where he made explorations and saw battles for several years until the survivors decided to abandon that land. Dressed in animal skins, he reached Mexico, where he then lived, and where he signed his declaration in the year 1545. Three years later he declared in Mexico that he was an hijodalgo, married to Doña Francisca Castaño, with whom he had three children. [55] Espindola was not listed as one of the survivors, nor does his name appear in the list of passengers registered in Sevilla for Florida.\n\nFernández, Alvaro. A conqueror not mentioned by Hernandez de Biedma nor Solar and Rújula. He declared under oath in Puebla de los Angeles, New Spain in 1544, that he had been with de Soto in the Florida expedition. He indicated that he had seen Juan de Añasco bring back from Florida three natives after he discovered the landing port for the expedition. He added, in his answers given in Juan de Anasco's probanza, that he had witnessed most of what Añasco asserted. He, as had all the rest of the survivors, went to Mexico where he remained at least until the year 1544, when he was 34 years old. Fernández signed his deposition. [56]\n\nFernández, Juan. Son of Francisco Pérez Pentiero and Catalina Martin, citizens of Alburquerque, SR-278. A survivor with the same name and from the same place is listed in Smith-295.\n\nFigueroa, Pedro de. A survivor from Zafra, Almendralejo, or Segura, Smith-294.\n\nFraile. Luis Hernandez de Biedma listed three surviving friars without giving their names, Smith-298. Two have been identified in this monograph as Juan Gallegos and Fray Francisco de Tones. Therefore, one is still unidentified and is referred to as Fraile.\n\nFuentes, Luis de. Son of Garcia de Fuentes and Beatriz Escobar, citizens of Sevilla, SR-296. This may be the same Fuentes from Sevilla, survivor of the de Soto expedition according to Smith-292.\n\nGaitan, Juan. Surviving treasurer of the army, native of Talavera de la Reina, Smith-295. The royal officials of the expedition were Gaitan, the treasurer, Hernandez de Biedma, the factor or administrator of the royal coffers, and Añasco, the contador. From Havana they sent a letter to the King dated May 8, 1539, recounting how de Soto's armada was about ready to sail for the Florida port already selected by Añasco and located 75 to 80 leagues from Havana. They mentioned that the total ships ready was nine and that the army contained 513 men, composed of 313 footmen and 200 horsemen, the latter taking a total of 237 horses. [57] Gaitan declared in Mexico that he was a son of Joan Gaitan and Doña Catalina de Ribera from Talavera de la Reina, married to Catalina de Zarate, and in charge of the natives of the town of Tlaculpo. He added that prior to the de Soto venture he had served the King in Tunis, and later went to Peru to help in its pacification. [58]\n\nGallego, Diego. Survivor from Castilla la Vieja, Smith-297. This soldier may or may not be the same Alonso Gallego, son of Francisco Dominguez and Elvira Garcia, citizens of Alconera, SR-305. This locality is in Badajoz, Extremadura.\n\nGallegos, Juan. He was a brother of Baltasar de Gallegos and thus possibly from Sevilla, and one of the three surviving priests, Smith-298. There is one person with the same name listed as son of Juan Martin Bermejo and Beatriz Belazquez, citizens of Oliva, SR-323. This may be the same priest mentioned by Garcilaso de la Vega, who wrote that he was from Sevilla. [59]\n\nGallegos, Baltasar de. Survivor from Sevilla, Smith-292, who made his probanza in Tenochtitlan, New Spain, in 1545. He started it by indicating that he was from Sevilla in Spain and a resident of Mexico where he had arrived around 1526. Later, he accompanied Baltasar de Osorio in the conquest and colonization of Tabasco where the former was wounded and where he chose to settle after receiving an encomienda there. After profiting from the labor and tribute of his encomendados for three or four years, he asked the Royal Audiencia for permission to return to Spain to marry. He travelled to his homeland and, after marrying Maria de Guzman, he learned that Francisco de Montejo had taken away his encomienda, for which reason he decided to join Hernando de Soto. De Soto named Gallegos his Field Marshal, and encouraged him to travel to Cuba with his wife and household. He did so, taking along several servants, horses, and slaves at an expense of more than 4,000 ducats. Once Gallegos arrived in Florida he engaged in many conquests, wars, and expeditions that took place in the following years. In the process he lost several of his horses and slaves. He also suffered the death of his brother who had participated in the expedition and who was a priest of the Dominican order. After the survivors found they could not support themselves, they travelled to New Spain, dressed as they were in animal skins, arriving first at the port of Pánuco and then Mexico City. Finally, Gallegos asked his witnesses to testify on the above and to declare if he was indeed a noble man of well reputed parents. [60] Gallegos was one of the members of the Florida expedition most frequently mentioned by Elvas, Rangel and Garcilaso de la Vega. [61]\n\nGallegos, Rodrigo de. Son of Juan de Escobar and Beatriz Gallegos, citizens of Sevilla, SR-328. The same person is listed among the survivors, Smith-292.\n\nGalvan, Fernan. Son of Francisco Galvan and Maria Esteban, citizens of Valverde, SR-310. Galvan is listed as a survivor, from Zafra, Almendralejo, or Segura, Smith-294. There are two Valverdes located not far from the axis Almendralejo-Zafra-Segura, all in Extremadura.\n\nGamez, Juan de. Son of Hernando de Gamez and Isabel de Pancorvo, SR-276. Survivor not listed by Hernandez de Biedma, yet he was living in Mexico City by 1561. There, in the month of January, he was asked to testify in the probanza of Garcia Osorio, another of de Soto's soldiers. Gamez stated that he knew Garcia and his brother Francisco in the expedition to Florida, the latter having died in that conquest. Afterwards, he and many others, including Garcia, went to Mexico. He added that he was 35 years of age and signed his deposition. [62]\n\nGarcia, Diego. Son of Juan Hernández and Maria Alonso, citizens of Fuente del Maestre, SR-333. A man with the same name is listed among the survivors as a native of Jerez or Villanueva, Smith-293. All the localities mentioned here are in the same corner of Extremadura.\n\nGarcia de León, Juan. Another survivor not mentioned by Hernandez de Biedma, yet he was in Puebla de los Angeles, Mexico, in 1544, where he declared in Juan de Anasco's probanza that he had witnessed much of what this companion had experienced in the Florida expedition. He signed this deposition stating he was 37 years old. [63] There was a conqueror who enlisted with de Soto in Sevilla named Andres Garcia, citizen of León, son of Pedro Garcia and Mari Garcia, SR-294.\n\nGarcia Pechuda, Juan. Son of Pedro or Gonzalo Garcia Pechudo and Maria Rodriguez \"la Pechuda.\" He is listed among a group of men from Alburquerque, SR-278. Hernandez de Biedma changed his second last name to Pechuga, while listing him among the survivors of the Florida expedition, Smith-295.\n\nGarcia Rueda, Juan. Son of Francisco Garcia and Maria Sanchez, citizens of Badajoz, SR-317. A man with the same name from Valverde de Badajoz is listed among the survivors, Smith-293.\n\nGarcia, Rui. A survivor, native of San Lucar de Barrameda, Smith-292.\n\nGen, Baltasar. Surviving notary from Badajoz, Smith-293.\n\nGin. Survivor from Castilla la Vieja, Smith-296.\n\nGiraldo. Survivor from Astorga, Smith-297.\n\nGodoy, Garcia de. Son of Hernando de Jerez and Elvira Godoy, citizens of Medellín, SR-297. Survivor of the Florida expedition according to Smith-295. Witness called to testify in the probanza of Juan de Añasco in Puebla de los Angeles, Mexico, in 1544. There he declared that he was with Añasco in the Florida expedition, from which they came out via the Pánuco River. He added that he was 25 years old, and signed his name as Garcia de Godoy, though it appears at the beginning of the document as Hernando de Godoy. [64]\n\nGómez, Alonso. Son of Alonso Gómez and Marina Alonso, citizens of Villanueva de la Serena, SR-304. Survivor from Jerez or Villanueva, according to Smith-293.\n\nGonzalez, Alonso. Survivor from Astorga, Smith-297.\n\nGonzalez de Alor, Juan. Son of Alonso Vazquez de Alor and Catalina Alvarez, citizens of Villanueva de Barcarrota, SR-331. Survivor from Jerez, Smith-293. Jerez and Villanueva are located in the same region.\n\nGonzalo or Gregorio. Survivor from Galicia, Smith-299.\n\nGutierrez, Alonso. Survivor from Medellín, Smith-295.\n\nGutierrez, Alonso. Survivor from Portugal, Smith-298.\n\nGutierrez, Alonso. Son of Fernan Gutierrez and Isabel Garcia, citizens of Albuquerque, SR-279. Survivor, Smith-295. This soldier, or either of the two who precede, may be the same Alonso Gutierrez de Cardona, of whom more information is available because he testified in the probanza of Gonzalo Silvestre. By his own declarations in Badajoz in 1558, we know that he was living there in his forty-fourth year. He states he was a captain in the Florida expedition and, along with the survivors, he continued to Mexico. There he remained for some time, where he saw Silvestre depart for Peru. He signed his declaration. [65]\n\nGutierrez de Córdoba, Alonso. After Hernando Ponce de León studied the background of witnesses presented by Isabel de Bobadilla in their law suit, he vetoed the testimony of this conquistador from Badajoz. He believed that Gutierrez was partial to Isabel because he had been a part of her deceased husband's expedition to Florida. [66] The possibility exists that this Gutierrez de Córdoba could be the same Alonso Gutierrez listed immediately above.\n\nGutierrez Guino, Francisco. Not mentioned by Hernando de Biedma unless this is the man he calls Gin who is listed above. There is one Francisco Guini who registered in Sevilla to go to Florida, son of Francisco Guini and Mari Gutierrez, SR-334. Gutierrez Guino deposed in the probanza of Hernan Suarez, made in Mexico City in 1557. He testified that he was 38 years old, knew Suarez since 1539 and went with him to Florida, as part of the de Soto expedition, of which about 300 men survived. His statements proved his familiarity with the events of the expedition referred to by Suarez. He signed his declaration. [67]\n\nGutierrez, Juan. Son of Francisco Gómez Montero and Isabel Gutierrez, citizens of Usagre, SR-292. Survivor from Badajoz according to Smith-293. Usagre is about 70 miles southeast of Badajoz.\n\nGuzman, Francisco de. In 1558 in Lima, Peru, this survivor testified as follows. He went from Sevilla to Cuba with those enlisted by de Soto. In Cuba he and about 650 soldiers embarked for Florida arriving at the port of Espíritu Santo. After several years of discoveries de Soto died and was succeeded by Luis de Moscoso, who led the 350 survivors to Mexico. [68] Hernandez de Biedma listed a Guzman from Toledo among the survivors, Smith-295. This conqueror may be either the son of Benito Rodriguez and Francisca Hernández, citizens of Sevilla, SR-289, or the son of Diego Lopez de Guzman and Teresa Alvarez, citizens of Toledo, SR-320. Nowhere in Guzman's testimony does it say whether he was from Toledo or Sevilla. However, Garcilaso de la Vega stated that the one from Sevilla was called Diego. This strengthens the possibility that the one listed here is the Francisco from Toledo.\n\nHernández, Alonso. Son of Diego Hernández Bejarano and Joana Fernández, citizens of Luciana, in Castilla la Nueva, SR-293. A man with the same name is listed among the survivors as a native of Castilla la Vieja, Smith-296.\n\nHernandez de Biedma, Luis. Famous chronicler of the de Soto expedition and possible author of the list of survivors so many times mentioned in this work. He took with him a free colored man named Luis Moreno, SR-295. Hernandez de Biedma as factor was one of the three royal officials of the expedition. He is listed among the survivors from Ubeda and Baeza, Smith-295.\n\nHernández de Ribera, Pedro. Son of Pedro de Ribera and Teresa Rodriguez, citizens of Mondoñedo, SR-294. Smith-298 lists a Pedro de Ribera from Galicia, who may be the same, since Mondonedo is within this province.\n\nHernández, Sebastian de. Son of Simon Hernández and Isabel Alonso, citizens from Badajoz, SR-282. He testified in Mexico that he was from Badajoz and a legitimate son of Simon Hernández. He added that he had been in the conquest of Florida with de Soto, after which he had arrived in Pánuco where he married a native woman, widow of conqueror Diego Hernández. [69]\n\nHerrera. Survivor from Toledo, Smith-295. This may be Pedro Diaz de Herrera, son of Juan Diaz de Herrera and Martina Garcia, citizens of Ocana. [70]\n\nHoces, Gregorio. Son of Pedro Calderon and Isabel Sayaga, citizens of Badajoz, SR-277. There is a survivor by this name, listed as the son of Pedro Calderon, from Badajoz, Smith-292.\n\nInostrosa, Luis de. Son of Juan Fernández de Inostrosa and Guiomar de Torres, citizens of Sevilla, SR-318. One of the survivors is listed as Inestrosa, from the same city, Smith-292.\n\nJacome. Surviving foreigner, Smith-299.\n\nJuan, Maestre. Survivor from Astorga, Smith-297.\n\nLandero, Domingo. Brother of Captain Juan Nieto and a survivor of the Florida expedition, native of Alburquerque according to Smith-295. He was the son of Pedro Martin Nieto and Mari Sanchez de Torrejana, citizens of Alburquerque, SR-278.\n\nLera, Francisco de. Surviving tailor from Ubeda or Baeza, Smith-296. SR-333 lists a Francisco de Lerena, son of Pedro de Lerena and Maria Gonzalez, citizens of Arcos. However, there is no Arcos near Ubeda.\n\nLopez. A survivor, brother of Gavian Lopez, from Portugal, Smith-298.\n\nLopez, Abian. Son of Pedro Lopez and Catalina Lopez, citizens of Badajoz, SR-287. One of the survivors is listed as Gavian Lopez from across the border in Portugal, Smith-298.\n\nLopez, Juan. Survivor from the Florida expedition, native of Ubeda or Baeza, Smith-296.\n\nLopez Cacho, Juan. Isabel de Bobadilla, Hernando de Soto's widow, was sued by Hernan Ponce de León, his surviving partner, over some assets left by the deceased. During that lengthy judicial process, Juan Lopez Cacho was called in 1546 in Madrid to testify on certain matters. Among other things, he indicated that the following was true. He had known de Soto since 1537 or 1538 and been selected, along with five to six hundred other men, for the Florida exploration. They left Sevilla for Cuba, and then sailed from Havana, in June 1539, in one of the nine ships of the de Soto armada, destined to carry 700 men to a pre-selected port in Florida. In this new land, Lopez was de Soto's aide until his master's death, which he witnessed. He signed his deposition, indicating that he was 27 years old and a resident of Sevilla in the district of Santa Maria. [71] Fifteen years later Juan reappeared in Mexico to testify again, this time in the probanza of Garcia Osorio. Then he stated he was 44 years old, a survivor of the Florida expedition and a temporary resident of that city. [72] Hernández de Biedma listed him as a survivor from Sevilla, Smith-292.\n\nLopez de Salto, Juan. Judging by the numerous instances found in the probanzas mentioned here and many other documents inspected by the present author, hearsay was acceptable legal evidence in the Spanish Empire, at least during the sixteenth century. Thus one witness testified in Mexico in 1562, that he had heard from Juan Lopez del Salto that Francisco Gutierrez had been in Florida with de Soto. [73] From this assertion we believe that Lopez was in Florida with Adelantado. This individual may be the same listed as son of Tomas Lopez Cimarron and Maria del Salto, citizens of Jaen, SR-276, particularly considering the mother's last name. Also, he may be the same survivor listed by Smith-296 as Juan Lopez Zaharron, from Ubeda or Baeza. Cimarron and Zaharron appear to be different spellings of the same name.\n\nMadrigal. Survivor from Zafra, Almendralejo, or Segura, Smith-294. There is one Alonso de Madrigal, son of Juan de Madrigal and Maria Gorda, citizens of Molezuelas, SR-316. Molezuelas was located in the Kingdom of León, a good distance away from the Almendralejo region.\n\nMaldonado, Francisco. This survivor was called by Isabel de Bobadilla, de Soto's widow, to testify in her legal contest with Hernan Ponce de León. Maldonado indicated in April, 1546, in Madrid, that he had met de Soto in 1537 or 1538. De Soto told Maldonado, in Valladolid, that the King had granted him the exploration and settlement of Florida. Maldonado accompanied him from that city to Cuba and later sailed to Florida where he served for the duration. He signed his testimony. [74] In the expedition he was an infantry captain, frequently mentioned by Rangel, Hernandez de Biedma, Elvas and Garcilaso de la Vega. [75] Maldonado was a son of Rodrigo Maldonado and Beatriz Maldonado, citizens from Salamanca, SR-333.\n\nMarban, Bueso. Son of Garcia Marban and Maria Benevides, citizens of Villanueva de Valdepeñas (?), SR-329. Marban was a survivor from Astorga, Smith-297.\n\nMarban, Esteban. Son of Juan Marban and Maria Sanchez, citizens of Labaniz (?) or Baniz, SR-329. This may be the surviving scribe or notary from Astorga, Smith-297.\n\nMarin, Andres. Son of Alonso Gonzalez Capillero and Catalina Marin, citizens of Tierra de Miranda, SR-291. Survivor from Almendralejo, Smith-294.\n\nMartin Galindo, Francisco. Son of Alonso Sanchez Galindo and Leónor Martin, citizens of Bollullos, (not Lolenllas which is a misreading) SR-328. A Galindo is listed as a survivor from Sevilla, Smith-292. Bollullos is a small town between Huelva and Sevilla.\n\nMartin Sandoval, Francisco. Though his name does not appear in the list of survivors of Hernandez de Biedma, this Martin was in the Florida expedition led by de Soto, according to his testimony given in Valladolid, Spain, in 1558. [76] We also learn that after Martin had been in Florida and witnessed de Soto's death, he went to Peru where he lived for some thirteen years. During that time he was active in supporting the Crown and President de la Gasca against Gonzalo Pizarro's rebellion, and later against the uprising of Francisco Hernández Giron. He also stated that he was born in 1516 in Talavera and signed his deposition. There is a Francisco Martin who appears to be the same person listed here. He was a son of Alonso Martin and Catalina Sanchez, citizens of Talavera de Badajoz, SR-281.\n\nMartin, Gonzalo. Son of Tome Gonzalez and Catalina Rodriguez, citizens of Medellín, SR-297. A survivor with the same name and origin is listed in Smith-295.\n\nMartin, Gonzalo. This is a different survivor from the above. He was a witness in Tergueros, Spain, in 1547 and indicated that he was a thirty-year-old shoemaker from Sevilla where he lived in the district of Santa Maria. He went to the island (sic) of Florida and saw de Soto using an elaborate tent, which was said to have belonged to Hernando Ponce de León. He signed his testimony. [77] There is another person of this name, a son of Sebastian Gonzalez and Teresa Sanchez, citizens of Azuaga, SR-313. Azuaga is about 60 miles from Sevilla.\n\nMartinez, Anton. Survivor from Portugal, Smith-298. Elvas mentioned an Antonio Martinez Segurado, from Elvas. In addition, there was an Antonio Martinez who served as a witness in Puebla de los Angeles, Mexico, in 1544. There, at the request of Juan de Añasco, he testified that he was transient in that locality and over 30 years old. He added that he had been in the exploration of Florida, giving some details about his participation. He signed his deposition. [78]\n\nMartinez, Francisco. Survivor from Zafra, Almendralejo, or Segura, Smith-294. There was one person with this name who registered in Sevilla for Florida, but he was said to be from Salamanca. He was a son of Francisco Martin and Maria Martin, SR-318.\n\nMartinez, Vicente. Survivor who was left ailing at Pánuco, Smith-298. He testified in Mexico that he was born in Ciudad Real, a legitimate son of Joan Martinez de Malaguilla and Mari Sanchez. He added that he had been in Florida with the Adelantado de Soto for four years, after which he went to Pánuco. At the time of his declaration he was living in Pánuco, poor and married. [79]\n\nMartucho. Survivor from Vizcaya, Smith-298.\n\nMateos, Jorge. Survivor of foreign origin, Smith-298.\n\nMendez, Ana. This woman's presence in Florida during its exploration is well documented. She was a witness in the probanza of Alonso Vazquez in Jerez de Badajoz, Spain, in the year 1560. [80] She declared that she was a servant of Doña Isabel de Bobadilla and about thirty-one years of age. To the questions presented to her, she answered that Alonso Vazquez was in Florida and that she was involved in all that took place at that time. Specifically, when asked if it was true that after arriving at a marsh, which took three days to cross while going without food, they arrived at a province called Ocal, where food was found, she answered: That she remembered crossing that swamp, there being much water in it...which they went through with much labor in three days, but does not recall if they passed the time without food. She continued assenting to most of the questions, answering to one that she saw the Indians kill Don Carlos, her master, and that Alfonso Vazquez was wounded by an arrow in an ankle and was a long time lame. She also testified that they went from Florida to Mexico, wearing skins. Lastly, she did not sign her declarations for she stated she could not write.\n\nMendez de Sotomayor, Gonzalo. This conqueror made his probanza in February of 1560, in the city of Tenochtitlan, New Spain. He embarked in Sevilla in de Soto's armada carrying his arms and horses on to Florida. There Mendez served for five years. In the Apalache region, de Soto placed him in command of 30 men whose mission was to reconnoiter a port about 100 leagues away. The task was accomplished after many hardships. After Florida, Mendez went to Mexico where he settled. In his probanza, Mendez asked the witnesses to verify that he and his father, Cristóbal Mendez de Sotomayor, who had been a justicia mayor in Mérida, were hijodalgos or of noble origin. [81] One year later Mendez appeared as a witness in the probanza of Garcia Osorio, another survivor who stayed in Mexico. In it Mendez declared that he was a trader, a resident of Mexico City, and 36 years of age. He added that he had known Osorio before arriving in Florida. Both had remained several years, and there he witnessed the natural death of Francisco, a brother of Osorio. He signed his deposition. [82] Gonzalo Mendez was a son of Cristóbal Mendez and Leónor Vazquez, citizens of Villanueva de Barcarrota, SR-319. His name is included in the list of survivors as from Villanueva, Smith-393.\n\nMesa, Juan de. Survivor from Sevilla, Smith-292.\n\nMiguel. Survivor from Vizcaya, Smith-297.\n\nMiranda, Juan de. He was listed by Hernández de Biedma, without his first name, as a survivor from Soria, Smith-296. Juan declared in Mexico that he was an hijodalgo, resident of Villarrica, Mexico, born in Soria, Spain, a son of Sancho de Miranda and Catalina Gonzalez de Saravia. He added that he departed Spain for Peru but ended up going with de Soto to Florida. He was, at the time of his declaration, married to Francisca Mejia. [83]\n\nMonzon, Gonzalo de. In 1562, while residing in the City of the Kings of Peru, which is Lima, this survivor declared as follows. He witnessed Hernando de Soto's departure from Peru for Spain and was present when de Soto married Doña Isabel de Bobadilla, legitimate daughter of Pedro Arias. At that time he knew that the King had conceded to de Soto the conquest of Florida. Monzon went on that conquest where he remained several years and where he witnessed de Soto's death. He signed his deposition and added that he was 40 years old. [84] Monzon is not included in the list of Hernandez de Biedma nor among those who registered in Sevilla to travel to the Indies, as compiled by Solar and Rújula.\n\nMorales. Survivor from Soria, Smith-297.\n\nMorales, Bartolome de. Son of Marcos de Morales and Catalina Pumaveda, citizens of Sevilla, SR-325. There was a Morales from Sevilla listed by Hernandez de Biedma, Smith-292.\n\nMoreno, Pedro. Son of Pedro Moreno and Constanza Lopez de Miranda, citizens of Puentedeume, a small town in Galicia, SR-290. Survivor from Galicia, Smith-298. In Mexico, he declared that he was a legitimate son of Pedro and Constanza, already mentioned, and that he left Spain for Florida, where he was in charge of the harquebusiers. He was now living in Michoacán with his wife, a legitimate daughter of Pedro Calero. [85]\n\nMoscoso, Luis de. Perhaps the most experienced survivor for he had taken part in the conquest of Peru prior to Florida. On August 20, 1535, Moscoso was called to testify in a secret investigation made in Lima, on the conduct of Francisco Pizarro and several of his officers, regarding the managing of the royal treasury. [86] Soon after he must have departed for Spain, for he appears again. Moscoso was one of the highest ranking individuals under de Soto, and was for some time, Maestre de Campo or commanding officer, in charge of the administrative affairs of the army. After de Soto's death, Moscoso was elected governor and then directed the expedition out of Florida to Pánuco. From this port Moscoso continued to Mexico City where, on October 17, 1543, he wrote to the King, asking him the award of the encomienda of the Indians of Xochimilco. [87] Later, in 1547, he claimed in the same city, that he was a native of Zafra, Spain, the he had known Hernando de Soto since 1525, and that he was forty-two years of age. [88] In Mexico, Moscoso was accused of living illegally with his cousin Leónor de Alvarado, who had given him a son. Moscoso figures prominently in the writings of Rangel, Garcilaso de la Vega, Hernandez de Biedma, and Elvas, because of his rank and activities. [89] He was a son of the Comendador Alonso Hernández de Diosdado and Doña Isabel de Alvarado, both from Zafra, SR-329. Hernandez de Biedma lists him as a survivor, Smith-294. Two of Moscoso's brothers also outlived the Florida experience; they were Juan de Alvarado and Cristóbal de Mosquera, included here in their proper places.\n\nMosquera, Cristóbal de. Brother of Luis de Moscoso, native of Zafra, survivor of the Florida expedition, Smith-294. Son of Alonso Hernández de Diosdado and Isabel de Alvarado, citizens of Zafra, SR-329.\n\nMuñoz, Juan. Citizen of Villada in Tierra de Medina de Ruiseco, a locality in Castilla, and a resident of Mexico City in 1547, at which point he was 27 years old. There he declared having known Hernando de Soto in 1538, whom he accompanied to Florida. That had the Adelantado survived, he would have established permanent communities in Florida, for it had excellent lands to cultivate wheat and vineyards and to raise cattle. He signed his deposition. [90] This Muñoz is probably the son of Martin Muñoz and Maria Garcia, citizens of Villacidaler, SR-316, a place quite near Medina de Ruiseco. Also, he could be the same person mentioned by Garcilaso de la Vega as being from Burgos which is not too far from Palencia, the province where Villacidaler is located.\n\nNieto, Alvaro. Son of Pedro Martin Nieto and Mari Sanchez de Torrejana, citizens of Alburquerque, SR-278. Survivor originally from Alburquerque, Smith-295. In 1547, while living in Mexico, he testified in the Bobadilla lawsuit that he was 35 years old and had known de Soto since 1539. He further related having been at the port of Espíritu Santo in Florida when a ship arrived with a message from Isabel de Bobadilla for her husband. Also, according to Nieto, de Soto had a very fine tent made of quality Peruvian woolens and, had the latter not died, he would have established cities in Florida, for its lands were very rich. Nieto signed his testimony. [91] Once again, in Mexico in 1554, Nieto was called as a witness by Rodrigo Vazquez, another of de Soto's soldiers. No further details about his participation in the Florida expedition were given except that he was very active there. [92] He is mentioned several times by Garcilaso who indicates Nieto was a captain in the army. [93]\n\nNieto, Juan. Brother of Alvaro Nieto and son of Pedro Martin Nieto and Mari Sanchez de Torrejana, SR-278. This Nieto was from Alburquerque as well and a survivor of the Florida expedition, Smith-295.\n\nNuñez de Prado, Pedro. Son of Juan Nuñez de Prado and Maria de Solis, citizens of Fuente de Arco, SR-301. Survivor from Llerena, Smith-293. Fuente de Arco is about 10 miles from Llerena.\n\nNuñez de Vargas, Vasco. He appears to be a brother of Juan de Vargas, since his parents are listed as Hernando de Vargas and Ines Alvarez de Balboa, citizens of Burguillos, SR-296. This should be one of the two survivors listed by Hernandez de Biedma as Vargas from Burguillos, Smith-294. The other should be Juan de Vargas listed below.\n\nOliva, Diego de. Survivor from Castilla la Vieja, Smith-297. Garcilaso indicated he was a native of Cuba. [94]\n\nOlivas, Val de. Another survivor from Castilla la Vieja, Smith-296. There is a small town called Valdeolivas some 70 miles east of Madrid, thus in Castilla la Nueva. The conqueror referred to here may have been one of its citizens. It is possible as well, that he could be Cristóbal de las Olivas; if so, he could be the son of Francisco Dominguez and Francisca Hernández from Córdoba, SR-314, a city not in Castilla la Nueva, however.\n\nOrtiz, Bernabe. Son of Diego Rangel and Elvira Ortiz, citizen of Almendralejo, SR-321. Smith-294 lists him as Ortiz, adding that he was a brother of Rodrigo Rangel, a survivor from the Florida adventure.\n\nOrtiz, Francisco. Son of Pedro Ortiz and Maria de Lazcano, citizens of Segovia, SR-324. Ortiz was a survivor from Castilla la Vieja listed in Smith-296.\n\nOrtuño, Juan de. Son of Pedro Ortuno and Joana Arauzana, `r SR-291. One of the survivors is listed as Hortuno, from Portugal, Smith-298.\n\nOsorio, Antonio. Survivor and brother of the Marquis of Astorga, Smith-297. He was a son of the Marquis and Isabel Pérez, native of Astorga, SR-326. He is mentioned by chroniclers Rodrigo Rangel and Elvas. [95]\n\nOsorio, Garcia. In his probanza of services he rendered to the Crown, he began by stating that he was married to Isabel Marmolejo, daughter of a well known conqueror of Mexico, Francisco Marmolejo. From this document, dated 1560 and 1561 in Mexico, we know that he married her in that city. He continued, asserting that he sold all his properties in Valladolid to pay to accompany his brother Francisco on the Florida expedition. During this adventure, which lasted for a total of five years, his brother died, yet Garcia was able to make his way to Mexico. Prior to his life in the Indies, Garcia had served the King in Italy, Tunis, France and other parts of Europe. He also stated that he was of noble origin and an hidalgo. [96] The witnesses called in the probanza were in agreement with Osorio's statement. In 1546, Osorio was called to testify in the suit between Isabel de Bobadilla and Hernando Ponce de León. Besides stating that he was in Florida, he added that he was born in the town of Mestajes, Kingdom of León, around 1510. He signed his declaration. [97] This distinguished Osorio, who was captain of the harquebusiers, is mentioned more than once by Garcilaso de la Vega and by Elvas. [98] He is listed as a survivor from Astorga, Smith-297, which is in the Kingdom of León.\n\nOtazo, Juan de. Son of Cristóbal de Gamarra and (part of the document is missing) Rivera, citizens of Pedrosa, SR-329. Survivor from Astorga, Smith-297. This Pedrosa could be the one near Astorga.\n\nParis, Dionisio de. French cleric mentioned by Garcilaso de la Vega who indicated that he died. [99] However, Father Paris appears in the list of survivors, Smith-298.\n\nParra, Alonso de la. A cleric, son of Bartolome de la Parra and Catalina Pérez, citizens of Villanueva de Barcarrota, SR-331. He is listed from Jerez or Villanueva in Smith-293, which are towns located in the same province of Extremadura.\n\nPegado, Esteban. Son of Hernan Pegado and Lucia Lopez, from Badajoz, SR-287. Survivor from Portugal, Smith-298. It should be remembered that the proximity of Badajoz to Portugal may have encouraged those born in the latter to state that they were from Spain in order to avoid inconveniences in their passage to the Indies. Garcilaso de la Vega mentions Estevan Pegado of Yelves, for Elvas, in Portugal. [100]\n\nPegado, Fernan. Son of Esteban Pegado and a survivor from Portugal, listed only as Pegado in Smith-298. Elvas, however, stated that he was named Fernan. [101]\n\nPeloso, Bernaldo. He testified in Mexico that he was a resident of Pánuco, originally from Genova, and a legitimate son of Joan Peloso and Catalina Sancardo. He added that he had served the King in the conquest of Cartagena, from which he went with de Soto to Florida. He married a daughter of Lucas Ginoves in Pánuco. [102] Peloso sailed from Spain for Cartagena in 1532, landing there on January 14, 1533. [103] He may have been one of the founders of that city, which later became part of the New Kingdom of Granada.\n\nPérez, Andres. Son of Juan Hernández Carretero and Mari Fernández, from La Morera, SR-305. Survivor from Burguillos, Smith-294. Burguillos and Morera are not more than ten miles apart.\n\nPérez, Bartolome. Son of Alonso Añez and Teresa Fernández, citizens of Segura de León, SR-284. One survivor is listed only as Pérez, an ironsmith from Segura, Smith-294.\n\nPérez, Francisco. Survivor from Burguillos, Smith-294. This may be the son of Diego Pérez and Maria Hernández from Villanueva de Barcarrota, SR-314. There was however, another conqueror of Florida with the same name, son of Juan Pérez and Mari Sanchez, from Horcajo de la Rivera, SR-297.\n\nPérez, Juan. A survivor from Vizcaya, Smith-297.\n\nPérez, Simon. A survivor from Badajoz, Smith-293.\n\nPeria. A survivor from Vizcaya, Smith-298. There is a possibility that this is Andres de Pernia, a conqueror who testified that he made the passage to the Indies in 1537 or 1538 and engaged in the exploration of Florida. He appeared in the New Kingdom of Granada around 1547, where he was active in the founding of Pamplona, the city in which he made his probanza in 1557. [104]\n\nPorras. A survivor from Sevilla, Smith-292. There was a Luis de Porras, son of Juan de Porras and Ana de Salcedo, resident of Sevilla, who embarked from that port on March 13, 1538 for Santo Domingo. He could have proceeded to Florida the next year. [105]\n\nPorras, Juan de. Son of Rodrigo Darce and Maria de Rosales, from Medina de Pomar, SR-327 and 328. This Medina is in the province of Burgos. Porras was living in Mexico in 1554 when he was over 30 years old. He testified in the probanza of Rodrigo Vazquez, one of de Soto's soldiers, in 1554. There he declared he had known Vazquez since 1539. He asserted that he was involved in the conquest of Florida for almost five years, after arriving there from Spain via Cuba in the armada of de Soto. From Florida he went to Mexico, where he was well established by 1554. He signed his testimony. [106] Either Hernandez de Biedma missed this conqueror in his list of survivors, or he confused his provenance of Medina del Pomar with Sevilla.\n\nPortillo. Brother of Pérez, the ironsmith from Segura listed above, Smith-294.\n\nPozo, Father. Surviving priest from Segura, Smith-294. There was a Bartolome Pozo, son of Ferran Alonso Pozo and Isabel Macias, from Segura de León, SR-285. Garcilaso de la Vega mentions a priest called Francisco del Poso, from Córdoba. [107] This Segura is in Extremadura while Córdoba is in Andalucia.\n\nPozo, Pedro del. In the city of Cuzco in Peru, Pozo testified in Pedro de Arevalo's probanza, another of de Soto's men. This document, made in 1556, contains his short answers to the interrogatory presented to him. From them we learn that Pozo knew Arevalo since 1537, more or less, and that he witnessed some of the events related to the Florida expedition. He signed his deposition without indicating his age. [108] Pedro del Pozo was a son of Alonso del Pozo and Maria del Pozo, citizens of Salmeron, SR-328. He is likely the same survivor listed as Pozo Salmeron from Castilla la Vieja, Smith-296. Salmeron is a town in Castilla; however, not in la Vieja, but in la Nueva.\n\nRangel, Rodrigo. This name has survived the ages because, as secretary to de Soto, he kept a diary of the expedition, later used by the well-known royal chronicler, Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo. On May 13, 1539, Rangel recorded the will made by de Soto in Havana and, on December 6, 1543, he witnessed, in Santo Domingo, the intent of Isabel de Bobadilla to make an inventory of assets left by her deceased husband. [109] Rangel was a witness in the probanza made by Gonzalo Mendez de Sotomayor in the city of Mexico in 1560. From this document we know that Rangel was born before 1510 and that he had known Mendez's family for a long time since they lived in Extremadura where Rangel was born. He declared that he went from Spain to Florida in the de Soto armada and explored this land for several years. Rangel proceeded from Florida to New Spain with the other survivors and from there, to Santo Domingo to visit the widow Bobadilla. Later, he returned to Mexico where he settled and where he was at the time of this deposition. [110] Rodrigo Rangel was a son of Diego Rangel and Elvira Ortiz from Almendralejo, SR-321. He is listed simply as Rangel by Hernández de Biedma, Smith-294.\n\nRaya, Alonso de. Son of Juan de Raya and Catalina Cazorla, citizens of Ubeda, SR-291. Survivor from Ubeda, Smith-296.\n\nRedondo, Francisco. In the probanza of Sebastian Villegas, made in New Spain in 1569, Redondo testified that he knew this companion of de Soto not only in Cuba but also during the Florida expedition, where he suffered many hardships and hunger. He added that he was born before 1508, and declined to sign his declaration because he could not write. [111] Francisco was the son of Juan Redondo and Isabel Carmona, citizens of Medellín, SR-301. He is listed as a survivor from the Florida experience, Smith-295.\n\nReinoso, Francisco de. As a witness in Juan de Anasco's probanza made in Puebla de los Angeles, Mexico in 1544, he declared he had known Añasco since 1537. Reinoso added that he was born in 1511. He went from Sevilla to Florida in de Soto's armada and saw Añasco with three or four horses and several slaves. He was in Florida a long time and witnessed some of the actions described by Anasco. [112] This Francisco seems to have been the son of Gonzalo Reinoso and Isabel Escobar, citizens of Bobadilla or Bovadilla, SR-327. Hernandez de Biedma listed one Reinoso as a survivor from Astorga, Smith-297. No Bobadilla is near Astorga.\n\nRodriguez, Bartolome. In Mexico he declared that he was a son of Bartolome Rodriguez and Maria Rodriguez, born in Valencia de la Torre, and at the time of his declaration, a resident of Pánuco. In this city he married a daughter of conquistador Alonso Caballero. [113] He is listed as son of the parents mentioned above and from Valencia, SR-308.\n\nRodriguez, Fabian. Ironsmith established in the city of Puebla de los Angeles in New Spain in 1544. There he testified in the probanza of Juan de Añasco. He stated that he was born around 1514, and that he was present in the expedition to Florida directed by Hernando de Soto. He signed his declaration. [114] Fabian appears as the son of Alvar Garcia, citizen of Yeba Hernando (?), SR-319. In addition, he was included in the list of Hernandez de Biedma as a survivor from Medellín, Smith-295.\n\nRodriguez, Salvador. In 1556 in Cuzco, Peru, Rodriguez testified in the probanza of Pedro de Arevalo, one of the companions of de Soto. Rodriguez indicated that he had known Arevalo since 1536 and that the former was born around 1515. He stated that he had been in Florida where he saw many of the actions mentioned by Arevalo, including their arrival in Mexico under the leadership of Luis de Moscoso. At an unknown later date he proceeded to Peru, where he signed his testimony. [115] Salvador was a son of Alonso Rodriguez and Juana Rodriguez, citizens of Trujillo, SR-315.\n\nRomo, Alonso. Son of Gutierrez Garcia Cardenosa and Maria Romo, citizens from Badajoz, SR-281. He was a brother of Arias Tinoco and survived the Florida exploration, Smith-293. In Mexico he testified that he was from Badajoz and the son of the same parents mentioned above. He added that he had been with de Soto in Florida and that he had sailed for Pánuco as captain of one of the brigantines they had constructed. Romo is often mentioned by Hernández de Biedma, Rangel, Elvas and Garcilaso de la Vega, as a captain of cavalry. [116]\n\nRuiz, Bartolome. Stocking-maker from Sevilla who survived the Florida expedition, Smith-292. There was a Bartolome Ruiz, son of Francisco Ruiz Barragan and Elvira Jimenez, from Andujar, Smith-318, which is a town east of Córdoba, Andalucia, a province in which Sevilla is also located.\n\nRuiz, Juan. Son of Pedro Ruiz and Barbara Martinez, citizens of Arroyuelo, SR-322. This may be the same carpenter and survivor from Badajoz, Smith-293.\n\nRuiz, Juan. Survivor from Sevilla, one of the four ailing persons left at Pánuco, Smith-298.\n\nRuiz Lobillo, Juan. An experienced soldier who had taken part in the conquest of Cuzco in Peru prior to Florida. Between May and July 1535, Ruiz had a large quantity of gold appraised in Cuzco, for paying the corresponding taxes to the Crown. [117] He went from Peru to Spain to enroll in the army that would go to Florida. In two different instances, Ruiz Lobillo testified that he had been in Florida with Hernando de Soto. The first was in Mexico in 1547, when he indicated that he was born around 1520 (?) in Setenil. He added that when he was in the conquest of Florida he noticed the good quality of the land. [118] His second testimony was in Jerez, Spain, in 1560, where he reaffirmed his participation in the exploration of Florida. [119] In both cases Ruiz signed his testimonies. Ruiz may be the same conquistador listed by Hernandez de Biedma as Juan Rodriguez Lobillo, Smith-296.\n\nRuis de Llanos, Juan. This survivor testified in Lima, Peru in 1558, in the probanza of Pedro de Arevalo. [120] Juan indicated that he had known Arevalo since 1538 when both had gone to Florida under de Soto and where he witnessed much of what Arevalo indicated in his probanza. He signed his testimony. This soldier was not mentioned by Hernandez de Biedma, nor by Solar and Rújula.\n\nSagredo, Bartolome de. Son of Alonso de Sagredo and Francisca Serrato, SR-308. Listed as Sagrado, a survivor from Medellín appears in Smith-295. Garcilaso de la Vega mentioned him as Francisco Sagredo from Medellín. [121]\n\nSalamanca, Cosme de. Son of Pedro de Pascua and Ursula Martinez, citizens of Salamanca, SR-290. This may be the same Salamanca, a tailor from Castilla la Vieja, listed as a survivor, Smith-196.\n\nSalazar, Francisco de. Son of Diego de Salazar and Maria de la Cruz, citizens of Burgos, SR-303. Among the survivors of the Florida expedition a Salazar is listed as being from Castilla la Vieja, Smith-296.\n\nSalazar, Sin Ventura. Survivor from the Mountains, which could also mean from the Kingdom of Aragon, Smith-298.\n\nSan Jorge, Alvaro de. This survivor testified in Mexico, in 1547, that he was born in Galicia, Spain around 1502. He had known de Soto since the year 1537, and had gone to Florida. There he saw de Soto using a very good tent made of fine Peruvian cotton and wool. He witnessed the existence of the rich region of the chief Tigualta who had 17 provinces under his jurisdiction. From Florida he continued with the rest of the soldiers to Mexico, where he remained. [122] Garcilaso de la Vega has him as Sanjurge and makes him participant of an expedition to Mexico. [123] Hernandez de Biedma listed a San Jorge as one of the survivors from Galicia, Smith-298.\n\nSan Vicente, Juan de. He was a resident of Mexico in 1569, when he stated he was over 58 years of age. He became active in the preparation of the Florida expedition of de Soto in 1537, with whom he left Spain. He explored Florida for several years and, with the survivors, arrived in Mexico. He signed his testimony. [124] Neither Hernandez de Biedma, nor Solar and Rújula, acknowledged the existence of San Vicente.\n\nSanabria, Diego de. Son of Juan de Sanabria and Cecilia Vazquez, citizens of Medellín, SR-301. Sanabria is listed as one of the survivors from Medellín, Smith-295.\n\nSanchez, Andres. Brother of Francisco Sanchez, from Badajoz, Smith-293. If so, Andres should be the son of Pedro Sanchez and Leónor Martin, citizens of Badajoz, SR-286. There is another Andres Sanchez however, listed as son of Martin Sanchez Salvador and Catalina Garcia, citizens of Badajoz de Talavera, SR-286.\n\nSanchez, Atanasio. In 1561 he was a resident of Lima, Peru. There he testified, in the probanza of Juan Cordero, that he had known Cordero since 1537 when both left with Hernando de Soto for Florida. In this new land he witnessed Cordero's good service with arms and horses, and his command, for some time, of a group of men. He was in Florida for five years, after which he went to Mexico and then to Peru. In the latter he served the King with President de la Gasca against the rebel Gonzalo Pizarro, who was vanquished in the battle of Xaquixaguana. He signed his testimony and declared himself to be more than 40 years old. [125] Atanasio Sanchez was the son of Vasco Fernández and Juana Martin, citizens of Badajoz, SR-281.\n\nSanchez Rendon, Bartolome. Son of Bartolome Sanchez Rendon and Ana Martin, citizens of Algaba, SR-315. Among the survivors, Hernandez de Biedma lists a sword smith called Rodon, from Sevilla, Smith-292, who may be the same. Algaba is just outside Sevilla and Rodon could be a misspelling of Rendon.\n\nSanchez, Diego. Son of Juan Lorenzo and Leónor Sanchez, residents of Alburquerque, SR-279. He is listed as a survivor in Smith-295.\n\nSanchez, Francisco. Son of Pedro Sanchez and Leónor Martin, citizens of Badajoz, SR-286. Survivor listed in Smith-293.\n\nSanchez Mancera, Hernan. Son of Juan Mancera and Maria Sanchez, citizens of Talavera de Badajoz, SR-283. A survivor called Hernan Mancera is listed from Badajoz in Smith-293.\n\nSardina, Domingo. Son of Bartolome Vazquez and Isabel Rodriguez, SR-289. Hernandez de Biedma lists a tailor from Portugal called Domingo Sardina who probably is the same person, Smith-298.\n\nSayago, Juan. Son of Alonso Martin and Juana Sayaga, citizens of Zafra, SR-313. Among the survivors of the Florida expedition, Hernandez de Biedma listed a Sayago as tailor from Zafra, Smith-294. A tailor from Zafra called Juan Sayago testified in Mexico in 1547. On that occasion he declared himself to be 26 years of age. He was one of the explorers of Florida with Hernando de Soto whom he saw using a very good Peruvian tent. While he was in Florida, he also noticed how good the land was and that had de Soto lived, they would have settled that province. Sayago did not sign his deposition because he indicated that he did not know how to write. [126]\n\nSedeños, Juan. A foreigner who survived the Florida expedition, Smith-299. There was one Antonio Sedeño, son of Francisco Sedeño and Maria Alonso, citizens of Valladolid, who embarked for Florida, SR-330.\n\nSilvera, Diego de. Twice Silvera testified in Mexico City, the first in 1554 and the second in 1561, that he took part in the Florida expedition organized and led by Hernando de Soto, having embarked in Sevilla for Cuba where they remained almost one year. Afterwards, all the armada sailed for Florida. In this new land he engaged in several discoveries and expeditions over a period of five years until he abandoned it and left for Pánuco and Mexico, the latter being his place of residence in the years of his declarations. On both occasions he signed his testimonies, adding that he was born around 1514. [127] Garcilaso de la Vega mentions a Silvera from Galicia, calling him in one instance Francisco and in another Hernando. [128] Hernandez de Biedma lists a Silvera, Galician, among the survivors, Smith-298. On a third occasion, Silvera testified he was the son of Rui de Silvera and Teresa Rodriguez de Sejas, residents of San Payo (?) which is in Galicia. He added he went from Spain to Cuba with Bishop Diego Sarmiento, from which he continued with Hernando de Soto to Florida. [129]\n\nSilvestre, Gonzalo. In 1558, Silvestre requested permission from the authorities of Valladolid, Spain, to make a probanza of the services he rendered to the Crown in Peru, New Spain and Florida. Once obtained, he presented an interrogatory to the witnesses that he gathered in Valladolid, Badajoz, and Ciudad Rodrigo. In essence, he indicated that he was a citizen of Villa de Herrera, and that he went to Florida with Hernando de Soto in 1538, well equipped with arms and horses, where he remained for several years. Afterwards he reached New Spain and in 1544 he departed for Peru. In this province he took part, under Captain Diego Centeno, in the battle against the rebel Gonzalo Pizarro as well as in the final battle of Xaquixaguana where Pizarro was defeated and killed. Finally, he took part, with Gonzalo de Alvarado, in opposing and vanquishing the forces of the rebel Francisco Hernández Giron. [130] Gonzalo was the son of Gonzalo Silvestre and Isabel Morena, citizens of Alcántara, SR-319. He was mentioned so many times by Garcilaso de la Vega that he is believed to be the person who supplied this chronicler with most of his information. [131]\n\nSoria, Pedro de. Son of Juan de Soria and Ana, residents of Oropesa, SR-296. He is listed as a survivor from Castilla la Vieja by Hernandez de Biedma, Smith-296.\n\nSuarez de Figueroa, Gómez. Though not mentioned by Hernandez de Biedma nor Solar and Rújula, his name is contributed by chronicler Garcilaso de la Vega. Garcilaso wrote that after the survivors were able to reach Pánuco and the city of Mexico, Gómez Suarez returned to the house and estate of his father, Vasco Porcallo de Figueroa. [132]\n\nSuarez, Juan. Son of Pedro de Santa Maria and Juana Suarez, citizens of Caceres, SR-277. He is listed as a friend of Luis Bravo who also survived the Florida expedition, Smith-293.\n\nSuarez de Maruelas, Hernan. After surviving Florida, Suarez became so well known in Mexico that his son-in-law, Pedro Pérez de Zamora, used him as a reference when requesting a royal favor in 1582. Attached to this document there is a probanza made by Suarez in Mexico in 1572. There he requested witnesses to testify if they knew him, including his father and mother, Hernan Suarez de Maruelas and Ines de Valgrande, citizens of Villanueva de la Serena in the kingdom of Castilla. Also, whether the witnesses knew that in 1537 he had gone to Florida with Hernando de Soto, a venture which lasted five years and ended in New Spain. In this viceroyalty he served well in the pacification of the natives of Oaxaca. In 1552, Suarez took part in some military actions in Yucatán and Golfo Dulce, in the latter as Lieutenant-Governor. While imprisoned in Honduras, up to 80 of his men rebelled and took the Royal Treasury. Finally, in 1553, he returned to Mexico, where he was well received by Viceroy Velasco, who provided for him. In 1554, after other services in New Spain and to the Audiencia of Confines, he married Ursula de Grijalva, daughter of one of the conquerors of Mexico, Sebastian de Grijalva. It should be noted that this document contains interesting descriptions of some of the actions that took place in Florida during the de Soto expedition, especially around Mobila, Chicasa and Tascalusa. [133] Suarez was listed by his second last name as the son of Hernando Mazuelas and Ines de Valgrando, citizens of Villanueva de la Serena, SR-302. There is a Mazuelas in the list of survivors of Hernández de Biedma, who may be the same person, Smith-294.\n\nTapia. A survivor who appears to be different from the Francisco de Tapia who follows since this one is listed as being from Castilla la Vieja, Smith-296. This conqueror could be Diego de Tapia, of whom Garcilaso de la Vega wrote. Shortly after the Florida survivors arrived in Mexico from Pánuco, \"A soldier named Diego de Tapia (whom I knew afterward in Peru where he served His Majesty well in the wars against Gonzalo Pizarro, Don Sebastian de Castilla and Francisco Hernández Giron), while having clothes made for him, walked through the city of Mexico dressed in nothing but skins.\" [134]\n\nTapia Maraver, Francisco de. Witness in the probanza of Pedro Arevalo in 1558 in Cuzco, Peru, where Tapia then resided. This survivor went to Florida via Cuba with Hernando de Soto where they disembarked at the port of Espíritu Santo. After de Soto died, Luis de Moscoso took command of the army and led them to Mexico. No indication is given as to when Tapia moved to Peru. He declared himself to be 35 years old and signed his testimony. [135] This man seems to be the son of Alonso Malaver and Ines de Tapia, citizens of Zafra, SR-310. Hernández de Biedma lists, among the survivors, a Francisco de Tapia, from Zafra, who appears to be the same person, Smith-294.\n\nTiedra, Miguel de. In Puebla de los Angeles, Mexico, Tiedra was called to testify in the probanza of Juan de Añasco, treasurer of the de Soto expedition. In 1544 in that city, Tiedra declared he lived there and that he was born in 1517. He added that he had known Añasco since 1539 and that he was familiar with the lands of Florida. He answered positively all the questions posed by Añasco, several referring to his actions in Florida. Tiedra signed his declaration. [136] He is listed as the son of Gabriel de Tiedra and Ana Martin, citizens from Salamanca, SR-319. One of the survivors was a Tiedra from Salamanca, Smith-296.\n\nTinoco, Arias. Another conqueror who lived in Mexico after the Florida adventure. There he testified in the probanza of Juan de Añasco in 1544. He was born before 1504 and had known Añasco since 1537. He had followed him to Florida, disembarking in the port previously selected by Añasco. He witnessed many of Anasco's services during that expedition, especially on an occasion when Añasco saved the army from hunger by finding the town of Aymay which contained large stores of grain. He witnessed, as well, the diligence and effective participation of Añasco in the construction of the ships that were to take the Florida survivors to Pánuco in New Spain. He was in one of the five ships which sailed upriver to reach that port. He saw too, that the only possession that Añasco was able to save from the Florida experience was one slave. He signed his deposition. [137] Tinoco was a son of Gutierre Garcia Cardenosa and Maria Romo, citizens of Badajoz, SR-281. He is listed among the survivors of Florida, as son of Cardenosa, from Badajoz, Smith-293. It should be noted that the complete name of the Adelantado of Florida was Hernando Mendez de Soto y Gutierrez Cardenosa. Tinoco's parents last names suggest a kinship with the Adelantado. Arias Tinoco, who was a captain of cavalry, was accompanied by two brothers who survived the expedition as well, Alonso Romo and Diego Tinoco, considered here in their proper order.\n\nTinoco, Diego. Son of Gutierre Garcia Cardenosa and Maria Romo, citizens of Badajoz, SR-281. He was a brother of Arias Tinoco and survived the Florida expedition, Smith-293.\n\nTolosa. A survivor from Vizcaya, Smith-297.\n\nTorre, Alvaro de la. On October 25th, 1559, Mexican Viceroy Luis de Velasco wrote to Florida explorer, Tristan de Luna y Arellano. He informed Luna that he was sending a memoir written by Alvaro de la Torre, \"the cleric who was with de Soto in Florida.\" [138] It is clear from the content of this message that the Viceroy was writing about someone he and Luna knew well. Alvaro de la Torre could be the sixth chronicler of the de Soto expedition after the Gentleman of Elvas, Rodrigo Rangel, Luis Hernandez de Biedma, Garcilaso de la Vega, and Cañete. This cleric appears distinct from Fray Francisco de la Torre described later. While Alvaro gave his memoir to the Viceroy, most likely in Mexico, Francisco may have stayed in Spain, where he went after the Florida expedition.\n\nTorres, Alonso de. A survivor from Ubeda or Baeza, Smith-296.\n\nTorres, Fray Francisco de. Priest from the Order of the Holy Trinity, who met de Soto in 1538 and who was born around 1515. He testified in Madrid in 1546 that he accompanied de Soto to Florida and that the latter died on the 21st day of May 1542, in the province of Guachoya, near the Espíritu Santo River. He signed his deposition. [139] He is probably one of the three surviving priests listed in Smith-298.\n\nTorres, Manuel. Son of Francisco de Torres and Catalina Garcia, citizens of Badajoz, SR-301. A survivor from Portugal, Smith-298.\n\nTorres, Pedro de. Son of Alonso Martin and Elvira de Torres, citizens of Medina del Campo, SR-296. Listed as a survivor, Smith-296.\n\nTorres, Sancho de. Son of Sancho Martinez de Torres and Elvira Sanchez Guerra, residents of Quintanilla de Pienzo, SR-300. Survivor from Castilla la Vieja, Smith-297.\n\nTristan. From Sevilla, an individual who survived the Florida expedition, Smith-292.\n\nTrujillo, Baltasar de. Son of Miguel de Trujillo and Maria de Villalobos, from Sevilla, SR-317. This man may be the same Trujillo from Sevilla listed as a survivor in Smith-292.\n\nValderas. A survivor from León, Smith-297.\n\nValdivieso, Luis de. This survivor testified, in Mexico, that he was originally from Salamanca and presently was a resident of Pánuco. He was the legitimate son of Joan Velazquez and Maria Valdivieso, servants of the Catholic Kings and went to Florida with de Soto. He married a daughter of Pedro Carranza, a conqueror from New Spain. [140]\n\nValtierra, Pedro de. Son of Pedro Martinez and Catalina de Valtierra, citizens of León, SR-301. Valtierra is listed as a survivor from Castilla la Vieja, Smith-297.\n\nVargas, Juan de. Son of Hernando de Vargas and Ines Alvarez de Balboa, citizens of Burguillos, SR-296. Vargas from Burguillos is one of two survivors listed with this last name in Smith-294.\n\nVazquez, Alonso. A native of the city of Jerez who made his probanza in nearby Badajoz on June 12, 1560. From the interrogatory he presented, the following information has been obtained. [141] In 1538 Vazquez left Spain for the discovery and conquest of Florida in the armada of Hernando de Soto. Also, that the Adelantado debarked at Santiago de Cuba and there, and in Havana, spent a year in preparation. Further, that Vazquez went to Florida as a captain and, after debarking, was given command of up to 80 men. After twelve days in the port he went with Captain Baltasar Gallegos on the first entry made in the country while de Soto and most of the army remained behind. Later, they went to the province of Paracuxi which they found inhabited, and heard that it was a country abundant in food. But, to the contrary, all men, among them Alonso and his brother Rodrigo Vazquez, suffered great hunger for a month and lived on nothing but the green stalks of maize. Marching through that country they arrived at a marsh that took three days, without food, to cross, finally arriving at the province of Ocal. De Soto, intent on reconnoitering the country, left Luis de Moscoso in command of the camp and, with Vazquez, explored the area. In Mauvila the formerly peaceful Indians killed 15 or 20 men and wounded 150. In breaking down the palisade, where they were in strength, Vazquez was wounded in an ankle making him lame for a year. At Tula, he and two other soldiers held off attacking Indians until a Captain Vasconcelos and the calvary arrived. In Chicazuela, in another affray on a savanna, he served courageously. After he came with the survivors to Mexico, dressed in skins, he and his brother Rodrigo made preparations to go to the aid of President de la Gasca in Peru. He was in the conquest of Florida from the beginning to the end. Alonso Vazquez, a brother of Rodrigo Alvarez, was a survivor according to Smith-293. If true, Alonso was a son of Andres Vazquez and Leónor Rodriguez, citizens of Zafra. Jerez and Zafra are not more than 25 miles apart. Hernandez de Biedma, however, may be in error when he stated that Alonso was a brother of Rodrigo Alvarez, confusing him with Rodrigo Vazquez. Remember that this same Alonso Vazquez said that his brother was Rodrigo Vazquez, not Alvarez. See Rodrigo Vazquez's biography for more information.\n\nVazquez, Francisco. Son of Alonso Vazquez Caballero and Catalina Botello, citizens of Villanueva de Barcarrota, SR-332. He was a survivor from Jerez or Villanueva, Smith-293.\n\nVazquez, Francisco. Son of Anton Vazquez and Maria Vazquez, from Villanueva de Barcarrota, SR-295. Another survivor different from the preceding, according to Smith-293.\n\nVazquez, Gonzalo. A resident of Jerez de Badajoz, Spain, and a dweller in the town of Matamoros, when, in June 1560, he testified in the probanza of Alonso Vazquez, and stated that they were not related. Answering the questions presented to him, Gonzalo testified that he was 54 years of age and had known Alonso for about the last twenty years. The former was in Santiago de Cuba and later in Florida when all landed along with Hernando de Soto. He went with Baltasar de Gallegos and with other soldiers to a country called Paracoxi, in Florida. Alonso Vazquez was with them with his brother Rodrigo. They all endured the lack of food and on one occasion, they ate nothing but stalks of corn, boiled or uncooked. After leaving Florida, they arrived in Mexico clothed in skins. When de la Gasca, President of Peru, called for help, Gonzalo saw Alonso and Rodrigo enlist, after having invested much money in their equipment. He signed his deposition. [142] In 1547 Gonzalo testified in the suit between Hernando Ponce de León and Isabel de Bobadilla. He repeated that he was part of the Florida expedition and, at the time of his declaration, a resident of Villanueva de Barcarrota. [143] This conqueror seems to be the same son of Gonzalo Vazquez and Catalina Vazquez, residents of Villanueva de Barcarrota, SR-332. He is listed as well in Smith-293.\n\nVazquez, Hernan. This survivor declared, in the city of Mexico in 1557, that he was 35 years old and had been in the Florida expedition led by de Soto. He signed his testimony. [144] Twelve years later Hernan was still living in Mexico, where he reiterated having explored Florida and, after de Soto's death, having gone to Mexico under the leadership of Luis de Moscoso. [145] He appears to be the son of Mateo Garcia and Juana Rodriguez, citizens of Badajoz, SR-285.\n\nVazquez, Rodrigo. Contrary to what was stated in the probanza of Alonso Vazquez that after Florida he went to Mexico and Peru, it appears that Rodrigo stayed in Mexico. This would be more accurate, unless Rodrigo was not Vazquez but Alvarez, as stated by Hernandez de Biedma, who seems to be in error. Rodrigo made his probanza in Mexico in 1554. He asked the witnesses to declare if the following was true. That he and his brother Alonso Vazquez were born in the city of Jerez near Badajoz. That he came to the Indies in the armada of de Soto, which sailed from the port of San Lucar de Barrameda, and arrived at Santiago de Cuba in 1538. That he and the other soldiers of the expedition stayed on that island for a year prior to leaving for Florida, where Rodrigo served for five years. That his brother Alonso was a leader of soldiers under Juan Ruiz Lobillo until wounded in an ankle, at which time Rodrigo took command of his brother's troops. That the witness knew that around 1542 he, Rodrigo, went to Mexico. Finally, Vazquez asked the witnesses to affirm that he was an hidalgo of good repute and honor. [146] As has been noted in their respective probanzas, Rodrigo Vazquez and Alonso Vazquez both declared that they were brothers and survivors of the Florida expedition. On the other hand, Hernandez de Biedma and Solar and Rújula, agree on the existence of a Rodrigo Alvarez, son of Andres Vasquez and Leónor Rodriguez. No Rodrigo Vazquez is mentioned by these last two sources. It may be that Rodrigo Vazquez and Rodrigo Alvarez are the same person. If this is the case, I have made a duplicate entry here.\n\nVega, Andres de. When Gonzalo Silvestre, one of de Soto's soldiers, made his probanza in Valladolid, Spain, in 1558, he asked Andres de Vega to testify in his behalf. Vega did so, first stating that he was 42 years old and had known Silvestre since 1538. He continued that he went from Spain to Florida in de Soto's armada and that they explored that land for several years. After having lost more than 300 men and 150 horses, the survivors built seven brigantines in which they reached Pánuco. From there he continued to the city of Mexico and then to Peru. In the latter he served for several years, especially with Captain Diego Centeno against the rebel Gonzalo Pizarro. Later, he took part in the battle of Xaquixaguana where that rebel was vanquished and killed. From Peru he returned to Spain where he remained. He signed his testimony. [147] Andres de Vega is listed as a son of Juan de Vega and Isabel Gutierre, citizens of Caceres, SR-325.\n\nVega, Hernando de. Son of Juan de Vega and Catalina Pinel, from Jerez near Badajoz, SR-300. A survivor from Badajoz, listed by Smith-293.\n\nVega, Juan de. This survivor arrived in Havana with de Soto. When they were together in Florida he saw de Soto's very good Peruvian tent. He made and signed a declaration in 1547 in Mexico City and added that he had been born in Badajoz around 1515. [148] Juan de Vega was a son of Gonzalo Tellez de Vega and Juana Tellez, citizens of Badajoz, SR-300. He is listed in Smith-293.\n\nVelasco. A survivor from Castilla la Vieja, Smith-296.\n\nVelazquez, Antonio. Son of Juan Velazquez de Robledo and Maria Espes, citizens of Valladolid, SR-316. Antonio Velazquez is listed as a survivor from the mountains, or a foreigner, Smith-298. In Mexico City he testified that he was an hijodalgo born in Cuellar, the son of Joan Velazquez and Marina Corral. He added that he had served the King in Italy for ten years before going to Florida. He was married and intended to remain in Mexico. [149] In spite of the differences between the first and the third Antonio Velazquez mentioned here, they appear to be the same person. Both are sons of a Juan Velazquez and a Maria or Marina and both are from the Valladolid area, since Cuellar is quite near that city. The differences in the names of Velazquez's mother could be due in part to an inaccurate transcription or to the not uncommon sixteenth century practice of calling a person by their first or second last names. Thus, Maria or Marina could be Espes Corral or Corral Espes. The remaining doubt is if the Velazquez listed by Hernandez de Biedma as from the mountains or a foreigner, is indeed the same person as the Velazquez from Valladolid.\n\nVelazquez, Diego. A son of Fernando Velazquez and Mari Alonso, citizens of Oropesa, SR-326. A survivor from Castilla la Vieja, Smith-296. This Oropesa could be the one in the vicinity of Talavera.\n\nVerdejon. A survivor from Toledo, Smith-295.\n\nVerdugo, Pedro. Son of Alvaro Verdugo and Catalina Alvarez, citizens of Camisal, or Cañizal, SR-316. Verdugo is listed as a survivor from Castilla la Vieja, in which district Canizal is located, Smith-296.\n\nVillagarcia. "
