        "text": "Just like Jamaica last year, Steve & I this year traveled to a place we never thought we’d go: Costa Rica. We honestly never had a desire to visit Central America; it simply had no appeal for either of us. However, when Dad proposed this trip as a way for the whole family (Mom, Dad, three daughters, three sons-in-law, two grandsons) together to go someplace new and celebrate Older Nephew‘s graduation, what were we to say?\n\nSure, Dad. We’re in.\n\nSo, tickets were bought last September, a house was rented for a week, and activities studied and contemplated by one and all. And, since Dad and my younger sister, Danyah (mother of the nephews/grandsons) had already visited Costa Rica, the rest of us relied on them for advice and travel tips. They also unsuccessfully tried convince everyone to go zip lining.\n\nFor those of you who don’t know too much about Costa Rica, I’m going to attempt to give you a quick primer: Costa Rica is in the southern part of Central America between Nicaragua and Panama. Because it’s less than 700 miles due north from the Equator, the climate is tropical year-round (basically, it has two seasons – wet and dry). It’s sandwiched between the Caribbean on the eastern shore, the Pacific on the western shore, and a whole lot of tropical rain and humid forests with a few arid areas in between. The daylight and nighttime hours are split almost evenly (the sun would rise at about 6am and set about 5:30-6pm). More than one-third of the country has been placed under some sort of environmental protection, making it one of the most bio-diverse nations on Earth. In fact, in 2012, it had the highest environmental ranking of all the Americas.\n\nThe economy of Costa Rica has hit a rough patch over the last 3 – 4 years, but it is still one of the strongest in the Central American region. Its main economic sources are tourism (especially eco-tourism), electronics (mostly cash registers and calculators), and agriculture (bananas, coffee, sugar, rice, ornamental plants, potatoes, etc.).\n\nCosta Rica was believed to be first inhabited about 10,000 years BCE by peoples from the Mesoamerican and Andean regions, and was still sparsely populated by its indigenous people (namely the Bribri and Maleku) before coming under Spanish rule in the 1560’s. It remained an outer colony of the Spanish Empire until independence as part of the First Mexican Empire (1821-23), followed by membership in the United Provinces of Central America (1823-1840; several more attempts were made to continue the union until 1885), from which it formally declared sovereignty in 1847. Following a brief but bloody civil war in 1948, it permanently abolished its army in 1949, becoming one of the few world nations with no standing army.\n\nEven after Costa Rica gained its independence from Spain and declared full sovereignty in 1847, years of invasion, American colonialism – both political and economic, yellow fever, dictatorship, and civil wars, it finally becomes a democratic nation in 1949 when then-president Josè Figueres Ferrer (father of Costa Rica’s “unarmed” democracy) declared a new constitution that granted full citizenship and voting rights to women and minorities. He also created the foundation for the country’s modern welfare state. Indigenous peoples were finally granted rights of ownership in 1977, and the right to vote in 1994. However, the indigenous populations, like many in all of the Americas, still have their issues with the federal government taking over historically treatied lands and ignoring articles of protection.\n\nIn 1986, president Óscar Arias Sánchez, fully asserted Costa Rican independence by forcing out the Nicaraguan Contras the United States basically foisted upon his predecessor, Luís Alberto Monge, by again raising the banner of sovereignty and neutrality, and essentially drove them out of Costa Rica. Sánchez won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for uniting Central America and helping end the Nicaraguan War.\n\nAs it stands now, Costa Rica (literal translation: “Rich Coast”) is a green peaceful paradise with amazing wildlife, delicious food, wonderful people, and, as the Ticos like to say, “la pura vida”.\n\nDay 1 – Monday, July 6\n\nTravel Day.\n\nSteve & I drove to my parents on Sunday to be in full readiness for our 6am Monday flight. We had to leave the house by 4am so we could be at DFW Airport and at check-in by 4:30. As part of my over-anxiousness with anything having to do with air travel, I went ahead and checked Steve & I in online the day before. Dad parked in remote parking and so we hiked to the shuttle station for a ride to the terminal. We met up there with Sister Danyah’s crew. I couldn’t even see the airport from the parking lot. That’s when I decided I really do prefer smaller airports. That’s when I also realized I’d overpacked. Again.\n\nAfter Steve & I checked our bags – and paying the additional $25 per – we headed to security leaving Mom & Dad with Danyah’s (Husband Heath, Older Son/Grandson/Nephew, and Younger Son/Grandson/Nephew) family to do their check-in. (Sister Haneen and Husband Mark were flying from Newark to meet up with us in Miami.)\n\nWe all kind of gathered again near the gate and then spread out to forage for caffeine and a breakfast-type snack. One of the few caffeine sellers open was Starbucks (ugh), so Steve got us each a beverage. Coffee for him, hot chocolate for me.\n\nFinally, we all boarded. I distinctly felt like I was being herded onto a cattle truck. Only with a little extra leg room that I paid for and a cubby for my camera equipment. Not long after we had settled in, I heard from Danyah a couple of rows up that Haneen & Mark were delayed out of Newark at least 2 hours due to mechanical issues with their plane. Dad tried to contact them, but, no answer. Family theories started to make their way around. Dad basically said there was nothing anyone could do about it and he’d try to get in touch with them when we arrived in Miami.\n\nAfter getting a lecture from the flight attendant about sitting in the exit row (Yes. I can open the exit door. Trust me, I’ll be the first one out.), I, for grins, took a look at the in-flight menu.\n\nAfter this, the Dramamine took over and I essentially fell asleep until we landed in Miami.\n\nMom & Dad rushed off the plane to try to contact Haneen & Mark to check on their progress. The rest of us finally made our way off and headed to the next terminal and gate. (I have to say, Miami Airport is one of the most disorganized and confusing I’ve ever been through, and I’ve been through a lot of airports.)\n\nWhen Mom & Dad finally caught up with us, they said they hadn’t been able to reach Haneen & Mark. Dad theorized that they likely caught a flight from Newark to Charlotte and then were going to meet us in San José. We all went with that; it sounded plausible.\n\nAfter everyone had boarded, it was plain to see that it wasn’t a full flight. Once we were at cruising altitude, I moved over across to the aisle seat so I would feel like I had some breathing and spreading room (I was assigned the middle seat both flights). Bliss. Between dozing, reading, and talking to my sister, the flight was tolerable.\n\nFinally, we landed in San José. Because our flight was early, we had to wait on the tarmac for 20 minutes before the plane was assigned a gate; I always figured this was planned somewhat in advance.\n\nWhile we were waiting, the family grapevine passed the message that Haneen & Mark were only about 30 minutes behind us. They’d managed to re-book and be on their way sooner than we thought. Whew.\n\nThen, there was passport control.\n\nAfter queueing for 30 minutes, we discover that the flight attendant had given us the wrong forms to fill out. Or, rather, she had switched them – the family form and the immigration form. Hooray.\n\nAfter the re-filling of the forms in the correct way and number and getting the passports stamped, we all met up at baggage claim where the bags were all neatly arranged and waiting for us. But, before we could leave the baggage area, one more security check. Just our luck, we were stuck behind a family who didn’t seem to know what they were doing; it was like they couldn’t figure out how to put their bags on the conveyor belt. Even Dad, the family model of patience, was about to lose it. Then, the other line cleared out and we took our opportunity. The entire Arafat clan got through while the other family was still plodding along.\n\nMom volunteered to wait in the security area for Haneen & Mark, but we persuaded her to go out with us; there was only one way out, so we decided they would figure out where to go.\n\nDad found our driver, Estilio, and enlisted him and everyone except he & Mom to take the luggage to the van that was going to take us on the 3-hour drive to Quepos.\n\nMy first impression of Costa Rica was green. So very green. The humidity hit me next. Then, the rain (we were there during the rainy season). However, despite being at the airport, the air still felt fresh and clean. Perhaps that was simply my brain fooling itself after being in airports and planes for the past 12 hours.\n\nWhile we waited for the other two (Dad received continual updates on their progress), Danyah & I wandered a little.\n\nFinally, after more than an hour of waiting, Haneen & Mark walk through the doors. And the rejoicing begins. However, Mark’s luggage had gone missing and he arrived with only his guitar in hand. The airline assured them that his bags would be delivered via courier the next day at the house in Quepos.\n\nAh… The joys of travel.\n\nMom & Dad finally rounded up the crew and we headed up to the van and Estilio. Dad asked him to stop somewhere for all of us to get something to eat since none of us had really eaten anything substantial since… a while ago. When Estilio asked him what we’d like, Dad said Costa Rican. Hell, we may as well plunge in.\n\nEstilio took us to a restaurant in San José that was probably the best meal we had the entire trip – La Casona del Maíz (The House of Corn).\n\nLa Casona was a large, open-air restaurant with plenty of room to spread out. It seemed like it was built to blend into the landscape it adjoined. The rain had cooled the air, and while it was humid, the cooler temperature made it tolerable. The air circulation was certainly welcome.\n\nNot long after we sat down, our server took our drink order (her in broken English, most of us in broken Spanish) and then she brought a couple of jars of some of the best pickled vegetables I’ve ever eaten. I ate a lot of the cauliflower out of the jar at my end of the table. It was just the right balance of tart and spicy. I’d like to think that they make these in-house.\n\nNot long after we ordered our food, it started coming to the table.\n\nWow. Was it good. Better than good – amazing.\n\nWe came to the collective decision that if all the food in Costa Rica was as good as this, we were in for a great time.\n\nWhile everyone was taking turns using the restroom, the rest of us stretched and wandered around the restaurant and simply took in the scenery.\n\nSoon, we were all back in the van to Quepos. It’s only about 60km (about 38 miles) from San José if you go as the crow flies; but, because the only straight road is the Pan-American Highway, it’s really about 160km (about 100 miles) and takes about 2 – 3 hours to drive to Quepos. Most of the roads in Costa Rica, despite its excellent infrastructure, are small, winding, 2-lane affairs where you’re at the mercy of whatever is in the road and whomever is in front of you. I do have to give credit to the scooter and motorcycle drivers – they were a daring bunch of souls.\n\nAs everyone was conversing, dozing, or looking out the windows, we all began to notice that it was already getting dark, despite the fact it was only about 5pm. Certainly not something any of us expected. I can only speak for myself, but I suddenly felt very tired.\n\nAs we passed over a bridge, we noticed a large number of people looking over into the water. Estilio pulled over and told us that it was the Río Tarcoles and there were about 30 American Crocodiles living under the bridge. Who were we to say no to this.\n\nAfter carefully walking either on the edge of the road or on the bridge walkway, there they were. In all their glory. And, because the weather was beginning to cool a little and it was getting dark, they were becoming more active.\n\nAfter this little stop, we climbed back into the van and finished our journey to Quepos. It was fairly uneventful but it felt very long. I think everyone wanted just to get to the house. However, before we made it to the house, we had one more stop to make. We were meeting our property manager and local contact, Ana. Dad paid her for the week of our stay, got some paperwork, and we asked her a few basic questions about what we were to expect.\n\nThere was a full stocked kitchen equipment-wise, but we had to buy food. There was a laundry room and we could use their detergent. The maids come every day. There was air conditioning in the bedrooms. She and Estilio suggested that we go to the supermercado Maxi Palí to stock up on what we needed.\n\nWe didn’t see Ana again after that stop, but we talked to her quite frequently on the phone for the rest of the trip.\n\nWhen we finally made it into Quepos, it was completely dark and only about 6:30. It felt so much later. Estilio pulled into the Maxi Palí parking lot and we all piled out. I have to say, trying to keep up with 10 people in a grocery store is like herding cats.\n\nWe stocked up on vegetables, fruit, cheese, bread, peanut butter, Nutella, Fresca, water, coffee, tea, sugar, lentils, eggs, tortillas, butter, juice, milk, the Costa Rican equivalent of Cheetos Puffs, a couple of shirts for Mark, and various OTC drugs. The guys also grabbed what they thought was a pound of bacon. (When I went to cook it a few days later, I noticed it was a kilo [2.2 lbs.].)\n\nFinally, we made it to the house. Estilio had a little trouble finding it in the dark. The place we stayed was a gated community with no outside lighting. So, if one was unfamiliar with the roads, it was easy to get lost. Plus, to compound things, the hills felt like they were at a 45-degree angle. After a couple of aborted attempts, Estilio finally found the house – Happy Jacana.\n\nI can’t remember who got the door unlocked, but I know I was one of the first in and managed to find the light switch in the pitch dark. Upon first glance, the house looked lovely, if a little stuffy, climate-wise. But, whatever; we just wanted to get the van unloaded, stake out our rooms, get the groceries put away, and go to bed.\n\nThere were two bedrooms in the main house while the rest of them were either separate or on a different level. Mom & Dad and Steve & I took the bedrooms in the main house; because, you know, we could. So, while Steve took our bags upstairs, Mom tasked me with putting away the groceries. Then, she took her & Dad’s bags up to their room while Dad helped everyone else find their rooms. It wasn’t easy in an unfamiliar house in the dark. I think it took close to an hour for everyone to find and pick their rooms and get settled in.\n\nAs for putting away the groceries, I put everything I could in the refrigerator when I noticed the various ant trails in the house.\n\nWell, I figured, we’re in the tropics; not much we can do about the ants. Besides, the house geckos seemed to be enjoying their feast.\n\nI think we were all in bed by 8:30-ish. Collective exhaustion had taken over.\n\nBut, just when we thought the fun was over, a transformer blew somewhere nearby and the electricity went out in the neighborhood about 9pm. I could hear Dad stumbling downstairs to call Ana. Whatever she managed to do, it worked. The electricity was back on by 11pm. Thank goodness. I was about to give up and go sleep by the pool. To hell with the bugs and whatever animals might wander by.\n\n(A couple of notes here: a) We decided early on in the planning of this trip that everyone would do their own thing; we couldn’t and/or wouldn’t all be joined at the collective hip. I’m basically writing about what I, and those who were with me for various excursions, did during the trip; b) Also, because I can’t possibly write about what everyone ate every time we were together, I’m writing about my meals and, again, those who were with me or sitting near me in the restaurants or at the house.)\n\nDay 2 – Tuesday, July 7\n\nA little about Quepos: It is basically considered the gateway to Manuel Antonio National Park (7km – about 4-1/2 mi.) and is known for the abundance of sport fishing in the area. The town itself has a population of less than 30,000. The town is in the Central Pacific Region on the Pacific Coast and is the administrative center of the Puntarenas Province.\n\nQuepos is a fairly small town that has managed, for the most part, to keep a decent balance between the needs of the local citizens and tourists. The town is laid out, grid-like, and, while there are no street signs, is still easy to get around if you simply pay attention to the landmarks. It’s not the most picturesque place, but, the locals are friendly, the food and nightlife are great, and it was within walking distance from our house.\n\nThere was one main road that ran in front of the gates of our enclave – go right, Quepos; left, the road to Manuel Antonio. Most of the higher-priced restaurants, hotels, and general tourist stuff was on this road. For the most part, we opted to stay and do business in Quepos.\n\nI was fully awake by 5:30am. I went downstairs figuring that I might be the first one or just my mom. Nope. Mom, Danyah, and Haneen were all downstairs already. I think we all silently decided to enjoy quiet conversation for as long as we could because, when the menfolk decided to stir, quiet would be over for the day.\n\nAfter my breakfast of green tea and peanut butter on toast, I went back upstairs to grab my camera and get my first real photos of the landscape around our rented house.\n\nAt this point, it was about 7:30 – 8am and just about everyone else was up and moving. Breakfast was (as it was most days) a fend-for-yourself affair. I was pretty obsessive about making sure the kitchen stayed as clean as possible because of the ants. Once everyone started throwing out their trash, the ants tended to congregate around the trash can. I was content to let them have at it if it kept them out of the rest of the kitchen.\n\nAfter breakfast, Younger Nephew and I decided to have a look around in front.\n\nI’m no botanist, but I know what I like, plant-wise. And just like in Jamaica, I remembered my love and enjoyment of tropical plants in Costa Rica.\n\nAfter I took the picture of the Monkey Comb fruit, I saw my first Iguana in the wild. I was so excited, I wanted to get my wide angle lens. I wasn’t paying attention and walked right on into the wrong house. Luckily, they were nice about it after I apologized profusely. I told them there was an Iguana on their roof and I was just going to grab a piece of camera equipment so I could get a better shot. They came out with one of their children and had a look. It was then that I took my opportunity to get the shot and sneak off.\n\nYounger Nephew was just standing there. Smiling. Punk.\n\nWhen I went back to the correct house, I went to the back balcony again and chatted some more with Mom and whoever else was out there. Then, Mom saw it. A huge Iguana in the trees perfectly in our line of sight. She went to get her binoculars so we could all get a better look.\n\nIt was a large male Green Iguana out for a little morning sun and to, I presume, survey his kingdom.\n\nIt was time to get ready. Danyah, Dad, Heath, Older Nephew, Younger Nephew, and I were all heading to the beach at Manuel Antonio. Our original plan was to go to the beach in the park; however, when we arrived, the line for tickets was crazy long. Plus, we had no idea that we would have to pay $15 a head to get in just to go the beach. So, we asked our driver to turn around and take us back the public beach next door. It was lovely and free.\n\nSo, with a promise to pick us up at 11:30, the driver dropped us off.\n\nPlaya Espadilla (also known as Manuel Antonio Beach #2) is a large beach with a mix of dark gray and yellow sand. It’s popular with locals and tourists alike. There were vendors walking around hocking everything from pottery to coconut water still in the nut. The beach wasn’t too crowded and the rain held off, so it made for a pleasant morning.\n\nSwimming in the ocean isn’t something I do often. I had to remember to keep my mouth shut so I wouldn’t swallow a bunch of salt water every time a wave hit.\n\nAlso, my attempts at body surfing were unsuccessful.\n\nAs always, I wandered a bit. I was done swimming for the time being. Plus, I was starting to feel a little sick from the sea water I swallowed.\n\nNot long after this, Heath came out of the water to rest – the boys refused to came out of the water until we basically forced them to right before the taxi arrived. Dad, Danyah, and I took a walk around the beach.\n\nWhile the others were packing up our belongings, I ventured back into the ocean to get the Nephews. They weren’t too thrilled about having to actually get back on dry land. We probably could’ve left them there and it would’ve taken them hours to notice.\n\nSo, back to the house to clean the beach sand off of weird places on one’s body and rinse out the swimsuits.\n\nFor our first full day in Costa Rica, it was decided that we’d go into Quepos for lunch. I don’t think we really had a plan; just find a place that looked good. We came upon a restaurant called Restaurante el Jardin del Mar (essentially “Restaurant Garden of the Sea). The food there was good and there was a lot of it. The restaurant wasn’t large, but it was open-air, and great for people-watching.\n\nAfter lunch, there was the usual debate when you’re with a large group as to what everyone was going to do next. While this was happening, Steve and Haneen went onto a nearby book and record store. About 10 minutes later, they came back and told Mom and I about a tour at a spice plantation on Wednesday. I must have given Steve a look of pure joy, because he said “I can tell by the look on your face, you’re in”. Haneen went back to the store and booked Mom, Dad, Steve, herself, and me on the tour.\n\nAfter this, I, Mom, Heath, and I can’t remember who else, decided to take the taxi back to the house while everyone else stayed in town for a little longer.\n\nLater in the afternoon, this happened. A small show was put on for us by the local family of Red Back Squirrel Monkeys. We were told that there was a good chance we would see some monkeys during our stay. The best thing to do was just watch them and stay out of their way. Don’t engage or feed them. They bite.\n\nI didn’t do much the rest of the day. I swam a little in the pool, read, rested, and was generally quiet. Dinner was a fend-for-yourself event. In fact, I’m not even sure I ate dinner.\n\nDay 3 – Wednesday, 7/8\n\nMom, Dad, Haneen, Steve, and I were outside waiting before 9am for the bus to take us to our tour to Villa Vanilla. And, we waited. at about 9:15-ish, Haneen went back inside to call the tour operator to see what was up. Turned out there was a small strike among taxi drivers that day because the government reneged on a promised salary hike. But, once our bus picked up some of the other tour attendees and made it through the traffic, they’d be by to pick us up.\n\nWell, fine.\n\nSo, in the meantime, we entertained ourselves.\n\nFinally, the bus arrived and we were on our way. There were about a dozen more people joining us on the tour.\n\nThe trip to Villa Vanilla took about 45 minutes. It’s only about 16km/10 miles way from Quepos, but once you’re outside of the main town and on the way to Naranjito, the roads become a little less vehicle-friendly.\n\nWe arrived at the plantation and were greeted by our guide for the day, Giselle. She was wonderful. The first thing she did was take us to a small building on the property to show us how the process the cinnamon, vanilla beans, and, unexpectedly, cocoa beans and turmeric.\n\nThe cinnamon trees they grow are ones that produce Ceylon cinnamon (the kind we know more here in the US is Cassia). Ceylon cinnamon is finer in texture and sweeter than cassia cinnamon. (Giselle kept calling it “true cinnamon”.) Both are from the second layer of tree bark, but the cassia is much more dense and hard. (Here in the US, you can find Ceylon cinnamon at Mexican/Latin markets. It’s labeled “canela”.)\n\nCinnamon trees grow in the tropics and it takes 8 years before a tree is ready to be harvested. The outer bark is scraped off and the inner (second) layer of bark (the cinnamon) is then carefully shaved off, dried, and stored. The remaining wood is used for firewood and/or made into charcoal that they use at the plantation.\n\nAfter the cinnamon lecture was over, Giselle opened up the ovens for us so we could see what they were currently drying: cinnamon, cayenne peppers, and turmeric.\n\nThe next thing she talked about was cacao. They don’t grow enough on the farm for it to be commercially viable for them except as ground cocoa. Which is too bad, because we each got a small sample of how good their chocolate can be.\n\nAfter the cocoa, Giselle started talking to us about vanilla beans. We quickly learned why they are so expensive.\n\nThe vanilla vine takes 2 years to become mature enough to grow the flowers needed for pollination. Because the flowers are only open for a few hours (3-4) one time, hand-pollinating is necessary to make sure that there will be a crop. This is done by running a small, thin stick through the pollen and then fertilizing another flower. Once the fruit begins to grow, it takes 6 months for it to come to full maturity. The immature pods are dark green; the pods are picked when there is dark yellow coloration at the tip of the pod and it begins to split slightly. At this point, the harvest is continual to be sure that the pods are picked before they over-ripen.\n\nOnce the pods are picked, the drying process takes 2 months and then the pods are aged for 1 year before they are packaged and sold.\n\nGiselle said that the pods will last for 60 (yes – 6.0.) years if they are kept in a sealed glass jar in a dark, cook place.\n\nWhen we were done with the ripe beans, Giselle, now joined by her son, Roy, began the tour of the grounds.\n\nGiselle showed us a cocao tree growing in the front of the property. She explained that the pods aren’t ripe until they have turned yellow.\n\nWe began our journey through the rest of the plantation. It was dense with vegetation and wildlife. And, it was absolutely fascinating and beautiful.\n\nGiselle stopped at the composting shed to show us what they use around the plantation. It is the usual mix of dead vegetation, some shredded wood, and sheep manure.\n\nI did wonder what an immature one would be like. The thought did briefly cross my mind to pick and pocket one. Then, I thought the better of it.\n\nIt was at this point that I realized I had stopped listening to Giselle and became absorbed in taking photos. I honestly felt a little guilty.\n\nBut, Roy was there to help. Plus, I think he had a little crush on my sister.\n\nHere was a surprise. Allspice (Pimento) trees. Allspice is grown all over the Caribbean. We didn’t see any berries on the trees, but Giselle pulled a couple of leaves off the tree. They smelled like allspice, too. I certainly wasn’t expecting that.\n\nNext, we stopped by a pepper vine. I always thought peppercorns grew on bushes. She pulled off a bunch so each person could try a peppercorn.\n\nI find them to be far more spicy fresh than they are dried. I couldn’t finish mine.\n\nPeppercorns are green when they are harvested. After harvesting, the peppercorns are boiled briefly to clean them. The heat ruptures the outer membrane and this causes the peppercorns to turn black as they dry. White pepper comes from the outer husk being rubbed off. Green peppercorns retain their color with the addition of sulphur dioxide during the drying process. Green peppercorns can also be pickled. Pink peppercorns are actually members of the cashew family and generally aren’t considered to be real peppercorns. (Black pepper is part of the Piperaceae family.)\n\nAt the end of the tour, we were directed to a roofed, open-air seating area for a tasting. I don’t know if any of us knew about it so it was a wonderful surprise. All of the food either came from the farm or the nearby village.\n\nNext up came the biggest surprise of the tasting. Cinnamon Tea.\n\nIt was literally the cinnamon from the plantation steeped in water for 12 hours. We all thought it had sugar in it. Nope. No sugar. Giselle insisted that the type of cinnamon used makes all the difference.\n\nI will say right here that I am highly allergic to cinnamon. However, I really had to try this. While I didn’t have the reaction I was expecting, I did feel a little like I was on an alcohol buzz. It was a strange feeling.\n\nNext up, Giselle broke open a ripe cacao pod for everyone to try. it’s really hard to believe that these raw white beans would’ve eventually became really good chocolate.\n\nNext on the menu was a wonderful vanilla bean ice cream with a spicy chocolate cookie. Again, most, if not all, the ingredients were from the plantation.\n\nThen, there was vanilla bean cheesecake with a bit of unsweetened chocolate sauce on top. It was a lighter texture than I’m accustomed to; in other words, it wasn’t New York cheesecake.\n\nGiselle finished off the tasting with some unsweetened hot chocolate (we had our choice between regular and spicy cocoa [they put a bit of cayenne pepper in their spicy mix]) and a cocoa nib cookie. I think the cookie was everyone’s favorite.\n\nOnce the tasting was over, we all went (of course) to the gift shop where almost everyone stocked up on spices. I bought cinnamon sticks, cocoa, turmeric, cocoa nibs, cayenne peppers, and vanilla beans. I’m mot sure what Haneen or Mom bought, but I know Mom outbought me.\n\nUnfortunately, Villa Vanilla doesn’t have mail order. They only sell from the plantation or in a few towns nearby. They also supply some of the local restaurants.\n\nHuh. Now that I think about it, I wonder if it would be feasible for them to set up at the farmers market in Quepos. Or, if they even want to.\n\nOn the drive back, Mom & I decided that this was the best part of the trip. No matter what else we did, nothing would top this.\n\nWe were the first to be dropped off when the bus arrived back in Quepos. It was still fairly early in the day, so Haneen decided to do a little cooking so everyone could have some lunch. She made some egg salad, tuna salad with apples (I was surprised at ow good it was), and my favorite, a tabouli variation, but with lentils instead of cracked wheat. There really wasn’t anything left after all 10 of us landed on the food.\n\nI come from a family of good eaters.\n\nThe running joke all week was how many bags of cheesy poofs we went through during the week. My count was 6.\n\nAfter lunch, I cleaned up and rested for a while. That’s really all I had the energy to do in the middle of the day when the humidity was over 90%.\n\nLater in the afternoon, I walked into town with Dad and Danyah. She needed to get some aloe for the boys’ sunburns and we needed more groceries (we were out of cheesy poofs).\n\nWhenever we would walk into town, there was this one particular house we would always pass. We finally nicknamed it The Chicken Lady’s House. She had no less than 20 roosters, chickens, and pullets running around at any one time. She became our landmark going and coming.\n\nAfter a successful shopping trip, we headed back to the house and passed the night uneventfully.\n\nDay 4 – Thursday, 7/9\n\nAnother activity day. Some were heading out for zip lining, some ATV-ing, some of us (me, Mom, Steve) were headed to do a walking tour in Manuel Antonio National Park.\n\nA walking tour is generally in my wheelhouse.\n\nWe were picked up by our absolutely fabulous guide, Pablo, and, after picking up a Dutch couple from their hotel, we were on our way to the park.\n\nManuel Antonio National Park was founded in 1972 so the region’s biodiversity could be protected from developers who were already decimating the surrounding areas. The local people convinced the central government to set aside and protect the land so it could be protected and so everyone could enjoy its beauty. It’s names after the conquistador who was buried near the park.\n\nIt is Costa Rica’s smallest park (1700 acres), but boasts almost 300 species of animals. Because of the size of the park, only 600 visitors during the week and 800 visitors on the weekends are allowed in the park at any one time. The popularity of the park belies its size; it’s basically the Yellowstone of Costa Rica.\n\nOur first stop was at a tree near the park’s entrance. Pablo (who’s been doing tours of the park for 20 years) immediately spotted a frog in the tree. It took a while for the rest of us to see it.\n\nAfter this first stop, we made it into the park. Almost immediately, Pablo set up his small telescope and pointed another creature out to us.\n\nThe park was crowded with both tourists and locals either on tours, walking on their own, or just heading to the beach. All the guides pointed out sights to each other (they’re a fairly close group) so no one – guides or visitors – would miss anything.\n\n(Some of the photos I took were through the viewfinder of Pablo’s telescope; hence, the odd framing. They still look cool, though.)\n\nAnd then, we saw them… Sloths. Two- and Three-Toes sloths are both common in the park. They are both arboreal, leaf-eaters, and are mainly nocturnal (although they can be active during the day). However, the Three-Toes Sloth cannot support its own body weight, so it only comes down to the ground once a week to defecate in a small hole it digs with its stubby tail; it is also a good swimmer. The Two-Toed Sloth can support its weight and is known to crawl on the ground.\n\nWe were also told by Pablo, they don’t make the best moms. The baby clings to their fur, but, if it falls off, the mother generally isn’t willing to climb down from the safety of the tree to retrieve it.\n\nWe would see more sloths, but first, other flora and fauna.\n\nWe finally made it to the beach. After traipsing through the humidity of the forest, the open air was welcome.\n\nWe stayed for about 30 minutes and rehydrated, rested, and took a few (more) photos.\n\nWe watched the raccoons search around for food in the usual places you would think (i.e. trashcans), but they weren’t shy about digging around in peoples’ belongings. And you thought only monkeys did that.\n\nThen, we looked up; along just about everyone else on the beach.\n\nShe was just hanging out in the tree right above the beach. If she hadn’t’ve started moving, no one would’ve noticed her. As slow as people say sloths are, she moved around quite quickly and deftly. Also, the baby did its job and held on.\n\nSteve & I walked around a little on the beach. But, it was very high tide at the time we were there, so there wasn’t much beach to walk on if you didn’t want to get wet. Pablo told us that the reason the tide was so high so late in the morning was because they were expecting a tropical storm later in the evening. If it happened, it didn’t make it to Quepos.\n\nAfter this, we started the walk back to the bus. As fun as the tour was, we were ready to go.\n\nWe finally made our way out of the park. I noticed that the main gates were closed and we had to go through a sort of turnstile to the right (think the NYC subway). I figured the quota must’ve been reached and, if they were letting people in, it was on a one-on-one basis.\n\nI decided to grab some coconut water for me, Mom, and Steve. I found a vendor who guaranteed his was cold, so, I bought some. Right in the shell. the price was right, too. 300₡ (Costa Rica Colones – about $.75)\n\nBetter than water at helping one’s thirst. Tasted better, too.\n\nOn the drive back to Quepos, we asked Pablo what his favorite place is to eat in town, he suggested a soda (small mom & pop local restaurants) called Soda y Pollo Frito Junior. Mom, Steve, and I were all hungry, and Pablo hadn’t steered us wrong all day, so we took his suggestion.\n\nIt was the second best meal we had in Costa Rica.\n\nAfter lunch, we caught a cab back to the house and spent the afternoon talking about each others’ excursions. Finally, I cleaned up, had a nap, and was ready to stay in and just be quiet.\n\nMark had noticed a restaurant on the road towards Manuel Antonio – Emilio’s Cafe. He said it looked good, they had live music, and wanted to give it a try.\n\nSure. Why not?\n\nBut first, we had to contend with a couple of things.\n\nTo begin with, Older Nephew had a rather nasty sunburn that had kept him up the night before and had been made worse during the day. He said he’d worn sunscreen, but didn’t reapply. As Danyah put aloe on his back, it was decided that he was to stay at the house while we went out. He didn’t object.\n\nSecond – Some Capuchin Monkeys decided to give us a visit.\n\nI don’t know how long they stayed.\n\nAs we were leaving, Steve told Older Nephew that he expected three of the monkeys trained when he got back: a butler, an accordion player, and a cymbal player. Older Nephew just gave him with a “yeah. right.” look.\n\nWhen we arrived at Emilio’s, we discovered there was Flamenco that night. Cool.\n\nIt’s a nice space overlooking the ocean with a studied rustic charm.\n\nThe menu was billed as “Mediterranean”, but it was most definitely a fusion of Mediterranean and Costa Rican.\n\nI wasn’t really all that hungry, so I opted for basically an appetizer for dinner. I couldn’t pass up the opportunity to have a Passionfruit Mojito, though.\n\nI was a little disappointed. The only passionfruit I could discern was the seeds. I drank it, though.\n\nWe decided to go all out on dinner; appetizers (entradas), salads (ensaladas), main courses (platos fuerte), and desserts (postres).\n\nYounger Nephew, out resident Potato Connoisseur, helped out those who couldn’t finish their potatoes. I think he ordered the same thing I did and it wasn’t quite enough for him; he’s a growing 15-year old after all.\n\nThen, dessert. Apparently, Emilio’s is known for its desserts and is quite proud of that fact. The waiter will take you to the display case where you pick your dessert like you’d pick a lobster in a tank. Then, they bring it to you in a floursh 15 minutes later.\n\nI had Coconut Flan (that I failed to photograph). It was good, but nothing memorable. While the coconut flavor was definitely pronounced, the texture was a bit grainy; like it had been cooked just a little too long.\n\nAfter dessert was finished, the Flamenco started. Now, I love Flamenco guitar and dancing. I find it, well, sensual. This group didn’t disappoint. They were fun to watch, and were all terrific performers. I have no idea whether they were local or a touring group. As far as I know, Flamenco isn’t native to Costa Rica. However, I’m sure with the Spanish colonization, it was introduced to the region at some point.\n\nUnfortunately, we had asked our cab to pick us up at the restaurant at 7:30. We didn’t know about the Flamenco (it started at 7) and there was no way to contact the driver. So, a few of us decided to go ahead and go back to the house (me included – I was exhausted and starting to not feel well). We had to ask the driver to come pick up the rest of our group at 8:30. He didn’t look at all pleased by this; I think he just wanted to go home.\n\nI asked later if he got a really big tip. Mom assured me he did.\n\nSteve was disappointed that Older Nephew hadn’t used his time wisely and trained a monkey butler.\n\nDay 5 – Friday 7/10\n\nOverall, it was a pretty quiet day for me. I did make breakfast for most of the crew because we still hadn’t touched the bacon. So, I scrambled the rest of the eggs, fried up most of the bacon (there was no way I was going to stand over the stove and cook one kilo of bacon), put out some cheese, made some toast, and heated up some tortillas. Everyone who ate breakfast seemed happy. I finally managed to get a few strips of bacon and a couple of tortillas.\n\nThen, I went all housewife and did my & Steve’s laundry. Ana had managed to get the maids to leave the laundry room key so we could use the facilities. It was like a dungeon down there. And, since my Spanish isn’t great, I had to use process of elimination as to which container held the laundry detergent. I finally got lucky. Then, there were the machines; their settings were in Spanish, too. (Well, of course they would be.) I must’ve done all right because I didn’t ruin any of our clothes.\n\nAbout mid-morning, I walked down to Quepos with Dad. He wanted to check out the marina take a look around town.\n\nWe decided to walk down to the sea wall and towards the marina. The weekly farmers market takes place on the wall, and I wanted to be sure I knew where it was.\n\nThe next few photos are some of the bench art by the wall. I think there were about a dozen in all.\n\nWhen we got to the wall, the breeze was a blessing. It was a hot, humid day with almost no breeze in the canopy.\n\nWe finally made it down to the marina. The marina was opened in 2010 as a way to rebuild the old pier built by the United Fruit Company and as a way to bring in new business and jobs to the town. It has some upper-end restaurants and shopping on the grounds, but the real viewing was all of the fishing boats and yachts the 1% keep at the slips.\n\nI felt like I was spending money just standing there. The marina did look a little incongruous given the surroundings.\n\nAfter exploring the marina, Dad and I decided to get some lunch. We went back to Soda y Pollo Frito Junior. I couldn’t resist.\n\nAfter lunch, I did a little gift/souvenir shopping while Dad talked to the tour operator next door about something. After this, we headed back to the house and settled in for the afternoon.\n\nThat night, Steve & I decided to have a date night. We simply wanted to have a little time alone. Pablo told us of a place he liked called La Cantina on the Manuel Antonio road. He said they had great barbecue, especially their ribs.\n\nSince it was on the Manuel Antonio road, I was skeptical of how good the food could really be. The restaurants on the road are generally catering to tourists rather than locals and the food can be rather dumbed down.\n\nThe first thing I noticed when our taxi dropped us off was the cold case carousel of entrees by the front entrance – for me, never a good sign. The second thing was the very heavy look to the place. As with all of the restaurants we’d been in so far, this one was open-air, but the very heavy wood furniture and fixtures still made the place seem somewhat claustrophobic.\n\nTo mitigate this feeling, I went all ’70’s and ordered a Piña Colada. I felt it matched the decor.\n\nAfter the waiter took our order (we didn’t get any barbecue), we saw Squirrel Monkeys frolicking in the trees. They were a big favorite for all of the tourists in the restaurant. Any locals and the staff were unimpressed. I guess they see this every day.\n\nAfter the monkey show, dinner arrived.\n\nAfter dinner, we decided to go downstairs and see some music and get some dessert. The combo was a trio of local guys who sang old standards and Spanish cover versions of American pop songs. They weren’t great, but one had to give them an “E” for effort.\n\nThe staff seemed to be either overwhelmed or disorganized – it was hard to tell. The restaurant wasn’t that busy since it was still relatively early. Since our cab was picking us up at 8:30, and they seemed to be dragging their feet on getting Steve’s dessert and coffee, I had to do one of the things I know servers hate – ask them to speed it up because we had to leave. (I didn’t say exactly that, but you get my meaning.)\n\nSteve finished, we paid, and we went to meet our taxi.\n\nWhen we got back to the house, everyone else was there having a pizza party. I guess they enjoyed it because there was only one slice of cheese pizza left.\n\nAs I was falling asleep, I could hear the Howler Monkeys.\n\nDay 6 – Saturday, 7/11\n\nHonestly, this was the day I’d been looking forward to all week: Farmers Fair (Ferias del Agricultor). The ferias is set up on Friday night and is up and running full blast by Saturday morning. We went early to beat the heat and crowds.\n\nWhen I mentioned this to Mom before we left on the trip, I asked her if she wanted to go. Her affirmative response was immediate. Steve decided to tag along, too.\n\nIt was another humid morning – as one would expect from the tropics – but once we were down at the sea wall, the breezes really helped to mitigate the oppressiveness.\n\nIt was a wonderful market. There were vendors who sold shoes and underwear, some who sold souvenirs, but most sold fresh produce.\n\nFor the more wide-angle shots, I didn’t really find it necessary to ask the vendors if I could take photos. I’m sure they either didn’t notice or they’re used to it. However, if I was going to buy from and photograph a stand specifically, I would ask the vendor, “¿Peudo tomar su photo?” – May I take your photo? They were all very nice about it and said “sí”. It’s just a courtesy thing.\n\nSteve went looking for breakfast for he & I while Mom & I were shopping. He came across a gentlemen selling tamales. Tamales for breakfast? Yes, please.\n\nThose tamales were damn delicious. And, I couldn’t finish the second one. I tried to get Mom to try some, but she said she’d already eaten and wasn’t hungry.\n\nWe left shortly after this. It was time to get moving and the tweakers nearby were starting to concern us a little.\n\nSteve decided to stay in town and look around while Mom and I took our purchases back to the house. On the way, I ducked into a carnecería and bought a half kilo of chicharron. They were still warm from the fryer.\n\nI spent most of the afternoon finishing my & Steve’s laundry, reading, packing, and just generally being quiet. I was then distracted by a line of Army Ants moving up one of the walls towards a window carrying a piece of chicharron. I regret now not getting a picture.\n\nThen, Mom called me outside and showed me this.\n\nI was lucky I got the photo I did. He flew off almost as soon as I snapped the shutter.\n\nAbout 4pm, I got started on dinner. We bought potatoes, chayote, tomatoes, avocados, Mandarin limes, pineapple, mangoes, onions, Otaheiti Apples, tuna, and prawns. Along with all of these things, I decided to clean out the fridge as much as possible since we were leaving the next morning and had to either throw away anything left or simply leave it behind.\n\nEveryone seemed to enjoy dinner. I was happy because there were almost no leftovers and I didn’t have to do dishes.\n\nThen, came dessert. Heath had gone to a bakery in Quepos earlier in the day and picked up a lovely chocolate cake (it had the texture of a Tres Leches) for Older Nephew.\n\nNot long after I, and most everyone else went to bed, I received this photo via text from Steve:\n\nIt turned out he and the boys were sitting around talking and Older Nephew noticed this on the couch. Steve tried to dispatch it, but he only succeeded in making it scurry back under the couch. Steve speculated that it had a nest either under or in the cushion; or, since we had the doors and windows open almost all the time, it could’ve crawled in who knows when.\n\nThey took all the cushions off the couch (except for the seat) and placed signs in English and Spanish basically saying “Don’t sit here. Scorpion in the cushion.” If that thing was living in the cushions, we were all really lucky it didn’t come out and sting anyone. Scorpion stings aren’t really too harmful to anyone who’s healthy, but they feel like a red-hot needle poking into you.\n\nDay 7 – Sunday, 7/12\n\nNot too much to tell about Sunday. It was travel back home day for us.\n\nI went over to Haneen & Mark’s balcony outside their room and took a few final photos.\n\nEstilio arrived just before 9 to pick us up to take us to the airport. Our flight was at 2pm, and with the drive and check-in, we needed all the time we could reasonably get.\n\nBecause Mom & Dad have some sort of priority status on American, they were able to check themselves and Danyah’s crew (Dad had booked all their tickets) in the first class ticketing line. The rest of us had to schlub through the economy class line.\n\nJust as we were about to be at the head of the line, however, a customer service rep took us out of the line and checked us in at one of the kiosks. Problem solved.\n\nThat’s all. Just two more flights, complete chaos at immigration in Miami, and a flight delay, we all finally made it back home.\n\nI’ll definitely go back. Costa Rica was so much more fun and beautiful than I imagined. Those coupled with the great food and lovely people, plus hanging with my family for a week, made it a wonderful and memorable trip.\n\nTo begin with, the Big Bend Region of Texas and New York City are two places I’ll use just about any excuse whatsoever to visit. In both places, I’ll think “I want to live here”, “How can I convince Husband Steve to agree to move here”, and “Damn. The food is great”. Then, I come home, get off the vacation high, and come to the realization that both of these places are escapes for me; if I lived there, I would look to escape them as well.\n\nOf the two, of course, the escape to Big Bend is much more easily attained. For you first-timers, to go from Austin to Alpine (our first & third nights’ destination) is a roughly 400-mile jaunt via US290 to IH10 to US67 to TX118. To get to Terlingua/Study Butte (our second night’s stay), an 83-mile drive, just take TX118 south. Well, you can take TX118 as a direct route to Terlingua/Study Butte, but we took the long way through Marathon and drove through, and explored, Big Bend National Park.\n\nOr, as I heard someone say once, “Drive 6 hours west, turn left and drive another hour and a half south”.\n\nBy the way, for the uninitiated, Marathon is pronounced “Marath’n” and Study “Stoody”. You don’t want to sound like a rube or anything like that.\n\nThe reason Husband Steve & I decided on this trip was to have, quite possibly, the last summer with our Older Nephew. He graduated from high school this year and is starting college in the fall. Husband & I were trying to decide on a graduation gift and landed on a trip to Big Bend. When we told Nephew, he seemed as pleased as his 17-year-old self would let him get. In fact, he almost smiled.\n\nNephew has been to the Big Bend region before – Marfa and Ft. Davis. He’s been to the lights, stayed at El Paisano, and explored the fort. He’s just not been to the park. Well, now, here was his chance. Honestly, I think the promised trip to Mexico sealed the deal.\n\nDay 1 – Thursday, June 11.\n\nThe trip started off rather inauspiciously.\n\nI asked Nephew when I picked him up at the airport on Wednesday if he remembered his passport so he could go to Mexico. He said he remembered the extra paperwork his mother (my sister) gave him – a letter stating Steve & I were in charge of him and her passport information – but failed to bring his passport. His quote was “Everything I told myself to remember, I forgot” (this included a book of Big Bend trails and a map I loaned him). One unplanned phone call to his no doubt exasperated mom secured an overnight delivery of Nephew’s passport.\n\nThe passport arrived before 10am on Thursday. Victory.\n\nHowever, as things go with Steve & I, even though we planned on being on the road by 10, it didn’t happen until 11. We basically needed the extra time to load the SUV I rented.\n\nWith a quick stop in Fredericksburg for gas, restrooms, and snacks, we were really, finally, on our way.\n\nAs we drove along IH10, I saw the opening where I could finally feel like I could breathe a little:\n\nWe did run into some rain going into Alpine. It seems as if the rain has taken up permanent residence in Texas this year.\n\nWe finally made it to Alpine. It was a joyous time. And not only because we’d been driving for 7 hours.\n\nWe stayed for nights one and three at the Antelope Lodge. We’ve stayed at this old motor court before and rather enjoyed its rustic, slightly quirky charm. Plus, it’s cheap.\n\nBefore we left Austin, Steve made reservations at Reata in Alpine for our one “fancy” meal while we were in this part of the country. For whatever strange reason I made up in my head, I’ve avoided eating there whenever we’ve been in Alpine. I have this thing against steak houses, I guess.\n\nEven after this meal, I still have a thing against steakhouses. Just not this steakhouse. Or, rather, a Texas Cowboy Cuisine establishment.\n\nI guess I was skeptical about the food overall. I tend to avoid “buzz” restaurants, and this one still has a bit of a legend buzz around it even after having been open for 20 years. I don’t consider myself overly picky or a “foodie”, but I just always had a mental block.\n\nI suppose ANY restaurant being open for 20 years deserves some buzz. I mean, the restaurant business is a cruel one.\n\nI was happy to be proven wrong. Our food was plentiful – as one would expect – but was also very enjoyable. The decor was a simple, pared-down, but slightly upscale rustic. (I happened to notice bottles of Silver Creek wine in the alcove above us. I couldn’t quite see what vintage they were; but considering the cheapest bottle is $70 retail, this place is no hole-in-the-wall.) Our server, whose name I unfortunately can’t remember, was a young man studying at Sul Ross. He was a wonderful server. Attentive without hovering. That counts for a lot.\n\nI’m guessing it was good, because they both finished their plates. I believe the Chile Relleno one of Reata’s signature dishes.\n\nMy dinner was excellent. There wasn’t more breading than meat, the gravy wasn’t pasty, everything was well seasoned, and the green beans weren’t overcooked.\n\nSo… When I see grits on a dinner menu, I’m generally compelled to try them. The grits were really good. Plenty of cheese and spice. The one drawback – too salty. If the kitchen backed down a little on the salt, these would’ve been excellent. There was a lot so the guys helped me eat them.\n\nWould I go back? Sure. It’s definitely on the list.\n\nWe did a quick walk around Alpine just to work off some of dinner. Nephew told us he’d been through Alpine before but ever really got to see the town. Because it was already dark when we left the restaurant, he didn’t see too much, but we did walk up and down Holland and some of the side streets before deciding to call it a night. We wanted to get an early start on Friday.\n\nDay one at the Park. And the trip into Mexico.\n\nDay 2 – June 12, Friday\n\nThe day started early. 6am. Steve wanted to be on the road to the park by 7. We somehow managed to accomplish this.\n\nWhile he was getting ready and loading the behemoth again, I went to get Nephew. I opened the door and saw him doing push-ups on the patio. I had to give him credit for already being far more active than I care to be that time of the morning.\n\nAnd, so, off we went.\n\nSteve & I remembered a coffee shop we rather liked the last time we stayed in Marathon. Since it was only about 30 miles, we decided to hold off on breakfast until then.\n\nMarathon (or Nancy’s) Coffee Shop is right there on US90 in Marathon as you’re on your way to the park.\n\nAgain, as I’ve discovered for Big Bend, the food is plentiful, very good, and reasonable. The strong coffee is a plus.\n\nI forgot to take a picture of my breakfast because I was so focused on getting the guys’ breakfasts before they started eating. I had Pancakes with Bacon. I needed the carb and protein loading.\n\nAfter a (perhaps too) leisurely breakfast and a discussion of what we were going to do that day, we finally hit the road to the park.\n\nOne of these visits I’m going to get a picture of those turkey buzzards sunning themselves.\n\nAfter about an hour and a half, we finally made it to the second stop of the day, Panther Junction. Since the Persimmon Gap checkpoint was closed, we had to buy our permit there. It’s also a convenient excuse to get out of the car, stretch, and buy stuff. I like it, too, because it is actually very well landscaped, and the restrooms are reasonably clean.\n\nAfter we finished at Panther Junction, we headed back on the main park road towards Boquillas Canyon.\n\nBoquillas Canyon is rated a “moderate” trail. It’s not very long, but it is steep. And, on a hot day for a barely in-shape middle-aged woman like me, it was, shall we say, more on the moderate-to-difficult scale. I definitely had my moments. I used my breathlessness and knees as excuses to constantly stop and take photographs while Steve & Nephew trotted way ahead of me.\n\nOnce one leaves the trail and gets down to the canyon and the River, the shade is such a welcome relief and reward for hiking the trail at mid-morning.\n\nWe ended up staying in the canyon, by my estimation, for well over an hour. Nephew, Steve, and I all had our different reasons. Mine? It was out of the sun. If you’ve ever been to Big Bend, or even just in a higher elevation, you know the sun can be brutal. Especially in a west Texas summer. Any shade is welcome. Plus, it was just so peaceful, even after another family arrived.\n\nHere was their reason for staying in the canyon: rock throwing contest.\n\nNow, for the highlight of Friday’s part of the trip – going to Boquillas del Carmen.\n\nI can still remember when there was a time where one could go freely between Texas and Mexico without worrying about needing a passport. Your driver’s license would do fine when you wanted to cross back. I myself did this numerous times – mostly for the super cheap Margaritas, booze, and tchotchkes. Plus, it was fun to go down with a bunch of friends for a road trip.\n\nHowever, as we are all painfully aware, this all changed after 2001. Now, to simply cross the river and travel essentially one mile into Mexico, you must to have a passport. The days of cheap anything are gone, too.\n\nSteve & I went across the river about 2 months after the crossing opened in 2013. Then, the recovery had just started and it was still almost ghost-town like. We had heard that there had been some great progress in Boquillas del Carmen since then, so we were anxious to see what had happened.\n\nNow, Nephew’s major in college is going to be Spanish. He’s already pretty fluent so we pressed him into service as our interpreter. I don’t think he really enjoyed it – especially when we called him out for claiming that he really didn’t know any. We told him it would be a good thing if at least one of us (my Spanish is mediocre at best, Steve’s is pretty much non-existent) could speak to the locals in their native tongue rather than make them try to understand us.\n\nIt’s called cultural respect.\n\nThe river wasn’t as high as it was in 2013. I was fine with that. I remember the last time, the river was so high and fast, I honestly thought we’d capsize.\n\nThe method and means of crossing was the same as before. A canoe came over to take us across while Victor the Singing Man serenaded us.\n\nWe told Nephew that there are 4 ways of getting to town – walking, truck, horse, donkey. He said he wanted a horse because he had an image to maintain.\n\nO… K…\n\nWell. Guess what. No horses that day. Just donkeys. Or, in keeping with the spirit of things – burros. Since it’s hard for me to climb on a horse, I was fine with a burro since that was what I was going to request anyway.\n\nAfter paying Victor for the river crossing and tipping him for his singing (be sure to bring lots of small bills), Jesus was assigned to us as our guide for our visit. Sweet man.\n\nSo, after helping the gringa & gringos up on the burros, we were off.\n\nOnce we got into town, we had to go through the ritual of the Mexican passport office (which was crowded) and then sought out lunch. We decided on Jose Falcon’s. When Steve & I went to Boquillas in 2013, we ate lunch at Boquillas Restaurant.\n\nIf I had to compare between the two, I’d’ve chosen to go back to Boquillas Restaurant. This isn’t to say that the food Jose Falcon’s wasn’t good (and, yes; I know the difference between Mexican and Tex-Mex), it just felt very touristy and a little dumbed-down to me. But, with a touristy town, I guess that’s to be expected. They even have a souvenir shop attached. I didn’t patronize it.\n\nSo, after settling in and buying a Jesus a Coca (he didn’t want anything to eat), we ordered lunch.\n\nAfter a lazy lunch, Jesus took us on a tour of the town. There were definitely more buildings than the last time. The town has also been electrified since March of this year. It was an international effort that is beginning to take the town out of the past and bring it into the present. Hopefully, there will be more improvements that will make the Boquillas’ residents lives better and not just give tourists another place to exploit.\n\nAs we walked around, we noticed electrical wiring, satellite dishes, more construction (including a new primary school), and a generally more optimistic atmosphere. Of course, the tourist-based economy is back in full swing. Steve bought me a small bag with a cut-out burro design from Jesus’ grandfather and I bought a little bead Ocotillo from a little boy who came up to us. The children are, admittedly, almost impossible to resist.\n\nAfter taking care of our exit paperwork back at the passport office, it was time for us to cross back to America.\n\nWe’ll be back and I can’t wait to see what’s next for Boquillas.\n\nWe landed back in Big Bend, went through passport control (a strange experience in and of itself), and decided to head to the Basin.\n\nBecause we were gluttons for punishment that day, we thought we’d try the Basin Loop Trail. It’s less than 2 miles round trip and not too difficult. At least, it wouldn’t be if you hadn’t had all your strength sapped by the afternoon sun.\n\nIt was about this time that we all three decided to turn back. We could hear thunder, the sun was beginning to get low, and we were being eaten alive by bugs. At least I was. Steve & Nephew seemed immune to them. Plus, we were really tired, filthy, and hungry.\n\nI could swear as we walked past one patch of rocks and underbrush, I distinctly heard a rattle. I may have been mistaken as to the source of the rattle, but I thought it best to move on. As I got further away, it stopped. If it was a rattlesnake, it did its job well.\n\nFor night #2, we decided to stay in Terlingua/Study Butte. The logic was this – after driving for 7 hours, we didn’t want to go any further than Alpine the first night. For the second night, we didn’t want to drive back to Alpine after spending all day at the southern end of the park.\n\nSo, Chisos Mining Company Motel it was.\n\nAfter unpacking, resting a little, and scraping off the day, we headed to the Terlingua Trading Company for a little shopping (t-shirts, always t-shirts) and to the Starlight Theater for dinner.\n\nWhen we got to the theater for dinner, we were told it would be an unknown amount of time before they had a table ready for us. So, while Steve & Nephew waited, I wandered.\n\nEvery time I see the Ghost Town there’s a little less of it, it seems. Weather, age, and, no doubt, human intervention keep the town in constant flux. Perhaps if I had on proper footwear and wasn’t so afraid of critters or cactus as it was getting slowly darker, I would’ve delved deeper into the brush and found more evidence of the dwellings. As it was, I stayed on the outskirts for the most part.\n\nI ran out of the brush positive I saw a tarantula. (Although, now, I think it was just a figment of my imagination.)\n\nI spied Steve and Nephew still waiting for the table, so I took a few more photos of the rusted equipment.\n\nI decided I’d better join the men. Just as I looked up, Steve was waving for me to come in. Perfect timing.\n\nI like the Starlight Theater. It has a nice atmosphere, cold beer, and good food. Nothing spectacular, just solid, good food. Perfect after a day of tromping around the park. Sometimes, of you’re lucky, there will even be a show going on.\n\nNephew, even though he’s a growing 17-year-old, put Steve and me to shame with his restraint when it came to eating. During the entire trip, he ate (mostly) reasonably and knew when to stop. Me and Steve? Let’s just say we like to eat. The two of us are just barely in shape (we do gym it), middle-aged, and sometimes let our appetites get the better of us. My own rationalization of the eating thing is that I’m a professional and I really need to do all the research I can. Steve goes along for support.\n\nVery gentlemanly of him.\n\nI’ve had this dish before. It’s very good. Not too much breading in comparison to the meat, excellent mashed potatoes, and the vegetables weren’t overcooked. If memory serves, the last time I had this, it was closer to a cream gravy on top. This time, the gravy was a beer base using a beer from Big Bend Brewery. I’m not sure which one it was and I forgot to ask. But, it was just a little too much. I don’t know if this is the recipe or the cook got a little too liberal with the beer, but it was almost too strong a taste. And I like beer. I ate all of my meal because I was really hungry, but I had to mitigate the beer flavor with the potatoes and bread a lot more than I would’ve liked.\n\nI managed to catch this before Nephew drowned his fried in ketchup. He asked for no mayonnaise, so I think he was brought a dry sandwich. It may have had some mustard, but I don’t remember. He said, except for the dryness, it was very good.\n\nPersonally, I have no use for Filet Mignon. There’s a reason it’s usually wrapped in bacon. Because it doesn’t have any flavor. It’s expensive because there’s only 2 tenderloins on any given animal. But, Steve was happy, so who am I to judge. He said it was cooked just the way he liked it and he ate everything on the plate.\n\nJust as we were tucking into dinner, the entertainment started. We literally had a front row seat. The singer was someone who works in the kitchen at the theater who I guess they let sing for a little extra cash. He was pretty good at improvising and came up with a verse talking about Nephew’s awesome hat and the fact that he was a gentleman and took it off when he was inside. Steve tipped him. The singer, I mean.\n\nThe rest of the trip, Nephew referred to his hat as “My Awesome Hat”.\n\nAfter dinner, I asked Steve to stop at the Cemetery so we could take a look. I like to poke around cemeteries (just for historical curiosity, mind you) and Nephew had never been there, so we stopped.\n\nThere’s just something about being in a cemetery at night that helps take on a different feel and significance.\n\nThis particular cemetery is a little more haunting to me than most because of the sheer number of unknowns and young ones that are buried here. Some of the newer graves, though, helped to mitigate the feeling, though. They simply looked like some real parties going on.\n\nOnce it became too dark to see well, we headed back to the hotel.\n\nNephew was a couple of buildings away from us. I wasn’t too happy about that. After some eye-rolling as I lectured him about locking up, etc., we dropped him off and said good night. And be ready to go at 7am.\n\nThem to our room.\n\nFor what it is, The Chisos Mining Co. Hotel is pretty good. The rooms are pretty bare-bone, but if all you’re using them for is sleeping and showering, they’ll do.\n\nAfter we unpacked, Steve & I sat on the porch for a while and just talked, watched the lightning in the park, and looked up at the stars. A good way to end the day.\n\nAnd, off to sleep.\n\nDay 3 – Saturday, June 13\n\nAnother early morning. Steve wanted to get an earlier start than we had on Friday. At least we didn’t have as far to go to get to the park. While he packed up, I went to fetch Nephew. There he was, doing his push-ups. I was barely awake and suddenly felt old.\n\nWe saw a place the night before called Big Bend Resort & Adventures Cafe and so decided to go there for breakfast.\n\nIt was certainly what I expected. Nothing fancy, just basic breakfast. Not that I’m complaining. It was really good.\n\nAgain, Nephew put Steve & me to shame with his restraint.\n\nNephew opted for the simple. And, he finished in 3 minutes.\n\nI honestly had no idea it would be so much. It was delicious, though. The gravy was just the right consistency, not at all greasy or pasty, and had just the right amount of salt. I should’ve asked for crispier hash browns, though. I did end up giving Nephew some of my bacon.\n\nCompared to me, Steve had a child’s plate. He was happy. He even had some of my breakfast.\n\nAfter looking over the map and showing Nephew where we were going, we headed back to the park. Our goal: Santa Elena Canyon.\n\nSteve and I have tried twice before to go. Both times, flash floods stopped us. After the storms we saw the night before, we wondered if we’d miss out again. We listened to the in-park radio feed and didn’t hear anything about the canyon being closed, so we forged ahead.\n\nBut not before making Steve stop so I could take more photographs. I’m lucky he’s a patient man. Usually.\n\nAfter turning onto Old Maverick Road to Santa Elena Canyon, we had another 30 miles of dodging road runners, rabbits, and jack rabbits as they headed back into the grass and brush.\n\nWhen we arrived, it was already crowded (for Big Bend). In fact, the only times I’ve seen so many people in the park in one place was either at Panther Junction or the Basin.\n\nAs walked towards the canyon, a gentleman told me that if I wanted to go into the canyon, I’d have to get my feet wet. I knew I’d have to, I just didn’t know how much.\n\nNow, for the climb. At least part of it has stairs.\n\nAfter staying with me through the first set of photos, Steve decided to try to catch up to Nephew and leave me to my pokey self.\n\nSteve and I came across a group who looked familiar. It turned out it was the same family who shared Boquillas Canyon with us the day before. We had a lovely chat. We asked if they had gone to Boquillas, but they said no one had brought their passports so that was out. We told them what to expect when they do get a chance to go. I can’t recall what else they were doing on the trip. Lovely people.\n\nWe eventually made it to the end of the trail. It basically ends at the edge of the river as you head back down into the canyon.\n\nThere were several other people resting at the end of the trail. We all heard echoes coming from further down the canyon. We were wondering how they got down there and came to the conclusion they either walked down the river hugging the cliff face or rowed down in canoes or kayaks.\n\nMe being me, I decided to take a dip into the water and see how far I could go. Not very without it getting very slippery and the mud trying to suck the boots off my feet. I got back on shore just long enough to grab my camera and very carefully wade back in.\n\nSteve dipped a toe in but elected to stay on shore. I think he was waiting to see if I’d fall in. Nephew waded into the water with me briefly.\n\nNephew started back almost as soon as we stepped back on shore and completely ignoring me when I told him to stay where I could see him. Steve stayed with me while I reorganized and we walked back together.\n\nAs we walked and chatted, Steve & I decided this was our favorite trail so far. Third time was really the charm.\n\nIn the meantime, we lost Nephew. We called for him; no answer. I kept thinking that if anything happened to him that my sister would kill me. Steve calmly told me that he was fine, there was only one trail so he couldn’t get lost; basically, there was only one way for him to go. Instinctively, I knew he was right. Emotionally, I was concerned. I mean, if he’d fallen off the cliff, we definitely would’ve heard something.\n\nWe came across two men coming the opposite direction. We asked if they’d seen a teenager in a lime green shirt. They said yes; they’d passed him on the trail. I was relived but still aggravated. At least I knew he hadn’t fallen into the river off the cliff. Aggravated that he was so far ahead.\n\nWe finally get to the beginning of the trail again and dip back into the water and join Nephew on his next Mexico excursion. I will say here that walking around in the water felt really great.\n\nNephew wanted me to help him with an experiment. He pulled out the plastic cover for his Awesome Hat and put it on. Then, he wanted me to walk up a little ways on the mini-rapids, place the hat, brim up, in the water and see of the cover would do its job. I did; it flipped over. The experiment was partially successful. The covered part of Awesome Hat stayed dry; when it flipped over, it, of course, got wet.\n\nI was just glad he caught the damn thing. He would’ve been upset if he lost Awesome Hat.\n\nWe finished at Santa Elena. I was glad we did because a large party of bros were about to paddle down the canyon.\n\nSteve & I had toyed with the idea of taking Nephew to Burro Mesa. However, by the time we were done at Santa Elena combined with Friday, we were whipped and Steve was feeling a little overheated. We decided to just slowly make our way out of the park, stop occasionally to take photographs, and head back to Alpine for our final night.\n\nSince I was the one doing the driving, I got to stop the behemoth any time I wanted.\n\nDriving down Ross Maxwell Scenic Road, we came across Sam Nail Ranch. We’d never seen it before, so we stopped. It was a short, flat, easy trail with a lot more to see than any of us anticipated.\n\nI’ve never seen so much prickly pear in one place. Ever.\n\nI was honestly fascinated at the type of person who would try to ranch in a place known for frequent droughts, isolation, and rough terrain. One would have to be a tough, hearty soul.\n\nAnd, after this final stop, I starting driving back to Alpine.\n\nGoing back up the road to Marathon, as anyone who’s driven 385 knows, there’s a Boarder Patrol Inspection Station about 30 miles in. I know he was joking, but Nephew said we should just speed on through, flash our high beams, or just act suspiciously so we can see what happens.\n\nI had two thoughts on this: 1. None of those suggestions were going to fly; 2. Pretty interesting talk from someone who wants to go into law enforcement.\n\nAfter the inspection, we discussed lunch options. Nephew said he wasn’t hungry, but Steve & I wanted something. Nothing big, just something. Since, seemingly, the only restaurant in town that was open was at the Gage (and we weren’t going there), we stopped at the French Grocer.\n\nSteve & I weren’t that hungry. We were in the mood for more of a snack and drinks. We split a Turkey & Cheese Sandwich (made on premises) and chips. Nephew, for someone claiming he wasn’t hungry, ate about half the bag of chips himself.\n\nWe again came through some rain on our way back to Alpine. Very heavy rain. As I was driving through it, I thought, wow, I’ve always wanted to see a storm in Big Bend; I’m an idiot.\n\nWe checked back into the Antelope Lodge for our final night in the same rooms we had on night one. We had just managed to unpack the behemoth and get into our rooms before the rain followed us into Alpine. This time, hail was included. Plus, the temperature dropped about 20 degrees within 15 minutes.\n\nWhile we were waiting for things to clear up, Steve heard from our friend Stewart Ramser. Stewart is the tourism director for Alpine as well as publisher of Texas Music magazine, among other things. He was in town getting ready for the Big Bend Music Festival in July and who knows what else. Stewart’s a busy man.\n\nWe had planned to meet Stewart at the Alpine Cowboys baseball game Saturday night, but the rain cancelled those plans. So, it was decided we would have dinner at one of Stewart’s favorite places in town – La Casita. A locals joint.\n\nWe were all disappointed about the game, but dinner sounded promising.\n\nWe met Stewart at the restaurant. He had posters in hand that he wanted to post on the wall. After ordering dinner, he tried with scotch tape. They all stayed up for about 5 minutes. I think he finally managed to hang the posters after borrowing some pins from the restaurant management.\n\nDinner was excellent, by the way. As it usually is when you find a place off the beaten path. In my experience, locals places are, as a rule, better than anything where tourists generally congregate.\n\nThe beef enchiladas had ground beef. I don’t know why I was surprised. It’s certainly less expensive and easy to prepare. I’m also guessing Nephew enjoyed it; he finished his plate.\n\nI really liked these. The chicken was well seasoned and the verde sauce was different from anything else I’d had before. It was almost creamy as opposed to salsa-like. It was also a milder flavor than I’m used to; not so tart or spicy.\n\nSteve was all set to order the beef enchiladas until he saw this dish float by. The guacamole intrigued him. To me, it looked basically like a huge plate of glorified nachos. I tried a couple of bites; it was very good. But, it was one of those meals you eat where it never seems like you make any sort of headway. He didn’t finish it. But he did give it the old college try.\n\nAfter parting company with Stewart (it was great to see him), it was still relatively early. Since the ball game was out, the three of us took a drive to Marfa.\n\nWe wandered around the center of town for a while and wondering what the hell happened to the radio station, book store and the covered space by the railroad tracks. Eventually, we made it down to Planet Marfa to listen to some music and have a beer (or, a Coke in Nephew’s case).\n\nPlanet Marfa is a nice, tree-lined partially open-air space where you can just hang out and listen to some music. They have a fairly neat teepee set up with a sitting area sunk down into the floor (you have to take some stairs to go down). They have an “upstairs” up one of the trees and tables to sit around. They also have a fairly limited bar food menu.\n\nSteve, Nephew, and I chatted for a while about our plans for Sunday and just hung out. After the rain came through, it cooled everything down and cleared the air, so it was a very pleasant night. We didn’t stay out late, though. We were all tired and knew we had a long day ahead of travel back to Austin.\n\nSo, back to Alpine and bed.\n\nDay 4 – June 14, Sunday\n\nNone of us were in any hurry to get up and moving. But, we finally managed to conjure ourselves up, shower, and pack the behemoth. Then, I knocked on Nephew’s door. No answer. Again. No answer. After the third knock, I heard a snarky “I heard you the first time.” I answered with an equally snarky “Then you need to say something”. Turned out he was up several hours before and fell back to sleep. So, I was apparently waking him up again.\n\nWe headed to Magoo’s Place for Breakfast. Steve & I ate there last year with my parents when they met us in Alpine. Honestly, I thought the restaurant had been open for decades. It’s been open 9 years. It’s certainly popular with locals and, I’m sure, tourists alike.\n\nThe Huevos Rancheros are some of the best I’ve ever had. Beans, excellent; eggs, cooked perfectly. Ranchero Sauce, just the right amount of spice. One drawback – they never seem to give you enough tortillas.\n\nAfter leaving Alpine, we drove the long way home via Del Rio. We had a crazy idea that we’d cross into Cuidad Acuña for a couple of hours.\n\nBut first, a quick stop in Langtry to get out of the car and go see the Judge Roy Bean Visitors Center. Steve & I had been here before, but we wanted to take Nephew; Roy Bean being a “lawman” and all.\n\nFor a place so remote, the visitors center is really nice. The buildings have been lovingly restored and maintained and the story of Roy Bean, while no doubt sanitized for your protection, has been preserved via electronic diorama. There is also an amazing cactus garden, if you are so inclined to visit. I had seen enough cactus, so I opted out this trip.\n\nAfter we finished at the visitors center, we decided to take Nephew to the over look above the Pecos River. Steve & I stumbled on to it last year and were floored by the sheer size.\n\nNephew seemed impressed.\n\nAfter saving a couple of centipedes from the asphalt and the possibility of being run over by the behemoth, we drove to Del Rio. Our plan was to cross into Cuidad Acuña, walk around, have lunch, shop, cross back, and drive home.\n\nNow, I remember when there was a place to park on the American side and walk across the bridge into Acuña, just like in Laredo. However, that is no longer an option. If you don’t want to take your car, you have to park at a taxi service and they will take you across. Otherwise, you’ll have to take your car over. Since we had a rental, we couldn’t take it over even if we wanted to; we didn’t. Steve didn’t want to use a taxi service, either. So, the trip to Acuña was off.\n\nAt least there was a convenient sign stating “Final Turnaround. This is your last chance before you are in Mexico.” Or, something like that.\n\nSo, we turned around. Steve stopped at a gas station and, while he was filling up, I scouted Yelp for restaurants. We ended up at El Patio Mexican Buffet.\n\nI haven’t been to a buffet restaurant in years. It was fun. The food was average, but it was fun. I honestly can’t remember what Steve or I ate. Nephew, on the other hand, made himself a huge taco-burrito hybrid with beans, meat, rice, queso, and a lot of sour cream.\n\nAs I was paying, I asked the lady behind the counter about the mystery pedestrian bridge to Acuña. She told me what I already knew, there was no longer a pedestrian bridge. I was hoping she’d give me a different answer.\n\nSo, the three of us decided it was simply time to drive back to Austin. After driving through more rain, San Antonio, and the clogged arteries of the Austin freeway system, we made it home around 6:30pm. My sister was waiting for us when we arrived. She was taking Nephew to his college orientation early the next morning, so she decided to come the night before.\n\nIt was a great trip. I’ll miss those summers with Nephew.\n\nLuckily, we have Younger Nephew for 3 more years.\n\nMoving on…\n\nThe next 2 days of the trip were the days Steve & I were looking forward to the most. We were finally leaving the resort to see something of the “Real Jamaica”.\n\nDay 3 January 31, Friday\n\nSteve & I started off the day quite excited of what we were about to experience. But first, a small breakfast.\n\nWe decided to go with room service one last time and just get a fruit plate and juice.\n\nSigh… At least the pineapple was edible.\n\nAfter this disappointment, we headed downstairs to wait for our guide. We didn’t have to wait long.\n\nI will say that Steve hit the jackpot in our tour guide, the wonderful Lynda Lee Burks. She is an American ex-pat who has lived in Jamaica full time for most of the last 20 years. She has her own tour company that focuses on specialized tours, Jamaica Tour Society (http://www.jamaicatoursociety.com). She was a wonderful guide and companion for the next two days. I love her.\n\nSteve & I wanted to go into Montego Bay to visit the produce market and look for some music. We also wanted to try the national dish of Jamaica, Ackee and Saltfish. Lynda Lee said she rarely gets requests to go into the city, so she was happy to take us.\n\nThe market was a maze of sensory experiences. They sell everything there from tobacco to clothes to kitchenware to produce. I’m not sure of the age of the market, but considering the importance of the city as a port, the market has likely survived in one form or another for at least 350 years. However, the building we saw along with the current fixtures was probably built in the early- to mid-twentieth century.\n\nAs we began walking around the market, it was clear to me that this is a country that takes a lot of pride in its food. While some of the produce was imported (we saw huge bags of onions, carrots, and potatoes), most of it was native grown.\n\nLynda Lee also gave me some advice as we began walking around: Always ask to take someone’s photo. If you don’t, if seen as an invasion of privacy and/or they think you’re a journalist looking to make money off of them. Since I’m not one who would naturally walk up to random strangers and ask to take their photos, I found the easiest way to approach this is to buy something from the stand. I figured the vendors would be much more receptive. Luckily, they were.\n\nAs we moved through the market, we did run across a stand that had the components of one of the national dish of Jamaica: Ackee. It has a mild, creamy flavor and texture that works well with the very salty fish in the dish.\n\nAfter walking around a bit more, we all decided we were hungry enough to stop by one of Lynda Lee’s favorite cook shops in the market and finally get our Ackee & Saltfish.\n\nAnd, here are the ladies who made us this culinary delight. Esther and Janet.\n\nTheir tiny cook shop in the market seems to be quite popular. It was actually one of the first places we stopped when we got into the market. After Lynda Lee chatted with them for a few minutes (she knows them well; they usually have roasted breadfruit, one of Lynda Lee’s favorites, in season), Janet agreed to set aside some of the Ackee & Saltfish for us when we came back by. They apparently sell out quickly.\n\nTo prepare the recipe, salt cod is soaked and boiled (although Janet used mackerel that morning), then sautéed with the cleaned ackee, onions, habanero (Scotch Bonnet) peppers, tomatoes, and black pepper and allspice (pimento). It is usually served as breakfast with breadfruit (when it’s in season), tomatoes, fried or boiled dumplings, boiled yams, and fried plantain or boiled green bananas.\n\nAll I can say is: Wow.\n\nThe full breakfast was Ackee & Saltfish, boiled yams, sweet potato, tomatoes, fried dumplings, and boiled bananas.\n\nLike many cuisines in developing nations, starch figures pretty prominently in Jamaican cuisine. It’s a cheap, generally nutritious, and filling way to receive one’s sustenance. Not that I’m opposed to starch.\n\nAfter we ate breakfast, we moved next door so Steve could speak with a gentleman named Bunny so he could buy some old-school Jamaican music.\n\nWhile Lynda Lee and I were waiting for Steve to finish up with Bunny, we watch a gentleman dance to the old-school dub that was coming out of the speakers. But, I didn’t want to pay him for taking his photo (which can happen). So, I just have the memory.\n\nAfter Steve bought his cd’s, we wandered around a bit more as we worked our way out of the market.\n\nAs we left the market, I needed to change some money, so Lynda Lee took us over to Andy’s Market. It is directly across from the produce market and gets quite the trade in money exchange and simply making change. It looks like a dry goods store, but the money exchange takes place in a rather strange way (to us anyway). High above the floor is a room where someone will reach down while you reach up with your cash, they will take it, count it, and give you the exchange. It’s all very efficient. Given the crime rate in Jamaica, it makes sense to have the extra cash as difficult to get to as possible.\n\nLynda Lee told me that all (or most) of the markets (dry goods and grocery stores) in Jamaica are owned by Chinese. After emancipation in 1838, Chinese were brought over as indentured servants. Over the years, after the practice was ended in 1920, the Chinese went into the mercantile business. Their descendants and more recent immigrants have become very successful and have, of course, become a very important part of the Jamaican economy.\n\nAfter this, we drove to downtown Montego Bay. Steve was on a mission to find Empire Records.\n\nSam Sharpe was a slave who was the leader of the Jamaican Baptist War of 1832. He was unusually, for the times, well educated and his fellow slaves looked to and respected. He became a leader and deacon of his church who preached about the evils of slavery. While he initially preached peaceful resistance to slavery, in December 1831, the resistance turned violent. Plantation owners retaliated against the slaves and, in turn, the slaves burned the crops. Hundreds of slaves and 14 whites were killed in the ensuing violence. Within a few weeks, the rebellion was put down and the leaders of the resistance, including Sharpe, were captured and hung. Sharpe is considered a Jamaican hero and along with the statue in Montego Bay, he is also on the Jamaican $50 bill.\n\nWhile we went on the quest to find this seemingly phantom record store, we were able to get a good look around the city. It is a mix of Georgian and somewhat modern architecture painted in bright Caribbean colors. Everyone seemed to have a purpose and a destination to get to, even if there wasn’t one. It’s also a very young country; Lynda Lee told me the average age is under 30. Everyone seems to have a dignity that one simply doesn’t see in many places. And, everyone we spoke to was simply so lovely and kind.\n\nA perfect example of this observation was this man: The Gospel Man.\n\nNote his cart. All hand carts in Jamaica have the wheel on the end to help steer. This is what made the Jamaicans believe they could field a bobsled team.\n\nAfter a bit more searching and general confusion about its exact location, we finally found the fabled Empire Records. It was basically stacks of vinyl in a lottery shop.\n\nSteve said that he could’ve gone all day just searching through the thousands of 45’s that were there (at one time the music means of choice in Jamaica). But, since Lynda Lee and I were waiting for him, he decided against it.\n\nAfter this, we decided despite the rather substantial breakfast, we were hungry again. So, it was off to Tastee’s for Jamaican Meat Patties (apparently this is the place to go; it’s like the McDonalds of Jamaica – only better http://www.tasteejamaica.com). They’re a direct descendant of the English pasty.\n\nThe filling was ground meat, most often beef, but it can be filled with other meats or even seafood, in a sauce and spiced with pepper, allspice, and some chiles. The crust is flaky (the yellow color comes from either egg yolks or turmeric in the dough).\n\nWe kinda became addicted to these. I really need to find a good source for frozen ones. Or, better yet, learn how to make them.\n\nAfter Tastee’s, we made our way back to Lynda Lee’s car for the ride back to the resort. But, one last stop: Scotchies. Scotchies is a very popular spot with locals and tourists alike. They have an extensive menu of jerk items, sausage, and fish.\n\nWe opted to buy a little each of a lot of things: jerk chicken, jerk pork, pork sausage, and grilled fish. This, along with some produce from the market would be our dinner.\n\nAs a quick explanation, jerk seasoning is basically a dry rub or paste that is rubbed, traditionally, on pork or chicken. It can be, however, used on other meats or even tofu. The two main ingredients in jerk seasoning are allspice (pimento) and habanero (Scotch Bonnet) peppers. other spices can include cinnamon, black pepper, garlic, nutmeg, thyme, and salt. Like any other indigenous spice blends in the world, it has hundreds of variations depending on the region and family. The meat is traditionally cooked on pimento wood (allspice trees). But, you’re just as likely to find street vendors cooking jerk chicken over charcoal in barrels.\n\nAfter this, Lynda Lee took us back to the resort. We agreed to meet at 8am saturday morning.\n\nShe left. We took our goodies upstairs, changed into our swimsuits and went down to the beach for a while.\n\nFinally, we decided to eat dinner. What we brought back was infinitely better than the resort food.\n\nNow, for the meat course.\n\nThe fish was cooked with vegetables and chiles and steamed in foil. Almost like an escabeche style. The pork was tenderloin and very tender and flavorful. The chicken, if a little dry, had a good spiciness to it. Steve’s favorite was the pork sausage. It had a good, if course, texture and a spicy flavor. It all had a kick to it that I’m guessing is ubiquitous in Jamaican cooking.\n\nWe concluded that it was the best food day we’d had on the trip. Well, the best day we’d had so far.\n\nBut, Saturday was coming and Lynda Lee was taking us out into the countryside.\n\nDay 4, Saturday, February 1\n\nLynda Lee met us downstairs at 8am ready to take Steve & me into the wilderness. We first made a stop in Montego Bay at a cook shop known as Poor Man’s Pelican for, what else? Ackee & Saltfish. Hey, eat what the natives eat. It’s usually better.\n\nThe breakfast here was a little different from the one in the market on Friday: The Ackee & Saltfish was made with the traditional salt cod instead of mackerel, the dumplings were boiled instead of fried, the yams were again boiled, and there was also a side of steamed & shredded cabbage.\n\nI can’t really compare the two. They were equally delicious, but different. I will say, though, I did like the boiled dumplings more than the fried. And, the Ackee & Saltfish at Poor Man’s Pelican was a bit oilier (which probably helps to explain the boiled dumplings – soaks up some of the oil).\n\nAfter breakfast, we headed the opposite direction towards the south and west coasts of the island. We had an eventual goal in mind: The Pelican Bar in Pelican Bay.\n\nThe Jamaican countryside is not at all what I expected it to be. I was thinking it would be all palm trees and sand. The stereotypical vision of what a Caribbean island should look like. Well, I was wrong. It ranged from lush and green to hilly to brown and scrubby the further west and south we went.\n\nThe island is ringed with basically one major highway (the A2) with smaller roads and spurs coming off of it. Outside of the major towns, much of it is basically a two-lane road (at least what we drove on), and depending on the parish administration, can either be a well maintained road or a rut-filled dirt track.\n\nI was admittedly reluctant to ask Lynda Lee to stop so I could take photos because there were essentially no shoulders. One side of the road was rock face and the other was drop off into a deep valley. I finally worked up the nerve to ask her to stop and pull over so I could take a few photos. We picked a good place.\n\nAfter we had been there a few minutes, a gentleman walked up to us to see if we needed help. When Lynda Lee explained we were just looking around, he started talking to us about the fruit that he had in his hands – sweetcups. They are relatives of the passionfruit and crack just like eggs.\n\nWhile Lynda & I were talking to him, a lady walked up to see what was going on. She and Steve began talking. From what he could glean from their conversation (we were pretty deep into the country by now, so her Patois accent was quite thick), she was on her way to a funeral. The man was shot, she said, and his body was frozen until they could bring him home. She was quite open about it.\n\nShe was dressed in what was likely her best clothes and wanted Steve to take her picture; so he did.\n\nAfter a few more nature shots:\n\nSoon, we were off again.\n\nOur next stop was the small fishing village of Bluefields. Lynda Lee had done some work there with USAID about 10 years or so ago and wanted to show us around a bit.\n\nShe said that while USAID basically provided the funding and got the program going, the local fishermen took it upon themselves to clean up the bay, begin fishing further out into the sea, and allow the fish to repopulate the bay. They learned how to manage a sustainable fishing model.\n\nAs is my wont, I started wandering around.\n\nWe continued on our way from Bluefields to the Pelican Bar.\n\nThe Pelican Bar has become quite the attraction since it was first built in 2001. It was built originally by a fisherman, Floyd Forbes, as a place where he and his fellow fishermen could hang out after a day’s work. He built it in Pelican Bay (so named because of the large number of pelicans who nest and roost there) on a sandbar. Before long, the local hotels saw the potential of promoting the bar as a way to attract tourists to the area. In 2004, the bar was destroyed by Hurricane Ivan. Floyd didn’t have the money to rebuild. However, a local hotel owner donated money and materials so the Pelican Bar could rebuild.\n\nAnd a legend was born.\n\nBefore we left to go to the bar, Lynda Lee pulled out a rather sinister looking tool and told us that it was used to open jelly coconuts. That’s when I learned jelly coconuts are simply fully ripe coconuts that haven’t dried yet (becoming the coconuts we’re all familiar with). She cut the stem out with this tool – it looked like a very thin, curved, sharp trowel – and we all had a refreshing glass of jelly coconut water.\n\nThe bar itself is about a 10-minute boat ride from shore. You simply hire a boat to take you out and the bartender will call when you’re ready to be picked up. Or, you can also set a time for the driver to pick you up. I think.\n\nOnce you get up to the bar, the driver ties the boat to the steps and you carefully get out.\n\nThis is the first thing Steve & I saw when we stepped inside:\n\nObviously, some people brought memorabilia to leave here and there is a lot of carving of names in the wood:\n\nSteve & I both looked at each other and said, “Who brings a license plate on vacation?”.\n\nAfter getting past the tourist-left rubbish, I made a point to just enjoy the beauty of the place.\n\nLynda Lee went snorkeling, Steve was inside drinking a Red Stripe, and I sat on the steps in the water and just decided to revel in the sounds of the sea.\n\nAfter awhile, I moved to the back to dry off and get a little more sun. Steve got in the sea and swam a bit while Lynda Lee joined me.\n\nWhile Lynda Lee and I were talking, a fisherman docked at the bar and asked us if we wanted to buy some of his catch. We declined. However, you can buy seafood from the fishermen and they’ll cook it up for you at the bar. Or, sometimes, the bar has something already made. We were still full from breakfast, so we didn’t eat anything.\n\nBut, the fisherman did join some of the other gentlemen in the bar for a game of dominoes. It seems to be a contact sport here. At the least, it’s taken very seriously. It was fun to watch.\n\nAbout this time, we asked the bartender to call to shore so our boat could pick us up. The wind was starting to pick up and we could see clouds on the horizon, so we decided it was a good time to go. Also, another boat of tourists was coming towards the bar. Call me anti-social, but I wasn’t having any of that.\n\nBut first, since we had to wait anyway, a little more relaxation and photos.\n\nOur boat arrived and we were ferried back to shore. After hosing ourselves and our belongings off – kinda – we headed back towards Montego Bay.\n\nWe ran into some pretty heavy rain and the reality of the rut-filled dirt roads hit hard. They become mud pits. Lynda Lee smartly had a 4-wheel drive; so, while problematic, the roads were passable.\n\nOn our way out, we passed through a town called Whitehouse where they were setting up a row of cookshops for the Saturday night crowd. Coming back, the shops were open for business and we decided to stop.\n\nWe were immediately surrounded by vendors hocking their wares. It all looked really good. Lynda Lee, in her quiet way, told them we were just looking and they seemed to back off rather quickly. One lady did say that she had some fish fresh out of the fryer. Lynda Lee said that was the person to see.\n\nSnack time. We had some fried parrot fish, bammy bread, and pepper shrimp (better known to us as crawfish)\n\nIt was, quite honestly, the best fried fish I’ve ever eaten. I don’t know what she did, but it was magic. If I ever get back there, I’m gonna ask her.\n\nLynda Lee told us that these cookstands really cater to the locals rather than tourists. I conc"
