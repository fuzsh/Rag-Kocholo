        "text": "Rosario de Acuña (born 1851, Madrid, Spain—died 1923, Gijón) was a Spanish playwright, essayist, and short-story writer known for her controversial liberal views.\n\nLittle is known of Acuña’s early life. One of Spain’s few women playwrights, she was considered radical for her willingness to address such issues as religious fanaticism, atheism, illegitimacy, civil marriage (and the possibility of divorce, anathema in Roman Catholic Spain), and reform of the criminal justice system.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nPoetry: First Lines\n\nAcuña is best known for her verse drama Rienzi el tribuno (produced 1876; “Rienzi the Tribune”); the tragedy describes the futile efforts of the 14th-century Roman tribune Cola di Rienzo to restore the greatness of ancient Rome. In Amor a la patria (1877; “Love of Country”), which celebrates peasants’ resistance to Napoleon, the playwright contrasts the noble heroism of women with the venality of the male characters. Her other verse dramas include El padre Juan (1891), which caused a scandal with its attack on hypocritical clergy, and La voz de la patria (1893; “The Voice of the Nation”), which stirred further controversy with its portrayal of a pregnant woman who tries to prevent her fiancé from enlisting in the army."
