He remained there for forty eight consecutive years, bequeathing the property to his son, Jose Laureano Granado, who in turn, with his mother, sold the homestead to Ramon Muzquiz in 1839.

Maria Robaina de BethÃ©ncourt claimed be a descendant of Jean de BÃ©thencourt who, early in the fifteenth century, achieved the conquest of the Canary Islands for Henry III of Castile. The Bethencourt family dates back to circa 1200 in Normandy, France where the first Bethencourt joined the Duke of Normandy in the invasion of England in 1066. This was four hundred years before descendant Jean de BÃ©thencourt invaded the Canary Islands in the early 1400's. In 1405 he visited Normandy, and returned with fresh colonists who occupied Hierro. In December 1406 he left the islands to the government of his nephew, Maciot de BÃ©thencourt, reserving for himself the royal title and a share in any profits obtained. He returned to Normandy, where he appears to have spent the remainder of his days. He died in 1422, and was buried in the church of Grainville-la-Teinturire in PÃ¡jara on the island of Fuerteventura.
