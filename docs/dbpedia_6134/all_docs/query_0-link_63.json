        "text": "American children's song\n\nFor other uses, see Wheels on the Bus.\n\n\"The Wheels on the Bus\"SongLanguageEnglishPublishedDecember 1937GenreSongwriter(s)Verna Hill\n\n\"The Wheels on the Bus\" is an American folk song written by Verna Hills (1898–1990). The earliest known publishing of the lyrics is the December 1937 issue of American Childhood,[1] originally called \"The Bus\", with the lyrics being \"The wheels of the bus\", with each verse ending in lines relevant to what the verse spoke of, as opposed to the current standard \"all through the town\" (or \"all day long\" in some versions).\n\nIt is a popular children's song in the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Sweden, Italy, Denmark, the Netherlands and Brazil. It has a repetitive rhythm, making the song easy for many people to sing, in a manner similar to the song \"99 Bottles of Beer\". It is based on the traditional British song \"Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush\". The song is also sometimes sung to the tune of \"Buffalo Gals\", as in the version done by Raffi.\n\n1. The wheels on the bus go round and round\n\nRound and round\n\nRound and round\n\nThe wheels on the bus go round and round\n\nAll through the town\n\n2. The wipers on the bus go, \"Swish, swish, swish\"\n\n\"Swish, swish, swish\"\n\n\"Swish, swish, swish\"\n\nThe wipers on the bus go, \"Swish, swish, swish\"\n\nAll through the town\n\n3. The driver on the bus goes, \"Move on back\"\n\n\"Move on back\"\n\n\"Move on back\"\n\nThe driver on the bus goes, \"Move on back\"\n\nAll through the town\n\n4. The people on the bus go up and down\n\nUp and down\n\nUp and down\n\nThe people on the bus go up and down\n\nAll through the town\n\n5. The horn on the bus goes, \"Beep, beep, beep\"\n\n\"Beep, beep, beep\"\n\n\"Beep, beep, beep\"\n\nThe horn on the bus goes, \"Beep, beep, beep\"\n\nAll through the town\n\n6. The baby on the bus goes, \"Wah, Wah, Wah\"\n\n\"Wah, wah, wah\"\n\n\"Wah, Wah, Wah\"\n\nThe baby on the bus goes, \"Wah,\n\nWah, Wah\"\n\nAll through the town\n\n7. The mommies on the bus go, \"Shh, shh, shh\"\n\n\"Shh, shh, shh\"\n\n\"Shh, shh, shh\"\n\nThe daddies on the bus go, \"Shh, shh, shh\"\n\nAll through the town\n\nNormally followed by \"The wipers on the bus go swish swish swish\" (with action), \"the horn on the bus goes beep beep beep\", and \"the people on the bus go up and down\" (with action). Some versions substitute \"bounce up and down\" for \"go up and down\", and some modern commercial recordings of the song in children's toys simplify the tune by copying notes 7 through 9 onto notes 13 through 15.[clarification needed]\n\nLyrics as they were originally found in the December 1937 issue of American Childhood:\n\n1. The wheels of the bus go round and round,\n\nRound and round, round and round;\n\nThe wheels of the bus go round and round,\n\nOver the city streets.\n\n2. The horn of the bus goes \"Too-to-too,\n\n\"Too-to-too, too-to-too,\"\n\nthe horn of the bus goes \"Too-to-too\"\n\nAt the other busses it meets.\n\n3. The people in the bus go up and down,\n\nUp and down,\n\nup and down;\n\nThe people in the bus go up and down,\n\nBouncing off their seats.\n\nModern versions of the song change the lyrics in the seventh verse to say the daddies on the bus go \"I love you\". This can be seen in the popular remake by the children’s show Cocomelon.\n\nNote that this version does not make any reference to the melody that is commonly attached to the song.\n\nOther recordings\n\n[edit]\n\n\"The Wheels on the Bus\"Single by Mad DonnaB-side\"Hush, Little Baby\"Released4 May 2002Length2:25Label\n\nStar Harbour\n\nAll Around The World Disco 0202R\n\nSongwriter(s)Verna Hills\n\nIn 2002, American Madonna impersonator Michelle Chappel, under the stage name \"Mad Donna\", released a single which sampled the nursery rhyme,[2] featuring a version of Madonna's 1998 song \"Ray of Light\" over which the classic children's song was sung.[3] The single reached No. 17 in the United Kingdom and also made the charts elsewhere in Europe.[4]\n\nThe song also has lyrics in Swedish, Hjulen på bussen (\"The Wheels on the Bus\"), and among the artists who have recorded it are Pernilla Wahlgren in 1996.[5]"
