Anaphora is related to epistrophe, which is when words are repeated at the end of clauses, phrases, or sentences. The word “anaphora” means “to carry up or back” in Greek.\n\nExamples:\n\nMany examples of anaphora can be found in the Old Testament of the Bible’s Song of Songs. There are two separate uses of anaphora in this instance (from Chapter Four, Verses One and Two): the first is the speaker’s celebration of his bride’s beauty, and the second is a list of her admirable qualities.\n\nLook at you! You are beautiful, my darling.\n\nLook at you! You are so beautiful.\n\nYour eyes behind your veil are doves\n\nyour hair is like a flock of goats\n\ncoming down from Mt. Gilead.\n\nYour teeth are like a flock of sheep about to be sheared,\n\nwho are coming up from being washed.\n\nRepetition\n\nA literary device in which a word or phrase is repeated two or more times is known as repetition. Because repetition takes so many different forms, it is rarely thought of as a single type. Instead, consider repetition as a broad category that encompasses a variety of more specific figures of speech, all of which employ repetition in different ways.\n\nExamples:\n\nBob Dylan won the Nobel prize for literature for the genius of his lyrics. His song “Masters of War” shows how polysyndeton can be used to build a specific emotion:\n\n“And I hope that you die\n\nAnd your death will come soon\n\nI will follow your casket\n\nIn the pale afternoon\n\nAnd I’ll watch while you’re lowered\n\nDown to your deathbed\n\nAnd I’ll stand over your grave\n\n‘Til I’m sure that you’re dead”\n\nThe final lines of this song of protest against the politicians behind the Vietnam War are filled with rage and disgust. Dylan’s use of polysyndeton allows him to add phrase after phrase, far beyond where listeners might expect him to stop, in order to fully convey the depth of his rage and hatred for the politicians he refers to as “masters of war.”\n\nConclusion\n\nHopefully, this article will give you a clear idea about all figures of speech.
