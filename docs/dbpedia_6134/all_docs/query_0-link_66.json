Pale: Be Wary of Your Friends\n\nBook I Part X IX : Be Flexible\n\nBook I Part I: His Task\n\nShould anyone here not know the art of love,\n\nread this, and learn by reading how to love.\n\nBy art the boat’s set gliding, with oar and sail,\n\nby art the chariot’s swift: love’s ruled by art.\n\nAutomedon was skilled with Achilles’s chariot reins,\n\nTiphys in Thessaly was steersman of the Argo,\n\nVenus appointed me as guide to gentle Love:\n\nI’ll be known as Love’s Tiphys, and Automedon.\n\nIt’s true Love’s wild, and one who often flouts me:\n\nbut he’s a child of tender years, fit to be ruled.\n\nChiron made the young Achilles perfect at the lyre,\n\nand tempered his wild spirits through peaceful art.\n\nHe, who so terrified his enemies and friends,\n\nthey say he greatly feared the aged Centaur.\n\nThat hand that Hector was destined to know,\n\nwas held out, at his master’s orders, to be flogged.\n\nI am Love’s teacher as Chiron was Achilles’s,\n\nboth wild boys, both children of a goddess.\n\nYet the bullock’s neck is bowed beneath the yoke,\n\nand the spirited horse’s teeth worn by the bit.\n\nAnd Love will yield to me, though with his bow\n\nhe wounds my heart, shakes at me his burning torch.\n\nThe more he pierces me, the more violently he burns me,\n\nso much the fitter am I to avenge the wounds.\n\nNor will I falsely say you gave me the art, Apollo,\n\nno voice from a heavenly bird gives me advice,\n\nI never caught sight of Clio or Clio’s sisters\n\nwhile herding the flocks, Ascra, in your valleys:\n\nExperience prompts this work: listen to the expert poet:\n\nI sing true: Venus, help my venture!\n\nFar away from here, you badges of modesty,\n\nthe thin headband, the ankle-covering dress.\n\nI sing of safe love, permissible intrigue,\n\nand there’ll be nothing sinful in my song.\n\nNow the first task for you who come as a raw recruit\n\nis to find out who you might wish to love.\n\nThe next task is to make sure that she likes you:\n\nthe third, to see to it that the love will last.\n\nThat’s my aim, that’s the ground my chariot will cover:\n\nthat’s the post my thundering wheels will scrape.\n\nBook I Part II: How to Find Her\n\nWhile you’re still free, and can roam on a loose rein,\n\npick one to whom you could say: ‘You alone please me.’\n\nShe won’t come falling for you out of thin air:\n\nthe right girl has to be searched for: use your eyes.\n\nThe hunter knows where to spread nets for the stag,\n\nhe knows what valleys hide the angry boar:\n\nthe wild-fowler knows the woods: the fisherman\n\nknows the waters where the most fish spawn:\n\nYou too, who search for the essence of lasting love,\n\nmust be taught the places that the girls frequent.\n\nI don’t demand you set your sails, and search,\n\nor wear out some long road to discover them.\n\nPerseus brought Andromeda from darkest India,\n\nand Trojan Paris snatched his girl from Greece,\n\nRome will grant you lots of such lovely girls,\n\nyou’ll say: ‘Here’s everything the world has had.’\n\nYour Rome’s as many girls as Gargara’s sheaves,\n\nas Methymna’s grapes, as fishes in the sea,\n\nas birds in the hidden branches, stars in the sky:\n\nVenus, Aeneas’s mother, haunts his city.\n\nIf you’d catch them very young and not yet grown,\n\nreal child-brides will come before your eyes:\n\nif it’s young girls you want, thousands will please you.\n\nYou’ll be forced to be unsure of your desires:\n\nif you delight greatly in older wiser years,\n\nhere too, believe me, there’s an even greater crowd.\n\nBook I Part III: Search while you’re out Walking\n\nJust walk slowly under Pompey’s shady colonnade,\n\nwhen the sun’s in Leo, on the back of Hercules’s lion:\n\nor where Octavia added to her dead son Marcellus’s gifts,\n\nwith those rich works of foreign marble.\n\nDon’t miss the Portico that takes its name\n\nfrom Livia its creator, full of old masters:\n\nor where the daring Danaids prepare to murder their poor husbands,\n\nand their fierce father stands, with out-stretched sword.\n\nAnd don’t forget the shrine of Adonis, Venus wept for,\n\nand the sacred Sabbath rites of the Syrian Jews.\n\nDon’t skip the Memphite temple of the linen-clad heifer:\n\nshe makes many a girl what she herself was to Jove.\n\nAnd the law-courts (who’d believe it?) they suit love:\n\na flame is often found in the noisy courts:\n\nwhere the Appian waters pulse into the air,\n\nfrom under Venus’s temple, made of marble,\n\nthere the lawyer’s often caught by love,\n\nand he who guides others, fails to guide himself:\n\nin that place of eloquence often his words desert him,\n\nand a new case starts, his own cause is the brief.\n\nThere Venus, from her neighbouring temples, laughs:\n\nhe, who was once the counsel, now wants to be the client.\n\nBook I Part IV: Or at the Theatre\n\nBut hunt for them, especially, at the tiered theatre:\n\nthat place is the most fruitful for your needs.\n\nThere you’ll find one to love, or one you can play with,\n\none to be with just once, or one you might wish to keep.\n\nAs ants return home often in long processions,\n\ncarrying their favourite food in their mouths,\n\nor as the bees buzz through the flowers and thyme,\n\namong their pastures and fragrant chosen meadows,\n\nso our fashionable ladies crowd to the famous shows:\n\nmy choice is often constrained by such richness.\n\nThey come to see, they come to be seen as well:\n\nthe place is fatal to chaste modesty.\n\nThese shows were first made troublesome by Romulus,\n\nwhen the raped Sabines delighted unmarried men.\n\nThen no awnings hung from the marble theatre,\n\nthe stage wasn’t stained with saffron perfumes:\n\nThen what the shady Palatine provided, leaves\n\nsimply placed, was all the artless scene:\n\nThe audience sat on tiers made from turf,\n\nand covered their shaggy hair, as best they could, with leaves.\n\nThey watched, and each with his eye observed the girl\n\nhe wanted, and trembled greatly in his silent heart.\n\nWhile, to the measure of the homely Etruscan flute,\n\nthe dancer, with triple beat, struck the levelled earth,\n\namongst the applause (applause that was never artful then)\n\nthe king gave the watched-for signal for the rape.\n\nThey sprang up straightaway, showing their intent by shouting,\n\nand eagerly took possession of the women.\n\nAs doves flee the eagle, in a frightened crowd,\n\nas the new-born lamb runs from the hostile wolf:\n\nso they fled in panic from the lawless men,\n\nand not one showed the colour she had before.\n\nNow they all fear as one, but not with one face of fear:\n\nSome tear their hair: some sit there, all will lost:\n\none mourns silently, another cries for her mother in vain:\n\none moans, one faints: one stays, while that one runs:\n\nthe captive girls were led away, a joyful prize,\n\nand many made even fear itself look fitting.\n\nWhoever showed too much fight, and denied her lover,\n\nhe held her clasped high to his loving heart,\n\nand said to her: ‘Why mar your tender cheeks with tears?\n\nas your father to your mother, I’ll be to you.’\n\nRomulus, alone, knew what was fitting for soldiers:\n\nI’ll be a soldier, if you give me what suits me.\n\nFrom that I suppose came the theatres’ usual customs:\n\nnow too they remain a snare for the beautiful.\n\nBook I Part V: Or at the Races, or the Circus\n\nDon’t forget the races, those noble stallions:\n\nthe Circus holds room for a vast obliging crowd.\n\nNo need here for fingers to give secret messages,\n\nnor a nod of the head to tell you she accepts:\n\nYou can sit by your lady: nothing’s forbidden,\n\npress your thigh to hers, as you can do, all the time:\n\nand it’s good the rows force you close, even if you don’t like it,\n\nsince the girl is touched through the rules of the place.\n\nNow find your reason for friendly conversation,\n\nand first of all engage in casual talk.\n\nMake earnest enquiry whose those horses are:\n\nand rush to back her favourite, whatever it is.\n\nWhen the crowded procession of ivory gods goes by,\n\nyou clap fervently for Lady Venus:\n\nif by chance a speck of dust falls in the girl’s lap,\n\nas it may, let it be flicked away by your fingers:\n\nand if there’s nothing, flick away the nothing:\n\nlet anything be a reason for you to serve her.\n\nIf her skirt is trailing too near the ground,\n\nlift it, and raise it carefully from the dusty earth:\n\nStraightaway, the prize for service, if she allows it,\n\nis that your eyes catch a glimpse of her legs.\n\nDon’t forget to look at who’s sitting behind you,\n\nthat he doesn’t press her sweet back with his knee.\n\nSmall things please light minds: it’s very helpful\n\nto puff up her cushion with a dextrous touch.\n\nAnd it’s good to raise a breeze with a light fan,\n\nand set a hollow stool beneath her tender feet.\n\nAnd the Circus brings assistance to new love,\n\nand the scattered sand of the gladiator’s ring.\n\nVenus’ boy often fights in that sand,\n\nand who see wounds, themselves receive a wound.\n\nWhile talking, touching hands, checking the programme,\n\nand asking, having bet, which one will win,\n\nwounded he groans, and feels the winged dart,\n\nand himself becomes a part of the show he sees.\n\nWhen, lately, Caesar, in mock naval battle,\n\nexhibited the Greek and Persian fleets,\n\nsurely young men and girls came from either coast,\n\nand all the peoples of the world were in the City?\n\nWho did not find one he might love in that crowd?\n\nAh, how many were tortured by an alien love!\n\nBook I Part VI: Triumphs are Good too!\n\nBehold, now Caesar’s planning to add to our rule\n\nwhat’s left of earth: now the far East will be ours.\n\nParthia , we’ll have vengeance: Crassus’s bust will cheer,\n\nand those standards wickedly laid low by barbarians.\n\nThe avenger’s here, the leader, proclaimed, of tender years,\n\nand a boy wages war’s un-boy-like agenda.\n\nCowards, don’t count the birthdays of the gods:\n\na Caesar’s courage flowers before its time.\n\nDivine genius grows faster than its years,\n\nand suffers as harmful evils the cowardly delays.\n\nHercules was a child when he crushed two serpents\n\nin both his hands, already worthy of Jupiter in his cradle.\n\nHow old were you, Bacchus, who are still a boy,\n\nwhen conquered India trembled to your rod?\n\nYour father’s years and powers arm you, boy,\n\nand with your father’s powers and years you’ll win:\n\nthough your first beginnings must be in debt to such a name,\n\nnow prince of the young, but one day prince of the old:\n\nYour brothers are with you, avenge your brothers’ wounds:\n\nyour father is with you, keep your father’s laws.\n\nYour and your country’s father endowed you with arms:\n\nthe enemy stole his kingship from an unwilling parent:\n\nYou hold a pious shaft, he a wicked arrow:\n\nJustice and piety stick to your standard.\n\nLet Parthia’s cause be lost: and their armies:\n\nlet my leader add Eastern wealth to Latium.\n\nBoth your fathers, Mars and Caesar, grant you power:\n\nThrough you one is a god, and one will be.\n\nSee, I augur your triumph: I’ll reply with a votive song,\n\nand you’ll be greatly celebrated on my lips.\n\nYou’ll stand and exhort your troops with my words:\n\nO let my words not lack your courage!\n\nI’ll speak of Parthian backs and Roman fronts,\n\nand shafts the enemy hurl from flying horses.\n\nIf you flee, to win, Parthia, what’s left for you in defeat?\n\nMars already has your evil eye.\n\nSo the day will be, when you, beautiful one,\n\ngolden, will go by, drawn by four snowy horses.\n\nThe generals will go before you, necks weighed down with chains,\n\nlest they flee to safety as they did before.\n\nThe happy crowd of youths and girls will watch,\n\nthat day will gladden every heart.\n\nAnd if she, among them, asks the name of a king,\n\nwhat place, what mountains, and what stream’s displayed,\n\nyou can reply to all, and more if she asks:\n\nand what you don’t know, reply as memory prompts.\n\nThat’s Euphrates, his brow crowned with reeds:\n\nthat’ll be Tigris with the long green hair.\n\nI make those Armenians, that’s Persia’s Danaan crown:\n\nthat was a town in the hills of Achaemenia.\n\nHim and him, they’re generals: and say what names they have,\n\nif you can, the true ones, if not the most fitting.\n\nBook I Part VII: There’s always the Dinner-Table\n\nThe table laid for a feast also gives you an opening:\n\nThere’s something more than wine you can look for there.\n\nOften rosy Love has clasped Bacchus’s horns,\n\ndrawing him to his gentle arms, as he lay there.\n\nAnd when wine has soaked Cupid’s drunken wings,\n\nhe’s stayed, weighed down, a captive of the place.\n\nIt’s true he quickly shakes out his damp feathers:\n\nthough still the heart that’s sprinkled by love is hurt.\n\nWine rouses courage and is fit for passion:\n\ncare flies, and deep drinking dilutes it.\n\nThen laughter comes, the poor man dons the horns,\n\nthen pain and sorrow leave, and wrinkled brows.\n\nThen what’s rarest in our age appears to our minds,\n\nSimplicity: all art dispelled by the god.\n\nOften at that time girls captivated men’s wits,\n\nand Venus was in the vine, flame in the fire.\n\nDon’t trust the treacherous lamplight overmuch:\n\nnight and wine can harm your view of beauty.\n\nParis saw the goddesses in the light, a cloudless heaven,\n\nwhen he said to Venus: ‘Venus, you win, over them both.’\n\nFaults are hidden at night: every blemish is forgiven,\n\nand the hour makes whichever girl you like beautiful.\n\nJudge jewellery, and fabric stained with purple,\n\njudge a face, or a figure, in the light.\n\nBook I Part VIII: And Finally There’s the Beach\n\nWhy enumerate every female meeting place fit for the hunter?\n\nThe grains of sand give way before the number.\n\nWhy speak of Baiae, its shore splendid with sails,\n\nwhere the waters steam with sulphurous heat?\n\nHere one returning, his heart wounded, said:\n\n‘That water’s not as healthy as they claim.’\n\nBehold the suburban woodland temple of Diana,\n\nand the kingdom murder rules with guilty hand.\n\nShe, who is virgin, who hates Cupid’s darts,\n\ngives people many wounds, has many to give.\n\nBook I Part IX: How To Win Her\n\nSo far, riding her unequal wheels, the Muse has taught you\n\nwhere you might choose your love, where to set your nets.\n\nNow I’ll undertake to tell you what pleases her,\n\nby what arts she’s caught, itself a work of highest art.\n\nWhoever you are, lovers everywhere, attend, with humble minds,\n\nand you, masses, show you support me: use your thumbs.\n\nFirst let faith enter into your mind: every one of them\n\ncan be won: you’ll win her, if you only set your snares.\n\nBirds will sooner be silent in the Spring, cicadas in summer,\n\nan Arcadian hound turn his back on a hare,\n\nthan a woman refuse a young man’s flattering words:\n\nEven she you might think dislikes it, will like it.\n\nSecret love’s just as pleasing to women as men.\n\nMen pretend badly: she hides her desire.\n\nIf it was proper for men not to be the first to ask,\n\nwoman’s role would be to take the part of the asker.\n\nThe cow lows to the bull in gentle pastures:\n\nthe mare whinnies to the hoofed stallion.\n\nDesire in us is milder and less frantic:\n\nthe male fire has its lawful limits.\n\nRemember Byblis, who burned with incestuous love,\n\nfor her brother, and bravely punished herself with the noose?\n\nMyrrha loved her father, but not as a daughter should,\n\nand then was hidden by the covering bark:\n\noozing those tears, that pour from the tree as fragrance,\n\nand whose droplets take their name from the girl.\n\nOnce, in the shady valleys of wooded Ida\n\nthere was a white bull, glory of the herd,\n\none small black mark set between his horns:\n\nit the sole blemish, the rest was milky-white.\n\nThe heifers of Cnossos and Cydon longed\n\nto have him mount up on their backs.\n\nPasiphae joyed in adultery with the bull:\n\nshe hated the handsome heifers with jealousy.\n\nI sing what is well-known: not even Crete, the hundred-citied,\n\ncan deny it, however much Cretans lie.\n\nThey say that, with unpractised hands, she plucked\n\nfresh leaves and tenderest grasses for the bull.\n\nShe went as one of the herd, unhindered by any care\n\nfor that husband of hers: Minos was ousted by a bull.\n\nWhy put on your finest clothes, Pasiphae?\n\nYour lover can appreciate none of your wealth.\n\nWhy have a mirror with you, when you seek highland cattle?\n\nWhy continually smooth your hair, you foolish woman?\n\nBut believe the mirror that denies you’re a heifer.\n\nHow you wish that brow of yours could bear horns!\n\nIf you’d please Minos, don’t seek out adulterers:\n\nIf you want to cheat your husband, cheat with a man!\n\nThe queen left her marriage bed for woods and fields,\n\nlike a Maenad roused by the Boeotian god, they say.\n\nAh, how often, with angry face, she spied a cow,\n\nand said: ‘Now, how can she please my lord?\n\nLook, how she frisks before him in the tender grass:\n\ndoubtless the foolish thing thinks that she’s lovely.’\n\nShe spoke, and straightaway had her led from the vast herd,\n\nthe innocent thing dragged under the arching yoke,\n\nor felled before the altar, forced to be a false sacrifice,\n\nand, delighted, held her rival’s entrails in her hand.\n\nThe number of times she killed rivals to please the gods,\n\nand said, holding the entrails: ‘Go, and please him for me!’\n\nNow she claims to be Io, and now Europa,\n\none who’s a heifer, the other borne by the bull.\n\nYet he filled her, the king of the herd, deceived\n\nby a wooden cow, and their offspring betrayed its breeding.\n\nIf Cretan Aerope had spurned Thyestes’s love\n\n(and isn’t it hard to forego even one man?),\n\nthe Sun would not have veered from his course mid-way,\n\nand turned back his chariot and horses towards Dawn.\n\nThe daughter who savaged Nisus’s purple lock\n\npresses rabid dogs down with her thighs and groin.\n\nAgamemnon who escaped Mars on land, Neptune at sea,\n\nbecame the victim of his murderous wife.\n\nWho would not weep at Corinthian Creusa’s flames,\n\nand that mother bloodstained by her children’s murder?\n\nPhoenix, Amyntor’s son wept out of sightless eyes:\n\nHippolytus was torn by his fear-maddened horses.\n\nPhineus , why blind your innocent sons?\n\nThat punishment will return on your own head.\n\nAll these things were driven by woman’s lust:\n\nit’s more fierce than ours, and more frenzied.\n\nSo, on, and never hesitate in hoping for any woman:\n\nthere’s hardly one among them who’ll deny you.\n\nWhether they give or not, they’re delighted to be asked:\n\nAnd even if you fail, you’ll escape unharmed.\n\nBut why fail, when there’s pleasure in new delights\n\nand the more foreign the more they capture the heart?\n\nThe seed’s often more fertile in foreign fields,\n\nand a neighbour’s herd always has richer milk.\n\nBook I Part X: First Secure the Maid\n\nBut to get to know your desired-one’s maid\n\nis your first care: she’ll smooth your way.\n\nSee if she’s close to her mistress’s thoughts,\n\nand has plenty of true knowledge of her secret jests.\n\nCorrupt her with promises, and with prayers:\n\nyou’ll easily get what you want, if she wishes.\n\nShe’ll tell the time (the doctors would know it too)\n\nwhen her mistress’s mind is receptive, fit for love.\n\nHer mind will be fit for love when she luxuriates\n\nin fertility, like the crop on some rich soil.\n\nWhen hearts are glad, and nothing sad constrains them,\n\nthey’re open: Venus steals in then with seductive art.\n\nSo Troy was defended with sorrowful conflict:\n\nin joy, the Horse, pregnant with soldiers, was received.\n\nShe’s also to be tried when she’s wounded, pained by a rival:\n\nmake it your task then to see that she’s avenged.\n\nThe maid can rouse her, when she combs her hair in the morning,\n\nand add her oar to the work of your sails,\n\nand, sighing to herself in a low murmur, say:\n\n‘But I doubt that you’ll be able to make her pay.’\n\nThen she should speak of you, and add persuasive words,\n\nand swear you’re dying, crazed with love.\n\nBut hurry, lest the sails fall and the breeze dies:\n\nanger melts away, with time, like fragile ice.\n\nYou ask perhaps if one should take the maid herself?\n\nSuch a plan brings the greatest risk with it.\n\nIn one case, fresh from bed, she’ll get busy, in another be tardy,\n\nin one case you’re a prize for her mistress, in the other herself.\n\nThere’s chance in it: even if it favours the idea,\n\nmy advice nevertheless is to abstain.\n\nI don’t pick my way over sharp peaks and precipices,\n\nno youth will be caught out being lead by me.\n\nStill, while she’s giving and taking messages,\n\nif her body pleases you as much as her zeal,\n\nmake the lady your first priority, her companion the next:\n\nLove should never be begun with a servant.\n\nI warn you of this, if art’s skill is to be believed,\n\nand don’t let the wind blow my words out to sea:\n\nfollow the thing through or don’t attempt it:\n\nshe’ll endure the whispers once she’s guilty herself.\n\nIt’s no help if the bird escapes when its wings are limed:\n\nit’s no good if the boar gets free from a loosened net.\n\nHold fast to the stricken fish you’ve caught on the hook:\n\npress home the attempt, don’t leave off till you’ve won.\n\nShe’ll not give you away, sharing the guilt for the crime,\n\nand you’ll know whatever your lady’s done, and said.\n\nBut hide it well: if the informer’s well hidden,\n\nyou’ll always secretly know your mistress’s mind.\n\nBook I Part XI: Don’t Forget Her Birthday!\n\nIt’s a mistake to think that only farmers working the fields,\n\nand sailors, need to keep an eye on the season:\n\nSeed can’t always be trusted to the furrow,\n\nor a hollow ship to the wine-dark sea,\n\nIt’s not always safe to capture tender girls:\n\noften the time itself makes for success.\n\nIf her birthday’s here, or the April Kalends,\n\nthat delight in joining months, Venus’s to Mars,\n\nor if the Circus is decorated, not as before\n\nwith clay figurines but with the wealth of kings,\n\ndelay the thing: then winter’s harsh, the Pleiades are here,\n\nthen the tender Kid is merged with the ocean wave:\n\nit’s best to hold off then: then he who trusts the deep,\n\ncan scarcely save the wreckage of his mangled boat.\n\nIt’s fine to start on that day of tears when the Allia\n\nflowed with the blood poured from Roman wounds,\n\nor when the Sabbath day returns, the holy day\n\nof the Syrian Jews, less suitable for buying things.\n\nLet your mistress’s birthday be one of great terror to you:\n\nthat’s a black day when anything has to be given.\n\nHowever much you avoid it, she’ll still win: it’s\n\na woman’s skill, to strip wealth from an ardent lover.\n\nA loose-robed pedlar comes to your lady: she likes to buy:\n\nand explains his prices while you’re sitting there.\n\nShe’ll ask you to look, because you know what to look for:\n\nthen kiss you: then ask you to buy her something there.\n\nShe swears that she’ll be happy with it, for years,\n\nbut she needs it now, now the price is right.\n\nIf you say you haven’t the money in the house, she’ll ask\n\nfor a note of hand – and you’re sorry you learnt to write.\n\nWhy - she asks doesn’t she for money as if it’s her birthday,\n\njust for the cake, and how often it is her birthday, if she’s in need?\n\nWhy - she weeps doesn’t she, mournfully, for a sham loss,\n\nthat imaginary gem that fell from her pierced ear?\n\nThey many times ask for gifts, they never give in return:\n\nyou lose, and you’ll get no thanks for your loss.\n\nAnd ten mouths with as many tongues wouldn’t be enough\n\nfor me to describe the wicked tricks of whores.\n\nBook I Part XII: Write and Make Promises\n\nTry wax to pave the way, pour it out on scraped tablets:\n\nlet wax be your mind’s true confidante.\n\nBring her your flattering words and play the lover:\n\nand, whoever you are, add a humble prayer.\n\nAchilles was moved by prayer to grant Hector’s body to Priam:\n\na god’s anger’s deflected by the voice of prayer.\n\nMake promises: what harm can a promise do?\n\nAnyone can be rich in promises.\n\nHope lasts, if she’s once believed in,\n\na useful, though deceptive, goddess.\n\nIf you’ve given, you can quite reasonably be forgotten:\n\nshe carried it off, and now she’s nothing to lose.\n\nBut if you don’t give, always appear about to:\n\nlike barren fields that always cheat the farmer,\n\nlike the gambler who goes on losing, lest he’s finally lost,\n\nand calls the dice back endlessly into his eager hand.\n\nThis is the work, the labour, to have her without giving first:\n\nand she’ll go on giving, lest she lose what she’s freely given.\n\nSo go on, and send your letter’s flattering words,\n\ntry her intention, test the road out first.\n\nCydippe was deceived by the message the apple brought,\n\nand unaware the girl by her own words was caught.\n\nI warn you, youths of Rome, learn the noble arts,\n\nnot just to defend some trembling client:\n\nlike the crowd, the grave judge, the elected senate,\n\na woman will give her hand, won by eloquence.\n\nBut let your powers be hidden, don’t display your eloquence:\n\nlet irksome words vanish from your speech.\n\nWho, but a mindless fool, declaims to his sweet friend?\n\nA strong letter often causes her displeasure.\n\nLet your speech be credible, use ordinary words,\n\nflattering though, speak as if you were present.\n\nIf she won’t receive the letter, returns it un-read,\n\nstick to your plan, and hope she’ll read it later.\n\nIn time stubborn oxen come to the plough,\n\nin time the horse learns to suffer the bridle:\n\nconstant use wears away an iron ring,\n\nthe curved plough’s lost to the endless furrow.\n\nWhat’s harder than stone, softer than water?\n\nYet soft water carves the hardest stone.\n\nOnce steadfast you’ll conquer Penelope herself in time:\n\nyou’ll see Troy captive, though it’s captured late.\n\nShe reads and won’t reply? Don’t press her:\n\njust let her keep on reading your flattery.\n\nIf she wants to read, she’ll want to answer what she’s read:\n\nsuch things proceed by number and by measure.\n\nPerhaps at first a cool letter comes to you,\n\nasking: would you please not trouble her.\n\nWhat she asks, she fears: what she doesn’t ask, she wants,\n\nthat you go on: do it, and you’ll soon get what you wish.\n\nBook I Part XIII: Be Where She Is\n\nMeanwhile, if she’s being carried, reclining on her bed,\n\nsecretly approach your lady’s litter,\n\nand to avoid offering your words to odious ears,\n\nhide what you can with skill and ambiguous gestures.\n\nIf she’s wandering at leisure in the spacious Colonnade,\n\nyou join here there also, lingering, as a friend:\n\nnow make as if to lead the way, now drop behind,\n\nnow go on quickly, and now take it slow:\n\ndon’t be ashamed to slip amongst the columns,\n\na while, then move along side by side:\n\ndon’t let her sit all beautiful in the theatre row without you:\n\nwhat you’ll look at is the way she holds her arms.\n\nGaze at her, to admire her is fine:\n\nand to speak with gestures and with glances.\n\nAnd applaud, the man who dances the girl’s part:\n\nand favour anyone who plays a lover.\n\nWhen she rises, rise: while she’s sitting, sit:\n\npass the time at your lady’s whim.\n\nBook I Part XIV: Look Presentable\n\nDon’t delight in curling your hair with tongs,\n\ndon’t smooth your legs with sharp pumice stone.\n\nLeave that to those who celebrate Cybele the Mother,\n\nhowling wildly in the Phrygian manner.\n\nMale beauty’s better for neglect: Theseus\n\ncarried off Ariadne, without a single pin in his hair.\n\nPhaedra loved Hippolytus: he was unsophisticated:\n\nAdonis was dear to the goddess, and fit for the woods.\n\nNeatness pleases, a body tanned from exercise:\n\na well fitting and spotless toga’s good:\n\nno stiff shoe-thongs, your buckles free of rust,\n\nno sloppy feet for you, swimming in loose hide:\n\ndon’t mar your neat hair with an evil haircut:\n\nlet an expert hand trim your head and beard.\n\nAnd no long nails, and make sure they’re dirt-free:\n\nand no hairs please, sprouting from your nostrils.\n\nNo bad breath exhaled from unwholesome mouth:\n\ndon’t offend the nose like a herdsman or his flock.\n\nLeave the rest for impudent women to do,\n\nor whoever’s the sort of man who needs a man.\n\nBook I Part XV: At Dinner Be Bold\n\nAh, Bacchus calls to his poet: he helps lovers too,\n\nand supports the fire with which he is inflamed.\n\nThe frantic Cretan girl wandered the unknown sands,\n\nthat the waters of tiny sea-borne Dia showed.\n\nJust as she was, from sleep, veiled by her loose robe,\n\nbarefoot, with her yellow hair unbound,\n\nshe called, for cruel Theseus, to the unhearing waves,\n\nher gentle cheeks wet with tears of shame.\n\nShe called, and wept as well, but both became her,\n\nshe was made no less beautiful by her tears.\n\nNow striking her sweet breast with her hands, again and again,\n\nshe cried: ‘That faithless man’s gone: what of me, now?\n\nWhat will happen to me?’ she cried: and the whole shore\n\nechoed to the sound of cymbals and frenzied drums.\n\nShe fainted in terror, her next words were stifled:\n\nno sign of blood in her almost lifeless body.\n\nBehold! The Bacchantes with loose streaming hair:\n\nBehold! The wanton Satyrs, a crowd before the god:\n\nBehold! Old Silenus, barely astride his swaybacked mule,\n\nclutching tightly to its mane in front.\n\nWhile he pursues the Bacchae, the Bacchae flee and return,\n\nas the rascal urges the mount on with his staff.\n\nHe slips from his long-eared mule and falls headfirst:\n\nthe Satyrs cry: ‘Rise again, father, rise,’\n\nNow the God in his chariot, wreathed with vines,\n\ncurbing his team of tigers, with golden reins:\n\nthe girl’s voice and colour and Theseus all lost:\n\nthree times she tried to run, three times fear held her back.\n\nShe shook, like a slender stalk of wheat stirred by the wind,\n\nand trembled like a light reed in a marshy pool.\n\nTo whom the god said: ‘See, I come, more faithful in love:\n\nhave no fear: Cretan, you’ll be bride to Bacchus.\n\nTake the heavens for dowry: be seen as heavenly stars:\n\nand guide the anxious sailor often to your Cretan Crown.’\n\nHe spoke, and leapt from the chariot, lest she feared\n\nhis tigers: the sand yielded under his feet:\n\nclasped in his arms (she had no power to struggle),\n\nhe carried her away: all’s easily possible to a god.\n\nSome sing ‘O Hymenaeus’, some ‘Bacchus, euhoe!’\n\nSo on the sacred bed the god and his bride meet.\n\nWhen Bacchus’s gifts are set before you then,\n\nand you find a girl sharing your couch,\n\npray to the father of feasts and nocturnal rites\n\nto command the wine to bring your head no harm.\n\nIt’s alright here to speak many secret things,\n\nwith hidden words she’ll feel were spoken for her alone:\n\nand write sweet nothings in the film of wine,\n\nso your girl can read them herself on the table:\n\nand gaze in her eyes with eyes confessing fire:\n\nyou should often have silent words and speaking face.\n\nBe the first to snatch the cup that touched her lips,\n\nand where she drank from, that is where you drink:\n\nand whatever food her fingers touch, take that,\n\nand as you take it, touch hers with your hand.\n\nLet it be your wish besides to please the girl’s husband:\n\nit’ll be more useful to you to make friends.\n\nIf you cast lots for drinking, give him the better draw:\n\ngive him the garland you were crowned with.\n\nThough he’s below you or beside you, let him always be served first:\n\ndon’t hesitate to second whatever he says.\n\nIt’s a safe well-trodden path to deceive in a friend’s name,\n\nthough it’s a safe well-trodden path, it’s a crime.\n\nThat way the procurer procures far too much,\n\nand reckons to see to more than he was charged with.\n\nYou’ll be given sure limits for drinking by me:\n\nso pay attention to your mind and feet.\n\nMost of all beware of starting a drunken squabble,\n\nand fists far too ready for a rough fight.\n\nEurytion the Centaur died, made foolish by the wine:\n\nfood and drink are fitter for sweet jests.\n\nIf you’ve a voice, sing: if your limbs are supple, dance:\n\nand please, with whatever you do that’s pleasing.\n\nAnd though drunkenness is harmful, it’s useful to pretend:\n\nmake your sly tongue stammer with lisping sounds,\n\nthen, whatever you say or do that seems too forward,\n\nit will be thought excessive wine’s to blame.\n\nAnd speak well of your lady, speak well of the one she sleeps with:\n\nbut silently in your thoughts wish the man ill.\n\nThen when the table’s cleared, the guests are free,\n\nthe throng will give you access to her and room.\n\nJoin the crowd, and softly approach her,\n\nlet fingers brush her thigh, and foot touch foot.\n\nNow’s the time to speak to her: boorish modesty\n\nfly far from here: Chance and Venus help the daring.\n\nNot from my rules your eloquence will come:\n\ndesire her enough, you’ll be fluent yourself.\n\nYour’s to play the lover, imitate wounds with words:\n\nuse whatever skill you have to win her belief.\n\nDon’t think it’s hard: each think’s herself desired:\n\nthe very worst take’s pleasure in her looks.\n\nYet often the imitator begins to love in truth,\n\noften, what was once imagined comes to be.\n\nO, be kinder to the ones who feign it, girls:\n\ntrue love will come, out of what was false.\n\nNow secretly surprise her mind with flatteries,\n\nas clear water undermines the hanging bank.\n\nNever weary of praising her face, her hair,\n\nher elegant fingers, and her slender feet.\n\nEven the chaste like their beauty to be commended:\n\nher form to even the virgin’s pleasing and dear.\n\nWhy is losing the contest in the Phrygian woods\n\na cause of shame to Juno and Pallas still?\n\nJuno’s peacock shows his much-praised plumage:\n\nif you watch in silence, he’ll hide his wealth again.\n\nRace-horses between races on the testing course,\n\nlove it when necks are patted, manes are combed.\n\nBook I Part XVI: Promise and Deceive\n\nDon’t be shy of promising: promises entice girls:\n\nadd any gods you like as witness to what you swear.\n\nJupiter on high laughs at lovers’ perjuries,\n\nand orders Aeolus’s winds to carry them into the void.\n\nJupiter used to swear by the Styx, falsely, to Juno:\n\nnow he looks favourably on his own example.\n\nGods are useful: as they’re useful, let’s think they’re there:\n\ntake wine and incense to the ancient altars:\n\nindifferent calm and it’s like, apathy, don’t chain them:\n\nlive innocently: the divine is close at hand:\n\npay what you owe, hold dutifully to agreements:\n\ncommit no fraud: let your hands be free from blood.\n\nDelude only women, if you’re wise, with impunity:\n\nwhere truth’s more to be guarded against than fraud.\n\nDeceive deceivers: for the most part an impious tribe:\n\nlet them fall themselves into the traps they’ve set.\n\nThey say in Egypt the life-giving waters failed\n\nin the fields: and there were nine years of drought,\n\nthen Thrasius came to Busiris, and said that Jove\n\nmight be propitiated by shedding a stranger’s blood.\n\nBusiris told him: ‘You become Jove’s first victim,\n\nand you be the stranger to give Egypt water.’\n\nAnd Phalaris roasted impetuous Perillus’s body\n\nin the brazen bull: the unhappy creator was first to fill his work.\n\nBoth cases were just: for there’s no fairer law\n\nthan that the murderous maker should perish by his art.\n\nAs liars by liars are rightfully deceived,\n\nwounded by their own example, let women grieve.\n\nBook I Part XVII: Tears, Kisses, and Take the Lead\n\nAnd tears help: tears will move a stone:\n\nlet her see your damp cheeks if you can.\n\nIf tears (they don’t always come at the right time)\n\nfail you, touch your eyes with a wet hand.\n\nWhat wise man doesn’t mingle tears with kisses?\n\nThough she might not give, take what isn’t given.\n\nPerhaps she’ll struggle, and then say ‘you’re wicked’:\n\nstruggling she still wants, herself, to be conquered.\n\nOnly, take care her lips aren’t bruised by snatching,\n\nand that she can’t complain that you were harsh.\n\nWho takes a kiss, and doesn’t take the rest,\n\ndeserves to lose all that were granted too.\n\nHow much short of your wish are you after that kiss?\n\nAh me, that was boorishness stopped you not modesty.\n\nThough you call it force: it’s force that pleases girls: what delights\n\nis often to have given what they wanted, against their will.\n\nShe who is taken in love’s sudden onslaught\n\nis pleased, and finds wickedness is a tribute.\n\nAnd she who might have been forced, and escapes unscathed,\n\nwill be saddened, though her face pretends delight.\n\nPhoebe was taken by force: force was offered her sister:\n\nand both, when raped, were pleased with those who raped them.\n\nThough the tale’s known, it’s still worth repeating,\n\nhow the girl of Scyros mated Achilles the hero.\n\nNow the lovely goddess had given her fatal bribe\n\nto defeat the other two beneath Ida’s slopes:\n\nnow a daughter-in-law had come to Priam\n\nfrom an enemy land: a Greek wife in Trojan walls:\n\nall swore the prescribed oath to the injured husband:\n\nnow one man’s grief became a nation’s cause.\n\nShamefully, though he gave way to a mother’s prayer,\n\nAchilles hid his manhood in women’s clothes.\n\nWhat’s this, Aeacides? Spinning’s not your work:\n\nyour search for fame’s through Pallas’s other arts.\n\nWhy the basket? Your arm’s meant to bear a shield:\n\nwhy does the hand that will slay Hector hold the yarn?\n\nThrow away the spindle wound laboriously with thread!\n\nThe spear from Pelion’s to be brandished by this hand.\n\nBy chance a royal virgin shared the room:\n\nthrough her rape she learned he was a man.\n\nThat she was truly won by force, we must think:\n\nbut she still wanted to be won by force.\n\nShe often cried: ‘Stop!’ afterwards, when Achilles hurried on:\n\nnow he’d taken up stronger weapons than the distaff.\n\nWhere’s that force now? Why do you restrain\n\nthe perpetrator of your rape, Deidamia?\n\nNo doubt as there’s a sort of shame in having started first,\n\nso it’s pleasant to have what someone else has started.\n\nAh! The youth has too much faith in his own beauty,\n\nif he waits until she asks him first.\n\nThe man must approach first: speak the words of entreaty:\n\nshe courteously receives his flattering prayers.\n\nTo win her, ask her: she only wants to be asked:\n\ngive her the cause and the beginning of your longing.\n\nJupiter went as a suppliant to the heroines of old:\n\nno woman ever seduced great Jupiter.\n\nIf you find she disdains the advent of your prayerful sighs,\n\nleave off what you’ve begun, retrace your steps.\n\nWhat shuns them, they desire the more: they hate what’s there:\n\nremove her loathing by pursuing less.\n\nThe hoped-for love should not always be declared:\n\nintroduce desire hidden in the name of friendship.\n\nI’ve seen the most severe of women fooled this way:\n\nhe who once was a worshipper, became a lover.\n\nBook I Part XVIII: Be Pale: Be Wary of Your Friends\n\nA pale colour would shame a sailor on the ocean wave,\n\nwho’s blackened by the rays of the sun:\n\nand shame the farmer who turns the soil with curved plough\n\nand heavy harrow, underneath the heavens.\n\nAnd you who seek the athlete’s crown, you too\n\nwould be ashamed if all your body was white.\n\nLet all lovers be pale: it’s the colour fitting for love:\n\nit suits, though fools have thought it of no value.\n\nOrion wandered pale, for Side, in the woods,\n\nDaphnis was pale for his reluctant Naiad.\n\nLet your leanness show your heart: don’t think it a shame\n\nto slip a cape over your shining hair:\n\nLet youthful limbs be worn away by sleepless nights\n\nand care, and the grief of a great love.\n\nTo gain your desire, be miserable,\n\nand those who see you can say ‘You’re in love.’\n\nShould I lament, warn you perhaps that right and wrong\n\nare confused by all? Friendship and loyalty empty words.\n\nAh me, it’s not safe to praise your love to a friend:\n\nif he believes your praise, he’ll steal her himself.\n\nBut Patroclus never disgraced Achilles’s bed:\n\nand how modest Phaedra was with Pirithous.\n\nPylades loved Hermione, just as Phoebus Pallas,\n\nor as Castor was twin to you Pollux.\n\nWho hopes for that, hopes for apple-bearing tamarisks,\n\nand looks for honey in the middle of the stream.\n\nAll delight in what’s shameful: care only for their pleasures,\n\nand are pleased too when trouble comes to others.\n\nAh it’s a crime! It’s not their rivals that lovers fear:\n\nflee those you think are friends, and you’ll be safe.\n\nBeware of brothers, relatives, and dear friends:\n\nthat crowd offers you true cause for fear.\n\nBook I Part XIX: Be Flexible\n\nI’ve done, but there’s diversity in women’s\n\nhearts: a thousand minds require a thousand methods.\n\nOne soil doesn’t bear all crops: vines here\n\nare good, olives there: this teems with healthy wheat.\n\nThere are as many manners of heart as kinds of face:\n\na wise man will adapt to many forms,\n\nand like Proteus now, melt into the smooth waters,\n\nnow be a tree, now a lion, now a bristling boar.\n\nThese fish are speared, those caught on a hook:\n\nothers trawled in billowing nets with straining ropes.\n\nOne mode won’t suit you for every age-group:\n\nthe older hinds spot a trap from further off.\n\nIf the simple find you cunning, and the modest crude,\n\nthe poor things will straightaway mistrust themselves.\n\nSo it happens that she who fears to trust an honest man,\n\nfalls to the embrace of some low rascal.\n\nPart of my task is left: part of the labour’s done.\n\nMoor my boat here to the anchor-chains."
