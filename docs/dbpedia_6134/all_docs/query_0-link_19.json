It is designed to assess the health concerns of minority populations in Illinois and to assist in the creation and maintenance of culturally sensitive programs. To achieve this goal the Center works within the Department of Public Health and with other relevant state and local entities to heighten awareness of minority health issues and services across the state.\n\nMission: To improve the health and well being of Illinois’ racial and ethnic minority populations through the development of health policies and culturally linguistically appropriate programs that will eliminate health disparities.\n\nThe Illinois Department of Public Health Center for Minority Health Services offers the use of its Wellness on Wheels (WOW) Mobile Units to organizations and local health departments wanting to take health clinic services into a community. WOW units can be requested for use providing immunizations, various health screenings, HIV and STD testing, and other services.

Each year more than 1.5 million Americans suffer from heart attack and stroke, and more than 80,000 of them die. Heart disease or stroke is responsible for 1 in every 3 deaths in Illinois. Heart disease is also a leading contributor of racial disparities in life expectancies.\n\nThe Love to Love Your Heart is an initiative of the Illinois Department of Public Health, Center for Minority Health Services in partnership with faith-based communities. The goal of the Love to Love Your Heart initiative is to prevent heart attacks and stroke through education; awareness trainings regarding cardiovascular risk factors including focus on high blood pressure; and promotion of nutrition and healthy activities to support heart health.\n\nIs your faith-based community interested in learning more or ready to get started?\n\nEmail DPH.cmhs.info@illinois.gov.\n\nIllinois Department of Public Health, Center for Minority Health Services\n\nProgram Flyer\n\nQuick Facts Sheet\n\nGet Application Form\n\nAll Illinoisans deserve to live long, healthy lives, free of modifiable differences in health status and outcomes.\n\nHealth inequities affect everyone. Disparities in health status exist between many population groups, with the greatest disparities found between people of different racial or ethnic groups, and between people of different socioeconomic statuses. Significant racial/ethnic and income disparities are observed when examining the rates of illnesses and conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, depression, lung and breast cancer, and infant mortality. Interventions to reduce health inequities can improve the health of all communities.\n\nThe mission of IDPH’s Health Equity Council (HEC) is to support a work culture within the Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) that promotes health equity and works to eliminate health disparities through increased coordination with leadership, programs, and strategic partnerships.\n\nThe HEC is comprised of volunteer members from across IDPH who have an interest in advancing health equity. Members assist by providing ongoing support and technical assistance in order to increase the cultural competence of IDPH staff and programs with the goal of reducing health disparities across Illinois."
