Tim Urban is a blogger with a famous TED talk on procrastination. He has a brisk and amusing writing style and uses many cartoons and diagrams. After reading this, we wanted to buy a dozen copies and give them to our family and friends. Unfortunately, it is only an E-Book. The plus side is that your purchase of the E-Book goes directly to the author, and enables him to keep writing interesting and useful books. Available on Kindle or online at WaitButWhy.com.\n\nBook of the Month Archive"
