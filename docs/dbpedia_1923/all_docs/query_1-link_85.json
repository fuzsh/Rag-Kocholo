Fifty years is but a brief and fleeting span. Yet it seems long when one considers not so much the years which have vanished, but rather the complex work and intricate perplexities encountered. As I review these years a panorama unfolds, in the enactment of which many persons had a part. Those who supported and co-operated with me, and likewise those who opposed me were actors in the drama of my career—some prominent and some minor. However, the principal figure in one’s life is himself. For the friends and colleagues who volunteered their loyalty and encouragement, and for those fellow-citizens with most of whom I had not even the pleasure of being acquainted, who accorded me their good will and approbation, I have a deep sense of appreciation. Envisaging the half century, I see the simple mode of living developed into the complex. The evolution of the kerosene lamp to the great variety of conveniences provided by electricity and gas. The telephone, the wireless, the radio, the motion and talking pictures, the self-propelled motor vehicles, the air-ships, refrig­ eration, and innumerable other facilities of the present day form a striking contrast with the accommodations of my boyhood and youth. I behold the progress from the horse-car to the trol­ ley-car and motorbus, and the transformation of in­ dustry and trade from a primitive status to large scale production and mass marketing by mechanization and systemization. I visualize the advancement of St. Louis to the me­ tropolis it is today, and I rejoice in the contemplation that my career embraced practically the entire period of this transition. This Autumn of mine is a fair and golden season to me, in which there is no regret, no animosity, and I like, above all, to remember the sincerity and fidelity of my friends, and the civic pride of the people of St. Louis. This narration is not an official record or history, but simply a recital of some of the episodes of my life for members of my family and my associates. R. W . S eptem ber, 1933.

R o o s e v e lt 496 I E rastus W ells Erastus Wells, was born in Sackett’s Harbor, Jefferson County, New York, December 2, 1823. He was the only son of Otis Wells, a descendant of the Wells family of Con­ necticut. His paternal grandmother was Ethelinda Otis, a descendant of the Otis family of Massachusetts. From his twelfth to his sixteenth year he lived on a farm and during the winter months attended a dis­ trict school. It was a log school house and it was necessary for him to go through the deep snow of those Northern winters to reach it. At the age of sixteen, he left the farm to seek his fortune in the world. He proceeded to Watertown, New York, where he obtained employment in a grocery store at a salary of eight dollars a month. He remained there but a short time, going in 1839 to Lockport, New York, and engaged as a clerk for a firm in which ex-Govemor Washington Hunt was a partner. His salary ranged from eight to twelve dollars a month. At the end of three or four years he had laid up the sum of one hundred and forty dollars, in those days almost a for­ tune to a young man who had earned it by hard work and close economy. With this sum in his pocket he turned his face toy fa th e r , M 9 E piso d es o f M y L if e wards the West, and decided to go to St. Louis, then one of the most enterprising points of the Western frontier. On the journey he passed through the city of New York, and the omnibuses which were operated on Broadway interested him. He arrived in St. Louis in September, 1843. His mother had given him a let­ ter of introduction to Mr. Calvin Case, a prominent resident of St. Louis. He looked around for several days, having in mind some occupation in which to engage, and then presented his letter to Mr. Case, who received him most cordially and inquired how long he had been in the town, and whether or not he had deter­ mined what he would like to do. My father replied that in passing through New York City he was im­ pressed with the busses in use in that city, and he had observed that in St. Louis apparently there were no public transportation facilities. Mr. Case was inter­ ested and thought it was an idea worth considering, and it ultimately resulted in a partnership between Mr. Case and my father, in the inauguration and oper­ ation of the first public transportation enterprise in St. Louis—namely, a bus line. In the course of time this enterprise developed into a large transportation system, covering many parts of the city. In 1859 my father obtained a charter for the first horse-car line operated west of the Mississippi River, which was called the Missouri Railroad Com­ pany, of. which he was the president, and on July 4, 1859, the first car was operated for a short distance west on Olive Street. For a period of fifteen years he was a member of E rastus W ells 3 the Board of Aldermen; first elected to this body in 1848, and re-elected in 1854, and was a member until March 1, 1869, when he resigned to take his seat in Congress, March 4, 1869. During the twenty-three years of his service in public office he advocated such measures as were best calculated to advance the growth of the city and to add to the prosperity of its citizens, permitting no party partisanship to influence him. It was while he was a member of the Board of Alder­ men, as Chairman of the Committee on Water-Works, he urged the building of new water-works, which should be on a scale commensurate with the needs of the city for some years to come. He was appointed on a special committee to visit the principal cities in the East to examine the system of water-works in each city, and was the only member of the committee who performed this duty. He visited New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, Cincin­ nati, Louisville and Cleveland, and was given every opportunity to make an inspection of the water supply in use in each city. Upon his return he made a report and mainly through his efforts an act was passed by the Legislature authorizing the City of St. Louis to issue bonds to the extent of $3,000,000 to commence the construction of what led to the then considered imposing water-works. He realized the inadequacy of the police system of St. Louis, and when on his investigation relating to the water supply he also informed himself of the dif­ ferent police systems of the several cities which he visited. He learned from the mayors of New York, 4 E piso d e s of M y L ife Boston and Philadelphia, that in their opinion Balti­ more had the best police system. At that time com­ plaints came from almost every city of any size, chiefly the Eastern cities, of the difficulties in their police regulations. Baltimore, especially, had passed into the hands of a desperate class of men known as the “ plug uglies,” a kind of city rowdy, ruffian or disorderly tough, a term said to have originated by a gang of such in Baltimore, against whom the police authorities were powerless, and this unruly turbulent element was not placed under control until the Legislature of Mary­ land had passed what was known as a metropolitan police bill. He brought home with him a copy of this bill, and after changing it to meet the laws of Missouri, and to comply with the City Charter, he secured the consent of Francis Whittaker, Henry Keyser, George K. Budd and Bernard Pratt to put their names to the Act, they to serve as the first Board of Police Commissioners of this city. After a struggle in the Board of Aldermen, a resolution was passed recommending its passage by the State Legislature. He visited Jefferson City and laid the resolution, with the bill, before the Legislature during the session of 1860-1861. Claibom Jackson was Governor of the State at the time, and there was a good deal of politi­ cal unrest. The party in power insisted upon eliminat­ ing the names of the commissioners set out in the bill, leaving it with the Governor to make the appoint­ ments. The friends of the bill were successful in secur­ ing its passage and the Governor signed it. Its pro- E ra stuff Wells and Isabella Bowman Henry Wells Reproduced from a daguerreotype o f 1850, the yea r o f their marriage E rastus W ells 5 visions were at once carried into effect and a new era of a metropolitan police system for St. Louis was in­ augurated. At the close of his career as Alderman, by unani­ mous vote of the Board of Aldermen, his portrait was hung, with due ceremony, on the walls of the chamber. In 1850 he was united in marriage to Isabella Bow­ man Henry, daughter of Captain John Heniy, of Jack­ sonville, Illinois. His Congressional career began in 1869, and he served as a member of the House of Representatives for eight years, during the incumbency of President U. S. Grant. At the election of November 3, 1874, he was re-elected for a fourth term by a majority of nearly three to one. In politics he was a Democrat, but was popular with all parties. He received many votes from those politi­ cally opposed to him. Through his effort Congress ap­ propriated the sum of $4,000,000 for the building of the St. Louis Post Office and Custom House, now lo­ cated on Olive and Locust Streets between Eighth and Ninth Streets. He was helpful in obtaining appropriations for the improvement of the Mississippi River, and was asso­ ciated with Captain James B. Eads, in the matter of legislation relating to the promotion of the Eads Jetties. At the last session of the 43rd Congress he intro­ duced the bill which led to the conversion of the Indian Territory into what is now known as the State of Oklahoma. 6 E piso d e s o f M y L if e During his later years, owing to ill health, he retired, and I am proud to say his confidence in me was such that he put all of his affairs in my charge, and our association as father and son has been a life-long in­ spiration to me. My mother, Isabella Bowman Henry, was born at Jacksonville, Illinois. She died in 1877. I owe much to her loving care and guidance. II J ohn H enry in my possession an autobiography written in 1881 by my maternal grandfather Captain John Henry. It is a record of an active and interesting career in private and public life, in the early days of Lexington, Kentucky, and Jacksonville, Illinois. Captain Henry was born in Lincoln County, Ken­ tucky, November 1, 1800. His father was bom in Virginia, on the 5th day of July, 1776, the day when the victory of American Independence was proclaimed. In 1789 his father and grandfather emigrated from Virginia to Kentucky, when that state was a vast wilderness and subject to Indian depredations. His grandfather, Watson Henry, located at Logan's Fort, near Stanford, now in Lincoln County. His maternal grandfather, David Potts, located at Harbesen Fort, near Perryville, in Boyle County. When he was eighteen years of age, as was the custom of the time, he was apprenticed to Robert Wilson, a cabinet-maker, living in Lexington, Ken­ tucky, for a term of three years. At the end of his apprenticeship he married the oldest daughter of Mr. Wilson, Isabella Wilson, April 5, 1821, started a business of the same character for himself, and remained in Lexington until 1828. I have 8 E piso d e s of M y L if e In his autobiography he tells of his desire to emi­ grate to some new country where it would not be neces­ sary to have a large amount of money to begin busi­ ness. He and his wife decided to move to Illinois, with their three children, Margaret, Mary and Rob­ ert. After a journey of three weeks, with a fourhorse team, they arrived at Jacksonville, Illinois, on the 13th day of October, 1828. He brought with him a thoroughbred stallion, the first thoroughbred horse in Morgan County. This stallion was named “ Selim,” after the great charger which General McDougall rode in the Revolutionary War. My grandfather thought a great deal of this animal, and expressed the opin­ ion that he deserved a place in the history of Morgan County. They rented a cabin in what was called Mitchell’s Row. All of the cabins in the row were built of round logs. They paid $1.50 a month rent and lived there for one year. He then purchased a farm in the neigh­ borhood of Jacksonville and at the same time set up a cabinet shop in the village. He tells of the difficulty he had procuring the kind of wood necessary for his work, and of hiring an ox wagon and team to go to St. Louis, a distance of one hundred miles, for a load of wood, which he hauled to Jacksonville. He had an opportunity to purchase a large log house which had been built on government land by a man named Cox, who sold it for twenty dollars. It was moved to an­ other location and made a very commodious shop, which was the first regular cabinet shop in Morgan County. It was the second best house in the village. Jo h n H e n r y 9 The first Board of Trustees of Jacksonville held their meetings at night in the cabinet shop. There were five members—James Parkinson, George Hackett, Mr. Henry, and two others whose names are for­ gotten. The shop was utilized as a meeting place for a com­ mittee of Jacksonville citizens who were planning for a celebration of the Fourth of July, 1829, “in honor o f American Independence.” The committee consisted 01 John Eads (uncle of James B. Eads, the builder of the Eads Bridge and the New Orleans jetties), Abraham DeWitt, John P. Wilkinson, Joseph Fairfield and Mr. Henry. A County Convention met in the shop in the year 1832, to nominate delegates to attend the State Con­ vention in Springfield, Illinois, to select a candidate for the Democratic ticket. The delegates chosen were Joseph Morton, Mathew Stacy, John Wyatt and Mr. Henry. The delegates were instructed for General Andrew Jackson. Early in life my grandfather took an active inter­ est in the political questions of the day. He was a Clay Whig, and in 1824 cast his first vote for Henry Clay for President, who was defeated by John Quincy Adams. In 1826 the Legislature of Kentucky instructed Mr. Clay to vote for General Jackson in opposition to John Quincy Adams. Clay cast his vote for Adams, which caused a split in the Whig party, Mr. Henry go­ ing with the Jackson wing and continuing with it until 1835. In 1832 Mr. Henry was elected to the lower house 10 E p iso d e s o f M y L if e of the General Assembly of Illinois, where he re­ mained until 1840. He was then elected to the State Senate, serving as State Senator until 1847, at which time he was elected a member of the United States House of Representatives. His first difference with the Jackson party arose in 1832, upon the question of introducing into Western politics the New York system of conventions. Dur­ ing the session of the Legislature in 1832 a meeting of the members of the Democratic party was called at Vandalia, to consider the advisability of adopting the convention system. This was the first meeting of the kind held in the West. The project was con­ sidered and the system adopted. Mr. Henry, the youngest member of the Lower House, opposed the measure, introducing a resolution denouncing it as anti-republican, and antagonistic and dangerous to our republican form of government. This resolution caused Mr. Henry to be read out of the old Jackson party. In 1836 the Honorable Hugh L. White of Tennessee was nominated to be President. Mr. Henry was one of Mr. White’s electors from Illinois. In 1840 General William H. Harrison was elected, Mr. Henry still clinging to the Whig party, in fact he was one of the last men in the State to leave it, and then joined with Stephen A. Douglas on the doctrine of non-inter­ vention and in favor of local self-government. As illustrative of the primitive social status of that period, Mr. Henry introduced into the Legislature a bill providing for the exemption from execution of Jo h n H e n r y 11 one horse worth sixty dollars and a mechanic’s tools worth the same amount; and, also that a woman at the head of a family could hold free from execution six sheep and their fleece. While in the Legislature he introduced a bill to in­ corporate the Female Academy at Jacksonville, which was the first incorporated institution of learning in the State. He was also prominent in the establish­ ment of other public and charitable institutions. He took a prominent part in the formative period of the inauguration of the public school system of Illinois. In 1832 he volunteered and raised a company for the Black Hawk war, and served under Governor John Reynolds and General Joseph Duncan, and was present at the treaty with the Indians at Fort Arm­ strong. In 1837 and 1838 the General Assembly of the State of Illinois passed a bill to construct over twelve hun­ dred miles of railroad, under the supervision and direc­ tion of agents appointed by the State. Commissioners were sent to Europe to procure a loan to carry on the work, and were successful. In the bill there was no preference given to any section of the State as to where the railroads would be built. Then the trouble began. All sections claimed that the road must be built in their vicinity, and in less than eighteen months the w'hole scheme exploded with a considerable loss to the State. On the 27th day of February, 1841, a bill passed the General Assembly of Illinois to finish the Northern Cross Railroad from Jacksonville to Springfield, Illi­ nois, and made an appropriation of $120,000 to com­ 12 E p iso d e s o f M y L if e plete the work under the supervision of John D. White­ side, Fund Commissioner of Illinois. On the 5th day of March, 1841, Mr. Whiteside appointed Mr. Henry and Edward D. Taylor joint agents to complete the road. The work was accomplished in five months. The railroad was built on wooden stringers and flat iron rails. Mr. Henry superintended the operation of the road for one year, assisted by George Gregory, locomo­ tive engineer, and a man named E. Miodzianowski, an exiled Polander, acting as civil engineer. They, had great difficulty in operating this road, as the spikes which held the flat iron rails on the wooden stringers were constantly getting loose, to the danger of lives and the destruction of the equipment. Finally, Mr. Henry was compelled to dispense with the engine and use mules for the motive power. Captain Henry was a man of keen and intelligent mind. His autobiography is a document of real human interest, and tells of many of the early settlers, who, together with himself, had taken an active part in the affairs of the country. Among the many personal and intimate friends with whom he was associated, were: Mr. Stephen A. Douglas, Governor John Reynolds, General Joseph Duncan, Governor Richard Yates, Colonel E. D. Baker, Colonel John J. Hardin, Colonel James Dunlap, Judge William Thomas and Mr. Jacob Strawn. He died April 28, 1882, at the age of eighty-two years. I was present at his deathbed, and an incident relating thereto made a lifelong impression on my memory. Near the end, Reverend Robert G. Brank, Jo h n H e n r y 13 the stately and kindly pastor of the Central Presby­ terian Church, entered the room with a prayer book in his hand. He approached the bedside, and my grand­ father, aroused, was incredibly able to exclaim, ad­ dressing Dr. Brank: “ I want you to understand, sir, this is not a death­ bed confession,” which was an unforgettable expres­ sion of his character and life. In a few moments he passed away. Ill E arliest R ecollections date of my birth was June 1, 1856. The place, St. Louis, Missouri, on the south side of Olive Street, midway between Fifteenth and Sixteenth Streets, at that time considered in the suburbs. My earliest recollection was the battle of Camp Jackson, during the Civil war. The occasion which impressed this on my child-mind, being only five years of age, was, being seated in a one-horse surrey, next to my grandfather, Captain John Henry, who was visiting in St. Louis at the time. He and I were occupying the front seat, he driving; my mother and Mrs. M. M. Hodgman, an out-of-town friend, were on the rear seat. We drove out Olive Street, stopping on a vacant lot on the southeast comer of Garrison Avenue and Olive Street, looking west to what is now Compton and Theresa Avenues. We heard firing and saw the smoke arising, as the result of a skirmish which was styled “ The Battle of Camp Jackson. I remember seeing the soldiers marching east on Olive Street, past the lot on which we were standing. This childhood impression was confirmed in later years by my grandfather. he E arliest R ecollections 15 I remember being taken to the Sanitary Benefit Fair which was held on Twelfth Street, north of Olive Street, during the Civil war, where I saw Nellie Grant, daughter of General U. S. Grant, who was impersonat­ ing the old woman who lived in a shoe, surrounded by numerous dolls. I remember the Federal troops escorting in military form the ragged and forlorn Confederate soldiers, prisoners of war, to the Gratiot Street prison, formerly the McDowall Medical College. One day, while playing in the stable at the rear of my home, I found a ten dollar Confederate bill. Be­ lieving that it had value, much elated, I showed it to my father. The next day he took me to the Accommo­ dation Bank, of which he was the president, located on Chestnut Street, between Third and Fourth Streets. Father having covertly guaranteed the deposit, I was told to hand in the bill, for which I was given a pass book showing a credit of ten dollars; also, a check book. This transaction was the incentive for me to learn to write, which I laboriously did, by writing checks for one dollar each until the credit was ex­ hausted. The proceeds of the first check for one dollar, as I remember, I spent for the purchase of a toy fiddle. IV A C ountry H ome I n 1868 my father purchased 66 acres of land in St. Louis County, fronting on the north side of St. Charles Rock Road and extending northwardly, and erected a three story brick house, which was used as our country home. What is now known as Kienlen Avenue was the driveway. This tract of land is now a part of Wellston, which was named for my father. A house in the country at that time, and for some years later, did not have the conveniences of the pres­ ent day. There were no electric lights, gas, telephone, or community water supply. The roads leading to and from the city were the St. Charles Rock Road (mac­ adam) and some parallel and intersecting dirt roads, a portion of which frequently crossed private property as a short cut-off. The only means of transportation being horseback and horse-drawn vehicles, it required the good part of a day for my mother to go in her carriage to the city and return for shopping or social functions. I remember a pair of young, jet-black stallions (Morgan stock) we owned at that time. One Sunday afternoon, during a summer vacation, I had one of the horses saddled, and rode him along the St. Charles Rock Road. He was full of spirit, prancing and jump­ ing, and held his head well in the air. A Co u n tr y H om e 17 Two men came along in a buggy. They stopped me, and one of them said: “ Hello, young fellow, what horse is that you are riding?\" In my elation, I quickly made up a name, and being somewhat of a little rebel, I replied, “ This stallion is the celebrated ‘Stonewall Jackson’.” They admired the animal and then drove on, evi­ dently keeping sight of me when I turned into our driveway towards home. That night two horses were stolen from our barn— “ Stonewall Jackson” and a buggy horse belonging to me. Father had posters placed at all the country cross­ road stores, offering a liberal reward for the return of the horses, but we never saw them again. That was my first lesson on undue pride. This country place was the source of much pleasure and recreation for my father. He enjoyed the products of the orchard, the vineyard, the melon patch and the garden. The Sunday afternoon visits from his many friends were especially enjoyable, sitting in the shade of the trees, talking and joking, and refreshed with ice cold mint juleps. Good neighbors were close by. A short distance to the northwest of us, in their country homes, lived the Clarks, the Glasgows, the 0 ’Fallons, the Turners, the Lucases, the Lindsays, the Hunts, the Hargadines, the Frosts, the Wickhams, the Hameys and others. A few years after the death of my father, in 1893, while the house was vacant, through some unknown cause, it caught fire and burned to the ground. The 18 E p iso d e s o f M y L if e property then was subdivided into building lots, and, as I before stated, is now a part of Wellston, named for my family. It seems to me almost incredible, that at this writing that section is now made up of inter­ secting, smoothly paved streets and alleys, and block after block of residences, stores and other structures. In the Fall of 1868 I was sent to the Vermont Epis­ copal Institute, a semi-military school, conducted under the auspices of the Episcopal church of Vermont. The school was located on what was known as Rock Point, a projection into Lake Champlain, at the outskirts of Burlington, Vermont. A number of my St. Louis boyhood companions also attended this school. As I now recall their names, they were Isaac H. Lionberger, Edward Dameron, Clarence O’Fallon, Willie Carter, H. S. McKellops, Jr., Allen H. Collins, H. H. Simons, G. W. Baker, J. B. Collins, James R. F. Duncan, C. J. McLaren, Edgar J. Valle and George Blackman. Being an Episcopal school, our Easter vacations were long, and I spent the time visiting my father and mother, who were living in Washington, D. C. Father frequently took me with him on the floor of the House of Representatives. At that time each mem­ ber had his individual desk, and I was allowed to sit by his side. This was an interesting experience, as it brought me in passing contact with many of the promi­ nent members of that period. Some of those I remem­ ber are, James G. Blaine, Speaker of the House; John A. Logan, Proctor Knott, John Morissey, Fernando A Co un tr y H om e 19 Wood, John A. Bingham, James A. Garfield, Benjamin F. Butler, Samuel S. Cox. When I finished at the Vermont Episcopal Institute I returned to St. Louis, and in the year 1871 entered Washington University, then located at Seventeenth Street and Washington Avenue. After leaving Wash­ ington University, I went to Princeton University. In 1915 I was complimented by having an honorary de­ gree conferred upon me by Washington University, and, in 1916, an honorary degree was conferred by Princeton University. V A M inister to L iberia early seventies, when my father, mother and sister, then an infant, were living in the old Wil­ lard Hotel, in Washington, D. C., my sister be­ came quite ill. One morning about five o’clock my father and mother imagined that the child was in a critical condition. Father, in great distress, rushed to the office of the hotel to get some one to go for the doctor, there were no telephones in that day. It hap­ pened that at this early hour no one was visible in the hotel office or the lobby. In desperation, father ran to the sidewalk at the Pennsylvania Avenue hotel entrance, looking around for some means of getting word to the doctor. Just then a negro who happened to be from St. Louis came sauntering along. He recognized father and surmised that something was wrong. Approaching, he said, “ Why, Mr. Wells, what is the matter? Is there anything I can do for you?” “ Yes, my daughter is ill and I am looking for some means to summon the doctor,” father replied. The negro inquired for the doctor’s address, and when told, he started on a run to get him. The doctor arrived in due time and all was well. This negro was Milton Turner, of St. Louis. I n th e A M in is t e r to L ib e r ia 21 A few days later, when father was entering the hotel, he noticed Turner standing on the sidewalk. He called him and expressed his thanks for the opportune service he had rendered in notifying the doctor. “ Turner, what are you doing in Washington?” Father asked. “ Mr. Wells, speaking frankly, I am walking the streets looking for the means for getting back home,” Turner replied. “ Well, Turner, what brought you here,” asked my father. “ Mr. Wells, I had an idea that I might get the ap­ pointment of Minister to Liberia, but I have abandoned hope and want to get back to St. Louis,” replied Turner. “ You stay around for a few days and I will see what can be done.” He gave Turner money to tide him over. Father and President Grant were quite friendly, having known each other in the early days when Grant was living in St. Louis. Father called upon the Presi­ dent at his office in the White House. “ Mr. President, what have you done about filling the vacancy in the office of Minister to Liberia?” The President replied that he was about to appoint Mr.—. “ Why don’t you appoint Milton Turner of St. Louis?” “ That would not do; Turner is a negro; it would be unprecedented to appoint a negro to a position of that character.” “ Why not? It’s only a matter of drawing the salary, and a negro can do that as well as a white man.” 22 E piso d e s o f M y L if e Whereupon father related the story of the supposedly dying infant daughter, the urgent need of a physician, and the sauntering negro on the sidewalk coming to his rescue by timely notice to the doctor. The story was told in such a way, that in the telling of it moisture appeared in the eyes of the President. He rang for his secretary, and instructed that a certifi­ cate of appointment as Minister to Liberia be made in the name of Milton Turner, of St. Louis, the first negro to receive an appointment of that character. Turner duly qualified and served his term with credit. Father did not dream that in reciprocating to Milton Turner for the timely service he had received he was “ casting bread upon the waters,” as the following nar­ rative will show. In my campaign for Mayor, in the Spring of 1901, over thirty years after Milton Turner’s appointment as related, it was my custom to attend such political meetings as were assigned to me. I was usually accom­ panied by friends who were expected to, and did, par­ ticipate in the gatherings. It was our rule when the itinerary for the evening was ended, to stop at the St. Louis Club, located on Lindell Boulevard, just west of Grand Avenue, for a sandwich and a bottle of beer or some other refreshment. One night, in getting out of our carriage (automo­ biles had not come into use), I was accosted by a politi­ cal ward worker, who informed me that there was being held, in an old warehouse on Olive Street and Cardinal Avenue, a large negro meeting, and he had been sent with the request that I attend the meeting. A M in is t e r to L ib e r ia 23 I demurred, declaring that I was tired and that I had filled the engagements assigned to me for that night. However, I was persuaded to go, on the ground that it was a meeting well attended and of political im­ portance. We re-entered the carriage and drove to the warehouse. On entering the poorly lighted and dilapidated meet­ ing place, I noticed it was crowded with negroes and that Milton Turner was on the platform, addressing the audience. He had become a lawyer and a fine ora­ tor, and was a leading negro citizen. I ascended the platform, Mr. Turner extending greetings. Then continuing his speech, he related the story pretty much as I have told it, of how, over thirty years ago, through Mr. Erastus Wells, father of the Democratic candidate for mayor, he had been honored with the appointment of Minister to Liberia. It is needless to say, that after such an introduction, I met with a vigorous reception, proving on election day, I believe, that “ casting bread upon the waters” was not in vain. VI B eg in n in g of B usiness L ife OR a number of years my uncle, Alfred W. Henry, had been my father’s principal assistant. He was superintendent of the Missouri Railroad Company, operating the Olive and Market street car lines. I was thrown with him a great deal, and he was good enough to call me his assistant, but my duties were in no manner arduous. He was one of the most popular men in the city. At the same time Mr. William D. Henry was the secretary and treasurer of the rail­ road company, and his son Frank R. Henry in later years became the auditor of the United Railway Com­ pany, a successor of the Missouri Railroad Company. After leaving the railroad business Mr. Frank Henry became vice-president, and later president of the Majestic Manufacturing Company. In 1878 Mr. Alfred W. Henry died. Father came from Washington to at­ tend the funeral. The burial was in Bellefontaine Cemetery on a Sunday afternoon. I shall always have a vivid memory of what hap­ pened the evening of that day. Father and I drove from the cemetery to our country home. After dinner we were sitting together. I noticed he was depressed. Suddenly he said to me: “ For a number of years I have been dependent upon the services of your uncle. B e g in n in g of B u s in e s s L if e 25 My legislative duties in Washington require my im­ mediate presence. I have no one at this time to take up his duties and responsibilities. I don’t know what I am going to do.” Then, abruptly, he asked me if I would undertake the management of the railway. As can be imagined, the question was unexpected. All I could think to say in reply was: “ If you have sufficient confidence to give me the trial, I will do the best I can.” He answered, “Very well, to-morrow morning you will come with me to the office and I will issue the order appointing you superintendent.” I spent a restless night thinking of the big responsi­ bility that would be mine, and in the morning I awoke with the determination that I would give all that was in me to make good. I was twenty-two years of age. The next morning we went to the office. The an­ nouncement was made that I had been appointed super­ intendent of the railroad. That night father left the city for Washington, and I then realized that I was confronted with a great responsibility. For years I had been known among the employees of the railroad as the son of the president, and there had been a boyhood and young manhood familiarity on my part and theirs. Some of them had been employees since my infancy. It took some time to impress upon them the change in our relationship; that I was in charge and that my orders must be respected. Early in my administration I saw the necessity for a change in the method of regulating the running order of cars and the time schedule. After considerable study I perfected a plan and gave 26 E p iso d es o f M y L if e orders to the foreman and the starting agent that the new schedule should be put in operation on the follow­ ing day. On the day the change was made I noticed that the operation of the cars was more or less demoralized. Calling the foreman and the starting agent before me, I inquired what was the difficulty. They informed me that the system I was attempting to introduce was not practicable. I informed them, thereupon, that in the morning they should again adopt the schedule, and if I found that under their charge it did not operate as I desired, it would be necessary for me to appoint a new foreman and a new starter. It is needless to say that the system from then on worked smoothly, and that this action on my part put a quietus on underhand opposition to my management, and put a stop to favor­ itism that had been exercised on the part of the fore­ man and the starting agent to the detriment of some of the operating employees. The operation of the line continued without inter­ ruption until April, 1881, when our conductors and drivers went out on a strike. They did this without warning and without request­ ing a conference in regard to any grievance they may have had. This, I felt was a great misfortune, as I am sure a satisfactory understanding could have been reached. At that period there were ten independent street car lines in the city: The Missouri Railroad, the Citi­ zens Railway, the Union Depot, the Northwestern, the Bellefontaine, the Lindell, the People’s, the St. Louis, B e g i n n i n g o f B u s i n e s s L if e 27 the Cass Avenue and Fair Grounds Railway, and the Compton Hill Railway. The conductors and drivers of all of these roads went out on a strike at the same time. After a few days of the non-operation of the street cars, threats were made by certain citizens that unless the car service was resumed, legal action would be taken to forfeit the charters of the companies. This caused uneasiness among the officers of the various roads. A conference was held and it was decided a trial run would be attempted in order to demonstrate our inability to operate, owing to lack of sufficient police protection. VII A S tranger W a n ts a J ob to mention the personal action that cir­ cumstances forced upon me relating to this run. However, inasmuch as there was at that time, and in later years, newspaper publicity regarding it, some of which was used against me when I was a candidate for Mayor in 1901, I feel that the incident should have a place in my story. At the conference it was decided that as the Olive Street line was located in the center of the city, and comparatively a short run, the trial should be made on that road. On the fixed day (which, of course, was to be kept secret in order not to incite undue attention) it was up to me, as superintendent of the road, to put this into effect. I planned to start a car from the Olive Street car sheds, which were located at Olive Street and Leonard Avenue, and run it to Fourth Street, the eastern ter­ minus, and return. The night before the trial run I went to our main office, located on Market Street, between Eighteenth and Nineteenth Streets, opposite where the Union Sta­ tion is now located. When I reached the office no one was there, the working force having finished for the I d is li k e A S t r a n g e r W a n t s a J ob 29 day. By use of a latch key I entered, turned on the gas light, and settled myself for the reading of a news­ paper. I had not been there long when there was a knock­ ing at the outer door. I went to the door, and, stand­ ing at the entrance was a rather nice looking fellow, about five feet eleven inches tall, of athletic build; I judged him to be about thirty years of age. There was nothing unusual in his appearance excepting a scar on one side of his face and he seemed to have consider­ able self-assurance. In the midst of the strike I was naturally under a mental strain and mistrustful of every stranger with whom I came in contact. “ What can I do for you?” I inquired of the caller. “ I want a job,” he replied. Under existing conditions this made me a little wary. “ Don’t you know that our men are on a strike—we have no jobs to offer?” I said. He answered that he was aware of the strike, never­ theless he wanted a job. There was something in his manner and voice that impressed me, and it occurred to me that at some time his services could be used. I asked him if he was ac­ quainted with anybody around the Olive Street car sheds, and he replied that he was not. Then I in­ structed him to go to the Olive Street car sheds the following morning. There he would find loitering on the sidewalk groups of employees. I advised him not to accost them, but to quietly loaf around until I put in an appearance. I had been assured by some of our employees that 30 E piso d es o f M y L if e they would resume work when requested. It was on this assurance the test run was to be made; otherwise I should not have undertaken it. The next morning, a short time before the hour fixed, I sent for the men who had declared they would resume work when asked. In the meantime the fore­ man had arranged for a team of horses to be in readi­ ness at the shed (the hostlers were not on strike). I met the men I had sent for at the entrance to the shed. “ I want two of you to take a car to Fourth Street and return,” I said. The men in the small group demurred, taking the position that, while they were willing to make good their word, not one would consent to man the first car to be run; if I could get the first car going, they would follow. Now, this placed me in an awkward position, as I had counted on some of them to do what they said they would do. The stranger I had encountered the night before was standing by and overheard the conversation. I called to him and led him into the car shed, filled with idle cars, and when we were out of sight and hearing, I said, “ You overheard the conversation on the side­ walk.” “ Yes,” he replied. “ Do you still want a job?” “ Yes,” he replied. “ Very well, I will give you a job. You are to drive a car to Fourth Street and return.” We started back to the entrance, and had not gone far when I stopped and asked him, “Did you ever drive a street car?” A S t r a n g e r W a n t s a J ob 31 “ No,” he replied. “ Do you know anything about handling a brake on a street car?” Again, he replied “ No.” Then I realized my predicament. I informed him, that owing to steep grades, it was necessary to have some knowledge how to manipulate the brakes, or dis­ aster would result, and I then determined to drive the car myself. I told him I had never driven a car, yet I had observed the operation for so long a time I felt I could manage. I asked him if he would act as conductor of the car. “ Yes,” he replied. At that period a brake handle was of malleable iron, of some weight. It fitted with a socket to an iron up­ right shaft. The handle extended horizontally ten to twelve inches and at its end bending upward for a few inches, had the form of a knob. I stepped on to the platform of a car near where we were and told him to follow. I pulled the brake handle from its socket and said to him, “ Do you see this? Here is a fine weapon handy if we are seriously attacked.” We went to the entrance. The horses were attached to a car, and then I addressed the men with whom I previously had been talking. “ Since you object to being the first to take out a car, I will take the first car myself, and I now call upon you to make good your word by following me with two additional cars.” I took up the reins, and away we started. 32 E piso d e s o p M y L if e The driving of the car was not easy, but I managed it. On the southeast corner of Garrison Avenue and Olive Street a building was being erected to be used as a livery stable. From that very spot twenty years before, my mother, grandfather and I witnessed the battle of Camp Jackson. It was the noon hour and a number of bricklayers and mechanics were on the sidewalk eating their lunch. They were in sympathy with the strikers. When the car approached, they stood up, and called us names, and raised a hubbub in general. I hurried past them and, reaching about one hundred feet beyond, looked back and saw my stranger companion with the malle­ able brake-handle in his hand, shaking it furiously toward the mechanics, and in a loud voice calling them names and daring them to “ come on.” I drove rapidly for some distance, then stopped the car and told him to come to the front. In an emphatic manner I informed him I had called his attention to the brake-handle as a weapon for protection only in case of grave emergency, and not as an instrument for inciting riot and inviting trouble. I calmed him and then proceeded on our journey. All along the street the operation of the car created much excitement. If a circus parade had been the spectacle I don’t believe the people would have sprung up more quickly. When we reached Sixth Street there was quite a crowd. Every window in the adjacent buildings was filled with onlookers, but no confetti was thrown in our honor. A S t r a n g e r W a n t s a J ob 33 At the corner of Sixth Street I saw my father. He had been waiting for the demonstration. When he recognized me, driving the car, he was nonplussed. He boarded the car and joined me on the front plat­ form. With difficulty we reached Fourth Street, and it was with great exertion that the three of us man­ aged to shift the horses to the other end of the car for the return trip. The crowd was unruly and most free with epithets. The police were of little service. I started the car on the return trip. At Sixth Street I saw the second car approaching. I hurriedly in­ formed my father the reason for the second car. He left me and boarded the approaching car. I afterward learned they had greater trouble in handling the sec­ ond car than we experienced with the first. At Twelfth Street we met the third car. Realizing that it would be almost impossible for it to go through, I ordered the driver to return to the shed on the same track. We completed the trial run as agreed, and in so doing demonstrated we did not have the necessary police protection. Within a short time, through a compromise between the management and employees, the strike ended and the cars in the city resumed normal operation. In the meantime, the stranger remained about the shed, associating with no one and keeping his own counsel. When the strike ended he quietly took his departure. He called for no remuneration, and I never learned his name or place of abode. The theory I have concerning him is that he was a dare-devil soldier of fortune with a fondness for a fight. 34 E piso d e s o f M y L if e In the year 1875 my father and associates built and operated a narrow gauge (three foot) steam railroad, called the St. Louis and Florissant Railroad, after­ wards known as the Westend Narrow Gauge Railway. Father was president of the road, and in later years I was superintendent. This railroad was a feeder to the Olive Street horsecar line. The eastern terminus of the Narrow Gauge Railway was on the north side of Olive Street, just across the line of the old city limits, at that time about one hundred yards west of Grand Avenue. For a few years the railroad ran to Wells Station, near our country home. It was then extended to Nor­ mandy, and in 1878 was operated to Florissant, its western terminus, with a total length of sixteen miles. The railroad was unique in its character. It had no freight traffic to speak of. The business was passenger service for the accommodation of the numerous coun­ try homes along its route, and in season it was largely utilized for picnic outings. As I now recall, among those who lived on beautiful estates along the line, and near-by, were the Colemans, the Blossoms, the O’Fallons, the Jeff. Clarks, the Turn­ ers, the Wells, the Lindsays, the Glasgows, the Hargadines, the Hameys, the Wickhams, the Kimballs, the Frosts, the Lucases, the Watermans, the Francises, the Cabannes, the Gambles, the Grahams. As I have no record, I probably have inadvertently omitted some I do not now recall. As I have heretofore stated, the service was unique and largely of a community character. I can now vis­ A S t r a n g e r W a n t s a J ob 35 ualize the sons and daughters of some of these families, school books under their arms, going to and returning from their respective schools—many of them are now grandparents. Well do I remember the joyous shouts and laughter of the thousands of children who were transported to their annual picnic outings. About 1884 this railroad was purchased by an Indi­ anapolis Syndicate. They abandoned that section of the road running from Morgan Street and Vandeventer Avenue to the terminus located on Olive Street. They then constructed from Morgan Street and Vandeventer Avenue, eastward to Sixth and Locust Streets, a cable road, known as the St. Louis Cable and Western Rail­ road. Later this road was acquired by the St. Louis and Suburban Railroad and a double track standard street railway gauge was substituted for the old nar­ row gauge, running from Vandeventer Avenue to Flor­ issant, and the entire road then from Florissant to Sixth Street was operated by the St. Louis and Subur­ ban Railway Company with electric power, and is now operated by the St. Louis Public Service Company. The business of the street railways increased pro­ portionately with the growth of the population and business activities. During the year of 1882 my father informed me that a syndicate had made him an offer to purchase a majority interest of the stock we held in the Missouri Railway Company, and he would leave the matter with me for a decision. Realizing that his health was fail­ ing, and the holding of such a large interest in one concern would cause him a certain amount of worry, 36 E p iso d e s o f M y L if e I concluded it would be best for us to dispose of our holdings. We sold to the syndicate a large percentage of our stock. A new organization was formed, father and I retiring from the management. Heedless of the state of his health, father was then induced to accept the presidency of the Laclede Gas Light Company. At that time there were three gas light companies in the city. The Laclede Company, serving the city north of Washington Avenue, the Carondelet Company in Carondelet, and the St. Louis Company in the district between the Laclede and Car­ ondelet companies. Some years ago the three com­ panies became merged into one, known as the Laclede Gas Light Company. After resigning the superintendency of the Missouri Railroad, I purchased a one-fourth interest in the Robert Brown Oil Company, a going concern. This company operated two oil mills located on the Missouri Pacific Railroad tracks just west of Jefferson Avenue. One mill manufactured linseed oil and linseed cake, and castor oil and castor cake. The other mill manu­ factured cottonseed oil (both winter and summer oil) and cottonseed oil cake. In addition to these mills, we operated a cottonseed mill at Belton, Texas. I started at the plants to learn the business, but was there only a short time, as our company was absorbed by the American Linseed Oil Company through an ex­ change of stock. This was the second large company called a trust that was organized in the United States, the first being the Standard Oil Company. VIII A Cattle R an ch n September 21, 1883, a syndicate composed principally of Western men (some of whom resided in St. Louis) having large range-cattle interests, obtained the unofficial sanction of the then Secretary of the Interior to enter into a written contract or lease with the Cheyenne and Arapahoe In­ dians for three million acres of land adaptable for grazing purposes. This lease was for a part of the Cheyenne-Arapahoe reservation located in the Indian Territory. These tribes together held about six mil­ lion acres, and the acreage specified in the lease was of no particular use to them. The terms of the lease called for the payment of $80,000 a year; $40,000 to be paid semi-annually, in advance, to the Indians in accordance with their ra­ tions allowance as determined by the Government Indian Agent in charge. Thus, every Indian of the tribes—bucks, squaws and minors—would receive com­ pensation in the same manner that the Government distributed food, clothing and other supplies. I have no doubt the Secretary of the Interior in his unofficial sanction of this transaction, considered the cash payment for the lease would be gratefully re­ ceived as financial assistance to the Indian tribes. O 38 E p iso d e s o f M y L if e The three million acres leased were divided among various cattle companies. Mr. F. B. York, who was interested in an open cattle range on Wolfe Creek in Lipscomb County, the extreme northeast county in the Panhandle of Texas, and who also operated general merchandise stores at Medicine Lodge and Dodge City, Kansas, together with Mr. J. W. Parker of Atchison, Kansas, obtained an allotment of this land consisting of about 378,000 acres. Based on this acreage together with the open range which Mr. York controlled, the Washita Cattle Com­ pany was organized with a capital of one million dol­ lars. The promoters induced my father and me to purchase a substantial interest in the company. Father was elected President; F. B. York, Vice-President and General Manager; D. T. Parker, a brother of J. W. Parker, Treasurer, and I was elected Secretary. Our Cheyenne-Arapahoe ranch was about twentyfive miles west of Darlington, the Indian Agency. Darlington was a mile from Fort Reno, the United States military post. There were no railroads west of Muskogee (on the M. K. & T. R. R.), in the Indian Territory, and none operating through the northern part of Texas. There was a branch of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad, with a terminus at Caldwell, a few miles north of the southern boundary of Kansas. To reach Darlington, the Indian Agency of the Cheyenne and Arapahoe tribes, we started from Cald­ well in a Concord stage drawn by four mules. Cross­ ing the Cherokee strip we rode a distance of one hun­ A Ca ttle R a n c h 39 dred and sixty miles, the journey requiring about six­ teen hours. Our two-horse buckboard would be waiting at Dar­ lington, and in it we drove to our territory ranch, a distance of about twenty-five miles, leaving all means of communication behind us. Having finished our business at this ranch, we then headed for our Panhandle ranch, en route to which it was necessary to ford the North Fork of the Cana­ dian River and the Canadian River, which took us over the Chism cattle trail, sometimes called the Na­ tional Cattle Trail, this trail running from the south­ ern boundary of Texas, into Kansas, Wyoming, Mon­ tana and Dakota. The cattle trail was corrugated into ruts caused by the passage of countless thousands of cattle, accompanied by grub wagons, the herds, of course, being guarded and in charge of cowboys. There were no railroads running to the north at that time and consequently, it was necessary to drive the cattle over this trail in order to get the steer cattle from the Southern country to the Northern grazing ranches for fattening and maturing before being of­ fered on the market. The soil of some sections of this cattle trail was alkali, and as it seldom rained there was much dust, which had a poisonous effect on the lungs, and was, I believe, in many cases the reason that caused the cowboys, with the help of liquor, to go on wild carou­ sals when reaching the towns en route, such as Dodge City. At that time Dodge City was probably the most unruly town in America. Every cowboy carried a six- 40 E piso d es o f M y L if e shooter and shooting scrapes were not infrequent. In later years when railroads in that section were in operation, the cattle were shipped by rail and the trail was abandoned. Concluding our stay at Wolfe Creek ranch, again, we headed north, crossing the neutral strip into Kan­ sas, and then to Dodge City, located on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad, where our overland journey ended. This entire overland drive by coach and buckboard, commencing at Caldwell, Kansas, and ending at Dodge City, covered a distance of several hundred miles. As I have stated, in leaving Darlington, the Chey­ enne and Arapahoe Indian Agency, we left communi­ cation with civilization behind, so except when we were at the ranches, it was necessary to carry with us food, cooking utensils and bedding, cooking our meals and frequently sleeping in the open. I made the journey several times, and being a tenderfoot found it extremely fatiguing, often suffering for want of fresh water. Over and over again I said, “ If I ever get back to a railroad, never will I complain of its service. A keg to sit on, a bunch of straw to lie on, in a box car, running fifteen miles an hour, would be luxury enough.” After obtaining possession of the leased lands in the Indian Territory, all of the cattle companies expended large sums of money in building wagon roads, trails, corrals and ranch houses; and, of course, a large amount of capital was used in the purchase of many thousands of young cattle for the stocking of the A Cattle R a n c h 41 ranches, the idea being to use these ranches for breed­ ing purposes, the steers, when sufficiently matured, be­ ing forwarded to the ranges farther north for fatten­ ing ready for the market. I have mentioned that one of the provisions of our lease required the payment of forty thousand dollars cash in advance, every six months. In order to allay any suspicion on the part of the Indians, the committee of three, representing the lessees, arranged to make the first payment with silver dollars. Imagine the risk and trouble of carting silver dollars of that amount! Colonel D. B. Dyer, the Indian Agent, persuaded the Indians to accept currency when subsequent payments were made. I served as one of a committee of three, F. B. York, Vice-President and General Manager of our company, and a Mr. Dicky, a large cattle operator from Chicago, constituting the committee making the third semi-an­ nual payment. The two tribes, Cheyenne and Arapahoe, numbered about six thousand. The rations tickets before referred to would range from one person to the number in a family, the buck or squaw, as the case might be, col­ lecting for the family. Therefore, it was necessary to provide currency of small denominations, one, five and ten dollar bills, and a few twenty dollar bills. Forty thousand dollars in bills of small denominations made some bulk. We placed the money in an old carpet bag, smuggled it on to the train which carried us to Caldwell; then, transferring to the Concord stage, we threw it under 42 E piso d es o f M y L ife the seat with the mail bags. The stage was drawn by four mules, with a typical Westerner as the stage driver. Our party had expected to have the stage to our­ selves, but a short time before the starting hour a typical Texan put in his appearance as a passenger. Being a stranger to us it naturally caused some con­ cern. En route, however, we learned who he was and why he was making the trip, which allayed our uneasi­ ness. His story was, that he had a son, who in passing through the Comanche and Kiowa Reservation, some distance south of the Cheyenne and Arapahoe Reser­ vation, got into a shooting scrape and the boy was placed under arrest. Now, in order for the father to get from Texas to the son, it was necessary for him to go north over the M. K. & T. R. R. and connect with the stage at Caldwell and then journey south to his destination. We started from Caldwell a little after three o’clock in the afternoon and jogged along in fine weather, with the side curtains rolled up. After sundown it grew cold and the curtains were lowered, and we were buttoned in with our blankets over our knees, fairly comfortable. Naturally, we gradually grew tired and drowsy. Well in the night, suddenly, without the slightest warning, the stage plunged forward and downward. In an instant, it was rocking from side to side, and was flooded with water almost to our knees. A Cattle R an c h 43 I shouted, “ Get out your knives and slash the cur­ tains,” there being every indication that we would be drowned like rats in a trap. By good fortune the lead­ ers got a foothold and we were yanked to dry ground. We piled out. Looking back we saw a raging stream and drift-wood and logs racing by. It seems that we were on the far bank of what was known as Wild Horse Dry Creek, with steep banks on either side. When we recovered our breath, and the stage driver untangled and adjusted the harness and informed us he was ready to proceed, the Texan, our fellow-passenger, said to the driver: “ Where are you going?” “ Why, to Darlington, of course,” the driver replied. “ No, you are not; I won’t permit you,” the Texan said. The driver, in an angry manner replied, “ I am carry­ ing the United States mail and I dare you to interfere with me.” Whereupon, the Texan drew a six-shooter and said, “ You unhitch those mules. I have been on the frontier all my life and never before have I had as close a call as I have just experienced, and I don’t propose to per­ mit you to drive me another step until daylight.” Under the circumstances, the driver, with the gun pointed at him, unhitched the mules and staked them out for the balance of the night. The Texan apologized to us for acting as he had, but informed us that he was in earnest; that he did not propose to ride any further until we had a clear road ahead. Ordinarily this crossing was a creek bottom with 44 E p iso d es o f M y L if e no water. That night, to the north there had been a cloud-burst; a freshet was the result, and the driver of the stage, being accustomed to crossing the dry creek bed, had carelessly plunged into the torrent. Those familiar with the dry creek and the effect of a cloud-burst freshet could scarcely credit our escape. Some months afterward we were water-bound at this same crossing, waiting for the water to subside, and it appeared to be an utter impossibility for a stage to ford it, and, as some one said, it was a miracle that we got through in safety on the former occasion. On reaching Darlington several hours late, Colonel D. B. Dyer, the Indian Agent, met us, and we told him of our experience. We were apprehensive as to the condition of the currency which we had brought with us. He provided us with a room on the second floor of a building and a guard was stationed at the entrance. We took our carpet bag to this room, where we opened it and found, as we expected, that the bundles of currency were saturated with water, making it im­ possible to count or handle the bills. Three of us spent two days, one of us being always present in the room, spreading out the bills on the floor, on the furniture, and everywhere, and vigor­ ously using palm leaf fans. Finally the money was in a condition that we could handle it. The Agent called in the Indians and the payment was made. The several cattle companies were in peaceful pos­ session for two years, from the Fall of 1883 to the Fall of 1885. During this period much capital was A Cattle Ra n c h 45 invested in the building of roads, the erection of houses, the construction of corrals and fences, but, by far, the largest amount was expended in the purchase of thousands of young heifers in stocking the ranches. There was every indication that the enterprise was sound. But, “ You never can tell what a day may bring forth.” Without warning, there were published in several of the daily newspapers in the Middle West sensational articles denouncing alleged outrages being perpetrated by cattlemen against the Indians in the Cheyenne-Arapahoe reservation. The news was so startling and so unbelievable that Mr. York and I took the first train to Caldwell and then by stage to Dar­ lington, the Indian Agency. On reaching the Reservation we went into confer­ ence with Coloned D. B. Dyer, the Government’s In­ dian Agent, and were assured there was no foundation for the newspaper reports. I wrote to the editor of one of our St. Louis papers and informed him that there was no justification for the news items and editorials that were published in his paper regarding the alleged outrage. I told him a large amount of St. Louis capital was involved and much financial loss might ensue. I did not make a favorable impression. The items and editorials con­ tinued. These sensational articles were brought to the atten­ tion of President Grover Cleveland and caused the President to instigate an investigation. At that time it was said that the President had no personal knowl­ 46 E piso d e s o f M y L if e edge of the West; in fact, that he had never been west of Buffalo, New York. President Cleveland did what he thought, no doubt, was the logical and effective manner in which to ascer­ tain the status of the situation. He appointed a repre­ sentative, one familiar with the Western country, to go to the reservation with instructions to investigate and report. Mr. York and I being informed of the expected visit of the President’s agent, decided we would remain in Darlington until his arrival. He put in an appearance and made his headquarters at the Officers’ Club at Fort Reno, about a mile from Darlington. Mr. York and I, also, had entree to this club. As far as we could determine, there was no investi­ gation as to the relationship between the lessees and the Indians. Colonel Dyer, for the benefit of the President’s representative, called in the Indians for a powwow. There being no occasion for Mr. York and me to re­ main for this conference, we started in our buckboard for our Territory ranch. En route we passed groups of Indians—bucks, squaws and their papooses—pic­ turesque in their colored blankets, feathers, paint and other Indian paraphernalia, headed for the Agency. They were in a surly and angry mood, which we ac­ counted for on the theory that the Indians supposed they were called in for the purpose of disarmament, which they resented. Surely, if Mr. York and I had felt that the lessees were at fault, we would not have left the protection A Ca t t l e R a n c h 47 of the Indian Agency. As I recall, it was about three weeks after leaving Darlington that we arrived at Dodge City. During the journey we were out of communication with the outside world, and it is impossible for me to express the shock experienced on arriving at Dodge City and there being informed that the President’s special representative had made a report unfavorable to the lessees, and resulting therefrom, President Cleveland on July 23, 1885, proclaimed the forty day notice. At least 200,000 head of cattle had to be driven out. Representatives of the lessees had an audience with the President and vigorously protested the short notice that had been given, stating that many thousands of cattle would perish from the hardship of an enforced drive. In the issuance of the order President Cleveland un­ doubtedly had the legal right, but had exercised it recklessly. The losses under the enforced drive were very great. I have been informed that in 1886 the President in referring to his action in this instance, expressed re­ gret insomuch as he felt he had been too precipitous. This is an anecdote of forty-six years ago. I have no records and relate it solely on my recollection of my observations and what was told me at the time. Now, what led up to this incident? Prior to our getting possession of the leasehold lands a portion was utilized by a few white men, and held through an understanding with some of the Indian chiefs, to whom 48 E piso d es o f M y L if e meagre compensation was made. Before we took pos­ session it was necessary to have these men and their cattle removed. This was partially done with the as­ sistance of United States Cavalry stationed at Fort Reno, which in itself was a tacit recognition of our unofficial rights to the premises. The men driven off naturally were embittered and revengeful, and on the outlook for an opportunity to get even. These were the days of the “ Wild West.” There were located along the southern boundary of Kansas, adjacent to the Cherokee strip, a few poor white settlers. Without warning there appeared at the Kansas border, which was more than one hundred and fifty miles north of the Cheyenne and Arapahoe leased grazing lands, a band of renegade Indians, who started a series of horse stealing raids. These settlers were only too glad to seize this as an excuse to stampede to the towns to the north and seek a more favorable location in which to live. Now, this turned out to be the setting of a powder mine ready to be fired. Based upon the horse raiding scare, there were inaugurated sensational news items falsely charging outrages upon the Indians by the lessees of the grazing lands. These sensational articles were copied by newspapers throughout the country. The inference was that the horse-stealing raids were instigated by those formerly occupying the grazing country, for the purpose of ousting those who were in possession under the lease described, having in mind that they would probably again have an opportunity to regain possession of the grazing lands of the Chey- A Cattle R a n c h 49 enne and Arapahoe Indians, and resulted in the Presi­ dent issuing an order requiring the cattle companies to vacate within forty days. IX A V enture in G old M in in g ramble on another quest, for “ a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.” It was the purchase of a gold mine. This venture, like the cattle range, was most alluring. The experience, however, differed. The cattle range scorched our hide; the gold mine but slightly singed it. In the year 1883, my father and J. W. Parker, of Atchison, Kansas, purchased the Homestake Mine, located in a small mining camp, called White Oaks, Territory of New Mexico. The ore of the mine was free milling of low grade in which were found pockets of high grade ore containing very rich wire gold speci­ mens. In the development of the mine no defined lode or vein was uncovered. One of the inducements leading to the purchase of the mine was the claim of a mill operator that he could extract the gold by using an electric process. Arrange­ ments accordingly were made, machinery purchased and a plant erected. All of this required considerable time, the mine being remote from a railroad. How­ ever, after the plant was in operation it did not take long to realize that the process was a failure. I took no part in this mining enterprise until Janu­ ary 5, 1886, subsequent to the failure of the electrolytic I n ow A V e n t u r e i n G old M i n i n g 51 process. At that time the White Oaks Mining and Milling Company was incorporated. The officers of this company were, Thomas Howard, President; Edwin S. Chester, Vice-President; Rolla Wells, Secretary and Treasurer. The directors were, Erastus Wells, John W. Harrison and James W. Parker. This company entered into a contract to mill the Homestake ore. I was instructed to purchase a twenty stamp gold mill. I went to Chicago, and through Mr. William J. Chalmers, of the old firm of Frazer & Chalmers, made the purchase. I remember being in Chicago over Sunday, a bit­ terly cold day. Mr. Chalmers took me for a sleigh ride through the parks. In the summer of 1931, while at my summer home at Wequetonsing, Michigan, I came in contact with a friend of Mr. Chalmers. It seems Mr. Chalmers had asked her to inquire, when she saw me, whether or not I remembered the sleigh ride. To me this was a pleas­ ant incident, as the sleigh ride had occurred forty-five years before. The town of White Oaks was not easily reached, especially difficult in the delivery of heavy freight such as a stamp mill. The only railroad in the vicinity was the Atchison, Topeka and Sante Fe Railroad, and to go to White Oaks, you left the train about seven o’clock in the morning at a small station principally used as a water tank for railroad purposes. This station was called San Antonio, located about ten miles south of Socorro. After a miserable breakfast in a ramshackle shack, 52 E p iso d e s o f M y L if e we boarded a two-horse Concord stage. The route was in a southeasterly direction. A short distance out we ran into heavy sand, impregnated with alkali. The pulling was so heavy the horses barely moved. It re­ quired several hours to cross this sand, and as it was always hot in that section, the heat and alkali dust were intolerable. After this wearisome journey in the sand, which we thought would never come to an end, we reached solid ground. Further on we were in the foothills of the Sierra Oscuro mountain range. Further on we came to the Mai Pais (Spanish for bad lands). The Mai Pais was an ancient flow of flint-like porous lava. It was a conglomerate mass with a winding wagon trail about two miles long, very rough, with many short ascents and descents. On the eastern border of the Mai Pais was a crude stage station, built of lava blocks, where fresh horses were obtained. In the night, crossing the foothills of another moun­ tain range (Sierra Blanca) it became bitterly cold. About five o’clock in the morning we arrived at White Oaks, a typical Western mining town, with one main street, one general store in which was located the post office, and a stage-coach office and stable. The first time I made this trip, being uninformed of its character, and, therefore, not adequately clothed, I was, on reaching White Oaks, so benumbed with the cold that it was necessary that I be lifted out of the stage. To-day, there is a railroad within a few miles of White Oaks; also, an automobile highway. White Oaks, New Mexico, 1883 White Oaks, New Mexico, 1883 A V e n t u r e i n G old M i n i n g 53 In due time the mill machinery which I purchased in Chicago arrived and was erected ready for service. It turned out to be an excellent mill, but (and here comes the frequent “but” in most mining ventures), the yield derived from the ore was disappointing. We struggled along until the fall of 1890, not meet­ ing operating expenses. The company then went into bankruptcy. At a Sheriff’s sale I bought in the prop­ erty. A new company was formed, of which I became the president and largest stockholder, which would indi­ cate that I was the principal creditor of the old com­ pany. After several years of additional operation of the property, it was sold to a coterie of miners living at White Oaks. In spite of the failure of the venture, I enjoyed my visits at White Oaks and its vicinity. While the coun­ try roundabout was dry and there were no streams, the climate was excellent. The elevation of the town was about six thousand feet. I did a great deal of horseback riding through the ravines and into the mountains. It might be of interest to note that White Oaks was within about ten miles of the rendezvous of a noted outlaw of that period, called “ Billy the Kid.” Billy was finally rounded up and shot by Pat Garrett, a wellknown and picturesque sheriff who afterwards was quite a friend of President Theodore Roosevelt. As I have before said, I severed all interest in the mining property and its mill. “ The pot of gold at the end of the rainbow” was always just out of our reach. X T he S t . L ouis F air A ssociation I visualize the past there stands out the pleasing mental picture of the Old Fair Grounds. Its annual six-day Fair, with the family gatherings and joyous assembly of people of all classes. It was the Mecca of fanners, stock breed­ ers, merchants, bankers and politicians, intermingling with city folk; renewing friendships and exchanging ideas. I can see the agricultural field covered with wind­ mills and machinery of all kinds, in demonstration. The horse and cow barns; the sheep and swine pens, full of the finest livestock in the land. The poultry sheds; the fruit and flower pavilions filled with luscious fruits of all kinds and beautiful flowers and stately plants. Then, the Machinery Hall, with the exhibits of upto-date devices. The Textile Building, filled with dis­ plays of delicate needlework and other miscellaneous articles, the handiwork of ladies and girls. I visualize the exhibitors in all these departments in friendly competition for the blue, red, white and honor­ able mention premium ribbons. I see the large amphitheatre with its circular arena and the speed contests of roadsters, carriage horses, W hen T h e S t . L o u is F a ir A s s o c ia t io n 55 gaited saddle horses, ponies, and the mirthful mule races. I see the thousands of interested, excited and goodnatured spectators, generous with their applause, viewing the contests and anxiously awaiting the awards. I hear the voices of thousands of school children shouting and laughing, skipping and running here, there, and everywhere, on the free admission day set apart for them. Then comes “Big Thursday,” a holiday and all busi­ ness suspended, with vehicles of all kinds pressed into service, street horse-cars jammed with the happy popu­ lace, to the number of one hundred to one hundred and twenty-five thousand, all en route to the Big Fair. No city ever had a more wholesome and enjoyable rendezvous. The St. Louis Agricultural and Mechanical Associ­ ation, commonly known as the St. Louis Fair, was in­ corporated by an Act of the State Legislature in 1855. The incorporators were Andrew Harper, John O’Fallon, Martin Hannah, Walter H. Dorsett, Robert Martin, Ollie Williams, John Liegerson, Andrew Chris­ tie, John M. Chambers, John Harnett, Thurston Grimsley, H. J. Bodley, Henry C. Hart, Thomas J. January, John Renfrew, John Withnell, John Sappington and William C. Jenks. The charter stated that the objects of the associa­ tion were the promotion of improvements in the vari­ ous departments of agriculture, including fruits, vege­ tables and ornamental gardening; the promotion of the mechanical arts in all their various branches; the 56 E p iso d es o f M y L if e improvement of breeds of all useful and domestic ani­ mals, and the general advancement of rural economy and household manufactures. The first Board of Directors was elected, May 4, 1856, and consisted of Andrew Harper, N. J. Coleman, Henry T. Blow, J. Richard Barret, John M. Chambers, Thomas T. January, Henry C. Hart, John Withnell, Thurston Grimsley, Fred Dings, George W. Hughes, Henry S. Turner and Charles L. Hunt. Mr. Barret was elected the first President, and Mr. G. O. Kalb the first Secretary, which position he held for twenty-five years. The office of President of the Association from its inception, was held by the following gentlemen: J. Richard Barret, 1856-59; Andrew Harper, 1860; Charles Todd, 1861-65; D. G. Taylor, 1866; A. B. Barret, 1866-73; Julius S. Walsh, 1874; Charles Green, 1875-90. I became its eighth President after serving five years as a member of the Board of Directors, and held the office for three years, 1891-92-93. The other officers were L. M. Rumsey, First Vice-President; C. C. Maffitt, Second Vice-President; Ellis Wainwright, Third VicePresident; A. B. Ewing, Treasurer, and William M. Lockwood, Secretary. The other directors were Alvah Mansur, James Green, General J. W. Turner, William F. Nolker and D. R. Francis. At the time I was elected President the Association was in financial difficulty. A first mortgage bond issue had matured and there was a second mortgage issue outstanding. The proceeds of these bonds had been St. Louis Jockey Club House and Grandstand T h e S t . L o u is F a ir A s s o c ia t io n 57 largely used in the construction of a race-course, in­ cluding a substantial grandstand, a beautiful Jockey Club House, numerous stables, roadways, etc., all of which joined the old Fair Grounds immediately to the west, and were a part of the property of the Fair Association. In a reorganization plan, the capital stock had been increased, which authorized the issue of eight hundred thousand dollars of five per cent refunding bonds. A voting stock trustee was provided with John T. Davis, Charles Parsons and L. M. Rumsey acting as the trustees. After I was installed as President, Mr. Alvah Man­ sur and I succeeded in placing four hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars of five per cent bonds. As I look back upon the experience Mr. Mansur and I had, it is refreshing to recall the liberality with which a number of citizens subscribed to this issue of refund­ ing bonds, based primarily on the sentiment they held for the old Fair Association and their belief in its present and future benefit to the city, inasmuch as the bonds were not what might be considered a sound financial investment. It may be of interest for me to mention the many prominent people who, from time to time, were visi­ tors to the Fair during its existence: The Prince of Wales, afterward King Edward V II; President U. S. Grant; President Grover Cleveland and his bride; President Benjamin Harrison; VicePresident Henry Wilson; Vice-President Thomas Hendricks; Vice-President Schuyler Colfax; General 58 E piso d es o f M y L if e W. S. Hancock; Horace Greeley; General F. P. Blair, Jr.; Stephen A. Douglas; Governor B. Gratz Brown; General W. T. Sherman; General Bosie; General Philip H. Sheridan; General John B. Fullerton; the Emperor of Brazil, Dom Pedro; the Duke of New­ castle, the Grand Duke Alexis of Russia, and many Governors, Senators, Judges and other outstanding citizens of this state and country. Abraham Lincoln attended the Fair before the Civil War. It would be difficult to enumerate the many promi­ nent St. Louisans who generously devoted their time assisting in the upbuilding and management of this institution. The first thing for which I had to prepare was the thoroughbred running meeting to be held the following June. We had a special racing outfit, a commodious grandstand and club house. The Jockey Club was under the management of the directors of the Fair Association. When I assumed the presidency the membership had dwindled to less than two hundred. I called a meeting of the members and submitted to them a co-operative plan for the manage­ ment of the club by its members. A direct, or legal, control could not be granted, because it would affect the exemption from taxation of the property of the Fair Association. The plan submitted and adopted created more active interest among the club members. An advisory board, a house committee, a membership committee, and other committees were created. I particularly selected several of my friends whom I knew to be active and aggres­ T h e S t . L o u is F a ir A s s o c ia t io n 59 sive, to serve on the membership committee, and started a campaign to increase the membership. In a comparatively short time we succeeded in in­ creasing the membership to 660, which, at fifty dollars each, gave the Fair Association a fund amounting to thirty-three thousand dollars, which, in our impover­ ished condition, was a great help in enabling us to tide over until the June racing meeting. The St. Louis Jockey Club (the Fair Association) was a member of the Western Racing Association. In the assignment of racing dates (there were no pro­ longed race meetings at that time), the Memphis Jockey Club started the season early in the Spring, running about ten days. Then came the Nashville Jockey Club meeting; then the Latonia Jockey Club at Covington, Ky., across the river from Cincinnati; then the Lexington Jockey Club; then came the Louisville Jockey Club meeting, and, following the Louisville, the St. Louis Jockey Club meeting. We ran thirteen days, closing on Friday, so that the Washington Park Club (Chicago) could open on Sat­ urday, the following day, on which the American Derby was run. The Chicago meeting lasted about thirty days, extending into the month of July. This circuit was ideal from a climatic standpoint and most advantageous to patrons, owners, breeders and followers of racing, as they were then enabled to start early in the Spring at Memphis, then forwarding their stables from track to track, ending the season the latter part of July at Chicago. The June meeting of the St. Louis Jockey Club was 60 E piso d e s of M y L if e most successful from a racing point of view, socially and financially. I sold the betting privilege (book­ makers) for this meeting for $30,000; the bar and restaurant privileges in the grandstand also brought a handsome amount, which, together with the gate ad­ missions, took care of our purses and stakes and oper­ ating expenses, leaving a substantial surplus. At this meeting I was fortunate in having Colonel M. Lewis Clark to act as presiding judge, and Mr. J. F. Caldwell, the most noted race-horse starter of his day, together with his negro assistant, known as Polo Jim, to act as starter at our meeting, there being no mechanical starting devices at that time. At this meet­ ing the racing stewards were C. C. Maffitt, Joseph Lucas and myself. All the old frequenters who are now living know, of course, the high standing of Colonel Clark as a presiding judge and Caldwell as a starter. This race meeting was an outstanding social func­ tion of St. Louis. It was the rendezvous for society, and the equipages, both going to and coming from the races, on Grand Avenue, were most picturesque. Many social functions were held in the Jockey Club House. The scene on the club house grounds and the ver­ andas, with the varied colored parasols and gowns of the ladies, was brilliant. Next came the preparation for the annual six-day fair, always held the first week in October. For the children and grown-ups nothing in St. Louis was more popular than the Zoo in the Fair Grounds. The bear pits especially attracted large throngs. These buildings are still standing in Fairground Park, al­ T h e S t . L o u is F a ir A s s o c ia t io n 61 though their appearance has been somewhat altered. When Mr. E. A. Noonan was Mayor of St. Louis and I was President of the Fair, an effort was made to convert the Fair into a municipal institution. Mr. Charles Parsons, president of the State Bank, origi­ nated the plan for the city to own the institution and operate it through a board of trustees. Legal obstacles intervened to prevent consummation of the plan. Mayor Noonan, however, had his wish gratified for founding the Zoo in Forest Park. The Fair Association proposed to donate the animals to the city, but this, too, was found to be impracticable, and the animals were sold at auction, the City of St. Louis buying those which it desired for the Forest Park Zoo. Citizens formed the Forest Park Zoological Association and contributed to the city a fund with which to purchase the animals. During my incumbency as President of the Fair Association I had an experience which might prove of some interest. One day, while seated in my office, a stranger stepped in, and, when I looked at him, there was something in his appearance and manner, difficult for me now to describe, which impressed me favorably. When he approached, I noticed he had a roll of papers under his arm. He informed me that he had complete plans and specifications for an air-ship. Now, as stated, there was something about the man which impressed me favorably; otherwise, I probably would have held up my hands and told him I was not interested in air-ships, as at that time air-ships were visionary in the extreme. 62 E piso d es o f M y L ife I said to him, however, “All right, let’s see what you have.” He unfolded his blue prints and explained the draw­ ings, and, as I now recall, they were practically a counterpart of the dirigible air-ships that are now be­ ing so successfully navigated all over the world. While he was explaining, the thought came to me that by some miracle, or chance, he might make a demonstration, and if so and I could control the flight and have it occur within the Fair Grounds, it might attract a multitude of people, resulting in the Fair Association reaping a handsome financial reward. With this thought, I agreed to personally finance the venture to a reasonable extent. I gave him permission to erect a tent within the race track enclosure. Naturally, it was not long before there was considerable publicity as to what was going on, the effect of which was some good-natured ridicule directed at me by my intimate friends, who wanted to know if I had lost my senses in the belief than an air­ ship was within the realm of possibility. The man remained in the race track enclosure up to a period when our next race meeting was about to open, which made it necessary to have the tent re­ moved as it was not advisable to have it within the enclosure during, or just before the meeting. This gentleman’s name was E. J. Pennington. He was very sanguine and worked diligently, but was un­ able to make a demonstration up to the time when it became necessary to move him away from the site allotted to him. So my vision of a demonstration with­ T h e S t . L o u is F a ir A s s o c ia t io n 63 in the Fair Grounds came to naught. At the time the newspapers commented on Mr. Pennington and his ef­ forts, but everyone was so skeptical of success that the articles were in a very light vein and of a burlesque character. I never again came in contact with Mr. Pennington. I am convinced that there was but one thing that pre­ vented the demonstration that I had hoped for, and that was, that at that time (1892) the gas or gasoline motor had not been sufficiently perfected to provide the necessary power for the propulsion of an airship. As we all know, today air-planes and dirigible air­ ships are a reality, and I have the satisfaction of real­ izing that my friends and others back in 1892 lacked the vision of the ultimate mastery of the air, and not I. In the early 80’s some antagonism existed against the management of the Fair Association, which re­ sulted in the organization and operation of what was known as The St. Louis Exposition and Music Hall Association, the building of which was located where the Public Library now stands. The time of holding this exposition overlapped the time for holding the annual fair, thus causing more or less competition, which I believe ultimately resulted in the discontinuance of the annual fair. I was a director of the St. Louis Agricultural and Mechanical Association for nine years. Of the nine years, I was Treasurer for five years, and President for three years, my tenure ending in 1893. XI F airground P a r k of the opinion that the old St. Louis Fair was one of the most popular, successful and advan­ tageous enterprises our city ever had. Since its discontinuance St. Louis has had no regular annual institution or celebration appealing directly to the farmers of the South and West; nor has the city had, I believe, an autumnal festival which pleased our own populace like the old Fair. Times have changed, I appreciate; yet I feel that something like this widely celebrated institution would thrive today; in fact, I think that St. Louis needs an annual celebration and exhibition with which to draw the farmers and their families to this great center of the Mississippi Valley. It pleased me that the turn of events afforded the opportunity, when I was Mayor, to leave a permanent memorial of the famous St. Louis Fair. The city bought the grounds on north Grand Avenue formerly used by the Fair Association, and actuated by senti­ ment, I named the recreation place Fairground Park. Keeping alive the glory of the once popular Fair will, I hope, at some future time lead to the inception of a new enterprise to entertain and interest the people of the South and West. One of the most satisfying legislative acts of the I am F air g r o u n d P a r k 65 Municipal Assembly during my second term of office was the acquisition for park purposes of this property. The transaction is explained in a letter from Mr. F. W. Carter under the recent date of November 7, 1931, addressed to me as follows: “ Referring to the acquisition of the property now known as the Fairground Park, on north Grand Ave­ nue, of this city, during the second term of your ad­ ministration as Mayor of the City of St. Louis, I have to say that I feel that if it had not been for your efforts the city never would have acquired this prop­ erty, which was acquired at an exceedingly reasonable price, namely $700,000 for the 134 acres. “ The facts in connection with the transaction are about as follows: “ In the latter part of 1907, the Missouri-Lincoln Trust Company was then in liquidation and was the owner of the equity in the property at the northwest corner of Seventh and Olive Streets, this city, which was then known as the Missouri Trust Building and which was subject to a total encumbrance of $650,000. The Trust Company succeeded in trading the equity in this building to Mr. Louis Celia and his associates for the old Fair Grounds, consisting of 134 acres, and fifteen acres at the southwest corner of Fair and Kos­ suth Avenues, free and clear of encumbrances. “About the time this deal was consummated, a bill was introduced in the House of Delegates of the City of St. Louis, authorizing the acquisition of the 134acre tract at a price of $700,000. Of course, the city had not available funds to pay this price, and, with 66 E piso d e s o f M y L if e your co-operation, it was arranged to place a deed of trust on the property secured by 13 notes maturing annually for $50,000 each, bearing four per cent in­ terest, so that the equity could be acquired by the city for $50,000. “ For some reason (which I have never learned) the House of Delegates delayed for some time the passage of this ordinance; in fact, they delayed it so long that the owners had made up their minds to sub-divide the Fair Grounds and sell it for residential purposes. When I communicated this determination to you, and after you stated your attitude to me in the matter, which was that under no circumstances should we abandon the effort to sell this property to the city for a park, and that you felt if advantage was not to be taken of the opportunity to acquire that property for a park, future generations would damn you for neglecting such opportunity, I was able to persuade the owners to defer the sub-division of the property, and with your efforts we finally secured the passage of an ordinance authorizing the purchase of the property at the price stated, and the city has paid for the property in full since that time out of its current revenue. “ I now feel, and have always felt, but for your co­ operation the opportunity to acquire this property would have been lost to the people of St. Louis.” The acquiring of this property for park purposes rounded out what we already had, and placed St. Louis in an enviable position, regarding parks, when com­ pared with other cities, as will be shown by the follow­ ing figures: F air g r o u n d P a r k St. Louis: Population 575,000* Park acreage per 1,000—3.84% Philadelphia: Population 1,292,000 Park acreage per 1,000—3.08% New York City: Population 3,437,000 Park acreage per 1,000—2.02% Chicago: Population 1,698,000 Park acreage per 1,000—2.00% * Census of 1909. 67 XII B asic S teel I ndustry 1891, I acquired an interest in the St. Louis Steel Foundry Company, located in East St. Louis, Illinois. I took no active part in the management. The company was engaged in the manu­ facture of crucible steel and subsequently Bessemer steel castings. The practice at that time was the pouring of molten steel into a dry, or baked, mold, thereby limiting the output to simple designs. The manufacture of a sound casting of a complex shape in a dry mold was con­ sidered impossible, on account of the great shrinkage of the metal in cooling, and then, when brought into contact with the complex form of the dry sand mold, resulting in checks, or flaws, and an unmarketable product.
