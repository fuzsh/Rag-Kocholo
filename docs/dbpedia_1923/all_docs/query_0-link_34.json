Morrissey, 28-year-old commander of the Thirty-sixth Division Infantry Company in which Sgt. Chas. E. (Commando) Kelly was serving when he won the Congressional Medal of Honor a year ago, was last reported held at Oflag 64 at Szubin, Poland. That camp was captured by the Russians last Jan. 22.\n\nA veteran of the Salerno invasion, Capt.

He was taken prisoner last May 27 during the Fifth Army's drive toward Rome.\n\nPRIVATE ROBERT \"BOB\" MARTINEAU\n\nPrivate Robert \"Bob\" Martineau, recently freed from Billbid Prison, in Manila, where he has been held prisoner of the Japanese since the fall of Bataan in 1942. Bob enlisted in the Marine Corps in October, 1939. He was wounded twice in the historic battle of the Philippines. He attended St. James' Parochial School and is well known by a host of the old-timers. Considering his long stay in prison his condition is regarded as being very good. Bob has two brothers now serving with the Navy. Eugene at present is in England while Jim is in active service in the Atlantic.\n\nPRISONERS\n\nLt. John D. Bante, 20, navigator of a bomber, who was listed as missing in action November 25, is reported a prisoner of war in Germany. His mother lives at 1037 Fairmont Avenue.\n\nJoseph V.

He was sent back to his old Company and on November 26th was reported missing in action.\n\nOn December 5th a fine little boy was born to Adrienne and Sonny Haller. If Sonny is a prisoner, we hope he gets to hear about this.\n\nP. S. We are very happy to add this paragraph. Since writing the above, the Kies received a letter from Sonny in a German Prison Camp.\n\nDISTINGUISHED UNIT CITATION\n\nCpl Frank C. Koch, 6227 Victoria ave.\n\nTech. Sgt. Robert G.

Brother of Mrs. Dolores Thiele, 6654 Villa Avenue.\n\nDOGTOWN FAMILY\n\n(Wack's)\n\nHeavy is the six star pin that is always worn on the lapel of Mr. John Wack, but light in comparison to the anxiety and worry that he and Mrs. Wack have for their six boys in the service. Going down the list from the eldest to the youngest, we find John, although not in uniform, representing the Wabash Railroad in a post in the nation's capital. Art, the next in line, is a Marine fighting with the Fifth Division, which recently captured Iwo Jima. Bill is in Italy with a front line artillery outfit. Bob, who flew sixty missions in the Southwest Pacific theater, is now stationed at Scott Field, Illinois. Dick, a Coast Guardsman, is now serving aboard a Liberty ship believed to be supporting the troops on Iwo Jima. Let's hope he and Art can get together. Jimmy, also in the Coast Guard, is presently on duty in the Mediterranean Sea. Frances, the youngest, is in the Navy. He is in the Eighth Task Force which recently gained a decisive victory in the great sea battle of the Philippines. These boys are well known for their athletic prowess, and seldom, if ever, has there been a team from the neighborhood that did not show a Wack on the roster. For many years the Wack family lived on Tamm avenue. Several years ago they moved for larger quarters. Dogtown has and always will be their home though, as is proven by their presence here when home on leave. We salute you, Mr. and Mrs. Wack, for your contribution, both to our community and to the armed forces.\n\nPvt. F. C. A. Win. Wack, 2742, Btry. B. 151, F. A. Bn. APO 34, c/o P. M. New York, N.

Pursley\n\nTHE SOCIAL, SCENE: The crowded booths in Haley's Double Dip, the haven of all the teen-agers . . . much faster company than the Tamm Confectionery (Newroth's). Walter Droege and Jimmy Brown (brother to Fantastic) becoming very indignant when refused a table at the White House for their hamburgers and milk of a Saturday night -- there's no curfew on the Yankee Grill, fellows. What's that White House coming to? On the previous night the bartender was eating an ice cream cone. Wonder how that goes topped off with a cold bottle of suds. The only thing that was missing at Jack O'Shea's place on St. Pat's was the familiar faces of former years. The corned beef and cabbage was delicious, to say nothing of the mellow Budweiser, topped only by the potent high-balls served with green ice cubes. Snail Corbett was the character of the day with his black handle-bar mustache and green Keystone Cop hat. Carrying a green shillelagh and wearing an ill fitting uniform he resembled a typical Irish flat-foot. Although Jack's is usually the affair on St. Patrick's day, Pat Connolly was not to be outdone. Serving a well cooked ham to the customers along with a smooth line of chatter, the laughter and gaiety was truly a feast unsurpassed. At the finish of the parade, we come to the White House. Mary Dwyer reports a tremendous crowd, having had their fill of food elsewhere, finished out the glorious day in true Irish custom. But was it really necessary to call on Bob Sullivan and Gussie Theodre of the M. P.'s to keep order? Buddy Reese and his crowd practically took over the place. Wasn't that Dave Droege who moved in on the late watch?\n\nHEIR-ER'S: It's a boy for the John Columbo's. Pull that chest in brother or you'll be back in service. Another blessed event for Ray Essma and his charming wife, Mary Corbett -- female. Let's have another, bartender. WHOOPS, that don't belong here.\n\nCIRCUMSTANCES WHAT PREVAIL: The paving on Tamm Avenue, the main drag, with Macadam -- to the eye, the town's most pleasing improvement. Joe Rossomano, the shoemaker, looking sad and neglected for want of an honest card game. Young Joe was an interpreter in Italy but is now serving in France. The school yard of St. James Parish -- a monument to the ideals and years of service given the community by Father O'Connor. The only full length athletic field in the neighborhood, complete with lights, skating rink, tennis court and football field. The local \"brownout\" seems to be hindering the direction of some of the \"regulars\" from tavern to tavern. One taming the home front is really fighting for, and getting in some places, is a large glass of suds for the same pre-war price. The deserted lamp-post and mail box. on the corner of Clayton and Tamm, formerly a meeting place for the \"cowboys,\" now going to the dogs -- literally speaking. Red McVey nursing a sore lip, claims his pet pooch nipped him in the kisser. That's a strange way to smooch.\n\nPAGE 4\n\nPvt. John D. Clark, 17163412,\n\nHq. Btry.533rd F. A.

The game ending in a tie, 1 and 1. St. James, battling against a strong wind, were the first to score. Billy Holmes dented the net with a powerful drive which would have taken the goalie into the net also had he stepped in front of it.\n\nMickey Mayor and Jack McVey were picked for the All Star Municipal Junior team.\n\nIt seems as though the younger generation from Dogtown has a different idea than their older brothers and uncles in this respect. A year or two ago it was nothing to see a couple of \"guys\" step out of Shea's, Pat's or the White House and start slugging it out. After a few black eyes they would return to the bar and have a few more slugs together. After seeing quite a bit of this the younger fellows decided that if they were to get their eyes blackened or their noses bloodied they wanted to be fighting for something. This year in the Golden Gloves the following boys were entered: Billy Holmes, Bobby Rooney, Bob Brady and Corky Kehm. Billy Holmes went on to win the 117 pound class for sub-novices. Bobby Rooney and Bobby Brady went to the semifinals where both were eliminated after giving a. good account of themselves. Corky Kehm met with a little stiffer opposition, however, and was eliminated earlier in the tournament. Hats off to these fellows for putting Dogtown on the map as far as boxing is concerned.\n\nBobby Corbett.\n\nThis picture was sent in to the Dogtown News by Spider Corbett and he tell us it was taken on last Christmas Day.

Ralph Miller.)\n\nA hillbilly had been courting a mountain gal. At last her father spoke up: \"You've been seeing Nellie for nigh onto a year. What are your intentions -- honorable or dishonorable?\" The startled young blood replied: \"You me n I got a choice?\"\n\nA committee was appointed by the magazine \"Redbook\" to study the question of how best to hold a wife, and a selected list of husbands was written to. The only reply received was from a certain western penitentiary. It stated briefly: \"I found the best way was around the neck, but it should not be overdone. Please note change of address.\"\n\nRoad sign in England cautioning careful driving . . somewhat dismaying to American soldiers. REMEMBER!

That's no truck driver. That's General Hauling. Didn't you see the sign?\"\n\n=======================================\n\nWe have had many inquiries regarding the Dogtown News. How it started? How it is financed and where we get our news?\n\nIts main purpose is to answer the many letters received from our boys and girls asking for news of neighborhood and their friends here in the states and overseas. It was started in the White House and, of course, we argued on many points but not the name. All were in favor of \"Dogtown News.\"\n\nWe had thought of soliciting ads from the business men in the neighborhood to finance it and we knew they would be more than willing to subscribe, but Bernie Huff suggested having sponsors to support it and this met with the approval of all.\n\nThe sponsors listed are responsible for this news sheet and its continuance.\n\nBob Corbett edits our Sports column. Bob was awarded the Muny Soccer Association Cup for the Outstanding Soccer Player of 1943 and 1944.\n\nPaul Pursley is our My Nights columnist, and Walter Winchell could not be better.\n\nOur other news items we gather from newspapers and letters received here in the tavern, Johnny's Barber Shop and the boys' and girls' families and friends.\n\nRed Belleville is in charge of our printing and we think he has done a splendid job.\n\nWe are glad our first issue received such a grand ovation and we will appreciate any news items sent to us.\n\nMary Dwyer.\n\nHOME DOGTOWN\n\nBibliography Oral history Recorded history Photos YOUR page External links Walking Tour"
