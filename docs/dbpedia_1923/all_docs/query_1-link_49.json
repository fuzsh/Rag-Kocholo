Their story is told in the motion picture Fair Game. Â Â The Wilsons spoke at length about how the announcement in President George W. Bushâs state of the nation speech asserting Iraq was obtaining uranium from Africa for weapons of mass destruction was used to sell the Iraqi war to the American people. Â Â âA foolâs errandâ, said Wilson, resulting in 4,000 Americans being killed and 10,000 injured or traumatized to date. He criticized the Washington media for not demanding more answers.Â He spoke out because he believes it is the right of the American people to know the truth and to demand it from its government.
