        "text": "In 2024, we will commemorate the 80th anniversary of D-Day, the name given to the June 6, 1944, invasion of the beaches at Normandy in northern France by troops from the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and other countries during World War II. France at the time was occupied by the armies of Nazi Germany, and the amphibious assault—codenamed Operation Overlord—landed some 156,000 Allied soldiers on the beaches of Normandy by the end of the day. Despite their success, some 4,000 Allied troops were killed by German soldiers defending the beaches.\n\nAt the time, the D-Day invasion was the largest naval, air and land operation in history, and within a few days about 326,000 troops, more than 50,000 vehicles and some 100,000 tons of equipment had landed. By August 1944, all of northern France had been liberated, and in spring of 1945 the Allies had defeated the Germans. Historians often refer to D-Day as the beginning of the end of World War II.\n\nOn this very exclusive voyage, we welcome aboard producers of the major PBS series on the histories of The Great War, World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War in honor of the anniversaries of these significant, 20th century world conflicts. Invited to speak on these great works are Emmy and Peabody Award-winning filmmaker Phil Bertelsen and WWII historian John C. McManus, the Curators’ Distinguished Professor of U.S. military history at the Missouri University of Science and Technology.\n\nAs one of the nation’s leading military historians, and the author of fifteen well received books on the topic, he is in frequent demand as a speaker and expert commentator. In addition to dozens of local and national radio programs. His current project is a major three volume history of the U.S. Army in the Pacific/Asia theater during World War II. He is the host of two podcasts, Someone Talked! in tandem with the National D-Day Memorial, and We Have Ways of Making You Talk in the USA alongside Al Murray and James Holland.\n\nMcManus is a native of St. Louis. He attended the University of Missouri and earned a degree in sports journalism. After a brief stint in advertising and sports broadcasting, he embarked on a literary and academic career. He earned an M.A. in American history from the University of Missouri and a Ph.D in American history and military history from the University of Tennessee. He participated in the University of Tennessee’s Normandy Scholars program and, in the process, had an opportunity to study the battle first hand at the Normandy battlefields.\n\nAt Tennessee he served as Assistant Director of the Center for the Study of War and Society, where he helped oversee a major effort to collect the first hand stories of American veterans of World War II. Making extensive use of this material, as well as sources from many other archives, he published two important books, The Deadly Brotherhood: The American Combat Soldier in World War II in 1998, and Deadly Sky: The American Combat Airman in World War II in 2000.\n\nShortly after the publication of Deadly Sky he accepted a position as Assistant Professor of U.S. Military History at the Missouri University of Science and Technology. In 2004 he published a two volume series on the American role in the Battle of Normandy. The first book, The Americans at D-Day: The American Experience at the Normandy Invasion was released in June 2004. The second book, The Americans at Normandy: The Summer of 1944, the American War from the Beaches to Falaise was published in November 2004. In 2007-2008 he published four new books. Alamo in the Ardennes: The Untold Story of the American Soldiers who made the Defense of Bastogne Possible (John Wiley and Sons, March 2007) is a fast paced, graphic history of the desperate race for the key town of Bastogne in the early days of the Battle of the Bulge. He has since published three more highly acclaimed books: September Hope: The American Side of a Bridge Too Far; The Dead and Those About to Die, D-Day: The Big Red One at Omaha Beach; and Hell Before Their Very Eyes: American Soldiers Liberate Concentration Camps in Germany, April 1945.\n\nBertelsen is currently directing “Black Patriots: The 761st Battalion,” a two hour documentary that tells the story of the first Black armoured division to engage in combat in US military history. They served in the European theater during World War II, fighting battles in six European countries in six months. The film, produced by Morgan Freeman, explores the two major battles they faced – the expansion of Nazism in Europe and racism, oppression, and inequality at home. It will feature Freeman interviewing one of the last surviving members of the 761st, as well as the current and first Black Secretary of Defense, Secretary Lloyd Austin, alongside new and archival interviews, period footage, still photographs and new commentary and stories from family and relatives of the Black Panther soldiers.\n\nBertelsen has screened his work at prestigious global competitions, including the Sundance Film Festival, Rotterdam International Film Festival, and the London International Film Festival. In addition, he has won a Student Academy Award as well as awards from Director’s Guild,The Tribeca Film Festival, and Urban World Film Festival. And he has received grants from organizations that include The Ford Foundation, New York State Council on the Arts (NYSCA), Black Public Media, the Independent Television Service (ITVS), and the Paul Robeson Fund.\n\nBertelsen holds an MFA in Film and TV from New York University where he was a Spike Lee Fellow. He has a BA in Political Science and Journalism from Rutgers University and is a member in good standing in both the Writers and Directors Guild."
