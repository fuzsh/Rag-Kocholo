        "text": "Depart the US, Paris Arrival, & Transfer to the S.S. Joie De Vivre\n\nDepart the US on October 28 and arrive at Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport on October 29. Guests are warmly welcomed and transferred to S.S. Joie de Vivre. Early morning arrivals may choose to enjoy a morning exploring Paris independently after dropping luggage at the ship or may board the vessel and enjoy the ship’s public areas* before settling into a luxurious stateroom or suite this afternoon. This evening, bid farewell to the “City of Light” during a welcome reception and dinner on the Seine River.\n\nAccommodations: S.S. Joie de Vivre (R, D)*\n\n*Light lunch available on S.S. Joie de Vivre from 12:00pm–2:00pm for those arriving in the morning.\n\nLa Roche-Guyon & Les Andelys\n\nThis morning, arrive at La Roche-Guyon, the famous 12th century château on the Seine, where Field Marshal Erwin Rommel had his headquarters. At La Roche-Guyon, “The Desert Fox” planned and prepared the tough defenses that the Allies encountered on D-Day, as well as the German movements during the campaign that followed. After lunch onboard the ship, dock at Les Andelys and visit Château Gaillard—Richard the Lionheart’s 12th century stronghold—offering inspiring views of the Seine River.\n\nAccommodations: S.S. Joie de Vivre (B, L, R, D)\n\nVersailles or Auvers-sur-Oise\n\nThis morning, dock in Mantes-la-Jolie, gateway to both the city of Versailles and the commune of Auvers-sur-Oise. At the end of World War I, the world’s statesmen gathered at The Palace of Versailles to sign the ill-fated peace treaty ending “The Great War.” The defeated Germans ultimately rejected the harsh provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, setting the stage for another world war just two decades later. Visit the famous Galerie des Glaces (Hall of Mirrors), the actual site of the treaty signing. Also included is an exclusive tour of the royal apartments, which still look much as they did when Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette fled before an outraged mob in 1789. Alternatively, for those that may have visited Versailles on prior trips, there is the option to tour Auvers-sur-Oise, where Vincent van Gogh spent the last days of his life and where he is buried. While in the village, a visit to Château d’Auvers-sur-Oise offers a look at various Impressionist artists who visited this area, or you may spend free time exploring independently.\n\nAccommodations: S.S. Joie de Vivre (B, L, R, D)\n\nRouen & Dieppe\n\nOn the northern coast of France lies the fishing community of Dieppe.It was here in August 1942, that the ill-fated raid by mostly Canadian forces would offer invaluable lessons for D-Day nearly two years later. Marvel at the smooth pebbles that make up the beach and imagine the difficulty of landing and running while under fire. The boardwalk behind the beach contains tributes to the men who came ashore in hopes of liberating the town, and a keen eye will be able to spot the German emplacements on the cliff s above Dieppe. After free time for lunch, explore this charming seaside town then return to Rouen. Described by Victor Hugo as “the city with a hundred bell towers,” and the scene of the Eighth Air Force’s first bombing mission over Europe in 1942, take part in a walking tour of the town center or return to the ship to relax before dinner this evening.\n\nAccommodations: S.S. Joie de Vivre (B, R, D)\n\nDisembarkation / Bayeux\n\nDisembark from the S.S. Joie de Vivre and depart for the picturesque town of Bayeux. Upon arrival, enjoy free time for lunch in one Bayeux’s quaint cafés. This afternoon includes a viewing of the Bayeux Tapestry–a 230-foot-long embroidered chronicle of William the Conqueror’s cross-channel invasion of England in 1066. Continue to the medieval center of the town, the Bayeux Cathedral, where a guided tour brings to life the construction of the cathedral, from the crypt to the spires. This evening, settle into the Norman countryside at your luxury château.\n\nAccommodations: Château (B, R, D)\n\nBritish Sector\n\nThe first full day in Normandy begins where British airborne troops fired the first shots of the invasion at the crucial Pegasus Bridge. Landing their wooden gliders just yards from the bridge, the men of the British 6th Airborne Division surprised the defenders and scored D-Day’s first victory.\n\nThe tour then follows the coastal road past Sword, Juno, and Gold Beaches before arriving in Arromanches, known for the remains of an artificial “Mulberry Harbor”, constructed by the Allies after D-Day. Next is a trip to Longues-sur-Mer, the only German battery in Normandy with the original guns still in place.\n\nAccommodations: Château (B, D)\n\nUS Airborne: Sainte-Mère-Église & Utah Beach\n\nThis morning starts with an exclusive visit to Château de Bernaville, which served as the headquarters of a German General Wilhelm Falley. In the early morning hours of June 6th, US paratroopers ambushed and killed General Falley, making him the first German general killed in the Normandy campaign, while also disrupting the German defenses at a critical moment in the Allied landing. Next, visit the town of Sainte-Mère-Église, where paratroopers landed during the predawn hours of D-Day. Dropping into the town square, the men of the 82nd Airborne Division fought tenaciously against the German defenders for control of this vital crossroads. Tour highlights include a visit to Musée Airborne and to the church made famous in the film The Longest Day.\n\nThis afternoon, explore Utah Beach, one of two American beaches, with its broad vistas and four causeway exits through flooded fields. Hear the story of General Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., and visit the Utah Beach Museum, which features a restored B-26 Marauder and detailed recreations of the German beach defenses. End the touring day with a stop at Brécourt Manor, widely known as the scene of Major Dick Winter’s D-Day assault in the HBO mini-series Band of Brothers.\n\nAccommodations: Château (B, L, R, D)\n\nPointe du Hoc, Omaha Beach, & Normandy American Cemetery\n\nThe morning touring begins at Pointe du Hoc, where the 2nd Ranger Battalion landed at the base of a 100-foot cliff and scaled the vertical face in order to neutralize this heavily fortified German position. A visit to nearby “Bloody Omaha” honors the sacrifice on its sands, while a close-up view of the intricate German defense system at St. Laurent-sur-Mer and Vierville-sur-Mer gives a sense of the overwhelming odds those soldiers faced. The day concludes with a visit to the Normandy American Cemetery to pay respects to the 9,387 Americans buried in the ground they helped liberate. Enjoy a “Farewell to Normandy” dinner at the château this evening.\n\nAccommodations: Château (B, L, R, D)\n\nThe Liberation of Paris\n\nFeaturing WWII expert Michael Neiberg, PhD, our custom-curated post-tour in Paris focuses on the political tug-of-war inside France during its occupation. The Vichy regime under WWI hero Philippe Petain administered the southern portions of France, while the Germans occupied the northern half, including Paris. The Vichy government proved to be willing collaborators of the Nazis, administering pro-German policies and rounding up the Jewish population of France. In the northern section, a German occupation built the Atlantic Wall and gradually reduced freedoms throughout. On tour, guests first follow in the infamous footsteps of Hitler’s 1940 visit to Paris, visiting some of the sites that he admired during his victory tour in June 1940, including the Eiffel Tower, the Opera, and the Pantheon. The second day of touring visits the refurbished Liberation Museum, which tells the story of occupation, resistance, and liberation of the city. Continue along the Champs-Elysees, admiring the view of the Arc de Triomphe before visiting Les Invalides, where Napoleon is entombed. Afternoons are left free for you to dine at your favorite Parisian restaurants for lunch and to explore the City of Light on your own.\n\nAccommodations: Hotel du Louvre (3 Breakfasts, 1 Lunch, 1 Reception)"
