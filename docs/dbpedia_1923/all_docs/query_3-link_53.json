The south half is where site of the Southern Hotel now stands.\n\nSt. Louis as Seen from the Illinois Side, 1770.\n\nMap of St. Louis as Laid Out in 1764. This Map is copied from the original map drawn by Colonel AUGUSTE CHOUTEAU, who was at the founding of the city, in 1764, and first surveyed the land. The map was drawn in conformity to an order from the Department, at Washington.\n\nThis old map represents the town of St. Louis, nearly as it was laid out in 1764. Its breadth from the Mississippi, to the West, was to the line of the Rue de Grange (now Third street), and its length was some few blocks shorter than the map represents. The wall of fortifications was completed in 1780. The letters have the following significations:\n\nA THE TOWER\n\nB HALF MOONS\n\nC BASTIONS\n\nD GATES\n\nE GOVERNMENT HOUSE\n\nF THE CHURCH\n\nG THE MARKET\n\nH THE LITTLE RIVER\n\nI PRIVATE TRACTS OF LAND.\n\nThe names of the streets that were given at the laying out the town were MAIN STREET, CHURCH STREET, BARN STREET, NO MAIN STREET, SECOND STREET, THIRD STREET, RUNNING NORTH AND SOUTH.\n\nTOWER STREET, MARKET STREET, MISSOURI STREET, KICKAPOO STREET, NOW ARE WALNUT STREET, MARKET STREET, CHESNUT STREET, PINE STREET, RUNNING EAST AND WEST.\n\nThe roads leading from the gates were what are now known as Carondelet Avenue (then the well known Vide Poche Road); the Manchester Road, the St. Charles Road, with its branches; and a road which led towards were Bremen now is. What looks like blocks of wood represents fields in cultivation, and the dots show timber. The mark of the compass is only given for the purpose of guiding the reader as to the cardinal points. It must be borne in mind that in some of the localities the direction of the streets has been slightly altered, which may account for some apparent discrepancies which may appear to subsist between the map and the main narrative as the locality of the old fortifications.\n\nPlat of the Town, 1804. With location of all the houses (March 10, 1804) as shown by black dots.\n\nMap of St. Louis, 1892. The circles are a mile apart. The great bulk of the population now lies within the three mile circle, but the growth is towards the region of Forest Park. Nearly all the streets shown are Boulevards. City embraces 61.37 square miles or 39,276 acres. Seventeen miles from north to south, and 6.62 from river to western limits, and has 19.15 river frontage.\n\n1 CARONDELET PARK\n\n2 LACLEDE PARK\n\n3 GRAVOIS PARK\n\n4 BENTON PARK\n\n5 LYON PARK\n\n6 COMPTON HILL RESERVOIR\n\n7 LAFAYETTE PARK\n\n8 NEW UNION DEPOT\n\n9 NEW CITY HALL\n\n10 GAMBLE PARK\n\n11 CARR SQUARE\n\n12 JACKSON PLACE\n\n13 HYDE PARK\n\n14 ST.

Her Prosperity, Advantages and Prospects.\n\nThe City embraces 61.37 square miles, or 30,276 1/2 acres. It is seventeen miles in length from north to south, and 6.62 miles from the river to its western limits, and has 19.15 miles of river frontage. It is the fifth city in size, the fourth in commerce, and has a population of 550,000. It is called the Mound City.\n\nSt. Louis is an independent city, being in no county, free from county legislation, and is governed under a scheme and charter which prohibits any floating indebtedness, and limits the rate of taxation, which is being gradually diminished. Tax rate is about 2.17. It is next to the healthiest city in the United States. The death rate averages about 21 per 1,000 per annum. It is the center of the Mississippi Valley, embracing 15,000 square miles of navigable rivers and about 25,000 miles of railroads, and leads the world in a dozen different lines of business and manufacturies.\n\nELEVATION.\n\nCity Directrix, upon which elevations are based, is the top of a square flat stone set level with the curb on the west side of the wharf between Market and Walnut streets 0.00 (being the high water mark of the year 1826.)\n\nIt is situated as to natural advantages more favorably than any other city on the continent. The Missouri River flows into the Mississippi twenty-one miles above the city, and the junction of the Illinois River is only twenty-four miles above St. Louis. It is in the heart of the food producing regions of the continent, and is central to boundless wealth of minerals. Around it are vast supplies of\n\n10\n\ncoal, iron, granite, building stone, and earths adapted to the manufacturies of glass. Productive lead mines are in the vicinity, and seek St. Louis as a point of manufacture and distribution.\n\nThe city has grown from small beginnings to gigantic proportions, and is to-day one of the greatest, wealthiest and most prosperous in the country, and every day of her existence proves herself more and more entitled to her proud position as the undisputed metropolis of the Mississippi Valley.\n\nIt is admirably situated for the prosecution of all departments of manufactures. In close proximity to abound-less store of all the useful metals, with vast supplies of coal almost at her gates, it is the cheapest coal market in the World, the cost to manufacturers being only $1.12 per ton. With a boundless profusion of food products at hand, for the sustenance of any possible increase of population, and with a market comprising the entire Mississippi Valley and the Great West, it is at once a most inviting city. Its manufacturing output for the last ten years shows a greater increase than any other city in America.\n\nTHE JOBBING TRADES.\n\nSt. Louis has the largest brewery, the largest tobacco factory, the largest drug house, handles more boots and shoes, has the largest hardware, woodenware, and the largest horse and mule market in the world, and is one of the greatest grain, flour and hay markets.\n\nThe importance of St. Louis as a central source of supply for the Mississippi Valley and the West is shown in an immense volume of transaction in all jobbing lines. St. Louis offers to the country merchant inducements for trade which are not excelled in any department in any city on the continent, and in many lines positively superior to any market in the land. It is not only a mart, it is a vast and busy workshop; each succeeding year records an\n\n12\n\nincrease in its mills, its forges and factories. The products of industry are not only bought, sold and handled in the city, they are made here. Every description of raw material for any line of manufactory which is to be found in North America can be produced in abundance within easy reach of St. Louis. CHURCHES.\n\nFine church edifices abound. All shades of belief being sheltered in elegant structures, which add greatly to the architectural attractions of the city.\n\nPUBLIC BUILDINGS.\n\nSt. Louis has a large number of fine public buildings. She erected more buildings in 1891 than any other city on the continent, and offers the safest and best investment to be found in any other large city in the world. Among the fine buildings are the Custom House and Post-Office, built at an expense of $6,000,000, and is one of the finest public buildings in the country. The Armory, Four Courts, Court House, Exposition, and under construction the new \"City Hall,\" and one of the finest Railroad Depots in the world, to cost $1,000,000, are some of the fine structures.\n\nST. LOUIS PRESS.\n\nThe newspapers of St. Louis are fully up to the highest standard of Journalism. The press of the city has exercised a great influence in promoting its interest in every useful direction, and in aiding its progress towards the advanced position it holds among the great cities of the country. The leading dailies are the Globe-Democrat, the St. Louis Republic, Post-Dispatch, Star Sayings and Evening Chronicle, published in the English language.

The public schools are conducted upon the most approved principles of teaching, while the high school offers to the ambitious youth the opportunity for securing instruction in the higher branches of knowledge. In addition to the public schools are the Universities, Colleges, Academies and Parochial Schools. There are 106 public schools, 1,254 school teachers, with an enrollment of 59,700 public school children.\n\nSOCIAL LIFE.\n\nIn social life there is every means provided for the pursuit of instruction or pleasure. There are many organizations devoted to social intercourse, to art, to music, to literature and to the various objects which indicate the intelligence and enlightenment of the people.\n\nSt. Louis is a live, vigorous and progressive modern city, endowed with many natural advantages, to which are added all the improvements which art or science has discovered to aid progress in business, in social life and in the pursuit of happiness. Her public museums, libraries and the numerous fine collections of paintings and works of art of her private citizens show the refinement of her people.\n\nSt. Louis has for many years been famous for its Annual Fair, for its Exposition, for its brilliant street illuminations, and for its magnificent Veiled Prophet parade. These attractions have drawn hundreds of thousands of people to visit it every fall, and its progressive citizens have decided for 1892-3 to eclipse every former effort in the annual festivities, and will illuminate the streets with electricity and miles of gas lit arches and pyramids.\n\n16\n\nChronological and Historical Events.\n\n1762.
