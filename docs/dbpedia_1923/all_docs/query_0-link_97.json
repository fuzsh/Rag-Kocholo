Duffey\n\nEmail: Abbirene@aol.com\n\nSnailMail: 245 Orville St. Fairborn, OH. 45324\n\nDate: 17 May 2000\n\nI am descended from the original Duffey family from Adams County, OH. I too have ancestors buried at Cherry Fork, and Tranquility. I noticed that you make reference, several times to some of them. The original Duffey (Michael) came over from Londonderry, Ireland with his buddy, Thomas Ramsey (1759). They both fought in the American Revolution (probably beside your McManis Family). I made a trip (I call it a pilgrimage) to Adams County a couple of years ago for the first time. It was totally fascinating to see some of my people buried there. I had gone for years not knowing the history of my family. It's too bad that my father (Denver H. Duffey) died before I could take him down. My children will know all about me and their Duffey roots. I actually wrote my memoirs (mainly for them). It is entitled, \"The Pipes Are Calling\". I'm sure that the McManis's and Duffey's were very good friends.\n\nName: Mary Irene (McCanis) Whitt\n\nEmail: maryw43011@yahoo.com\n\nSnailMail: PO Box 363, Centerburg, Ohio 43011\n\nDate: 25 May 2000\n\nNatalie, hello again, well my family tree is really growing thanks to you and many others.

I'm Denis McManus, and I live (was born and should eventually die in) Ireland. I had a quick lookie through the site and didn't see anything about the family ancestry before you hit America. I was wondering if you have done any research into this, and if so, well, what? Great site, otherwise. Interesting in the extreme.\n\nName: Vincent Edward Summers\n\nEmail: vsummers@nrao.edu\n\nDate: 01 Dec 2000\n\nI am glad to provide a happy conclusion to my McManus search... Here is what I can say, and what I can offer: I have found my Frank McManus, and his first wife, and photos of him with both wives and other family members. I know where he was born, a bit of his ancestry, and where he is buried, etc. So I now have what I sought. I am willing to share what I have. If anyone finds they have additional bits for me, so much the better! Contact me if you want any of what I have by way of data or photos.
