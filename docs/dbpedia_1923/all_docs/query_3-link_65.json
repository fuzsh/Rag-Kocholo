        "text": "Chuck's Chompers\n\nAtticus Edge, Ben Haukap, Alfonso Morales, Maksim Juric, Gavin Ryan, Shayne Murphy, Michael Davies, Shiyan Nejat\n\nYour print failed, and once again all of the filament you purchased has gone to waste. What should you do? Typically, many individual users of 3D printers are forced to buy more filament or send their failed prints off to larger recycling companies, as traditional desk size recycling systems range from $6,000 - $18,000.\n\nChuck’s Chompers decided that we wanted to find a way to design an affordable recycling system to safely recycle used filament and failed prints. Hence, the goal of our project (R3fil) is to design an automated machine that will perform grinding, heating, extrusion, and automatic spooling to recycle 3D filament while also being small enough to be used in an individual setting.\n\nView this poster project\n\nExhibit #7\n\nEnergy STL\n\nKevin Noonan\n\nThe assessment of energy efficiency and availability in the city of Saint Louis and the metro area. We will be using exergy as our key analytical tool. Using exergy analysis provides a unique perspective by evaluating the quantity and also the quality of energy.\n\nView this poster project\n\nExhibit #12\n\nLegUp\n\nArmando Alvarado, Katrina Esswein, Regan Ford, Rob Guetterman, Jake Little, Sophie Maloney, Logan Radick\n\nLegUp aims to be an assistive device for individuals with a temporary foot or ankle injury. Current market options are typically uncomfortable and inconvenient and make the recovery process difficult. Our project is a hands-free device that is supportive and stable for a range of users and will allow them to walk with a more usual motion.\n\nView this poster project\n\nExhibit #13\n\nNatural Language Control for a Robotic Arm\n\nLucy Billadeau, Pascal Sikorski, Kaleb Yu\n\nIn this project, we introduce an approach for controlling robotic arms through natural spoken language. Unlike traditional methods that rely on a predefined set of explicit commands, our system is designed to interpret the user's intent. By leveraging Large Language Models, the system is able to process human speech and draw upon the appropriate robot action. This advances verbal control of the robotic arm such that it will be able to execute tasks with precision and flexibility given complex verbal instructions.\n\nExhibit #27\n\nProject MAAV-eRIC: Maneuverable Autonomous Aerial Vehicle enabling Research in Intelligent Controls\n\nConnor Fadden, Joshua Nguyen, Jacob Stukas, Xavier Torres Arpi\n\nOur mission is to design, build, and flight test a single engine, twin tail, radio controlled, test bed capable of acrobatic maneuvers for control system research purposes. MAAV-eRIC is a senior design team at Saint Louis University that is currently developing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a future testbed platform for the AirCRAFT Lab under the supervision of Dr. Srikanth Gururajan. Dr. Gururajan and the AirCRAFT desire a maneuverable aircraft that can be used to study control algorithms and the dynamics of an aircraft performing a variety of maneuvers. The aircraft will be a twin-tailed single turbine powered platform with a multitude of data collection equipment. The customer calls for reliable aircraft meant to be repetitively flight tested and gather as much data as possible. Once built MAAV-eRIC will be used for years into the future to facilitate research and learning in the Saint Louis University School of Science and Engineering AirCRAFT Lab.\n\nView this poster project\n\nExhibit #8\n\nProject RADARS (Rocket Altitude Determination and Response System)\n\nColin Cummins, Tim Drake, Matthew Muetzel, Mary Otten\n\nEvery year, collegiate rocketry propulsion teams participate in nationwide competitions, such as, the Spaceport America Cup and NASA Student Launch. These competitions have various altitude requirements that the student-designed and built rockets must reach, in order to qualify. Teams will often use solid rocket motors for these competitions, which are not controllable once launched. However, this is where issues may arise, due to the various motor and atmospheric differences between initial testing and the competition launch. Project RADARS, Rocket Altitude Determination and Response System, aims to resolve this problem by integrating a dynamic altitude control system onboard the rocket. The system is a minor air braking mechanism that will autonomously extend or pull back flaps, either increasing or decreasing the drag and thus controlling the altitude.\n\nExhibit #6\n\nRAPTOR\n\nLesly Aguilar, Sarah Brzezinski, Michael Dompke, Justin Ndacaisaba, Will Ryan, Andrew Stack\n\nRAPTOR, developed by MechFly, is a cutting-edge project aimed at excelling in the ASME IAM3D Unmanned Aerial Racing Cargo Vehicle (U.A.R.C.V.) competition. This competition challenges university students to harness additive manufacturing and iterative design techniques to craft an unmanned aerial racing vehicle capable of efficiently handling cargo. The mission? Pick up and deliver payloads in a thrilling racing environment. With up to five drones racing simultaneously, RAPTOR aims to showcase agility, speed, and precision as it navigates the course, demonstrating its capability to swiftly pick up, travel with, and drop off multiple payloads from designated areas. Through meticulous design processes and detailed documentation, MechFly endeavors to stand out in both performance and innovation in this exhilarating competition.\n\nView this poster project\n\nExhibit #5\n\nRAPTOR\n\nCarlos Torelli, Jerome Quebbeman, Michael Maxwell, Hogan Jones, Pablo Izquierdo\n\nThe RAPTOR mission aims to rapidly deploy a 12U CubeSat from an F-15E aircraft with less than 24 hours' notice, addressing gaps in space-based PNT, communications, and ISR systems. This initiative enhances space-based services for special operations, increasing military agility and effectiveness. The mission involves receiving a request, constructing and attaching the payload to RAPTOR, deploying it from the F-15E at 40,000 feet, and executing an organized payload deployment and potential recovery.\n\nExhibit #4\n\nSelf-Launch Sailplane Utilizing Electric Driven Propulsion\n\nSpencer Cochran, Sophia Collins, Amanda Kohne, Isabel Korzilius, and Camilyn Newbanks\n\nSailplanes, also known as gliders, are aircraft with no propulsion system. This project utilizes a self-launching propulsion system which are often powered by small jets, pistons, rotary or electric engines. The project requirements for an electric powered self-launching aircraft are broken into the subcategories of performance, design, manufacturing, and operation. The requirements for this design were selected from the 2023-2024 AIAA Electric Training Sailplane RFP, but not all requirements from the RFP will be applied. The design of this electric sailplane will be made up of two phases. The first phase includes the design and computations for a full-scale theoretical model. The theoretical model, with its 20 meter wingspan, will utilize computer modeling and ANSYS Fluent simulations to verify the aircraft’s performance. The second phase consists of the design, construction and flight of a test flight model. This flight model will be constructed as a scaled version, 4 meter wingspan, of the theoretical model to test the model’s configuration with a retractable propulsion system.\n\nExhibit #10\n\nTeam Oliver Design Build Fly\n\nLuke Giunta, Antonio Hamilton, James Kramer, Peter Trainor\n\nThe mission of Team Oliver is to design, build, and fly a compact aircraft that is fully compliant with all AIAA requirements set out in the 2024 AIAA Design Build Fly competition. The aircraft shall be designed utilizing the optimized scoring equation variables from Missions 2 and 3 and configured to be repurposed for the three outlined urban missions. The team goal is to complete a moderate risk development effort, submit a design report, and fly the completed aircraft at the April 2024 DBF competition in Wichita, KS.\n\nTeam Oliver has completed 2 of their 3 planned plane models and successfully flew their first plane, without crashing, on December 9th, 2023. They are in the process of building their next version which has a predicted dry weight reduction of 30%, enabling an increase in payload by 2458.47 grams and a more longitudinally and laterally stable aircraft that its previous iteration.\n\nView this poster project\n\nExhibit #9\n\nThe Belly: Long Range Cargo Aircraft\n\nCordan Hampton, Robert Immekus, Tavin Matiszik Endrit Mehmetaj\n\nThe Belly is a conceptual design for a modern cargo aircraft to be used by the United States Air Force. The project was presented to the team with the goal of creating a long range aircraft capable taking off and landing on short runways. The aircraft is designed to be flown autonomously and carry a payload of a single standardized 463L pallet.\n\nView this poster project\n\nExhibit #11\n\nDextraGrip\n\nGrace Almgren, Abby Kieffer, Ryan Mueller, Angie Romanelli\n\nOur project is a rehabilitation tool to assist patients suffering from brain or stroke-related paralysis via hemiparesis. The device aims to provide functionality via an external mobilization of the hand through an EMG-motorized orthosis system that allows for dual mode for opening and closing of the hand. Additionally, there is an integrated sensory feedback system that allows the user to modulate the amount of pressure applied when attempting to perform certain functions, such as picking up a soda can.\n\nExhibit #67\n\nFluidix - Lymphedema Treatment Device\n\nJulia Brockhouse, Ether Dharmesh, Ryan Hilty, Jessica Robinson, Saloni Shringarpure\n\nEach year, 1 in 1000 Americans suffer from lymphedema, a build-up of lymph fluid in the fatty tissues under the skin causing swelling and discomfort. Lymphedema pump devices have been proven to reduce swelling through at-home usage, but they do not match the superior effectiveness of lymphatic massages delivered by physical therapists. Such suboptimal efficiency extends the time patients spend in each pump treatment session, and this inactivity worsens lymphedema. Here, we have developed a pneumatic pump device to push fluid back into lymphatic vessels through sequential pumping from foot to groin, with segmented bladders that inflate from the back to the front of the leg to emulate a physical therapy massage. Pressure sensors embedded in the sleeve of the device allow precise measurement of the applied pressure and adjustment of the degree of inflation. This design is simultaneously adjustable and effective, allowing for patient-directed treatment without compromise of quality.\n\nExhibit #71\n\n--\n\nMIHeight\n\nAbigail Bremseth, Amanda Deja, Joshua Nuka, Raina Panicker\n\nMIHealth revolutionizes self-awareness and healthcare through innovative reflection. MIHealth is a smart mirror that can determine a user's height, weight, and temperature. It utilizes sensors all around the mirror's frame to accurately determine the user's data and display the results on a LCD screen hidden behind the frame.\n\nExhibit #74\n\nMindTrack - Cognitive Change App\n\nLexxy Ahn, Ben Schneider, Ben Sloan\n\nAt MindTrack, we are on a mission to empower individuals through proactive testing for early detection of cognitive decline and to provide peace of mind to the aging and their loved ones. Our app provides interactive screening exercises, personalized content, and intuitive incident tracking to offer a holistic approach to cognitive health. We believe in prolonging quality of life through evidence-based progress tracking that enhances cognitive resilience. Join us in redefining cognitive care—because a sharp mind is a lifetime asset.\n\nExhibit #69\n\nOptimization of Electrospraying for the Creation of Large Diameter Microsphere for Vessel Occlusion\n\nRose Viguerie\n\nThis project aims to optimize the creation of PEG microspheres via electrospraying for use in several applications, one being vessel occlusion at the site where they are injected. The primary variable tested, the needle gauge, will be varied to obtain microspheres in a range of 100μm to 500μm while having a coefficient of variance lower than 20% (ideally around 10%). If time permits, further variable analysis will be performed (such as considering varying the voltage between the needle tip and the oil bath). After the microspheres’ physical parameters have been tweaked to fit the requirements, injection testing will be performed. The microspheres must be able to be injected via an insulin needle without aggregation occurring (this would interfere with the process of injection). The data gathered in this experiment will serve as a guideline for further electrospraying research by providing expected values for diameter.\n\nExhibit #66\n\nPiezoelectric Hydrogels\n\nJames Baker\n\nBiocompatible piezoelectric materials are a growing area of interest for biomedical engineering researchers for their potential rehabilitative and regenerative properties for electrically excitable cells. By further developing these materials, it may be possible to use them to better address issues such as volumetric muscle loss and nerve damage. For researchers to produce these piezoelectric devices, they must be able to robustly validate these materials as reliable forms of treatment. To accomplish this, researchers need systems that can measure the electrical properties of materials created in the laboratory before moving to clinical settings. Researchers often run into the problem that systems used for detecting\n\nsmall currents produced by these materials are too expensive or too big for practical use. This project demonstrates the successful synthesis of Poly(vinylidene fluoride)-poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels and proposes a low cost, portable design for a device to measure electric currents produced by piezoelectric hydrogels.\n\nView this poster project\n\nExhibit #65\n\nRobotic Prosthetic Hand\n\nTalon Krieger, John Melulis, Gerard Peña, Natalie Phelps, Katie Woehlert\n\nThe Robotic Prosthetic Hand project features the design and manufacturing of a myoelectric hand prosthetic focused on closely mimickin\n\ng the form and functionality of lost upper extremity limbs for transradial amputations. The prosthetic features a full hand, which attaches to the amputee's prosthetic socket, with independently actuated fingers. Finger actuation includes an electromyogram (EMG) sensor on the residuum limb that measures muscular activity to use as an input to trigger the intended physical responses of the prosthetic hand through embedded microprocessors and servo motors.\n\nExhibit #70\n\nShear Wave Tensiometer for Achilles Load Measurement in Animal Models\n\nPatrick Hinkle\n\nShear wave tensiometry is a recently developed technique to directly measure in-vivo muscle-tendon loading in humans noninvasively by tracking the velocity of propagating\n\nshear wave vibrations within a tendon to evaluate muscle-tendon loading. Though a proven technique in quantifying muscle-tendon loading in humans, shear wave tensiometry has not been scaled for use in animal models. A rodent animal model is an ideal platform for developing a shear wave tensiometer, but there are many challenges due to the size constraints of a rodent Achilles tendon. By mounting sensors to measurement probes in a free-floating support structure above the animal, the size constraints can be mitigated. The successful development of the device will allow future studies on changes in in vivo muscle function due to injury and potential treatment protocols for these injuries.\n\nView this poster project\n\nExhibit #75\n\nSmartCane Technology\n\nRobert Bucks, Megan Chermack, Owen Miller, Jonel Olar, Cati Welby\n\nSmart Cane aims to satisfy our goals of increasing both safety and independence for the large percentage of the population that rely on the use of canes for walking assistance. With this device, injuries can be prevented, and help will be alerted in the event of a fall. Our design utilizes Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), which have the ability to track velocities and accelerations using the combination of a built-in accelerometer and gyroscope on a three-axis coordinate system. The IMU works hand-in-hand with a SMS radio to allow for SMS text messages to be sent from the cane directly to any cellular phone. With the combination of an IMU and SMS radio, the cane is capable of accurately sensing when a fall occurs and sending an immediate text message to a pre-selected emergency contact.\n\nExhibit #72\n\nSmartWeight System\n\nDimitri Loli, Caroline Murphy, Almar Myrtaj, Sam Silva\n\nGeriatric patients can face generalized weakness and muscle wasting. In order to combat these conditions, we developed an exercise prescription measuring device to help older adults. It can measure patient repetitions, average speed of motion, and workout time for a simple sit-to-stand variation of the well-known squat exercise. These data points are transferred to an Android application from our sensor over Bluetooth. From there, workout information can be sent to a database for physician or care practitioner use.\n\nView this poster project\n\nExhibit #73\n\n-------\n\nROB Project\n\nRobert McManus, Brandon Terselic, Noah Whetstone\n\nOur project's purpose is to inspire the next generation of engineers.

This project aims to improve the gaming experience by eliminating manual scoring, giving players a seamless and automated scoring process. The cornhole boards are equipped with several antennas that read chips that are embedded in each of the cornhole bags. As the cornhole bag is thrown onto the boards, the RFID technology will be received and will accurately record the score following the throw of the final black cornhole bag. This system will not only add a technological edge to the traditional game of cornhole, but also will introduce a more efficient and engaging way to play the popular recreational game.\n\nExhibit #76\n\nβ-mannosylation by hydrogen-bond-mediated aglycone delivery\n\nCece Fitz\n\nStereocontrolling the glycosylation reactions is a constant quest in the field of glycosciences, and often proves to be quite cumbersome. The hydrogen-bond-mediated aglycone delivery (HAD) method provides control of the stereoselectivity in the glycosylation of a variety of sugar substrates, allowing for the formation of difficult 1,2-cis glycosides. The HAD method relies on the formation of an intermolecular hydrogen bond between the nitrogen atom on the protecting group of the glycosyl donor with the hydroxyl group of the glycosyl acceptor. This interaction allows for a subsequent syn-attack by the approaching nucleophile, allowing to achieve a powerful stereocontrolling mode for the glycosidic bond formation. Reported herein is the synthesis of a novel mannosyl donor capable of HAD and its applications in glycosylation.\n\nView this poster project\n\nExhibit #46\n\n-----\n\nBrimstone Life\n\nRobert Mendoza\n\nThis project presents different internal standards in deuterated sulfuric acid as a solvent for reactions using NMR as a quantitative tool. Strong acids such as concentrated sulfuric acid is known as dehydrating agent, a strong oxidizing agent, and can destruct complex molecules. This project investigates the stability, reactivity, and solubility of internal standards in a sulfuric acid solvent system.\n\nExhibit #39\n\nCharacterization of Photoreactive Dibenzothiophene Sulfoximine Derivatives\n\nNicolas Keller\n\nThe Bolm-McCulla reaction describes a photolysis of dibenzothiophene sulfoximine which yields two reactive intermediates via S–N and S–O bond cleavage. Photocleavage of DBT sulfoximines releases a nitrene product followed by atomic oxygen [O(3P)] upon irradiation with UV-A light. Studies of O(3P) in solution have been hindered by the high energy photons needed to generate this intermediate from known methods. Additionally, previous work by the McCulla group has demonstrated that the rate of reactive atomic oxygen release may be altered by the electronic effects of substituent groups placed on DBTO. A water-soluble molecule 4,6-diacetoxymethyl DBT sulfoximine has been synthesized which may produce O(3P) and nitrene upon photolysis. Further investigation of this process can contribute to building a framework for the development of additional chromophores capable of releasing two distinct reactive intermediates in a specified order.\n\nExhibit #40\n\nChemical Synthesis Of 3-Fucosyllactose, An Iimportant Human Milk Oligosaccharide\n\nJoey Wise\n\nHuman milk oligosaccharides (HMO) are very important and the third most abundant constituent of human milk component after lactose and lipids. They are a structurally and biologically diverse class of glycans. Developing new methods for the chemical synthesis of HMO has been an active area of research. One way of synthesizing glycans in general and HMO in particular is application of thioglycoside building blocks. Many thioglycosides are known, and among these S-benzoxazolyl (SBox) found some application to the synthesis of various glycans. As a part of our ongoing efforts toward the development of novel methods for glycosylation and glycan synthesis, presented herein is our discovery that SBox donors are excellent substrates for the synthesis of HMO. That is because the SBox glycosides can be activated over other thioglycosides with excellent yield and stereoselectivity. The initial studies dedicated to the synthesis of simple glycosidic linkages and investigation of the reaction mechanism have now been extended to the streamlined synthesis of 3-fucosyllactose, a common HMO trisaccharide found in human milk.\n\nView this poster project\n\nExhibit #41\n\nCooperatively-Catalyzed Koenigs-Knorr Glycosylation for Complex Glycan Synthesis\n\nChau Ta\n\nReported herein is an expansion of a recent development in glycoscience, namely the formation of glycosidic linkages under cooperatively catalyzed Koenigs-Knorr reaction conditions, to glycan synthesis. Previously, cooperatively-catalyzed Koenigs-Knorr glycosylations was a multi-step procedure that relied on the formation of a glycosyl halide intermediate with interim drying and evaporation. The optimized glycosylation can now be achieved in a single step in the presence of molecular iodine, silver sulfate, and triflic acid. This methodology has been applied to the synthesis of a novel, complex trisaccharide in a 1 + 1 + 1 fashion. Our synthetic approach comprised alternating deprotection and glycosylation steps.\n\nView this poster project\n\nExhibit #42\n\nDetermining Bond Dissociation Enthalpies of Sulfoxides: What computational method best predicts experimental values?\n\nSydney Lahm\n\nComputational analysis was conducted to determine the bond dissociation enthalpies (BDE) of S=O bonds in eight molecules, which were subsequently compared to their experimentally derived BDEs. Computational BDE calculations were conducted utilizing various combinations of density functional theory (DFT) and basis sets. Specifically, DFT methods including M06-2X, mPW1LYP, ωB97X-D3, PBE0, and B3P86 were paired with basis sets def2-TZVP/J, def2-TZVP, aug-cc-pV(T+d)Z, 6-311++G(2df,2p), and def2-QZVP. The comparison between computational and experimental BDEs was evaluated through graphical representation, yielding slope and coefficient of determination (R2) metrics. Among the methods tested, mPW1LYP/aug-cc-pV(T+d)Z, PBE0/def2-TZVP, and B3P86/aug-cc-pV(T+d)Z performed best in terms of assessed metrics. Additionally, comparative analyses were expanded to include complete basis sets methods (CBS-QB3 and CBS-4m), which, exhibited comparatively lower accuracy in predicting experimentally calculated S=O BDEs compared to the combination methods.\n\nView this poster project\n\nExhibit #43\n\nExperimental Determination of Thermodynamic Parameters for Pseudouridine-Guanine Pairs in Duplexed RNA: Terminal Mismatches, Tandem Pairs, and Bulge Loops\n\nSebastian J Arteaga, Julia W Stone, Brent M Znosko\n\nPseudouridine (Ψ), an isomer of uridine where the nucleobase is attached to the C1 of the ribose sugar via C5 rather than the standard N1, results in an additional hydrogen bond donor which can increase the stability of RNA. Ψ has been found to affect tRNA, rRNA, and snRNA function. This project aims to investigate the thermodynamic parameters of G-Ψ pairs in various secondary structures to allow the incorporation of Ψ in secondary structure prediction algorithms. Data from optical melting experiments of selected oligonucleotides were analyzed to determine average ΔH˚ , ΔS˚ , ΔG˚ 37, and Tm for each and compared these to their canonical counterpart. As expected, the addition of Ψ has been found to be stabilizing to a degree proportional to the number of Ψ in each sequence. These thermodynamic parameters can be used to predict likely secondary structure of RNAs containing Ψ improving RNA technology design ability.\n\nView this poster project\n\nExhibit #44\n\nExploration of GPR183 Antagonist Derivatives for the Treatment of Neuropathic Pain\n\nOlivia Farris, Elise Stuertz, Ivy Yang\n\nNeuropathic pain presents multiple unique challenges for clinical treatment. Current treatment guidelines include prescription of tramadol, tapentadol, and other low-dose opioids. The efficacy of opioids for neuropathic pain has been called into question, along with obvious concerns regarding addiction and over-prescription. Alternatives to opioid-based treatments include neuromodulation, treatment with tricyclic antidepressants, and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake receptors (SNRIs). While these treatments show some clinical efficacy, the lack of knowledge of their mechanisms of action has slowed the development of potentially more efficacious treatments. Thus, elucidation of the pathways involved in neuropathic pain is essential for research into the next generation of neuropathic pain treatment. Transcriptomic screening revealed that upregulation of GPR183 is pronociceptive. Oxysterol, 7α,25-dihydroxycholesterol, an endogenous GPR183 ligand, produces such upregulation upon binding. A previously discovered inhibitor for GPR183 has been shown to reverse critical constriction injury (CCI)- induced neuropathic pain in mice. Taking advantage of the structure-activity relationship revealed by this research, selected cinnamic compounds are now being explored as part of GPR183 inhibitor derivatives that seek to produce increased bioavailability.\n\nView this poster project\n\nExhibit #38\n\nExploring reverse migration in 2D and 3D environments using subcellular optogenetics\n\nAditya Chandu, Ajith Karunarathne, Waruna Thotamune\n\nCell migration is essential to the dynamic processes throughout the body such as wound healing and embryonic development. Fluid viscosity, concentration gradients, flow rate, and the presence of other cells or compounds are external factors that alongside internal factors like expression of adhesion molecules, intracellular pathways, and membrane tension, affect the cellular movement. Current literature has established that GPCRs play a unique role in cellular migration. Using typically adhered cells seeded on glass-bottomed dishes, iso-dense layers of Ficoll400 to mimic the body’s 3D environment, and GPCRs coupled to light-sensitive GPCR agonists our aim is to unveil the cellular mechanisms behind reverse migration: migration away from stimuli. Advanced microscopic techniques, receptor or agonist photoactivation using confined light, and optogenetic techniques pave our way to exploring and comparing reverse migration to more conventional behavior. A deeper grasp of chemical-based reverse migration is crucial for better understanding important pathophysiological conditions, such as tumor metastasis and blood-brain barrier permeability.\n\nExhibit #45\n\nIdentification and Characterization of RNA Dinucleotide Bulge Sequence Families\n\nEsha Dani\n\nThe secondary structure of RNA, which forms from intramolecular base pairing, consists of structural motifs such as bulges, hairpin loops, internal loops, etc. RNA bulges occur when one or more extra nucleotides are found on one strand of a double helical region. Dinucleotide bulges are prevalent secondary structure motifs and serve important roles in biological processes. The RNA Characterization of Secondary Structure Motifs (CoSSMos) database was used to identify dinucleotide bulges in previously solved 3D structures. Python scripts and Dissecting the Spatial Structure of RNA (DSSR) were used to annotate and compare these dinucleotide bulges. Dinucleotide bulge sequence families, different dinucleotide sequences that adopt similar 3D structures, and their structural features are reported here. These families and features can be used to improve the prediction of RNA 3D structure.\n\nView this poster project\n\nExhibit #37\n\nIdentification and characterization of single nucleotide bulge loops in RNA\n\nDr. Jie Hou, Annie Jung, Dr. Brent Znosko\n\nDespite the presence of methods that accurately determine RNA structures, they demand significant time, financial resources, and effort, rendering them inefficient for promptly solving RNA sequences. An approach to address this issue involves the utilization of computer programming to predict RNA structures from their primary sequences. Correlations found between the primary and tertiary structures of previously solved sequences would be used to predict structures of unsolved RNA sequences. When identifying these patterns, particular emphasis is placed on the tertiary structures of secondary structural motifs. Among these motifs, the investigation of structural patterns specific to single nucleotide bulge loops has received relatively less attention. Single nucleotide bulges obtained from the RNA Characterization of Secondary Structure Motifs (CoSSMos) website were clustered and characterized using Root-Mean-Square Deviation (RMSD) and Dissecting Spatial Structure of RNA (DSSR), respectively. This resulted in the characterization of 18 clusters of single nucleotide bulges with unique traits.\n\nView this poster project\n\nExhibit #36\n\n-----------\n\nIsolation of DNA Aptamers That Bind Agarose Gel\n\nEmily Falk\n\nThis study employs SELEX to isolate DNA aptamers with a high affinity for agarose. Agarose's gel-forming ability makes it valuable for drug delivery and molecular immobilization, yet its utilization without chemical modifications remains a challenge. A randomized single-stranded DNA pool is introduced to agarose gel plugs under varied binding conditions. Unbound oligonucleotides are washed away, followed by recovery, then PCR amplification of the binding sequences. The resulting aptamers demonstrate enhanced binding activity, and the isolated aptamers are reintroduced into the agarose gel plugs. Each round of SELEX enriches the pool of aptamers for those with a higher affinity for agarose. Once the desired binding activity is achieved, the aptamer pools will be further characterized to understand their specificity, affinity, and potential applications. Agarose-binding aptamers promise diverse applications in biotechnology and medicine specifically in the delivery and release of therapeutic biomolecules.\n\nView this poster project\n\nExhibit #35\n\nLead (II) carbonate-alginate nanocomposite materials as contrast agents for fine vascular MicroCT imaging\n\nKyan Ho\n\nMy research focuses on the synthesis of an improved nanoparticle-containing composite gel for imaging the fine vasculature of biological systems using X-ray techniques. The composite is composed of nanoparticles containing a lead carbonate phase (LNPs) distributed in an alginate hydrogel to produce a nanocomposite that gels after perfusion into the fine vasculature. LNPs are produced by an arrested precipitation process with capping provided by tetraethylene glycol, which controls nanocrystal growth and confers water dispersibility to the system. The LNPs have controllable X-ray contrast by variation of their concentration within the composite structure. Preliminary data and testing using X-ray and micro-CT imaging demonstrates that the LNPs have excellent X-ray contrast comparable to or greater than that of bone. The characteristics of the developed nanocomposite gel were shown to be improved over that of commercially available Microfil and a previously reported barium sulfate nanocomposite with a similar structure.\n\nExhibit #34\n\nManual and automated chemical synthesis of protected gentiobiose.\n\nKevin burke\n\nAll glycans, both natural and synthetic, are connected via O-glycosidic linkages, but\n\nsynthesizing these linkages by chemical methods remains challenging. Many methods for\n\nchemical glycosylation have been introduced, but the complexity of the glycosylation reaction\n\ndemands further improvement (1). Reported herein is the synthesis of differently protected disaccharides. The conventional manual synthesis was then converted to the fully automated synthetic platform that is being developed in our laboratory. The automated approach helps to eliminate errors and improve reproducibility. Upon proper optimization of the reaction conditions, we achieved fully automated synthesis and purification of the target compounds\n\nView this poster project\n\nExhibit #33\n\nPhenothiazine Synthesis Through Electrochemical and Photochemical Decarboxylative Radical Coupling Reaction Development\n\nTravis LaPonsie\n\nPhenothiazine-based compounds are of interest in medicinal chemistry as both antifungals and for treating mental disorders. However, in some instances generating the phenothiazine core has proven difficult, with current synthetic pathways proving unreliable or not reproducible. Developing new and efficient reactions for phenothiazine generation could allow for synthesis of a wider variety of phenothiazine cores. The goals of this research project are to expand upon the traditional reaction schemes aimed at generating phenothiazines with the addition of either electrochemistry or photochemistry. This work explores routes to C-N bond formation to form phenothiazines via two methods. One direction involves the use of electrochemistry to assist catalyst turnover in poor-yielding Buchwald couplings. The other is the use of photochemistry and copper catalysis to induce decarboxylative C-N bond formation, a route that has not been explored in phenothiazine synthesis to date.\n\nView this poster project\n\nExhibit #32\n\nReactive Metal Nanoparticles for H2 Gas Generation and Solid-state Propellants\n\nSteven Buckner, Paul Jelliss, Elisabeth Johnston, Mohammad Kader, Calvin Nyapete, Gowtham Reddy, Maxwell Gao\n\nProduction of high energy density materials is an important research area with applications in many areas such as energy storage and delivery, chemical processing, and propellants. Reactive metal nanoparticles (RMNPs) are particularly useful as high energy density systems but reactivity challenges arise due to their inherent instability. We present two methods for the stabilization of RMNPs for specific applications in hydrogen production and in solid-state propellants. RMNPs were successfully passivated within the pores of metal organic frameworks (MOFs) and by capping with polyethylene. We hereby present results for RMNPs@MOF composites as hydrogen generators and polyethylene-capped RMNPs (PEN particles) as a rocket propellant material.\n\nView this poster project\n\nExhibit #31\n\nStructure activity relationships of core replacements in a phosphodiesterase inhibitor for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis\n\nCaroline Christ\n\nCryptosporidiosis is a diarrheal disease caused by the parasites C. parvum and C. hominis which can be life-threatening for children and immunocompromised patients. The only currently approved treatment for cryptosporidiosis, nitazoxanide, is only moderately effective in children and not effective in patients with immunodeficiencies. This study explores the role of core structure in the potency of a series of phosphodiesterase inhibitors in the Cryptosporidium parasites. By changing the heterocyclic core structure of the lead compound (“core-hopping”), the structure activity relationship can be determined and used to optimize the structure of the potential drug molecule. Inhibition of the Cryptosporidium parasites by the synthesized analogs indicates that the pyrazole core structure in lead compound SLU-2815 may not be essential for activity and could be equally or more efficacious with an alternate core.\n\nExhibit #30\n\nSynthesis and SAR Studies of the 3-position of SLU-10482 for the Identification of Novel Anti-Cryptosporidium Drug Analogues\n\nCaitlin Hamill\n\nCryptosporidiosis is a leading waterborne infection caused by the Cryptosporidium parasite that causes diarrhea, dehydration, and malnutrition. In severe cases, the parasitic infection can result in death, most notably in young children and immunocompromised patients. Nitazoxanide is the only FDA-approved treatment, but is only modestly effective, suggesting a critical need for a new anti-Cryptosporidium drug that effectively treats all patient populations. Previous work identified triazolopyridazine MMV665917 as an analogue, which has an EC50 of 2.1 µM. This finding led to the synthesis of SLU-10482, an analogue with an improved EC50 of 0.070 µM. The current work seeks to replace the 3-trifluoromethyl group on SLU-10482 and develop structure-activity relationships (SAR) in that position. Twenty-six novel analogues were synthesized and evaluated for potency against Cryptosporidiosis, with the most potent replacement to date being the propylene SLU-11358 analogue (EC50 = 0.56 µM).\n\nView this poster project\n\nExhibit #29\n\nSynthesis of a Novel Macromolecular Drug Delivery System Based on Cyclic Galactose\n\nAlexei Demchenko, Daniel Hoard, Anastasiia Vinogradskaia\n\nRecent studies have shown that cyclodextrins (CD), cyclic oligosaccharides composed of linked glucose units, exhibit anti-inflammatory activity. CD possesses a hydrophobic inner cavity capable of encapsulating cancer drugs, while their hydrophilic surface increases the drug’s solubility. However, while CDs show an increase in stability, solubility, and reduced toxicity, they still have limited therapeutic effects and can cause complications. The current goal in drug delivery system development is to efficiently deliver drugs to their target binding sites, protecting them from degradation and digestion, enhancing pharmacokinetics, and enabling the crossing of biological membranes without disruption. In this study, we present a new approach for the synthesis of cyclogalactin, a cyclic carbohydrate structure containing galactose units that shows promise for pharmaceutical applications. It possesses a similar structure to CD, but its hydrophobic site significantly extends. Currently, attempts to synthesize cyclogalactin have been unsuccessful. Reported herein is our attempt to create a 6-membered galactose.\n\nView this poster project\n\nExhibit #18\n\nSynthesis of Novel Efflux Pump Inhibitors in the Multidrug Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii\n\nMakaila Leask\n\nAcinetobacter baumannii is a multidrug resistant bacterium that is largely associated with hospital-acquired infections. Multidrug efflux pumps, belonging to the Resistance-Nodulation-Division (RND) superfamily, are the major mechanisms that contribute to antibiotic resistance in bacteria. The RND pumps AdeABC and AdeIJK are the efflux pumps of interest that are responsible for the drug resistance in A. baumannii. The development of efflux pump inhibitors for A. baumannii will allow for the potentiation of antibiotics. In this research, analogs of 4,6-diaminoquoniline and benzamidines had inhibitory activity against A. baumannii efflux pumps. The best analogs had target specificity, inhibited AdeIJK efflux, and potentiated antibiotics erythromycin and novobiocin.\n\nView this poster project\n\nExhibit #17\n\nAgrarium\n\nRyan Lamping, Grace Lin, Ana Belen Ortiz (Madrid Campus)\n\nAgrarium is a start-up multi-vendor digital marketplace for the purchase and sale of premium agricultural products, focused primarily in Ecuador.

We also aim to advocate for fair trade by eliminating intermediaries with unfair pricing, promoting transparency and ensuring higher-quality agricultural products. Through a transparent marketplace, we aspire to create a system that allows farmers to receive the true value of their products, and thus, promoting the production of higher-quality agriculture products as well. When farmers are supported, the entire food supply chain benefits.\n\nBubble Scan\n\nAhmet Ali Yildiz, Nischita Nannapaneni, Myles Correa\n\nCheminstry department at SLU uses paper scantron (fill in the bubble) sheets for exams. To grade the exams, they physically take the papers to one of the two machines on campus capable of processing this data. This process is time consuming and a bit risky - the machines are getting old and might break. In general, they like useing paper based fill in the bubble exams, but are interested in digitizing the grading process through software that presents them with detailed results, similar to the results they get from the physical scantron machines. The specific sheets used by the chemistry department are Scantron form number 95945. While not hugely expesive, not having to order such sheets is a cost saving. Most importantly, this software would replace the technology that's becoming obsolete and simplify the grading process.\n\nExhibit #48\n\nDatabase of Arithmetical Dynamical Systems\n\nAndrew Jelliss, Evan Richmond, Louis Rowles\n\nThe Database of Arithmetical Dynamical Systems is a research tool for a subset of mathematics that is implicated in almost every major scientific field.
