Jason Maxiell officially retires from the NBA

Jason Maxiell has officially retired as a member of the Detroit Pistons on Friday. Maxiell spent most of his NBA career with the Pistons while also playing in Orlando and Charlotte before playing overseas.

Maxiell was late first-round pick back in 2005 right after the Pistons won the NBA title. Maxiell was a solid big but never made much noise in fantasy circles.
