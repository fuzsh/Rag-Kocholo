        "text": "FOX19 - Jason Maxiell was affectionately known as \"Mad Max\" during his days as a basketball player at the University of Cincinnati.\n\nThat nickname was never more apparent than in a game Wednesday night in China. Maxiell is now out of the NBA and is currently playing for the Tianjin Gold Lions.\n\nThe YouTube video shows Maxiell, 32, getting shoved and possibly elbowed to the back of the head by the opposing team's center, Wu Ke. Mad Max took offense and off went Wu running down to the other end of the court.\n\nMaxiell followed.\n\nHe bulldozed through a ref and six to eight players until Michael Beasley was finally able to calm down the 2005 UC grad.\n\nMax finished 11th all-time on UC's career scoring list and second in career blocked shots. After graduating from UC, Maxiell played 10 seasons in the NBA.\n\nOn your mobile device? Click here.\n\nCopyright 2016 WXIX. All rights reserved."
