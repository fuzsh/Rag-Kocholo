        "text": "Former Detroit Pistons center Jason Maxiell revealed to a national television audience that he has slept with 341 women before and during his marriage to high school sweetheart Brandi Maxiell. This figure falls 19,659 shy of the number of women NBA legend and lifelong bachelor Wilt Chamberlain claimed to have bedded in his 1991 book “A View From Above,” but that was no consolation to Brandi.\n\nMaxiell’s wife walked off the set of the Oprah Winfrey Network’s “Iyanla: Fix My Life” when her husband revealed to host Iyanla Vanzant that he had slept with “more than 50” women in his life.\n\nHow Brandi Maxiell reacted to the show\n\nThe episode was filmed a year ago, according to a message she recently shared with The Shade Room:\n\n“Thank you all for the well wishes and prayers. Jason, Baby Jason and I needed that.\n\n“I would like to say I’m more frustrated with him blurting out a number to the world without no regard for my feelings. 8 put a damper on our relationship and I was willing to work on it. Over 50 tore it down!\n\n“My focus is and has been since we went on this show a year ago, is to shift my ENTIRE life from being a great wife and mother into being the best mother & person I can be! I’m aware that my son will someday come across this video and witness what the man of his life has done to his mother & how I stood by and basically did nothing. Therefore, I have to prepare myself for that conversation with him ‘without lies’ but with compassion for my son. I’m going to use very detail of my upbringing, my illness, my marriage, my life good or bad, to raise my child to learn how to first love & respect God, himself, women & all of God’s creations.”\n\nA former “Basketball Wives” cast member, Brandi overcame an ovarian cancer diagnosis in 2007.\n\nIyanla Vanzant’s advice to Jason Maxiell\n\nThe “Iyanla” episode also explores sex addiction and alcoholism, both of which Maxiell denied, and Vanzant offers sage advice about potential deeper-seated issues beneath the 35-year-old’s infidelity.\n\n“Every time you’re with another woman, you abandon you,” Vanzant told Maxiell on the episode that aired last week. “And every time you tell another lie, you abandon you. And every time you take a drink to stuff the pain down, you abandon you. This wasn’t about sex. This was about punishment.”\n\nWhat is Jason Maxiell doing these days?\n\nDetroit’s first-round pick in 2005, Maxiell played his first eight seasons for the Pistons before spending his final two NBA seasons in Orlando and Charlotte. After tours of of basketball duty in China and Turkey between 2015 and 2017, Maxiell played in the BIG3 league this summer. He signed a one-day contract with the Pistons in August 2017 to retire from the NBA with the team that drafted him.\n\n– – – – – – –\n\nBen Rohrbach is a writer for Yahoo Sports. Have a tip?
