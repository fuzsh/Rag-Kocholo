        "text": "Matt Williams\n\n@DraftExpress\n\nOverview: An undersized power forward that plays throwback Detroit Pistons basketball, and is starting to fulfill his potential. Very short by NBA standards, but possesses a huge wingspan, wide shoulders, and a strong frame. Has surprising quickness and leaping ability. Runs the floor very well. Asserts himself on the floor, and plays aggressive on both ends. Shows impressive toughness and durability. Was a monster during his senior year at Cincinnati. Has developed his game significantly since entering the League. Should be a long-term replacement for Antonio McDyess.\n\nOffense: One of the few players in the League who will really try to dunk everything when he sees a hole. Wont hesitate to go through defenders to get at the rim. Runs the floor extremely well. Able to achieve and maintain post position. Gets most of his offense off of post ups, cuts, and offensive rebounds. Very efficient scorer. Vastly improved midrange player. Pretty fluid jump shot. Likes to post on the left block and turn into right handed jumpers. Will face up and use jabs to create enough space to shoot his jumper. Shows good elevation. Uses his wingspan to shoot over defenders when he has them on their heels. Good post game. Not super advanced, but aggressive and efficient. Average hands. Goes to the line at a very high rate, but doesnt shoot a good percentage. Tremendous offensive rebounder. Wont put the ball on the floor to score.\n\nDefense: A solid post defender, although his size is a bit of a hindrance. Uses his strength to push his man off the block, box out, and not get pushed around. Surprising length helps him deny post entry passes, block shots, and rebound. Tends to surprise offensive players with his elevation and explosiveness. Blocks quite a few shots. Has a tough time defending taller big men who have good strength and soft touch near the basket. Does a great job defending the power forward spot. Quick enough to step out and guard midrange shooters. Rotates from the weak side pretty well. Will commit a few fouls a game on shooters near the basket. Feel for game is average. Very aggressive, but wont get fooled by fakes easily. Goes after every rebound. Very good post defender for his size and experience level.\n\nJonathan Givony\n\n@DraftExpress\n\nMatt Williams\n\n@DraftExpress\n\nOf all the players that participated in this years Summer League, it would be difficult to say that Jason Maxiell was not the most aggressive on the offensive end. Few players really try to dunk everything around the rim, but Maxiell comes very close to living that adage; attempting to punish the rim at every opportunity. Though he didnt finish all of his dunk attempts, he showed an admirable level of relentlessness that should serve him well this season in Detroit on the glass and in the paint.\n\nOutside of the dozen dunks he threw down, Maxiell showed impressive touch and improved footwork when working with his back to the basket. Maxiell has the quickness to get by his man when facing up, and used this to his advantage throughout the Summer League by using spin moves to create space for jump shots. Though he doesnt have a lot of trouble getting his shot off, Maxiell will need to continue improving his consistency, as his turnaround jumper is only efficient when he shoots it over his right shoulder. One of the most interesting developments that we saw out of Maxiell in Vegas was his midrange jumper. It is clear that Maxiell has taken a page from Antonio McDyess given the way he was shooting the ball. As Maxiell expands his range, he could become a very nice high post player in addition to providing a tough presence down low.\n\nAs Maxiell continues to develop his post game, it would be nice to see him add a hook shot of some kind, as he doesnt make as many moves going to the rim as he probably could. Maxiell showed in the playoffs that he can contribute right now, and should be given more of an opportunity to show his skills this year than he did last year. He provides a solid presence defensively, rebounds at a good clip, and works hard to make his presence felt. It wouldnt be surprising to see Maxiell begin to take some of McDyesss minutes as he begins to take a backseat to the up-and-coming power forward."
