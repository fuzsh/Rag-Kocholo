        "text": "Jason Maxiell will take his talents to the Orlando Magic next season, according to Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo! Sports. The undersized power forward will sign a deal worth $5 million over the next two seasons, but the second season is a team option for the Magic.\n\nMaxiell spent the first seven years of his career as a backup in Detroit, but he was promoted to the starting lineup for 71 of the team's 72 games he played in this past season. Maxiell's role likely would've been downsized again this season due to the pairing of Andre Drummond and Greg Monroe in the frontcourt, though, so it makes sense that he was ready to make a change.\n\nThe 30-year-old isn't built for the NBA as a 6'7, 260-pound big man, but he's been able to use his size and hustle to make a decent career for himself after being selected late in the first round of the 2005 NBA Draft. Maxiell averaged 6.9 points and 5.7 rebounds in 25 minutes per game for Detroit last year.\n\nMore from SB Nation:\n\n• J.R. Smith and another weird Knicks saga\n\n• Flannery: The Blazers’ quiet makeover\n\n• The rise of Jonas Valanciunas\n\n• Kent Bazemore, more than a hype man | Warriors committing to defense"
