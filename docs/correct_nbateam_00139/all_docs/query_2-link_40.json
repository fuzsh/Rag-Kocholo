        "text": "Congolese basketball player (born 1992)\n\nBismack Biyombo Sumba (born August 28, 1992) is a Congolese professional basketball player who last played for the Oklahoma City Thunder of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was selected with the seventh overall pick in the 2011 NBA draft by the Sacramento Kings and subsequently traded to the Charlotte Bobcats (now Hornets). Biyombo has also played for the Toronto Raptors, Orlando Magic, Phoenix Suns, and Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nBiyombo was born in Lubumbashi, Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo), to parents François and Françoise Biyombo. He has three brothers named Billy, Biska and Bikim, and three sisters named Bimeline, Bikelene and Bimela.[1]\n\nAt age 16, he played for Lupopo in the 2008 FIBA Africa Clubs Champions Cup, Africa's premier senior league at the time.[2] That year he was discovered by coach Mário Palma at a youth tournament in Yemen. His play impressed Palma and earned him an opportunity to train in Spain.[3]\n\nBiyombo started the 2009–10 season with Fuenlabrada-Getafe in the Spanish fourth-tier Liga EBA before moving to CB Illescas in the Spanish third-tier LEB Plata. He started the 2010–11 season with CB Illescas before moving to Baloncesto Fuenlabrada of the first-tier Liga ACB in January 2011.[3][1]\n\nBiyombo made his debut at age 18 in the Spanish ACB League with Fuenlabrada against DKV Joventut on January 9, 2011, recording 5 points and 7 rebounds in just over 13 minutes of play.[4] In Fuenlabrada's narrow defeat to Real Madrid, he recorded 6 points and 3 blocks,[5] one of them against former Spanish League MVP and Spanish national team player, Felipe Reyes.[3]\n\nAt the 2011 Nike Hoops Summit, Biyombo participated for the World Select Team (against the USA Select Team), and recorded a triple double, with 12 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 blocks. It was the first recorded triple-double in the Summit's history.[1]\n\nBiyombo was drafted seventh overall by the Sacramento Kings in the 2011 NBA draft, but his rights were later traded to the Charlotte Bobcats in a draft night trade.[6] On December 19, 2011, Biyombo signed a multi-year deal with the Bobcats.[7] After averaging five points per game over his first two seasons with Charlotte, Biyombo's minutes and subsequent production dropped dramatically in 2013–14 as he fell out of favor with coach Steve Clifford, as he averaged just 2.9 points in 13.9 minutes per game.\n\nThe Bobcats changed their name to the Hornets ahead of the 2014-15 season.[8] While his forte in defense and rebounding did drop in 2013–14, Biyombo began the 2014–15 season in much better form despite missing seven out of the first eight games of the season largely due to the acquisition of Jason Maxiell in the 2014 off-season.[9] With the late-December injury to center Al Jefferson, Biyombo was placed into the starting line-up.[10] On June 30, 2015, the Hornets decided not to extend a qualifying offer to Biyombo, making him an unrestricted free agent.[11]\n\nOn July 18, 2015, Biyombo signed a two-year, $5.7 million contract with the Toronto Raptors.[12][13] On August 1, 2015, he played for Team Africa at the 2015 NBA Africa exhibition game.[14] He made his debut for the Raptors in the team's season opener against the Indiana Pacers on October 28, recording 7 points and 5 rebounds in a 106–99 win.[15] Biyombo started in 18 straight games between mid-November and late December while Jonas Valančiūnas was recovering from a fractured hand. On December 17, he recorded 8 points, a then career-high 18 rebounds, and a career-high tying 7 blocks in a loss to the Charlotte Hornets.[16] Five days later, he recorded 9 points and a then career-high 20 rebounds in a 103–99 win over the Dallas Mavericks.[17] Biyombo returned to a bench role on December 30.[18] He returned to the starting line-up in mid-March with Valančiūnas out injured again. On March 17, 2016, Biyombo scored a career-high 16 points and set a franchise record with 25 rebounds in guiding the Raptors to a 101–94 overtime win over the Indiana Pacers.[19] On March 30, he recorded seven points and six rebounds in a 105–97 win over the Atlanta Hawks, helping the Raptors record a 50-win season for the first time in franchise history.[20]\n\nThe Raptors finished the regular season as the second seed in the Eastern Conference with a 56–26 record. In the first round of the playoffs, the Raptors faced the seventh-seeded Indiana Pacers, and in a Game 5 win on April 26, Biyombo recorded 10 points and 16 rebounds off the bench to help the Raptors take a 3–2 series lead.[21] The Raptors went on to win the series 4–3, moving on to the second round where they faced the Miami Heat. In Game 7 of the Raptors' series with the Heat, Biyombo recorded 17 points and 16 rebounds as a starter in a 116–89 win, helping the Raptors advance to the conference finals for the first time in franchise history.[22] In Game 3 of the conference finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Biyombo set a Toronto playoff record with 26 rebounds, helping the Raptors cut the Cavaliers' advantage in the series to 2–1.[23] The Raptors went on to lose the series in six games.\n\nAfter declining his $2.9 million player option for the 2016–17 season, Biyombo became an unrestricted free agent on June 7, 2016.[24] Biyombo later revealed that he wished to re-sign with the Raptors, but with the re-signing of DeMar DeRozan, the Raptors did not have the salary cap space to make it possible.[25][26]\n\nOn July 7, 2016, Biyombo signed a four-year, $72 million contract with the Orlando Magic.[27][28] After exceeding the flagrant foul limit during the 2016 playoffs, Biyombo was forced to serve an NBA-mandated one-game suspension to begin the 2016–17 season.[29] He made his debut for the Magic in the team's second game of the season on October 28, scoring two points in just under 23 minutes in a 108–82 loss to the Detroit Pistons.[30] On January 16, 2017, he scored a season-high 15 points against the Denver Nuggets. He tied that mark on February 11, scoring 15 points against the Dallas Mavericks. On March 5, he grabbed a season-high 15 rebounds against the Washington Wizards.[31]\n\nOn January 1, 2018, Biyombo recorded 13 points and a season-high 17 rebounds in a 98–95 loss to the Brooklyn Nets.[32] On January 12, he scored a career-high 21 points in a 125–119 loss to the Washington Wizards.[33] On April 4, he had 12 points, 12 rebounds and a career-high five assists in a 105–100 win over the Dallas Mavericks.[34]\n\nOn July 7, 2018, Biyombo was traded back to the Charlotte Hornets in a three-team deal.[35][36] On January 5, 2019, he scored a season-high 16 points in a 123–110 loss to the Denver Nuggets.[37]\n\nOn November 27, 2019, Biyombo recorded a season-high 19 points along with 9 rebounds and two blocks in a 102–101 win against the Detroit Pistons.[38] On December 16, 2019, he logged a season-high 17 rebounds along with 11 points and a block against the Indiana Pacers.[39]\n\nBiyombo re-signed with the Hornets on November 30, 2020.[40] On February 5, 2021, he scored a season-high 13 points, along with four rebounds and one assist in 19 minutes against the Utah Jazz.[41] On April 13, he recorded a double-double of 10 points and 12 rebounds against the Los Angeles Lakers.[42] On May 1, he had a season-high five blocks off the bench against the Detroit Pistons.[43] Biyombo again scored 13 points on May 13, where he also recorded seven rebounds and one assist against the Los Angeles Clippers.[44]\n\nBiyombo became an unrestricted free agent after the 2020–21 season.[45] He did not sign with any team throughout 2021 in part due to him grieving for the passing of his father, François.[46] On January 1, 2022, he signed a 10-day contract with the Phoenix Suns via the COVID-19 hardship exemption.[47] On January 11, Biyombo signed for the rest of the season after showing off some very positive production during his 10-day contract.[48] On January 17, Biyombo had 17 points and 14 rebounds. Five days later, on January 22, Biyombo recorded 21 points, 13 rebounds, and 5 assists coming off the bench. From January 26–30, Biyombo became a starter once again due to injuries to Deandre Ayton and JaVale McGee. In the 17 games Biyombo played from January to February 12, the Suns were undefeated.\n\nOn July 5, 2022, the Suns re-signed Biyombo.[49]\n\nOn November 1, 2023, Biyombo signed with the Memphis Grizzlies,[50] but was waived on January 10, 2024.[51]\n\nOn February 10, 2024, Biyombo signed with the Oklahoma City Thunder.[52] On March 6, Biyombo unexpectedly collapsed to the floor on his team's sideline during a game against the Portland Trail Blazers. He was eventually able to leave the court under his own power and was cleared of any serious medical condition.[53]\n\nBiyombo is a Christian.[54] He enjoys reading in his spare time and speaks five languages: English, French, Lingala, Spanish and Swahili.[55] Biyombo is eligible to play for the DR Congo men's national basketball team, but never played for the team, despite his intentions to do so in November 2018.[56]\n\nAfter fainting during an NBA game in 2024 due to dehydration, Biyombo revealed that he has been fasting regularly for 13 seasons as a personal devotion to his Catholic faith.[57]\n\nBiyombo started the Bismack Biyombo Foundation in 2016. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the foundation donated around $1 million worth of medical supplies to people in the DR Congo.[58] In March 2022, Biyombo announced that he had pledged his salary from the entire 2021–22 season towards the construction of a hospital in Congo, in honor of his father.[59]\n\nLegend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game FG% Field goal percentage 3P% 3-point field goal percentage FT% Free throw percentage RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game Bold Career high * Led the league\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 2011–12 Charlotte 63 41 23.1 .464 — .483 5.8 .4 .3 1.8 5.2 2012–13 Charlotte 80 65 27.3 .451 — .521 7.3 .4 .4 1.8 4.8 2013–14 Charlotte 77 9 13.9 .611 — .517 4.8 .1 .1 1.1 2.9 2014–15 Charlotte 64 21 19.4 .543 — .583 6.4 .3 .3 1.5 4.8 2015–16 Toronto 82* 22 22.0 .542 .000 .628 8.0 .4 .2 1.6 5.5 2016–17 Orlando 81 27 22.1 .526 — .534 7.0 .9 .3 1.1 6.0 2017–18 Orlando 82* 25 18.2 .520 .000 .534 5.7 .8 .3 1.2 5.7 2018–19 Charlotte 54 32 14.5 .571 — .637 4.6 .6 .2 .8 4.4 2019–20 Charlotte 53 29 19.4 .543 — .603 5.8 .9 .2 .9 7.4 2020–21 Charlotte 66 36 20.4 .587 .000 .448 5.3 1.2 .3 1.1 5.0 2021–22 Phoenix 36 3 14.1 .593 — .535 4.6 .6 .3 .7 5.8 2022–23 Phoenix 61 14 14.3 .578 — .357 4.3 .9 .3 1.4 4.3 2023–24 Memphis 30 27 23.9 .563 — .478 6.4 1.7 .3 1.1 5.2 2023–24 Oklahoma City 10 0 7.3 .583 — .500 1.8 .2 .1 .3 1.8 Career 839 351 19.5 .535 .000 .553 5.9 .7 .3 1.3 5.1\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 2021 Charlotte 1 1 3.3 – – – .0 .0 .0 .0 .0 Career 1 1 3.3 – – – .0 .0 .0 .0 .0\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 2014 Charlotte 3 1 16.0 .600 — .333 3.7 .3 .0 .7 2.7 2016 Toronto 20 10 25.3 .580 — .597 9.4 .4 .4 1.4 6.2 2022 Phoenix 9 0 9.5 .647 — .500 2.1 .6 .1 .2 2.8 2023 Phoenix 8 0 9.8 .563 — .500 3.4 .8 .0 1.3 3.4 Career 40 11 18.0 .589 — .559 6.1 .5 .2 1.0 4.6"
