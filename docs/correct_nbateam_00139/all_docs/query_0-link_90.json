        "text": "ORLANDO (AP) â€” The Orlando Magic have signed free agent big man Jason Maxiell, adding a veteran presence to an injury-depleted front court.\n\nGeneral manager Rob Hennigan announced the signing Thursday.\n\nThe 30-year-old comes from the Detroit Pistons, where he appeared in 72 games last season. He was drafted in 2005 and had spent his entire eight-year NBA career with the Pistons.\n\nMaxiell, 6-7, joins a Magic roster that was thin behind center Nikola Vucevic, with Glen Davis recovering from foot surgery. Maxiell can play power forward or as a small center.\n\nMaxiell averaged 6.9 points, 5.7 rebounds and 1.3 blocks last season."
