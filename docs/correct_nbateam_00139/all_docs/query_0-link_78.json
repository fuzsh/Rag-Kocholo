        "text": "The Orlando Magic upgraded their frontcourt with the free-agent addition of Jason Maxiell, who will log minutes at both power forward and center in the 2013/14 season. They also brought the former Detroit Piston aboard, as John Denton of OrlandoMagic.com writes, to provide some leadership for the team's young core. The 30-year-old Cincinnati product told Denton about his leadership style:\n\nI'm more of a hands-on type of guy and I'm going to show you how to do it, tell you all that you need to know and then you throw you to the dogs. The first time I'll show you how, the second time I'll guide you through it and the third time you'll be on your own out there.\n\nThe Magic have, in Kyle O'Quinn, Andrew Nicholson, and Tobias Harris, a trio of big men aged 23 and younger. Second-round Draft choice Romero Osby has not signed with Orlando yet, but he also falls in the category of young power players whom Maxiell can mentor.\n\nDenton's full story goes into more depth on what Maxiell might bring to the Magic. He also confirms that Maxiell's relationship with Orlando assistant general manager Scott Perry played a role in bringing the bruising big man to the Magic; Perry served in Detroit's front office when the Pistons selected Maxiell in the 2005 NBA Draft.\n\nWe invite you to follow Orlando Pinstriped Post on Twitter and like Orlando Pinstriped Post on Facebook.\n\nMore from Orlando Pinstriped Post:"
