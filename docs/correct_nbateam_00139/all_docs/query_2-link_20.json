        "text": "AUBURN HILLS — It seems the Pistons Jason Maxiell has been a new man since being inserted into the starting lineup on March 3 in place of the injured Ben Wallace. Entering Tuesday night’s game against Indiana, Maxiell is averaging a double-double (11.3 points and 10.4 rebounds) in 10 games as a the starting center. The numbers are nearly double of his season averages of 6.7 points and 5.3 rebounds per game. The increased production is a welcome surprise for the struggling Pistons, but even Maxiell is unsure what to attribute it to. “I really don’t know,” Maxiell said. “It’s the same effort, day-in and day-out, with the minutes, without the minutes. I’m just trying to pick up the slack for Ben (Wallace) being out and trying to play my role. “Just knowing coach has the confidence to start me is great.” Maxiell said he changes his approach when he’s starting as opposed to coming off the bench, but the starting can’t be the sole reason for Maxiell’s increased production. The big change has been his increase in minutes. Maxiell started 15 games earlier in the season at power forward, averaging 6.2 points and 4.9 rebounds. But in those game he didn’t even average 20 minutes a game. In his recent role as a starter, he is averaging more than 30 minutes per game. It’s the first time in his NBA career that Maxiell has played so many minutes. He has often been labeled an energy guy, whose production drops once he hits a certain amount of minutes per game. But that has not been the case as of late. “It’s all about conditioning,” Maxiell said. “You come out there mentally ready for that and physically ready for it, you should be OK.” While Maxiell is prepared for more playing time, he doesn’t necessarily buy into more minutes means more production. “Not necessarily because the more minutes you have, the more you have to produce,” Maxiell said. “Just have the mindset of come out there, no matter how much time it is, go out there and play.” Wallace remains out Wallace missed Tuesday’s game due to soreness in both his knees. Wallace missed nine games with a right patella tendon strain. He returned for the Pistons loss at Indiana on March 19 before missing the last two with sore knees. He started the Pistons first 60 games of the season before the right knee injury, averaging 5.2 points and 9.0 rebounds. Pistons coach John Kuester was asked if they would shut down Wallace for the rest of the season, and said it would be up to Wallace. “The competitor he is, he could have said that before he got hurt the second time,” Kuester said. “It was up to him. He wanted to play. I’m sure he’s going to make sure that he feels a 100 percent if he’s going to come back again. At this stage of his career and also this time of the season, it’s hard to be 100 percent. You want to feel as good as you possibly can.” The Pistons only signed Wallace to a one-year deal, but Kuester believes Wallace could play at least another year. “If he feels he’s as healthy as he did going into the summer (last year), absolutely,” Kuester said. “Ben Wallace, he’s a warrior, but he wants to play at a high level, the best he possibly can.” Dave Pemberton covers the Pistons for The Oakland Press.
