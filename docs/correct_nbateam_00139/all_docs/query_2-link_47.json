        "text": "Ex-Piston Jason Maxiell was no pushover in the NBA. Ditto for the Chinese Basketball Association where he currently plays.\n\nThe Sporting News reports that Maxiell, who plays for the Tianjin Gold Lions took a hard hit to the head from Shandong center Wu Ke (6-10, 220) during Wednesday's game.\n\nMaxiell didn't appreciate that and chased Wu Ke across the court.\n\nMichael Beasley, a former NBA player, who is on Wu Ke's team, was able to intervene and calm Maxiell down before Wu Ke got a taste of Detroit love.\n\nNick Bedard of Basketball Buddha reports Wu Ke has been suspended 11 games for the cheap shot, the Sport News reports."
