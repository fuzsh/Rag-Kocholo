        "text": "AUBURN HILLS -- There were nights last season when Jason Maxiell would play really well. Other nights, not so much.\n\nAnd then, there were times he didn't play at all.\n\nEven now, with a new coach, playing time for the 6-foot-7 forward remains a crapshoot. This preseason, which kicks off Monday against the Miami Heat, will help determine how much Maxiell will play this season.\n\n\"If it's more minutes, that'd be great,\" Maxiell said. \"If it's less, I'll still have myself mentally prepared no matter what.\"\n\nAlthough Maxiell is entering his fifth NBA season, he is coming off a year in which his numbers fell in just about every major statistical category.\n\nHe averaged career highs in scoring (7.9 points), rebounds (5.3), assists (0.56), blocks (1.15) and minutes per game (21.5) while appearing in all 82 regular-season games in 2007-08.\n\nNaturally, expectations were high for him last season.\n\nBut, like most of what Detroit did last season, things didn't go as well as Maxiell had hoped. His numbers were down as Detroit finished a disappointing 39-43 and was bounced from the playoffs by Cleveland in the first round, the team's earliest playoff exit since 2002.\n\nThat led to several changes in the offseason, including the firing of first-year coach Michael Curry.\n\nMaxiell came into training camp this season as confident as ever, but not because of Curry's dismissal. With former Detroit veterans Rasheed Wallace now in Boston and Antonio McDyess with San Antonio, an opportunity to play more could become available.\n\nAware of this, Maxiell said he spent much of the summer working on improving his post game as well as becoming a better face-to-the-basket player.\n\n\"(I'm) trying to take on the role of the four-man (power forward) that can knock down the 15-footer like Dice can and also be a guy that can bang down low,\" Maxiell said.\n\nMaxiell said he wants to have a more prominent, consistent role this season, but still is doing what he can to help the younger Pistons players who are going through the ups and downs that come with a player's first NBA training camp.\n\n\"In practice, I speak more to them and let them know, this isn't college anymore,\" said Maxiell, who is known for his low-key, quiet demeanor. \"You have to work and talk on the court defensively, which I had to learn my rookie year. I'm trying to take on the role of being a guy that speaks up more this year.\"\n\nPistons coach John Kuester has been pleased with Maxiell.\n\n\"He's an energy player,\" Kuester said. \"Once he absorbs what you're trying to accomplish, he's a very effective basketball player. I'm real interested to see how the preseason progresses, what's going to end up happening.\""
