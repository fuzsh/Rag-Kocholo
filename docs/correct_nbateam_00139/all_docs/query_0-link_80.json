        "text": "GRAND RAPIDS, Mich.—The top players for the Detroit Pistons and Denver Nuggets didn’t see much playing time Wednesday night.\n\nBut a sellout crowd watching the exhibition game still saw plenty of entertainment from players trying to catch the eye of their coaches.\n\nJason Maxiell scored 25 points and had 12 rebounds, while Flip Murray added 21 points and seven assists to lead the Pistons to a 119-110 victory over the Nuggets.\n\nJ.R. Smith led Denver with 33 points. Second-year player Bobby Jones added 26. Smith scored 18 points in the first half, including 12 in the second quarter.\n\nBoth teams rested most of their frontline players.\n\n“I thought the younger players did some positive things out there,” said Detroit coach Flip Saunders. “They made some mental mistakes at times, but it’s tough when you’re not used to playing many minutes with the same guys out there. I thought they played through all of that.”\n\n“The tempo of the game was good for us,” said Denver coach George Karl. “But we didn’t play good defense.”\n\nPistons rookie Rodney Stuckey, the NBA’s 15th draft pick this summer out of Eastern Washington, got his first start at guard in place of veteran Chauncey Billups and finished with 17 points and six assists\n\n“I’m out there to be aggressive and try to create things for me and my teammates,” Stuckey said.\n\nThe Pistons were without guard Richard Hamilton, who left Sunday’s game against Denver in Auburn Hills midway through the third quarter after spraining his left ankle.\n\nAlso out with injuries were Nazr Mohammed (sore left calf) and Amir Johnson (sprained left ankle).\n\nDenver was without many of its top players, including Carmelo Anthony, Allen Iverson, Kenyon Martin and Nene. The Nuggets lost to the Pistons 109-106 Sunday, also without those four players.\n\nSmith had 12 of his 18 first-half points for Denver in the second quarter. The Pistons led 61-55 at halftime.\n\nMaxiell led the Pistons in the first half with 11 points and six rebounds. He finished with six defensive and six offensive rebounds for the game.\n\n“He’s doing a great job of getting the offensive rebounds for us,” said Detroit forward Tayshaun Prince.\n\n“I’m happy to be getting the playing time right now,” said Maxiell. “I’m coming in with more confidence. Everyone is trying to get it in gear right now.”\n\nMaxiell scored 10 points in the third to spark the Pistons to a 94-89 lead heading into the final quarter.\n\n“I’m more confident going to the left side and being more positive out there,” Maxiell said.\n\nJones and Smith both had 24 points after the third quarter for the Nuggets.\n\n“I”m glad J.R. broke out tonight,” Karl said. “He’s been struggling. But he still has the confidence to create his chances in the game.”\n\nDetroit outrebounded Denver 55-37. Eduardo Najera had 11 boards for the Nuggets.\n\nNotes:@ Wednesday’s game attracted a sellout crowd of 11,733 at Van Andel Arena for the Pistons annual October preseason game in Grand Rapids.\n\nBoth teams are 3-2 for the preseason."
