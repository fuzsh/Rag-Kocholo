Maxiell spent most of his NBA career with the Pistons while also playing in Orlando and Charlotte before playing overseas.\n\nFantasy Impact\n\nMaxiell was late first-round pick back in 2005 right after the Pistons won the NBA title. Maxiell was a solid big but never made much noise in fantasy circles."
