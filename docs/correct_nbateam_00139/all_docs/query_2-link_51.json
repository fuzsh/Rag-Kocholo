        "text": "CORRECTIONS AND CLARIFICATIONS: An earlier version of this story misidentified why DeShawn Stevenson was not selected.\n\nIn a surprise move, DeShawn Stevenson, projected to go No. 1 in the BIG3's mock draft, was removed from the field as he was named co-captain of the Ball Hogs. Instead, guard Andre Owens went No. 1 to the Ball Hogs, who he will play for when the league's second season opens June 22.\n\nHere's what you need to know about the 19 players taken:\n\nROUND ONE\n\nNo. 1, Ball Hogs, Andre Owens\n\nA shooting guard who once played for a pro team in Angola, was the secondoverall pick of the 2017 BIG3 draft and finished last season in the top five among league leaders in scoring, rebounding and assists.\n\nNo. 2, 3’s Company, Andre Emmett\n\nA forward who played four years for Bob Knight at Texas Tech and lived to tell about it, then played for almost two dozen pro teams — mostly overseas — before landing in the BIG3.\n\nNo. 3, Killer 3s, Alan Anderson\n\nA forward who helped lead Michigan State to the Final Four in 2005 and since has been a basketball vagabond who last played for the Lakeland Magic of the NBA G League.\n\nNo. 4, Power, Chris Andersen\n\nA 6-foot-10 big man, better known as the Birdman, for his array of tattoos, for a two-year ban from the NBA for violating the league's drug policy and as a colorful member of the 2013 NBA champion Miami Heat.\n\nNo. 5, Tri-State, David Hawkins\n\nA swingman who played college ball at Temple for legendary coach John Chaney and shares Philadelphia connections with Tri-State coach Julius Erving.\n\nNo. 6, Ghost Ballers, Lee Nailon\n\nA forward who, after five years as mostly a role player in the NBA, was named Israeli Super League MVP in 2007 and since has pin-balled around the world playing pro ball.\n\nROUND TWO\n\nNo. 7 (overall), Ball Hogs, Corsley Edwards\n\nA forward who’s got March Madness trivia cache: In 2000, he helped lead Central Connecticut State University to its first NCAA tournament appearance, but has been mostly off the grid since.\n\nNo. 8, 3’s Company, Jason Maxiell\n\nA power forward signed a contract with the Detroit Pistons last year, simply so he could retire as a member of the Pistons.\n\nNo. 9, Killers 3s, Ryan Hollins\n\nA center who played parts of 10 seasons in the NBA and should be useful if BIG3 co-founder Ice Cube starts a track-and-field league. Hollins high jumped 6-feet-10 inches in college.\n\nNo. 10, Power, Quentin Richardson\n\nA guard who can fill it up from long range, having led the NBA in 3-pointers in 2004. He won the 3-point shootout at the 2005 All-Star Game.\n\nNo. 11. 3 Headed Monsters, Salim Stoudamire\n\nA point guard, he’s the cousin of Damon Stoudamire and one of the few former NBA players who ate vegan while he still was in the league.\n\nNo. 12. Tri-State, Robert Hite\n\nA guard who has high tops, will travel. He's globe-trotted overseas and last suited up for the Canton Charge of the NBA G League in 2013-14.\n\nNo. 13. Ghost Ballers, Marcus Banks\n\nA guard whose given name — Arthur Lemarcus Banks III — stretches across a resume that should note he will be the only Dixie College alum and Greek Cup winner in the BIG3.\n\nROUND THREE\n\nNo. 14. Ball Hogs, Jermaine Taylor\n\nA shooting guard who still holds the records at Tavares High School in Florida in the long jump, high jump, and triple jump.\n\nNo. 15. 3’s Company, Derrick Byars\n\nSwingman who was the Southeastern Conference Player of the Year in 2007 and mostly has bounced around overseas. Last season, was one of only nine BIG3 players to start all eight regular-season games.\n\nNo. 16. Killer 3s, Mike James\n\nA point guard who won an NBA championship with the Detroit Pistons in 2004 and played in the BIG3 last season with Tri-State.\n\nNo. 17. Power, Ryan Gomes\n\nA forward who at a minimum should be able to help draw up X’s and O’s considering he served as an assistant coach for the Long Island Nets of the NBA G League during the 2016-17 season.\n\nNo. 18. Tri-State, Bonzi Wells\n\nA swingman who averaged double figures in scoring during seven of his 10 seasons in the NBA.\n\nNo. 19. Ghost Ballers, Mario West\n\nA guard who won the 2007 NCAA Slam Dunk contest held at the Final Four and won a championship playing in a league in the Dominican Republic."
