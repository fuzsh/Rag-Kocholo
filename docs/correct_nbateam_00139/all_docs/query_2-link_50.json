        "text": "Former Cincinnati Bearcats standout Jason Maxiell, who spent eight of his 10 NBA seasons with the Detroit Pistons, appeared on Iyanla: Fix My Life on the ‎Oprah Winfrey Network and talked about his infidelity, admitting specifically that he slept with 341 women before and during his marriage to wife Brandi Maxiell.\n\nIyanla's response to the 34-year-old Maxiell: \"Every time you're with another woman, you abandon you. And every time you tell another lie, you abandon you. And every time you take a drink to stuff the pain down, you abandon you. This wasn't about sex. This was about punishment.\"\n\nShe also questioned Maxiell about sex addiction and asked about how often he consumes alcohol.\n\nThe episode, titled \"Basketball Lies: Brandi and Jason Maxiell,\" aired Sept. 8 on OWN. The synopsis from oprah.com:\n\nFormer NBA star Jason Maxiell and his reality star wife, Brandi (Basketball Wives LA), have been high school sweethearts for 17 years. They've built a family together, battled through Brandi's cancer diagnosis and stood by each other's side at every turn. However, everything is not always as it seems: Since the beginning of their relationship, Jason has been lying to Brandi and habitually cheating on her.\n\nToday, the couple is at a breaking point. Brandi has had enough of Jason's disgraceful behavior, and Jason is desperate to keep his family together. So, Iyanla sits them down to determine whether they should rebuild their toxic relationship—or whether the clock has run out on their marriage.\n\nMaxiell was a first-round pick of the Pistons in 2005 after starring at UC from 2001 to 2005. He averaged 5.6 points and 4.2 rebounds per game over 618 career NBA games and signed a contract with Detroit in August of last year so that he could retire as a member of the Pistons.\n\nIn June, Jacob Evans became the Bearcats' first first-round pick since Maxiell in 2005 when he was drafted 28th overall by the Golden State Warriors."
