        "text": "By: Evan Jankens\n\n@kingofthekc\n\nCue up the \"Yakety Sax\" music for this video.\n\nFormer Detroit Pistons forward Jason Maxiell had quite the situation on his hands while playing for the Tianjin Gold Lion of the Chinese Basketball Association.\n\nMaxiell, as you might remember, played with the Detroit Pistons from 2005-2013. Now playing in China, Maxiell lost his cool after he was hit with a cheap shot.\n\nWhen I first watched the video, I thought it would just be a little scuffle but I was so wrong. Maxiell decided to chase Wu Ke of the Shandong Flaming Bulls around the court.\n\nThe craziest thing to me is that former second overall pick in the 2008 NBA Draft, Michael Beasley, is the one who talked some sense into Maxiell.\n\nThis might be the best contribution Maxiell has given to basketball."
