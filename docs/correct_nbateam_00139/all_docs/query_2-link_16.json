        "text": "Kevin Durant says Zion Williamson is a 'one of one' type of talent\n\nBrooklyn Nets star forward Kevin Durant studies the game and its history as much as any top player in the NBA today. That’s why his praise of New Orleans Pelicans young forward Zion Williamson as a “one of one”-type of talent speaks volumes about the kind of ability he believes the 22-year-old possesses. “You’ve seen guys at that size, 6-7, that can get up and down the floor and move, but not at that level, though,” Durant said after Monday’s practice. “You’ve seen guys like Jason Maxiell, I’m not saying they jump as high as Zion, but they were undersized guys that played bigger. And Zion’s one of those guys. Rodney Rogers — I’m missing so many guys that were that tall at 6-6, Charles Barkley bruiser-type guys but played bigger. But Zion’s athleticism trumps all of theirs by far. And when you add that to the mix, it makes him a one of one.”\n\nFormer Cincinnati Bearcats standout Jason Maxiell, who spent eight of his 10 NBA seasons with the Detroit Pistons, appeared on Iyanla: Fix My Life on the ‎Oprah Winfrey Network and talked about his infidelity, admitting specifically that he slept with 341 women before and during his marriage to wife Brandi Maxiell. Iyanla’s response to the 34-year-old Maxiell: “Every time you’re with another woman, you abandon you. And every time you tell another lie, you abandon you. And every time you take a drink to stuff the pain down, you abandon you. This wasn’t about sex. This was about punishment.” She also questioned Maxiell about sex addiction and asked about how often he consumes alcohol."
