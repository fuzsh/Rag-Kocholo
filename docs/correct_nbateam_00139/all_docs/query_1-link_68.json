(Shoot) I might even ask him to do it again, you know, just to try to give us a spark off the bench and some consistency off the bench. So, no, I didn't have no problem at all.\n\n\"I'm straight. Like I said, I might even ask him for the next game, what, tomorrow? To do it again tomorrow. Maybe that's one of the things that we need, just try something different.\"\n\nHe was joking, right? Maybe not. According to George Blaha, Rasheed is coming off the bench again tonight against the Bobcats. I touched upon Sheed's initial benching on the FanHouse. The gist of it is this: it looks like Flip Saunders is serious about taking control of the team. Also, you know how Dale Davis missed three straight games and then only played three minutes last night? I swear I read that he was ill, but Chris McCosky revealed today that Davis has actually been in the doghouse for missing a practice.\n\nThe Pistons are 1-1 against the Bobcats (the W, the L), allowing Matt Carroll to play like a freaking All-Star both times. Hopefully Saunders lit a fire under the team and this one isn't close.\n\nLast but not least, I have a special request for your collective knowledge: DBB reader (and current MSU student) Mike is working on a school project about the original Bad Boys. I'll let him take it from here:\n\nWhat's up guys, I'm doing a project at Michigan State on the original Bad Boys of the great late 80's and I am trying to figure out what were the main songs/anthems that played during their domination... like player intro songs or just the overall songs in which were related to their play... besides the obvious \"Final Countdown\", if you guys could help me out, I'd appreciate it! GO STONES!!!"
