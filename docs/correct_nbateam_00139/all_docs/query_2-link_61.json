        "text": "The sequel to my All-NBA “All Offense, No Defense” Team, this post will highlight the guys from the 2014-15 season who were great at keeping the ball from going in the hoop…on both ends of the court.\n\nIn my previous post I used Box Plus/Minus (BPM), a regression-based statistic that estimates the points per 100 possessions a player contributed to over an average player. Since BPM is broken up into offensive and defensive components (OBPM and DBPM), I found players whose OBPM was at least 1 standard deviation above the league mean and whose DBPM was at least 1 standard deviation below the league mean. In this post I’ll use the same methodology but I’ll be looking for above average defense combined with below average offense.\n\nSomething this project has underscored for me is how different guards and bigs utilize their skill set on the court. More often than not, guards and wings are drafted for their scoring and offensive playmaking while bigs are drafted for their defense and rim protection (Of course, guys like Enes Kanter and Tony Allen are the exception). The plot below shows how players generally performed by position. The y-axis represents the difference between a player’s OBPM and DBPM, so the positive y-axis represents strong offense, while the negative y-axis represents strong defense. We can see that point guards are the most offensively minded, while centers are stronger defensively.\n\nBig men playing around the rim simply have a much higher defensive impact than a lockdown perimeter defender (consider that Tim Duncan finished with a higher DBPM than his DPOY teammate, Kawhi Leonard). In constructing my “All Offense, No Defense” team, I struggled finding power forwards and centers who fit my criteria of elite offense and bad defense, since most big men, by virtue of their defensive role, will grade out well in DBPM. For my “All Defense, No Offense” team, I had the opposite problem; only one guard/wing fit my initial criteria. To fill out my team I slowly softened my constraints until I had a balanced roster.\n\nHere’s my “All Defense, No Offense” team for 2014-2015. When viewing the numbers, check out these overall distributions. An OBPM or DBPM of 0 is around league average, while anything greater than 3 or less than -3 is extreme (greater than 3 is elite while less than 3 is, as Charles Barkley would say, “turrible”). The main difference between the two is the upper tail on offense, which is where players like Steph Curry and James Harden set themselves apart.\n\nPoint Guard: Nick Calathes (1.8 DBPM, -2.1 OBPM), Rajon Rondo (1.1, -1.6):\n\nAs Mike Conley’s backup for the past two years, Nick Calathes has adopted the Grizzlies mentality of strong defense with grind it out offense – after all, Memphis has finished in the top 10 in defensive efficiency for the past 5 years. A standout in international play for Greece, Calathes is one of the more reliable backup point guards in the league. Rajon Rondo has turned into one of the league’s most controversial players after his falling out with the Mavericks in the 2015 playoffs. Beyond his clash with Rick Carlisle, there’s the concern that an NBA trending towards spacing and outside shooting has passed by a player with Rondo’s lack of a 3 point threat. Rondo will look to reclaim his status as an all-star caliber point guard on a one-year, “prove it” deal with the Sacramento Kings.\n\nShooting Guard: Elijah Millsap (1.9 DBPM, -3.5 OBPM), Kent Bazemore (1.3, -3.1):\n\nElijah Millsap followed in the footsteps of his older brother Paul, who came from a mid-major college to get an opportunity with the Utah Jazz. Like his brother, Millsap was a nice surprise for Utah last year. He got extended time when starting SG Alec Burks was lost for the year, and helped the team finish with the league’s best defensive efficiency after the all-star break. Former Summer League MVP Kent Bazemore has bounced around the league since he entered in 2012, but finally found a niche as a bench wing defender for the overachieving Hawks last year.\n\nSmall Forward: Michael Kidd-Gilchrest (1.3 DBPM, -2.2 OBPM), Evan Turner (1.3, -2.2):\n\nSince he was drafted 2nd overall out of Kentucky in 2012, everyone knew MKG could defend, and after finishing with the 6th highest DBPM among SF last year at age 21 he looks poised to be one of the NBA’s premier perimeter defenders over the next decade. When the Hornets signed Kidd-Gilchrest to a four-year $52M contract this summer though, they did so with the hope he’d improve his ; more specifically his shooting. Though he’s shown improvement, he has a long way to come from his subpar 36.7% on shots outside 3 feet, and astonishingly zero 3 point attempts last year. After struggling with the 76ers and Pacers in 2014 it looked like Evan Turner could have been on his way out of the league. Instead, the other number 2 pick found a place in Boston and helped the surprising Celtics reach the playoffs.\n\nPower Forward: Nerlens Noel (4.5 DBPM, -3.7 OBPM), Jason Maxiell (1.9, -4.5), Bismack Biyombo (2.8, -3.2):\n\nAfter being touted as one of the premier defensive prospects of the 2013 draft, Nerlens Noel lived up to the hype by finishing with the league’s fifth highest DBPM in his rookie year. Noel combined elite rim protection with all around defensive reflexes and awareness, which helped him finish with nearly 2 steals and blocks per game last year. Though his offense is raw, Noel looks like a future Defensive Player of the Year; good news for the rebuilding Sixers. Jason Maxiell is currently an unsigned free agent after spending most of his career as a backup with Detroit and spending time with Orlando and Charlotte. Bismack Biyombo entered the league with Serge Ibaka hype as a raw shot blocker from Africa, but so far only the rim protection has translated. Biyombo will play for the Raptors next year, who struggled defensively at times with Jonas Valanciunas as the primary big.\n\nCenter: Samuel Dalembert (3.0 DBPM, -5.2 OBPM), Jusuf Nurkic (3.1, -3.7), Ian Mahinmi (2.6, -3.8):\n\nAfter bouncing around the league on vet-minimum contracts for seemingly forever, Dalembert is back on the Mavericks to take some of the minutes left over from the departed Tyson Chandler (because, you know, DeAndre Jordon won’t be). While Dalembert should perform admirably replacing Chandler’s defense, he’s never touched his .697 TS% of last year. Jusuf Nurkic is one of the brighter spots on the rebuilding(?) Nuggets, but he’s got a long way to go on offense to be a respectable force down low. With Roy Hibbert off to the Lakers, Ian Mahinmi would seemingly become the starting center in Indiana, or at least before Myles Turner takes it from him. While a clear downgrade from Hibbert, Mahinmi should be able to replicate most of his defensive production."
