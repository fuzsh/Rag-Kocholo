        "text": "ORLANDO, Fla. â€” The Orlando Magic have signed free agent big man Jason Maxiell, adding a veteran presence to an injury-depleted front court.\n\nGeneral manager Rob Hennigan announced the signing Thursday.\n\nThe 30-year-old Maxiell comes from Detroit, where he appeared in 72 games last season. He was drafted in 2005 and has spent his entire eight-year NBA career with the Pistons.\n\nThe 6-foot-7 Maxiell joins a Magic roster that was thin behind centre Nikola Vucevic, with Glen Davis recovering from foot surgery. Maxiell can play power forward or centre.\n\nMaxiell averaged 6.9 points, 5.7 rebounds and 1.3 blocks last season."
