        "text": "As the NBA lockout enters its third month, fans have reason to be optimistic. The league and its players' union have met three times between Aug. 31 and Sept. 8. The meetings were long and involved some key players for each side. Although no new CBA is imminent, optimism is justified since the league and the NBPA met only once between July 1 and Aug. 30.\n\nTo those watching, it's pretty obvious that the urgency is there for both sides to get a deal done. Although they're still engaged in a high stakes game of chicken, it seems that the NBA is finally ready to concede on some of its demands.\n\nOne thing that the NBPA and its members have done wisely, however, was create leverage for themselves by utilizing social media networks and the Internet. Millions of Twitter followers and YouTube views have helped to convince some important people that the Impact League might be a good idea. And as of right now, about 70 NBA players are planning on participating in an organized basketball tournament.\n\nMeanwhile, Kevin Durant has been a man possessed, tearing up basketball courts from Washington, D.C. to New York City and all the way back to Los Angeles.\n\nMost recently, he torched Carmelo Anthony, LeBron James and Chris Paul for 59 points. And while I still do not think Kevin Durant is better than Carmelo Anthony…This got me thinking…\n\nHow many fans would be willing to pay to watch NBA players come together and represent their respective cities in a tournament? It's a good question.\n\nA better question is, which NBA city could form the best team comprised of current NBA players?\n\nIt's easy to see that Los Angeles is the home of the best ballers in California, especially when you consider snubs—like Brandon Jennings and DeMar DeRozan—that would have been good enough to make the Bay City team.\n\nThat being said, Jason Kidd has made a career out of making his teammates better, so he would definitely get the most out of his supporting cast. Ray Allen has been drilling jumpers long before his Celtics days, so I'm willing to bet that behind their leadership, they'd get this team to outplay its collective talent. Again, Jason Kidd has made a career of that.\n\nHere's some love for the Pacific Northwest. Seattle is a great basketball city and has clearly produced some very capable NBA players. All in all, here, you have a very solid roster that has a little of everything. Penetration, playmaking, passing and a bit of an interior presence from an underrated Center in Spencer Hawes.\n\nAlthough Martell Webster hasn't fulfilled his potential to this point, he and Terrance Williams—if they were surrounded with such a talent base—would show that they are both great \"glue guys.\"\n\nThis team could effectively play in the half court, run-and-gun and drill three pointers. Size is lacking, but since that's a recurring theme here, they'd be competitive with everyone else.\n\nChris Bosh's talent goes overlooked because he was stuck in Toronto and then decided to be a third wheel in Miami. LaMarcus Aldridge has shown he has the ability to be an elite power forward in the league, and T.J. Ford—in his prime—was a great orchestrator.\n\nThey would easily be a top defensive team but would have no trouble scoring and sharing the ball.\n\nAll in all, it's clear to see that the stars hailing for Dallas and Houston would be amongst the top teams.\n\nSince all are capable scorers that rebound well, the trade off between defensive matchups could be mitigated a bit.\n\nTy Lawson is a good point guard, and Carmelo and Durant are probably the two most prolific scorers in the NBA today. Give me those guys with a point guard that I trust, a versatile sixth man and a young big guy that isn't afraid to get dirty…and I'll love my team.\n\nCertainly, the thought of Derrick Rose and Dwyane Wade playing together is what had Chicago Bulls fans calling Wade a \"traitor\" for electing to stay in Miami. Shawn Marion was one of the most versatile players in the league in his day. All in all, this team would be very tough.\n\nCompared to the others, it's easy to see that they'd be amongst the best. They're deep, versatile and unselfish."
