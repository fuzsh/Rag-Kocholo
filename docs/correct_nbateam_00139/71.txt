TORONTO — Detroit Pistons forward Jason Maxiell will miss the rest of the season after surgery to repair a detached retina.

Maxiell began complaining of blurry vision last week and didn’t travel with the team for Sunday’s loss at Chicago. He stayed home in Detroit to visit a specialist, who diagnosed the injury.

Detroit’s first-round pick in the 2005 draft, Maxiell has spent his entire eight-year career with the Pistons and will be a free agent this summer. He averaged 6.9 points, 5.7 rebounds and a career-high 1.3 blocks this season.

The Pistons, who have lost three straight and 16 of 18, were also without guard Will Bynum (strained right hand) for Monday’s game at Toronto.
