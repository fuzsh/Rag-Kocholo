"Jason made an impact on and off the court with the organization, spending eight seasons in Detroit, many with deep playoff runs. We're pleased that Jason has chosen to remain connected to our organization and wish him well in the future."

Drafted 26th overall by Detroit in the 2005 NBA Draft out of the University of Cincinnati, Maxiell spent eight seasons with the Pistons, averaging 6.1 points, 4.4 rebounds, 0.8 blocks and 19.1 minutes in 523 games.

"The best years of my professional career were spent in Detroit and it's important to me to retire as a Detroit Piston," said Maxiell. "This is a special franchise with great tradition and history. I want to thank all the fans who supported me during my eight seasons representing Detroit."

Maxiell was known for his stout defense and toughness, finishing his Pistons career with 426 blocks which ranks ninth all-time in franchise history.
