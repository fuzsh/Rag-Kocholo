Former Pistons forward Jason Maxiell signed a contract with the team, allowing him to retire as a member of Detroit’s franchise.

After being drafted No. 26 overall in 2005 out of Cincinnati, Maxiell spent the next eight seasons with the Pistons, averaging 6.1 points, 4.4 rebounds, 0.8 blocks and 19.1 minutes in 523 games.

“The best years of my professional career were spent in Detroit and it’s important to me to retire as a Detroit Piston,” said Maxiell, 34. “This is a special franchise with great tradition and history. I want to thank all the fans who supported me during my eight seasons representing Detroit.”

Maxiell then played one season each for the Orlando Magic and Charlotte Hornets before finishing his basketball career with pro teams in China and Turkey.
