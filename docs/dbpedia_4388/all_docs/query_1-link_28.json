        "text": "On June 7th, Cornerstone Robotics officially signed a strategic cooperation framework agreement with School of MEDICINE of The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. Both parties will fully leverage their professional strengths and resources to deeply collaborate in platform construction, educational training, and scientific research. Together, they will build a world-class minimally invasive surgery and surgical robotics teaching base, cultivate more top innovative talents in minimally invasive surgery, and promote the high-quality development of medical services and the surgical robot industry.\n\nAttendees from Cornerstone Robotics were Prof. Samuel AU (Founder & CEO) and Ms. Sophie HAO (Chief Operating Officer). The representatives of The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen were made of Prof. HUANG Jianwei, Associate Vice-President (Institutional Development), Prof. Davy CHENG, Founding Dean of School of MEDICINE, MED associate deans, Director of the Laboratory Animal Center of School of MEDICINE, and professors. The signing ceremony was hosted by Prof. YEUNG Chung Kwong, the Chair & Chief of Paediatric Surgery and Paediatric Urology at School of MEDICINE, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen.\n\nSigning representatives (front row from left to right):\n\nProf. Ban TSUI, Associate Dean of School of MEDICINE, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (Clinical Innovation & Translation Research; Clinical Education)\n\nMs. Sophie HAO, Chief Operating Officer of Cornerstone Robotics\n\nWitnessing guests (back row from left to right):\n\nProf. YEUNG Chung Kwong, the Chair & Chief of Paediatric Surgery and Paediatric Urology at School of MEDICINE, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen\n\nProf. Davy CHENG, Founding Dean of School of MEDICINE, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen\n\nProf. Jianwei HUANG, Associate Vice President of The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (Institutional Development)\n\nProf. Samuel AU, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Cornerstone Robotics\n\nProf. Hsien-Da HUANG, Associate Dean of School of MEDICINE, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen (Student Affairs)\n\nCollaborative Efforts\n\nBuilding a Medical Education Research and Industry Ecosystem\n\nOver the past two decades, the rapid development of minimally invasive surgery, especially surgical robots, has led to revolutionary progress in surgery. However, there is still a huge unmet clinical demand in the global market, which means that the application and popularization of robot-assisted surgical skills are very important. Education and training are key forces in promoting medical progress and innovation.\n\nThe \"Minimally Invasive Surgery and Surgical Robot Teaching Base\" jointly established by Cornerstone Robotics and School of MEDICINE of The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, is a top-notch training center for minimally invasive surgery in Asia, featuring laparoscopic surgical robots. It covers all aspects of surgical teaching, operational skill training, and clinical real-world practice, allowing graduates and trained doctors to seamlessly integrate teaching and training with actual clinical work. They can directly apply the knowledge and skills they have learned to clinical work, truly helping patients with innovative technology.\n\nProf. Davy CHENG, Founding Dean of School of MEDICINE, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, expressed his congratulations and expectations for the cooperation between the two parties during the ceremony. He said, \"The first batch of medical students from School of MEDICINE of The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, has entered a key stage of clinical practice, and the timely cooperation with Cornerstone Robotics is well-suited. As an innovative force in medical technology in the Greater Bay Area of China, Cornerstone Robotics has formulated a comprehensive plan for production, manufacturing, guidance, teaching, and investment in higher education research and technology. Both parties will carry out comprehensive and in-depth cooperation in the field of laparoscopic surgical robot-assisted surgery systems, jointly building an international training and research center for minimally invasive surgery in Asia, cultivating highly skilled medical professionals, promoting the innovative application and popularization of surgical robots, and enhancing the level of medical science and medical services in the Greater Bay Area, China, and even globally, helping China lead in the development of minimally invasive surgery globally.\"\n\nProf. Samuel AU, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Cornerstone Robotics, said in his speech that It is an immense honor and a meeting of like-minded spirits for Cornerstone Robotics to establish a strategic partnership with School of MEDICINE of The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen. Cornerstone Robotics has always been committed to creating safe, efficient, easy-to-use, and accessible surgical robots to help more doctors learn how to use robots, bringing the most cutting-edge, high-quality medical services to more patients in need, and contributing to the development of surgical robot surgery in Asia and even globally. Cornerstone Robotics will continue to deepen its strategic cooperation with School of MEDICINE of The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, transforming innovative technology into clinical applications, cultivating more outstanding talents for the medical industry, and bringing higher quality medical services to patients.\n\nShared Mission\n\nDeepening the Global Surgical Robot Surgeon Training Program\n\nCornerstone Robotics has always believed that excellent surgical robots are the \"cornerstone\" of performing minimally invasive surgery, while excellent doctors are the \"cornerstone\" of medical progress. Only by combining the two can the development of surgical robot technology be promoted. Technological innovation and academic discipline construction mutually reinforce each other. The signing of this strategic cooperation will lay an essential foundation for the application and popularization of surgical robots, accelerating the innovation of medical science and technology. This will enable more patients to receive high-quality and effective treatments, reducing their pain and promoting faster recovery.\n\nSince its establishment in 2019, Cornerstone Robotics has always adhered to the corporate mission of \"Cornerstone to Better Healthcare\" through the establishment of a system that integrates scientific research, technological development, clinical transformation, and industrialization, it deeply understands clinical needs and effectively transforms them into research and development projects, solving clinical practical problems with independent innovation achievements.\n\nTo truly empower clinical practice with innovative technology, in March of this year, Cornerstone Robotics officially launched the \"Global Surgical Robot Surgeon Training Program\", aiming to train more surgeons to master the application knowledge and practical skills of surgical robots, thereby accelerating the popularization of surgical robots. This school-enterprise cooperation will further deepen the implementation of this strategic plan and actively promote the transformation and popularization of Cornerstone Robotics surgical robot results.\n\nCornerstone Robotics and School of MEDICINE of The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, have highly similar development strategies and visions. In the future, Cornerstone Robotics will continue to expand its strategic cooperation with School of MEDICINE of The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, looking forward to this cooperation bringing revolutionary changes to the surgical robot industry, cultivating more outstanding talents, and providing more precise and efficient medical services."
