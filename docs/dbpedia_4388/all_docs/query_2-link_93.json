        "text": "College News\n\nEngineering an Orange Legacy\n\nAndrew ‘25 and John ‘27 Vanderwege come from a family that bleeds Orange. Not only have several relatives attended Syracuse University, but their parents, Maureen ‘97 and Mike ‘96, are graduates of the College of Engineering and Computer Science. The University also happens to be the place where their parents would meet for the first time.\n\n“We were floor mates the second half of my junior year at DellPlain Hall. Maureen and my roommate, who was also a sophomore engineering major at the time, knew each other,” their father, Mike recalls. “We only met at the end of the year. Our hometowns are only 20 minutes apart and we got to know each other that summer.”\n\nGrowing up, Andrew and John loved watching SU sports with their parents and frequently visited campus to attend home games at the Dome. So, when it came time to choose colleges to apply to, Syracuse was an easy choice. “[My parents] played a big role in my decision since both of them went to Syracuse and both studied engineering,” says John. “I also felt at home whenever I would visit the campus or go to a basketball or football game.”\n\nBoth Andrew and John are pursuing degrees in environmental engineering, with Andrew’s interest lying in climate change. He’s also a member of the Combustion and Energy Research (COMER) Laboratory and interning with the sustainable engineering company Ramboll as part of a soil remediation group for the summer. “I knew that I wanted to go into engineering and climate change has always been something that interested me,” says Andrew. “Environmental engineering seemed to give me the best chance at making a positive impact on the climate.”\n\nJohn’s research interests include carbon capture, storage technology, and ocean acidification, areas he’s been able to explore through the civil and environmental engineering department’s comprehensive programs. He’s also considering other potential areas of study such as chemical engineering. “I wanted to do engineering since I enjoy hands-on activities as well as the math and science aspect of it,” says John. “I took an AP environmental class in high school which I enjoyed and made me realize that there are many different areas of the environment that can be studied.”\n\nThe two brothers’ passion for the environment goes beyond the classroom and they enjoy staying active as much as they love the outdoors. In their free time, the boys compete in Syracuse intramural sports like soccer and basketball and spend time hiking, biking, and backpacking. Since high school, John has also enjoyed playing ultimate frisbee and found Syracuse’s “Doom Ultimate Frisbee Club” the perfect place to get active and meet new people. “My favorite thing about Syracuse University is the opportunities available and the different majors on campus. It leads to the student body being comprised of people from all over and I really enjoy meeting others” says Andrew.\n\nMike and Maureen’s trips to Syracuse for sporting events and visiting their sons take them back to a time when they were students attending the University. “I remember falling in love with the campus and feeling a sense of belonging when I stepped foot on the Quad,” says Maureen.\n\n“The campus is very much the same, and that’s a good thing. It feels like home,” says Mike.\n\nMaureen, who currently works for her local school district as the Central Treasurer, received her bachelor’s in civil engineering and reflected on her experiences founding the Syracuse University chapter of Alpha Omega Epsilon, a professional and social sorority for women interested in STEM. “The experience of starting a chapter was difficult but rewarding and I’m so happy to see that the Zeta chapter is flourishing.”\n\nOne of her favorite things about Syracuse was the smaller, personalized classes in ECS. “I got to know our professors and classmates well. My first-year ECS class for undecided engineers was with Dr. [Samuel] Clemence. He showed us an airport in Osaka Bay that was built on an artificial island, and I was instantly hooked on civil engineering.”\n\nMike, who received his bachelor’s in mechanical engineering, works as a Senior Manager of Mechanical Engineering for L3Harris. He loved that Syracuse University had a wide variety of programs and opportunities outside of engineering. He initially leaned towards aerospace, then civil but eventually chose mechanical engineering as his major.\n\n“Realizing aerospace engineering may have a limited job market in western NY, combined with my enjoyment of the Mechanics of Materials class, I declared as a civil engineer after my sophomore year,” he says. “However, I had a mechanical engineering internship that summer in a manufacturing plant and I enjoyed the work they gave me along with the manufacturing culture. I therefore switched to mechanical engineering upon return to school at the start of my junior year.”\n\nThe parents couldn’t be more proud of their sons as they embark on the college experience and fully immerse themselves into Syracuse’s campus community. Keeping up with their traditions of attending SU sports games, they truly showcase a family united by their Orange pride.\n\n“I could fill pages and pages with memories and stories of my time at SU,” Mike says. “Picking a favorite would be difficult. I will share this more recent memory…We were at a football game, with Andrew and John in the student section and Maureen and I in the upper level above them. Watching them cheer on the Orange, combined with knowing they are in the classrooms of Link, walking the Quad, going to Marshall Street, and experiencing all that is SU… it brought my love for the university to an indescribably higher level.”\n\nPreparing the Next Generation of Biomedical and Chemical Engineers\n\nThe ESTEEMED LEADERS program at Syracuse University recruits and trains the next generation of biomedical engineers. Made possible by the National Institute of Health, the program supports undergraduate students from historically underserved backgrounds.\n\nThe program began during the summer of 2023 with immersive research experiences in the labs of biomedical and chemical engineering faculty. It includes a six-week summer bridge to help students transition from high school to college, scholarships, research, mentorship, and professional development resources. Beginning in their third academic year, students will also be enrolled in the Renee Crown University Honors Program.\n\n“In the ESTEEMED LEADERS program, we are focusing on developing our research skills and being exposed to lab environments to join a lab by our second semester. We’re also focused on developing skills such as calculus,” says biomedical engineering student Joshua Garcia ’28.\n\nThis year’s cohort worked with several biomedical and chemical engineering (BMCE) faculty, including Mary Beth Monroe, Shikha Nangia, Zhen Ma, Era Jain, and Yauying Wu. In Professor Monroe’s lab, students examined smart biomaterials for improved wound healing. In Professor Nangia’s lab, students received hands-on experience using computational tools to understand the physical structure and function of proteins, lipids, DNA, and RNA. In Professor Ma’s lab, students learned the significance and applications of induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) in research with hands-on and computational training.\n\n“I want to prioritize research in my future endeavors, and I believe this program is a great opportunity to do so,” says biomedical engineering student Aubrey Williams ’28.\n\nWhile collaborating with faculty and other students in the program, ESTEEMED LEADERS will receive training, mentorship, and support to enhance their confidence in their academic abilities. They will also receive focused mentoring skill development and preparation for careers in biomedical engineering research.\n\n“I’ve enjoyed interacting with other ESTEEMED LEADERS. We’ve been in different types of labs and spent a lot of time together working on projects and homework. Since I’m from New York City, it’s a new environment for me, but I’m glad I’ve grown a family here,” says biomedical engineering student Emily Gao ’28.\n\n“We currently have 10 outstanding students in our program who are doing research in biomedical engineering, and we look forward to welcoming new cohorts of students in 2025 and 2026,” says Shikha Nangia, the Principal Investigator of the ESTEEMED LEADERS program and professor and interim chair of the BMCE department.\n\nElectrical Engineering and Computer Science Alum Ademola Adejokun Joins Engineering Honor Society Tau Beta Pi\n\nElectrical engineering and computer science alum, Ademola Adejokun G’20, has joined Tau Beta Pi, the oldest engineering honor society, for his outstanding contributions to systems software development and research efforts in open standards for mission-critical embedded systems.\n\nFounded in 1885, Tau Beta Pi represents engineers from all disciplines and honors those who have demonstrated a history of academic and professional achievement.

I really enjoy working in higher ed. Some things that energize my work are helping students find their passion and the different talents and skills they have that they can apply to their real lives and do that reflection. A lot of what I do in my job is hold up a mirror to my students and show them who they are. It’s not about trying to be more or doing more. It’s about helping them discover what they have within them.\n\nDiscovering different opportunities, I wanted to transition into a more advising role that focused on success. This position aligned with the journey I wanted to go on.\n\nWhat is your role as a student success advisor?\n\nThe role of a student success advisor is to focus on the student and make sure they maximize their use of resources while they’re here. Especially with how big the university is, it’s easy to get lost and confused in figuring out who you are and what you want to do.\n\nIf I had a person in the position I have now when I was an undergrad, I would be a completely different person. I’m grateful to be where I am and offer the services I’m able to provide to my students.\n\nIt’s kind of like consulting to a certain degree. It’s different for each student depending on what’s going on in their lives. Making sure they are achieving their goals and pursuing their purpose while they’re here. We make sure they’re hitting all the milestones they must hit to graduate on time and build themselves up for their career.\n\nWhat are you most excited about in your current role?\n\nI am excited to build rapport with my students and become more creative in the ways that I help them define their success and encourage them to take action. In the age of social media, most people do a lot of talking but not a lot of doing. I look forward to encouraging my students to implement more action tools to put their thoughts and words into motion.\n\nWhat’s your favorite part about being a success advisor?\n\nHonestly, watching my students achieve their goals and not only be successful but feel successful. A lot of our wants and needs come from feeling. Nobody cares about what kind of car you’re driving–it’s about how you feel when you drive. I look forward to and enjoy watching my students find that within themselves. Helping them on that journey fulfills me a lot.\n\nDo you have any advice for students?\n\nDon’t be afraid to put yourself out there and ask questions. You have to be brave enough to sound foolish at times otherwise you won’t learn anything or go anywhere.\n\nWhat are some things you like to do for fun?\n\nI like to walk my dog, Beans, sing, cook, and hang out with friends.\n\nOur college offers a variety of support services for students.

This original device was presented as a senior design capstone project at the College of Engineering and Computer Science’s Open House and was created by Ralph Lawrence Graham ‘24, Taylor Michael Madison ‘24, Alfonso Rivas ‘24, and Ernest Whitbeck ‘24. In this Q&A session, team members Graham and Madison discuss their project.\n\nHow does your senior design capstone project work?\n\nGraham: Our project is a 3-tiered self-following motorized cart. The person using the cart wears a belt with a code on it. The code is then detected and that’s what triggers the cart to move. We used webcams attached to a Fusion 5 running image processing via Python that then feeds data to a PID controller system running on an Itsy Bitsy M4 chip to make the cart function.\n\nMadison: We also talked about having distance sensors on the lower half of the cart. It goes much slower in reverse than it does forwards. If you go forward, it will go forward but if you come toward it, it will go backward but not as fast.\n\nWhat inspired you to pursue this project?\n\nMadison: Our team member, Alfonso, originally had the idea of a suitcase that would follow you through an airport. Some faculty didn’t know how practical placing a bunch of batteries and cameras on a suitcase would be, especially considering security risks for the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and Federal Aviation Association (FAA).\n\nWe decided to go with something more utility-based that we could use around campus and came to a cart that could be used for a lab or food.\n\nAre there other applications this motorized cart can have?\n\nMadison: It can be applied to maintenance, hospitals, grocery stores, and even restaurants. We see all these areas benefiting from something like our cart for hands-free tasks.\n\nHow do you feel after completing your project?\n\nGraham: We achieved what we were intending. It took a lot of research and trying things out. It was a process, and it was amazing to see the result of it and how everything works. It helped develop our skills more and we look forward to doing more things in a professional environment.\n\nMadison: Even as a senior project that was supposed to be a showcase of what we’ve learned, we were learning continuously through this project. Continuously touching on other parts of engineering and developing skills we already have, it was great to put it all together.\n\nMechanical and Aerospace Engineering Student Andrea Hoe Joins NASA Graduate Research Fellowship\n\nAndrea Hoe ‘23 G‘28 was ecstatic when she received an invitation to join NASA’s Graduate Research Fellowship program. It felt like years of hard work had finally paid off. She had always been fascinated with space, but it wasn’t until high school that she discovered her passion for space architecture. Since then, she’s made it her mission to work with NASA and continue exploring her interests in cutting-edge design.\n\n“Whether it was participating in STEM programs or conducting independent research, my goals and achievements were strategic towards realizing my dream of becoming a space architect,” says the aerospace engineering student. “Now, to have the opportunity to collaborate with NASA feels like the culmination of a journey filled with challenges, setbacks, and moments of sheer determination. It is a surreal experience, and I am eager to begin this new chapter in my academic career.”\n\nShe initially began her undergraduate studies at Syracuse University as an architect student but found herself gravitating towards research opportunities. While architecture and space habitat design have their differences, she saw concepts that overlapped and knew she could apply her studies in architecture to space habitats.\n\n“Architecture provided me with a solid foundation in design principles and unconventional thinking. I knew I wanted to apply this knowledge to engineering. I believe the intersectionality of disciplines is important in today’s time and will push society forward. By embarking on this academic journey, I aim to bridge the gap between creativity and innovation to explore new possibilities for space exploration.”\n\nThe NASA Fellowship sponsors graduate student research and development of innovative space technologies. The fellowship includes a research grant, which will provide her the opportunity to research lunar regolith composites with carbon nanotubes for space habitation applications. The study aims to create a concrete-like structural material that can be made from soil on the moon, which is known as lunar regolith.\n\nThe primary focus of the research is to investigate the effects of adding carbon nanotubes to lunar regolith. Even a small amount of these nanotubes can significantly enhance the compressive strength of the lunar soil, making it an ideal choice for durable structural material in space architecture. “Our future testing plans are diverse and exciting as we aim to delve deeper into optimizing the composition and properties of this lunar regolith-based material. Space is an extreme environment, so exploring its durability and resilience is imperative.”\n\nShe believes this research is pivotal to ensuring secure and stable habitats on the moon as well as manned missions to Mars and beyond, paving the way for the future of human space exploration. “Syracuse’s architecture program empowered me to be creative and think critically, particularly in my final thesis project. The aerospace engineering department has allowed me to pursue my ambitions and gain insightful experiences. I am truly grateful. Receiving the NASA Fellowship and grant is an indescribable event for me. It is a validation of years of hard work, dedication, and unwavering determination.\n\n“I am so grateful for the support from the professors at Syracuse who assisted me in this journey and for the recognition from an institution as esteemed as NASA. I am particularly grateful for the mentorship of my research advisor, Dr. Wang, whose guidance and support have made this possible.”\n\nA Growing Quantum Community\n\nAssistant professor in electrical engineering and computer science Jason Pollack envisions a promising future for quantum at Syracuse University. As the College of Engineering and Computer Science (ECS) undergoes significant growth with renovated lab spaces, new faculty members, and groundbreaking research, it marks a transformative period not only for the college but for quantum-related fields as well.\n\n“It’s exciting for me to be in a place where you can build a program and culture from the ground up,” Pollack says. “I’ve been telling my students that by the time they finish their grad school career, there will probably be three times as many people in quantum-related subjects as there are now. It’s very exciting that Syracuse University has put in all these resources.”\n\nPrior to being an assistant professor in ECS, Pollack attended the California Institute of Technology for graduate school and completed post-doctoral fellowships at the University of British Columbia and the University of Texas at Austin. He became interested in how underlying quantum physics can be seen in the world around us and switched from physics to computer science, collaborating frequently with mathematicians, engineers, scientists and experts within related fields.\n\nPollack’s research focuses on the theory of quantum information. He aims to understand basic information and computational structures underlying quantum systems. He also collaborates with other faculty members studying quantum in ECS and across the university, particularly in discussing ideas such as random quantum walks in superconducting cavities and the design of metamaterials with exotic refractive index. This highlights the significant role theorists like Pollack play in quantum experiments.\n\n“Without theory, experimentalists wouldn’t know what theory to work on next. There’s always a whole set of possible things to do but then there’s the question of what to do next to increase my technical prowess or understanding. You have to take some steps to convert your results or what you’d like to understand about the world.”\n\nPollack’s paper published in March 2024 discusses quantum thermodynamics and focuses on understanding the entanglement structure of quantum states. When two particles become entangled, their properties may remain correlated regardless of the distance. “The world is made up of atoms and molecules, but if you want to run a heat engine, you don’t have to manipulate individual gasoline molecules to run the engine. I want to understand what types of interaction a quantum system can have with an environment so I can treat it like a traditional, classical thermodynamic system. If I wait long enough, it becomes characterized by its temperature or energy.”\n\nPollack also has research interests in quantum decoherence, which refers to the study of interactions between the environment and quantum systems (tiny particles like atoms and molecules.) His other research program is concerned with the physics seen by observers with only limited access to, or an imperfect ability to make measurements on, the quantum state.“Syracuse’s quantum community will be changing within a few years. The plan for ECS is to grow quantum faculty, and we’re going to be on the map. Students who want interdisciplinary work can certainly find it.”\n\nPollack will be teaching graduate course CIS 700 “The Structure of Quantum States” where students will learn the features of quantum-mechanical systems. Starting next academic year, he will also be teaching an undergraduate course on quantum computing.\n\nSyracuse University Leads Higher Education Consortium as Part of $40M Award to Advance Central New York’s Semiconductor Manufacturing Capabilities\n\nSyracuse University will play a leading role in advancing Central New York’s semiconductor manufacturing capabilities thanks to $40 million in new funds made available to the Buffalo-Rochester-Syracuse region through the U.S. Economic Development Administration’s Regional Technology and Innovation Hub. The new award for the New York Semiconductor Manufacturing and Research Technology Innovation Corridor (NY SMART I-Corridor) was announced yesterday by U.S. Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer at a press conference in Syracuse hosted by INFICON. J. Michael Haynie, vice chancellor for strategic initiatives and innovation, spoke at the event, and Duncan Brown, vice president for research, represented the University as principal investigator on Syracuse University’s component of the Tech Hub award.\n\n“This is a monumental victory for the Buffalo-Rochester-Syracuse region as the first major Tech Hub award in the nation, bringing a whopping $40 million from my CHIPS and Science Law. With this major investment, the feds are shining a national spotlight, and confirming what I have long known, that America’s semiconductor future runs through the heart of Upstate NY along the I-90 corridor,” said Senator Schumer. “From the fields near Syracuse that will become Micron’s massive mega-fab to the cutting-edge research labs in Rochester and workers learning these manufacturing skills in Buffalo, this award helps connect the region to seize this once-in-a-generation opportunity and establish Upstate NY as the heart of America’s semiconductor industry. I created the Tech Hubs competition with Upstate NY in mind, and pulled out all the stops to win this award—first proposing this program in my Endless Frontier Act, then passing it into law as part of my CHIPS and Science Act, making the case to bring the region together, advocating at the highest levels and delivering the transformational investment to make today possible. It’s never been more clear: the heart of America’s semiconductor industry runs along the I-90 corridor in Upstate NY!”\n\nSyracuse University will lead the NY SMART I-Corridor’s Collaboration and Commercialization Center (C3), which includes Cornell University, Rochester Institute of Technology, University of Rochester and University of Buffalo. C3 will administer millions of dollars in grants to allow small and medium-sized businesses to collaborate with the region’s universities, bring new ideas to market and accelerate growth of the semiconductor industry in the region.\n\n“Syracuse University is proud to lead this higher education collaboration that will help drive innovation and establish the NY SMART I-Corridor as a world leading entrepreneurial incubator for the semiconductor industry,” says Chancellor Kent Syverud. “I am grateful for Senator Schumer’s steadfast advocacy. This substantial new grant builds on major investments the University is making. It will help create critical high-tech infrastructure and facilities, attract top semiconductor manufacturing researchers and faculty to the region, and develop unique experiential learning and internship opportunities for talented students.”\n\nTo support the NY SMART I-Corridor, the University is investing $10 million, which is matched by a $10 million investment from Onondaga County, to create a state-of-the-art advanced semiconductor manufacturing facility. The center is part of a more than $100 million investment in strategically transforming STEM and expanding the College of Engineering and Computer Science (ECS) at Syracuse University over the next five years.\n\n“Together with our regional partners, and with the dedicated support of Senator Schumer, Syracuse University has a key role to play in the revitalization of Central New York,” says Haynie. “Today’s announcement is another exciting milestone in the realization of that goal, and we are gratified by the continuing opportunity to foster collaboration and innovation across the Tech Hub.”\n\nAs the NY SMART I-Corridor seeks to become the epicenter for American semiconductor commercialization efforts, C3 will integrate the region’s extensive assets into a single “point of entry” for small and medium-sized businesses, according to Brown.\n\n“In our knowledge-driven society, university-led research and development is central to economic development. C3 will allow businesses of all sizes to partner with universities to develop, prototype and test new products,” Brown says. “Through these partnerships, the NY SMART I-Corridor will accelerate the transfer of ideas from lab to market.”\n\nModeled on New York State’s Centers for Advanced Technology, C3 will drive innovation in the I-Corridor’s semiconductor supply chain by establishing:\n\nInnovation Asset/Expertise Engagement Network, an inventory of semiconductor relevant facilities and innovation expertise across the I-Corridor, accessible via a central online portal;\n\nKnowledge/IP Collaboration Architecture, a new IP architecture for the region that incentivizes cross-collaboration between sectors and institutions and strengthens commercialization efforts in the I-Corridor; and\n\nFormal Community of Practice, which will facilitate collaboration between businesses, researchers, investors and manufacturers in the region and sponsor programming and internships designed to benefit underrepresented communities.\n\nThe federal Tech Hub designation spans Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo and includes Ithaca, Auburn and Batavia. Key academic partners include Monroe Community College in Rochester, which will lead the hub’s workforce development efforts, and University at Buffalo, which will lead the effort to improve the region’s supply chain for semiconductors.\n\nSchumer created the Regional Tech Hubs competition as part of the CHIPS and Science Bill, and said the three-region consortium beat out hundreds of applications and was one of only 31 regions across the U.S. chosen for the Tech Hub designation.\n\nSpring 2024 Engineering and Computer Science Dean’s List\n\nIn recognition of superior scholarship,

Pitch Original Devices at Invent@SU 2024\n\nEight teams of engineering students presented designs for original devices to industry experts and investors. These students were part of Invent@SU, a six-week summer program where students design, prototype, and pitch to judges.\n\nOn June 20th, the teams gave their final pitch presentations to a panel of 14 expert judges. The room was filled with guests, including Dean Cole Smith, Syracuse University Life Trustee Bill Allyn and program supporter Mike Lazar. The event kicked off with poster presentations that gave the student teams the opportunity to showcase their inventions and answer questions from the judges.\n\nThis year’s competitors were:\n\nTreadBed: Jason Bae ’25 (biomedical engineering), Sandy Lin ’25 (computer science), Ian Roche ’25 (mechanical engineering), Colin Wanderman ’27 (mechanical engineering)\n\nA patient transfer device that reduces the amount of lifting required for caregivers when moving a patient between a stretcher and a hospital bed.\n\nMagniClaw: (Tied for Second Place) Davis Hood ’26 (electrical engineering), Jennifer Mason ’26 (mechanical engineering), Matthew Pinto ’27 (biomedical engineering), Carter Thompson ’26 (aerospace engineering)\n\nA device that securely locks wheelchairs in place for moving vehicles.\n\nSwift Straps: (Tied for Second Place) Jessica Moreno ’26 (aerospace engineering), Patrick Phanichyakarn ’26 (mechanical engineering), Amira Salihovic ’25 (biomedical engineering)\n\nRetractable, color-coded restraint straps that make transferring or transporting EMT patients more efficient.\n\nR!G: (Third Place) Robert Adinolfi ’28 (mechanical engineering), Brayden Phillips ’27 (chemical engineering), Jair Espinoza ’25 (computer science), Ava Lubkemann ’27 (environmental engineering)\n\nA lightweight, breathable suit that helps correct posture and provides lumbar support.\n\nCaddyTrack: Giancarlo d’Amore ’26 (mechanical engineering), Daniel Stitch ’26 (mechanical engineering), Tom Xiao ’28 (mechanical engineering)\n\nA golf cart that can track your ball and autonomously drive to the ball’s location.\n\nPhloat: (First Place) Elijah Alexander ’27 (civil engineering), Malak Aljerari ’27 (biomedical engineering), Nathan Brekke ’26 (computer science), Joshua Varkey ’26 (aerospace engineering)\n\nA phone case that has a compact, deployable flotation feature that activates if the phone falls into deep water.\n\nGymIn: Jack Friedman ’27 (chemical engineering), Antonio Goncalves ’27 (computer science), Alexander Hamza ’26 (biomedical engineering), Armani Isonguyo ’25 (computer engineering)\n\nA service that allows gyms to gather data on usage of their equipment.\n\nKare9: Richard Nguyen ’27 (mechanical engineering), Uchechukwuka Obiofuma ’25 (computer engineering), Mallika Saikhedkar ’26 (computer science), Juliana Sepulveda ’25 (biomedical engineering)\n\nAn all-inclusive solution for monitoring your dog’s health and ensuring their safety through a health harness.\n\nInvent@SU is made possible by program sponsor Michael Lazar, partner sponsor the Lyons Family Foundation, and team sponsor Ralph Folz. A special thank you to Bill and Penny Allyn for sponsoring multiple years since 2017.\n\n“Students learn about design, ideation and intellectual property, then conceive an original invention, prototype the invention and refine it in response to weekly feedback from diverse audiences of guest evaluators. In addition, students learn key business, entrepreneurship and professional skills, such as: communication, creating a “pitch,” financing a start-up, sustainable design, accounting, marketing, pricing, leadership and teamwork,” said Professor Alex Deyhim. “All 8 teams did an amazing job and walked away with invaluable lessons learned and friendships that will last a lifetime.”\n\nElectrical and Computer Engineering Students Develop Plastic Sorting Robot for Waste Management\n\nAs engineering students Fundi Juriasi ‘24, Hanna Salem ‘24, Prince Sarquah ‘24 and Sukhleen Atwal ‘24 brainstormed ideas for their senior design project, they couldn’t seem to land on an idea they all agreed on. Sarquah’s interest lay in robotics, Juriasi was fascinated with face-tracking cameras, and Salem liked the idea of a Lego sorter that could assort the bright-colored blocks by color. Inspired by her passion for the environment, it wasn’t until Atwal combined their ideas that the group finally came to a project they all loved: a camera-tracking, plastic-sorting robot.\n\nPlastic pollution continues to be a significant environmental issue, with millions of plastic items entering our planet’s oceans every year and this is often due to improper waste disposal. The engineering group’s plastic sorting robot shows promise in enhancing current waste management methods by automating the sorting process. They believe that this technology could play a crucial role in reducing landfill waste, increasing recycling rates, and promoting more sustainable practices.\n\n“Most plastics come with recyclable code, but the problem is, sometimes the code gets damaged, and it can’t be seen without advanced cameras,” Juriasi says. “We wanted to make our project more achievable, so we placed QR codes on objects to mimic how it can be implemented in the real world.”\n\nTheir robot, ARMie, uses a camera to scan QR codes and identify the type of material based on the code. With instructions from the user interface, ARMie sorts each item into the appropriate bin for recyclable, non-recyclable, or further sorting. This innovative system streamlines the recycling process, enhancing its efficiency and accuracy.\n\nThe hardware consists of the microcontroller board Arduino Uno, a robotic arm, servo motors, a PWM/servo driver, a camera, bins, and a power supply. The key technologies and software used for the project include the open-source code-writing software Arduino IDE, Python, graphical user interface (GUI), and QR codes.\n\nDespite the challenges that came with putting this ambitious project together such as mechanical durability and power supply balance, the students were able to present ARMie at the College of Engineering and Computer Science’s (ECS) Open House. “Overall, I would say this project was good. It has real-world applications and potential to impact sustainability,” says Salem.\n\n“By integrating technology with environmental sustainability, ARMie facilitates a smarter way to manage waste, offering a significant step forward in our recycling efforts,” says Juriasi.\n\nMechanical and Aerospace Graduate Student Melissa Yeung Joins National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship\n\nMelissa Yeung, a first-year Ph.D. student in mechanical and aerospace engineering, has joined the 2024 National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP). The fellowship offers three years of support for graduate research over a five-year period.\n\nYeung currently works in the fluid dynamics lab of Yiyang Sun, assistant professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering, and her research focuses on supersonic jet engines. “The goal of my work is to alleviate the undesired features through strategically placed small micro-jets of air,” Yeung says. “I am currently focused on optimizing these micro-jets such that they can continuously modulate themselves to adapt to various flight conditions. By doing so, the flow can be controlled even in off-design conditions and with minimal energy input.\n\n“Understanding these complex flow physics is vital for the development of next-generation high-performance aircraft. Successfully controlling this flow can improve upon the aircraft’s performance and ensure the safety of nearby workers or civilians. This work is one of many steps in pushing supersonic flight for commercial use.”\n\nYeung believes the fellowship will give her greater flexibility in her research, fund her research activities and enable her to attend more conferences. She’s also grateful for the support she’s received from Sun, Professor Emeritus Mark Glauser, and Gina Lee-Glauser, retired vice president for research.\n\n“Their guidance has been crucial to my success and without them, I would have not had the honor of being an NSF GRFP recipient,” Yeung says.\n\nJ. Cole Smith Reappointed to 5-Year Term as Dean of College of Engineering and Computer Science\n\nVice Chancellor, Provost and Chief Academic Officer Gretchen Ritter today announced that J. Cole Smith has been reappointed to a five-year term as dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Science (ECS). Today’s announcement follows a comprehensive review process that includes feedback from key stakeholders, including ECS faculty, staff and advisory board members.\n\n“In Cole’s nearly five years as dean, the College of Engineering and Computer Science has grown stronger on multiple counts and made great strides towards reaching a new level of excellence,” Provost Ritter says. “This is an exciting time for the college, and I can think of no better leader to shepherd the students, faculty, staff and alumni into this new era.”\n\nSmith assumed leadership of ECS in October 2019. His tenure has been marked by several high points for the college. A massive renovation, which included multiple new lab spaces and the Allyn Innovation Center, served to modernize ECS buildings and facilities. The pending new Campos Student Center, supported by a recent $2 million gift that Smith helped secure, will further enhance the college’s physical space.\n\nSmith oversaw the development of the new Syracuse University Center for Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing, an interdisciplinary center that brings together expertise in artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, manufacturing processes, optimization and robotics to advance the science of semiconductor manufacturing. He also helped launch a new master’s degree program in operations research and system analytics, as well as the signature co-op program.\n\nUnder Smith’s leadership, ECS research expenditures grew by 30% during the 2022-2023 academic year over 2019 levels. Enrollment, faculty size and staff size are also on track to grow by 50% in the next four years as part of a plan Smith developed. He also helped guide the college toward bronze-level status in the American Society for Engineering Education’s Diversity Recognition Program.\n\n“Engineering and Computer Science is driving regional, national and international growth in areas such as advanced manufacturing, sustainable infrastructure, healthcare engineering, advanced computing technologies and materials science,” Smith says. “I have never been a part of a more exciting moment at the nexus of college, University, city and national growth. What we are doing here matters and will resonate for decades to come, and it is a true privilege to have the opportunity to realize the transformational opportunity that awaits Syracuse University and the College of Engineering and Computer Science.”\n\nSmith came to Syracuse from Clemson University, where he held positions as associate provost for academic initiatives and chair of the Department of Industrial Engineering. His research focuses on integer programming and combinatorial optimization, network flows and facility location, computational optimization methods and large-scale optimization due to uncertainty or robustness considerations. In 2023, he was named an Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences (INFORMS) fellow.\n\nSyracuse University Joins Team in $650K National Science Foundation Award to Accelerate Drinking Water Solutions for Small Communities\n\nWith funds sub-awarded through the U.S. National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Convergence Accelerator program, Syracuse University’s Center for Sustainable Community Solutions (CSCS) will help develop more accessible pathways for small communities to develop and maintain safe drinking water infrastructure. This collaborative project will focus on communities in Puerto Rico, with the ultimate goal being to use this case study as a framework that can be replicated in other U.S. locations and beyond. The project officially kicked off in February 2024.\n\nAccess to clean drinking water is a right for all that is threatened by the looming climate crisis. In 2022, 2.2 billion people lacked safely managed drinking water; and 2 billion people lacked a basic hand washing facility, according to the National Institutes of Health.\n\nMany of those without access are communities of less than 10,000 people who face their own unique obstacles. In Puerto Rico, challenges for these small communities include limited economic resources and severe natural disaster risk, which is amplified by climate change. Unless viable and proactive solutions are developed, this lack of access will prevail.\n\nThis $650,000 research project, named VersaWater by its team, is funded by the NSF Convergence Accelerator Program and led by Cornell University in partnership with CSCS; Interamerican University of Puerto Rico’s Center for Environmental Education, Conservation and Research; and AguaClara Reach.\n\nThrough the Convergence Accelerator Program, the water research team will use a multidisciplinary, collaborative approach to accelerate the science and community engagement practices around Puerto Rico’s safe drinking water technology using three convergent focus areas: governance and financing, community education and workforce training, and resilient water system technologies.\n\n“The Center for Sustainable Community Solutions (CSCS), which operates the Environmental Finance Center (EFC), has been a leader in environmental finance for over 30 years,” shared CSCS Director and the water project’s Co-Principal Investigator Melissa Young. “Ensuring that funding is not only available for investments like this but that it is also accessible is crucial to making everlasting change for the health and welfare of small communities.”\n\nShe continued, “We’re proud to be a part of the esteemed NSF Convergence Accelerator Program, which importantly prioritizes community-focused research and social impact.”\n\nCSCS aims to identify how small communities can better access federal funding made available through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) — a law that authorized billions of dollars for federal investment, including significant financial support for water infrastructure in small communities — and the barriers they experience in doing so. CSCS leverages over three decades of community-based work in EPA Region 2 (which includes New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and eight Native Nations.)\n\nCornell Engineering is leading VersaWater (formerly called WaterSAVerS), bolstered by its ties to the non-profit AguaClara Reach, who have together been developing open-source sustainable water treatment technologies specifically for small and very small communities in the Global South over the past 20 years, according to Ruth Richardson, the water project’s Principal Investigator representing Cornell.\n\n“The AguaClara technology aims to create gravity-powered water treatment plants specifically for small and very small communities. Innovations in automated dosing, water movement, and hydraulics create treatment plants that ease operation and maintenance demands since labor is a major cost for [these communities],” Richardson said.\n\nWhat’s ahead\n\nCSCS and team are currently in Phase 1 of the NSF Convergence Accelerator Program. Over the course of nine months, the water team will develop their initial idea into a proof of concept, identify new team members and partners, and participate in the NSF Convergence Accelerator’s Phase 1 innovation curriculum, which provides fundamentals in human-centered design; team science; use-inspired research; early-stage prototyping; and communications, storytelling, and pitching.\n\nAt the end of Phase 1, the water team will participate in a competitive formal NSF pitch and proposal process, which is used in selecting teams for Phase 2. Teams selected for Phase 2 will continue accelerating their solutions toward impact. By the end of the Convergence Research phases, solutions are expected to impact societal needs at scale and be sustainable beyond NSF support.\n\nThe Center for Sustainable Community Solutions (CSCS) at Syracuse University\n\nCSCS is a nonprofit organization working at the intersection of sustainability communications, policy, and science to foster economic well-being, environmental stewardship, and social equity by engaging community members at all levels to provide the coordination and knowledge needed to make informed decisions that\n\nsupport sustainability, resiliency, and climate adaptation. The Syracuse University Environmental Finance Center (EFC), operated by CSCS, is a pillar in this mission that facilitates the development of sustainable and resilient communities throughout US EPA Region 2 (New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, and eight Native Nations) and nationally.\n\nU.S. National Science Foundation\n\nThe U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) is an independent federal agency that promotes the progress of science by investing in research to expand knowledge in science, engineering, and education across all 50 states and territories. NSF supports nearly 2,000 colleges, universities, and other institutions through competitive grants aimed at advancing science with broad impacts across the nation and its people.

The award recognizes individuals with outstanding contributions to the understanding of liquid and gas behavior in motion and notable accomplishments within the aerospace community. This prestigious award is proudly sponsored by the AIAA Fluid Dynamics Technical Committee.\n\nGlauser was selected for his seminal contributions to the innovative use of multi-point low-dimensional methods for understanding and control of turbulent flows. He will be recognized during the 2024 AIAA AVIATION Forum and AIAA ASCEND event in Las Vegas, Nevada in July. He will also give a special Fluid Dynamics Award Lecture.\n\n“This is indeed a great honor for me and reflects very positively on the Syracuse University mechanical and aerospace engineering department and the approximately 70 of my outstanding MS and Ph.D. students who have been key to my success,” says Glauser.\n\nCivil and Environmental Engineering Research Group Wins 2024 Best Case Study Award from Environmental and Water Resources Institute\n\nA civil and environmental engineering research group has won the 2024 Best Case Study Award in the Journal of Sustainable Water in the Built Environment. The paper was written by graduate student Lucie Worthen G’19 along with Assistant Professors Christa Kelleher from the College of Arts and Sciences and Cliff Davidson from the College of Engineering and Computer Science (ECS). The award is nominated and selected by the Environmental and Water Resources Institute (EWRI) editorial board.\n\nThe research group was awarded for their work on “A Diagnostic Analysis of Low-Impact Development Simulations with Stormwater Management Model (SWMM).” The paper compares the results of the SWMM of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency with measurements of stormwater runoff from the green roof of the Nick Pirro Convention Center owned by Onondaga County.\n\nWorthen, Kelleher, and Davidson will be recognized at the 2024 American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) Convention during the awards and lectures presentation.\n\n2.15M Forever Orange Campaign Gift Will Establish New Student Center for the College of Engineering and Computer Science\n\nSince childhood, Marco Campos has carved his own path, one that took him from poverty to great success. Today, Campos, together with his sister, Deanna Campos-Miller, are committed to creating opportunities for educational institutions and communities in support of student success through their foundation, Campos Foundation.\n\nThrough the foundation, Campos, whose son is a third-year student in the College of Visual and Performing Arts, has just pledged $2.15 million to Syracuse University as part of the Forever Orange Campaign. The gift will fund a new student center in the College of Engineering and Computer Science (ECS). The student center will offer programming designed to attract underrepresented students to the college and support the academic success of all ECS students. It comes at a time of tremendous growth for ECS. As part of the University’s Academic Strategic Plan, ECS will grow its enrollment and faculty ranks by 50% by 2028.\n\n“The Campos Student Center will provide dedicated space for our students with a home for collaboration, community and access to resources that maximize their success,” says ECS Dean J. Cole Smith. “This space will facilitate club activities that enhance the experience of our diverse student body. More than that, it will be a home on campus that is inviting and welcoming to all.”\n\nThe Campos Student Center will be housed on the second floor of the Center for Science and Technology.\n\nMarco and his sister grew up in West Denver, Colorado, raised by a single mother with limited resources. Campos-Miller says her brother literally wore the boots in the family. “Marco got the snow boots, but I didn’t have any, so when we had to walk to school in the snow, he would walk in front of me and pave the way to school,” says Campos-Miller. “He told me, ‘Walk right behind me in my footprints.’”\n\nToday, the siblings are paving the way for student success through the Campos Foundation.\n\n“As a young teenager, I didn’t have role models,” says Campos. “I sensed there was something bigger, but there wasn’t a clear path.” He was talented in math but received little encouragement or support until becoming part of a summer bridge program in his senior year of high school. That opened the door to engineering at the University of Colorado in Boulder where, for the first time, his potential was recognized and cultivated. “I never loved engineering and math, but I saw the pathway to a career in an engineering degree,” says Campos. “It was grueling work, but the perseverance and grind ultimately get you there. You have to be consistent and hold the course.”\n\nCampos-Miller says her brother has never forgotten where he came from. “Marco wants to elevate as many people as possible, and he can do that by funding the right kinds of programs,” says Campos-Miller. “Grit, perseverance and compassion are the best ways to describe Marco. He was always a really good dreamer!”\n\nCampos’ gift was inspired by a recent visit to campus and by the success of an earlier gift made by his foundation to the University of Colorado in Boulder. He says he saw the geography and the demographics of Syracuse and thought he could make a similar impact. He believes the new student center will be a welcoming and inclusive home where engineering, computer science, and other STEM students can go for academic support, financial advice and career direction. The student center is intended to inspire those who have big hopes and dreams but maybe haven’t been empowered in the past, he says.\n\n“This kind of philanthropic support represents a true endorsement of and investment in the vision, mission and strategic planning of the College of Engineering and Computer Science,” says Chancellor Kent Syverud. “I am grateful to Marco and Deanna for their commitment to Syracuse University and am confident this center will have an impact on generations of students pursuing career paths in engineering.”\n\nCampos’ career began with an internship at Texaco during his college years, and he was hired immediately upon graduation. By age 30, he had accumulated enough work and consulting experience, confidence and wealth to start his own company and start giving back. Campos EPC, established in 2005 with headquarters in Denver, offers engineering, procurement and construction counsel for utility, energy and midstream organizations. The company also offers STEM education initiatives through a community outreach program, while the foundation supports summer bridge programs, scholarships and SmartLabs at primary and secondary schools, among other initiatives.\n\n“When I talk about the company, I rarely talk about the business,” says Campos. “Everyone can engineer. Everyone can project manage, but I want to be known for trying to improve the community and improve quality of life.”\n\nHe credits his hard-working employees for their commitment to giving back and driving the success of the Campos Foundation. He notes that the guiding principle of Campos companies is, “Our People are our Power,” and the power of philanthropy rests with his employees.\n\nCampos and his sister believe the foundation’s intensive focus on mission through philanthropy, and the recruitment of specialized talent to lead and manage these kinds of student-centered programs helps universities “move the needle” when it comes to attracting students of all backgrounds to engineering fields. “This has become our corporate and social responsibility,” says Campos. “You have to be focused and disciplined and patient in your approach. Working with the University, we set up metrics to make sure the funding is accomplishing our established goals.”\n\nCampos-Miller says the naming of the new student center aligns the hopes and dreams of students with the man who forged an enviable path to success. “Campos isn’t just a name. It’s the story behind the name. It represents possibilities and pathways to get there.”\n\n“We all have a sphere of influence and it’s incumbent on each of us to affect our sphere of influence in the most positive ways we can,” says Campos. “Putting good out there in the universe brings back good, even more than we put out.”\n\nElectrical and Computer Engineering Students Develop Smart Cane for Vision Accessibility\n\nNew York City has over 12,000 miles of sidewalks, thousands of buses, and a huge transit system that can get you from one end of the city to the other. It’s perfect for pedestrians – but how accessible is it?\n\nVision loss affects hundreds of New Yorkers, who may find it difficult to navigate sidewalks, crosswalks, and intersections. However, steps are being taken to address these accessibility issues. Along with recent federal court orders for NYC to install accessible pedestrian signals throughout the city, four electrical and computer engineering students are taking accessibility a step further with their navigational cane, Pear Vision+.\n\n“We knew we wanted to make something that was really practical and useful,” says Armani Isonguyo ‘25. “Traditional canes serve only as a physical extension of the user, providing information of any obstacles within 5 feet proximity. Our cane offers comprehensive navigational aid.”\n\nCreated by Isonguyo, Alexander Segarra ‘24, Elliot Salas ‘24, and Isaish Fernandez ‘24, the engineering group’s smart cane can identify obstacles in a person’s way, which direction they’re facing the obstacle, and whether the objects are moving. It also provides feedback through audio descriptions via Bluetooth and vibrations, giving users a better understanding of their surroundings.\n\n“I love video games and Nintendo Switches and PlayStation 5s all incorporate vibration into gameplay,” Salas says. “The original idea was actually to put a PlayStation 5 motor in the cane for vibration, but we used a 5V haptic motor disk instead.”\n\nThe smart cane is equipped with NVIDIA’s Jetson platform, which helps it identify objects in the surrounding environment. It also has a depth-sensing camera that can determine distances and create a three-dimensional view of the environment. This assists visually impaired individuals in identifying obstacles in real time and navigating their surroundings safely. The cane was also modeled using Shapr3D, a 3D modeling tool.\n\n“With the design, we didn’t focus too much on the length or thickness of the cane, based on previous inspirations in the real world,” says Segarra. “We focused more on the handle and the angle you would want to hold so it doesn’t break.”\n\nThe students presented Pear Vision+ at the College of Engineering and Computer Science’s (ECS) Open House and also won the William Peil Award for the best electrical engineering and computer science senior design project. They see potential for their project to impact the lives of many.\n\n“I saw this project as one that was meaningful in advancing a certain industry and the world. I’m glad to be part of something that can be impactful,” says Segarra.\n\n“This project not only pushed the boundaries of what we can achieve with technology but also taught us the importance of engineering solutions that make a real difference in people’s lives. We are proud to contribute to a more accessible world,” says Isonguyo.\n\nGet to Know New Biomedical and Chemical Engineering Professor Michael Blatchley\n\nMichael Blatchley’s broad experiences in biomedical engineering and interests in tissue formation made him the perfect fit for both the College of Engineering and Computer Science and the BioInspired Institute. Get to know Blatchley as he discusses his career path, advice to students, and his new role as an assistant professor.\n\nTell us about yourself and what brought you to Syracuse University. What sparked your interest in teaching here?\n\nI’m originally from Indiana, went to Purdue in my hometown of West Lafayette, lived in Baltimore, Maryland for graduate school at Johns Hopkins, moved to Boulder, Colorado during my postdoc, and now, of course, I’m in Syracuse. I’ve been lucky to experience many different areas of the country and loved my experiences in each place, but Central New York fits my interest in the outdoors, and Syracuse itself has been a great fit for my family.\n\nI was drawn to Syracuse University by my great interactions with faculty and students, the investment in junior faculty, and the collaborative nature of a lot of the current research on campus. I can envision numerous collaborations within biomedical and chemical engineering (BMCE) as well as across disciplines in other departments. I’m really looking forward to working as part of the BioInspired Institute because I of course love the science and engineering components, but I also love the arts and think the crossover between the arts and sciences can lead to interesting and innovative ideas.\n\nWhat are your research interests?\n\nDespite my earliest career aspirations to become an NBA All-Star, my genetics precluded me from success along that career trajectory, so I decided instead to pursue a career in academia.\n\nI’m interested in understanding how tissues form, and how we can take what we learn from biology to build ever-improving models of human tissues in the lab. We can use these models to understand aspects of fundamental biology and tissue regeneration, but also to model disease and, perhaps someday, produce lab-grown tissues for transplantation.\n\nWhat made you interested in this research?\n\nI became interested in this type of work through a circuitous path spanning a few different fields. When I was an undergraduate, I chose to major in Biomedical Engineering because I had broad interests in all fields that made up the “fundamentals of engineering,” and I liked how those could be applied to solving problems in human health. I also knew I was interested in research, so I looked for a number of different summer research opportunities throughout my undergraduate years.\n\nI first worked at a small startup/contract research company synthesizing and characterizing different biomaterials for medical applications. I then worked in plant biochemistry for a summer through a program funded by HHMI to merge statistics and biology, where I learned a lot of transferrable research skills and how genetically modified organisms can be used to study fundamental science toward real-world applications. Finally, I worked in a clinical research lab with a focus on pulmonology. These broad experiences, combined with my exposure to tissue engineering during a course in my senior year, laid a perfect foundation for me to pursue a PhD with a focus on tissue engineering.\n\nI went into the PhD program with more of an interest in translational work but really developed a love for work in building fundamental in vitro models as well. Since then, my work has spanned the spectrum of tissue engineering, from projects focused on more fundamental modeling of regeneration to designing materials to better characterize in vitro organ models, to engineering dynamic materials to control how tissues form in a reproducible and predictable way. I am fascinated by learning how tissues grow so we can better grow them ourselves, and the field of tissue engineering is perfect to pursue research questions around this central premise.\n\nWhat are you most excited about in your role as an assistant professor?\n\nSomething that really attracts me about academia is the intellectual freedom. Along those lines, I am looking forward to continuing my own work and following my research interests in new directions through collaboration and discovery. But what I’m looking forward to even more is helping guide and mentor students and other trainees toward finding what they are passionate about in research or in their chosen career paths.\n\nWhat advice do you have for students?\n\nDon’t be afraid to go out of your comfort zone and learn new things. My most memorable classes helped me broaden my interests rather than narrow my scope of study. The same goes for research. I worked in a wide range of fields that helped me refine my interests to pursue research I was passionate about.\n\nAlways ask a question if you have it (maybe ask it in your head one time before you ask it out loud to make sure it’s thoughtful and constructive, but don’t be afraid to ask it!).\n\nWhat are some things you like to do for fun?\n\nI love to spend time with my family outside, hiking, biking, running, skiing, etc. I’m also a film buff, but weirdly my 18-month-old daughter isn’t as interested in Lynchian horror and 80s schlock as I am. I like to cook and bake, as well. Reviews range from feigned interest to shocking surprise.\n\nSyracuse University, Onondaga County Make Combined $20M Investment to Launch the Syracuse University Center for Advanced Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nSyracuse University today announced its plans to launch the Syracuse University Center for Advanced"
